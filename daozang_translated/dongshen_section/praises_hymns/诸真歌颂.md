**Hymns of the Various Perfected**

**Hymn to the Great Mystery Sutra of the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity**
Vermilion radiance illumines the cloud-court,
Purple mist gleams through the jade grove.
Resplendent, the seven-jeweled blossoms,
Dazzling, the jade numinous tones.
Gong and shang harmonize of themselves,
Wondrous spirits open the human breast.
Mysterious chant sows the field of fortune,
Vastly ferrying the boundless heart.

**Hymn to the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity**
The mysterious transformation leaves no trace,
Yet traces give rise to the ancestral Dao.
Roaming the nine heavens’ verge,
Halting his chariot at the six-ridge palace.
The Dao flows freely in the void and silence,
Numinous songs arise in the great emptiness.
Form responds to the court of utmost stillness,
Thought and chant commune through the subtle and fine.

**Hymn to the Supreme Lord of the Grand Tenuity**
In the dim dawn of primal transformation,
Faintly the morning glow disperses.
Above the great stillness and empty mystery,
The two modes part in clarity and vastness.
Congealing essence, embracing the empty womb,
Structuring transformation, gestating numinous vision.
Holding the real within to nurture the spirit,
Suddenly the dark dawn breaks.
Only then is the sorrow of fleeting years realized,
As fate turns back toward the celestial Han.

**Hymn to the Original Birth Sutra of Lord Lao**
The root-origin of all beings,
Still and without arising or ceasing.
Weak and lost, they stray from their root,
Themselves sundered from the true source.
Falsely creating bonds of good and evil,
Karma’s retribution knows no end.
To overturn the sea of suffering,
Let the river of craving run dry.
Guard the One, firm in soft concentration,
Hold fast to this without flaw or lack.
Right wisdom pervades all existence,
Wondrous insight shatters all knots.
Myriad practices merge in return,
The three vehicles dissolve their divergent tracks.
True stillness departs from dust and defilement,
Cool and serene, without affliction or heat.

**Hymn to the Supreme Wisdom’s Return to the Mystery Sutra**
Numinous immortals ride the auspicious clouds,
Mounting dragons, treading the dark waves.
Accord with the real, manifesting fine omens,
Washing their feet in the eight celestial rivers.
Fortune’s response does not await my seeking,
Thus they loosen the heavenly nets.
Virtue crowns the three realms,
Even the earthly snares are passed.
Moved by encounter with the numinous assembly,
Pure wisdom flowers through the lotus.

**Hymn to the Supreme Wisdom Sutra**
To learn immortality, sever ornate thoughts,
Each thought building upon the last.
Coming and going disturb my spirit,
Spirit restless, nothing remains unexperienced.
Extinguish thoughts, rest in empty leisure,
Whispering, enter the stillness of emptiness.
Seek the sutras as if parched with thirst,
Hold your resolve firm as metal and stone.
Preserve the child, soar the dark path,
The five spirits ferry you across the talismanic registers.

**Hymn to the Sutra of the Fundamental Vows and Great Precepts**
To learn immortality, conduct is urgent,
Uphold the precepts to restrain the heart’s passions.
Let the upright qi dwell in emptiness and ease,
Immortal sages will naturally seek you out.
If you do not trust the Dharma’s words,
Why dwell in the mountain forests?

**Song of the Jade Emperor’s Bestowal of the Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Great Cavern and Ascension to the Dragon Terrace**
Howling, the three auroras lead,
Circling, the seven boundless canopies.
Eight luminaries enter the Grand Origin,
Flying and scattering beyond the nine heavens.
Jade portals birth radiant clouds,
Numinous mists dispel deep obscurity.
In the western palace, the Cavern Mystery is chanted,
Pure songs rise to the Fusang’s verge.
Abiding in the feminine amidst towering peaks,
Mysterious hymns gather the Five Elders.
Suddenly, a heart arises—
With you, I bind the central sash.

**Second Stanza**
The gourd river stirs its azure vastness,
The celestial ford drums myriad streams.
Eight winds drive the divine auroras,
Far and faint, roaming the void’s midst.
Chanting the Cavern Spirit’s luminous hymns,
The sound becomes your dark offering.
Suddenly, the inevitable arises in conduct,
Elbow bent, hastening through the dust.
How bitter the heart’s toil—
I shall tell you what you seek.

**Hymn to the Scripture of the Purple Radiance and Transformations of the Blazing Light, Bestowed by the Queen Mother of the West**
Whistling songs on the ninefold numinous terrace,
Cliff ridges congeal in chilly seclusion.
The mind’s principles course through the six senses,
The eyes abandon the dust’s turbid haze.
Flowing auroras illuminate the golden chamber,
The empty hall disperses layered mysteries.
Accumulated resonance summons the numinous descent,
Form alone, yet the Dao also divides.
Cultivating the sudden, gazing across ten thousand kalpas,
How could one notice the passing of eons?

**Second Stanza**
Lush gardens adorn the numinous steps,
Crimson portals in the jade-forest court.
Flowing winds drum the hollow vastness,
Jade pipes ride the void’s sighing.
Purple mists coil through winding doors,
Vermilion radiance gleams on green carriages.
Flying banners cluster beneath dark canopies,
Feathered staves shine in the purple clarity.
Ascending the nine auroras’ verge,
Roaming and playing in the phoenix city.
Gazing back, loving the secluded one,
One joy shared with the morning’s birth.

**Third Stanza**
Reining in the bright radiance,
Feasting in the wilds beyond the dark expanse.
Wandering, seeking the numinous person,
Joining forms at the auroras’ verge.
Hand parting the crimson-mound portals,
Bright as the divine’s tranquil peace.
Golden towers rise in towering splendor,
Pure radiance without dust or defilement.
Loosening my robe on the dark terrace of Lang,
Fulfilling my heart’s true wish.
Shedding the three paths’ trials,
Preserving refinement to secure old age.

**Hymn to the Perfected of the Primordial One, the Natural Supreme and Mysterious One**
Myriad wonders emerge from the Cavern Real,
Resplendent, illuminating the Grand Clarity.
Those who uphold it are called immortals,
Their bodies forever enduring life.
Carefree, they sport in the dark void,
Palaces arrayed without form.
Lush and radiant, the seven-jeweled grove,
Gleaming with the sun and moon’s essence.
Dragons and unicorns gallop in crisscross flight,
Phoenixes soar in mournful song.
The Supreme governs the purple terrace,
The Perfected chant the Cavern Sutra.
Pinching incense, bowing in reverence,
Circling the palace city in procession.
Three rounds return to the high seat,
The Dao King responds in kind.
The ruler who magnifies the supreme Dao,
Brings universal peace beneath heaven.

**Hymn to the Supreme’s Magnification of the Dao**
The Supreme’s dark and empty ancestral Dao,
Magnifies its scriptures with reverence.
Looking up and down, immortality is attained,
Passing through kalpas without number.
Majestic, the Grand Real’s virtue,
Still, it arises from non-arising.
Auroras weave the empty branches,
Riding the void, naturally journeying.
Sun and moon shine with brilliant light,
Peace and harmony, joy without end.

**Songs of the Numinous Consort of the Eastern Flower Chamber of the Fangzhu Palace**
Purple cassia grows in the jade garden,
Crimson blossoms resound in mournful tones.
The moon-palace births the elixir’s abyss,
Within the sun lies the jade pool.
To the left, plucking the round numinous radiance,
To the right, grasping the vermilion aurora’s glow.
Flowing gold illumines the crimson court,
Eight luminaries dispel the returning mists.
Green canopies float in bright clarity,
Commanding staves to summon the Grand Tenuity.
Phoenix essence, youthful and radiant,
Jade richness sates eternal hunger.
Grasping the dawn, drawing the primordial simplicity,
Mounting the sudden, soaring the jade steps.
Inhaling and exhaling the six voids’ qi,
Jade maidens attend with towel and sash.

Plucking the zither to summon southern clouds’ fan,
Fragrant winds stir embroidered robes.
Striking the *shang* note, a hundred beasts dance,
The Six Heavens seize their numinous might.
Swift as a minnow’s flick, a hundred million aeons,
Age’s span towers in solemn grandeur.
The small fry yet uncooked in the cauldron—
I speak my sorrow beneath the crags.

**The Azure Lad, Great Lord, ever sings:**
To plant the root of extinction’s end,
One must uproot the self of birth and death.
Sighing, I sink to the Nine Springs,
Yet sit lamenting this bodily frame.

**The Perfected of Great Voidity ever sings:**
Beholding spirit borne by form,
It is as a chariot drawn by horses.
When the chariot breaks and horses bolt,
The bond dissolves in a fleeting loan.
Mourn this world for knowing only this—
Naught but the lament of wind and fire.
Sowing transgression on heaven’s net,
Reaping poison in hell’s depths.

**The Perfected Lord Wang of Western City ever sings:**
The body is the spirit’s ferryboat,
Moored at the shore, they must part ways.
Form is not spirit’s eternal abode,
Spirit is not form’s constant bearer.
Wandering the wheel of birth and death,
Only the heart’s hesitation brings suffering.

**The Perfected Lord Wang of Lesser Existence ever sings:**
Losing the Dao, one follows death’s ford,
The three souls stray from life’s path.
Life’s days grow ever distant,
Death’s days come ever too soon.
Alas, the wretched traveler,
Whose root and flower are overturned.
Rising to join the scattered dust,
How can the horse know to return from withered age?

The four poems above—on the night of the Autumn Equinox’s Jade Terrace Grand Assembly—were sung by the Four Lords to harmonize with the celestial zither’s *Xuangou Guangshao* strains. Recounted by the Lady of Right Radiance.

**Guo Sichao often rows a small boat in the pond, striking the hull to sing:**
The limpid pool girds the numinous peak,
Endless groves lush with verdant green.
Dark crows soar o’er the secluded wilds,
Words of awakening flow with ease.
Stroking the oars, riding the spirit-waves,
I bow my head, yearning for the dawn wind.
Unattained is the hour of liberation,
I wander carefree in the hills and groves.

**Second Song:**
Beyond the Nine Abysses, the Wave Spirit,
I refine the Dao to perfect my true self.
I sheathe this numinous phoenix’s wings,
Conceal my radiant dragon’s scales.
Exalting this inch of heart,
Ten thousand gusts are but dust and grime.
Pity the ephemeral mayfly,
Who can exhaust your chariot’s wheels?

**Third Song:**
Roaming the void, not swept by the whirlwind,
My spirit-steps tread the formless realm.
The round radiance gleams with bright auroras,
Nine phoenixes sing at dawn’s first light.
Brandishing my pinions, I fan the Celestial Ford,
Obscure mists soar with felicitous clouds.
Thus I reach the Palace of Great Tenuity,
Sipping this golden pear nectar.
Wandering beyond the dark abysses,
Neither abiding nor perishing.

**Fourth Song:**
Driving the sudden, dancing in the divine heavens,
Robes of aurora gird the nine suns.
The High Emperor matches the dragon-wheel’s pace,
Thus I reach the Northern Flower Chamber.
The spirit-tiger dwells in the jade grove,
Wind and cloud merge as one.
Opening and closing the gates of dark mystery,
The numinous transformations vanish in the unseen.

**The Life-Preserving Immortal Lord instructs Xu Huya and Du Guangping, who often delight in song:**
Pure light veils the vast forest,
The hazy sun ascends the eastern aurora.
Morning winds dance through the six mists,
The eight paths surge in exuberance.

How need the Five Peaks boast their beauty,
When any famed mountain may yet rise sublime?
With delicate hands I gather the cavern’s bounty,
My heart nestles where hidden resurgence begins.
Exhaling and inhaling the primal qi of the womb,
Who can surpass the mystery of the Dark and White?

**The Queen Mother of the West feasts with Emperor Wu of Han; the Lady of the Supreme Prime plucks the Cloud-Forest zither and sings the "Step-in-Void" melody:**
Once I trod the Way of Dark Perfection,
Ascending in strides the Great Auroral Mists.
Shouldering my satchel, I reached Heaven’s Gate,
And asked the whereabouts of the Supreme Lord’s abode.
Suddenly I passed the Purple Tenuity Enclosure,
Where perfected beings stood thick as hemp.
Verdant light stirred with the pure breeze,
Cloud-canopies gleamed with crimson blossoms.
The Orchid Palace unfolded its pearl fans,
The azure vault revealed its jasper sands.
Cinnabar terraces wove through empty branches,
Eyes flashed with radiant splendor.
Flying phoenixes perched on ridgepole peaks,
The Torch Dragon leaned in sinuous repose.
The Jade Embryo brought forth crimson mushrooms,
Nine-hued hues tangled in profusion.
Drawing in the light, I refined my immortal frame,
Through ten thousand kalpas I remained a child.
Who speaks of life’s end before its time?
Even Fusang is not yet a withered stump.

**The Queen Mother of the West commands her attendant, the Fourth Consort Tian, to respond in song:**
At dawn I ascend the Palace of Great Numinosity,
Drawing in the eightfold royal orchids.
At dusk I enter the Gate of Dark Primordiality,
Plucking blossoms and parting the langgan jades.
My feet tread the Gourd River’s ford,
Where the Weaving Maid stands by the ford’s basin.
Exhaling and inhaling, I embrace the luminous clouds,
Their savor sufficing for a single meal.
How thronged is the Purple Tenuity!
Jasper wheels bear vermilion cinnabar.
At dawn I depart from the Vast Obscurity Mansion,
At dusk I lodge within the Enclosure of the Curved Array.
Our paths diverge, each following its own Dao,
Yet each embodies what brings contentment.
The Two Modes endure as ever—
Why doubt the aeons of the great camphor tree?
Speak not of this to worldly men,
For the walking corpses would find these words hard to bear.

**The Queen Mother presents a song to the Lady Wei:**
I harness my Eightfold Auroral Chariot,
Swiftly entering the Jade Purity.
Dragon skirts sweep the celestial river,
Tiger banners command the vermilion hosts.
Wandering the margins of the Dark Ford,
Ten thousand currents never pause for a moment.
I grieve this parting and reunion,
For when the kalpa ends, heaven and earth collapse.
Only when the Light within Nothingness is exhausted
Does death—and life—cease to be.
Embodying the Dao of spontaneity,
In silent contemplation I merge with the Great Obscurity.
From the Southern Peak rises a true pillar,
Jade radiance gleams with luminous essence.
Free from tasks without term,
An empty heart naturally receives the numinous.
A joyous gathering within the Crimson River—
Together we delight without end.

**The Twin Ritualists pluck the Pearl-Cloud zither and respond in song:**
From the Nine Heavens emerges Jade Purity,
Divine tresses trail beyond the flying auroras.
The Auroral Terrace gleams in towering splendor,
The Numinous Summer luxuriates in lush obscurity.
Fivefold clouds stir with emerald radiance,
Eight winds fan the verdant qi.
Looking up, I chant to dispel demonic influences;
Looking down, I study wisdom and insight.
Ten thousand perfected beings usher in the morning light,
Singing of the meeting in the Crimson Chamber.
A peerless one of virtuous resonance,
Her divine radiance sweeps away all hindrance.
The Heavenly Peak soars through empty branches,
The Terrace’s depths plunge into profound seclusion.
Roaming the sea, I grasp the well’s narrowness;
Treading the real, I sense the world’s defilement.
Dancing wheels feast in layered emptiness—
The fish-trap and fish both naturally fade.
Turn me toward the great camphor’s embrace,
That I may forever bid farewell to the ephemeral world of morning-born creatures.

**The High Immortals gaze upon the "Wandering the Cavern-Spirit" melody:**
The Jade Chamber gleams with eastern auroras,
The purple chariot floats in the crimson dawn.
How dazzling the Flowery Terrace to the eye—
In the northern banquet, flying immortals abound.
Within the Great Void of purity and stillness,
I tread the subtle shifts of light.
Chanting the Great Cavern’s verses,
I sing these twenty-seven stanzas.
The melody rests within the vast desert,
The Spirit King dwells in the inch-square heart.
In the silent chamber, I yearn for the numinous glow—
Why trouble over forests and mountains?
In an instant, the withered elder transforms,
Reverting to the visage of a child.

**Four Perfected Beings descend to the Lady Wei in song:**
Cinnabar brightness illumines the Upper Clarity,
Eight winds stir the great auroras.
I turn my divine auroral chariot,
Thus reaching the jasper slopes of the Jade Ridge.
Beyond heaven and earth in a breath—
The nine circuits are all my home.
Above, I gather the essence of the sun’s heart;
Below, I drink the yellow radiance of the moon.
In the numinous contemplation of emptiness,
The roc’s path knows no gaps or crookedness.
Glancing at you, Lady Wei of virtue,
I see turbid qi harming your harmony.
Diligently cultivate the thoughts of the Dark Within,
And when the Dao is perfected, we shall meet again.

**The Azure Lad’s song:**
Great auroras fan the morning glow,
The ninefold qi assume no fixed form.
Dark reins fly beyond the auroras,
Eightfold auroras ride the High Clarity.
I grasp the Jade Emperor’s mantle,
Bearing me to life within the dawn.
Gazing upon the chambers of the Seven Luminaries,
Bright and clear, yet also dark and deep.
Transcendent is the scion of the Wei clan,
Possessing both heart and feeling.
Peerless, he emerges from the joyous gathering,
His name inscribed in gold on the Eastern Flower.
Lady Wei, what you secretly cultivate—
We shall meet at the Yang Valley’s confluence.

**Next, the Divine King of Fusang’s song:**
At dawn I open the Supreme Emperor’s chamber,
Leaping beyond the Gourd River’s waters.
The azure sea flies with emerald waves,
Linked peaks and crimson peaks stand in array.
The floating wheel rides the cloud-tides,
Nine dragons rise together in harness.
Tiger banners flourish at the auroral ford,
A numinous wind suddenly sets all in order.
Hua Cun has long delighted in the Dao,
Thus attaining the likeness of high spirits.
Uprooted beyond the three bonds,
The meeting of resonance begins anew.
We shall meet at the Yang Luo Palace,
And when the Dao is perfected, I shall bear the scion of Wei away.

**Next, the Perfected of Pure Emptiness’ song:**
Swiftly I rein in the Pure Emptiness,
Lingering in the Western Flowery Mansion.
The jasper grove already reaches the divine treetops,
Tiger banners scatter with the mist.
Wisdom winds shake the cinnabar pennants,
Bright torches illumine the eightfold radiance.
Unfastening my robe within the Yong Chamber,
Divine bells chime with resplendent brilliance.
Dwelling in the light like a forest branch,
I pluck the nine strings within the Dark.
You have bequeathed me the sorrows of past lives,
Releasing a thousand years of sighs.
Joyful gazes know no bounds,
Through the night I await the dawn.

**Its second stanza:**
Purple auroras cherish the Dark Emptiness,
A divine wind without guiding threads.
Suddenly it fills the eight regions,
Praying for your vast stillness.
Eight windows know no constant brightness—
There is obscurity, and there is light.
Contemplating the Three Cinnabar Fields,
In silence, form and radiance arise.
Concentrating the spirit, I encounter the peerless,
Cloud-like bearing, towering and whole.
Ashamed I lack the skill of the Ying craftsman,
For that is but natural brilliance.
Diligently and secretly cultivate the Dao of life,
Lest slackness and leakage weave calamitous qi.
The numinous meeting has its own time—
When we clasp sleeves, we shall ascend together.

**A lament for the mortal world:**
Between heaven and earth,
Meetings are rare and fleeting.
The sun sets beyond the western mountains,
Evening crows return in flight.
A hundred years pass in a moment—
Aspirations and wishes go unfulfilled.
The Heavenly Palace lies but a foot away,
Yet I cannot follow—what sorrow!

**The Ba Yao song:**
Those who attain immortality, like Mao, first succeed,
Riding dragons to ascend into the Great Clarity.
At times they descend to the Dark Continent, sporting on Red City,
Passing through generations, their abundance ever mine.
The Lord Emperor studies this in the twelfth month of the year.

**Shi Anqingxian’s poem:**
The numinous mountain reaches the great auroras,
Steep cliffs pierce the auroral peaks.

Purple mists scatter o’er the sacred land,
Riding the whirlwind, mounted on a white dragon.
With the Four Companions we ascend as one,
To the eastern court of Lord Sanglin.

Though Guangxiu’s years lie far behind,
His mighty spirit still rolls boundless.
In truth, he never yielded the path below,
Yet yielded his years in reverence.

**Zhang Youshi’s poem:**
Northward to the vast desert’s edge,
I come to ascend Penglai’s gates.
Purple clouds frame the numinous palace,
Fragrant incense swirls thick and dense.

How fine is Luo Guangxiu,
Long seated in the seat of Dao-discourse!
Beside the Perfected in rows we gather,
Together beholding the white dragon’s flight.
The rites of the Four are now employed—
When shall we together loosen our sashes?
I cherish the friends who bare their hearts,
Joyful in the radiant morning assembly.

**Xu Yufu’s poem:**
Roaming the wondrous mountain’s peaks,
I rinse and bathe in the azure stream’s purity.
From afar I glimpse Penglai’s realm,
Towering, piercing the mists of heaven.
Five sacred mushrooms clothe the crimson cliffs,
Four terraces gleam with chessboard jade.
Numinous blossoms scatter in profusion,
Their brilliance illuminating the divine court.
At ease beyond the Seven Awakenings,
I freely embrace the celestial life.
Content within my own heart’s square inch,
Why need the white dragon’s glory?

**Ding Weining’s poem:**
The dark mountain frames the azure waves,
Golden chambers mirror the numinous halls.
Lord Luo stands peerless in lofty aspiration,
At ease in the space between being and non-being.
His form sinks into the northern frigid vault,
Yet his three spirits commune with the Nine Heavens.
Our colleagues follow one another forth,
Exalting me for my advanced years.
In youth, Shi Qing’an
Refused to honor the worthy and esteemed.
He mocked the Lord of Penglai,
Calling Guangxiu to the fore.
O illustrious one, what will you do
To rebuff this young prodigy?

**King Fuchai of Wu’s inscription:**
Dark currents flow with crimson waves,
Kun jade gleams upon Langya’s peaks.
The morning sun reins in dawn’s radiance,
How graceful and winding its splendor!
Wandering clouds descend upon the sun,
The whirlwind’s light soars through the Three Heavens.
The Numinous Treasure illumines the Nine Voids,
Yin and yang gather between the Zhong Mountains.
Yu the Great ascended the Eight Windows,
Dispersing his qi to resound through golden orchids.
Following the branches, he shook the jade boughs,
Tracing the waves, he sought the flood’s source.
Supporting the essence, he established the numinous trunk,
Hanging leaves to weave its abundance.
Vast and distant are the dragon and phoenix’s traces,
Their brilliance adorning the Nine Heavens’ script.
I lift my gaze to the Three Luminaries’ essence,
Preserving my body to seek eternal peace.
Bending down, I rinse with the Five Flowers’ elixir,
Restoring my youthful countenance.
Soaring through the Palace of Warmth and Coolness,
How could I know heat or cold?
A thousand autumns are like a clear dawn,
Ten thousand years are but half a day.
Beating my wings, I ascend through the void,
Beckoning me to the Numinous Treasure’s halls.
I burn the reins of the Five Emperors’ chariots,
Together we meet at the edge of the luminous desert.
We ask one another of hunger and thirst—
The dark springs overflow with flowing cinnabar.
Seeking immortality lies within the heart’s square inch,
The Eight Distances hold no ease or difficulty.
Yet I hear the stench of the vermilion gates,
And the perils that lie upon the road.
I carve my inscription in the shade of the cliffs,
Where caves and gorges may be searched for traces.

**Xin Xuanzi’s poem:**
Long ago I entered the nether realm,
Answering the numinous summons in due course.
My spirit dispersed into emptiness,
My qi dissolved into the auspicious clouds.
This form is no lustrous jade—
What master craftsman could carve it?
With cloven hooves I chant in secluded song,
With raised hands I play the singing branches.
In the forest chamber, joy unbounded,
Cutting off all ties beyond this pavilion.
I leave my light to follow the round luminaries,
Yet how desolate the fine music sounds!

**Second poem:**
Silent communion stirs deep feeling,
The dark qi gathers and moves the sound.
Though the lofty wheels vary in height,
From ten thousand fathoms they still come to seek.
O refined scholar of the Dao,
In spirit you harmonize with the numinous heart.
Yielding to the world’s ceaseless transformations,
Your mind clings to the secluded grove.
Together we plan an excursion beyond the ordinary,
Joining in stillness upon the eastern peak.

**Third poem:**
I command my chariot to the vast Feng’e,
My carefree traces wander the nether realm.
In emptiness there are indeed things,
Yet in being there is also impermanence.
In enlightenment, the boundary of being and non-being,
Together we meet at the Hao Bridge.
At a glance, the dark understanding is clear—
The principles of ghosts and spirits are self-forgotten.

**Song of the Left Lady of the Great Tenuity’s Pure Void:**
Lush and dense, yet not the true abode,
The Great Origin is my dwelling.
How could the Dark Lord ever decay?
Only the solitary find this hard to bear.
The falling phoenix reins in the purple mist,
Its proud bridle ascends the morning peaks.
Silent, without bound or shore,
Radiant, an empty vision in the void.
Hidden mushrooms flourish on Phoenix Hill,
As I linger by the jasper grove’s edge.
The dragon’s embryo enfolds your form,
Eight jades revolve in the pristine dawn.
The languorous blossoms of the jade palace,
Their clustered petals towering over the cliffs’ brilliance.
The roc’s fan spans a hundred million peaks,
Its wings beating to support the sky’s flight.
In the western court, I command a long song,
The cloud zither cast aside, unstrummed.
The Eight Winds entwine the emerald palace,
The clustered mists suddenly disperse.
The numinous youth hurls flowing gold,
A spark of fire ignites the departing case.
The Three Primes bow in dance,
The Purple Emperor waves his sleeves in praise.
Bright and clear, the radiance of the fan’s light,
Resplendent, the Long Star’s brilliance.
My chariot soars, its gleaming blades aloft,
As I glance down, moved to sorrow.
I pity the earthbound immortals—
Why do they dwell in the forest streams?

**Song of the Numinous Phoenix:**
Dim, dim the numinous phoenix,
Endlessly it returns afar.
Long, long my yearning,
Forever at odds with my wishes.
Through ten thousand kalpas, no appointed time—
When will it come in flight?

Then the phoenix slain by the king
Burst forth in lush growth,
Embracing its daughter, they flew as one,
Straight into the clouds they departed.

**Zhang Liying the Female Immortal’s Stone Drum Song:**
Stone drum, O stone drum,
How sorrowful the world below!
Since I came to behold it,
The lives of mortals are truly bitter.
Alas for the affairs of the world,
Endless my thoughts.
My thoughts cannot be humiliated,
Nor the king’s might seize them.
My will holds the luan and the phoenix,
I sing and dance for myself,
Soaring through the clouds, traversing the Han,
Far beyond the dust and snares.
O children of the world,
What can you do to me?
A brief meeting, then parting as fate decrees—
Father, O mother,
How deeply you grieve my heart!

**Song of the Han Child’s Rhyme:**
Donning a blue skirt, she enters the Heavenly Gate,
Bows to the Golden Mother, pays homage to the Wood Lord.
None of the people of the time knew her,
Only Zhang Zifang recognized her and went to bow.
He said: “This is the Jade Youth of the Eastern King Father.”
It speaks of immortals who attain the Dao and ascend to heaven,
Who must bow to the Golden Mother and pay homage to the Wood Lord.
None but those who ascend through emptiness and attain perfection
Know the ford to this realm.

**E Lühua’s Poem Presented to Yang Quan:**
The divine peaks rise to cleave the clouds,
Soaring peaks stand a thousand fathoms tall.
The numinous valley lies desolate and vast,
The jasper grove lush and dense.
Yang, your beauty and elegance shine,
In youth your pure voice flows.
You nest your heart in Zhuangzi and Hui Shi’s ford,
Transcending form in Wei’s forest.
Your radiance gleams within the vermilion gates,
Within and without, you surpass the common heart.

**Second Poem:**
Our bond with you, Master, runs deep—
from the same pool our lineages spring.
Yet the great ancestral enterprise
has branched apart by now.
Like gold and orchid bound by love,
the Three Friendships grow ever clearer.

**Third Poem:**
In quiet seeking, this meeting brings joy,
our refined threads woven through the years.
Who says the hidden mirror is hard to find?
It lies within the square inch of the heart.
Beyond the cage, we yearn to soar,
both to become mountain recluses.
Let not your wings rise too high on the void,
lest the startled wind sweep you away.
Transformation depends on man,
yet the fenced sheep cannot be compared.
What I seek is no fleeting bloom—
in you, my hope endures till life’s close.

**Poem Presented by Lady An of Jiuhua to Yang Siming:**
Cloud-palaced towers pierce the empty sky,
jasper terraces rise in layered splendor.
The Purple Palace rides the green radiance,
the numinous halls stand lofty and grand.
Within the vermilion chambers of jade portals,
supreme virtue shines like crimson mist.
Below, I rinse my mouth with the sacred flask’s stream;
above, I pluck the azure *bi* blossoms.
I bathe my feet in the Jade Celestial Pool,
and strike the stalks by the River of the Herd Boy.
Then I urge my cloud-chariot on,
letting the dragon reins fall to the dark slope.
I shake my robes at the dust’s edge,
lifting my skirts to tread the turbid waves.
Would that we bind ourselves to mountain and marsh,
hard and soft in perfect harmony.
Hand in hand within the realm of dual purity,
the perfected Way strays not from truth.
In the Purple Tenuity, we meet in wise counsel,
our songs and offerings bring boundless fortune.

**Second Poem:**
Swiftly I depart from the Western Flower,
between the waiting and the unwaiting.
Now I glance at the Five Peaks,
now I bathe in the Celestial River’s ford.
I release the wheel to seek the empty boat—
wherever I go, all is bound in tenderness.
A mustard seed holds ten thousand acres,
within it, Mount Kunlun stands.
Great and small are not truly different,
near and far share the same cause.
They come as those who wait,
I come as one who needs no waiting.

**Poem by the Lady of the Central Watchpost, Wang:**
Dragon banners dance in the Great Void,
flying wheels trace the Five Peaks’ slopes.
Wherever I go, all is carefree—
inspired, I sing dark and mysterious songs.
The unwaiting explains the waiting,
and so we meet in harmony.
Why speak of the Canglang’s vastness?
The Dark Well is not too much.
In the space of a single step, all is gathered—
the Four Seas’ net embraces all.
How can it compare to beyond the radiant?
Only once in three kalpas does it pass.

**Second Poem:**
The Eight Paths meet where no origin is,
riding fate to survey the clamor.
Amid the floating dust’s midst,
I loosen my collar to join the Daoist family.
A glance at the mist—suddenly it clears,
and I lead the perfected to the numinous slope.
The empty radiance coils through jasper portals,
the dark harmony sings the phoenix’s song.
The path is free of ruts or hindrance,
the divine music dances on cloud-waves.
Equal in virtue with the jade radiance,
why need the world’s excess?

**Third Poem:**
Simply observe the celestial truth,
cast off burdens and let passions flow.
In stillness, the four steeds of mechanism cease;
in revering being, one preserves life.
How can one find the equalizer of things,
to entrust fate to its course?

**Fourth Poem:**
Mounting the chariot, I depart from the Eastern Flower,
the whirlwind fans the Great Mystery.
Flying reins soar ninety thousand *li*,
the eight directions are already leveled.
A fleeting glance at the mountains and waters,
in the depths of the numinous peaks.
Of one wind, the qi naturally aligns;
where the Dao unites, principle is the same.
Seeking the dragon’s fungus for distant years,
inward vision gathers the celestial truth.
The Eastern Summit may long remain still—
why be entangled by things?

**Poem by Lady Li of Fangzhang’s Luminous One:**
Cloud ramparts gird the celestial gates,
the Seven Qi shine with divine might.
Jasper doors open at dawn’s cry,
the Nine Harmonies resound in the crimson pivot.
Purple mist and vermilion gates,
fragrant smoke rises from green windows.
Four chariots dance with tiger banners,
blue carriages wheel through the dark void.
Canopies follow the clouds’ ranks,
phoenixes descend to rein in six dragons.
Urging my radiance along the Five Peaks’ slopes,
the Three Purities gaze upon your chamber.
Suddenly I sense the foul and restless qi,
a thousand impurities defile my breast.
Fetid things taint the spirit,
clamorous dust clashes in turmoil.
Bright jade all gleams resplendent—
why should my body alone bear such weight?
Too late I raise my hands in regret,
sitting on the earth, worms breed within.

**Second Poem:**
I drink deeply, observing the crowd’s wisdom,
swiftly draining the four directions’ bounds.
Unknowing of how it came to be,
truly, this is no journey of waiting.
All encounters bring joy,
no meeting brings sorrow.
Our forms drift in the dark void,
two gatherings naturally paired.

**Third Poem:**
Flying wheels ascend the morning terrace,
reining in the dark mound’s edge.
Hand in hand with the Purple Emperor’s robe,
suddenly the Eight Winds drive me on.
Jade splendor wings the green curtains,
blue skirts fan the emerald hem.
Crowns gleam on towering peaks,
girdles tinkle with moon-pearls.
Lightly I enter the wind and dust,
blocking my nose to escape what must be cast off.
Foul stench withers my qi,
the hundred ills trouble my heart’s root.
Why not rise on the whirlwind,
treading the Great Void with a sigh?

**Poem Presented by the Lady of the Southern Culmen to Yang Xi:**
Reining the whirlwind, I fan the Great Void,
the Eight Radiant Ones fly in lofty purity.
Above, I float beyond the Purple Dawn;
below, I gaze upon the distant fall of the Milky Way.
The dark heart dwells in the space between,
above and below, no drifting or pause.
Between the two bounds of waiting and unwaiting,
the waiting has nothing to seek.
Embodying nonbeing, one may die;
embodying being, one preserves life.
The Eastern Guest joins the high song—
what need to dispute the two modes of waiting?

**Poem Presented by the Lady of the Southern Culmen to Yang Xi (continued):**

I command the jade-brocade wheels, reins dancing as I gaze in lingering loops.
At dawn I wander the Vermilion Fire Palace,
at dusk I feast by the Radiant Night Pool.
Floating light grazes the tips of rosy clouds,
eight dragons arrayed in uneven ranks.
I roam as one unbound by waiting,
yet the bound follow close behind.
In the high assembly, fair ones slumber—
the two modes of waiting vie in right and wrong.
Being and nonbeing lack fixed decree;
each mode of waiting returns to its own.
*(III)*

The forest stirs at the brush of a beard,
clouds thicken awaiting the dragon’s song.
Mysterious numbers seek one another,
every touch of rhythm yields its own sound.
The flying chariot emerges from Western Splendor,
reins gathered in sudden pursuit.
Though the Eight Distances offer no lack of joy,
we chant in unison, admiring the principle itself.
Yet mourning this realm within the Four Bounds,
a hundred sorrows weigh ever on my heart.
Together we roam the Northern Frigid Terrace,
where the divine wind unfastens your robe.

---

**Poem by the Lady of the Purple Tenuity:**
I ride the whirlwind to welcome the Nine Heavens,
resting my chariot at the Three-Flower Ridge.
Those who wait may linger and gaze,
those who do not wait remain steadfastly still.
Why toil over the vast blue-green waves—
how could it compare to leaping the Dark Well?

*She chants again:*
The Tortoise Gate looms towering,
the Terrace of Walls cradles falling moon-pearls.
Seated in ranks within the Nine Numinous Chambers,
we strike the jade chimes and chant the Great Void.
Jade flutes harmonize with my spirit,
golden nectar dissolves my cares.

*She chants again:*
Feasting deep in Eastern Splendor,
a thousand hundred melodies array the tuning-weights.
The Azure Lord summons me to rise,
bowing low to seek the Forest Court.
Feathered robes fan emerald radiance,
jade pendants chime in resonant clarity.
Together we point toward the High Dawn Palace,
pledging to meet in the image of the Dark.

*She recounts her journey to the Dark Mound, chanting:*
I soar beyond the crimson dawn,
the flying whirlwind bears me to the Northern Mound.
Divine splendor illumines the Immortal Terrace,
round luminaries tilt with the wind.
I unfold the radiance to embrace the Cinnabar Prime,
the gate of light feeds on moon-essence.
Intertwined beneath the cloud-forest canopy,
my vast carriage returns to childhood’s bloom.
How fleeting this dwelling in the formless—
how could right and wrong ever be contrived?
The world’s net entangles itself in strife—
how can one speak of nurturing life?

---

*On the sixth day of the ninth month, at dusk, the Cloud Forest descends once more, commanding Yang to take up his brush and compose:*
I unyoke my wheels above the great rosy clouds,
gather my reins to reach the Purple Mound.
In hand I grasp the qi of the Eight Heavens,
casting my body to float in empty space.
One glance surveys the web of creation,
a second gaze seeks the highest bounds.
The essentials of the Dao are already thus—
they can unravel a thousand sorrows.
Seeking truth, I have found a true friend—
what more could I ask?

*Chanting this, she bids it be shown to Director Xu Mu and Xi Fanghui. She chants again:*
The purple void gleams with dark radiance,
the Dark Palace girdled by the Crimson River.
In solemn ranks the Upper Clarity chambers,
the Numinous Terrace shines in towering splendor.
Eight chariots arrive at the Vermilion Pool,
feathered canopies tilt toward the branches of dawn.
The thunderous wind circles the Three Mornings,
golden bells scatter jade blossoms.
Seven reins descend the Nine Depths—
feasting and gazing need no home.
I ask the seeker of the Dao:
why linger in the dusty waves?
Could you not perch on Eastern Splendor,
cultivating truth to gather the Great Harmony?

*She also commands it be shown to Xu and Xi. On the eighteenth day of the tenth month, descending once more with the assembly, she commands Yang to write:*
In my left hand I grasp the Jade-Flower Canopy,
flying light treading the Seven Primes.
The Three Mornings blaze with purple radiance,
my refining gaze caresses the Luminous Perfected.
In a moment of leaping transformation,
all four directions become divine.
The numinous hair knows no bounds—
diligently ponder the texts of Upper Clarity.
Why tarry on the crossroads,
letting your focus drift and stray?
Yin’s infirmities lose the dark mechanism,
unaware as the years and months divide.

*She addresses Yang:*
Those who are diligent must diligently attend to their task, approaching its dark subtleties. The cautious, too, act in accord with their kind. The difficulty of studying the Dao cannot be put into words. Those who feel shame at the vulgar are still far from the Way—only after thorough cultivation can one be deemed worthy. The worthy lift their eyes to begin anew. For now, you must inwardly forget.

*She chants:*
Gazing into the dark and distant clarity,
the setting light emerges from the eastern stillness.
Would that I might find a friend beyond the dust,
whose rustling presence shuns worldly contrivance.

*Chanting this again and again, she continues:*
The numinous person hides on the Dark Peak,
the perfected one conceals himself in the clouds.
The dark chant is not without its season,
the wondrous response has its own waiting.
Who could have foreseen the emptiness and silence—
the ultimate melody abides in constancy.
Hand in hand we ascend the Feathered Palace,
feasting together within the Vast Cold.
I ask: who are your companions?
Only the Jade Maidens remain.

*Chanting complete, she says:*
The soaring steed of empty clouds
spreads its wings above the Hollow Peak.
Such a one—how could he not long draw from the southern face,
forsaking the thousand chariots?

---

*On the thirtieth day of the second month, she chants a verse:*
Gathering my robes to ford the Green River,
I meet the Lord of Fusang.
In high assembly at the Great Forest Wilderness,
we feast and admire the Dark Flower Palace.
If your faith in the Dao is pure and steadfast,
why not dwell on Eastern Peak?

---

*On the fourteenth day of the fourth month, she composes seven verses:*

**I**
I rein in the light to first cross the ford,
the flying whirlwind ascends Upper Clarity.
The Cloud Terrace rises in towering splendor,
the Gate of Heaven gleams with jade walls.
The morning wind stirs the cinnabar clouds,
crimson mist scatters across the golden court.
Green leaves gather on the Dark Peak,
purple mushrooms sprout beneath the crags.
Auspicious clouds coil around the cinnabar furnace,
refined jade scatters eightfold jasper.
Feasting and gazing in the Vast Cold Palace,
ten thousand plants renew youth’s bloom.
Dragon banners unfurl numinous lightning,
tiger banners summon the vermilion troops.
The exalted perfected turn the Nine Luminaries,
the cavernous gaze equalizes the hidden and bright.
Who can tread the secluded path,
seeking my boundless years?

**II**
Misty haze veils the Purple Tenuity Lodge,
the Terrace of Light disperses the whirlwind’s radiance.
Phoenix songs echo amid the flowered canopies,
phoenix hooks lead the dragon’s court.
Eight wolves bear the crimson banners,
white tigers blow the horn-flutes.
Clouds surge to depict the numinous palace,
coming to rest amid the world’s clamor.
I unyoke my reins at the fair ones’ abode,
kindred spirits naturally summon one another.
Seeking the lineage takes but a moment—
ten thousand years are but a single dawn.
The plant’s lifespan meets its decline,
how could the passing kalpas be deemed distant?
The true gaze one another—
let not your heart be plundered.
The empty blade swings toward the ultimate void,
the vulgar stagnation saddens the Five Spirits.

**III**
At dawn I open the eastern morning’s radiance,
the flying chariot crosses the vast blue-green.
Mountain waves shake the azure shores,
the Eight Winds fan the dark mist.
The winding paths shift to the changing chambers,
cherishing the truth moves the perfected.
Three golds may roam the tray—
Eastern Summit is fit for eternal refinement.
Amid the tumult on the road,
who can tread the ford of life?

**IV**
Swaying across the Eight Rosy Ridges,
lingering beneath the flying morning canopy.
The purple chariot soars through the Great Void,
gazing and laughing beyond the Nine Voids.
Jade flutes stir the radiant clouds,
the numinous mist severs the deep haze.

**V**
The lofty immortals feast with the Supreme Perity,
their pure songs stretch beyond all bounds.
Coming and going through the courts of mountains and peaks—
why should there be any waiting or encounter?

**VI**
Divine jade gleams at the numinous ford,
the Seven Primes illumine the spirit’s gate.
Empty shifts dwell within the square inch,
a single leap ascends to the Great Tenuity.
Exquisite tones ride the harmonious chant,
the grand assembly too has its mechanism.
Equal this gaze of heaven and man,
in concert with the soaring morning radiance.
Reining the six directions beyond the cosmos—
how could there be tilt or peril?

**VII**
The fleeting feast lingers on the Dust-Gale Ridge,
transformation and decline trace the cycle of return.
Who knows the span of the kalpa’s turning?
A glance back stirs human sorrow.

**VIII**
Cloud-herbs shade the dark quadrant,
gazing up, one feels the revolving luminous essence.
Lush and thriving, the flourishing sprouts—
he who bears double virtue must surely prosper.
The hymns of the perfected ones now conclude.
