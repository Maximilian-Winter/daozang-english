**Ritual for Establishing the Altar of the Celestial Heart Orthodox Dharma for Cultivating the Dao**

The ritual proceeds according to form.
The *Dujang* leads all in paying homage to the masters and maintaining mindfulness as prescribed.

The *Gaogong* intones the **Guardian Spirits Incantations of the Five Directions**:

**East**
Ninefold *qi* of the Azure Heavens, Radiant Star Great Spirit.
Shining upon the eastern quarter, illuminating the nine gates.
Revolving the candle of yang light, sweeping away defilement and baleful *qi*.
The Luminous Youth attends, guarding my chamber.
Seizing demons and binding malevolence, I present myself before the Imperial Lord.
Upholding the divine orthodox Dao, the vermilion script of jade.
The talismanic command of the Nine Heavens, borne by dragon couriers.
May all under heaven be pacified; may your servant ascend as an immortal.

**South**
Cinnabar Heavens of the South, threefold *qi* flowing in radiance.
The Fire Star revolves its flame, penetrating the Great Yang.
Above abides the Vermilion Essence, the Luminous Numinous Youth.
Commanding the hosts of fire, guarding the Three Palaces.
Severing evil and restraining malevolence, shearing the demon kings.
As the Northern Emperor decrees, the eight winds and fires surge.
Interlocking bells blaze forth—who dares disobey?
May the orthodox Dao prevail; may I receive supreme merit.
Preserving heaven’s enduring existence, for kalpas without end.

**West**
Heavens of the sevenfold *qi*, the Great White streaming in essence.
Light gleams at the Golden Gate, illuminating the Great Darkness.
Within resides the Pale Sovereign, styled the Imperial Spirit.
Preserving the divine and pacifying all, guarding my bodily form.
Cutting off the roots of evil, the jade Dao shines in rectitude.
Palaces are arrayed in order, the Three Luminaries aligned.
Harmonized with the natural Dao, I ascend to the Purple Court.
The talismanic command of the Numinous Treasure, universally benefiting all beings.
Merit extends to all; heaven and earth are at peace.

**North**
Mysterious Heavens of the North, fivefold *qi* circling in eddies.
The Chronogram Star blazes, its light suffusing the Great Subtlety.
Black Numinous Venerable Spirit, immortal in feathered robes.
Guarding the five gates, inspecting essences and seizing the false.
Who dares test me? The *huoluo* blade severs and shatters.
As the jade talisman proclaims, the spirits manifest eightfold might.
The gates of evil are sealed; the orthodox Dao shines forth.
Illuminating your servant’s body, the Three Lights unite in splendor.
I spur the void and ride the floating clouds, my form ascending as an immortal.

**Center**
The Yellow Center governs *qi*, unifying the primordial true.
The Star of Stability emits its radiance, streaming through the Nine Heavens.
Twelve Luminous Youths attend, primordial *qi* and yang essence.
Flaming upward in crimson smoke, penetrating all under heaven and my own body.
A hundred evils are cast down; ten thousand ghosts are subdued.
The incantation of the Central Mountain universally prevails.
The Five Spirits pacify all; my body ascends as an immortal.

Next, the *Dujang* leads the chanting of the **Twenty-Four Strikes of the Dharma Drum**.

Next, the *Gaogong* Master kindles the incense burner:

**Supreme Three Heavens, Mysterious Primordial Origin, Threefold *Qi* of the Most High Lord Lao**, summon forth from within my body the **Three and Five Merit Officers**, the **Left and Right Attendant Envoys**, the **Left and Right Dragon Couriers Bearing Incense**, the **Golden Youth Attending Incense**, the **Jade Maiden Scattering Flowers**, the **Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans**, and the **Direct-Day Incense Officials**, each thirty-six in number, to emerge.
Let those who emerge be arrayed in solemn attire, and let the local earth gods of this domain be summoned.
I now reverently burn incense on behalf of [Name], at [Location], for the purpose of [Matter], establishing the [Name] Retreat for [Number] days and nights.
Upon its conclusion, a pure offering of [Number] altars shall be arranged.
Thus, I universally proclaim to the Ten Directions and ally with the Three Realms,
to beseech blessings, repent transgressions, invite fortune, and avert calamity,
to protect the clan and secure the household, to prolong life and augment destiny.
May it be so—

May the **Primordial Qi of the Ten Directions’ True and Upright Ones** descend and flow into our bodies, that our prayers may swiftly ascend and directly reach the presence of the **Utmost True, Boundless, and Great Dao’s August Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven**.

Next, let the **High Merit Master** and the assembly of officials kneel in reverence.
Next, let the **High Merit Master** emerge to receive the scriptures, registers, and assume office.

We now reverently summon the **True Officials of the Five Agents** and the **Merit Clerk Officers** from within our bodies to ascend to the **Three Heavens Above**, where they shall execute the law, open the **Yin-Yang Merit Clerks**, deliver the Dao, dispel calamities, disperse misfortune, and resolve adversities.

Let those who emerge be arrayed in solemn attire and dignified vestments, their caps and sashes adorned with pendants, their **dignity and presence** impeccably ordered.
Let them don the **crimson yang headbands**, wear the **crowns that reach to heaven**, clothe themselves in **black silk unlined robes**, and gird themselves with **swords bearing dragon-head hilts**.
Let the **Envoys Bearing Memorial Tablets** don the **dark yin headbands**, wear the **crowns of the Nine Virtues**, clothe themselves in **crimson ceremonial unlined robes**, and gird themselves with **tiger tallies**, each holding **jade tablets**.

Let the **Upper Bureau Envoys** gaze afar toward the heavens above.
Let the **Middle Bureau Envoys** survey the eight directions.
Let the **Chief Official Envoys** encircle our bodies with offerings.
Let the **Tiger-Warrior Gentleman Clerks** inspect for treachery.
Let the **Hook-Riding Chief Officials and Archers**, the **Celestial Ding Warriors**, and the **Rectifying Forces** maintain order.
Let the **Rectifying Clerks** gather the spirits.
Let the **Spirit-Consuming Clerks** gather the ghosts.

Let the **Post Station Clerks** prepare the **relay horses**.
Let the **Petition-Presenting Clerks**, the **Flying Dragon Mounted Clerks**, and the others assemble around us—front and back, left and right.

Let them receive our words and, in turn, report and summon the **True Officials** and **Orthodox Spirits** of this domain’s local earth gods.
Let the **Orthodox Spirits** oversee and examine, and let the **Left and Right Capital Lords of Equity** be summoned.

As ordained by the **Celestial Master**, let the **Twenty-Eight Treatments**, the **Thirty-Six Quiet Abodes**, the **Seventy-Two Blessed Lands**, and the **Three Hundred Sixty Named Mountains** be established.

Let the **Eastern Yi**, the **Southern Man**, the **Western Rong**, the **Northern Di**, the **Central Three Peaceful Ones**, the **Five Elder Spirit Lords**, the **Spiritual Officials and Generals of Mountains, Rivers, Streams, and Valleys**, together in sincerity, join in this supplication:

To the **Void and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Venerable of the Origin**, the **Boundless Great Dao’s Supreme Dao Lord**, the **Supreme Lord Lao**, the **August Thearch of Upper Virtue**, the **Supreme Heavenly Thearch Who Grasps the Talisman, Presides Over the Calendar, and Embodies the Dao**, the **Utmost Revered Jade Thearch of the Vast Heaven**, the **Holy Ancestor, Upper Spirit, and High Dao’s Nine Heavens Life-Protecting Heavenly Venerable Great Thearch**, the **Purple Tenuity Heavenly Thearch**, the **Purple Tenuity Northern Culmen Great Thearch**, the **Earth Queen of the Great Sublime Who Upholds Heaven, Effects the Law, and Embodies Profound Virtue**, the **Thirty-Two Heavenly Thearchs**, the **Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numen, and Northern Perfected’s Jade Capital and Golden Pass of the Seven Jeweled Jasper Terrace’s Purple Tenuity Upper Palace**, the **Numinous Treasure’s Utmost True and Radiant August Dao Lord**, the **Three Thearchs and Five Emperors**, the **Eleven Luminaries Star Lords**, the **Southern Asterism and Northern Dipper Venerable Stars**, the **Three Officials of Heaven, Earth, and Water**, the **Twenty-Eight Constellations Star Lords**, the **Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterium**, the **Three Heavens Great Dharma Masters**, the **Heavenly Pivot Institute’s Duke**, the **Northern Culmen Demon-Dispelling Institute’s Assembly of Sages**, the **Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure**, the **Four Sage Perfected Lords**, the **Heavenly Bureaus’ Four Offices**, the **Five Marchmount Thearchs**, the **Retreat’s Patron**, the **Dharma Master**, the **Star Lords of the Constellations of Life**, the **True Officials of the Original Destiny and Celestial Stem**, the **Venerable Spirits of the Year’s Virtue**, all the **True Immortals**, and the **Officials of the Three Realms**—

We, by virtue of karmic causes from past lives, have presumptuously undertaken the practice of the Dharma teachings. On this day of covenant and alliance, we pledge to uphold and maintain our vows.

We reverently uphold the true Dao and honor the Dharma assemblies. Awaiting the most earnest oversight of the divine monitors, we beseech the granting of extraordinary grace in deliverance. Humbly we pray that luminous blessings be bestowed and sacred favor be abundantly conferred. May we be freed from the entanglements of the mundane realm, that the Dao and qi may fill us to overflowing. May boundless beneficence be extended, and malevolent forces be banished beyond all reckoning. We await only the sagely decree, humbly receiving our earnest supplications.

Your servant [Name], with utmost reverence and awe, prostrates in deepest urgency, respectfully presenting this entreaty.

Next, the *Dujang* leads the chanting, each declaring their Dharma rank. The Dao assembly silently recites their received scriptures and registers of office.

We, the High Merit Dharma Masters and recipients of the scriptures and registers, your servants [Names], together with utmost sincerity, respectfully address:

The Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneous Nativity, the Limitless Great Dao Most High Lord of the Dao, the Most High Lord Lao, the August Emperor of Supreme Virtue of the Primal Origin, the Heavenly Jade Thearch of the Vast Sky Who Upholds the Talisman, Governs the Calendar, and Embodies the True Dao; the Sacred Ancestor, Supreme Numinous High Dao, Nine Heavens Controller of Destiny, Celestial Worthy Great Emperor Who Preserves Life; the Great Emperor of the Purple Tenuity Heavenly Thearch; the Great Emperor of the Northern Culmen of the Purple Tenuity; the August Queen of Earth, Divine Thearch of the Primordial Sky, Great Sage of the Posterity of Heaven Who Responds to the Dao, Embodying Profound Virtue and Radiant Magnanimity; the Sun, Moon, and Stellar Lodges; the Four Offices of Heaven and Earth; the Imperial Throne within the Dipper; the Three Treasuries and Three Officials; the Sacred Assembly of the Heavenly Pivot Institute and the Northern Culmen Demon-Dispelling Institute; the Perfected Immortals of the Wondrous Register of the Northern Thearch and the Dharma Records of the Central Truth; the Divine Immortals of the Five Marchmounts, Four Waterways, Grotto-Heavens, and Blessed Lands; the Divine Immortals of the Three Realms; and the Host of Sages of the Ten Directions.

We have heard that the generation of Heaven and Earth began before the inception of images and thearchs. Without trace or sound, it merged with the subtlety of the formless and inaudible.

All beings are governed by the numinous, and the Great Dao is their ultimate source. It unfurls its boundless compassion to succor all things and manifests the sublime Dharma of supplication. This humble disciple of the Most High, with reverent devotion and earnest intent, prostrates himself for the sake of his humble form. He solemnly arranges the sacred banners and prepares the jade altar with due rites. He invokes the turning of the Wheel and the arrival of the divine chariot, praying that the celestial sojourn to the Golden Towers may be turned toward this place. With trepidation in his heart, he awaits the abundant blessings to come. Gazing upward toward the Purple Vault, he reverently awaits the radiant imperial carriage. May the divine presence deign to descend and partake of the purified offerings.

This minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost urgency and devotion, bow twice in earnest supplication.

Next, the Daoist priests recite the divine names to invoke the saints.
Next, incense is offered.
Tea is presented.
Wine is offered.
Next, the officiant sounds the chime and performs the initial offering, circumambulating the altar.
Next, the officiant sounds the chime and chants the *Step-in-Emptiness Verses*:
Bowing to the Most High, burning incense to return to the Void.
Luminous radiance follows me as I turn; the Dharma Wheel completes three cycles.
Mysterious vows arise in the Four Directions; numinous blessings extend to kings and lords.
Seven generations of ancestors ascend to Heaven’s halls, resplendent in glorious light.
Whistling and singing, I contemplate the Great Expanse; celestial music delights my spirit.
In unison, we offer fragrant homage to the supreme virtue; even the lower immortals cannot compare.
Wondrous forms illumine primordial awakening; in serried ranks, they traverse the Void.

Next, the chief cantor intones the names and titles of the deities.
The assembly silently recites the scriptures, registers, and official duties they have received.

This humble servant, the High Ritual Master who has received the scriptures, registers, and Dharma ranks, along with the disciples of the Most High, jointly and sincerely address the following:
The Three Clarities and Supreme Saints, the Four August Thearchs and Lofty Perfected, the Lord of the Golden Towers, the Prime Minister of the Pure Capital, the stellar lodges of the Vault of Heaven, the divine immortals of the Vast Earth, the numinous powers of the Three Realms, and the host of sages of the Ten Directions.

We have heard that all who bear the heavens upon their heads and tread upon the earth are nurtured by the generative power of the Great Dao. They partake of virtue and drink of harmony, for all are shaped by the creative work of the myriad spirits. Every being within the bounds of the world enjoys the beneficent care of the Dao. Yet, being ignorant and unknowing, how can we ever repay such boundless grace?

This disciple of the Most High declares: By the merit of past lives, I have sheltered beneath the Dao’s shade and glimpsed its written precepts. I aspire to enter the Gate of Purity and vow to receive the office of Primordial Perfection. Grateful for the favor of your compassionate regard, I deepen my reverence and devotion. Therefore, for such-and-such a matter at such-and-such a place, I strictly adhere to the ritual protocols and widely initiate the offering of incense and cultivation. I establish the altar and reverently invoke the true ranks of the deities, hoping that your blessings may flow abundantly and that lasting peace and security may be preserved.

We humbly pray that the Supreme Saints may turn their radiant light toward us and that the divine immortals may deign to witness our sincerity. May your swift chariots briefly descend to observe the purity of our hearts. We are filled with earnest entreaty and steadfast in our devotion. The words of this disciple of the Most High are now respectfully presented.

Next, the Orthodox Unity Dharma Master ascends to recite the petition.
The words of the disciple of the Most High have been respectfully submitted; we await your gracious reception and favorable response. May you bestow your boundless compassion and grant us immeasurable blessings.

We have heard that the Three Clarities roam in mystery, and the myriad saints are revered in their loftiness. They cannot be sought through sight or sound, nor can they be described in words. Today, this disciple of the Most High reverently serves the Supreme Heaven and takes refuge in the Great Dao. He embodies the esoteric teachings of the true canon and cultivates himself according to the profound Dharma. Yet, fearing the transgressions of past lives may incur hidden retribution, he now strictly adheres to the ritual protocols and grandly inaugurates this offering. He welcomes the lofty perfected of the Three Realms and invites the august saints of the Nine Heavens. With reverence, he presents purified offerings, hoping for the descent of the divine immortals.

We humbly pray that the mind of the Dao may remain pure and undivided, and that worldly entanglements may dissolve. May this ephemeral body be preserved, and the teachings of self-cultivation be fulfilled. Thereafter, may we attain longevity and enduring vision, completing our practice and perfecting our merit. May the grace extend to both the living and the deceased, and may blessings forever secure the protection of our masters.

This minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost urgency and devotion, bow twice in earnest supplication.

Next, incense is offered.
Wine is presented.
Next, the officiant sounds the chime and performs the secondary offering.
Next, the officiant sounds the chime and intones the *Hymn of the Great Immortal Learners*:
To learn immortality is to renounce worldly splendor; each thought accumulates upon the last.
Coming and going disturb my spirit; its restlessness prevents attainment.
Extinguishing thoughts, I rest in tranquil emptiness; in solitude, I enter profound stillness.
I seek the scriptures as if parched with thirst, holding fast to my resolve like unyielding metal or stone.
May you safeguard the path to immortality for your disciple; may the Five Numinous Ones transmit the registers of transcendence.

This minister respectfully and earnestly addresses the following:
The Imperial Throne of the Northern Culmen, the August Lords of the Sun and Moon, the venerable stars of the Five Planets and Four Luminaries, the Great Saints of the Northern Dipper and Southern Culmen, the Three Officials and their sovereigns, the True Lords of the Five Thearchs, the stellar deities of the Twenty-Eight Lodges, the host of saints of the Heavenly Pivot Institute, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the Three Heavens’ Great Dharma Masters, the Three Masters of the Numinous Treasure Scriptures and Registers, the host of saints of the Northern Culmen Demon-Dispelling Institute, and all the divine beings and celestial configurations of the Vault of Heaven.

We humbly acknowledge that the Prime Minister of the Pure Capital spreads the work of the mysterious transformation, and the great deities of the Purple Palace assist with impartial virtue. They emerge with the seasons and embody all things with benevolence. We bow our heads in reverence to present our plea, hoping for your compassionate regard.

This disciple of the Most High, having early taken refuge in the true teachings, is unworthily called to serve as an officiant. His aspiration lies in cultivation and his heart in benefiting others. He promotes the ritual protocols and bears the numinous talismans, reverently following the benevolence of the Supreme Thearch to universally relieve the suffering of the people. Therefore, he solemnly arranges the jade altar and invites the descent of the cloud chariots. He hopes for your gracious favor to widely bless all beings, both animate and inanimate.

We humbly pray that the mind of the Dao may remain steadfast and upright, and that the power of the Dharma may flourish. May the true qi be preserved within this body, and the transgressions of past kalpas be dissolved. May merit extend to our masters and grace encompass all living beings. We look upward, hoping for your illuminating gaze to fulfill our prayers.

This minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost urgency and devotion, bow twice in earnest supplication.

Next, incense is offered thrice.
Wine is presented.
Broth is offered.
Next, the officiant sounds the chime and performs the tertiary offering.
Next, the officiant sounds the chime and intones the *Processional Hymn of Departure from the Hall*:
The Dao prioritizes purification; through diligent practice, one ascends to the Golden Towers.
Thus, the great Dharma bridge is established to universally deliver all beings.
Repaying the kindness of past lives, the mind of the Dao arises transcendent.
The body ascends to the immortal capital; seven generations of ancestors are all liberated.

This minister respectfully and earnestly addresses the following:
The August Lords of the Five Marchmounts, the Dragon Deities of the Four Seas, the sacred peaks and grotto-heavens, the tranquil hermitages and blessed lands, the Ten Continents and Three Isles, the Four Waterways and Hundred Rivers, the immortal officials of the administrative offices, the Great Saints of Ascension, the celestial bureaucrats and their subordinates, the deities of the earthly realms, the immortal functionaries and divine generals, the officials of the registers and numinous officers, the sovereigns of the netherworld, the deities of water and land, the numinous powers of the Three Realms, and the supreme saints of the Ten Directions.

We humbly acknowledge that Heaven stands as a mighty screen, majestic in its fourfold dominion, while Earth shapes its forms, towering as the fivefold pillars of the directions. Together they receive the Emperor’s favor and divide their governance over the human realm. With reverent sincerity we present our plea, hoping for compassionate witness.

The disciple of the Most High, having received the transmission of the Dao, declares: from early days I have revered the subtleties of the Way and vowed to bear the true talismans. To accomplish the work of aiding beings, one must rely on the arts of cultivating perfection. Thus we have widely performed purifications and offered fragrant incense. We now open the altar precincts and reverently conduct the jiao rites.

We pray that the heart of Heaven will assist in harmony, that the principles of the divine will draw near to humanity. May all perverse and demonic forces be eradicated from the nine depths, and majestic virtue extend universally to the ten thousand kinds. Thereafter, may subjects and ministers enjoy peace, together rejoicing beneath a Yao-like sky; may the Dao and its methods flourish, aiding the enduring succession of a Zhou-like dynasty.

This minister and the disciples of the Most High, with utmost fervor and devotion, bow twice in profound reverence. Having proclaimed the transmission protocols and presented the ritual money and horses, we now make this declaration. Next, we humbly address again:

This minister respectfully and earnestly addresses...

The Three Pure Lords, the Perfected Immortals of the Ten Poles, the divine spirits of seas and mountains, the celestial and terrestrial immortals, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all majestic numina—now that the triple offering of rites has been completed and words need not be repeated, we await the presence of the true spirits and pause the ranks of their retinue. Fearful of overstaying our reverence, we prostrate ourselves in trepidation.

We pray that the true spirits of the upper realms return each to their jeweled palaces, and that the host of sages below resume their immortal courts. As their radiant light has turned toward this altar, so must blessings descend upon this auspicious night.

This minister and the disciples of the Most High, unable to contain our devotion and supplication, bow twice in profound reverence as we humbly send forth this offering.

Next, the sounding of the chime signals the Hymn of Sending Forth the Gods:
*Returning to till the five-cloud chariot,*
*Ascending with the Nine Songs’ melody.*
*Swiftly soaring, far into the heavens,*
*The altar’s incense and qi abound.*
*Mysterious grace pervades the cosmos,*
*Fortune and prosperity fill mountains and rivers.*
*Gazing afar at the immortals’ path,*
*Freely they roam above the Great Loft.*

Next, the High Master of Rituals resumes his office:
This minister announces the completion of the jiao rites. All the dispatched messengers and attendants of the merit officials shall now return to my person—entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, those on the left return to the left, those on the right return to the right. The direct messenger and merit officials shall resume their oversight and inspection, returning to their original positions without error. When summoned again, they shall arrive promptly as before.

Next, the High Master of Rituals restores the incense burner:
Incense officials, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all attending spirit officials—at this place where the jiao rites are held, may golden nectar, cinnabar-green mushrooms, and azure herbs spontaneously arise. May the hundred spirits and host of perfected ones gather here before this incense burner.

We pray that the disciples of the Most High and this minister, recipients of blessings, may be favored by the ten directions. May jade lads and immortal maidens attend the fragrant smoke, swiftly conveying the sincerity of our earlier prayers directly to the presence of the Utmost True, Boundless, and Great Dao—the August Jade Emperor of the Vast Heaven.

Next, the sounding of the chime signals the Hymn of China’s Splendor.

Next, proceed to the site for burning the prayer texts and stand in order.

Next, present incense, recite the offering words, pour the libation, and bow in retreat.

Next, the sounding of the chime signals the Hymn of Dedication:
All the merit of the jiao rites performed is dedicated to the disciples of the Most High, this minister, and all who have participated, that together we may rely on this virtuous act to attain the supreme Dao and all who have offered reverence.

Next, the High Master of Rituals recites the Dedication of Merit:
On behalf of the disciple of the Most High, [Name], who seeks grace, repents transgressions, accumulates blessings, and dispels calamities, we invoke:
The Great Sage, Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning;
The Boundless Great Dao, Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure;
The Most High Lord Lao;
The Heavenly Worthy of Purple Clarity Who Bestows Blessings;
The Heavenly Worthy Who Prolongs Life and Augments Destiny;
The Heavenly Worthy Who Preserves Life and Protects Destiny;
The Heavenly Worthy of the Eight Trigrams Who Guards the Body;
The Heavenly Worthy of the Nine Palaces Who Defends Against Misfortune;
The Heavenly Worthies of the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure;
The Great Compassionate Perfected of the Solar Canopy;
The Great Merciful Perfected of the Lunar Stillness;
The Perfected of Southern Prosperity Who Extends Longevity;
The Perfected of the Three Pure Ones’ Jade Treasury;
And all the immortals and sages of Jade Capital Mountain—whose merits are beyond conception.

Next, the sounding of the chime signals the conclusion of the rites and the disciples’ withdrawal from their positions.

The altar for cultivating the true Dao in accordance with the Orthodox Heart of Heaven’s Dharma has now completed its jiao rites.
