**The Scripture of Orthodox Unity’s Ritual Dignity**

**Scripture Title:** *The Scripture of Orthodox Unity’s Ritual Dignity*. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Section of Numinous Writings on Ritual Dignity*, *Category of Ritual Dignity*.

The Supreme Lord says: The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao:

First, upon entering the Dao’s gate, one must approach the master to receive the covenant contract. Without receiving the covenant contract, the true officials guarding the boundaries of lands, mountains, and rivers will not record one’s Daoist name, and the administrative officials will obstruct and delay, making it difficult to attain the Dao. Upon receiving this covenant contract, the gates of Heaven and Earth dare not delay.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the register of governance and the Three Refuges and Five Precepts. Those who do not receive these will not be recorded by the governing offices, the local earth gods will remain unenlightened, the five *qi* will not be gathered, and the four administrative bureaus will not be connected. Upon receiving this register of governance, demon kings will bow in submission, calling themselves subordinate officials.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the talismans of immortals and spirits. Those who do not receive these will find that summoned spirits do not descend, gods do not provide protection, and petitions do not reach their destination. In all matters of reverent observance, spirits will not flow freely, and the Five Emperors of the Three Realms will not respect one’s form. Upon receiving these talismans, one may perform purification rites and petitions, subdue ghosts and expel demons, commanding them first.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the commands of the Nine Provinces’ earth altars and the governors of the Nine Provinces. Those who do not receive these will, when traveling through the Nine Provinces, be delayed by the spirits of mountains, rivers, and lands wherever they go, and their paths will not be clear. Upon receiving these talismans, ghosts and spirits will show reverence, and one will not be subject to the jurisdiction of earthly officials or demon kings, who will instead protect one’s form.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the talismans for slaying evil and the registers of the Dharma for slaying evil. Those who do not receive these will be encroached upon by demonic spirits and malevolent ghosts, suffering invasions of weapons and illness. Upon receiving these, one may execute evil and subdue misfortune, causing myriad spirits to conceal themselves, while the spirits of lands, mountains, and rivers will escort and welcome.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the talismans for warding off the Nine Palaces’ calamities and the Six Harmful Spirits. Those who do not receive these will suffer repeated afflictions of the Nine Calamities and Six Harms, and the malevolent ghosts of the Six Heavens will unleash their power. Upon receiving these, myriad disasters will not encroach, all evil will avoid one, and the Five Emperors of the Three Realms will serve one’s form.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the talismans of the Nine Heavens’ soldiers and the true talismans of the Nine Heavens. Those who do not receive these will find that the divine soldiers of the Three and Five will not follow one east or west, nor come to attend and protect when one enters and exits the human realm. Upon receiving these, the divine soldiers of the Three and Five will follow one east and west, attending and protecting upon entry and exit, so that myriad evils will not encroach. When summoning and commanding spirits, they dare not disobey, and all ghosts and spirits will dread one’s power.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the talismans of the Heavenly Numinous Red Officials and the Primordial Destiny. Those who do not receive these will find that heavenly spirits and earthly deities do not descend upon one’s body, true officials scatter in disarray, and the spirits within the body take flight. Upon receiving these, the soldiers and horses of Heaven and Earth will follow one’s needs, the officials and soldiers within the body will encircle one’s form, and one will rest and sleep in peace, undisturbed by dreams.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the talismans of the Twenty-Eight Constellations and the Seven Stars. Those who do not receive these will find that the stellar officials of the various heavens do not descend upon one’s body, the heavenly officials will not support one’s longevity and life preservation, and petitions and summons will not be answered. Upon receiving these, one’s name will ascend to the heavenly officials, life will be preserved and years extended, and when praying to the stellar officials, they will immediately comply with one’s words, attaining the Dao and ascending as an immortal, with the gates of Heaven opening of their own accord.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the General Seal of the Complete Chapters and the Fourfold Prohibitive *Qi*. Those who do not receive these will find that when submitting memorials, deploying talismans, or performing prohibitions and methods, the spirit *qi* will not comply, and petitions will not be heard. Upon receiving these, talismans, memorials, prohibitions, and invocations will all proceed as commanded.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the Three Hundred Great Chapters and the Twelve Hundred Officials. Those who do not receive these will find that the officials and soldiers within the chapters will not heed one’s words, and despite reverent observance, one will instead incur transgressions. Upon receiving and practicing these, one’s words will be as those of the gods, and this is of utmost importance. Guard against careless transmission; follow the regulations in cultivation to avoid all disasters and misfortunes.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the Great Register of the Purple Palace. Those who do not receive this will be unable to eliminate disasters for the state, rectify the divisions of Heaven, or gain the compliance of heavenly officials. Upon receiving and diligently practicing this, Heaven will respond to one’s heart, and all prayers and wishes will be followed by the various heavens. One will attain the Dao and ascend to Heaven, where stellar officials will descend to welcome, the gates of Heaven will open, and demon kings will protect one’s name.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the Register for Dispelling Nightmares. Those who do not receive this will find that spirit *qi* does not flow, impure *qi* does not dissipate, and when deploying talismans, consecrating water, summoning ghosts, or binding spirits, true spirits will advance and scatter, while malevolent spirits will encroach upon one’s form. Upon receiving this, impurities will be swept away, and humans and ghosts will be clear and bright.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Next, one must approach the master to receive the Seventy-Two Precepts and the One Hundred Eighty Precepts. Those who do not receive these will be examined and punished by the Four Administrative Bureaus of the Three Realms, their names erased from the records of good deeds, their offenses listed in the registers of transgressions, and even their parents in life and death will not escape the Three Wretched Realms. Upon receiving and practicing these, the various heavens will rejoice, ghosts and spirits will honor one, the seven generations of ancestors will ascend to Heaven, and one’s body will ascend to the Cloud Palace.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: If one does not approach the master to receive the scriptures, precepts, talismans, and registers, practicing them will lack numinosity and instead incur the sin of theft. One must approach the master to receive them and cultivate according to the Dharma. The above outlines the essentials; all should proceed accordingly.

The ritual dignity for receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Whenever one wishes to receive the Dao, one must first approach the master’s gate, sincerely pray, and prostrate in reverence. Once the master permits and accepts the petition, one may request the scriptures, precepts, talismans, and registers, copying them according to the Dharma. One must prepare ritual provisions, pledges, ritual robes, and ritual implements in full. Only then may one ascend the altar, make declarations, sever former covenants, and list one’s vows and personal circumstances. All should be done on selected days, spaced apart by months, and not done frequently or with tacit permission or ease.

The Ritual Dignity for Receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: To receive the Dao, one must approach a master who possesses the scriptures, precepts, talismans, and registers. One must not falsely transmit reputation or recklessly receive the true scriptures—this is a major prohibition of the Dao, and violation shall condemn the soul to the Nine Dark Realms.

The Ritual Dignity for Receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: A master without the Dharma must not recklessly transmit it. If a disciple makes a petition and falsely transmits covenants and vows, ten thousand kalpas of wind and blade shall befall them, and their seven generations of ancestors shall share the guilt—this must be strictly heeded.

The Ritual Dignity for Receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Those of the same surname, from nine generations of kinship, may not transmit the teachings to one another as master and disciple. Why is this? If master and disciple violate the covenant, the nine generations of ancestors shall share the punishment.

The Ritual Dignity for Receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: One with the Dharma is a master, regardless of whether they are a servant or subordinate. If one lacks the precepts and registers, even if they are a celestial exalted being, they may not presume to act as a master due to the Dharma.

The Ritual Dignity for Receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: When ascending the altar, one must establish the Three Masters and Five Guarantors to oversee the transmission, inspecting gains and losses, and addressing the offices of the Three Heavens and Five Emperors.

The Ritual Dignity for Receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: After ascending the altar and completing the transmission, the disciple shall be dressed in ritual robes and bestowed with their rank and title. The disciple shall then recite their rank and title, paying homage to their original master and the Most High of the Ten Directions.

The Ritual Dignity for Receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: Upon completion of receiving the Dao, the names, appearances, and ages of the Three Masters shall be recorded on yellow silk, along with those of the Three Masters, Five Guarantors, and the disciple who ascended the altar.

The Ritual Dignity for Receiving the Orthodox Unity Dao: When receiving the Dao, each shall adhere to their proper rank and dignity. One must not presume or err: laypersons may not sit with the devout disciples, devout disciples may not sit with the devout Daoists, devout Daoists may not sit with Orthodox Unity Daoists, Orthodox Unity Daoists may not sit with High Mystery Dharma Masters, High Mystery Dharma Masters may not sit with Cavern Spirit Dharma Masters, Cavern Spirit Dharma Masters may not sit with Cavern Mystery Dharma Masters, Cavern Mystery Dharma Masters may not sit with Cavern Perfection Dharma Masters, and Cavern Perfection Dharma Masters may not sit with Great Cavern Dharma Masters. When ascending the altar to perform the Dao, during fasts, lectures, or in private chambers, whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, these ranks shall determine their dignity. For the upper, middle, and lower seats, one should consult and seek guidance, always remaining humble and reverent toward the Dharma teachings, never impairing ritual dignity.

The Ritual Dignity for Orthodox Unity Ritual Robes: Before receiving the Dao, one must prepare the ritual robes: a dark cap, crimson-brown robe, yellow skirt and sash, straw sandals, and a ritual tablet. After transmission, one shall then don the cap and sash.

The Ritual Dignity for Orthodox Unity Ritual Robes: Ritual robes must not be made of five-colored silks, brocades, or fine fabrics. They shall be made of plain silk or cloth, following proper regulations, and kept pure, not exceeding three layers.

The Ritual Dignity for Orthodox Unity Ritual Robes: Ritual robes must not be casually removed. When washing or replacing them, one must not allow laypersons to touch or mix them with common garments. All robes are constantly guarded by divine men and women.

The Ritual Dignity for Orthodox Unity Ritual Robes: Ritual robes must not be lent to others; one must prepare their own. If damaged, they may be purified by fire. If residing in mountain forests or secluded places, they may be buried.

The Ritual Dignity for Orthodox Unity Ritual Robes: When removing or donning ritual robes, place them in a pure location. When visiting the privy or handling objects, one must first wash hands and feet before touching them.

The Ritual Dignity for Entering the Oratory: First, adjust the ritual robes, perform ablutions, recite invocations, and circumambulate while chanting praises—all must be done according to the Dharma, not casually. One must not utter vulgar or punitive words.

The Ritual Dignity for Entering the Oratory: When ascending the altar or entering the chamber, one must not scold others or converse with outsiders, glance around, or allow the mind to wander.

The Ritual Dignity for Entering the Oratory: All necessities within the oratory must be prepared in advance; one must not lack anything at the last moment and call for outsiders to seek supplies.

The Ritual Dignity for Entering the Oratory: When entering the oratory, remove or don sandals while facing the scriptures and images, never turning one’s back. When lifting the feet, follow the left and right in accordance with yin and yang.

The Ritual Dignity for Memorial Presentations: Stand facing west, hold the tablet with a slight bow, regulate the voice and qi, speak plainly and softly, with simple and unadorned words—one must not raise the voice or use excessive embellishment.

The Ritual Dignity for Memorial Presentations: Sincerely pray with earnest devotion, expressing one’s pleas with sincerity. Be concise in matters, never losing ritual dignity. Whether for oneself or others, one must remain single-minded, never negligent or careless.

The Ritual Dignity for Memorial Presentations: For all petitions, first repent one’s transgressions, then make the request. Speak with elevated and restrained words, ensuring the sentiment and reason are appropriate. Do not over-embellish and lose sincerity.

The Ritual Dignity for Memorial Presentations: From beginning to end, remain single-minded, with consistent words and intent. Do not present different matters morning and evening, or begin with reverence and end with carelessness.

The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Recitation: Don the cap and sash, perform ablutions, hold incense, and focus the mind. Follow the original text, sit upright with reverence, regulate the voice and qi, and recite with utmost sincerity from beginning to end without pause.

The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Recitation: When reciting scriptures, maintain unbroken concentration, thought after thought, without omission or forgetfulness. If a word or phrase is mispronounced, after five hundred words, pause to acknowledge the error and reflect on one’s heart.

The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Recitation: After five hundred or one thousand words, or at the end of a chapter, one may swallow saliva or drink pure water to benefit the voice and qi, without violating the Dharma.

The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Recitation: Upon completing a scroll, if interrupted by matters, place the scripture in its case, offer incense three times, and bow. When resuming, do the same.

The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Recitation: First wash the hands, fumigate the hands and scripture, then recite. After finishing, again wash the hands cleanly; do not proceed immediately.

The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Recitation: Before reciting scriptures, first approach the master to receive the proper pronunciation, phrasing, and recognition of characters. Do not create confusion in the scripture hall or disrupt others.

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Recitation:** While reciting scriptures, one must not entertain others’ requests to explain the meaning of passages, nor engage in clarifying doubts, handling miscellaneous affairs, or disrupting the true and numinous.

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Recitation:** If there are unclear points in the scripture requiring consultation or questions about characters, phrasing, or pronunciation, one should do so at another time, approaching the master with reverence to seek instruction. One must not casually inquire as the need arises.

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Exposition:** Disciples must first consult and inform the Dharma master, stating: “For so-and-so—whether men or women—or for such-and-such a matter, we request at such-and-such a place the exposition of such-and-such a scripture, wishing to receive enlightenment.”

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Exposition:** Once the Dharma master grants permission, prepare and adorn a high seat in the lecture hall. Whether for a hundred or a thousand listeners, all must be arranged according to ritual, with dignity befitting the occasion.

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Exposition:** When setting up the high seat, orient it east, west, south, or north as appropriate. Place the scripture to the left and the master to the right. Men should be seated to the east, women to the west. Do not allow mingling, lest the dignity be lost.

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Exposition:** The ritual fan, whisk, incense burner, scripture case, lectern cloth, banners, flowers, canopy, and seating mats must all be arranged according to proper form. Nothing should be done casually.

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Exposition:** Disciples and listeners, each bearing incense and flowers, along with banners, pennants, and music, should chant praises and lead the procession, burning incense and bowing to welcome the Dharma master. They must come and go in accordance with the occasion, without negligence.

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Exposition:** The Dharma master, in accordance with the circumstances, should guide both Daoists and laypeople in repentance, vows, precepts, and fasting, frequently exhorting them to awaken to the true Dao. Spreading the Dao and benefiting beings takes precedence in this.

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Exposition:** The Dharma master dedicates the merit of scripture exposition to adorn the lord of the realm, high ministers, local officials, all people and creatures, those in the five sufferings and three evil destinies, and all sentient beings, that they may awaken to the Dao and attain perfection.

**The Ritual Dignity for Scripture Exposition:** Upon concluding the exposition, disciples and all listeners, each according to their capacity, should resolve to establish a grand treasure fast, that boundless blessings may spread.

**The Ritual Dignity for Serving the Master:** Morning and evening, one must properly don the ritual attire and, holding a tablet, pay homage to one’s primary master and the Three Masters, as one would to one’s parents. If residing together, one should inquire after them morning and night, with a kind and joyful countenance.

**The Ritual Dignity for Serving the Master:** If the master is a hundred *li* away, visit once a month; if two hundred *li*, once every three months; if five hundred *li* or more, once a year. If the master is ill, aged, or otherwise indisposed, these limits do not apply, and written correspondence is unrestricted.

**The Ritual Dignity for Serving the Master:** When visiting the master, one must personally bring provisions—food, incense, oil, and the like—without causing any loss or expense to the master.

**The Ritual Dignity for Serving the Master:** Disciples should provide for the master in a timely manner: clothing, medicine, ritual implements, staffs, towels, whisks, shoes, vessels, rice, wheat, fruits, and vegetables. Supply all necessities without allowing any deficiency.

**The Ritual Dignity for Serving the Master:** If the master falls ill or encounters misfortune, attend to them closely, perform meritorious deeds, burn incense, repent, release living beings, and redeem lives. Establish fasts and practice the Dao to extend their years and avert calamity.

**The Ritual Dignity for Serving the Master:** Upon the master’s passing, observe mourning for a hundred days and maintain a heart of mourning for three years. Bury them in the mountains, using a simple coffin or cloth shroud, merely to contain the body. Create fields of merit and reflect upon their bearing.

**The Ritual Dignity for Observing Fasts:** Whether for oneself or others, when establishing fasts and blessings, one must do so with utmost sincerity. All rice and wheat must be pure, without substitution, theft, or improper acquisition.

**The Ritual Dignity for Observing Fasts:** For all auspicious or inauspicious occasions, matters of life and death, or meritorious deeds, one should first perform a fast and undertake all virtuous acts. On the day of completion, a fast must be held to celebrate.

**The Ritual Dignity for Observing Fasts:** All fasts are overseen by the Three Realms, the Five Emperors, and the Four Divine Officials, who inspect the offerings. Nothing may be defiled or stolen.

**The Ritual Dignity for Observing Fasts:** When ascending to the fast and making offerings, whether noble or humble, old or young, all must be treated equally. One must not harbor dual intentions or generate thoughts of attachment or aversion.

**The Ritual Dignity for Observing Fasts:** The officiants of the fast should distribute offerings according to their portion, thereby purchasing blessings. One must not verbally agree while harboring regret, nor generate dissatisfaction or negligence.

**The Ritual Dignity for Observing Fasts:** When the officiants present offerings, they must proceed in order, announcing their names and positions. No intermingling is permitted; one must follow the sequence and announce clearly, without bias or imbalance.

**The Ritual Dignity for Observing Fasts:** The host should present a formal address, clearly stating the purpose, and proceed to invite the Dharma master. The Dharma master, upon receiving the petition, should respond according to the names and not delay or accept nearby household offerings out of convenience.

**The Ritual Dignity for Observing Fasts:** After the officiants have eaten their portion, the remainder should be returned to the host. It must not be taken home, nor should the communal food be contested or consumed. All should exercise caution.

**The Ritual Dignity for Observing Fasts:** On the Eight Liberations, Ten Upright Days, Jiazi, Gengshen, one’s own life-day, and the eight auspicious solar terms, one should observe fasts. The Three Realms, Five Emperors, Four Heavens, and Ten Divisions all come to oversee.

**The Ritual Dignity for Receiving Precepts:** The Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Six Precepts, Nine Precepts, Twelve Permissible Precepts, Twenty-Seven Precepts, Forty-Six Precepts, Seventy-Two Precepts, Eighty Precepts, One Hundred Twenty Precepts, and Three Hundred Precepts—each should be received and upheld according to their proper form.

**The Ritual Dignity for Receiving Precepts:** Whether for the lord of the realm, high ministers, local officials, men and women of the people, or even spirits and all sentient beings, precepts should be conferred according to their capacity. Command the guardian deities of the precepts to protect them, that no calamities may befall.

**The Ritual Dignity for Receiving Precepts:** Those who uphold the precepts must not share a bed or seat with those who do not. In walking, standing, sitting, lying, eating, dwelling, clothing, footwear, vehicles, staffs, and ritual implements, all should be kept distinct.

**The Ritual Dignity for Repentance:** At dawn and dusk, one faces the true and ascends the altar to enter the oratory, reciting scriptures and performing prostrations. First, repent for the lord of the realm, high ministers, local officials, parents, teachers, those in the Three Wretched Realms and Five Sufferings, and all sentient beings; then, for oneself.

**The Ritual Dignity for Repentance:** In walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, with every thought and intention, the three karmas and six senses may inadvertently commit transgressions—like grains of sand and specks of dust. Focus the mind in repentance, ensuring no further wrongdoing arises, that all may be purified and myriad transgressions dissolved.

**The Ritual Dignity for Prostration:** Upon entering the oratory to face the true, in walking, standing, sitting, and lying down, whether in mind or form, prostrate to the Five Hundred Million Devas of the Ten Directions, the boundless true, responsive, and transformed manifestations of the Heavenly Worthies, and the host of immortals and sages.

**The Ritual Dignity for Prostration:** With every thought and movement, take refuge in the empty vastness, as numerous as motes of dust and grains of sand—past, future, and present—bowing to the limitless Dao, the great and small bodies, the infinite equal bodies, in reverence to all.

**The Ritual Dignity for Prostration:** From the Great Lofty Heaven above to the boundless depths below, across the Ten Directions and Three Realms, the Dao manifests in response, expounding the teachings. In the Thirty-Six Divisions, the true and transformed Dharma, the outer and inner treasuries, talismans, charts, and sacred scriptures—all are venerated with devotion.

**The Ritual Dignity for Burning Incense:** First, cleanse the incense box, censer, tongs, spoon, tray, ashes, and charcoal, then arrange them properly, ensuring all is level, polished, and pure. The fire should not show red embers, and the ritual form should be observed.

**The Ritual Dignity for Burning Incense:** All ashes, charcoal, and fire must be stored separately. Do not use hearth embers, leftover fires, or impure fuels—such as tainted wood or foul substances—nor discard ashes in improper places.

**The Ritual Dignity for Burning Incense:** When shaping incense, use three fingers, hold the body upright, and maintain a focused mind, whether sitting or standing. Take the incense conveniently with three fingers.

**The Ritual Dignity for Burning Incense:** With each of the three offerings, ensure the smoke rises continuously, without interruption.

**The Ritual Dignity for Burning Incense:** In prayers, invocations, entering the oratory, and ascending the altar, let the incense burn day and night without cease, for the divine beings, though formless, communicate through the fragrance.

**The Ritual Dignity for Burning Incense:** Before reciting scriptures, performing the Dao, observing fasts, chanting, lecturing, or praying, first circumambulate with incense three times, then present the words.

**The Ritual Dignity for Burning Incense:** The incense of the celestial realms has a thousand names and myriad forms, perfuming all without burning, carried by wind and clouds to fill the Ten Directions. In the mortal world, among all things, only this is indispensable.

**The Ritual Dignity for Lighting Lamps:** Lamps, shaped like stars, aid the light of heaven, prolong life, avert misfortune, and dispel calamities. Whether one lamp, ten lamps, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, or a hundred million—let it be according to one’s capacity.

**The Ritual Dignity for Lighting Lamps:** In performing the Dao, reciting scriptures, prostrating, lecturing, or circumambulating the altar, arrange the lamps like stars in a ring—twelve thousand in number, corresponding to the essence of heaven. They shine by night and fade by day, aligning with qi in cultivation.

**The Ritual Dignity for Lighting Lamps:** When lighting lamps, place them three feet above the ground, covering them with a canopy to prevent insects from entering and to shield them from wind and dust.

**The Ritual Dignity for Ringing the Bell:** The bell is a precious instrument of ritual dignity, heard by the four assemblies, an urgent task in the six periods—it must not be omitted. Place the bell to the left and scriptures to the right, both on raised platforms.

**The Ritual Dignity for Ringing the Bell:** At the second, third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth hours, one must adjust one’s attire, wash hands, rinse the mouth, compose body and mind, first knock the teeth and recite the incantation, then strike the bell.

**The Ritual Dignity for Ringing the Bell:** The method of striking the bell: first, strike densely then sparsely, slowly sounding three strokes—this is called the "three initial strikes." Then, strike densely then sparsely, slowly sounding twenty-four strokes to conclude—this is called the "long strike." Return to the initial density, slowly sounding twelve strokes—this is called the "end." In total, thirty-nine strokes, corresponding to the thirty-nine households.

**The Ritual Dignity for Ringing the Bell:** After the three initial strikes, arrange lamps and fires, prepare seats, wash, rinse, and don proper attire. Wait for the long strike, then proceed slowly. The assembly should align in proper order, with incense, flowers, and hymns all arranged with dignity. When the final bell sounds, begin the chanting and guiding, ensuring no haste disrupts the ritual decorum.

**The Ritual Dignity for Ringing the Bell:** Do not miss the proper time or strike the bell improperly. For unscheduled gatherings, use a smaller bell.

**The Ritual Dignity for Striking the Chime Stone:** It marks the rhythm when ascending the altar or entering the chamber, as required by ritual dignity. Strike it at the beginning and end of prostrations, when praising, in guiding movements, during bows and rises, and in fasts and lectures.

**The Ritual Dignity for Memorials:** The art of memorials is most difficult—do not treat it lightly. Ensure the paper and ink are clean, the wording upright and proper, aligned with true qi, without falsehood or error, as the divine officials will deliberate.

**The Ritual Dignity for Memorials:** When bowing to present a memorial, face the direction of submission. Set up a separate seat and table, arrange the cloth and case properly, sit humbly, and read in an even voice—do not act arrogantly or irreverently.

**The Ritual Dignity for Memorials:** Without receiving the Register of Governance, the Twelve Hundred Official Lords, the Three Hundred Sixty Great Memorials, or the Complete Seal of Memorials, one may not submit memorials to the celestial bureaus. Each must manifest their own immortal officials—do not falsely claim oversight.

**The Ritual Dignity for Offering Sacrifices:** Sacrifices are offerings to the gods of heaven and earth. There are many kinds, and all cakes and fruits must be pure—do not use meat, dried flesh, or foul substances, lest the celestial officials not grant protection.

**The Ritual Dignity for Offering Sacrifices:** All pledged offerings must not be borrowed. If insufficient, do not deceive the enlightened spirits.

When the rites are complete, distribute offerings to mountain-dwelling Daoists, the hungry and cold, the elderly and infirm, prisoners, and laborers.

**The Ritual Dignity for Offering Sacrifices:** When the rites are complete, bury all remaining cakes and fruits after the food has been set out.

**The Ritual Dignity for Offering Sacrifices:** The proper time is after midnight and before midday, when the qi of life is ascendant.

**The Ritual Dignity for Offering Sacrifices:** All cakes and fruits used must be fresh and fragrant; do not use those left overnight, nor those tainted by birth impurity, corpses, or remnants gnawed by domestic fowl or rats, lest the spirits refuse to partake and your efforts be in vain.

**The Ritual Dignity for Daoist Ritual Implements:** A Daoist’s ritual implements—incense burners, washing vessels, small tables, dusters, ruyi scepters, pendants, swords, and staffs—must always be kept in good order, arranged and offered according to their use.

**The Ritual Dignity for Eating Utensils:** A Daoist’s eating utensils—three-tiered spoons, chopsticks, napkins, and cloths—must all be proper; do not use gold, silver, precious jades, ivory, or carved horn, nor mix them with ordinary vessels. They must always be kept pure.

**The Ritual Dignity for Utensils:** A Daoist’s utensils—rinsing trays, communal food plates, water basins, pestles and mortars for grinding incense, and cauldrons and steamers for compounding medicines—must be suited to their purpose and not borrowed.

**The Ritual Dignity for Dwellings:** A Daoist’s dwelling should be simple, unadorned, and serene, with open space inside and out; do not hang curtains, screens, or drapes that obstruct the surroundings.

**The Ritual Dignity for Dwellings:** A Daoist’s dwelling should be a humble room, just large enough to accommodate the body; do not reside in grand halls or spacious chambers adorned with carvings, red ochre, or whitewash, nor in lavish or ostentatious quarters.

**The Ritual Dignity for Dwellings:** A Daoist’s dwelling should have a bed placed against the wall; do not arrange beds to face one another. Sit and sleep alone; do not share quarters with ordinary people.

**The Ritual Dignity for Dwellings:** A Daoist’s dwelling should have a bed of chaste tree wood, a cloth cover, a mat of woven grass, a lacquered frame, a wooden tray, and earthenware vessels; do not use bronze, iron, gold, or silver.

**The Ritual Dignity for Bedding:** Use cloth sheets, cloth covers, a stone or wooden pillow, straw sandals, skirts, jackets, shirts, and trousers—all made of hempen cloth dyed with indigo, gardenia, bamboo leaves, or turmeric to a muted yellow hue.

**The Ritual Dignity for Footwear:** Craft sandals in the shape of mountains and the Two Modes, adorned with plain leather or cloth; do not embellish them with five-colored brocade or fine silk. If using straw sandals or wooden clogs, they must differ from those of the common world.

**The Ritual Dignity for Springs and Wells:** Where a Daoist resides, a well or spring must first be established, kept pure and free from contamination by the six livestock or filth. Separate wells should be designated for washing, drinking, and watering cattle, horses, and other animals.

**The Ritual Dignity for Wells and Springs:** All wells and springs must be frequently dredged; do not allow grass, flowers, leaves, frogs, or flies to fall into them. Each household and guest courtyard should have its own well, not shared with those used for sacrificial offerings.

**The Ritual Dignity for Water Use:** For all cooking, boiling medicines, washing clothes, and bathing, the water used must be passed through a fine filter before use.

**The Ritual Dignity for Eating and Drinking:** A Daoist’s food should fill the stomach and no more; do not seek refinement. Always observe fasting; do not eat at improper times or in improper ways.

**The Ritual Dignity for Eating and Drinking:** A Daoist should always recite the food incantation before eating, offering various foods in separate vessels. Visualize the Three Ones, eating in unison with one’s form, and strike the vessel three times with the chopsticks. Serve food in separate dishes and distribute it to living beings.

**The Ritual Dignity for Eating and Drinking:** Each Daoist should have their own set of eating utensils, kept clean with napkins and chopsticks. Provide daily necessities; do not share utensils with others, nor use them for other purposes, lest impure qi intermingle.

**The Ritual Dignity for Eating and Drinking:** Do not allow others to touch the food with impurity, nor eat facing upward, lest breath or clothing contaminate it. Distribute leftovers; do not hoard or take them away.

**The Ritual Dignity for Eating and Drinking:** After eating, a Daoist should seek repentance before distributing food; do not beg from others mid-meal or allow servants, attendants, chickens, or dogs to partake. The supervising immortal officials will record transgressions and report them to the Three Bureaus.

**The Ritual Dignity for Conduct:** In all actions—walking, standing, sitting, or lying down—a Daoist must align with the Dao, maintain a composed demeanor, keep the body upright, and avoid slouching, lest their dignity be lost. The head leads in ritual dignity; one cannot be too careful.

**The Ritual Dignity for Travel:** When a Daoist visits government offices, attends to their master, teaches among the people, or enters secular households for rituals, groups of five or three must proceed in orderly fashion, maintaining proper bearing. Do not intermingle or deviate from the rules.

**The Ritual Dignity for Travel:** When a Daoist travels among the people or attends ritual lectures, each should carry their own seat cushion, using it wherever they go. This both avoids impure qi and distinguishes ranks—high, middle, and low seats—all following the same system.

**The Ritual Dignity for Residing in Abbeys:** Once a Daoist has entered the Dao, they must reside in an abbey, uphold the Dharma, burn incense morning and evening, pay homage to the perfected, perform repentance rites, serve their master, observe precepts, seek guidance from virtuous elders, and study the methods of the Dao.

**The Ritual Dignity for Residing in Abbeys:** Daoists should instruct one another, cherish their Dharma bodies, cultivate goodness, cease evil, contemplate the Three Treasures, and embody kindness, gentleness, and harmony. In all matters, be reverent and compliant, perfect the Daoist sanctuary, and if outsiders offend, respond with patience.

**The Ritual Dignity for Residing in Abbeys:** Daoists should live in harmony, with seniors and juniors trusting and obeying one another, like the movement of hands and feet. Maintain the abbey’s permanence, sharing in the procurement of incense, oil, rice, wheat, firewood, and vegetables as if for oneself, without waste.

**The Ritual Dignity for Residing in Abbeys:** Fields, mills, and grinding stones, as well as servants, the five domestic animals, tools, livestock implements, fruits, herbs, and all necessities, must be cherished and offered to the ten directions as future blessings.

**The Ritual Dignity for Residing in Abbeys:** Sacred images, scriptures, and ritual instruments—banners, flowers, canopies, and altars—along with halls, pavilions, towers, mats, carpets, bells, chimes, tables, and whisk brooms—must all be established together, kept in refined splendor, and never allowed to fall into deficiency or lack.

**The Ritual Dignity for Residing in Abbeys:** All property belonging to the abbey and the wealth of the Three Treasures, from blades of grass and leaves to flowers and fruits, even the smallest particles, must not be privately used or given away to others. The transgression is grave: upon death, one falls into the Three Wretched Realms, and across past, future, and present lives, one’s own parents, siblings, sisters, children, and descendants will suffer poverty, low status, deafness, blindness, muteness, paralysis, leprosy, stupidity, madness, convulsions, or harm by water, fire, or weapons.

**The Ritual Dignity for Death:** When a master, preceptor, or fellow disciple dies, strike the bell three hundred and sixty times to announce the end. All disciples shall gather, weep three times, burn incense, and recite scriptures. For the encoffining, follow the proper ritual forms.

**The Ritual Dignity for Death:** Use a cloth stretcher to carry the body, convey it to the mountains, forests, marshes, or wetlands, and inter it in the earth without raising a mound, sealing the grave, or planting trees over it.

**The Ritual Dignity for Death:** The Zhengyi talismans, contracts, rings, and swords shall be placed in a cloth bag and buried with the body.

**The Ritual Dignity for Death:** Inscribe seventy-two talismans and affix them to the body as prescribed; perform the obeisance to the *Wuhuizhang* (Petition to Earth Deities) and the *Guanlianzhang* (Coffining Petition), with ritual vestments accompanying the deceased.

**The Ritual Dignity for Death:** All clothing, bedding, and belongings of the deceased master, after providing for the funeral, shall be recorded by name and donated to the abbey’s permanent endowment. Whether kin or stranger, insider or outsider, none may violate this rule.

**The Ritual Dignity for Death:** If the master leaves no property for the funeral, the abbey’s permanent endowment shall be used, along with offerings from vegetarian feasts and fields of merit, all drawn from communal resources. Thus, in life and death, all depend on the abbey, for the master is the Heavenly Worthy.

The Most High said to Heavenly Master Zhang Daoling: "These one hundred thirty-two articles of Zhengyi ritual dignity were received by me from the Original Celestial Worthy in the Jade Clarity Triple-Flower Convening Hall at the end of the Dragon Han kalpa. At that time, the Original Celestial Worthy, in the presence of the Most High Dao Lord, the Nine Heavens’ Perfected Masters, the Primordial Venerable, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Five Elders of the Upper Realms, and the Boundless Divine Kings, commanded the Five Thearchs’ Jade Lads to unfold the ninefold-clouded casket and produce this ritual dignity, entrusting it to me with these words: ‘You shall disseminate it throughout the Three Realms, the Ten Directions, and the boundless worlds, transmitting it to all men and women of virtuous intent.’ Since receiving it, I have passed through five kalpas, teaching and transforming wherever I go, filling the realms of humans and gods. The lofty sages and perfected immortals have all received and upheld it, inscribing it on golden tablets and concealing it among the celestial bureaus. Now it is fitting to transmit it to you—observe it with reverence. Devotion brings blessing; disclosure invites calamity.’ The Original Celestial Worthy’s solemn admonition must be heeded with care."

Zhang Daoling bowed his head in homage and gave thanks, saying: "Your disciple has not long entered the ranks of the perfected, yet has repeatedly received your compassionate grace, your earnest instruction, and the bestowal of scriptures and methods beyond measure. Now you further reveal these precepts and disciplines, subtle and wondrous beyond thought. How dare I not devote my whole heart to following them according to the regulations?"

Thereupon, the assembly of celestial sages and hosts all voiced their approval and together ascended into the great void. **The Scripture of Zhengyi Ritual Dignity ends here.**
