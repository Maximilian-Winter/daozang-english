**The Supreme Three Caverns Transmission Ritual for the *Daoist Canon of the Purple Void* and *Laozi’s Scripture on the Dao and Its Virtue*, with Prostration Memorial Rites**
Compiled by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting

The disciple, having heard the master’s precepts and completed the thanksgiving, rises and circumambulates leftward while reciting the *Eight Hymns of Penetrating the Mystery*:

The supreme Dao is ever void and quiescent,
Its mysterious transformation responds to the essence of the Perfected.
Dispersing spirit, it pervades all things,
Congealing radiance within the Three Clarities.
From the dim and indistinct, forms arise;
In the empty and boundless, the formless is seen.
Following the course of time, it unfolds the verdant assembly,
Adapting to conditions, it expounds the wondrous scripture.
Cultivate it, and one ascends the River of Stars;
Neglect it, and one falls into the dark prison.
Heavenly maidens scatter golden blossoms,
Divine youths chant jade-like tones.
Ten blossoms revolve the jeweled canopy,
Nine phoenixes halt the cloudy encampment.
Should one propagate these supreme traces,
All within the realm and state will know peace.

Five hundred million heavens,
Three thousand realms of the Dao.
Right and wrong ever await their turn,
Life and death endlessly cycle.
Delusion gives rise to the hells of greed and wrath,
Vanity constructs the palaces of killing and harm.
Falsely asserting self and other as distinct,
How can one know their sameness?
The six senses are all unreal,
The myriad dharmas all return to emptiness.
When afflictions are exhausted, the body dissolves;
When mind and sense-dusts cease, so too does consciousness.
Unable to seek liberation,
One remains ever confined in the dragon’s cage.
If one desires perpetual freedom,
Bow to the ancestral teaching of the supreme Dao.

Heaven and hell,
Ordinary beings and sages—
All arise from the square inch of the heart,
No other cause remains.
Awakened, one becomes a companion of wisdom;
Deluded, one dwells near the blind and foolish.
Suffering souls still possess awareness,
Sinful spirits too retain their numinous essence.
Why sink into the mire of affliction?
Truly, it stems from disbelief in the Real.
Abandoning the treasure above this body,
One stains oneself with the dust of the mundane world.
Having drifted into the sea of transmigration,
One drowns again at the ford of death and rebirth.
If one wishes to cross this suffering,
Sit in stillness and contemplate this body.

Excellent is the Venerable Primordial Beginning,
Compassionately delivering all beings.
Virtue extends beyond the void,
Merit fills the realms as numerous as motes of dust.
Expounding the Great Vehicle scriptures,
It engenders supreme wisdom.
Reversing the cycles of countless kalpas,
Its teaching pervades the three times.
Essence penetrates the realm of form,
Mystery exhausts the boundless immaterial.
Every region in every direction,
The Dao responds to every celestial sovereign.
Provisional and absolute, it delivers gods and humans,
Adapting its mechanism to the great and small.
Its divine function is unfathomable,
Shaping all without exception.

Sin and blessing are like reflections in a mirror,
Life and death like the turning of a wheel.
Observe only what departs in the light,
Who perceives what arrives in the dark?
Unaspiring for the palaces of the Three Heavens,
One grieves only for the terraces of the Five Sufferings.
When the sinful soul is spent by fate,
The dark spirit responds to the unfolding of conditions.
Essence and qi disperse like floating wisps,
The bodily frame long since turned to ash.
Content to become a ghostly form,
Who remembers entering the immortal’s womb?
Vainly wishing for one’s name in the Azure Register,
Yet sorrowfully hastened by the Black Book.
The Dharma-wheel is rarely glimpsed again,
The long night is truly lamentable.
This body is most pitiable—
All should cultivate the Way of life.

Who says the white jade fungus
Shades the golden herb?
Resolve to practice the Six Perfections,
Devote the heart to the Three Treasures.
The White Prime descends to receive,
The Red Child is ever embraced.
Though this withered age is late to learn,
In youth one must seize the moment.
Knowing contentment, one is carefree;
Greed for glory only brings vexation.
Sitting, one sees the humble hut as vast;
In stillness, one perceives heaven and earth as small.
Abiding in the One without wavering,
How can one speak of aging through eternity?

Three thousand worlds divided,
Five hundred million heavens transformed.
Each unfolds a pure realm,
Every region possesses its excellence.
Ninefold radiance births the courtyard grasses,
Seven treasures fill the pond’s lotuses.
Travelers’ lodges array the vermilion sun,
Flying terraces reflect the purple springs.
Burning incense are all jade maidens,
Expounding the Dharma are only divine immortals.
Brahmā’s chant summons the nine-crying phoenix,
The censer wafts five-colored smoke.
Bow to the palace of the Void Sovereign,
Sing praises before the Most High.

Beware of neglecting past lives,
One must trust in the field of blessings.
The Dao’s transformation spreads through the Three Primes,
The divine congeals, dividing the ten thousand images.
The Dragon Han unfolds the mysterious register,
Celestial script descends in the Crimson Nebula.
Responding to the time, the Dharma-drum resounds,
Following the direction, the wondrous gate opens.
The Most High bestows supreme traces,
Majesty and virtue blanket heaven and earth.
The divine scripture attends the Three Ones,
The wondrous principle lies in the Five Thousand Characters.
Words arrayed in the Golden Flower Palace,
Name transmitted by the Jade Emperor.
Within the heart, the sun of treasure arises;
Upon the body, clouds of gauze ascend.
What need for the Ten Immortals as companions?
Through kalpas uncounted, one abides forever.

Next, the *Hymn for the Transmission of the Scripture* is sung.
If the *Eight Hymns of Penetrating the Mystery* are not recited in full, this hymn follows the second:

Soaring beyond the Great Void’s peaks,
Flowing radiance abides in the Supreme Mystery.
Beginningless and endless through the kalpas,
It eternally preserves heaven, earth, and humankind.
The lord of the realm studies its governance,
The Daoist recites it to attain immortality.
The worthy now receive and uphold it,
Transmitting it in accord with the Dharma.
In times lacking a child of utmost virtue,
Guard its secrecy, do not recklessly proclaim it.
Uphold it, and ascend to the Great Clarity;
Abandon it, and fall into the Nine Springs.
I expound the Dao of non-action,
Through quiescence and emptiness, attain spontaneity.

Next, the master returns to his original position. The disciples face south, kneel toward the north, and invoke the Five Numinous Guardians, each by name, to receive the transmission:

Your servant now, on behalf of disciple [Name], [Official Title], transmits the register of the *Venerable Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue of the Purple Void*. The announcement complete, we pray for the descent of the divine officials and retinue of the Nine Heavens of the Central Heaven of the Eastern Direction, the Nine Yi Elders of the Blue-Green Lord, the Jade Maidens of the Blue Waist, the Jade Lads of Blue Radiance, and all the spirit officials of the Eastern Pole, from the Jia-Yi officials, along with the True Officials of the Year Star, the immortals and divine soldiers of the Eastern Marchmount, numbering ninety thousand, to enter the Purple Tenuity Palace within the body of disciple [Name], to guard and protect the true scripture, that [Name] may eternally ascend to the Dao’s fruit.

[Name] receives this.

[Name] receives this.

We pray for the descent of the scripture-attending immortals of the Supreme Ultimate, the attendants of the Great Mystery’s virtue/power, together with the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of Heaven and Earth, and the Three Ones’ scripture-attending officials, to enter the Three Primes Palace within the body of disciple [Name], to attend and serve the venerable scripture, that [Name] may eternally ascend to the Dao’s fruit. [Name] receives this.

The chant concluded, the disciple bows again.
Next, chant to the Ten Directions.

With wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the East—one bow.
With wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the South—one bow.
With wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the West—one bow.

With wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the Upper Realm—one bow.
With wholehearted devotion, I prostrate to the Boundless Most High Lord of Dao and Virtue in the Lower Realm—one bow.

Next, the confession:

Disciple of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Supreme Clarity and Mystic Capital, who performs the rites of transmission of the Dao and Virtue at [Name] Peak of [Name] Marchmount, the humble Perfected of Minor Fortune, your servant [Name], now reverently invokes the Most High, Formless, Nameless, Void, and Spontaneously Realized Perfect Great Dao, the Supreme Heavenly Worthy; the Most High Lord of the Great Dao; the Most High Lord Lao; the Boundless Great Dao and the Host of Sages, the Heavenly Worthies of the Utmost Limit; the Thirty-Six Divisions of Venerable Scriptures and the Great Dharma Masters of the Mystic Center, the Most High Lord Lao; the Supreme Perfected Master Wen Shi; the Perfected of the Yellow River; the Perfected of the Supreme Ultimate; the Left Immortal Duke of the Supreme Ultimate; the Three Perfected of the Mystic Unity; the Heavenly Master, the Lineage Master, and the Precept Master, the Three Masters; and all the host of sages throughout the Three Realms and the Ten Directions, who respond to conditions and proclaim transformation, whose numinous efficacy answers to devotion:

Your servant, though most foolish, has presumptuously received the wondrous transformation, upholding the Great Dharma and transmitting the praise of the Three Worthies. My aspiration lies in establishing merit and broadly bestowing deliverance, that those who dwell in longing and yearning for the teaching may all enter the Dharma gate. Having received the numinous scripture, I dare not withhold or sever it; for all who seek and supplicate, it is difficult to refuse. We disciples [Names], with earnest sincerity and ardent devotion, aspire to cultivate and serve, ever advancing and never retreating, with courage, vigor, and diligence. Heart and spirit unite, cinnabar words and countenance both earnest; thus, in accordance with the regulations, we transmit and confer, pledging before the numinous ones of the Upper Realm and the Three Realms, humbly beseeching their witness and attestation.

We prostrate before the Perfect and Most True Sagely Heavenly Worthies of Dao and Virtue, the Five Emperors, the Four Offices, the Three Officials, and the host of sages, praying that you bestow the blessing of protection and the compassion of responsive grace. May you absolve your disciples [Names], our nine generations and seven lineages, our myriad ancestors of past kalpas, our Three Masters and their retinues, and ourselves, for the accumulated kalpas since we failed to awaken to the true Dao—our hidden sins and manifest transgressions, our faults in life and death, our karmic debts and former enmities, our long-standing and recent offenses, boundless and immeasurable—all of which we beseech you to dissolve and eradicate.

Grant that our nine ancestors ascend to heaven, that our six relations share in fortune, that those in the Three Wretched Realms of the long night universally receive deliverance along with their enemies, that by this auspicious opportunity all may attain liberation. May the registers of the underworld be expunged, our names inscribed in the immortal records, our Dao practices elevated, our studies swiftly accomplished, our households flourishing, calamities and misfortunes pacified, the nation’s destiny prolonged, and the winds of the Dao spread afar.

We, who transmit the scriptures and confer the Dao, have acted contrary to the regulations in movement and stillness, accumulating myriad transgressions and faults—all of which we beg to be absolved. May all who hear the Great Dharma, all who possess the will, by the pervading power of your grace, find peace in both the manifest and hidden realms. We bow our heads in reverence and gratitude to the Ten Directions, prostrating to the Orthodox Three Treasures.

Next, arise and circumambulate, reciting the *Hymn of Radiant Light* once, and the *Hymns to the Perfected* six times:

To establish merit, act early;
To study the Dao, do so now.
Day and night, be diligent and earnest,
Resolve your intent, cast aside doubt.
Burn incense and bow constantly,
Recite scriptures and ever honor your master.
With courage and vigor, advance with diligence,
Devoted and sincere, free from distracting thoughts.
The Four Immeasurables and the Six Perfections,
The Three Releases and the Five Feminine Powers.
Wash away dust and enter emptiness,
With an empty heart, maintain self-discipline.
Only seek unwavering progress,
Not to be scorned by others.
If one can do thus,
Morning and evening, one will ascend as an immortal.

Though the Great Dao is without intent,
It may be sought with devotion.
Awaiting the chariot in the empty cavern,
Turning along the hidden paths of the azure flow.
Beyond the Three Realms, in purity and brightness,
Roaming the ethereal Jade Capital.
Without the mysterious impetus of fate,
Who can awaken to the hidden truth?
The vast Milky Way, serene,
Gazing up and down, one finds emptiness and softness.
The Seven Mysteries scatter the dark night,
Returning to the womb, following the ebb and flow.
If the hidden term is silently congealed,
The Yang tribulation holds no fear.
Beholding these meetings of departure and return,
Why linger in delay?
Transcending the body, yet the body remains—
True immortals meet with worthy companions.
Alternately tracing the mysteries within,
The limpid waves of the clear Han flow.
Change and decay turn like a wheel,
Yet the tree’s boughs remain unchanged.
With a tranquil heart, contemplate the Perfect,
Follow the course, comply with separation and union.
Response and resonance are ever connected,
The spirit’s ease reaches back to its origin.
Wandering in stillness, boundless,
Prolific thoughts penetrate the Nine Distances.
Flying roots scatter the leaves of mystery,
The principle returns—there is nothing else.
Ever recite the jade verses,
The numinous sound pierces the clouds and rosy dawn.
When the Jia-Shen calamity arrives,
Soar on wings to the Queen Mother’s abode.
Eternally enjoy without end,
Who knows the multitude of kalpas?
In the Seven Jeweled Grove of the Mystic Capital,
The Ten Flowers merge with the Miasma.
Purple mist crowns the numinous radiance,
The cloud capital adorns the jade slopes.
Above stands the Hall of Blessings and Virtue,
Palaces and chambers intermingle.
All are the faithful and devout,
True immortals, soaring celestial families.
The Three Realms open the path of mystery,
The Five Paths are pure and free from deviation.
Good conditions arise from the root,
Accumulating merit brings abundant fortune.
Drawn together, they follow in succession—
The Great Dharma is truly not in vain.
There are no ten-thousand-year mortals,
All share the same origin as the kalpa.
In this joyous world, so gentle,
Words become songs of praise.
This world’s joy is boundless—
What will the coming fate bring?
The Eight Observations arise from the gate of conditions,
Sin and fortune emerge from within.
At times, one sees the devoted,
Reflecting and awakening to the numinous.
For this reason, I now
Reveal the true and wondrous scripture.
As spoken in the scripture,
Remembering the kalpas, all receive glory.
Practice the Dao, uphold exhortations,
By the scripture, deliver this form.
Contemplate the roots of past lives,
Wash away and liberate the infant of former selves.
Transcend and pass beyond the Three Nets,
The Eight Difficulties thus obscured.

The soul returns to its settled essence,
The spirit grasps from this its glory.
Extinction and deliverance are like shedding a husk,
Vast and bright, one beholds the Eight Pures.
Turning the Wheel, one attains divine transcendence,
Through my refinement of the heart’s essence.
Receiving retribution without limit,
With resolve fixed, one enters the Garden of Fortune.
The seventy-two marks of excellence
All shine forth from within the body.
The nape bears the radiance of the Seven Treasures,
Illuminating the forms of all heavens.
Swift as the eight-scene chariot’s petals,
The wind circles the green-fringed disk.
Ascending into the Gate of the Profound Profound,
One awaits joy unending.
Wondrous communion transforms my spirit,
Vast and universal, its boundless merit.
The Dao accomplished at heaven and earth’s inception,
The Wheel’s transformations unfold through the ninefold.
Extinction and deliverance traverse life and death,
Each encounter with conditions has its origin.
Who awakens to the suffering of going and coming?
Form and soul have no beginning or end.
Accumulating goodness exalts the foundation of fortune,
The body is delivered from the blade of the Five Difficulties.
Freed from the Three Evil Paths,
One enters the tranquil hall with ease.
Contemplating deliverance across boundless realms,
Resolute thought evokes divine communion.
The Dharma conveys threefold revolutions,
Aiding my attainment of lofty transcendence.
Turning my great pillar-step,
I soar aloft to the Palace of the Supreme Ultimate.

Upon the completion of each chapter’s praise, all officials chant the Rite of Goodness and bow once. Then the master returns to his position, gives thanks, and utters the words of merit and gratitude:

The Most High Cavern of the Three Luminaries of the Mystic Capital, Disciple of the Supreme Three Caverns, Dharma Master of the Unsurpassed Three Caverns, upholding the Dao and its virtue, having received transmission of the Purple Void’s rites, the Master of Such-and-Such Peak and Such-and-Such Emperor, this humble Perfected of the Lesser Luminance, your servant So-and-So, bows twice and respectfully addresses the Most High, Limitless, Perfectly Real, Supreme, Unconditioned Great Dao, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue; the Highest Lord Lao of the Thirty-Six Revered Scriptures and the Great Dharma of the Mystic Center; the Perfected of the River’s Banks; the Master of Primordial Beginning; the host of great sages who have attained the Dao in the ten directions; and all the perfected lords of the Three Realms within and beyond:

By the accumulation of my fortunate goodness, I have encountered this luminous destiny. The Three Caverns have extended their transformation, delivering gods and humans. I have been favored by my teachers and perfected ones, receiving the transmission of secret wonders, saving people and aiding the state, propagating the teachings and establishing merit. Yet I constantly fear that my strength is weak for so heavy a task, and I may fail in my duty. Thus, I wish to transmit this to later learners, broadly continuing the Dharma gate.

Your disciples, So-and-So and others, with sincere devotion and earnest intent, have presented their words in faith, their resolve set on receiving and cultivating the teachings. Their humble sincerity cannot be refused. On such-and-such a day, in accordance with the codes of the Three Caverns, I have prepared the altar, revealed the petition, and entreated the perfected ones to descend and witness. May no obstacles arise, and may all accord with celestial rites. It seems fitting to transmit the teachings, and so, at this hour, the transmission is complete.

From beginning to end, the celestial officials, inner and outer officers and soldiers, and all subordinate officials have labored, communicating petitions and providing protection. Each has fulfilled their duties. In accordance with the statutes of the Perfected, their merits shall be assessed and rewarded.

In my ignorance, the profound principles are difficult to fathom. I have erred in advancing and transgressed in retreating, accumulating a thousand faults and ten thousand sins. I humbly beg for forgiveness and permission to renew myself. May all officials and disciples be granted blessings and protection, their goodness resounding through the Three Realms, their fortune dispelling the Nine Shadows. May the Dao’s qi sustain them, and the perfected spirits assist them. May their cultivation of the Dao be fulfilled, and may they attain divine transcendence. May their seven generations of ancestors ascend to heaven, and may the living and deceased alike receive grace. Should they remain in the world, may their fortune and emolument increase daily. May they become teachers of gods and humans, broadly propagating the Dao and benefiting all beings.

The Three and Five Perfected Officials within my body and those of your disciples, having completed their duties, now return to their palaces. I pray that the Most High, the Heavenly Worthies of Dao and Virtue, and all the revered ones will deign to accept this. As I now utter this petition, may it swiftly ascend. May you grant broad forgiveness. When the report is due, your servant So-and-So, with awe and reverence, bows twice to make this known.

Next, the officers and soldiers are dismissed.

The transmission of the scriptures and rites being complete, the celestial officials, officers, soldiers, and functionaries who emerged from within my body, along with the lords of merit and messengers who oversaw and regulated the proceedings, shall return to their palaces. Let none be misplaced, so that when summoned again, they may arrive as before.

This done, strike the teeth and swallow the saliva three times each.

Next, the incense burner is addressed:

Incense Officials and Messengers, Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, and all spirit officials attending the incense: May this place of transmission naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the host of perfected spirits gather here before the incense and fire. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions attend the fragrant smoke. May they convey all that I have petitioned directly to the Most High, Limitless, Jade Emperor before the Throne of the Perfected.

Each bows three times.

Next, the Hymn of Offering the Precepts is chanted.

The Precepts are the treasure of the body,
Through endless kalpas they bestow numinous destiny.
With empty heart one meets the void and stillness,
Through refined devotion and profound reflection.

Nine simurghs attend the jade chariot,
Eight phoenixes offer golden mushrooms.
Azure youths sing wondrous melodies,
Mysterious maidens chant pure verses.

Divine lords manifest radiant signs,
The Most High abides in profound tranquility.
Heavenly blossoms mingle with rising incense,
Dharma rain scatters numinous essence.

Through diligent toil one cultivates the Dao of life,
With ardent longing one lays the foundation for transcendence.
If one’s sincerity never falters,
The crane-drawn chariot will surely come.

Next, the Twelve Vows.
Next, the Hymn to the Study of Transcendence.
Next, exhaling at the door.
Next, taking leave of the Three Masters.
Next, with hymns of praise, leading to the Mysterious Master’s presence, dispersing according to the usual rites.

All spirit officials and disciples bow in gratitude and return to their positions.

Three days after receiving the Dao, disciples shall come together to bow in thanksgiving and present a memorial of gratitude.

For disciples unaccustomed to ritual procedures, a supervising master shall perform the following on their behalf:

Don the ritual vestments, arrange the incense and fire, and purify with ablutions. With hymns of praise, lead to the Earth Portal.

Next, exhaling at the entrance, face left of the door, strike the teeth three times, and exhale, saying:

The Four Luminaries’ Merit Officers and Messengers of the Way to Perfection, the Jade Lads who transmit words, and the Jade Maidens who attend in stillness—let them announce to the presiding deities of the Dao chamber: may the Primordial Qi of the Upper Origin enter my body. When this is complete, advance with the left foot, then follow with the right to ascend the altar.

Next, present incense at the imperial desk and exhale, saying:
This incense is the scattered radiance of jade blossoms, the congealed mist of the Nine Heavens. Its fragrant clouds weave a dense net, piercing straight through the Nine Heavens. May the true numina look down, may the immortals’ pendants approach the hall. The Golden Lad who attends the incense and the Jade Maiden who transmits words—convey this token incense to the presence of the Emperor on High. Let all that I now petition be granted as spoken.

Next, each returns to their proper position and visualizes the deities. All disciples and officials close their eyes and envision: the Ten Mountains of the Mysterious Capital and the Three Venerables; the Perfected of the Ten Directions and the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions; the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures seated to the left of the Celestial Worthies; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center seated to the right; Lord Lao, the Perfected of the River’s Edge, and Master Yin dwelling in the midst of the Void and Nonexistence; the Azure Dragon to the left, the White Tiger to the right, the Vermilion Bird in front, the Dark Warrior behind, guarding the four directions of the altar; thirty-six lions arrayed before the altar; the seven stars of the headscarf upon one’s own head; the five qi of the five viscera forming a net of luminous patterns covering the body; the Three Ones attending the scriptures, each with a thousand chariots and ten thousand riders; the heavens and earth each with eighteen thousand Jade Lads and Jade Maidens guarding the body—all distinctly arrayed in full.

Next, sound the Dharma drum thirty-six times.
Next, open the incense burner.

O Divine Perfected of the Five Elders of the Supreme Mystery and Primordial Origin, O Jade Lads and Jade Maidens of the Supreme Mystery who attend the incense to left and right, O Dragon-Tiger hosts of officials—we now report to the Supreme Mysterious Capital of the Great Lofty Heaven, the Jade Metropolis of the Supreme Mystery: having received the *Purple Void Treasure Record of the Venerable Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, and with the three-day period now complete, we bow in memorial to give thanks. May the spontaneous and perfectly true qi descend and permeate our bodies. Let all that we now petition ascend directly to the presence of the August Emperor of the Jade Capital of the Boundless Dao.

Each bows three times.

Next, kneel upright and sound the Dharma drum thirty-six times, then dismiss the deities according to the proper method.

With reverence, we now send forth from our bodies the Merit Officers and Clerks of the Five Agents; the Officers of the Three Heavens who enforce the law and transform yin and yang; the twelve Officers who deliver the Dao, dispel calamities, scatter misfortunes, and resolve adversities; the twelve Officers who govern duties, the Great General who establishes standards and supervises merit; the vanguard who effect merit, the rearguard who effect execution; the Commandant and Vice-Commandant of the Post Stations; the Inspectors of Merit of the Four Quarters; the Direct Messengers of the Supreme Immortals and Supreme Numinous Ones, the Orthodox Unity Merit Officers; the Left and Right Official Messengers; the Yin-Yang Deities of the Secondary Ranks; the Officers of the Chariot of Regulations; the Officers of the Rigorous Wind and Post Stations; the Officers who present memorials by post horse—two each.

Let those who emerge be clad in solemn attire, their caps and sashes hanging with pendants, their majesty arrayed in full. The Direct Merit Officer wears the cap that reaches to Heaven, a black single-layered robe; the Orthodox Unity Merit Officer wears the accumulated cap of the Vermilion Yang, a crimson single-layered robe; the Messengers wear the Nine Virtues cap, a five-colored robe of longevity, their waists girded with tiger tallies, each holding a jade tablet. The Direct Merit Officer stands at the upper position; the Orthodox Unity Merit Officer stands at the center; the Merit Officer who tends to illnesses guards the body; the Left Official Messenger, bearing the standard, stands in front; the Right Official Messenger, holding the banner, stands behind; the Yang Deity of Decision stands to the left, the Yin Deity of Decision to the right; the Upper Merit Officer stands at the upper position; the Middle Merit Officer stands at the center of the body; the Qi-Urging Merit Officer hastens the ten directions; the Upper Messenger gazes afar to the heavens above; the Middle Messenger surveys the eight directions; the Capital Messenger encircles the body; the Captain of the Gentlemen of the Interior, the Tiger Warriors who detect treachery, the mounted archers, the Chief of the Capital Officials, the Armored Soldiers of Heaven, the Heavenly Ding Warriors, the Officers who gather qi and consume qi, the Officers who gather spirits and consume spirits, the Officers who gather ghosts and consume ghosts, the Officers who gather deviance and consume deviance, the Officers who gather essences and consume essences, the Officers who gather poisons and consume poisons, the Officers who execute talismans and destroy shrines, the Officers of the Chariot of Regulations and the Red Talismans, the Officers of the Rigorous Wind and Post Stations, the Officers who present memorials by post horse, the Officers of the Flying Dragon Cavalry—all take their stations before, behind, to the left, and to the right.

When the Merit Officers and Messengers have completed their solemn preparations, they array their regalia and report to the Supreme Mystery.

The officials of the *Five Thousand Character Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the supervisors of the transcendents, the officers who oversee the fasts, the twenty-four districts established by the Heavenly Master, the thirty-six oratories of stillness, the seventy-two blessed lands, the three hundred sixty renowned mountains, the thirty-six thousand deities of the upper palaces of Kunlun and the like, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the Jade Armillary and Jade Balance, the Five Emperors of Heaven and Earth, the officials, generals, officers, and soldiers of the Three Realms, the Two Mysteries, the Three Origins, the Four Beginnings, the Four Quarters, the directional winds, the qi that infuses the stems and branches, the officers who examine and summon, the lords of the Nine Yi to the east, the Eight Man to the south, the Six Rong to the west, the Five Di to the north, the Three Qin in the center, the Hu, Yue, Yi, Qiang, and Cang peoples, the lords of the Five Peaks, the Four Waterways, the hills and marshes, the deities of all shrines, the lords of the high mountains, the mountains and rivers, the streams and valleys, the forests and groves, the Elders of the Mountains, the Twelve Stream Maidens, the original lords of the roots and origins, the officers of the altars of soil and grain—let all now don their solemn attire and, together with the Merit Officers, Messengers, and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers within our bodies, ascend to report to the Supreme Venerable of the Boundless Dao, the Celestial Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue; the thirty-six divisions of the Venerable Scriptures; the Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center; the Most High Lord Lao; the Perfected of the River’s Edge; Master Wen Shi; all the great sages of the Three Realms and Ten Directions who have already attained the Dao; and the boundless numinous deities within and beyond heaven and earth:

We, though our karmic fortune spans kalpas, have been born to encounter the transformation of the Dao, the imperial transmission of the true scriptures, and the orthodox Dharma that delivers beings. We follow only what is good, never scorning the humble or base. Having now participated in the initial Dharma, we cultivate, uphold, and maintain it. On such-and-such a day of such-and-such a month of this year, we received from Master So-and-So at such-and-such an abbey the *Purple Void Treasure Record* bound with azure silk and golden cords, along with the *True Scripture* in its upper and lower parts, the *Master He’s Chapter and Verse*, the *Essential Precepts of Xiang’er*, the *Visualization Charts*, the *Transmission Secrets*, the *Court Rituals*, and the *Fasting Methods*. With the three-day period now complete, we bow in gratitude and present a vermilion memorial to ascend to the Nine Heavens. May the Merit Officers, Messengers, and Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers swiftly transmit and present it for inspection. We respectfully request that the memorial be reviewed.

Upon opening the case to retrieve the memorial:

Newly initiated disciples of the Most High Dao, the Lofty Mystery, and the Supreme Purple Void—your humble servants [Names]—prostrate ourselves twice and reverently address the Most High Mysterious Primordial Lord, the Supreme Lord Lao, the Great Dharma Master of the Mystic Realm, the Perfected of the River’s Shore, the Venerable Master of Literary Beginnings, and the Supreme Perfected beneath the Jade Tablet:

We, your servants, are of the lowest earth, utterly foolish, dust-like in insignificance, and base in station. Yet across countless kalpas and assemblies, we have still served the Dharma Gate. The wondrous Dao delivers all beings, and the Most High extends transformation—only goodness is bestowed, none are cast aside. In recent years, we have participated in and received the Orthodox Dharma. Now, by the grace of our true master, the Venerable Master of [Sacred Peak], we have been entrusted with the *Azure Silk and Golden Cords*, the *Venerable Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, the *Secret Record of the Supreme Purple Void Celestial Writ*, the *Master He’s Chapter and Verse*, the *Essential Precepts of Xiang’er*, the *Visualization Charts*, the *Transmission Secrets*, the *Sublime and Wondrous True Scripture of the Western Ascension*, the *Six Jia Visualization Charts*, the *Jade Calendar of the Hidden Treasury*, the *Court Rituals*, and the *Fasting Methods*—all fully transmitted and conferred.

Reflecting on our own worthlessness—mere filth and vulgarity—we possess no heaven-endowed talent. Truly, we fear our cultivation and devotion may lack refinement, unworthy of bearing this burden. With trembling hearts, we examine ourselves, sweat mingling with dread, and vow to redouble our sincerity, forever pledging reverent adherence.

We humbly beseech the Perfected and Sages of the Highest Truth, the exalted and venerable of the Dao and its virtue, the majestic deities of the Three Caverns, and the officials of the Three Treasures: descend with true qi, bestow luminous numen, that our devotion may resonate and our merit be perfected. May demonic forces be subdued, the Dao’s transformation flourish, and our service to the state and salvation of beings be fulfilled. May the true spirits shelter and protect us, our merit and honor be shared, and may the nine generations of ancestors, the seven lineages, and all beings in the three paths and six destinies—wherever the divine power extends—all partake in blessed fortune.

With the three-day period now complete, we bow in gratitude and present a vermilion memorial to ascend to the Most High’s Court. We await the report with reverence. Your servants [Names], in utmost trepidation, prostrate ourselves twice, acknowledging our transgressions.

**Next: Three rounds of tooth-clicking to dispatch the memorial**

Your servants, through the mediation of the Perfected and the Celestial Officials, the Merit Officers, and the Flying Dragon Cavalry Officers, separately submit and announce: having newly received the scriptures and methods, and with the three-day period fulfilled, we have, in accordance with the Dharma, bowed in gratitude and presented a vermilion memorial on yellow silk to ascend to the Heavenly Court. We, who have presumptuously participated in the register of governance, are dull of ear and blind of eye, our scrutiny lacking acuity. The memorial we submit may contain errors—its ranks disordered, its characters misaligned, omissions or inversions, phrases disjointed, front mistaken for back, left for right. May the yin-yang spirit officials and messengers convey our words, the scribal clerks and calligraphic attendants accompany the memorial for verification, the Dragon-Headed Writing Knife correct the text, and the long-bristled, sharp-tipped brush confirm its propriety. Let no overseeing celestial official overlook any detail. Seal the memorial and ascend it directly to the Jade Steps before the Most High’s Golden Gate in the Great Clarity. May the left and right clerks, in orderly succession, transmit it through the ranks of officials. Let our requests be granted, our summons answered, our salvations fulfilled, and our petitions reach their destination. Should any subordinate officials, wayward spirits, or demonic thieves obstruct the memorial’s path in the cloud routes, consign them to the nearest prison and punish them according to the celestial statutes, to uphold the heavenly decree. We, prostrate at the left of the tablet, await the response of the Mysterious Grace.

**Copying the memorial and presenting it to the immortal officials**

Recite silently:
*By the might of the Numinous Treasure Great Emperor,*
*Descend swiftly from the Nine Heavens.*
*At the Jade Emperor’s command,*
*The cosmos trembles and the heavens manifest.*
*Governing the northern quadrant,*
*Commanding ghosts and immortals,*
*Thousands upon thousands,*
*Processions arrayed before me.*
*Banners lowered, eyes closed,*
*Fierce flames surge to the sky.*
*Dare any obstruct my path,*
*Or cast their gaze before me?*
*Seized and executed, sent to the eternal dungeon.*
*Every minor clerk, every divine immortal,*
*Follows this memorial straight to the Emperor’s presence.*
*Those who defy my command*
*Shall be reported to the Three Heavens.*
*Demons and drought spirits, bound and exiled,*
*Driven to the demonic realms.*
*The Four Numinous Beasts guard and protect,*
*Never leaving my side.*
*Sweep away demonic thieves,*
*Perfect the merit and fruition.*
*With the fast’s affairs concluded,*
*Declare the merit resplendent in purple.*
*Hasten! As the statutes decree!*

*In the chaos of the Primordial Supreme,*
*The Great Dao is boundless.*
*The divine soldiers receive their orders,*
*Soaring to seize and ascend to the Great Void.*

**Conclude the memorial’s incineration, rise, and return the documents to the officials**

The memorial’s presentation is complete. The Merit Officers and all divine attendants who emerged from your servant’s body shall return through the Gates of Myriad Wonders—those on the left to the left, those on the right to the right. Let the Chief Merit Officer lead and oversee their return to the palace chambers, ensuring no errors. When summoned again, they shall return as before.

**The Twelve Vows**

Replenish the incense burner. O Incense Officials, Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attendant spirit officials: may this place of transmission naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushrooms. May the hundred spirits and Perfected gather here before the incense and flame. May the jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions guard the fragrant smoke, conveying all that your servant has petitioned directly to the Most High, the Boundless Jade Emperor.

**Exiting the Hall**

The rite of prostration and memorial presentation for the transmission of the *Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue* and the *Purple Void* is now concluded.
