**The Supreme Alliance of the Three-Five Orthodox Unity Register-Inspection and Offering Rites**
*Compiled and edited by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting*

For all register inspections, the rites are customarily performed on *jiazi*, *gengshen*, one’s own life-day, the Three Assemblies, the Three Primes, or the last and first days of the lunar month, during the *mao* and *you* hours.

**Next: Kindling the Incense Burner**
The Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Five Numinous Venerable Lord, shall summon the Merit Officers and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, the Incense-Bearing Envoys, and the Three *Qi* Orthodox Deities. Hasten to report to the Three Heavens’ Supreme Mysterious Origin, the Orthodox Unity Dao Lord: "Your servant now enters the oratory to burn incense. On this auspicious day of the [such-and-such] month, in the [such-and-such] prefecture, county, village, and hamlet, I reverently follow the methods of the Former Masters to inspect the Orthodox Unity Alliance Register of the Upper Immortals and Upper Numinous Twenty-Four Grades, along with the generals, officers, and soldiers bestowed upon my person for self-protection. May the upright and true *qi* of the Eight Directions descend into my body, that I may swiftly ascend to present myself before the August Jade Emperor of the Supreme Perfection of the Limitless Dao."

The Celestial Master of [such-and-such] Oratory, the True Person of the Three-Five Step Net of Primordial Destiny of the Red Heaven, bows twice and respectfully addresses the Supreme Venerable Lord of the Great Dao of the Limitless Three Heavens of the Great Clarity, the Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Supreme Elder, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, the Hundred-Thousandfold *Qi* of the Elder of the Nine *Qi*, the Thousand-Two Hundred Official Lords of the Great Clarity before the Jade Throne of the Great Clarity: "Your humble servant, dull and unworthy, has been blessed across a thousand kalpas to partake in this pure transformation. By your sheltering grace, I have been granted officers and soldiers for my protection. Ever adhering to the ritual statutes, I inspect on auspicious days the Orthodox Unity Register of the Upper Immortals and Upper Numinous Generals bestowed upon me. The Merit Officers, Envoys, Generals, and Soldiers recorded in the register each hold their appointed duties, safeguarding my body, pacifying my spirit, and nurturing my nature. May the Three Corpses be cast down, all calamities dissolved, illnesses expelled within, and decrepitude repelled without. In due time, I shall report my merits and seek promotion, never daring to betray this trust. I humbly present this petition."

**Next: Striking the Ritual Drum Twenty-Four Times**

This臣, a humble sprout, has fortunately encountered this millennial opportunity. Prostrating, I have received the profound compassion of my revered master, who bestowed upon me the register of methods to defend and protect myself, granting me peace and security—an indebtedness beyond measure.

The generals, clerks, messengers, perfected officials, jade lads, jade maidens, clerks, soldiers, and troops under the twenty-four registers of the Upper Immortals and Upper Numinous Bureaus that I have received are hereby beseeched to act according to their respective duties, to bear commands and transmit the truth, to propagate the essentials of the Dao, and to encourage goodness. Should any subordinate clerks, inauspicious *qi*, rebellious evil, or treacherous demons—along with officials, slanderous individuals, or conspirators seeking to harm this臣—exist, the attending messengers shall immediately report to the Heavenly Bureau without concealment. From year’s end to year’s end, from month’s end to month’s end, from day’s end to day’s end, from hour’s end to hour’s end, cyclically without cease.

Let it be executed according to the method to safeguard this臣’s life, to avert calamity and transcend peril, to attain longevity and enduring vision, to stabilize the heart-spirit, and to align all endeavors with the perfected. In all travels and undertakings, may metal and stone open, water and fire aid, the August Heaven cover, the August Earth bear, the sun and moon illuminate, mountains and rivers connect. May all evil be subdued, and the myriad spirits obey. May this臣’s hundred passages flow with moisture, the five viscera generate fluids, true *qi* descend into the body, and the form be refined to transform its substance. When merit is accomplished and virtue perfected, may I ascend to heaven in broad daylight. At that time, I shall report my merits without failing in my demonstrated sincerity.

This臣, a late and shallow learner, foolish and dim, having reviewed the generals, clerks, soldiers, and troops, fears they may not conform to the proper forms or align in sequence, accumulating a thousand faults and ten thousand errors. I beseech your forgiveness, extending mercy even to the unenlightened, sparing me from punishment and penalty. With utmost reverence and trepidation, I bow my head and prostrate twice.

Next, swallow the *qi* three times and rise, kneeling lengthily to pray:
This臣 has completed the review of the register. All the aforementioned Upper Immortal Numinous Bureau merit clerks, messengers, generals, clerks, and soldiers shall return into this臣’s body, entering through the Gate of Myriad Subtleties. According to their respective positions, those on the left return to the left, those on the right return to the right, resting securely in the golden hall and jade chamber. Let the Direct Attendant Merit Clerks inspect and supervise, ensuring no errors in their protective encirclement. Let them surround and envelop, externally and internally, without transgressing the bounds of heaven and earth.

Next, recite the incense burner incantation. Then chant the *Receiving and Sending Hymn*, saying:

This method is most profound and wondrous,
Freeing your nine generations from servitude.
If unworthy ones receive it,
They sever themselves from the Dao.
Those not fit who rashly transmit it
Shall face interrogation in this life,
And upon death, fall into the Three Wretched Realms’ prisons,
With ten thousand kalpas of remorse to no avail.

After the *Exiting the Chamber Incantation*, declare:
Upon the completion of the register’s review, may this servant’s Three Masters attain the Dao, may the nine generations ascend to heaven, may the living reap blessings, may kindness and joy fill every countenance, may fathers be compassionate and children filial, and may all who study the Dao achieve immortality.

Thus concludes the *Rite of Register Review for the Alliance of Orthodox Unity under the Three and Five August Ones*.
