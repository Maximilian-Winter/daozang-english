### *The Northern Culmen Perfected Warrior’s Universal Compassion Dharma Repentance for Delivering the World*, Fascicle One

At that time, the Supreme Vermilion Script Emperor Lord and the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal’s Transformed Body were present in the Purple Tenuity Palace of the Northern Culmen Mysterious Heaven on the Zhongyuan Festival of the Longhan Kalpa’s first year. They convened the assembly of all the sagely beings of the heavens, the perfected of the ten directions, the flying heavenly spirit-kings, and the boundless host of immortals to examine the merits and transgressions of cultivators, the length of lifespans, the appointed times for the reckoning of sins and blessings among men and women of the ten-directional worlds, the retributions of life and death, and the causes and conditions of past lives.

Then a perfected one named Wondrous Conduct stepped forth from the ranks, bowed his head, and addressed the assembly: "In this degenerate age, ordinary beings fail to understand cultivation. They are beset by greed, anger, delusion, and attachment, their words at odds with their hearts. Enveloped in the afflictions of ignorance, they accumulate deep-rooted transgressions. Some suffer bodily illness, imprisonment, or adversity in their undertakings, their labors unfulfilled. After death, they fall into the various hells, where they face retribution for their karmic causes and conditions. By what means may they be delivered?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "Excellent is your question. In the beginning of the Longhan Kalpa, I was the Perfected One of the Great Beginning; during the era of the Middle Three Sovereigns, the Perfected One of the Great Primordium; and in the time of the Lower Three Sovereigns, the Perfected One of the Great Simplicity. When the Kaihuang Kalpa brought forth the world of men, I was the eighty-second transformation of the Mysterious Origin Sagely Ancestor in the Mysterious Heaven, where I cultivated the Dao and attained perfection. Moved by compassion for the foolish and deluded who accumulate evil and commit sins without hope of attaining immortality, I expounded the Ten Precepts of Cultivation to deliver the multitudes. Now, by upholding this wondrous teaching, they may escape all retribution."

Thereupon, Wondrous Conduct entreated, saying: "May the numinous text of the Ten Precepts be bestowed, proclaimed to gods and men, that all may practice and daily reap its benefits?"

Then the Heavenly Worthy, his countenance suffused with compassion, opened the numinous gateway and revealed the Ten Precepts, declaring: "Magnificent is your merit, Wondrous Conduct, to establish such wondrous causes for sentient beings! The body is the root of affliction, and transgressions arise from the heart. The Dao is the vessel of the Dharma; through repentance, one may cross to the other shore. Though sins accumulate like mountains, they dissolve with a single thought. If one upholds these precepts from beginning to end, the ranks of immortality may be attained.

**The First Precept:** Refrain from secret scheming and covert harm to others for personal gain.
**The Second Precept:** Refrain from killing living beings to sate one’s appetite.
**The Third Precept:** Refrain from licentiousness that corrupts one’s true nature and defiles the numinous qi.
**The Fourth Precept:** Refrain from undermining others’ achievements and sowing discord among kin and friends.
**The Fifth Precept:** Refrain from flaunting one’s talents, self-aggrandizement, and slandering the good and virtuous.
**The Sixth Precept:** Refrain from excessive drinking and consuming meat in violation of prohibitions.
**The Seventh Precept:** Refrain from insatiable greed and hoarding wealth without distribution.
**The Eighth Precept:** Refrain from associating with the unworthy and dwelling in defiled places.
**The Ninth Precept:** Refrain from disloyalty, impiety, faithlessness, and lack of benevolence.
**The Tenth Precept:** Refrain from frivolous speech and laughter, and conduct that deviates from truth.

Those who adhere to my teachings with unwavering resolve shall attain peace and happiness in this life and avoid suffering. If, on the Three Yuan Festivals, the Five La Days, the Jiazi and Gengshen days, or the Three Assemblies and Ten Auspicious Days, they prepare incense and flowers in Daoist temples or their own homes, repent with sincere hearts, and vow to reform their past misdeeds and cultivate henceforth, their dark records shall be erased, their names inscribed in the Crimson Registers. In this life, they shall receive blessings; after death, they shall ascend beyond."

Thereupon, Wondrous Conduct bowed his head in reverence, pledged eternal devotion, and disseminated the repentance rites among humankind.

**With utmost sincerity, each pays reverence and faithfully recites:**

**Invocation of Reverence**
**The Three Refuges**

**Seated Hymn**
**With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay homage:**

The Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Void and Spontaneity,
The Jade Clarity Lord and Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure,
The Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Virtue, the Most High Lord Lao.

**Hymn of Pacing the Void**
*The Supreme Ultimate divides into height and depth...*

At that time, the Perfected One Wondrous Conduct addressed the assembly of immortals: "In ancient times, our ancestral master, the True Primordial Lord of the Myriad Kalpas’ Transformed Teachings, the Supreme Void August Great Dao Lord of the Golden Portal, was the mysterious ancestor of the Great Dao and the root of the Three Powers. Before the Supreme Ultimate, there was only boundless emptiness. When the source of the Dao first stirred, the Mother of Qi coalesced in primordial chaos. Within the formless expanse, the first germ of existence took shape, and from it arose the true essence, spontaneously born. This was called the divine luminosity, and by force of naming, the Supreme Void.

Silently governing the mysterious transformations, the Dao steered the world. One qi divided into three, becoming the Mysterious, the Primordial, and the Beginning. The three qi blended, gradually manifesting as the origin of all phenomena and the root of all transformations. None knew its precedence, so it was forcibly named *Yuan* (Primordial); none knew its beginning, so it was forcibly named *Shi* (Beginning). Thus was born the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Beginning. The three qi generated one another, and the nine qi coalesced, giving rise to the heavens and completing the Three Realms. None knew its greatness, so it was forcibly called *Tai* (Supreme); none knew its height, so it was forcibly called *Shang* (Most High). Emerging from the boundless, it was called *Lao* (Ancient) when gazed upon; governing without self, it was called *Jun* (Lord). Across vast kalpas, it has opened the way of transformation and universally delivered gods and men.

Supreme is the Teaching Lord, the Northern Culmen Heaven-Securing, Blessing-Assisting, Obedience-Aiding Perfected Warrior, Numinous-Responsive, Fortune-and-Virtue True Lord, Jade Void Preceptor and Minister, Mysterious Heaven Emperor. His divine spirit was endowed with extraordinary gifts, and his merits were long established in majesty. When creation was divided, his virtuous power was already manifest in brilliance. Forsaking the honor of the Pure Joy Kingdom, he refined his true purity on Mount Wudang. After eighty-one transformations, he was titled Lord Lao. For forty-two years, he cultivated as the Dark Warrior. Aligned with the *Xu* and *Wei* constellations, he mastered the essences of water and fire. Enthroned in the *Ren* and *Gui* directions, he aided the generals of *Jia* and *Geng*. He has traversed the lower realms and enforced decrees in the celestial vault. His traces have repeatedly revealed his supreme divinity, and records of his deeds are fully set forth in the *Records of the Inauguration of the Sage*."

Profound and unfathomable, boundless and infinite, in ancient times he ascended in flight, vowing to broadly unfold his great resolve: that the good and evil of all beings would be made equal in their very bodies, and that those who cultivate and refine in the world would together ascend to the wondrous fruit. He safeguards the ailing and enables them to recognize weariness, heals the sighted and lets them discern deceit. He descends grain to relieve famine, bestows talismans to dispel pestilence, drives away demons and malevolent spirits, resolves grievances and grudges, appears upon the sea to rescue the imperiled, and grants jujubes to secure posterity. Those who see their descendants flourish are admonished to abstain from killing; those who enjoy peace and prosperity awaken to the truth and release living creatures. His roaming presence grants spears to repel fierce barbarians; his celestial stem arrows slay rebellious bandits. Those who serve him sincerely find no request unanswered; those who heed his loyal warnings turn peril into safety. We, your ministers, who expound the immortal lineage, are truly filled with joy and gratitude. Reverently unfolding the treasure of his mysteries, we look up to receive his numinous radiance. Bowing our heads in devotion, we wholeheartedly pay homage.

With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Dharma Lord, Jade Purity Preceptor, Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Holy Father, Radiant Perfected Great Emperor.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Holy Mother, Effulgent Perfected Supreme Immortal.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Holy Preceptor, Abundant Heavenly Great Emperor.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Purple Profundity Primordial Lady of the Western Realm.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Portal’s Incarnation.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Primordial Manifest Response.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of Grand Purity’s Numinous Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Jade Perfection.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of Sunlight Revealing Auspiciousness.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of Martial Brilliance’s Responsive Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of the Void Star’s Responsive Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of the Perilous Star’s Responsive Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of Celestial Unity’s Responsive Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of Grand Unity’s Responsive Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow in worship to the Heavenly Worthy of the Chronogram Star’s Responsive Transformation.

With devoted hearts, we submit our bodies, surrender our spirits, and yield our lives to the Mysterious Thearch, whose numinous efficacy and transformations manifest among the sacred ones of all heavens. We earnestly reflect upon the people below, dwelling in the dusty net of the world, unaware of past karma, seldom investigating prior causes. Since the world receded from primordial chaos, true simplicity has swiftly vanished; as customs have advanced beyond the Deer Wilds, artifice and deceit have arisen in succession.

Perilous schemes are covertly devised in mechanisms of intrigue;
Living beings are stealthily cast into snares and pitfalls.
Pursuing the perverse and corrupting the upright,
Obscuring right to follow wrong,
Boasting and flaunting to mock the seasoned,
Sunk in dissipation and consuming defiled offerings.
Greed and lust run unchecked,
Associations teem with folly.
The Five Constants are submerged, and names and duties gradually eroded;
The One Nature is benighted, and actions truly deluded.
The seven emotions surge in tumultuous contention,
The ten karmic deeds multiply in profusion.
Weighing every fraction, cycling through kalpas uncounted—
What one suffers arises from what one has accumulated,
Its origin traced to its causes.
If one does not encounter good conditions,
How can one repent and confess past obstructions?

We reverently receive the sacred scripture’s admonition:
“Fortune and misfortune have no gate; they are summoned only by oneself.
The retribution of good and evil follows like a shadow.”
We respectfully consult the *First Precept of Cultivating the True*:
“One must not secretly plot with malice, harming others to benefit oneself.”

We deeply fear that since former lives and within this present existence,
the disciple [Name] has boasted of ability to seek victory,
harbored calculations and concealed stratagems,
outwardly complied while harboring dissent,
maintained a gentle countenance while inwardly nursing cruelty.
Private thoughts are poisonous and oppressive,
resentments and transgressions accumulate.
One treats the people of heaven as lightly as cutting reeds,
disrupts state governance, and gradually undermines the moral and legal order.
Rewarding what is not righteous,
Punishing the innocent.

Lurking to seize grain and wealth, harboring secret intent to plunder;
coveting rank and office, inwardly nurturing treacherous designs.
Flattering the rich and powerful, oppressing the lowly and humble.
Promoting the crooked while suppressing the upright,
concealing what is right while scrutinizing what is wrong.
Shifting blame and claiming credit,
shedding guilt and selling malice.
From past deeds to the present life,
one has amassed resentment and slander,
unexpectedly incurring misfortune and turmoil.
Upon death, one falls into hell,
suffering endless torment for kalpas.
When the suffering ends, one is reborn,
only to enter the evil destinies.
When the retribution is exhausted, one returns,
born again into this world.
Yet the residual effects of past karma remain,
and the cycle of retribution continues unabated.

Now, having heard the sutra’s teachings,
one is struck with terror and alarm.
Respectfully before the sacred presence,
we humbly offer repentance.
Let each person reverently bow in devotion,
with sincere hearts, we pay homage.

With sincere hearts, we pay homage to the Most Venerable of the Formless Beginning.

The homage to the Heavenly Worthies and Sacred Ones now complete,
we once more devote our whole hearts,
gazing afar toward the divine abodes.
We take refuge in the Purple Sovereign’s Palace of Heavenly Unity and True Felicity,
the Court of Primordial Harmony and Transmigration,
and the Northern Culmen’s Hall of Protective Sagacity,
along with all the perfected immortals.

Today, the assembly of this ritual site
reverently invokes the Teaching Master,
the Northern Culmen’s Heavenly Guardian of Sagely Assistance and Compliance,
the True Martial and Efficacious Lord of Blessing and Virtue,
the Jade Void Preceptor, the Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.
May radiance suffuse the cinnabar towers,
auspicious responses fill the azure heavens,
illuminating the mortal realm,
and abundantly bestowing grace and favor.

Now, on behalf of [Name],
we seek repentance for the transgressions of the First Precept:
secret plotting with malice, harming others to benefit oneself.
From past lives to the present,
the residual calamities of former kalpas,
extending upward to ancestors,
and downward to descendants.
Some have recklessly harmed living beings,
others have wielded power to slay creatures.
Some have acted contrary to right principle,
flattering and employing deceitful schemes.
Some have envied the worthy and resented the capable,
diminishing others to benefit themselves.
Outwardly appearing amiable and admirable,
inwardly harboring perversity and malice.
Sending them to manage granaries, only to set traps;
pushing them into wells, then casting stones.
Bullying the orphaned and widowed,
cruelly oppressing the meek and mediocre.
Smiling while concealing daggers,
shooting hidden arrows from the eyes.
Sins are enumerated,
evils have filled the measure,
disrupting the spirit officials,
who ceaselessly record the transgressions.

Now, relying on the power of repentance,
we pray for forgiveness and absolution.
We look upward to the perfected ones,
entreating them to proclaim grace upon the world,
and command the Court of Primordial Harmony and Transmigration,
the Northern Culmen’s Hall of Protective Sagacity,
and the Nine Palaces of the Three Origins,
along with all the celestial bureaus and offices.
May the celestial officials, immortal officers,
spirit officials, and true lords,
the assisting and patrolling attendants,
widely extend their compassion,
and grant absolution.

The repenting disciple [Name] and the assembly of fellow practitioners,
abiding by the mysterious statutes,
entering the Dao and attaining the true precepts,
shall practice non-action,
and diligently cultivate the Way.
We vow that from this day forward,
we shall uphold loyalty and integrity,
retreat to humility and reverence,
cherish all beings and pity all life,
regarding others as ourselves.
With empty minds and sincere hearts,
dare we harbor the thoughts of wolves glancing back?
Holding our breath and concentrating our spirit,
shall we emulate the sparrow’s gratitude in offering?
Having thus confessed,
we now present this repentance.

We humbly pray that the celestial officials inscribe our names in the register of destiny,
and the earthly scribes erase our transgressions from the ledger.
May our bodies be at peace and our lives secure,
our aspirations fulfilled and our spirits clear.
May the seven generations of ancestral souls
eternally attain blessed fruits;
may the obstacles and afflictions of three lifetimes
be entirely eradicated.
May we always serve the true and orthodox,
forever follow the mysterious teaching.
Through these benefits,
may all be adorned with splendor,
the sacred peaks rise ever higher,
and the imperial domain stand firm forever.
May the myriad peoples turn their robes in admiration,
and the hundred barbarians come bearing caps and sashes.
May our longevity rival the Southern Mountains,
and all look up to the one who brings prosperity.

The stars pay homage to the North Star,
the tripod brings the Four Seas to peace without peril.
May all sentient beings together ascend the Dao’s shore.

*Beginning of the Second Scroll of the Northern Dipper True Martial Universal Compassion Salvation Dharma Repentance*

**Pacing the Void**

At that time, the Wondrous Practice Perfected One addressed the assembled immortals, saying: According to the *Scripture of the Original Conduct of the Cavernous Truth*, the Jade Emperor is the progenitor of primordial qi and the root of creation.
In stillness, he is sagely—this is the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning;
in movement, he is numinous—this is the Jade Sovereign of the August Heaven.
Dwelling in the Jade Clarity Palace’s Hall of Luminous Communication, he governs the myriad heavens and nurtures all beings.
Lord of the ten thousand transformations, source of creation.
In heaven, he is the supreme among all sages;
in the world, he is the master of all teachings.

As for the Venerable Lord Lao, he is the incarnate form of the Dao, his names and titles boundless.
Utterly true, supremely sagely, fundamentally formless—
when dissolving, he becomes qi; when resting, he becomes human.
At times, within the Great Void, he condenses into his true countenance,
his body vast beyond measure, his marks of excellence complete,
with nothing above to grasp and nothing below to tread.
At times, upon the Cloud Blossom, his body gleams like gold,
attended by lofty immortals, revered by the hundred spirits.
At times, seated within a lotus, he wears a crown of the Seven Luminaries’ intricate radiance,
draped in a mantle of nine-hued parted silk,
a halo encircling his neck, illuminating heaven and earth,
abiding in a jeweled terrace and golden hall, within curtains of pearls and jade.
The myriad emperors pay homage, divine soldiers guard his chariot.

At times, his golden visage and jade form are clad in yellow robes and embroidered mantles.
At times, he dons plain garments and a dark cap, riding a crimson-maned white horse.
At times, he descends to govern the Ten Heavens, sealing and overseeing the myriad people,
dwelling in the Purple Tenuity’s Hook and Chen Chambers as the Heavenly August Emperor.
At times, through the seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, his transformations are boundless—
this is the qi of the Golden Gate returning, refined anew to receive the essence of soaring, mysterious, and spiritually penetrating flight.
Thus, he manifests as True Martial.

His spiritual penetrations are free and unhindered, appearing in response to karmic conditions.
He can be white or black, square or round,
able to bend or stretch, lengthen or shorten,
age or rejuvenate, be one or become ten thousand.
In all directions and reversals, his form knows no constancy.
From ancient times to the present, through successive dynasties, he expounds the teachings,
guiding the nine realms and delivering boundless beings.

We, your servants, have accumulated many karmic conditions across lifetimes,
and are fortunate to have personally encountered this teaching.
Having studied the scriptures in detail and formed good karmic affinities,
we revere the Supreme Perfected and know the source of our return.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay reverence.

With sincere hearts, we bow to the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Self-So of the Void.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy, the Dao Lord of the Jade Clarity.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Celestial Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue, the Venerable Lord Lao.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the August Heavenly Sovereign of the Mysterious Heaven, the Jade Void Preceptor.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Sacred Father, the Radiant Perfected Emperor.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Sacred Mother, the Jade Perfected Immortal.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Sacred Preceptor, the Abundant Heavenly Emperor.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Purple Profundity Primordial Lady of the Western Realm.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Gate’s Manifestation.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Origin’s Manifest Response.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Grand Clarity’s Numinous Transformation.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Lofty Jade Perfection.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Sun’s Auspicious Radiance.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Martial Star’s Responsive Manifestation.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Void Star’s Responsive Manifestation.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Perilous Star’s Responsive Manifestation.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Celestial One’s Responsive Manifestation.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Grand One’s Responsive Manifestation.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Chronographic Star’s Responsive Manifestation.

With sincere hearts, we take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life,
to the manifest and responsive numinous Perfected Ones and Supreme Sages of the Dark Emperor.

Your servants reverently receive the teachings bequeathed by the Supreme:
"All who are born between heaven and earth differ in good and evil,
each according to the karmic conditions of their former lives.
Cultivate goodness, and goodness will arrive; cultivate blessings, and blessings will come.
As a shadow follows form, as an echo responds to sound.
Awakened, one perceives the Dao; deluded, one dwells in the dust.
Like a precious pearl, it illuminates whatever it reflects;
like a bright mirror, black and white are naturally revealed.
If one cultivates the Ten Good Deeds, one will move the heavenly spirits,
who will protect and uphold one’s family, ensuring prosperity for future generations,
with clothing and food naturally abundant and longevity without limit.
If one cultivates the Ten Evils, malevolent spirits will descend and attach themselves,
bringing suffering and illness to the body, causing one to revolve through rebirths,
receiving all manner of evil retributions."

According to the *Second Precept of Cultivating the Truth*: "One must not kill living beings to sate one’s appetite."
Yet we, your disciples, have strayed from our original true nature, our hundred thoughts all misguided,
seeking the richness of flavors to please the palate,
pursuing the delight of the heart’s satisfaction.
We hunt beasts that flee into the forests, search out birds that fly in the wilds.
We ride with bows, shooting through the mountains; we cast nets, sinking them into the depths of waters.
We do so under the pretext of offering medicines to the spirits,
or to flatter officials and curry favor with the powerful.
Boiling, butchering, roasting, frying, simmering, grilling—
how could we consider the revolutions through evil destinies?
How could we know that humans and other beings share a single path?
Some may be our kin, transformed by karmic retribution;
others may be our relatives, receiving the fruits of their sins.
We consume their flesh, desiring to nourish our own bodies,
yet fail to recognize them, unable to feel compassion for their suffering.
The more we kill, the more our actions become transgressions.
All these karmic deeds manifest in the present life:
our bodies are wracked with illness, our lifespans cut short.
Upon death, we fall into hell, suffering for kalpas without end.
When our suffering is exhausted, we are reborn, entering evil destinies.
When our retribution is complete, we return to this world,
yet the residual misfortunes of past karmic retribution remain,
and the cycle of suffering continues unabated.

Now, having heard the scriptures’ teachings, we probe our hearts in trepidation.
Before the sacred presence, we humbly offer our repentance.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay reverence.

With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Unoriginated.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Unbounded.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Uninterrupted.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Symbolic Origin.

With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Teaching the Departure from Being.
With sincere hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Inexhaustible Virtue.

Heavenly Worthies and Supreme Sages, our reverence and recitation now complete,
we once more devote our whole hearts, gazing afar toward the divine precincts.
We take refuge in the Purple Sovereign, the Perfected Ones of the Heavenly Celebration Palace,
the Court of Primordial Harmony and Transcendent Judgment,
and the Assembly of True Immortals of the Northern Culmen’s Protective and Sagely Sanctuary.

Today, the great assembly of this ritual site humbly invokes the Teaching Master,
the Northern Culmen’s Heaven-Pacifying, Assistance-Granting, True Martial, Numinous-Responsive,
Blessed and Virtuous Perfected Lord,
the Jade Void Preceptor, the Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.

We prostrate ourselves, praying that You may manifest Your presence with phoenix-borne chimes,
mounting dragons and riding phoenixes,
that Your numinous responsiveness may shine forth,
universally saving living beings.
On behalf of disciple so-and-so, we beseech You to address the transgressions confessed above—
the sins of the second precept: killing and harming living beings to sate the palate.

Whether from past lives or this present existence,
whether bequeathed calamities from former kalpas,
extending upward to ancestors and forebears,
or downward to clan and kin—
whether by spoken command or verbal incitement to kill,
whether by raising livestock for slaughter,
whether by hand-strangling or foot-trampling to kill,
whether by witnessing, hearing, or acting to kill,
whether by intentional or accidental killing,
whether by cruelty, malice, or poison,
whether by wanton harm to the innocent,
or by seeking fine delicacies,
greedily savoring flesh and blood—
the sins are enumerated in detail,
the evil has filled to overflowing,
disturbing the numinous authorities,
endlessly recorded and compiled.

Now, by the power of this repentance, we humbly beseech that forgiveness be granted and mercy be made manifest. May the Supreme Perfections proclaim grace, commanding all under their jurisdiction—examiners of officials, examiners of clerks, examiners of soldiers, examiners of scholars, and all celestial bureaus, record-keepers, and masters of the registers—to widely extend compassion and bestow absolution.

The repentant disciple, along with the assembly of the Dharma, vow to uphold the mysterious statutes, enter the Dao, ascend to perfection through the precepts, practice hidden virtue, and broadly deliver all beings. From this day forward, we swear to harbor kindness and benevolence, devoting ourselves to the cultivation of goodness. We shall dismantle the fences and dissolve the nets, grieving for the lives of all beings, ever holding thoughts of rescue; loving them as our own bodies, never indulging the desire to kill or harm.

Having thus confessed and repented, we now prostrate ourselves, praying that golden scriptures bestow the blessing of protection, and jade tablets grant the joy of peace. May the sins of intentional and accidental killing be erased, and the accumulated enmities of karmic retribution be uprooted. May our human forms be transformed, freed from karmic obstructions. May all transgressions of requital be thoroughly cleansed, and both the manifest and hidden realms be at peace. May we forever serve the Supreme Perfection and eternally follow the mysterious teachings. Through these benefits, may all be adorned with splendor.

Above, we pray for the exaltation of the sacred tripod and the flourishing of the golden lineage. May lords and ministers exert themselves to the utmost in service; may officials uphold integrity and offer loyalty. Entrusted with impartial governance, may they discourse on the Dao and govern the state without deviation; in administering policies, may they bring peace to the people and abundance to the multitudes. May all sentient beings together ascend the shore of the Dao.

*Beginning of the Third Scroll of the Northern Dipper True Martial’s Universal Compassion Salvation Dharma Repentance*

**Pacing the Void**
At that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct addressed the assembled immortals: "The Three Treasures possess great golden scriptures, and the primordial qi divides into the Three Pure Ones, issuing forth as the titles *Tai Chu*, *Ming Xing*, and *Xuan Ji*. In the vast chaos, the Celestial August One established the Five Kalpas: *Long Han*, *Chi Ming*, *Shang Huang*, *Yan Kang*, and *Kai Huang*. At that time, the light of heaven was undivided, and the clear and turbid were not yet separated. Thus, the Three Elders each distributed the primordial qi, transforming and giving birth to the Four Spirits to stabilize the four directions, encompassing the six harmonies. The sun and moon moved within them, evolving and completing the myriad things.

Xuan Wu is the qi of Heavenly One, the transformation of the Five Spirits, the Elder Lord, and the Yin of Heavenly One. As recorded in the *Hun Dun Chi Wen*, the Dark Emperor is the transformed body of the Primordial Beginning, a separate embodiment of the Great Ultimate. During the era of the Upper Three Sovereigns, he descended as the Perfected One of the Great Beginning; in the Middle Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected One of the Great Origin; and in the Lower Three Sovereigns, as the Perfected One of the Great Simplicity. By the time of the Yellow Emperor, he descended to the Supreme Heaven. At the beginning of the *Kai Huang* kalpa, he descended into the world. In the first year of the *Purple Cloud* era, corresponding to the *jia-chen* year, on the third day of the third month—the *wu-chen* day, *jia-yin* hour, and *geng-wu* time—he embodied the essence of the Great Yang, entering the womb of Queen *Shan Sheng* of the *Jing Le* Kingdom. After fourteen months of gestation, he was born as the eighty-second transformation of the Most High.

The *Jing Le* Kingdom, a land of immortals beyond the sea beneath the *Kui* and *Lou* stars, corresponds above to the *Long Bian Fan Du* Heaven. The Dark Emperor emerged from his mother’s left side. At the moment of his birth, rare fragrances and auspicious clouds filled the air, and the earth turned golden. At seven, he observed all things with profound insight, his mind set on the Dao, his aspirations aligned with the Great Void. He vowed to serve the heavens and universally bless the people. At fifteen, he bid farewell to his parents, received the *Wuji Supreme Dao* from the Purple Mystery Lord, crossed the Eastern Sea, traversed the *Yi* and *Zhen* constellations, and descended to Mount Wudang, where he cultivated the Dao for forty-two years. Upon achieving perfection, he ascended to heaven in broad daylight. The Jade Emperor enfeoffed him as Xuan Wu. Five hundred years later, he gathered the true essences of *Kan* and *Li*, returning to the root and restoring the mandate. Above, he became a minister of the Three Realms; below, he became one of the Ten Heavenly Great Saints. Thus, his name was gloriously proclaimed for countless kalpas, equal in duration to heaven, earth, sun, and moon. Such was the fulfillment of his fruition.

We, your servants, knowing cause and recognizing effect, are moved by virtue and covered by grace. From the beginning of time and before heaven, from the end of one kalpa to the start of another, we have long labored under creation, awaiting your shaping and completion. We dare to offer the devotion of the bean to the sun, wholeheartedly revering and aspiring, with single-minded devotion, to bow in homage to the exalted Perfected Ones. With devoted hearts, we pay homage:

We reverently bow to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Natural.
We reverently bow to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Jade Clarity Dao Lord.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue, the Most High Lord Lao.
We reverently bow to the Jade Void Preceptor and Minister, the Dark Heavenly Emperor.
We reverently bow to the Sacred Father, the Radiant Perfected Great Emperor.
We reverently bow to the Sacred Mother, the Jade Perfected Immortal.
We reverently bow to the Sacred Preceptor, the Abundant Heavenly Emperor.
We reverently bow to the Purple Mystery Primordial Lady of the Western Land.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Palace’s Transformed Body.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Manifest Response of the Primordial.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Transformation of the Great Clarity.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Highest Jade Perfection.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Sun’s Auspicious Light.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Martial Star’s Response and Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Void Star’s Response and Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Danger Star’s Response and Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Heavenly One’s Response and Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One’s Response and Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Morning Star’s Response and Transformation.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts, take refuge in the body, take refuge in the spirit, take refuge in the life of the Dark Heaven’s manifest numinous transformations and all the exalted sages.

We have heard the Most High’s teachings: 'All worldly beings, from the moment they receive life, have their good hearts assailed by external forms and overwhelmed by love and desire. Thus, they obscure good deeds and accumulate evil affinities. If one can withdraw from activity and return to tranquility, preserving inner awareness, realizing that emptiness is not form and that the thought of form is emptiness, one will not commit the transgressions of lust and desire, but awaken to the Dao of the six qi. One should constantly examine body and mind, ever wary of faults. Upon encountering the scriptures and precepts, one should always hold reverence and caution, never entering the demonic realm or falling into evil paths.'"

We now examine the Third Precept of Cultivating the True: "One must not indulge in lewdness and debauchery, defiling and profaning the numinous qi."

Yet this disciple, so-and-so, has let the mind-monkey run wild with desire and the intent-horse gallop unchecked. The ears, attuned to the sounds of pipes and drums, rejoice without cease; the eyes, captivated by the hues of kingfisher feathers and golden treasures, harbor thoughts that never fade. Delighting in splendor and luxury, craving the rare and exquisite, one wallows in dissipation and excess, failing to secure the inner chamber of the household. Drunken dancing and singing, revelry beyond the home—wandering through streets and alleys—one neglects the withering of spirit and vitality, exhausting sinew and strength to the point of fatigue. Like leaves falling from a withered root, like ashes scattered and smoke dispersed, illness clings with labored breath, and the wasting curse of *chuanshi* claims one untimely. The human Dao is forsaken, the ghostly gate engulfed. Scarcely can one be delivered; in vain, one sighs in lament.

All these past transgressions manifest in this present life. In conduct, calamity and misfortune arise; in others’ eyes, one is despised and shunned. In death, one plunges into hell, suffering through long kalpas. When suffering ends, one is reborn, only to enter evil destinies. When retribution is exhausted, one returns to this world, yet due to past karma, residual misfortune remains, and the cycle of suffering persists.

Now, having heard the scriptures’ admonitions, the heart trembles in alarm. Before the sacred presence, we humbly offer repentance. With wholehearted reverence, we bow in faith and devotion:

With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Dao Gathered in Emptiness.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Spirit United with Non-Being.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Clarity and Stillness.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Creation and Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Tranquility Embracing Stillness.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Precious Radiance of Emptiness.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Sound Crowned in Vastness.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Unresponding and Ever-Changing.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Supple and Uninterrupted.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous and Unconditioned.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Yet Veiled.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Strong and Unceasing.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Fullness Yet Void.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Harmony and Pervasive Constancy.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Ever-Manifesting Illumination.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Impartial Governance.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Profoundly Rooted Foundations.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Compassionate Bestowal.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Beautiful and Flowing Speech.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Benevolence Advancing the Good.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Solemnly Spreading Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Greatly Planning the Difficult.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Peacefully Upholding Harmony.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Sincerity Unmoved.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Learning Surpassing the Multitude.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Impartial Assistance to All Beings.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Wisdom and Multifaceted Governance.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Modeling the Profound and Distant.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Accord Returning to All Things.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Goodness Without Contention.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Transformation Without Refusal.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Subtle and Near-Sacred.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Name Unfading.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Perception Without Desire.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Sacred Extending Grace.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Virtue and the Great Mystery.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the True and Ever-Joyous.

Heavenly Worthies and Exalted Sages, our reverent recitations now complete, we once more devote our whole hearts, gazing afar toward the divine abodes. We bow in homage to the Purple Sovereign of the Heavenly One’s Palace of True Felicity, the Court of Primordial Harmony and Karmic Adjustment, the Northern Culmen’s Hall of Protective Sagacity, and all the perfected immortals therein.

Today, the great assembly of this Daoist sanctuary humbly invokes the Teaching Master, the Northern Culmen’s Heaven-Pacifying, Sagely-Assisting, and Blessing-Conferring True Martial Spirit-Efficacious and Virtue-Rich Perfected Lord, the Jade Void’s Preceptor and Mysterious Heavenly Thearch. We pray that the sacred sword cross the heavens and banners escort the divine chariot, that vast vows be fulfilled and boundless salvation extended.

Now, on behalf of disciple so-and-so, we seek repentance for the transgressions of the Third Precept—lewdness and debauchery defiling the true and profaning the numinous qi. From past lives to this present existence, from lingering misfortunes of former kalpas, extending upward to ancestors and forebears, downward to clan and kin—some, upon seeing beauty, fix their minds on greed and defilement; some, oppressing the poor and humble, seize and harm others; some, sowing discord between mother and child, plunder men and women; some, severing bonds of kinship, bewilder and corrupt the worthy and good. They expose the Three Luminaries to filth, defile the myriad sages, turn from the true Dao, and recklessly devise wicked schemes. Their true qi dissipates, their numinous essence grows dim and turbid. Their sins, enumerated like branches, have amassed to fill the measure of evil. They disturb the numinous bureaus, whose records of transgressions never cease.

Now, relying on the power of repentance, we gaze upward in hope of proclaimed mercy. We pray that the august decree be issued to the True Bureau of Karmic Examination, the Patrol and Inspection Offices, the Departments of Transgression, Punishment, and Record-Keeping, and all the great deities, that they widely extend compassion and grant absolution. For the repentant disciple so-and-so and the assembly of fellow practitioners, we vow to uphold the mysterious precepts, enter the Dao, and ascend to perfection. We shall practice gentleness and weakness, never engaging in wickedness or deceit. From this day forward, we swear to banish all thoughts of desire within and cease all reckless actions without. We shall regard others as ourselves and value virtue above beauty. We shall preserve the primordial qi, not daring to harbor the slightest deceit in our hearts.

Having purified and cleansed the true heart, all myriad cares dissolve, and one guards the self in stillness. By this very confession and revelation, we now present our repentance.

We humbly pray that the majestic might of the Heaven, Earth, and Water Palaces will clear their wrath, and that the upper, middle, and lower *corporeal spirits* will release their transgressions. May the body thrive with settled qi, and the will attain its desires as vows are fulfilled. May the wondrous transformation widely unfold, eternally bestowing boundless blessings; may the supreme numen remain unobscured, fully granting its encompassing protection and grace.

Ever revering the Most Perfect, we shall forever follow the Mysterious Teachings. Through these benefits, may all be adorned with majesty. May the realm flourish in prosperity, and the people attain peace and stability. May we sit free from the turmoil of defiance, and walk in the joy of undisturbed repose. Rejoicing in our vocations and dwelling in tranquility, may no deceitful or rebellious habits arise. Praying for eternal longevity, what fear shall we have of the alarm of war-horses? May all sentient beings together ascend the shore of the Dao.

**Pacing the Void**

At that time, the Wondrous Conduct Perfected addressed the assembly of immortals, saying: In ancient times, the Most High Lord of the Primordial Beginning was born before the Great Non-Being, receiving the qi of spontaneity. Profound and serene, boundless and unfathomable, none knew its limit. When heaven and earth collapsed and the kalpa’s reckoning reached its end, the body of the Heavenly Worthy alone endured, indestructible. Sometimes dwelling above the Jade Capital, sometimes in the wilds of Qiongsang, he transmitted the secret Dao, calling it *Opening the Kalpa to Save Beings*. Yet the opening of the kalpa was not a single occasion.

Originally, in the first year of the Dragon Han era, the Most High divided his body and descended upon the Central Land of Great Blessing, revealing the True Writ in Red Script to transform the people of the realm, so that all attained longevity. Later, in the Southern Dipper’s Land of Vermilion Brightness, he revealed the True Writ of Fire Refinement, thus named the Court of Cavernous Yang, where flowed a Pool of Flowing Fire. All who refined their forms within it turned golden. Above stood the Crimson Mound’s abode, governing generation and transformation.

Again, in the Eastern Dipper’s Azure Vault of the Floating Black Realm, he inscribed the True Writ upon the Forest of Empty Azure, whereupon it became characters of purple. As the wind passed through the forest, it produced sound; birds that ate its leaves grew patterned plumage. Those who obtained their feathers could then fly.

Its people attained long life, dwelling in peace and non-action. Again, in the Western Dipper’s Wei Luo World, within the Land of Xi Na Yu, he revealed the True Writ upon the Floating Luo Peak to deliver the people of that realm. A jade pool spontaneously generated golden essence, its flowing radiance drawn by all who approached. Those who bathed in its waters emanated golden light, rivaling the brilliance of heaven. Further, in the northern Land of Yu Dan, he revealed the True Writ within the Cavernous Spirit Abbey to deliver the multitudes. Beneath it lay the Frigid Pool of Numinous Springs, its pure currents flowing naturally. All who drank therefrom knew no end to their days. Within the Five Lands, all received the teachings of the Supreme Numinous Treasure, thereby attaining long life. Thus were the Five Elder Thearchs commanded to guard the Five Directions, establishing the Dao and founding its teachings, harmonizing and pacifying all beings.

We, your servants, reverently hear that the Heavenly Worthy, the Most Sagely, extends the transformation of great compassion, creating and establishing heaven and earth, dividing and ordering the Three Powers, granting birth among humankind—yet none know their origin. Gazing upon the sacred canons, we are deeply indebted to this boundless grace. With utmost sincerity, we prostrate ourselves, bodies and minds wholly devoted. Bowing our heads to the Lofty Perfected, we take refuge and pay reverence.

With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Chaos and Spontaneous Arising.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Jade Clarity Dao Lord, the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Supreme Lord Lao, the Heavenly Worthy of Dao and Virtue.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Jade Void Preceptor, the Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Sacred Father, the Radiant Perfected Great Emperor.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Sacred Mother, the Jade Perfected Supreme Immortal.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Sacred Preceptor, the Abundant Heavenly Great Emperor.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Purple Profundity Primordial Lady of the Western Land.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Watchtower’s Incarnation.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Mysterious Manifestation.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Supreme Clarity’s Numinous Transformation.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Lofty Jade Perfection.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Sunlight’s Auspicious Opening.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Martial Brilliance’s Responsive Transformation.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the Void Star’s Responsive Transformation.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the Danger Star’s Responsive Transformation.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the Celestial Unity’s Responsive Transformation.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Unity’s Responsive Transformation.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the Chronographic Star’s Responsive Transformation.

We, your servants, with single-minded devotion, take refuge in body, spirit, and destiny, to the Mysterious Heaven’s Responsive Numinous Manifestation and all the Most Sagely Heavenly Worthies.

We reverently receive the Supreme’s admonition: the Dao may be awakened to or deluded by; words may be superficial or deceitful. For all people, the three karmic actions—internally, they reside in the mind; externally, they arise from the mouth. If the mind harbors evil karma yet the mouth does not speak of it, that evil remains unmanifest. Though the mind may hold no such intent, the mouth may recklessly utter cunning words. Such karma deepens, all stemming from an evil tongue—scheming against the good, slandering the foolish, twisting words with florid speech, recklessly spreading falsehoods, neglecting proper teachings, failing to recite immortal scriptures, adorning falsehoods with embellishment—this is called ruin.

If one can refrain from sinning with the mouth, gathering thoughts in rare speech, avoiding evil words and turning instead to praise and chanting, one shall ever draw near to the scriptural teachings, repaying with the praise of a single virtue.

According to the fourth precept of the *Cultivation of Perfection*, one must not undermine another’s success or sow discord among kin. Now, we disciples, fearing that from the moment of our nature’s reception until this day, we have harbored resentment and envy, acting solely for self-interest, heedless of others’ peril. We have seized upon faults while ignoring virtues, scrutinizing others’ flaws; resented others’ success and rejoiced in their failure, deeply dismayed by their lack of merit. We have lured relatives to Yan and Qi, persuaded friends to journey through Wu and Yue. With honeyed words and false smiles, we have feigned agreement while harboring deceit; schemed disloyally, transmitting thoughts only through heart and mouth. We have repeated hearsay as truth, spied through cracks to climb walls. We have turned being into non-being, fabricated emptiness as reality. Those who fell short, we slandered without cause; those of great talent, we maliciously diminished. We have severed ties, fostering enmity and hatred. For all these past deeds, we now suffer in this world—our own hardships compounded, a hundred anxieties weighing upon us. Upon death, we shall fall into hell, enduring long kalpas of torment. When suffering ends and we are reborn in this world, the retribution of past karma shall yet remain, its punishment unceasing. Now, having heard the scriptures’ teachings, we are struck with terror. Humbly before the Sagely Ones, we prostrate ourselves in repentance. Each of us, with utmost sincerity, bows in reverence.

With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Primordial Chaos and Integration.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Life’s First Beginning.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Gentle Compassion.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Frugal Restraint.

With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Impermanent Nature.

With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Felicitous Homeland.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Governance and National Protection.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of a Single Good Word’s Response.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of Unassuming Giving.

With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy of the Threefold Abandonment.

With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy Preserving the Four Bodies.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy Benefiting the Three Powers.
With single-minded devotion, we bow and worship the Heavenly Worthy in Whom Nothing Lives Not.

The Heavenly Worthies and Supreme Sages, our reverence and recitation now complete,
we once more devote our whole heart, gazing afar toward the divine palace,
and take refuge in the Purple Sovereign of the Heavenly One True Felicitous Palace,
the Court of Primordial Harmony and Transmutation,
and the Northern Pole Hall of Protection and Sagely Aid—all the perfected immortals therein.

Today, the great assembly of this Daoist sanctuary humbly invokes the Teaching Master,
the Northern Pole Heaven-Pacifying, Sagely-Aiding, and Fortune-Conferring True Martial Spirit-Efficacious and Virtue-Rich Perfected Lord,
the Jade Void Preceptor and Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.

We pray that the divine tortoise command its chariot and the auspicious crane descend to the hall,
delivering us from the common and foolish, and bestowing blessings in abundance.

Today, on behalf of the disciple [Name], we seek repentance for the transgressions of the fourth precept—undermining others’ success and sowing discord among kin—sins committed in past lives and this present existence, extending their baleful influence upward to ancestors and downward to clan and kin. For the sake of gain, righteousness was forgotten, and meritorious deeds were ruined; through betrayal of gratitude and severing of affection, bonds of kinship and friendship were broken. In darkness, treacherous schemes were laid; in secret, snares were set. At times, reckless alliances gave rise to strife; at others, flattery and deceit spread dissension. Falsehoods were passed along in turn, emotions feigned and truth distorted—all in pursuit of scheming and plotting, which is called obstruction. The litany of offenses is long, and the weight of evil has reached its full measure, disturbing the divine bureaus and drawing ceaseless scrutiny and record.

Now, relying on the power of repentance, we lift our gaze in hope of proclaimed mercy, beseeching the stellar and terrestrial deities of the heavens and earth across kalpas, the four seasons and five phases, the six pitch-pipes and seven stars, the offices of merit and transgression, and all divine administrators and immortal clerks: may you widely extend compassion and grant full pardon. The repentant disciple [Name], together with this assembly of the Dharma, upholds the mysterious statutes, enters the Dao, and ascends to the precepts of truth. We vow henceforth to act without deceit, to refrain from flattery and fraud, to swear from this day forward that our words shall be free of fault, our conduct devoted to self-cultivation, and that we shall regard others’ wrongs as our own, yielding credit and deferring to ability without boasting. May harmony above and concord below bring about the flourishing of great achievements; may inner peace and outer stability ensure that no rift arises between near and distant kin.

Through this open confession and direct repentance,
we humbly pray that the Jade Voice may proclaim imperial favor,
and the Golden Gates may swiftly issue the sagely decree.
May we awaken to our faults and repent our transgressions,
thereby dissolving calamities and dispelling misfortune.
May the hidden and manifest harmonize as one,
so that in every glance and gesture we may remain free of shame;
may the departed in darkness be delivered,
and all who share karmic bonds receive equal grace.
Ever upholding the Most Real,
we shall forever follow the Mysterious Teachings.
Through these blessings,
may all be adorned with majesty,
the stellar bodies move in harmony,
and rain and sunshine respond to the seasons.
May we witness the auspicious sign of lush, fine grain,
and know no fear of frost’s descent or grass’s withering.
As the times unfold,
may there be no drought or flood;
beneath the vast expanse of heaven,
may the Dao flourish and the people live in harmony.
May all sentient beings together ascend to the shore of the Dao.

**Pacing the Void**

At that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct addressed the assembled immortals:
“The Three Caverns’ precious scriptures are all the supreme Dao of the Three Purities.
Thus did the Elder Lord say: ‘I received them from the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning seventy billion myriad kalpas ago. Though heaven and earth form and dissolve, and the ten thousand kinds arise and perish, only my Dao endures.’
Even now, I continue to cultivate them above the rosy clouds, and once transmitted them on jade tablets of the Jade Purity to the Perfected Duke in the Heaven of Immeasurable Longevity.
They were then passed to the Great Lord of the Azure Lad, following the nine heavens’ hierarchical standards, emerging once every ten thousand kalpas.
Since the Kaihuang era, they have been transmitted to later students, with those destined to become perfected receiving them after nine thousand years.
Three disciples may receive the transmission, some after forty years, others after nine, and if one encounters a worthy recipient, they may transmit it according to their vow.
In this degenerate age of shallow virtue, salvation is especially urgent. All must prioritize purification rites and hidden merit, to redeem the sins of the nine ancestors and deliver all beings from suffering.
Extending this to oneself, one establishes merit and spreads virtue, upholding celestial statutes to attain liberation.
Thus there are twenty-seven grades of purification rites and thirty-six ranks of jiao offerings.
The Three Registers are:
The **Golden Register**, which harmonizes yin and yang and safeguards the nation’s destiny;
The **Jade Register**, which prospers the nation and transforms the people, ensuring the well-being of all;
The **Yellow Register**, which delivers the nine generations of ancestors and the seven lineages, forever freeing them from the long night’s suffering.
The Seven Grades of Purification Rites are:
1. **Illuminating the Real**, which delivers the departed spirits and resolves all karmic grievances;
2. **Natural**, which universally benefits all beings, repents sins, dispels calamities, and cultivates immortality;
3. **Three Primes**, which repents transgressions against the precepts and absolves the Three Officials’ judgments;
4. **Eight Festivals**, which repents the black-recorded sins of one’s distant ancestors and oneself;
5. **Cavern Spirit**, which values purity and simplicity, and achieves merit through healing illnesses and averting disasters;
6. **Suffering and Hardship**, which achieves merit through austerity, repentance, and seeking blessings;
7. **Instruction**, which primarily employs clarity and emptiness, simplicity and stillness; secondarily, breath control and ingestion of essences; and ultimately, purifying the heart and repenting transgressions. Universally, it prioritizes putting others before oneself. When merit is complete, one ascends to heaven in broad daylight after three thousand deeds.

We, your servants, rejoice in encountering the sagely teachings and meeting the true wind, yet have not fully dedicated ourselves to their practice.
We can only devote our hearts to reverence, wholeheartedly invoking and prostrating with utmost sincerity.
Bowing our heads in homage, we take refuge.
With devoted hearts, we pay homage:
To the Celestial Worthy of Primordial Beginning, the Void and Natural;
To the Jade Emperor Dao Lord, the Numinous Treasure Celestial Worthy;
To the Most High Elder Lord, the Celestial Worthy of Dao and Virtue;
To the Jade Void Preceptor and Lord of the Mysterious Heaven;
To the Sacred Father, the August Emperor of Luminous Perfection;
To the Sacred Mother, the Supreme Immortal of Jade Perfection;
To the Sacred Preceptor, the August Emperor of Abundant Heaven;
To the Purple Mystery Lady of the Western Realm;
To the Celestial Worthy of Transformation in the Golden Gates;
To the Celestial Worthy of Manifest Response of the Mysterious Origin;
To the Celestial Worthy of Numinous Transformation of the Grand Purity;
To the Celestial Worthy of the Most High Jade Perfection;
To the Celestial Worthy of Sunlight Revealing Auspices;
To the Celestial Worthy of Martial Response and Transformation;
To the Celestial Worthy of Void Star’s Response and Transformation;
To the Celestial Worthy of Danger Star’s Response and Transformation;
To the Celestial Worthy of Heavenly One’s Response and Transformation;
To the Celestial Worthy of Grand One’s Response and Transformation;
To the Celestial Worthy of Chen Star’s Response and Transformation.
We, your servants, with devoted hearts take refuge in body, spirit, and life, to the Mysterious Heaven’s Manifest Numinous Response and Transformation, all the August Celestial Worthies.

We reverently receive the Most High’s teachings:
‘All worldly beings, unaware of past causes and failing to cultivate good fruits, are veiled by ignorance and obstructed by hindrances. Without repentance and confession, how can they awaken and attain liberation?
Though heaven and the world differ, their realms are the same; though sages and people are distinct, their principles are equal.
The Three Purities’ Dao realm and the Celestial Worthies of the Ten Directions also depend on human cultivation, all uniting with the sagely.
People’s fall into evil destinies stems from the three karmic actions—deeds, words, and thoughts—committing the greatest evils in life and manifesting them outwardly.
If one can inwardly extinguish evil thoughts, outwardly forget evil speech, refrain from discussing others’ faults, and avoid flaunting one’s own strengths; if upon seeing others’ transgressions, one vows not to spread them, cherishes silence, and speaks sparingly; if one forgets the heart amid ornate splendor and turns to repentance through reverence and faith—then in this life, one will attain nobility of body and fame, reaping the rewards of even a single good deed.
Walking through the world, both humans and spirits will be at peace.’
According to the fifth precept of *Cultivating the Real*: ‘One must not display talent to exalt oneself or slander and vilify the good.’
Thus do we, your disciples, fear that our sincerity may be impure, our vital qi too unyielding, our reliance on our own schemes excessive, and our suppression of others’ enlightenment.
Like jade tablets and the Milky Way, we boast of literary waves as vast as the sea;
like embroidered clouds, we dazzle with achievements as towering as mountains.”

With youthful vigor, they stoop to bully the weak and timid; in their prime, they forcefully dominate the aged and accomplished. They slander great sages with sly words, mocking and ridiculing the highest good. Their power is fierce and overbearing, their nature harsh and unyielding. They despise the noble, usurp the honored, belittle the great, and offend their superiors. Intoxicated by their own success, they grow arrogant and neglect self-discipline. Flattery seeps in like moisture, breeding corruption; praise and blame arise from private bias, one after another.

From past lives to the present, in this world, they incur others’ scorn and reproach, encountering misfortune at every turn. Upon death, they plunge into hell, suffering for eons; when their torment ends, they are reborn into evil destinies. Once their retribution is exhausted, they return to this world, yet lingering calamities from past deeds remain, their punishment not yet complete. Now, having heard the scripture’s warnings, they are struck with terror. Before the sacred presence, they humbly prostrate in repentance.

With devoted hearts, each pays reverent homage:
With devoted hearts, they pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Unoriginated Beginning.

Having completed this litany of reverence, they once more devote their whole hearts, remotely beseeching the divine court of the Purple Sovereign’s Heavenly One True Felicity Palace, the Bureau of Primordial Harmony and Transcendent Judgment, and the Northern Culmen’s Hall of Protective Sages—all the perfected immortals and celestial hosts. Today, the assembly of this ritual site humbly invokes the teaching master, the Northern Culmen’s Heaven-Filling Protective Sage, the True Martial Spirit of Assisting Rectitude and Blessing Virtue, the Jade Void Preceptor, the Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.

May their auspicious radiance descend, their blessed presence alight, bestowing grace upon the multitude, absolving grievances, and mitigating punishments. Now, on behalf of disciples such as ourselves, we repent for the transgressions of the fifth precept—displaying talent to exalt ourselves and slandering the good—committed in past lives and the present, leaving calamities across past kalpas, afflicting our ancestors above and descendants below. With sharp wit, we belittled the gentle and magnanimous; with our skills, we mocked and derided the mediocre and unrefined. Swaggering in self-satisfaction, we scorned all before us. Where power failed to bend others, resentment and grievances arose.

Where words grew fawning and obsequious, mockery and scorn arose. Recognizing only ourselves, we acted as though none stood beside us. Our self-regard soared too high, our arrogance and deceit grew ever bolder. Sins now stand tall in their tally, evil has filled its measure, disturbing the numinous bureaus, whose records of transgressions never cease.

Today, we rely upon repentance, openly beseeching the bestowal of grace. May the edict descend to the embroidered-robed messengers under your command, the Recording Deities Supreme, the yin-yang magistrates of the eight directions and nine provinces, the clerks and functionaries of all offices, and every luminous spirit. May they widely extend their compassion and mercy, granting universal pardon and absolution.

We, the repentant disciples, together with the assembly of the Dharma, reverently uphold the Mysterious Precepts, entering the Dao and ascending to true realization. We shall observe the rules with utmost care, never placing ourselves first. From this day forward, we vow to practice reverence and fulfill propriety to the utmost. We shall harmonize our light and mingle with the dust, never boasting lest none contend with our abilities. Upon witnessing goodness, we shall act as though we have not yet attained it. In humility and modesty, we shall withdraw, casting aside all pretension and deceit. In forthrightness and forbearance, we shall seal off all wayward and errant thoughts.

Having thus confessed and repented, we pray that the Emperor’s grace may descend in abundance, and the August Majesty’s power may ascend and flow unimpeded. May the four seasons forever dispel hardship, and the entire household together attain peace and prosperity. May we walk without shame, relying entirely upon your protection and aid. May your illumination remain unwavering, and may we never conceal our conduct. We shall forever serve the Supreme Truth, eternally follow the Mysterious Teachings. Through these benefits, may all be adorned with majesty. May the hundred grains ripen in abundance, the five materials be fully utilized. May the scourge of drought and locusts be swept away, and the calamity of becoming fish and turtles be averted. May there be ample food and clothing, no suffering from hunger or cold. May there be abundant millet and hemp, inspiring gratitude and reverence for the power of virtue. May all sentient beings together ascend the shore of the Dao.

*Thus concludes the fifth scroll of the Northern Dipper True Martial’s Universal Compassion and Salvation Dharma Repentance.*
*Begins the sixth scroll of the Northern Dipper True Martial’s Universal Compassion and Salvation Dharma Repentance.*

**Pacing the Void**

At that time, the Wondrous Conduct Perfected One addressed the assembly of immortals, saying: Long ago, the Female Perfected One Wang Miaoxiang of Mount Jiuyi, in her ardent devotion and sincerity, suddenly experienced a vision. One day, auspicious clouds filled the courtyard, and radiant light illuminated the hall and altar. Banners and canopies descended from the sky, and a Heavenly Official, clad in feathered robes and a jeweled crown, ascended the hall and took his seat. He said to Miaoxiang, “I am the Lord Shun, sovereign of the ancient Youyu dynasty. Having wearied of governing the myriad states, I cultivated the Dao upon this mountain. I have long wished to instruct later generations, guiding them to comprehend the Way, yet in this world, none are fit to receive such teaching.”

The Dao resides within, not without. The Dao lies in your own person, not in another. As the Mysterious Canon states: "Cultivate it within yourself, and your virtue shall be true." Recently, the Earthly Bureau memorialized that you have guarded the Dao without deviation, adhering to the Mysterious Precepts. If you attain no realization, it is the Dao that abandons the person.

Moreover, the Mysterious Canon declares: "Ever skillfully deliver all beings, thus nothing is abandoned." As the Dao’s beneficence pervades all, every being longs for fulfillment, and every person yearns for deliverance. Yet worldly beings, their karmic fruits meager and their Dao-qi shallow, fail to concentrate single-mindedly and diligently study the Dao’s work. Before completion, they grow lax—this is the person abandoning the Dao, not the Dao abandoning the person.

The Supreme Sages and Lofty Perfected Ones, moved by compassion for those who endure kalpas of impermanence—cycling through yin and yang, subject to rise and fall, birth and death, all shifting in an instant—especially during the conjunctions of the Nine Nines and Hundred Sixes, tirelessly descend to teach, striving to save humanity. Yet when worldly beings seek the Dao, their minds waver between presence and absence, and among ten thousand, scarcely one maintains steadfast mindfulness.

The Heavenly Perfected Ones, pitying the worldly, ever dwell among mortals, concealing their forms and transforming their appearances to enlighten all directions. If you desire long life, the Three Ones must be made clear. If you can guard the One, the One will guard you in turn. It transforms into essence, essence into the infant, the infant ascends to become a Perfected One, and the Perfected One then becomes the Celestial Child—this is the true One of the Perfected One.

It is also said: "The false Dao nurtures the form; the true Dao nurtures the spirit. When the spirit is true, the Dao is penetrated; it can vanish and endure. The spirit can make the form fly or move mountains, but when the form is reduced to ashes and dust, what awareness remains?"

The eyes and forms, sounds and colors—these are the faults that bind you. The fragrances and flavors your nose and mouth crave—these are your foes. The body is the root of affliction: pain, itching, cold, and warmth. The mind is burdened by the form; sorrow, poison, worry, and vexation—if you do not swiftly cast them aside, your will and qi will naturally deplete, and your lifespan will not extend.

We, your humble servants, reverently consider how the Supreme Sages, moved by compassion for worldly beings, have broadly revealed these teachings to deliver all ranks. We must uphold the precepts of our rank, devote ourselves wholeheartedly to cultivation, and bear the profound grace with utmost shame and gratitude.

With single-minded devotion, our five limbs bow in reverence. We prostrate before the Merciful Venerable One and pay homage to the True Sages:

With devout hearts, we bow to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneity.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Jade Clarity Dao Lord.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue, the Most High Lord Lao.
With devout hearts, we bow to the August Emperor of Dark Heaven, Lord of Benevolence and Might.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Radiant Perfected Great Emperor, the Sacred Father.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Jade Perfected Supreme Immortal, the Sacred Mother.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Sacred Master, the August Emperor of Abundant Heaven.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Purple Profundity Primordial Lady of the Western Realm.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Watchtower’s Incarnation.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Manifest Response of the Primordial.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Numinous Transformations of the Great Clarity.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Auspicious Radiance of the Sun.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Martial Star’s Response and Transformation.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Void Star’s Response and Transformation.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Danger Star’s Response and Transformation.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Celestial One’s Response and Transformation.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One’s Response and Transformation.
With devout hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Auspicious Transformation of the Chrono Star.

We, your humble servants, with devout hearts, take refuge in body, spirit, and life, reverently submitting to the manifold Perfected Ones of Dark Heaven’s Responsive Numinosity.

We reverently receive the sacred scriptures, wherein the Most High has proclaimed: "Fasting and precepts are the root of the Dao and the bridge of the Dharma. If you wish to study the Dao, observe purity and uphold the precepts, maintaining right mindfulness in every thought—thus, deviance and delusion will naturally vanish."

All sentient beings, forsaking the realm of purity, indulge in the stench of flesh and blood, thereby transgressing the Dharma. Like hungry ghosts devouring corpses, their burning bellies find no satiety; like flies swarming over filth, they mistake stench for fragrance, thereby transgressing the Dharma. The Three Palaces grow turbid, the Six Viscera impure; the corpse-spirit rejoices in corruption, delighting in the realm of death.

You must sever the roots of desire, enter the true realm of purity, refrain from all suffering, avoid all evil, abandon all views, and shun all deviance. Regard the precepts as you would the laws of the world: if you contemplate transgression, you fear the punishments of metal and wood. Hold fast to the precepts with utmost sincerity, maintaining solemn reverence as if facing something dreadful. With upright mind and strict discipline, extinguish all thoughts, listen with undivided attention, and you may attain the true and right—such is my disciple.

According to the sixth precept of the *Cultivation of the Perfected*: "Do not overindulge in alcohol or consume impure things." We, your disciples, deeply fear that we have indulged our hearts in excess and desire, indulging our senses in greed and observation. Like whales swallowing the ocean, we daily and nightly succumb to drunkenness; like birds relishing poison, we yearn for the stench of flesh through the seasons. Under the pretense of "celestial nectar of the immortal realms" or in pursuit of "exquisite delicacies of the noble households," we forget our forms in pursuit of taste and pleasure.

A hundred drunken bouts, a thousand scenes—stripped bare, we grow ever more dissolute. The Five Pungents and Six Impurities fill our mouths, our only aim to sate our hunger. Foul vapors scorch others, deep intoxication disorders the nature. Our actions grow ever more frenzied, our words heedless of lewdness and deviance. Even during the sacred times of fasting and offering, we harbor thoughts of slaughter and gluttony. We serve only our mouths and bellies, neglecting the body’s discipline.

We slink through the streets, wringing our hands in secret, or tread stealthily to filthy chambers, competing to arrive. Our conduct is indiscriminate, our haunts unwholesome; our steps falter, our efforts are in vain. The karmic deeds of the past persist in this life: we establish ourselves in meagerness, our actions base and vile. Upon death, we fall into hell, suffering for long kalpas. When the suffering ends, we are reborn, only to enter evil destinies. When that retribution is exhausted, we return to this world. Due to past karma, lingering misfortunes remain, and the cycle of suffering continues—until now, hearing the scriptures’ teachings, we are truly alarmed and terrified.

Before the sacred presence, we reverently offer our repentance.
With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and bow in faith.

With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Origin, Void and Serene.
With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Beginning, Image and Immortal.

With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Penetration, Vast and Boundless.
With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Spring, Great and Abundant.
With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Possession, Great Compassion.

O Heavenly Worthies and Supreme Sages, our rites of homage and recitation now complete,
we once more devote our whole hearts to gaze afar toward the divine precincts.
We take refuge in the Purple Sovereign, the Heavenly One of True Celebration Palace,
the Court of Primordial Harmony and Celestial Correction,
and the Northern Culmen’s Hall of Protecting Sages—all the host of perfected immortals.

Today, the great assembly of this Daoist sanctuary humbly invokes the Teaching Master,
the Northern Culmen’s Heaven-Pacifying, Sage-Protecting, Assisting, and Compliant True Martial,
Numinous-Responsive, and Blessed Virtue Perfected Lord,
the Jade Void Preceptor and Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.

May the armored cavalry lead the way, and the divine soldiers follow behind.
May flourishing blessings be bestowed, and grace descend upon the common people.

Today, on behalf of the disciple [Name], we repent the transgressions of the six precepts—excess in wine-drinking and the consumption of impure substances—sins accrued from past lives to the present, from former kalpas to this generation, extending upward to ancestors and downward to clan kin. Through ceaseless intoxication, resolve has drowned and will grown weak; through boundless feasting, the body has been bared and rites abandoned. Fond of cooking rare delicacies, one remains unaware of the offense in slaughter; wantonly killing sentient beings, one indulges in the pleasures of minced flesh. Boasting of wine’s sagacity, beasts are butchered; disrespecting the lofty Perfected, heavy retribution is inescapable. Offenses mount in tally, evil brims to overflowing, disturbing the numinous bureaus, whose records never cease.

Now, relying on repentance, we lift our gaze in hope of proclaimed mercy, entreating the nine bureaus of karmic judgment, the underworld officials, the clerks of the Registry, the divine functionaries, and the enforcing deities—may they, in vast compassion, grant absolution. The repentant disciple [Name], together with this assembly, pledges to uphold the Mysterious Statutes, enter the Dao, ascend to Perfection’s precepts, and ever practice purity. Let us not vaunt worldly defilement, but clarify the spirit and purify the mind, restrain the self and preserve the numinous. Drink without excess, eat without impurity. Let us guard against the regret of the lone sober amidst the drunken, borrowing the crimson’s warning; follow the principles of nurturing life and sending off the dead, drawing upon the silver-haired’s wisdom.

Herein we lay bare our transgressions and present this repentance. May the grace of heaven and earth overflow like rain and dew. Pardon the judgments upon our madness, and perceive the sincerity of our reform. Bestow blessings upon the humble, that all may enjoy peace and well-being; let radiance suffuse the lotus, forever dispelling the shadows of ignorance. May we ever serve the Most Perfect, forever adhere to the Mysterious Teachings. Through these blessings, may all adornments be perfected, the state governed and the people at peace, none but abiding in tranquility; may officials be pure and the Dao flourish, never again contending in aggression. May all sentient beings ascend to the shore of the Dao.

*Beginning of the Seventh Scroll of the Northern Dipper True Martial’s Universal Compassion and Salvation Dharma Repentance*

**Pacing the Void**

At that time, the Wondrously Practiced Perfected addressed the assembled immortals: "Of old, the Supreme revealed the title of the Venerable Serene Heavenly Worthy, propagating the teachings across the five directions to deliver humans and gods. Existing prior to heaven and earth, it nurtures the ten thousand kinds. Above, it dwells in the Jade Capital as the progenitor of divine kings; below, it resides in the Purple Tenuity as the ancestor of flying immortals. Undergoing a thousand transformations and ten thousand changes, it possesses virtue yet does not claim virtue, responding to circumstances and adapting to beings, its traces ever without constancy. It instructed the Yellow Emperor at Mount Kongtong, taught Emperor Ku in his herding of virtue. Great Yu received the formula for long life, Yin Xi received the purport of the *Dao and Its Virtue*. Crimson script on cinnabar, the *Scripture of Ascending the Mysterious and Pacing the Void*; golden light on jade and stone, the wondrous *Exposition of the Numinous and Profound*. Such texts are beyond enumeration. From high antiquity through the kalpas to the Yellow Emperor, Emperor Ku, and Great Yu, all encountered divine beings and received the registers of the Dao. As the ages grew distant, records and histories fell silent, until the Zhou dynasty, when [the Dao] departed east from Hangu Pass and entered the western lands of Jibin. There, it revealed its evanescent form and expounded the teachings of the Subtle and Inaudible. Thus, beneficence flowed westward and transformation spread through the Middle Kingdom.

Now, when a person is born, heaven endows them with spirit, earth endows them with essence, and the harmonious center endows them with qi. If one can preserve essence, cherish spirit, and safeguard qi, internally this leads to long life, externally to the peace of the state. Therefore, as a minister, one should be loyal to one’s lord, desiring his long life; as a child, one should bear in mind one’s parents, fearing their aging; as a disciple, one should remember the grace of one’s teacher. For we receive our bodies from our parents, perfect our virtue and power through true teachers, and obtain the sustenance of water and soil from our sovereign. We ought to bear in mind the aging of our lord, father, and teacher, for they cannot be restored. One may practice learning and cultivate goodness, seek out worthy and enlightened teachers, and acquire rare talents and extraordinary arts to benefit them. This was the way of the Highest Sovereigns of remote antiquity: those who cultivated goodness spoke and acted with utmost sincerity, disciplined their hearts, purified their conduct, and moved the Supreme Mystery to respond. Receiving the grace of heaven and earth, they never forgot to repay it. With unwavering dedication, they attained the ranks of the immortals.

We, though ephemeral in our incarnate forms, have presumptuously received the shelter of heaven and earth, the favor of lord and kin, the toil of our parents, and the privilege of bearing their teachings. How dare we forget our origins? Relying upon incense and flame, we repay this vast grace. Holding ourselves with reverence, we single-mindedly give rise to this vow. Bowing our heads, we take refuge in the Orthodox and True Three Treasures. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and Spontaneity. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Clarity. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue, the Most High Lord Lao. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Jade Void Preceptor and Minister, the Mysterious Heavenly Thearch. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Sacred Father, the Illustrious Perfected Great Emperor. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Sacred Mother, the Jade Perfected Supreme Immortal. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Sacred Teacher, the Abundant Heavenly Great Emperor. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Purple Profundity Primordial Lady of the Western Lands. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Transformative Manifestation of the Golden Tower. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Response of the Mysterious Origin. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Transformation of the Great Clarity. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Lofty Jade Perfection. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Auspicious Radiance of the Solar Light. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Martial Response and Transformation. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Void Star Response and Birth. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Perilous Star Response and Transformation. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Heavenly One Response and Transformation. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Great One Response and Transformation. With devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of Celestial Star Response and Transformation.

We, with devoted hearts, take refuge in body, spirit, and life, in the Three Treasures and the Most High Mysterious Heavenly Thearch, and in all the Heavenly Worthies of Manifest Response and Transformation.

We have reverently heard the teachings bequeathed by the Most High: All sentient beings dwell in the floating world, where a hundred years pass like a moment. Swift as spark from stone or lightning flash, how can they endure? Like moths to flame, they court their own destruction, unable to awaken, ensnared by delusion. Clinging to stinginess, they are ever burdened by greed. Though their hoards rise like mountains, their hearts remain unsatisfied. They plan for a single day as if it were a thousand years. Born, they bring not a single coin; dead, they take not a single coin away. In a single morning, the body perishes, and all things become empty. Boundless avarice dissolves into illusion. Those who amass wealth in life without dispersing it—how can they escape the disasters of flood, fire, or bandits? Those who scheme against others—how can they avoid the retribution of impoverished descendants? At such times, heroes and the mighty vanish in an instant. Grand carriages and fine steeds—what concern are they to the deceased? Splendid halls and towering mansions—all belong to others. Kin and family lament in vain—what benefit is there?

We now reflect upon the Seventh Precept of Cultivating the Perfected: *One must not be insatiably greedy, hoarding wealth without dispersing it.* Yet we, in our private anxieties, have overreached in calculation, indulged in distant ambitions and covetous schemes, amassed stores without end, and pursued gluttony without cease. We have monopolized goods and wealth, desiring our own enrichment while impoverishing others; seized fields and homes, seeing our own strength and others’ weakness. We have blocked the dragon’s ascent to monopolize profit, vied over snail-horn gains to seek advantage. Morning to night, we scheme and worry, ever fearful of lack; left and right, we maneuver and contrive, never satisfied in our desires."

Grain and millet rot in granaries—would we spare a single kernel to relieve the starving? Cash and paper notes overflow the beams—could we part with even a fraction to aid the destitute? Our own sustenance is already deemed meager and base; how could we spare pity for the wretched and impoverished? We still seek to sweep up all, while our purses grow ever more parched.

The karmic deeds of past and present lives weigh upon us in this world: ceaseless toil and weariness, calamities of banditry and plunder. Upon death, we plunge into hell, suffering through long kalpas of torment. When that suffering ends, we are reborn—only to enter the evil destinies. When that retribution is exhausted, we return once more to this world, yet due to past karma, lingering misfortune remains, and the cycle of suffering is not yet complete.

Now, hearing the sutra’s teachings, we are struck with terror. Before the sacred presence, we humbly prostrate in repentance. With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and pay reverence.

Heavenly Worthies and Supreme Saints, our reverence and recitation now complete, we once more devote our whole hearts to gaze afar toward the divine palaces. We take refuge in the Purple Sovereign’s Heavenly One Palace of True Felicity, the Court of Primordial Harmony and Karmic Adjustment, and the Northern Culmen’s Hall of Protective Sagacity—all the assembled immortals.

Today, the great assembly of this Daoist ritual humbly invokes the teaching master, the Northern Culmen’s Heaven-Pacifying, Sagely-Assisting, and Fate-Conforming True Martial Spirit-Efficacious and Virtue-Bestowing Perfected Sovereign, the Jade Void Preceptor and Mysterious Heavenly Thearch. We pray that, treading upon the tortoise and restraining the serpent, riding the simurgh and driving the phoenix, you may widely open your compassion and broadly succor the common and foolish.

Now, on behalf of the disciple [Name], we seek repentance for the sins of violating the Seventh Precept—insatiable greed and hoarding wealth without dispersing it—committed in past lives and the present, the lingering misfortunes of former kalpas, extending to ancestors above and descendants below. We have seized others’ wealth as our own, schemed to claim others’ possessions as our own, concealed our cunning, and wantonly deployed deceitful plans.

At times, trading in the marketplace, they saw abundance as if it were nothing;
Or hoarding wealth to adorn their halls, they exchanged emptiness for substance.
Their wealth swelled to billions, yet they begrudged even the smallest coin.
Ever craving accumulation to gratify their hearts,
They heeded not that excess wealth could bring harm upon themselves.
Their sins now stand enumerated, their evil brimmed to fullness,
Disturbing the numinous bureaus, whose records ceaselessly compile their transgressions.

Today, relying on the power of repentance, we earnestly beseech the bestowal of grace,
That the Bureau of Merit be commanded to cease its reckoning of wrongs,
That the officials of Yang and the clerks of Yin, who hold the registers and grasp the ledgers,
The celestial deities who uphold the law, the luminous spirits who discern good and evil,
The assessors and their aides—all may broadly extend their compassion and grant absolution.

The repentant disciple [Name], together with the assembly of the Dharma,
Abides by the Mysterious Statutes, enters the Dao, and ascends to the True Precepts.
Henceforth, we shall practice contentment, ever uphold integrity,
And vow that from this day forward, we shall early plant the seeds of goodness,
Coveting not even the slightest gain.
Our chests and trunks shall store only what is fitting,
And our granaries need never fear depletion.
Knowing when to stop and when we have enough,
We shall cease all excessive pursuits in our affairs.
Swiftly and surely, we shall aid those in need,
Never seeking to further enrich the already wealthy.

By this open confession and sincere repentance,
We humbly pray that the boundless blessings of creation may encompass us,
That the radiance of your oversight may be no less than the sheltering heavens.
May our households enjoy flourishing fortune,
And high and low alike receive the blessings of tranquility.
May the favor of Heaven prove no empty promise,
And all, in every station, dwell in warmth and plenty.
May the sun’s bounty never fail,
And its generosity flow without end.
Ever revering the True and Orthodox,
We shall forever follow the Mysterious Teachings.
Through these merits, may all be adorned with splendor,
May the hidden and manifest realms commune,
The living and the dead alike be delivered,
The Nine Dark Realms be opened and prosper,
The Eight Difficulties be dispelled and dissolved.
May we depart the Black Path and ascend the Vermilion Palace,
Be swiftly uplifted and exalted by boundless grace,
Receive the beneficent dew and all be suffused with its blessings.

Thus concludes the Seventh Scroll of the *Northern Culmen Perfected Warrior’s Universal Compassion Dharma Repentance*.
The Eighth Scroll of the *Northern Culmen Perfected Warrior’s Universal Compassion Dharma Repentance*.

**Pacing the Void**

At that time, the Great Mystery Perfected One, in the Golden Flower Grotto-Heaven, encountered the descent of the Most High and inquired of the Teachings Beyond Words.
The Most High replied:
Heaven attains its height, Earth its depth,
The sun shines, the stars gleam—yet none speak.
Align with the Dao, and all things are naturally so.
The four seasons proceed in their course, yet not for the sake of the myriad beings.
Rain and dew descend in their time, yet not to nurture grasses and trees.
The numinous and the yin-yang harmonize, and all things grow of themselves.

The Dao conceals its essence within,
Settles the spirit in the heart.
Serene and still, joyous and harmonious,
It fills the breast with clarity, vast and formless,
Silent and soundless.
Thus, the court enjoys peace, the government halls are tranquil,
No recluses lurk in the forests, no idle folk roam the wilds.
No forced labor, no unjust punishments—
All under Heaven look up to the virtue of their ruler.
Distant lands and foreign customs,
All come forth, their interpreters in tow,
Though no household has been visited, nor any person instructed.
It is the extension of sincere heart to all under Heaven—nothing more.

Thus, rewarding good and punishing evil are but instruments of governance.
What enables their enactment is the power of sincerity.
Though governance be clear, it cannot act alone—
It must await the permeation of sincerity.
When sincerity takes form within and without,
Pervading the hearts of the people,
This is the Teachings Beyond Words.

When the Sage abides above, embracing the Dao without speech,
His beneficence extends to the ten thousand directions.
Thus, the Teachings Beyond Words—how vast and boundless!
Therefore, the ruler’s contemplation of the numinous
Must not stray from his breast,
His wisdom need not extend beyond the four quarters.
Embracing his sincere heart,
Timely sweet rains fall, the five grains flourish,
Authority is majestic yet untested,
Laws are few yet unburdensome,
Prisons stand empty, all under Heaven share a single custom.
Auspicious clouds arise, auspicious stars appear,
Yellow dragons descend, propitious phoenixes arrive.
Sweet springs well forth, fine grains sprout,
The seas lie calm, their waves stilled.

But should one defy Heaven and oppress the myriad beings,
The sun and moon grow dim and eclipse,
The five stars stray from their courses,
The four seasons fall into discord,
Day darkens, night shines,
Mountains collapse, waters dry,
Winter thunders, summer frosts,
Celestial omens shift and portend,
The land knows no peace.
For the Dao of Heaven and Earth communicates with humanity.

The Sage harmonizes his virtue with Heaven and Earth,
His brightness with the sun and moon,
His numinosity with the ghosts and spirits,
His trustworthiness with the four seasons.
Embracing the heart of Heaven, aligning with Heaven’s qi,
Holding to the Center and harmonizing,
He need not descend his hall to traverse the Four Seas.
Transforming customs, leading all to turn toward goodness—
This is the Teachings Beyond Words.

We, your servants, born in an enlightened age,
Delight in encountering this flourishing era,
Where the land and waters of the kingdom,
Heaven and Earth shape and sustain.
Grateful for virtue, bearing grace without end,
We look up to the True Teachings and dare not slacken in reverence.
With awe before your majestic radiance,
We wholeheartedly prostrate and pay homage.

Wholeheartedly prostrate and pay homage to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Natural.
Wholeheartedly prostrate and pay homage to the Jade Clarity Dao Lord, Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy.
Wholeheartedly prostrate and pay homage to the Most High Lord Lao, Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue.

Wholeheartedly prostrate and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Manifest Response of the Primordial.
Wholeheartedly prostrate and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Clarity’s Numinous Transformation.

Wholeheartedly prostrate and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Celestial One’s Responsive Transformation.
Wholeheartedly prostrate and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One’s Responsive Transformation.
Wholeheartedly prostrate and pay homage to the Heavenly Worthy of the Chronographic Star’s Responsive Transformation.

We, your servants, wholeheartedly take refuge in body,
Take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life,
Before the manifestly numinous and responsive transformed Perfected Sovereigns and Sacred Worthies of the Mysterious Heaven.

We, your servants, reverently receive the sacred scriptures,
As the Most High imparts his teachings:
The Supreme Sages transmit the Dao in accord with nature,
Departing from words to attain the truth within...

The transmission of virtue relies on words to enlighten those lost below. The transmission of scriptures depends on speech to guide future cultivation. In this latter age, when the Dao and virtue are in decline, should one wish to cultivate, one must rely solely on the teachings of the scriptures. The scriptures are the constant—the true path that all beings must follow. Without scriptures in the lower realms, it is like walking without a path or exiting without a door; how can one ascend or traverse? Moreover, when the Primordial Beginning first unfolded the chart, within the Dragon Han kalpa, at the beginning of the Azure Eon, in the Floating Black Realm, he revealed the scripture to deliver beings. Its characters were a zhang in size, with eight corners radiating light. He made a covenant with the Ten Heavens, transmitting salvation for ten thousand generations, storing it in the Treasure Chamber, and entrusting it to the Jade Lords. Though one may not see its form with the eyes, the blind come to see; though one may not hear its Dao with the ears, the deaf come to hear. Thus, when the scriptural teachings emerge, all in the world are delivered. If the scriptures were cut off, it would be no different from groping for a path while blind. Only those who have awakened to the true Dao may depart from words and images. Those who have not yet grasped the subtleties of the Dao must rely on the true scriptures. Through the scriptures, one attains deliverance, as if riding a great boat—unsubmerged by the waves, transcending to the shore of the Dao. In this way, beings’ ears hear, their minds are purified, their spirits are transformed, and their natures are enlightened, thereby ascending to awakening.

We respectfully follow the Eighth Precept of Cultivating the True, which states: "Do not associate with the unworthy or dwell in defiled places." Now, we disciples, in our thoughts and reflections, find reason and desire fading, habits altering our nature. We have turned away from the admonitions of harmony, kinship, filial piety, and friendship; we have transgressed the teachings of rules, standards, and norms. We have sought intimacy only with the overly familiar, and our perceptions have lacked refinement. We have gathered in frivolous company, dwelling in revelry and feasting, engaging in unprofitable laughter and talk, and subjecting one another to violence and oppression. We have not associated with upright and virtuous people but have delighted in the company of foolish women and men. Within and without, we have fabricated disputes; before and after, we have stirred up suspicions. Confused and deluded, we have been stained by dust and defiled by arrogance. For all these past karmic deeds, in our present lives, we remain benighted and unenlightened, cast aside and rejected in great number. Upon death, we fall into hell, suffering for long kalpas. When our suffering ends, we are reborn, only to enter evil destinies. When our retribution is exhausted, we return to this world, and due to our past karma, lingering misfortunes remain. We continue to suffer retribution, but now, having heard the scriptures’ teachings, we are greatly alarmed. Reverently before the sacred presence, we humbly offer our repentance. With wholehearted devotion, we take refuge and prostrate in faith.

The Heavenly Worthies and Sacred Perfected Ones—our prostrations and recitations now complete—we once more devote our whole hearts to gaze afar toward the divine palaces. We take refuge in the Purple Sovereign’s Heavenly One True Celebration Palace, the Harmonious Migration and Correction Office, and the Northern Culmen’s Protector Sage Court, along with all the Perfected Immortals therein.

Today, the great assembly of this Daoist ritual humbly invokes the Teaching Master, the Northern Culmen’s Heaven-Pacifying, Assisting, and Upholding True Martial Numinous Response and Blessed Virtue Perfected Lord, the Jade Void Preceptor and Mysterious Heavenly Thearch. We pray that he may fulfill his teachings, descend his numinous power, expel evil, and assist the upright, traversing the six directions to universally protect the myriad people.

Now, for the disciple [Name], we seek repentance for the sins of violating the Eighth Precept—associating with the unworthy and dwelling in defiled places—committed in past lives and this present existence, leaving misfortunes from former kalpas. These extend upward to our ancestors and downward to our clan and kin. Our affections have been misplaced, often turning against reason and harming the Dao. Our qi and strength have been fierce, devoted to valor and boastful prowess.

At times, we have abandoned our proper dwellings to dwell in tumult, or forsaken the right path and failed to follow it, placing ourselves in shameful positions and flaunting our strength with arrogance. Who would claim that rotten wood can be carved? We see only how withered roots are easily destroyed. Our sins branch out in detail, and our evil has become full to overflowing, disturbing the numinous bureaus and subjecting us to ceaseless recording and scrutiny.

Now, relying on the power of repentance, we earnestly hope for the proclamation of mercy. We beseech the Left Bureau’s Yang Officials, the Right Bureau’s Yin Officials, the Central Bureau’s Inspecting Officials, the Examining Officials, the Examining Clerks, the Examining Soldiers, the Examining Scholars, and all the great deities of the Department of Punishment and Sentencing to broadly extend their compassion and collectively grant us amnesty and absolution.

We, the repentant disciples [Names] and all those of the Dharma assembly, follow the Mysterious Statutes, enter the Dao, and ascend to the Perfected Precepts. We ought to act without desire, not cling to our own views, and vow from this day forward to associate only with those superior to ourselves, choose friends who are upright, shun dwelling in lowly places, and walk only the Middle Way. Upon hearing of goodness, we bow in reverence and dare not harbor private self-interest; upon seeing evil, we turn away and increasingly uphold the impartial rites.

Having thus made our confession, we now present this repentance. We humbly pray that blessings and fortune may come in abundance, that disasters and misfortunes may not arise, and that in all our seeing, hearing, speaking, and acting—in all our comings and goings and daily life—we may constantly serve the Most Perfect and True, forever relying on the Mysterious Teachings. Through these benefits, may all be adorned with majesty, the rain of the Teaching spread universally, the wind of benevolence extend far and wide, all people turn toward the right Dao, and the world be closed to evil schemes. May all sentient beings together ascend to the shore of the Dao.

*Here ends Fascicle Eight of the Northern Dipper True Martial Universal Compassion Dharma Repentance for Deliverance of the World*
*Fascicle Nine of the Northern Dipper True Martial Universal Compassion Dharma Repentance for Deliverance of the World begins*

**Pacing the Void**
At that time, the Perfected One of Wondrous Conduct addressed the assembled immortals, saying: "In the past, I heard the wondrous instructions of the Most High, who declared: 'Within the formless and nameless, the primordial chaos and boundless expanse, I opened the Dao of the Mysterious and Yellow, divided the numinous, and dispersed the qi. From the Great Luo, the Three Realms descended, and the Nine Thearchs were born as the Mysterious Ford of the Three Treasures. The Thirty-Six Departments emerged as the Mysterious Root of the Three Realms. Thereafter, the Thirty-Two Heavens and Thirty-Two Thearchs secretly communicated and transformed, branching downward into the Three Realms and traversing the twenty-eight lunar lodges and the five planets’ celestial paths to bring illumination.

The pure qi of the Five Directions ascended to form Heaven, the heavy and turbid congealed below to form Earth, and from their midst humanity was born. Heaven, Earth, and all beings—none were not complete therein. Thus, the harmonious and upright qi gave rise to the Perfected Lords and Sagely Consorts, the Jade Maidens and Immortal Ladies; the fierce and valiant qi gave rise to the Heavenly Soldiers and Divine Warriors, the divine generals and officials; the qi of yin and yang and the Five Phases gave rise to men and women. The chaotic and errant qi gave rise to flying birds and running beasts. All received the same qi, yet their myriad forms differed. According to their transformations, they received natures that varied. Emerging from the mechanism and entering the mechanism, going forth and returning, they labor endlessly under creation and transformation, relying on the molding and refining of the Dao.

I now reverently peruse the scriptural texts and deeply bear their weight. Through these words, I have been enlightened and awakened. Reflecting on the causes of the past, I have come to understand this body and arrived at the present day. Fortunate to dwell among humankind, I recognize my faults and errors. Reverently paying homage to the Heavenly Worthy, I pray for great forgiveness.'

With one heart, we respectfully pay homage, each with reverence and faith.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Primordial Beginning, the Void and Spontaneous.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Jade Clarity Dao Lord.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue, the Most High Lord Lao.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Jade Void Preceptor and Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Sagely Father, the Radiant Perfected Great Thearch.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Sagely Mother, the Jade Perfected Immortal.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Sagely Preceptor, the Abundant Heavenly Thearch.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Purple Profundity Primordial Lord of the Western Realm.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Transformation of the Golden Watchtower.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Manifest Response of the Mysterious Origin.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Transformation of the Great Clarity.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Perfected on High.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Auspicious Radiance of the Sun.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Martial Response and Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Void Star’s Response and Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Danger Star’s Response and Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One’s Response and Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Celestial One’s Response and Transformation.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Chronographic Star’s Response and Transformation.

We, your servants, with devoted hearts, take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, and take refuge in life, to all the Perfected Lords and Sagely Worthies of the Mysterious Heaven’s Manifest Numinous Response and Transformation.

We reverently receive the scriptural treasure, as the Most High has bequeathed his instructions: 'On the Three Primes, the Eight Festivals, the Five La Days, the Ten Straight Days, the days of jiazi and gengshen, and one’s own life-destiny day, all the immortals and Perfected Ones—the Four Poles and Ten Flowers, the Three Realms and Four Heavens, the Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, the Diamond Divine Kings, the Good and Evil Youths, and the Sagely and Exalted Worthies—pace the void, hold banners and erect standards, burn incense and scatter flowers, grasp talismans and hold registers, and traverse the human realm, recording good and evil.

If there are sentient beings who refrain from all evil, cultivate all good, uphold fasts and observe precepts, practice the Dao and transmit scriptures, establish altars and halls, deliver gods and humans, bestow life and spread virtue, expound the Great Vehicle, teach and transform men and women, and save and deliver sentient beings, then the Heavenly Immortals will take their records of good deeds and present them to the Primordial Beginning. They will report to the Celestial Offices, which will then allow them to offset their transgressions with merit, ascend to Heaven, or attain the Dao. Some may be appointed to manage offices, sign documents, or assume various immortal ranks, advancing according to their merit. Those who ascend to the Sagely Realms do so through the accumulation of good deeds, receiving such blessed rewards.

If there are sentient beings who, as officials, cruelly oppress the myriad people, or rely on power and strength to bully the poor and lowly; who as children are unfilial or as subjects disloyal; who expose the Three Luminaries, disrespect the Three Treasures, curse Heaven and revile Earth, cheat the public for private gain, slaughter living beings, harm others or strange creatures; who commit the Ten Evils, the Five Rebellions, or offenses of the Three Karmas and Six Roots, creating evil causes and successively incurring karmic retribution—then the Heavenly Immortals will take their records of evil deeds and report them to the Primordial Beginning. They will inform the Celestial Offices, which will transmit them throughout the Earth Prisons, causing them to suffer from grave illnesses, meet with death, encounter enemies, become strange creatures, enter hells, or be confined in dark dungeons. They will pass through kalpas of years without means of escape.'"

All these are the retributions suffered by those who commit evil.

According to the Ninth Precept of *Cultivating the True*:
*"One must not be disloyal or unfilial, faithless or unkind."*

Now, we disciples, deeply concerned that external delusions may obscure our minds and that the benighted may never grasp the precepts of destiny and righteousness, fail to discern the proper bounds of speech and action. Gradually, we mistake a deer for a horse, usurping authority to wield power; we call a bird a phoenix, seeking favor through false display. We indulge in gambling and drink, neglecting our nurture; we covet private wealth and lust, forgetting our kin. We revile and rage at father and elder brother, slander and flatter teacher and friend, violate rites and harm instruction, delight in violence and resent poverty. Our conduct invites repeated mockery in the village, yet we fail to uphold reverence in the district. We pursue fame at the cost of truth, act contrary to our words. We move trees for gold, exchange cities for jade. We distort right and wrong, deceiving self and others; we utter empty words, unafraid of the divine. We entrap the worthy, ensnare the kind, poison all beings, and cruelly harm the multitude.

For these past deeds, in this present life, we encounter crooked paths in our affairs, suffer the scorn and neglect of others, and upon death, fall into hell, enduring long kalpas of suffering. When our suffering ends, we are reborn, only to enter evil destinies. When that retribution is exhausted, we return to this world, yet due to past karma, lingering misfortune remains, and the cycle of retribution continues unceasing.

Now, hearing the scripture’s words, we are greatly alarmed. Reverently before the sacred, we humbly offer our repentance.

With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Primordial Chaos.
With devoted hearts, we bow to the Heavenly Worthy of Great Pristine Simplicity.

Heavenly Worthies and Supreme Sages, our rites and invocations now complete, we once more devote our whole hearts to gaze afar toward the divine abode, taking refuge in the Purple Imperial Heavenly One True Celebration Palace, the Office of Primordial Harmony and Karmic Adjustment, and the Northern Culmen’s Hall of Protective Sages, along with all the perfected immortals therein.

Today, the great assembly of this Daoist sanctuary humbly invokes the Teaching Master, the Northern Culmen’s Heaven-Pacifying, Protective and Assistive, Numinous and Responsive, Blessed and Virtuous Perfected Lord, the Jade Void’s Preceptor and Mysterious Heavenly Thearch. We pray that Your boundless grace be impartial, Your numinous radiance resplendent. Look upon the dusty world, shelter and protect the foolish and lowly.

This day, for the repentant disciple [Name], who seeks absolution for transgressions against the Ninth Precept—offenses of disloyalty, impiety, faithlessness, and inhumanity—we confess:

From past lives to this present existence, misfortunes from former kalpas have extended upward to ancestors and forebears, downward to clan and kin. In serving lords, we have failed in propriety and fallen short of loyalty; in dealings with others, we have lacked sincerity and broken covenants. We have neglected parental grace with obstinacy and defiance, offended superiors with insolence and oppression. At times, our words have been excessive and reckless, failing to uphold the Mean; our intentions, cruel and merciless, lacking compassion and forbearance.

Our sins are enumerated, our wickedness overflowing, disturbing the numinous bureaus and subjecting us to ceaseless recording and reproof. Now, relying on the power of repentance, we lift our gaze in hope of proclaimed mercy, beseeching the Celestial Decree to command the Registers of Karmic Examination, the Enforcers of Punitive Judgment, the Bureaus of Fault-Recording, the Scribes of Merit and Virtue, and the Officials of Yin and Yang—all the mighty deities of their offices—to extend boundless compassion and grant us pardon.

The repentant disciple [Name], together with this assembly of the Dharma, reverently adheres to the Mysterious Statutes, enters the Dao, and ascends to the Precepts of Perfection. We shall practice humility and deference, engaging with all through the Way. From this day forward, we vow to bind our caps and quell disorder, to fan pillows and serve our parents. We shall restore propriety to embody humanity, and regard fidelity as that which must first reside within ourselves. With the Four Beginnings as our guide, we shall tread cautiously, ever fearful of failing the teachings of moral cultivation.

The Six Codes are diligently observed, trembling with vigilance to uphold the Way of restraint and caution. Here and now, we openly confess and directly present this repentance. We humbly pray that the transforming sun may shine forth, and the Dao’s wind may grandly renew. May all who uphold fame and integrity be equally enveloped in grace. May evil roots be eradicated, and demonic disturbances swept away; may past merits be inscribed in the ledgers of fortune, and longevity prolonged in the vision of enduring life. May we ever serve the Most Perfect, forever abide by the Mysterious Teachings, and through this benefit, adorn all things in majesty. The Dao’s vastness is boundless, its virtue pure and unceasing. Accumulated goodness brings forth abundant blessings; sincerity establishes the foundation of good causes. May we rely upon the honored and secure throne of the precious lineage, enduring as long as Heaven; may we reach the profound and expansive depths of the celestial source, where all realms are transformed. May all sentient beings together ascend the shore of the Dao.

**Pacing the Void**

At that time, the Wondrously Practiced Perfected One ascended and addressed the Heavenly Worthy, saying: "May we hear of the reckoning of yin and yang’s kalpas and revolutions?"

The Heavenly Worthy replied: "The celestial reckoning follows the heavens’ twelve celestial nets and the earth’s twelve terrestrial chronicles. The net revolves through 330 degrees, forming a solar comet; the chronicle advances 3,200 degrees, forming a lunar eclipse. The celestial net completes one cycle in 230 days; the terrestrial chronicle shifts its mechanism once in 2,300 days. When 9,900 degrees are reached, the qi of Heaven and Earth converge—this is called the Great Yang. At 960 degrees, the qi of Heaven and Earth are obstructed—this is also called the Great Kalpa and Great Revolution. Multiplying these numbers, a solar comet occurs once every 330 years, thus constituting the lesser Yang’s ninefold calamity. After 1,809,000 years, the celestial net completes 330,000 cycles, and the terrestrial chronicle advances 3,300 degrees—this is the convergence of the Great Revolution. Now, Heaven moves while Earth is still; yang is restless while yin is slow—hence the anomalies of comets and eclipses. At this time, Heaven’s qi is exhausted in the Great Yin, and Earth’s qi reaches its limit in the Great Yang. When yang is at its extreme, comets appear; when yin is at its extreme, obstruction occurs. When yang is at its extreme, its essence transforms into water; when yin is at its extreme, its essence transforms into fire. Then the world is inundated by great floods, rising to the space beneath the Nine Heavens and descending into the depths of the Nine Earths. Gold and jade dissolve, leaving not even the smallest trace. Thereafter, the Nine Qi reunite—this is called the redivision of the primordial chaos. Then the sages of the Three Heavens and the seed people of the Four Heavens descend to teach and transform, as before. At the beginning of this kalpa, the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors succeeded one another in governance. Such transformations are collectively called the separation and union of the Primordial Qi. The Most High has passed through countless kalpas of such separations and unions. Thus, the *Scripture of Western Ascension* states: 'Movement entails the burden of kalpas; I reflect on the toil of my diligence.' It also says: 'After driving away the old, I open the way for the people of the Great Existence.'"

Thereupon, the Wondrously Practiced bowed his head and said: "Your disciples, unaware of the original source, know not what came before or after. We deeply fear that those born into kalpic revolutions will have no means to preserve themselves. Now, having received this instruction, we are filled with awe and dread. Thus, we prostrate ourselves with utmost sincerity, relying solely upon the Dao. In this life and the next, may we avoid calamity and hardship, ever drawing near to the wondrous Dao. We vow to renew our devotion as one body, wholeheartedly offering reverence to the true and sacred."

With single-minded devotion, we pay homage to the True and Sacred:
We reverently bow to the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Natural.
We reverently bow to the Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy, the Jade Clarity Dao Lord.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Dao and Its Virtue, the Most High Lord Lao.
We reverently bow to the Jade Void Preceptor and Minister, the Mysterious Heavenly Thearch.
We reverently bow to the Sacred Father, the Illuminated Perfected Great Emperor.
We reverently bow to the Sacred Mother, the Jade Perfected Supreme Immortal.
We reverently bow to the Sacred Preceptor, the Abundant Heavenly Great Emperor.
We reverently bow to the Purple Profundity Primordial Lady of the Western Realm.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Golden Watchtower’s Incarnation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Mysterious Origin’s Manifest Response.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Clarity’s Numinous Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Lofty Jade Perfection.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Sun’s Radiant Auspiciousness.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Martial Star’s Responsive Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Void Star’s Responsive Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Danger Star’s Responsive Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Celestial One’s Responsive Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Great One’s Responsive Transformation.
We reverently bow to the Heavenly Worthy of the Chronographic Star’s Responsive Transformation.

We, your disciples, wholeheartedly take refuge in body, mind, and destiny, revering the Mysterious Heaven’s manifest and responsive transformations of all honored and sacred beings.

Your disciple reverently receives the sacred scriptures, as the Most High has taught: "I contemplate sentient beings, drifting and drowning, unable to escape the sea of suffering. This world is called the Abandoned Worthies’ Wondrous Profit Heavenly Realm, also known as the Mixed Retribution World of Defiled Desire. Those born within it perish as soon as they arise, scatter as soon as they gather. Like lightning, they vanish in an instant—impure, foul, and putrid, subject to birth, aging, sickness, and death; to pain, itching, ache, and soreness; to hunger, cold, heat, and dampness; to water, fire, blades, and weapons; to demonic spirits, ghostly thieves, poisonous winds, and malignant afflictions—all mutually inflicting harm. Each thought is impermanent, never lingering even briefly. How much suffering is there? Yet in their present actions, they remain entangled, unaware. How could they believe in the heavenly realms, blessed lands, and immortals—those who attain long life, deathlessness, and effortless freedom? The lives of those born in this world are shorter than mayflies; their joys differ not from dung-beetles. Yet they remain unaware, deeming this happiness—is this not suffering?

Furthermore, I contemplate that all who receive life do so from past karma. Thus, they are endowed with spirit and form, each with its own causes and conditions. Sin and fortune, good and ill—all arise from karma. Differences in lifespan, nobility, wealth, poverty, beauty, ugliness, wisdom, and foolishness—all vary. Even birds, beasts, insects, fish, fowl, dogs, grasses, and trees are likewise."

Moreover, how rare it is for one to receive a human birth—yet in a single moment of ruin, how many kalpas must pass before another chance arises? Thus, I earnestly admonish and exhort you all: diligently cultivate, observe fasts, practice the Dao, recite scriptures, perform rites of repentance, burn incense and light lamps, give alms, confess transgressions, vow to deliver the living and ferry the dead, commission icons and copy scriptures, establish temples and halls, build bridges over streams, and dig wells by the roadside—to aid all travelers and relieve all hardships. Through these manifold expedient means, I prepare the path for future rebirths; what do I seek in return? Let all beings reflect deeply upon this.

Now, in accordance with the Tenth Precept of Cultivating the True in *Xiuzhen Jing*, which states: *"Do not treat speech and laughter lightly, nor let conduct deviate from authenticity."* Yet we disciples, in our heedlessness, allow our minds to wander and our eyes to wander, flailing our arms and swaying our bodies, drowning the Five Constants and neglecting the Three Reverences. Our words are empty and contentious, filled with slander and scorn; our demeanor is reckless and baseless, who would call it upright? How easily we speak, our words hollow and careless—clapping hands in long rebuke, indulging in uproarious laughter, clutching our bellies in uncontrollable mirth, our faces beaming without shame at flattery and deceit. We fabricate falsehoods, act with irreverence and frivolity, our movements arrogant and exaggerated, our comings and goings disorderly and unruly. In all matters of moral conduct, we concern ourselves only with flattery and sycophancy.

From past lives to the present, our accumulated karma—our inherited misfortunes and deluded dispositions—has led us to tread perilous paths. Upon death, we shall fall into hell, suffering for endless kalpas; when that torment is exhausted, we shall be reborn into evil destinies. When that retribution is complete, we may return to this world, yet the lingering consequences of past karma remain, and the cycle of suffering continues unabated. Now, having heard the scriptures’ warnings, how can we not tremble in alarm? Humbly before the sacred, we prostrate in repentance, with reverent hearts we bow in homage:

Having completed these rites of homage to the Heavenly Worthies and Perfected Ones, we now wholeheartedly gaze afar toward the divine palaces. We take refuge in the Purple Sovereign’s Heavenly One Palace of True Felicity, the Court of Primordial Harmony and Karmic Rectification, and the Northern Culmen’s Hall of Protective Sages—all the host of immortals and perfected beings therein.

Today, the assembly of this sacred altar humbly invokes the Lord of Teachings, the Northern Culmen’s Heavenly Guardian, the Protective and Auspicious True Martial Spirit of Blessed Virtue, the Jade Void’s Preceptor, the Mysterious Heavenly Emperor. May they bestow grace and repay virtue, sweep away defilement and dispel miasma, pervade heaven and earth, and awaken those lost in suffering.

Now, on behalf of disciple [Name], we repent the sins of the Tenth Precept—those of treating speech and laughter lightly and allowing conduct to deviate from authenticity. From past lives to the present, the lingering misfortunes of former karma extend upward to our ancestors and downward to our kin. Whether a nation rises or falls, a single careless word may stir the drums of chaos...

Where virtue is cultivated or corrupted, mere hairsbreadths of intent diverge. Some by speech ruin others, while others in idle discourse gather righteousness. Flattering laughter and frivolous play indulge in endless revelry; reckless obstinacy and stubborn pride leap and bound without restraint. Failing to steadfastly uphold virtue, one cannot be called humane—aligned yet discordant, arrogant yet unyielding.

The sins now stand enumerated, evil brimming to its full measure, disturbing the numinous bureaus, ceaselessly recorded and bound. Today, we rely upon the power of repentance, gazing upward in hope of proclaimed grace, beseeching the Three Officials and Nine Courts, the Hundred-Twenty Ministries, the blessed lands and grotto-heavens, the sacred mountains and immortal realms, the great deities of the Auditing and Recording Offices, the patrolling underworld officials, the registrars and their subordinates—to widely extend compassion and together grant absolution.

The repentant disciple [Name], upholding the Mysterious Statutes, entering the Dao and ascending to Perfection through the Precepts, shall practice all goodness and constantly strive to preserve them. From this day forward, I vow to cultivate reverence within, that all movements and repose may be ever more solemn. To maintain sincerity without deceit, that all conduct and self-discipline may be ever more vigilant. Here and now, I openly confess and present this repentance.

We humbly pray for impartial protection, that your watchful gaze may ever be present, bestowing great virtue and pardoning accumulated transgressions. May the seasons be harmonious and orderly, banishing illness, calamity, and misfortune; may the household be tranquil, dispelling water, fire, theft, and banditry. May we ever serve the Supreme Perfection, forever abide in the Mysterious Teachings, and through these blessings adorn all things. May the ancestral line flourish and endure, the frontiers be serene and orderly. May epidemics not spread through contagion, pestilence not arise in circulation. May qi and body be abundant, the times ever attain peace and stability; may spirit flourish and vitality soar, that longevity reach venerable years. May all sentient beings together ascend the shore of the Dao.
