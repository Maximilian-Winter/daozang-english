### **Zhengyi Finger-Teaching Fast Ritual: Vigil and Invocation**

**First, the Furnace is Lit**
The Most High Mysterious Origin, the Five Numinous Venerable Lords, shall summon the Merit-Officer Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the Three Qi Upright Spirits bearing incense. Hasten to report to the Three Heavens’ Most High Mysterious Origin, the Great Dao Lord: your servants now burn incense and invoke the fast’s vigil. May the Eight Directions’ upright qi enter our bodies, that our prayers swiftly ascend before the Perfected and Boundless Dao.

**Next, Facing West**
Your disciple [Name], Merit-Officer of the Left Upright Qi of the Heavenly Master’s Yangping Abbey, bows twice and knocks his head thrice, reverently invoking the Heavenly Master, the Lineage Master, the Female Master, and the Three Masters’ Gatekeepers and Clerks. May we receive the upright qi of the Zhengyi to nourish body and spirit, that the Five Viscera bloom and the Six Palaces flow freely. May the disasters of the Four Quarters be dispelled, the calamities of seven generations dissolved. May we attain long life and enduring vision, becoming flying immortals. Bow twice.

**Next, Facing North**
Your disciple [Name], of the Left Upright Qi of the Heavenly Master’s Yangping Abbey, bows twice and knocks his head, reverently invoking the Supreme August Most High, the Northern Great Dao Lord. This humble one, born of flesh and bone, a withered descendant, beseeches the dissolution of sins—seven generations down to this body—of a thousand transgressions and ten thousand faults, all hidden offenses and secret trespasses against the Three Officials. May they be absolved, that blessings arise in the Five Directions and misfortunes vanish in the Nine Yin. May noxious spirits and malevolent ghosts dare not oppose us. May we envision jade maidens and immortals descending, attaining long life and enduring vision, our years equaling the Three Luminaries. Bow twice.

**Next, Facing East**
Your disciple [Name], of the Left Upright Qi of the Heavenly Master’s Yangping Abbey, bows twice and knocks his head, reverently invoking the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Origin, the Three Heavens’ Boundless Great Dao, the Most High Venerable Lord, the Heavenly Thearch’s Venerable Lord, the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis, the Nine Qi Venerable Lords, the myriad layers of Dao qi, the Twelve Hundred Official Lords, and the Jade Court of Grand Clarity. May our hearts open and minds awaken, our ears and eyes grow keen. May we join the assembly of the Ten Thousand Immortals, be granted jade elixir, dispel disasters, and avert misfortunes. May we attain transcendence, high rank in the world, and golden chariots at our gates. May slanderous tongues and evil calamities, a thousand afflictions and ten thousand woes, be extinguished at once. May our names be recorded by the Three Officials, and may we receive the grace of the Three Heavens’ Venerable Lords. Bow twice.

**Next, Facing South**
Your disciple [Name], of the Left Upright Qi of the Heavenly Master’s Yangping Abbey, bows twice and knocks his head, reverently invoking the Southern Great Dao Lord and the Lord of Ten Thousand Blessings of the Three Heavens. May our names be inscribed in the Jade Registers and reported to the Lords of Destiny, that long life be decreed. We further beseech the Lord of Ten Thousand Blessings of the Three Heavens to bestow wealth from the Four Quarters and silks from the Eight Directions, amassing great abundance. May our meritorious deeds flourish, our every desire fulfilled, every endeavor accomplished, as our hearts wish and our hands direct. May we attain enduring vision and transcendence, our years equaling Heaven and Earth. Bow twice.

**Next, Facing East and West**

Your disciples [Names], of the Left Upright Qi of the Heavenly Master’s Yangping Abbey, reverently invoke the Supreme and Unsurpassed Great Dao, the August Supreme Northern Great Dao Lord, the Southern Great Dao Lord, the Supreme Three Heavens’ Boundless Great Dao Most High Lord Lao, the Heavenly Emperor Lord of the Supreme Elder, the Nine Elders of the Celestial Immortals’ Capital, the Nine Qi Elders, the myriad hosts of Dao qi and the twelve hundred official lords, the August Jade Court of the Supreme Clarity, and the attendants under the Three Masters—Heavenly Master, Lineage Master, and Female Master—entrusted with the registers.

We, your disciples, have long served the registers and abbey, adhering to the laws and upholding them, aiding the state and sustaining destiny, as ordained in the scriptures. We propagate the Dao to benefit all beings, following the aspirations of those who came before. Relying on this principle, we dare to present our humble petition. Today, with sincere devotion, we undertake this fast and recitation.

**Recitation of the Petition**
As stated herein, it is fitting to grant deliverance. In accordance with the ancient rites of Hanzhong, we humbly establish the *Zhijiao* Fast, lasting one day and one night, with rites conducted at the three watches. Tonight, we gather to present this petition. May the Supreme Great Dao Lord, Master of the Teachings of the Four Quarters, and the efficacious Three Masters deign to look upon us, command the various offices, and instruct the officials in charge, along with the local deities, the true officials of upright qi, and the lords of communities and villages, to shield and protect us. May the altar be purified, evil demons averted, and our prayers transmitted, ensuring resonance. May the fast’s merit be fulfilled, its words rewarded, and our petition heard. We beseech further decrees. Your disciples [Names] bow twice and knock their heads.

**Next, Facing West and Seated, the Twelve Laws of Dignified Conduct Are Expounded**

The Orthodox Unity Perfected One and Three Heavens’ Dharma Master states: The *Zhijiao* Fast and Precepts comprise twelve laws.

1. One must not consume beings with blood or vital qi, nor pungent spices; only vegetables may be eaten, except during months contrary to life.
2. At dawn, one drinks congee; at midday, one eats. Thereafter, water does not pass the teeth. By day, incense is burned; by night, lamps are lit. The light of lamps and incense must not falter. One rises and rests without straying from the rules.
3. One abandons worldly entanglements, devoting oneself solely to the Dao.
4. One reflects on the scriptures and precepts, purifying the heart and advancing with diligence.
5. One practices kindness and filial piety toward all, pitying the ignorant, enlightening the foolish, and grieving for them.
6. One repents and atones for transgressions, ever mindful as if holding poison. One knocks the head and strikes the breast, prostrating in utmost sincerity.
7. One renounces worldly rank and wealth, treasuring only the Dao.
8. One toils in body and endures hardship, serving with reverence and devotion, striving for the Dao.
9. One prays to dispel all illnesses, the ten sufferings and eight adversities, to be spared in this world and become a seed of Great Peace.
10. One honors the Dao and esteems virtue, aligning heart and speech. One purifies and advances, maintaining inner and outer cleanliness. During the fast, one performs rites and prostrations without rest or weariness.
11. One recites scriptures and expounds the Dao, calming the heart and settling the mind, with clear intent and no wayward thoughts.
12. At this time, one must strive to enter the precepts and abide in serene contemplation.

**Next, Appointment of Officiants**

**High Master [Name]**: His duty is to embody virtue and power, inwardly filled with dignified conduct and outwardly adorned with proper bearing. Every movement and pause conforms to the ritual standards, revered by the Three Realms and observed by gods and spirits. He petitions, invokes, and praises, communicating with the perfected and summoning the numinous, resolving doubts and guiding the assembly of worthies.

**Chanter [Name]**: His duty is to be well-versed in ritual forms, mastering the regulations. He clarifies principles and guides the uncertain, ensuring every gesture and posture adheres to the proper measure and model. He must not err in recitation or deviate from the rites.

**Supervisor of the Fast [Name]**: His duty is to be steadfast and discerning, with strict and impartial conduct. He disciplines himself and aligns the assembly, serving as a model. Only then may he correct transgressions and uphold the rules. He must not neglect the statutes or indulge in laxity.

**Scripture Attendant [Name]**: His duty is to maintain solemn and respectful attire, reverently tending the hall and altar. He ensures the inner curtain is orderly, the tables and cases aligned, and the scrolls handled with care. He must not disorder the sequence or neglect the scriptures.

**Incense Attendant [Name]**: His duty is to convey words and clarify principles, relying on incense. He ensures the smoke and qi rise in abundance, wafting fragrance. Only then will the sound reach the Great Void and the voice ascend to the celestial realms. He must not allow the embers to smolder or the fragrance to fade.

**Lamp Attendant [Name]**: His duty is to illuminate the darkest night, entrusted with the lamps. He ensures the flames burn evenly and brightly, their light traversing the moon’s path. Only then can the depths of springs and caves be mirrored and illumined. He must not allow the light to flicker or the radiance to dim.

**Next, Returning to the Brazier**

Incense Officials and Envoys, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and all attending spirit officials: May the quiet chamber where the Dao is practiced and the sacred altar where the registers are exposed naturally generate golden liquid, cinnabar essence, and divine mushrooms. May the hosts of spirits and perfected gather before this incense altar, enabling us to attain the Dao and achieve transcendence. May we, your disciples, receive blessings, and our households be favored. May the jade maidens of the eight directions guard the incense smoke, transmitting our words directly to the presence of the Perfected and Boundless Dao.

**Next, Chanting the *Purple Radiance Hymn* and Exiting the Altar**

The purple radiance dances in the mysterious hall,
The primordial qi is ever formless.
It washes the three cinnabar fields,
The eight luminaries receive the lofty clarity.
The seven luminaries shine brightly in their chambers,
Transcendent in the profound darkness.
Serene and meandering by the spring,
The divine dragon shares the reins.
After three cycles, resonance is achieved,
Disasters dispelled, the immortal’s path complete.

The *Zhijiao* Fast Rites of the Orthodox Unity Tradition are now concluded.
