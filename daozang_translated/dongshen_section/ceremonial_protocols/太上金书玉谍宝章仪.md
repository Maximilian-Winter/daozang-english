**The Supreme Golden Writ and Jade Register Precious Petition Ritual**

**Petition for Atonement and Prayer for Peace**

Respectfully, from within this servant’s five bodily palaces of the Perfected Officials, dispatch the Celestial Couriers and Clerks—two each of the Direct Envoys of the Upper Immortals and Upper Numinous Ones, two each of the Orthodox Unity Couriers, two each of the Left Palace Envoys, two each of the Right Palace Envoys, two each of the Yang Spirit Decree Clerks, two each of the Yin Spirit Decree Clerks, the Scarlet Talisman Couriers of the Ritual Chariot, and the Couriers of the Howling Wind Steeds bearing the petition—all clad in solemn attire, crowned with hanging tassels, bearing jade tablets in ordered ranks, standing before this servant to receive the words from his mouth. They shall divide and transmit them, passing through the local earth deities, the Perfected Officials of the winds and qi, the Lords of the Altars and Cities, the Two Mysteries of the Dao, the Three Origins and Four Beginnings, the Lords of the *jiazi* cyclical signs, the Seventy-Two Lords of the Officials, the Four Directions and Quarters, the Lords of the Three Origins’ Examinations and Summonses, and ascend to report to the Supreme Lord Lao, the Supreme Elder, the Celestial Master, the Lady Master, the Heir Master, the Lineage Master, and the Three Masters, as well as the Lords of the Five Qi.

This servant, dull and obstructed, deaf and blind, with sight and hearing impaired, has been mistakenly ordained as a Perfected of the Mysterious Truth. From the day of his investiture, he was bound to assist the Celestial Master, propagate the Orthodox Teachings, succor the hundred clans, and govern humans and spirits. In all petitions and supplications, none may be obstructed. Now, the disciple [Name] has for years endured misfortune and hardship; his dreams are filled with omens of ill, and flocks of crows and magpies clamor around his home. Strange birds and uncanny fowl repeatedly come to screech and jeer. His household trembles as if treading upon thin ice, with no recourse for redress. Today, he has composed his thoughts, calmed his heart, and come before this servant to beg for a petition. In accordance with the Master’s methods, this servant has recorded and submitted a petition on his behalf, now laid bare upon the altar. The Celestial Couriers and Envoys shall jointly examine and ensure its delivery. Humbly, this servant awaits the unfolding of the text.

**Next: The Water Crossing Petition**
The disciple shall kneel, offering it to the Master, who shall unfold and read it aloud. Upon each mention of a name, the disciple shall bow in worship, ensuring the incense smoke remains unbroken.

This servant now solemnly commands the Perfected Officials of the Five Palaces and the Celestial Couriers and Clerks: [Name]’s accumulated transgressions are piled high, his faults vast as the heavens. Fearing this petition may not reach its destination, this servant now additionally invokes the Thirty-Six Void-and-Nothing Direct Talismans, the Thirty-Six Void-and-Nothing Direct Clerks, the Thirty-Six Supreme Clarity Direct Talismans, the Thirty-Six Supreme Clarity Direct Clerks, the Thirty-Six Direct Talismans of the Current Year, the Thirty-Six Direct Clerks of the Current Year, the Thirty-Six Direct Talismans of the Current Month, the Thirty-Six Direct Clerks of the Current Month, the Thirty-Six Direct Talismans of the Current Day, the Thirty-Six Direct Clerks of the Current Day, the Thirty-Six Direct Talismans of the Current Hour, the Thirty-Six Direct Clerks of the Current Hour, twenty Celestial Couriers, four Registrars, twelve Assistants, twelve Couriers for Transmission and Sealing, and twelve Golden Radiance Lads. Together with the Perfected Officials of the Five Palaces and the Celestial Couriers within this servant’s body, this servant respectfully submits a petition on behalf of [Name], now laid bare upon the altar, beseeching that it be delivered to the Jade Emperor of the Sacred Bureau, to the Three Masters’ Gate.

This servant, crude and unrefined, his bodily form unworthy of the great teachings, writes with clumsy characters, his lines uneven, his words erroneous, disordered, and misaligned, failing to meet the ritual standards. The matter rests with the Officials of Yin and Yang, the Secondary Clerks of Yin and Yang, the Four Departments of Petition Records, the Clerks of Petition Transcription, the Couriers of Transmission, and the Minor Clerks of Practice. As this petition advances, they shall correct its errors, turning left and right as needed, ensuring its proper ascent to the Celestial Treasury. Should any subordinate officials obstruct the qi, or should the demonic thieves of the Six Heavens block or intercept the petition, preventing its timely ascent, they shall be handed over to the Red-Beamed Northern Prison of the Celestial Offices for punishment according to the law. This servant’s petition shall ascend in due course to the Supreme Lord’s presence, passing through the Left Lord’s checkpoint and the Right Clerks, then through the successive gates of the various Lords, ensuring every matter is delivered.

May what this servant strikes be shattered, what he treats be healed, what he reclaims be obtained, and what he transforms be believed. The Celestial Couriers shall receive the petition and examine the text, distinguishing the hours without delay, to manifest the celestial decree.

This servant’s submission is complete. The Perfected Officials, Celestial Couriers, and Clerks shall now withdraw. Those within this servant’s body shall re-enter through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries, returning to the left if they came from the left, to the right if from the right. The Celestial Couriers and Envoys shall lead and supervise, returning to their original positions, awaiting this servant’s next summons, when they shall emerge again as before.

**Three rounds of teeth-clicking and saliva-swallowing.**
Softly intone:
*"May the Celestial Couriers each return to their Golden Halls and Jade Chambers. When summoned again, they shall emerge as before."*
This servant bows twice and knocks his head to the ground.

**Completion of the Petition Ritual.**

With reverence, this servant summons forth from within his body the Perfected Officials of the Five Viscera, the Couriers and Clerks—each twelve in number—to emerge. From the left division of the Three Heavens’ Celestial Numinous Ascending Petition Couriers, two officials emerge; from the right division, two officials emerge; from the central division, two officials emerge. From the Yang Heaven, two Deciding Clerks emerge; from the Earth Immortals, two Deciding Clerks emerge; from the Sacred Canon, two Deciding Clerks emerge; from the Ascending Origin, two Deciding Clerks emerge; from the Flying Chariot, two Deciding Clerks emerge; from the Rising Corpse, two Deciding Clerks emerge; from the Grand Physicians, two Deciding Clerks emerge; from the Upper Selection, two Deciding Clerks emerge; from the Middle Selection, two Deciding Clerks emerge. From the Left Official Envoys, two emerge; from the Right Official Envoys, one emerges, then another. From the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks, two emerge; from the Gale-Wind Post Riders and Mounted Petition Couriers, each two emerge.

Those who emerge shall don solemn attire and resplendent robes, their caps and sashes adorned with pendants, their regalia arrayed in formation before, behind, to the left, and to the right of this servant. They shall receive this servant’s words, distinguish and transmit them, and take up this servant’s petition to ascend to the Sacred Bureau. They shall inquire of the local earth deities and territorial spirits, the Perfected Officials who infuse qi, the overseers and summoners, the officials of the sexagenary cycle, the male and female officials, the male and female functionaries of the twenty-four offices, the Left and Right Commanders, the Central Palace Heralds, and the various officials of the Qiang, Hu, and Yi peoples. They shall report above to the Most High Lord Lao, the Most High Elder, the Celestial Masters, Female Masters, Heir Masters, and Lineage Masters—the Three Masters—and to the Lords of the Five Qi and their generals, officers, and soldiers, each governing their respective domains. The Right Officials shall sequentially report, faithfully recording their merits.

On the seventh day of the first month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the merits of life shall be determined and recorded; on the fifth day of the tenth month, the merits of the comprehensive petition shall be reported. Moreover, certain male officials, acting with sincere devotion, have previously submitted itemized registers of the households of this servant’s subjects, including their affiliated prefectures, counties, townships, and hamlets, their names, household registers, and ages, which have been duly filed. Now, this servant respectfully offers wine, fruit, fermented brew, and common sacrificial provisions, presenting them with utmost sincerity. Along with paper memorials, he humbly submits this petition, reporting merits and offering congratulations, beseeching the supervising officials, the overseers of the kitchens, the attending clerks, and the practicing scribes to descend together, to tread upon the site of this offering and enact its purpose, ensuring no errors or discrepancies. The immortal officials and scribes shall remain at this servant’s left and right.

Next, recite the Water Crossing Petition. The disciple shall kneel and present it to the master, who shall receive and read it aloud, ensuring the incense smoke remains unbroken.

With solemn command, this servant again instructs the Perfected Officials of the Five Viscera, the masters of the Three Daoist Schools, the various Lords and Elders, the Celestial Masters, Female Masters, Heir Masters, and Lineage Masters—the Three Masters—and the Lords of the Five Qi: today, seated here, having partaken of food and drink, and received their due rewards, let bolts of silk and copper coins serve as modest tokens of gratitude. Once the kitchen overseers have completed their duties, let each return to the celestial bureaus within this servant’s body. The Couriers, Envoys, Officers, and Soldiers shall return to the left if they came from the left, to the right if from the right, coiling around this servant’s body and weaving through his hundred meridians.

This servant humbly beseeches the supervising officials to pardon the thousand transgressions and myriad faults accumulated within his body, that he may be spared punishment and reprimand. As for the immortal officials, celestial numinous officers, generals, officers, soldiers, scribes, and practicing clerks who have emerged, let them, according to their respective duties and jurisdictions, erase sins and absolve errors, strike names from the registers of death, and inscribe them in the Jade Calendar and the Ledger of Longevity. May those they protect be preserved, those they elevate ascend, and those they petition receive response. Let the Guardian Generals of the Body and the Divine Youths of the Dharma accompany and shield this servant, surveying all matters as they arise. Once their proclamations are complete, let them return within this servant’s body, re-entering through the Gate of Myriad Mysteries to their respective chambers. When summoned again, they shall emerge once more to serve. This servant bows twice and knocks his head to the ground.

**Petition for the Protection of the Infant**

With reverence, this servant summons forth from within his body the Perfected Officials of the Five Viscera, the Couriers and Clerks—each two in number—to emerge. From the Upper Immortals and Upper Numinous Officials, two Courier Officials emerge; from the upper division of the Upper Immortals and Upper Numinous Ascending Petition Couriers, two officials emerge; from the middle division, two officials emerge; from the lower division, two officials emerge. From the Left and Right Official Envoys, the Yin-Yang Spirit Mediators, the Scarlet Talisman Chariot Clerks—each two emerge; from the Gale-Wind Post Riders and Mounted Petition Couriers, each two emerge. From the Perfected Officials of the Five Viscera, two Courier Clerks emerge. From the Upper Illuminated Infant Disaster-Resolving Envoys, two emerge; from the Upper Perfected Infant Tribulation-Passing Envoys, two emerge; from the Upper Life Ministers of the Central Clear Abyss, two emerge; from the Upper Life Ministers of the River’s Central Flow, two emerge; from the Middle Perfected Three Origins Tribulation-Passing Envoys, two emerge; from the Middle Perfected Three Officials Overseeing the River, two emerge; from the Middle Perfected Life Officials Overseeing the Yangtze, two emerge; from the Middle Perfected Three Officials of Life, two emerge; from the Lower Prefecture’s Water Officials of Dao and Virtue, two emerge; from the Middle Origin’s Jiangying Communicating Envoys, two emerge; from the Lower Illuminated Water’s Petitioning Envoys, two emerge; from the Lower Life’s Clear Abyss Life-Rescuing Envoys, two emerge; from the Upper Origin’s Celestial Officials of Pardon, two emerge; from the Middle Origin’s Earth Officials of Absolution, two emerge; from the Lower Origin’s Water Officials of Forgiveness, two emerge; from the Three Officials’ Huai and Ji Life-Registering Envoys, two emerge.

Those who emerge shall don solemn attire and resplendent robes, their caps and sashes adorned with pendants, their dignity and bearing impeccable. Arrayed above and below, they shall assist in submitting this petition, moving to report to the Water Officials’ Bureau, to the Three Rapids and Five Lakes, to the Huai and Ji River Administrations, and to the seas and rivers. They shall appeal to the Celestial Bureaus’ Perfected Venerables and Daoist Masters on behalf of this servant’s child, so-and-so, who since birth has suffered unceasing calamities. Moreover, this servant fears that the wanton demonic spirits of the Six Heavens may harm the Three Officials, that the Three Malevolences may escape restraint and secretly assail him, that he may wrongfully suffer external misfortunes and internal demonic afflictions, and that the stone-dwelling dog-children, wet nurses, cats, rats, soldiers, hunters, and qi-ghosts may repeatedly inflict harm. With no recourse, this servant’s entire household, with single-minded devotion and exhausted thoughts, purifies its heart and surrenders its fate...

The Three Venerable Dao-Masters—the Most High Lord Lao, the Orthodox Unity Perfected Person, the Old Master by the River, and the Jade Maiden Transcendent Spirits of the Lakes—oversee all, with numinous officials delivering calamities, august deities wielding talismans, and registry-bearing messengers. They come to this servant’s petition, unraveling the origins of misfortune. According to the precepts and methods of my former master, I reverently compile this document for submission, laying it bare upon the case. I invoke the celestial officials, generals, and soldiers to guard and escort, transmitting it without delay, standing at my left and right, wherever I proceed or halt, to attend my review of the document’s text.

Next, the Water-Deliverance Petition: the disciple kneels, holding it up to the master, who receives and recites it, ensuring the incense smoke in the censer does not extinguish. Calling the names, they bow twice.

I solemnly charge the Perfected Officials and Direct Messengers, the left and right scribes, the attending minor clerks, the Direct Talisman and Direct Service officials, the Palace Officials of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, who oversee the Three Rivers and Four Seas, the Eight Poles and Five Lakes, the Jade Maidens of the Rivers, and the Transcendent Officials in charge—this servant reverently submits on behalf of so-and-so’s household a Great Petition for the Protection of the Infant, sealing it upon completion. Fearing inauspicious days and ominous hours, lest the petition fail to reach its destination, its words disordered or sentences awry, I beseech the Transcendent Officials and Direct Messengers, the twelve scribes, to wield long, sharp brushes, amending each line, and with dragon-sword writing knives, to excise and correct superfluous or erroneous characters, ensuring nothing is omitted, that it may promptly reach the Most High’s presence to manifest its efficacy and sincerity.

Yet I fear that so-and-so’s deep-rooted karmic burdens may afflict his sons and daughters, or that past evil karma may harm his household, extending calamities and sinking them into profound ruin. Should the petition’s words be lost or delayed in transmission, I earnestly invoke the Thirty-Six Void Direct Talisman Officials, the Thirty-Six Void Direct Service Officials, the Thirty-Six Supreme Clarity Direct Talisman Officials, the Thirty-Six Supreme Clarity Direct Service Officials, the Thirty-Six Direct Talisman Officials of the Current Year, the Thirty-Six Direct Service Officials of the Current Year, the Thirty-Six Direct Talisman Officials of the Current Month, the Thirty-Six Direct Service Officials of the Current Month, the Thirty-Six Direct Talisman Officials of the Current Day, the Thirty-Six Direct Service Officials of the Current Day, the Thirty-Six Direct Talisman Officials of the Current Hour, and the Thirty-Six Direct Service Officials of the Current Hour, to encircle and escort the petition, ensuring its delivery.

Once the petition is submitted, the Merit-Officials, Messengers, Generals, and Soldiers within this servant’s body shall all return to the Golden Hall and Jade Chamber within me—those on the left returning to the left, those on the right to the right, those before to the front, those behind to the rear—entering through the Gates of Myriad Wonders, coiling around my body, encompassing heaven and earth, entwining my four limbs, and weaving through my hundred meridians. When summoned again, they shall emerge to attend to their duties, as before.

**Petition to Slay Evil and Destroy Ghosts**

I reverently dispatch the Perfected Officials of the Five Bodily Viscera and Merit-Officials within this servant’s body, ascending to the Supreme Three Heavens—the Pure Tenuity Heaven, the Yu-Yu Heaven, and the Great Scarlet Heaven—along with the Supreme Nine Heavens’ Scarlet Yang Three-Five Merit-Officials, the Twelve High Chariot Primordial Spirits of the August Sovereign, the Scarlet Qi Scarlet Chariot Messengers, the Primordial Qi of the Mysterious Origin Messengers, the Yin-Yang True Qi Messengers, the Yellow Writ Contract Decree Covering Lords, Generals, and Soldiers, the Yin-Yang Life-Generating Lords, the Lords and Clerks of the Dao-Deliverance, Calamity-Dispersal, and Misfortune-Resolution, the Heaven-Transforming and Delusion-Dispelling Divine Lords and Soldiers, the Womb-Enveloped Perfected Persons, the Red Pine Lord and Womb-Enveloped Perfected Officials, and the Scarlet Chariot Soldiers and Clerks—twelve each.

From within this servant’s body, I dispatch two Direct Messengers of the Upper Transcendent and Upper Numinous Bureaus, two Merit-Officials of the Qin Clan’s Two Bureaus and Three Divisions, two Merit-Officials of the Orthodox Unity’s Former Registers, two Merit-Officials of the Upper Division to Record Evil, two Merit-Officials of the Middle Division to Record Evil, two Merit-Officials of the Lower Division to Record Harm, two Merit-Officials of the Urgent Qi Division to Record Harm and Rebellion, two Messengers of the Upper Division to Seize Evil, Rebellion, and External [Entities], to Retrieve Souls and Register Spirits, two Messengers of the Middle Division to Retrieve Souls and Register Spirits, two Messengers of the Lower Division to Bind and Reverse [the Heads of] the Rebellious, two Clerks to Twist Hands and Sever Heads, two Scarlet Chariot Messengers to Supervise Executions, two Clerks of the Marketplace, two High Chariot Messengers, two Clerks to Shave Heads and Sever Ears, two Messengers to Supervise Executions of External [Entities], two Clerks to Supervise Seizures and Trials, two Clerks to Supervise Long-Sword Beheadings, two Clerks of the Rigorous Wind Cavalry to Enforce the Law, Seize Rebels, and Execute Slayings.

The Merit-Official Messengers, in solemn attire with pendent tassels and ceremonial regalia, receive this servant’s words to distinguish and report. With the following plea now presented, I beseech the capture of the external [entity], such-and-such ghost, who has repeatedly trespassed and offended. According to the True Precepts of the Celestial Master, cherishing life and detesting killing, rewarding good and punishing evil, and propagating the transformative power of the Dao, I make this earnest appeal on behalf of this mortal. Following my master’s methods, beneath the radiant stars, I bow and submit a Scarlet Petition, addressing and indicting the external [entity], such-and-such ghost. I beseech the local Earth Gods, the Qi-Monitoring Perfected Officials, the Wardens of the Domain, and the invoked Celestial Officials, Generals, and Soldiers to unite in capturing these malevolent and rebellious ghosts, to hook their livers and drag their ears, to tear out their intestines and pluck their lungs, and to bring them to the marketplace. The tongue-pulling, throat-pinching, and left-right seizing clerks, along with the head-suspending, shaving, and beheading clerks, shall stand at this servant’s front and rear, awaiting my commands to proclaim the petition’s text.

Next, the Water-Deliverance Petition: the disciple kneels, holding it up to the master, who receives and recites it, offering incense without letting the smoke extinguish.

I solemnly charge the Perfected Officials of the Five Bodily Viscera, the Merit-Official Generals, Soldiers, Scribes, and Minor Clerks, the Heavenly Master, the Female Master, the Lineage Master, the System Master, and the Lords of the Five Qi under the Three Masters’ tutelage. This servant reverently submits a Petition to Dispel Calamities, Resolve Harm, Slay and Behead the Malevolent, and Destroy Ghosts, presenting it to...

Beneath the jurisdiction of the Three Heavenly Gates of the Sacred Bureau, the Perfected Officials of the Five Bodily Viscera within this servant’s person, along with the three-five minor clerks, twelve scribal assistants, and merit-official messengers—all donning coronets that pierce the heavens and luminous jade pendants, girded with five-colored sashes, and bearing jade tablets—shall complete their solemn preparations, grind ink and dip their brushes, and descend in timely fashion. They are charged to inscribe the petition for this household and present it to the Heavenly Offices for the apprehension of demonic malefactors. Should any subordinate officials, qi-ghosts, bandit specters, or road-blocking fiends obstruct or sever this petition’s ascent, I now solemnly invoke:

When summoned again, they shall emerge to execute their duties, all in accordance with precedent.

This servant bows his head and prostrates twice.

**Ritual Procedure:**
Construct an altar by the riverbank and arrange a high seat. Establish incense fires in the five directions. Upon completion of the petition’s recitation, burn it at the Heavenly Gate.
