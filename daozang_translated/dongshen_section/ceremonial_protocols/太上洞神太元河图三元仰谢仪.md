**Preface to *The Supreme Cavernous Divine Great Primeval River Chart Triple Origin Reverent Thanksgiving Rites***
Revised by Master Guangcheng, Du Guangting

The scripture states: The method of reverent thanksgiving according to the *River Chart* is a practice that those who study the Dao should constantly perform, for it enables them to transcend the calamity of the great flood and ascend as the *Seed People*. When faced with warfare, fire, floods, droughts, locust plagues, celestial omens and anomalies, the unnatural shifting of heaven and earth, the collapse of mountains and the drying of rivers, the eclipses of sun and moon, untimely winds and frosts, destructive thunder and lightning, malevolent qi stirring disorder, ghosts and demons misleading the masses, the four borders in turmoil, or the ravages of fierce beasts—when the Son of Heaven or lords of states are unsettled, or when illness, adversity, and inauspicious signs arise, even to the point of peril among the common people—one must petition and give thanks to heaven and earth, moving the profound and boundless firmament, only then can deliverance be attained.

The Dao of heaven pities all beings, and the mysterious sages extend their compassion. The Most High revealed the scriptures of the *River Chart* and *Luo Writing*—the texts of the tortoise and dragon, the azure script on green carapaces—to bestow upon the emperors. This is the method by which the people may invoke blessings, atone for transgressions, transcend adversity, and resolve calamities. When practiced, it aligns above with the Dao of heaven, and every invocation receives response.

The Three Primordials’ Reverent Petition Rite is conducted on *ren-chen* and *gui-si* days, during the *xu-hai* hours. *Xu* and *hai* are the Celestial Gate, where the serpent faces the pivot; when one understands change, it becomes a dragon, and when the dragon seizes the moment, one who discerns transformation enters the Dao. *Xu-hai* is the ford of the Celestial Gate, while *chen-si* is the pivot and mechanism of dragon and serpent. To awaken and seek the true, one must follow these days—thus the use of *chen-si* days. *Ren* is where yang qi is born, the station of the Great One. Therefore, the *xu-hai* hours are chosen to ascend the altar and offer thanks.

The *zi* hour marks the inception of yang qi’s flow. Daoist methods grasp images to guide beings, subdue ghosts, command spirits, govern heaven, and order humanity—employing the twelve earthly branches for their purpose. Virtue is established in *zi*, completion is displayed in *chou*, caution against decline in *yin*, vigilance against failure in *mao*, strategic thought unfolds in *chen*, ebb and flow are applied in *si*, rescue from collapse in *wu*, stabilization in *wei*, prevention of chaos in *shen*, great expansion in *you*, return to the root in *xu*, and great peace in *hai*. Returning to the root exhausts yin qi, while great peace elevates yang qi. When the Dao operates, yang ascends; when water is gentle, it harmonizes with the Dao—thus *ren* and *gui* prevail, for they align with yang and accord with the Dao.

In urgent cases of prayer or thanksgiving where the *ren-chen* day has not yet arrived, the *yin* hour may be used to guard against decline, *wu* to rescue from collapse, and *xu* to return to the root. These three earthly branches, in their respective days and hours, may also be employed in haste, for they harmonize with the Dao of heaven. If one’s cinnabar sincerity moves the divine, all days become efficacious without strict adherence to these times.

Three days prior to the rite, sweep and purify the inner and outer spaces, abstain from all mundane affairs, and admonish attendants and companions to maintain utmost solemnity. The mind must be fully prepared, with no lapse in reverence and care.

*The Most High’s Cavern-Spirit Great Primordial River Chart: Rites of the Three Primordials’ Reverent Petition*
**Altar Hall, First Section**
The altar hall should be situated nearby to facilitate the ritual proceedings.

The dimensions—whether spacious or modest, ample or restrained—should be determined by the available space. The quarters for guests and hosts must not encroach upon the altar hall or its courtyard. The kitchen and bathing chamber should be kept far from the latrine. Inner and outer areas must be distinctly separated, with care taken to prevent any exposure. If the dwelling is cramped, reinforce the partitions with diligence, using fresh and clean curtains, reed mats, and woven screens. Ensure complete separation, allowing no mingling of smoke or odors.

Within the oratory hall, the central position facing forward is reserved for the Most High. To the left and right, arrange the scriptures and treasures, the master’s seat, and the space for recitation and discourse. Screens, curtains, tables, and stands—along with incense, lamps, censers, and containers—should be arranged neatly around the hall, all kept immaculate.

**Hall Positions**
For the detailed layout of the altar diagram and pillar inscriptions, refer to the *Huanglu Licheng Yi*.

**Altar Positions**
Tai Sui | Ben Ming | Xing Nian | Yuan Chen | Sheng Yue | Tai Yue
You Nian | San Qiu | Wu Mu | Jiu You
Palace | Residence | Gate | Door | Window | Bed
Hall | Chamber | Well | Hearth | Latrine | Drain
Granary | Storehouse | Garden

To the right, arrange forty lamps according to their positions, each marked with a placard.

**Second: Arrangement of the Deity Positions**
For the deity positions within the hall, create a level altar (*shan*) in the courtyard, measuring three *zhang* and nine *chi* on each side, corresponding to the Three Realms and Nine Ramparts. Beyond the altar, maintain an eight-*chi* purification boundary, marked with a cord. At the four corners, place eight lamps, totaling thirty-two lamps. Each lamp stands nine *chi* high, corresponding to the Nine Mysteries and Thirty-Two Heavens.

Next, construct a second altar measuring two *zhang* and four *chi* on each side, corresponding to the twenty-four *qi*. At its four corners, place seven lamps, totaling twenty-eight lamps. Each lamp stands five *chi* high, corresponding to the Five Stars and Twenty-Eight Constellations. Between the twenty-eight constellations, at the four cardinal directions, place one lamp each, and at the exact center, place one lamp, with two additional lamps flanking them. These stand seven *chi* high, corresponding to the Seven Luminaries.

Seven *chi* beyond this lies the Heavenly Center (*Tianxin*), a square measuring one *zhang* on each side. At its exact center, place ten lamps, with two additional lamps beside them. Each stands seven *chi* high, corresponding to the Dipper. Before the Heavenly Center, set a table where no incense is burned, reserved for the *Da Luo* talisman. To the left of the talisman, place another table with one incense burner. To its right, place a table with four incense burners. At the four directions around the talisman, place one table each with a single incense burner.

Beyond the altar, arrange ninety-one lamps for the principal deities, each five *chi* high. These include:
- Tai Yi, the Twelve Earthly Branches, and the Twenty-Four *Qi*;
- Tai Sui, Ben Ming, Xing Nian, Yuan Chen, Sheng Yue, Tai Yue, You Nian, San Qiu, Wu Mu, and Jiu You (sixty-one lamps in total);
- Two lamps each for the Palace, Residence, Gate, Door, Window, Bed, Hall, Chamber, Well, Hearth, Latrine, Drain, Granary, Storehouse, and Garden (thirty lamps in total).
In all, one hundred seventy lamps are used.

The talismans (*ce*) are made of cypress, fragrant wood, or bamboo, measuring one *chi* and two *cun* in length, four *cun* and four *fen* in width, and three *fen* in thickness. The talisman boards follow the same dimensions, each nine *cun* long, one *cun* and eight *fen* wide, and two *fen* thick, with a hole at the top for threading silk cords. They may be hung or placed as needed. There are sixty-four talisman boards and two hundred three lamp placards, each seven *cun* long, one *cun* wide, and two *fen* thick, to be suspended. One talisman governs sixty deities, and the boards follow the same principle.

Lamps dispel darkness and augment light, forsaking yin to embrace yang. Three layers of mats are laid out, and beyond them, screens and barriers are set up, all of the finest quality. Every required item must be prepared to the fullest extent possible. To possess the means yet fail to do so incurs the sin of miserliness and disrespect for the Dao, as well as the punishment of laziness—no transgression, however minor, will be pardoned. In cultivating merit and virtue, fervor is paramount. Furthermore, one must not seize what does not belong to them, nor forcibly beg or coerce loans, lest they offend the divine and incur irredeemable blame. Those who prepare with care and precision will receive boundless blessings. Ascending from low to high, transforming humble to noble, accumulating the subtle to achieve the manifest, refining the false into the true—this dissolves the twenty-eight knots of karmic roots within the body and resolves the nine hundred and six disasters of yang. It penetrates the mysteries of the highest realm, ensuring the joy of long life. If emperors and kings practice this, they may commune with the divine, harmonize yin and yang, secure national peace and popular harmony, and avert the three disasters of flood, fire, and warfare, as well as epidemics. How can one not strive with diligence?

For the gates, use eight long placards and four eave placards, affixed with nails and loops for hanging signs. Between the gates, place twenty short placards, with sixty-four *chi* of red cord made of ramie fiber. The gate signs measure six *cun* in width and five *cun* in length, with overlapping wings for symmetry.

The above forty-nine characters are inscribed in purple. This single talismanic tablet, made of bamboo, is placed facing south at the appropriate time, its head oriented north at the center, on a separate stand with incense. This is called the *Mirrorm Talisman*; the script should be finely rendered to fit. The method for inscribing the bamboo tablets and talismans requires vermilion script; in urgent circumstances where vermilion is unavailable, ink may be used. The *Mirrorm Talisman* is inscribed in purple to communicate with the Imperial Ultimate of the Non-Image. When seen, it brings auspicious prosperity, mutual generation and restraint, inner and outer harmony, each with its proper function. Take care not to misplace or exchange it.

The lamp talismans listed to the right are to be visualized facing east for invocation and prayer rituals.

*Jia-yin, Bing-yin, Wu-yin, Geng-yin, Ren-yin*—all positioned in the north of the eastern direction.
*Yi-mao, Ding-mao, Ji-mao, Xin-mao, Gui-mao*—all positioned in the center of the eastern direction.

The six *jia* positions, each with five stations, must be clearly recognized to repel evil; do not seek correctness recklessly. Record names as before, inscribing them on slips.
This is the method for visualization and invocation facing north.

All lamp tablets, talismans, and inscribed slips should be adorned with colors and paintings, firmly glued so that even wind and rain cannot displace them until the ritual’s completion. If damaged or soiled, repair them while invoking the true spirits. Strict cleanliness is essential to attract blessings. If violent wind or rain arrives, move the lamps accordingly.

The qi of all heavens congeals into stars and coalesces into mountains. Celestial stars correspond to human affairs, governing the order of humanity. Thus, the *He Tu*’s dragon patterns unfold to reveal this to the world. Those who know and cultivate it may dissolve calamities and attract blessings.

The beginning lies in the north: bowing to the constellations as the starting point, the mind focuses on the celestial path, retracing the stellar officials in reverse order, following their degrees in circular return, awaiting the encounter with mysterious blessings.

For the Four Cardinal Directions, perform twelve bows each. The *Da Luo* talismanic writs, inscribed tablets, lamp slips, and titles of the celestial ranks follow the same method as the east-facing rite. The slips and talismans inscribed must face east in spring, south in summer, west in autumn, and north in winter, oriented toward the Sovereign in purity. After burning incense and completing the inscriptions, suspend them before the talismanic writs.

The master washes and rinses, facing the Sovereign, closes his eyes, clenches his fists, and visualizes the spirits. He arranges the talismans and slips upon the altar table, taps his teeth thirty-two times, swallows saliva thirty-two times, and recites the talisman incantation:

*"Descend and ascend, the Nine Mysterious Blessings;
The Yellow Radiance first connects the divine qi—
the rite is complete."*

He then gathers the talismans and writs, visualizing the spirits as before, and recites another incantation:

*"Should wind and thunder transform, or public and private matters press,
temporarily gather the talismans and writs—no need for incantation.
Cultivate goodness, guard the Mysterious, rectify hun and po;
the Three Heavens bestow blessings, the Nine Lords command."*

The number of attending officials in the writs changes with the seasons: ten in spring, a hundred in summer, a thousand in autumn, ten thousand in winter, and a hundred million in all four seasons, with the Five Transformations circulating throughout. From the Son of Heaven to the common people, all may employ the hundred-million number for superiority.

The numerical correspondences are: nine in the east, three in the south, seven in the west, and five in the north—these are the qi numbers. *Zi* and *Geng*, *Chou* and *Xin* align with seven as Metal; *Yin* and *Wu*, *Mao* and *Ji* align with three as Fire—these are the qi numbers of the Five Phases. Thus, the east’s nine qi form the Azure Heaven.

For those who perform this retreat, the scripture states: first, visualization to stabilize the mind’s karma; second, prayer and vows to cultivate the mouth’s karma; third, bowing and rites to transform the body’s karma. Replacing evil with good depends solely on utmost sincerity. Once the Three Karmas are reformed, a hundred blessings will arrive—how can one not strive for this?

The square altar or ritual space should measure fifty-five feet on each outer side, corresponding to the *Da Luo* Heaven’s *Dayan* number. The altar’s height is one *zhang* and two *chi*, with gates five *chi* wide. The scattered altars are nine *chi* wide, and the gate plaques are inscribed in a space three *cun* and three *fen* square. In the four directions and the center, place sixty lamps, each six *chi* tall. Generally, around two hundred thirty lamps may be used; if the space is narrow or resources limited, reduce them to no fewer than thirty-two.

Choose an auspicious time, prepare the ritual implements, gather Daoist companions, and invite esteemed masters. All must bathe, wear fresh and clean garments, and arrive at the retreat site beforehand. For three days, abstain from meat and impurities, sever worldly affairs, and maintain a single-minded purity to await the rites.

Those assisting in miscellaneous tasks should not be numerous—too many cause disturbance. Select only those who are reverent, cautious, and respectful to fulfill their duties. Rotate shifts for rest, ensuring no one sleeps simultaneously. The incense attendants must keep the fragrance rich, day and night unbroken. The lamp attendants must ensure brightness, their radiance extending until dawn.

At dawn, the retreat officers offer congee; at midday, vegetarian meals—all must be pure, fresh, and sweet, free from blood, meat, or impure ingredients. Only naturally ripened fruits may be used; do not consume vegetables facing the Sovereign. Hosts and guests alike must be diligent and earnest, with humility as the highest virtue.

This retreat has no official positions; petitions are made only at the two court audiences of dawn and dusk. As in the *Lingbao* rites, bow to the directions and make announcements; by evening, offer grand thanks.

Before entering the chamber, recite the incantation:

*"The Primordial Qi of the Three Origins enters my body,
communicating all petitions to be heard above."*

After completion, proceed with the *Huaxia* hymn. Lead the procession with praises, and arrange the banners and staffs before the altar. The exit follows the same procedure.

**Entering the Altar (Third Rite)**
Enter the altar after the *Hai* hour. The assembled officers proceed from the retreat hall in orderly ranks, chanting and leading the way to the Celestial Gate at the *Hai* hour. After the master recites the incantation, he enters the altar enclosure, circumambulates the outer heaven once to the left, reaching *Xu*, then circles the Three Luminaries once. The master stands at his position, while the officers circumambulate the Three Luminaries to the south, facing north and standing upright. The cantor intones, and each bows to the master, visualizing as prescribed.

**Visualizing the Spirits (Fourth Rite)**
The master strikes the ritual drum thirty-two times, closes his eyes, and inwardly visualizes: first the Three Treasures, then the Three Masters who transmitted the rites, then the Three Ones, then the thirty-six thousand spirits, arrayed within and without, guarding body and mind. He clearly envisions the thirty-three heavens, the seventy-four directions, and beholds the boundless divine qi, clouds swirling in harmony, along with the celestial officials, earthly administrators, the Nine Palaces, Seven Luminaries, Five Phases, Six *Jia*, Earth Sovereign, Cavern Spirits, all perfected immortals, generals, officers, soldiers, functionaries, and attendants—all simultaneously gathering in the void, encircling the altar in solemn order.

He prays: *"Today, we submit to the Heavenly Worthy; may hosts and guests receive grace, and all, living and deceased, be blessed with fortune."*

Next, the cantor intones and strikes the ritual drum thirty-two times. The master, having finished striking the drum, swallows saliva thirty-two times and kneels to offer incense.

**Offering Incense (Fifth Rite)**
The master offers incense at the four burners beside the writ table, thirty-three times in total: six pinches in one burner, sixteen in another, eight in another, and three in the last. Upon completion, he rises.

Two officers serve as incense attendants, entering through the Earth Gate to retrieve the four incense burners. One exits through the Celestial Gate, offering incense before the assembled officers. Each offers three pinches. After the incense offering, the attendants re-enter through the Celestial Gate, return the burners to their original places, exit through the Earth Gate, and resume their positions.

Next, the cantor intones, and each states their name and position, then recites the incense-burner incantation:

**Kindling the Burner (Sixth Rite)**
*"The Supreme Clarity, Mysterious Capital, Great Cavern, Three Radiance disciple, the Most High Three Caverns Master, performing the Great Mystery *He Tu* Grand Thanksgiving Rites, the Perfected of [specific] Mountain and [specific] Emperor, the Lesser Servant of the Realized, [Name], humbly invokes:

On this most auspicious night of [specific date], we, your ministers, reverently receive the Emperor’s devout command, prostrating ourselves in earnest sincerity. We burn incense, establish the fast, perform rites of gratitude, repentance, and supplication, and humbly present this petition. May malevolent vapors be swept away, true *qi* descend, and mysterious blessings flow and permeate the Emperor’s person and our own.

One bow.
**Eighth Repentance**

Kneeling prostrate, knocking our heads to the ground, we focus our essence and will, without donning rabbit crowns or loosening our hair.

Disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Clarity, Supreme Masters of the Three Caverns, we, who perform the rites of repentance and audience according to the *Tai Xuan He Tu*, the Mountain Lord of [such-and-such] Peak, the Emperor Lord of [such-and-such] Realm, and the Lesser Omen Perfected, your humble servants [Name] and others, with utmost sincerity jointly address and supplicate the Unsurpassed, Unprioritized, Non-Acting, and Limitless Great Brahma *qi* of the Void and Tranquil Mysterious Essence, the Supreme Limitless Dao, the Divine Lord of the Dao within the Dao, the Jade Emperor, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Lords, the Thirty-Nine Supreme Perfected, the Ten Directions and Five Offices, the Kings and Chancellors, the High Ministers and Assistants, the Barrier-Heaven and Rampart-Earth, all mountains, all waters, all suns, moons, and stellar lodges, the Heavenly Masters of all grotto-heavens and palaces, the host of Perfected and Saints who have attained the Dao, the Responsive and Venerable Saints, the immeasurable and orthodox Perfected of the past, present, and future across boundless worlds and innumerable multitudes, and all divine immortals and spirit officials.

We, dust-bound and base, dull in wisdom and perception, have by karmic fortune encountered the transformative power of the Dao, early embraced the true teachings, and been granted the sacred scriptures. Overwhelmed by the grace bestowed upon us, our joy and gratitude know no bounds. Yet, as the luminous statutes reward goodness and permit merit-making as a priority, we are called to assist the state and deliver the people, to offer our sincerity and devotion. However, we have failed to firmly uphold the resolve of mountain-dwelling reclusion or to elevate the merit of withdrawing from the world. Constantly fearing the end of our allotted span and the reproach of the dark night, we have betrayed the teachings of the Heavenly Perfected and the grace of the Great Dao. Time slips away, and our meager contributions remain unfulfilled. Relying on the compassionate mercy of forgiveness, we pledge our utmost sincerity and, together with like-minded companions, purify body and spirit, binding ourselves in devotion and submission.

We humbly beseech the host of Perfected and Saints to bestow their merciful indulgence, allowing us to renew ourselves and fulfill our repentance. Moreover, as we adhere to the edicts, we dare not withhold our words: if there are words, we shall recite them; if there are none, we shall declare our hearts’ redirection, praying for compassion upon our supplications.

The Emperor, who bears the profound blessings of the Mysterious and aligns with the celestial mandate, shoulders the weight of the Four Great [Elements] and holds the pivot of the myriad transformations. With reverent caution, he remains vigilant day and night, yet privately fears that his governance may fall short, failing to harmonize with the divine, leaving remote frontiers and destitute lands bereft of grace and trust. Wars, floods, fires, droughts, locusts, plagues, and poisons; malevolent *qi*, fierce beasts, and violent calamities still afflict the people. His heart trembles with dread, as though treading upon ice and embers, and he yearns to pour out his sincerest devotion, supplicating the Mysterious Heavens.

We officials, endowed with accumulated goodness and favored by the true blessings, yet dwell in the filth of the mundane world, our traces mingling with the dust and defilement. We have strayed from the rites of cultivating the Five Constants and reflecting upon ourselves, and neglected the subtle harmony of preserving the Four Seasons. Our actions have bred regrets and transgressions, layering faults and errors. Unaware and unheeding, we have never performed repentance and purification. We fear that in past lives, we may have accrued faults and transgressions, or, yielding to the whims of the heart, brought about misfortune and strife. Mortal sentiments are inscrutable, and the ways of the divine are unfathomable. Our sins, like threads strung together, have amassed without cease. We have shown no reverence for the Heavenly Dao, no faith in ghosts and spirits, defied the principles of *yin* and *yang*, and disrupted the divine order. Past transgressions remain unrepented, and new wrongs are added, our karmic debt as deep as the sea, as towering as mountains. Moreover, the Five Phases alternate, and fortune and misfortune are inconstant; the Three Destinies cycle, and good and ill fortune intertwine. The stars and constellations follow their courses, with appointed times of influence; day and night, darkness and light, hold the reckoning of ascent and descent. We may have inherited enmity from past lives or this existence, or encountered karmic debts in the interplay of light and shadow. We may have incurred faults ourselves, or inherited the calamities of distant ancestors—boundless and immeasurable, beyond recall or reckoning.

We, your servants, endowed with the essence of the Great Yang, dwelling within the course of the Dao, though tainted by the dust of the world, have been permitted to partake in the mysteries of the Cavern Realms. The Golden Scriptures of the Three Caverns, the Jade Tablets of the Nine Heavens, the wondrous arts of refining the luminous embryo and the primordial origin, the disciplines of congealing spirit and embracing the One, the Dragon and Phoenix Charts that reverse aging and arrest time, the practices of audience with the origin and restoration of destiny, the attainment of sagehood and transcendence of the mundane—all these, transmitted through generations and treasured for ten thousand years, have been revealed to us through the guidance of masters, and we have been granted glimpses of their profundities. Though our ears are dull and our hearts unworthy, we have encountered the hidden marvels of the celestial canon; though ephemeral as mayflies and morning mushrooms, we have glimpsed the vast longevity of the *chun* tree.

Amidst the feast of flavors and the harmony of the purest tones, we leap and dance, forgetting all weariness. We once believed that in the Nine Purities and Three Realms, an audience with the celestial would come to pass, and that at the gates of the sun and the fords of the stars, ascension would be ours to hope for. Yet our benighted folly, ingrained through long habit, has led our discerning nature astray. We have drowned in the river of transgressions, drifted in the sea of filth, indulged in the clamor of fame and profit, lingered in the snares of splendor, forsaken the upright for the perverse, and woven webs of manifold evils.

Some have scorned the sacred scriptures, casting doubt upon the true numina. Others have stolen divine texts, transmitting them to those unworthy of the Dao. Still others, in pursuit of wealth and sensuality, have coveted fleeting glory, cloaking themselves in false purity while inwardly forsaking true rectitude. Some have exploited the Three Treasures to serve their own ends, accepting offerings from the devout yet failing to cultivate merit, embezzling from the perpetual endowments, and slandering the divine. Others, feigning mastery of celestial patterns, have presumed to foretell fortune and misfortune, inventing their own doctrines in defiance of canonical norms, their errors compounding day by day, never once awakening to their folly.

Some, inwardly neglecting the work of inner visualization while outwardly abandoning the disciplines of cultivation, have profaned the Three Palaces and clouded the Eight Luminaries. The Red Child suffers the agony of sinking and drowning; the Cinnabar Field endures the sorrow of obstruction and blockage. The Six Qi fall out of harmony, and the hundred passages grow congested. Thus do transgressions summon calamity, while virtue dispels disaster—yet we, unmoved by the Dao’s compassion, remain unconvinced of the gods’ protection.

Forsaking the root for the branch, we have never truly repented, and now, as the faintest of life’s currents slip away, how can we hope to reclaim what is lost? Some have erected palaces and dug moats, traversed official posts and chosen dwellings by divination, raising earth and timber in construction, unwittingly offending the unseen and the manifest. They have encroached upon the earthly treasuries, desecrated mounds and tombs, ravaged sacred precincts, and defiled numinous sites, carving into blessed lands, draining springs, polluting rivers, and defying the will of heaven and earth.

Some, through countless rebirths across eons, have wandered without end. Others, having once held exalted rank, ruled without Dao or mercy. Still others, as ministers or children, were neither loyal nor filial, slaughtering living beings to sustain their own lives, committing wanton or accidental killings, indulging in crimes without restraint. Some, in the name of conquest, wielded public authority for private gain, destroying jade and stone alike without pity, felling the wise and foolish together, showing no compassion.

Thus have the lowly been left without refuge, and both the living and the dead known only sorrow. These past transgressions now flow down to afflict this present life. Some bear the debts of nine generations and seven lineages, their departed kin burdened in the netherworld, their woes entangling their descendants. Others find their ancestral tombs restless, their spirits grieving and resentful, their grievances recorded in the courts of the unseen, bringing misfortune and decline.

Moreover, heaven and earth are served by gods of punishment and virtue, by officials who scrutinize all deeds, by the eyes of yin and yang that measure transgression, and by the bureaus that record faults. Good and evil are inscribed without the slightest omission. A single misstep may bar one from the realm of longevity, casting one forever into the courts of sin, never to return for ten thousand kalpas—a fate truly pitiable.

Yet in the common course of things, the deluded are many. When those who do good meet with disaster, they claim that virtue brings no benefit, unaware that the lingering misfortunes of past lives have yet to be exhausted—once they are, fortune will come. When they see the wicked at ease, they claim that evil brings no harm, unaware that the residual blessings of past lives have yet to be spent—once they are, calamity will follow. Thus emboldened, they give free rein to their desires, plunging recklessly into the long night, where every suffering awaits.

Were it not for the radiant light of the Great Dao, we would forever stray from the path of life. Yet we have heard that the mysterious scriptures, in their sagely teachings, open the gate of repentance. A decade of earnest cultivation may turn back a moment of time in the Grand Purity. Two hours of unwavering practice may earn the Upper Purity’s record of merit. Three years of devoted supplication may lead the Jade Purity to absolve all sins. The myriad heavens pity the world, and the ten thousand sages extend their grace, patiently guiding the lost across the ford of delusion, earnestly warning of the perils of drowning.

The leaping dragon and fish bear charts of green and vermilion; the tortoise and horse reveal dark tallies and azure texts. Books of repentance and reform are revealed, and the secrets of transcending the world and cultivating life are set forth. To witness these is to know eternal joy; to embody them is to become true. The bounty of goodness is magnified, and boundless blessings are bestowed. Through diligent practice and mindful devotion, safety and security are assured.

The Emperor, revering the patterns of the River and Luo, the sacred decrees of the Mysterious Origin, bows in submission and repentance, seeking grace. He offers sincere prayers across the Three Realms, repenting and giving thanks to all the heavens. Lamps scatter their radiance like distant stars beyond the celestial gates; incense mists rise in fragrant clouds, awaiting passage along the celestial roads. The precious texts of true repentance are arrayed, the jade pivots and pearl axes of the heavens aligned. With hearts laid bare, we hope to turn the gaze of the true mirror.

May the Two Modes know peace and tranquility, the Three Luminaries shine in harmony, the seasons follow their course, wind and rain come in due season. May the ancestral temples and former sages, the altars of soil and grain and the numinous spirits, receive boundless protection, enduring as long as heaven itself. May the cycles of heaven and earth proceed without the disasters of eclipses or comets, may the mountains and seas, the frontiers and borders, know no calamities of flood, drought, war, or locusts. May the three frontiers be stilled, the myriad people rejoice in well-being, traitors and treacherous ministers reform their hearts, and the barbarians of the four directions come bearing tribute across seas and mountains.

May the Emperor’s longevity be extended, his years prolonged without end. May sagely and worthy ministers assist in governance, loyalty and filial piety flourish, martial might be stilled and civil arts rise, heaven be clear and earth at peace.

We, your disciples, officials of such-and-such rank, now offer our sincerity upward, praying for resonance and communion. May heaven bestow auspicious blessings, may the gods grant their support and favor. May old enmities dissolve, debts and grievances be settled in peace, ten thousand evils vanish like clouds, a thousand disasters melt like ice.

May the unseen realms receive fortune, our distant ancestors ascend to heaven, ever dwelling within the Dao, forever meeting with blessings, never encountering demonic harm, never falling among the border tribes. May fire and water not assail us, blades and weapons not harm us. May we ever do good to save all beings, establish merit to aid the times, and see the world attain great peace, all returning to the transformation of the Dao.

May our minds and spirits grow bright and wise, our lifespans be extended. May the Five Emperors and Four Controllers, the Three Officials and Nine Treasuries, the Celestial Passes and Earthly Gates, the courts of the water and land, the nether realms, Mount Tai and Fengdu, the Nine Dark Springs and their winding depths—may all these remove our names from the registers of sin and inscribe them in the rolls of the living. May the obstacles of the Three Actions be dispelled, the roots of the Ten Evils purified. May the living and the dead receive blessings, the seen and unseen worlds know grace.

Now, therefore, we burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Great Dao, prostrating ourselves to repent all sins and transgressions. We humbly pray that the Great Lofty Jade Emperor of the Primordial Void, the Limitless Supreme Saints, the Three Honored Ones and Three Treasures, the Most Revered of Dao and Virtue, the Thirty-Nine Perfected, the Thirty-Two Emperors, the sun, moon, and stellar lodges, the True Officials of the Dipper and Terrace, the Six Jia and Five Agents, all heavens and earths, every revered sage and attained immortal—may they issue decrees to the inner and outer bureaus of the seen and unseen, the celestial overseers of transgressions, the High Perfected who govern fate, to inspect the sincerity of our emperor and ministers in amending past wrongs, and to reward the resolve of our emperor and ministers in self-renewal. May all boundless offenses be wholly dissolved. May the divine soldiers of the dharma registers, the direct talismanic spirits, and assisting deities examine, record, and memorialize our plea, swiftly bringing about resonance. At this hour of fulfillment, may we look up to receive the vast compassion of the Heavenly Worthies, matching the sincerity of our emperor and ministers in surrendering to the Dao.

We respectfully submit this petition for your hearing.

**The Ten Great Aspirations**
We, your servants, aspire:
First, that heaven and earth unite in harmony;
Second, that sun and moon shine with equal brightness;
Third, that yin and yang follow their proper order;
Fourth, that the realm enjoy peace and tranquility;
Fifth, that the imperial reign flourish in splendor;
Sixth, that ministers and counselors remain loyal and steadfast;
Seventh, that all people rejoice in happiness;
Eighth, that the nine grains yield abundant harvests;
Ninth, that the dark paths be freed from suffering;
Tenth, that the Great Dao flourish and prevail.

**Ninth Offering at the Incense Burner**
May the Incense Officials, the attending Perfected, the Direct Talismans of the Five Emperors, and the celestial overseers—we, your servants, on behalf of the emperor, having completed the offering of incense and thanksgiving—now pray that the Heavenly Emperors of the Thirty-Two Heavens of Great Lofty, the One Hundred Eighty Dao Lords of the Direct Talismans, the Thirty-Nine Perfected Envoys of Direct Service, the One Hundred Twenty Bureaus of the Three Primes, along with the officers of this year, month, day, and hour, the Seven Luminaries and Five Agents, the local earth gods of the four directions and center, and all spiritual authorities within and beyond the Three Realms, together record the vows of self-renewal made by our emperor and ministers, and solemnly accept the sincerity of our prayers. May auspicious qi and radiant light illumine the altar grounds of the divine continent, may the Three Primes and Five Emperors manifest portents within the tranquil halls of the palace, may dragon-horses bear the charts and tortoises and fish display blessings, may the vermilion graphs reappear and the green characters renew.

May the emperor’s virtue and power shine forth, his mysterious merit extend far and wide, his reign endure long, and the land know great peace. May we, your servants, and all disciples have our sins eradicated, all virtues amassed, the whole world receive blessings, the seen and unseen realms be graced with favor. May the nine generations of ancestors and the three masters attain the fruit of Perfection. May the jade lads and jade maidens who attend incense and lamps, the officials of the Three Realms, and all responsive spirits memorialize our petition and present it directly before the Jade Emperor of the Great Lofty Primordial Void.

**Next: The Immortal’s Procession**
**Next: Circumambulating the Central Lamp**
Exiting the Earth Gate, encircling the Three Lights, circumambulating heaven once, returning to the Earth Gate.

Next, upon exiting the gate, the incantation is recited:
*"May the Perfected descend from the six directions, may the Nine Heavens bestow their protection, may benevolent spirits draw near, and merits be accomplished."*
When finished, strike the teeth and swallow the saliva thirty-two times each.
Next, return to the ritual chamber.

Thus concludes *The Rite of Reverent Thanksgiving to the Three Primordials of the Great Cavern Spirit and the Supreme Mystery of the River Chart*.
