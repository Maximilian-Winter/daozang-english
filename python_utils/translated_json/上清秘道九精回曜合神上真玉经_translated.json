  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Esoteric Dao Scripture of the Nine Essences’ Revolving Radiance Uniting with the Divine Perfected Jade Canon**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Esoteric Dao Scripture of the Nine Essences’ Revolving Radiance Uniting with the Divine Perfected Jade Canon*. Author unknown, approximately dated to the Eastern Jin or Liu-Song dynasties. Allegedly transmitted by Lord Yang of the Bureau of Destiny (Yang Xi). It expounds the essential methods of meditative visualization and spirit-travel through the Northern Dipper. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n---\n\nThe Supreme Clarity Palace’s Divine Instructor of the Bureau of Destiny and Numinous Upper Minister, having bestowed the tally of the Bureau of Destiny, commands Yang Jun, the Golden Watchtower’s Upper Guardian of the Celestial Bureau of Destiny, to instruct Li Jun, the Master of Eastern Florescence and Keeper of Pristine Transcendence, in *The Supreme Clarity Esoteric Dao Scripture of the Nine Essences’ Revolving Radiance Uniting with the Divine Perfected Jade Canon*.\n\nIn the year *yanmao*, Lady Jiang of the Golden Florescence, the Upper Perfected of the Northern Dipper’s Capital Bureau, descended to transmit the numinous teachings to Nanlong, whereupon she addressed the Upper Guardian, saying: *The Supreme Clarity Esoteric Dao Scripture of the Nine Essences’ Revolving Radiance Uniting with the Divine Perfected Jade Canon* is the loftiest practice of the Bureau of Destiny. It is not taught to the lesser perfected of the world; only those of jade tablets and golden names, of vast talent and immense virtue, who are destined to serve as the Bureau of Destiny, may hear of it. After nine years of practice, one governs the Golden Chamber of the Celestial Palace and commands the host of perfected spirits. With further cultivation, one returns to the Jade Perfected; over time, one’s eyes emit purple lightning, one’s head sways with ninefold radiance, and one’s breath and sighs summon wind and clouds, merging with Heaven in transformation. To divulge its secrets invites the Water Bureau’s brush of judgment; to reveal its text causes the Nine Essences to depart. The recipient must kneel and pledge their oath in Eastern Florescence. Until the work is accomplished, it must not be taught to later disciples. The Jade Prohibitions are most solemn—revere them!\n\n**The Canon states:**\nOn the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival, purify yourself with fasting, ablutions, and bathing. On the evening of the festival, don fresh robes and cap, and burn precious incense in the courtyard. \"Precious incense\" refers to a blend of amber, benzoin, sandalwood, and other fragrant woods. Concentrate your thoughts in serene contemplation, focusing intently on shooting stars or unusual colored lights and qi in the sky. If you perceive an anomaly to your left, use your intention to summon and draw it into your left pupil; do the same for the right. If you obtain only one, wait until the following year to complete it. If both are obtained, the Dao is accomplished.\n\nOnce both pupils have received the summoned essence, hasten indoors, sit facing south, clasp your hands, and concentrate. Visualize your two pupils as the sun and moon, swiftly ascending into the Hall of Light (located one *cun* inward between the eyebrows). Let the radiance of the sun and moon intertwine within the Hall of Light for 365 degrees. You should feel a stirring warmth coalescing—envision a flowing essence like molten fat descending into the Hall of Light, its five colors vibrant and swirling, gently warming. Trust that this flowing essence exists, then return it to the sun and moon within your pupils. Burn the precious incense and recite the incantation:\n\n*\"Summon the light, absorb the shadow,\nWondrously attaining the divine.\nThe numinous youth unfurls the chart,\nThe Supreme Perfected, the One True.\nTransforming and giving birth to the Most High,\nThe Venerable Divine of the Great One,\nThe stellar net treads the Dipper’s handle,\nThe Nine Essences revolve in radiance.\nRefine and unite with my qi,\nA hundred blessings renewed.\nTally and tablet command destiny,\nAscend to the Imperial Throne.\"*\n\nAfter reciting, retire to rest. On the following evening, sleep without further visualization. Repeat this for nine nights. On the ninth night at midnight, burn the precious incense and visualize the Hall of Light. Without conscious effort, you will naturally perceive the five-colored flowing essence nurturing a jade infant, small as a lotus seed’s heart, named the Supreme True Mystery. Upon clearly seeing it, click your teeth nine times, cover your ears with your hands, and intone:\n\n*\"At the Aurora Pivot, the Rosy Terrace,\nThe Great One wanders the chamber.\nMy Mystery, my Mystery,\nEmerge and sit in the Hall of Light.\nHeaven and Earth begin in truth,\nFive-colored jade radiance,\nMoving and resting in accord,\nUnfolds with me.\nCommanding the lesser perfected,\nThe Bureau of Destiny’s golden couch,\nEndless years,\nVirtue flows fragrantly.\"*\n\nAfter the incantation, press your hands upon your knees and visualize the nine stars of the Northern Dipper blazing in the heavens. Next, envision purple qi rising from the Hall of Light like a rainbow, connecting to the Dipper’s handle. Then, see your two pupils: the left named *Supreme Perfected*, the right *One Perfected*. They ascend into the Hall of Light, assisting the Great One’s jade infant to rise upon the purple qi. Next, visualize your consort and the two pupils guiding the Great One first to the Jade Perfected’s abode in the Heavenly Court. You bow to the Great One, beseeching longevity and the command of the host of perfected spirits. You should feel a slight itch in the Heavenly Court, as if something touches your brow.\n\nNext, guide the Great One to ascend via the purple qi into the handle of the Dipper. An Imperial Lord welcomes and receives the Great One, records your name in the register of the living, and removes it from the ledger of the dead. The Great One, you, and the two pupils traverse the nine stars twice. The Great One sits upon the Imperial Star, while the two pupils and you stand in attendance. Suddenly, you ride the Dipper’s nine stars, hurtling through the void, enveloped in crimson light and purple mist, which merge with your body. The stars alight upon specific loci:\n\n- Left breast: *Ascend the Aurora Pivot*\n- Right breast: *Rise to the Rosy Terrace*\n- Right arm: *Perfected One’s Abode*\n- Left arm: *Purple Source Chamber*\n- Above the chin: *Suspended Rainbow Steps*\n- Between the philtrum and the *shanyuan* (the depression below the nose): *Valley’s Tranquil Descent*\n- Crown of the head: *Audience with the Imperial Lord*\n- Left eye: *Azure Field* (abode of the Jade Perfected’s star)\n- Right eye: *Golden Grotto* (abode of the Imperial Lord’s star)\n\nThe Dipper’s crimson light interpenetrates and entwines, while purple qi and rosy mist flow through and fuse with the hundred meridians. The nine stars stand resplendent in their positions.\n\nNext, visualize the Great One, flanked by the two pupils, riding the Dipper’s crimson light, roaming and reposing among the Nine Palaces, then returning to the Jade Perfected’s abode. Determine the position of the Ten Celestial Stems to guide the Great One to their resting chamber:\n\n- *Jia* resides in *Ascend the Aurora Pivot*\n- *Yi* in *Rise to the Rosy Terrace*\n- *Bing* in *Perfected One’s Abode*\n- *Ding* in *Purple Source Chamber*\n- *Wu* in *Suspended Rainbow Steps*\n- *Ji* in *Valley’s Tranquil Descent*\n- *Geng* in *Audience with the Imperial Lord*\n- *Xin* in the *Jade Perfected’s Abode*\n- *Ren* in *Azure Field*\n- *Gui* in *Golden Grotto*\n\nHaving completed the above, rub the Crimson Abode, pull the ears and lick the lips, then press the heart and intone the prayer:\n\n\"Supreme One, Most Perfect,\nUphold and join the twin pupils.\nNine-Star Thearchs,\nHearken to the command of the Jade Palace.\nRevolve and harmonize this single form,\nEqual to Heaven and Earth.\nNow summon this humble servant\nTo mount the flying dragon,\nClad in vermilion raiment of the sun-bird,\nStriking drums and sounding bells.\nMerge and preserve the formless,\nAbide eternally without end.\"\n\nOnce the incantation is finished, forget the form.\n\nPerform this once every nine days, and after nine years, the Way shall reach great accomplishment. The Azure Lord of the Upper Palace will bestow the tally of life-mandate, inscribing it among the heavens. After a hundred days of practice, five-colored visions may appear in dreams—if resembling pheasants, they signify the descent of the Supreme One of the Supreme One’s Palace and the Supreme Thearch into the adept’s body.\n\nAbstain from fish, impatience, dried meats, wild rice, and other grains. Daily sustenance is unrestricted, but to sever oneself from the single source is to violate the Jade Prohibitions. If one practices grain avoidance while cultivating this, the merit will be tenfold.\n\nThe Grain-Avoidance Formula of the Azure Lad is likewise suited to this Way:\nTake one *shi* of fox nut seeds, remove their shells, and steep them in one *shi* of clear spring water boiled with five *liang* of *qingmuxiang* root. During the three *fu* days, add three *jin* of *fuling* powder and ten *liang* of cinnabar powder, mixing thoroughly. Steam in a wooden steamer for one *fu* period, then dry in the sun. Store in a green silk pouch.\n\nWhen consuming, soak in honeyed water and steam like a beverage. Take three times daily to banish hunger. Though this formula requires no specific practice to employ, consuming it can still reverse aging and confer long life.\n\nHere ends *The Jade Scripture of the Upper Clarity: Nine Essences Revolving Radiance, Uniting the Spirit with the Supreme Perfected*.",
