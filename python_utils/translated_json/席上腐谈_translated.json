  "full_translation": "The *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division*\n*Idle Chatter at the Banquet Table*\n*Daoist Category*\n*Abstract*\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: *Idle Chatter at the Banquet Table* in two fascicles was composed by Yu Yan of the Song dynasty. This work consists of his miscellaneous notes and discourses. Only the first several dozen entries in the upper fascicle pertain to the examination of names and objects, yet their arguments are often superficial and baseless. For instance, he claims that the common term for women, \"mama,\" derives from the *Kun* hexagram’s \"profit in the steadfastness of the mare\"; that the name *qisou* (vagabond) originates from *qusou* (canal-dredging); and that the term *fangli* (bedsteps) is taken from *ta yi deng chuang* (\"treading to ascend the bed\"). Many such assertions are forced and far-fetched, lacking credible evidence. The remainder of the text refutes the arts of Rong Cheng, discusses the theories of fetal gestation in *Chu’s Posthumous Writings*, and in the lower fascicle, thoroughly expounds upon alchemical scriptures, concluding with a warning against the pursuit of transmuting base metals into gold. Though these topics do not transcend Daoist concerns, within that tradition, his arguments alone approach correctness. This is likely because he first mastered Confucian principles and thus was not misled by the deceptive doctrines of fangshi.\n\nZhu Cunli’s *Miscellaneous Writings from the Loft Abode* contains two entries referencing this work. One states: \"Master Shijian’s commentary on the *Book of Changes* includes, apart from his *Yi* annotations, *Idle Chatter at the Banquet Table* and *Explanations of the Changes*, both of which were printed. This compilation is merely a handwritten copy preserved in his family. When Magistrate Lin Gong of Huangyan governed the prefecture, he took it away, and no duplicate remained in the family. To this day, Wu has lost its transmission.\" In the autumn of the *gengxu* year, while lodging at an inn, I conversed with Dong Ziwen of Haichang. He mentioned that his family once possessed this book but had since lost it. We then visited Zhu Qiuguan’s residence to borrow it, and fortunately, this work has thus returned to Wu.\n\nAnother entry in Zhu’s work cites *The Collected Works of the Yu Family*, stating: \"*Idle Chatter* originally comprised four fascicles, but now only two remain. The present edition is titled *Auxiliary Discourses*, though the pronunciation is similar, the characters differ, and the corruption must have a basis.\" Upon examining the *Yongle Encyclopedia*, we find that the title is sometimes rendered as *Auxiliary* and other times as *Idle*, with variations in the text. Given Zhu Cunli’s records, we know that these were originally alternate versions of the same work, not two distinct books.\n\nRespectfully submitted after collation in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.\n\n**Chief Compilers:**\n**Minister** Ji Yun\n**Minister** Lu Xixiong\n**Minister** Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\n**Minister** Lu Feichi\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Four Treasuries*\n*Idle Chatter at the Banquet, Volume One*\nBy Yu Yan of the Yuan Dynasty\n\nShao Kangjie said: Animals derive life from the head, while plants derive life from the root. From the head comes life, so life resides in the head; from the root comes life, so life resides in the root. He also said: Flying creatures perch on trees and feed on wood, thus the feathers of eagles and hawks resemble wood. Running creatures dwell in grass and feed on grass, thus the fur of tigers and leopards resembles grass. Flying creatures delight in wind and excel in ascending; running creatures favor earth and thrive in descending. Those in water do not close their eyes, while those in wind and on land do. The upper eyelids of running creatures meet the lower, while the lower eyelids of flying creatures meet the upper—this is their natural disposition. Water creatures die when removed from water, and wind creatures die when submerged in water. Yet there are creatures that move between both: turtles, crabs, geese, and ducks.\n\nOxen, being docile creatures, move with the wind; horses, being vigorous creatures, advance against the wind. The *Book of Fei’s Admonitions* states: \"Horses and oxen follow the wind.\" The *Zuo Tradition* of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: \"The wind of horses and oxen does not reach each other,\" for when horses and oxen gallop, each follows its own wind. In the northern lands, a herd of horses is led by a single stallion with over ten mares, and the mares follow the stallion without joining other herds. The *Book of Changes*, in the hexagram *Kun*, says: \"It is advantageous for the mare’s virtue to be steadfast,\" referring precisely to this. Today, people call women \"mama,\" which carries the same meaning. Ants also do not join other colonies, hence they are called \"horse ants\" or \"dark colts.\"\n\n*The Trivial Record* states: Fish swim upstream, and birds stand facing the wind, aligning their scales and feathers with the flow. When a gentle breeze arises from an unknown direction, observe the birds’ orientation to determine it.\n\nLice are yin creatures with six legs, corresponding to the number of northern *Kan* water. They invariably move northward—this has been verified. I once saw a book stating this, but I have forgotten its title.\n\nThe *Rites of Zhou* records that the *Mountain Warden* fells yang wood in midwinter and yin wood in midsummer. Trees on the southern side of a mountain are yang, while those on the northern side are yin. Midwinter marks the southern solstice, and midsummer the northern solstice, both being where sunlight reaches. Thus, trees facing south will, when placed in water, float with their surfaces upward.\n\nThe liver corresponds to wood and should float, yet it sinks; the lungs correspond to metal and should sink, yet they float. Why? The liver is solid, while the lungs are hollow. Stones sink in water, yet the Southern Sea has mountains of floating stone; wood floats in water, yet the Southern Sea has sinking ebony—solidity and hollowness thus oppose each other.\n\nThe *Erya* states that for birds whose sexes cannot be distinguished, those with the left wing covering the right are male, and those with the right wing covering the left are female. Zhang Hua’s *Broad Survey of Things* also records this. Tao Hongjing said: Distinguishing the sexes of birds is difficult. The old method holds that if the left wing covers the right, it is male. Another way is to burn the feathers and place them in water—those that sink are male, and those that float are female.\n\nWei Boyang’s *Triplex Unity* states: \"At birth, males lie prone, and females lie supine.\" This is not merely evident at birth but also in death, as they imitate their original form at conception. The *Posthumous Writings of Master Chu* says: Yang qi gathers in the face, so men’s faces are heavier, and those who drown must lie prone. Yin qi gathers in the back, so women’s backs are heavier, and those who drown must lie supine. The same applies to drowned beasts.\n\nThe *Plain Questions* states: \"Ascent and descent, exit and entry—there is no vessel without them.\" The commentary explains: Walls, windows, doors, and apertures all face two directions, receiving and channeling qi that strikes against people—this is the qi of exit and entry.\n\nWhen objects are thrown into a well or pit, they descend slowly and flutteringly, hindered by ascending qi.\n\nA hollow tube, when filled with water and sealed at the top, will not leak—this is because without ascending qi, descending cannot occur. An empty bottle with a small mouth, when suddenly inverted to pour, will not admit water—this is because qi cannot exit and thus cannot enter. Hence it is said: \"Ascent and descent, exit and entry—there is no vessel without them.\"\n\nIn my youth, a Daoist taught me: burn a piece of paper, quickly insert it into an empty bottle, and immediately invert the bottle into a silver basin of water—the water will surge into the bottle, and the silver basin will ring with a clear sound. This is the effect of the fire’s qi. Following the same method, place the bottle on a strongman’s abdomen, and it will not fall, just as a copper water clock: when its aperture is sealed, water does not drip, but when released, it drips. In the practice of self-cultivation, when the spirit is stored in the *niwan* (upper cinnabar field), the qi of the *dantian* (lower cinnabar field) ascends—where the spirit resides, qi follows and abides.\n\nIn the arts of the bedchamber, pressing the *weilu* (tailbone), inhaling qi, and swallowing saliva may yield some benefits, yet the essence remains unspent. To discern the hours and the alternation of yin and yang, observe the breath through the nostrils: during yang hours, the breath flows through the left nostril; during yin hours, through the right. At the cusp of *hai* and *zi* (11 p.m.–1 a.m.), both nostrils are unobstructed—what the alchemists call \"the jade cavern opening in duality.\"\n\nDo not eat the flesh of a horse that has died in pain, for it is lethal, especially the liver. Medical texts state: the horse is a fire creature, possessing a liver but no gallbladder; its wood organ is insufficient, so consuming its liver causes death. The *Records of the Grand Historian* recounts that when Duke Mu of Qin lost his horse, over three hundred villagers found and ate it. The officials sought to punish them, but the Duke said: \"A gentleman does not harm people for the sake of livestock. I have heard that eating horse meat without drinking wine harms the body.\" Thus, he gave them wine and pardoned them. Recently, I witnessed a villager, Ge Hengzhai, who suffered swelling after eating horse meat; he recovered by drinking boiled wine with salt. Thus, wine can indeed neutralize horse toxin.\n\nThe *Zuozhuan* states: \"When the state’s dogs go mad, none fail to bite.\" Du Yu’s commentary explains: *zhi* (瘈) means \"rabid.\" The *Book of Song* records that Zhang Shou, bitten by a rabid dog, ate minced frog and recovered. (The character *zhi* [猘] is pronounced *jū lì* or *zhēng liè*; it refers to a rabid dog.) Some say apricot kernels can also treat dog bites.\n\nThe *Nei Ze* states: \"Remove the intestines from a wolf, the emaciated parts from a leopard cat, the rump from a *zhi* (獦), the head from a fox, the brain from a piglet, the *yi* (乙) from a fish, and the *chou* (丑) from a soft-shelled turtle.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains that these parts are harmful to humans. The *Zuozhuan* recounts that the Marquis of Jin dreamed of the Viscount of Chu crouching over him and licking his brain. Zi Fan said: \"This is auspicious; I will soften him.\" Du Yu’s commentary notes: the brain is used to soften things—today, pig brain is used to soften leather. Once, a man ate an entire pig brain; within a year, his limbs weakened, and he could not leave his bed, becoming paralyzed. Thus, the *Nei Ze* and the *Zuozhuan* are not false.\n\nAs for the *yi* (乙) in fish, Zheng Xuan’s commentary states: the harmful part of a fish’s body is the *donghai rong* fish, which has a bone called *yi* near its eye, shaped like the character *yi* (乙). Eating it causes choking, and it cannot be removed. The *Erya* states: the fish’s \"pillow\" is called *ding*, its intestines are called *yi*, and its tail is called *bing*. I suggest that Zheng Xuan refers to the *yi* as a fish bone, while the *Erya* refers to it as the fish’s intestines—both liken it to the shape of the character *yi* (乙). However, if we infer from \"removing the intestines from a wolf,\" then the *yi* in fish is not the intestines but a bone.\n\nA Tang poem says: \"The cuckoo calls its name, / The Ba River flows like the character *ba*.\" This is because the river’s bends resemble the character *ba* (巴). Others say the frog’s shape resembles an earthworm, or that the fish bone resembles the character *yi*—all share this idea of resemblance. Lu Ji noted that ducks can speak and call their own names, but others say that animals like magpies, cats, and dogs can also call their names—why single out ducks and cuckoos?\n\nPhosphorescent fire is commonly called *guihuo* (ghost fire). The blood of soldiers or of cattle and horses is called *lin* (phosphorus). Fireflies are also called *lin*—their light resembles fire but is not fire. My family once had an old servant who did not believe in ghosts. When accompanying my late father to Wuxi’s Qingyang Port to collect rent, he saw countless *guihuo* flickering and approaching at night. The others fled in terror, but the old servant, drunk, rushed forward and struck at them—only to find they were wet leaves of *shi nan* (photinia).\n\nOnce, sitting by the water pavilion at night after rain, I saw a light in the grass. Upon picking it up, it was a wet shrimp shell. Ye Yuyan said that while in the Wutai Mountains, he saw wet pine bark glowing at night. He called his attendants to gather a cloth sack full, intending to send it to relatives and friends in the south as a rarity. After a few days, however, it had dried and no longer glowed—he laughed and discarded it.\n\nThe ancient *xiang* (offering) ritual is like today’s front banquet; the ancient *yan* (feast) ritual is like today’s rear banquet. Du Yu said: *Xiang* involves formalities—tables are set, but one does not lean on them; cups are filled, but not drunk; dishes are dried, but not eaten. *Yan*, however, involves sharing food from the same platter.\n\nThe ancient *suji* (plain accumulation) is today’s fine pleated cloth robe. Xunzi said: \"The *pi bian* (skin cap) and *suji*.\" Yang Liang’s commentary explains: *Suji* is a lower garment made of fifteen-*sheng* cloth, gathered at the waist—hence the name *suji*. One *sheng* equals eighty threads; fifteen *sheng* equals 1,200 threads—this is fine cloth.\n\nThe *Yue Ling* states: \"A scholar does not wear *zhi*.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains: *Zhi* refers to woven silk. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhi* is pronounced *zhi*, but today it is mispronounced as *zhu*, leading to silk being called *zhu si* (注丝). The sounds *zhi* and *zhu* are close. Some write it as *zhu si* (苎丝), which is a further corruption.\n\nIn the north, fine, soft wool is called *zirong* (子氄). *Zi* refers to the fineness of the wool; *rong* describes its softness. The *Book of Yao* states: \"Birds and beasts grow soft fur.\" Today, it is corrupted to *zirong* (紫茸).\n\nThe *Bin Feng* poem says: \"Without clothes, without *he*—how to pass the year?\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary states: *He* is coarse woolen cloth. The noble lack clothes; the poor lack *he*—how can they pass the year? I humbly note: Mencius said, \"To stab a ruler of ten thousand chariots is like stabbing a *he* man.\" Here, *he* contrasts with a ruler of ten thousand chariots, emphasizing the disparity between noble and base. *He* is a coarse, short garment made of woven *xi* (hemp), neither yellow nor black—it is the attire of the poor, not woolen cloth. The character *he* (褐) is written with the \"clothing\" radical, while *he* (毼) is written with the \"fur\" radical. Zheng Xuan mistakenly took *he* (褐) for *he* (毼), claiming *he* is woolen cloth. Woolen cloth, like today’s *xie he* (斜毼), is more expensive than ramie—how could it be the clothing of the poor?\n\nToday’s *mao* (氁) robe is the ancient *cui* (毳) garment. *Cui* describes the softness of fur, as in the poem: \"The fox fur is *fang rong* (防茸).\" The common term *mao* (氁) is a corruption of *cui* (毳), which itself was miswritten as *mao* (毛).\n\nThe alternate name for felt is *mao xi* (毛席); the alternate name for a blanket is *mao ru* (毛褥). Just as a bamboo hat is called a *zhu jin* (竹巾), the *Xiyu Zhuan* in the *Book of Later Han* calls felt *mao xi*. Zhang Heng’s *Four Sorrows* poem says: \"The beauty gifts me a *zhan qu* (毡氍).\" The *Fangyan* states: woven wool blankets are called *qu zhi* (氍氈); finer ones are called *ta zhi* (毾㲪). *Ta zhi* are placed before large beds or on small *ta* beds, used to step on when climbing into bed.\n\nThe lacquerware known as *xipi* (犀皮) originates from the kingdom of *Xipi* (西毗), its name a corruption of the original. *Guijiang* (桂浆) comes from the kingdom of *Jijiang* (罽浆), similarly corrupted into its present form. Extending this logic, *quzhan* (氍氈) may well derive from *Quye* (渠拽), a kingdom whose name shares the same sound but differs in written form. *Xipi* (西毗) is likely a corruption of *Zhipi* (织皮), the name of another kingdom. The *Book of Yu Gong* records that *Quye* and *Zhipi* produced woven skins.\n\nThe *futou* (幞头) originated in the reign of Emperor Wu of Zhou, formed by wrapping the head with a *fujin* (幅巾), hence its name. The character *fu* (幞) is pronounced like *fu* (伏) and shares the same sound as the *fu* in *fubei* (幞被). Today, it is corrupted into *pu* (仆). Han Tuizhi’s *Yuanhe Shengde* poem states: \"With a red kerchief covering the head, bound with red silk\"—this is the modern *moe* (抹额). The *pashou* (帕首) and *futou* were originally the same object, now divided into two. Tang-dynasty *futou* were initially made of black gauze, but due to their softness, paulownia wood was later folded into a mountain shape and placed inside to stiffen them, called *jurongtou* (举容头). It was said to have originated with Yu Chao’en. The practice continued through the Five Dynasties, and in the Song, the material was changed to rattan, then to gauze, and later to lacquered gauze. Emperor Wu’s original design resembled today’s *jiejin* (结巾), with two corners left hanging, lacking any ties. Tang people added four bands, letting two corners hang in front and two behind. The Song further modified it by stiffening the two corners with iron wire to prevent whispering during court audiences.\n\nModern *liangzichou* (凉缁巾) use bamboo strips as a frame, shaped like a *liangmao* (凉帽) and covered with black gauze, making them easy to remove and wear—a most convenient summer accessory. This demonstrates how the design of the *futou* has evolved over time, its forms differing so greatly between ancient and modern eras.\n\nI once observed official courtesans performing the *Zhezhi* dance, wearing a red object on their heads, long in body and pointed at the top, resembling the shape of a boot. I suspect this was the precursor to today’s *gugu* (罟姑). The *Suilu* records that the *Zhezhi* dance originated from the name of the Tuoba clan of Later Wei, with *tuo* (拓) corrupted into *zhe* (柘) and *ba* (拔) into *zhi* (枝).\n\nThe *pipa* (琵琶) is also called *pippo* (鼙婆). In Tang poetry, the character *pa* (琶) was written with the *ru* (入) phonetic. The *Bi* (弼) in Wang Zhaojun’s *pipa* (琵琶) was originally *huai* (懐), later corrupted into *sì* (肆). The Hu people later modified its shape to be smaller. Wang Zhaojun laughed, saying, \"It hardly resembles the original.\" Today, it is further corrupted into *húbōsì* (胡拨四).\n\nThe characters *bili* (觱栗) appear in the *Bin Feng* of the *Book of Songs*, where *bi* (觱) is written as *bi* (毕). Zhu Xi remarked that the *bili* was originally called *beili* (悲栗), as its sound was deep and resonant. The pronunciations *bei* (悲), *bi* (觱), and *bi* (毕) are all related.\n\nZhang Heng’s *Four Sorrows* poem states: \"The beauty gifts me a *jin cuo dao* (金错刀).\" The ancient *cuo* (错) is the modern *cuo* (磋), pronounced *qiān gè* (千个反). Northerners pronounce *cuo* in the departing tone, while southerners use the entering tone, though they are essentially the same.\n\nThe character *mei* (眉) in *Xunzi* is written as *mi* (麋). Yang Liang’s annotation notes that *mi* (麋) is the same as *mei* (眉). The character *zi* (髭) in *zixu* (髭须) is also written as *zi* (兹). *Xunzi* states: \"The dragon’s *zi* (兹).\" Liu Xiang’s *Lienü Zhuan* writes it as *long shu* (龙疏). Yang Liang explains that *zi* (兹) is the same as *zi* (髭), and another variant is *xu longzi* (须龙兹), meaning *longshu* (龙疏), as *shu* (疏) and *xu* (须) are phonetically similar.\n\nThe *Jiao Te Sheng* states: \"The comfort of *guan* mats and *dian* mats, and the esteem for *puyue* (蒲越) and *gaojie* (稿秸).\" The *Zuozhuan* records: \"The grand carriage’s *yue* mat.\" The *yue* in *yuehu* (越户) is pronounced *kuo* (括反). Today, the *puhe* (蒲合) sold in Hangzhou markets is the *yue* (越), with *yue* corrupted into *he* (合) in sound.\n\nThe *fushuiche* (柫水车) is the *fu* (柫). Yang Liang mistook it for a *jiapa* (连枷), but the *jiapa* is a tool for threshing rice, not the *fu*. Ancient water conduits were made of wood for channeling water—this is the modern *chengluo* (承落).\n\nCui Bao’s *Gu Jin Zhu* records: \"The imperial moat of Chang’an is called *Yang Gou* (杨沟), as tall poplars were planted along it.\" It also states: \"*Yang Gou* (羊沟) refers to moats dug to prevent sheep from butting against walls.\" I believe that today, water channels hidden within courtyards are called *yin gou* (阴沟), while those visible outside are called *yang gou* (阳沟).\n\nThe people of Wu refer to stacked firewood as *chai ji* (柴积), pronounced *jì* (祭). This is the *wei ji* (委积) of the *Zhou Li*’s *Tianguan*, where Zheng Xuan explains that *wei ji* refers to stored grain, firewood, and fodder. The *Shiwen* glosses *ji* (积) as *zǐ cì* (子赐反). Today, it is corrupted into *jì* (祭), and *wei ji* (委积), meaning \"to store,\" is now written as *jì liú* (祭留).\n\nThe *Book of Rites* states: \"Heaven has no second sun,\" and Mencius echoes: \"Heaven has no two suns.\" Yet the *Zuozhuan* records: \"Heaven has ten suns,\" referring to the ten heavenly stems from *jia* (甲) to *gui* (癸). The *Liezi* claims that in Yao’s time, ten suns appeared simultaneously, and the *Zhuangzi* and *Huainanzi* further embellish this tale. Though these are allegories, are they not excessive? Some argue that there are historical records of two suns appearing and battling. I disagree. In the sixth year of Qianfu during the Tang, in the eleventh month, two suns appeared and fought. This must have been an illusion caused by the sun’s reflection in water at sunrise, its ripples creating the appearance of two suns clashing. How could there truly be two suns in the sky?\n\nThe twenty-eight constellations include *Fang* (房), where the sun is likened to a rabbit, and *Bi* (毕), where the moon is likened to a crow. The *Dan Shu* states: \"The sun crow, the moon rabbit,\" referring to the conjunction of the sun and moon.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* takes *li* (离) as the sun, yang containing yin, and *kan* (坎) as the moon, yin containing yang. Zhang Zai remarked that the essence of yin and yang mutually resides within each other—this is correct. The rabbit has four feet, which Han-dynasty scholar Zhang Heng considered yin, its number even. The crow has three claws, yang’s number being odd. I believe the rabbit belongs to the sun, and the so-called \"moon rabbit\" is merely the sunlight within the moon.\n\nAlchemists use this as a metaphor for the spirit entering qi, like sunlight illuminating the moon, hence placing the rabbit in the moon as a symbolic model. Their texts state: \"The moon is the medicine.\" The common belief that there is a rabbit in the moon pounding medicine is entirely baseless. When observing a person walking on a mountain from several hundred paces away, they appear as small as an ant. Beyond tens of li, even the mountain vanishes—how could one see a rabbit in the moon, which is tens of thousands of li away? If there truly were something visible in the moon, how large or small would this rabbit be?\n\nZhang Heng claimed that Yi requested the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West, and his wife, Heng’e, stole it and fled to the moon, becoming a toad. Liu Zhao greatly praised Zhang Heng’s astronomical insights, yet his account of Heng’e and the toad seems to perpetuate earlier errors.\n\nThe *Jin Shu* records that Xi and He observed the sun, Chang Yi observed the moon, and Qu Che observed the stars. The character *yi* (仪) is pronounced *é* (蛾). Today, the moon’s woman is called Chang’e, and the sun and moon are further named Xi and E—this is a grave error. The notion of a Chang’e in the moon is false, and the idea of a \"Palace of Broad Cold and Pure Emptiness\" is even more absurd. The tales of toads, rabbits, and osmanthus trees in the moon are all fabrications, yet such myths already existed in the Warring States period. The *Chu Ci* states: \"What virtue does the moon possess, that it dies and is reborn? What benefit does it seek, that the rabbit resides within?\" Zhu Xi notes that *tu* (菟) is the same as *tu* (兔). The common belief in osmanthus trees and toad light has persisted for so long.\n\nSome suggest that the sun and moon in the sky are like two mirrors reflecting each other, with the earth between them. Thus, the dark patches on the moon are merely the shadows of the earth in the mirror, vaguely resembling shapes but not actual objects. This explanation is reasonable and sufficient to dispel millennia of confusion.\n\nThe Song Emperor Cangwu ordered Yang Yufu to watch for the Weaving Maiden crossing the River of Heaven, declaring, \"If you see her, report to me; if not, I will kill you.\" He was thus slain by Yufu. Yet the Weaving Maiden is but a fixed star, unchanged for ten thousand ages—how could she ever cross the river? The alchemists speak of guiding the qi along the spine to ascend to Kunlun’s summit, calling this \"the Yellow River flowing backward.\" They also take the *Ren* and *Du* meridians as the Celestial River, using the Cowherd and Weaving Maiden as metaphors for the union of yin and yang within the body.\n\nDu Zimei’s poem on the Celestial River contains the lines: *\"Year after year, the Cowherd and Maiden cross— / When have wind and waves ever risen?\"* Zhang Wenqian’s *Seventh Night Song* depicts the Weaving Maiden’s single night of joy, claiming it surpasses Chang’e, who nightly sleeps alone in the Moon Palace. For the most part, the verses of poets and scholars mocking the wind or chanting the moon are but fleeting jests—how could they be measured by reason?\n\nThe Weaving Maiden is but the name of a star—where are her loom and shuttle? When Empress Wu received a golden shuttle in her courtyard on the Seventh Night, it was merely the work of palace women. It was no different from Emperor Zhenzong’s \"heavenly scriptures\"—did Heaven truly have such writings? They were but the fabrications of Wang Qinruo and his ilk.\n\nThe Yellow River emerges from the earth atop Kunlun Mountain, flowing eastward to Qishi. Thus, when Yu of Xia dredged the river, he guided it to Qishi—yet the Celestial River remains in the heavens, revolving with the sky’s motion, its position shifting day and night. How could it connect with the Yellow River? Yet Li Taibai wrote, *\"The waters of the Yellow River come from heaven above,\"* for he took Kunlun Mountain to be part of the heavens. The Celestial River and the sea differ as vastly as sky and earth—how could one reach it by raft? Zhang Hua’s *Records of Broad Learning* tells of riding a raft into the Celestial River to meet the Cowherd and Weaving Maiden stars—clearly a fabrication.\n\n*Liezi* states that Nüwa smelted five-colored stones to mend the heavens, but Confucians mock this as absurd. The sky has never been broken—even if it were, how could smelting stones repair it? Moreover, the celestial body revolves ceaselessly; where could one even begin? Their mockery is justified. Yet they fail to realize that the five-colored stones symbolize the *qi* of the five viscera. The art of nourishing life teaches that by concentrating the spirit and turning the gaze inward, the *qi* of the five viscera gathers in the *dantian*, steaming upward from the *dantian* to the brain. The brain is Kunlun, the uppermost part, symbolizing heaven. \"Mending the heavens\" is what the *Huangting Jing* calls \"filling the brain\"—or, as the saying goes, *\"If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.\"* At Caishi in Jiangdong, the common folk spread the tale that Nüwa mended the heavens and smelted five-colored stones there, hence the name \"Caishi\" (\"Picking Stones\"). The error compounds itself.\n\nNüwa succeeded Fuxi as ruler of the world. Later generations regarded Nüwa as an ancient sage-woman, claiming she was Fuxi’s younger sister and Zhuanxu’s mother—how could this be true? Moreover, her clan name, Nüwa, resembles the state name Nüzhen (Jurchen). Consider the *Zuozhuan*, which speaks of Nü Ai; *Zhuangzi*, of Yu Nü; and *Mencius*, of Feng Fu—were they all truly women? The *Book of Documents* states, *\"August Heaven and Earth.\"* *Huang* (august) means great, while *hou* (empress) is interchangeable with *hou* (thick). The ancient script did not distinguish between them. The Temple of Empress Earth in Yangzhou depicts her as a woman—this is erroneous. The *Monthly Ordinances* says, *\"Its spirit is Houtu,\"* with the commentary explaining that Houtu was a descendant of Emperor Zhuan. The *Rites of Sacrifice* states, *\"Gonggong ruled the Nine Provinces, and his son, Houtu, was able to pacify them, so he was worshipped as the spirit of the soil.\"* The *Zuozhuan* records, *\"Gonggong had a son named Goulong, who became Houtu.\"* How could this be a woman? In antiquity, the Son of Heaven was called the *yuanhou* (prime lord), while the feudal lords were called *qunhou* (many lords). If Houtu were a woman, would Hou Ji and Hou Fang also be women?\n\nZhu Xi remarked, *\"Nowadays, when sacrificing to the spirits of heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers, people carve images to worship—this is utterly devoid of principle.\"* I observe that in the *Treatise on Sacrifices* of the *History of the Western Han*, heaven and earth were worshipped together, both facing south, sharing the same mat and sacrificial animals. Emperor Gao and Empress Lü were paired as offerings on the altar, both facing west, also sharing a mat and sacrificial animals—this was to embody the principle of *qian* (Heaven, the father) and *kun* (Earth, the mother). At that time, no images were made, nor were separate positions established. As for the spirits of mountains and rivers, which are inherently formless, now the spirit of Mount Tai is depicted as an emperor, and the Empress Earth is given a wife and concubines—who knows from which families he took his wife or purchased his concubines?\n\nIn commanderies, there are temples to the Earth God called *Chenghuang* (City God) Temples, for they lie beneath the city walls. In ancient times, earth was dug to build walls, and the ground beneath was called *huang* (moat) if dry, or *chi* (pool) if filled with water. The *Book of Changes* says, *\"The city walls fall back into the moat,\"* meaning that when *Tai*’s top line reaches its extreme, it must revert, just as a collapsed city’s earth refills the moat. But counties without city walls also call their Earth God temples *Chenghuang* Temples—why?\n\nThe *Lüshi Chunqiu* records that Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, *\"Is it true that Kui had only one foot?\"* Confucius replied, *\"To tune the six pitch-pipes and harmonize the eight sounds, one man is sufficient.\"* I believe Duke Ai’s question took *Kui* to be a one-legged *gui* (demon). Some claim the Yellow Emperor had four eyes, or that Yao had eight eyebrows—these are groundless rumors, distortions from hearsay and street gossip. The *Biography of Cao Bao* in the *History of the Eastern Han* records Emperor Zhang saying to Ban Gu, *\"Yao composed the *Dazhang*—one Kui was enough.\"* This must have been an ancient saying, echoing Confucius’ response to Duke Ai. Kui was the official in charge of music during Shun’s reign, teaching the young. Duke Ai mistook *kui* (the name) for *gui* (a one-legged demon)—what a grievous injustice! The one-legged demon is the *shanxiao*, depicted in the Daoist *Yanluozi Tu* as having only one leg, hence the Tang poem: *\"The mountain demon leaps nimbly on its single foot.\"* How could Kui be such a creature?\n\nThe *Kong Congzi* speaks of *\"the strange creatures of earth and stone: Kui and Wangliang.\"* The *Discourses of the States* mentions *\"the strange creatures of wood and stone: Kui and Wangliang.\"* There was never any talk of a one-footed creature. Yet *Zhuangzi* says, *\"Kui had only one foot, and his gait was swift.\"* The commentary explains that Kui was a one-footed beast like an ox, hornless, with a voice like thunder. The Yellow Emperor killed it and stretched its hide over a drum, whose sound carried five hundred *li*—how absurd!\n\nAmong the southwestern barbarians of the Eastern Han, there was a kingdom said to descend from Panhu of the Yellow Emperor’s time. The tale of Panhu is bizarre and laughable—it defies all reason. Such impossibilities should only be discussed with those who clearly perceive principle; there is no need to argue with the ignorant or the young. Generally, those who spin strange tales attribute them to the Yellow Emperor’s era. The credulous believe them, but the discerning reject them.\n\nMount Dagu resembles a single shoe, while Mount Xiaogu resembles a stick of incense. Opposite them lies Penglang Shoal. Now, Xiaogu is called Xiaogu (Little Maiden), and Penglang (Peng the Youth) is said to be her husband, Peng, who married the Little Maiden. Travelers on the river pay their respects at their temple.\n\nIn Wenzhou, there is a temple to the Earth God called *Du Shiyi* (Du the Concubine), who has no husband, and *Wu Cuoxu Xianggong* (Lord Five-Tufts-of-Beard), who has no wife. The locals bring Du Shiyi to pair with Lord Five-Tufts-of-Beard, merging them into one temple. Who is Du Shiyi? She is Du Fu the Pick-Up-Leftovers. Who is Lord Five-Tufts-of-Beard? He is Wu Zixu. If Du Fu’s spirit still lingers, he must laugh at Zixu, saying, *\"You still have the title of Lord, while I am made a concubine—have they not emasculated me?\"*\n\nRecently, Li Yu, the Surveillance Commissioner, mentioned that north of Jiangling there is a station called *Fengjia*. At first, I did not understand what *Fengjia* meant. Upon asking the elders, I learned it was the residence of Lord Chunshen. *Chun* (Spring) was corrupted to *Feng* (Offer), and *Shen* (Shen) to *Jia* (Armor).\n\nSomeone from the Central Plains told me that in the north, there is a Temple of the Ox King, where a hundred oxen are painted on the walls, with the Ox King at their center. When asked who the Ox King was, they said it was Ran Boniu. Alas! Ran Boniu has become the Ox King.\n\nZhenwu was originally Xuanwu; during the Song dynasty, to avoid the imperial ancestor’s taboo, *xuan* (mysterious) was altered to *zhen* (true). Now, Xuanwu refers to the seven lunar lodgings of *Dou*, *Niu*, *Nü*, *Xu*, *Wei*, *Shi*, and *Bi*, which occupy the northern quadrant and belong to the Water element. In Jiangnan, households worship this constellation to suppress fire disasters. It is akin to Emperor Wu of Han adorning the *Bailiang* Hall with *chiwei*—the *chi* being a sea vessel, the essence of Water. Since Water can overcome Fire, such images were installed. Another example is the Yellow Tower in Xuzhou, its yellow earthen hue symbolizing Earth’s power to conquer Water.\n\nZhu Xi remarked that Zhenwu is not some divine figure with unbound hair; rather, it is merely Xuanwu. The so-called Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Xuanwu are not four separate creatures. The Horn Star forms the horn, the Heart Star the heart, and the Tail Star the tail—thus the Azure Dragon. The stars *Xu* and *Wei* resemble the *xuan* (a mythical snake) and *tengshe* (flying serpent), positioned beneath *Xu*, hence Xuanwu. During the reign of Emperor Zhenzong, the taboo on *xuan* led to its replacement with *zhen*. The *Can* stars have four legs like a tiger, hence the White Tiger. The *Yi* stars resemble wings, the *Zhen* stars a throat pouch, and the *Jing* stars a crown—thus the Vermilion Bird. Lu Tong’s poem speaks of \"wearing a *jing* crown,\" and Yang Xiong’s reference to \"dragon, tiger, crow, and *xuan*\" aligns precisely with this. Xuanwu is but another name for the *xuan*, a creature of the Water tribe. Water governs the North, its color black, hence *xuan*. The tortoise, armored and defensive, is called *wu* (martial). In truth, it is merely a tortoise. The seven northern lodgings form a tortoise shape, with the *Tengshe* star beneath it—a Fire element. Daoist alchemists borrowed this imagery to represent the interplay of Water and Fire within the body, depicting it as a tortoise and serpent entwined. The world, unaware of its origin, took Xuanwu to be two creatures: tortoise and serpent.\n\nJia Sidao once hosted a banquet where a guest refused to eat turtle. When asked why, the guest replied, \"I worship Zhenwu.\" Jia retorted, \"Zhenwu’s tortoise cannot be made into turtle!\" Failing to distinguish between tortoise and turtle, how could he govern the people? The guest, seeking an appointment as prefect, was denied the post. Another guest jested, \"Eels, loaches, and eels are inedible—they resemble Zhenwu’s serpent! Sugarcane and bamboo shoots are also forbidden—they resemble Zhenwu’s banner poles!\" The entire assembly laughed, and Jia joined in.\n\nHan Yu’s linked verse with Xuanyuan Miying and the stone tripod reads: *\"At times from the earthworm’s holes, cries like flies resound.\"* Later generations misinterpreted this as *\"The tea tripod’s voice hums like earthworms; incense coils like fireflies.\"* Though artful, the earthworm has no voice—this stems from a misreading of Han’s poem. Han meant the boiling water in the tripod sounded like flies, not earthworms. The \"earthworm’s holes\" refer to the tripod’s apertures, akin to earthworms’ burrows in mud. Cui Bao’s *Records of Past and Present* states that the earthworm, also called *qushan*, is skilled at singing underground, and the people of Jiangdong call it the \"singing maiden\"—a mistake. According to the *Monthly Ordinances*, when the mole cricket chirps, the earthworm emerges. The chirping creature is the mole cricket, not the earthworm. The people of Wu call the mole cricket *lougu*, hence the saying: *\"When the mole cricket calls, the intestines twist; only then does the earthworm earn its song.\"* Zhu Xi noted that taking Xuanwu as a true sage and depicting a tortoise and serpent beneath it lacks rationale. Adding Tianpeng, Tianyou, and Yisheng as the Four Saints is equally baseless.\n\nPhysicians say the liver, belonging to the East and Wood, stores the *hun*, while the lungs, belonging to the West and Metal, store the *po*. Daoists speak of \"three *hun* and seven *po*,\" but do the *hun* truly number three, or the *po* seven? No. The Nine Palaces’ numerology places three on the left and seven on the right. Bai Yuchan’s theory of \"three dragons and four tigers\" follows the same logic, as the *Tai Xuan* associates three with Wood and four with Metal.\n\nSu Ziyou remarked: \"Ancient texts state the left kidney’s *fu* is the bladder, and the right *mingmen*’s *fu* is the *sanjiao*. In men, it stores essence; in women, it connects the womb. Logically, the *sanjiao* should resemble the bladder—visible and tangible. Yet Wang Shuhe claimed the *sanjiao* has a name but no form. Is this not erroneous?\" Zeng Huchen countered: \"According to the *Baihu Tong*’s *Nature and Emotions* chapter, the upper *jiao* resembles a mist, the middle *jiao* a foam, and the lower *jiao* a ditch. By this, the *sanjiao* has form.\" Did Wang Shuhe fail to examine this, or did Su Ziyou momentarily forget? I believe what I heard from a *yu* practitioner: the *sanjiao* is the Yellow Court. Daoist alchemical texts describe the heart’s Fire and kidney’s Water gathering here for intense refinement, hence *sanjiao*—*jiao* meaning the martial Fire. Shen Cunzhong also said the Yellow Court has a name but no form, aligning with Wang Shuhe. Yet neither realized the Yellow Court is the *sanjiao*, nor that Wang’s claim of the *sanjiao*’s formlessness contradicts Zeng’s assertion of its tangibility. Following the *Baihu Tong*’s division into upper, middle, and lower *jiao* is also incorrect.\n\nDaoist texts state that among the eight extraordinary vessels, only the *Ren* and *Du* channels are the seas of the body’s Yin and Yang, the pivot of the Five Qi’s origin. The *Ren* channel begins below the *Zhongji* point, ascends through the pubic hair, follows the abdomen’s interior to *Guanyuan*, and reaches the throat—it is the sea of Yin channels. The *Du* channel starts at the *Xiaji* point, runs along the spine to *Fengfu*, enters the brain, ascends to the crown, follows the forehead to the nose—it is the sea of Yang channels. The *Yunlü* (cloud-trailing) tortoise, living five hundred years, masters the *Du* channel. The *xuan*’s longevity follows the same principle, as it masters the *Ren* channel through breath-holding and qi storage. One who masters both channels traverses the *Weilü*, connects the *Niuwan*, and harmonizes the hundred vessels. The *Huangting Jing* states: *\"All reside within the heart, revolving the Heavenly Path. Day and night, preserve it to attain longevity.\"* The Heavenly Path is the Yellow Path, the sun and moon’s route. In the human body, it is the *Ren* and *Du* channels, the path of breath’s ebb and flow.\n\nI once had a son who neither cried nor nursed and died after three days, the illness unknown. Later, reading medical texts like the *Baosheng Fang* and *Sanyin Fang*, I learned that infants who neither cry nor nurse at birth often suffer from wind entering the umbilical cord during severance. The wind ascends through the chest and throat to the lower gums, forming a yellow millet-like sore, causing unbearable pain—hence the silence and refusal to nurse. Scratching it with a fingernail releases yellow pus, after which the child cries and nurses. I taught this method to others, saving several infants. The *Suwen*, *Nanjing*, and *Jia Yi Jing* all state: *\"The *Ren* channel begins below *Zhongji*, ascends through the pubic hair, follows the abdomen’s interior to *Guanyuan*, and reaches the throat.\"* Zhu Gong’s *Inner and Outer Two Sceneries Diagram* notes that the gap between the upper and lower teeth, the *Yinjiao* point, is the intersection of the *Ren* and *Du* channels. Thus, newborns’ failure to cry or nurse stems from wind entering the *Ren* channel.\n\nA man of Wu surname from a wineshop in Mudu suffered from uncontrollable seminal emission, unresponsive to all medicines. I taught him a most simple technique: retract the flanks and abdomen, draw in the coccyx, close the orifices, shut the eyes tightly, and lower the head as if bearing a stone. Then draw qi straight from behind the back into the *Niwan* palace, swallow it, and send it down to the *Dantian*. Whether practiced for many or few repetitions, whether walking, sitting, lying, or standing, he was to perform this. I also instructed him to take the *Baozhen* pill, but he never consumed it, relying solely on this technique. Within half a year, I saw him again—his illness was cured, and his complexion bloomed like a peach. This method can also treat head-wind.\n\nDaoist side teachings include the technique of \"nasal inhalation and oral exhalation,\" claiming it prevents leakage. But if one exhales, how can there be no leakage? Initially skeptical, I tested it and found it effective. This technique can also cure nocturnal emission.\n\nThe world transmits the \"Three Peaks\" sexual arts under the names of the Yellow Emperor’s *Su Nu Jing* and *Xuannü Jing*, asserting that Rongcheng Gong and Peng Zu attained longevity through these methods. Many scholar-officials, deluded by this, have lost their lives—how lamentable! Ge Hong compared it to placing ice in a basin of boiling water or wrapping fire in feathers, or likened it to licking a blade’s edge or probing a tiger’s den—is this not perilous?\n\nThe *Beimeng Suoyan* records that the Tang dynasty Chancellor Xiahou Zi obtained Peng Zu’s techniques and became infatuated with a courtesan. Unable to satisfy her demands, he suffered seminal leakage and died. My maternal grandfather, Lüqiu Gong, served as *Dali Ping Shi* and learned this technique. His cheeks remained peach-like into his seventies, yet he ultimately perished from it, no different from Xiahou Zi. Daoist alchemists describe it as \"the barrel’s bottom falling out\": in middle age, when essence and vigor are robust, one can absorb, retract, and secure them, but in later years, when essence and vigor decline, one can no longer do so—thus, a single night exhausts them entirely.\n\nThe *Yijian Zhi* records that the Daoist Wu harmed the wife of a county clerk, only to be killed by the clerk in retaliation. Though Wu’s death scarcely repaid the lives of dozens of women, the clerk was also skilled in these arts, having once harmed others’ wives. His own wife narrowly escaped Wu’s predation, saved by the *Yanggao* decoction—fortunate indeed.\n\nDu Anren of Jiuhua Mountain’s *Nine Chapters on Precelestial Learning of Nature and Destiny* expounds at length with clarity. Some say this book was presented to the Gaozong Emperor. Upon reading its memorial, I found it stated: *\"Those who overindulge in mutual exchange will surely succor decline, aligning with the great *Guo* hexagram’s path of withered willows sprouting branches.\"* This is unmistakably bedroom arts, using the *Yijing* to embellish its methods—far from the Dao of purity and non-action.\n\nFushanzi’s commentary on the *Yinfu Jing*, equating \"mysterious devices\" with \"unused virgins,\" is a gross distortion of the Dao. His annotations to the *Cantong Qi* are forced and contrived—he is truly Wei Boyang’s nemesis. When Zhen Xishan wrote the preface to this book, Confucians, taking it for heterodoxy, no longer scrutinized its methods and were thus deceived.\n\nSanguzi’s *One Hundred Questions on the Golden Elixir* asks in its thirty-eighth question: *\"How are male and female determined at birth?\"* The answer: *\"If the man is aroused first and the woman responds afterward, a boy is conceived. If the woman is aroused first and the man responds afterward, a girl is conceived. When spirit and qi harmonize, essence is complete, and a child of upright appearance and blessed longevity is born. If the spirit is harmed, qi is exhausted, and essence is deficient, a child of monstrous form and meager fate is born.\"* Sanguzi, surnamed Qiu, named Shan, styled Andao, was a native of Nancheng in Jiangyou. Sangu was the name of his residence. In the early Qiandao era, he encountered an elder from Jinhua who transmitted the golden elixir’s arts, prompting him to write this book.\n\nChu Huagu of Yunjian’s *Qu Yi Fang* states: *\"Opening qi produces boys; closing qi produces girls. One opening and one closing determine male and female.\"* Li Yuxi of Yichun, in his commentary on the *Yuhuang Xinyin Jing*, writes: *\"Men and women receive the same endowment; it is only the sequence of arousal that distinguishes yin and yang.\"*\n\nThe *Chushi Yishu* states: *\"If yin blood arrives first and yang essence follows, the blood opens to envelop the essence, which enters to form bones—thus a boy is formed. If yang essence arrives first and yin blood follows, the essence opens to envelop the blood, which enters to reside in its root—thus a girl is formed.\"* Shi Jianwu’s *Zhong Lü Chuandao Ji* states: *\"If the father’s essence enters first and the mother’s blood follows, the blood envelops the essence to form a girl. If the mother’s blood enters first and the father’s essence follows, the essence envelops the blood to form a boy.\"* Jianwu likely drew from Chu’s theory, which contradicts Sanguzi’s—this discrepancy must be clarified.\n\nThirty years ago, I once discussed the distinction between male and female births with Wen Cixiao, the *Zongguan* of Yanshan. Cixiao strongly favored Sanguzi and Chu Huagu’s theories, adding: *\"Sun Simiao’s notion of 'heavenly gui' on the first and second days is not worth considering. Bai Yuchan’s theory of qi and blood’s waxing and waning, likened to the moon’s spirit, aligns with the *Suwen*’s statement: 'When the moon begins to wax, blood and qi begin to fill; when the moon is full, blood and qi are replete; when the moon wanes, the channels are empty.' Qi and blood wax from the new moon to the full moon and wane from the full moon to the dark moon. When the moon is full, the fish’s brain is plump; when the moon is dark, the fish’s brain diminishes. Clams and crabs follow the same pattern—neither the *Lüshi Chunqiu* nor the *Huainanzi* deceives.\"* I have often shared this with childless scholar-officials, and many have subsequently had sons. Yet whether one begets children or not rests with heaven’s decree—it is not something humans can force.\n\nMedical texts on methods to conceive boys frequently cite the *Chushi Yishu*, leading many astray. In my hometown, a nobleman’s son had two daughters in succession, and his concubine later conceived. The nobleman, overjoyed, told me: *\"This time, I will surely have a son—I followed Chu’s method!\"* I laughed and said: *\"If you followed Chu’s method, you should prepare to bow and listen—you’ll have another tile.\"* Later, he indeed had another daughter. I then explained Sanguzi and Chu Huagu’s theories to him, and the following year, he had a son.\n\nRecently, in casual conversation, Guo Boying of Chengjiang mentioned the Central Plains’ elders Hu Zishan, Wen Cixiao, and Hao Jifu, who debated the *Chushi Yishu*’s theories. Boying sighed: *\"I was misled by this book!\"* He, too, had followed Chu’s method, fathering six daughters in succession without realizing his error. Later, he discussed this with Zhang Shilong’s son from Songjiang—truly, one lost soul guiding another. I told him: *\"You must correct this at once!\"* Boying asked: *\"How should I correct it?\"* I replied: *\"If yang essence arrives first and yin blood envelops it, with yang within, a boy is formed—this is the Qian Dao seeking Kun to form a boy. If yin blood arrives first and yang essence envelops it, with yin within, a girl is formed—this is the Kun Dao seeking Qian to form a girl.\"* Boying heard this, laughed, expressed his thanks, and departed.\n\nSome may wonder: why do noblemen with concubines aplenty father few sons, while humble fishermen with but one wife bear many? This principle is as clear as day—what difficulty lies in seeing it? For those with few desires may have children, while those with many desires cannot. It is like seasoning a bowl of soup: just enough salt makes it savory, but too much renders it tasteless. If scholar-officials wish to have sons, they must practice moderation in desire; otherwise, they are like one who seeks oil from a withered pine or sap from a dried bamboo—how can they hope for offspring? The *Classic of Filial Piety* states: \"Of all that parents give to continue life, nothing is greater.\" Those who have not yet had sons must take heed.\n\nYet there is another reason: men are like Heaven, women like Earth. Though Heaven’s rain and dew ever moisten the land, Earth varies in fertility—some soils nurture life, others do not. If the land is barren, saline, or strewn with rubble, to demand it bear life is like carving ice to alter its form or grinding indigo to produce red—vain hope with no reward. The *Book of Later Han* records that Ma Le’s grandfather, Yan, stood less than seven *chi* tall and often lamented his short stature, fearing his descendants would inherit it. Thus, he arranged for his son, Kang, to marry a tall wife. Kang fathered Le, who grew to eight *chi* and three *cun*. Yet in later times, as customs declined, scholar-officials of Jiangnan indulged in sensual pleasures, marrying wives and concubines for their youth and delicacy. The sons they bore were frail, sickly, and often died young. Some even entered the bedchamber in drunkenness, their spirits muddled and disordered; though they might conceive, their children would lack intelligence.\n\nWhen yin and yang arrive in equal measure, the body is neither male nor female. This is the origin of scattered essence and blood, giving rise to twin or multiple births—such is the theory of the *Chushi Yishu*. Some are born without an anus, others without a birth canal. Why is this so? Xu Xun’s *On the Transformation of Embryos* states that conception occurs when the parents urgently relieve themselves. This theory also appears in the *Canon of Hygiene*. Some children are born with heads like snow and skin entirely white. Some suppose this results from conception on the day of the *She* sacrifice, hence calling such males \"She Lords\" and females \"She Ladies.\" But this is not so. Xu Xun’s *On the Transformation of Embryos* explains that if conception occurs while the mother’s menstrual blood is flowing, the excess blood overflows, forming the fetus—thus the flesh and skin are white. Chu’s theory that \"when blood fills the flesh, the body is white\" aligns with this. Why are the hair and eyes also white, with the gaze unsteady? The classics say: \"Hair is the surplus of blood,\" and \"The liver receives blood and enables sight.\" When menstruation is underway, blood is depleted, the liver weakened, hair loses its nourishment, and the eyes lack sustenance.\n\nFrom *Idle Chats at the Banquet Table*, Volume One, *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* (Imperially Commissioned)\n\nFrom *Idle Chats at the Banquet Table*, Volume Two\nBy Yu Yan of the Yuan Dynasty\n\nThe study of nourishing life takes the teachings of Laozi as its foundation. Laozi composed the *Dao De Jing*. Contemporaneously, there was Cheng Ben, a disciple of Laozi, with whom Confucius conversed after their carriages met by chance. His work is titled *Zi Hua Zi*. There were also Wenzi and Guanling Yin Xi, both disciples of Laozi. Wenzi’s book is called the *Tongxuan Zhenjing*, and Yin Xi’s book is called the *Guan Yin Zi*. Later, there appeared Liezi’s *Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing* and Zhuangzi’s *Nanhua Zhenjing*, both of which trace their lineage to Laozi’s teachings. The titles of these classics were bestowed by the imperial decree of Emperor Huizong.\n\nLaozi’s works are numerous. During the Han, there was He Shanggong; in the Wei, Wang Bi; in the Tang, Ye Fashan; in the Song, Su Ziyou and Wang Pang. In recent times, the You family of Wuxi produced *Laozi Yinxun*, which argues that the ancient text of Wang [Bi] is vastly superior to later versions, and its reasoning is sound.\n\nThe *Zi Hua Zi* is cited in the *Lingshu Jing*. Wenzi’s work has a commentary by Moxi Zi. In my view, the opening chapter of *Wenzi* states: \"Without the Dao, one cannot speak of it.\" This \"cannot speak\" is the Dao, aligning perfectly with Laozi’s \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\" The *Guan Yin Zi* has a commentary by Chen Baoyi. Liezi’s work has a commentary by Zhang Zhan, and Zhuangzi’s has commentaries by Guo Xiang and Cheng Xuanying. More recently, Lin Yanzhai produced *Oral Explications of the Three Masters: Laozi, Liezi, and Zhuangzi*. Liezi quotes the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*: \"The valley spirit does not die; it is called the mysterious female.\" In my view, this phrase originates from the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*, and what Laozi speaks of also derives from it. Zhuangzi’s work is based on Liezi, serving to elucidate Liezi’s meaning.\n\nThe *Huangdi Yinfu Jing* and the *Huangdi Suwen*—Shao Kangjie believed these were books from the time of the Beastly States, falsely attributed to the Yellow Emperor. In my view, the *Jinbi Longhu Jing* and the *Huangting Jing* are likely literary works from the Wei-Jin period, falsely attributed to Laozi’s lineage.\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* has commentaries by Li Quan, the Old Woman of Mount Li, Zhang Guo, Lian Gaojiao, Tang Chun of Jinling, Li Yunfeng, Chu Huagu, and Zhu Xi. Zhu Xi remarked: \"The *Yinfu Jing* is likely a work by Li Quan of the Tang. Why would he deliberately imitate ancient prose? Simply because once he spoke of it, the text gained circulation. I once mentioned this to Lü Bogong, who agreed. It is much like the *Mayi Yi*, which was actually composed by Master Dai, though its self-explanatory text might deceive one into accepting it.\"\n\nThe *Longhu Jing* has commentaries by Wang Dao, Huang Tong, and Taixu Zi. Zhu Xi said: \"The *Longhu Jing* is merely an abridgment of the *Cantong Qi*. Since the *Cantong Qi* contains ancient records mentioning the dragon and tiger, this book was subsequently composed. For example, the *Cantong Qi* states: 'The two agents have no fixed position, circulating through the six voids.' This refers to the two agents, nine and six, moving through the six lines without a fixed position. The *Longhu Jing*, however, says: 'The two agents have no fixed position; Zhang and Yi fly through the void, soaring to Xu and Wei'—a bizarre and far-fetched interpretation.\"\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* was written by Wei Boyang of the Eastern Han. Ge Hong stated that Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi*, borrowing the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* to discuss the art of elixir-making. Yet Confucians, unaware of the affairs of immortals, instead provided commentaries on yin and yang, entirely missing its essential purport. Nevertheless, even before the Jin dynasty, there were already commentaries on the *Cantong Qi*.\n\nFor instance, Yu Fan and Yin Changsheng both wrote commentaries, though these are no longer extant. By the Five Dynasties, during the false Shu regime, Zhenyi Zi (Peng Xiao) composed the *Tongzhen Yi*, interpreting the \"three phases\" as \"five phases\"—a mistake.\n\nThe \"three phases\" refer to the *Great Yi* and the [teachings of] the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.\n\nThe matter concerns the art of furnace and fire, wherein the yin and yang of the Three [Teachings] engage in transformation, all fundamentally interconnected. *Can* (參) means \"three,\" *tong* (同) means \"mutual,\" and *qi* (契) means \"accord\"—this is an explication of the title *Cantong Qi*. The phrase \"commission the seasons, depart from harm, and neighbor the ghost\" refers to the character *Wei* (魏). Zheng Huan mistakenly altered *ghost* (鬼) to *immortal* (仙). Beneath *baiyi* (百一), \"roaming the human realm,\" the character *baiyi* (百一) with the addition of a standing *ren* (人) to its side forms *Bo* (伯). Tang encountered adversity—drought and flood kept him apart; the absence of water during drought forms *Yi* (易). Combining the adversity of *e* (阨) and the boundary of *ji* (际) below yields *Yang* (阳). This is an explication of the three characters *Wei Boyang*.\n\nPeng Zhenyi’s commentary exists in the Shu edition, Yuan edition, Ji edition, and Xu Yizi’s edition. Zheng Huan’s edition was carved by Wang Gang and placed beneath the Penglai Pavilion in Yuezhou. After Peng Zhenyi’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi*, there appeared Zhang Sui’s commentary, Li Baosu’s commentary (rather brief), Chen Baoyi’s commentary, and Chu Huagu’s commentary, which contains many insights. Zhu Xi once composed a commentary under the name of the Kongtong Daoist Zou Fang—*Zou* being the state of Zhu in the Spring and Autumn period. He also wrote the *Kaoyi*. Tao Hongjing’s *Zhen Gao* contains many poems about immortal maidens descending, which discerning readers reject, for they are merely Hongjing’s own fabrications. Zhu Xi remarked that the final \"Daoist Transmission\" section of the *Zhen Gao* was nothing more than a plagiarism of the Buddhist *Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters*.\n\nDuring the Tang, there were Wu Zhenjie’s *Xuan Gang Lun*, Sima Zixu’s *Zuowang Lun*, Wang Changyu’s *Yi Xuanzi Shi*, Han Xiaoyao’s *Neizhi Tongxuan Pian*. Sima Zixu’s preface to the *Tianyouzi* states: \"The essential subtlety lies in harmonizing with the true qi of Heaven and Earth and moving in unison with it,\" and further, \"When the qi of awakening arrives, circulate one’s own qi to align with the qi of Heaven and Earth, acting in concert.\" This is the most sublime technique. If, within three hundred and sixty days, one’s own qi aligns with that of Heaven and Earth two or three times, one will naturally feel the body’s clarity and harmony, unlike ordinary times. How much more so if this is sustained over time—the Dao of immortality will not be difficult to attain.\n\nThe *Huashu* was written by Tan Qiao, whose courtesy name was Jingsheng. He brought his book to seek a preface from Qi Jiu, who killed Tan Qiao and usurped the work, claiming it as his own. The *Ruyao Jing* was composed by Cui Daifan of White Crane Mountain. Lü Dongbin’s poem reads: \"Gazing upon Master Cui’s *Ruyao Jing* / Makes one’s heart-ground ever clearer.\" Xia Yunfeng, Chu Huagu, and Xiao Liaozhen all wrote commentaries. Upon examining the text, it states: \"Heaven responds to the stars, Earth responds to the tides\"—this merely refers to the mutual correspondence of above and below. If one clings rigidly to its meaning, the Dipper’s handle shifts one mansion each month, differing monthly, while the sea’s tides arrive twice daily, consistently. How can both respond in unison?\n\nIt further states: \"Exhaust *wu-si* (戊巳),\" yet some mistakenly render it as \"exhaust *wu-gui* (戊癸),\" taking *gui* (癸) as *tian gui* (天癸). This is akin to the *Wuzhen Pian*, where it speaks of \"seeing the sprout arise, one must swiftly gather it,\" yet some interpret \"sprout arise\" as \"gui arise.\" These are all distortions by practitioners of the Three Peaks technique, who recklessly alter the text to validate their heterodox doctrines. Chu Huagu’s theory of *wu-gui* transforming into fire and Li Yuxi’s discourse on *kun-gui* are attempts to rectify heterodoxy and return to orthodoxy, though their arguments are strained.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties, there were Zhongli Ji’s *Daoji Xuanshu* in thirty-nine chapters, Lü Dongbin’s poems, Shi Jianwu’s *Jingzhong Yin*, the *Sanzhu Ming*, and the *Xishan Qiongzhen Ji*, as well as the *Zhong Lü Chuandao Ji*. In the Song, there were Chen Tuan’s *Zhixuan Pian* in eighty-one poems, Liu Haichan’s *Huánjīn Piān* in fourteen poems, Chen Chaoyuan’s *Yuzhi Shi*, Yang Xuchun’s *Cuilun*, Liu Xihe’s *Langranzi Shi*, Ning Xuanzhi’s poems, Zhang Hongmeng’s *Huanyuan Pian*, the *Yuding Wujie Pian*, Zhang Pingshu’s *Wuzhen Pian*, Xue Daofu’s *Fuming Pian*, Liu Gaoshang’s *Fayu*, Liu Xugu’s *Huandan Pian*, Chen Mo’s *Chongzheng Pian*, and Li Changyuan’s *Hunyuan Pian*. Among these works, only the *Wuzhen Pian* and *Fuming Pian* have commentaries.\n\nZhang Junfang compiled the Daoist Canon into the *Yunji Qiqian*, which is heavily interspersed with talismans, rituals, and doctrines of karmic retribution—matters with which Zeng Zao (Zeng Zhi) was deeply concerned. Zeng Zao’s *Daoshu* collects the elixir poems and songs of various immortals, such as Haichan’s *Huánjīn* and Chaoyuan’s *Yuzhi*, all included therein.\n\nLiu Xiang’s *Liexian Zhuan*, Ge Hong’s *Shenxian Zhuan*, Shen Fen’s *Xuxian Zhuan*, Zeng Zhi’s *Jixian Zhuan*, Yi Rugang’s *Xianzhuan Shiyi*, and Chen Baoguang’s *Sandong Shenxian Lu*—along with works like the *Dongxian Zhuan* and *Shenxian Ganyu Zhuan*—though miscellaneous, record the names of immortals from ancient and modern times. Among the poems, songs, and verses of elixirists are Yuanyangzi’s *Dadao Ge*, Master Zeng’s *Lingyuan Ge*, Zhang Xujing’s *Dadao Ge*, Gao Xiangxian’s *Pomi Ge*, Wu Zhenjie’s *Xuexian Ge*, and the *Yuding Pomi Ge*. A portion of the *Zhengdao Ge* is missing. Liu Gaoshang’s *Qiaoyao Ge* has a commentary by Jinhua Zi, and there are also poems by Dongwei Zi. Some works are falsely attributed to ancient figures, such as Yin Jun’s *Huandan Ge*, the Three Mao Lords’ *Dadao Ge*, Ge Xianweng’s *Liuzhu Ge*, Xu Jingyang’s *Zuisi Xian Ge*, and Lü Gong’s *Xuanpin Ge*. Many of these contain passages that clarify their meaning.\n\nLiu Xugu’s *Yiji* merely borrows the *Yi* to embellish its doctrines—he was no true knower of the *Yi*. Thus, Zhu Xi vehemently criticized such works.\n\nChen Gushen’s *Liaoran Lun*, Zhan Tianxi’s *Dayi Neijie*, Wang Xubai’s *Sanjiao Guanyi Lun*, and Yang Penglou’s *Sanwu Guiyi*—though their doctrines are extensive, all contain elements worth observing.\n\nBai Yuchan authored the *Wuyi Ji*, *Shangqing Ji*, *Yulong Ji*, *Haiqiong Ji*, and *Jinguan Yuyue Ji*. Additionally, there are Liu Ziyuan’s *Wendao Ji* and Peng Helin’s *Wendao Pian*, both compiled by their disciples. The *Qunxian Zhuyu Ji* includes Zhang Ziyang’s *Jindan Sibai Zi* and Shi Xinglin’s *Huanyuan Pian*. Their literary style and tone are indistinguishable from Yuchan’s own works, for Yuchan merely attributed them to Zhang and Shi.\n\nChen Niuwan’s *Cuixu Pian* was also composed by Yuchan. Its opening poems are those of Yuanyangzi, followed by the *Ziting Jing*, *Luofu Yin*, and *Guiyi Lun*—all bearing the same hand as the *Wuyi* and other collections.\n\nYuchan’s letters to Chen Niuwan and Zhang Ziyang do nothing but amplify their doctrines, employing such phrases as \"green mountains and evening clouds, jade pools and moonlit nights, plantains in spring winds, and the secrets of parasol trees in autumn rain\" to describe the subtleties of ascent and descent, floating and sinking, exhausting the art of metaphor. His deliberate embellishments and fabrications were intended to secure the trust of contemporary scholars.\n\nYuchan transmitted his teachings to Peng Helin, Peng Ziyuan, and Xiao Liaozhen. Xiao’s *Jindan Dacheng Ji* elucidates Yuchan’s doctrine, stating: \"The seventy-two ultimately return to forty-eight—this is the profound oral transmission of the Dao.\" The *Huanyuan Pian* reads: \"Three catties of old mercury, one ounce of true lead, and four ounces of red.\" The *Sibai Zi* states: \"Three catties of old mercury, one ounce of true lead, and four ounces of black.\" Here, the forty-eight refers to the three catties of mercury, while the one ounce is the true lead. One catty equals sixteen ounces, which is two eights—two eights being half a catty of metal and half a catty of water.\n\nThe *Wuzhen Pian* likewise speaks of \"one catty of medicinal substances requiring the balance of two eights, with fire phases entrusted to yin and yang.\" Liaozhen presented a diagram wherein the doubled Kan trigram resides at *zi*, the doubled Li at *wu*. Kan first transforms into *Jie* at *chou*, then into *Zhun* at *yin*; Li first transforms into *Lü* at *wei*, then into *Ding* at *shen*, then into *Weiji* at *you*, and finally into *Feng* at *xu*—this constitutes \"morning *Zhun*, evening *Feng*.\" *Zhun* is lower *Zhen* and upper *Kan*; *Feng* is upper *Kan* and lower *Gen*. *Zhen* signifies movement, *Gen* stillness, corresponding to the dynamics of dawn and dusk.\n\nThere was also Liao Chanhui, who composed the *Neipian of the Three Vehicles*; Shen Baichan, who wrote the *Jindan Pian*—both disciples of Yuchan. Xu Zhiwei’s *Xiuzhen Mijue of the Precelestial Orthodox Lineage* employs the transitions of the twelve hours as markers. In his preface, he states that during the Chunxi era, he received transmission from Peng Mengqu of Hanzhou. Later, Xiao Guanfu’s *Danxu* and *Baojian* contained inner images of the elixir’s principles, aligning with Zhiwei’s transmission. The *Dayuan Pian* by Annanzi, whose surname is unknown, and Wei Xian’s work from Shouchun in the Jiayou era of Jiaxi, as well as Chen Guan’s *Zhengdao Pian* by Suyangzi of Mount Lu (with prefaces by Meng Gong of Handong and Liu Yuangang of Luling in the second year of Chunyou), all bear witness to this lineage.\n\nZhou Wusuo of Yongjia’s *Jindan Zhizhi* was postscripted by Yang Zizheng of Shu in the Jiachen year of Baoyou. His *Miscellaneous Writings* incorporated the doctrines of the *Lianluo* school, revealing profound principles. Zhang Yongchang’s *Zhenru Zhiming Pian* was printed in the Wuwu year of Qingyuan by Zhaoyangzi Zhao Yan. The *Dan Jue* of Huo Shanggu of Piling included the *Yizi Xuanji* and *Canwen*. In the seventh month, You Mushi of Wuxi prefaced his work. Shanggu’s disciple, Juchuan, further composed the *Jindan Koujue Zhizhi*, extensively discussing the celestial *wu-si* hours and their correspondence with the human body—*Kan* as *wu* and *Li* as *si*. In heaven, this signifies the mutual gaze of sun and moon; in the human body, the reciprocal nurturing of breath.\n\nIn my hometown, Prefect Mi, whose given name is lost and whose style was Yunzhai, rose to the rank of *Fengzhi Dafu*. His *Mingzhen Pian* by Dongyangzi was printed at his residence in the Dingsi year of Baoyou. In Yunjian, there was Chan’guzi Wang Kui’s *Guanling Pian* and Huaguzi Chu Yong’s *Jieyinfu Jing*, *Cantong Qi*, *Yaojing*, and *Wuzhen* in four volumes, along with his *Fang Sanji*, all printed in Songjiang. The Taoist Feng Shoujing of Kuocang authored the *Zhengdao Pian*, though it was never printed. Both he and Wang Yi’an received the Dao from Cao Mo’an.\n\nLi Jianyi of Yichun, styled Yuxizi, wrote the *Xinjing Jie*, *Wuzhen Zhiyao*, *Xihuang Zuoyong*, and other works, along with the *Gui Shi Tu*, which he entrusted to Peng Shipo of Changsha—its explanations were exceptionally clear. These were printed in Hunan, and later reprinted in Jiangxi. Peng Shipo also possessed esoteric sayings, the *Jiafu Dazuo Tiaoyuanqi Ge* with annotations, and its concluding lines read: \"Record this and promptly commit it to the *bing-ding*—this is the true oral instruction for commencing practice.\" At the time, Peng, unwilling to destroy it, allowed it to circulate among the rivers and lakes. Whoever obtained this text could proceed without further inquiry.\n\nIn the Wuxu year of Dade, a fellow Daoist from Xiangtan presented me with Zhao Guchan’s *Xingming Hundun Shu*. Though interspersed with Chan terminology, its explanations were nonetheless lucid. In the summer of the Gengzi year of Dade, Hu Yun showed me the *Jindan Youxuan Pian*, stating it was the work of Liang Jiuyang. Its preface revealed that he received it from Wang Shanbin of Tiantaishan, whose style was Zhenchangzi. Shanbin, also known as Wang Keda, exchanged verses with Xia Yunfeng and Chen Liaokong of Yulu’an. Shanbin’s *Zhongmiao Yi Ji* was brought to me by Grand Preceptor Wen Ruxin in the Xinsi year of Zhiyuan—this was a handwritten copy.\n\nXia Yuanding of Yongjia, styled Yunfeng, annotated the *Yinfu Jing*, *Yaojing*, and *Wuzhen Pian*, with a preface by Zhen Xishan. Yu Lu’an of Luxi printed the *Xiushen Sishu* at Yangjiao Dongtian, comprising: first, Han Xiaoyao’s *Neizhi Tongxuan Jue*; second, Chen Liaokong’s *Fu Yi Pian*; third, Wang Dai’s *Cheju Yi Pian*; and fourth, *Danfang Deyi Pian*. In the Gengwu year of Xianchun, He Fengji of Shu provided the preface.\n\nChen Yudao of Weizhou, styled Baoyizi, authored the *Liming Pian*. In the Gengyin year of Shaoding, Bai Yuchan wrote a postscript, and he also annotated the *Guanyinzi* and *Cantong Qi*, with Prime Minister Dong Jutang adding a colophon. Sanguzi Qiu Shan’s *Jindan Baiwen* states that in the early Qiandao era, he received the Dao from the Old Man of Jinhua. Wei Yuzi’s *Zhipian* preface, written in the Gengyin year of Shaoding, does not record his surname. His disciple composed the *Chengzhen Pian*, also without attribution.\n\nThe Golden Realization Teachings of Wang Chongyang include the *Jinzhen Ji*, Ma Danyang’s *Weiyu Ji*, *Jinyu Ji*, Tan Changzhen’s *Shuiyun Ji*, Liu Changsheng’s *Xianle Ji*, Qiu Changchun’s *Panxi Ji*, *Mingdao Ji*, Wang Yuyang’s *Lingguang Ji*, and Hao Guangning’s *Taigu Ji*. Northern editions collectively titled *Qizhen Yaoxun* were widely circulated. In the Jihai year of Dade, I was presented with Ding Lingyang’s collected works and requested to write a preface for Ma Danyang’s *Yulu*, which I accordingly provided.\n\nSome say that Huo Shanggu, Yuchangu, Chu Huagu, and Mi Dongyang all possessed knowledge but did not practice. Though their writings remain, they are but empty words.\n\nI say otherwise—have you not heard of Liezi’s account? Liezi states: \"There was once a man who spoke of the Way of immortality. Yanju sent someone to learn it, but the learner failed. The speaker died, and Yanju, enraged, sought to punish the envoy. A wise man admonished him, saying, 'What men fear most is death, and what they value most is life. If he himself lost his life, how could he grant you immortality? Thus, you ought not execute the envoy.' There was a man of Qi who also wished to learn this Way. Upon hearing of the speaker’s death, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi, hearing of this, laughed and said, 'He wished to learn the Way of immortality, yet the man who taught it is dead, and still he regrets it—this is to not know the purpose of learning.' Huzi replied, 'Fuzi’s words are mistaken. There are those who possess arts they cannot practice, and there are those who can practice but lack the arts. A man of Wei skilled in calculation, before dying, revealed his method to his son. The son memorized his father’s words but could not perform it. Another man, upon hearing the method, practiced it and achieved results no different from the father’s. If this is so, how could the dead be unable to transmit the arts of life?'\n\nZhu Xi said to Jitong, 'Yin Jun’s alchemical formulas appear in *Liánxī’s Poems*—those who follow them and attain longevity are like men who eat pork and are sated. Yet we know of many such cases, and still we cannot escape decline and illness. Is this not like discussing dragon meat without ever having tasted it?' Forty years ago, when I annotated the *Cantong Qi*, I saw Lü Sixing’s *Eight Brocade Arts* and marveled at his vigor in old age, secretly laughing at him. Now, reflecting on it, the learning of the *Cantong Qi* is truly the art of butchering dragons—far inferior to Sixing’s skill in slaughtering swine.\n\nTo know yet not practice is what Zhu Xi called 'discussing dragon meat.' Yet those who study this Way must abandon wife and children to pursue it. We read the books of the sages—how, with parents still living, could we dare defy Heaven and scheme for a stolen life? Nevertheless, I have tried this in nightly meditation and have thus gained some slight taste of dragon meat. Is this not better than merely discussing it without knowing its flavor? In my youth...\"\n\nThough frail and sickly, scarcely able to bear the weight of my clothes, I have clung to this thread of breath and lived to this day—this, too, is the power of the *Cantong Qi*. After the fall of the Deyou era, the literary world lay in ruins, and I had no use for my mind. I shut my door, sat in stillness, and amused myself with the qin. Reading the *Yijing* and the inner and outer alchemical texts, I developed four obsessions: first, the qin. I sought to rectify the five notes with the six pitch-pipes, but when I asked qin masters, none could answer. Later, I obtained the *Qin Book of Master Ziyang*, the *Nanxi Anthology of Qin*, and the *Jade Manual of Profound Sounds*, and only then did I grasp the method of modulating the modes. Thus, I composed qin tablatures for the *Odes of Zhou Nan* and *Shao Nan*, as well as for poems like *Deer Cry*, *Huanghua*, and *Li Sao*, the *Nine Songs*, the *Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Poems*, *Returning Home*, *The Pavilion of the Drunken Old Man*, and *The Red Cliff Rhapsody*. My obsession with the qin was thus sated.\n\nNext was the *Yijing*. I compiled the interpretations of various scholars into a work of one hundred and twenty fascicles, titled *Essentials of the Great Yijing*, taking Master Cheng and Master Zhu as my foundation and supplementing them with the best of other commentaries. I further added my own insights from teachers and friends, resulting in forty fascicles of *Collected Commentaries on the Zhouyi*. This obsession, too, was satisfied.\n\nFor inner alchemy, I gathered alchemical poems, songs, and formulas from the Han and Tang dynasties into one hundred fascicles, calling it the *Comprehensive Anthology of the Mysterious*. In the guiwei year of the Zhiyuan era, I encountered an extraordinary man who transmitted to me the ultimate mystery of the primordial. Thereafter, I composed works such as *Elucidations on the Cantong Qi* and *Extended Meanings of the Wuzhen Pian*, and this obsession also subsided.\n\nAs for outer alchemy, I knew nothing of cinnabar or mercury, and my attempts only produced smoke and flames. One night, I suddenly awakened to the truth of the *Cantong Qi*: gold is made from sand, and it is amalgamated with mercury. In this world, there is only the golden elixir—there is no silver elixir. Thus, I smashed my furnace and crucible, and this obsession never arose again. I once compiled a *Record of Warnings for Alchemical Furnaces*, but here I merely sketch its outline.\n\nIn the third year of Xiande during the reign of Emperor Shizong of Zhou, the Daoist Chen Tuan of Mount Hua was summoned and asked about the art of transmuting base metals into gold. He replied, \"Your Majesty is the Son of Heaven; your duty is to govern the realm. Why concern yourself with such things?\" The emperor then sent him back to the mountains, ordering local officials to inquire after his well-being.\n\nDuring the Jingde era of Emperor Zhenzong, while the emperor was visiting the imperial tombs, he summoned extraordinary individuals. Among them was Helan Guizhen, who was summoned for an audience. The emperor asked, \"I hear you possess the art of transformation. You may speak of it.\" Helan replied, \"I would speak of the art of imperial transformation. I wish to transform the realm with the Dao of Yao and Shun, bringing about great peace. May Your Majesty employ it.\"\n\nWang Jie, a native of Tingzhou, was a merchant who traveled between the Jiang and Huai regions. He encountered an extraordinary man who taught him the art of transmuting gold, warning him, \"Do not recklessly transmit this unless you meet a ruler.\" Eager to present it to the emperor, Wang was arrested by officials and feigned madness to avoid punishment. He was tattooed and exiled beyond the Five Ridges, but later escaped and hid in the capital. He went to the Court of Judicial Review, claiming to be a former subordinate of the Privy Councilor Xie Congquan. Xie, who had once served as an official in Lingnan, knew of Wang’s art and memorialized the throne, securing his release from military service.\n\nA eunuch, Liu Chenggui, reported Wang’s name to the emperor, who summoned him for an audience. Pleased with their conversation, the emperor appointed him as a military officer in Xuzhou, changed his name to Wang Zhongzheng, and kept him in the capital. Wang repeatedly presented gold, amounting to tens of thousands, and rose to the rank of Right Divine Martial General and Military Commissioner of Tangzhou. An old smith named Bi Sheng, who had worked in the palace forging gold for Wang, said of the method: \"The furnace and bellows were arranged so that others were made to work them from behind a wall, lest they glimpse the opening and closing of the process.\"\n\nThe gold was made of iron, with over a hundred taels cast into one cake. Each cake was divided into eight pieces, called \"crow’s-beak gold.\" The emperor ordered the Imperial Workshop to cast the gold into ingots and plaques, numbering in the hundreds. Tortoiseshell-shaped plaques were bestowed upon close ministers, while the rest were stored in the Jade Purity and Radiant Response Palace. Plaques were also given to each prefecture, commandery, and military district, and the golden treasure plaques of the Heavenly Celebration Abbey were cast from this same gold.\n\nFor each forging, Wang used snake mounds to refine realgar, killing countless snakes in the process. Later, while building his residence, he unearthed a giant snake with a head as large as a basket. Shocked, he fell ill and died at the age of fifty-five. His wife, Lady Shi, was enfeoffed as the Lady of Wu Commandery, and his sons were all appointed as palace attendants.\n\nWang Jie had initially obtained his divine art but never revealed it for power or profit. After receiving emoluments and gifts, he used the transmuted gold only to support the poor and to aid Daoist and Buddhist establishments. Whenever the court held grand ceremonies or undertook construction, he presented gold to assist with expenses. The *History of the Song Dynasty* contains a biography of Wang Zhongzheng, written by the Grand Historian Zeng Gong. The *Collection of Eminent Ministers’ Steles and Biographies* states that during the Xianping era, Wang Jie arrived in Nankang Commandery and met an extraordinary man who claimed to be surnamed Zhao. After some time, they met again on Mount Mao, where Zhao instructed him in the method of making gold.\n\nThe *Guangling Gazetteer* records that Wang Jie met a Daoist in Weiyang, who took him to the Temple of the Five Manifestations and pointed out a sacred herb. The Daoist taught him the secret formula for combining it. During the Dazhong Xiangfu era, Wang composed a text to thank the temple, where an old stone inscription of a prayer once stood. Though lost to war and fire, the herb for transmuting gold still grows there.\n\nZhang Yong, the Duke of Wending, styled himself Fuzhi and was also known as Guaiya. While serving in Shu, an alchemist sought an audience, claiming to be able to transmute mercury into silver. Zhang immediately purchased a hundred taels of mercury and had the alchemist refine it. After one firing, the mercury turned to silver without the slightest loss in weight. Zhang ordered a craftsman to cast it into a large incense burner, which he had inscribed on its belly: \"For the main hall of the Great Compassion Temple.\" He then sent the burner to the temple, along with a wine vessel as a gift for the alchemist, whom he dismissed.\n\nFan Zhongyan, styled himself Xiwen, was on good terms with a man from Nanjun surnamed Zhu. When Zhu fell ill, Fan visited him. Zhu said, \"I met an extraordinary man who taught me the art of transforming mercury into silver. You are still young and unworthy of this transmission, so I now pass it to you.\" He then gave Fan the formula and the medicine. Fan refused, but Zhu insisted, so he accepted it unopened. Later, when Zhu’s son Cai came of age, Fan instructed him as he would his own son. After Cai passed the imperial examinations, Fan returned the sealed medicine and the method to him.\n\nHu Su, the Duke of Wengong, styled himself Wuping, was on good terms with a Buddhist monk in his youth. As the monk lay dying, he said to Hu, \"I possess a secret art that can transform tiles and stones into gold. You will see to my burial.\" Hu replied, \"I will certainly attend to your funeral affairs, but I have no desire for secret arts.\" The monk sighed and said, \"Your aspirations are beyond measure.\"\n\nThe father of Ju Shiying, a compiler in the Bureau of Military Affairs, was known as Fourth Gentleman Ju. In his youth, he encountered an extraordinary man who taught him the method of refining cinnabar with concealed fire. Using equal parts gold and mercury, he formed a sand-like amalgam, which he wrapped in the concealed-fire cinnabar and refined into purple-lustrous gold. He never spoke of this to others, though he occasionally used a small amount. On his deathbed, he called for Shiying and said, \"I have only ever revealed this refining method to Minister Han.\"\n\nThe method must not be passed on to anyone unworthy—only one as virtuous and accomplished as Minister Han is fit to receive it. Nor should I transmit it to you; if it is truly your destined portion, someone will come to teach you. Yet I know that once word spreads of my possession of this art, reckless seekers will come, so I will tell you of several formulas that fail to produce treasure, and recount how several men who dabbled in them met with disaster. Beware, beware!\n\nI once had a servant who tended the fire for years without slackening. Later, I judged him fit to become a monk, and he took up residence in the Capital’s Calendar Bureau. At the time, Zeng Zixuan held high office. One of his hall clerks fell gravely ill with consumption, and the court physicians could do nothing. The clerk came to me, saying, “I need your divine elixir.” I took a knife-tip’s measure and gave it to him; he recovered at once. Zixuan was astonished. The clerk explained how he had been saved by Fourth Gentleman Ju’s elixir, snatched from the very jaws of death. Zixuan sent men to summon me, but I refused to come. He then dispatched his retainers to coax the monk with lavish gifts and provisions. One day, the monk called on the Chancellor. Privately, he presented a portion of the elixir. Delighted, Zixuan escorted the monk down the steps. As the monk withdrew, he bowed at the horse-block, stumbled, and fell, breaking his leg on the spot. Carried back in a litter, he died within days.\n\nMaster Yin Hejing, styled Yanming, told his disciple Qi Kuan: “When Master Cheng Yi was traveling, he once rested late at an ancient temple. He prepared his bedding before the Buddha’s pedestal but had not yet lain down when he heard a faint rustling. Looking closely, he saw a rat in a small hole in the Buddha’s belly, holding a slip of paper in its mouth, trying to pull it out. Master Cheng rose to investigate. Inside the hole was a scroll. He took it and read it—a cinnabar formula. At its head were the words: *This is no common worldly art.* Master Cheng read it through once and grasped its meaning entirely. He copied a version, then returned the original scroll to the hole.\n\nLater, while living in the suburbs, he refined this elixir. The method required nurturing the fire for forty-nine days to complete. Around the thirtieth day, as night fell, people from the surrounding fields came to his dwelling, saying, ‘There is no fire left in our homes. We all see flames rising from here like this several times over. We fear it will alarm the villagers.’ Master Cheng then removed the elixir and tested it. He placed a grain of millet in a silver bowl, and wherever the elixir touched, it turned to gold. During the Chongning era, the bowl was still preserved, its gold forming thread-like circles where the elixir had adhered.\n\nThe half-formed elixir he sealed in his clothing chest. Because of its uncanny nature, he never spoke of it to others. Once, I took the opportunity to ask Master Cheng about it. He said, ‘This is an external elixir. If one’s internal elixir is complete and one’s inner power is firmly established, consuming this can prolong life. Transmuting the five metals is but a trifling matter.’ I asked, ‘Why not take it yourself?’ He replied, ‘This substance is not meant for such a belly. In my later years, I intended to pass this formula to a certain Daoist, but before I could transmit it, I passed away. A month later, the Daoist arrived—too late.’\n\nSu Ziyou’s *Longchuan Lüezhi* states: My elder brother Zizhan once served in Fufeng, where the Kaiyuan Temple held many ancient paintings. Zizhan was fond of painting and would often ride alone to the temple, spending the whole day tracing the murals. An old monk emerged and bowed, saying, ‘My humble abode is nearby. Might you honor me with a visit?’ Zizhan gladly followed. The monk said, ‘I am skilled in alchemical arts and possess a formula that can transmute cinnabar and pale gold into refined gold. I have long wished to pass it on but have found no worthy recipient. Knowing you are the one, I wished to meet you.’ Zizhan replied, ‘I have no interest in such arts. Even if I obtained the method, I would not practice it.’ The monk said, ‘This formula is known but must not be practiced. If you will not practice it, then I shall transmit it to you.’\n\nAt that time, Assistant Minister Chen Xiliang was the prefect of Fufeng. He was deeply obsessed with alchemy and had sought the formula from this monk, who refused to give it. Zizhan said, ‘Minister Chen sought it but did not receive it. I did not seek it, yet I have obtained it. Why?’ The monk replied, ‘I am not displeased with Minister Chen. It is because once he obtains the formula, he will not be able to refrain from practicing it. In the past, I have transmitted this method to others. Some died after practicing it, some suffered family misfortunes, and others lost their official positions. Thus, I dare not lightly pass it on.’ He then produced a scroll, saying, ‘This contains many famous formulas, including the one for transmuting gold. You will certainly not practice it lightly, but do not casually transmit it to others—especially not to men like Minister Chen. Beware!’\n\nZizhan promised and returned home to examine the formula. For every *liang* of pale gold, if the proportion was slightly deficient, he added a *qian* of cinnabar, mixed it with other ingredients, and placed it in a dry crucible. When melted and poured out, neither the gold nor the cinnabar was diminished; only their hues were unevenly mixed. Repeated smelting was required until the color became uniform.\n\nLater, he happened to see Minister Chen and mentioned the monk. Chen immediately replied, ‘I recently obtained his formula.’ Zizhan was surprised: ‘How did you come by it?’ Zizhan recounted the monk’s reluctance to transmit it lightly and refused to show the formula. Chen persisted until Zizhan, unable to refuse further, gave it to him. Chen examined it and found it genuine. Zizhan regretted, saying, ‘I do not regret parting with the formula; I regret betraying the monk’s trust. Be cautious in your practice.’ Chen casually agreed, saying, ‘Very well.’ Soon after, he was dismissed from office for accepting bribes while drunk on official business in a neighboring prefecture. Zizhan suspected it was due to his alchemical pursuits.\n\nLater, when Zizhan was demoted to Huangzhou, Chen’s son Zao was there. Zizhan asked, ‘Did your father ever practice that method?’ Zao replied, ‘After my father lost his position, he went to Luoyang with no means to buy a house. He then practiced this art extensively, but in the end, he died from an infected finger. The monk’s warning was not false.’\n\nOver a decade later, when Zizhan was demoted to Junzhou, there was a Sichuan monk named Yi Jie who served as a disciple of Chan Master Ke Wen. Wherever Ke Wen went, Yi Jie would undertake construction projects, spending vast sums without revealing the source of his funds or his methods. Yi Jie was close to Chan Master Xing Cong and secretly told him the formula, which was largely the same as that transmitted by the Kaiyuan monk of Fufeng. However, Yi Jie never used a single *qian* for personal gain, so he preserved the art without mishap.\n\nIt is further said: At the end of the Zhiping era, I was returning from Shaanxi to Sichuan and moored my boat at the foot of Xiandu Mountain. A Daoist showed me a stone inscription of the *Yinzhen Jun Dan Jue*. I asked him about the art of refining elixirs. He replied, ‘If one’s internal elixir is not complete and one lacks inner mastery, those who consume external elixirs often die. It is like piling dry grass and worn-out cotton and placing fire beneath—nothing will remain unburned.’\n\nOver a decade later, while serving in the Southern Capital, I visited the home of Zhang Andao. A Daoist there was nurturing a golden elixir. The method used purple-gold and cinnabar and required a full year to complete. Zhang told me, ‘The elixir is ready to be consumed.’ I asked, ‘How do you know it is complete?’ He replied, ‘The *Baopuzi* states: When the elixir is complete, if you grasp it in your hand, it will be like mud, oozing between your fingers. That is how you know the elixir is truly complete.’\n\nNow, my elixir is like this—by this I know it is complete.”\n\nI recounted to Zhang what I had heard at Mount Xiandu, saying, “I know that once my internal elixir is complete, this external elixir may be consumed. If it is not yet so, why not wait a while?” Zhang laughed and said, “Am I to wait?”\n\nWhen Master Dongpo was twenty-six and first took office in Qizhou, an extraordinary monk pressed upon him a method for transmuting gold. Once he had obtained the technique, he sealed it and later passed it to Master Yingbin. Yingbin likewise kept it hidden. When he later resided in Wuchang, a relative who knew of it inquired about the method. Yingbin said, “My late elder brother entrusted it to me, and I have guarded it for years. When I have leisure, I shall search for it among my belongings.” After some time, he summoned the inquirer and produced the book, saying, “Dongpo sealed it in Qizhou just as it was.” Yingbin then broke the seal and perused the text, asking, “Is this it?” The inquirer joyfully replied, “It is!” Yingbin immediately burned it in the furnace and said to him, “One may endure poverty, but how can one endure this?” The inquirer, ashamed and abashed, fled in disarray.\n\nMaster Cha of Gusu obtained the method for refining saltpeter. Zhang Shengong befriended him intimately, yet the method was not transmitted. Once, encountering an ailing monk, Cha took pity on him and used saltpeter to fashion a bowl, instructing him to boil water in it daily and drink from it. After a month, the monk’s illness was greatly alleviated. A visitor who had witnessed this asked the monk the reason, and the monk explained it was due to drinking the boiled water. The visitor, who had long known of Cha’s art, said, “This was made from refined saltpeter. Place mercury in the bowl and test it over fire.” When they did so, the mercury was indeed rendered inert. The monk, considering this a rare encounter, went to express his gratitude repeatedly and inquired about the bowl’s marvel. He then earnestly sought the method. Cha said, “The method is not easily transmitted, but the bowl you used earlier is nearly exhausted. Bring it to me, and I shall add more medicine to it for you.” The monk fetched the bowl and handed it to Cha, who then shattered it, melted it anew by the gate beside a great river, and waited until the saltpeter turned to liquid before using tongs to cast it into the water, saying, “I initially only wished to cure your illness, never expecting such insatiable greed.” The monk departed in remorse.\n\nThe Daoist Fang Ziming resided at Shousheng Temple in Ruizhou. Su Lun of Chengdu presented him with a poem that read:\n*Mercury becomes silver, tenfold the gain,*\n*Cinnabar turns to gold—none in the world compare.*\n*Yet this man hoards his art, refusing to impart,*\n*Sealing his door, tending his clay furnace, wary of heaven’s decree.*\n\nZiyou once practiced the art of *huangbai* alchemy. He prepared a tightly sealed chamber and placed a furnace within, ready to light the fire. Suddenly, he saw a large cat perched atop the furnace, urinating. Startled, he looked again, but the cat had vanished. Ziyou said, “The arts of divine immortals are bestowed by heaven to aid the impoverished. One must await the right person before transmitting them. Since this is not the one, I dare not proceed.”\n\nZhang Yifang had been compounding the returning elixir for years without success. Stricken by illness and near death, he lamented his failure to complete the ninefold cyclical refinement. He ordered his disciples to dismantle the elixir furnace. Beneath it, they found a massive serpent with fiery maw and brocade-like scales coiled within, as if a divine being guarding it. They took a pellet of the elixir and fed it to him, but he died, mute and speechless.\n\nDongpo’s poem reads:\n*In my twilight years, my eyesight still laments its decline,*\n*My many ailments and hoary hair weigh heavily upon me.*\n*Thus I write small characters by the bright window,*\n*And open a secluded chamber to nurture cinnabar.*\n\nHuang Luzhi annotated: According to a letter Master Dongpo wrote to Wang Dingguo, he had recently obtained a small amount of jujube cinnabar, its radiance most extraordinary. Though he dared not consume it, he was instructed to tend the fire and observe its transformations, merely to delight his spirit and pass the days.\n\nAnother poem by Dongpo reads:\n*In Caonan, Master Liu’s name rivals Zizheng’s,*\n*His household holds the* Hongbao *scriptures, yet he refrains from forging the steed’s hooves.*\n*Seated close, I inquire of the Way, but he guards it well,*\n*Unwilling to share even a knife-tip’s measure, lest he alone escape death.*\n*Would he truly withhold a scroll’s worth from one who climbs the ladder?*\n\nZhao Ciweng annotated: Was Master Liu perhaps Liu Yiweng? While in Meizhou, Master Dongpo wrote to Yiweng, saying, “If you have an external elixir already completed that might aid in printing, I hope you will not begrudge sharing some jujubes.” The letter is preserved in the *Piling Later Collection*. Zhao Yaogeng annotated: Liu Anshi, style Zizhi, was a *daizhi* from Caonan. He possessed the arts of longevity and elixir refinement, and Master Dongpo once studied under him.\n\nNear the slopes of Mount Bagong in Shouzhou, small gold cakes were often unearthed from the earth and streams. The world transmits that these were the alchemical gold of the Prince of Huainan, bearing seal impressions—hence called “seal gold.”\n\nIn the region of Fangyang, at the Whitewater lands of Chongling, gold in the shapes of unicorn hooves and swift steeds was frequently unearthed when digging. These were called “persimmon gold.” The smaller pieces, resembling unicorn hooves and swift steeds, were the alchemical gold made by Lou Jing. The *Book of Han* annotation also states that it differed from other gold.\n\nAlchemists say that Lou’s gold, when used in elixir refinement, is most excellent. Dongpo’s *Record of Things That Mutually Respond* includes in its “Herbs” section the grasses *zhu gang*, *zhu ci*, and others, which traveling guests often use for smelting. However, they do not know the proper method of boiling and refining.\n\nI once read in the seventy-eighth fascicle of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* of a medicinal liquid called *hezhajia*. If one obtains it and uses a tael to transform ten taels of copper, it becomes true gold. A monk once cited this to me, and I asked, “Do those who composed the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* know of this?” The monk smiled and left. I once rubbed a small amount of chalcanthite on a knife blade, and it turned to gold. Perhaps *hezhajia* refers to chalcanthite?\n\nIn the year *xinhai* of the Zhida era, during the casting of coinage, I was in Raozhou and witnessed a solution of vitriol water transmuting iron into copper. However, the vitriol in Raozhou comes from copper mines, hence it produces copper. The vitriol from Jinzhou comes from gold mines and must be capable of transmuting copper and iron into gold. This is what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* calls *hezhajia*—people today simply do not recognize it. The Buddha’s words are never false.\n\nCan tiles, stones, sand, and earth all be transformed into gold?\n\nFrom the *Chunzhu Jiven*, *Mengxi Bitan*, *Shuyi Zhi*, and *Sheshi Lu*, all mention tiles, stones, sand, and earth transforming into gold, while *Jiang Fei Lu* records ginger turning to gold, and *Qingyi Zhi* speaks of fern leaves becoming gold—yet these are not substances capable of transmutation. Moreover, the *Shangshu Gu Shi* notes bamboo-leaf gold, the *Kuiche Zhi* describes river-tea gold, the *Jianghuai Yiren Lu* tells of \"snow-clasped gold,\" the *Xuanshi Zhi* of \"urine gold,\" and the *Shuyi Zhi* of \"spittle silver.\" Do such things truly exist?\n\nThey are illusions—what is meant by \"illusion\"? Deception, monstrosity, falsehood, and absurdity. The *Mige Xiantan* speaks of \"iron-nail silver,\" the *Shenxian Ganyu Zhuan* of \"wrought-iron silver,\" the *Maoting Kehua* of \"copper-coin silver,\" and the *Kunshan Ji* of \"lead silver.\" As Shao Kangjie’s poem says: *\"Lead and tin, though guarded as gold, remain false.\"* I say: lead, tin, copper, and iron—all five metals—are indeed false in this sense, yet the principle of their transformation may hold truth. But tiles, stones, sand, and earth? Such things cannot transform. As for ginger, ferns, bamboo leaves, and river tea, if they cannot change, then no such principle exists. Even ginger and ferns retain some substance—what are snow, spittle, or urine? This is the height of absurdity.\n\nThe *Fangwai Zhi* by Zhuang Nianzu of Qingyuan states: A merchant from western Shu named Sun was transporting mercury to Chang’an. His porter stumbled on a plank bridge, striking a rock and breaking the pot. In haste, he stuffed the leak with grass from the roadside. By evening, when they reached an inn, the mercury in the pot had solidified. Sun realized it was the magical grass that had caused this and planned to gather more. He urged his servant to eat quickly, then drove the donkey back along the same path. As dusk fell, they crossed the bridge, but the donkey startled, lost its footing, and plunged into the Jialing River.\n\nHan Qinglao, in the *Nong He Yuan*, and He Yuan, in the *Chunzhu Jiven*, record that a monk named Fajian from Lin’an told of a Huizhou merchant traveling through the Qian Mountains who saw a bloated snake writhing in the grass. It slowly approached a certain plant, bit it open, and rubbed its belly against it. Soon, the swelling subsided, and the snake departed. The merchant thought this plant must be a remedy for swelling and poison, so he gathered some and placed it in his bag. That night, at an inn, he heard groaning from the next room. Upon inquiring, he learned the man suffered from abdominal distension. The merchant immediately brewed the grass into a decoction and gave it to him. Soon, the groaning ceased. By dawn, only the sound of dripping water could be heard. When he called out, there was no answer, so he rose to check—only to find the man’s flesh and blood had dissolved into water. He hastily grabbed his belongings and fled. The innkeeper, upon cleaning the pot to cook rice the next morning, found the entire vessel had turned to gold. He secretly buried the remains. After some time, when an amnesty was declared, the merchant returned to the inn and recounted the events to the innkeeper.\n\nGuo Yunyi’s *Jianghu Jiven* records that during the Jiatai era, a monk at Heshansi in Jizhou saw a snake struck and injured, its head and tail barely moving. Another snake coiled around it several times before departing. Soon after, the departing snake returned, holding a wild plant in its mouth, and covered the wound. Before long, the two snakes raised their heads and left together. Later, a young novice at the temple fell from a tree and broke his leg. The monk applied this plant to the wound, brewed a decoction to wash it, and had him rest in a quiet room. By morning, only bones remained—the flesh had completely rotted away. The pot used to boil the plant had turned to gold. The monk realized this herb could transmute iron into gold and kept its location secret. A local official, the prefect of Zhaozhou, heard of this and sent the monk lavish gifts, seeking the plant’s whereabouts. The monk refused to speak. The prefect then had the novice’s parents file a complaint, and the monk was imprisoned. A messenger told him, *\"If you do not reveal the plant, you will never leave.\"* The monk remained silent and died in prison. Though the prefect was cruel, the monk was also foolish.\n\nZhang Hua’s *Bowu Zhi* states: Liu De, while overseeing the imprisonment of the Prince of Huainan, obtained the *Hongbao Yuan* and *Mishu* from the prince’s pillow. He and his son Xiang both marveled at them, believing the alchemical arts of *huangbai* could succeed. Yet in the end, no proof emerged, and they were punished for this.\n\nThe *Taiping Guangji* records that at the end of the Sui dynasty, a Daoist lived on Mount Taibai, refining cinnabar to compound the Great Return Elixir. His attendant, Bi, served him for over a decade. Later, Bi left due to family mourning. The Daoist said, *\"You have been with me for so long, and now you face sorrow. I have nothing to give you, but here are ten elixir pills. One pill can transmute a jin of copper into gold—enough to arrange your funeral.\"* Bi returned home and did as instructed, using the gold to complete the rites. He then returned to the mountain to seek more elixir, but the Daoist refused. Bi drew his sword to threaten him but failed. He then tried to seize the Daoist’s hand, but still could not. Finally, he cut off the Daoist’s foot. The Daoist’s expression did not change. Enraged, Bi severed his head, then opened a red pouch at his right elbow—inside were elixir pills.\n\nBi took the elixir and transmuted much gold, but was reported for illicit alchemy. Emperor Taizong of Tang heard of this and summoned him to produce gold. Pleased, the emperor granted him a fifth-rank office. Bi made tens of thousands of jin of gold, but when the elixir was exhausted and his skill failed, he requested to leave. The emperor ordered him to record his method before departing. Bi pleaded, but the emperor, suspecting deceit, sent soldiers to detain him. Bi refused to disclose the method, so the soldiers cut off his hand. Still, he said nothing. They then cut off his foot. Bi recounted the whole story, but the emperor did not believe him and had him executed.\n\nHuang Xiufu of Jiangxia, in the *Maoting Kehua*, records that in the former Shu kingdom, there was a wine shop in Chengdu called *Liutiao*, named after its serving girl. She had been ill for over a year when a Daoist often came to drink on credit. The girl always served him attentively, so the Daoist left several elixir pills, saying they were to repay his debt. She took them as instructed and recovered her full health. Wang Daobin, a temple official from Jintang County in Han, learned of this and earnestly asked for the remaining medicine. He placed mercury in an iron pot, added the elixir, and heated it—soon, it turned to gold. He presented the elixir and gold to the King of Shu, who asked for the method. Wang replied, *\"There is a plant growing on Sanshue Mountain. I request to be appointed magistrate of Jintang to gather it.\"* The king granted his request. The next year, when the medicine failed to materialize, the king realized Wang had obtained the elixir from the girl and had him executed.\n\nPrefect Liu, named Chan, built a thatched hut on Mount Qingcheng. Some say he possessed the art of *huangbai*. One night, three men arrived with wine and fruit, seeking lodging. As they discussed alchemy, the conversation grew lively. One guest said, *\"We know you have the method of* huangbai*. Could you summarize it for us?\"* Liu initially refused, but the guests persisted. Finally, he grew angry: *\"If you must know tonight, I will tell you.\"* The guests said, *\"We sought you out as fellow Daoists, yet you press us so.\"* The three men rolled up their sleeves, glared, and said, *\"We are not gentlemen—we are thieves. If you do not reveal the method, we will harm you.\"* They drew their blades and threatened him. Liu and his wife, terrified, disclosed the method and gave them the remaining elixir. The three bowed and departed. At dawn, Liu descended the mountain and never returned. He later lived with the recluse Li Chen.\n\nThe Master of Empty Formlessness, Fǎkōng, was the youngest son of Academician Shěn of Zháchuān. Once, at Jiaoshan Monastery, he spoke with the monk Fǎquán about transmutation. Quán said, *\"I possess a method to transmute copper into gold.\"* He scooped several coins from his pouch and ordered an empty crucible to be heated. Through the night, the copper failed to melt into liquid. Kōng cried out and questioned him. Quán laughed, *\"Those who obtain this see it as mere river sand—how would they know it is truly copper?\"* He then took a small amount of white powder and cast it in. The sand began to melt, and when drawn out and examined by firelight, it was pure gold.\n\nKōng [or *thereupon*] pressed him with increasing courtesy, earnestly requesting the method. Quán said, *\"I do not begrudge the method, but I have a past vow that makes me fear it would incite greed in reckless men, leading to calamity and bringing no true benefit to others. Let me tell you: In my twentieth year, I had no home and traveled with two Daoist companions. Together, we studied the elixir furnace. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of Shaosheng (1094), we said to one another, *'Our learning has not taken us far. Now we should part and wander for ten years, then meet again on this day at this place. Whoever fails to arrive on that day without encumbrance will be deemed to have perished on the Dao.'* We raised our cups and made the pact. The three dispersed—one to the Chuan and Xia regions, another to the capital and Luoyang, while I remained in the Two Zhe provinces.\n\nWhen the appointed time came, we gathered at Fengle Bridge in succession. Each produced the formulas and secrets we had obtained, comparing them. One method, the *Máo* technique, was somewhat simpler. We tested it, but the copper’s color did not fully transform. Another said, *'In Chengdu’s medicinal market, I encountered a strange man who gave me a \"halo-removing\" powder. He claimed it was extraordinary, but I had not yet tested it.'* We took it and refined it together, and the color deepened to a richer yellow. Thinking the powder insufficient, we decided to refine it again. When removed, it was true gold.\n\nWe conferred and said, *'The gold shops of the Man people in the capital are the finest in the world. If we go to sell it, there will be no doubt of its authenticity—this is truly an immortal’s art.'* Arriving in the capital, we took ten taels to the market and received a high price. At the time, we lodged together in the eastern guest quarters of Xiangguo Monastery. We made a hundred taels of gold to part ways, then bought mutton, imperial wine, and feasted raucously while smelting copper. Unexpectedly, the copper slag splashed and ignited a fire that spread to the roof. All three of us were drunk—one so inebriated he could not escape and burned to death; another was arrested, flogged, and died days later. Only I, barely sober, broke through the flames and fled. Fearing pursuit, I, who had long been skilled at swimming, plunged into the Bian River and drifted downstream. Only after passing the city gates did I climb ashore. While still in the water, I repented and prayed to Heaven, vowing to become a monk and never practice alchemy again. If I encounter a great karmic matter that cannot be accomplished, I will petition Heaven for aid—I dare not use even a hair’s worth of my own power, much less transmit it to others.\"*\n\nKōng, having heard his account, dared not press further. One day, Quán left without a word, and his whereabouts became unknown.\n\nHan Zǐcāng, the Academician, recounted: *\"A Daoist on Mount Qingcheng sent his young servant to buy wine for a patron. Midway, the boy hung the iron bottle he was carrying on a tree. The bottle was heavy, the branch weak, and the wind swayed it so that the leaves and twigs rubbed against the spot where it touched—all turned golden. From then on, he recognized the tree that transmuted gold. He traveled the world and never lacked for anything. Later, he lodged at Tianqing Abbey in Huazhou, too old and ill to go out. He wished to transmit his method but found no suitable recipient. Secretly observing an old man who sold rice before the abbey—who, regardless of famine or plenty, charged an annual interest of one coin, and whose conduct was consistent—he thought him trustworthy. One day, he summoned the old man to a tavern and confided his desire to pass on the method. The old man said, *'I have long been capable of this.'*\n\nThe Daoist said, *'Come to me tomorrow, and we will test it together.'* At dawn, the old man arrived. They barred the door and refined the elixir together. A fellow Daoist in the next room overheard and bored a hole in the wall to watch. He saw the two men alternately heating the elixir and pouring it onto the ground, where it gleamed as brilliant gold. They took turns admiring it, exclaiming in wonder. The observer then broke through the wall and entered. The two, caught off guard, could not gather their materials in time. A clamor arose as they fought over the gold, and in the end, both were crushed to death. The other Daoists were all implicated and imprisoned.\"*\n\nHé Fǎng said: *\"Of those who discuss elixir furnaces—scholar-officials and recluses who study the Dao—seven or eight out of ten delight in seeking such methods. Yet they do not realize these are all immortal medicines, mere precursors to the elixir. After the Three Mao Lords used cinnabar powder to transmute silver into gold and iron into silver to relieve famine during a poor harvest in Danyang (when corpses lined the roads), later generations named the method of refining powder to transmute copper the 'Danyang Method,' and the method of using arsenic to transmute copper the 'Transmutation Mao.' Examples like Wang Yang and Lou Jing of the Han, Cheng Bi of the Tang, and Wang Jie of recent times prove that such methods exist in the world. But those who obtain them are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, and of those who practice them, eight or nine out of ten bring disaster upon themselves. The likes of Master Dongpo and Minister Yang Yuansu secretly received the formulas but, knowing the risks, did not practice them. Zhang Shen’gong and Huang Daofu, both high-ranking officials, spent their lives and fortunes seeking such methods but never encountered them.*\n\n*Xiahou Jiazhen, a Hanlin Academician, was fond of refining silver his entire life. He often said, *'If I could see even a single coin of mercury-silver, I would know how to draft imperial edicts for the rest of my days.'* Yet his wish was never fulfilled, and he died without success.*\n\n*During the Shaoxing era (1131–1162), a Daoist in the Huai frontier begged for alms, holding an iron ox and crying out, *'The Iron Ox Daoist is here!'* He wandered in Fuguang for months. One day, he entered a wealthy family’s treasury to beg for money. The master asked about the Iron Ox’s purpose. The Daoist replied, *'It can defecate gold nuggets.'* The master wished to exchange his wealth for it, but the Daoist refused. They finally agreed to rent it for one night, placing it in a secret chamber. The next morning, they opened the room to find several grains of gold nuggets. The Daoist arrived, took the Iron Ox, and left. The master, consumed by greed, sought out the Daoist to buy the ox. The Daoist resisted but eventually relented after much persuasion, agreeing to a price based on the daily yield of gold, to be paid over a year.\n\nAfter several days at home, the ox defecated gold as before. But afterward, it produced nothing. Examining the ox’s tail, they found a small hole but no other peculiarities. Suddenly, a maidservant in the household fell gravely ill. Her husband was summoned to ransom her. Tracing her whereabouts, they discovered the Daoist had secretly purchased the woman beforehand and hidden the gold in her possession. The gold nuggets had all been secretly placed by her. Once the scheme was complete, she was taken away. When pursued, the Daoist had already fled.\n\nFrom *Zhào Guànyuán’s Daily Records*:\n\n*Tattered hemp robes, a patched cloth skirt,*\n*Meeting people, he boasts of his silver-refining art.*\n*If you truly possess the silver-refining method,*\n*Why not refine silver to sustain yourself?*\n\nXú Qīng’s *Records of Worldly Experience* includes this verse as a warning to his youngest son: *\"Of the deluded who are misled by alchemists, beware—you must take heed.\"*\n\n*Volume Two of* **Idle Chatter at the Feast**",

      "translated_text": "The *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division*\n*Idle Chatter at the Banquet Table*\n*Daoist Category*\n*Abstract*\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: *Idle Chatter at the Banquet Table* in two fascicles was composed by Yu Yan of the Song dynasty. This work consists of his miscellaneous notes and discourses. Only the first several dozen entries in the upper fascicle pertain to the examination of names and objects, yet their arguments are often superficial and baseless. For instance, he claims that the common term for women, \"mama,\" derives from the *Kun* hexagram’s \"profit in the steadfastness of the mare\"; that the name *qisou* (vagabond) originates from *qusou* (canal-dredging); and that the term *fangli* (bedsteps) is taken from *ta yi deng chuang* (\"treading to ascend the bed\"). Many such assertions are forced and far-fetched, lacking credible evidence. The remainder of the text refutes the arts of Rong Cheng, discusses the theories of fetal gestation in *Chu’s Posthumous Writings*, and in the lower fascicle, thoroughly expounds upon alchemical scriptures, concluding with a warning against the pursuit of transmuting base metals into gold. Though these topics do not transcend Daoist concerns, within that tradition, his arguments alone approach correctness. This is likely because he first mastered Confucian principles and thus was not misled by the deceptive doctrines of fangshi.\n\nZhu Cunli’s *Miscellaneous Writings from the Loft Abode* contains two entries referencing this work. One states: \"Master Shijian’s commentary on the *Book of Changes* includes, apart from his *Yi* annotations, *Idle Chatter at the Banquet Table* and *Explanations of the Changes*, both of which were printed. This compilation is merely a handwritten copy preserved in his family. When Magistrate Lin Gong of Huangyan governed the prefecture, he took it away, and no duplicate remained in the family. To this day, Wu has lost its transmission.\" In the autumn of the *gengxu* year, while lodging at an inn, I conversed with Dong Ziwen of Haichang. He mentioned that his family once possessed this book but had since lost it. We then visited Zhu Qiuguan’s residence to borrow it, and fortunately, this work has thus returned to Wu.\n\nAnother entry in Zhu’s work cites *The Collected Works of the Yu Family*, stating: \"*Idle Chatter* originally comprised four fascicles, but now only two remain. The present edition is titled *Auxiliary Discourses*, though the pronunciation is similar, the characters differ, and the corruption must have a basis.\" Upon examining the *Yongle Encyclopedia*, we find that the title is sometimes rendered as *Auxiliary* and other times as *Idle*, with variations in the text. Given Zhu Cunli’s records, we know that these were originally alternate versions of the same work, not two distinct books.\n\nRespectfully submitted after collation in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.",

      "translated_text": "**Chief Compilers:**\n**Minister** Ji Yun\n**Minister** Lu Xixiong\n**Minister** Sun Shiyi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\n**Minister** Lu Feichi\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Four Treasuries*\n*Idle Chatter at the Banquet, Volume One*\nBy Yu Yan of the Yuan Dynasty\n\nShao Kangjie said: Animals derive life from the head, while plants derive life from the root. From the head comes life, so life resides in the head; from the root comes life, so life resides in the root. He also said: Flying creatures perch on trees and feed on wood, thus the feathers of eagles and hawks resemble wood. Running creatures dwell in grass and feed on grass, thus the fur of tigers and leopards resembles grass. Flying creatures delight in wind and excel in ascending; running creatures favor earth and thrive in descending. Those in water do not close their eyes, while those in wind and on land do. The upper eyelids of running creatures meet the lower, while the lower eyelids of flying creatures meet the upper—this is their natural disposition. Water creatures die when removed from water, and wind creatures die when submerged in water. Yet there are creatures that move between both: turtles, crabs, geese, and ducks.\n\nOxen, being docile creatures, move with the wind; horses, being vigorous creatures, advance against the wind. The *Book of Fei’s Admonitions* states: \"Horses and oxen follow the wind.\" The *Zuo Tradition* of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* says: \"The wind of horses and oxen does not reach each other,\" for when horses and oxen gallop, each follows its own wind. In the northern lands, a herd of horses is led by a single stallion with over ten mares, and the mares follow the stallion without joining other herds. The *Book of Changes*, in the hexagram *Kun*, says: \"It is advantageous for the mare’s virtue to be steadfast,\" referring precisely to this. Today, people call women \"mama,\" which carries the same meaning. Ants also do not join other colonies, hence they are called \"horse ants\" or \"dark colts.\"\n\n*The Trivial Record* states: Fish swim upstream, and birds stand facing the wind, aligning their scales and feathers with the flow. When a gentle breeze arises from an unknown direction, observe the birds’ orientation to determine it.\n\nLice are yin creatures with six legs, corresponding to the number of northern *Kan* water. They invariably move northward—this has been verified. I once saw a book stating this, but I have forgotten its title.\n\nThe *Rites of Zhou* records that the *Mountain Warden* fells yang wood in midwinter and yin wood in midsummer. Trees on the southern side of a mountain are yang, while those on the northern side are yin. Midwinter marks the southern solstice, and midsummer the northern solstice, both being where sunlight reaches. Thus, trees facing south will, when placed in water, float with their surfaces upward.\n\nThe liver corresponds to wood and should float, yet it sinks; the lungs correspond to metal and should sink, yet they float. Why? The liver is solid, while the lungs are hollow. Stones sink in water, yet the Southern Sea has mountains of floating stone; wood floats in water, yet the Southern Sea has sinking ebony—solidity and hollowness thus oppose each other.\n\nThe *Erya* states that for birds whose sexes cannot be distinguished, those with the left wing covering the right are male, and those with the right wing covering the left are female. Zhang Hua’s *Broad Survey of Things* also records this. Tao Hongjing said: Distinguishing the sexes of birds is difficult. The old method holds that if the left wing covers the right, it is male. Another way is to burn the feathers and place them in water—those that sink are male, and those that float are female.\n\nWei Boyang’s *Triplex Unity* states: \"At birth, males lie prone, and females lie supine.\" This is not merely evident at birth but also in death, as they imitate their original form at conception. The *Posthumous Writings of Master Chu* says: Yang qi gathers in the face, so men’s faces are heavier, and those who drown must lie prone. Yin qi gathers in the back, so women’s backs are heavier, and those who drown must lie supine. The same applies to drowned beasts.\n\nThe *Plain Questions* states: \"Ascent and descent, exit and entry—there is no vessel without them.\" The commentary explains: Walls, windows, doors, and apertures all face two directions, receiving and channeling qi that strikes against people—this is the qi of exit and entry.\n\nWhen objects are thrown into a well or pit, they descend slowly and flutteringly, hindered by ascending qi.",
      "overlap_context": "y Discourses*, though the pronunciation is similar, the characters differ, and the corruption must have a basis.\" Upon examining the *Yongle Encyclopedia*, we find that the title is sometimes rendered as *Auxiliary* and other times as *Idle*, with variations in the text. Given Zhu Cunli’s records, we know that these were originally alternate versions of the same work, not two distinct books.\n\nRespectfully submitted after collation in the tenth month of the forty-sixth year of the Qianlong reign.",

      "translated_text": "A hollow tube, when filled with water and sealed at the top, will not leak—this is because without ascending qi, descending cannot occur. An empty bottle with a small mouth, when suddenly inverted to pour, will not admit water—this is because qi cannot exit and thus cannot enter. Hence it is said: \"Ascent and descent, exit and entry—there is no vessel without them.\"\n\nIn my youth, a Daoist taught me: burn a piece of paper, quickly insert it into an empty bottle, and immediately invert the bottle into a silver basin of water—the water will surge into the bottle, and the silver basin will ring with a clear sound. This is the effect of the fire’s qi. Following the same method, place the bottle on a strongman’s abdomen, and it will not fall, just as a copper water clock: when its aperture is sealed, water does not drip, but when released, it drips. In the practice of self-cultivation, when the spirit is stored in the *niwan* (upper cinnabar field), the qi of the *dantian* (lower cinnabar field) ascends—where the spirit resides, qi follows and abides.\n\nIn the arts of the bedchamber, pressing the *weilu* (tailbone), inhaling qi, and swallowing saliva may yield some benefits, yet the essence remains unspent. To discern the hours and the alternation of yin and yang, observe the breath through the nostrils: during yang hours, the breath flows through the left nostril; during yin hours, through the right. At the cusp of *hai* and *zi* (11 p.m.–1 a.m.), both nostrils are unobstructed—what the alchemists call \"the jade cavern opening in duality.\"\n\nDo not eat the flesh of a horse that has died in pain, for it is lethal, especially the liver. Medical texts state: the horse is a fire creature, possessing a liver but no gallbladder; its wood organ is insufficient, so consuming its liver causes death. The *Records of the Grand Historian* recounts that when Duke Mu of Qin lost his horse, over three hundred villagers found and ate it. The officials sought to punish them, but the Duke said: \"A gentleman does not harm people for the sake of livestock. I have heard that eating horse meat without drinking wine harms the body.\" Thus, he gave them wine and pardoned them. Recently, I witnessed a villager, Ge Hengzhai, who suffered swelling after eating horse meat; he recovered by drinking boiled wine with salt. Thus, wine can indeed neutralize horse toxin.\n\nThe *Zuozhuan* states: \"When the state’s dogs go mad, none fail to bite.\" Du Yu’s commentary explains: *zhi* (瘈) means \"rabid.\" The *Book of Song* records that Zhang Shou, bitten by a rabid dog, ate minced frog and recovered. (The character *zhi* [猘] is pronounced *jū lì* or *zhēng liè*; it refers to a rabid dog.) Some say apricot kernels can also treat dog bites.\n\nThe *Nei Ze* states: \"Remove the intestines from a wolf, the emaciated parts from a leopard cat, the rump from a *zhi* (獦), the head from a fox, the brain from a piglet, the *yi* (乙) from a fish, and the *chou* (丑) from a soft-shelled turtle.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains that these parts are harmful to humans. The *Zuozhuan* recounts that the Marquis of Jin dreamed of the Viscount of Chu crouching over him and licking his brain. Zi Fan said: \"This is auspicious; I will soften him.\" Du Yu’s commentary notes: the brain is used to soften things—today, pig brain is used to soften leather. Once, a man ate an entire pig brain; within a year, his limbs weakened, and he could not leave his bed, becoming paralyzed. Thus, the *Nei Ze* and the *Zuozhuan* are not false.\n\nAs for the *yi* (乙) in fish, Zheng Xuan’s commentary states: the harmful part of a fish’s body is the *donghai rong* fish, which has a bone called *yi* near its eye, shaped like the character *yi* (乙). Eating it causes choking, and it cannot be removed. The *Erya* states: the fish’s \"pillow\" is called *ding*, its intestines are called *yi*, and its tail is called *bing*. I suggest that Zheng Xuan refers to the *yi* as a fish bone, while the *Erya* refers to it as the fish’s intestines—both liken it to the shape of the character *yi* (乙). However, if we infer from \"removing the intestines from a wolf,\" then the *yi* in fish is not the intestines but a bone.\n\nA Tang poem says: \"The cuckoo calls its name, / The Ba River flows like the character *ba*.\" This is because the river’s bends resemble the character *ba* (巴). Others say the frog’s shape resembles an earthworm, or that the fish bone resembles the character *yi*—all share this idea of resemblance. Lu Ji noted that ducks can speak and call their own names, but others say that animals like magpies, cats, and dogs can also call their names—why single out ducks and cuckoos?\n\nPhosphorescent fire is commonly called *guihuo* (ghost fire). The blood of soldiers or of cattle and horses is called *lin* (phosphorus). Fireflies are also called *lin*—their light resembles fire but is not fire. My family once had an old servant who did not believe in ghosts. When accompanying my late father to Wuxi’s Qingyang Port to collect rent, he saw countless *guihuo* flickering and approaching at night. The others fled in terror, but the old servant, drunk, rushed forward and struck at them—only to find they were wet leaves of *shi nan* (photinia).\n\nOnce, sitting by the water pavilion at night after rain, I saw a light in the grass. Upon picking it up, it was a wet shrimp shell. Ye Yuyan said that while in the Wutai Mountains, he saw wet pine bark glowing at night. He called his attendants to gather a cloth sack full, intending to send it to relatives and friends in the south as a rarity. After a few days, however, it had dried and no longer glowed—he laughed and discarded it.\n\nThe ancient *xiang* (offering) ritual is like today’s front banquet; the ancient *yan* (feast) ritual is like today’s rear banquet. Du Yu said: *Xiang* involves formalities—tables are set, but one does not lean on them; cups are filled, but not drunk; dishes are dried, but not eaten. *Yan*, however, involves sharing food from the same platter.\n\nThe ancient *suji* (plain accumulation) is today’s fine pleated cloth robe. Xunzi said: \"The *pi bian* (skin cap) and *suji*.\" Yang Liang’s commentary explains: *Suji* is a lower garment made of fifteen-*sheng* cloth, gathered at the waist—hence the name *suji*. One *sheng* equals eighty threads; fifteen *sheng* equals 1,200 threads—this is fine cloth.\n\nThe *Yue Ling* states: \"A scholar does not wear *zhi*.\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary explains: *Zhi* refers to woven silk. The *Shiwen* notes: *Zhi* is pronounced *zhi*, but today it is mispronounced as *zhu*, leading to silk being called *zhu si* (注丝). The sounds *zhi* and *zhu* are close. Some write it as *zhu si* (苎丝), which is a further corruption.\n\nIn the north, fine, soft wool is called *zirong* (子氄). *Zi* refers to the fineness of the wool; *rong* describes its softness. The *Book of Yao* states: \"Birds and beasts grow soft fur.\" Today, it is corrupted to *zirong* (紫茸).\n\nThe *Bin Feng* poem says: \"Without clothes, without *he*—how to pass the year?\" Zheng Xuan’s commentary states: *He* is coarse woolen cloth. The noble lack clothes; the poor lack *he*—how can they pass the year? I humbly note: Mencius said, \"To stab a ruler of ten thousand chariots is like stabbing a *he* man.\" Here, *he* contrasts with a ruler of ten thousand chariots, emphasizing the disparity between noble and base. *He* is a coarse, short garment made of woven *xi* (hemp), neither yellow nor black—it is the attire of the poor, not woolen cloth. The character *he* (褐) is written with the \"clothing\" radical, while *he* (毼) is written with the \"fur\" radical. Zheng Xuan mistakenly took *he* (褐) for *he* (毼), claiming *he* is woolen cloth. Woolen cloth, like today’s *xie he* (斜毼), is more expensive than ramie—how could it be the clothing of the poor?\n\nToday’s *mao* (氁) robe is the ancient *cui* (毳) garment. *Cui* describes the softness of fur, as in the poem: \"The fox fur is *fang rong* (防茸).\" The common term *mao* (氁) is a corruption of *cui* (毳), which itself was miswritten as *mao* (毛).\n\nThe alternate name for felt is *mao xi* (毛席); the alternate name for a blanket is *mao ru* (毛褥). Just as a bamboo hat is called a *zhu jin* (竹巾), the *Xiyu Zhuan* in the *Book of Later Han* calls felt *mao xi*. Zhang Heng’s *Four Sorrows* poem says: \"The beauty gifts me a *zhan qu* (毡氍).\" The *Fangyan* states: woven wool blankets are called *qu zhi* (氍氈); finer ones are called *ta zhi* (毾㲪). *Ta zhi* are placed before large beds or on small *ta* beds, used to step on when climbing into bed.",

      "translated_text": "The lacquerware known as *xipi* (犀皮) originates from the kingdom of *Xipi* (西毗), its name a corruption of the original. *Guijiang* (桂浆) comes from the kingdom of *Jijiang* (罽浆), similarly corrupted into its present form. Extending this logic, *quzhan* (氍氈) may well derive from *Quye* (渠拽), a kingdom whose name shares the same sound but differs in written form. *Xipi* (西毗) is likely a corruption of *Zhipi* (织皮), the name of another kingdom. The *Book of Yu Gong* records that *Quye* and *Zhipi* produced woven skins.\n\nThe *futou* (幞头) originated in the reign of Emperor Wu of Zhou, formed by wrapping the head with a *fujin* (幅巾), hence its name. The character *fu* (幞) is pronounced like *fu* (伏) and shares the same sound as the *fu* in *fubei* (幞被). Today, it is corrupted into *pu* (仆). Han Tuizhi’s *Yuanhe Shengde* poem states: \"With a red kerchief covering the head, bound with red silk\"—this is the modern *moe* (抹额). The *pashou* (帕首) and *futou* were originally the same object, now divided into two. Tang-dynasty *futou* were initially made of black gauze, but due to their softness, paulownia wood was later folded into a mountain shape and placed inside to stiffen them, called *jurongtou* (举容头). It was said to have originated with Yu Chao’en. The practice continued through the Five Dynasties, and in the Song, the material was changed to rattan, then to gauze, and later to lacquered gauze. Emperor Wu’s original design resembled today’s *jiejin* (结巾), with two corners left hanging, lacking any ties. Tang people added four bands, letting two corners hang in front and two behind. The Song further modified it by stiffening the two corners with iron wire to prevent whispering during court audiences.\n\nModern *liangzichou* (凉缁巾) use bamboo strips as a frame, shaped like a *liangmao* (凉帽) and covered with black gauze, making them easy to remove and wear—a most convenient summer accessory. This demonstrates how the design of the *futou* has evolved over time, its forms differing so greatly between ancient and modern eras.\n\nI once observed official courtesans performing the *Zhezhi* dance, wearing a red object on their heads, long in body and pointed at the top, resembling the shape of a boot. I suspect this was the precursor to today’s *gugu* (罟姑). The *Suilu* records that the *Zhezhi* dance originated from the name of the Tuoba clan of Later Wei, with *tuo* (拓) corrupted into *zhe* (柘) and *ba* (拔) into *zhi* (枝).\n\nThe *pipa* (琵琶) is also called *pippo* (鼙婆). In Tang poetry, the character *pa* (琶) was written with the *ru* (入) phonetic. The *Bi* (弼) in Wang Zhaojun’s *pipa* (琵琶) was originally *huai* (懐), later corrupted into *sì* (肆). The Hu people later modified its shape to be smaller. Wang Zhaojun laughed, saying, \"It hardly resembles the original.\" Today, it is further corrupted into *húbōsì* (胡拨四).\n\nThe characters *bili* (觱栗) appear in the *Bin Feng* of the *Book of Songs*, where *bi* (觱) is written as *bi* (毕). Zhu Xi remarked that the *bili* was originally called *beili* (悲栗), as its sound was deep and resonant. The pronunciations *bei* (悲), *bi* (觱), and *bi* (毕) are all related.\n\nZhang Heng’s *Four Sorrows* poem states: \"The beauty gifts me a *jin cuo dao* (金错刀).\" The ancient *cuo* (错) is the modern *cuo* (磋), pronounced *qiān gè* (千个反). Northerners pronounce *cuo* in the departing tone, while southerners use the entering tone, though they are essentially the same.\n\nThe character *mei* (眉) in *Xunzi* is written as *mi* (麋). Yang Liang’s annotation notes that *mi* (麋) is the same as *mei* (眉). The character *zi* (髭) in *zixu* (髭须) is also written as *zi* (兹). *Xunzi* states: \"The dragon’s *zi* (兹).\" Liu Xiang’s *Lienü Zhuan* writes it as *long shu* (龙疏). Yang Liang explains that *zi* (兹) is the same as *zi* (髭), and another variant is *xu longzi* (须龙兹), meaning *longshu* (龙疏), as *shu* (疏) and *xu* (须) are phonetically similar.\n\nThe *Jiao Te Sheng* states: \"The comfort of *guan* mats and *dian* mats, and the esteem for *puyue* (蒲越) and *gaojie* (稿秸).\" The *Zuozhuan* records: \"The grand carriage’s *yue* mat.\" The *yue* in *yuehu* (越户) is pronounced *kuo* (括反). Today, the *puhe* (蒲合) sold in Hangzhou markets is the *yue* (越), with *yue* corrupted into *he* (合) in sound.\n\nThe *fushuiche* (柫水车) is the *fu* (柫). Yang Liang mistook it for a *jiapa* (连枷), but the *jiapa* is a tool for threshing rice, not the *fu*. Ancient water conduits were made of wood for channeling water—this is the modern *chengluo* (承落).\n\nCui Bao’s *Gu Jin Zhu* records: \"The imperial moat of Chang’an is called *Yang Gou* (杨沟), as tall poplars were planted along it.\" It also states: \"*Yang Gou* (羊沟) refers to moats dug to prevent sheep from butting against walls.\" I believe that today, water channels hidden within courtyards are called *yin gou* (阴沟), while those visible outside are called *yang gou* (阳沟).\n\nThe people of Wu refer to stacked firewood as *chai ji* (柴积), pronounced *jì* (祭). This is the *wei ji* (委积) of the *Zhou Li*’s *Tianguan*, where Zheng Xuan explains that *wei ji* refers to stored grain, firewood, and fodder. The *Shiwen* glosses *ji* (积) as *zǐ cì* (子赐反). Today, it is corrupted into *jì* (祭), and *wei ji* (委积), meaning \"to store,\" is now written as *jì liú* (祭留).\n\nThe *Book of Rites* states: \"Heaven has no second sun,\" and Mencius echoes: \"Heaven has no two suns.\" Yet the *Zuozhuan* records: \"Heaven has ten suns,\" referring to the ten heavenly stems from *jia* (甲) to *gui* (癸). The *Liezi* claims that in Yao’s time, ten suns appeared simultaneously, and the *Zhuangzi* and *Huainanzi* further embellish this tale. Though these are allegories, are they not excessive? Some argue that there are historical records of two suns appearing and battling. I disagree. In the sixth year of Qianfu during the Tang, in the eleventh month, two suns appeared and fought. This must have been an illusion caused by the sun’s reflection in water at sunrise, its ripples creating the appearance of two suns clashing. How could there truly be two suns in the sky?\n\nThe twenty-eight constellations include *Fang* (房), where the sun is likened to a rabbit, and *Bi* (毕), where the moon is likened to a crow. The *Dan Shu* states: \"The sun crow, the moon rabbit,\" referring to the conjunction of the sun and moon.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* takes *li* (离) as the sun, yang containing yin, and *kan* (坎) as the moon, yin containing yang. Zhang Zai remarked that the essence of yin and yang mutually resides within each other—this is correct. The rabbit has four feet, which Han-dynasty scholar Zhang Heng considered yin, its number even. The crow has three claws, yang’s number being odd. I believe the rabbit belongs to the sun, and the so-called \"moon rabbit\" is merely the sunlight within the moon.\n\nAlchemists use this as a metaphor for the spirit entering qi, like sunlight illuminating the moon, hence placing the rabbit in the moon as a symbolic model. Their texts state: \"The moon is the medicine.\" The common belief that there is a rabbit in the moon pounding medicine is entirely baseless. When observing a person walking on a mountain from several hundred paces away, they appear as small as an ant. Beyond tens of li, even the mountain vanishes—how could one see a rabbit in the moon, which is tens of thousands of li away? If there truly were something visible in the moon, how large or small would this rabbit be?\n\nZhang Heng claimed that Yi requested the elixir of immortality from the Queen Mother of the West, and his wife, Heng’e, stole it and fled to the moon, becoming a toad. Liu Zhao greatly praised Zhang Heng’s astronomical insights, yet his account of Heng’e and the toad seems to perpetuate earlier errors.\n\nThe *Jin Shu* records that Xi and He observed the sun, Chang Yi observed the moon, and Qu Che observed the stars. The character *yi* (仪) is pronounced *é* (蛾). Today, the moon’s woman is called Chang’e, and the sun and moon are further named Xi and E—this is a grave error. The notion of a Chang’e in the moon is false, and the idea of a \"Palace of Broad Cold and Pure Emptiness\" is even more absurd. The tales of toads, rabbits, and osmanthus trees in the moon are all fabrications, yet such myths already existed in the Warring States period. The *Chu Ci* states: \"What virtue does the moon possess, that it dies and is reborn? What benefit does it seek, that the rabbit resides within?\" Zhu Xi notes that *tu* (菟) is the same as *tu* (兔). The common belief in osmanthus trees and toad light has persisted for so long.\n\nSome suggest that the sun and moon in the sky are like two mirrors reflecting each other, with the earth between them. Thus, the dark patches on the moon are merely the shadows of the earth in the mirror, vaguely resembling shapes but not actual objects. This explanation is reasonable and sufficient to dispel millennia of confusion.",

Zhang Heng’s *Four Sorrows* poem says: \"The beauty gifts me a *zhan qu* (毡氍).\" The *Fangyan* states: woven wool blankets are called *qu zhi* (氍氈); finer ones are called *ta zhi* (毾㲪). *Ta zhi* are placed before large beds or on small *ta* beds, used to step on when climbing into bed.",

      "translated_text": "The Yellow River emerges from the earth atop Kunlun Mountain, flowing eastward to Qishi. Thus, when Yu of Xia dredged the river, he guided it to Qishi—yet the Celestial River remains in the heavens, revolving with the sky’s motion, its position shifting day and night. How could it connect with the Yellow River? Yet Li Taibai wrote, *\"The waters of the Yellow River come from heaven above,\"* for he took Kunlun Mountain to be part of the heavens. The Celestial River and the sea differ as vastly as sky and earth—how could one reach it by raft? Zhang Hua’s *Records of Broad Learning* tells of riding a raft into the Celestial River to meet the Cowherd and Weaving Maiden stars—clearly a fabrication.\n\n*Liezi* states that Nüwa smelted five-colored stones to mend the heavens, but Confucians mock this as absurd. The sky has never been broken—even if it were, how could smelting stones repair it? Moreover, the celestial body revolves ceaselessly; where could one even begin? Their mockery is justified. Yet they fail to realize that the five-colored stones symbolize the *qi* of the five viscera. The art of nourishing life teaches that by concentrating the spirit and turning the gaze inward, the *qi* of the five viscera gathers in the *dantian*, steaming upward from the *dantian* to the brain. The brain is Kunlun, the uppermost part, symbolizing heaven. \"Mending the heavens\" is what the *Huangting Jing* calls \"filling the brain\"—or, as the saying goes, *\"If you wish not to die, cultivate Kunlun.\"* At Caishi in Jiangdong, the common folk spread the tale that Nüwa mended the heavens and smelted five-colored stones there, hence the name \"Caishi\" (\"Picking Stones\"). The error compounds itself.\n\nNüwa succeeded Fuxi as ruler of the world. Later generations regarded Nüwa as an ancient sage-woman, claiming she was Fuxi’s younger sister and Zhuanxu’s mother—how could this be true? Moreover, her clan name, Nüwa, resembles the state name Nüzhen (Jurchen). Consider the *Zuozhuan*, which speaks of Nü Ai; *Zhuangzi*, of Yu Nü; and *Mencius*, of Feng Fu—were they all truly women? The *Book of Documents* states, *\"August Heaven and Earth.\"* *Huang* (august) means great, while *hou* (empress) is interchangeable with *hou* (thick). The ancient script did not distinguish between them. The Temple of Empress Earth in Yangzhou depicts her as a woman—this is erroneous. The *Monthly Ordinances* says, *\"Its spirit is Houtu,\"* with the commentary explaining that Houtu was a descendant of Emperor Zhuan. The *Rites of Sacrifice* states, *\"Gonggong ruled the Nine Provinces, and his son, Houtu, was able to pacify them, so he was worshipped as the spirit of the soil.\"* The *Zuozhuan* records, *\"Gonggong had a son named Goulong, who became Houtu.\"* How could this be a woman? In antiquity, the Son of Heaven was called the *yuanhou* (prime lord), while the feudal lords were called *qunhou* (many lords). If Houtu were a woman, would Hou Ji and Hou Fang also be women?\n\nZhu Xi remarked, *\"Nowadays, when sacrificing to the spirits of heaven, earth, mountains, and rivers, people carve images to worship—this is utterly devoid of principle.\"* I observe that in the *Treatise on Sacrifices* of the *History of the Western Han*, heaven and earth were worshipped together, both facing south, sharing the same mat and sacrificial animals. Emperor Gao and Empress Lü were paired as offerings on the altar, both facing west, also sharing a mat and sacrificial animals—this was to embody the principle of *qian* (Heaven, the father) and *kun* (Earth, the mother). At that time, no images were made, nor were separate positions established. As for the spirits of mountains and rivers, which are inherently formless, now the spirit of Mount Tai is depicted as an emperor, and the Empress Earth is given a wife and concubines—who knows from which families he took his wife or purchased his concubines?\n\nIn commanderies, there are temples to the Earth God called *Chenghuang* (City God) Temples, for they lie beneath the city walls. In ancient times, earth was dug to build walls, and the ground beneath was called *huang* (moat) if dry, or *chi* (pool) if filled with water. The *Book of Changes* says, *\"The city walls fall back into the moat,\"* meaning that when *Tai*’s top line reaches its extreme, it must revert, just as a collapsed city’s earth refills the moat. But counties without city walls also call their Earth God temples *Chenghuang* Temples—why?\n\nThe *Lüshi Chunqiu* records that Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, *\"Is it true that Kui had only one foot?\"* Confucius replied, *\"To tune the six pitch-pipes and harmonize the eight sounds, one man is sufficient.\"* I believe Duke Ai’s question took *Kui* to be a one-legged *gui* (demon). Some claim the Yellow Emperor had four eyes, or that Yao had eight eyebrows—these are groundless rumors, distortions from hearsay and street gossip. The *Biography of Cao Bao* in the *History of the Eastern Han* records Emperor Zhang saying to Ban Gu, *\"Yao composed the *Dazhang*—one Kui was enough.\"* This must have been an ancient saying, echoing Confucius’ response to Duke Ai. Kui was the official in charge of music during Shun’s reign, teaching the young. Duke Ai mistook *kui* (the name) for *gui* (a one-legged demon)—what a grievous injustice! The one-legged demon is the *shanxiao*, depicted in the Daoist *Yanluozi Tu* as having only one leg, hence the Tang poem: *\"The mountain demon leaps nimbly on its single foot.\"* How could Kui be such a creature?\n\nThe *Kong Congzi* speaks of *\"the strange creatures of earth and stone: Kui and Wangliang.\"* The *Discourses of the States* mentions *\"the strange creatures of wood and stone: Kui and Wangliang.\"* There was never any talk of a one-footed creature. Yet *Zhuangzi* says, *\"Kui had only one foot, and his gait was swift.\"* The commentary explains that Kui was a one-footed beast like an ox, hornless, with a voice like thunder. The Yellow Emperor killed it and stretched its hide over a drum, whose sound carried five hundred *li*—how absurd!\n\nAmong the southwestern barbarians of the Eastern Han, there was a kingdom said to descend from Panhu of the Yellow Emperor’s time. The tale of Panhu is bizarre and laughable—it defies all reason. Such impossibilities should only be discussed with those who clearly perceive principle; there is no need to argue with the ignorant or the young. Generally, those who spin strange tales attribute them to the Yellow Emperor’s era. The credulous believe them, but the discerning reject them.\n\nMount Dagu resembles a single shoe, while Mount Xiaogu resembles a stick of incense. Opposite them lies Penglang Shoal. Now, Xiaogu is called Xiaogu (Little Maiden), and Penglang (Peng the Youth) is said to be her husband, Peng, who married the Little Maiden. Travelers on the river pay their respects at their temple.\n\nIn Wenzhou, there is a temple to the Earth God called *Du Shiyi* (Du the Concubine), who has no husband, and *Wu Cuoxu Xianggong* (Lord Five-Tufts-of-Beard), who has no wife. The locals bring Du Shiyi to pair with Lord Five-Tufts-of-Beard, merging them into one temple. Who is Du Shiyi? She is Du Fu the Pick-Up-Leftovers. Who is Lord Five-Tufts-of-Beard? He is Wu Zixu. If Du Fu’s spirit still lingers, he must laugh at Zixu, saying, *\"You still have the title of Lord, while I am made a concubine—have they not emasculated me?\"*\n\nRecently, Li Yu, the Surveillance Commissioner, mentioned that north of Jiangling there is a station called *Fengjia*. At first, I did not understand what *Fengjia* meant. Upon asking the elders, I learned it was the residence of Lord Chunshen. *Chun* (Spring) was corrupted to *Feng* (Offer), and *Shen* (Shen) to *Jia* (Armor).\n\nSomeone from the Central Plains told me that in the north, there is a Temple of the Ox King, where a hundred oxen are painted on the walls, with the Ox King at their center. When asked who the Ox King was, they said it was Ran Boniu. Alas! Ran Boniu has become the Ox King.",

      "translated_text": "Zhenwu was originally Xuanwu; during the Song dynasty, to avoid the imperial ancestor’s taboo, *xuan* (mysterious) was altered to *zhen* (true). Now, Xuanwu refers to the seven lunar lodgings of *Dou*, *Niu*, *Nü*, *Xu*, *Wei*, *Shi*, and *Bi*, which occupy the northern quadrant and belong to the Water element. In Jiangnan, households worship this constellation to suppress fire disasters. It is akin to Emperor Wu of Han adorning the *Bailiang* Hall with *chiwei*—the *chi* being a sea vessel, the essence of Water. Since Water can overcome Fire, such images were installed. Another example is the Yellow Tower in Xuzhou, its yellow earthen hue symbolizing Earth’s power to conquer Water.\n\nZhu Xi remarked that Zhenwu is not some divine figure with unbound hair; rather, it is merely Xuanwu. The so-called Azure Dragon, Vermilion Bird, White Tiger, and Xuanwu are not four separate creatures. The Horn Star forms the horn, the Heart Star the heart, and the Tail Star the tail—thus the Azure Dragon. The stars *Xu* and *Wei* resemble the *xuan* (a mythical snake) and *tengshe* (flying serpent), positioned beneath *Xu*, hence Xuanwu. During the reign of Emperor Zhenzong, the taboo on *xuan* led to its replacement with *zhen*. The *Can* stars have four legs like a tiger, hence the White Tiger. The *Yi* stars resemble wings, the *Zhen* stars a throat pouch, and the *Jing* stars a crown—thus the Vermilion Bird. Lu Tong’s poem speaks of \"wearing a *jing* crown,\" and Yang Xiong’s reference to \"dragon, tiger, crow, and *xuan*\" aligns precisely with this. Xuanwu is but another name for the *xuan*, a creature of the Water tribe. Water governs the North, its color black, hence *xuan*. The tortoise, armored and defensive, is called *wu* (martial). In truth, it is merely a tortoise. The seven northern lodgings form a tortoise shape, with the *Tengshe* star beneath it—a Fire element. Daoist alchemists borrowed this imagery to represent the interplay of Water and Fire within the body, depicting it as a tortoise and serpent entwined. The world, unaware of its origin, took Xuanwu to be two creatures: tortoise and serpent.\n\nJia Sidao once hosted a banquet where a guest refused to eat turtle. When asked why, the guest replied, \"I worship Zhenwu.\" Jia retorted, \"Zhenwu’s tortoise cannot be made into turtle!\" Failing to distinguish between tortoise and turtle, how could he govern the people? The guest, seeking an appointment as prefect, was denied the post. Another guest jested, \"Eels, loaches, and eels are inedible—they resemble Zhenwu’s serpent! Sugarcane and bamboo shoots are also forbidden—they resemble Zhenwu’s banner poles!\" The entire assembly laughed, and Jia joined in.\n\nHan Yu’s linked verse with Xuanyuan Miying and the stone tripod reads: *\"At times from the earthworm’s holes, cries like flies resound.\"* Later generations misinterpreted this as *\"The tea tripod’s voice hums like earthworms; incense coils like fireflies.\"* Though artful, the earthworm has no voice—this stems from a misreading of Han’s poem. Han meant the boiling water in the tripod sounded like flies, not earthworms. The \"earthworm’s holes\" refer to the tripod’s apertures, akin to earthworms’ burrows in mud. Cui Bao’s *Records of Past and Present* states that the earthworm, also called *qushan*, is skilled at singing underground, and the people of Jiangdong call it the \"singing maiden\"—a mistake. According to the *Monthly Ordinances*, when the mole cricket chirps, the earthworm emerges. The chirping creature is the mole cricket, not the earthworm. The people of Wu call the mole cricket *lougu*, hence the saying: *\"When the mole cricket calls, the intestines twist; only then does the earthworm earn its song.\"* Zhu Xi noted that taking Xuanwu as a true sage and depicting a tortoise and serpent beneath it lacks rationale. Adding Tianpeng, Tianyou, and Yisheng as the Four Saints is equally baseless.\n\nPhysicians say the liver, belonging to the East and Wood, stores the *hun*, while the lungs, belonging to the West and Metal, store the *po*. Daoists speak of \"three *hun* and seven *po*,\" but do the *hun* truly number three, or the *po* seven? No. The Nine Palaces’ numerology places three on the left and seven on the right. Bai Yuchan’s theory of \"three dragons and four tigers\" follows the same logic, as the *Tai Xuan* associates three with Wood and four with Metal.\n\nSu Ziyou remarked: \"Ancient texts state the left kidney’s *fu* is the bladder, and the right *mingmen*’s *fu* is the *sanjiao*. In men, it stores essence; in women, it connects the womb. Logically, the *sanjiao* should resemble the bladder—visible and tangible. Yet Wang Shuhe claimed the *sanjiao* has a name but no form. Is this not erroneous?\" Zeng Huchen countered: \"According to the *Baihu Tong*’s *Nature and Emotions* chapter, the upper *jiao* resembles a mist, the middle *jiao* a foam, and the lower *jiao* a ditch. By this, the *sanjiao* has form.\" Did Wang Shuhe fail to examine this, or did Su Ziyou momentarily forget? I believe what I heard from a *yu* practitioner: the *sanjiao* is the Yellow Court. Daoist alchemical texts describe the heart’s Fire and kidney’s Water gathering here for intense refinement, hence *sanjiao*—*jiao* meaning the martial Fire. Shen Cunzhong also said the Yellow Court has a name but no form, aligning with Wang Shuhe. Yet neither realized the Yellow Court is the *sanjiao*, nor that Wang’s claim of the *sanjiao*’s formlessness contradicts Zeng’s assertion of its tangibility. Following the *Baihu Tong*’s division into upper, middle, and lower *jiao* is also incorrect.\n\nDaoist texts state that among the eight extraordinary vessels, only the *Ren* and *Du* channels are the seas of the body’s Yin and Yang, the pivot of the Five Qi’s origin. The *Ren* channel begins below the *Zhongji* point, ascends through the pubic hair, follows the abdomen’s interior to *Guanyuan*, and reaches the throat—it is the sea of Yin channels. The *Du* channel starts at the *Xiaji* point, runs along the spine to *Fengfu*, enters the brain, ascends to the crown, follows the forehead to the nose—it is the sea of Yang channels. The *Yunlü* (cloud-trailing) tortoise, living five hundred years, masters the *Du* channel. The *xuan*’s longevity follows the same principle, as it masters the *Ren* channel through breath-holding and qi storage. One who masters both channels traverses the *Weilü*, connects the *Niuwan*, and harmonizes the hundred vessels. The *Huangting Jing* states: *\"All reside within the heart, revolving the Heavenly Path. Day and night, preserve it to attain longevity.\"* The Heavenly Path is the Yellow Path, the sun and moon’s route. In the human body, it is the *Ren* and *Du* channels, the path of breath’s ebb and flow.\n\nI once had a son who neither cried nor nursed and died after three days, the illness unknown. Later, reading medical texts like the *Baosheng Fang* and *Sanyin Fang*, I learned that infants who neither cry nor nurse at birth often suffer from wind entering the umbilical cord during severance. The wind ascends through the chest and throat to the lower gums, forming a yellow millet-like sore, causing unbearable pain—hence the silence and refusal to nurse. Scratching it with a fingernail releases yellow pus, after which the child cries and nurses. I taught this method to others, saving several infants. The *Suwen*, *Nanjing*, and *Jia Yi Jing* all state: *\"The *Ren* channel begins below *Zhongji*, ascends through the pubic hair, follows the abdomen’s interior to *Guanyuan*, and reaches the throat.\"* Zhu Gong’s *Inner and Outer Two Sceneries Diagram* notes that the gap between the upper and lower teeth, the *Yinjiao* point, is the intersection of the *Ren* and *Du* channels. Thus, newborns’ failure to cry or nurse stems from wind entering the *Ren* channel.",

Upon asking the elders, I learned it was the residence of Lord Chunshen. *Chun* (Spring) was corrupted to *Feng* (Offer), and *Shen* (Shen) to *Jia* (Armor).\n\nSomeone from the Central Plains told me that in the north, there is a Temple of the Ox King, where a hundred oxen are painted on the walls, with the Ox King at their center. When asked who the Ox King was, they said it was Ran Boniu. Alas! Ran Boniu has become the Ox King.",

      "translated_text": "A man of Wu surname from a wineshop in Mudu suffered from uncontrollable seminal emission, unresponsive to all medicines. I taught him a most simple technique: retract the flanks and abdomen, draw in the coccyx, close the orifices, shut the eyes tightly, and lower the head as if bearing a stone. Then draw qi straight from behind the back into the *Niwan* palace, swallow it, and send it down to the *Dantian*. Whether practiced for many or few repetitions, whether walking, sitting, lying, or standing, he was to perform this. I also instructed him to take the *Baozhen* pill, but he never consumed it, relying solely on this technique. Within half a year, I saw him again—his illness was cured, and his complexion bloomed like a peach. This method can also treat head-wind.\n\nDaoist side teachings include the technique of \"nasal inhalation and oral exhalation,\" claiming it prevents leakage. But if one exhales, how can there be no leakage? Initially skeptical, I tested it and found it effective. This technique can also cure nocturnal emission.\n\nThe world transmits the \"Three Peaks\" sexual arts under the names of the Yellow Emperor’s *Su Nu Jing* and *Xuannü Jing*, asserting that Rongcheng Gong and Peng Zu attained longevity through these methods. Many scholar-officials, deluded by this, have lost their lives—how lamentable! Ge Hong compared it to placing ice in a basin of boiling water or wrapping fire in feathers, or likened it to licking a blade’s edge or probing a tiger’s den—is this not perilous?\n\nThe *Beimeng Suoyan* records that the Tang dynasty Chancellor Xiahou Zi obtained Peng Zu’s techniques and became infatuated with a courtesan. Unable to satisfy her demands, he suffered seminal leakage and died. My maternal grandfather, Lüqiu Gong, served as *Dali Ping Shi* and learned this technique. His cheeks remained peach-like into his seventies, yet he ultimately perished from it, no different from Xiahou Zi. Daoist alchemists describe it as \"the barrel’s bottom falling out\": in middle age, when essence and vigor are robust, one can absorb, retract, and secure them, but in later years, when essence and vigor decline, one can no longer do so—thus, a single night exhausts them entirely.\n\nThe *Yijian Zhi* records that the Daoist Wu harmed the wife of a county clerk, only to be killed by the clerk in retaliation. Though Wu’s death scarcely repaid the lives of dozens of women, the clerk was also skilled in these arts, having once harmed others’ wives. His own wife narrowly escaped Wu’s predation, saved by the *Yanggao* decoction—fortunate indeed.\n\nDu Anren of Jiuhua Mountain’s *Nine Chapters on Precelestial Learning of Nature and Destiny* expounds at length with clarity. Some say this book was presented to the Gaozong Emperor. Upon reading its memorial, I found it stated: *\"Those who overindulge in mutual exchange will surely succor decline, aligning with the great *Guo* hexagram’s path of withered willows sprouting branches.\"* This is unmistakably bedroom arts, using the *Yijing* to embellish its methods—far from the Dao of purity and non-action.\n\nFushanzi’s commentary on the *Yinfu Jing*, equating \"mysterious devices\" with \"unused virgins,\" is a gross distortion of the Dao. His annotations to the *Cantong Qi* are forced and contrived—he is truly Wei Boyang’s nemesis. When Zhen Xishan wrote the preface to this book, Confucians, taking it for heterodoxy, no longer scrutinized its methods and were thus deceived.\n\nSanguzi’s *One Hundred Questions on the Golden Elixir* asks in its thirty-eighth question: *\"How are male and female determined at birth?\"* The answer: *\"If the man is aroused first and the woman responds afterward, a boy is conceived. If the woman is aroused first and the man responds afterward, a girl is conceived. When spirit and qi harmonize, essence is complete, and a child of upright appearance and blessed longevity is born. If the spirit is harmed, qi is exhausted, and essence is deficient, a child of monstrous form and meager fate is born.\"* Sanguzi, surnamed Qiu, named Shan, styled Andao, was a native of Nancheng in Jiangyou. Sangu was the name of his residence. In the early Qiandao era, he encountered an elder from Jinhua who transmitted the golden elixir’s arts, prompting him to write this book.\n\nChu Huagu of Yunjian’s *Qu Yi Fang* states: *\"Opening qi produces boys; closing qi produces girls. One opening and one closing determine male and female.\"* Li Yuxi of Yichun, in his commentary on the *Yuhuang Xinyin Jing*, writes: *\"Men and women receive the same endowment; it is only the sequence of arousal that distinguishes yin and yang.\"*\n\nThe *Chushi Yishu* states: *\"If yin blood arrives first and yang essence follows, the blood opens to envelop the essence, which enters to form bones—thus a boy is formed. If yang essence arrives first and yin blood follows, the essence opens to envelop the blood, which enters to reside in its root—thus a girl is formed.\"* Shi Jianwu’s *Zhong Lü Chuandao Ji* states: *\"If the father’s essence enters first and the mother’s blood follows, the blood envelops the essence to form a girl. If the mother’s blood enters first and the father’s essence follows, the essence envelops the blood to form a boy.\"* Jianwu likely drew from Chu’s theory, which contradicts Sanguzi’s—this discrepancy must be clarified.\n\nThirty years ago, I once discussed the distinction between male and female births with Wen Cixiao, the *Zongguan* of Yanshan. Cixiao strongly favored Sanguzi and Chu Huagu’s theories, adding: *\"Sun Simiao’s notion of 'heavenly gui' on the first and second days is not worth considering. Bai Yuchan’s theory of qi and blood’s waxing and waning, likened to the moon’s spirit, aligns with the *Suwen*’s statement: 'When the moon begins to wax, blood and qi begin to fill; when the moon is full, blood and qi are replete; when the moon wanes, the channels are empty.' Qi and blood wax from the new moon to the full moon and wane from the full moon to the dark moon. When the moon is full, the fish’s brain is plump; when the moon is dark, the fish’s brain diminishes. Clams and crabs follow the same pattern—neither the *Lüshi Chunqiu* nor the *Huainanzi* deceives.\"* I have often shared this with childless scholar-officials, and many have subsequently had sons. Yet whether one begets children or not rests with heaven’s decree—it is not something humans can force.\n\nMedical texts on methods to conceive boys frequently cite the *Chushi Yishu*, leading many astray. In my hometown, a nobleman’s son had two daughters in succession, and his concubine later conceived. The nobleman, overjoyed, told me: *\"This time, I will surely have a son—I followed Chu’s method!\"* I laughed and said: *\"If you followed Chu’s method, you should prepare to bow and listen—you’ll have another tile.\"* Later, he indeed had another daughter. I then explained Sanguzi and Chu Huagu’s theories to him, and the following year, he had a son.\n\nRecently, in casual conversation, Guo Boying of Chengjiang mentioned the Central Plains’ elders Hu Zishan, Wen Cixiao, and Hao Jifu, who debated the *Chushi Yishu*’s theories. Boying sighed: *\"I was misled by this book!\"* He, too, had followed Chu’s method, fathering six daughters in succession without realizing his error. Later, he discussed this with Zhang Shilong’s son from Songjiang—truly, one lost soul guiding another. I told him: *\"You must correct this at once!\"* Boying asked: *\"How should I correct it?\"* I replied: *\"If yang essence arrives first and yin blood envelops it, with yang within, a boy is formed—this is the Qian Dao seeking Kun to form a boy. If yin blood arrives first and yang essence envelops it, with yin within, a girl is formed—this is the Kun Dao seeking Qian to form a girl.\"* Boying heard this, laughed, expressed his thanks, and departed.",

      "translated_text": "Some may wonder: why do noblemen with concubines aplenty father few sons, while humble fishermen with but one wife bear many? This principle is as clear as day—what difficulty lies in seeing it? For those with few desires may have children, while those with many desires cannot. It is like seasoning a bowl of soup: just enough salt makes it savory, but too much renders it tasteless. If scholar-officials wish to have sons, they must practice moderation in desire; otherwise, they are like one who seeks oil from a withered pine or sap from a dried bamboo—how can they hope for offspring? The *Classic of Filial Piety* states: \"Of all that parents give to continue life, nothing is greater.\" Those who have not yet had sons must take heed.\n\nYet there is another reason: men are like Heaven, women like Earth. Though Heaven’s rain and dew ever moisten the land, Earth varies in fertility—some soils nurture life, others do not. If the land is barren, saline, or strewn with rubble, to demand it bear life is like carving ice to alter its form or grinding indigo to produce red—vain hope with no reward. The *Book of Later Han* records that Ma Le’s grandfather, Yan, stood less than seven *chi* tall and often lamented his short stature, fearing his descendants would inherit it. Thus, he arranged for his son, Kang, to marry a tall wife. Kang fathered Le, who grew to eight *chi* and three *cun*. Yet in later times, as customs declined, scholar-officials of Jiangnan indulged in sensual pleasures, marrying wives and concubines for their youth and delicacy. The sons they bore were frail, sickly, and often died young. Some even entered the bedchamber in drunkenness, their spirits muddled and disordered; though they might conceive, their children would lack intelligence.\n\nWhen yin and yang arrive in equal measure, the body is neither male nor female. This is the origin of scattered essence and blood, giving rise to twin or multiple births—such is the theory of the *Chushi Yishu*. Some are born without an anus, others without a birth canal. Why is this so? Xu Xun’s *On the Transformation of Embryos* states that conception occurs when the parents urgently relieve themselves. This theory also appears in the *Canon of Hygiene*. Some children are born with heads like snow and skin entirely white. Some suppose this results from conception on the day of the *She* sacrifice, hence calling such males \"She Lords\" and females \"She Ladies.\" But this is not so. Xu Xun’s *On the Transformation of Embryos* explains that if conception occurs while the mother’s menstrual blood is flowing, the excess blood overflows, forming the fetus—thus the flesh and skin are white. Chu’s theory that \"when blood fills the flesh, the body is white\" aligns with this. Why are the hair and eyes also white, with the gaze unsteady? The classics say: \"Hair is the surplus of blood,\" and \"The liver receives blood and enables sight.\" When menstruation is underway, blood is depleted, the liver weakened, hair loses its nourishment, and the eyes lack sustenance.\n\nFrom *Idle Chats at the Banquet Table*, Volume One, *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* (Imperially Commissioned)",

      "translated_text": "From *Idle Chats at the Banquet Table*, Volume Two\nBy Yu Yan of the Yuan Dynasty\n\nThe study of nourishing life takes the teachings of Laozi as its foundation. Laozi composed the *Dao De Jing*. Contemporaneously, there was Cheng Ben, a disciple of Laozi, with whom Confucius conversed after their carriages met by chance. His work is titled *Zi Hua Zi*. There were also Wenzi and Guanling Yin Xi, both disciples of Laozi. Wenzi’s book is called the *Tongxuan Zhenjing*, and Yin Xi’s book is called the *Guan Yin Zi*. Later, there appeared Liezi’s *Chongxu Zhide Zhenjing* and Zhuangzi’s *Nanhua Zhenjing*, both of which trace their lineage to Laozi’s teachings. The titles of these classics were bestowed by the imperial decree of Emperor Huizong.\n\nLaozi’s works are numerous. During the Han, there was He Shanggong; in the Wei, Wang Bi; in the Tang, Ye Fashan; in the Song, Su Ziyou and Wang Pang. In recent times, the You family of Wuxi produced *Laozi Yinxun*, which argues that the ancient text of Wang [Bi] is vastly superior to later versions, and its reasoning is sound.\n\nThe *Zi Hua Zi* is cited in the *Lingshu Jing*. Wenzi’s work has a commentary by Moxi Zi. In my view, the opening chapter of *Wenzi* states: \"Without the Dao, one cannot speak of it.\" This \"cannot speak\" is the Dao, aligning perfectly with Laozi’s \"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.\" The *Guan Yin Zi* has a commentary by Chen Baoyi. Liezi’s work has a commentary by Zhang Zhan, and Zhuangzi’s has commentaries by Guo Xiang and Cheng Xuanying. More recently, Lin Yanzhai produced *Oral Explications of the Three Masters: Laozi, Liezi, and Zhuangzi*. Liezi quotes the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*: \"The valley spirit does not die; it is called the mysterious female.\" In my view, this phrase originates from the *Book of the Yellow Emperor*, and what Laozi speaks of also derives from it. Zhuangzi’s work is based on Liezi, serving to elucidate Liezi’s meaning.\n\nThe *Huangdi Yinfu Jing* and the *Huangdi Suwen*—Shao Kangjie believed these were books from the time of the Beastly States, falsely attributed to the Yellow Emperor. In my view, the *Jinbi Longhu Jing* and the *Huangting Jing* are likely literary works from the Wei-Jin period, falsely attributed to Laozi’s lineage.\n\nThe *Yinfu Jing* has commentaries by Li Quan, the Old Woman of Mount Li, Zhang Guo, Lian Gaojiao, Tang Chun of Jinling, Li Yunfeng, Chu Huagu, and Zhu Xi. Zhu Xi remarked: \"The *Yinfu Jing* is likely a work by Li Quan of the Tang. Why would he deliberately imitate ancient prose? Simply because once he spoke of it, the text gained circulation. I once mentioned this to Lü Bogong, who agreed. It is much like the *Mayi Yi*, which was actually composed by Master Dai, though its self-explanatory text might deceive one into accepting it.\"\n\nThe *Longhu Jing* has commentaries by Wang Dao, Huang Tong, and Taixu Zi. Zhu Xi said: \"The *Longhu Jing* is merely an abridgment of the *Cantong Qi*. Since the *Cantong Qi* contains ancient records mentioning the dragon and tiger, this book was subsequently composed. For example, the *Cantong Qi* states: 'The two agents have no fixed position, circulating through the six voids.' This refers to the two agents, nine and six, moving through the six lines without a fixed position. The *Longhu Jing*, however, says: 'The two agents have no fixed position; Zhang and Yi fly through the void, soaring to Xu and Wei'—a bizarre and far-fetched interpretation.\"\n\nThe *Cantong Qi* was written by Wei Boyang of the Eastern Han. Ge Hong stated that Boyang composed the *Cantong Qi*, borrowing the hexagrams of the *Zhouyi* to discuss the art of elixir-making. Yet Confucians, unaware of the affairs of immortals, instead provided commentaries on yin and yang, entirely missing its essential purport. Nevertheless, even before the Jin dynasty, there were already commentaries on the *Cantong Qi*.\n\nFor instance, Yu Fan and Yin Changsheng both wrote commentaries, though these are no longer extant. By the Five Dynasties, during the false Shu regime, Zhenyi Zi (Peng Xiao) composed the *Tongzhen Yi*, interpreting the \"three phases\" as \"five phases\"—a mistake.\n\nThe \"three phases\" refer to the *Great Yi* and the [teachings of] the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.",
      "overlap_context": "hite. Chu’s theory that \"when blood fills the flesh, the body is white\" aligns with this. Why are the hair and eyes also white, with the gaze unsteady? The classics say: \"Hair is the surplus of blood,\" and \"The liver receives blood and enables sight.\" When menstruation is underway, blood is depleted, the liver weakened, hair loses its nourishment, and the eyes lack sustenance.\n\nFrom *Idle Chats at the Banquet Table*, Volume One, *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries* (Imperially Commissioned)",

      "translated_text": "The matter concerns the art of furnace and fire, wherein the yin and yang of the Three [Teachings] engage in transformation, all fundamentally interconnected. *Can* (參) means \"three,\" *tong* (同) means \"mutual,\" and *qi* (契) means \"accord\"—this is an explication of the title *Cantong Qi*. The phrase \"commission the seasons, depart from harm, and neighbor the ghost\" refers to the character *Wei* (魏). Zheng Huan mistakenly altered *ghost* (鬼) to *immortal* (仙). Beneath *baiyi* (百一), \"roaming the human realm,\" the character *baiyi* (百一) with the addition of a standing *ren* (人) to its side forms *Bo* (伯). Tang encountered adversity—drought and flood kept him apart; the absence of water during drought forms *Yi* (易). Combining the adversity of *e* (阨) and the boundary of *ji* (际) below yields *Yang* (阳). This is an explication of the three characters *Wei Boyang*.\n\nPeng Zhenyi’s commentary exists in the Shu edition, Yuan edition, Ji edition, and Xu Yizi’s edition. Zheng Huan’s edition was carved by Wang Gang and placed beneath the Penglai Pavilion in Yuezhou. After Peng Zhenyi’s commentary on the *Cantong Qi*, there appeared Zhang Sui’s commentary, Li Baosu’s commentary (rather brief), Chen Baoyi’s commentary, and Chu Huagu’s commentary, which contains many insights. Zhu Xi once composed a commentary under the name of the Kongtong Daoist Zou Fang—*Zou* being the state of Zhu in the Spring and Autumn period. He also wrote the *Kaoyi*. Tao Hongjing’s *Zhen Gao* contains many poems about immortal maidens descending, which discerning readers reject, for they are merely Hongjing’s own fabrications. Zhu Xi remarked that the final \"Daoist Transmission\" section of the *Zhen Gao* was nothing more than a plagiarism of the Buddhist *Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters*.\n\nDuring the Tang, there were Wu Zhenjie’s *Xuan Gang Lun*, Sima Zixu’s *Zuowang Lun*, Wang Changyu’s *Yi Xuanzi Shi*, Han Xiaoyao’s *Neizhi Tongxuan Pian*. Sima Zixu’s preface to the *Tianyouzi* states: \"The essential subtlety lies in harmonizing with the true qi of Heaven and Earth and moving in unison with it,\" and further, \"When the qi of awakening arrives, circulate one’s own qi to align with the qi of Heaven and Earth, acting in concert.\" This is the most sublime technique. If, within three hundred and sixty days, one’s own qi aligns with that of Heaven and Earth two or three times, one will naturally feel the body’s clarity and harmony, unlike ordinary times. How much more so if this is sustained over time—the Dao of immortality will not be difficult to attain.\n\nThe *Huashu* was written by Tan Qiao, whose courtesy name was Jingsheng. He brought his book to seek a preface from Qi Jiu, who killed Tan Qiao and usurped the work, claiming it as his own. The *Ruyao Jing* was composed by Cui Daifan of White Crane Mountain. Lü Dongbin’s poem reads: \"Gazing upon Master Cui’s *Ruyao Jing* / Makes one’s heart-ground ever clearer.\" Xia Yunfeng, Chu Huagu, and Xiao Liaozhen all wrote commentaries. Upon examining the text, it states: \"Heaven responds to the stars, Earth responds to the tides\"—this merely refers to the mutual correspondence of above and below. If one clings rigidly to its meaning, the Dipper’s handle shifts one mansion each month, differing monthly, while the sea’s tides arrive twice daily, consistently. How can both respond in unison?\n\nIt further states: \"Exhaust *wu-si* (戊巳),\" yet some mistakenly render it as \"exhaust *wu-gui* (戊癸),\" taking *gui* (癸) as *tian gui* (天癸). This is akin to the *Wuzhen Pian*, where it speaks of \"seeing the sprout arise, one must swiftly gather it,\" yet some interpret \"sprout arise\" as \"gui arise.\" These are all distortions by practitioners of the Three Peaks technique, who recklessly alter the text to validate their heterodox doctrines. Chu Huagu’s theory of *wu-gui* transforming into fire and Li Yuxi’s discourse on *kun-gui* are attempts to rectify heterodoxy and return to orthodoxy, though their arguments are strained.\n\nDuring the Five Dynasties, there were Zhongli Ji’s *Daoji Xuanshu* in thirty-nine chapters, Lü Dongbin’s poems, Shi Jianwu’s *Jingzhong Yin*, the *Sanzhu Ming*, and the *Xishan Qiongzhen Ji*, as well as the *Zhong Lü Chuandao Ji*. In the Song, there were Chen Tuan’s *Zhixuan Pian* in eighty-one poems, Liu Haichan’s *Huánjīn Piān* in fourteen poems, Chen Chaoyuan’s *Yuzhi Shi*, Yang Xuchun’s *Cuilun*, Liu Xihe’s *Langranzi Shi*, Ning Xuanzhi’s poems, Zhang Hongmeng’s *Huanyuan Pian*, the *Yuding Wujie Pian*, Zhang Pingshu’s *Wuzhen Pian*, Xue Daofu’s *Fuming Pian*, Liu Gaoshang’s *Fayu*, Liu Xugu’s *Huandan Pian*, Chen Mo’s *Chongzheng Pian*, and Li Changyuan’s *Hunyuan Pian*. Among these works, only the *Wuzhen Pian* and *Fuming Pian* have commentaries.\n\nZhang Junfang compiled the Daoist Canon into the *Yunji Qiqian*, which is heavily interspersed with talismans, rituals, and doctrines of karmic retribution—matters with which Zeng Zao (Zeng Zhi) was deeply concerned. Zeng Zao’s *Daoshu* collects the elixir poems and songs of various immortals, such as Haichan’s *Huánjīn* and Chaoyuan’s *Yuzhi*, all included therein.\n\nLiu Xiang’s *Liexian Zhuan*, Ge Hong’s *Shenxian Zhuan*, Shen Fen’s *Xuxian Zhuan*, Zeng Zhi’s *Jixian Zhuan*, Yi Rugang’s *Xianzhuan Shiyi*, and Chen Baoguang’s *Sandong Shenxian Lu*—along with works like the *Dongxian Zhuan* and *Shenxian Ganyu Zhuan*—though miscellaneous, record the names of immortals from ancient and modern times. Among the poems, songs, and verses of elixirists are Yuanyangzi’s *Dadao Ge*, Master Zeng’s *Lingyuan Ge*, Zhang Xujing’s *Dadao Ge*, Gao Xiangxian’s *Pomi Ge*, Wu Zhenjie’s *Xuexian Ge*, and the *Yuding Pomi Ge*. A portion of the *Zhengdao Ge* is missing. Liu Gaoshang’s *Qiaoyao Ge* has a commentary by Jinhua Zi, and there are also poems by Dongwei Zi. Some works are falsely attributed to ancient figures, such as Yin Jun’s *Huandan Ge*, the Three Mao Lords’ *Dadao Ge*, Ge Xianweng’s *Liuzhu Ge*, Xu Jingyang’s *Zuisi Xian Ge*, and Lü Gong’s *Xuanpin Ge*. Many of these contain passages that clarify their meaning.\n\nLiu Xugu’s *Yiji* merely borrows the *Yi* to embellish its doctrines—he was no true knower of the *Yi*. Thus, Zhu Xi vehemently criticized such works.",

His deliberate embellishments and fabrications were intended to secure the trust of contemporary scholars.\n\nYuchan transmitted his teachings to Peng Helin, Peng Ziyuan, and Xiao Liaozhen.

Xu Zhiwei’s *Xiuzhen Mijue of the Precelestial Orthodox Lineage* employs the transitions of the twelve hours as markers. In his preface, he states that during the Chunxi era, he received transmission from Peng Mengqu of Hanzhou. Later, Xiao Guanfu’s *Danxu* and *Baojian* contained inner images of the elixir’s principles, aligning with Zhiwei’s transmission. The *Dayuan Pian* by Annanzi, whose surname is unknown, and Wei Xian’s work from Shouchun in the Jiayou era of Jiaxi, as well as Chen Guan’s *Zhengdao Pian* by Suyangzi of Mount Lu (with prefaces by Meng Gong of Handong and Liu Yuangang of Luling in the second year of Chunyou), all bear witness to this lineage.\n\nZhou Wusuo of Yongjia’s *Jindan Zhizhi* was postscripted by Yang Zizheng of Shu in the Jiachen year of Baoyou. His *Miscellaneous Writings* incorporated the doctrines of the *Lianluo* school, revealing profound principles. Zhang Yongchang’s *Zhenru Zhiming Pian* was printed in the Wuwu year of Qingyuan by Zhaoyangzi Zhao Yan. The *Dan Jue* of Huo Shanggu of Piling included the *Yizi Xuanji* and *Canwen*. In the seventh month, You Mushi of Wuxi prefaced his work. Shanggu’s disciple, Juchuan, further composed the *Jindan Koujue Zhizhi*, extensively discussing the celestial *wu-si* hours and their correspondence with the human body—*Kan* as *wu* and *Li* as *si*. In heaven, this signifies the mutual gaze of sun and moon; in the human body, the reciprocal nurturing of breath.\n\nIn my hometown, Prefect Mi, whose given name is lost and whose style was Yunzhai, rose to the rank of *Fengzhi Dafu*. His *Mingzhen Pian* by Dongyangzi was printed at his residence in the Dingsi year of Baoyou. In Yunjian, there was Chan’guzi Wang Kui’s *Guanling Pian* and Huaguzi Chu Yong’s *Jieyinfu Jing*, *Cantong Qi*, *Yaojing*, and *Wuzhen* in four volumes, along with his *Fang Sanji*, all printed in Songjiang. The Taoist Feng Shoujing of Kuocang authored the *Zhengdao Pian*, though it was never printed. Both he and Wang Yi’an received the Dao from Cao Mo’an.\n\nLi Jianyi of Yichun, styled Yuxizi, wrote the *Xinjing Jie*, *Wuzhen Zhiyao*, *Xihuang Zuoyong*, and other works, along with the *Gui Shi Tu*, which he entrusted to Peng Shipo of Changsha—its explanations were exceptionally clear. These were printed in Hunan, and later reprinted in Jiangxi. Peng Shipo also possessed esoteric sayings, the *Jiafu Dazuo Tiaoyuanqi Ge* with annotations, and its concluding lines read: \"Record this and promptly commit it to the *bing-ding*—this is the true oral instruction for commencing practice.\" At the time, Peng, unwilling to destroy it, allowed it to circulate among the rivers and lakes. Whoever obtained this text could proceed without further inquiry.\n\nIn the Wuxu year of Dade, a fellow Daoist from Xiangtan presented me with Zhao Guchan’s *Xingming Hundun Shu*. Though interspersed with Chan terminology, its explanations were nonetheless lucid. In the summer of the Gengzi year of Dade, Hu Yun showed me the *Jindan Youxuan Pian*, stating it was the work of Liang Jiuyang. Its preface revealed that he received it from Wang Shanbin of Tiantaishan, whose style was Zhenchangzi. Shanbin, also known as Wang Keda, exchanged verses with Xia Yunfeng and Chen Liaokong of Yulu’an. Shanbin’s *Zhongmiao Yi Ji* was brought to me by Grand Preceptor Wen Ruxin in the Xinsi year of Zhiyuan—this was a handwritten copy.\n\nXia Yuanding of Yongjia, styled Yunfeng, annotated the *Yinfu Jing*, *Yaojing*, and *Wuzhen Pian*, with a preface by Zhen Xishan. Yu Lu’an of Luxi printed the *Xiushen Sishu* at Yangjiao Dongtian, comprising: first, Han Xiaoyao’s *Neizhi Tongxuan Jue*; second, Chen Liaokong’s *Fu Yi Pian*; third, Wang Dai’s *Cheju Yi Pian*; and fourth, *Danfang Deyi Pian*. In the Gengwu year of Xianchun, He Fengji of Shu provided the preface.\n\nChen Yudao of Weizhou, styled Baoyizi, authored the *Liming Pian*. In the Gengyin year of Shaoding, Bai Yuchan wrote a postscript, and he also annotated the *Guanyinzi* and *Cantong Qi*, with Prime Minister Dong Jutang adding a colophon. Sanguzi Qiu Shan’s *Jindan Baiwen* states that in the early Qiandao era, he received the Dao from the Old Man of Jinhua. Wei Yuzi’s *Zhipian* preface, written in the Gengyin year of Shaoding, does not record his surname. His disciple composed the *Chengzhen Pian*, also without attribution.\n\nThe Golden Realization Teachings of Wang Chongyang include the *Jinzhen Ji*, Ma Danyang’s *Weiyu Ji*, *Jinyu Ji*, Tan Changzhen’s *Shuiyun Ji*, Liu Changsheng’s *Xianle Ji*, Qiu Changchun’s *Panxi Ji*, *Mingdao Ji*, Wang Yuyang’s *Lingguang Ji*, and Hao Guangning’s *Taigu Ji*. Northern editions collectively titled *Qizhen Yaoxun* were widely circulated. In the Jihai year of Dade, I was presented with Ding Lingyang’s collected works and requested to write a preface for Ma Danyang’s *Yulu*, which I accordingly provided.\n\nSome say that Huo Shanggu, Yuchangu, Chu Huagu, and Mi Dongyang all possessed knowledge but did not practice.

      "translated_text": "I say otherwise—have you not heard of Liezi’s account? Liezi states: \"There was once a man who spoke of the Way of immortality. Yanju sent someone to learn it, but the learner failed. The speaker died, and Yanju, enraged, sought to punish the envoy. A wise man admonished him, saying, 'What men fear most is death, and what they value most is life. If he himself lost his life, how could he grant you immortality? Thus, you ought not execute the envoy.' There was a man of Qi who also wished to learn this Way. Upon hearing of the speaker’s death, he struck his chest in regret. Fuzi, hearing of this, laughed and said, 'He wished to learn the Way of immortality, yet the man who taught it is dead, and still he regrets it—this is to not know the purpose of learning.' Huzi replied, 'Fuzi’s words are mistaken. There are those who possess arts they cannot practice, and there are those who can practice but lack the arts. A man of Wei skilled in calculation, before dying, revealed his method to his son. The son memorized his father’s words but could not perform it. Another man, upon hearing the method, practiced it and achieved results no different from the father’s. If this is so, how could the dead be unable to transmit the arts of life?'\n\nZhu Xi said to Jitong, 'Yin Jun’s alchemical formulas appear in *Liánxī’s Poems*—those who follow them and attain longevity are like men who eat pork and are sated. Yet we know of many such cases, and still we cannot escape decline and illness. Is this not like discussing dragon meat without ever having tasted it?' Forty years ago, when I annotated the *Cantong Qi*, I saw Lü Sixing’s *Eight Brocade Arts* and marveled at his vigor in old age, secretly laughing at him. Now, reflecting on it, the learning of the *Cantong Qi* is truly the art of butchering dragons—far inferior to Sixing’s skill in slaughtering swine.\n\nTo know yet not practice is what Zhu Xi called 'discussing dragon meat.' Yet those who study this Way must abandon wife and children to pursue it. We read the books of the sages—how, with parents still living, could we dare defy Heaven and scheme for a stolen life? Nevertheless, I have tried this in nightly meditation and have thus gained some slight taste of dragon meat. Is this not better than merely discussing it without knowing its flavor?

      "translated_text": "Though frail and sickly, scarcely able to bear the weight of my clothes, I have clung to this thread of breath and lived to this day—this, too, is the power of the *Cantong Qi*. After the fall of the Deyou era, the literary world lay in ruins, and I had no use for my mind. I shut my door, sat in stillness, and amused myself with the qin. Reading the *Yijing* and the inner and outer alchemical texts, I developed four obsessions: first, the qin. I sought to rectify the five notes with the six pitch-pipes, but when I asked qin masters, none could answer. Later, I obtained the *Qin Book of Master Ziyang*, the *Nanxi Anthology of Qin*, and the *Jade Manual of Profound Sounds*, and only then did I grasp the method of modulating the modes. Thus, I composed qin tablatures for the *Odes of Zhou Nan* and *Shao Nan*, as well as for poems like *Deer Cry*, *Huanghua*, and *Li Sao*, the *Nine Songs*, the *Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Poems*, *Returning Home*, *The Pavilion of the Drunken Old Man*, and *The Red Cliff Rhapsody*. My obsession with the qin was thus sated.\n\nNext was the *Yijing*. I compiled the interpretations of various scholars into a work of one hundred and twenty fascicles, titled *Essentials of the Great Yijing*, taking Master Cheng and Master Zhu as my foundation and supplementing them with the best of other commentaries. I further added my own insights from teachers and friends, resulting in forty fascicles of *Collected Commentaries on the Zhouyi*. This obsession, too, was satisfied.\n\nFor inner alchemy, I gathered alchemical poems, songs, and formulas from the Han and Tang dynasties into one hundred fascicles, calling it the *Comprehensive Anthology of the Mysterious*. In the guiwei year of the Zhiyuan era, I encountered an extraordinary man who transmitted to me the ultimate mystery of the primordial. Thereafter, I composed works such as *Elucidations on the Cantong Qi* and *Extended Meanings of the Wuzhen Pian*, and this obsession also subsided.\n\nAs for outer alchemy, I knew nothing of cinnabar or mercury, and my attempts only produced smoke and flames. One night, I suddenly awakened to the truth of the *Cantong Qi*: gold is made from sand, and it is amalgamated with mercury. In this world, there is only the golden elixir—there is no silver elixir. Thus, I smashed my furnace and crucible, and this obsession never arose again. I once compiled a *Record of Warnings for Alchemical Furnaces*, but here I merely sketch its outline.\n\nIn the third year of Xiande during the reign of Emperor Shizong of Zhou, the Daoist Chen Tuan of Mount Hua was summoned and asked about the art of transmuting base metals into gold. He replied, \"Your Majesty is the Son of Heaven; your duty is to govern the realm. Why concern yourself with such things?\" The emperor then sent him back to the mountains, ordering local officials to inquire after his well-being.\n\nDuring the Jingde era of Emperor Zhenzong, while the emperor was visiting the imperial tombs, he summoned extraordinary individuals. Among them was Helan Guizhen, who was summoned for an audience. The emperor asked, \"I hear you possess the art of transformation. You may speak of it.\" Helan replied, \"I would speak of the art of imperial transformation. I wish to transform the realm with the Dao of Yao and Shun, bringing about great peace. May Your Majesty employ it.\"\n\nWang Jie, a native of Tingzhou, was a merchant who traveled between the Jiang and Huai regions. He encountered an extraordinary man who taught him the art of transmuting gold, warning him, \"Do not recklessly transmit this unless you meet a ruler.\" Eager to present it to the emperor, Wang was arrested by officials and feigned madness to avoid punishment. He was tattooed and exiled beyond the Five Ridges, but later escaped and hid in the capital. He went to the Court of Judicial Review, claiming to be a former subordinate of the Privy Councilor Xie Congquan. Xie, who had once served as an official in Lingnan, knew of Wang’s art and memorialized the throne, securing his release from military service.\n\nA eunuch, Liu Chenggui, reported Wang’s name to the emperor, who summoned him for an audience. Pleased with their conversation, the emperor appointed him as a military officer in Xuzhou, changed his name to Wang Zhongzheng, and kept him in the capital. Wang repeatedly presented gold, amounting to tens of thousands, and rose to the rank of Right Divine Martial General and Military Commissioner of Tangzhou. An old smith named Bi Sheng, who had worked in the palace forging gold for Wang, said of the method: \"The furnace and bellows were arranged so that others were made to work them from behind a wall, lest they glimpse the opening and closing of the process.\"\n\nThe gold was made of iron, with over a hundred taels cast into one cake. Each cake was divided into eight pieces, called \"crow’s-beak gold.\" The emperor ordered the Imperial Workshop to cast the gold into ingots and plaques, numbering in the hundreds. Tortoiseshell-shaped plaques were bestowed upon close ministers, while the rest were stored in the Jade Purity and Radiant Response Palace. Plaques were also given to each prefecture, commandery, and military district, and the golden treasure plaques of the Heavenly Celebration Abbey were cast from this same gold.\n\nFor each forging, Wang used snake mounds to refine realgar, killing countless snakes in the process. Later, while building his residence, he unearthed a giant snake with a head as large as a basket. Shocked, he fell ill and died at the age of fifty-five. His wife, Lady Shi, was enfeoffed as the Lady of Wu Commandery, and his sons were all appointed as palace attendants.\n\nWang Jie had initially obtained his divine art but never revealed it for power or profit. After receiving emoluments and gifts, he used the transmuted gold only to support the poor and to aid Daoist and Buddhist establishments. Whenever the court held grand ceremonies or undertook construction, he presented gold to assist with expenses. The *History of the Song Dynasty* contains a biography of Wang Zhongzheng, written by the Grand Historian Zeng Gong. The *Collection of Eminent Ministers’ Steles and Biographies* states that during the Xianping era, Wang Jie arrived in Nankang Commandery and met an extraordinary man who claimed to be surnamed Zhao. After some time, they met again on Mount Mao, where Zhao instructed him in the method of making gold.\n\nThe *Guangling Gazetteer* records that Wang Jie met a Daoist in Weiyang, who took him to the Temple of the Five Manifestations and pointed out a sacred herb. The Daoist taught him the secret formula for combining it. During the Dazhong Xiangfu era, Wang composed a text to thank the temple, where an old stone inscription of a prayer once stood. Though lost to war and fire, the herb for transmuting gold still grows there.\n\nZhang Yong, the Duke of Wending, styled himself Fuzhi and was also known as Guaiya. While serving in Shu, an alchemist sought an audience, claiming to be able to transmute mercury into silver. Zhang immediately purchased a hundred taels of mercury and had the alchemist refine it. After one firing, the mercury turned to silver without the slightest loss in weight. Zhang ordered a craftsman to cast it into a large incense burner, which he had inscribed on its belly: \"For the main hall of the Great Compassion Temple.\" He then sent the burner to the temple, along with a wine vessel as a gift for the alchemist, whom he dismissed.\n\nFan Zhongyan, styled himself Xiwen, was on good terms with a man from Nanjun surnamed Zhu. When Zhu fell ill, Fan visited him. Zhu said, \"I met an extraordinary man who taught me the art of transforming mercury into silver. You are still young and unworthy of this transmission, so I now pass it to you.\" He then gave Fan the formula and the medicine. Fan refused, but Zhu insisted, so he accepted it unopened. Later, when Zhu’s son Cai came of age, Fan instructed him as he would his own son. After Cai passed the imperial examinations, Fan returned the sealed medicine and the method to him.\n\nHu Su, the Duke of Wengong, styled himself Wuping, was on good terms with a Buddhist monk in his youth. As the monk lay dying, he said to Hu, \"I possess a secret art that can transform tiles and stones into gold. You will see to my burial.\" Hu replied, \"I will certainly attend to your funeral affairs, but I have no desire for secret arts.\" The monk sighed and said, \"Your aspirations are beyond measure.\"\n\nThe father of Ju Shiying, a compiler in the Bureau of Military Affairs, was known as Fourth Gentleman Ju. In his youth, he encountered an extraordinary man who taught him the method of refining cinnabar with concealed fire. Using equal parts gold and mercury, he formed a sand-like amalgam, which he wrapped in the concealed-fire cinnabar and refined into purple-lustrous gold. He never spoke of this to others, though he occasionally used a small amount. On his deathbed, he called for Shiying and said, \"I have only ever revealed this refining method to Minister Han.\"",

      "translated_text": "The method must not be passed on to anyone unworthy—only one as virtuous and accomplished as Minister Han is fit to receive it. Nor should I transmit it to you; if it is truly your destined portion, someone will come to teach you. Yet I know that once word spreads of my possession of this art, reckless seekers will come, so I will tell you of several formulas that fail to produce treasure, and recount how several men who dabbled in them met with disaster. Beware, beware!\n\nI once had a servant who tended the fire for years without slackening. Later, I judged him fit to become a monk, and he took up residence in the Capital’s Calendar Bureau. At the time, Zeng Zixuan held high office. One of his hall clerks fell gravely ill with consumption, and the court physicians could do nothing. The clerk came to me, saying, “I need your divine elixir.” I took a knife-tip’s measure and gave it to him; he recovered at once. Zixuan was astonished. The clerk explained how he had been saved by Fourth Gentleman Ju’s elixir, snatched from the very jaws of death. Zixuan sent men to summon me, but I refused to come. He then dispatched his retainers to coax the monk with lavish gifts and provisions. One day, the monk called on the Chancellor. Privately, he presented a portion of the elixir. Delighted, Zixuan escorted the monk down the steps. As the monk withdrew, he bowed at the horse-block, stumbled, and fell, breaking his leg on the spot. Carried back in a litter, he died within days.\n\nMaster Yin Hejing, styled Yanming, told his disciple Qi Kuan: “When Master Cheng Yi was traveling, he once rested late at an ancient temple. He prepared his bedding before the Buddha’s pedestal but had not yet lain down when he heard a faint rustling. Looking closely, he saw a rat in a small hole in the Buddha’s belly, holding a slip of paper in its mouth, trying to pull it out. Master Cheng rose to investigate. Inside the hole was a scroll. He took it and read it—a cinnabar formula. At its head were the words: *This is no common worldly art.* Master Cheng read it through once and grasped its meaning entirely. He copied a version, then returned the original scroll to the hole.\n\nLater, while living in the suburbs, he refined this elixir. The method required nurturing the fire for forty-nine days to complete. Around the thirtieth day, as night fell, people from the surrounding fields came to his dwelling, saying, ‘There is no fire left in our homes. We all see flames rising from here like this several times over. We fear it will alarm the villagers.’ Master Cheng then removed the elixir and tested it. He placed a grain of millet in a silver bowl, and wherever the elixir touched, it turned to gold. During the Chongning era, the bowl was still preserved, its gold forming thread-like circles where the elixir had adhered.\n\nThe half-formed elixir he sealed in his clothing chest. Because of its uncanny nature, he never spoke of it to others. Once, I took the opportunity to ask Master Cheng about it. He said, ‘This is an external elixir. If one’s internal elixir is complete and one’s inner power is firmly established, consuming this can prolong life. Transmuting the five metals is but a trifling matter.’ I asked, ‘Why not take it yourself?’ He replied, ‘This substance is not meant for such a belly. In my later years, I intended to pass this formula to a certain Daoist, but before I could transmit it, I passed away. A month later, the Daoist arrived—too late.’\n\nSu Ziyou’s *Longchuan Lüezhi* states: My elder brother Zizhan once served in Fufeng, where the Kaiyuan Temple held many ancient paintings. Zizhan was fond of painting and would often ride alone to the temple, spending the whole day tracing the murals. An old monk emerged and bowed, saying, ‘My humble abode is nearby. Might you honor me with a visit?’ Zizhan gladly followed. The monk said, ‘I am skilled in alchemical arts and possess a formula that can transmute cinnabar and pale gold into refined gold. I have long wished to pass it on but have found no worthy recipient. Knowing you are the one, I wished to meet you.’ Zizhan replied, ‘I have no interest in such arts. Even if I obtained the method, I would not practice it.’ The monk said, ‘This formula is known but must not be practiced. If you will not practice it, then I shall transmit it to you.’\n\nAt that time, Assistant Minister Chen Xiliang was the prefect of Fufeng. He was deeply obsessed with alchemy and had sought the formula from this monk, who refused to give it. Zizhan said, ‘Minister Chen sought it but did not receive it. I did not seek it, yet I have obtained it. Why?’ The monk replied, ‘I am not displeased with Minister Chen. It is because once he obtains the formula, he will not be able to refrain from practicing it. In the past, I have transmitted this method to others. Some died after practicing it, some suffered family misfortunes, and others lost their official positions. Thus, I dare not lightly pass it on.’ He then produced a scroll, saying, ‘This contains many famous formulas, including the one for transmuting gold. You will certainly not practice it lightly, but do not casually transmit it to others—especially not to men like Minister Chen. Beware!’\n\nZizhan promised and returned home to examine the formula. For every *liang* of pale gold, if the proportion was slightly deficient, he added a *qian* of cinnabar, mixed it with other ingredients, and placed it in a dry crucible. When melted and poured out, neither the gold nor the cinnabar was diminished; only their hues were unevenly mixed. Repeated smelting was required until the color became uniform.\n\nLater, he happened to see Minister Chen and mentioned the monk. Chen immediately replied, ‘I recently obtained his formula.’ Zizhan was surprised: ‘How did you come by it?’ Zizhan recounted the monk’s reluctance to transmit it lightly and refused to show the formula. Chen persisted until Zizhan, unable to refuse further, gave it to him. Chen examined it and found it genuine. Zizhan regretted, saying, ‘I do not regret parting with the formula; I regret betraying the monk’s trust. Be cautious in your practice.’ Chen casually agreed, saying, ‘Very well.’ Soon after, he was dismissed from office for accepting bribes while drunk on official business in a neighboring prefecture. Zizhan suspected it was due to his alchemical pursuits.\n\nLater, when Zizhan was demoted to Huangzhou, Chen’s son Zao was there. Zizhan asked, ‘Did your father ever practice that method?’ Zao replied, ‘After my father lost his position, he went to Luoyang with no means to buy a house. He then practiced this art extensively, but in the end, he died from an infected finger. The monk’s warning was not false.’\n\nOver a decade later, when Zizhan was demoted to Junzhou, there was a Sichuan monk named Yi Jie who served as a disciple of Chan Master Ke Wen. Wherever Ke Wen went, Yi Jie would undertake construction projects, spending vast sums without revealing the source of his funds or his methods. Yi Jie was close to Chan Master Xing Cong and secretly told him the formula, which was largely the same as that transmitted by the Kaiyuan monk of Fufeng. However, Yi Jie never used a single *qian* for personal gain, so he preserved the art without mishap.\n\nIt is further said: At the end of the Zhiping era, I was returning from Shaanxi to Sichuan and moored my boat at the foot of Xiandu Mountain. A Daoist showed me a stone inscription of the *Yinzhen Jun Dan Jue*. I asked him about the art of refining elixirs. He replied, ‘If one’s internal elixir is not complete and one lacks inner mastery, those who consume external elixirs often die. It is like piling dry grass and worn-out cotton and placing fire beneath—nothing will remain unburned.’\n\nOver a decade later, while serving in the Southern Capital, I visited the home of Zhang Andao. A Daoist there was nurturing a golden elixir. The method used purple-gold and cinnabar and required a full year to complete. Zhang told me, ‘The elixir is ready to be consumed.’ I asked, ‘How do you know it is complete?’ He replied, ‘The *Baopuzi* states: When the elixir is complete, if you grasp it in your hand, it will be like mud, oozing between your fingers. That is how you know the elixir is truly complete.’",

Using equal parts gold and mercury, he formed a sand-like amalgam, which he wrapped in the concealed-fire cinnabar and refined into purple-lustrous gold. He never spoke of this to others, though he occasionally used a small amount. On his deathbed, he called for Shiying and said, \"I have only ever revealed this refining method to Minister Han.\"",

      "translated_text": "Now, my elixir is like this—by this I know it is complete.”\n\nI recounted to Zhang what I had heard at Mount Xiandu, saying, “I know that once my internal elixir is complete, this external elixir may be consumed. If it is not yet so, why not wait a while?” Zhang laughed and said, “Am I to wait?”\n\nWhen Master Dongpo was twenty-six and first took office in Qizhou, an extraordinary monk pressed upon him a method for transmuting gold. Once he had obtained the technique, he sealed it and later passed it to Master Yingbin. Yingbin likewise kept it hidden. When he later resided in Wuchang, a relative who knew of it inquired about the method. Yingbin said, “My late elder brother entrusted it to me, and I have guarded it for years. When I have leisure, I shall search for it among my belongings.” After some time, he summoned the inquirer and produced the book, saying, “Dongpo sealed it in Qizhou just as it was.” Yingbin then broke the seal and perused the text, asking, “Is this it?” The inquirer joyfully replied, “It is!” Yingbin immediately burned it in the furnace and said to him, “One may endure poverty, but how can one endure this?” The inquirer, ashamed and abashed, fled in disarray.\n\nMaster Cha of Gusu obtained the method for refining saltpeter. Zhang Shengong befriended him intimately, yet the method was not transmitted. Once, encountering an ailing monk, Cha took pity on him and used saltpeter to fashion a bowl, instructing him to boil water in it daily and drink from it. After a month, the monk’s illness was greatly alleviated. A visitor who had witnessed this asked the monk the reason, and the monk explained it was due to drinking the boiled water. The visitor, who had long known of Cha’s art, said, “This was made from refined saltpeter. Place mercury in the bowl and test it over fire.” When they did so, the mercury was indeed rendered inert. The monk, considering this a rare encounter, went to express his gratitude repeatedly and inquired about the bowl’s marvel. He then earnestly sought the method. Cha said, “The method is not easily transmitted, but the bowl you used earlier is nearly exhausted. Bring it to me, and I shall add more medicine to it for you.” The monk fetched the bowl and handed it to Cha, who then shattered it, melted it anew by the gate beside a great river, and waited until the saltpeter turned to liquid before using tongs to cast it into the water, saying, “I initially only wished to cure your illness, never expecting such insatiable greed.” The monk departed in remorse.\n\nThe Daoist Fang Ziming resided at Shousheng Temple in Ruizhou. Su Lun of Chengdu presented him with a poem that read:\n*Mercury becomes silver, tenfold the gain,*\n*Cinnabar turns to gold—none in the world compare.*\n*Yet this man hoards his art, refusing to impart,*\n*Sealing his door, tending his clay furnace, wary of heaven’s decree.*\n\nZiyou once practiced the art of *huangbai* alchemy. He prepared a tightly sealed chamber and placed a furnace within, ready to light the fire. Suddenly, he saw a large cat perched atop the furnace, urinating. Startled, he looked again, but the cat had vanished. Ziyou said, “The arts of divine immortals are bestowed by heaven to aid the impoverished. One must await the right person before transmitting them. Since this is not the one, I dare not proceed.”\n\nZhang Yifang had been compounding the returning elixir for years without success. Stricken by illness and near death, he lamented his failure to complete the ninefold cyclical refinement. He ordered his disciples to dismantle the elixir furnace. Beneath it, they found a massive serpent with fiery maw and brocade-like scales coiled within, as if a divine being guarding it. They took a pellet of the elixir and fed it to him, but he died, mute and speechless.\n\nDongpo’s poem reads:\n*In my twilight years, my eyesight still laments its decline,*\n*My many ailments and hoary hair weigh heavily upon me.*\n*Thus I write small characters by the bright window,*\n*And open a secluded chamber to nurture cinnabar.*\n\nHuang Luzhi annotated: According to a letter Master Dongpo wrote to Wang Dingguo, he had recently obtained a small amount of jujube cinnabar, its radiance most extraordinary. Though he dared not consume it, he was instructed to tend the fire and observe its transformations, merely to delight his spirit and pass the days.\n\nAnother poem by Dongpo reads:\n*In Caonan, Master Liu’s name rivals Zizheng’s,*\n*His household holds the* Hongbao *scriptures, yet he refrains from forging the steed’s hooves.*\n*Seated close, I inquire of the Way, but he guards it well,*\n*Unwilling to share even a knife-tip’s measure, lest he alone escape death.*\n*Would he truly withhold a scroll’s worth from one who climbs the ladder?*\n\nZhao Ciweng annotated: Was Master Liu perhaps Liu Yiweng? While in Meizhou, Master Dongpo wrote to Yiweng, saying, “If you have an external elixir already completed that might aid in printing, I hope you will not begrudge sharing some jujubes.” The letter is preserved in the *Piling Later Collection*. Zhao Yaogeng annotated: Liu Anshi, style Zizhi, was a *daizhi* from Caonan. He possessed the arts of longevity and elixir refinement, and Master Dongpo once studied under him.\n\nNear the slopes of Mount Bagong in Shouzhou, small gold cakes were often unearthed from the earth and streams. The world transmits that these were the alchemical gold of the Prince of Huainan, bearing seal impressions—hence called “seal gold.”\n\nIn the region of Fangyang, at the Whitewater lands of Chongling, gold in the shapes of unicorn hooves and swift steeds was frequently unearthed when digging. These were called “persimmon gold.” The smaller pieces, resembling unicorn hooves and swift steeds, were the alchemical gold made by Lou Jing. The *Book of Han* annotation also states that it differed from other gold.\n\nAlchemists say that Lou’s gold, when used in elixir refinement, is most excellent. Dongpo’s *Record of Things That Mutually Respond* includes in its “Herbs” section the grasses *zhu gang*, *zhu ci*, and others, which traveling guests often use for smelting. However, they do not know the proper method of boiling and refining.\n\nI once read in the seventy-eighth fascicle of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* of a medicinal liquid called *hezhajia*. If one obtains it and uses a tael to transform ten taels of copper, it becomes true gold. A monk once cited this to me, and I asked, “Do those who composed the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* know of this?” The monk smiled and left. I once rubbed a small amount of chalcanthite on a knife blade, and it turned to gold. Perhaps *hezhajia* refers to chalcanthite?\n\nIn the year *xinhai* of the Zhida era, during the casting of coinage, I was in Raozhou and witnessed a solution of vitriol water transmuting iron into copper. However, the vitriol in Raozhou comes from copper mines, hence it produces copper. The vitriol from Jinzhou comes from gold mines and must be capable of transmuting copper and iron into gold. This is what the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* calls *hezhajia*—people today simply do not recognize it. The Buddha’s words are never false.\n\nCan tiles, stones, sand, and earth all be transformed into gold?",

      "translated_text": "From the *Chunzhu Jiven*, *Mengxi Bitan*, *Shuyi Zhi*, and *Sheshi Lu*, all mention tiles, stones, sand, and earth transforming into gold, while *Jiang Fei Lu* records ginger turning to gold, and *Qingyi Zhi* speaks of fern leaves becoming gold—yet these are not substances capable of transmutation. Moreover, the *Shangshu Gu Shi* notes bamboo-leaf gold, the *Kuiche Zhi* describes river-tea gold, the *Jianghuai Yiren Lu* tells of \"snow-clasped gold,\" the *Xuanshi Zhi* of \"urine gold,\" and the *Shuyi Zhi* of \"spittle silver.\" Do such things truly exist?\n\nThey are illusions—what is meant by \"illusion\"? Deception, monstrosity, falsehood, and absurdity. The *Mige Xiantan* speaks of \"iron-nail silver,\" the *Shenxian Ganyu Zhuan* of \"wrought-iron silver,\" the *Maoting Kehua* of \"copper-coin silver,\" and the *Kunshan Ji* of \"lead silver.\" As Shao Kangjie’s poem says: *\"Lead and tin, though guarded as gold, remain false.\"* I say: lead, tin, copper, and iron—all five metals—are indeed false in this sense, yet the principle of their transformation may hold truth. But tiles, stones, sand, and earth? Such things cannot transform. As for ginger, ferns, bamboo leaves, and river tea, if they cannot change, then no such principle exists. Even ginger and ferns retain some substance—what are snow, spittle, or urine? This is the height of absurdity.\n\nThe *Fangwai Zhi* by Zhuang Nianzu of Qingyuan states: A merchant from western Shu named Sun was transporting mercury to Chang’an. His porter stumbled on a plank bridge, striking a rock and breaking the pot. In haste, he stuffed the leak with grass from the roadside. By evening, when they reached an inn, the mercury in the pot had solidified. Sun realized it was the magical grass that had caused this and planned to gather more. He urged his servant to eat quickly, then drove the donkey back along the same path. As dusk fell, they crossed the bridge, but the donkey startled, lost its footing, and plunged into the Jialing River.\n\nHan Qinglao, in the *Nong He Yuan*, and He Yuan, in the *Chunzhu Jiven*, record that a monk named Fajian from Lin’an told of a Huizhou merchant traveling through the Qian Mountains who saw a bloated snake writhing in the grass. It slowly approached a certain plant, bit it open, and rubbed its belly against it. Soon, the swelling subsided, and the snake departed. The merchant thought this plant must be a remedy for swelling and poison, so he gathered some and placed it in his bag. That night, at an inn, he heard groaning from the next room. Upon inquiring, he learned the man suffered from abdominal distension. The merchant immediately brewed the grass into a decoction and gave it to him. Soon, the groaning ceased. By dawn, only the sound of dripping water could be heard. When he called out, there was no answer, so he rose to check—only to find the man’s flesh and blood had dissolved into water. He hastily grabbed his belongings and fled. The innkeeper, upon cleaning the pot to cook rice the next morning, found the entire vessel had turned to gold. He secretly buried the remains. After some time, when an amnesty was declared, the merchant returned to the inn and recounted the events to the innkeeper.\n\nGuo Yunyi’s *Jianghu Jiven* records that during the Jiatai era, a monk at Heshansi in Jizhou saw a snake struck and injured, its head and tail barely moving. Another snake coiled around it several times before departing. Soon after, the departing snake returned, holding a wild plant in its mouth, and covered the wound. Before long, the two snakes raised their heads and left together. Later, a young novice at the temple fell from a tree and broke his leg. The monk applied this plant to the wound, brewed a decoction to wash it, and had him rest in a quiet room. By morning, only bones remained—the flesh had completely rotted away. The pot used to boil the plant had turned to gold. The monk realized this herb could transmute iron into gold and kept its location secret. A local official, the prefect of Zhaozhou, heard of this and sent the monk lavish gifts, seeking the plant’s whereabouts. The monk refused to speak. The prefect then had the novice’s parents file a complaint, and the monk was imprisoned. A messenger told him, *\"If you do not reveal the plant, you will never leave.\"* The monk remained silent and died in prison. Though the prefect was cruel, the monk was also foolish.\n\nZhang Hua’s *Bowu Zhi* states: Liu De, while overseeing the imprisonment of the Prince of Huainan, obtained the *Hongbao Yuan* and *Mishu* from the prince’s pillow. He and his son Xiang both marveled at them, believing the alchemical arts of *huangbai* could succeed. Yet in the end, no proof emerged, and they were punished for this.\n\nThe *Taiping Guangji* records that at the end of the Sui dynasty, a Daoist lived on Mount Taibai, refining cinnabar to compound the Great Return Elixir. His attendant, Bi, served him for over a decade. Later, Bi left due to family mourning. The Daoist said, *\"You have been with me for so long, and now you face sorrow. I have nothing to give you, but here are ten elixir pills. One pill can transmute a jin of copper into gold—enough to arrange your funeral.\"* Bi returned home and did as instructed, using the gold to complete the rites. He then returned to the mountain to seek more elixir, but the Daoist refused. Bi drew his sword to threaten him but failed. He then tried to seize the Daoist’s hand, but still could not. Finally, he cut off the Daoist’s foot. The Daoist’s expression did not change. Enraged, Bi severed his head, then opened a red pouch at his right elbow—inside were elixir pills.\n\nBi took the elixir and transmuted much gold, but was reported for illicit alchemy. Emperor Taizong of Tang heard of this and summoned him to produce gold. Pleased, the emperor granted him a fifth-rank office. Bi made tens of thousands of jin of gold, but when the elixir was exhausted and his skill failed, he requested to leave. The emperor ordered him to record his method before departing. Bi pleaded, but the emperor, suspecting deceit, sent soldiers to detain him. Bi refused to disclose the method, so the soldiers cut off his hand. Still, he said nothing. They then cut off his foot. Bi recounted the whole story, but the emperor did not believe him and had him executed.\n\nHuang Xiufu of Jiangxia, in the *Maoting Kehua*, records that in the former Shu kingdom, there was a wine shop in Chengdu called *Liutiao*, named after its serving girl. She had been ill for over a year when a Daoist often came to drink on credit. The girl always served him attentively, so the Daoist left several elixir pills, saying they were to repay his debt. She took them as instructed and recovered her full health. Wang Daobin, a temple official from Jintang County in Han, learned of this and earnestly asked for the remaining medicine. He placed mercury in an iron pot, added the elixir, and heated it—soon, it turned to gold. He presented the elixir and gold to the King of Shu, who asked for the method. Wang replied, *\"There is a plant growing on Sanshue Mountain. I request to be appointed magistrate of Jintang to gather it.\"* The king granted his request. The next year, when the medicine failed to materialize, the king realized Wang had obtained the elixir from the girl and had him executed.\n\nPrefect Liu, named Chan, built a thatched hut on Mount Qingcheng. Some say he possessed the art of *huangbai*. One night, three men arrived with wine and fruit, seeking lodging. As they discussed alchemy, the conversation grew lively. One guest said, *\"We know you have the method of* huangbai*. Could you summarize it for us?\"* Liu initially refused, but the guests persisted. Finally, he grew angry: *\"If you must know tonight, I will tell you.\"* The guests said, *\"We sought you out as fellow Daoists, yet you press us so.\"* The three men rolled up their sleeves, glared, and said, *\"We are not gentlemen—we are thieves. If you do not reveal the method, we will harm you.\"* They drew their blades and threatened him. Liu and his wife, terrified, disclosed the method and gave them the remaining elixir. The three bowed and departed. At dawn, Liu descended the mountain and never returned. He later lived with the recluse Li Chen.",

      "translated_text": "The Master of Empty Formlessness, Fǎkōng, was the youngest son of Academician Shěn of Zháchuān. Once, at Jiaoshan Monastery, he spoke with the monk Fǎquán about transmutation. Quán said, *\"I possess a method to transmute copper into gold.\"* He scooped several coins from his pouch and ordered an empty crucible to be heated. Through the night, the copper failed to melt into liquid. Kōng cried out and questioned him. Quán laughed, *\"Those who obtain this see it as mere river sand—how would they know it is truly copper?\"* He then took a small amount of white powder and cast it in. The sand began to melt, and when drawn out and examined by firelight, it was pure gold.\n\nKōng [or *thereupon*] pressed him with increasing courtesy, earnestly requesting the method. Quán said, *\"I do not begrudge the method, but I have a past vow that makes me fear it would incite greed in reckless men, leading to calamity and bringing no true benefit to others. Let me tell you: In my twentieth year, I had no home and traveled with two Daoist companions. Together, we studied the elixir furnace. On the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of Shaosheng (1094), we said to one another, *'Our learning has not taken us far. Now we should part and wander for ten years, then meet again on this day at this place. Whoever fails to arrive on that day without encumbrance will be deemed to have perished on the Dao.'* We raised our cups and made the pact. The three dispersed—one to the Chuan and Xia regions, another to the capital and Luoyang, while I remained in the Two Zhe provinces.\n\nWhen the appointed time came, we gathered at Fengle Bridge in succession. Each produced the formulas and secrets we had obtained, comparing them. One method, the *Máo* technique, was somewhat simpler. We tested it, but the copper’s color did not fully transform. Another said, *'In Chengdu’s medicinal market, I encountered a strange man who gave me a \"halo-removing\" powder. He claimed it was extraordinary, but I had not yet tested it.'* We took it and refined it together, and the color deepened to a richer yellow. Thinking the powder insufficient, we decided to refine it again. When removed, it was true gold.\n\nWe conferred and said, *'The gold shops of the Man people in the capital are the finest in the world. If we go to sell it, there will be no doubt of its authenticity—this is truly an immortal’s art.'* Arriving in the capital, we took ten taels to the market and received a high price. At the time, we lodged together in the eastern guest quarters of Xiangguo Monastery. We made a hundred taels of gold to part ways, then bought mutton, imperial wine, and feasted raucously while smelting copper. Unexpectedly, the copper slag splashed and ignited a fire that spread to the roof. All three of us were drunk—one so inebriated he could not escape and burned to death; another was arrested, flogged, and died days later. Only I, barely sober, broke through the flames and fled. Fearing pursuit, I, who had long been skilled at swimming, plunged into the Bian River and drifted downstream. Only after passing the city gates did I climb ashore. While still in the water, I repented and prayed to Heaven, vowing to become a monk and never practice alchemy again. If I encounter a great karmic matter that cannot be accomplished, I will petition Heaven for aid—I dare not use even a hair’s worth of my own power, much less transmit it to others.\"*\n\nKōng, having heard his account, dared not press further. One day, Quán left without a word, and his whereabouts became unknown.\n\nHan Zǐcāng, the Academician, recounted: *\"A Daoist on Mount Qingcheng sent his young servant to buy wine for a patron. Midway, the boy hung the iron bottle he was carrying on a tree. The bottle was heavy, the branch weak, and the wind swayed it so that the leaves and twigs rubbed against the spot where it touched—all turned golden. From then on, he recognized the tree that transmuted gold. He traveled the world and never lacked for anything. Later, he lodged at Tianqing Abbey in Huazhou, too old and ill to go out. He wished to transmit his method but found no suitable recipient. Secretly observing an old man who sold rice before the abbey—who, regardless of famine or plenty, charged an annual interest of one coin, and whose conduct was consistent—he thought him trustworthy. One day, he summoned the old man to a tavern and confided his desire to pass on the method. The old man said, *'I have long been capable of this.'*\n\nThe Daoist said, *'Come to me tomorrow, and we will test it together.'* At dawn, the old man arrived. They barred the door and refined the elixir together. A fellow Daoist in the next room overheard and bored a hole in the wall to watch. He saw the two men alternately heating the elixir and pouring it onto the ground, where it gleamed as brilliant gold. They took turns admiring it, exclaiming in wonder. The observer then broke through the wall and entered. The two, caught off guard, could not gather their materials in time. A clamor arose as they fought over the gold, and in the end, both were crushed to death. The other Daoists were all implicated and imprisoned.\"*\n\nHé Fǎng said: *\"Of those who discuss elixir furnaces—scholar-officials and recluses who study the Dao—seven or eight out of ten delight in seeking such methods. Yet they do not realize these are all immortal medicines, mere precursors to the elixir. After the Three Mao Lords used cinnabar powder to transmute silver into gold and iron into silver to relieve famine during a poor harvest in Danyang (when corpses lined the roads), later generations named the method of refining powder to transmute copper the 'Danyang Method,' and the method of using arsenic to transmute copper the 'Transmutation Mao.' Examples like Wang Yang and Lou Jing of the Han, Cheng Bi of the Tang, and Wang Jie of recent times prove that such methods exist in the world. But those who obtain them are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns, and of those who practice them, eight or nine out of ten bring disaster upon themselves. The likes of Master Dongpo and Minister Yang Yuansu secretly received the formulas but, knowing the risks, did not practice them. Zhang Shen’gong and Huang Daofu, both high-ranking officials, spent their lives and fortunes seeking such methods but never encountered them.*\n\n*Xiahou Jiazhen, a Hanlin Academician, was fond of refining silver his entire life. He often said, *'If I could see even a single coin of mercury-silver, I would know how to draft imperial edicts for the rest of my days.'* Yet his wish was never fulfilled, and he died without success.*\n\n*During the Shaoxing era (1131–1162), a Daoist in the Huai frontier begged for alms, holding an iron ox and crying out, *'The Iron Ox Daoist is here!'* He wandered in Fuguang for months. One day, he entered a wealthy family’s treasury to beg for money. The master asked about the Iron Ox’s purpose. The Daoist replied, *'It can defecate gold nuggets.'* The master wished to exchange his wealth for it, but the Daoist refused. They finally agreed to rent it for one night, placing it in a secret chamber. The next morning, they opened the room to find several grains of gold nuggets. The Daoist arrived, took the Iron Ox, and left. The master, consumed by greed, sought out the Daoist to buy the ox. The Daoist resisted but eventually relented after much persuasion, agreeing to a price based on the daily yield of gold, to be paid over a year.\n\nAfter several days at home, the ox defecated gold as before. But afterward, it produced nothing. Examining the ox’s tail, they found a small hole but no other peculiarities. Suddenly, a maidservant in the household fell gravely ill. Her husband was summoned to ransom her. Tracing her whereabouts, they discovered the Daoist had secretly purchased the woman beforehand and hidden the gold in her possession. The gold nuggets had all been secretly placed by her. Once the scheme was complete, she was taken away. When pursued, the Daoist had already fled.\n\nFrom *Zhào Guànyuán’s Daily Records*:\n\n*Tattered hemp robes, a patched cloth skirt,*\n*Meeting people, he boasts of his silver-refining art.*\n*If you truly possess the silver-refining method,*\n*Why not refine silver to sustain yourself?*\n\nXú Qīng’s *Records of Worldly Experience* includes this verse as a warning to his youngest son: *\"Of the deluded who are misled by alchemists, beware—you must take heed.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "will tell you.\"* The guests said, *\"We sought you out as fellow Daoists, yet you press us so.\"* The three men rolled up their sleeves, glared, and said, *\"We are not gentlemen—we are thieves. If you do not reveal the method, we will harm you.\"* They drew their blades and threatened him. Liu and his wife, terrified, disclosed the method and gave them the remaining elixir. The three bowed and departed. At dawn, Liu descended the mountain and never returned. He later lived with the recluse Li Chen.",
