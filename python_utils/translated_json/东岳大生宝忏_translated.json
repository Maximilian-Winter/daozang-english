hindrance.\n\n**Declaration**\nWe have heard:\nBefore the primordial chaos divided, a single *qi* stretched boundlessly;\nOnce high and low were arrayed, the Three Powers took form.\nThe earth was divided into the Five Peaks, yet none held greater authority than Mount Tai.\nIt stands as the pillar of Qi and Lu, the guardian of the Horn and Neck constellations.\nIn the Yu dynasty, the royal hunt was marked by the solemnity of burnt offerings;\nIn the Zhou era, seasonal tours were honored with ritual gifts.\nIt has been revered beyond compare.\n\nWe humbly consider the Heavenly Equal Great Life Benevolent and Holy Emperor of the Eastern Peak.\nResponding to creation, He arose at the dawn of chaos;\nEstablished by yin and yang, He governs the vast expanse.\nHis years equal Heaven’s, His great virtue ever-growing.\nBenevolence begets benevolence, embodying the generative power of Qian;\nHoliness surpasses holiness, dwelling in the towering majesty of Mount Tai.\nHe presides over the East among the Five Directions, supreme in the Middle Realm among the Three Realms.\nEnacting Heaven’s decrees, He governs the netherworld.\nIn the Alabaster Pavilion and Stone Gate, His spirit abides in profound silence;\nWith golden tablets and jade registers, He knows the span of human lives.\nHe established seventy-five bureaus to wield authority;\nHe maintains thirty-six prisons to punish the wicked.\nEver securing the nation and sheltering the people,\nthe state offers sacrifices in due seasons, and all under Heaven come to pay homage in spring.\nPerceptive and upright, He grants every request;\nHis majestic *qi* and numinous power reach even the farthest realms.\nAll who pray are surely bathed in His compassion.\n\nThus, we purify our humble abode and establish this ritual of incense and flowers.\nWith bowed hands and reverent prostration, we gaze upon His august presence;\nWith devotion and sincerity, we seek to cleanse the sins of all beings.\nAs if He were present, we are moved and our prayers reach Him.\n\nThe assembly, with utmost devotion, chants praises in unison.\n\n**Chant**\nWe look up to the Heavenly Equal Benevolent and Holy Emperor,\nGreatest of the Five Peaks, Mount Tai as its foundation.\nHe governs the affairs of the world and humanity,\nHis *qi* concentrated in divine splendor, majestically dwelling in the East.\nLofty and vast is Mount Tai,\nits height of four thousand nine hundred *zhang* unmatched.\nIts summit is called the Peaceful Peak,\nwith the Self-Sacrifice Terrace and Jieqiu Peak.\nThe Hall of Benevolent Peace gleams with lapis lazuli,\nits crown and regalia resplendent at its heart.\nAncient emperors performed the feng and shan sacrifices,\nascending to report their achievements and inscribe their success.\nSeventy-two rulers are recorded,\nbeginning with the Yellow Emperor, who first received the honor.\nSteles remain, inscribed in Qin script;\nto the east lies the Pool of the Senior Officials and the Pine of the Great Master.\nThe Tang emperor carved an image of aloeswood;\nthe Song dynasty established the Hall of Meeting the True.\nIn our dynasty, unity brought heightened reverence,\nand the title \"Great Life\" was lavishly bestowed.\nUtmost benevolence and holiness, the people’s ultimate hope,\ntimely rain and sunshine ensure bountiful years.\nWith profound reverence, we bow and take refuge,\ngazing afar at the cloud-girded palace to honor His compassionate countenance.\n\nThe inconceivable merit of harmony is beyond thought.\nWe raise the Threefold Vows in reverence:\nVow and bow to the Highest Ninefold Qi, the Heavenly Worthy of Numinous Treasure in the East of the Central Heaven.\nVow and bow to the Highest Ninefold Qi, the Heavenly Worthy of the Azure Spirit, the Primordial Elder.\nVow and bow to the Highest Ninefold Qi, the Heavenly Worthy of the Eastern Florescence, the Supreme Minister.\n\nI have heard: the sacred peaks reside between *xun* and *gen*, presiding over judgment and examination; humanity dwells within *qian* and *kun*, and every action accumulates transgressions. The solemn records never fail to inscribe even the slightest detail. Prostrate in reflection, we repentant disciples, transient in this borrowed life, sheltered as human beings—our bodies and hair, skin and limbs, received from our parents; our ears and eyes, nose and mouth, completing our form and spirit—are the most numinous of all creatures, equally endowed with the essence of the Five Phases. Through years and months, days and hours, our faults and offenses pile high as mountains, while our virtuous thoughts fade like dew. The roots of sin are hard to extinguish; evil fills its measure with ease. Unaware of the path of expiation, ignorant of the way to confess, we ponder in silence: how can we justify ourselves? Now, in repentance, we examine our faults, humbly bowing to seek absolution.\n\nOn this auspicious day, we pour forth our sunflower sincerity. The censer burns with fragrant incense, the candles blaze with crimson flame. We strike the bell and chime the stone, their sounds harmonizing with the *Step-in-Emptiness* chant; we pour water and offer flowers, our rites never straying from sincerity. Our sacrifice emulates the simplicity of the Western neighbor; our prostrations are offered to the august presence of the Eastern Peak. May our past wrongs be redeemed, our karmic burdens dissolved. With reverence, we rely on repentance, beseeching forgiveness.\n\nThe assembly, devout in faith, takes refuge and offers praise.\nEach person reverently joins in unison, bowing once.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the sovereign of the Eastern Direction, who presides over the Azure Spirit’s treasury of purity on Mount Tai. His stone image stands in majestic dignity; jade tablets record his enfeoffment. His imperial title is bestowed with lavish praise: *Guangsheng*—\"Vast Life.\" From antiquity, his glory endures. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Guangsheng Emperor of Mount Tai, Azure Emperor of the Eastern Peak.**\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the One who embodies virtue and manifests benevolence, guardian of the Eastern Lands. Mount Tai is hailed as the foremost of peaks, ruling the Three Palaces of the Hollow Void; its sacred precinct is supreme, governing the court where gods and spirits are judged. Worship is exalted by imperial decree; his position presides over *Xuanxiao*. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the One who, from youth, left home to wander and seek instruction. He received the prophecy of the Supreme Heavenly Worthy and attained transcendence through Dao; he was granted the title of Controller of Destiny and joined the assembly of inspectors. Dwelling in the Office of Destiny on Mount Huo, he was enfeoffed as the Supreme Minister of Mount Tai. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Supreme Minister of the Nine Heavens, Controller of Destiny, Bestower of Blessings, Protector and Sage Perfected.**\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the One whose qi was nurtured by the mountain’s spirit, whose lineage flows from the celestial clan. Earth’s primal power merged with his virtue; he embodied filial piety and benevolence in full. The imperial dream foretold his noble birth, declaring his majesty and valor. As heir to the palace, he received the royal enfeoffment. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Supreme Hall, Most Sage, Majestic and Illustrious, Benevolent and Kind King.**\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Virtuous and Radiant August Empress of the Eastern Peak.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Great King of the Western Qi, Protector of the Realm.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Immortal Officials of the Blue-Green Cavern of the Hollow Void.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Vice-Regent Immortal Officials of Mount Changbai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Vice-Regent Immortal Officials of Mount Liangfu.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Marquis of Blessing and Protection, Divine Heir.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Marquis of Kindness and Numinosity, Divine Heir.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Great Master of Serene Discernment, Divine Heir.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Marquis of Manifest Numinosity, Divine Heir.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Transformation, Ruler of the Southern Peak.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Prosperity and Favorable Omens, Ruler of the Western Peak.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Truth and Mystic Sanctity, Ruler of the Northern Peak.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Tranquility and Exalted Sanctity, Ruler of the Central Peak.**\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Azure Mystery spreads its true array,\nthe primordial rank pervades the numinous.\nThe Fusang guards its entirety,\nthe firstborn engenders primordial flourishing.\nThe cinnabar grove scatters its radiance,\nnurturing essence and engendering flourishing.\nMerging with the mystic splendor,\nit subdues and restrains demonic hordes.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One who encompasses the Great East, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Foremost of the Sacred Peaks, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose height rivals the heavens, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose compassion is impartial, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One of vast and luminous embrace, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One who shelters all beings, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One who regards all with equal benevolence, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose wisdom makes him sagely, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose august title is Emperor, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\n\nThe rites completed, each kneels in reverence, taking refuge in repentance.\n\nWe, the assembly of devotees, with single-minded devotion take refuge in the divine, surrendering body and life to the **Guangsheng Emperor of Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor; the Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny of the Nine Heavens; the Most Sage Illustrious King; the divine lords of the court of Mount Tai, and all majestic numina.**\n\nI have heard: though the mountain’s true form stands immutable in its majestic stability, our bodies are but grand illusions—how could we avoid missteps in our conduct? We humbly beseech the sagely compassion to bestow its vast grace, showering boundless mercy.\n\nIn repentance this day, we, the faithful, since time immemorial, since our birth, have borne the heavens and trodden the earth, embraced yin and carried yang, dwelling like ants in clusters, busying ourselves like flies. In our comings and goings, not a single good deed is recorded; in our rising and resting, a hundred transgressions accumulate unnoticed.\n\nAt times, we have offended the multitude of sages; at others, exposed ourselves shamelessly beneath the Three Luminaries. We have acted contrary to ritual and moved against righteousness. Racing grand carriages and fine steeds along the paths of fame and profit; donning fine linen and light furs, indulging in excess beyond all measure of splendor. Our conduct has been full of secrecy and perversity, our pursuits beyond what is proper. We have received this single form yet remain ignorant of the Three Reflections. Thus, transgressions accumulate, boundless and immeasurable.\n\nWe humbly beseech the multitude of sages to bestow their grace, the host of Perfected to confer their blessings. Extending benevolence to all things, may they untangle the entanglements of bodily karma; preserving life and prolonging years, may they shatter the mountain of our sins. We further pray that this vast response may extend equally to all living beings.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow our heads in reverence, offering thanks to the Most Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Dao.\n\n**The Most Sagely Treasure of the Dao, Heavenly Worthy**\nWe take refuge in the Supreme Dao, honored in the Three Realms of Great Purity.\nIn repentance, all faithful,\nMay the transgressions of bodily karma be dissolved.\nThe four wrongs all eradicated,\nSeeing goodness, we daily transform.\nIf we examine ourselves without cease,\nFortune and blessings will naturally extend our years.\n\n**Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Bodily Karma**\n*Incantation*\nVirtue flourishes in wood,\nCorresponding above to the Year Star.\nAncestor of the Five Peaks,\nGrandchild of the Heavenly Emperor.\nThe sun resides in the East,\nGateway of Heaven.\nMists swirl in abundance,\nJoyful qi intermingles in harmony.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nIn the eastern image of the sun—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nRevered by the Four Peaks—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nVast and boundless as Heaven—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nThe Nine Qi conjoined as one—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nGreat and transformative—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nLoving life and hating killing—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nRadiant with kindness and benevolence—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nWise, enlightened, sagely, and intelligent—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nUnited with Earth as Emperor—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\n\nHaving completed the rites, we each kneel in reverence, taking refuge and repenting.\n\nWe, the assembled faithful, with devoted hearts take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life:\nThe Lord Controller of Vast Life of Mount Tai, the Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor;\nThe Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny of the Nine Heavens;\nThe Most Sage Illustrious King;\nThe divine lords of the court of Mount Tai, and all majestic numina.\n\nWe have heard: as the mountain anchors the rivers and peaks, wondrously silent and scentless; yet when the mouth speaks, often what is right becomes wrong. We humbly beseech the sagely compassion to bestow its vast grace, showering boundless mercy.\n\nIn repentance this day, we, since former lives until now, have indulged in ornate speech and clever words, sharp tongues and harsh voices, boastful discourse and lofty talk, wild singing and reckless laughter. Immersed in wine and intoxication, we have pursued pleasure without restraint; consuming meat and fish, we have deemed delicacies insufficient. At times, we have berated the wind and scolded the rain; at others, resented the heat and lamented the cold.\n\nIn repentance, we recall that since our birth until today, the six senses have clashed, the seven emotions have gone unchecked. Cunning calculations arise, and greed runs rampant. Desires have roamed unbridled, indulging in excess without measure; virtue has been forgotten in favor of wealth and rank. We have committed every manner of depravity, perversity, and extravagance; anger, fear, and dread have led us astray. We have concealed our own faults while undermining others’ strengths. Envious of the worthy and resentful of the capable, we have obscured our spiritual terrace, remaining unaware. We have bullied the lonely and weak, believing the darkness of our chambers could conceal our deeds. Mixing falsehood with truth, we have embraced the new while forgetting the old. Our hearts, benighted, have failed to awaken to the Nine Contemplations. Thus, grievances have multiplied, beyond naming or recounting.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Sagely Emperor to bestow compassion, the Perfected Spirits to perceive with clarity. Above, may they fulfill the intent of benevolence, pardoning the transgressions of our mental karma; below, may they satisfy human desires, bringing joy as radiant as the spring terrace. We further pray that this vast blessing may extend equally to all living beings.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow our heads in reverence, offering thanks to the Most Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Scriptures.\n\n**The Most Sagely Treasure of the Scriptures, Heavenly Worthy**\nWe take refuge in the Supreme Scriptures, honored in the Thirty-Six Sections.\nIn repentance, all faithful,\nMay the transgressions of mental karma be dissolved.\nEver pure and ever still,\nDesires naturally do not arise.\nWithin and without, both chaste and bright,\nMay we forever preserve the tranquility of the Dao-mind.\n\n**Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Mental Karma**\n*Incantation*\nMajestic Mount Tai,\nGovernor of all spirits.\nReceiving Heaven’s bright mandate,\nOverseer of human relations.\nIts position is in the East,\nIts virtue is benevolence.\nAll things rely on it to begin,\nIts merit aids the living.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nFlourishing in the East—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nForemost of the Five Peaks—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nSpiritual as Heaven itself—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nTransformative and unified—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nAble to accomplish greatness—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nCoexisting with life—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nManifesting benevolence, concealing utility—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nThus sagely, thus benevolent—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nEmperor through virtue—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\n\nHaving completed the rites, we each kneel in reverence, taking refuge and repenting.\n\nWe, the assembled faithful, with utmost devotion take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life:\nThe Lord Controller of Vast Life of Mount Tai, the Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor;\nThe Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny of the Nine Heavens;\nThe Most Sage Illustrious King;\nThe divine lords of the court of Mount Tai, and all majestic numina.\n\nWe have heard: the mountain stabilizes the rivers and peaks, wondrously silent and scentless; yet when the mouth speaks, often what is right becomes wrong. We humbly beseech the sagely compassion to bestow its vast grace, showering boundless mercy.\n\nIn repentance, we recall that since former lives until now, we have indulged in ornate speech and clever words, sharp tongues and harsh voices, boastful discourse and lofty talk, wild singing and reckless laughter. Immersed in wine and intoxication, we have pursued pleasure without restraint; consuming meat and fish, we have deemed delicacies insufficient. At times, we have berated the wind and scolded the rain; at others, resented the heat and lamented the cold.\n\nWe have scorned the Dao, flattered the gods, belittled the Confucians, and slandered the Buddhist teachings. With a three-inch tongue, we have sowed discord among the six relations; with a single deceitful heart, we have stirred strife between two parties. Our ornate words have deluded the masses; our boasts of wealth have humiliated the poor. Ever relying on glib tongues, we have seldom heeded the caution of sealing our lips. Our accumulated transgressions run deep, and even washing our hair would fail to count them all.\n\nWe humbly beseech the sagely Emperor to show compassion, the true numina to take pity. May your virtuous decrees be proclaimed, that our oral karmic offenses may be cleansed; may the realm attain purity and peace, and the sound of teachings gradually spread. We further pray for your vast blessings to extend equally to all sentient beings.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow our heads in reverence, offering homage to the Supreme and Rightly Enlightened Master Treasure.\n\nGreat Sage Master Treasure, Heavenly Worthy,\nWe take refuge in the Supreme Master, revered by humans and gods alike.\nIn repentance, all faithful,\nPray to dissolve the transgressions of speech.\nLike a sealed jar, guard well,\nA single word worth a thousand gold.\nWhen words are full yet faults are none,\nAll becomes pure and tranquil sound.\n\nMerciful Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Oral Karma,\nWe circumambulate in the void, treading the cloud-net,\nScattering flowers.\n\nWe have heard: whether one does good or evil, it is surely not concealed from the divine; whether fortune or misfortune descends, each is governed by its respective office. Within the six directions, all things great and small, every being with form and qi, are all under their jurisdiction. There are officials to record merits and transgressions, to oversee life, death, and registration. They govern both the unseen and the manifest, administering the affairs of people and all creatures.\n\nNow, we repentant faithful, dwelling in the dusty world with mortal roots, have in times past seen what is right yet failed to act; deemed small evils harmless and thus not abandoned them. These have brewed into manifold sins, and we fear a hundred calamities. Relying on utmost sincerity, we look up and pray for your great response, to guide us toward future blessings and atone for past transgressions.\n\nWith bowed heads, we take refuge and reverently pay homage.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Left and Right Two Chancellors.\nWith devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Two Great Saints, Zhang and Kang.\nWith devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Manifest and Responsive Thousand Saints and Lesser Kings.\nWith devoted hearts, we pay homage to Lady Yongjia.\nWith devoted hearts, we pay homage to the Jade Immortal Lady.\nWith devoted hearts,

The solemn records never fail to inscribe even the slightest detail. Prostrate in reflection, we repentant disciples, transient in this borrowed life, sheltered as human beings—our bodies and hair, skin and limbs, received from our parents; our ears and eyes, nose and mouth, completing our form and spirit—are the most numinous of all creatures, equally endowed with the essence of the Five Phases. Through years and months, days and hours, our faults and offenses pile high as mountains, while our virtuous thoughts fade like dew. The roots of sin are hard to extinguish; evil fills its measure with ease. Unaware of the path of expiation, ignorant of the way to confess, we ponder in silence: how can we justify ourselves? Now, in repentance, we examine our faults, humbly bowing to seek absolution.\n\nOn this auspicious day, we pour forth our sunflower sincerity. The censer burns with fragrant incense, the candles blaze with crimson flame. We strike the bell and chime the stone, their sounds harmonizing with the *Step-in-Emptiness* chant; we pour water and offer flowers, our rites never straying from sincerity. Our sacrifice emulates the simplicity of the Western neighbor; our prostrations are offered to the august presence of the Eastern Peak. May our past wrongs be redeemed, our karmic burdens dissolved. With reverence, we rely on repentance, beseeching forgiveness.\n\nThe assembly, devout in faith, takes refuge and offers praise.\nEach person reverently joins in unison, bowing once.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the sovereign of the Eastern Direction, who presides over the Azure Spirit’s treasury of purity on Mount Tai. His stone image stands in majestic dignity; jade tablets record his enfeoffment. His imperial title is bestowed with lavish praise: *Guangsheng*—\"Vast Life.\" From antiquity, his glory endures. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Guangsheng Emperor of Mount Tai, Azure Emperor of the Eastern Peak.**\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the One who embodies virtue and manifests benevolence, guardian of the Eastern Lands. Mount Tai is hailed as the foremost of peaks, ruling the Three Palaces of the Hollow Void; its sacred precinct is supreme, governing the court where gods and spirits are judged. Worship is exalted by imperial decree; his position presides over *Xuanxiao*. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the One who, from youth, left home to wander and seek instruction. He received the prophecy of the Supreme Heavenly Worthy and attained transcendence through Dao; he was granted the title of Controller of Destiny and joined the assembly of inspectors. Dwelling in the Office of Destiny on Mount Huo, he was enfeoffed as the Supreme Minister of Mount Tai. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Supreme Minister of the Nine Heavens, Controller of Destiny, Bestower of Blessings, Protector and Sage Perfected.**\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the One whose qi was nurtured by the mountain’s spirit, whose lineage flows from the celestial clan. Earth’s primal power merged with his virtue; he embodied filial piety and benevolence in full. The imperial dream foretold his noble birth, declaring his majesty and valor. As heir to the palace, he received the royal enfeoffment. Great Compassion, Great Vow, Great Sage, Great Mercy—**Supreme Hall, Most Sage, Majestic and Illustrious, Benevolent and Kind King.**\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Virtuous and Radiant August Empress of the Eastern Peak.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Great King of the Western Qi, Protector of the Realm.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Immortal Officials of the Blue-Green Cavern of the Hollow Void.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Vice-Regent Immortal Officials of Mount Changbai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Vice-Regent Immortal Officials of Mount Liangfu.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Marquis of Blessing and Protection, Divine Heir.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Marquis of Kindness and Numinosity, Divine Heir.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Great Master of Serene Discernment, Divine Heir.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Marquis of Manifest Numinosity, Divine Heir.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Transformation, Ruler of the Southern Peak.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Prosperity and Favorable Omens, Ruler of the Western Peak.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Truth and Mystic Sanctity, Ruler of the Northern Peak.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **August Emperor of Great Tranquility and Exalted Sanctity, Ruler of the Central Peak.**\n\n**Incantation:**\nThe Azure Mystery spreads its true array,\nthe primordial rank pervades the numinous.\nThe Fusang guards its entirety,\nthe firstborn engenders primordial flourishing.\nThe cinnabar grove scatters its radiance,\nnurturing essence and engendering flourishing.\nMerging with the mystic splendor,\nit subdues and restrains demonic hordes.\n\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One who encompasses the Great East, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **Foremost of the Sacred Peaks, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose height rivals the heavens, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose compassion is impartial, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One of vast and luminous embrace, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One who shelters all beings, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One who regards all with equal benevolence, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose wisdom makes him sagely, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\nWith single-minded devotion, we bow in homage to the **One whose august title is Emperor, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor of Mount Tai.**\n\nThe rites completed, each kneels in reverence, taking refuge in repentance.\n\nWe, the assembly of devotees, with single-minded devotion take refuge in the divine, surrendering body and life to the **Guangsheng Emperor of Mount Tai, Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sage Emperor; the Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny of the Nine Heavens; the Most Sage Illustrious King; the divine lords of the court of Mount Tai, and all majestic numina.**\n\nI have heard: though the mountain’s true form stands immutable in its majestic stability, our bodies are but grand illusions—how could we avoid missteps in our conduct? We humbly beseech the sagely compassion to bestow its vast grace, showering boundless mercy.\n\nIn repentance this day, we, the faithful, since time immemorial, since our birth, have borne the heavens and trodden the earth, embraced yin and carried yang, dwelling like ants in clusters, busying ourselves like flies. In our comings and goings, not a single good deed is recorded; in our rising and resting, a hundred transgressions accumulate unnoticed.",

      "translated_text": "At times, we have offended the multitude of sages; at others, exposed ourselves shamelessly beneath the Three Luminaries. We have acted contrary to ritual and moved against righteousness. Racing grand carriages and fine steeds along the paths of fame and profit; donning fine linen and light furs, indulging in excess beyond all measure of splendor. Our conduct has been full of secrecy and perversity, our pursuits beyond what is proper. We have received this single form yet remain ignorant of the Three Reflections. Thus, transgressions accumulate, boundless and immeasurable.\n\nWe humbly beseech the multitude of sages to bestow their grace, the host of Perfected to confer their blessings. Extending benevolence to all things, may they untangle the entanglements of bodily karma; preserving life and prolonging years, may they shatter the mountain of our sins. We further pray that this vast response may extend equally to all living beings.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow our heads in reverence, offering thanks to the Most Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Dao.\n\n**The Most Sagely Treasure of the Dao, Heavenly Worthy**\nWe take refuge in the Supreme Dao, honored in the Three Realms of Great Purity.\nIn repentance, all faithful,\nMay the transgressions of bodily karma be dissolved.\nThe four wrongs all eradicated,\nSeeing goodness, we daily transform.\nIf we examine ourselves without cease,\nFortune and blessings will naturally extend our years.\n\n**Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Bodily Karma**\n*Incantation*\nVirtue flourishes in wood,\nCorresponding above to the Year Star.\nAncestor of the Five Peaks,\nGrandchild of the Heavenly Emperor.\nThe sun resides in the East,\nGateway of Heaven.\nMists swirl in abundance,\nJoyful qi intermingles in harmony.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nIn the eastern image of the sun—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nRevered by the Four Peaks—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nVast and boundless as Heaven—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nThe Nine Qi conjoined as one—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nGreat and transformative—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nLoving life and hating killing—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nRadiant with kindness and benevolence—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nWise, enlightened, sagely, and intelligent—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nUnited with Earth as Emperor—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\n\nHaving completed the rites, we each kneel in reverence, taking refuge and repenting.\n\nWe, the assembled faithful, with devoted hearts take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life:\nThe Lord Controller of Vast Life of Mount Tai, the Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor;\nThe Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny of the Nine Heavens;\nThe Most Sage Illustrious King;\nThe divine lords of the court of Mount Tai, and all majestic numina.\n\nWe have heard: as the mountain anchors the rivers and peaks, wondrously silent and scentless; yet when the mouth speaks, often what is right becomes wrong.

Immersed in wine and intoxication, we have pursued pleasure without restraint; consuming meat and fish, we have deemed delicacies insufficient. At times, we have berated the wind and scolded the rain; at others, resented the heat and lamented the cold.\n\nIn repentance, we recall that since our birth until today, the six senses have clashed, the seven emotions have gone unchecked. Cunning calculations arise, and greed runs rampant. Desires have roamed unbridled, indulging in excess without measure; virtue has been forgotten in favor of wealth and rank. We have committed every manner of depravity, perversity, and extravagance; anger, fear, and dread have led us astray. We have concealed our own faults while undermining others’ strengths. Envious of the worthy and resentful of the capable, we have obscured our spiritual terrace, remaining unaware. We have bullied the lonely and weak, believing the darkness of our chambers could conceal our deeds. Mixing falsehood with truth, we have embraced the new while forgetting the old. Our hearts, benighted, have failed to awaken to the Nine Contemplations. Thus, grievances have multiplied, beyond naming or recounting.\n\nWe humbly beseech the Sagely Emperor to bestow compassion, the Perfected Spirits to perceive with clarity. Above, may they fulfill the intent of benevolence, pardoning the transgressions of our mental karma; below, may they satisfy human desires, bringing joy as radiant as the spring terrace. We further pray that this vast blessing may extend equally to all living beings.\n\nWith devoted hearts, we bow our heads in reverence, offering thanks to the Most Supreme Treasure of the Perfect Scriptures.\n\n**The Most Sagely Treasure of the Scriptures, Heavenly Worthy**\nWe take refuge in the Supreme Scriptures, honored in the Thirty-Six Sections.\nIn repentance, all faithful,\nMay the transgressions of mental karma be dissolved.\nEver pure and ever still,\nDesires naturally do not arise.\nWithin and without, both chaste and bright,\nMay we forever preserve the tranquility of the Dao-mind.\n\n**Heavenly Worthy Who Dissolves Mental Karma**\n*Incantation*\nMajestic Mount Tai,\nGovernor of all spirits.\nReceiving Heaven’s bright mandate,\nOverseer of human relations.\nIts position is in the East,\nIts virtue is benevolence.\nAll things rely on it to begin,\nIts merit aids the living.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nFlourishing in the East—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nForemost of the Five Peaks—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nSpiritual as Heaven itself—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nTransformative and unified—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nAble to accomplish greatness—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nCoexisting with life—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nManifesting benevolence, concealing utility—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nThus sagely, thus benevolent—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\nWith devoted hearts, we bow and worship:\nEmperor through virtue—\nThe Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor of Mount Tai.\n\nHaving completed the rites, we each kneel in reverence, taking refuge and repenting.\n\nWe, the assembled faithful, with utmost devotion take refuge in body, take refuge in spirit, take refuge in life:\nThe Lord Controller of Vast Life of Mount Tai, the Heavenly Equal, Great Life, Benevolent and Sagely Emperor;\nThe Perfected Lord Controller of Destiny of the Nine Heavens;\nThe Most Sage Illustrious King;\nThe divine lords of the court of Mount Tai, and all majestic numina.\n\nWe have heard: the mountain stabilizes the rivers and peaks, wondrously silent and scentless; yet when the mouth speaks, often what is right becomes wrong.

With a three-inch tongue, we have sowed discord among the six relations; with a single deceitful heart, we have stirred strife between two parties. Our ornate words have deluded the masses; our boasts of wealth have humiliated the poor. Ever relying on glib tongues, we have seldom heeded the caution of sealing our lips. Our accumulated transgressions run deep, and even washing our hair would fail to count them all.\n\nWe humbly beseech the sagely Emperor to show compassion, the true numina to take pity. May your virtuous decrees be proclaimed, that our oral karmic offenses may be cleansed; may the realm attain purity and peace, and the sound of teachings gradually spread.

They govern both the unseen and the manifest, administering the affairs of people and all creatures.\n\nNow, we repentant faithful, dwelling in the dusty world with mortal roots, have in times past seen what is right yet failed to act; deemed small evils harmless and thus not abandoned them.
