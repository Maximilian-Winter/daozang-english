  "full_translation": "**Preface to the Memorial Presenting the *Taishang Ganying Pian***\n\nYour servant, in his humble words, reveres the profound and venerable Dao, deeply admiring the sagely maxims of the Most High. With the carving of the woodblocks now complete, this long-held wish of your servant is fortunately fulfilled. Presumptuously, I dare to present this before Your August Ears, humbly repaying a fraction of Your boundless grace.\n\nWith trepidation and awe, I bow my head again and again.\n\nI have observed that among the treasured scriptures of the sacred canon, there exists a great teaching of jade-like elegance—rooted in compassion to save all beings, it repeatedly instructs humanity with earnestness. It declares that the causes of good and evil responses arise like the pivot of a mechanism, while the principles of fortune and misfortune manifest more swiftly than shadow follows form. Its twelve hundred earnest words and countless ages of luminous admonitions require the elucidation of wise rulers to guide the multitude toward return and devotion.\n\nOur August Emperor, in serene governance and morning audience, has illuminated the classics with diligent study. Though his mastery is devoted to the Six Classics, his inquiry extends broadly to all texts. He seeks the subtle and profound, following in the footsteps of his sagely ancestors’ quests; his transformative influence flows with purity, surpassing even the standards of the Han emperors of old. In the leisure between state affairs, he delights in pondering the interplay of Heaven and humanity, intending to propagate and transmit this work for posterity. Thus, he has compiled and refined it with care. Its solemn admonitions, like eight characters of black pearls, crown the text; its sweet and measured praises, wielded by a master’s brush, distinguish it as a singular achievement. How radiant is the splendor of this treasury! How honored is the favor bestowed upon cap and robe!\n\nYour servant, insignificant and unrefined, is unworthy—how could I presume to serve in the bamboo palace or allow my name to sully the imperial court? Yet, having once been elevated within the teaching’s ranks, I now dare to presume upon Your Sagacious Decree. Commanded with the honor of receiving imperial gold, I was entrusted with overseeing the engraving of the plates. I vow to exhaust my meager strength in humble repayment of this private devotion.\n\nReflecting upon my late father, I have ever feared the neglect of this text; yet, by some twist of fate, the fire that spared it has only further illuminated the Dao. With the transcription and carving now complete, I reverently seal and present it.\n\nI humbly beseech Your Imperial Majesty to deign to glance upon it, then widely promulgate it to the four directions. May all the people turn toward goodness and joyfully follow its teachings, so that this book may serve as an aid to uphold the world—thus fulfilling the role of both sovereign and teacher.\n\nYour servant respectfully presents the printed edition of the *Taishang Ganying Pian*, inscribed with Your Majesty’s title, in eight volumes, accompanying this memorial.\n\nWith trepidation and awe, I bow my head again and again, and respectfully submit these words.\n\nOn a day in the eighth month of the sixth year of the Shaoding era,\nYour servant Hu Yingwei, Supervisor of the Teaching on the Right Street, and Attendant for Ritual Offerings at the Taiyi Palace, respectfully memorializes.\n\n**The *Taishang Ganying Pian*, Volume Two**\nTransmitted by Li Changling, with Eulogies by Zheng Qingzhi.\n\nLoyalty and Filial Piety.\nThe *Tradition* states: The Eastern Minister of Destiny declares: Some possess talents surpassing Xiao and Miao, their aspirations towering above the multitude, nurturing their vast and unyielding qi while scorning wealth and rank. Others attain the utmost integrity and incorruptibility, refusing food or clothing not rightfully theirs—neither ostentation nor the allure of ten thousand chariots can sway their steadfast virtue or tarnish their noble conduct. Still others inherit blessings from ancestors of merit, their legacy flowing to descendants, refined through generations until their lineage is transformed and reborn. All such individuals meet the criteria for transcendence and are destined to ascend among the ranks of immortals. Yet they must pass through many years before gradually advancing.\n\nAs for those of perfect loyalty and perfect filial piety, should they depart this world today, they shall be appointed as Earthly Governors by tomorrow, and from that office, they shall swiftly ascend to the celestial ranks. Generally speaking, loyalty is the cardinal virtue of a minister, just as filial piety is the fundamental duty of a child. If all ministers were disloyal, what could a ruler expect of them? If all children were unfilial, what could a father hope for from them? In such a world, the bonds of ruler and minister, father and child, would utterly collapse—humanity would differ little from beasts or barbarians.\n\nHow lamentable that they fail to recognize loyalty and filial piety as the very foundation of transcendence, the swiftest path to liberation from the mortal realm! Have you not heard the tales of Master Lü’s instruction or the covenant of Master Lan? Long ago, Master Lü served as Censor-in-Chief, his stern countenance and forthright speech shaking the court and the realm. One day, as he sat alone, a green-clad attendant appeared and presented him with an elixir, saying: “This is the Cooling Elixir. The August Emperor will soon journey south to the fiery lands, and He has charged you with rectifying the ranks of immortals there. As those regions are scorching, He first bestows this upon you.” Master Lü bowed twice and swallowed the pill, its coolness like ice and snow sliding down his throat. Soon after, he indeed departed this world.\n\nAt that time, Zhu Mingfu had just passed the imperial examination and, while by the Xiang River, encountered the Master. The Master rode a deer with jade-like antlers, flanked by young attendants in green, with hundreds of officials and soldiers clearing the way before and behind. Mingfu stepped forward and bowed, asking: \"Have you already attained immortality?\" The Master replied: \"I now accompany the August Emperor on His southern journey. With no time for leisurely discourse, I shall recite a poem:\n\n*By chance my merits were inscribed in jade towers high,*\n*While countless robed ones lie buried ‘neath the dust.*\n*Now following the Emperor as inspector of the ranks,*\n*Who else remains to stand guard at the Cypress Terrace?*\n\nWith these words, he vanished from sight.\n\nThe Lan family was rooted in filial piety and fraternal love, with over a hundred mouths to feed, yet all lived in harmony, never exchanging harsh words. One evening, a perfected being descended from the Dipper and declared: \"I am the Filial Piety King of the Northern Dipper. When filial devotion reaches Heaven, the sun and moon shine brighter; when it reaches Earth, grasses and trees flourish; when it reaches mankind, the kingly Way is fulfilled. Your filial piety has drawn my gaze—having met me, you are certain to attain the Dao.\" And so it came to pass.\n\nThus, utmost loyalty and filial devotion—how swiftly they hasten one’s transcendence of the mortal realm! Alas, if loyalty and filial piety yield such rewards, what fate awaits those who lack them?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWithout loyalty, there is no lord;\nWithout filial piety, there are no kin.\nAbandon these two, and one is but a beast, not human.\nZhuang Zhou roamed free, yet still honored duty;\nThe Śākya school embraced emptiness, yet diligently repaid kindness.\nBeneath Heaven and upon Earth, who can escape these bonds?\n*Fraternal love.*\n\n**Tradition states:** The *Analects* records: \"The noble person attends to the root; when the root is established, the Dao arises. Is filial piety not the very root of benevolence?\" The Envoys of the Controller of Destiny regard father and son, elder and younger brothers, and husband and wife as the Three Bonds. Root and bond—though the terms differ, their meaning is one. If one discards the root and abandons the bonds, how can human relations stand?\n\nIn general, those who practice these virtues in truth ensure harmony between high and low, unchanging and steadfast. But those who merely pay lip service invite regret and offense, leading inevitably to transgression.\n\nLong ago, Yao Qiyun’s family was not wealthy, relying solely on farming and sericulture. When he was three, his father, having no son, took his elder brother’s place in distant garrison duty and died at the frontier. After his father’s death, Qiyun retrieved his spirit for burial, built a hut by the grave, and mourned for the rest of his life. The county magistrate, Su Che, donated his salary to buy land, opened paths, and erected a stele to commemorate the deed. The prefect, Hun Jian, reported the matter to the throne. An imperial edict praised and rewarded him, honoring his gate, naming his village \"Filial Piety,\" its altar \"Loyalty and Righteousness,\" and its lane \"Love and Respect.\" From Qiyun’s time onward, for fifteen generations, hundreds lived together for over three hundred years, never uttering a discordant word. Even through the upheavals of the Five Dynasties, descendants guarded the ancestral tombs, never scattering. There was also Zhang Cheng, a farmer whose family lived together for generations, numbering over a hundred and seventy. Within and without, all lived in harmony, never exchanging harsh words. Clothing and the like had no fixed owners. Each morning, the family elder sat in the hall while descendants lined up below, receiving their duties in turn, all diligent and reverent. From his ancestor Guan to Cheng, six generations lived together for nearly two hundred years, ever constant. Alas! These two families were truly what is meant by \"practicing in truth.\"\n\nCould those who merely value empty literary forms ever achieve the like?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe bodies of father and mother\ndivide into brothers.\nFrom one root they emerge—\nhow could there be different bodies?\nCherish the branches and leaves\nto protect the root and trunk.\nHistory mocks the bean and winnowing basket,\nwhile the *Book of Songs* sings of the *tangdi* flower.\nLike panpipes and flutes in harmony,\nthe spirit fosters kindness and joy.\nRectify yourself to transform others.\n\nThe *Tradition* records Confucius saying:\n“The noble person rectifies his robes and cap.”\nAnd again:\n“If the mat is not straight, he does not sit.”\nAlas! If even robes, caps, mats, and seats\nmust be made correct,\nhow much more one’s own conduct?\n\nIt further says:\n“If the leader acts with rectitude,\nwho would dare not follow?”\nAnd:\n“If one cannot rectify oneself,\nhow can one rectify others?”\nThese are the great principles\nby which the sages governed their conduct.\nThus, in governing oneself,\nhow could one not be rectified?\nOnly when rectified\ndo all people respect one.\nWhere people know respect,\ntheir hearts are already transformed—\nwhat need is there for petty efforts to change them?\n\nIn former times, Sima Wengong\nwas a man of upright integrity,\nhis name renowned throughout the land.\nWhen he resided in Luoyang,\nthe customs of the place were wholly transformed.\nAll esteemed the teachings of names and propriety,\nno longer urgently pursuing wealth and profit.\nPeople, whether rich or poor,\nwere content with their lot.\nThe young and latecomers knew awe for moral integrity.\nWhen they wished to do something,\nthey would warn one another, saying:\n“Do no evil, lest Sima Duanming learn of it.”\n\nLü Shengong was upright and outspoken,\nhis influence shaking the court and the realm.\nAt the time, Wang Anshi was appointed governor of Changzhou.\nHe sent a letter to Shengong, saying:\n“I have been a guest in the capital for two years,\nand in this time, my faults and flaws\nhave accumulated in my heart,\noften overwhelming me.\nBut when I visit elders,\nI am suddenly calmed and return to myself.\nThe bearing of a virtuous person\ndissolves all ill intent.”\n\nNow, in Huishu, I encountered Master Lü of Yingyang, whose heart and Dao were profoundly aligned, his mind serene and unclouded. When he served as lecturer at Chongzheng Hall, he daily expounded the teachings of rectifying the heart and cultivating the self, exhorting and guiding the sovereign. He often declared: “If one’s self is cultivated and heart upright, no other arts are needed, and the realm will naturally transform.” Thus, wherever he resided, the restless were transformed, and those who heard his influence, though shallow, became steadfast.\n\nWhen Hu Gongyuan served as professor in the two prefectures of Su and Hu, each time he explained the classics and reached a crucial principle, he earnestly urged his students to first govern themselves before governing others. “Then, gentlemen,” he would ask, “how do you rectify yourselves? By this, who would not be transformed?”\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen the standard is upright, its shadow is straight;\nwhen the source is pure, its streams run clear.\nTo bend oneself while straightening others—\nthere is no such principle in all the world.\nWhat art do sages and worthies possess?\nThey simply apply to others what they first apply to themselves.\nTo punish others for one’s own flaws—\neven an army would gnash its teeth in scorn.\n\n*The Great Learning* teaches: cultivate the self, order the household, govern the state.\n**Pity the orphan.**\nAs the *Record* says: “The orphan is one who has not yet achieved maturity when parents pass early. Some lose their mother while the father remarries, or lose their father while the mother takes another husband. Worst of all are those who lose both parents, left alone and exposed—how unbearable their plight! Though a royal decree commands care, with fosterers providing food, clothing, and shelter, even the most compassionate guardian cannot match the tender love of true parents. How can one not pity them?”\n\nYet the world sees only the lowly status of orphans and scorns them, unaware that some, though orphaned, grow into greatness. Of old, Zhang Denggong Shixun lost both parents in infancy. As he grew, he endured poverty, studying tirelessly without respite, and ultimately passed the imperial examinations, rising to the rank of grand councilor, renowned for his virtue. Was this not an orphan of the poorest means who forged his own path and became a vessel of greatness?\n\nLü Zhongcheng lost his father in childhood, yet roused himself to study, refusing frivolous friendships. Few in Luoyang knew him. Only after passing the examinations did people learn he was the grandson of Lü Zhengdui, and he later held high office, famed for his integrity. Was this not an orphan of noble birth who forged his own path and became a vessel of greatness?\n\nIf so, how can orphans be scorned? Though this section is titled “Pity the Orphan,” I have not merely written of pity but recorded these examples to show that those unfortunate enough to be orphaned may take them as models and strive for self-improvement.\n\nThe foregoing speaks of pitying orphans, yet the elders of old regarded such conduct as ordinary, never deeming it extraordinary. When Scholar Cha of the Dragon Diagram Bureau was impoverished, he gathered and supported the lonely and destitute among his kin, spending all his salary and stipends as soon as he received them. In his dealings with others, he was deeply sincere, and toward the abandoned and exposed, he showed even greater kindness. Once, a colleague’s daughter, reduced to servitude by poverty...\n\nLord Cha heard of her plight and redeemed her, then married her to a scholarly clan.\n\nMinister Lü Duān the Upright and Loyal, along with the late Chancellor Feng Dao and General Zhao Wendu, were all old friends from the same hometown. Feng Dao’s son was disabled by illness, so Lü shared his salary to support him. He also recommended Zhao Wendu’s son, Shaozong, for an official post. If not for genuine compassion for the orphaned, could one act thus?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nYoung and orphaned—what to rely on, what to depend upon?\nNo one to embrace, no one to tend when illness strikes.\nI was young once, and so are others’ children.\nThe fawn disobeys its mother’s command; the young deer weeps, vowing its loyalty.\nTo extend this heart is to align with Heaven’s principle.\n**Pity the widow.**\n\n**Account:**\nA widow—still in the prime of life, when her husband suddenly perishes.\nAlone in form, solitary in shadow, every glance brings desolation.\nHow much worse when women are fragile and men foolish, with a hundred affairs left unfinished?\nThis is precisely what Mencius meant by “the destitute with none to turn to.”\nSuch misfortune—is this not the depths of hardship?\nTo whom can she speak? Is this not utter helplessness?\nThough her husband is dead, in the unseen realm, how could he bear no thought for her?\n\nFormerly, when Xu Zezhi served as magistrate of Beijing, Zhao Shihuang arrived from Renxing and was retained as an administrative officer. Shihuang and Xu’s three sons all got along well. Before long, Shihuang suddenly died of illness. Xu and his sons arranged the funeral, provided ample provisions, and generously assisted his wife and children. They also dispatched the minor official Zhao Yi to escort them to the capital. After Yi completed the task and returned to report, he suddenly spoke in Shihuang’s voice to express gratitude: “Shihuang failed to care for his health and, in the prime of life, was abruptly entered into the register of the dead. I am deeply indebted to Your Lordship and your sons for your boundless kindness—not only did my remains return home, but my aged mother, wife, and children all safely reached our village, spared from wandering and homelessness. My humble heart is overwhelmed with gratitude. The Lord of the Underworld also admires this and will surely bestow abundant rewards upon you.”\n\nThe eunuch official Huang Shu was dispatched by imperial decree to deliver a fan and handkerchief to Pengze, where he was to welcome and present them to the northern envoy. Soon after, the boatman Wang Gui fell ill and died en route. His vessel belonged to the official transport bureau of the Two Zhe provinces. Upon Gui’s death, the boat was to be returned to the authorities. His wife, weeping, pleaded, “If the boat is reclaimed, my family of ten will starve to death. I beg for a single word of favor, that my eldest son may inherit his father’s livelihood.” Moved, Shu spoke of this in Zhenjiang, and the transport commissioner immediately enlisted the son as a soldier and entrusted him with his father’s boat.\n\nThat night, Shu lodged in Danyang. At dawn, he saw Gui maneuvering a small boat toward him from the misty waves. Gui prostrated himself in tears and said, “Though I am dead, my eldest son has inherited my work, and my family of ten need no longer fear starvation. I am deeply indebted to your kindness.” With that, he vanished.\n\nAlas, such manifest events may be set aside for now. Yet I observe that widows, though standing alone among men, often resolve with a will far surpassing others—this cannot go unrecorded.\n\nCounselor Zhao Gai was orphaned at seven. His mother, steadfast in her devotion, raised him with rigorous instruction, and he eventually ranked third in the imperial examination of the fifth year of Tiansheng. When the court later granted the privilege of official appointment to meritorious families, Gai requested that the honor be bestowed upon his mother as a commandery grand lady. The prime minister said, “As a scholar-official, your own rank is not far off.” Gai replied, “My mother is eighty-two, and her days are uncertain. I wish to see her honored in her lifetime.” His request was granted.\n\nPrefect Li Jun was orphaned at three. His mother, Lady Qin, was comely. When suitors urged her to remarry, she rebuked them angrily: “The bond of husband and wife is ordained by heaven, and life and death are decreed by fate. I would sooner starve than remarry.” She devoted herself to Jun’s education, and he eventually passed the examinations and rose to the rank of military commissioner of Yaozhou.\n\nCan the widowed be taken lightly? I record these accounts beneath my reflections on aiding widows precisely to show all widows the path to emulate.\n\nAlas! For those who uphold such principles, heaven’s reward is certain, for they honor the weight of human bonds—how could their children’s success be theirs alone?\n\n**In Praise:**\nWidows who hold fast to virtue\nAre revered by the wise and worthy.\n\nThe steadfast widow of Zhejiang and Lujin,\nHer resolve more valiant than the bravest knight.\nThe tower of Lady Qing stood firm,\nDefying the might of Qin’s tyranny.\nHow much more, then, those without recourse—\nCould one not be moved by their plight?\nWho would dare trample them,\nUnshaken, undaunted?\n\n**Revering the Aged.**\nThe *Records* state: The aged have witnessed the passage of time,\nEndured the weight of countless affairs.\nThe young, in their heedless throng,\nAre lost in untold numbers,\nWhile the silver-browed, white-haired elders\nAlone preserve their vigor and strength—\nHow could they not be revered?\n\nIn the early years of the *Kaibao* era, there was a certain Xu Yong, a county magistrate of Yun Prefecture in Yunzhou, who submitted a petition to the imperial complaint drum, stating: “My father, Qiong, is ninety-seven years old; my eldest brother, eighty-one; my second brother, seventy-nine; and I myself, seventy-five. I humbly request an appointment near my home to attend to their care and honor them.” Taizu summoned his father, and upon his arrival, Qiong presented his case with clarity and acuity, his speech and bearing undiminished by age. Taizu, deeply impressed, declared: “Such a household as yours must possess extraordinary virtue.” Qiong replied: “There is nothing extraordinary—only that for generations, we have lived in harmony, undivided.” Taizu said: “That *is* your extraordinary virtue.” He immediately ordered the bestowal of a robe and sash, a silver-inlaid saddle and bridle, a horse, thirty *jin* of imperial tea, thirty bolts of assorted silks, and an appointment to a post near their home, fulfilling their wish.\n\nWu Yuansi likewise enjoyed great longevity. When the court, during a sacred festival, sought out the elderly, Yuansi’s household alone included those of eighty, ninety, and over a hundred years—eight in total. Among them was Wu Wan, aged one hundred and fourteen, who walked with light, steady steps and whose *qi* showed no sign of decline. When asked the secret of his vitality, he replied: “For generations, we have lived in harmony, undivided.” The emperor issued an edict granting him an official title and commending his household with an inscribed gateway.\n\nBeyond the gate, two platforms of righteous harmony were erected, each crowned with a pair of ornate *hua-biao* pillars topped with crane finials—a mark of exceptional honor.\n\nIf even the Most Exalted holds such reverence, how much more should others?\n\nI have examined the annals of our dynasty and found that among those who held high office and attained great longevity, only the following stand out: Zhang Tuichuan, who lived to ninety-one; Duke Wen of Lu, ninety-two; Zhao Kangjing, eighty-six; Zhang Wending, eighty-five; Chen Wenhui, eighty-two; Zeng Xuanjing and Fu Wenzhong, both over eighty. Next in rank were Zhao Qingxian, Pang Zhuangmin, Xiang Wenjian, and Li Wenzheng—all above seventy, yet still falling short. Further below were Cao Wuhui, Xue Jiansu, Wang Yimin, Lü Wenmu, Lü Wenhui, and Kou Wenmin—each surpassing sixty, but again not matching the first group. Then came Shen the Remonstrator, who reached precisely sixty; Liu the Academician, fifty; Wang the Hanlin Academician, Yin the Drafter, Wang the Grand Master for Consultation, and Qian Xuanjing—all above forty, yet far from the mark. Others, like Shi Culai, died at forty; Su the Hanlin Academician, thirty-nine; Zhao the Drafter, thirty-six; and Wang the Censor, thirty-eight. These lives were especially lamentable. In the arena of fame and profit, time slips away in the blink of an eye—how much of it is truly spent cultivating one’s own destiny? If not, then one’s passage through this world is but a fleeting, aimless journey. The words of the Buddhas—*“May my lifespan be long, that I may diligently practice all good; may my virtue and fortune flourish, that I may widely aid all beings”*—are entirely missed.\n\nAlas! Youth, so quick to flaunt their talents and scorn their elders, fail to grasp that longevity stands foremost among the Five Blessings. Even with abundant talent, if one does not reach that stage, what use is it? Long ago, Yang Danian, Zhou Han, and Zhu Ang served together in the imperial court. The latter two were already advanced in years, while Yang, barely twenty, often belittled them. Zhou, deeply offended, once retorted in jest: “Do not mock my age—old age will one day be yours as well.” Zhu, from the side, waved his hand and said: “Do not say such things, do not say such things.” Later, Yang Danian died at forty-nine. Thus, to attain old age—is it not a rare and difficult achievement? Should it not be revered?\n\nIn praise I say:\n\nThe cultivation of the Three Elders is learned and nurtured; rites honor those of advanced years. This is as close as kinship, the foremost duty of family and state. Heaven grants them longevity, allowing their crowns to flourish. Those who fail to revere them profane Heaven itself. How much more should those of venerable virtue be accorded respect? Surely none dare neglect their due rites.\n\n**Cherishing the Young.**\nThe *Traditions* record Confucius’s words: *“The young should be cherished.”* Mencius likewise said: *“Cherish your own young, and extend that care to the young of others.”* For the young are but children, their understanding yet unformed. Those who are elder must naturally show them compassion and nurture them. To treat them with cruelty is no human way. Thus, parents with young children must exhaust their loving diligence; elder brothers with younger siblings must extend their fraternal affection. Even toward the young of others, one should extend the same heart of kindness, regarding them equally, without distinction of self and other. To love only one’s own children and kin while neglecting others’ is no true fulfillment of the Way of cherishing the young.\n\nMoreover, the young hold lowly station and feeble strength—lowliness invites contempt, weakness invites oppression. Without a heart of compassion, elders may exploit their position to indulge their whims. The young, lacking eloquence to discern right from wrong or strength to contest victory, suffer as the lame endure the rod, unable to flee; as the mute endure slander, unable to defend themselves. Who could fully recount their hardships? How grievous is the thinness of custom!\n\nWomen’s nature often inclines toward jealousy and harshness. When a mother’s virtue is uneven, her love for her children becomes partial. She cherishes her own offspring but treats the children of concubines with coldness. Stepmothers, even more so, often neglect the children of their predecessors. As with Min Ziqian’s mother, who in winter clad her own son in silk floss but dressed Ziqian in reed catkins, then sent him to drive the carriage—such was her cruelty. If even Ziqian’s mother acted thus, what can be said of others? Countless orphaned and young stepchildren suffer cruel fates.\n\nAmong common folk, when disputes over property arise, elders and elder siblings—even those who have married into the family—may act without kindness or righteousness, oppressing their juniors. They craft false petitions, forge contracts, instruct brokers to bear false witness, and bribe clerks to twist the law, leaving the young helpless and stifled, with no recourse for grievance. Worse still, some resort to dark schemes and treachery, even harming their lives. Alas! How can one bear to speak of it?\n\nIn former times, the Li Zhiben household numbered over a hundred descendants, old and young living in harmony. The Yang brothers, orphaned and alone, relied upon one another. When the ancients sought to relieve famine, they made the care of orphans and the young their first priority. Such conduct truly fulfills the Way of cherishing the young.\n\n**In praise I say:**\nYao cherished the young child;\nLaozi longed for infancy.\nConfucius’s aspiration:\n*“The young should be cherished.”*\nIn their earliest years,\ntheir virtue remains pure, undiluted.\nEasily oppressed,\nthey must be protected and upheld.\nThus, for orphans and the young,\nbenevolence should come first.\n\n*Here ends Scroll Two of the* Taishang Ganying Pian.\n*Scroll Three of the* Taishang Ganying Pian *begins.*\n\n**The Transmission of Li Changling**\n*With a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi*\n\nEven insects and plants must not be harmed.\n\nAs the transmission states: According to the scriptures, all sentient beings possess within their single bodies the full array of forms and substances, taking shape as they are created. Ignorance gives rise to egg-born life; the womb of afflictions envelops the womb-born; the moisture of craving soaks the moisture-born; and sudden surges of vexation produce the transformation-born. Among these four modes of birth, humanity further distinguishes twelve classes of beings. Within each of these twelve classes, there are in turn eighty-four thousand distinct kinds. Taken together, the twelve classes thus comprise one million and eighty thousand varieties. How vast, then, is the diversity of sentient life!\n\nYet when we observe our daily conduct, we see that the eye, upon beholding rare treasures, immediately gives rise to thoughts of greed; the tongue, upon tasting rich and savory flavors, immediately gives rise to thoughts of killing; and the mind, upon grasping at splendor, immediately gives rise to thoughts of desire. Not only do the eye, tongue, and mind act thus—so too do the ear, nose, and body. Such deluded thoughts, such inverted perceptions, arise without cease. Even at the moment of death, when the eyes close, all remains in chaos, and one cannot take control. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth month, when feet scurry and hands flail, can one truly be master of oneself? It is from this that the Buddha’s twelve classes of beings and one million eighty thousand varieties arise.\n\nIn former times, when the Buddha wandered and taught among the kingdoms, there was one land that resisted his transformation. He sent Maudgalyāyana, and the entire nation came before him. The assembly asked the Buddha why. The Buddha replied: “The people of this land were once a swarm of bees. Maudgalyāyana was then a woodcutter who, while gathering firewood, struck a branch and disturbed the hive. The bees swarmed in fury, seeking to sting him. Maudgalyāyana said to them: ‘You all possess the Buddha-nature, yet through evil karma you have drifted into this state. Even now, you harbor petty resentment and wish to vent your venom. May I swiftly attain enlightenment and first deliver you.’ At that moment, the bees seemed to awaken and took his words to heart. Thus, when they now appear before us, they all follow in submission.”\n\nElsewhere, by the side of the Karanda Pond in Jambudvīpa, he expounded the Dharma for the assembly.\n\nAt that time, a clam, overjoyed upon hearing the Dharma, leapt from the pond and concealed itself among the grasses, listening intently with\n\nThus, how does the Most High show compassion for the wicked?\n\nIn former times, the residents of Chaozhou, beyond their daily sustenance, vied in consuming aquatic creatures. They knew not that on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month each year, the Jade Emperor presents his report to the Three Pure Ones, traverses the heavens, descends to observe the world, and determines the judgment of sins and blessings. On that day, the Envoys of the Nine Heavens, the sun, moon, and stars, the spirits of heaven and earth, the sacred mountains and rivers, and the deities of altars and temples all submit their detailed accounts.\n\nOne day, the Jade Emperor summoned the Central Heaven’s North Pole Purple Tenuity Great Emperor and asked: “In the southern continent of Jambudvīpa, within the astrological division of Wu, lies the land called Chaozhou. What is the state of its goodness and evil?”\n\nThe North Pole Emperor replied: “The inhabitants of this region are truly wicked, slaughtering living beings without restraint. I fear that as time accumulates, their vengeful spirits will grow ever more entangled. Unless the land is utterly submerged to form a great lake, it will not suffice to cleanse the years of cruel killings and the noxious, defiling qi of their savagery.”\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, “Let it be so.”\n\nAfter the North Pole Emperor withdrew, he summoned Zhenwu and said: “As the patroller of the Three Realms, charged with examining good and evil, how could you not know of the wickedness of Chaozhou’s people? Their noxious, defiling qi has ascended to disrupt the Jade Emperor’s celestial procession, causing the sun and moon to lose their light and the stars to fall from their courses. The Jade Emperor has decreed that the entire city be sunk and destroyed. This task falls to you—proceed swiftly.”\n\nZhenwu replied: “A land spanning a thousand *li* is not uniformly corrupt. If all are sunk without distinction, I fear many will suffer unjustly. Allow me to descend and further inquire of the local earth deities before reporting back.”\n\nThe North Pole Emperor said: “The deities of that region have already received their edicts and been relocated elsewhere.”\n\nZhenwu then sighed deeply and said: “Alas! Even a single creature’s life remains bound in the cycle of rebirth, not easily liberated. How much more so when a thousand *li* become a watery expanse, where beings turn upon one another in harm, their great grievances ever more entangled—how can they be saved?”\n\nHe again pleaded earnestly, dispatching his subordinate Celestial Stem generals to conduct another investigation. Thereupon, one of the generals transformed into a giant soft-shelled turtle, floating upon the Han River. First, the local officials and their attendants carved its flesh for consumption, followed by the common people, who did likewise.\n\nThe Celestial Stem general returned and reported. Zhenwu once more requested to descend himself. This time, he transformed into a wandering Daoist, begging for water in the streets. For seven days, every household’s water reeked of filth. Only in the last home, belonging to an old woman called Jiao, was the water pure and clean.\n\nThe Perfected Lord questioned her, and the old woman replied: “Our family of three has long detested the stench of flesh. We eat only vegetables.”\n\nThe Perfected Lord said: “I am no mortal. This region will soon be submerged to form a great lake. Though I wished to save it, it is no longer possible. You must flee to another place at once.”\n\nBefore long, a torrential rain indeed fell, and a great flood surged forth. In an instant, the thousand-*li* expanse of the region became towering waves, vast and boundless.\n\nOn that day, the Perfected Lord descended again and said to Jiao: “You shall preside over this lake.” Several days later, the old woman died, followed by her son and daughter-in-law. They thus became spirits, and the lake was named *Jiao* after her surname.\n\nThus, how does the Heavenly Perfected One show compassion for the wicked? The scripture says: “Do not harbor resentment toward the stubborn”—this is its meaning.\n\nA Eulogy says:\nThe wickedness of men—\nis it truly their nature?\nSeeing it is like plunging hands into boiling water,\nand pity already takes shape.\n“Do not harbor resentment toward the stubborn”—\nthe scripture’s admonition is clear.\nDeath, ruin, punishment, and execution—\nthese are but groping in the dark.\nYet there are those who rescue the lost,\na lamp in the dark chamber.\nThey delight in the goodness of others.\n\nThe tradition says: “My single word\nmost perfectly fulfills all vows and practices.”\nWhen a person utters a good vow,\nheaven hears it like the crack of firecrackers.\nAll buddhas without exception protect and cherish it;\nthe Perfected of the Highest Heaven without exception uphold it—\nfor the heart is in accord.\n\nAccording to the *Tang Literary Anthology*:\nLong ago, Gao Mai, seeing the eminent talents of his village,\ntook charge of the long-burning lamp in the sutra repository of Baorong Monastery.\nThrough diligent cultivation, he achieved success and, overjoyed, made a vow,\ninscribing it in verse to praise it.\nLater, pressed by many affairs,\nhe was unable to compose the text.\nSuddenly, he contracted an eye ailment, his vision blurred,\nas though gazing through layered silk.\nHe often sighed in regret,\nunsure of the cause of his offense.\nOne night, he dreamed a spirit told him:\n“Have you failed in your duty to the long-burning lamp?”\nMai awoke at once, rose, and composed the verse.\nThe next day, his eyes were healed.\n\nThus, how do the buddhas protect and cherish the good?\n\nAccording to the *Records of Divine Responses*:\nCheng Sichang often stayed in Mizhou,\nwhere he saw that the people of the western outskirts were fond of eating birds and sparrows.\nSeveral hunters daily trapped and killed them,\nsome crushed head or breast beneath the talons and beaks of hawks and falcons,\nothers broken of leg or wing in nets and snares,\nsome pierced by arrows, others struck by pellets—\ntheir piteous cries were unbearable to hear.\nThereupon, he rose at night and stood beneath the stars,\ngazing heavenward, and declared:\n“I wish to take all the living beings my family has consumed,\ntogether with a *Precept Against Killing* chart for the karmic bonds of my seven generations of parents,\ncarve blocks, and print copies for distribution,\nthat this region may all know repentance.”\nThat day happened to be the descent of the Perfected Warrior Lord.\nHe prayed, entrusting the task to the sage’s power,\nthat it might be widely circulated.\nAfter the blocks were carved and printing completed,\na man named Peng Jing, who lived at the barrier, also requested a copy\nand took it home to show his wife.\nHis wife, Hua-shi the Third, flew into a rage upon seeing it,\ntore it up, and cast it into a filthy place.\nSoon after, she bought a fish and took up a knife to slice it.\nThe fish suddenly leapt and struck her eye,\ncausing blood to gush forth.\nInstantly, it transformed into worms,\nwhich crawled over her body, biting everywhere.\nAs the commotion spread,\nthe garrison commander rushed over,\nonly to see a spirit standing before him,\nwho declared: “I am the Perfected Warrior.\nI have observed that in this place there is one great act of goodness—\nCheng Sichang of Xinghua Commandery, who printed and distributed the *Precept Against Killing* chart.\nYet this woman, Hua-shi, dared to tear it up and cast it into filth.\nHer crime is grave; she should die at once.\nOthers who do not repent shall also incur punishment.\nWait until my descent on the twenty-seventh day to see what transpires.”\n\nThen how do the Highest Perfected Ones uphold and sustain goodness? Alas! The Highest Perfected and the Buddhas, having long abided in liberation, still take such delight in the goodness of others. How much more should humans, who remain in the sea of suffering, do likewise? In the world, such people are not absent. Hu Wending, upon seeing Li Wenjing—serene and free from desire, and further enriched by learning—exclaimed: “This man stands at the eight- or nine-tenths mark of attainment.” When he beheld Wang Suogong, steadfast and unshaken, coupled with earnest study, he again declared: “This man, too, stands at the eight- or nine-tenths mark.” Shao Kangjie, observing Sima Wengong’s loyalty, kindness, brotherly respect, reverence, frugality, and integrity, rejoiced and said: “This man walks with both feet firmly on the ground—an eight- or nine-tenths man indeed.” When he saw Han Qinzhong argue matters before his superiors without evasion, he remarked: “This man is utterly pure yet unostentatious, utterly upright yet unprovocative, utterly courageous yet gentle—truly rare and admirable.” Likewise, Du Zhengxian, upon hearing of another’s goodness, rejoiced as if it were his own. Liu Jixian, upon hearing of another’s goodness, extolled it without end. Wen Lugong, upon seeing another’s goodness, feared he could not match it. Han Zhongxian, upon hearing of even a small act of goodness, would say: “This is something I have not yet achieved.” Could such men as these, unless they truly delighted in goodness—reaching that state where delight precludes all aversion—have acted thus?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nGoodness is innate in all,\nFlowing from heaven’s nature.\nWhy then envy and malice,\nThe triumph of self-interest?\nAggression, contention, resentment, desire—\nThese afflict one another.\nOnly when the self is forgotten\nDoes this heart cease to vie.\nSeeing another’s goodness,\nLike the moon reflected in a mirror.\nAiding another in distress—\n\nAs the *Yunji Qiqian* states: “The Venerable Nuojuluo said: ‘One of great wisdom is like a steadfast lamp within a basket. One of great merit and virtue is like a bubble floating upon the sea. One of great skillful means is like rain falling through empty space.’ Now, when one aids another in distress with the strength to do so, this is precisely what is meant by great skillful means. Like rain that nourishes all, its benefit to living beings is beyond words.”\n\nDistress takes many forms. In illness, the urgent need is for medicine. In death and mourning, it is for funeral arrangements. In hunger and want, it is for food and drink. In marriage, it is for dowries and provisions. Beyond these, there are countless other urgencies that cannot all be enumerated. Yet if one responds to each according to its urgency, aiding with skillful means, this is truly to relieve another’s distress.\n\nLong ago, Xu Shuwei, in his youth, prayed for success in the imperial examinations. One night, he dreamed a spirit told him: “If you wish to pass, you must rely on hidden virtue.” Xu reflected that, being poor and without means, only medicine could serve this purpose. Thus, he devoted himself to medical texts, eventually mastering them. Regardless of rank, he hastened to aid all who called. As the number of lives he saved grew, so too did his renown. Later, the spirit appeared to him again in a dream and bestowed a poem:\n*“Medicine bears hidden merit,\nIn the hall of Chen and Lou.\nAt the gaming table, ‘Six!’ is called,\nYet ‘Five!’ is what they count.”*\nThat year, he placed sixth in the imperial examinations. The candidate above him was named Chen Zuyan, and the one below, Lou Cai. When official appointments were later adjusted, he was promoted to the fifth rank, returning home as a commissioned official—every word of the poem proved true. This was one who aided others in their distress.\n\nFan Wenzheng, while governing Binzhou, once took leisure to ascend a tower with wine and his subordinates for a view. As they raised their first cups, he suddenly saw several mourners in hempen garments moving about, preparing funeral rites. He sent someone to inquire and learned that a low-ranking official, residing away from home, had just died, leaving no provisions for his burial. Fan immediately canceled the feast and generously provided for the deceased. This was one who aided another in the distress of death and mourning.\n\nFan Zhongxuan, governing Qingzhou during a great famine, saw corpses of the starved lining the roads, yet had no grain to distribute. He requested the release of stored grain from the Ever-Normal Granary, but the local officials refused, saying: “A memorial must first be submitted.” Fan replied: “A person cannot survive seven days without food. If we wait for approval, how can we act in time?” That very day, he released the grain, adding: “Let none of you share responsibility—I shall bear it alone.” This was one who aided others in the distress of hunger and want.\n\nZha Dao, before passing the examinations, once traveled through the Xiang and Han regions, borrowing money from others to the sum of one hundred thousand coins. On the road, he encountered an old friend urgently preparing for his daughter’s marriage but lacking funds. Without hesitation, Zha emptied his purse and gave it all, showing no reluctance. This was one who aided another in the distress of marriage.\n\nWith such devotion of heart, how could they not be rewarded in the end? Xu Shuwei ultimately passed the examinations; Fan Wenzheng rose to the rank of vice-minister; Fan Zhongxuan became chancellor; and Zha Dao attained the position of attendant-in-ordinary. Were these not their rewards?\n\nIn general, when one dwells in the world, one ought to act thus in the face of another’s distress.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe noble one aids in urgency,\nNot for private gain.\nAs one trapped in a well,\nIf you withhold the rope,\nIt is as if you killed them.\nTo bow and yield while another drowns—\nIs this not self-deception?\nJudging others by oneself,\nTheir urgency is plain.\nRescuing another in peril—\n\nAs the *Yunji Qiqian* states: “One who saves a life extends their own years by twelve. If the one saved is a good person, the extension doubles.” Then how can one fail to rescue another in peril? Peril here means the very threshold of life and death.\n\nWhen Wang Jun rebelled in Shu, the court, enraged by Shu’s repeated uprisings, ordered Lei Youzhong to lead troops to suppress it, intending to massacre the city. At the time, the Shu scholars Fan Can, known for his integrity; Fan Xun, devoted to study; and the eminent monk Wenjian, all respected figures in Shu, joined together to secretly welcome the imperial army. Kneeling, they pleaded: “The people of Shu are weak. Those in the city are all common folk, and those who joined the rebellion did so only out of fear. They are not truly guilty.”\n\nWhen the city was about to fall, they entreated: “We beg that slaughter not be wantonly inflicted; rooting out the ringleaders will suffice.” These three were all men of towering stature, and their arguments, delivered with fervor, were made selflessly for the sake of others, springing from utmost sincerity. Lei Youzhong was moved by their words and replied: “Had I not heard the words of such elders, the massacre of the city would have been certain.” Thus, the entire populace of the city was spared from death—through the efforts of Fan and Wenjian.\n\nZhang Xun, the great-grandfather of Zhang Dexiang, the Duke of Xuān, once served the Min kingdom as prefect of Jianzhou. His wife, Lady Lian, was a woman of wisdom and discernment. Zhang Xun once dispatched two generals on a military campaign; when they failed to return on time, he intended to execute them. Lady Lian interceded, and the two generals were spared. Later, they served as generals under the Southern Tang and led the attack to retake Jianzhou. By then, Zhang Xun had already passed away. Lady Lian still resided in Jianzhou, and the two generals sent envoys bearing generous gifts of gold and silk, along with a white banner, which they presented to her, saying: “When we sack the city, plant this banner at your gate, and we will command our soldiers not to violate your household.” Lady Lian returned their gold, silk, and banner, refusing them, and said: “I am grateful for your remembrance of past kindness and your wish to spare this city. If you insist on slaughter, my family will perish alongside the rest—I do not wish to survive alone.” Moved by her words, the two generals abandoned their plan to massacre the city—through the efforts of Lady Lian.\n\nThe Fan family has since become a prominent clan in Shu, with descendants flourishing and officials numbering in the hundreds. The Zhang family, too, has grown into a great lineage in Jian, with successive generations attaining high ministerial ranks—all descendants of Lady Lian.\n\nAlas! The lives these two families saved were so numerous, and the recompense bestowed by Heaven was equally abundant. Such cases are indeed rare in the world. Yet in all matters of peril—whether from flood and fire, bandits and thieves, famine and cold, illness and plague, judicial coercion, or distress in travel—if one maintains such a heart of compassion, though the circumstances may differ, the act of rescuing those in danger remains the same.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen a child falls into a well,\nAll who witness it feel alarm.\nWhen a vessel is about to shatter,\nOnlookers reach out to catch it.\nTurning peril into safety,\nReviving the crippled to walk—\nOnce the other’s distress is averted,\nMy joy is profound.\nWith a heart of benevolence,\nRegret and blame are no more.\n\n*This concludes Chapter Three of the* Taishang Ganying Pian. *Chapter Four of the* Taishang Ganying Pian *begins.*\n\n**The Biography of Li Changling**\n\n**Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi:**\nTo see another’s gain as one’s own gain,\nTo see another’s loss as one’s own loss.\n\nThe *Biography* states: Wenju asked Vimalakīrti at the bodhimanda, “What is the bodhimanda?”\nVimalakīrti replied, “An even mind is the bodhimanda.”\n\nZhaozhou asked Nanquan, “What is the Dao?”\nNanquan replied, “An even mind is the Dao.”\n\nThus, is an even mind the Dao, or is it the bodhimanda?\nOuyang Wenzhong cultivated goodwill and delighted in virtue, yet he often found maintaining an even mind difficult.\nPrefect Peng Siyong of Peng studied tirelessly and would tell others, “I do not study for others; since youth, I have studied only to even my mind.”\nIs an even mind truly so difficult? Must one learn it for oneself?\n\nGenerally, the mind as a thing has no inherent substance, yet it is not absent when put to use. If one wishes to even the mind, it lies within oneself—what difficulty could there be? Those among the elders who found it difficult did so lamenting the lack of others to guide them, offering instruction to later learners.\n\nThose in the world who cannot regard another’s gains and losses as their own surely do not understand this. Precisely because they do not understand, the distinction between self and others always prevails, and transgressions accumulate upon them like water flowing to the sea, growing deeper and broader day by day. How then could they be fit to receive the teachings of the bodhimanda or the Dao?\n\nIn ancient times, Xue Yuan served as minister to the state of Yan. He could not maintain an even mind: when he saw others gain, he felt as though he had lost; when he saw others lose, he felt as though he had gained. He never recommended a single scholar or promoted a single worthy. If there was anything praiseworthy, he envied it like an enemy, suppressing it to prevent advancement. In his later years, one son died in prison, and the rest were afflicted with blindness, deafness, muteness, hunchbackedness, madness, or idiocy.\n\nAt that time, Gongming Zigao saw him and took pity, rebuking him: “All this stems from your misguided thoughts and actions. Your crimes warrant the extermination of your entire family. Though your sons suffer thus, it is not yet enough to exhaust your transgressions.” Terrified, Xue Yuan earnestly begged for salvation. Zigao then transmitted to him the *Central Admonitions* of Master Red Pine. Yuan vowed to reform and practiced diligently, barely preserving one son.\n\nWhat, then, is this *Central Admonition*? I have humbly reflected upon the *Book of Songs*, and it differs not at all from this text. In essence, both point out the errors in how people employ their minds. Their power to avert misfortune is most potent.\n\nXue Yuan reverently received the *Central Admonition* and thus escaped the extermination of his family. Zhou Chi propagated this text and thereby avoided starvation—is this not proof of its power?\n\nAlas! All things in the world turn to emptiness in an instant; only evil karma remains a lasting burden upon the self. The purpose of annotating this book is precisely to elucidate this truth. Those who know of this book cannot but seek to read it; having read it, they cannot but put it into practice. If one truly acts thus, in the future, when facing the path of life and death, one will receive great power.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThough a hundred chapters fill this book,\nMu’s oath concludes it best.\nWhen others rise, regard it as your own;\nIf the people stray from the mean, blame has not yet departed.\nThe lord of *Hong Fan* grants blessings equally—\nNot for others’ sake, but for one’s own good.\nDo not expose the faults of others.\n\nThe Tradition states: Ma Fubo admonished his descendants, saying, \"When you hear of another’s faults, it should be as if you heard the names of your parents—your ears may hear them, but your mouth must not speak of them.\" This fully embodies the teaching of the Highest Sages: \"Do not expose the faults of others.\" As for Master Guishan, he further refined this saying: \"Not only must the mouth not speak of them, the ears must not even hear of them.\" This surpasses Ma Fubo’s teaching, ascending to a yet higher realm.\n\nGenerally, those entangled in worldly toil cannot be without faults. Yet their faults are their own—what concern are they to me? For me, it suffices to remain in a state of not hearing, not knowing; thus, their faults will never be exposed through me. If, however, one utters even a single word to expose them, those faults will inevitably spread. Reputation will diminish from that moment, and one’s long-held integrity will collapse. If one traces the cause of this, who shall bear the blame? Know this: a noble person does not engage in exposing others’ faults, while the petty do so without scruple.\n\nIn ancient times, among the people of Guicheng, there was a man named Zhu Qisheng. He was narrow-minded and shallow, delighting in exposing others’ faults. If someone had a physical imperfection, he mocked them; if they were beautiful, he slandered them with envy; if they were foolish, he belittled them; if they were wise, he critiqued and ranked them; if they were poor, he despised them; if they were wealthy, he defamed them. With officials, he exposed their hidden deceit; with scholars and friends, he revealed their private affairs. If anyone’s lineage, talent, or reputation surpassed his own, leaving no room for criticism, he would cunningly seek out their flaws, saying: \"Their grandfather was a commoner,\" \"Their father was base,\" \"Their mother’s family were merchants,\" \"Their wife’s family were brokers,\" \"Their brother is unprincipled,\" \"Their son is worthless.\" Even the slightest fault would be exaggerated and embellished to magnify their shortcomings. No matter how trivial the matter, he acted thus—turning nothing into something, one into a hundred, suspicion into certainty, coincidence into deliberate offense, necessity into willful misconduct, and error into malice. If he judged someone gullible, he would confront them to their face, humiliate them before others, and slander them excessively. He treated strangers this way, and his own kin no differently. All his acquaintances fell under his censure. In extreme cases, he called his parents obstinate and unruly, his brothers like Guan and Cai. He would incite others to litigation, then mediate the dispute himself; urge others to curse their horses, then testify against them. Over time, such habits became second nature, and he saw no wrong in them.\n\nIn his later years, he suddenly fell ill, his tongue often turning yellow, requiring bloodletting by lancet—several *sheng* of blood would be drawn before it ceased. Yet soon after, the affliction would recur, demanding further needling. Within a single year, this occurred five to seven times, the agony so excruciating as to defy description, until at last his tongue withered and he died. This case is identical to that of Daoist Zhang Qiyi, who delighted in mocking others and ultimately died from a tongue-chewing affliction.\n\nIs it then permissible to magnify others’ shortcomings?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhat I establish for myself, I aspire to sagehood and worthiness.\nThey, too, are but human—why should they be different?\nIf by chance they err, their faults may yet be washed clean.\nBut once their misdeeds are broadcast, it becomes a lifelong stain.\nThus, the gentleman values concealing others’ faults,\nAnd does not flaunt his own strengths.\n\nAs the *Tradition* says:\nLaozi declared: *\"A skilled merchant stores deeply as if empty; a man of great virtue appears dull.\"*\nConfucius said: *\"The Way of the gentleman is obscure yet daily grows clearer; the way of the petty man is glaring yet daily fades.\"*\n\nGenerally, as humans, can any of us be entirely without merit?\nIf one possesses merit, it should be so by nature.\nThe key lies in further veiling one’s light and nurturing one’s character,\nEnsuring daily renewal—only then can virtue be perfected.\nOtherwise, one risks becoming frivolous and ostentatious,\nRevealing one’s pettiness and shallowness.\nHow does this align with *\"a man of great virtue appears dull\"* or *\"the Way of the gentleman is obscure yet daily grows clearer\"*?\n\nThus, when Ouyang Wenzhong (Ouyang Xiu) excelled in literature, he would discuss governance with guests, never touching on writing.\nWhen Cai Duanning (Cai Xiang) excelled in governance, he would discuss literature with guests, never touching on affairs of state.\nBoth were masters of self-effacement.\nAlas, how few understand this—most instead indulge in self-display.\n\nIn ancient times, Li Bi was exceptionally intelligent. At the age of seven, he was already skilled in composition. Once, he wrote a *Ballad of Endless Singing*, which went:\n\n\"Heaven covers me, earth bears me,\nHeaven and earth gave me life—was it with intent or none?\nElse I’d fast and ascend the celestial thoroughfare,\nElse I’d jingle my jade pendants and roam the imperial capital.\nHow could I fail to rise, fail to depart,\nWasting my towering stature as a true man?\nO true man, ah, true man,\nMy lifelong aspirations brim with grand designs.\nI beg you to survey the affairs of a hundred years—\nOnce my work is done, I’ll take a small boat and drift upon the five lakes.\"\n\nWhen the song was finished, none failed to praise it. Only Zhang Jiuling sternly warned him: *\"To conceal one’s talents within is what the ancients valued. Now that you’ve gained fame so early, you will surely face setbacks. You must veil your light and nurture your character—only then may you perfect your virtue. How much more so for a child? If you compose poetry, simply admire the scenery and sing of past and present; never exalt yourself, for that is the wiser course.\"* Li Bi seemed to awaken. He wept and thanked Zhang repeatedly, and from then on never again displayed his talents. Had he not ceased, how could he have perfected his virtue and become a renowned minister of his age?\n\nOne must know: if a person has strengths, they must never flaunt them.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Three Powers stand as one: Heaven, Earth, and Man.\nThe warp and weft of the world rest upon a single person.\nFrom worthy to sage, from sage to spirit—\nYet in an instant, if one borrows without renewal, their virtue does not grow.\nYan Yuan appeared dull, yet his example is worthy of inscription on one’s sash.\nTo suppress evil and exalt goodness—\n\nThe *Commentary* states: *\"To suppress evil and exalt goodness is called a gentleman in the *Book of Changes*, and a good person in the *Book of Songs*.\"*\nThe *Changes* says: *\"Fire above heaven—Great Possession. The image of greatness and inclusiveness. The gentleman suppresses evil and exalts goodness, aligning with Heaven’s blessed mandate.\"*\nThus, to suppress evil and exalt goodness is to follow Heaven’s virtue and fulfill the mandate of all things. Is Heaven’s blessed mandate truly found in this?\n\nGenerally, unless one is a Yao or Shun, how can every deed be perfectly good? What is not good is called evil. If I can suppress it, preventing one from abandoning themselves, and instead encourage them to turn toward goodness—who does not value goodness? In every word and deed, if there is anything worthy, it is called good. If I can exalt it, making it known to all so that people strive to emulate it—is this not Heaven’s blessed mandate?\n\nHeaven’s blessed mandate is thus;\nMy treatment of others is thus.\nIs this not aligning with Heaven’s blessed mandate?\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *\"Shun—was he not greatly wise? He concealed others’ faults and exalted their goodness.\"* If even Shun acted thus, how much more should others?\n\nTherefore, Zhao Kangjing (Zhao Pu) made it his duty to conceal faults and exalt goodness. Shao Kangjie (Shao Yong) delighted in speaking of others’ virtues and never mentioned their vices. Both grasped the principle of suppressing evil and exalting goodness.\n\nAlas, how few understand this—yet the making or breaking of a person often lies in a single word. Once spoken, how can one not be cautious?\n\nWhen Kou Laigong (Kou Zhun) was in office, he built a mountain pavilion for his birthday, which was reported by the supervising officials. The emperor was furious, his imperial voice severe, and he said to Wang Wenzheng (Wang Dan): *\"Kou Zhun imitates me in every matter—why?\"* Wang replied: *\"Kou Zhun is truly capable, but he is simple-minded.\"* The emperor said: *\"Only simple-minded?\"* And so he did not pursue the matter further. Had it not been for Wang’s single remark, how could the emperor’s anger over the mountain pavilion have dissipated so quickly? How could the praise of Kou’s ability have reached the throne?\n\nWhen Wang Wenkang (Wang Zeng) governed Shu, he sentenced all thieves, regardless of the severity of their crimes, to death. Some criticized his excessive harshness. Later, when Liu Ye was summoned back, the emperor asked: *\"Between Ling Ce and Wang Zeng, who governed Shu better?\"* Liu said: *\"Ling Ce served during years of abundance, so he could govern with leniency. Wang Zeng faced years of scarcity, fearing the people would turn to banditry, so he had to enforce the law strictly. In each other’s place, they would have done the same.\"* The emperor approved of his words. Had it not been for Liu’s single remark, how could the suspicion of excessive harshness have been so swiftly resolved?\n\nHow could such words of mutual understanding have reached the throne? This is the suppression of evil and the promotion of good—what the Highest Dao calls a good person, and what the *Book of Changes* praises as \"following Heaven’s blessed mandate.\"\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe seeds of good and evil\nshare the same beginning.\nTo lift or suppress, advance or retreat—\nlike a turning windlass.\nTo curb one and exalt the other\ndepends on the pivot of the mechanism.\nAs spring’s breath stirs,\nthe hundred dormant creatures awaken.\nTo follow the blessed mandate of Heaven—\nis this not the heart of Heaven itself?\n\n**To yield much and take little.**\nAs the tradition states: *\"To yield much and take little\"* seems to refer to the bonds between brothers. Generally, when righteousness pertains to the great relationships, one ought to act thus in matters of wealth. If one were to do the opposite, where would righteousness remain? Moreover, wealth is especially valued for its connection to righteousness. Heaven’s judgment of men often hinges on this. Does taking more today truly mean one gains more? Does taking less today truly mean one gains less?\n\nIn ancient times, when Xue Bao divided property with his brothers, he took the elderly slaves, the barren fields, and the broken utensils. When Xu Ji divided property with his two uncles, he first asked them to take whatever they desired, leaving only a chest of books and two dilapidated rooms, which he accepted with joy, showing no resentment. Likewise: Wei Gong in the Xianxi era took only one or two divine artifacts; Dong Rong Shiheng took only books; Du Zhengxian Yan gave everything to his brothers; and Du Shentong Chun gave all to his youngest brother. These were all cases of yielding much and taking little.\n\nAs for official ranks, some have yielded them without accepting, such as Shen Jizhong, who twice declined imperial favors from suburban sacrifices, instead conferring the honors upon his two younger brothers. Xu Xi, after receiving an imperial appointment, deferred it to his brother’s son. Those who haggle over every penny and fight over every inch—how can their swift ruin be compared to such examples?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nTo know the masculine yet guard the feminine—great whiteness appears as black. Not to be poor is the treasure; the Old Master’s thrift. To broaden oneself by narrowing others—how can this be called abundant virtue? The mind must guard against excess, the body must practice restraint. Yet to speak only of wealth is to fall short of Heaven’s principle.\n\nTo endure humiliation without resentment: as the *Nirvana Sutra* relates, there was once a man who praised the Buddha as one of great blessed countenance. A listener grew furious and said, \"He lost his mother seven days after birth—how can he have great blessed countenance?\" The praiser replied, \"In the prime of his years and strength, he did not die prematurely; though violently beaten, he felt no anger; though his horse was struck, he did not retaliate—is this not great blessed countenance?\" The angry man’s heart was subdued. Generally, only one with blessed virtue can act thus, and only one who acts thus possesses blessed virtue. Such depth is not within the grasp of those with narrow and shallow capacities. Have you not heard of those in our dynasty with great blessed virtue?\n\nLong ago, when Lü Mengzheng was appointed Vice Minister, he was about to enter the court when a courtier behind a curtain pointed and said, \"Is this little fellow also a Vice Minister?\" Mengzheng feigned ignorance. Later, his colleagues insisted on learning the man’s name, but Mengzheng firmly refused, saying, \"If I knew his name, I would never forget it for the rest of my life—better not to hear it at all.\"\n\nWhen Fu Bi, Duke Wenzhong, was young, someone reviled him, and he heard it as if he had not. When told of it, he said, \"Perhaps he was cursing someone else.\" They replied, \"He clearly called out your name, Bi.\" He said, \"Are there not others in the world with the same name?\" And so he never inquired further.\n\nThese were scholars, and some might manage such restraint. But when even military men can do the same, it is truly admirable. Di Qing, the Vice Commander of Zhen Ding, once feasted with Sun Mian. A certain Liu Yi, also present, was known for his bluntness. When an actor mocked a scholar in jest, Liu flew into a rage and cried, \"How dare a branded convict behave so!\" He cursed Di Qing without cease, even hurling cups and dishes before storming off. Sun Mian watched Di Qing, whose composure remained unshaken, his smile unwavering, his words ever gentle. Only upon returning did Sun regret his own conduct—by then, Di Qing had already come to his door to apologize.\n\nWang Ji, serving as an auxiliary commander, joined the campaign against Liu Gan. Wang was cautious, dutiful, and sparing of words, appearing as if he had no ability. His peers constantly berated and scorned him, but he paid no heed, devoting himself entirely to his duties. He charged fearlessly into enemy lines, breaking through their ranks, and was later promoted to Commander. Could one without extraordinary forbearance have done the same? These men all had futures ahead of them, enjoying the fruits of blessed virtue. Who can say the Buddha’s words are untrue?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nYanzi did not contend; Sui Hui could endure lowliness.\nXiahui bared his chest; Master De endured being spat upon.\nPraised in their time, their fragrant names endure in records and biographies.\nWith hearts harmonious and qi at peace, they smiled as they observed the world’s changes.\nLike an empty boat or drifting tiles—what cause had they for resentment?\n\n\"Receiving favor as if startled.\"\n\nThe *Scripture* states in the *Chapter on Favor and Disgrace*: \"Favor is lowly; gaining it as if startled, losing it as if startled—this is called favor and disgrace as if startled.\" Yet in this passage, it is also said: \"Receiving favor as if startled.\" Then is receiving favor truly like being startled?\n\nGenerally, fortune harbors misfortune within.\nWhen receiving favor, one cannot avoid excess and fullness.\nShould fullness reach its peak, then boundless calamities lie concealed within.\nOnce favor is lost, disaster inevitably erupts—how could one not truly be startled?\n\nThus the noble person receives it ever as if startled.\nFormerly, when Wang Wenzhenggong Dan first passed the imperial examination, he was appointed magistrate of Pingjiang, then vice-prefect of Zhengzhou. Soon after, he was named Right Rectifier of Remonstrance and Drafter of Edicts, then Academician of the Jixian Hall, and promoted to Hanlin Academician. He was appointed Vice Minister of Works, then Participant in Government Affairs, and elevated to Grand Councilor. He accompanied the emperor on the Feng and Shan sacrifices, the rites at Fenyin, and served as commissioner for the Jade Pure Luminous Response Palace, welcoming the sacred image and the celestial writings carved in jade. At the Taiji Temple in Yanzhou, he presented the imperial regalia and was enfeoffed as Grand Preceptor, concurrently Minister of State. In his later years, his rank grew ever more exalted. Whenever his family offered congratulations, he would stop them, saying: \"With such fortune, my anxiety only deepens—what is there to celebrate?\" When he served as envoy for the court’s rites and departed the capital in the imperial carriage, all the officials gathered to see him off, unanimously praising his illustrious favor. Yet he said otherwise: \"I only feel restless and uneasy.\"\n\nCould others in his place have done the same?\nWhen Zhang Zhongdinggong Yong was appointed Vice Minister of Personnel, he said to his confidant Li Tian: \"Now I have received the sagely grace to be promoted to Minor Steward of the Celestial Office—how fearful, how fearful! If one reflects on the descent, the self remains secure; if one reflects on the ascent, then ruin is surely near.\"\n\nWith a trembling countenance as though gripped by fear—could others in his place have done the same? Precisely because he was thus, he was able to retain his favor. Had he been otherwise, he would not have escaped swift calamity and ruin. Have you not heard of Lu Duoxun and Zhong Fang?\n\nWhen Lu Duoxun was first appointed Vice Director of the Chancellery, his attire and possessions grew increasingly lavish. His father, Yi, grew solemn and displeased, saying: \"Our family has always been modest scholars—now, with sudden wealth and honor, we have come to this. I know not where we shall finally rest our carriage.\" Duoxun paid no heed to his father’s words and ultimately met with disaster.\n\nWhen Zhong Fang was first summoned by the court, his reputation soared. His mother grew furious and rebuked him: \"I warned you five times over not to gather disciples or seek fame—now you are indeed known, and no longer at peace.\" Fang disregarded his mother’s words and was ultimately undone by his renown. Both failed to treat favor with the awe it demands.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen the sacrificial vessel gleams with azure and yellow,\nit is the tree’s doom.\nWhen the lone calf is clad in embroidered silk,\ncan it live in the wilds?\nRank and eminence are but borrowed things,\nfleeting as passing shadows.\nTo covet glory while seeking self-preservation\nis the womb of disaster.\nThose who know the Dao—\nhow could they not tremble?\n\n*This concludes Scroll Four of the* **Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response**.\n*Scroll Five of the* **Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response** *begins.*\n\n**The Account of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\n**On Bestowing Kindness Without Seeking Recompense**\n\nThe *Tradition* states: The noble person acts with intention in bestowing kindness, but without intention in seeking recompense. If one acts with intention in seeking recompense, then self-interest lies in the reward. Such an act is not truly for another. Recompense may not be certain, but resentment will surely precede it—how can this be called kindness? Thus, recompense unattained is ever present in kindness given without intent.\n\nLong ago, Shang Lin served as magistrate of Wushan. The county commandant, Li Zhu, was most fierce and unruly. Without warning, he fell gravely ill. Lin took pity on him and asked if he had any last wishes. The commandant wiped his tears and spoke of his aged mother and young daughter. When he died, Lin set aside a portion of his salary to send the mother and her son’s coffin back to Hedong, and he arranged for the daughter’s marriage into a respectable family. One night, Lin dreamed of the commandant as if alive, bowing and weeping: \"You have no son. Moved by your kindness, I have petitioned the Emperor with all my strength. Now I am permitted to become your son.\" That very month, Lin’s wife conceived. The following year, as Lin resigned his post and traveled downstream, whenever he passed treacherous rapids, he glimpsed the commandant standing faintly on the shore, as if pointing the way. Nearing Jingzhou, he dreamed again of the commandant, who said: \"Tomorrow I shall be born in your residence. You must send a small box to the birthing chamber.\" Lin prepared a small box filled with millet, ready for gruel, and called it *he*. The child was named Ying. As he grew, he was exceedingly generous, quick to benevolence, and deeply filial. He rose to the rank of secretary in the Court of Judicial Review.\n\nYuwen Yingdi initially oversaw the prisons of Qianjiang. A local man, Fu Ai, had often lodged complaints against the officials of the Transport Bureau. When Fu was later imprisoned on unrelated charges, the officials, resentful, sought to fabricate evidence against him. Yingdi, indignant, vigorously defended him, and the sentence was ultimately reduced. Three years later, Yingdi traveled home along the official route, sailing downstream from Nanbin. It was the sixth month when suddenly a great rain fell, and the waters surged violently, waves towering like mountains. The towline snapped midstream, and the boatmen clasped their hands, resigned to capsizing. Then, a small boat emerged faintly through the mist and waves, drawing near to rescue them. Once ashore, they saw it was Fu Ai. Gazing at one another in astonishment, they exclaimed: \"When I once adjudicated the case in Qian, I had no particular intent toward you. Today, you risked your life to come—did you know the drowning man was I? Was this heaven’s design to make the matter known?\" They sighed together for a long while.\n\nAlas! When Lin acted as he did for the commandant, he thought only, *We are colleagues; this is how it should be*—how could he have known of the recompense of a son today? When Yingdi acted as he did for Fu Ai, he thought only, *This is how a case should be judged*—how could he have known of the recompense of rescue from drowning today? These were both acts of kindness without intent, recompense unattained. Had there been intent, the outcome would not have been the same.\n\nThe ancient saying goes: \"Kindness, though bestowed indiscriminately, may meet with unexpected reciprocity; resentment must not be provoked, lest one encounter an adversary on a narrow path.\" Truly, these are words of profound wisdom.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nFear and compassion arise spontaneously from the seven emotions of the heart.\nWhen one seeks reputation through private connections, the mind of profit takes root.\nBenevolence is the natural principle of heaven, flourishing when it encounters the world.\nProfit, however, is human desire—its end inevitably leads to strife.\nA hair’s breadth may span a thousand miles; one must weigh matters carefully.\nTo give to others without regret is the way.\n\nThe *Tradition* says: Laozi declared, \"Having acted for others, one finds oneself ever more abundant; having given to others, one finds oneself ever more enriched.\" Generally, when people confront wealth, most become miserly—some refuse to part with even a single hair, while others give only to regret it later. Yet here are those who give without remorse. How could this be, if not for true joy in generosity? From this, fortune and virtue grow ever greater—is this not to be \"ever more abundant, ever more enriched\"?\n\nIn his youth, Liu Zhongtu once drank at a tavern where he saw a scholar about to call upon the Prefect of Wei to seek funds for his parents’ burial. Zhongtu asked, \"How much do you need?\" The scholar replied, \"Two hundred thousand cash.\" That very day, Zhongtu returned home, emptied all he possessed—one hundred taels of silver and tens of thousands in coin—and gave it all to the scholar without the slightest reluctance.\n\nWhen Master Fan Zhongyan sent his son Yaofu back to Gusuzhou to fetch wheat, their boat stopped at Danyang. There, Yaofu saw his old friend Shi Manqing, who had been unable to return home due to three unburied family members. Without hesitation, Yaofu gave him the entire five hundred *shi* of wheat on the boat. Upon returning home, before he could speak, Zhongyan asked, \"Did you see your old friend?\" Yaofu replied that Manqing had three unburied dead. Zhongyan said, \"Why did you not give him the wheat on the boat?\" Yaofu answered, \"I already did.\" His face lit up with joy. Could such men as these ever regret their actions? These were indeed great men, and such deeds were only fitting. Yet even among those of lesser stature, such people are not absent.\n\nConsider Li Qian, a wealthy man. During a year of famine, he lent a thousand *shi* of grain to his fellow villagers. The following year, famine struck again, and the people had nothing to repay him.\n\nLi Qian then gathered the villagers and burned the debt records before them, declaring, \"The debts are settled. No repayment is needed.\" The following year brought a bountiful harvest, and the people rushed to repay him, but he accepted nothing. The year after, famine struck again, and Li Qian exhausted his family’s wealth to set up gruel stations, saving tens of thousands of lives. Those who perished, he buried. Someone remarked, \"Your hidden virtue is vast.\" Li Qian replied, \"Hidden virtue is like ringing in the ears—only the self perceives it. If others now know, how can it still be called virtue?\"\n\nAnother man, Li Haoran, also wealthy, spent over forty years aiding the poor and distressed without the slightest slackening. Could such men as these ever regret their actions?\n\nLater, Liu Fan rose to prominence, and the grandsons of both Lis passed the imperial examinations. As the saying goes, \"The more one gives, the more one gains\"—was this not so?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo begin virtue and not see it through—this the ancients despised.\nBetter to incur one’s own resentment than to demand fulfillment of promises.\nThe noble man is not stingy; he acts decisively in doing good.\nWealth despised and cast aside is shallow when hoarded.\nTo act within one’s means—this is true convenience.\nSuch are the so-called good men.\n\nThe *Traditions* states: Confucius said, \"Good men I have never seen. If I could see those who are constant in virtue, that would suffice.\" But how then does one cultivate and adorn oneself to reach such a state? There is no other way—only by practicing the words in this text can one attain it.\n\nThe text says: As a minister, be loyal; as a child, be filial; among siblings, be harmonious; between husband and wife, be concordant. Rectify yourself to transform others, and extend compassion to all things. Do not deceive in darkness, nor tread crooked paths. Advance and retreat with the Dao, accumulate merit through deeds. Console the widowed, pity the orphaned, respect the aged, cherish the young. Grieve at misfortune, rejoice in goodness. Aid the urgent, rescue the imperiled. Do not flaunt your strengths nor expose others’ faults. Suppress evil, praise good. Take little, give much. Bear insult without resentment, receive favor with awe. Bestow kindness without seeking repayment, give to others without regret. Rejoice in others’ gains as your own, grieve at their losses as your own. Extend your benevolence even to insects, your kindness even to plants. Those who walk this path—are they not good men?\n\nFormerly, when the retired Grand Councilor Li Fang was honored during the Lantern Festival, Emperor Taizong ordered a palanquin to welcome him, seated him beside the imperial throne, and personally poured him wine from the imperial goblet. Selecting the finest fruits and delicacies, the emperor bestowed them upon him, saying, \"Men like you are truly good men and noble gentlemen. Though you held the highest offices, you never harbored thoughts of harming others—this is why I hold you in esteem.\"\n\nUpon returning home, Li Fang told his sons, \"Though I have no extraordinary achievements to astonish the world, I have never obscured others’ virtues, envied others’ advancement, deceived in darkness, or overstepped my bounds. In these four matters, I can say I have walked the path faithfully. Now, the Son of Heaven has honored me before the assembled ministers, calling me a good man and noble gentleman. Such titles are the highest praise for a man. Even Confucius said, ‘If I do not see such a person, how dare I claim the title?’ You must remember the emperor’s words of praise and my lifelong practice of these four principles. Be loyal to your lord, filial to your parents, cultivate yourself with care, and perhaps you may avoid disgrace.\"\n\nHis son, Li Zong’e, faithfully upheld his father’s teachings and became a renowned figure of his time.\n\nWhen Minister Li Mu passed away, the emperor personally attended the funeral, weeping bitterly. Turning to his attendants, he said, \"Does Heaven not wish good men to assist me? Why take him so soon?\"\n\nLi Zong’e asked Li Fang, \"What did my uncle do to move the emperor to such grief?\" Li Fang replied, \"Minister Li was pure, upright, and unassuming, free from desire. He was forthright without offending others, yielding without compromise. His learning was comprehensive, his judgment profound and refined—truly a man of great elegance. Moreover, he excelled in governance and was kind in his dealings with others. Thus, on the day of his passing, all who knew him—and even those who did not—lamented in unison. How else could he have moved the emperor, the lord of ten thousand chariots, to attend his funeral and weep so deeply?\"\n\nAlas! The path these two men walked truly embodied the text’s definition of a good man. To be called a good man—was this not fitting?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nThe *Qian* hexagram’s six yang lines—with the *yuan* as the chief of goodness—admit not even an inch of shadow, pure as the celestial image. To receive the center of Heaven, one must cultivate it within. Extend this and act upon it: ease and benefit come through diligence. As yang grows and yin wanes, this heart expands to the breadth of Heaven. All people revere such a one.\n\nAs the tradition records: When Juyuan served as county magistrate, he once purchased silk in the public hall, personally unrolling the bolts himself. His maidservant, observing from behind the screen, grew indignant and said, “Who would have thought that today I would be made to serve a silk merchant’s clerk?” She demanded to leave, and none could dissuade her.\n\nWhen Fan Feng was Imperial Censor, there was a gatekeeper who had served in the Censorate for over forty years, having attended more than twenty censors. He could always discern a censor’s worth: when the censor was virtuous, the staff he held would lie horizontally as he bowed; otherwise, it stood upright. This saying had long been known. Those who became censors feared nothing more than his staff standing straight. One day, when it did, Fan Feng asked in alarm what was wrong. The gatekeeper replied, “Lately, I have seen the Censor repeatedly summon guests to instruct the kitchen—four or five times already. I thought to myself: if he ever becomes chief minister, will he not be just as fussy, meddling in every trifle? My heart truly disdains such pettiness, and so, unthinkingly, my staff stood straight.” Fan Feng, deeply ashamed, apologized again and again.\n\nAlas! Even a single misstep in conduct may cost one the respect of servants and subordinates—how much more so the reverence of all people? Know then that those whom all revere must truly be worthy of reverence. Have you not heard of the cases of Lord Wen and Grand Remonstrator Liu?\n\nWhen Lord Wen journeyed to the capital, the imperial guards, upon seeing him, could not help but raise their hands to their brows in salute. Even the common folk blocked his path, pleading, “Do not return home yet—stay and assist the Son of Heaven, that the people may live.” When Wang Bizhi passed through Qingzhou, he encountered hundreds of villagers who cheered and leapt for joy, crying out, “If Sima becomes chief minister, we shall all rejoice!” When Lord Wen passed away, the people of the capital closed their markets to mourn, selling their clothes to offer libations. Those who gathered for his funeral numbered tens of thousands. Even the elders of Fengzhou in Lingnan came in procession, over nine hundred of them burning incense upon their heads. Could such things occur if all did not revere him?\n\nWhen Grand Remonstrator Liu served in the Song court, people said: “To pass through Nanjing without seeing Attendant Liu is like visiting Sizhou without paying homage to the Great Sage.” When he died, the elderly, scholars, commoners—even women, children, farmers, and marketplace vendors—all vied to bring incense and recite Buddhist scriptures as they wept. The crowd at his gate was so dense that none could enter; thus, a great brazier was set in the hall to receive their offerings, and the price of incense soared. Could such things occur if all did not revere him?\n\nAnother example: When Lord Yi served in the Grand Secretariat, Yang Wengong, known for his jesting nature, would tease and mock all his colleagues without exception—save for Lord Yi, of whom he said, “I dare not jest with the Fourth Hall Academician.” Chen Xiang, Chen Lie, Zhou Ximeng, and Zheng Mu, all devoted to understanding Heaven and exhausting human nature, took the weight of the world as their own duty. Scholars revered them as the Four Masters. Even the most unruly and insolent dared not show disrespect at their gates.\n\nLord Fu Wenzhong once rode a small boat past Tianjin Bridge.\n\nThe crowd following to observe him emptied the marketplace. Xu Xiaojie built a hut beside his father’s grave, and the city’s people came daily to pay their respects, likewise emptying the marketplace. Shen Yan’s independent conduct and singular integrity caused merchants to rise when he passed through the market. Whenever Shao Kangjie went out, the city’s scholars and officials would all turn their shoes backward to welcome him. Could such things occur if all did not revere them? Yet are they truly worthy of reverence, or is it simply that reverence arises wherever it finds a place?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe heart of reverence arises\nbefore any act is done.\nAs with Lin Zong’s headscarf\nor the purple fungus on Zi’s brows—\neven in the case of Junshi,\nknown even to the lowest servant.\nNot sought from others,\nothers come to it of themselves.\nWere it not so,\nwhy would the Uyghurs bow to Zi Yi?\nThe Dao of Heaven protects them.\n\nThe *Tradition* says: The saying that “the Dao of Heaven protects them” is precisely what the *Book of Changes* means by “aided by Heaven, nothing is not auspicious.” Generally, the Dao of Heaven shows no partiality but constantly favors the good. Without speech, it responds with goodness; without summons, it comes of itself. If we truly possess it, we align with it; if we do not, we are not protected by it.\n\nIn former times, Liu Qizhi, having passed the imperial examination, did not immediately assume office but returned to his studies. He often took Lacquered Carving Kai’s inability to trust fully as a warning, which greatly impressed Master Wen. When first appointed as a remonstrance official, he submitted twenty-four memorials in defiance, discerning the uprightness and depravity of court ministers. He also presented nineteen memorials opposing the employment of the petty man Zhang Zihou, causing others to shrink back in fear—yet he remained undeterred. When Zihou gained power, the minister fled into exile amid slanderous rumors, his path fraught with peril like plum blossoms in early spring or the perilous edge of death. The thunderous clamor of gossip made even mention of his name a cause for dread. Of the eight provinces he traversed, he governed seven, and though the summer heat made the roads treacherous, he ensured his subordinates maintained strict oversight. Each day, he advanced one stage, sometimes braving the dangers of sea voyages. All believed he would surely perish, yet he remained unharmed, living to eighty without ever falling ill.\n\nDuring his exile, a grain merchant, discerning Zihou’s intent, volunteered to assassinate him. Zihou promptly promoted the man from a minor post to transport commissioner of the region. The assassin rushed to within twenty *li* of the minister’s place of exile, intending to carry out his deed the following day. His attendants trembled with fear. Yet at midnight, a sudden clamor arose—it seemed the commissioner had been struck by some unseen force, vomiting blood and dying instantly. Had he not perished, the minister would have met his end. If not for the Dao of Heaven protecting him, could such a thing have come to pass?\n\nGeng Ziyu was likewise a man of virtue. When his father, serving as prefect of Baxi, was transferred to Ning Shu and died there, Ziyu escorted the coffin home. Autumn floods swelled the rivers, with only the tips of submerged rocks breaking the surface. The currents of Qutang Gorge were especially fierce, and as rain threatened, the boatmen grew terrified. Ziyu lifted his gaze to the heavens and wept aloud. Before his lament ended, the waters receded by over twenty *zhang*. Once they had passed, the river returned to its former state. Had the waters not subsided, who can say what might have befallen them? If not for the Dao of Heaven protecting him, could such a thing have come to pass?\n\nKnow this: the Dao of Heaven’s protection lies within oneself. How much more so for those of loyalty and filial piety, the crown of all virtues? Such goodness stands foremost.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nHeaven is impartial principle,\nacting as it must.\nWithout preference or aversion,\nwho wields its power?\nIt aids the good, upholds virtue,\nsupports the upright, exalts the worthy.\nFollowing the auspicious path,\nit responds in kind.\nWho protects me?\nHeaven within myself.\nFortune and emolument follow.\n\nThe *Tradition* says: As the *Book of Songs* declares,\n*\"Joyful is the noble man—\nfortune and emolument extend him;\njoyful is the noble man—\nfortune and emolument enrich him.\"*\nThis is the meaning of \"follow\" in the preceding passage. Generally, good and noble men, through their auspicious kindness, naturally attract fortune and emolument. Thus, wherever they go, these come unbidden, as if in pursuit.\n\nFormerly, Minister Fu Zhenggong, for his forthright remonstrance, incurred the displeasure of the chief minister, who recommended him for a mission to the unpredictable barbarians. At that time, Minister Ouyang Wenzhong submitted a memorial citing the case of Lu Qi recommending Yan Zhenqing to Li Xilie, warning that the chief minister sought to harm Zhenggong. Though the memorial went unanswered, by the time Zhenggong reached the barbarians, their ruler and ministers were reciting his words, seeking peace with the Middle Kingdom and eschewing war for nearly a hundred years. Upon his return, he was appointed Academician of the Bureau of Military Affairs, then Hanlin Academician, then Vice Director of the Bureau—each post he firmly declined. A month later, he was named Director of the Bureau, and again he refused. The emperor insisted on waiting for him before proceeding with court. Was this not fortune and emolument following him as a matter of course?\n\nSuch great fortune and emolument are not the sort that ordinary achievers dare aspire to. Yet speaking of each in their own circumstances, any attainment is fortune and emolument.\n\nThe physician Zhen Baili was originally a coarse and common man, yet he applied his mind with diligence. Regardless of the illness—great or small—he rushed to attend to it. One day, when the emperor fell ill, someone recommended his skill. After a single dose, the emperor recovered. Thereafter, he was favored above all other physicians, entering and leaving the palace for half a year. The gold he amassed was piled like ripe grain, totaling over twenty thousand pieces. The wine he stored in fine vessels exceeded three thousand *hu*. Though this may not be deemed fortune and emolument in the grandest sense, for Zhen himself, compared to his former days, was it not fortune and emolument?\n\nKnow this: fortune and emolument following one also lie within oneself.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nYan Yuan dwelt in a humble lane,\nBoyi and Shuqi starved on Shouyang.\nPoverty befell Yuan Xian,\npunishment claimed Fan Pang.\nThe response of fortune and emolument\nseems almost perverse.\nYet know these men\nrival the sun and moon in splendor.\nThis fortune, this emolument,\nshines bright for a thousand ages.\nThe multitude of evils shuns them.\n\nThe *Tradition* says: The multitude of evils refers to all that is unrighteous, for their kinds are manifold. Generally, the paths of right and wrong diverge and cannot coexist. Where right prevails, wrong cannot abide. It is like the sun shining upon an iceberg—the sun remains unchanged, while the ice must melt. The \"shunning\" is seen in ancient examples: spells could not touch Tan Xian, and the moon goddess dared not appear before Liang Gong.\n\nFormerly, the Daoist Lu Xiujing and his followers were skilled in incantations. They could cause monks’ robes and palace beams to tremble and rise, boasting of their prowess as if they were immortals. When the Dharma Master Tan Xian heard of this, he rebuked them: \"You have not yet met a true adversary—how dare you indulge in such petty tricks?\" He placed the robe of Master Zhou the Meditator on the ground and bade them cast their spells. The Daoists exerted all their power, but the robe would not move. Xian then took it himself and placed it upon a beam, commanding them to enchant the beam—yet it too remained unmoved. Lu Xiujing and his followers shrank back, their faces drained of color.\n\nAs for Wu Sansi, he once acquired a concubine named Su E, a woman of unparalleled beauty.\n\nAt every banquet with court officials, he would bring her out to boast of her beauty. One day, he invited Di Renjie. As Renjie was about to arrive, Su E hid herself away and refused to emerge. Wu entered and called for her, but she retreated into the innermost recesses of the hall, her voice as faint as a silken thread: \"I am but a spirit of flowers and moonlight. The Duke is a man of true integrity—how dare I appear before him?\" From that day forth, she never emerged again.\n\nThose like Master Fang and his peers are such men. As for Fang Qianzhi, he dwelt in purity and stillness, delighting in the savor of the Dao. In the region where he resided, mountain miasma and malaria were rampant. When Qianzhi inscribed his name for the afflicted, none failed to recover at once. Some begged him for his method, and Qianzhi replied: \"I have heard that a rectified heart can dispel evil. I live in poverty and have no wealth to offer, so I daily recite the *Dharma-Wheel Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue*, rejoice in all good deeds, and cultivate compassion to quell wickedness. I believe this suffices to heal myself and others—nothing more.\"\n\nSuch are those whose names alone keep evil at bay. As for Zhang Guaiya, he remained steadfast from beginning to end, unyielding in any circumstance. He was close friends with the reclusive scholar Fu Lin. One day, they met in the outskirts, drinking deep into the night as their conversation flowed. At the time, a great epidemic raged in that region, and many in the neighboring households fell ill.\n\nThat very night, the afflicted awoke as if cleansed, all instantly cured, and many beheld ghostly apparitions departing. Such was the power that fled at the mere presence of these two gentlemen—this is what it means to make evil retreat at the sound of one’s name.\n\nAs for Lord Peng Da, he was a man of serene detachment, few desires, and scrupulous integrity. Once, when he served as prefect of Huzhou, the official residence was long notorious for its hauntings; none of his predecessors had ever dwelled there in peace. Yet from the moment he took office until his departure, he never once inquired whether the spirits were present or not. The spirits, for their part, dared not display their tricks, and all remained perfectly calm throughout—never causing the slightest disturbance. This is what it means to make evil retreat at the mere sight of one’s person. Was it not because his inner power subdued them?\n\nIn contrast, when Zhang Xuangan took up his post as Transport Commissioner of Huainan, matters unfolded quite differently. Soon after his arrival, he was daily harassed by malevolent spirits. There happened to be a military officer skilled in exorcism, so Zhang summoned him to deal with the problem. Upon arrival, the officer rebuked the spirits: “The Commissioner is a high-ranking official entrusted with grave imperial duties. What manner of ghosts are you, to dare disturb him?” The spirits burst into laughter and replied: “Do you take us for one of your bureaucratic underlings, scraping by with hollow flattery just to secure a promotion?” From that point on, they grew even more brazen—smearing filth everywhere, darting about wildly, utterly uncontrollable. Was this not because neither man possessed the power to subdue them?\n\nIn praise it is said: In an age where the Dao prevails, even ghosts lose their efficacy.\n\nWhen clarity and brightness reside within, nothing can conceal its true nature. With thoughts free from deceit, what remains is sincerity. Once the great character is firmly established, even thunder cannot startle. When this qi is never depleted, what being would dare to oppose it? The spirits and divinities protect such a one.\n\nThe tradition states: \"Spirits and divinities are those who are perceptive, enlightened, upright, and just—they exist everywhere. What they revere is the Dao and virtue; what they accompany is loyalty and filial piety; what they align with is uprightness; what they favor is hidden virtue. How then can a person lack these four qualities? If one truly possesses them, the spirits and divinities will invariably offer protection.\"\n\nFormerly, when Han Wei Gong was transferred from Chengde to assume command in Zhongshan, he was approaching the Sha River. His vanguard returned to report: \"The waters have risen violently; we cannot proceed.\" The Duke said: \"We have already come this far—what use is it to avoid it now?\" He ordered boats to be prepared at once. No sooner had he crossed than the baggage train was still passing when waves surged like mountains, and some of the rear cavalry had yet to ford. At that moment, the people of Xujizhi all witnessed that as the Duke was crossing, a divine dragon coiled upstream, causing the waters to stand still and shallow.\n\nMei Gongyi once governed Huazhou. One night, word came that the Yellow River had breached its banks. He immediately led his officials and personally directed the soldiers and laborers to rush to the river, reinforcing the dikes wherever needed. Just as they were in dire straits, they clearly saw an old man with white whiskers, ferrying a boatload of straw, coming and going to assist them. Thinking him a local magnate, the Duke’s heart rejoiced. But when the waters subsided and dawn broke, he sent an officer to summon the man—only to find that the white-whiskered elder had vanished. These were all instances of spirits and divinities offering protection.\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nThe Way of the divine is wisdom, clarity, and uprightness.\nVast and boundless above, it observes the minute and the hidden.\nIt rebukes and restrains misfortune,\nto serve those of virtue and power.\nNot that the divine seeks anything—\nit simply fulfills its duty.\nThe wicked, by contrast, are punished by the divine.\n\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Five (conclusion)\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Six\n\n**Biography of Li Changqi**\n**Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nWhatever he undertook was sure to succeed.\n\nIt is said: In the world, there is no task that cannot be accomplished, no person who cannot achieve great things. If one possesses the will, nothing is beyond attainment. In former times, the grandfather of Zhang Zhongbin was originally a man who schemed for profit, but he abruptly changed his ways and devoted himself to teaching his sons. His sons, Zhongrong and Zhongbin, both passed the imperial examinations. The following year, Zhong’an also passed. Yu Lingyi, originally a commoner of the marketplace, likewise transformed his ways and devoted himself to teaching his sons. His second son, Jie, and his nephew, Xiao, both passed the examinations as well. Thus, for those of determination who aspire to great deeds, is there anything that cannot be achieved? How much more so for those who strive to practice manifold good works?\n\nThe story of Duke Dou makes this clear. Dou Yujun of Yanshan had a dream in which his grandfather said to him: “You will have no sons and will not live long. Why not cultivate hidden virtue early to reverse your fate?” Terrified, Yujun thereafter assisted his relatives, both inner and outer, in holding funerals for the unburied and marrying off unwed daughters. He burned debt records to free a servant’s daughter, returned gold to one who had lost it, and undertook every possible act of virtue. He also built forty rooms in his residence, amassed ten thousand volumes of books, and invited scholars of letters and conduct to reside there as teachers. Aspiring students came of their own accord, and from this, talented men gathered from all directions. Those who rose to prominence through his gate followed one after another.\n\nIn his own lifetime, Duke Dou rose to the position of Left Remonstrating Grand Master and died at the age of eighty without illness. Now a Perfected Immortal of the Grotto-Heavens, he later had five sons, all of whom passed the imperial examinations: Yi, Minister of Rites; Yan, Vice Minister of Rites; and Kan, Left Rectifier of Omissions.\n\nCheng served in the Grand Council; Xi became Gentleman for Court Ceremonies. Alas! He desired longevity and attained it; he desired sons and had five; he desired rank and received it; he cultivated virtue and ascended as a Perfected Immortal. Then can anything one undertakes in this world fail to come to fruition?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nSeeking benevolence, one attains benevolence—such were Shuqi and Boyi.\nDiligently pursuing profit, one meets the fate of Robber Zhi.\nHeaven rewards the good, while evil ripens in due course.\nGreed, deceit, and cunning—each act bears its consequence.\nSuccess or failure, good or ill—its end is ever foreseeable.\nYet the Way of Immortals may still be hoped for.\n\nAs the tradition records: Zhang Yang perused the *Daoist Canon* and saw a wall-fish with a five-colored body, resplendent and dazzling. When he opened the scripture, he found that the characters for \"immortal\" had been entirely eaten away by bookworms. Thus he knew that the wall-fish, having consumed the characters for \"immortal,\" had gained its five-colored form. He Ruo once acquired a scroll of the *Daoist Scripture of Rites* and found within it an object resembling a coiled lock of hair, about four inches in circumference, endless in its loop. When he cut it, water flowed from both ends, filling more than a liter. He asked many, but none could identify it. One day, he encountered a Daoist adept and inquired. The adept said, \"That you met this thing yet failed to ascend—such is your fate. This is a *maiwang*, born of a wall-fish that has thrice consumed the characters for 'immortal.' When held to the light of the stars, it summons celestial messengers, and one may obtain the Elixir of Return. Drinking its water transforms the bones.\" He Ruo returned home, read the scroll in full, and found that every instance of the characters for \"immortal\" had indeed been eaten away. Thus he knew that a wall-fish, having thrice consumed the characters for \"immortal,\" could transform into a *maiwang*.\n\nAlas! Even an insect may achieve this—how much more so a human who aspires to immortality! There is nothing unattainable in such hope. Generally, humans and immortals share the same true nature; it is only that emotions prevail, and one loses this truth. Once one returns to truth and sheds worldly attachments entirely, one becomes an immortal. Moreover, if one aids this with goodness, seeking examples from antiquity—such as Zhang Liang’s loyalty, Wu Meng’s filial piety, Wang Jinxian’s unwavering chastity, Lan Qi’s fraternal devotion, Liu Yi’s selfless generosity, Zhao Sutai’s relief of the poor and burial of the dead, Master Xu’s healing with talismans and water, Yan Pingjun’s guidance through virtue, Zhou Bochi’s burial of abandoned remains, Li Wulang’s honesty in measurement, Chen Anshi’s refusal to take life, Li Xizi’s rescue of starving birds, Yang Jingzhi’s tranquil meditation, Tang Ruoshan’s freedom from anger, Huang Wanyou’s few faults, Jing Xiang’s passion for liberating living creatures—even Liu Pinga, originally a physician; Wu Mu, a county clerk; Liu Yan, a courtesan; Bao Jing, an innkeeper; He Sheng, a butcher; Ding Yue, a soldier; Zhu, a bandit; Li Zhengxuan, a hunter—all ascended from mortal to immortal.\n\nIn our own time, Chao Gongxiong became the Heavenly Lord of Tranquil Abode; Master Zhang Wenqi, the Perfected Lord of Life and Destiny; Wang Gongsu, Attendant Gentleman of the Jade Capital; Lü Gonghui, Censor of the Celestial Court; Han Gongqi, Master of the Purple Palace; Fu Gongbi, Overseer of Kun Terrace; Wang Gongsou, Keeper of the Iron Wheel of the Sagely Protector; Jin Sansan, Wind Earl of the Sagely Assistant; Zhang Xiaoji, Master of Mount Song; Dou Yujun, Perfected Immortal of the Grotto-Heavens; Ouyang Xiu, Master of Divine Clarity; Wang Anguo, Master of Lingzhi; Lü Qin, Master of the Jade Assembly; Shi Yannian, Master of Hibiscus; Chen Jing, Judge of the Bureau of Merit; Tian Chengjun, Master of Weiyang—these, too, ascended from mortal to immortal.\n\nThe scriptures state: In the Left Grotto-Yang Palace of the Second Grade of the Middle Primordial, which governs the Nine Imperial Mounds of Earth, the Four Corners, and the Eight Extremities, the divine officials and their subordinates number ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine thousand. All were persons of merit in the world who, upon receiving the Daoist precepts, were promoted to their posts. For example, He Xizhi of our prefecture, who annotated the *Diamond Sutra* to benefit the world, was posthumously appointed Inspector of the Western Marchmount and held various offices. Though this was a position in the Marchmount’s administration, it was still a promotion through the Daoist precepts. Who then can say that immortality is unattainable?\n\nYet some aspire to it and ultimately fail—not because immortality is unattainable, but because their cultivation was insufficient. Have you not heard the words of the Two Perfected? Zhongli Quan said, \"Immortals seek humans more earnestly than humans seek immortals.\" Lü Dongbin said, \"People lament not seeing me, yet even if they saw me daily and did not follow my words, what benefit would it bring?\" Both lamented that humans cannot attain immortality.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe Way of Immortals is often called remote and vague.\nSeeking yet not finding—Emperor Wu of Han was shamed.\nLike the Buddhist teachings of hell and heaven:\nIf heaven truly exists, it must be the abode of the loyal and good.\nIf hell truly exists, it must be the domain of the petty and base.\nThose who seek celestial immortality must perform one thousand three hundred good deeds;\nThose who seek earthly immortality must perform three hundred.\n\nAs the tradition states: The distinction between celestial and earthly immortals lies in the difference in the number of good deeds performed. This has already been explained in the text and need not be discussed further. Let us speak instead of advancing beyond the hundred-foot pole—those who have already attained immortality will not fall but ascend further; those who have not yet attained need not seek elsewhere, for they may reach it this very day.\n\nŚākyamuni said: There are ten kinds of immortals:\n1. Earth-Walking Immortals,\n2. Flying Immortals,\n3. Wandering Immortals,\n4. Void-Traveling Immortals,\n5. Heaven-Walking Immortals,\n6. All-Pervading Immortals,\n7. Dao-Practicing Immortals,\n8. Radiant Immortals,\n9. Essence-Preserving Immortals,\n10. Transcendent Immortals.\n\nIt is further stated: All these follow not the true awakening but pursue deluded thoughts, fixating on preserving form and wandering in mountain forests where men do not tread. Though they live for thousands or ten thousand years, they remain bound to the cycle of rebirth—deluded, inverted, and confused. When their retribution is exhausted, they return, scattered into various destinies.\n\nThose who steadfastly ingest elixirs without ceasing, perfecting the Way of ingestion, are called Earth-Walking Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly consume herbs and plants without ceasing, perfecting the Way of medicine, are called Flying Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly refine metals and minerals without ceasing, perfecting the Way of transformation, are called Wandering Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly regulate movement and stillness without ceasing, perfecting the purity of qi, are called Void-Traveling Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly preserve seminal essence without ceasing, perfecting the nourishment of virtue, are called Heaven-Walking Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly refine essence and form without ceasing, perfecting the absorption of purity, are called All-Pervading Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly uphold incantations and prohibitions without ceasing, perfecting the arts of method, are called Dao-Practicing Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly cultivate contemplation without ceasing, perfecting the clarity of thought, are called Radiant Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly engage in union without ceasing, perfecting the resonance of awakening, are called Essence-Preserving Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly master transformation without ceasing, perfecting the nature of awakening, are called Transcendent Immortals.\n\nZhongli Quan said: There are five kinds of immortals:\n1. Ghost Immortals,\n2. Human Immortals,\n3. Earthly Immortals,\n4. Divine Immortals,\n5. Celestial Immortals.\n\nIn response to a question on the Great Dao, he further stated: The Dao originally has no questions; questions originally have no answers. Among all things, the most intelligent and noble is man. If one can exhaust the principles of all things and fulfill one’s own nature, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to the utmost of destiny—preserving life in its entirety to harmonize with the Dao—then one naturally becomes as steadfast as heaven and earth and shares in their longevity.\n\nThose who do not awaken to the Great Dao but seek only swift attainment, making their minds like dead ashes and their forms like withered wood, inwardly guarding their spirit and unwavering in their resolve, may project their yin spirit in deep concentration. Yet in the end, they are but ethereal ghosts, not pure yang immortals, and are called Ghost Immortals.\n\nThose who briefly encounter the Great Dao among men, yet bear heavy karma and meager fortune, may retreat due to demonic obstacles or cling to one-sided practices without change—abstaining from the five flavors without knowing the six qi, forgetting the seven emotions without knowing the ten precepts, practicing swallowing and rinsing while mocking breath cultivation as misguided, dismissing stillness as foolish, delighting in seizing qi from heaven and earth without ceasing their grain intake, or fixating on visualization to absorb the essence of the sun and moon without practicing daoyin, sitting idly in solitude without recognizing natural movement, or laboring the body without understanding non-action—can only prolong their years in ease and comfort, and are called Human Immortals.\n\nThose who emulate the ascending and descending principles of heaven and earth, grasp the generative and consummative numbers of the sun and moon, employ years and months within the body and hours within the day, recognize the dragon and tiger, pair Kan and Li, discern the clarity and turbidity of the water source, distinguish the earliness and lateness of qi, gather the True One, observe the Two Modes, differentiate the Three Powers, divide the Four Images, arrange the Five Phases, stabilize the Six Qi, assemble the Seven Treasures, sequence the Eight Trigrams, practice the Five Phases, invert the Nine Provinces, transmit qi from mother to child, circulate fluids between husband and wife, reverse the Three Fields, refine the elixir to joy, permanently stabilize the lower field, refine the form to abide in the world, and attain longevity without death, are called Earthly Immortals.\n\nThose who, having attained Earthly Immortality, continue their practice without cease, transcend the ordinary and enter the sagely, and return to the Three Mountains, are called Divine Immortals.\n\nThose who, having attained Divine Immortality, transmit the Dao to the world, contribute to the Dao and benefit others, fulfill their merit and conduct, and ascend to the Grotto-Heavens to assume office as immortal officials—if they further render great service to heaven and earth and achieve great deeds across past and present—progress through the ranks, ascending through the thirty-six Grotto-Heavens, returning to the eighty-one Yang Heavens, and from there transcending into the realm of emptiness and spontaneity, are called Celestial Immortals.\n\nThus, what Śākyamuni called true awakening and Zhongli Quan called the Great Dao—what do they truly signify? True awakening is the Great Dao; the Great Dao is true awakening. In general, if one wishes to recognize one’s own mind without falling into conceptual understanding, have you not heard the teaching of *seng-nā*? *Seng-nā* said: Illuminate your own mind by constantly examining and reflecting in the midst of daily activities—walking, standing, sitting, and lying down. When encountering forms or sounds, before thoughts arise, where does the mind go? Is it existent? Is it nonexistent? If it does not fall into existence or nonexistence, the mind’s pearl shines alone, perpetually illuminating the world without the slightest obstruction, interruption, or discontinuity—this is true awakening, this is the Great Dao.\n\nThus, Master Lü, though unlearned in alchemy, attained deliverance into the world. Later, upon hearing the teaching “Do not abide anywhere, yet give rise to the mind,” his heart-mind became thoroughly enlightened. Having attained this enlightenment, he once offered meals to monks at Xinghua in Tan. Master Sun, though devoted to medical texts, attained deliverance into the world. Later, he sought instruction from the Vinaya Master Xuan of the Tang. Having received this instruction, he once listened to the *Treasure Pagoda Sutra* from an unnamed wandering monk in Chengdu. This is what it means to advance beyond the hundred-foot pole.\n\nAs for performing good deeds, it is naturally so; even without seeking immortality, it is naturally so.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThree hundred rituals, three thousand deportments—\nOnly through interaction with others is the human way fulfilled.\nAccumulating merit and piling up good deeds,\nThere must be sequence and priority.\nWith strict and detailed regulations,\nNot a hair’s breadth is amiss.\n\nThus is the immortal’s Dao: to harmonize humanity with Heaven. If one acts contrary to righteousness or moves against principle, the saying goes—Mencius said: \"Principle and righteousness are what all human hearts naturally affirm.\" What Mencius called righteousness is principle; in essence, principle and righteousness reside within humanity and must not be violated. Should one transgress them, one cannot avoid being swept away into turbid obscurity, sinking into mediocrity and base dealings, descending to every sort of degradation. How then could one dwell in purity and stillness, delighting in the savor of the Dao?\n\nLet me speak of one or two exemplary gentlemen, that others may know shame. Of old, Guo Yanqing was renowned for his literary refinement and conduct. Disdaining the shallowness of the age, he built a garden on the south bank of the river and dwelt there for over twenty years, never once setting foot in the city. In his youth, he kept company with Zhang Wending and Lü Wenmu. When Zhang and Lü successively became chief ministers, they recommended him to the court, but though he was offered an official post, he refused to accept it. At the time, Qian Weiyan, the cultured and refined, served as military governor; Xie Jiang was judicial administrator; Yin Zhu was secretary; and Ouyang Xiu was assistant magistrate—all men of literary and moral distinction who admired his character. One day, they dismissed their retinues and went together to visit Yanqing. After a long conversation, Yanqing served them wine in a pottery vessel with fruit and nuts. Weiyan, charmed by his rustic simplicity, drank deeply without restraint. As evening fell, an officer arrived to report that the hour of *shen* had passed, and the governor’s clerks and armed attendants were arrayed in the courtyard. Yanqing calmly asked, \"What offices do you gentlemen hold, that you travel with such a large retinue?\" Zhu pointed to Weiyan and said, \"This is the governor, the chief minister.\" Yanqing replied, \"I never imagined that today you would deign to visit a rustic like me.\" They all laughed heartily and drank several more cups. When the sun set, the officials took their leave. Yanqing saw them out, saying, \"I am old and infirm and cannot return your visit—pray do not be surprised.\" Weiyan mounted his carriage in a daze, as though he had entered the realm of immortals. Later, he sighed and said, \"How lightly this man regards wealth and honor!\" Such was a scholar-official who dwelt in purity and stillness, delighting in the savor of the Dao.\n\nAs for Du Wulang, he was originally a farmer, yet he too held firmly to his principles. His home lay thirty *li* from the county seat, consisting of only two small rooms—one for himself, the other for his son. There was nothing but an empty bed, with no other possessions.\n\nAt that time, Sun Zhen, the magistrate of Fanyang, admired his character and, seizing a moment of leisure, paid him a visit. After a long while, Du Wulang said, \"I am but a rustic with no ability—why have you come to see me?\" Sun asked why he never went out. He laughed and replied, \"I am of no use to the times and seek nothing from others—it is merely that I do not go out by chance.\"\n\nSun then asked how he made a living. Du said, \"Formerly, I lived south of the county, where I had half a *qing* of land, which I farmed together with my brother’s son. After my brother’s son married, I judged that the land would not suffice to support us both, so I gave it all to him. I then brought my wife and children here, where a villager had two vacant rooms, and I borrowed them to live in. At first, I sold medicines and selected auspicious days to support myself. When my son grew up, a villager gave me thirty *mu* of land to tenant. With surplus strength from farming, I also hired myself out to others. From then on, I had just enough, and as I did not wish to contend with others for profit, I abandoned all practices like medicine and divination.\"\n\nSun asked, \"What do you do all day?\" Du replied, \"I simply sit upright.\" Sun asked, \"Have you ever read scriptures?\" Du said, \"Twenty years ago, I once read a copy of the *Vimalakīrti Sutra*. At first, I found its discussions apt and quite admired them, but now I have forgotten it all, and the sutra itself is lost as well.\"\n\nAs they spoke, the hours passed, and Du’s bearing was free and unconstrained, his words precise and spare. Sun was deeply moved and sighed in admiration, \"Truly, he is a man of the Dao.\"\n\nSince then, I have often sought him out—a man who dwells in quietude among the fields and wilds, delighting in the savor of the Dao. Are not those who turn their backs on righteousness and reason, stopping at nothing, put to shame by such a one?\n\nIn praise I say:\nPrinciple is the essence of the Dharma,\nRighteousness its guiding rule.\nJudgment follows the truth of the matter,\nNot a hair’s breadth awry.\nWeighing each grain with caution,\nStill one may err by a stone’s weight—\nHow much more those who overstep the plumb line and square,\nIndulging in perversity and bias?\nIf such a one goes unpunished,\nWhat becomes of Heaven’s justice?\nTo take evil as ability,\nTo steel oneself to cruelty and harm—\nAs the saying goes: “The Dao of Heaven ever befriends the good,”\nYet you make evil your ability.\n“The great virtue of Heaven and Earth is life,”\nYet you steel yourself to cruelty and harm.\nTo defy Heaven and turn your back on Earth—\nIf not you, then who?\nThe so-called “able” do not see their own wrong;\nThe so-called “hardened” lack all pity.\nAmong all evils, none is worse than this;\nAmong all cruelties, none more grievous.\nThe hells were established precisely for such people.\nWhen the time comes, will the minions of Ox-Head and Horse-Face spare you their merciless hands?\nI urge you, by the teaching of compassion,\nTo swiftly save them,\nLest they reach the point where deeds are done and cannot be undone.\n\nLong ago, a monk from the Western Regions named Juecheng came to China. Yang Yi, Duke Wengong, upon meeting him, treated him with great courtesy. Later, when the monk sought to depart, he could not be detained.\n\nThe translator was then instructed to ask the monk, who replied: “In my homeland, no one eats meat. Now that I have entered China, everywhere I see the slaughter of pigs and sheep, their flesh hung in the markets—I cannot bear the sight. I do not wish to stay here long; I will make a brief pilgrimage to Mount Wutai to pay homage to Mañjuśrī, then return home.”\n\nThere is a line in a poem by the mountain recluse: *“Its fangs are already clenched like a child’s fist.”* When Zhang Ge first read this, he frowned in displeasure, calling the poet a cruel man. Yet this was merely the poet’s description of a thing—hardly an act of cruelty. Zhang, then serving as judicial officer in Henei, had followed the example of his superior, Ge Fan, who ate only vegetables and chanted scriptures; Zhang, too, had given up meat, hence his reaction.\n\nIf all people could awaken as Master Jue did, or as Zhang did, and always regard all creatures with compassion, I am certain they would never dare to take evil for ability or steel themselves to cruelty and harm. For this reason, I first set forth these examples before briefly recounting the consequences of such acts.\n\nLong ago, Lu Xiaozheng sought to gather a swarm of bees but failed. Enraged, he poured boiling water over them, leaving none alive. Soon after, in the same place, he was suddenly stung to death by a giant bee.\n\nZhou Ang once napped during the day. On the door above him was a swallow’s nest, where three fledglings chirped, waiting to be fed. Ang, in a fury, stuffed thorns into their mouths, and all three died with their chests split open. Later, his three sons were all born mute.\n\nAt Jinhua Temple stood several cypress trees, which suddenly became infested with yellow caterpillars nearly two inches long. They devoured the branches and leaves without end. The monk Xiu Rong, repulsed, ordered them all swept away, buried, or discarded in a pile of firewood. His disciple, Xiu Ren, then spread the firewood in the sun to kill the remaining caterpillars before using it for fuel.\n\nYears later, when Xiu Rong died, another monk in the temple also passed away but later revived. He told Xiu Ren: “I saw Xiu Rong in the underworld, bearing an iron yoke beneath the scorching sun. Countless caterpillars swarmed over him, biting and gnawing—his suffering was unbearable.” Upon hearing this, Xiu Ren was seized with terror. Within days, he developed a carbuncle on his back and died.\n\nThe monk Xiu Zhun of Daci Temple had newly built a pavilion surrounded by bamboo. Ants crawled all over the railings. Enraged, Xiu Zhun immediately had the bamboo cut down, gathering all the ants and casting them into the fire. Soon after, he developed a scabies-like sore, worst on his face and head. A physician examined him and said: “This is called ‘ant-leakage sore’—it cannot be cured.” Not long after, he died.\n\nThen there was Wang Yu, who, angered by the cawing of magpies, cut out their tongues. Later, he died of a tongue ulcer. Zhang Lin, enraged by the croaking of frogs, poured hot ashes over them. Soon after, his body suddenly rotted as if scalded.\n\nIf this is how men treat creatures—taking evil for ability, steeling themselves to cruelty and harm—can they escape retribution for their deeds?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nZhi Bo’s wisdom, Pan Cheng’s talent,\nMing’s promotion of Dan Zhu, Jie’s praise of E Lai—\nAll were endowed by Heaven with rare gifts,\nLike trees bearing fruit in the wild.\nHad they used them for good,\nWho could have stopped them?\nTo wield such gifts for evil—\nIs this not lamentable?\nTo secretly harm the good and virtuous—\n\nAs the saying goes: *“Chen Ping was full of secret schemes; he knew he would have no descendants.”* Gongsun Hong favored open dealings, and his later generations faded into obscurity. Generally, those who rely on secret schemes cannot avoid open dealings, while those who favor open dealings may still harbor secret schemes. It is like shooting pellets at a target—most effective when done in darkness. Such methods cannot be used against others, and least of all against the good and virtuous.\n\nFor the good and virtuous are the people’s hope.\nIn a kingdom, they are its foundation;\nIn a village, they are its pillar.\n\nHow could one secretly harm them?\n\nLong ago, before Li Linfu rose to prominence, he encountered a Daoist at the Locust Altar who warned him: *\"Your name is already recorded in the registers of immortals. Even if you do not ascend to heaven in broad daylight, you are destined to become a grand councilor for twenty years of peace. When power is in your hands, remember my words—do not recklessly engage in secret harm.\"* Once Linfu attained high office, he no longer recalled the warning. Instead, he clung to favor and wrought much destruction. After some time, he dreamed of the Daoist reproaching him: *\"Have you forgotten my words? Now you have truly incurred guilt.\"* Thereupon, an underling led him to a place where Linfu heard only the rushing sound of wind and water in his ears. Upon arrival, he saw an imposing government office, its curtains and bedding lavishly adorned. Linfu rejoiced, saying: *\"Even if I were to dwell here, it would not be so bad.\"* The Daoist laughed: *\"This is the abode of scaled and shelled creatures. The suffering here is most cruel and bitter. If you still find it not bad, what then would you call evil?\"* Linfu was struck with terror, his sweat soaking through as he awoke. This is the fate of one who secretly harms the good and virtuous—reborn among aquatic creatures.\n\nXu Wengui was once summoned to the netherworld. For having saved a life, he was granted an extension of twelve years before being sent back. Upon his return, he saw a gate heavily guarded. When Xu asked the attendant about it, the official replied: *\"This is the capital prison. All those in the world who slander the loyal and good, ruin the virtuous, and habitually engage in secret harm—regardless of rank—are sentenced here after death.\"* This is the fate of one who secretly harms the good and virtuous—condemned to the underworld’s hells.\n\nWho would claim such deeds bear no guilt?\n\nTo be clear, open, and easily understood is to incline toward the yang. To be treacherous, ruthless, and deeply concealed is to incline toward the yin. One who dwells in the yin in life will return to the yin in death—this is the inevitable principle, and nothing strange. What are aquatic creatures, what are hells, if not realms of the yin?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n*To violate the law or manipulate it—*\n*Both are equally transgressions.*\n\nBrawling and premeditated murder alike are acts of killing. Yet when it comes to sentencing, their severity differs. Those who scheme with cunning and plot in secrecy—invoking even spirits and gods—may strike with deadly precision, but the harm they intend shall rebound upon themselves.\n\nTo secretly insult one’s lord or parent:\nAs the saying goes, for a minister, it is to indulge in deceitful flattery, spreading falsehoods—this is secret insult. For a child, it is to perform empty rituals without true devotion—this too is secret insult. In short, any minister or child who fails to fulfill their duty with utmost sincerity toward lord or parent commits secret insult. If all ministers secretly insult their lords, and all children secretly insult their parents, what then can lords and parents expect from their ministers and children? No greater harm to teaching and betrayal of the Way exists—this is why the Most High speaks of it.\n\nFormerly, Cao Bin, the Martial and Benevolent, even in moments of private leisure, always wore his official robes and sat with solemn dignity, as if in the presence of his lord and father. Upon returning to his private residence, he would shut his doors and remain in quiet seclusion, never recklessly receiving guests. At the first stir of the fifth watch, he would hasten to the palace gates to await the court bell. For eight years, he maintained this discipline, never once relaxing his conduct, even in the bitterest frost. Wang Dan, the Cultured and Upright Duke, even in his private quarters, conducted himself as if still at court. One day, returning from the palace, he donned his robes and entered his quiet chamber, sitting in silence without emerging. His family, alarmed, hastily sent his younger brother to inquire of Minister Zhao Anren. Anren replied: *\"Just now, a matter was discussed, and the Duke opposed its implementation. The decision was unresolved when he left—he must be troubled for the state.\"* Those who secretly insult their lords—do they not feel shame before such examples?\n\nGuo Cong lost his father in youth and lived alone with his mother. For thirty years, he sighed without ceasing, never eating meat or drinking wine, praying morning and night to extend his mother’s life. His mother, Lady Zhang, indeed lived to one hundred and four, her senses sharp, her appetite undiminished. Meng Xi was a common market vendor who sold fruit daily to support his parents. Though unlearned, he fulfilled the duties of warmth, care, attendance, and daily greetings with such perfect devotion that even the learned often fell short. When his father died, he slept on the ground, abstained from salt and dairy, and mourned to the point of near self-destruction. For three years, his grief remained unwavering. Those who secretly insult their parents—do they not feel shame before such examples?\n\nOnly by daring no hidden disrespect did the Cao and Wang families flourish so remarkably. Guo Cong was honored by imperial decree, his gate and lane adorned with banners of commendation; Meng Xi, while digging the earth, discovered gold beneath his hoe and thus became a wealthy household. Does Heaven ever fail to reward loyalty and filial piety? In truth, it never errs.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nReverence spares no disrespect,\nDeceit bears no true weight.\nIn serving father, in serving lord,\nNo reverence surpasses this.\nTo withhold one’s heart\nIs but deceit.\nAs face and form belong to man,\nSo too the role of minister and child.\nThough one claim ignorance,\nThe gods and spirits make it plain.\n\n*The Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Stimulus and Response concludes here.*\n\n*The Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Stimulus and Response begins.*\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\n*On Teachers*\nA teacher is one who transmits the Dao, imparts knowledge, and resolves doubts. Even a single word of enlightenment, a single character passed down, originates from them—how could one dare treat them with disdain?\n\nIn former times, when Hu Yuandi served as a teacher, his disciples—such as Qian Zao, steadfast and profound; Sun Jue, pure and bright; Fan Chunren, upright and gentle; and Qian Gongfu, simple and honest—were all renowned scholars of their age. Yet in their teacher’s presence, they conducted themselves no differently than children and younger brothers attending their father and elder brothers, never once showing disrespect.\n\nWhen Sun Mingfu served as a teacher, his disciples—such as Shi Jie, broadly learned and versatile, and Zhang Dong, widely read and erudite—were among the most virtuous in Lu. Even those of great virtue, in their teacher’s presence, followed in step when ascending or descending, carried his staff and sandals when bowing, and maintained solemn reverence—never was disrespect heard of.\n\nTake, for instance, Peng Ruli, a Grand Master for Court Consultation, who in his youth studied under Ni Tianyin of Silu. When Peng later held the office of Protector of Trust, he welcomed Tianyin to his residence and treated him with the utmost reverence as a disciple. After Tianyin’s death, his mother remained unburied, and the following year, his wife also passed, leaving no son. Peng arranged the burials of all three, then married Tianyin’s daughter to Song Huan, a successful candidate in the same imperial examination. Minister Wang Cun, in his youth, studied under Chen Jun of Yingchuan. When Jun died without an heir, Wang appointed Jun’s brother’s son to an official post, ensuring Jun’s wife had someone to rely on. Such men never forgot their teachers even after death—how much less would they dare show disrespect while they lived?\n\nThose who do treat teachers with disdain are but frivolous and petty men. They fail to recognize that teachers possess profound qualities not to be slighted. Their guidance may yet enlighten, their hidden virtues may be immense, and their descendants may flourish in ways yet unseen. The deeds of the Wang family serve as proof.\n\nLong ago, there was a teacher named Wang, whose family was exceedingly poor, and he made his living by instructing village children. In his old age, he had a son at eight years old but could not afford to raise him, so he entrusted the boy to a monk at the Western Temple. The monk, upon seeing the child, recognized his exceptional nature and immediately allowed him to partake in offerings, sparing no expense in supporting him. During the Xianping era, the boy was recommended as a worthy and upright candidate, later rising to the rank of Participant in Determining Governmental Matters, then Military Affairs Commissioner. His name and position were illustrious, his official achievements surpassing others—this was Wang Wenkang. Xu was his given name. Wenkang’s son, Yirou, advanced to the rank of Dragon Diagram Academician. Yirou’s sons, Jinxing and Jinyan, both attained the rank of Grand Master, known for their virtue, and often associated with scholars like Kangjie. How, then, could one dare treat teachers with disdain?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFather gives life, teacher imparts teaching,\nBoth are spoken of as one.\nTransmitting the Dao, imparting knowledge—\nWhich is the root, which the source?\nIn mourning garb, the heart mourns three years.\nThis is the weight of human relations,\nAnd the Way of Heaven as well.\nTo disdain what one should revere—\nNo evil surpasses this.\nTo betray what one serves.\n\n*On Betrayal*\nSubordinates to their superiors, soldiers to their commanders, servants and concubines to their masters—all serve. Betrayal need not be outright defiance; even in times of urgency, failing to rely on them, or in matters of profit and harm, showing no concern—this is betrayal. Let me speak of a few servants and soldiers, that those above them may feel some shame.\n\nLong ago, a servant named Zhao Yansi served Wang Linji as a retainer. Linji, who held the office of Drafter of Imperial Decrees, died within a year along with his son, leaving his family impoverished and unable to support themselves. Yansi, bound by righteousness, refused to leave. He exhausted his strength to raise Linji’s three daughters for over a decade, never once seeing their faces. When the girls came of age, he journeyed to the capital to seek out Linji’s former colleagues, Academician Bai and Vice Director Yang Huizhi, weeping loudly as he recounted his story. The two officials, astonished, said, “What you have done surpasses us.” They pooled their resources to bring the three daughters to the capital, arranged good marriages for them, and found them reputable husbands. At the time, Master Shi Shoudao of Culai wrote an account of this to shame those who lacked steadfastness in righteousness.\n\nWang Kui initially served as a servant to Luntian Langzhong Li Tan, then enlisted as a soldier and was selected for the Bangri Army. When Tan and his son were implicated in a case and imprisoned in the Censorate, none of their former relatives or friends dared visit or send provisions. Only Kui stood guard at the prison gate daily, supplying them with food and drink for over forty days without the slightest negligence. When the case was concluded, Tan was exiled to Nannen Prefecture. As the entourage prepared to depart, all others took their leave, but Kui alone accompanied them. Tan, suddenly overcome with grief and indignation, took his own life. Kui arranged his funeral and mourned him as if he were his own father and son, moving all who witnessed it to tears. Only after all matters were settled did he dare depart. At the time, Minister Sima Wengong also wrote an account of this to admonish those who treat righteousness lightly.\n\nHow, then, can those who receive kindness from others, yet abandon them at the first sign of profit or harm, compare even to servants like Zhao Yansi and Wang Kui?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nRulers, teachers, elders, and superiors—\nThose who receive their grace...\n\nAll speak of their duties—\nEach role bears its proper reverence.\nBonds of affection and righteousness endure,\nPassed down to children and grandchildren.\nServants repay their masters,\nAs dogs and horses remain loyal to their halls.\nI recall Ying of old,\nWhose deeds live on in the Nine Springs.\nYet how deceitful are those without discernment!\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: \"Delusion and ignorance mislead sentient beings, and after death, they shall fall into the Avīci Hell.\" If this is so, how can the sin of deception be considered light?\n\nLong ago, at the Taiqing Palace in Bozhou, there lived a Daoist priest of striking appearance. He would carry a small furnace to the hall of Lord Lao, where he forged and sold medicines. Whenever a crowd gathered, he would point at the statue of Lord Lao and declare loudly, \"I am his master!\" Many were deceived, all eager to obtain his medicines. One day, as he again pointed at the statue and boasted, fire suddenly leapt from the furnace and engulfed him. In an instant, flames consumed his body. Though the crowd poured water upon him, the fire could not be quenched. He shrieked and writhed in agony, until at last, facing the statue of Lord Lao, he prostrated himself as if begging forgiveness. When they looked again, he was already dead. Yang Kedong later confirmed this account with the coroner.\n\nThere was also Zhang Huaisu, a man of imposing presence. He claimed mastery of Daoist arts, able to summon spirits and command flight. He boasted that when Confucius executed Shaozheng Mao, he had been present to advise against haste. He further claimed to have witnessed the Battle of Chenggao between Han and Chu from a mountaintop. Even the treacherous Cai Bian was deceived, praising him extravagantly in conversation. Only the loyal and upright Chen Guan refused to believe him. Later, when Zhang’s schemes unraveled and he was punished, many scholars were implicated—only Chen Guan escaped the web of false accusations.\n\nCan those who deceive the ignorant ever escape disaster in the end?\n\nDeceivers, in general, know only greed and fear no sin. As monks, they wield empty talk to deceive; as alchemists, they use elixirs to deceive; as spirit-mediums, they invoke gods and ghosts to deceive; as physicians or diviners, they exploit their arts to deceive. How can they not know that deception brings not only worldly ruin but also condemnation to the great hells?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nLaughter cuts deeper than rage, resolve strikes harder than war.\nTo mock, deceive, and delude—is this not against human nature?\nFish in the depths may leap, birds on the foam startle at shadows.\nHow much more so for us, of the same kind, the most enlightened of beings?\nTo treat deception as skill is to cover one’s ears while stealing a bell.\nSlandering fellow students—\n\nThe *Records* say: Among the five human relationships are ruler and minister, father and son, elder and younger brothers, husband and wife, and friends—one of these five. If this is so, can the Way of friendship be taken lightly? How much more for fellow students, who daily share the same desk and mat, exchanging kind words and laughter in close companionship—can one rashly harbor jealousy and spread slander?\n\nLong ago, when Minister Guo Zhi first composed his rhapsodies and gained fame, his classmate Li Mian deeply envied his talent and secretly slandered him. As a result, Guo repeatedly failed the imperial examinations, while Li later passed first. When Guo was later appointed examiner, Li—having only qualified through the lesser *mingjing* degree—was among the candidates. On the day the edict was announced, Li deeply regretted his past actions and returned home. Upon hearing this, Guo immediately sent a trusted friend to summon him back, allowing him to retake the examination and pass. Yet could Guo’s excellence ever truly be suppressed? Now, looking back, does Li feel no shame? It is lamentable that he did not understand how elders and classmates should treat one another with kindness.\n\nIn another case, Han Yi and Li Ruogu studied together in their youth and once traveled the same road to take the examinations, sharing a single quilt and felt mat. Whenever they went out, they took turns serving as each other’s attendants. That year, Li passed first and was appointed registrar of Changshe in Xuzhou. As he prepared to take office, Li personally led the mule for his wife, while Han followed behind, carrying a basket. When they reached the border, only eight hundred coins remained, which they divided equally before parting in tears. The next year, Han also passed, and both later rose to the rank of vice-minister. Their families intermarried, and they never slandered one another—did they?\n\nThen there was Zhao Anren, who in his youth studied with Song Yuanxing. After Yuanxing died young, his descendants fell into decline. Once Zhao attained high office, he repeatedly used his salary to aid them and personally tutored their sons, hand-copying the *Book of Changes*, the *Analects*, the *Daodejing*, and the *Classic of Filial Piety*—seven texts in all, bestowing one upon each child. This is how one does not forget a classmate even after death. Those who lack loyalty and kindness—how could they ever match this?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nFair-weather friendships crumble at the first sign of misfortune. Sun Quan’s envy of Pang Tong led to his downfall; Sun Bin’s rivalry with Pang Juan cost him his legs. Yet when friends observe and emulate one another’s virtues, the Dao flourishes and transformation ripens. Even if one’s talent is lacking, like stone that polishes jade, with the right companionship, one attains high office and a hundred blessings.\n\nBut falsehood, slander, deceit, and pretense—these are the four poisons. As the saying goes: *Falsehood* is reckless and groundless; *slander* is baseless defamation; *deceit* is a web of cunning schemes; *pretense* is exaggerated artifice. Though distinct in name, they share the same root: dishonesty.\n\nBroadly speaking, sincerity is the Way of Heaven; cultivating sincerity is the Way of Man. Yet now, abandoning sincerity to practice falsehood, slander, deceit, and pretense is to rebel against Heaven’s Way and forsake the human path. Having defied both, where can one escape the Three Evil Realms?\n\nThus Master Yaoshan said: \"To recognize the path of hungry ghosts, look to those today who are full of emptiness and short on substance, who make others distrust them.\" Again he said: \"Do you wish to know the path of hell? It is those now boiling in cauldrons of scalding oil. Do you wish to know the path of hungry ghosts? It is those now full of emptiness and short on substance, who make others distrust them. Do you wish to know the path of beasts? It is those now who recognize neither benevolence nor duty, who cannot distinguish kin from stranger. Must they grow fur and horns, or be hacked and hung upside down? Do you wish to know the paths of humans and gods? It is those now who purify their bearing and hold offerings with reverence.\"\n\nOf the four poisons, \"full of emptiness and short on substance\" is but one. Yet even this alone leads to such swift descent—how much worse when all four are committed? The consequences of such a fall need not be discussed. Let us instead speak of one or two sincere men, that all may learn self-restraint.\n\nLong ago, Li Ji served as a regional inspector. When his term ended, he was summoned for an audience. Emperor Shenzong asked, \"What is the price of wheat?\" Li replied, \"In my duties, I have been impartial in all matters—only the price of wheat, I do not know.\" Later, when a vacancy arose for a circuit inspector, the chief ministers repeatedly recommended candidates, but none met the emperor’s approval. One day, the emperor himself remarked, \"Who was it who did not know the price of wheat?\" The chief ministers asked why. The emperor said, \"I wish to understand the conditions of the realm, so I need men of loyalty, sincerity, and integrity. If one does not even know the price of wheat, what else could he fabricate?\" Thereupon Li Ji was summoned and gained the emperor’s trust.\n\nA certain Wang the Recluse was originally a sturdy foot soldier of the Imperial City Bureau. At the time, the Yellow River had burst its banks in a great flood, and laborers were everywhere engaged in building dikes to contain it. The emperor dispatched several sturdy foot soldiers to travel back and forth as scouts. Two groups had already arrived and reported, \"The breach has been sealed, and the waters have returned to their original course.\" Shortly thereafter, Wang arrived and gave the same report. Then he added, \"When I first set out, I sensed that the flow at the ford had not yet been fully cut off—I fear this may still trouble Your Majesty’s thoughts.\" The emperor, enraged, had him detained. Soon after, a report arrived: the waters had surged with violent force, breaching the great dike once more and flooding several commanderies.\n\nThereupon the emperor summoned Wang, offered him comfort and praise, and immediately promoted him to the rank of junior officer. From then on, whenever appointments to the officer ranks were made, he often received exceptional promotions. When the Eastern Palace sought to select a personal guard commander, Liu Qian had already been chosen, but one position remained vacant. The emperor said, \"Wang the Recluse is honest and trustworthy—he shall be appointed at once.\" Later, he rose to the position of Commander of the Palace Infantry Guard, Military Commissioner of Baoning, and was granted the privilege of hereditary office, benefiting seventeen of his descendants in all.\n\nThus, the integrity of these two gentlemen—how could it not surpass the hollow deceit of falsehood, which swiftly leads one into evil destinies?\n\nIn praise, it is said:\n\nWithout sincerity, nothing exists—this is called emptiness.\nWords once spoken cannot be retracted, for their substance is false.\nDeceit usurps truth; fraud verges on folly.\nWho would partake of what remains when one conducts oneself thus?\nEven flesh and blood become estranged—how much more so the capital and the state?\nTo assail and expose one’s kin—\n\nAs the *Record* states: The *Book of Rites* says, \"Cherish your kin, and your uncles and brothers will harbor no resentment.\" What is meant by \"cherishing one’s kin\"? It is that each should cherish their own kin. Once one is counted among the clan and shares common ancestors above, how can they not cherish one another? Looking to those who came before, none expressed this more aptly than Master Fan Wenzheng.\n\nFan Wenzheng said: \"Many of my clan dwell in Wu. To me, there are degrees of closeness, but in the eyes of our ancestors, all are equally their descendants, without distinction. Moreover, for over a hundred years, our ancestors accumulated virtue, and it is only in my generation that it has borne fruit. Now that I hold high office, if I were to enjoy wealth and honor alone without the slightest care for my kin, how could I face my ancestors in the underworld? What face would I have to enter the ancestral temple?\" Thus, he ensured that all favors, salaries, and gifts were distributed equally among his kin. Furthermore, he purchased forty *qing* of fertile land near the outskirts of Suzhou to establish a charitable estate, providing for the poor among his extended family. He selected one virtuous elder to oversee its administration, giving each person a daily ration of one *sheng* of rice and an annual allotment of one bolt of silk. For weddings, funerals, and other needs, he provided additional support. His son, Chunren, was especially able to carry on his father’s aspirations. He maintained frugality and integrity, using his entire salary to expand the charitable estate. When granted the privilege of hereditary office, he always prioritized distant relatives. On the day of his death, five of his grandsons had yet to receive official appointments.\n\nSuch were these father and son—they truly embodied the principle of cherishing one’s kin. Others, too, exemplified this virtue: Minister Peng Siyong showed great kindness in nurturing his clan; Duke Zhang Kangjie often shared his salary with his nine generations of kin; Zhao Fuyou Shikai donated gold to relieve the uncountable poor among his relatives; and Gong’an, my revered ancestor, took in orphaned and widowed members of the clan, arranging marriages for them. These, too, were those who cherished their kin. If one can truly cherish their kin, how could they ever commit the error of mutual assault?\n\nWhat is meant by \"mutual assault\"? It is the insistence on contention over every \"you\" and \"me,\" the nitpicking over every thread and hair, the harboring of resentment and jealousy, the scheming to undermine and seize from one another—all of this is it. One need not wait for some great transgression to call it \"mutual assault.\" Beware!\n\nIn praise, it is said:\nAttack what is wrong in oneself,\nbut treat others with forbearance.\nTo mistake assault for uprightness\nis what the sages abhor.\nTo be thick with outsiders\nyet thin with those close—\nthis is truly shameful and fearful.\nIf even the roots of kinship,\nthose one sees daily,\nare treated like strangers on the road,\nand no effort is made to foster harmony,\nthen the constant norms of human relations are undermined.\n\n**Hymn to the Heavenly Master of Emptiness and Stillness**\nThe nature of man\nis profound, perfect, and quiescent.\nWhen it engages the world and responds to movement,\nall becomes delusion.\nA single thought straying from rectitude\nis already hell.\nTo reverently recite these words\nis to break out in a sweat of realization.\nThe embers of the heart’s fire are banked,\nthe qi-steed is tamed.\nHaving thus examined oneself,\none also warns those who come after.\n\n*This concludes the seventh scroll of the* Supreme Scripture on Responses and Retributions.\n*Here begins the eighth scroll of the* Supreme Scripture on Responses and Retributions.\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nStrength without benevolence.\nThe *Transmission* says: Confucius regarded strength as akin to benevolence, while the Most High deemed strength devoid of benevolence. How could the words of the sages contradict one another? The strength Confucius commended was resolute fortitude—unyielding within, the strength of a noble man, who would even sacrifice himself to fulfill benevolence, hence \"akin to benevolence.\" It is also said: \"The root, if it desires, how could it not be strong?\"\n\nThe strength the Most High cautioned against was brute force—wrath ever manifest without, the strength of a petty man, who bullies others and tramples all things. How could this be benevolence? Thus, it is called \"without benevolence.\" It is also said: \"The violent do not meet a natural death.\" And again: \"The rigid and unyielding are companions of death.\" Generally, brute force, if one cannot restrain oneself, readily leads to the fault of lacking benevolence. This is why the Most High declared it in writing: \"without benevolence.\"\n\nIn former times, Huan Fan, bearing the imperial tally, oversaw the military affairs of Qing and Xu provinces. Upon first arriving in Xuzhou, he quarreled with the prefectural governor, Xu Qi, over a residence and sought to invoke his authority to execute Qi. Qi reported this to the court, and Fan, having no just cause, was dismissed from office. Later, when he governed Jizhou, Lü Zhaocai served as General of the Northern Garrison, and Jizhou fell under his command. Fan, considering that Zhaocai had risen in office after him, held him in contempt and said to his wife: \"I would rather kneel before the Three Dukes than bow to Lü Zizhan.\" His wife replied: \"In Xuzhou, you sought to invoke your authority to execute Qi. Everyone said you would be difficult to serve under. Now in Jizhou, you refuse to bow to Lü Zizhan. People will say you are difficult to serve above.\" Enraged by her words, Fan struck her abdomen with a sword hilt, causing her to miscarry and die. Such violence—was this not lacking in benevolence?\n\nBao Xiaosu was inwardly resolute and unyielding. When his subordinates presented matters to him, he often rebuked them to their faces. Yet if their words accorded with reason, he would cheerfully amend his ways. Thus, all admired his strength without finding him obstinate. This was resolute fortitude, distinct from brute force. Hence, the differing views of the Most High and Confucius.\n\nI have often reflected: even if one avoids brute force, excessive reliance on strength still risks error. Yang Wengong Yi, unmatched in literary prowess, was deeply favored by the emperor, yet his unyielding nature alienated others. Though many spoke in his favor, the emperor’s regard waned. Wang Neihan Yuchen, also unmatched in literary skill, was considered for high office, but his unyielding nature provoked opposition, and the imperial decree never came. Thus, unchecked strength—does it not bring harm to oneself? If even these two gentlemen met such ends, what of others?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nStrength that does not overcome strength,\nviolent and without kinship.\nStrength that does not strengthen the self\nmust lord over others.\nThis is called a baleful virtue—\nhow could it be benevolence?\nGood thoughts thus severed,\nwhat evil would not follow?\nSeek your manifold blessings,\nfor a withered tree knows no spring.\n\n**Obstinate and Self-Willed**\nThe *Transmission* says: Obstinate and self-willed—according to the Buddha’s analogy, like a vicious horse, difficult to tame. If one is as untamable as a horse, should one not be counted among the lowest of men? Thus, in the *Dharma Wheel Sutra*, the Most High praised those who do not cling to their own ways and exhorted others to follow. Here, in this text, he again warns against obstinacy and self-will. Our Master Confucius also said: \"The foolish who delight in their own ways, the lowly who delight in their own authority—such men bring disaster upon themselves.\" The sages of the Three Teachings all spoke thus—how could one not take heed?\n\nGenerally, the obstinate and self-willed distance themselves from friends and acquaintances, and take no pleasure in the discourse of life and the Dao. In daily conduct, they are perverse and unyielding—how could they avoid error? It is lamentable that they do not flow with goodness as water flows downward.\n\nWhat the noble man practices, how could one cling to one’s own ways—let alone be obstinate? Formerly, Lord Li Wenzheng Fang often said: \"At the end of the Xiande reign, I served as Hanlin Academician. When my mother, the Great Lady Ding, passed away, I resumed my duties after the mourning period. At the time, the Vice Minister of Rites, Dou Yan, admonished me: 'The fish-shaped tally, signifying diligent service to the ruler day and night, is adorned with gold—an ornament of the body. You, having been compelled by imperial decree to curtail your mourning, should not wear gold or jade.' I immediately acknowledged my oversight. From then on, I resolved: 'As a son, though mourning rites are not prearranged, if one fails to observe the three-year mourning with propriety, not only does one fall short of the norms of proper conduct, but how could one face one’s peers among the gentry?' Through this, I came to recognize Dou’s words as those of a true elder.\"\n\nMaster Zhengshu, passing through Fan Yaofu’s administrative post, said to Yaofu: \"I heard that when the former commander died, you, having succeeded him only days before, held a banquet with music to entertain and reward the officers. Is this true?\" Yaofu replied: \"It is.\" The master said: \"At first, you should have dispersed the gathering, making them understand that the lack of provisions was due to the former commander’s death.\" Yaofu’s face flushed with heat, and sweat drenched him as shame welled within. The next day, he escorted the master to the border, saying: \"Had you not traveled far, I would not have heard such wise words.\"\n\nThese two gentlemen, when faced with matters, followed goodness thus. Is it any wonder their names resounded in their time and their blessings flowed to their descendants? Could the obstinate and self-willed ever hope for the same?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\n\"Zhong Hui possessed the proper way—self-reliance makes one small.\nGoodness is hard to change; madness cannot be corrected.\nA stingy heart seals itself off, private brows fret in turmoil.\nObstinate in rejecting counsel, domineering toward others,\nevil accumulates until disaster’s omen appears.\nCalamity befalls one’s person—it is self-summoned.\nRight and wrong are not properly judged.\n\nAs the tradition says: Zhuangzi said, *'That is one right and wrong, this is another right and wrong—is there truly a that-and-this? Or is there truly no that-and-this?'* This is to view right and wrong from beyond right and wrong, where they seem as if they do not exist. Yet if one still engages with the world, one cannot avoid matters of right and wrong. Each right and each wrong is weighed by gain and harm. In one state, one weighs the state’s gain and harm; in one household, one weighs the household’s gain and harm. Who would say otherwise?\n\nThus Xunzi said: *'To affirm right and negate wrong is called wisdom; to negate right and affirm wrong is called folly.'* Folly means disregarding gain and harm, recklessly affirming wrong and negating right. To ruin another’s affairs—is this not folly? How lamentable that one does not know to keep the mind balanced and upright, daring not recklessly affirm wrong and negate right, and thus each day should transcend the world.\n\nHave you not heard of Yin Zou’s affair? Long ago, Yin Shiru debated right and wrong with others, concealing nothing, neither stopping out of convenience nor following blindly, but only striving to exhaust principle to the fullest. On the day of his death, he first wrote a letter by hand to bid Wen Zheng farewell. When Wen Zheng rushed to him, the master had already bathed, dressed in his robes and cap, and sat upright in passing. Wen Zheng wept bitterly for him, but he opened his eyes and said: *'I have already bid you farewell—why come again? Life and death are common principles—does Xiwen not understand?'* With these words, he bowed once more and passed away. Had he not, in daily life, affirmed right and negated wrong without concealment, could he have faced death’s lord with such composure?\n\nZou Su served as *Chongban* of the Inner Palace, upright and unwavering, affirming right and negating wrong without reckless utterance. He never acted against righteousness, nor was he greedy or cruel, nor did he indulge in taking lives. In the end, he was received by the Perfected Warrior Lord and appointed to his retinue.\"\n\nIn the early years of the Qingli era, he was appointed as the wine inspector of Zhengzhou. One day, a sudden storm of wind and hail arose, and a copper coffin without a lid descended. The master immediately straightened his robe and cap, entered, and lay within it. In an instant, a lid descended and sealed the coffin. With a thunderous crash, the coffin rose into midair and drifted slowly northward. Today, he serves as the Judge of the Northern Dipper’s Lifespan Bureau, accompanying the Perfected Warrior Lord in his annual descent to assess the good and evil deeds of mortals, measuring the length of their allotted lifespans. Had he not, in daily life, affirmed right and negated wrong without reckless utterance, would the Perfected Warrior Lord have entrusted him with such a weighty office? These two gentlemen, in their transcendence, achieved such an end—what fate, then, awaits those who fail to discern right from wrong?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWho slanders, who praises—such was the upright Way of the Three Dynasties.\nThe impartiality of right and wrong is as clear as black and white.\nYet petty minds, once deluded, invert praise and blame,\nConfusing the upright with the wicked, the virtuous with the thieving.\nHeaven’s judgment is never misled; the sun shines bright and clear.\nTo turn toward or away—this is where propriety is breached.\n\n**Commentary:**\n\"Turning toward\" means aligning with what is proper; \"turning away\" means opposing it. To turn away when one should turn toward, or turn toward when one should turn away—this is what the Most High calls \"breaching propriety.\" The gentleman refrains from such acts, but the petty man commits them without scruple.\n\nIn former times, Minister Wang Zun maintained fair and impartial judgments, never swaying toward or against any side. His resolve was steadfast and unshakable. As Master Wen once praised him: *\"Amidst ten thousand galloping horses, only Wang Zun could stand firm.\"* Thus, from his youth to old age, serving five reigns with unwavering devotion, he held fast to one principle through all changes and upheavals.\n\nWhen Minister Liu Zhisu enumerated the ten harms of the corvée assistance policy, those in power demanded an account of his stance. Summoned to the Ministry of Revenue, he was ordered to explain himself. He replied: *\"What I turn toward is loyalty and uprightness; what I turn away from is deceit and flattery. What I turn toward is righteousness; what I turn away from is self-interest. What I turn toward is the sovereign and the father; what I turn away from is the powerful and the corrupt. If governance follows this path, punishment is my due. Yet the corvée remains a scourge upon the realm—I beg Your Majesty not to forget my words.\"* Though others recoiled in fear, he stood unmoved. Could such men as these have breached propriety in their turning toward or away?\n\nYet others, like Li Shizhong and Wu Xiaozong, acted otherwise. Li Shizhong’s views had long clashed with those of Duke Jing. When the duke’s power grew, Li sought to curry favor, erecting a pavilion in Shuzhou named *Chuanyan*, alluding to the duke’s past tenure there and his enfeoffment in Shu. Wu Xiaozong, in his initial policy response, vehemently opposed the Xining reforms. But when Duke Jing gained the emperor’s favor, Wu composed *Ten Chapters of Alleyway Discourse*, claiming that even common folk praised the new laws. The duke scorned him. Such breaches of propriety—were these the acts of a gentleman or a petty man?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo act with propriety is called righteousness.\nTo perceive truth clearly, to hold fast without wavering—\nOnce the path of compliance or defiance is chosen,\nFortune and misfortune diverge sharply.\nDo not distance yourself from the wise and virtuous,\nNor draw near to the deceitful and false.\nOnly by following the human Way\nDoes one align with Heaven’s will.\n\n**Oppressing the Lowly to Seize Merit**\n\n**Commentary:**\nA candle in darkness dispels shadows; a boat on water bears its load.\nWhen conditions are ripe, merit arises naturally—\nIt need not be seized.\nTo insist on seizing it is to oppress those below.\nMerit may never be achieved, but calamity will surely strike first.\nThis is what is meant by \"oppressing to seize wealth\" or \"oppressing to exploit labor\"—both are acts of oppression.\n\nConsider the seizure of wealth. Wealth is what all people urgently need. Have you not heard of the cases of Wang Zi and Ma Jiang?\n\nWang Zi, known for his harshness in office, served as an assistant in the Sichuan Transport Bureau during the Shaoxing era. When ordered to inspect the salt wells of Tongchuan, he personally visited each well, compelling the well owners to acknowledge inflated quotas. Those who owed fifty catties were forced to pledge a hundred, ensuring their assets would be confiscated and the salt boiled by the state. Soon after, the well owners were ruined, and Wang died suddenly, reborn as an ox. On the night of his death, his friend Prefect Yang and his household saw Wang come seeking help—his official robe already split by a tail emerging from beneath. The next day, a neighbor’s cow gave birth.\n\nThen there was Ma Jiang, another assistant official, even more ruthless. Whenever he went to collect taxes, he demanded exorbitant sums, heedless of actual quotas or market conditions. If his demands were not met, he would fly into a rage, earning the nickname *Ma the Scraper*—for his habit of scraping money clean. Someone warned him of Wang Zi’s fate, saying, *\"Even if you grew two tails today, you wouldn’t care.\"* Soon after, boils erupted on his left back, then his right, the two sores facing each other like a beaten spine, over an inch deep, exposing his organs. His colleagues visited in shock. Only then did he confess: *\"Let those who scrape money in the future take me as a warning.\"* His flesh wasted away, and only then did he draw his last breath.\n\nOthers, too, met grim fates: Li Zi died childless, Chen Shu’s soldiers perished, Lin Te’s descendants met unnatural ends—all for oppressing those below.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe world has its \"stalwart officials,\"\nUnafraid of imperial decrees.\nThey carve away at the people’s strength\nTo fill their bribe sacks.\nOnce their coffers overflow,\nThey offer \"surplus\" to their superiors.\nHigh ranks are easily enjoyed,\nGrand mansions easily occupied.\nBut what becomes of them and their descendants in the end?\nFlattering the powerful to curry favor.\n\nThe *Tradition* states: The sovereign governs the statutes of life, death, sin, and fortune, and none oversee this more than Fengdu. Beneath the Northern Emperor of Fengdu, only the Heavenly Lord of Mystic Nourishment assists the Four Lords, the Six Heavenly Demons, and the minor officials of the Three Palaces of Heaven, Earth, and Water—none of whom reveal their names. Among their subordinates, as recorded in the *Declarations of the Perfected*, are all the loyal and upright of the world. Those above them include the Duke of Shaogong Shi, who became the Duke of Southern Brightness, and Wu Jizha, who became the Duke of Northern Brightness. Those of the next rank include Jia Yi, who served as the Forbidden Gentleman of the Western Brightness, and Zang Hong, who became the Northern Dipper Lord and Heavenly Gate Warden. Still others, like Ji Zhan, who became the Northern Heavenly Gate Keeper, and Wen Qiao, who became the Earl Overseer of the Sea, are also among them. Has there ever been one who curried favor with superiors that was counted among their ranks?\n\nGenerally, in serving a ruler, loyalty is paramount. A single word of flattery is enough to brand one as disloyal. The disloyal are inevitably condemned by Heaven—how can they hope for deliverance?\n\nIn the past, Emperor Gaozong of Tang sought to elevate Lady Wu as empress but hesitated, fearing the dissent of his ministers. One day, he summoned Li Ji, Changsun Wuji, Yu Zhining, and Chu Suiliang to deliberate. Suiliang and the others all opposed the idea, while Li Ji remained silent. Yu Zhining, too, glanced about and said nothing. Days later, the emperor secretly consulted Li Ji again. Had Ji spoken even a single word of remonstrance then, he would have remained loyal, and the Tang might have been spared the disaster that befell its imperial clan. But Ji did otherwise, replying instead that this was the emperor’s private affair, not to be questioned by outsiders. Thus, the emperor’s resolve was set, Lady Wu was enthroned, and the Tang’s imperial house was annihilated.\n\nIn Ji’s heart, he sought only to protect himself, fearing calamity. Yet he failed to see that the self cannot be truly shielded, nor can disaster be truly feared. Soon after his death, his entire clan was exterminated, his tomb desecrated—every misfortune befell him. Who can say that flattering superiors to curry favor brings no disaster?\n\nThere was also Guo Chongtao, who met the same fate. Having risen to high office and seeing his own merits as great, he grew restless and scheming. He petitioned the emperor to establish Empress Liu, intending to secure his own position. Little did he know that the hearts of others are hard to fathom and easily turned against one. In the end, it was Empress Liu who had him killed. Can such flattery of superiors be justified? Can it bring anything but ruin?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFlattering superiors, chasing favor,\nOpening the way to sin.\nSo-called \"pleasing the ruler\"—\nNo crime is greater.\nWhen the ruler’s mind is yet undecided,\nChange may still come.\nA single word of compliance,\nAnd their resolve hardens.\nRuined lives, fallen nations—\nBlame not Heaven.\nIngrates receive kindness yet feel no gratitude.\n\nThe *Tradition* further states: According to the *Dharma Treasury Forest of Gems*, receiving kindness is like sowing grain. Though the seed depends on the earth, without rain, it will not grow. When the grain ripens, one cannot credit only the earth and ignore the grace of rain. As the *Great Perfection of Wisdom Treatise* says, ingratitude is worse than being a beast.\n\nI once read a passage in Liu Zongyuan’s writings that further illustrates how ingratitude is a deed even beasts would not commit. To be human yet fall short of beasts—is that not worse than being a beast?\n\nAt Jianfu Temple, there was a hawk that perched atop the pagoda. One winter’s night, the temple’s bell-ringer caught a bird small enough to hold in his hand. Instead of killing it, he turned it gently in his palms to warm its claws. At dawn, he released it unharmed. After setting it free, he watched it intently as it flew—eastward when it vanished in the west, westward when it vanished in the east—seemingly unwilling to meet his gaze again, lest it be seized once more.\n\nAlas! Hawks are creatures that seize and tear their prey to eat. Yet this one, having had its claws warmed for a single night, acted thus. How can those who receive kindness yet feel no gratitude claim to be anything but worse than beasts?\n\nHow lamentable that those who do not know gratitude are farthest from the Dao. For it is not ingratitude, but gratitude, that brings one closer to the Dao. And if one is grateful, their daily conduct is plain to see.\n\nDuring the Xuanhe era, there was a scholar-official named Xu Wenzhong who once traveled to the Eastern Capital. One of his soldiers was accidentally run over by a cart and left lame, unable to walk. He encountered a Daoist who gave him a small dose of medicine, and soon the soldier walked as before.\n\nThe soldier was deeply moved and grateful. He traveled throughout the realm, seeking the Daoist to offer even a modest token of thanks. One day, he encountered him again on the road and wept as he bowed in gratitude. The Daoist said, \"I have bestowed kindness upon many, yet none have been like you.\" Thereupon, he transmitted a secret formula, and the soldier attained the Dao.\n\nWhen Xu Wenzhong heard of this, he visited the soldier to inquire about the Way. The soldier replied, \"Stillness is the Dao; simplicity is supreme.\" Wenzhong was suddenly enlightened, and he too attained the Dao.\n\nWho could claim that one who knows no gratitude may yet attain the Dao? How many in this world are like this soldier?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nIn this world, there are those more cruel than wolves and tigers.\nThey take shelter under another’s wings,\nYet repay with axes and blades.\nSuch men sever all human bonds,\nNeither lord nor father do they acknowledge.\nLike the man who shielded the Duke of Wei beneath the mulberry,\nOr the one who lacquered his body to feign madness—\nTo bear a debt and repay it is one thing,\nBut to cling to resentment without end is another.\nThe giver should not look back,\nYet the aggrieved nurse their grievances ceaselessly.\n\nThe *Record* states: Master Deshan addressed the assembly, saying, \"Even a single thought tied to the dharma becomes the cause of the Three Wretched Realms. A fleeting emotion gives rise to eons of bondage.\" If mere attachment to the dharma can still be such a burden, how much worse is the mind that harbors resentment without cease?\n\nKnow this: the mind that clings to resentment binds itself most tightly, never to be freed, plunging swiftly into the Three Wretched Realms as if shot by an arrow, never hearing the teachings of repentance. Does this not confirm the saying, \"Without enmity, there are no evil destinies\"?\n\nAccording to the sutras: \"When hatred and resentment arise from mutual animosity, at the moment of death—before the body’s warmth has faded—stones will fly, cangues will lock, and cages, jars, and sacks will appear before the dying, ready to crush and confine.\" This is the fate of those who cling to resentment without end: they are bound for hell.\n\nFurther, it is said: \"Greed and hatred are sins. When one’s punishment in hell is complete, they are reborn as venomous creatures, known as poisonous ghosts.\" This is the fate of those who cling to resentment: they fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.\n\nAgain, it is said: \"When the poison of such ghosts is exhausted, they are reborn in the world as venomous beings.\" This is the fate of those who cling to resentment: they fall into the realm of beasts.\n\nThe Buddha’s words are never false. Who could deny this?\n\nYet there are those who, having already fallen into the Three Evil Realms, still do not cease their resentment. Like the bandit of Jizhou, who, after dying for his crimes and falling into hell, still harbored hatred for Prefect Zhang Yi, who had executed him beyond the law. His resentment unceasing, he sought to drag Zhang Yi into hell. Or like the ghost recorded in the *Vibhāṣā Śāstra*, who, having died with accumulated sins and fallen into the realm of hungry ghosts, still resented a woman who had killed him five hundred lifetimes prior. His resentment unceasing, he ultimately took her life in return. Or like the mule in Yang Bao’s stable, which, having died for its evil karma and fallen into the realm of beasts, still harbored resentment toward Wang He, who had once wronged it. Its resentment unceasing, it returned to kill Wang He.\n\nThus, is not the character for \"resentment\" the very thing that binds a person most tightly, ensuring they never attain liberation?\n\nHave you not heard the words of the Thirty-First Ancestor, Great Master Can? The Thirty-Second Ancestor, Great Master Daoxin, once respectfully asked Can, \"I beg the Master’s compassion—grant me liberation.\" Can replied, \"Who binds you?\" Daoxin said, \"No one binds me.\" Can said, \"If no one binds you, why seek liberation?\" At these words, Daoxin awakened and was liberated.\n\nIf these words of Can were widely spread, then those who do not cease would cease, and those who are not liberated would be liberated.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nBoyi and Shuqi bore no grudges,\nTheir hearts set on seeking benevolence.\nWhen others failed to return courtesy,\nMencius turned inward to reflect.\nWith empathy and principle, all things flourish in spring.\nYet Xi Ke remembered a slight,\nAnd bones lay strewn between neighboring states.\nA single thought of resentment\nIs the root of ten thousand evils.\n\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Eight—Concluded\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Nine\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nTo treat the people of Heaven with contempt—\nSuch are the harsh and rigid, who bring calamity upon themselves in an instant, and thus merit no further mention.\n\nLet me speak of one or two benevolent officials who loved the people, that all may know and emulate their example.\n\nLong ago, Lord Han Zhongxian, Qi, first served as Pacification Commissioner of the Yili Circuit. In relieving the starving, he saved over 1.9 million lives. Later, when he governed Hebei, the Yellow River burst its banks, and famine struck again. Lord Han once more devised many measures to provide relief and restore order, saving over 7 million lives.\n\nLord Fu Wenzhong, Gou, governed Qingzhou. When the river flooded, the people of eight prefectures fled entirely into the eastern capital region. Lord Fu urged the people to donate grain, amassing over 100,000 *hu*, which he stored in various locations to succor the starving. He also requisitioned over 100,000 vacant public and private dwellings, dispersing the refugees among them to ensure access to firewood and water. The following year, when the wheat ripened, he calculated the distance each household had traveled and provided them with grain for their return, saving over 500,000 lives.\n\nTeng Zhangmin, Yuanfa, served as Prefect of Yunzhou. When famine struck Huainan and the eastern capital region, he repaired over 1,200 abandoned barracks outside the city to house refugees, saving 50,000 lives.\n\nLi Yunze served as Prefect of Tanzhou. When famine struck, he requested to open the granaries for relief before submitting his memorial, but the Transport Commission refused. Li said, \"If we wait for approval before acting, how can we address the crisis in time?\" Thus, he pledged his family fortune as collateral to distribute grain, saving 50,000 lives.\n\nChen Dahui, Yaozuo, served as Prefect of Shouzhou. When famine struck, he declared, \"Rather than issue orders, it is better to lead by example.\" He then donated his own money to aid the poor. The people of the prefecture vied to contribute, and together they saved tens of thousands of lives.\n\nKing Yimin of Su served as Prefect of Taiyuan. When the Fen and Yellow Rivers overflowed, flooding Pingjin and threatening the prefectural city, he swiftly prepared boats. The next day, when the waters arrived, the people were spared from panic. He also urged the great families to distribute grain for relief, saving one hundred thousand lives.\n\nHu Wengong of Su had once served as Magistrate of Yangzi. When a great flood struck and many people were swept away, he spent his own money to hire boats for rescue, reviving thousands who had already drowned.\n\nZeng Gong, the Grand Secretary, served as Prefect of Hongzhou during a great epidemic. From the prefectural seat to the counties, markets, towns, and post stations, he stored medicinal decoctions to await the sick. Soldiers and civilians without shelter were housed in official quarters, saving thousands of lives.\n\nSu Shi, the Cultured and Earnest, served as Prefect of Hangzhou during a great epidemic. He used his own funds to prepare medicinal decoctions, dispatching officials with physicians to administer treatment across the wards. He also established infirmaries to house the sick, saving thousands of lives.\n\nCould those who scorn such duties have acted thus? Yet if one does not know better while governing the people, one ought to act in this way.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nFather Heaven, Mother Earth—\nqi shared, bodies the same.\nThe eldest son, the steward of the house,\ndown to the hundred artisans.\nAll nurture one another,\naiding the work of transformation.\nHow could one indulge the high\nwhile crushing the people into hardship?\nNot the people’s ruin,\nbut the ruin of oneself—\ndisturbing and disordering the governance of the state.\n\nThe tradition says: Laozi said, \"Governing a state is like cooking a small fish.\"\nLu Xiangxian said, \"The world is fundamentally without trouble; mediocre men disturb it.\"\nGenerally, governance values acting without interference—\nhow much more so when governance is meant to rectify the people?\nOfficials have long followed this way,\nand the people have grown accustomed to its convenience.\nHow could one rashly alter it\nto follow one’s own ideas?\nIf one follows one’s own ideas,\nit may not benefit the people,\nbut only bring about one’s own disturbance.\nImpassioned, meddlesome words—\nhow could they all be trusted?\n\nLong ago, when Duke Qi of Du governed and pacified Guanzhong,\na commoner named Zhang Dong—\nbristling beard, dark face, clad in a black robe of coarse cloth—\npresented a poem in lieu of a calling card, saying:\n\"Last night, an urgent dispatch came from the clouds;\nwho among the generals can sweep away the dust?\nIn Chang’an there is a guest with a face like iron—\nreport to the lord and king: build the terrace early.\"\nLater, when he was granted an official post,\nhe was soon ruined by corruption.\n\nWhen Han Weigong governed the region west of Shaanxi,\na commoner named Yao Sizong submitted a memorial on governance,\nreciting a poem from Mount Kongtong:\n\"Trample the rocks of Helan,\nsweep clean the dust of the western Wei.\nIf a commoner can accomplish this,\nhow pitiful to remain a stranded fish.\"\nLater, when he was granted an official post,\nhe proved no better than a superfluous clerk.\n\nWhen Lord Lü of Xu served at court, a commoner named Lei Jianfu was summoned for an audience upon recommendation. His qi could have swallowed enemies whole. After several memorials, he proved meticulous and quick-witted. The court wished to employ him in high office, but Lord Xu firmly opposed it. Eventually promoted to the post of Third Bureau Judge, he was no different in character from Sizong.\n\nWhen Jiang Shaoyu governed Jizhou, a commoner named Li Jie submitted a memorial on governance, claiming to have studied the Dao of benevolence and righteousness from youth, second only to Yan Hui. He further declared that the Three Sovereigns were not sagely, that only Confucius was truly sagely, and that all thinkers from Mencius onward were unworthy of mention. When Han Zihua governed Chengdu, he too advanced this doctrine. Zihua was swayed by it, and when he later served alongside the Duke of Jing in the Third Bureau, he recommended Li Jie. Before the man could be appointed, he went mad and died.\n\nCan such impassioned, attention-seeking words be trusted? Thus, when Zhao, Han, and Wang served as chief ministers, they paid no heed to any submissions from ambitious newcomers offering proposals on matters of advantage and harm. When Ji, Jian, and Mu held the chancellorship, they systematically excluded all memorials and suggestions from those eager for reform, given to grandstanding, fond of stirring up trouble, or of shallow and untested character. In their time, both ministers were praised for conducting themselves appropriately in office. Had they been quick to trust, would they not have easily invited chaos?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\n\"Governance is rectitude; indulge in private interests, and it becomes biased.\nThe greedy perish for wealth, the vainglorious crave power.\nPrinciple yields to force, law bends to favor.\nRewards and punishments are misapplied, discipline and order cast aside.\nThis harms the state—how then can you yourself remain whole?\n\nTo reward what is not righteous—\nAs the saying goes, Han Yu said: 'To act as is fitting is called *yi* (righteousness).'\nGenerally speaking, *yi* means 'what is fitting.'\nTo reward what is not *yi* is to bestow where it is not fitting.\nWould a true gentleman ever do such a thing?\n\nDuring the Jingde era, northern raiders harassed the frontier, and the commanderies and counties of the Hebei circuit repeatedly suffered their depredations. The generals in command, seeking only their own safety, dared not even slightly blunt the enemy’s edge. At the time, Li Juzheng, a minor official, was pressing for tax collection in a garrison town. Enraged by the raiders’ brutality, he rallied the townspeople, recruited able-bodied men, and struck back with all his might. Pursuing them deep into their lair, he recovered the women and children they had seized and returned them to their families. Though those in power admired his courage, not one would recommend him for reward—only Zhang Yongding secretly memorialized the throne. When the memorial reached the emperor, he was overjoyed and immediately promoted Juzheng several ranks, summoning him to serve as Gentleman of the Palace Gate. Juzheng, unaware of the source of his favor, was later told of Yongding’s role. He hastened to visit him, but try as he might, he could not secure an audience. He then bribed the gatekeeper to deliver a calling card, yet Yongding still refused to appear, merely writing at the bottom of the card: 'In wealth, you were generous; in battle, brave; in affairs, diligent; toward the people, kind. Add to this your prudence and reverence—these are the great proofs of service to the state. To decline a private meeting is but a small matter.' Juzheng received this with greater joy than if he had met him in person. He cherished and carried it with him always. Juzheng’s reward may indeed be called righteous.\n\nShi Ji served as military commissioner of Yanzhou. During the Kangding era, Tangut raiders attacked Yongping Fort in Yanzhou. The fort commander and the supervising officer both wished to withdraw their troops into the deep mountains and wait for the raiders to leave before returning. Ji led several hundred of his men to block the city gate, halting before their horses, and demanded: 'Where do you intend to go, Commander and Supervisor?' The two answered truthfully. Ji said: 'If you do this, the troops will be preserved, but what of the people in the city? Where will they take their grain and fodder? How can you conceal your tracks? One day, the authorities will impeach you. As military commissioner, I would not escape execution—so let me be beheaded before your horses first. Otherwise, I will not lead these troops to follow you.' Ashamed and fearful, the two turned their reins and returned. Suddenly, the raiders surrounded the city, and Ji again led his men in defense. After several days, the raiders withdrew, and the fort commander and supervisor were both promoted for preserving the city. Were their rewards not unrighteous?\n\nAlas! Though Ji himself did not receive a reward, he later rose to the rank of brigade commander, all three of his sons were appointed to office, and one daughter married Guo Kui, becoming a commandery lady. This was far better than the two men’s unrighteous promotion by a single rank.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nTo gain high rank through unrighteousness—\nthis is a warning the Sage left us.\"\n\n\"To enfeoff the unrighteous as marquises—this was Emperor Guangwu’s failure of governance. To reward bandits is to encourage treachery; how then can the state enforce its decrees? When titles are bestowed upon the wicked and the virtueless, it is a profanation of Heaven’s Mandate. Thus did the Grand Steward instruct the king in the Eight Powers: punishment must reach the innocent.\n\nAs the tradition states: 'Punishment exists to chastise evil.' Yet when no evil exists and punishment is still meted out, this is what the Most High calls innocence. Whispers among men are heard in Heaven like thunder. If the innocent cry out to Heaven, will Heaven not hear?\n\nIn Caizhou there lived a man named Qian Ju, who falsely accused his younger brother of being of another surname and concealing over two hundred thousand in family wealth, refusing to divide it equally. The officials before and after all accepted Ju’s bribes and rendered unjust verdicts. Only the witness Zhu Xijie maintained a consistent account throughout, refusing to curry favor or submit. Later, when Xu Yi, the Vice Prefect of Xuzhou, was dispatched to Caizhou to establish a prison and investigate the case at its root, Yi again acted with recklessness. Manipulated by the interrogator Yang Zhonghe, he instead had Zhu Xijie sentenced to thirteen strokes of the heavy rod on the buttocks.\n\nFrom that time on, Yi’s every action was obstructed in review and went unapproved. Hearing that at the Tianqing Abbey there was a Daoist named Pei Junsou skilled in memorializing the throne, he prepared incense and offerings and went to the abbey to perform three successive jiao rites, praying for auspicious favor. At first, Junsou prostrated himself to submit the petition and immediately fell into a snoring slumber. The next day, he rose like a dragon and said:\n\n'I arrived at the Gate of Heaven and saw the Great Emperor of the North Pole leading the True Lord of the Hall of Blessing and Judgment of Good and Evil, the Perfected Warrior, to present a memorial. They stated: \"The Vice Prefect in Caizhou was wrong to unjustly sentence the witness Zhu Xijie to thirteen strokes of the heavy rod on the buttocks.\" Then, glaring fiercely, they commanded: \"Xu Yi’s petition is to be kept here. Should the Register of the Golden Script demand an accounting, your response must not err, or you will not be permitted to return.\" I then hastened back—such is the matter.'\"\n\nXu Yi said: \"So it was.\" With these words, his body drenched in sweat, he could not bear the grief and despair. Not long after, he indeed passed away.\n\nThere was also a scholar named Yang Zhiqi who went out at dawn to check the examination results. His wife, at home, had hired a mule to ride to the Water Gate to welcome her parents. Before long, on the road, she encountered a drunkard who, recognizing her, assaulted her. The muleteer fled in secret, and with no one to intervene, the matter was brought before the authorities. At that time, Wen Zhongshu was serving as the magistrate of Kaifeng. Seeing only the scratch marks on the drunkard’s face, he did not inquire into right or wrong but issued a uniform judgment. The woman, deeply ashamed, had gone several days without eating. Her husband, having failed the examination, returned from outside to find his wife beaten with the rod. Overcome with fury, he appealed to the prefectural court, but Zhongshu refused to listen. Thereupon, the couple drowned themselves together.\n\nThat very night, Zhongshu dreamed that the City God’s office reprimanded him: \"You were far too reckless, rashly sentencing innocent people. I have already reported this to the Eastern Peak, and upon memorial to the Supreme Emperor, disaster will soon befall you.\" The next day, the emperor learned of the matter, and Zhongshu and his subordinates were all dismissed from office. Yet what of the retribution from the netherworld that awaits him?\n\nIn praise, it is said:\n\nShould the offense be minor, pardon it; where guilt is doubtful, impose the lightest penalty. Such was the Sage’s intent: that punishment should aim to eliminate punishment itself. How much more then should the innocent be met with compassion? Yet when the prison gates swing open, the roots are torn up and the measuring lines drawn taut. With wrongful cages overflowing, can one not be sternly chastised?\n\nTo kill a man for his wealth—\nAs the saying goes: \"Bandits force their victims into peril; physicians exploit their patients’ vulnerability. Both kill for gain, and in this their crimes are one and the same.\"\n\nLet us speak of physicians, that the sick may not fall prey to poisonous hands.\nTo disregard urgency and demand exorbitant fees is to kill.\nTo insist on payment regardless of means is to kill.\nTo be lazy or drowsy, treating life with contempt, is to kill.\nTo diagnose carelessly and prescribe mistakenly is to kill.\nTo delay treatment until the illness worsens is to kill.\nThese five failings, when coupled with medical skill, make the physician’s killing more heinous than wielding a blade. Beneath the blade, if the strike misses vital points, life may yet be spared; but beneath the bowl, when the five organs are ruined, is there any hope of survival?\n\nLong ago, Yan Ji sought treatment for illness and lost his life. Later, he revived, his breath faint and indistinct, neither dead nor alive, for thirteen years. Chen Jingren’s wife, Zhang-shi, suffered a minor ailment; the physician mistakenly administered a blood-separating drug, and she did not rise again. After death, the underworld refused her, her soul adrift and scattered. Wherever she wandered, she was driven away by the local earth gods, enduring unbearable suffering. One day, as Jingren traveled beyond the city, he chanced upon her. Their essences merged, and from then on, Jingren grew disoriented, singing and muttering to himself. At that time, his father was serving in the capital when the imperial envoy Qin Zhongli passed through his post. Zhongli, a devotee of Zhenwu, reported the matter to the Northern Dipper. Moved by the unjust death, Zhenwu, the Perfected Lord, immediately granted rebirth without passing through the underworld. Who can say physicians do not kill?\n\nAlas, they know not that medicine is a craft where ascent and descent come swiftest. In a past life, the Venerable Bakkula offered a single harītakī fruit to a sick monk. By this merit, for ninety kalpas he was born in heaven and among men, never falling ill. In his final life, he met the Buddha, left the household, and attained arhatship, becoming the foremost among five hundred. Wang Sou made his living with acupuncture, never counting his fees, and his treatments were often effective. One day, he told the assembly: \"Next summer, I cannot remain.\" When the time came, he departed, and the place where he lived was filled with fragrance for months. Liu Jin also practiced medicine, tireless in his labor, and his cures were many. On the day of his burial, only an empty coffin was interred. These physicians, by applying their hearts with goodness, swiftly attained liberation from the world.\n\nIn our dynasty, Ding Fengji was skilled in medicine; his son Du and a second son both passed the imperial examinations, rising to the rank of Grand Scholar of the Hall of Literary Glory. Zhang Zhonghe applied the methods of Zhang Zhongjing to treat cold damage disorders. His two sons, Qi and Zhao, both succeeded in the examinations. Zhang Xingfu also practiced medicine; his descendants have governed great provinces and held high office for generations. These too are physicians who, by applying their hearts with goodness, ensured the flourishing of their posterity.\n\nThe Bodhisattva Sincere Appearance once visited a hell where a sinner endured molten iron poured over his body and iron nails driven into his flesh. Bowing, he asked what crime had led to this. The Buddha replied: \"In a past life, this man was an acupuncturist who recklessly applied needles, and thus he receives this retribution.\"\n\nThe Venerable Maudgalyāyana, leaving the city one morning, saw a hungry ghost weeping. It said: \"This body of mine is like a lump of flesh, without hands, feet, eyes, ears, or nose. Birds and insects have long fed upon it. What crime brought this upon me?\" Maudgalyāyana replied: \"In a past life, you practiced medicine without mastering your craft, recklessly administering drugs, causing patients to die. This is your retribution.\"\n\nThe divine nun Hui Pu of Caizhou was once sitting with guests when two oxen were led past the hall. The nun said: \"The ox leading the way was once an official who condemned an innocent man. The one following was a physician who killed in error.\" She called out their past-life names, and both oxen responded. These too are physicians who, by failing to apply their hearts with goodness, fell into the three evil destinies.\n\nAlas! The deeds of good and ill are fully recorded above. Whether to follow or defy them—you must choose for yourself.\n\nIn praise, it is said:\n\nThe treasury of grievance, the root of profit’s strife—\nhoarded yet never dispersed, still it brings ruin to men.\nTo slay for wealth, yet seek to preserve one’s life—\nhow many greedy clerks devour the rich and noble!\nConfiscation, death, exile—does Heaven doubt their guilt?\nTo topple others for rank and title.\n\nThe *Scripture* says: The Primordial August Lord declared: Consorts, empresses, and ministers, though bound to the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, hold rank only by attachment to the Five Peaks and Four Waterways. In general, every office and post bears its own *yiming* (rightful destiny). Where *yiming* is ordained, one may rise today to the Bureau of Military Affairs, tomorrow to the Grand Councillorship—nothing difficult in this. But where *yiming* is absent, not even a single day’s tenure may be secured. Who would say otherwise?\n\nLong ago, Su Yijian first served in the Hanlin Academy, while Li Hang entered later. Soon after, Li was appointed Vice Minister, and Su grew displeased. He presented ten *Steps of Emptiness* hymns to express his intent to the throne. That very day, he was made a Grand Councilor. Yet before many days had passed after his appointment, he died. Xiahou Jiazhen won favor for his literary skill and was named Right Remonstrator, Gentleman of the Historiography Institute, and concurrent member of the Secret Pavilion. Still unsatisfied, he said: “I delight in writing and love alchemy. If I could have but one silver coin from mercury-silver and one day as a Drafter of Edicts, it would suffice.” The emperor heard and granted his wish, but the edict had not yet been issued when he died. Li Jining, a man of talent and ability, served as Academician of the Bureau of Military Affairs. During an audience with Emperor Taizong, he was promised great advancement. Returning home, he told his brothers, overjoyed and drunk—then suddenly struck by vertigo, he died. Li Juyuan, acting Censor-in-Chief, was esteemed by Taizong, who once praised him to his face with intent to promote him. But by chance, while investigating a case, he was demoted to Prefect of Langzhou. One day, an urgent dispatch arrived at the post station, ordering him to return to the capital by post-horse. Juyuan opened the letter, overjoyed—then laughed and expired. Was this not a case of *yiming* being absent, where not even a single day’s tenure could be secured? How much less, then, for those who topple others to seize their positions?\n\nShould one topple another to seize their position, they cannot escape a chain of karmic consequence—as seen in the cases of Mi Dechao and Lu Duoxun, whose downfall swiftly followed their rise. Formerly, Dechao observed that Minister of Military Affairs Cao Bin enjoyed the highest esteem and favor from the emperor. He slandered Bin with accusations of sedition, sparing no effort to ruin him. Thus, Bin was dismissed from his post, and Dechao was appointed in his stead. Yet within days, Zhao Pu returned to power and vigorously cleared Bin’s name. The emperor, realizing his error, banished Dechao that very day, while restoring Bin to his former standing.\n\nLu Duoxun, seeing that Chancellor Zhao Pu held unmatched authority and prestige, incited Wang You to aid him in undermining Pu. When You refused, Duoxun devised his own scheme, implicating Pu in secret misdeeds. Thus, Pu was stripped of his chancellorship, and Duoxun took his place. But when the truth came to light, Zhao Pu was reinstated, and Duoxun was exiled to Zhuya. If this is the fate of those who seize office by toppling others, should the impatient and ambitious not take heed?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe work of governance is Heaven’s charge;\nPosition must match virtue’s weight.\nYet petty men, in shallow haste,\nForce fate and strive with all their might.\nThey mar the noble Way in vain,\nGaining naught for their virtue’s blight.\nLike mantises stalking cicadas,\nOr yellow sparrows flapping in flight—\nHeaven’s Way turns full circle,\nAnd all shall see my warning’s light:\nPunishment descends, bonds are severed.\n\n**It is said:**\nThe highest principle declares:\nWeapons are inauspicious tools,\nNot instruments for noble men.\nOnly when no choice remains are they employed.\nThose who delight in them delight in slaughter,\nAnd cannot prevail beneath Heaven’s dome.\nThus, in auspicious rites, the left is honored;\nIn ill omens, the right takes precedence.\nThe Deputy General stands to the left,\nThe Supreme Commander to the right.\nWhen the slain are many, mourn with tears of grief.\nEven in victory, observe the rites of mourning.\n\nMoreover, the weapons wielded are governed by stellar palaces:\nThe blade is called *Great Chamber*, ruled by the Void Star.\nThe sword is called *Loss and Wound*, ruled by the Horn Star.\nThe bow is called *Curved Tension*, ruled by the Root Star.\nThe arrow is called *Hesitant Wanderer*, ruled by the Sparkling Deluder.\nThe crossbow is called *Distant Gaze*, ruled by the Spread Star.\nWar is called *Great General*, ruled by the Triaster.\n\nIf these instruments may not be misused,\nHow can men delight in slaughter?\nHas no one heard of Wang Xian’s fate?\nWang Xian, as *Envoy-Chancellor*, governed Dingzhou...\n\nOne day, a Daoist priest appeared—his hat torn, his robe threadbare, his beard bristling like a boar’s tusks, his grin stretching from ear to ear. He announced himself as the abbot of Fengdu Temple and presented a calling card, saying: \"Yesterday, a decree arrived from the Celestial Court. Twenty thousand barbarian souls have been sent here, but this temple dares not yet enter them into the register of the dead. If you, sir, truly insist on slaughtering them, your name will resound through the ages, but you will forfeit ten years of your lifespan. Choose between the two.\" The general dismissed him as a madman and drove him away.\n\nShortly after, the Khitans led their troops to hunt at Liangmen. A sudden snowstorm rendered their bows useless. Recalling the thousands of bow and crossbow materials stored in his armory, Wang Xian ordered craftsmen to work through the night, shaping them into weapons. Seizing the enemy’s unpreparedness, he unleashed his troops, routing the Khitan forces. The next day, he erected a mound of the slain and counted exactly twenty thousand heads. Only then did he grasp the Daoist’s warning—too late to undo what was done.\n\nWhen the victory was reported to the court, the emperor rejoiced and summoned him to the Bureau of Military Affairs. Yet Wang Xian left Dingzhou only thirteen days later—and died. Alas! These were souls fated for death, yet even for them, his insistence on slaughter cost him his years. How much graver, then, the sin of executing those who have already surrendered and submitted?\n\nWhen Cai Juhou governed Yunzhou, five hundred bandits from Liangshan Marsh came to surrender. He had them all executed. The following year, while serving as Vice Minister of War on a ritual mission to Jinling, a carbuncle erupted on his back. He ordered Daoist priests to perform a grand offering to atone, instructing his confidant Wang Gong to compose the prayer on his behalf. The next day, Cai Juhou died; the day after, Wang Gong followed.\n\nLater, Wang Gong’s spirit returned, saying: \"When I arrived in the underworld, the magistrate rebuked me: ‘You, a scholar, dared to falsely compose a prayer, deceiving the Celestial Court!’ I replied, ‘It was Cai Juhou’s intent; I merely wrote the words.’ Soon, several ghosts dragged Cai out, his neck shackled in a chain of cangues, his body emaciated to the bone. Then two more ghosts appeared, holding a bucket of blood. They poured it over his head, and with each dousing, he shrieked in agony, thrashing as if on the verge of death. When he revived, they poured again; when he fainted, they revived him—repeating this four times in quick succession. From afar, he called to me: ‘Go back and tell my wife to save me at once! Here, I am only being made to account for the Yunzhou affair.’\"\n\nCan the execution of the surrendered and submissive ever be justified?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe penal code debates punishments,\nYet even homicide in battle is deemed light.\nTo repel foes and take heads—this is called *just warfare*.\nWhen no other course remains, the unseen realm may pardon the act.\nBut for those who have surrendered—why resort to arms or law?\nTo kill the bound and helpless—heaven’s way is ever watchful.\n\nThe *Annals* say: \"Only with a Bo Le does the thousand-mile steed appear.\"\nYet thousand-mile steeds are ever present—Bo Le is not.\nSo too with men of talent: their fortunes depend on encountering the right patron.\nIf those in power were like Bo Le,\nThen men of virtue and capacity could become prime ministers;\nThose who grasp the greater good could guard the realm;\nMen of strategy could command armies;\nThose skilled in pacification could govern frontiers;\nMen of resolve could oversee surveillance;\nThe incorruptible could manage finances;\nAnd those who cherish the people could serve as prefects and magistrates.\nThus, every office, great or small, would be filled by the right man,\nNo talent left untapped, and all affairs would flourish.\n\nYet the truly upright and worthy must be given authority,\nSo that the court may be well-staffed, officials within and without may stand in awe,\nAnd none dare entertain reckless ambitions.\nHow could such men be demoted or sidelined?\nTo push them aside is to remove obstacles—clearing the way for one’s desires.\n\nThus, those who delight in discerning and promoting talent\nAre ever embraced by the Highest Dao, never overlooked.\nBut those who recklessly demote or exclude others\nAre ever met with the Highest Dao’s stern retribution.\n\nLong ago, Han Chong lifted Yuan An from a mere scribe to the rank of Minister over the Masses.\nAll praised Chong for his discernment, likening him to a radiant light in darkest night.\nYuan An’s upright worth was thus plain to see,\nAnd Chong, too, was recognized by the Highest Dao for this.\nHe was commanded by the immortal official Wang Weixuan to transmit the *Mud-Pill and Purple Portal* method,\nAnd so attained transcendence, ascending to Fengdu,\nWhere he now serves as Left Supervisor of the Registry of Determined Transcendents,\nOverseeing those who first embark on the Daoist path.\n\nIn our dynasty, the Remonstrance Grand Master Xie Bi was most discerning,\nNever offering praise lightly.\nIn his lifetime, he recommended only a few men—all of whom became prime ministers.\n\nEach time he submitted a recommendation, he would burn incense, face the palace, and bow twice, saying: \"This old minister has once more found a man for Your Majesty.\" Wen Zheng and Wang Dan were both among his nominees. On the day of his death, he bathed, burned incense, donned his feathered robe, sat upright, and passed away. His head did not tilt in the slightest—was this not a case of *shijie*? Such was the joy he took in discerning and elevating others, and thus was he recorded by the Highest Dao.\n\nDuring the reign of Chen Houzhu, there was a favored courtier named Sima Shen who delighted in framing others. One day, while napping in the Ministry of State Affairs, a hideous bird suddenly alighted upon him, pecking at his mouth until blood soaked the mat. All pointed to this as retribution for his false accusations.\n\nIn the time of Emperor Shizong of Zhou, there was a man named Tao Gu who likewise took pleasure in slander. The execution of Li Song’s clan and the dismissal of Yu Chongliang were both the result of his single word. When he died, he was buried behind Zhaojue Temple. The tomb’s gate repeatedly shut only to reopen, so the temple monks sealed it with solid stone.\n\nOne night, a great thunderstorm arose, and the tomb’s gate yawned open once more—yet even the skull within had vanished. Was this not the profound punishment of the Highest Dao for wantonly disparaging and expelling others? Who could claim that slandering the upright and driving out the worthy bears no guilt?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe worthy and the true,\nembody the state and cherish the people.\nIf employed in the world,\nthey shelter all beneath heaven.\nThe harm of slander and expulsion\nextends beyond the self.\nThe state’s woes go unheeded,\nthe people’s grievances unaddressed.\nA calamity vast indeed—\nits guilt is equal in measure.\n\n*End of Scroll Nine of the Highest Dao’s Responses to Stimuli*\n*Scroll Ten of the Highest Dao’s Responses to Stimuli*\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\n**Oppressing the orphaned, coercing the widowed.**\nThe *Scripture* states: \"Pitying the orphaned and aiding the widowed\" has already been established as the mark of a good person. Now, \"oppressing the orphaned and coercing the widowed\" is likewise defined as a transgression. Can the orphaned then be oppressed, and the widowed coerced?\n\nAlas for those who, though they have attained deliverance from the world, still do not forget to care for the orphaned and widowed—how much more should those who have not yet attained such deliverance do so?\n\nIn former times, Master Shi Guangzu, an official of Zhen Ding in his early years, was passing through Tanzhou when he heard of a Daoist at Yuantong Monastery surnamed Guo, who excelled at growing vegetables. His produce was always fresh and abundant, supplying all who came. Guangzu went to visit him. The Daoist had long been mute, but upon seeing the master arrive, he suddenly spoke with clarity, imparting secret instructions. Thereupon, Guangzu resigned his post, bathed, lay down in peace, and passed away. The Daoist, too, vanished without a trace.\n\nThat very night, the Emperor in the Chongzheng Hall seemed to see Guangzu arrive riding upon the void. Guangzu presented himself and said: \"Your servant was once Vice Staff Officer under the True Martial Lord of the Northern Culmen, in the Protector Saint’s Abbey. As for the Daoist Guo, he was the Inspector of Laws under the Northern Culmen. Both of us were banished to the human realm for minor transgressions, and now our allotted time has come—we are to return. Yet mindful of the grace of past emoluments and a small request to make, I have come especially to express my gratitude. My son, Tingzhi, has not yet sought audience on court affairs; I humbly beg Your Majesty to bestow instruction, that he may not hold office in vain and thereby tarnish his father’s reputation.\" With these words, he vanished.\n\nA month later, a memorial arrived from Tanzhou, confirming that Guangzu had indeed departed this world.\n\nIt was further reported: There was once a scholar from Langzhou who, having failed the examinations, lingered long in the capital. While wandering Mount Bailiang, he was suddenly seized by two azure-clad attendants at the Cave of Celestial Longevity. They revealed to him the Jade Emperor’s golden register and led him to the Northern Culmen beneath the Central Heaven, where he was vested in robes of gold and purple and appointed as Vice Recorder of Life and Death, Merit and Demerit, Longevity and Brevity under the True Martial Lord of the Protector Saint’s Abbey. One day, as he accompanied the True Lord on his descent, he suddenly heard weeping. Looking down, he saw that it was his wife.\n\nThe Vice Recorder entreated the True Lord to allow him to send word to his wife, and the True Lord permitted him to write a letter. Taking an earthly courier’s horn-sealed packet, he dispatched a direct talisman to deliver it to the vice-prefectural office of his home prefecture. When the letter arrived, it could not be opened; only after his wife was summoned did it unfold. Within, he recounted in full his encounter with the True Lord and repeatedly urged her: “Above all, raise our orphaned children and safeguard our household.” Alas! Even those who have already attained liberation from the world remain so deeply attached—how much more so those who have not? Here, indeed, lies the root of ancestral grievances. If this were not the case, why would the Most High have established the Register of Petitions, urging people to submit memorials seeking absolution?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe orphaned and widowed, without refuge—\nKing Wen always placed them first.\nYet even with benevolent governance,\ntheir plight may still not be fully redressed.\nAlas for our single lineage,\nbrothers fallen into ruin.\nHow could one bear such cruelty,\nbereaving those who depend on them?\nFor such a person,\nretribution will surely follow.\nDiscarding the law to accept bribes—\n\nThe *Scripture* states: The Most High declared: “Of all matters of right and wrong, weight and lightness, why begin with discarding the law to accept bribes?” Because to discard the law is necessarily to accept bribes; once bribes enter, right is made wrong and wrong is made right—all else is disregarded. How pitiful that they do not know: for every law and statute, the spirits and gods are ever aware. To discard the law and accept bribes is to invite the stripping of rank and emolument.\n\nLong ago, when Fan Zhiquality was yet obscure, he sat in a teahouse in Fengqiu, idly inscribing a fan with the lines:\n*“In the scorching heat, the cruel official departs;\nthe cool breeze brings an old friend.”*\nSuddenly, a grotesque stranger stepped forward and bowed, saying: “The suffering of those wronged by cruel officials is far worse than the scorching heat. One day, you must thoroughly investigate this abuse.” With that, he took the fan and left. Fan was left bewildered for a long while. Days later, passing a temple, he saw a clay-and-wood statue of a ghost at the gate—its appearance strikingly like the man he had met—and the fan was in its hand. Greatly astonished, when Fan later rose to high office, he first proposed revising the overly broad and baseless laws, where officials exploited loopholes for malfeasance. The Zhou Ancestor thus commanded him to compile and standardize them, creating the *Criminal Statutes*. Who can say the spirits and gods do not oversee all?\n\nWhen Hou Jian served as magistrate of Jiangxia, he had long been acquainted with Abbot Juyue of Shengyuan Mountain. Whenever he found leisure, he would visit the abbot, and upon arrival, the monastery would always have prepared for his reception. One day, he came again, only to be received with unusual neglect. Startled, Hou questioned the abbot, who replied: “Whenever you visit, the local earth god always reports in advance, saying, ‘The Minister is coming.’ This time, he did not report, so we failed to prepare.” Hou was deeply alarmed and secretly instructed the abbot to ask the earth god why he had not reported. That night, the abbot dreamed that the earth god said: “Hou Jian was destined to become a grand councilor, and as such, he fell under my jurisdiction, which is why I always reported his coming. Recently, however, he accepted sixty taels of silver from the Hu family and wrongly decided a case. The Heavenly Bureau has already stricken his name from the register of grand councilors, leaving him only the post of provincial inspector. Since he no longer falls under my jurisdiction, I no longer report his visits.” If this is so, can it be said that his rank and emolument were not diminished? How pitiful that he did not know: had he not discarded the law, he would have attained liberation from the world.\n\nIn former times, Wang Changyu, originally a judicial officer in Tongchuan, never dared to abandon the law or accept bribes. In the end, the Supreme Emperor took him into his register, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight, becoming the Perfected of Preserving Harmony. Wang Laozi, originally a judicial officer in Pu Prefecture, likewise never dared to abandon the law or accept bribes. He eventually encountered Master Zhongli, who transmitted to him the essentials of the Dao, enabling him to foreknow fortune and misfortune. During the Huizong Emperor’s reign, he was summoned to court and granted the title \"Master of Penetrating the Subtle.\" Alas! With such a heart, how could one not unite with the Dao above? If even petty officials can do this, how can scholar-officials fail to do so?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nRefusing the horses of Lu, his avoidance of summons is still recalled.\nTrembling before the \"four who know,\" he escaped entanglement.\nWhen material desires shift, emotions and conduct must change.\nIf bribes are accepted, even Tang the Completer would shun them.\nThose who wish to uphold the law must shun even the appearance of melons and plums.\nTo twist the straight into the crooked...\n\nIt is recorded: When Lu Chong knew of the descent of the Perfected Lord of Assisting Sageliness in Fengxiang, he arranged a ritual and inquired about the essentials of conducting oneself and acting in the world. The Perfected Lord said: \"Exert yourself in serving your lord, do not covet ill-gotten wealth, do not meddle in improper affairs, rectify and redress judicial cases, succor and heal the people. If your actions accord with the kingly Dao, you will naturally be a fortunate person. Accumulated transgressions become calamities, and one will surely sink into ruin. How then can those who hold judicial office fail to devote themselves wholeheartedly to rectifying and redressing wrongs? How dare they twist the straight into the crooked? Let me speak of one or two great elders, that all may know and emulate them.\n\nIn the past, when Lord Han of Wei governed Daming, litigation in Wei was most numerous. Matters great and small, he personally adjudicated all. Even when ill, he allowed reports to reach him and decided cases from his sickbed. Some, deeming his toil excessive, urged him to delegate to his subordinates. He said: 'When two parties are in litigation before the court, it is a matter of great consequence for the people. Life or death, bestowal or deprivation—all hinge on my single word. How can I treat this lightly?' After his death, he became a Perfected of the Purple Bureau.\n\nOuyang Wenzhong, the great Confucian of his time, whenever he conversed with guests, never spoke of literature but only of governance. Zhang Shunmin, finding this strange, asked him why. He replied: 'Literature merely adorns the self, but governance can reach others.' When I was demoted to Yiling in my prime, still unsatisfied with my learning, I wished to read the *Records of the Grand Historian* and the *Book of Han*. Neither public nor private collections had them, so I took the archived case files of bygone years and perused them one by one. Among them, right and wrong were often confused: what was not became what was, the crooked was made straight, laws were violated for personal favor, kinship was severed, and moral teachings were harmed—nothing was not present. I often sighed with joy, saying: 'Even in a small and remote place like Yiling, things are like this. The state of the realm can well be imagined.' Thereupon, I swore to Heaven: 'From now on, in all matters, I will be even more diligent and careful, never daring to be the least bit negligent.' To this day, over thirty years later, whether serving within the court or beyond, I have humbly held the three offices, conducting myself by this principle. Others may esteem me as a master of literature and governance, but in my own view, this is merely the reward for the oath I made in those days.\" After his death, he became the Transcendent Official of Divine Clarity.\n\nIf those who twist the straight into the crooked meet such ends after death, what fate awaits them?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWalking the straight path, impartial and unaligned—\nThis is the good person, worthy of esteem and reward.\nTo slander them as crooked is to punish what should be praised.\nWhat crime have the good committed to suffer such wrong?\nAfter executing Wang Chang, where could Hong and Xian flee?\n\nTo twist the crooked into the straight...\n\nIt is recorded: Some cases are straight yet cannot prove themselves so; some principles are crooked yet their crookedness is not self-evident. This is why litigation is so contentious, awaiting officials to decide. Those who serve as officials must be impartial in heart. If they analyze even a single word, then the crooked and the straight will all become as clear as melting ice. Even if the case is tangled, it will surely be resolved as if splitting bamboo. How then could there be the error of twisting the crooked into the straight? Those who do so are simply unable to be impartial, and must be yielding to influence.\n\nIn former times, Lord Liu of Yizhou Prefecture, when first serving as the constable of Lianjiang, encountered a case where villagers had disputed over fields for ten years without resolution. The prefecture entrusted it to him, and he uncovered the deceit, immediately rendering a decision. Right and wrong were thus distinguished. People called him divine, but he was not divine—he was merely impartial in heart. When he left office, the party who had been in the right waited for him in Jian Prefecture. Drawing him aside, he said: 'I have some fine incense, a few catties, as a small gift to honor you.' When opened, it was gold. Lord Liu laughed and declined, saying: 'Your case was just; I did not favor you privately. How dare I accept a private bribe for public duty?' He firmly refused, and all at the time admired him. Later, his two sons, Yuanfu and Gongfu, both gained renown for their literary talents. Who can say that serving in office with an impartial heart brings no reward?\n\nThere was also Liu Anmin, originally a clerk in Danleng County. He maintained a fair and upright heart, long respected by both officials and people. When villagers had disputes, they did not immediately go to the county court but first sought him out, laying out the right and wrong, asking whether to proceed. Only then would they act. He also took pride in this, accepting their requests without refusal. If a case was just, he affirmed its justice, saying: 'The principle is straight; it can proceed.' If it was crooked, he forthrightly enumerated its faults, saying: 'This is crooked; it does not accord with the law. Proceeding will surely lead to error.' As a result, litigation in the county sharply decreased. Later, his two sons both passed the imperial examinations in succession. The elder, Ji, rose to the rank of Grand Master for Palace Attendance. The younger, Shi, became Gentleman for Court Discussion, Rectifier of the Imperial Archives, and Judicial Intendant of Zizhou Circuit. One daughter married Yang Jun and also held office. To this day, they have become a prominent family. Who can say that a clerk’s impartial heart brings no reward?\n\nIn general, whether crooked or straight, all receive blessings;\nBut those who twist the straight into the crooked or the crooked into the straight all incur misfortune.\nBeware!\n\nPraise says:\nCrookedness defies principle, becoming flattery or depravity.\nSuch are called evil men—how can they be concealed?\nTo reward them as if upright is to gnaw at the state and ruin the family.\nHow fortunate are evil men to receive such favor and praise!\nWhen Deyu was exiled, was it not [Li] Minzhong’s doing?\nTo elevate the light and make it heavy.\n\nThe *Records* states: The *Book [of Documents]* says: \"In doubtful cases of guilt, incline toward leniency.\"\nThe *Analects* says: \"If you grasp the truth of the matter, then pity them and do not rejoice.\"\nThese are the great intentions of the sages in their compassion for those subject to punishment.\nYet can the light be elevated and made heavy?\nThus the noble person is cautious of this.\n\nFormerly, Wang Jin served as Judicial Intendant of the Two Zhe Circuits. Whenever he sentenced a prisoner to death, he would first burn incense and memorialize Heaven before issuing the decree. One evening as he sat in his chambers, he suddenly saw a divine being in a cloud-patterned cap and crimson robes, holding several scrolls of official documents. Beside him stood a jade maiden in long robes and wide sleeves, holding a corner of an official document. They stood beneath the eaves and called out to Jin from afar: \"These are the cases you have memorialized in your life—each one accords with principle and law, without any injustice or excess. The August Emperor commends you and has already extended your father’s lifespan by twelve years, while doubling your own blessings for the same span. Your two grandsons will also one day serve as circuit intendants—strive even harder.\" With these words, they vanished.\n\nLi Guixiang also held a judicial post and was long known for his integrity and prudence. One evening, as he passed over Sanjing Bridge, he suddenly saw a dozen or so people crying out in grievance and protest, approaching in twos and threes until they pressed close. Guixiang was greatly alarmed; he wheeled his horse around and galloped home, where he collapsed in exhaustion. Summoning his sons, he warned them: \"If any of you enter officialdom in the future, never accept an appointment as a prison or judicial officer. Though I have lived my life with integrity and caution, who could have known such things would still befall me today? From this distress, I will never recover.\" And so he fell into deep melancholy and ultimately did not rise again.\n\nAlas! Both gentlemen were men of renown in their time—yet while Lord Wang met such a fate, Lord Li’s was even more dire. Could it be that Lord Li still harbored some lapse in prudence? How much worse, then, for those who treat light matters as heavy?\n\nLet me recount a few more cases, that all may take heed.\n\nIn former times, Ouyang Yu served as a judge in the Court of Judicial Review. There was a magistrate of Liyang County named Yu Shaoqing, imprisoned on charges that did not warrant death, yet Yu condemned him to execution. On the day the sentence was carried out, all deemed it a grievous wrong. From that moment, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, Yu saw Shaoqing following him relentlessly, never leaving his thoughts, never granting him peace. In desperation, he journeyed to Mount Lu to seek the Nine Heavens Investigating Commissioner, where he arranged a three-day Yellow Altar ritual to atone for his deed. At the first night watch, he already saw Shaoqing at his side, filling him with dread. The next morning, he submitted another written confession, and just as he bowed in submission, he was suddenly seized by several ghosts, hurled before the altar steps, his body drenched in blood. After some time, he died.\n\nWhen Li Ruoshui served as Judicial Commissioner of Huainan, five bandits were captured and imprisoned after a failed robbery. They claimed to have conspired with a monk named Zicheng. Though the five were soon executed, the monk was only then being pursued. The monk protested his innocence, insisting he had never been a thief. Ruoshui could have shown leniency in this matter, yet he stubbornly upheld the bandits’ testimony as truth. That night, he had the monk’s mouth and nose sealed with damp paper, then pressed a sack of earth upon him. In an instant, the monk’s belly split open, and he died.\n\nA month later, the prison officer Li Neng suddenly cried out for no reason: “The monk had nothing to do with me—it was the Judicial Commissioner who forced me to do this!” With those words, he collapsed and died. The next day, the investigator Liu Yuan also died suddenly.\n\nThe following day, Ruoshui also suffered excruciating pain in his lower abdomen, shrieking in agony before he died. The day after, the military prefect Sun Yu and the judicial officer Zhao Yu likewise died suddenly. Before long, Ruoshui’s entire household perished, nearly extinguished without a single survivor left. Alas, Ruoshui’s calamity was truly cruel. From the moment of Zicheng’s death—his navel and belly torn asunder—was this not cruelty? This must have been the wrath of the August Heaven.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe law weighs heavily upon wrongful convictions,\nand fear of guilt extends even to doubt.\nWhen two offenses are weighed together,\nthe measure of mercy may be known.\nIf even the statutes of the state are thus,\nwhat more the legal officers?\nThe Tang ministers wove false charges,\nand the extermination of their clans was just.\nLong-nurtured disaster leaves a stench,\nyet what benefit is there in dying thus?\nTo meet killing with rage—\n\n**It is said:** According to the *Nirvana Sutra*, the dead in perilous straits\nhave no provisions;\ntheir destination is distant, with no companions;\nthey wander day and night, knowing no bounds;\nthrough deep, dark abysses, with no lamp to light the way;\nentering places without doors, with no refuge;\nthough no pain afflicts them, it cannot be healed;\nthey journey without hindrance, yet cannot escape.\nAlas, when a person comes to this,\nit is truly pitiable.\nWhen witnessing killing, how can one respond with anger?\n\nIn the days when the Venerable Zhigong was in the world, two Daoist monks traveled together. One went to a garden to buy melons, and the gardener grew angry: “The great households have not yet bought any—do you presume to do so?” He refused to sell. When the other monk went, the gardener happily sold to him, even consoling him: “Are you parched from the heat?” After selling one melon, he gave another. The two monks privately marveled and asked Zhigong about it. Zhigong said: “Five hundred lifetimes ago, the gardener was executed for a crime, and you two happened to be nearby. The one who succeeded in buying the melon had once pitied him, and so now rejoices at the sight of him. The one who failed to buy had once spoken words of ‘self-made, self-received,’ and so now meets him with anger. If a single careless word can leave such lasting resentment, how much more so when met with rage?”\n\nWang Tanlüe once slaughtered an ox. As the ox saw the knife and charged, Tanlüe grew furious and stabbed its eyes before killing it. Generally, there is no distinction between humans and beasts—when witnessing killing, one should find a way to save them. If saving them is impossible, one can only grieve and sigh in sorrow. How can one respond with anger?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen a person bears guilt,\ntheir circumstances may be unforgivable.\nYet if they submit to the law themselves,\nwhat concern is it of mine?\nTo add fury to the matter\nis called misplaced wrath.\nWhen the judge casts down his brush at a death sentence,\nthose who witness it should awaken.\nTo pity and commiserate in all legal cases\nis the duty of royal governance.\n\n*Tai Shang Ganying Pian*, Scroll Ten—concluded\n*Tai Shang Ganying Pian*, Scroll Eleven\n\n**Biography of Li Changling**\n*Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi:*\nTo recognize one’s faults and inevitably correct them.\n\nThe *Biography* states: Yanzi never repeated his mistakes, and Confucius praised him for it. \"Never repeating\" means that the moment a thought arises within, one corrects it at once, never allowing it to manifest in action. Generally, the value of a fault lies in its correction—failing to correct it makes it a true fault indeed. How can such faults be enumerated? Thus, the noble person, upon hearing of their faults, wastes no time in amending them.\n\nIn former times, Kou Laigong Zhun, from youth, enjoyed wealth and nobility, indulging in excessive luxury. When he was appointed Minister of Military Affairs, his rewards and gifts grew even more lavish, and his guests and visitors gathered to admire, none failing to praise him. Only an old serving woman wept silently. Startled, he asked the reason, and she replied: \"When the late Lady passed away, we could not even obtain a single bolt of silk to make her shroud—how could we have known the Lord would reach such heights today?\" Overcome with grief, he struck his chest in sorrow. From that day forth, he humbled himself and embraced frugality, never again daring to indulge in extravagance.\n\nCai Wenzhong Qi was fond of drinking throughout his life, always drinking to the point of intoxication. At the time, his venerable mother was already advanced in years, her heart heavy with worry. One day, Master Cundao visited his post and admonished him with a poem:\n\n*The sagely lord’s grace runs deep, selecting you for high office;*\n*Your kind mother’s years are long, her hair like the crane’s white plumes.*\n*Neither the sovereign’s favor nor a mother’s kindness have you repaid—*\n*If drink becomes a sickness, what regret could ever suffice?*\n\nUpon receiving the poem, he was deeply ashamed. From then on, he abstained from wine, drinking only with close kin and old friends, and never again became drunk in his lifetime.\n\nWhen Sima Wengong was but five years old, he tried to peel a green walnut but could not remove its skin. A maidservant poured hot water over it to loosen the husk. Later, his elder sister returned from outside and asked who had peeled it. Wengong replied: \"I did it myself.\"\n\nHis father rebuked him from the side, saying: \"How dare you, child, speak falsehoods!\" From that moment, Wengong took heed and never again dared utter a lie throughout his life, treating all with utmost sincerity.\n\nWhen Xu Jiexiao first met Master Anding, his head carriage was slightly tilted. Anding said in a stern voice: \"The carriage of the head must be upright.\" Wengong immediately understood: \"If the carriage of the head must be upright, how can the heart be allowed the slightest crookedness?\" From then on, he never once allowed his heart to deviate, and whenever asked about the essentials of conducting oneself in the world, he would invariably write the two large characters \"uprightness\" and \"integrity\" to instruct them.\n\nWere these gentlemen—when faced with their faults—men of understanding who refused to change?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe eclipse of sun and moon,\nonce passed, shines brighter still.\nWho among men is without fault?\nBut to correct it with sincerity—\nthis is what matters.\nTo craft excuses, to cloak deceit,\nto conceal one’s true feelings,\nto pile fault upon fault—\nhow can the heart of goodness ever arise?\nNot to begrudge a single word,\nbut to act with all one’s strength—\nthis is what is noble.\nTo know the good and not do it...\n\nAs the *True Person of Responding to the World* said: \"To take the small is how one achieves the great; to accumulate the one is how one completes the myriad.\" The *Book of Changes* states: \"Auspicious blessings must return to those who accumulate goodness.\" Generally speaking, goodness demands accumulation. What one knows must be done, and what one does must be done with all one’s strength. It is like planting a seed: though at first it is exceedingly small, with watering and nurturing, though its growth is not immediately seen, in time it will become great. One must understand that in the course of daily life, one must never regard small acts of goodness as without benefit and thus fail to perform them.\n\nHave you not heard the words of the Primordial Lord? The Primordial Lord said: \"When a person has one good deed, the heart is settled and the body at ease; with ten good deeds, the qi and strength are robust; with twenty, all illnesses vanish; with thirty, all that is sought is obtained; with forty, one flourishes in wealth and joy; with fifty, descendants multiply; with sixty, one escapes calamity; with seventy, heavenly spirits protect one; with eighty, one gains the advantages of the earth; with ninety, one is honored and renowned among the worthy; with one hundred, treasured omens descend; with two hundred, one’s name spreads through later generations; with three hundred, later generations become greatly prosperous; with four hundred, later generations attain purity and nobility; with five hundred, later generations enjoy long life; with six hundred, later generations are loyal and filial; with seven hundred, later generations are wise; with eight hundred, later generations embody virtue and power; with nine hundred, later generations become worthy sages; with one thousand, later generations become divine immortals; with two thousand, one becomes a teacher of the multitude, a sage, a perfected immortal, a general or an official; with three thousand, one becomes a national teacher, a sage, a perfected immortal, a general or a scribe; with four thousand, one becomes a teacher of the world, a sage, a perfected immortal who governs the host; with five thousand, one becomes a teacher of the spirits, a sage, a perfected immortal and marshal; with six thousand, one becomes a teacher of the divine luminaries, a sage, a perfected immortal and minister; with seven thousand, one becomes a teacher of the various heavens, a sage, a perfected immortal and high official; with eight thousand, one becomes a teacher of the Three Heavens, a sage, a perfected immortal emperor; with nine thousand, one becomes one of the Five Lords of the Primordial Beginning; with ten thousand, one becomes the Supreme Jade Emperor.\"\n\nThus, the ancients, in matters of goodness, knew without fail what must be done and did it without fail with all their strength. Formerly, Chancellor Li Fang once said to others: \"Of the phrase in the *Analects*—'to be frugal and love the people, to employ the people at the proper time'—I have practiced it all my life and still have not fully attained it. This is what it means to strive with all one’s strength.\" Academician Yang Yingzhi, upon hearing a single good word, would invariably write it down and remember it—this is what it means to know without fail what must be done. Jia An, the Hanlin Academician, having passed the imperial examinations as *zhuangyuan*, said that what he gained from [Fan] Wenzheng was the two words \"never deceive,\" which he used throughout his life without exhaustion—this is what it means never to deceive. Liu Anshi, the Grand Censor, renowned for his forthright speech, said that what he gained from Wengong was the two words \"utmost sincerity,\" which he practiced throughout his life without the slightest deviation—this is what it means to be without fail sincere.\n\nIf every person were like these gentlemen, then to accumulate the one and complete the myriad—what difficulty would there be?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nThe Lord Guo excelled in approving the good—how then did the state perish?\nThough he rejoiced at seeing virtue, his resolve was not firm.\nIndolence harms the Dao, and in turn obscures right from wrong.\nThus the noble person sets his mind on self-strengthening,\nEver feeling the day insufficient, hastening in earnest.\nTo blame oneself and cite others—\nAs the tradition says: According to the scriptures, in all the world,\nLife and death follow one another in succession.\nAt the moment of death, before the warmth has left the body,\nA lifetime’s good and evil all appear at once.\nGenerally, the visions that arise at death’s threshold\nAre but the landscapes of one’s own heart.\nThe beads of sin held by Earth Treasury\nAre the very pearls of one’s own mind.\nThe mirror of deeds before King Yama\nIs the mirror of one’s own heart.\nMoreover, when one commits a single wrong today,\nDoes it not linger always in the breast?\nWas it not so when Zhao Pu, upon hearing the Daoist’s last word—“fire”—on the placard,\nKnew at once it must refer to Qin Wang Tingmei?\nOr when Wang Shao, upon hearing the words, “Has the eighteen-foot blade passed through your heart?”\nSuddenly developed a carbuncle on his back and died?\nThen is it truly beneficial to blame oneself and cite others?\n\nLong ago, Zhao Ye passed the imperial examination in the *mingjing* degree\nAnd was appointed magistrate of Qinghua in Bazhou.\nSuddenly his spirit wandered, and he fell into a dreamlike stupor,\nOnly to be seized and taken to the underworld.\nUpon arrival, he saw his brother-in-law Jia Yi there,\nAnd his heart filled with dread.\nFor he and Yi had once slaughtered an ox together,\nAnd now Yi had come to implicate him.\nWhen he sought to share the blame, Yi’s words were sharp,\nLeaving him no way to exonerate himself.\nThen suddenly a mirror, over a *zhang* wide,\nHung suspended in the air.\nIn its brightness, he saw Yi’s crime of butchery at the gate,\nAnd the reluctance in his face.\nOnly then did Yi admit his guilt, and Ye was allowed to return.\n\nMoreover, there was a woman of the Chang clan named Meiniang, whose husband, Chu Chunqing, had a concubine surnamed Ma, named Chunnu. Chunqing doted on her. Unable to contain her rage, Chang seized the opportunity while Chunqing was away and bludgeoned Chunnu to death with a heavy staff. Later, when Chunqing died, Chang remarried a man named Cheng Xuan. As she was about to give birth, the labor lasted three days, and the child could not be delivered. In her exhaustion, she suddenly saw Chunnu standing before her. Terrified, Chang pleaded gently, saying, \"I truly had no intention of killing you at first. The beating went too far, and it cost you your life. Could you not show me some leniency?\" Chunnu replied, \"My death was indeed at my mistress’s hands. How could you falsely implicate another?\" She pressed harder, and Chang ultimately did not survive.\n\nThus, can one truly escape by blaming oneself and citing others? Once you know you are at fault, why not refrain from the deed altogether?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nCalamity is self-made, and its consequences are self-inflicted.\nWith deep remorse and repentance, perhaps it may yet be redeemed.\nTo ignore one’s own faults and instead implicate others—\nEven if one evades the snares of guilt, Heaven cannot be deceived.\nSharing blame and accepting wrongdoing is the foundation of turning toward goodness.\n**Obstructing the arts and techniques.**\n\nAs the saying goes: \"So-called arts and techniques\" refer to all who wield skills to seek gain. A single word of discouragement, preventing them from succeeding, is obstruction.\n\nIn Baisha Village at Guankou, there stood a Temple of Mount Tai of extraordinary efficacy, where vegetarian offerings and sacrifices were made nearly every day. One day, a group of physicians and diviners traveled together and encountered an extremely poor man on the road, whom they greatly disdained. Enraged, the man threw himself into the river. Moments later, he emerged holding a dragon and said to the group, \"Each of you practices medicine or divination to relieve others’ suffering in times of urgency—all are close to the Dao. Henceforth, toward those of humble means, you must never harbor duplicity in your hearts.\"\n\nAlas! Though medicine and divination are mere arts, the divine and the wise call them \"close to the Dao\"—can they be obstructed? Have you not heard the words of the Dragon Maiden of Yun’an? Long ago, when Zhai Qianyou was alive, he was renowned for his mastery of summoning and invocation. He noted that in the single district of Yun’an, the Yangtze’s currents were perilous in fifteen places. One day, he performed a ritual to summon the rapids’ spirits and command them to be pacified. That night, fourteen rapids answered his call. Only one failed to appear. The Heavenly Master grew furious and insisted on summoning it. When it finally arrived, it was a woman, wearing a towering headdress and voluminous sleeves, who approached and declared resolutely, \"The Heavenly Master carries out Heaven’s transformations—how dare I, a mere water spirit, defy you? Yet there is something unsettled, and I cannot but report it. Your intent is merely to facilitate boats and vessels.\"\n\nYet how could you not know that those who ply the boats and vessels daily reap double the profit? Even if there are minor expenses, they are no true loss. Along this stretch of the river live three or four hundred humble folk, with no fields to till, no silk to weave—entirely dependent on hauling and porterage for their livelihood. If all the rapids were smoothed, it would indeed benefit the boats, but what would become of those small folk and their sustenance? The Most High’s intent would surely never permit such an outcome. I fear that in time, the blame would fall upon me, and I would be burdened with guilt—this matter must be reconsidered.”\n\nThe Heavenly Master sighed and said, “Your concern is beyond what I had considered.” Thereupon, he commanded the spirits of the fourteen rapids to restore their former dangers. That night, wind and rain roared, thunder crashed, and lightning struck. By morning, the fifteen rapids surged with waves, just as they had before.\n\nFrom this, we see that not only must the arts of Dao not be obstructed, but all those who labor for their daily bread must likewise not be obstructed. When Master Fan Wenzheng was in western Zhejiang, the two Zhe provinces suffered famine, and the starving lay strewn like kindling. Observing that the people of Wu were fond of Buddhist rites, he summoned the abbots of the temples and instructed them that with grain expensive and labor cheap, construction should proceed everywhere. The government, too, launched major works, repairing granaries, government offices, and the like. Thus, artisans and laborers—those who toiled for public and private patrons—numbered in the thousands daily. The entire region relied on this, avoiding displacement. Was Master Fan’s intent not the same as that of the dragon spirit of Yun’an?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe minor arts may be observed,\nYet one must not cling to them.\nThe learning of the noble one\nMust also wander through the arts.\nWhat are called the esoteric arts\nAre not abandoned by the sage.\nMedicine, divination, astrology, calendrics—\nAll serve the world.\nIf I alone obstruct them,\nHow can I escape blame?\nTo slander the worthy and wise—\nThis is the true transgression.\n\nThe tradition states: The worthy and sagely are of three kinds. In the teachings of the Buddha, these are the three vehicles; in the teachings of the Dao, they are the five grades of immortals; and in our Confucian tradition, they are the masters Confucius and Mencius. Though their teachings differ, the gateway of the mind-ground is one and the same. Have you not heard what is said in the *Po Xie Lun*: that Confucius was the Bodhisattva Ru Tong, Yan Hui was the Bodhisattva Guang Jing, and Laozi was Mahākāśyapa? Alas, the worthy and sagely are distant indeed—yet to slander their writings is to slander them.\n\nNow, among the scriptures of the Buddha, many are destroyed. Why? Simply because they speak of emptiness. It is a pity that their critics do not understand that the nature of the Tathāgata is like empty space, and the nature of empty space is the Tathāgata. Perfect in true purity and clarity, wondrously empty and spiritually penetrating, that which abides in true purity and clarity, wondrous emptiness and spiritual penetration—this is the Tathāgata. To dwell all day in true purity and clarity, wondrous emptiness and spiritual penetration, yet never truly be pure, clear, empty, or spiritually penetrating—this is the ordinary person.\n\nIf one can empty all that exists, leaving it utterly bare, exposed, and pure as empty space, then true purity and clarity, wondrous emptiness and spiritual penetration will manifest clearly, and one will become one body with the Tathāgata, without distinction. Who could say this is not so? Have you not heard the saying of Elder Pang: \"Only desire to empty all that exists; do not desire to substantiate what does not exist\"? Elder Pang in a former life was Vimalakīrti; Vimalakīrti in a former life was the Tathāgata Golden Grain. His words were certainly not deceitful.\n\nYet some awaken to this truth and some do not—this is simply because the capacity of each person differs.\n\nOnce, Duke Du Qi disbelieved in the Buddha-dharma, often mocking it in the presence of guests, for which Zhang Wending deemed him a flatterer of Buddhism. A physician surnamed Zhu frequented the households of both gentlemen and had long wished to find an opportune moment to exhort Duke Qi, yet without success.\n\nOne day, the Duke fell ill and summoned Zhu. Zhu, however, was in the midst of reading the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* and did not go at once. When he finally arrived, the Duke flew into a rage, demanding, \"What manner of book is this *Śūraṅgama*? I know only of Confucius and Mencius!\" Zhu drew the first scroll from his sleeve and presented it to him. The Duke read it through, then demanded the remaining scrolls one after another, until—unawares—he had finished all ten fascicles. Sighing deeply, he exclaimed, \"Truly, this is a wondrous text!\" Thereupon, he dragged Zhu with him to call upon Wending, reproaching him for not having revealed it sooner. Wending merely smiled and said, \"It is like losing something and then finding it—what need is there to question why it was found so late?\"\n\nFrom that day forth, the Duke seemed to have gained profound insight and placed great faith in the teachings. There was also Xu Xuan, a renowned scholar who had never before encountered Buddhist scriptures. The Middle Lord bestowed upon him a copy of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, saying, \"Read it thoroughly, and you will perceive its subtle principles.\" After more than ten days, Xu submitted a memorial, stating, \"I have read it several times over, yet it is as though pouring from one vessel into another—utterly incomprehensible.\" The Middle Lord merely smiled at him.\n\nAlas! Duke Qi, with but a single glance, devoured all ten fascicles, while Xu Xuan, after more than ten days, could not grasp even a single word—is this not a matter of differing capacities?\n\nThe eulogy says:\nMen often speak of shielding their ailments and shunning physicians.\nThe sagely and worthy set forth teachings that cut to the heart of a hundred wrongs,\nYet those who cannot practice them proceed to slander and ridicule.\nChen Jia criticized Dan, and Shusun defamed Ni—\nWords issuing from the mouths of mere youths—why do they not reflect?\nSuch is the way they assail and undermine the Dao and virtue.\n\nThe tradition states: According to the sutras, in ancient times, the youth Sudhana, in his cultivation of the bodhisattva path, diligently sought all bodhisattva teachings. He visited fifty-three great kalyāṇa-mittas, and only then did he attain enlightenment. These kalyāṇa-mittas are great guides—with but a single word, they can shatter the bottom of a lacquer barrel. The benefit they confer is by no means small. What is called the Dao and virtue resides in such persons, and this is not unique to Buddhism or Daoism. Since antiquity, renowned figures have never failed to rely on great kalyāṇa-mittas, who through grinding refinement and stirring encouragement enabled them to shine with brilliance and be celebrated through the ages. Examples include Zhang Liang with the Yellow Stone Elder, Zhuge Liang with Pang Degong, Li Jing with the Curly-Bearded Elder, Yan Zhenqing with Zhang Zhihe, Li Taibai with He Zhizhang, and Du Shaoling with Sima Ziwei. If this is so, can the Dao and virtue be of no benefit to people? Can they be assailed and undermined?\n\nIn the past, when Yin Gong Shilu was demoted to serve in Daliang, he associated with the monk Fayan Chan Master. One day, he said to Fayan, \"Of late, I have come to value withdrawal and tranquility as the highest attainment.\" Fayan replied, \"Why not forget both withdrawal and tranquility? Then you will gain insight, and at the moment of life and death, you will remain clear and undisturbed.\" The military commissioner’s judicial officer, Zhu Yan, had long studied Haiyan’s teachings but had yet to grasp their essence. One day, he asked the lecture monk Yijiang, \"When this body dies, where does this mind go?\" Yijiang replied, \"Before this body dies, where is this mind?\" Zhu immediately attained sudden clarity and was able to fully comprehend the meaning of the entire sutra. Minister Zeng Kai had long admired Chan but had found no resonance. One day, he visited Yuanwu and sought resolution. Yuanwu took out two cases from the *Gong’an* of Yunmen and Zhaozhou—\"Mount Sumeru\" and \"Set It Down\"—and showed them to him. Zeng immediately experienced a breakthrough, and all his lifelong doubts were dispelled. Ouyang Wenzhong did not believe in Buddhism or Daoism, but when he governed the district of Bo, he heard of the reclusive master Xu Changling of Later Tang and invited him to the prefectural residence. They spoke together daily, and with each exchange, he felt a sense of joy and attainment. If this is so, can the Dao and virtue be of no benefit to people?\n\nThe eulogy says:\n\nThe Dao is revered, virtue is noble—all things under heaven take them as their foundation. Yet envy and indolence breed discontent within. Outwardly, one may display arrogance and dominance, but this only reveals one’s mediocrity. To usurp is rebellion; to be haughty is misfortune. Though the cosmos is vast, one must cherish and restrain the self.\n\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Eleven—end\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Twelve\n\n**Biography of Li Changling**\n**Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\n**On the Shooting of Flying Beings**\n\nThe *Tradition* says: The Supreme One declared: When the primordial chaos divided, Heaven and Earth took their places. The pure *qi* became Heaven, the turbid *qi* became Earth. The essence of yang became the sun, the essence of yin became the moon. The essences of the sun and moon became the stars. Harmonious *qi* became humans, peripheral *qi* became beasts, thin *qi* became birds, and dense *qi* became insects. Species arise from one another, converging to give birth, each following its karmic retribution and conditioned causes.\n\nYet how do humans differ from flying creatures? As the *Zhao Lun* states: \"Heaven and Earth share the same root with me; the myriad things are one body with me\"—this is no empty speech. The difference between birds and humans lies solely in their karmic fortune and the form of their bodily shells.\n\nI have examined the records and found that some have fallen from humanity into such forms, while others—immortals—have played among them. Liu Anmin was once a wealthy man who pursued empty fame without true attainment of the Dao. After death, he became a phoenix, and after sixty years, he regained human form. In this life, he diligently cultivated the Dao and finally achieved liberation through *shijie*, now residing in the Qinghua Palace. Huang Anshi was once a scholar who longed for transcendence but lacked single-minded devotion. After death, he became a wild goose, and after ninety years, he regained human form. In this life, he advanced in cultivation and finally ascended, now dwelling in the Joyous Heaven of Huangzeng—are these not cases of humans falling into the realm of birds?\n\nOn the ornamental pillars of Liaodong, a crane once alighted. When someone tried to shoot it, the crane spoke: *\"There is a bird, there is a bird—Ding Lingwei. / A thousand years away from home, now I return. / Though the city walls remain, the people are gone. / Why not learn the Dao? Graves lie heaped in rows.\"* Emperor Ming of Tang once shot a crane in Shayuan. Though struck, it spread its wings and flew straight toward the southwest. The following year, when the emperor fled to Shu and visited the Bright Moon Abbey, he saw the arrow lodged in the wall. When he asked where it came from, the Daoist assembly said: \"On the Double Ninth last year, the Daoist Xu Zuoqing of Qingcheng brought it here and left it behind.\" Only then did he realize the crane was none other than Zuoqing—was this not an immortal playing among them?\n\nThe eulogy says:\n\nIn the age of the Great Dao, men harbored no intent to kill. The nests of crows and magpies could be peered into from above. Once the mind of cunning arose, even gulls took flight. Hawks possess loyalty, and crows are called compassionate. Why then are men so unkind, making sport of the hunt and chasing down prey?\n\nThe tradition states: The foregoing has briefly set forth the words of the Most High; now let the teachings of the Buddha serve as proof. The Buddha said: All sentient beings are fundamentally pure. Yet from deluded perceptions, deluded habits arise. From deluded habits, the cycle of birth and death continues. Birth follows habitual tendencies; death follows the flux of change. Those of pure thought ascend, surely reborn in heaven. When thought and emotion are balanced, they neither ascend nor fall, reborn again among men. Clarity of thought brings wisdom; obscurity of emotion brings dullness. When emotion outweighs thought, they flow into errant births—heavily as furred beasts, lightly as feathered flocks. Generally, the seven destinies of rebirth remain inescapable for those who have not entered true cultivation.\n\nThose now born as other kinds were surely once human in past lives; those now human were not necessarily other kinds before. Thus the Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and perfected ones of the Great Dao constantly instruct men to recognize the perilous threshold of birth and death as most fearsome. Have you not heard how the arhat Mātṛceṭa in a past life was a macaque, or how Kālodāyin was once reborn as an ox? Have you not heard that Zhou Xun and Cai Junmo were both serpent spirits? According to the *Dongzhai Record*, when Zhou Xun governed Anzhou, one day while strolling in his garden, the gardener saw a great serpent resting its head upon the railing. Looking closer, it was Zhou Xun in a light slumber. Cai Junmo, governing Fuzhou, fell ill and ceased attending to affairs. Each night, he dreamed of wandering atop the drum tower, leaning upon the drum to sleep. The vice-prefect reproached the drum officer for failing to strike the third watch, who replied that a great serpent coiled upon the drum, making it impossible to approach. When Junmo recovered, he recounted his dreams to the vice-prefect, finding them identical to the drum officer’s account. If the seven destinies of rebirth remain inescapable for those who have not entered true cultivation, how can one avoid them?\n\nKnow this: those now chased may one day chase others. To escape the cycle of rebirth and avoid being pursued, when you see others hunted, you must strive to save them. Once, the Prince of Hejian suffered a long illness with no hope of recovery. Suddenly, a Daoist named Xuan Su arrived at his gate, offering to heal him. After administering a knife-tip of medicine, the prince vomited over a dozen small serpents, and his illness was cured. Astonished, the prince asked the reason. Xuan Su replied: \"This is the lingering misfortune from six generations past. I am not human. In a former life, you saved a doe, who was in truth the mother of a qilin. Your kindness moved heaven and earth, so the Supreme Emperor sent me down to heal you.\" If one sees others hunted, can one fail to save them?\n\nLi Ying and Li Yan once chased a deer, binding its four legs and hanging it from a tree branch. They first took its organs to roast, preparing to eat. Suddenly, a giant, nearly ten feet tall, appeared, carrying a massive sack. Striding forward, he nearly reached them. Then, gathering all the roasted meat, he placed it in his sack and departed into the mountains. Soon after, both Ying and Yan died suddenly. If one sees prey running, can one truly chase it?\n\nThe eulogy says:\n\nThe abandonment of Hou Ji was such that even oxen and sheep would not trample him. The orangutan speaks human words, and the gibbon’s nature is gentle and kind. All living beings possess awareness, and their principles are not distant. How can one bear to fill the cauldron with their flesh, savoring their fat and richness? Tigers and rhinoceroses may be escaped, but the snares set by humans are inescapable. The awakening of hibernating creatures—\n\nThe *Records* state: As the *Monthly Ordinances* says: \"In the second month of autumn, thunder begins to withdraw its voice, and hibernating insects seal their doors. In the third month of autumn, hibernating insects crouch within, all plastering their doors. In the second month of spring, thunder resounds, and they open their doors to emerge.\" *Zhe* means \"to hide.\" *Huai* means \"to enlarge\"—enlarging their doors slightly. *(Jin)* means \"to plaster,\" covering their doors entirely. One hibernation, one emergence—all correspond to the qi and seasons, completing their transformations. If this is so, can one truly disturb their hibernation?\n\nThus, the Supreme Writ warns humanity, and the Buddhas especially emphasize protection. Long ago, the monk Huijue once crossed a stream to build a Mañjuśrī Hall, intending to lay planks by the water’s edge. He thought: \"It is winter, and all creatures are hibernating. One must not lightly harm their lives.\" Thereupon, he held a three-day ritual by the stream, vowing that on the day of construction, whether creatures had one foot, many feet, or no feet, they might all be sheltered and kept far away. When the time came to dig to the spring and even after the bridge was completed, not a single ant was seen.\n\nAgain, in the Song era, an elder’s father fell ill, and he prayed before the Medicine Master Hall at Yongzuo Temple. After his father recovered, he prepared incense and offerings, intending to hold a ritual in the hall to repay the divine favor. The temple monk Yizhao said: \"Beneath the Medicine Master’s seat in this hall, there is a swarm of bees that has dwelled for many years, with many kinds among them. Now is their hibernation season. If disturbed, many may be harmed or killed. Would it not be better to move to another hall?\" The elder did not heed him. The monk then prayed in advance before the Buddha, saying: \"On the day of the feast, may the divine power of compassion shield those within the hive, allowing them to temporarily feed on old honey without leaving their doors. May those outside the hive remain undisturbed, unstartled by any commotion.\" When the day arrived, lamps and candles blazed, and the clamor of cymbals and conches filled the air. For a day and two nights, not a single bee was seen.\n\nAlas! Though this was the power of these two men’s vows, it was also the protective power of the sages. Who could say otherwise?\n\nA Eulogy states:\nA ruler of abundant virtue extends grace even to insects.\nWhen building with rammed earth, one must choose the proper season;\nin winter, all things lie in closure.\nPeople seal their doors and windows—\nto destroy a nest is no different.\nThose that crawl, those that fly, those that breathe—\nall share the impulse of life.\nWhether tending the sick or stretching limbs,\nall lie within the compass of our benevolence.\n\nTo startle the roosting—\nAs the tradition says: \"The highest admonish men never to disturb the roosting.\"\nThis aligns with Confucius’ teaching: \"In archery, do not shoot the roosting bird.\"\nIn essence, birds that have settled for the night are like men who have fallen asleep.\nA sudden disturbance—would it not rouse the entire household?\nMost see a difference between them and us,\nyet those of universal heart see no distinction.\n\nLong ago, the Immortal of Spiral Coils,\npracticing the fourth dhyāna, entered and exited breath,\nsat beneath a tree, utterly still.\nA bird, mistaking him for wood, nested in his coiled topknot\nand laid several eggs.\nWhen the Immortal of Spiral Coils emerged from meditation,\nhe sensed the eggs upon his head and thought:\n\"If I rise now, I will surely startle the bird.\nIf the bird does not return, the eggs will perish.\"\nThus, he re-entered samādhi,\nwaiting until the fledglings hatched and flew away one by one\nbefore finally rising.\n\nThere was also the Great Tree Immortal,\ndwelling by the Gaṅgā,\nwho settled his spirit in samādhi for many years,\nhis form like withered wood.\nWandering birds nested upon him,\ndepositing seeds of the *nikkura* tree on his shoulder.\nAs seasons turned, the sapling grew, its branches shading him like clasped hands.\nOne evening, he suddenly arose from samādhi,\nwishing to leave the tree.\nFearing he would startle the birds,\nhe gently and patiently moved the sapling aside,\nand only then did he rise.\nHeaven admired his virtue and bestowed upon him the name \"Great Tree.\"\nThese beings had already attained the fruit of realization,\nyet their hearts were thus toward a single creature, a single life.\nHow much more should those of shallow merit and power do the same?\n\nAlas, people do not know of Li Xizi or Chen Anshi,\nwho, by daring not to disturb the roosting, attained realization.\nLi Xizi was originally an old mountain woman.\nWhenever heavy snow fell and birds had no perch,\nthey would flock to her home and remain.\nShe fed them grain and dared not startle them.\nThe Lord of Heaven, deeming her heart benevolent,\ngranted her transcendence of the world.\nNow she resides in Fengdu, her rank and appearance most exalted.\n\nChen Anshi was originally a laborer in the household of Quan Shuben.\nThroughout his life, he never trod upon living insects or took life.\nWhenever he went out and saw birds in his path,\nhe would step aside to avoid them, unwilling to startle them.\nFor this reason, he too ascended to the heavens.\nKnow this: those who attain the truth\nhave never done so without a heart of compassion toward all beings.\n\nA Eulogy states:\nLet all that live abide in their place.\nNight is for rest—man and creature are equal in this.\nThe sage’s concern is that not a single being lose its proper order.\n\"In archery, do not shoot the roosting bird\"—\nthus the *Analects* records.\nThough disturbing the roosting may seem slight,\nthe harm to others is great.\n\nTo fill in burrows—\nFrom a human perspective, it is but a hole.\nFrom their perspective, is it not a palace?\nDo they not see it as a golden chamber, a jade hall,\na deep mansion, a tower of jasper?\nHave you not heard of the ant colony south of the *fen* residence,\nwhich took its burrow for the great locust tree’s realm?\nOr of the eastern ant colony beneath the great sandalwood tree\nveiled in vines behind Wang Yi’s home,\nwhich took its burrow for the realm of the great sandalwood and vines?\n\nAnts taking their burrows for the realm of the locust or sandalwood\nis like shrimps taking their holes for the domain of the long-bearded,\nor swallows taking their nests for the realm of the black-robed.\nEach honors its dwelling—\nall creatures are thus, and it is no great wonder.\nYet can burrows be filled?\nTo fill a burrow is to block its gate,\nto sever its path—\nwould this not bury the entire colony, leaving them to perish within?\n\nAs the scriptures relate, there was once a bhikṣu who had attained the six supernatural powers, dwelling in the wilds with a śrāmaṇera. In meditation, the bhikṣu saw that the śrāmaṇera would die in seven days. He therefore devised a skillful means, speaking kindly to him: \"Your parents long for you. You should return home for a time and come back on the eighth day.\" The śrāmaṇera went home and, as foretold, returned on the eighth day. The bhikṣu, astonished, entered samādhi once more to examine the matter. He then understood that on the śrāmaṇera’s journey home, a stream of water was about to flood an ant colony. The śrāmaṇera had swiftly removed his kāṣāya robe, gathered earth, and dammed the water to keep it from entering. By this cause and condition, his lifespan was extended by twelve years.\n\nThe brothers Song Jiao and Song Qi were traveling together when they encountered an extraordinary monk. Gazing at them, he said, \"The younger Song shall become the foremost scholar of the empire, while the elder Song will not fail to attain high rank.\" Ten years later, the elder Song again met the monk on the road. The monk exclaimed in great surprise, \"Your spirit and bearing are most exceptional. Have you ever saved tens of thousands of lives?\" The elder Song replied, \"I have always been poor—how could I have done such a thing?\" The monk said, \"Ponder it carefully.\"\n\nAfter a long pause, the elder Song said, \"Recently, beneath the hall’s eaves, there was an ant colony suddenly inundated by a torrential flood. I hastily wove a bamboo bridge to ferry them across—could this be the deed you speak of?\" The monk replied, \"It must be so. This year, the younger Song shall indeed rank first among scholars, and you shall not fall beneath him.\"\n\nWhen the examination results were announced, the younger Song did indeed achieve the highest rank. Yet Empress Dowager Zhangxian, declaring that a younger brother ought not precede his elder, decreed that the elder Song be placed first and the younger Song tenth.\n\nBut then—can an ant colony truly be filled in?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nIn the primordial vastness, men dwelt in caves,\nTheir burrows mere hollows, their companions deer and swine.\nWhen the sages arose, they raised beams and laid roofs,\nYet though man and beast differ, both delight in their mounds of earth.\nAll creatures that move and breathe possess spirit—\nHow can they be left without refuge?\nTo overturn a nest—\n\nAs the tradition states: According to the *Preserving Descendants Chapter* of the *Highest Dao*, whenever a lineage is cut short by sorrow, it is because in past lives one overturned nests, shattered eggs, burned mountains, drained marshes, or caused miscarriages and stillbirths—violating one thousand six hundred and twenty precepts. Thus, can a nest truly be overturned?\n\nGenerally speaking, all beings, great or small, each have their place of dependence. There they nurture their young, give birth, and shelter them. If you overturn their nest, you seize their place of refuge, preventing their offspring from thriving—will their line not be severed?\n\nCarefully consulting the *Materia Medica*: If one overturns a stork’s nest to seize its chicks, for sixty *li* around, rain will fail for months on end. For storks can flock together to stir the clouds, and when the clouds disperse, no rain falls.\n\nAgain, observe the osprey: as soon as its chicks hatch, they crawl out of the nest. Fearing they may fall or be scorched by the sun, the mother plucks leafy branches and arranges them around the nest, replacing them twice daily. If the leaves wither, her chicks have fled; if they remain fresh, her chicks are still within. Yet men, overturning the nest, take all the chicks at once.\n\nWho would claim that nest-dwellers are without awareness?\nLet me recount a few more examples—may all take heed.\n\nIn former times, when Wen Zhang served as Prefect of the Capital, he hung a bell-rope in the hall’s forecourt so that grievances might swiftly reach him. One day, sitting alone, he heard the bell ring repeatedly; tracing the sound, he found no one—only a crow perched upon it. Zhang said, “Surely someone has overturned its nest and taken its chicks.” Soon after, the culprit was indeed found and punished with the rod.\n\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, Yuan Ruzhi governed Lushan. Suddenly a stork dropped a grass-woven cloak into the courtyard; he immediately ordered a search. It turned out that a meat-roaster had stripped off this cloak, climbed a tree, and was about to overturn a nest to seize the chicks for sale. Yuan likewise meted out punishment.\n\nCan nests, then, be overturned? When nests are overturned, how can we know the birds do not cry out in sorrow, pleading for rescue? Yet no one understands their speech. Would that a book of the Nine Heavens’ avian tongue existed for all to read!\n\nBai Gui’nian, at the eastern crags of Mount Song, encountered Li Taibai, who said, “Your father, Letian, and I have both ascended as immortals.” He then produced a scroll of plain silk and handed it to him, saying, “Study this, and you will comprehend the speech of birds in the Nine Heavens and the cries of beasts in the Nine Earths. Cultivate further merit and conduct, and immortality may also be within your grasp.” Gui’nian followed the instructions and indeed achieved the promised effect.\n\nOne day, passing through Luzhou, the prefect, learning of his ability, invited him to sit. Just then, two sparrows chirped as they flew across the courtyard. The prefect asked, “What are they saying?” Gui’nian replied, “They say that a household west of the city has surplus grain in its granary; they invite others to join them in feeding there.” Investigation confirmed this.\n\nAfter a while, a stable horse lifted its head and neighed. The prefect asked, “What is it saying?” Gui’nian replied, “The feed in the trough is too hot to eat.” Inquiry proved this correct as well.\n\nIn praise, it is said:\n\nOnce, it was heard that feathered kindred nest near humans,\nSeeking distance from serpents and hawks, they draw close to man alone.\nWho would know those in caps and shoes harbor hearts most unkind?\nHaving devoured their fledglings, they burn their very nests for firewood.\nPhoenixes soar on high, while *niejing* beasts come tamed—\nYet who pities the unborn?\n\nAs the saying goes: creatures born of womb belong to one kind.\nAccording to the Buddha’s teaching, all are bound by the wheel of defilement,\nDriven by delusion to inversion.\nThrough union and growth, tangled thoughts—horizontal and vertical—arise,\nThus giving rise to wombs obstructed or blooming like *pūtán* flowers:\nHumans, beasts, dragons, and immortals—each kind fills the world.\n\nAlas! Humans, beasts, dragons, and immortals are clearly distinct,\nYet the Buddha groups them as one—why?\nBecause their shared defilement binds them to the same wheel of rebirth.\nIf humans cherish their unborn, do those others not cherish theirs?\n\nAccording to the *Records of Immortals*, Bai Wei’nian entered an immortal’s grotto and obtained a scroll of plain silk. Thereupon, he could discern the speech of birds in the Nine Heavens and the cries of beasts in the Nine Earths. One day, passing through Luzhou, the prefect, learning of his ability, invited him to sit. Just then, an attendant drove thirty sheep across the courtyard. Among them, one sheep refused to move despite the whip and let out mournful bleats. The prefect asked, “Does the sheep have something to say?” Gui’nian replied, “The sheep says it carries a lamb in its belly and is about to give birth. Once the birth is done, it will willingly accept death.” The prefect then spared the sheep and did not slaughter it. Later, it indeed gave birth to two lambs.\n\nLiu Daoyuan, having resigned as magistrate of Pengxi, lodged at the Qin family’s home. In a dream, a weeping woman appeared and said, “I was the wife of Master Qin. My husband took a concubine who refused to yield, so in my rage, I beat her to death. The Underworld Judge, swayed by the concubine’s accusation, sentenced me to die and, deeming me cruel, condemned me to be reborn as a sheep in the Qin family’s pen. Tomorrow, I am to be butchered for your meal. Though I accept my death as fate, I carry a lamb in my belly. If it perishes with me, my karmic burden will only grow heavier. I beg you to speak a word on my behalf—if I am spared, I would be most grateful.” At dawn, Liu recounted the dream, but the sheep had already been cooked. The household wept bitterly, retrieved the lamb from its belly, and buried it in a separate villa.\n\nCan the unborn truly be harmed?\n\nIn praise, it is said:\nA deer bound in the hall dies with its bowels torn.\nAn eel, though destined for the pot, coils to shield its young.\nThe love creatures bear for their offspring exceeds even love for themselves.\nHumans, too, conceive to continue their line—\nWhy not reflect and extend such care to others?\nTo crush an egg...\n\nThe *Tradition* records: The bodhisattva Sincere Form addressed the Buddha, saying, “There are sentient beings who have no children, living alone and desolate. What karmic transgression has brought this upon them?” The Buddha replied, “In a former life, such a person was cruel and wicked, disbelieving in sin and fortune. They captured fledglings and devoured eggs, causing all flying birds to lose their young, their cries of grief so piercing that blood flowed from their eyes. This is their retribution.”\n\nThe Buddha spoke thus, and the Supreme Lord’s *Chapter on Protecting Offspring* says the same. Then can eggs truly be broken?\n\nAccording to the *Vibhāṣā Śāstra*, as sentient beings cycle through rebirth, some become egg-born. Consciousness dwells within, bound and enveloped by the egg, until the hatchling pecks its way free. The karmic weight of this is self-evident.\n\nIt is also said: Cranes, geese, mandarin ducks, peacocks, parrots, mynas, *qianqiu* birds, and *Golden-Winged* birds—whether dragons or humans—are all egg-born. I once doubted this, thinking, “Birds are indeed egg-born, but how could humans also emerge from eggs?” Yet upon learning of the tales of Kāśyapa, Gavāṃpati, and King Xu Yan, I came to know that humans born from eggs do exist.\n\nLong ago, in the land of Kuadi, a merchant ventured into the sea to gather treasures. He obtained two cormorants—one died, the other lived—and they transformed at will, their feathers resembling those of a crane. Soon, they laid two eggs. When the eggs hatched, two boys emerged, who later left the household life and attained arhatship. One was named the Venerable Kāśyapa, the other the Venerable Gavāṃpati.\n\nAccording to the *Gazetteer of Xuzhou*, in ancient times, a palace woman of the Lord of Xu conceived and gave birth to an egg. When the egg broke, a child was born. He grew to be benevolent and wise, inheriting the throne of Xu. Because he was born in a reclining position, he was named King Yan.\n\nWho can say there are no egg-born humans?\n\nWhen Zhi Dun was young, he once debated with his teacher about the nature of living things. Dun argued, “Before an egg hatches, killing it does not count as taking life.” His teacher, unable to refute him, took an egg and cast it to the ground. The shell broke, and a chick emerged, only to perish soon after—its spirit and consciousness extinguished. Dun was deeply moved and thereafter ate only vegetables.\n\nLi Daonian was fond of eating chicken eggs. In his later years, he fell gravely ill. Magistrate Chu Cheng fed him perilla juice, and he immediately vomited thirteen objects. When cut open, they were found to be fully formed chicken feathers, wings, claws, and spurs—all capable of flight. Daonian was terrified and never dared eat eggs again.\n\nThen can eggs truly be broken?\n\nI have often reflected that among egg-born creatures, none produce as many eggs as fish. The largest lay thousands, the smallest no fewer than hundreds. To kill a single fish is to destroy countless eggs—how can one even begin to describe the magnitude?\n\nLi Chongyuan once intended to kill a catfish. The night before, he dreamed of a woman in black who pleaded, “In my belly are five thousand children. If I live, they live. If I die, they die. I beg for your mercy—spare my life.” Chongyuan released the fish.\n\nDuring the Xuanhe era, the wealthy merchant Yang Xu dreamed that a deity told him, “You will die in ten days. If you can save a hundred million lives, you may yet be spared.” Xu replied, “The appointed time is near, and the lives of creatures are limited. How can I possibly reach such a number?” The deity said, “The Buddhist scriptures state: Fish eggs, if not dried and salted for three years, can still revive. Why not act on this?” Xu then inscribed the deity’s words on the walls of the main thoroughfare. From then on, people took heed—whenever they saw someone killing fish, they would retrieve the eggs and cast them into the river. After a month, Xu dreamed again of the deity, who said, “The hundred million lives have been saved, and your lifespan may now be extended.” And so it came to pass.\n\nIn general, if we can save the lives of creatures in their moment of peril, our own lives will not fail to be prolonged when death draws near.\n\nEulogy states:\nAll living forms possess inherent nature.\nWhy did Hundun perish? Because of the piercing.\nThose who recklessly harm the unknowing—\ncan this be called impartial kindness?\nThe phoenix gave birth to Shang,\nabode of sagely numen.\nIts mysteries hidden and revealed—\nhow could one not be vigilant and reverent?\n\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Twelve concludes\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Thirteen\n\n*Biography of Li Changqi*\n*Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi*\n\n\"May others err.\"\n\nThe *Biography* states: The *Nirvana Sutra* says: All who cultivate the mind must employ the six equalizing powers of wisdom to govern and restrain their own minds, ensuring that in all actions, everything remains equal.\n\nWhat are the six?\nFirst, the equalizing power of wisdom like an echo;\nsecond, the equalizing power of wisdom like a mirror’s reflection;\nthird, the equalizing power of wisdom like an illusion;\nfourth, the equalizing power of pure wisdom;\nfifth, the equalizing power of worldly dharmas;\nsixth, the equalizing power of conditioned arising.\n\nIn general, one who possesses such wisdom will naturally gain such power. Are not the ten thousand dharmas of the world like an echo, like a reflection, like an illusion? To understand thus—is this not wisdom? Are they not pure in their arising, and equal in their conditions? Know then that \"may others err\" applies only to those who have not yet reached this state.\n\nAt Bozhou’s Drum and Horn Tower, every night at the third watch, a ghost would cover the drum so it could not be struck. The watchman on duty was repeatedly flogged for this, yet could do nothing to stop it. Hearing of Chan Master Huo’s virtuous conduct, he went to ask for his advice.\n\nThe Master said, “Why not seize it?”\n\nThe soldier replied, “How can a ghost be seized?”\n\nThe Master said, “Simply restrain your qi and remain silent—then you may seize it.”\n\nThe soldier followed this instruction and indeed succeeded in capturing the ghost. The ghost said, “In this region, the only ones I fear are Chan Master Huo and Huang the Second—just these two. From the prefect down, I fear no one else. How could I fear you?”\n\nLater, they sought out Huang the Second and found him to be an old gardener who had sold vegetables for a living for thirty years. He had no other skills, only that in judging the tenderness of his greens, the size of his bundles, and the fairness of his prices, his mind remained unwavering.\n\nAlas! That an unwavering mind should command the respect and fear of ghosts and spirits—know then that one whose mind is divided will surely be mocked and toyed with by them.\n\nHave you not heard of Vice Envoy Yu’s affair? When Li Shigeng was sent as an envoy to Goryeo, the military officer Yu Ying served as his deputy. All the gifts and tributes received from Goryeo, as well as other offerings, Li paid no heed to, entrusting everything to his deputy. Fearing the ship might leak on the voyage home, the deputy placed all of Li’s goods at the bottom of the hold, keeping only his own on top. Before long, they encountered a great storm, and the ship nearly capsized. The sailors, in their haste, began tossing cargo overboard without sorting, grabbing whatever came to hand and casting it into the sea. When the wind subsided and they took stock, they found that all that had been discarded belonged to the deputy. Li’s goods remained entirely untouched, not a single item lost.\n\nSuch a reversal—how could it not be the work of sea spirits mocking him?\n\nIn praise, it is said:\n\nThe people fall short of Yao and Shun—Yi Yin blamed himself for it.\nTo stand alone as a gentleman—Bo Yu rejected such folly.\nWould you share life with others? Then bear no debt to loftiness or depth.\nYet those vile men drag the multitude into disgrace.\nWhat heart is this? Not even birds and beasts would feel no shame.\nTo ruin another’s success—\n\nThe *Sutra* states: The Buddha told Elder Śuka:\n\"Good deeds are ten in number, enabling beings to attain great majesty and virtue.\nFirst, toward all beings, harbor no jealousy;\nSecond, upon seeing others gain, rejoice in their good fortune;\nThird, upon seeing others suffer loss, arouse compassion;\nFourth, toward another’s fame or profit, feel joy;\nFifth, when another’s reputation is lost, share their sorrow;\nSixth, arouse the mind of enlightenment, craft Buddha images, and offer jeweled canopies;\nSeventh, toward one’s parents and the noble sages, show reverence and serve them;\nEighth, urge others to abandon deeds of little majesty;\nNinth, urge others to cultivate deeds of great majesty;\nTenth, upon seeing those without majesty, do not despise them.\"\n\nVimalakīrti Bodhisattva said:\n\"One who forgets resentment toward the multitude, follows goodness as a flowing stream, and counters the mind of jealousy—such a one, as karmic fruit, gains a retinue of great worthies.\nIn general, toward others, harbor no jealousy or slander; in oneself, majesty and virtue must increase, while in them, no lack of gratitude or joy arises.\nWhen conditions meet in days to come, they will either become great spiritual friends or great retinues of worthies.\nWho would say this is not so?\"\n\nDuring the Campaign of Chanyuan, the Khitans accepted the treaty and withdrew. Lord Lai often bore an air of self-satisfaction, and the Emperor, too, regarded it as a great achievement. Lord Ji, envious, approached the Emperor and said:\n\"At Chanyuan, Kou Zhun treated Your Majesty as a gaming piece cast against the barbarians. Had we not defeated them, they would have defeated us—this was no long-term strategy for Your Majesty. Such is the *Spring and Autumn*’s ‘treaty beneath the city walls,’ which even the feudal lords deemed shameful. Does Your Majesty consider this a merit?\"\n\nThe Emperor was deeply disheartened. Later, when Kou Zhun memorialized the Guangzhōu campaign, Transport Commissioner Wang Han, inspecting his circuit, reached Haizhōu, where the prefect, Chong Jian, urgently reported an attack by wax-sealed dispatches. Wang advanced to Huìzhōu, where the people of Guǎngzhōu galloped to seek aid. He issued an order: from each village, three great households were to recruit two hundred stalwart men. He also instructed each county under his jurisdiction to enlist twenty archers, and personally recruited twenty valiant men for his own guard. Soon after, he captured over ten raiders, all of whom he waist-slaughtered as a warning. Upon reaching Guǎngzhōu, though his son died at the hands of the rebels, he did not weep. From then on, the southern gate was left unbarred, grain transports flowed unimpeded, and the rebels withdrew.\n\nAt the time, Judicial Commissioner Bao Ke stationed troops in Cháozhōu and daily submitted memorials accusing Wang of cowardice and refusal to fight. Officer Li Dui echoed these charges. Wang was thus demoted by one rank to supervise the salt and tea taxes of Xīnzhōu, while Bao alone received rewards.\n\nAlas! Lord Lai’s merit was indeed great, and Wang Han’s merit was no small matter. Yet a single word from Ji Gong Li Dui brought it to this. Were these two lords practicing good deeds? Did they know how to counter such minds?\n\nKnow then that in days to come, the karmic retribution will yield neither great virtue nor powerful deeds, nor will it produce a lineage of great worthies.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThree sovereigns in concord brought governance to the heights of Cheng and Kang.\nXiao’s rules followed by Cao—thus flourished the Han foundation.\nLi Xun’s envy and scheming brought the Ganlu disaster upon Tang.\nWhen matters do not originate from oneself, one recklessly expands and exaggerates.\nMany are the states ruined thereby—can one’s own peace not be harmed?\nTo endanger others for one’s own safety.\n\nThe *Sutra* records:\nSubhūti addressed the Buddha, saying: “World-Honored One, if good men and good women arouse the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, how should they abide, and how should they subdue their minds?”\nThe Buddha replied: “Excellent, excellent! Good men and good women who arouse the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* should abide thus, and subdue their minds thus.”\nUpon hearing these words, Subhūti silently smiled and thought: “This ‘thus’—what meaning does it truly hold? If I wish to subdue, I may simply subdue—it is only thus. What more is there?”\n\nHow could those who endanger others for their own safety ever comprehend this?\nAlas that they know not the great treasury of teachings, for what is spoken in this passage concerns only the matter of the mind.\nNow, to place others in peril in pursuit of one’s own safety—is this subduing?\nIf others are truly imperiled and oneself truly secure—\nmore often than not, one incurs offense against Heaven, and calamity will soon befall.\n\nFormerly, Wang Wenzhenggong Dan and Wang Jigong Qinyi served together in the government. One day, the emperor presented a poem on the joyous rain to the two ministries. Wenzheng tucked it into his sleeve and returned to discuss it with his colleagues: “There is a single miswritten character in the emperor’s poem—should we enter the palace to report it?” Jigong said: “This is of no consequence.” Later, he secretly memorialized the matter. The emperor flew into a rage and the next day rebuked Wenzheng in a stern voice: “Yesterday, there was a miswritten character in my poem—why did you not report it?” All below, including Wenzheng, bowed twice in apology, save for Ma Zhijie, who did not bow and instead presented the facts in full, extolling Wang with the words: “He is a true prime minister.”\n\nWhen Su Wenzhong was in Hangzhou, the emperor wished to employ him. Wang Yuyu said: “In his poems, Shi once wrote, ‘Only the hibernating dragon knows it.’ Now that Your Majesty has ascended to the heavens as a dragon, do you not show reverence, but instead seek the knowledge of a hibernating dragon?” The emperor replied: “Since ancient times, many have been called dragons—such as the eight dragons of the Xun family, or Kongming the Reclining Dragon. How could such terms befit the Son of Heaven alone?” After the audience, Zhang Zizhen reproached Yuyu: “Does the prime minister intend to destroy the Su clan?” Yuyu replied: “Those were the words of Shu Dan.”\n\nZhang Zizhen said: “Could one consume the spittle of Shu Dan?” Alas, these are all those who endanger others to excess. Had the sagely emperor not seen through their schemes, would the calamity that befell the two lords have been a light one? Truly, they remain ignorant of such discourse.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThrough *Kan* one practices teaching,\nThrough *Gu* one rouses the people.\nThrough *Jian* one rectifies the state,\nThrough *Zhun* one weaves great plans.\nThe noble person dwells in peril,\nYet his will serves others.\nHeaven aids those who follow the Dao—\nTheir Way expands greatly.\nWang Yan’s three burrows\nOnly brought about his ruin.\nTo diminish others is to harm oneself.\n\nThe tradition states: At ten years of age, a person still retains the spirit of childhood. At twenty, having come of age, one may yet hope for achievement. If there is a future ahead, one ought to strive forward. But if one lacks such fortune, one cannot escape drifting through time. Then, with wife and children weighing on the heart and household affairs on the mind—whether holding office, where official duties swarm, or pursuing profit, where market ways are petty—unaware and unknowing, the great term suddenly arrives. Empty-handed, with nothing to accompany one, even if one’s qi and flame once scorched the heavens, none can escape. Have you not heard the words of the Pure Origin Chan Master?\n\nVice Minister Yang Jinqing asked the Pure Origin Master: “When this body is born, from where does it come? After death, to where does it go?”\nThe Master replied: “Like a person dreaming—from where does he come? When he awakens, to where does he go?”\nYang asked: “What is the ultimate truth?”\nThe Master said: “In dreams, one cannot say there is nothing; upon waking, one cannot say there is something. Though there is being and non-being, there is no place of coming or going. This poor monk’s body is likewise.”\nHe then spoke a gatha:\n*See life as a dream,*\n*In dreams, all is clamor.*\n*Suddenly awakened, all things cease—*\n*Just like the realization in dreams.*\n*The wise comprehend the dream,*\n*The deluded believe in its clamor.*\n*To grasp the dream is twofold:*\n*One awakening, no other awakening remains.*\n*Wealth and honor, poverty and lowliness—*\n*There is no separate path.*\nThe Master’s words may be called exhaustive. All the myriad phenomena of the world—none are not dreams.\n\nGuo Congyi was garrisoning Heyang and built a grand estate in Luoyang, comprising over a thousand rooms. All were constructed of fragrant cypress, even the beams made of figured catalpa. The floors were paved with patterned stone, ponds dug and waters channeled in, hills raised and fruit trees planted. Mills and grindstones were installed throughout, and stables, storehouses, pavilions, and towers—nothing was lacking. The estate’s completion required five thousand *ding* of silver.\n\nThe following year, Guo was summoned back to the capital. Arriving at dusk, he took up a candle to survey his estate but had not yet seen it all when the time came for court assembly, allowing no delay. After dining and resting briefly, he departed before dawn. Having attended court and returned, he died upon reaching the Eastern Capital, never again setting foot in his estate. His family could not bear to live there and offered it to the court, which bestowed it upon the Prince of Fu. When the Prince of Fu was exiled to Fuzhou, the estate at Fangling became an abandoned hall.\n\nChen Gonggong, in Runzhou, built a grand estate of equal magnificence. Pavilions, terraces, ponds, and gardens stretched for several hundred paces. Upon its completion, Gonggong had already fallen ill and could only be carried in a sedan chair to ascend the western tower before he, too, soon died. People named his estate the \"Three Impossibles\": *unable to reside, unable to maintain, unable to sell*.\n\nLooking back on the days of planning and building—was it not all a dream? From this, one sees ever more clearly that what enriches others diminishes oneself, and what enriches oneself only diminishes. Have you not heard the saying of the Most High: *\"Some are diminished yet enriched; some are enriched yet diminished\"*?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*Enriching the lowly, diminishing the high,*\n*The people rejoice without end.*\n*Impoverishing others to enrich oneself—*\n*Such a principle cannot endure.*\n*The hexagrams bear no blame,*\n*For humility is noble and radiant.*\n*Waxing and waning, ebb and flow,*\n*Each in turn restrains and uplifts.*\n*Those who seek to enrich themselves*\n*Rarely avoid ruin.*\n*Exchanging good for evil—*\n\n**Record:**\n*\"This body of mine—ears hear, eyes see, body senses, mind knows—clearly exists.\"*\nYet according to the Buddha’s teaching, earth, water, fire, and wind—four conditions combined in illusion—falsely give rise to the six senses. If the four great elements disperse, where would this illusory body of mine reside?\n\n*\"This mind of mine—doing good, doing evil, manifest in daily life—clearly exists.\"*\nYet according to the Buddha’s teaching, the four great elements and six senses, inner and outer, combine to form the illusion of conditioned *qi*, accumulating within. A semblance of conditioned appearance arises, falsely named the mind. Knowing this truth, one seeks awakening beyond illusion.\n\nYet according to the Buddha’s teaching, to speak of awakening in dependence on illusion is still to speak of illusion. To assert the existence of awakening is still not to depart from illusion. To assert its non-existence is likewise. Thus, this body, this mind, and even the seeker of awakening—all are named illusion. How much more so external things—what among them is not illusion? Why, then, falsely distinguish good and evil within them?\n\nVihevahu said:\n*Borrowing the four great elements to form a body,*\n*The mind, originally unborn, arises with conditions.*\n*If prior conditions vanish, the mind too vanishes—*\n*Karma and merit, like illusions, arise and perish.*\n\nThe Fourth Patriarch said:\n*Conditions bear no beauty or ugliness;*\n*Beauty and ugliness arise from the mind.*\n*If the mind does not cling to names,*\n*From where do deluded thoughts arise?*\n\nThe Brahmin Hei once employed spiritual power, holding in each palm a blossoming parasol tree to offer to the Buddha. The Buddha said, *\"Put it down.\"* The Brahmin put down the flower in his left hand. The Buddha said again, *\"Put it down.\"* The Brahmin put down the flower in his right hand. The Buddha said once more, *\"Put it down.\"* The Brahmin replied, *\"World-Honored One, I held only two flowers and have already put them both down. Now I stand empty-handed—what more would you have me put down?\"* The Buddha said, *\"I do not ask you to relinquish the flowers. I ask you to put down the six external dusts, the six internal roots, and the six consciousnesses in between. If you can relinquish all three, with nothing left to relinquish, that is where you escape birth and death.\"* The Brahmin suddenly attained great liberation.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Dezong of Tang, Wu Yuanqing served as the Six Palace Attendant. When the flowers of Luoyang were in full bloom, Yuanqing grew deeply attached to them. Suddenly, a voice from the void said, *\"Illusory forms, blooming and fading without cease—how can they corrupt good roots? Why cling to them?\"* Yuanqing suddenly attained liberation.\n\nThus, Wang Wenzheng disdained thousand-*jin* jade belts, and Lü Wenmu rejected mirrors that could illuminate two hundred *li*—they understood this truth. How could one who exchanges good for evil be told such things? Even if they remain unenlightened by Buddhist scriptures, why not reflect on the Confucian teaching *\"What you do not desire, do not impose upon others\"* and awaken thereby?\n\nWhen Wang Dan was chief minister, someone presented a jade belt through his younger brother, saying, *\"This belt is exquisite.\"* Wang replied, *\"If I wear it myself, bearing its weight, and others say it is fine—is that not wearisome?\"* Thus, throughout his life, he wore only the belt bestowed upon him.\n\nWhen Lü Wenjing was chief minister, his son-in-law sought to sell an ancient mirror, saying, *\"This mirror can illuminate two hundred *li* beyond.\"* Lü replied, *\"My face is no larger than a plate—why would I need to see two hundred *li*?\"*\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*Zilu’s coarse hemp, disdaining fox-fur.*\n*Alchemizing copper into gold—Lü Dongbin scorned the craft.*\n*Simplicity in poverty and lowliness—*\n*The noble man delights in such things.*\n*Purple usurps vermilion,*\n*Zheng music disrupts proper harmony.*\n*The cunning of thieves and burglars*\n*Never stoop in shame.*\n*To abandon the public for the private—*\n\n**Record:**\n*\"Forget the state for the sake of the family, forget the self for the sake of the lord, forget the private for the sake of the public—such is the duty of a minister.\"* How can one abandon the public for the private? If one does so, right may be twisted into wrong, the worthy into the unworthy, and the affairs of state will swiftly fall into chaos. Thus, the noble man dares not act thus.\n\nMinister Zhao Kangjing, in his early years, served in the Hanlin Academy alongside Ouyang Wenzhong. Kangjing was grave and reticent, and Wenzhong somewhat slighted him. Later, when Wenzhong was implicated in a scandal involving his nephew’s misconduct, the emperor’s wrath was severe, and the case pressed urgently. The two chief ministers sought to fabricate charges against him, and none among the officials dared speak.\n\nKangjing alone submitted a memorial with solemn resolve, saying: *\"Ouyang Xiu has long been esteemed for his literary attainments; I cannot, on account of vague and sordid matters within his private chambers, lightly cast aspersions upon him. Though my relations with Xiu have always been distant, and his treatment of me likewise indifferent, what I cherish is the greater principle of the court.\"*\n\nSome later remarked to Kangjing: *\"Did you not bear a grudge against Lord Ouyang?\"* He replied: *\"To abandon the public for the private is a course I cannot abide—how could I dare act thus?\"*\n\nDuring the Zhihe era, Zhao Bian served as censor, and Fan Gongzhen as a remembrancer. When they clashed over the case of Chen Gonggong, resentment arose between them. In the Xining era, Wang Jiefu held power and, resenting Jingren for repeatedly denouncing him before the emperor, sought to exploit an opportunity to frame him. One day, the emperor questioned Jiefu about Jingren. Jiefu replied: *\"Ask Zhao Bian, and you will know his character.\"* When the emperor inquired of Zhao Bian, he answered: *\"A loyal minister.\"* The emperor asked: *\"How do you know him to be loyal?\"* Bian replied: *\"During the Jiayou era, when Emperor Renzong fell gravely ill, Gongzhen was the first to petition for the establishment of an imperial heir, securing the altars of the state—was this not the act of a loyal minister?\"*\n\nAfterward, Jiefu reproached him sharply: *\"Did you not bear a grudge against him?\"* Bian replied: *\"How could I dare abandon the public for the private? My willingness to speak plainly without concealment arises from placing the state before personal enmity. These two gentlemen may truly be called those who forget the private for the sake of the public.\"*\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen the public prevails, principle triumphs; when the private speaks, profit is invoked. Once the desire for gain stirs, the heavenly principle fades into oblivion. At the extreme of dissipation, thieves and bandits arise in rebellion. It begins with the self, then twists and turns toward bias and partiality. To cloak private ends in the guise of the public—this is yet more egregious.\n\n*Here ends Scroll Thirteen of the* **Taishang Ganying Pian** *(*The Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response*).*\n*Scroll Fourteen of the* **Taishang Ganying Pian** *begins.*\n\n**The Biography of Li Changling, with Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nTo appropriate another’s abilities—this is theft.\n\nThe *Tradition* states: When the Venerable Kāśyapa crossed the river, he suddenly heard the Lotus Fragrance River Spirit reproach him, saying, “Noble One, you are an Arhat—why do you steal my fragrance?” Kāśyapa replied, “The scent came to my nose of its own accord—how can this be called theft?”\n\nI have pondered these words thrice and found them deeply significant. Generally speaking, the scent-dust exists as it is; it is only through my nasal faculty that the perception of smell arises, distinguishing it as fragrance. Yet according to the Buddha’s teaching, this is already called theft.\n\nKnow then that to seize another’s abilities and claim them as one’s own is true theft.\n\nConsider the case of Gao Ling: in his later years, though he held the post of Libationer, his Dao and qi failed to commune, and his spirit lacked a master. Thus, a host of malevolent forces assailed him, hastening his misfortune. The Perfected Lord of Life Protection said to Director Xu: “Gao Ling’s lack of virtue has endured for long; the entanglements of ghostly litigation have accumulated. Moreover, he once defaced the steles and inscriptions of ancients, passing them off as his own work. The Water Official condemned him for obscuring goodness to aggrandize himself, secretly injuring spirits and deities. Thus, his case was placed at the forefront of the docket to be reported—his guilt was inescapable.” Soon after, he indeed perished.\n\nCan the abilities of others truly be stolen?\n\nHave you not heard of the case of Shi Manqing? Years after his death, he appeared in a dream to his friend Guan Yong, saying: “In my lifetime, I composed many poems, but of all of them, I took greatest pride in *Substituting Yangping for Intent*—its words and meaning were profound and beautiful. Yet though the world praises it, only you can ensure this poem spreads widely.” Guan awoke with the lines of *Hidden Measures of the Daoist Adept* and *The Immortal’s Invitation* expanding in his mind, and he set them to song. Later, he dreamed again, and Manqing came to express his gratitude.\n\nAlas! Even for a poem left uncelebrated, one must plead for its recognition—how much worse, then, to steal another’s ability and claim it as one’s own?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nSeeing the worthy, one strives to emulate;\nSeeing the sagely, one follows their path.\nWhen myriad virtues are complete,\nIt lies in man to seek them within.\nTo think oneself inferior to Shun\nIs cause for self-reproach.\nHow can one of sheep-like nature\nBear the guise of a mighty beast?\nTo deceive others is to deceive oneself—\nA shame most profound.\nTo obscure another’s goodness…\n\nAs the saying goes: Since ancient times, those whose skills won them fame in later ages never did so without relying on others. Consider Yuan Ying of the Prince of Teng’s mastery of butterfly painting, Madam Gongsun’s sword dance, Cao Gang’s pipa, or Mi Jiarong’s singing—these were but incidental mentions in palace lyrics or verses by Tang poets. Yet even the slightest talent is a form of goodness. To leave it unrecognized is to suppress it.\n\nHave you not heard of the affair of Lord Xu, the Perfected Duke? In his mortal days, Xu the Perfected once renovated a Daoist abbey and wished to record the event. Chancing upon an ancient stele whose inscription had worn away, he scraped off the old text and engraved his own account. Thereafter, he grew restless and unsettled. One day, as he strolled through the courtyard, he suddenly heard a voice from the void: “Lord Xu, Lord Xu, hasten to the Water Official to seek deliverance! Else, unforeseen calamity may befall you.” Startled, Xu lit incense and prayed devoutly, wishing to learn the reason for his peril. After a long while, the voice spoke again: “Though the old stele’s text was effaced, its original author has lodged a complaint with the Water Official, accusing you of usurping his name to exalt your own. Thus, the Water Official is preparing to summon you for judgment—you must act swiftly.” Xu then sought out the original inscription and had it carved anew on a separate stone. That night, he dreamed of a spirit who thanked him, saying: “Since you have restored my name, I can offer no repayment but to request a grand Water and Land Ritual, proclaiming it to the myriad spirits, that the Three Officials may record your merit and aid your attainment of the Dao.” Xu followed the instructions, and later indeed achieved the Way.\n\nWhen Caizhou was pacified, Emperor Xianzong ordered Daoists to perform a ritual at the Purple Ultimate Abbey. The abbey had once been a shrine to Wu Shaocheng, but Pei the Duke of Jin had repurposed it as a Daoist sanctuary. On the day of the ritual, a great thunderclap resounded. The stele bearing Han Hong’s *Inscription on the Pacification of Huaixi* had originally been Wu Shaocheng’s *Stele of Virtuous Governance*. That day, it wept beads of sweat that turned to mud. Within ten days, an imperial envoy arrived to grind away Han’s inscription on the pacification of Huai and restore Shaocheng’s text on virtuous governance. Such transformations, though glimpsed in dreams, are not without consequence.\n\nAlas! If even the written word is thus, how much more so for goodness greater than mere text?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe sin of suppressing the worthy\nIs called inauspicious.\nTrace it to its origin—\nEnvy of another’s excellence.\nJade glistens within wood,\nPearls gleam in the night.\nAll things possess inherent worth,\nYet how can they be concealed?\nTo stifle ability and bury goodness\nIs to seek obscurity yet achieve renown.\nTo expose another’s shame…\n\nAs the saying goes: “Shame” refers to the shame of ugliness; “expose” means to lay bare. Consider Nie Chongyi’s love of mockery or Zhang Qiyi’s talent for slander. Chongyi, though skilled in poetry, delighted in ridicule, sparing not even colleagues. Ultimately, he was exiled to Dengzhou for slandering governance, his corpse left by the roadside, unclaimed by any who passed. Zhang Qiyi, also a poet fond of mockery, would expose others’ misdeeds in verse, ensuring their infamy spread unchecked. Some of his accusations were exaggerated, even to the point of breaking marriages and severing bonds. In the end, he contracted a loathsome illness and died chewing his own tongue.\n\nCan one’s shame truly be exposed?\n\nOne would do well to heed the tale of Huangkeng, for had they heard it, they would surely take warning. A military officer named Duan Gou once passed through Huangkeng. His attendant, walking ahead of the horse, picked up several pounds of skull fragments. Among them was a piece bearing faint traces of the words “runaway slave”—the ink had seeped into the bone. That night, the attendant dreamed of a man covering his face with his hands, pleading for the bones: “I am deeply ashamed. I beg you, bury them deeply where no one may see. I will repay your kindness.” The attendant awoke in alarm and immediately interred the remains. When he later passed through Huangkeng again, he dreamed of the same man, who said: “In gratitude for your mercy, a few steps from here lies buried treasure—let it be my thanks.” Following the instructions, he dug and uncovered wealth worth over ten thousand coins.\n\nThus, to expose another’s shame—who can say what retribution may come in days to come?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nA beauty like Wang Zhaojun was misrepresented by a painter’s error—how much more so when it comes to profit! To surpass even the crimson emaciation of a consumptive: such is the art of depiction, refined through meticulous imitation. Once the crowd has clamored and spread the tale, it can never be washed clean. With but a few words of mine, I plunge another into grave wrong. To expose another’s secrets—Confucius said: “To expose is not merely to depict; it is to attack outright,” as did men like Lü Jifu.\n\nWhen Zeng Zixuan served as Minister of Revenue, Lü Jifu succeeded him and immediately petitioned the throne, claiming the ministry’s affairs were incomplete or improperly managed. When Zhang Cuiming held the same post, Shu Dan replaced him and, having gathered all the clerks, declared the ministry’s business unresolved. Zhou Shihou, as Transport Commissioner of Hubei, entrusted several dozen bottles of tribute wine to the Salt Supervisor Zhang Shangying for sale. Shangying reported this to Inspector Pu Zongmeng, who impeached Zhou, leading to his demotion. Later, when Zhang Shangying held a court appointment, he asked Examination Supervisor Shu Dan to recommend a candidate. Dan submitted a memorial denouncing Shangying’s negligence, and Shangying was likewise stripped of office. Did they not know Confucius’ disciple Zigong’s warning that those who expose others’ faults under the guise of honesty are detestable? Would a man of profound virtue ever act thus?\n\nWhen Han Weigong Qi served as Chancellor, whenever he encountered documents attacking another’s hidden faults, he would personally seal them to prevent others from seeing. Chen Zhongsuxuan Guan, while serving as a censor, spoke out on every matter, yet his impeachments never touched on personal affairs. Prime Minister Su Fan, during his tenure in Hangzhou, was approached by an influential figure with a private request, which he refused. Later, when that man became a censor, he unleashed a torrent of slander against Su. Advisors urged Su to present the original letters of solicitation as evidence, but he only smiled and said: “To expose another’s secrets—would I ever do such a thing?”\n\nMagistrate Hu Suxiao governed Runzhou. His predecessor, Governor Teng, had vigorously promoted education, spending millions of cash. Before the project was completed, Teng was dismissed, and petty officials began spreading slander, accusing him of misusing funds. From the vice-magistrate downward, none would sign the accounts. Hu addressed them in assembly: “Gentlemen, how long have you served under Governor Teng? If there were any impropriety, why did you not speak up sooner, instead of silently observing and only now recording it after his departure? Is this honorable?” The entire assembly hung their heads in shame and signed the ledgers. To act with such magnanimity is as distant from pettiness as heaven is from earth.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo expose differs from forthrightness—even the sages despised it.\nIt is treacherous and cunning, striking at flaws when opportunity arises.\nSwearing oaths to heaven, laughing and clasping hands in feigned friendship—\nYet when slight harm touches them, they turn and bare their fangs.\nNeither rhinoceros nor tiger, what manner of man is this?\nTo deplete another’s wealth—Confucius said: “To drain another’s wealth, leaving their household ruined and their descendants destitute—is this not a grievous sin?”\n\nConsider the case of Wen Qi. He wandered among the nobles of Shu, peddling his alchemical arts. All who took an interest in the furnace and flame were deceived by him. A wealthy merchant named Li the Fifteenth had amassed a fortune of ten thousand strings of cash. Enamored of Qi’s sorcery, within three years his wealth was utterly exhausted. The knowing laughed at him, and in despair, he hanged himself. Qi then fled, renting a house in Jianzhou where he forged elixirs. Soon, a fire broke out, engulfing an entire ward. Qi fled in panic, losing himself in the forest, where he was pursued by wild beasts. Deeper into the ravine he stumbled, only to be followed again. As dawn broke, he was captured by hunters. The case was tried, and he was beheaded at the site of his alchemical work, to appease the residents. If another’s wealth may not be depleted, may one’s own wealth be squandered?\n\nLet me recount another tale, that young men may take heed. Wang Zude died in Qinzhou in the yichou year of the Shaoxing reign. One evening, his wife and son were sitting in the hall when they dimly perceived Zude returning from outside. He reproached them: “I hear the family plans to sell the estate—how can you part with our ancestral home?” He continued: “The treasures of my lifetime—Huang Quan’s and Guo Xi’s landscapes, Li Cheng’s wintry forests—ten scrolls in all. I hear they too have been taken out for appraisal. I have been dead but a short time, and the family is not yet impoverished. Why such haste?” He sighed: “I long for home, yet have no way to return. By chance, it is the Ghost Festival, and I was able to come briefly. If you do not change your ways, I will bring disaster upon you.” His wife, terrified, abandoned the idea of selling. From this, we see: whether another’s wealth or one’s own, neither may be wasted.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe drought demon starves the poor; the poverty ghost resents the rich.\nAs omens and calamities, their logic defies reason.\nHuman nature is most noble—kin, clan, and friends.\nWhat heart could envy what others possess?\nLord Liu loved wealth, yet enriched his people.\nTo sunder another’s flesh and blood—Confucius said: “Flesh and blood are bound by kinship, the great human relationships. How can they be severed?”\n\nHave you not heard the tale of Zhang Songshan? Long ago, Zhang Xiaoji was the son-in-law of a wealthy man from the same commandery. The rich man had only one son, who committed a minor offense. The household, united in resentment, drove him out. Soon after, the rich man fell ill. On his deathbed, he entrusted all his wealth to Xiaoji. Years later, Xiaoji encountered the rich man’s son begging by the road. He called him over and asked: “Can you tend a garden?” The son replied: “To be fed and sheltered would be my greatest fortune.” Later, when the son had proven himself, Xiaoji asked: “Can you manage the accounts?” The son answered: “To tend a garden was already my good fortune—if I could manage the accounts, it would be even more so.” Thus, Xiaoji entrusted him with the ledgers. Over time, the son grew ever more diligent and respectful, his former faults erased. Xiaoji reflected: “He is truly his father’s son. How can I profit from his wealth alone, letting this noble deed pass unfulfilled?”\n\nThus, Xiaoji returned all the family wealth to the son. At the time, none who heard of it failed to praise and marvel, deeming it unheard of since ancient days. After Xiaoji’s death, several of his friends traveled to Mount Song. Along the way, they encountered a nobleman, his banners filling the fields, his retinue of attendants and outriders streaming in procession—like a regional governor newly assuming office. Glancing at the occupant of the grand carriage, they saw it was Xiaoji. They stepped forward to bow and asked how he had come to attain such a state. Xiaoji replied: “It was because of the matter of returning the wealth.” Before he could finish speaking, he suddenly vanished.\n\nAlas! How many sons-in-law in the world are like Xiaoji? How many others in his place would have done the same? Long ago in Hangzhou, there was a scholar who also married into a wealthy family. When the rich man fell ill and neared death, mindful that his son was only three years old, he entrusted his son-in-law with his assets and left a will stating: “When the time comes to divide the property, give three-tenths to my son and seven-tenths to my son-in-law.” When the son grew up, he took the matter to court. At the time, Zhang Zhongding was the prefect. After reading the will, he poured a libation of wine upon the ground and said: “Your father-in-law was truly a wise man. Because his son was young, he devised this plan to ensure you would diligently raise and protect him. Had he not done so, your hands would not have spared the child’s life.” He then ordered that seven-tenths go to the son and three-tenths to the son-in-law. Both departed in tears, expressing their gratitude.\n\nAh! If one were to compare this son-in-law to Xiaoji of Mount Song, the very ground beneath Mount Song would already lie far beyond the heavens—how could he not become an immortal? If one were to seek such a man among others, even this son-in-law, though humbled, still understood righteousness. How much better is he than those who are cruel, unfeeling, and unworthy of trust? Yet his aspiration to Mount Song remains as distant as the sky.\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nOf old, there was the Great Ancestor who ordered the ranks of ancestral temples. The teachings of the Zhou classics also united the clan. Later generations gathered in righteousness, valuing kinship and harmony. Even a sage like the Duke of Zhou was slandered by the two uncles. The venomous tongues of flatterers wrought bitter poison.\n\n*End of Scroll Fourteen of the Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response*\n*Scroll Fifteen of the Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response*\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nTo encroach upon what others cherish.\n\nIt is said: When the Perfected Lord Xu was in the world, he once exterminated a serpent spirit in Nanchang. His Daoist companions who wished to follow him numbered no fewer than a thousand. The Perfected Lord selected only three hundred whom he knew well and set out with them. Later, they lodged for the night at the foot of a mountain. Fearing that their cultivation lacked strength, he took three hundred lumps of charcoal from the fire and transformed them into three hundred beauties to test them. At dawn, when he examined them, only Wu Meng and Shi Daoyi had no charcoal stains on their robes. The remaining two hundred and ninety-eight had all embraced the charcoal. At the moment of embrace, did they not each see a beautiful woman? How could they have known it was merely a lump of charcoal? For the most part, their desires had not yet been severed, and so they were easily deceived—how much more so for those who do not cultivate at all?\n\nIn former times, Tao Gu was sent as an envoy to Jiangnan. Though his bearing was lofty and his demeanor stern, even in casual conversation, he never relaxed his guard. Han Xizai said to his confidant: “I observe that this man is no true gentleman. His resolve can be broken. I shall make the court laugh at him.” He then selected a famous courtesan, Qin Ruolan, dressed her in ragged clothes, and had her pretend to be the daughter of a courier station attendant. Morning and night, she swept the courtyard with a broom. Ruolan was of unmatched beauty, and Tao was moved by her. He abandoned his vigilance in solitude and composed several *Youting* poems, which he had Ruolan sing. A few days later, the King of Li held a grand feast and poured wine for the envoy from a massive goblet. Tao remained as stern and unyielding as before. Then Ruolan was brought out to sing the poems he had gifted her as entertainment. Tao was deeply ashamed and ended up drunk, vomiting upon the mats. From then on, the King of Li treated him coldly. Upon his return, the court already knew of the affair and never employed him again.\n\nWhen Wen Lugong was in Shu, he often held feasts and gatherings, and rumors spread. Coincidentally, the imperial censor He Shengcong, whose given name was Tan, returned to Shu on leave. Wen tasked him with secretly investigating the matter. As He was about to cross the border, Wen arranged a grand reception for him. Zhang Shaoyu, whose given name was Yu, said to Wen: “He Shengcong’s arrival is nothing to fear. When he previously served as prefect of Hanzhou, there was a gathering of fellow townsmen. A courtesan skilled in dance caught his eye. He asked her surname, and she replied, ‘Your servant is surnamed Yang.’ He Shengcong said, ‘So you are the famed Willow of Yang Terrace.’” Shaoyu then took her scarf and inscribed a poem upon it:\n\n*A beauty of Shu is called Slender Waist,*\n*The Eastern Terrace censor cherishes her fiery grace.*\n*From now on, call her Willow of Yang Terrace,*\n*Dancing away ten thousand strands of spring wind.*\n\nHe had the courtesan sing it as a *zhuzhi* poem. He Shengcong became thoroughly drunk, which revealed his true nature. Wen said, “Keep this secret for now.” When He Shengcong arrived, he indeed conducted himself with strict dignity. Wen held a banquet for him and had the courtesan mingle among the official entertainers, singing Shaoyu’s poem as entertainment. He Shengcong became drunk once more. The affair soon spread, reaching the emperor’s ears. Upon his return, he was never again granted an audience. Thus, the slander against Wen Lugong was silenced.\n\nAlas! Tao Gu had no self-restraint, and He Shengcong, though known for his integrity, how could he have acted thus? For the most part, when words take shape, the heart has already been moved. Is this not because desires remain unsevered, illusory forms are mistaken for reality, and love and attachment arise from within?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nPeople cherish themselves more than jade,\nAnd love their children as they love themselves.\nExtending this love to others,\nNone should be treated otherwise.\nWhy then do they cruelly plunder,\nIndulging in predation?\nA beauty and a gem nearly overturned Han’s chariot.\n\n**To aid others in wrongdoing.**\n\nIt is said: One version reads: *To teach others in wrongdoing.* For the most part, this is about encouraging others’ vices and failing to guide them toward goodness. Have you not heard the Buddha’s words? The Buddha said: To expound the Dharma and teach others is called the gift of Dharma, enabling beings to awaken through hearing the Way. For this cause, in future lives, seven rewards are obtained:\n\n1. When beings hear the Dharma and instantly dispel anger, in my future lives, I shall attain a sublime form.\n2. When beings hear the Dharma and cultivate compassion, refraining from killing, in my future lives, I shall enjoy long life.\n3. When beings hear the Dharma and do not steal others’ wealth, in my future lives, I shall abound in treasures.\n4. When beings hear the Dharma and open their hearts to joyful giving, in my future lives, I shall gain great strength.\n5. When beings hear the Dharma and instantly cast off delusion, in my future lives, I shall attain unobstructed eloquence.\n6. When beings hear the Dharma and hold firm in faith, free from doubt, in my future lives, my faith shall be clear and bright.\n7. When beings hear the Dharma and skillfully follow its guidance, in my future lives, I shall attain the bodhi path.\n\nThus, guiding others toward goodness—how is this not far better than aiding them in wrongdoing? Let me present examples for each, that all may take heed.\n\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, Li Zhichun served three terms as transport commissioner of Chengdu. He was benevolent toward the people and cherished all things, and the people of Shu lived in peace. Beyond his official duties, he paid particular attention to burying the exposed bones of the dead. A minor official, Xu Xi, originally from Mei, was well-versed in doing good. Li entrusted him with this task, and Xu took it upon himself with dedication. One day, a man named Wang Bin from Jinhua Street in the western market fell ill and entered the netherworld. He saw several officials in crimson and purple robes gathered in a hall. They summoned Xu Xi before them and said: “A celestial decree has just arrived. Li Zhichun, for his merit in burying dry bones, shall be granted another term as prefect of Chengdu.”\n\nThe officials declared, “As you have diligently managed the documents, we grant you a son who shall pass the imperial examination.” They continued, “Since you are sincere and trustworthy, you may return and proclaim this, that all may be encouraged.” In the third year of the Yuanyou era, Li Zhichun was indeed promoted to Academician of the Baowen Pavilion and appointed prefect of Chengdu. Xu Xi had a son named Xu Shi, who also passed the imperial examination that year under the Li Changning roster. This is an example of one who aided others in virtue and likewise received its reward.\n\nDuring the Zhenghe era, an edict was issued to extensively renovate the Western Palace. At the time, Wang Ju served as transport commissioner, but was dismissed for imposing excessive levies. The court then summoned Song Sheng of Huixu to serve as chief transport commissioner and oversee the project. Sheng’s intentions were overly exacting: he demanded vast quantities of ox-bone ash to plaster the palace walls, insisting they be made lustrous and smooth. However, his orders were too harsh, driving the people to slaughter oxen and horses, or even exhume graves to obtain bones—yet still, it was not enough.\n\nAt the time, Sun Kuang and Han Rong were both members of the staff. Kuang disapproved of the project and resigned on grounds of illness. Rong alone proposed a solution, suggesting they excavate over a dozen cluster graves from the Five Dynasties period outside the city to meet the demand.\n\nDuring the Xuanhe era, Kuang suddenly died and found himself at Mount Tai. There, he saw a gate bearing a placard that read “Pure and Peaceful.” An underworld official brandished an iron fork, compelling him to sign a confession of clan extermination. Kuang replied, “When I first opposed this matter, I did so precisely to avoid such an error.”\n\nSuddenly, several ghosts dragged forth two prisoners, both weighed down by massive wooden cangues and iron shackles. Beside each walked another ghost, wielding iron fans studded with nails to strike them, so that blood streamed down their bodies. Looking closely, Kuang saw they were Zhu and Sheng. One of them finally confessed.\n\nAs Kuang was about to leave, Rong was also brought in. The underworld official again brandished his iron fork, compelling him to sign a confession of clan extermination. Rong said, “I am indeed guilty, but what crime have my father and ancestors committed? If my entire clan is to be wiped out, is this not excessive?” Soon, a voice from the hall above declared, “Let him confess only to the extinction of his immediate family.” Kuang relayed this. Before long, every member of Rong’s household indeed perished.\n\nThis was a case of aiding another’s wrongdoing and immediately reaping the consequences. Yet if aiding another’s wrongdoing brings such retribution, is it ever worth doing?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHe who aids in brewing wine tastes the dregs;\nHe who aids a state in turmoil suffers the wound.\nGood and evil follow their kind—\nSuch is the constant way of human affairs.\nTo abet the mighty in tyranny\nIs to share in their ruin.\nHolding firewood to feed the flames,\nPouring boiling water to raise the steam—\nThe scorching disaster that follows\nIs as certain as a debt repaid.\nIndulging one’s will to wield power—\n\n**It is said:** In *The Six Regrets of Minister Kou* it is written:\nTo bend office for private ends brings regret when opportunity is lost;\nTo spend wealth without restraint brings regret when poverty comes;\nTo neglect learning in one’s youth brings regret when the chance has passed;\nTo ignore affairs when they arise brings regret when the need arises;\nTo speak wildly in drunkenness brings regret when sober;\nTo fail to rest when at ease brings regret when illness strikes.\nThese words of Minister Kou are truly the great principle for avoiding regret.\nI cherish his wisdom, and so I quote it here as a warning to those who indulge their will to wield power.\nWill they not regret it afterward?\n\nLong ago, He Jia, serving as *Lu Shi Can Jun* and overseeing the Ever-Normal Granary of Zizhou Circuit, was tyrannical wherever he went, beating and flogging officials and commoners to establish his authority. The local officials and people, cowering in fear, hid with nowhere to turn, even to the point of insulting his superiors, placing himself above them. Whenever he issued orders to prefectures and counties, he would insist, “Without official authorization, no directive from the transport commissioner’s office may be carried out.” When Vice-Commissioner Li Song and Judge Chen Gang discussed matters with him and disagreed, he would berate and curse them. When the prefect came to report, He Jia would force him to dismount outside the gate and proceed along the corridor, often not rising from his seat even when the prefect drew near.\n\nHe also sought to abolish Guang’an Prefecture. The consensus held that since it lay far from other commanderies, it could not be abolished. A local official named Zhang Pifang obtained a *Record of the Drum and Horn Tower* written by He Jia’s father, Academician He She, which explicitly stated the reasons it should not be abolished, and presented it to him. He Jia replied, “All matters should follow public consensus—this is hardly sufficient evidence.” Li Song and others then memorialized his conduct, and an imperial edict removed him from office.\n\nAfter his dismissal, someone along the way memorialized Li Song and the others, accusing them of every conceivable offense. When He Jia reached the capital and was handed over to the Kaifeng Prefecture for interrogation, he demanded ten thousand sheets of paper to submit his defense. The prefectural authorities provided the exact number. Yet when he submitted his response, each sheet bore only a single large character, filling the page. The court found four instances of falsehood, all of which were baseless and absurd. The case was concluded, and he was stripped of his rank.\n\nAt that moment, did He Jia not regret his actions?\nHow lamentable that he never understood:\nTo indulge one’s will and wield power\nIs something Heaven does not permit.\n\nIn days past, when Du Xunhe had yet to rise to prominence, he dreamed of a monk who warned him: \"You shall surely gain the ruler’s favor, but if you indulge your will and wield power wantonly, you will surely die.\" Later, when the Liang Ancestor founded his dynasty, Xunhe, relying on imperial favor, grew violent and overbearing, even plotting to murder those he had long disliked. Before he could carry out his scheme, he suddenly dreamed of a spirit rebuking him: \"Have you forgotten the divine monk’s words?\" Soon after, the emperor was about to punish him—yet before the sentence was carried out, he died.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe auspiciousness of wielding power\nLies in turning inward.\nTo possess awe-inspiring authority,\nOne must follow proper conduct.\nSolemn in bearing, one naturally commands respect.\nSeverity should be directed at oneself,\nNot used to oppress the people.\n\"Act not with tyranny\"—\nThus the Book admonishes your ministers.\nTo humiliate others in pursuit of victory—\n\nAs the scriptures record: In the Buddha’s time, there was a man who made his living by hauling goods with carts, keeping two oxen. One ox bore a calf with long, broad horns, which he named Longhorn. The other bore a calf with a bald head and no horns, which he named Baldhead. One day, while hauling goods, he encountered another carter. Each boasted of his ox’s strength, and they agreed to wager on which could ascend a steep slope. Baldhead, however, lagged behind. Enraged, his master cursed him: \"Baldheaded beast, why do you not hurry?\" Baldhead’s eyes reddened with fury, and he slowed even more, ensuring his master’s defeat. For he resented the public humiliation.\n\nAlas! Even beasts behave thus—how much more so men? Know then that to humiliate others in pursuit of victory is truly unacceptable.\n\nLong ago, when Prince Shao of Shaoling, Lun, governed Ying, Wu ( ) served as his retainer. When Zhang Zuan was appointed to govern Xiangdong, Lun held a farewell banquet for him in the suburbs, and ( ) was also in attendance. At the time, Zuan was newly exalted and looked down upon ( ). Suddenly, he raised his cup and toasted ( ), saying: \"Wu ( ), rejoice! Today you are honored to attend this feast.\" ( ) flew into a rage and immediately left. His son, Lunru, heard of this and was so overcome with indignation that he died. ( ) mourned his son and resented Zuan, soon falling ill and passing away himself. His wife, unable to bear the fury, perished shortly after. The people of the time remarked: \"Zhang Zuan’s single cup of wine killed three of the Wu family.\"\n\nCan men truly be humiliated?\n\nIn Wuyuan County, Huizhou, there lived a man named Yu Yanfu. All his life, he was hot-tempered and domineering, bullying his neighbors. Whenever he coveted another’s land or house, he would use schemes to seize it. Even in old age, he showed no remorse. In the *renxu* year of the Shaoxing era, he suddenly fell gravely ill. As he lay stricken, he repeatedly neighed like a horse.\n\nAfter a long while, his hands and feet transformed into hooves, and within days, he died.\n\nWho would claim that humiliating others to seek victory brings no harm?\n\nAlas for those with mistaken views—knowing only that overpowering others is strength, yet unaware that true strength lies in overcoming oneself. Have they never heard Laozi’s words: *\"To overcome others is to have force; to overcome oneself is to be strong\"*?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen some suffer humiliation,\nthey roll up their sleeves, glaring in fury.\nIf not cowed by might,\nthen crushed by power.\nThough rage chokes their words,\nthey are held in check—\nbut once might fades and power wanes,\nnone fail to bite back.\nEven one who can best me\nstrikes fear into Yu’s heart.\n\nTo ruin another’s crops—\nas the saying goes, such acts are the work of boorish rustics,\nhardly worth mention.\n\nLet me instead speak of the fine deeds of those who toiled in agriculture, revered grain,\nand studied waterworks—\nthat later governors may take them as models.\n\nGao, the Grand Master for Consultation, governed Tang Prefecture. The land was vast, the people few. From the Five Dynasties to our present dynasty, it had four counties and six thousand one hundred fifty-five households. Upon arrival, he surveyed the fields and plains, recognizing that the uncultivated land could be tilled—if only for want of labor. Thus, he recruited great numbers of migrants from the Two Rivers, allotting fields by household. The population grew by eleven thousand three hundred eighty-one, and the land granted totaled thirty-one thousand three hundred twenty-eight *qing*. Even the wilds of mountains and forests were transformed into fertile fields.\n\nScholar Zhang Lun, Vice Commissioner of the Jiang-Huai Transport Bureau, dredged five canals to channel Lake Tai, irrigating the people’s fields. The annual tax exemption in grain amounted to six hundred thousand *hu*.\n\nXu, Minister of the Court of Imperial Sacrifices, governed Xingyuan and restored the great mountain rivers and weirs, irrigating over forty thousand *qing* of farmland.\n\nLu Kaichu, Prefect of Queshan in Jizhou, revived abandoned reservoirs to water thousands of *qing* of fields.\n\nCheng Shimeng, Compiler of the Academy, governed Shizhou. Wherever the valleys of Fen and Jin held water to irrigate farmland, he surveyed the terrain, channeling streams into canals. The reclaimed fields totaled over one thousand *qing*.\n\nMinister Xu Gui governed Danyang. During a severe drought, he defied the prohibition and breached Lian Lake to save the people’s fields, yielding a bumper harvest of over ten thousand *qing*. Breaching Lian Lake was a capital offense.\n\nCounselor Chen Shenghua governed Liyang County. The Zheng-Bai Canal, which could draw water to irrigate farmland, had long been monopolized by neighboring jurisdictions. Upon arrival, he presented the full history to the authorities, and at once, the long-standing obstruction was removed. The restored waterworks irrigated over one thousand *qing* of fields.\n\nChief Justice Wang Ji governed Longxi County. A reservoir stretched for dozens of *li*, its taxes paid by great clans who alone reaped its benefits. Upon arrival, he seized it entirely to irrigate the people’s fields, sparing the county from drought and famine.\n\nMarshal Miao Shizhong governed Ningling County. An ancient river, long silted and abandoned, lay there. Upon arrival, he petitioned for laborers to dredge it, irrigating the people’s fields. Thus, the entire county’s land became fertile.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nTo seize grain without sowing—*The Book of Songs* satirizes such rulers. The earth yields no sustenance, and so the ancients buried their dead within it. Who robs the farmer of his season leaves the people without store. Who flays the people’s strength denies them their nurture. Harm those who nurture, and Heaven will surely send down ruin.\n\nTo sunder another’s marriage—*The Tradition* says, *The Record of Rites* declares: Only with husband and wife does father and son arise. Thus the Way of marriage may be called great; how can it be sundered? Whether severed before union or after, it is still a severing. Love’s murder cuts deeper than the blade; who would call it harmless?\n\nIn his youth, Zheng Hezhong was betrothed to a woman of the Wang clan. Soon after, his father died, and his family’s fortunes waned. The Wangs then sought to break the engagement. Her brother, Wang Gu, serving as judicial commissioner of Wanzhou, controlled the matter. Yet pressed by public opinion, he reluctantly allowed the marriage to proceed. A son was born but did not survive, and so Hezhong was kept apart, never permitted to return. The Wangs sent him clothing, but Gu punished the bearers. Hezhong grew ever more bitter, fell ill in heart, and died.\n\nOne night, the Wang woman dreamed Hezhong appeared to her, saying: “I have lodged my complaint in the courts of the unseen. I have been sent to the Eastern Peak of Quzhou, where my case is being investigated.” By then, she had remarried to Lu Song, then serving as instructor in Jizhou. Within a month, Gu died, and all who had taken part in the decision to break the engagement perished. Only the Wang woman, who had never intended to betray her husband, survived alone.\n\nLater, Wang Gu’s son married a woman of the Xu clan. After barely two years, her family reclaimed her. Was this not retribution?\n\nAssistant Magistrate Yang Hong, enraged that his son-in-law Yao Gong was unlearned and inept, sent him away. Gong begged to bid his wife farewell, but was refused. The daughter, consumed by grief, fell ill and died. Her coffin was interred in a monastic hall. When Gong arrived, the hall’s door locks sprang open of their own accord, and the coffin’s lid lifted. Her mother, hearing of this, was overcome with sorrow and died within days. Over a decade later, Yang Hong himself dropped dead at the coffin’s side.\n\nCan the sundering of marriage ever be justified?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Qi lord spurned the maiden’s hand and so lost his state. Zizhe’s betrothal nearly drowned him in lust. The great bond of husband and wife is matched by virtue. Who disrupts its fulfillment sows the seeds of treachery. A lineage of a hundred generations falls to a single malicious word.\n\n*Here ends Scroll Fifteen of the* Supreme Scripture of Stimulus and Response.\n*Supreme Scripture of Stimulus and Response, Scroll Sixteen.*\n\n**The Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nThose who attain wealth and grow arrogant—\nThe tradition warns: gazing at the sky from the bottom of a well, they belittle all things; dwelling in idleness without discipline, they indulge their own complacency.\nBefore the horse’s hooves, they flaunt the skill of Yan Ying; from their lofty perch, they brandish the arms of a mantis.\nAtop the towering pavilion, they fuss over the trifling fame of grinding ink; by the Cai River’s edge, they vie for the softest morsels at the feast.\nSuch are the ways of those who, having gained wealth by chance, become haughty.\nYet if you yourself choose arrogance, who will admire it?\nAlas that they do not awaken—if today you are wealthy and proud, then tomorrow you shall bear the guilt of wealth and pride. The Supreme Lord has made this warning clear; how could it be otherwise?\nHave you not heard Laozi’s words: “Wealth and honor breed arrogance, and bring misfortune upon oneself”?\nConfucius said: “Duke Jing of Qi owned a thousand teams of horses, yet on the day he died, the people found nothing to praise.” But Boyi and Shuqi starved beneath Mount Shouyang, and the people still extol them to this day.\nSuch is the fate of those who gain wealth by chance—those whose Way is full cannot be so easily measured.\nLong ago, when Master Fan Wenzheng had yet to rise to office, he studied with Master Liu on Changbai Mountain. Each day, they boiled two *sheng* of millet, waited for it to congeal, then cut it into four pieces, eating two at dawn and two at dusk. Later, both became ministers.\nHan Yi and Li Ruogu once traveled together to take the examinations, sharing a single quilt and a single felt mat. Whenever they went out, they took turns serving as each other’s attendants. Later, both became ministers.\nZhu Ang gathered paulownia seeds to read by; Kong Yanzhi split pine torches to read by. Later, both became imperial attendants.\nLi Xingjian, too poor to afford paper, gathered leaves to practice writing; Li Xuzhou, too poor to own books, constantly borrowed copies from others. Later, both became academicians.\nDu Yan, in his youth, was desperately poor. He traveled between Meng and Luo, copying texts to support himself. Later, he rose to the rank of chief of the Bureau of Military Affairs.\nWang Sui, in his youth, was so destitute that he once fled from a creditor demanding repayment for a meal. He was seized and taken before the authorities—yet later, he too became a minister.\nHow vast is the gulf between those whose Way is full and those who gain wealth by chance!\nConsider Shi Culai in his student days, studying in the southern capital. When Minister Wang Ji heard of his poverty, he sent a tray of food during a banquet. Shi refused it, saying: “Today is fine, but what of tomorrow?”\nWhen the young Hengpu was at school, he endured bitter cold with neither proper clothes nor bedding. A wealthy villager offered him a fur robe, but he declined, saying: “To be resolved in poverty is the very time to cultivate oneself. If one does not restrain oneself with discipline, desire will arise, shame will be lost—where then is the work of self-cultivation?”\nSuch was the resolve of these gentlemen.\nHow could those who gain wealth by chance ever be justified in their arrogance?\n\nA Eulogy states:\nWealth gained by chance forsakes righteousness and harms benevolence.\nScheming day and night, they flaunt their pride in broad daylight.\nBurglars strut with swagger, riding grand carriages and silken cushions.\nBoasting of their ill-gotten riches, they mock and ridicule the poor and upright.\nYet success and failure shift like the wind—west winds scatter dust on the granary.\nTo escape by any means, shameless—what manner of men are these?\n\nThe *Scripture* states: The Buddha said, “I possess two white laws that can save all sentient beings. What are these two white laws? The first is *shame (惭)*, the second is *remorse (愧)*. *Shame* is to refrain from committing sins oneself. *Remorse* is to prevent others from doing so. *Shame* is inner self-reproach. *Remorse* is to confess before others. *Shame* is to feel humiliated before others. *Remorse* is to feel humiliated before Heaven. Those without shame or remorse are called beasts.” This is the teaching of the *Nirvana Sutra*. It further states: “The robe of shame is the foremost adornment among all virtues. Shame is like an iron hook, restraining unlawful deeds. Without shame, one loses all virtue. If the heart holds shame and remorse, enmity and guilt both vanish.” This is the teaching of the *Sutra of Bequeathed Instructions*. Our Master Confucius also said: “Conduct oneself with shame.” The *Book of Rites* likewise states: “In the face of adversity, do not seek escape by any means.” Yet today, men seek escape by any means and remain utterly shameless—what kind of people are they?\n\nGenerally, shame must never leave a person, not even for a moment. Without shame, the shame of having no shame leads to every conceivable transgression—what more need be said?\n\nOnce, the monk Yuancheng was skilled in talismans and incantations. When Wang Cong’s infant son cried incessantly at night, Yuancheng uttered a single incantation, and the child fell silent. Cong deeply revered him and recommended him to Zhang Sheng, Duke Shen. At the time, Duke Shen was inspecting the northern and southern circuits of Jinghu, intending to pacify the river valleys and caves. Someone suggested that the barbarians practiced southern sorcery and feared talismans. When Duke Shen arrived in Chenzhou, he ordered Yuancheng, along with Zhang Yu, Li Ziming, and others, to enter Jiangnan to accept surrender. Upon reaching the caves, Yuancheng and his companions indulged their desires without restraint, even defiling the barbarian women. The chieftain Yuan Meng, enraged beyond endurance, impaled Zhang Yu and the others on pillars, tearing them apart. When Yuancheng’s turn came, he beat his cheeks and begged for mercy. Meng, a devout Buddhist, spared him. Yuancheng thus escaped unscathed. Upon his return, he was rewarded for his “labor in the caves” with the purple robe and the title of Master, styling himself the Grand Master of Investigation. He rode a grand horse, surrounded by attendants bearing maces and swords, utterly without shame. Did he possess shame? Where, then, were the “two white iron hooks” of his daily scripture recitations?\n\nFan Libo and Wang Kui, a retired official of the Bureau of Fields, were old friends from the same village. One day, Wang Kui composed a poem on the six *huo* (活) to critique current affairs. The provincial surveillance commissioner arrested Libo to coerce Kui. Libo, lacking principle, betrayed all of Kui’s past associations to save himself. As a result, Kui was convicted of slander, stripped of his rank, and exiled. Libo alone escaped punishment by informing and was soon promoted. His letter of appointment contained the phrase: “Is it not difficult to be your friend?” The judgment of contemporary moral discourse was thus evident. Yet Libo accepted his promotion with arrogance, utterly devoid of the shame of the threefold disgrace. Did he possess remorse? Where, then, were the teachings on shame from his days of study and self-conduct?\n\nA Eulogy states:\nSeeking survival by any means, shamelessly currying favor—\nAs a son, disloyal; as a minister, unfaithful.\nIn Han, Zhang Yu fell; in Jin, Jia Chong collapsed.\nFirst fearing loss, they ended in treachery and villainy.\nHow to punish such men? With the wind of Boyi.\nRecognizing favors, shifting blame.\n\nThe *Scripture* states: The Supreme One said: “To teach others to cultivate the heart is to cultivate the Dao. To teach others to cultivate the Dao is to cultivate the heart. Generally, the heart *is* the Dao. Before speaking of cultivating the Dao, first govern the heart. Thus, the ancients governed their hearts: when restless, they calmed it; when deviant, they corrected it; when grasping, they relinquished and restrained it; when turbid, they purified and clarified it. In action and stillness, in haste and leisure, over time, external things grew dim, while inner spirit shone clearly. Naturally, the heart’s ground became level, and the Dao was even and straight. The thought of recognizing favors and shifting blame would never arise.”\n\nOnce, Wang Wenzheng served as Chancellor. When Duke Lai sent someone to privately petition for the title of Chancellor-Envoy, Wenzheng was astonished: “The duties of general and minister—how can they be sought? Moreover, I do not accept private requests.” The Duke resented his words.\n\nLater, an edict was issued appointing Du [Zhong] as Military Commissioner of Wusheng Army and concurrent Grand Councilor. Du entered court, wept, and expressed his gratitude: “Had Your Majesty not known me, how could I have attained this?” The Emperor said: “This was Wang Dan’s recommendation.” Only then did Du feel shame and admiration, considering himself inferior.\n\nWhen Li Wenzheng served as Chancellor, if any scholar-official sought a post through private request, he would sternly refuse if he deemed the man unworthy. Yet once appointed, he would never speak of it again. His disciples asked: “Why not let them know?” He replied: “Employing the worthy is the ruler’s prerogative. If I were to inform them, it would be me currying favor and trading personal gratitude. Should the favor be claimed by me, who would bear the resentment? Would either of these two gentlemen [Wang Dan and Du] have claimed credit?”\n\nWhen Wei Renpu served as Chancellor under the Zhou, Emperor Shizong was narrow-minded and quick-tempered, harsh in punishment and execution. If any inner court official or close minister offended him, Renpu would invariably take the blame upon himself. Through his intercessions, seven or eight out of ten were spared. When Cao Wuhui first campaigned against Shu alongside Wang Quanbin, Quanbin slaughtered over three thousand surrendered soldiers. Wuhui remonstrated, but was ignored. Upon their return, the Emperor was furious and determined to investigate. Wuhui then falsely confessed, and Quanbin was thus spared. When Wuhui was later reappointed to campaign against Jiangnan, the Emperor admonished him: “This time, do not repeat what you did in Xichuan—recklessly slaughtering people.” Wuhui then truthfully replied, adding: “The reason I firmly took the blame before was to prevent Quanbin from bearing sole guilt.” Thereupon, the Emperor held him in even higher esteem. Would either of these two gentlemen [Wei Renpu and Cao Wuhui] have shifted blame?\n\nKnow that those who claim credit for favors and shift blame are merely unable to govern their minds, and thus cannot escape calamity that swiftly follows. How could one instruct them with the supreme teaching that cultivating the Dao is cultivating the mind?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nTo please others, one bestows favors—not for oneself.\nTo avoid slander, one bears blame—not for oneself.\nClaiming credit and shifting blame become a thicket of resentment and wrath.\nOne seizes the reputation for oneself—who then bears the fault?\nIce and fire lodge in the gut; even Bian Que would flee in alarm.\nSelling misfortune and peddling evil—\n\nAs the saying goes: The supreme teaching states, \"That which gives me life is spirit; that which destroys me is the heart.\" Now, to shift misfortune onto others only to have it return to oneself, to sell evil to others only to have it rebound—is this not self-destruction?\n\nIn the Qingli era, Yao Zi was serving as co-clerk of Tongcheng County in Shuzhou alongside Wang Hu. They were dispatched to Dayun Granary to measure and inspect tribute grain. Yao Zi accepted bribes of gold, silver, and valuables from the supervising officials, then falsely reported a deficit of over eight thousand *shi* of wheat. Wang Hu merely signed his name without knowledge of the matter. When the affair was exposed, they were sent to Shouzhou for investigation. Unwilling to bear the disgrace of corruption alone, Yao Zi took a gold ingot and five silver ingots he had originally received, coated them in lacquer, and bundled them with other items. He sent a trusted servant to deliver them to Wang Hu, anticipating refusal. The servant was instructed to feign a river mishap en route, claiming the letter had been water-damaged and requesting to leave the package at a roadside shrine until he could retrieve a new letter upon return. Wang Hu, unsuspecting, kept it. Soon after, the superior office suddenly issued documents to the Shouzhou investigative court, summoning Wang Hu to confront Yao Zi’s corruption charges. Only then did Wang Hu realize he had been betrayed, but his regret came too late. When brought to prison, Yao Zi falsely accused Wang Hu of colluding in the bribery. Officials retrieved the original ingots from Wang Hu’s home, and upon inspection, they proved to be pure gold. Wang Hu, speechless and unable to defend himself, soon choked with rage and died. Yao Zi then bribed the investigators heavily, shifting all blame onto Wang Hu and thus escaping punishment.\n\nYears later, Yao Zi became Vice Prefect of Luzhou. One day, while traveling along the Huai River, Wang Hu’s wandering spirit appeared across the water, seized him, and refused to release him. From then on, Yao Zi grew deranged, as if constantly battered by unseen hands, his mouth and nose often bleeding. Though he would revive, this torment recurred five to seven times a year for three years. Neither physicians, shamans, nor Daoist talismans could cure him.\n\nAt the time, Qian Yannian served as Prefect of Luzhou, and Chen Mian as Transport Commissioner. They reported the matter to the imperial court, petitioning for the temporary dispatch of Daoist Registrar Song Zhicai to the prefecture to perform deliverance rites. Once Zhicai arrived, he memorialized the True Martial Sovereign. As the first memorial was being submitted, Yao Zi suddenly scrambled from his sickbed and prostrated himself before the True Martial’s altar, confessing in detail: “It was I who first conceived the scheme to accept the bribe—Wang Hu had no part in it. When the affair was exposed, I wrongly shifted the blame onto him, causing his unjust death. I dare implore your compassion and beg for absolution.” Qian Yannian ordered an official to record his words from the side, and upon waking, Yao Zi was shown the transcript. Overcome with shame, he resigned from office that very day and died soon after.\n\nGuo Huangzhong, Prefect of Yun’an Commandery, once visited the Western Rosy Cloud Abbey ten *li* outside the city to burn incense. In a dream, the abbey’s tutelary deity appeared to him, saying: “Your Excellency’s beneficence has blessed this land, and its people have received much grace. Yet there is a concealed matter I dare not withhold: tomorrow, a butcher will arrive with an ox to be slaughtered. Among the nine men presented, you must examine them closely, lest an innocent man be wronged.” The next morning, the patrol bureau indeed brought nine bound men before him, along with a soldier claiming to have captured them and seeking reward. In truth, the soldier had killed the ox himself, framed the nine men, and then arrested them to claim the bounty. Guo questioned him once, and the soldier confessed.\n\nAlas! In one case, the grievance reached the sacred hearing of the True Sovereign; in the other, the crime was foreknown by the abbey’s deity. Can one then shift blame and sell wickedness? Do heavenly punishment and karmic retribution ever cease?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFortune and misfortune arise from oneself;\nGood and evil stem from the heart.\nGuard what lies within,\nAnd external calamities cannot invade.\nWoe to those treacherous and deceitful,\nWhose hearts are deep as fortress moats.\nThey set snares and pitfalls,\nEngaging in endless strife.\nThough they may hide in secret,\nThe Lord on High watches over you.\nSeeking hollow fame through fraud—\nHow can such deeds endure?\n\nThe Transmission states: The Lady of the Southern Marchmount said, \"People follow customs and seek after florid reputations. It is like burning incense—though all may smell its fragrance, they do not realize it scorches the one who burns it. When the incense is consumed, its qi dissipates; when a name is established, the person perishes. Thus do the lofty scorn and shun such pursuits.\"\n\nThe Perceiver of the Unseen and the Inaudible True Person warned the gods, saying, \"A name is the fairest vessel of past and present, yet the Creator deeply abhors it. Between heaven and earth, no name remains unblemished. When a man’s name is about to rise, something must inevitably ruin it. Is a name, then, not weighty indeed? Even for one who possesses true substance, it is still forbidden—how much worse for those who merely trade in hollow reputations?\"\n\nIn former times, Sheng Junmin, son of Minister Canzheng Du, was proud of his exceptional talent from youth. He passed the imperial examination with distinction, his fame resounding so that none dared surpass him. When the palace examination was held, Wang Gongchen ranked first, and Junmin was deeply aggrieved. One day, he dreamed of wandering in the netherworld and paying homage to its ruler, to whom he pleaded for the reason behind his misfortune. The ruler replied, \"You are the reincarnation of Yang Su, Duke of Yue during the Sui dynasty, having passed through several lifetimes. Though you have endured poverty without rising above it, your present suffering is retribution for deeds committed in the Sui era. Even in this life, your fate remains ill-starred. Though your karmic fortune differs, your talent remains unchanged.\" Upon hearing this, Junmin was utterly disheartened. Later, he indeed achieved nothing and died.\n\nAlas! That Yang Su of old should become Junmin of today—he had truly fallen from heaven to earth. Yet he did not lose his male form, which is still preferable to being reborn as a woman.\n\nLi Shu served as Minister and was renowned for his purity and eloquence. When Xu Ling met him, he was deeply impressed, declaring himself inferior. Shu, too, was rather proud of his own abilities. Before he had a son, he suddenly died. His wife, née Yuan, later remarried Zhao Qi. One night, she dreamed of Shu weeping and saying, \"Tomorrow, I will be reborn as a girl in the Liu household, east of the dead-end alley south of the Seven Emperors’ Ward crossroads. That family is extremely poor and already has many daughters—they will surely not raise me. If I die again, who knows where I might end up? I beg you, remember our old bond as husband and wife and come quickly to redeem me.\"\n\nYuan氏 made no reply. Shu said, \"It seems you hesitate out of deference to Master Zhao. I shall tell him myself.\" Soon after, Zhao too dreamed the same dream as Yuan. At dawn, he took gold and sought out the household, where indeed a girl had just been born—already cast into a basin of water. Zhao hastily rescued her and took her home.\n\nAlas! The once-renowned Li Shu, now reduced to an unwanted infant girl—how far he has fallen! Is this not even worse than Yang Su’s downfall? Could this be retribution for his arrogance and frivolity in the days when his fame and reputation were at their height?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWithin determines without; fame is but a guest to substance.\nSupreme virtue and perfect goodness—brilliance shines forth daily.\nYet praise, like sweet dew from Ganling, and reputation, like the fleeting breath of Shaoxi,\nAre but croton sores and gardenia whips—overvalued, inflamed.\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* wields its brush to condemn the heart.\nTo harbor a treacherous mind—\n**The Scripture says:**\nThe Bodhisattva Earth-Holder addressed the Buddha: \"I recall that in a past age, when the Tathāgata Universal Light appeared in the world, I was a bhikṣu. Wherever there were fords, crossroads, or treacherous fields hindering carts and horses, I would level the ground, build bridges, or carry sand and soil—laboring tirelessly thus. Through countless Buddhas’ appearances, until the time of the Tathāgata Vipaśyin, when the king invited the Buddha to a feast, I leveled the earth to await the Buddha. Vipaśyin placed his hand upon my head and said, ‘If you level the earth of your mind, the earth of the world will all be level.’ At once, my mind opened: I saw my body as dust, no different from the dust of the world. The nature of dust does not clash or grind—thus I attained perfect enlightenment and was named Earth-Holder.\nIf the earth of the mind may not be leveled, how can treachery be harbored?\"\n\nGenerally, petty men take risks for fleeting gain—such schemes cannot be forestalled by wisdom or foresight. Long ago, the Attendant-in-Ordinary Cao Liyong carried himself with the pride of an old meritorious official; even the Grand Empress Dowager held him in awe. Whenever imperial favors were bestowed, Liyong often blocked their execution. As his refusals multiplied, even when three were issued in succession, he could not reject them all. Over time, this was noticed by petty men: whenever a request was denied thrice, they would petition again. The Grand Empress Dowager said, \"The Attendant-in-Ordinary has already refused.\" The petitioner replied, \"I have already informed the Attendant-in-Ordinary’s wet nurse—or his kinswoman, Lady Chun—who said he had consented. Liyong truly knew nothing of this.\" Later, when the favor was granted, it was only because three refusals had already been made. Enraged, the Grand Empress Dowager’s wrath gave rise to the disaster of Cao Rui.\n\nChen Guan, serving as Vice Minister of the Three Departments, had an underling of extreme cunning who secretly curried favor with the powerful. Matters in the ministry were routinely referred to him, and when he voiced his assent, the ministers and vice ministers would feign yawns, as if unworthy of his courtesy. Guan, indignant, resolved to dismiss him. The underling, sensing this, served him all the more diligently. Over a year passed without any delays in affairs, and Chen began to treat him well. Once, while entertaining guests, he entrusted the underling with preparing the feast. Unaware of his true intentions—his treacherous heart—the next day, the underling brought a ten-year-old girl to the street outside Donghua Gate, wailing, \"Vice Minister Chen invited guests on such-and-such a day and ordered me to prepare the feast. Not even a tenth of what was needed is ready! What am I to do? I must sell this girl to raise the money!\" He then bribed the secret agents of the Imperial City Bureau to report this. The court believed him and nearly demoted Chen on the spot. Only through the intervention of the chief minister was the matter resolved—yet a year later, Chen was still dismissed because of it.\n\nAlas! Were the schemes of these two men not treacherous? Such treachery—how can it be guarded against?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nA treacherous heart towers ten thousand *ren*,\nWithin it, five weapons arise.\nYi Fu’s faint smile, Lin Pu’s gentle demeanor—\nTheir faces give nothing away; fortune and misfortune strike like lightning.\nThey boast of their cunning, surpassing even the gods.\nYet how could they know the Creator sees all, unseen?\nTo crush another’s strengths—\n**The Scripture says:**\nLuo Zhongxin asked Mount Tortoise, \"To fully realize the mind is to know one’s nature. What is the principle of fully realizing the mind?\"\nMount Tortoise replied, \"Before discussing the full realization of the mind, one must first understand what the mind is. The mind is clarity, penetration, vastness, stillness, and unity. If you grasp this clearly, then we may speak of fully realizing the mind. Without such understanding, what mind is there to realize?\"\nThe Great Silence Chan Master said, \"The mind and nature of man are like the cold moon. When it is cold, water freezes into ice. When it warms, ice melts back into water. When beings are deluded, their nature congeals into mind. When they awaken, their mind dissolves back into nature—it is ever thus.\"\nAlas! These teachings urge us to recognize the mind and illuminate the nature.\nCan those who crush another’s strengths understand this?\n\nLong ago, Mu Xiu was renowned for his poetry and often traveled between the capital and Luoyang. Someone inscribed his verses on the walls of the palace, and when Emperor Zhenzong saw them, he marveled, asking whose poetry it was. His attendants replied, \"Mu Xiu’s.\" The emperor said, \"With such literary talent, why have the ministers not recommended him?\" Duke Jin interjected, \"This man’s conduct does not match his writing.\" With this single remark, the emperor never inquired about him again. Was Duke Jin’s heart clarity, penetration, vastness, stillness, and unity? Or was it the dissolution of mind into nature? This is why he died without a place to rest.\n\nWhen Zhang Yaoya governed Shu, a clerk and adjutant, old and infirm, neglected his duties. The governor reprimanded him, saying, \"Why do you not retire?\" The next day, the adjutant requested leave and bid farewell with a poem, the gist of which was:\n*The autumn light is as thin as an official’s favor,\nThe mountain hues pale beside the longing to return home.*\nZhang was startled and apologized, saying, \"This is my fault. Among my colleagues is such a poet, and I did not know—how could I not be at fault?\"\n\nThus, he firmly urged him to stay and consoled him with recommendations. Had he not devoted himself to the learning of exhausting the mind and knowing one’s nature, or to the doctrine of dissolving the mind into nature, could he have attained such understanding? This is why he comprehended life and death before his death, already able to foreknow the month and day, secretly recording it upon his posthumous portrait.\n\nAn ancient saying goes: \"A single deviant thought creates a gulf as vast as heaven and earth.\"\n\n**Eulogy:**\nA person’s slightest goodness,\nIs like beholding a propitious omen.\nNurture and perfect it,\nLest it be thwarted or disturbed.\nWhoever harbors envy,\nWill sink into obscurity.\nConcealing another’s innate worth,\nOnly deepens one’s own negligence.\nHarming oneself and others,\nInvites calamity that pierces to the bone.\nYet shielding one’s own flaws—\n\nAs the *Tradition* records: Someone asked Master Sun the True Man, \"On the doctrine of nurturing one’s nature, I wish to hear it.\" The True Man replied: \"To nurture one’s nature is to cultivate one’s inherent nature. The essential lies in perfecting all conduct; even without medicinal elixirs, one may preserve longevity. If one’s virtue and conduct are deficient, even daily ingesting golden cinnabar and jade nectar will be of no avail. Thus, in daily life, can one shield one’s flaws? If one shields them, then in daily life, nothing will not be flawed—how can this be spoken of? If only one realized the folly of shielding flaws, and over time nurtured one’s inherent nature until no flaws remained, one would be called a person of perfect goodness. How distant then would one be from transcendence?\"\n\nFormerly, Huang Wanyou cultivated the Dao in the uninhabited wilds of southern Qian. Wang Jian invited him to Chengdu, honoring him with utmost reverence as a teacher. One day, he asked about the method of ingesting elixirs. Wanyou replied: \"I am no immortal, nor one who ingests elixirs. I merely empty my mind to nurture qi, cultivate benevolence in my conduct, and minimize my faults.\" Later, he earnestly sought to return and could no longer be summoned.\n\nLiu Yi hailed from an illustrious family and passed the imperial examinations in his youth. Within a decade, he rose to an official post of two thousand *shi*. During the Chongning era, he governed Hanyang. Whenever he had leisure, he would disguise himself in plain clothes and wander among the mountains of Dabie, conversing daily with farmers and rustics. He inquired into the efficacy of prefectural governance and the hardships of the common folk. If he found any matter amiss and deemed it reformable, he would return and rectify it. Eventually, he encountered an extraordinary person and thus attained transcendence.\n\nAs for these two gentlemen, would they have shielded their flaws? Could they have had flaws at all? This is how they nurtured their inherent nature and ultimately ascended to the rank of immortals.\n\nLet me further expound on lesser examples, that those who cling to shielding their flaws may each take heed and strictly guard against it.\n\nLi Ji rose through the ranks to high office. On the day of his death, he summoned his son and said: \"I have no other regrets in life, save for one thing: during my time in Hangzhou, I once purchased a set of *White Anthology*—that is my sole remorse.\" Cai Junmo once wrote in large characters on fine Wu paper to embellish the matter. Huang Zongdan, while governing Suzhou, had Wang Zhi as his assistant magistrate.\n\nOne day, over a hundred counterfeit coiners were apprehended and sent to prison for interrogation. Huang Zongdan joyfully said to Wang Zhi: \"I caught them all using my secret methods.\" Wang Zhi’s expression darkened as he replied: \"When crimes leave no trace, you employ secret methods to ensnare them and then consign them to death—do you still rejoice in this?\" Zongdan suddenly rose from his seat, stepped down, and bowed in apology: \"Without your words, I would have nearly erred.\"\n\nGenerally, those of earlier generations were often like this. In this present age, are there truly no such men? To become such a person, one must first embody their example.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe malady of concealment admits no remedy.\nClinging to wrongs, lost in delusion—\ncalamity’s end is assured.\nA thousand virtues struggle to take root,\nwhile ten thousand evils find their foundation.\nThe sages of old had faults,\nyet welcomed others’ awareness.\nThose who shield their flaws\ndeem themselves wiser than Confucius.\n\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Sixteen (conclusion)\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Seventeen\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\n**Coercion Through Power and Threats**\n\nThe *Biography* states: When Wang Wenzheng governed the realm, in the early Tianxi era, Xue Jiansu served as Transport Commissioner for Jiang-Huai. Upon taking leave, the minister offered no other counsel but this: \"The people of the Southeast are utterly exhausted.\" When Zhang Shixun became Jiangxi Transport Commissioner and took leave, the minister again offered no other counsel but this: \"The court has wrung every last profit from the land.\"\n\nGenerally, to guide the ruler and nourish the people, one ought to act thus. Now, those in high office show no concern for prefectures and counties, while those governing prefectures and counties show no concern for the common folk—this is coercion through power and threats.\n\nFormerly, when Song Xuan’gong served as Judge of the Three Bureaus, the court issued an edict to remit all outstanding debts nationwide. Yet sixty-eight prefectures delayed their reports past the deadline. He memorialized the throne, proposing that surveillance commissioners be charged with verifying the accounts by a set date. As a result, several million in debts were truly remitted, and three thousand two hundred and six prisoners were released from their shackles.\n\nWhen Wang Wenmu (Qin Ruo) oversaw debt settlements, the Bureau of Finance submitted a petition to cancel all overdue taxes nationwide to extend imperial grace. From the Qiande to the Xianping eras, over ten million were remitted, and more than three thousand prisoners were freed from confinement.\n\nWhen Minister of Personnel Chen Buliang oversaw the Bureau of Revenue in the Three Bureaus, eighteen brine wells in Rongzhou had long since become exhausted. Yet the authorities continued to enforce the original quotas, confiscating the property of three hundred fifteen households. He repeatedly argued the precedents, restoring all confiscated assets and annually remitting over three hundred thousand in nominal quotas. These were men who held office but lacked coercive power—yet how could those who rely on threats and intimidation achieve the same? Their purpose was simply to avoid further burdening the people’s strength.\n\nThere was another official who likewise dared not unjustly seize anything. Let me recount it fully, that later generations may know of leniency and compassion.\n\nAt the founding of the dynasty, when Wang Zhi was sent as an emissary to equalize miscellaneous taxes in the Two Zhe circuits, the former law of the Qian family levied three *per mu*. Upon his arrival, he ordered it reduced to one *per mu*. The court reprimanded him for acting without authorization. He replied: “The Two Zhe are now the sovereign’s people—how can we again follow the laws of a spurious state?” The tax of one *per mu* thus began with Zhi.\n\nWhen Wang Gongchen proposed reimposing the salt monopoly in Hebei, Zhang Fangping vehemently opposed it: “Under the old law of Hebei, violators were put to death. The people petitioned to equalize the quota and pay it along with their taxes, and only then was the prohibition relaxed. If we now revisit this matter, it would amount to a second imposition.” Thereupon the emperor understood and abolished it that very day.\n\nWhen the people arrived, they held Buddhist rites for him for seven days.\n\nLi Yunze, governing Tanzhou, found the Ma clan had imposed brutal exactions on the prefecture’s people: a tax of silk called \"land-tax silk\"; for every room in a house, a levy of one *zhang* and three *chi* of silk, called \"house-output silk\"; and for every plow-ox, an annual tax of four *sheng* of rice—even if the ox died, the tax was still due, called the \"dry-bones tax.\" Upon his arrival, he abolished them all.\n\nChen Shiqing, governing Guangzhou, found the region suffering from the harm of a per-capita salt purchase. Upon his arrival, he memorialized to have it abolished. Thus the people of Five Rams first had whole clothes and full bellies. The people of Guangzhou sang:\n*\"Father Shao, Mother Chen—\nfreed us from two pains.\"*\nFor the former governor Shao Ye had dug an inner moat to berth boats, sparing the people the harm of the wind-tossed waves.\n\nAlas! Better to show leniency and mercy, winning the praise of ten thousand mouths, than to ride roughshod with threats and coercion, incurring the people’s resentment and the gods’ wrath. Has one not heard the saying that where joy gathers, fortune arises, and where grievances accumulate, disaster strikes?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*\"Mighty Qi’s might—\npreserved Wei, repelled the Di.\"*\n\nAt Jiagu’s might, the three armies recoiled in awe.\nAt Xiangru’s single rage, the King of Qin was rebuked.\nTo untangle strife and rescue from distress—this is called true power.\nYet to ravage creatures and annihilate the people—even jackals and tigers would refuse such food.\n\nTo indulge in violence and slaughter:\nAs the *Sutra of Holding the Earth* states, the sin of taking life casts beings into the Three Evil Realms, and even if reborn among humans, they suffer five retributions.\nFirst, for tormenting sentient beings, they fall into hell at the slightest touch of scorching heat, enduring every agony.\nSecond, for lacking compassion and acting contrary to humanity, upon exhausting their hellish punishment, they plunge into the realm of beasts, to be butchered by men.\nThird, for craving rich flavors, after their beastly suffering ends, they descend into the hungry ghost realm, daily tormented by hunger and thirst.\nFourth, for cutting short lives, once their ghostly punishment is complete, though they regain human form, their lives are short.\nFifth, for the moment of killing, when myriad sufferings converge upon those beings, they not only live briefly but also endure frequent illness.\nThus speaks the Buddha—how could it not be so?\n\nPity those who fail to see that humans and beasts, though their forms differ, share the same nature of life.\nBut reflect through poetry:\nIf I were ill now, would I willingly die?\nNo—I would seek physicians and diviners, hastening to recover.\nIf my allotted span were at its end, would I still accept death?\nNo—I would pray to heaven and earth, begging for extended years.\nSince I fear death, do they not fear it too?\nSince I cling to life, do they not cling to it as well?\n\nOnce, Zhang Daoji was fond of hunting. Beside his ancestral tombs stretched a vast forest, teeming with deer and fowl. Daily, Daoji and a band of ruffians roamed there, setting nets on all sides—what they called \"the sky-spanning net.\" A single sweep would trap no fewer than hundreds. When the haul grew too great to gather, they simply trampled the creatures from above, crushing them to death, then divided the spoils to carry away.\n\nOnce, beside the Mingyang Abbey, he shot and killed a hare—tiny, with a notch in its white ear. From that moment, he grew distraught, as though maddened. He gathered all his hunting gear from days past and burned it, then built a hut beside the abbey, dwelling there day after day.\n\nOne day, two hares approached him directly and spoke in human words: \"I have been a hare for three hundred years, living by the eastern tombs of the Zhang family. Now you have killed me.\"\n\nThe other said: \"I have been a hare for one hundred and eighty years, hiding beside Mingyang Abbey. Once, an eagle seized me, tearing off one of my ears, but I struggled free and escaped. Twenty years have passed since then. Against eagles, hounds, nets, and traps, I could always evade them—never did I expect you to use a crossbow. I have already lodged my grievance with Heaven. You must repay my life.\"\n\nNot long after, he indeed died.\n\nLiu Xiang was also fond of hunting. Whenever the urge struck, he would go out, undeterred by cold or heat. The creatures he wounded and killed over time were beyond counting. In the seventh year of Shaoxing, he suddenly fell gravely ill: three growths appeared on his back, resembling turtles but black, lurking beneath his skin and flesh. After several days, their heads and limbs took shape, becoming three distinct turtles. Soon they could move, and when fish was offered as bait, they would thrust their heads forward, as if eager to feed. Before long, they began gnawing at his flesh on either side, causing unbearable pain. After more than a month of this, he died.\n\nFive days after his death, he possessed his daughter-in-law and spoke: \"For the killing and wounding of lives in my lifetime, I have received this retribution. Even now, the underworld court is swiftly punishing me. Quickly gather my hunting gear and burn it—perhaps they will know I have repented.\"\n\nThus, can wanton slaughter and harm be justified? Even dogs, when provoked to kill, are counted among the ten foremost transgressions—how can such violence be indulged?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nPunishment is to halt crime,\nArms are to quell disorder.\n\nGrieve with compassion when passing judgment, mourn with propriety in funerals, and wage war only when unavoidable—thus may the necessity of killing be discerned. To cherish the people and love all creatures is to make no distinction between noble and base. Those cruel and destructive men, beast-hearted though human-faced, wantonly cut and waste. As the *Daoist Canon* records: the three stars of Weaving Maidens govern silk and precious treasures, while the four stars of Woman’s Lodge oversee the weaving and tailoring of cloth. How then can wanton cutting and waste be justified? Have you not heard how the silkworm originated from the transformation of Horse Neigh?\n\nIn a former life, the Great Master Horse Neigh was once king of Vaiśālī. In his realm lived a people shaped like horses yet clothed in nothing. The king, exercising his divine power, divided his own body to become silkworms, that they might have garments. Later, reborn in Central India, the king’s former subjects—those horse-shaped folk—yearned for him and neighed in sorrow without cease, whence he was called Horse Neigh, the Twelfth Patriarch.\n\nIn general, a single garment costs a thousand silkworm lives. According to the Buddha’s teaching, even wearing silk incurs a debt to be repaid—how much worse, then, to cut and waste it without cause? Thus did Emperor Wen of Han ensure his favored ladies’ robes did not trail upon the ground. Emperor Wenzong of Tang once bared his sleeve before his ministers, saying, “This garment has been washed thrice.” Duke Wen of Jin wore no double-layered silk; Zixia’s robes were patched like a quail’s plumage; Ji Wenzi kept no concubine clad in silk; Yan Ying’s concubines wore no silk; Dong Wei pieced together scraps into a robe called “Hundred Knots”; and Ji Tong wore no duplicate garments—all in frugal reverence for fortune.\n\nHave you not heard that wanton cutting and waste bring retribution after death? In the early years of Shaoxing, Guo Yinzhi’s daughter, named Yin Feng, was seized by the underworld court and saw countless sinners. Among them was a woman surnamed Zhao, named Twelve, bound in the corridor. Before her lay several heaps of cloth—shredded bolts, remnants, and countless garments both new and old. Yin Feng asked, “What crime is this?” The underworld officer replied, “This woman delighted in fine silks and wasted bolts by cutting them. She is ordered to mend every piece back into whole cloth before she may be released.”\n\nZhao Shizhou’s wife, née Quan, after dying for several days, possessed her maid Lai Xi and said, “In life, I squandered silk for shoes and stockings, and used excess water for washing my hair and feet. The Water Bureau of the underworld now punishes me, flogging me daily with unbearable torment. Pray convey this to Shizhou.” Her family, hearing this, was overcome with grief. How then can wanton cutting and waste be deemed without sin?\n\nMoreover, adorning oneself to seduce others incurs even graver sin—how can one not take heed?\n\n**In Praise:**\nSpring fills the cloud-woven curtains,\nThe weaving maid labors through the night.\nThread by thread, the measure grows—\nOnly after endless toil is a bolt complete.\nEmbroidery drapes the walls and halls,\nSilk robes clothe the lowliest servant.\nWho pities the frostbitten fingers,\nThe ceaseless clatter of the freezing loom?\nThe mother scolds Gongsun for flaunting his coarse cloth,\nYet even this is spun from forbidden excess.\nTo slaughter without ritual propriety—\n\nAs the saying goes: Some flay fish for their rosy flesh, others cage crabs in troughs to keep them alive. Such utter failure to transform one’s nature plunges swiftly into the Three Evil Realms, swifter than an arrow—hardly worth debate. How can one not realize all creatures possess awareness, no different from ourselves in essence?\n\nHumans know to love their kin—\nWhen Deng Zhi shot the mother ape, she fell from the tree, and her young swiftly plucked the arrow to seal her wound, then bore her away on its back.\nDo they not love their kin?\n\nHumans know to love their children—\nWhen He Quan shot the mother stork, the arrow pierced her belly, yet she clung to life, wrenching the shaft with her beak until her fledgling tumbled free.\nDo they not love their children?\n\nHumans know to revere their mates—\nIn the kingdom of Huan, when a wild bull elephant died, the herd of cows encircled him, refusing to leave until they had buried him with all their strength.\nDo they not revere their mates?\n\nHumans know to cherish their spouses—\nWhen Zhang Ziming shot the mandarin duck, killing the female and boiling her in a pot, the male, seeing this from afar, plunged into the seething cauldron without hesitation, crying once before perishing.\nDo they not cherish their spouses?\n\nHumans know to repay kindness—\nThe mountain spirit honored the loyalty of a flock of parrots. Once, when the parrots dwelled in a distant mountain, the beasts there loved them and would not harm them. Later, when the parrots returned home and saw the distant mountain ablaze, they flew into the water, soaked their wings, and scattered droplets into the sky to quench the flames. The mountain spirit, moved by their righteousness, instantly extinguished the fire.\nDo they not repay kindness?\n\nHumans know to nurse grudges—\nLiu Yongxi kept a dog. When he served as magistrate of Qiancheng County, a guest arrived, and he offered steamed buns. Yongxi gave one to the dog, but the guest said, “Feeding dogs and swine to humans was scorned by the ancients—how much more so with delicacies?” The dog refused to eat, glared, and left. That night, it waited until the guest slept, then forced its way in. The guest, sensing its intent, climbed onto a beam to escape. The dog leapt onto the bed, found no one, and in a fury, hurled itself to its death.\nDo they not nurse grudges?\n\nHumans know to remain loyal to their masters—\nOn the day Wei Dajian’s horse was to die, he prayed, “I owe you much. Now you are ill, and I have done all I can to heal you. If you must perish, go outside—do not die before me, for I cannot bear it.”\n\nThe horse then knelt upon its forelegs, as if in farewell, rose with a mournful sigh, and only after stepping outside did it breathe its last.\nDo they not remain loyal to their masters?\n\nHumans know to care for the orphaned—\nas with the cat recorded by Han Yu of Changli. Two cats had both given birth, but one suddenly died, and the other nursed its orphan.\nDo they not care for the orphaned?\n\nHumans know to heed admonition—\nas with the bees invoked by the monk Renxi. The monk Renxi once wished to build a Buddhist shrine, and a man offered a great sandalwood tree as an offering. When the monk went to fell it, tens of thousands of giant bees swarmed and gathered upon it, so that the workmen dared not approach. The monk admonished them, saying: “You have come to this through evil karma. I am performing Buddhist rites, and if you do not yield to me, I will burn you after three days if you do not depart.” When the appointed time came, not a single bee remained.\nDo they not heed admonition?\n\nHumans know to cultivate realization—\nas with the five hundred bats of the South Seas, which dwelt in a withered tree. One day, a group of merchants gathered beneath it and lit a fire. Among them was a man reciting the *Abhidharma Piṭaka*.\n\nBefore long, the fire flared up, and the tree was consumed in flames. The five hundred bats, so rapt in listening to the sound of the Dharma that they could not bear to leave, all perished in the fire. Later, they were reborn as humans—bright, keen, and quick-witted—renounced their homes to cultivate the Dao, and together attained the fruit of sagehood. Later, King Kaniṣka and the Venerable Pārśva gathered five hundred sages in Kashmir to compose the *Vibhāṣā Śāstra*. Those five hundred sages were none other than the five hundred bats of former days.\n\nDo they not cultivate realization?\n\nIn general, humans and creatures are not inherently different; what sets them apart is the power of fortune and karma, and the shell of the body. Have you not heard of the power of not killing? Long ago, Aṅgulimāla was once a king who delighted most in slaughter. Repenting his sins, he left the household life and went begging. Arriving at a household where a woman was in difficult labor, she clutched him and begged for help. Aṅgulimāla said, “I have only just entered the Way—how can I save you? Wait until I return and ask the Buddha.” When he returned, the Buddha said, “Hurry back to the bedside of the woman in labor and loudly proclaim: ‘I have come from the Dharma of the sages and have never taken a life.’ Upon hearing these words, no child fails to be born.” Aṅgulimāla followed the instruction, and the child was indeed delivered.\n\nAlas! This was but a single declaration of not killing, yet its power to deliver from distress was so great. If such is the case, then how much more power must there be in wanton butchery to sink one into suffering?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nA scholar, if not for necessity,\nshould not kill dogs or swine.\nTo eat meat for seventy days—\nits weight is thus.\nFor offerings to guests or ancestors,\nit may be unavoidable.\nHow dare one indulge the palate,\nwielding knife and spoon at will?\nBeholding the suffering of living beings,\nfeel their pain as your own.\nTo scatter and waste the five grains—\n\nThe *Tradition* says: The Celestial Granary of the five grains resides among the twenty-eight constellations, governed by the star *Wēi*. Generally, humans regard food as heaven; to go a single day without eating is to suffer the pangs of hunger. Thus, the sages devoted themselves to agriculture and valued grain. The Son of Heaven plowed the fields himself to encourage farming, and in spring and summer, prayed to the Supreme Emperor for abundant harvests. How then can the five grains be scattered and wasted?\n\nOnce, during a famine in the Three Rivers region, the price of grain soared, and people resorted to gathering mountain tubers and wild vines to survive. The dead numbered no fewer than fifteen in ten. At that time, Wang Fajin, having completed his merit and attained immortality, ascended to the heavens. Yet he returned to plead with the Emperor on behalf of the people. The Emperor said: “Humans occupy the great position among the Three Powers, embodying the harmony of heaven and earth. To attain human form and be born in the Central Land is not easily achieved. Heaven moves the origin of the four seasons; earth endows the essence of the five phases, producing the five grains and a hundred fruits to nourish the people. Yet humans fail to appreciate the nurturing grace of heaven and earth, carelessly wasting grain, disdaining silk and hemp, so that farmers and weaving women toil without enough to eat, exhaust themselves without warmth, and are further ungrateful for their labor. This is why the divine spirits reproach them, and heaven and earth do not protect them.”\n\nRecently, the local administrators of mountains and rivers all submitted memorials, reporting that people despise and discard the five grains, failing to value the foundation of clothing and food. The Supreme Emperor had already commanded the Bureau of Mount Taihua to summon the spirits of the five grains, causing their cultivation to fail and leading gradually to famine as a form of punishment, hoping to chasten their hearts. Yet soon after, the Most High issued a merciful decree: “The Great Dao cherishes life and must first save beings. Though the recent famine was brought upon themselves by the people, they know not the cause and have no path to repentance or redemption. You shall now serve as an attendant in the Celestial Palace. Temporarily return to the mortal world and universally proclaim to the people that they must repent their sins, treasure and cherish agriculture and sericulture, and not dare to waste or squander. This, too, shall be your hidden merit.”\n\nFajin received the decree and returned, speaking his message before departing again. Liu Yuanzhen was also one who attained the Dao. In his youth, he dreamed of a Daoist who fed him a peach, after which he could abstain from grain. One day, on the road in Zhongnan, he encountered a nobleman with a grand retinue. Yuanzhen said to him, “Have some regard for my people.” The nobleman nodded in assent. A companion asked, “Who is that?” Yuanzhen replied, “That is the mountain spirit. The Supreme Emperor, seeing that the wheat harvest would be abundant but that people would not cherish it, ordered that two-tenths be reaped. I pleaded on behalf of the people.” Soon after, a great wind and rain arose, ruining two-tenths of the wheat. From this, we know all the more that the five grains truly must not be carelessly discarded.\n\nMoreover, each person’s allotment of sustenance is fixed by destiny. For example, if one has a thousand strings of cash and spends one hundred a day, it will last ten thousand days. If one spends a string a day, it will last a thousand days. Between a thousand days and ten thousand days—would you not prefer the latter?\n\nFormerly, Minister Feng Ji often said: “In my youth, I personally witnessed Xuedou teaching people to cherish their fortune, saying: ‘Humans do not die by fate but by the exhaustion of their allotted blessings.’” Yuan Houzhi died and was revived, and recounted: “When I first arrived in the netherworld, the master said to me: ‘Your blessings are not yet exhausted; in time, you will rise to the rank of minister in two bureaus. However, you must cherish your fortune to do so.’” From then on, Houzhi reduced his expenses in every matter. Even with a single cup of rice, he would first set some aside before eating. In all his provisions, he dared not exceed his due. Later, he indeed attained the position of chief minister and lived past seventy. If even those with meager fortune must cherish it, how much more should others?\n\nThe *Gazetteer of Wuyun Mountain* records that the Great Master Zhi Feng was once seated in meditation in the Hall of Samantabhadra when suddenly a spirit knelt before him. The master asked, “Who are you?” The spirit replied, “I am the guardian of the precepts.” The master said, “I have long been troubled by past transgressions—do you know of them?” The spirit said, “What sins have you committed? However, there is one small fault. Since you have asked, I dare not conceal it. For example, the water used to rinse your alms bowl is also the property of the donor. To discard it as you do is not proper. From now on, you will suffer a minor illness.”\n\nThe spirit vanished upon finishing its words. Thereafter, Master Zhi Feng indeed suffered from a stomach ailment for thirteen years.\n\nAlas! Even the leftover rinsing water, when discarded, brings such consequences—how much more so for other things?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen the palace guard discarded food, Emperor Yuan rebuked him with severity.\nWhen Jia Shirong jested by planting rice in a thief’s footprint, his father, Pei Shixing, meted out stern punishment.\nFood is life itself—its significance is not trifling.\nRevered as \"Heaven,\" it bears the highest mark of respect.\nA single grain of rice, a single kernel of millet—no pearl or jade can surpass their worth.\nYet how often do we thoughtlessly burden the people?\n\nIt is recorded that when Shao Bowen first entered office, he sought counsel from Master Cheng Yi. The master said: *\"Whenever you handle official documents, if you can ease even a fraction of urgency in their demands, the people will receive that same measure of relief.\"*\n\nAh! The master’s words may truly be called benevolent.\nIf others wish for peace, how can I not wish the same?\nIf others desire joy, how can I not desire it?\nTo claim comfort and ease for oneself while imposing toil and hardship upon others—this is true heartlessness.\n\nLet me recount how the elders, when governing the people, dared not inflict the slightest burden, that all may know and emulate their example.\n\nWhen Lü Wenjing oversaw the criminal courts of the Two Zhe provinces, the capital was in the midst of constructing grand palaces and temples, requiring timber from the south. The officials enforced deadlines with excessive harshness, and some laborers died in service. Those who fled were branded as fugitives, and their wives and children were arrested and imprisoned.\n\nLord Lü submitted a memorial outlining his concerns, arguing that in the depths of winter, when rivers ran low, the people suffered greatly from hauling timber, and that the deadlines should be relaxed until the waterways flowed freely again, when soldiers could be dispatched to transport the logs with ease. The emperor, pleased, heeded his advice. From this, his compassion for the people and concern for the realm became known, and he was subsequently elevated to high office.\n\nWhen Sima Chi served as magistrate of Guangshan County, the imperial palace caught fire, and all counties were ordered to supply bamboo and timber. The prefectural decree demanded delivery within three days. Sima, knowing the region produced no large bamboo, had to purchase it from Qi and Huang, which could not arrive in three days. He therefore set a separate deadline for the people, with penalties for late delivery. Sheng Du, the prefect, flew into a rage upon hearing this. Yet when Guangshan delivered its bamboo, it was the first among all counties to do so.\n\nWhen Lord Fan Zhennan governed Qingshe, the Hebei region suffered a severe grain shortage, and the tribute grain from Qingshe was to be transported to Bozhou for collection. The people were greatly burdened by the transport, yet grain prices in Hebei were not particularly high. Lord Fan instructed the people to pay three *huan* per *hu* at their local prefecture, then dispatched his staff to carry the funds to Bozhou, where they offered double the price to purchase grain. The high price attracted vast quantities, and within five days, the quota was met, with surplus funds remaining for several years. Lord Fan distributed the remainder to the people according to their contributions.\n\nWhen Wang Ji served as registrar of Longxi, the prefectures of Fujian were ordered to procure crane feathers for arrows. As crane feathers were not a common resource, and the officials pressed the people with excessive urgency, the people could not endure the hardship. Wang instructed them to substitute goose feathers instead and promptly dispatched a memorial to the court via courier. The court approved his proposal, and the practice extended to other prefectures.\n\nAh! If all those who governed the people were like these gentlemen, would not those who impose toil and hardship feel ashamed?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nRest and peace—these are the desires of all.\nA year’s labor for the people should not exceed three days.\nAxes should fell trees in season; nets should not be cast too often.\nWhen mountains and rivers are at peace, birds and beasts multiply.\nYet when petty men disturb them, the cries of wild geese and cranes fade in and out.\n\n*This concludes Chapter Seventeen of the* Taishang Ganying Pian. *Chapter Eighteen of the* Taishang Ganying Pian *follows.*\n\n**The Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nTo ruin a family and seize its wealth and treasures—this is recorded in the *Biographies*: if such destruction arises unintentionally, the wrong is already no small matter. But if one acts for the sake of wealth and treasures, thereby deliberately ruining a family, it is truly a great evil. Let us recount those who, having once destroyed a family, later restored its property—one or two virtuous deeds—so that those who govern the people in later times, should they encounter such matters, may all act likewise. In this way, those whose families have been ruined may yet find benefit.\n\nWhen Liu Chang governed Yangzhou, the prefecture contained a reservoir called Leibei, originally belonging to the people but later seized by the authorities to store water for the convenience of canal transport. Over the years, the reservoir fell into disrepair, and the canal transport no longer relied upon it. Eventually, it was occupied by the Hao clan, and though the original landowners repeatedly petitioned, they received no redress. Upon taking office, Liu immediately ruled that the land be returned. Thus, thirty-six households—over three hundred men and women—regained their fields and were spared from hunger and want.\n\nWhen Hou Shuxian served as magistrate of Sizhou County, the county contained many confiscated fields. Among them was the estate of Li Cheng, encompassing ten *li* in circumference, with a river flowing through its center—some of the most fertile land in the region. A hundred tenant families, all prosperous clans, had farmed it for generations. The original assessed price of fifteen thousand strings of cash had never been met, and when Jia Weigong held power, he sought to raise the price by another five thousand strings. Chen Daogu, dispatched on official business, arrived to discuss increasing the price with Hou. Hou sighed and said: \"Does the gentleman know the full story of this matter? Li Cheng, during the reign of Emperor Taizu, served as a wine officer. When the goods under his care were damaged by flooding, he was held liable for the loss, assessed at five thousand strings of cash. At the time, the court had allocated funds from the Ministry of Revenue, instructing local officials to purchase materials for arrows, bows, and crossbows in preparation for military needs. When Li Chongjin rebelled and the court prepared to raise troops, the pre-purchased materials failed to arrive. Enraged, Emperor Taizu ordered that all those indebted to the government have their property confiscated. Though Li Cheng had never personally received the funds, the officials, fearing the emperor’s wrath, dared not distinguish his case, and his estate was seized along with the rest. His descendants were thus reduced to ruin. It is regrettable that the prime minister did not correct this injustice and return their land. Would it not be better to reduce the price by five thousand strings, allowing Li’s descendants to repurchase it? The government would still profit handsomely, and Li’s descendants would avoid destitution. What does the gentleman think?\" Chen replied: \"I was truly unaware of these details. If it benefits the people, how could I object?\" Thus, the price was reduced by five thousand strings.\n\nHou then summoned Li Cheng’s descendants and explained the matter. They wept and bowed, saying: \"We are deeply grateful for your kindness, but our family is too poor to afford it.\" Hou next called the tenants together and addressed them: \"You were all once humble households who, by farming Li’s land, have grown prosperous—your granaries full, your families elevated to wealth. Now the government sells this land, and the Li family, impoverished, cannot afford it. If another buys it, they will surely tear down your granaries, dismantle your homes, and drive you from your livelihood. Will you still enjoy such prosperity? Would it not be better for all one hundred households to pool your money, allowing the Li family to repurchase the land? I will then extend your payment deadlines. In this way, the land returns to the Li family, and you retain your tenancy for generations to come—both sides benefit. Does this not seem right?\" The tenants all bowed and said: \"We will do as you say.\" Thus, Li Cheng’s descendants regained their land.\n\nThose who ruin families and seize their wealth and treasures—could they ever act thus? It is a pity they do not comprehend the heavens and hells, for their fate is sealed by such deeds. What delusion drives them to act so?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nA family is built through toil and hardship,\nPassed down through generations, gathering and preserving.\nWho are these bandits and plunderers,\nSeizing what others have amassed?\nThe wolves in power, the tigers of harsh governance,\nLurking in your halls, specters watching at your door.\nThey breach the dikes, set fires,\nTo harm the people’s homes.\nAs the *Biographies* say: floods and flames,\nThe cruelest disasters in the world.\nYet they breach the dikes, set fires,\nTo harm the people’s homes—can their crimes be light?\nThis is why the Perfected Ones above cannot tolerate them,\nAnd the luminous spirits will surely punish them.\n\nIn the second year of Tiansheng, the Yellow River’s embankment at Daming Prefecture suddenly collapsed, and the water surged forth with great force. When Han Weigong governed Beijing, an official rushed to report: \"At the breach, a great turtle has long been the source of trouble. When it lurks beneath the water, the river flows calmly. When it surfaces, the waters flood. Now it has surfaced—what is to be done?\" At that moment, the emissary Zheng Gui, dispatched on a mission, happened to arrive at the office. He shot the turtle dead with a single arrow. Later, the turtle lodged a complaint in the underworld, and King Yama summoned Zheng Gui to face it in judgment. That very day, the Perfected Warrior, the Spiritually Responsive True Lord, descended to Mount Luofeng to review the ledgers of life and death. By his grace, the demonic turtle was exonerated, shattered into dust in midair, so that it could never again harm the people. Zheng Gui was then ordered to be escorted back to the mortal realm by a divine messenger.\n\nIf this is how the gods deal with those who breach dikes, how much more will they punish those who harm the people?\n\nLi Yuan was most filial to his mother. One evening, a traveler arrived seeking lodging. Li was by the stream, boiling a chicken, and the guest assumed it was for his meal. When the rice was served, however, it was coarse and unpolished, and the guest grew furious, refusing to eat before storming out. Li explained: \"My mother is ill and craves meat. Living in the mountains, we have none, so I boiled this chicken for her. I had nothing to offer you.\" The guest’s anger only grew. That night, he crept behind the house, set a fire, and fanned the flames toward Li’s home. Suddenly, the heavens sent rain and reversed the wind, extinguishing the fire.\n\nThe villagers gathered to watch and saw a man lying in the ashes, his torch still clutched in hand. Upon closer inspection, it was the guest, who muttered: \"I am a knight-errant, fleeing here in exile. Never did I expect the master to treat me so. When I set the fire, I clearly saw a great spirit, towering like a divine lord, standing in midair and commanding the flames to reverse. Thus the fire turned back upon me, and now I am dead.\" With these words, he expired.\n\nIs arson, then, permissible?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nOfficials who govern the people, if they act carelessly and shrink from duty—\nFailing to guard against floods is no different from breaching dikes.\nFailing to extinguish fires with vigor is akin to setting them.\nThey ascribe disasters to heaven while shirking human responsibility.\nWhen judging crimes by intent, deeds and thoughts are one.\nTo disrupt another’s plans is to ruin their achievements.\n\nAs the saying goes: When a man establishes merit, though the glory is his own, it is the ancestral temples, the altars of state, and all living beings who truly depend on it. How can the incompetent be allowed to sabotage his designs and rejoice in his failure? Though they may claim to have merely ruined his work, in truth they have undermined the state’s affairs. The consequences are no small matter—can they be without guilt?\n\nDuring the campaign in Huan and Shu, Yang Ye was ordered to assist Pan Mei in the expedition. After reaching the enemy territory and capturing Huan Prefecture, Yang said to Pan: \"The enemy’s forces are at their peak, and our troops are not yet ready for battle. We should lead our army out via the Dashi Road and first dispatch messengers to notify the commanders of Yun and Shu Prefectures. Once our main force departs Daizhou, order them to advance with their troops. When our army reaches Yingzhou, the enemy will surely muster all their strength to resist. At that moment, the officials and people of Shu Prefecture can be gathered into the Shijie Valley, while a thousand strong crossbowmen are stationed to guard the valley’s entrance. All cavalry should be deployed to reinforce the central route. Thus, the forces of the three prefectures will be entirely secure.\"\n\nThe supervising military commissioner Wang Shen obstructed the plan, preventing its execution, and reproached Yang, saying: \"Are your words not born of fear of death?\" Yang replied: \"I do not fear death—proceeding now will mean death. Moreover, I exhort Pan: When I depart, you and the others may claim merit at the valley’s entrance. Divide the troops, with the strong crossbowmen forming the left and right wings to serve as my reinforcement. When I fight my way back here, unleash the soldiers to strike, and we shall surely achieve great victory.\" Pan followed his words and arrayed his forces at the valley’s mouth.\n\nLater, Wang Shen, believing the enemy had already fled and eager to seize the credit, led his troops away. When Yang arrived, he found not a single soldier. Beating his chest, he wept bitterly, then roused himself for a desperate battle. He slew hundreds with his own hand and endured over ten spear wounds. Exhausted, he was captured by the enemy. Refusing food, he died three days later.\n\nHad Wang Shen not obstructed the plan, would success not have been assured? Thus, those who understand this principle know that when entrusted with responsibility, one must first make preparations.\n\nDuring the campaign at Beizhou, Ming Gao served as commander. Many of his military reports and requests were obstructed by the Bureau of Military Affairs chief Xia Song. At the time, Wen Yanbo, serving as assistant minister, was deeply indignant. He personally requested to oversee the battle and petitioned the throne, saying: \"While I am in the field, allow me to act at my discretion without awaiting further approval.\" The emperor granted his request.\n\nUpon arrival, two garrison soldiers, Dong Xiu and Liu Bing, proposed tunneling into the city. Day and night, they dug, hiding in the tunnel by day and disposing of the soil in the water by night. When the tunnel was complete, they emerged in the training grounds. Once out, they scaled the walls, killed the defending officers, and enabled the following troops to ascend by rope. The rebel leader Wang Ze and his followers Zhang Luan and Bu Ji attempted to break out but were routed. Zhang and Bu died in the chaos, while Wang Ze was captured by government forces.\n\nXia Song still insisted the rebels might not be genuine. Only when they were caged and sent to the capital did he fall silent.\n\nHad the assistant minister not made preparations in advance, would success not have been thwarted?\n\nThe eulogy states:\nDu Yu pacified Wu, yet the merit was Yang Hu’s.\nFang Xuanling excelled in strategy, and Du Ruhui always followed.\nOnce their enterprises were established, their fame and achievements soared.\nYet narrow-mindedness, like Qi’s downfall, consumes all.\nThey failed, and what use was it to me?\nTo damage another’s tools to exhaust their use—\nThe *Classic* says: \"To damage another’s tools to exhaust their use.\"\nThe *Taishang Shu* warns against this, for it is also a failure of the heart.\nA failure of the heart is indeed a sin, but some thereby incur great calamity and sow endless enmity—such acts merit the gravest retribution.\nThus, to damage another’s tools to exhaust their use—how can one not beware?\n\nLong ago, the Huayan Master was skilled in the *Huayan Sutra* and delighted in expounding it, earning his name and drawing many followers. He favored fine alms bowls and begging bowls, and his three hundred disciples all emulated him. Among them was a monk whose conduct was unmatched, yet he had fallen ill and remained secluded for months. He possessed a precious glass bowl, which he treasured.\n\nOne day, a visiting monk arrived from afar, lacking a bowl. Someone suggested borrowing the sick monk’s temporarily. At first, the monk refused, but after persistent pleas, he relented, warning earnestly: \"Return it promptly after the meal.\" When the bowl was returned, the visitor soon stumbled, shattering it on the ground. The sick monk flew into a rage, cursing violently, and died shortly after.\n\nYears later, when the Huayan Master moved to Mount Song, both the sick monk’s disciple and the monk who had borrowed the bowl were present. One day, as he was expounding the teachings, a rushing wind and water suddenly arose outside the temple. The master knew what was coming and hastily had the visiting monk sit behind him. Moments later, a great python, nearly ten *zhang* long, glared with bulging eyes and bared fangs as it slithered in. The crowd nearly scattered in panic, but the master restrained them. Brandishing his staff, he restrained the python, saying: \"Among three hundred disciples, your cultivation was the highest. Yet for excessive anger and refusing my teachings, you have come to this. Even now, over a single bowl, do you seek to harm this monk?\"\n\nHe then commanded the assembly to administer the Three Refuges, the Three Reverences, and recite scriptures and mantras to repent and liberate the python. The serpent coiled and departed. The Huayan Master summoned the disciple and said: \"The great python just now was your master. Through kalpas of cultivation, he was on the verge of attaining fruition. But in his final moments, a single outburst of anger brought him to this. Had he not encountered me, he would have devoured that monk—and if he had, he would surely have fallen into hell. From there, how long would his transmigration have lasted?\"\n\nHe then addressed the assembly: \"Tomorrow, after the cremation of the deceased monk behind the mountain, you will find that the great python has already died, its skull shattered.\" After the cremation, the Huayan Master summoned the disciple again and said: \"Next year, your master will be reborn as a girl in the Pei family. When the birth is difficult, he will grow enraged and harm his mother, deepening his karmic burden. When the time comes, hasten to save her. Call his name and relay my words—then no harm will come.\" And so it came to pass.\n\nAlas! Even those who cultivate the Way—if a single moment of inevitability brings them to such a state—how much worse for those who do not cultivate at all? When anger arises, it is because the heart harbors poisonous intent.\n\nIn praise it is said:\n*To fashion vessels, one models after images—*\n*Thus the Changes are consulted.*\n*But if one follows private wisdom,*\n*Standards are thrown into chaos.*\n*Weights and measures, scales and rules—*\n*The craftsman alters them at will.*\n*Such deceit and deception*\n*Are worse than outright destruction.*\n*When the people have no standard,*\n*Is this not a vicious power?*\n\nTo see others prosperous and noble and wish for their downfall—\n\nThe *Records* state: The common people comprise four classes—scholars, farmers, artisans, and merchants. Yet those who attain prosperity and nobility stand above them all. Blessings, too, are of five kinds—wealth, longevity, health and peace, love of virtue, and a timely end. And those who attain prosperity and nobility stand above them as well. How, then, could such a station be reached by mere chance? It is only because they have long planted the roots of virtue that they come to this. Those who have not reached such heights—how could they rashly harbor resentment and jealousy, wishing for their ruin?\n\nIn the early years of the dynasty, when Lu Duoxun was exiled to Zhuhai, Li Fu said to the Grand Councilor Zhao Pu: \"Though Zhuhai lies beyond the sea, its climate and terrain are not so harsh. Chunzhou, though within the realm, is a place from which none return alive. Why not exile him to Chunzhou instead? Outwardly, this would appear a lenient sentence from the court, yet in truth, it would consign him to certain death.\" Zhao Pu did not reply. Soon after, Li Fu himself was implicated in a crime and exiled to Xuanzhou. The emperor’s wrath had not yet subsided when Zhao Pu presented Li Fu’s words to the throne. That very day, Li Fu’s sentence was changed to exile in Chunzhou. He arrived at his post and died within ten days.\n\nWhen Minister Kou was demoted, Ding Wei bore much of the responsibility. When the matter of his place of exile was first discussed, Ding Wei and Feng Zheng were both in the Grand Council. As Ding Wei took up the brush to draft the edict, he turned to Feng Zheng and said: \"I had intended to exile him to Yazhou, but feared the perilous journey across the whale-infested waves. So I settled on Leizhou instead.\" Soon after, Ding Wei himself was implicated in a crime and faced exile. Feng Zheng was still in the Grand Council and happened to be drafting the edict. Smiling, he said to Zeng Shen: \"The Crane Chancellor once wished to exile Minister Kou to Yazhou, lamenting the dangers of the whale-infested seas. Now, he may trouble the Chancellor to make that journey himself.\" And so, Ding Wei was exiled to Yazhou.\n\nThus, to see others prosperous and noble and wish for their downfall—can this be right?\n\nA Eulogy says:\nRank and title come by chance, not true worth to see.\nLike flowers in their beds, watered from jars they be.\nPure in wind and dew, scattered in mist and rain,\nFlourishing or withering in a fleeting span—how worth holding dear?\nWith such thoughts in mind, envy melts like ice clear.\nTo see others wealthy and wish their ruin near—\n\nIt is told: The Twentieth Patriarch, Śayata, asked the Nineteenth Patriarch, Kumāralāta, “My family has long upheld the Three Jewels, yet we are constantly afflicted by illness. All our endeavors come to naught. Meanwhile, our neighbors, who have long practiced *yogācāra*, enjoy robust health and success in all they do. Why are they so fortunate, and what wrong have we done?”\n\nKumāralāta replied, “The retribution of good and evil unfolds in three times. People see only the virtuous die young and the wicked live long, fortune favor the perverse and misfortune the righteous, and so they dismiss cause and effect as empty, karma and its fruits as false. Yet they do not know that echo follows sound, shadow follows form—even the slightest deviation remains unerring. Though a hundred thousand kalpas may pass, it is never erased.”\n\nŚayata’s doubts were instantly dispelled.\n\nKumāralāta continued, “Though you have faith, you have not yet attained clarity. *Karma* arises from delusion, perception from conditioning, perception from unawareness, and unawareness from the mind. The mind is fundamentally pure—without birth or extinction, without creation or cessation, without retribution or victory or defeat. It is still, it is luminous. If you enter this gate of the Dharma, you may become one with all Buddhas.”\n\nAlas! Can those who see others wealthy and wish their ruin comprehend this?\n\nEven if the wealthy are unvirtuous, their downfall will come in due time—yet one must not harbor the thought of wishing their ruin.\n\nZhou Yifu of Hong County was immensely wealthy, dominating his region and acting with great arrogance. A man from a neighboring prefecture, Sun Shizhi, once gently admonished him. Yifu flew into a rage, cursing, “What does a little ghost like you know? How dare you meddle in my affairs!”\n\nLater, when Shizhi passed the imperial examinations and became the transport commissioner of his circuit, Yifu still raged, “Even if he’s a surveillance commissioner, what can he do to me?”\n\nOne day, Shizhi conducted an inspection in Hong County. Just then, Yifu was beating a man in the marketplace, and the victim lodged a complaint. Shizhi subtly encouraged the man to report Yifu’s lawless acts. That very day, he sent the case to the authorities for investigation. Before long, the ringleader died in prison. After deliberation, the officials memorialized the throne, transferring the case to another prefecture. Yifu was ultimately sentenced to death for conspiracy to murder, and his descendants were registered as government bondsmen. Within a few years, Shizhi was transferred to serve as transport commissioner in Hebei. At the time, war had broken out, and his entire family perished at the hands of the invaders. Their ruin was no different from Yifu’s—was this not retribution?\n\nQian Ruoshui served as an assistant magistrate in Tong Prefecture. A wealthy family lost a young servant girl, and her mother and grandfather filed a complaint. The prefecture ordered the registrar to investigate. The registrar had once sought a favor from the wealthy family but was refused, so he falsely accused them of father and son jointly murdering the servant girl and throwing her body into the water. The case was submitted to the prefecture, and the officials who reviewed it found no discrepancies. Only Ruoshui doubted the verdict and steadfastly refused to sign. He even spent his own money to secretly send men to search for the servant girl. Eventually, they found her, and the family was exonerated. Had they not encountered Ruoshui, the wealthy family might have met the same fate as Yifu.\n\nIn my humble view, not only did the wealthy family owe him gratitude, but the registrar did as well. Had the wealthy family died, could the registrar have lived in peace?\n\nA Eulogy says:\nA dragon-prowed ship may carry ten thousand *hu*—\nYet even such might, in time, meets its due.\n\nA single leaf may stir the waves,\nwhile piled feathers still capsize a boat.\nThe roc and the wren roam at ease,\neach content in its own desire.\nTheir capacities differ, yet each finds sufficiency in its allotted portion.\nInner fire burns one from within,\nas if drinking poisoned wine.\nSeeing another’s beauty—be it form or dwelling—\none stirs the mind to covet it.\n\nThe scripture says: In the cycle of birth and death,\nthere is no escape—\nall arises from the Five Aggregates,\nall arises from the Five Skandhas.\nThe principle is the same;\nonly the translators’ renderings differ slightly in wording.\n\nWhat are the Five Aggregates?\nClearly distinguished, the first is *form*;\nreceiving and accepting in the mind, the second is *sensation*;\nthe mind contemplating this principle, the third is *perception*;\nacting upon this principle, the fourth is *mental formations*;\ndefiling the true nature, the fifth is *consciousness*.\n\nWhat are the Five Skandhas?\nComposed of the four great elements, the first is *form*;\nreceiving pleasure, pain, or neither, the second is *sensation*;\ngrasping various objects, the third is *perception*;\nall mental states, impoverished yet ceaseless, the fourth is *mental formations*;\ndiscerning the nature of objects of perception—also called mind or intention—\ngathered by accumulation, the fifth is *consciousness*.\n\nAll worldly people, deluded by sounds and forms,\ngenerate confusion and attachment—\nnone are free from this.\nHad they awakened to the emptiness of form,\nwould they have come to this?\n\nFormerly, when Zhang Bao governed Chengdu,\nthere was a Hua Yang constable named Li,\nwhose wife was of unmatched beauty,\nrenowned throughout Shu.\nBao desired her in secret.\nDuring the Lantern Festival, when men and women went out to roam,\nhe sent men to watch her comings and goings,\nthen disguised himself to steal a glance.\nAt first sight, he confirmed her peerless beauty.\nThereupon, he enlisted nuns and female attendants to convey his intentions.\nAt first, the wife firmly refused,\nbut over time, she seemed to waver.\nBefore long, Constable Li was charged with corruption.\nBao impeached him before the court and had him sent to prison for interrogation.\nOnce convicted, Li was exiled beyond the southern mountains\nand died on the road.\nBao then lavished gifts upon the constable’s mother\nand forced the wife into marriage.\nFor the wife had long harbored resentment toward her husband,\nand now she willingly complied.\nBao, overjoyed at gaining her,\nfound her fully compliant in return.\nThey delighted in each other, inseparable day and night.\nBefore long, the wife fell ill,\nand in her delirium, she constantly saw Constable Li by her side.\nSoon after, she died.\nBao also fell ill.\nIn a dream, his wife told him:\n*“Though I am grateful for your kindness and dare not repay it with ingratitude,\nLi has already appealed to Heaven.\nYour time is near.\nIf you remain secluded, you may not be easily seized,\nbut should you venture out lightly, you will surely be taken.”*\n\nOne evening as he sat, he saw from afar a crimson sleeve beckoning from among the bamboo beneath the hall—he took it to be the constable’s wife. Forgetting her warning, he rushed toward it in haste. Upon arriving, it was the constable who struck and cursed him: *“You thief! Had I not beckoned you with the red sleeve, would you have come?”* After a long while, blood flowed from his mouth and nose, and he collapsed dead upon the ground.\n\nThus we know that to harbor secret desire is the way of men, yet to silently consent is the nature of women. Had she not lightly yielded and so brought this disaster upon him, would it not have been better to hold firm in resolve and, in this life, pass through this one retribution-body?\n\nIn his youth, Yan Wu lived next door to a military commander. The commander had a daughter of great beauty, whom Wu secretly admired. By every means he lured her to his home, and together they fled. Later, the commander learned of this and submitted a petition to the throne. An edict was issued, and an imperial envoy dispatched to arrest them. Fearing punishment, Wu got the girl drunk one night, removed the strings from her pipa, and strangled her with them before sinking her body in the water. The next day, when the envoy arrived, nothing could be found. Thus he escaped punishment.\n\nWhen Yan Wu fell ill in Shu, he clearly saw the girl appear before him and reproach him, saying: \"Though my following you was indeed improper conduct, I bore you no true ill will. Even if you feared punishment, why not abandon me and flee, rather than kill me? You are truly a cruel man. I have already lodged my complaint with Heaven, and the appointed time is tomorrow.\" Overcome with shame and dread, Wu begged for his life, yet at dawn the following day, he indeed died. From this we may further understand: women who possess even slight beauty often meet such ends. Had she remained steadfast in resolve, her will as unyielding as ice and snow, could he have seduced her, even if he wished to? Thus I speak with absolute certainty: though the impulse to seduce arises from the man, the tacit consent that permits it comes from the woman.\n\nIn places of leisure and pleasure, between walls and partitions, one must be ever vigilant.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nZixia said, \"Virtue is easily displaced by desire for beauty.\"\nThe teachings of the ancient sages always urged, \"Cherish virtue.\"\nA wise woman’s beauty may topple a city—yet she is the thief of true virtue.\nWhen the heart loses its proper course, it descends into madness and delusion.\nTo debase one’s will and disgrace one’s body—all from a single misguided thought.\n\n*Here ends Scroll Eighteen of the* **Taishang Ganying Pian**\n*Scroll Nineteen of the* **Taishang Ganying Pian** *begins*\n\n**The Tale of Li Changling, with Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nTo covet another’s goods and wealth, to wish another’s death—such is the way of the wicked.\n\n**Account:**\nLi Yue served as Vice Minister of War. Once, while traveling by boat, his vessel drew alongside that of a foreign merchant. The merchant suddenly fell gravely ill and summoned Yue to his side. Upon arriving, Yue was bequeathed a luminous pearl, along with the care of the merchant’s two daughters—both of surpassing beauty. The next day, the merchant died, leaving behind tens of thousands in treasure. Every soul aboard the vessel cast covetous eyes upon it. Yet Yue meticulously cataloged the wealth and entrusted it to the authorities. He arranged for one daughter to be wed, then prepared the merchant’s body for burial. As he did so, he secretly placed the luminous pearl in the merchant’s mouth, unseen by all. Later, when the merchant’s kin arrived to claim the fortune, Yue requested the officials to open the coffin. There lay the pearl, and all who witnessed it marveled at his integrity.\n\nWei Zidu was traveling at dusk when he encountered a scholar collapsed by the roadside, clutching his chest in agony. Zidu dismounted and tended to him, but the scholar soon died. Searching his belongings, Zidu found a scroll of plain silk and ten ingots of gold. He sold two ingots to cover the funeral costs, then placed the remaining eight beneath the scholar’s head and laid the silk scroll beside him. Years later, a man inquired of Zidu about the scholar’s burial site. Zidu led him to the grave, and upon exhumation, both the gold and the scroll were found untouched. From that day forth, Zidu’s reputation resounded far and wide.\n\nThese are the noble deeds of our forebears, recorded in the annals of history, their brilliance dazzling the eyes and ears of all who hear them. Such conduct is far beyond the reach of those who covet another’s wealth and wish another’s death.\n\nYet even so, let us recount these few examples, that all may take heed.\n\nIn Yongjia, there lived a merchant named Xu Hui. Once, in Danyang, he borrowed over a thousand strings of cash from a wealthy broker. Before he could repay the debt, the broker died, and Xu kept silent. The broker’s family, unaware of the loan, never sought repayment.\n\nLater, Hui fathered a son, remarkably bright and clever, whom he cherished deeply. At the age of eight, the boy fell ill, and Hui summoned physicians and purchased medicines, spending beyond measure. Though his wealth was exhausted, the child’s illness showed no sign of abating. One day, as the boy lay sick, he suddenly spoke to Hui’s close acquaintance, the nun Shi: “I wish to return home.” The nun replied, “This is your home. Your parents love you so—where else would you go?” The boy said, “I am from Danyang. Long ago, Master Xu borrowed a thousand strings of cash from me, and when I died, he never repaid the debt. Now I have come to be reborn in his household to reclaim what is mine.” With these words, he passed away.\n\nThere was also Bai Yuantong, who once owed five strings and four hundred coins to Yang Jun of the Eastern Market. Before he could repay the debt, Jun died suddenly, and Yuantong concealed the matter. After his death, he was reborn in Jun’s family as a donkey. One day, Jun’s son rode the donkey to the market, when it suddenly spoke in a human voice: “I am Bai Yuantong. I owed your father five strings and four hundred coins, and this is my retribution. Now, the bran-seller in the Southern Market owes me the same amount. Sell me to him at once, and with the money you receive, settle your father’s debt.” Jun’s son did as instructed, and two days later, the donkey died.\n\nCan those who covet another’s wealth and wish another’s death ever escape their fate?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWu Zixu repaid kindness, casting gold into the river’s rapids.\nJi Zha honored his vow, hanging his sword upon a tomb’s tree.\nThough their fates differed, their hearts never wavered.\nEntrusting life and orphans, their names endure through integrity.\nBut those who deceive the dead are as filth to flies and gnats—\ntheir schemes unfulfilled, they curse and resent.\nAs the saying goes: “Those who know no shame pursue only gain, save for men of principle.\nIf, when their demands go unmet, they immediately curse and resent, they are the basest of men.”\nHow could they grasp Han Changli’s teaching on self-accountability and forbearance toward others,\nor Fan Zhongxuan’s principle of holding others to the same standard one holds oneself?\n\nChangli said: “The noble man examines himself strictly and thoroughly;\nin dealing with others, he is lenient and forgiving.\nStrict and thorough, he never falters;\nlenient and forgiving, others delight in doing good.”\n\nZhongxuan said: “All my life, I have studied but two words—loyalty and forbearance—\nand they have never failed me, whether serving at court, attending to my lord,\ninteracting with colleagues, or fostering kinship.\nI once warned my descendants: ‘Even the dullest man is sharp when judging others;\neven the wisest grows dim when excusing himself.\nIf you can judge yourself as you judge others, and forgive others as you forgive yourself,\nyou will not fail to reach the realm of sages and worthies.’”\nDo those who clamor for gain understand this?\n\nIn this world, few indeed refrain from grasping hands outstretched for favors.\nLet me recount a few more examples, that all may feel shame.\n\nDirector Hu Bao of the Ministry of Justice once told others: “When I served as magistrate of Wu County in Suzhou, many scholar-officials resided there, and none failed to make requests of me. Only the retired Grand Supervisor Fu Yan, though living in Suzhou for three years, never once imposed upon me.”\n\nSenior Academician Qiu Shunqing also said: “When I governed Xinjian County in Hongzhou, the powerful clans of the region often interfered with official affairs. Only the retired Director Wang Shu, though living in poverty and seclusion, his clothing and food insufficient, never once sought help from others.”\n\nThese two gentlemen’s integrity and virtue surpass others—how worthy they are!\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nThe heart free of desire is like still water.\nOnce a single plea arises, waves and surges erupt.\nGaze upon their compliance or refusal—\nit stirs my love or resentment.\nSlightly thwart their wishes,\nand grievance and anger mount.\nWhy not reflect instead,\ndesire restrained, wrath quelled?\n\nSee another’s misstep,\nand at once proclaim their fault.\nAs the saying goes: “If a man by chance suffers misfortune,\nit is his calamity—how can one then speak of his fault?”\nTo speak of his fault is to delight in misfortune,\nto rejoice in disaster.\nYet the Most High has clearly warned against such conduct—\nhow can this be permissible?\n\nLong ago, when He Shenxi was about to receive his appointment,\nhe suddenly fell ill and died.\nHis wife wept in grief,\nuntil her sister-in-law, a woman surnamed Zhao, interrupted:\n“Your husband, in life, frequented the pleasure quarters,\ntreating you as if you did not exist.\nWhy grieve so?”\nFrom that moment, the wife’s sorrow ceased, and she no longer mourned.\n\nOne night, Zhao dreamed of Shenxi, who said:\n“Life and death are fated—how can you mock another?\nYou have but four years left,\nand your death will be worse than mine.”\nZhao awoke in terror.\nWhen the time came, it proved true:\nat her death, her husband was far away, her two young sons foolish and helpless—\ntruly, worse than his fate.\n\nLi Xiong was most learned in letters,\ndevoted in filial piety, and swift in action,\npraised by all in his village.\nThen, struck by illness,\na single misprescribed dose proved fatal.\nThough his wife was with child, the child had not yet been born.\nHis family, stricken with grief, knew not what to do.\nHis brother-in-law, He Shi, then proclaimed abroad:\n“This gentleman always claimed to manage affairs well—\nnow let him manage this for me.”\nThose who heard this thought little of his character.\nThe following year, He Shi himself died.\n\nThus, is it right to speak of another’s misfortune?\nAre we ourselves truly without fault?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nA single misstep by Mengming ultimately led Qin to hegemony. Forty-nine faults did Yu rectify, yet each day he renewed himself. A stumble in half a step is no grounds to judge a man. To cast stones upon him—how could this not be cruelty? This is called delighting in misfortune, and calamity will befall one’s own person.\n\nTo laugh at another for an incomplete or flawed physique—\nAs the tradition records: Duke Jin sent Xi Chou to summon an assembly in Qi, and Duke Qing of Qi had women concealed behind curtains to observe. Xi ascended the hall, and the women laughed. Xi grew enraged. In the second year of Duke Cheng, this led to Qi’s invasion.\n\nWhen Guo Ziyi fell gravely ill, officials came to inquire after him in an unbroken stream. His concubines filled the chamber, yet he never sent them away. But when Lu Si arrived, he dismissed them all. Asked the reason, Ziyi replied: “That man is ugly in appearance but treacherous within. If my attendants see him, they will surely mock and humiliate him. One day, should he gain power, not a soul of my clan will remain.” Ziyi’s discernment was profound—how far removed from Duke Qing’s!\n\nAgain, like the beauty of Lord Pingyuan who laughed at the hunchbacked servant hobbling to fetch water and had him executed; or the man of Zhao County who mocked Mengchang Jun as a puny husband and was put to death. These are overturned carts before one’s path—warnings to heed, yet few awaken to them.\n\nA person’s standing rests upon their capacity and insight, not upon their physique. Though their form may be flawed, if their capacity and insight are abundant, how can they be slighted?\n\nOf old, Lu Xie’s appearance was unremarkable, his speech unclear—his name *Xie* was mocked as *Hui* (“broom”), for his tongue was short. Once, he presented a composition to Minister Wei Zhou, whose sons and nephews openly ridiculed him. Wei Zhou said: “Though Lu’s person is unremarkable, his writing has beginning and end. One day, he will rise high.” Later, Lu indeed passed the examinations, swiftly ascending to the halls of governance, promoting officials in the capital, and becoming the Fujian observer.\n\nWang Yigong Qinruo was gaunt and ungainly, his manner rustic, with a growth upon his neck. Once, he presented a composition to Qian Gong Xibai, who looked upon him with disdain. By chance, a diviner was present, who exclaimed in astonishment: “This is a man of the highest nobility—how can he be slighted?” Qian Gong asked: “In my hall, could such a one become chief minister?” The diviner replied: “It may not be long.” Within a few years, he indeed rose to the position of grand councilor.\n\nSun Wenyi Gong was likewise unprepossessing in appearance. Once, traveling to the capital for the examinations, he sought a certificate from the county to sell his fields. The magistrate’s aide, Li Zhaoyan, jested: “How many men like you are there?” That year, Wenyi ranked third in the examinations. Within a few years, he became a judge of the Bureau of Appointments. By then, Zhaoyan was himself arriving for his official posting. At first sight, he was overcome with shame and returned home.\n\nLord Hou Yuan’gong was likewise homely and ungainly in appearance. When first recommended among fellow provincials, his advanced age and plain looks drew little respect. Some frivolous youths made a paper kite, painted his likeness upon it, and flew it aloft by its string. Yuan’gong happened to see it and laughed heartily. He composed a *Linjiangxian* lyric and inscribed it on the kite:\n\n*Who would believe my hidden worth before success?*\n*Now my name remains unproclaimed, my talents unmarked.*\n*Yet some skilled hand has limned my form—*\n*Catching the wind, lightly borrowing its force,*\n*I soar at once into the highest heavens.*\n\n*Once the breath of praise begins to steady me,*\n*I seem to fly straight to the moon’s palace.*\n*After rain, the evening sun glows red;*\n*How many stand on level ground*\n*While I gaze down from the azure vault?*\n\nThat same year he passed the examinations and rose to the rank of chief minister.\n\nWas it not laughable, then, to judge by mere physical form?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe sage fulfills his form, not by outward appearance.\nHe who venerates the feet fears only blindness of heart.\nTo scorn what one does not know may cost one a Ziyu.\nFair of face and tall of stature, the wise clan aids them.\nIf a finger falls short of others, why must one despise it?\nTo see another’s talent as worthy yet suppress it—\n\nAs the tradition says: “To see another’s talent as worthy yet suppress it—this is the petty man’s envy of those ahead, not what a noble man would dare do.”\n\nWhen Minister Wang Wengong Dan was long ill and unable to recover, the emperor ordered a palanquin to bring him into the palace to offer encouragement, repeatedly asking: “If, heaven forbid, you should pass, to whom should I entrust the affairs of the realm?” The minister replied: “In my humble opinion, none would be better than Kou Zhun.” The emperor said: “But what of his harshness and narrowness?” The minister replied: “If it were another, I would not presume to know.” Zhun was then elevated to high office.\n\nWhen Minister Lü Shen’gong sought retirement, the emperor said: “Since you cannot be kept, whom may I appoint in your stead?” The minister replied: “If Your Majesty must employ a brilliant and far-sighted talent, I cannot presume to know. But if you seek one to entrust with the weight of age, to stabilize all measures, to understand the hardships of the realm—none surpasses Yao Zuo.” Chen was then elevated to high office.\n\nMinister of War Qian Ruoshui delighted in drawing scholars to him, tirelessly and without weariness. Many of the younger generation emerged from his gate.\n\nMinister Ouyang Wenzhong Xiu was ever eager to advance worthy men, never harboring envy or a competitive spirit.\n\nWhen Attendant Censor Miao Shizhong served as Vice Minister of Revenue, he investigated the equal-fields and corvée systems in the Zizhou Circuit. Upon completing his report, he submitted it and recommended over ten capable officials, all of whom were later promoted.\n\nMinister Du Qigong Yan, having governed prefectures and overseen circuits as pacification commissioner, whenever he encountered men of literary talent, administrative skill, exceptional conduct, or peerless virtue—even if he had never met them—never failed to recommend them according to their abilities.\n\nCensor Sun Bian and Tang Jie were both reinstated to office, though they had never met. Hearing only of Jie’s firm integrity, Bian forcefully recommended him. When Jie became a censor, both displayed resolute strength.\n\nMinister Zhang Shugong and Minister Wen Lugong had never met, but hearing of Lugong’s magnanimity, Shugong, upon their first meeting, vigorously recommended him. Later, Lugong served as both general and chief minister, proving himself truly exceptional.\n\nPrefect Zhang Zhongding Yong and Zhang Xiyan had never been heard of, but when Palace Attendant Fan Yangui reported that under Xiyan’s administration, bridges, roads, post stations, and courier relays were all well-maintained; fields were reclaimed; no farmers neglected their work; gambling dens were shuttered; markets were free of disputes; and the night watches were clearly marked—Yong laughed and said: “Xiyan is certainly a capable official, and Heaven too favors good officials.” That very day he recommended both, and later each won acclaim.\n\nCould any of these gentlemen have suppressed talent?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nHeaven brings forth talent to serve the world.\nWhat is prized in those who have already achieved is their exaltation and encouragement of those who follow.\nQi Xi recommended his enemy; Youfu promoted the overlooked.\nThrough this, governance was established, and the nation’s affairs were brought to fruition.\nThose who envy the worthy and resent ability seldom avoid inviting calamity.\nTo bury the virtuous and suppress others—\n\nAs the tradition states: According to the *Laws of Xuandu*, exceeding two thousand seven hundred transgressions constitutes a single harm. Those who cause harm will see their households produce male and female shamans.\nThus, to be born as a shaman is already the consequence of one’s past life.\nIf one, having already incurred sin in this life, is born again as a human and once more buries the virtuous or suppresses others, this only compounds their transgressions. When they fall in the future, how could it compare to the suffering of this present life?\nOne must know that to sink into the Three Evil Realms is as swift as an arrow—truly, this is what is meant by \"alas, woe!\"\n\nFormerly, Ji Nanshou, prefect of Jianzhou, was summoned to the netherworld to adjudicate a yin case.\nThe case involved Wang Zicheng, a shaman from Xizhou, who had dispatched ghostly soldiers to slaughter two young members of Gao Zhen’s household and to kill several cattle belonging to Zhang Yuan’s family.\nNanshou, judging solely by the statutes, ruled:\nWang Zicheng wantonly practiced wicked arts, harming living people and livestock alike. He is to be punished with an iron rod across the spine and sent to the Avīci Hell to endure all manner of suffering.\nOnce his sentence in Avīci is complete, he shall be reborn as a lonely spirit among the outer paths, and his entire family—children and descendants—shall all be cast into ruin.\nAll his lineage shall be utterly obliterated.\n\nYet can one truly bury curses to harm others? Those who conceive such malice and compel others to enact it bear a guilt even heavier than the sorcerer’s. According to the *Record of Strange Phenomena*, when the soldier Lü Yongzhi was executed, his central hall was searched, and a stone casket was found. Inside lay a copper figurine, nearly three feet tall, its body bound in shackles, its mouth pierced by a long nail, its back inscribed with Gao Pian’s native village, official rank, surname, and given name—all part of a *yasheng* curse. Thus was Gao Pian ever constrained by Yongzhi’s machinations.\n\nAlas! If Gao Pian was already under Yongzhi’s control, why then did Yongzhi meet his own execution? Know this: burying curses to harm others may not truly harm them, but only hastens one’s own calamity. Beware!\n\n**Eulogy:**\nSorcery and curses arose,\nNearly extinguishing Han’s light.\nTrusting in heretical ways,\nTheir ruin burned fierce and bright.\nChuan Yi tested spells—\nThe foreign monk fell in defeat.\nNing clung to ghostly soldiers—\nHe died in Yue’s retreat.\nArrows loosed recoil,\nSelf-inflicted is the debt.\nTo poison trees with potions—\nThe *Highest Writ* warns against it,\nLest living things be hurt.\n\nThus did Xin Ling nurture herbs and trees to attain immortality, and Gao Chai, who never broke a blade of grass, earned Confucius’ special praise for his conduct. Yet if one poisons trees with potions, does one not incur guilt? Have we not heard of the Iba Dragon King, who damaged leaves and fell into the dragon realm, or the Taiyi Cave Dragon, who in fury harmed crops and was reborn as a horse?\n\nThe Great Dao cherishes life; even a single being must not be wantonly harmed, let alone trees, for within them may dwell sages. As the *Water Classic* records, Yi Yin was born from a hollow mulberry. Some, having erred in their cultivation, find their spirits lodged within trees, as the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution* tells of Han Yuanshou transformed into a tree spirit. Others harbor consciousness no different from humans, like the pine root encountered by Qian Shiyu. Still others, who steal trees and invite disaster, are first known to the tree spirits, as with Qian Renkang’s theft of the peony.\n\nOf these many accounts, let us set them aside for now. Consider only the cases of Qian Shiyu and Qian Renkang—may all take heed and be warned.\n\nIn former times, at the Flying Hall of Eastern Gorge Mountain, there stood an ancient pine. During the Daguan era, a retainer of the Imperial City Commissioner Qian Shiyu struck its roots with an axe, and sap flowed forth in abundance. The following year, Palace Attendant Qian Ji passed by the temple and dreamed at night of an old man who said to him: \"Though I am not one of those round-headed and square-footed beings, I am a plant imbued with spiritual essence. Yesterday, Qian Shiyu’s man struck my knee with an axe, taking my sap to use as candle wax, and even now my blood still flows. I beg you to inform the abbot, that he may swiftly mend my wound, so I may not be shaken by blind winds and thus fulfill my allotted years—I would be deeply indebted.\" At dawn, Ji set out in haste and failed to notify the abbot, but upon meeting Magistrate Qian Lu, he recounted the dream. Lu went to the temple to inspect the tree and found it just as Ji had described. He promptly had the wound sealed with lacquer.\n\nThe residence of Military Inspector and Minister of Works Qian Renkang adjoined that of the Central Army Captain Marshal Jin Zhao. In Zhao’s garden grew a peony, which each year bore no fewer than three hundred blossoms, their petals crimson as blood, their edges gilded like gold, and atop each stem, the calyx bore silken veins, every one resembling a natural butterfly—truly a marvel of its kind. Whenever the flowers bloomed, Zhao would host a feast, and Renkang was always invited to attend. One night, Renkang drank heavily, brandished his sword, stripped to his undergarments, slung a large basket on his back, and dagger at his waist, leapt over the wall, and stole the peony away. Zhao remained unaware. As he was stealing the plant, a voice sounded from the air, faint as a bee’s hum: *\"Three hundred blossoms on a single stem, / Smiling in the spring breeze. / Next year in the third month, / Each petal shall be a crimson of heartbreak.\"* The following year, when the flowers bloomed, Zhao once more held a feast, and Renkang again attended. At the sight of the peony, he flew into a rage. Upon returning home, he slit his own belly and died, fulfilling the verse spoken at the time of the theft.\n\nAlas! Renkang perished for the sake of a flower, for the spirit had foreseen his fate even as he stole it. If such is the case, can one then recklessly use potions to kill trees?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*Virtue extended to grasses and trees—*\n*Thus the royal enterprise of Zhou arose.*\n\nAt dawn’s misty ascent, poets conceal their hidden sorrows.\nHeaven and earth bring forth life—where harmonious qi roams.\nTo harm without cause is no different from severing a ditch’s flow.\nThe sacred oak appeared in dreams, its parable no idle tale.\n\n*The Nineteenth Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response* concludes here.\n\n---\n\n**The Twenty-First Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response**\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nRewards and punishments are not impartial.\nThe tradition states: According to the *Great Treasury*, when heaven and earth first parted, there were already men and women.\nTo sustain life, each coveted accumulation.\nThrough accumulation, they began to encroach and steal.\nTo prevent theft, they collectively chose one.\nThe wise established him as king, to administer rewards and punishments, calling it equity.\nThus, the use of rewards and punishments is not a matter of today.\n\nOf old, the elder Wang was most courageous. He often lamented that rewards and punishments were unjust, leaving him to grow old in the ranks. Whenever he heard of strange or monstrous affairs, he would clench his fists and gnash his teeth, longing to eradicate them. Having long heard of the numinous wonders of the Guardian Sage Perfected Lord, he sought to leave the mortal register, daily offering incense and fire. Morning and evening, he would bow twice before the hall, crying out in a loud voice: *\"I cannot abide injustice. Now I am old, and when my body dies, I wish to serve at your side, ready to be commanded.\"* The Perfected Lord granted his request.\n\nYears after his death, when a ritual feast was held in the hall, a voice suddenly sounded from the air: *\"Why not summon my Daoist?\"* Zhang Shouzhen said: *\"Beneath the Perfected Lord, only four attendants have ever been venerated. What deity are you? I beg you to reveal your name.\"* After a moment, the voice spoke again: *\"I am the elder Wang of former days. The Perfected Lord has taken me in, appointing me to wield the iron wheel, my rank below the Four Generals. In future rites, do not forget me.\"*\n\nAlas! Wang made his vow thus, and the Perfected Lord’s acceptance was thus—who can say that unjust rewards and punishments escape the knowledge of the Perfected on High? Generally, rewards encourage merit, while punishments chastise evil. Without rewards and punishments, how can one encourage or chastise? This is why the Supreme One inscribed them in the scripture, and why the Perfected Lord took in Wang.\n\nLet me recount one or two more examples, that those who wield military authority hereafter may know what to emulate.\n\nDuring the campaign against Liu Xu, soldiers vied to carry severed heads, seeking rewards. Chancellor Bao said: *\"In the heat of battle, who has time to claim heads? These must have been cut from the dead afterward. Who knows whose they are?\"* Duan Lun replied: *\"Your Excellency’s words are truly divine.\"* At the time, Duan served as vanguard, and those who charged into the enemy’s ranks were all wounded. The commander-in-chief had already ordered them to report to camp for commendation. The chancellor said: *\"Bring them all here.\"* When they arrived, he first recorded the merits of those who had fought valiantly, then those who bore heads. Thereupon, the army’s morale soared, deeming the rewards and punishments perfectly just, and they rejoiced as one.\n\nDuring the Ganling campaign, only the Ding troops clamored for rewards, their resentment nearly erupting in protest beneath the city walls. At the time, Han Wei Gong commanded the army. Applying military law, he identified those who had caused disorder and could not be disciplined, dragging them to the camp gate to be beheaded. For soldiers who died in battle, he generously compensated their families, providing for their orphans and ensuring their sustenance. With trust in both grace and authority, the troops’ morale redoubled.\n\nCan rewards and punishments, then, be anything but impartial?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nRewards and punishments lie with Heaven—blessing the good, calamity the wicked.\nRewards and punishments lie with man—steadfast as stone and metal.\nThey bring it upon themselves; why should I bear the burden?\nIf chastisement and encouragement are misapplied, chaos and ruin follow.\nClear proof and great verification are recorded in ancient and modern times.\n\n---\n\n**Excessive Pleasure**\n\nThe tradition states: The Venerable Monk Zhigong and Emperor Wu of Liang discussed matters of pleasure. The monk requested the emperor to bring forth several condemned prisoners to test his theory. Thereupon, he ordered the prisoners each to hold a full cup of water and walk around the courtyard. He warned: *\"If not a drop spills, I shall spare your lives.\"* Then he commanded music to be played, to stir their hearts. After a long while, he observed them—none had spilled a drop.\n\nThe emperor then sighed and asked, *\"Did you hear the music?\"*\nThey replied, *\"We did not.\"*\nThe master said, *\"They were only afraid of death, trembling lest the water spill—how could they hear the music? If Your Majesty were likewise, ever mindful of awe and dread, then the heart of excessive pleasure would naturally not arise.\"*\n\nMaster Huìyuǎn said to Magistrate Zhang Mi, *\"Adversity is easy to endure; prosperity is hard to endure. When things run counter to my wishes, I need only bear with them for a moment, and the trial passes. But when all goes smoothly, every matter aligns with my desires, leaving no escape. It is like a lodestone meeting a needle—unaware, unknowing, they inevitably draw together. If even insensate things behave so, how much more we, who are sentient, whose whole lives are bound up in the snares of emotion?\"*\n\nThe words of these two masters may be called perfect. Generally, when a person dwells in prosperity, the heart knows no fear, and in excessive pleasure, one cannot avoid fault.\n\nLong ago, Jiǎng Xīlǔ governed Chengdu. Among the courtesans in the register was one named Chén Fèngyí, whose beauty and skill surpassed all others. Xīlǔ cherished her deeply. At every feast, she never left his side, and for this he drew censure, which reached the court’s ears. When Lord Lù succeeded him, he sternly corrected such lapses. Though courtesans filled the hall before him, he never once glanced their way.\n\nOne day, while hosting a banquet, the front of his robe came undone, and he could not fasten it himself. Chén Fèngyí stepped forward to secure it, and the Lord turned slightly to smile at her. Fèngyí said, \"So Your Lordship does glance at others after all.\" From then on, his heart was at ease, and he spoke with her often. Rumors spread, and the court dispatched the imperial censor Hé Tán to investigate in secret. When Tán arrived in Hànzhōu, he saw among the courtesans one surnamed Yáng, whose dancing was exceptionally graceful. Someone remarked in passing, \"This must be the famed *Yáng tái liǔ*.\" The words spread until they reached the emperor’s ears.\n\nIf even in moments of leisure and pleasure one must be so cautious, how much more so for others? If these two lords—men of such standing—could not avoid fault, what of those beneath them?\n\nDù Yǎn, the Duke of Integrity, when dining at home, would take but a single dish and a single bowl of rice. If someone remarked on his frugality, he would say, \"I was once a poor scholar. My rank, longevity, and fortune—all my robes and emblems—belong to the state. Should I depart this life, I would return to being a poor scholar. How then could I indulge myself?\"\n\nFàn Zhòngyān, the Duke of Culture, once said of himself: \"Each night before sleep, I tally the day’s expenses for food and comfort, then review what I have accomplished. If the two balance, I sleep soundly, free of shame. If not, I toss and turn, unable to rest.\"\n\nLǚ Gōngzhù, the Duke of Application, often declared: \"Fine robes ill befit a man of restraint; a full granary seems to fear the books in one’s belly.\"\n\nFù Zhègōng, the Duke of Wealth, likewise said: \"Guard your words as you would a sealed jar; guard your thoughts as you would a fortified city.\"\n\nSuch vigilance leaves no room for indulgence, let alone excess. One must recognize that the conduct of the ancients was ever thus—not merely the words of these two masters.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nDwelling without seeking ease,\nEven benevolence demands effort.\nGreat Yǔ rode a sled,\nTáo Kǎn moved his bricks.\nChǔ’s calamity brought daily warnings,\nThe *Book of Changes* urged evening vigilance.\nWho am I to lounge in comfort,\nCareless in sleep and food?\nThe sages of old left their teachings—\nAn inch of time is worth a foot of jade.\n\nAs for cruelty to subordinates: The *Traditions* say, \"To serve in office yet harshly oppress officials and commoners, or to manage a household yet excessively beat servants and maids—this is cruelty.\" Have you not heard of Wáng Jùnkuàng’s father, who in his entire official career never struck anyone unjustly? He had eight sons, all of whom entered the civil service, and Jùnkuàng himself became the empire’s finest scholar.\n\nHave you not also heard of Yuán Láng’s mother, who in life excessively beat her servants and maids, and after death fell into hell, suffering every torment? These are clear examples of karmic retribution, warnings not to be ignored.\n\nThere are those who beat their pregnant concubines—before the child in her womb is even born, it has already suffered harm. To cut off a man’s descendants is no small sin. They lament their own lack of heirs, yet others have them—this is the work of cause and effect. If you insist on having an heir, can you truly force one to come? If you insist on preventing one, can you truly stop it? The matter of descendants is grave, and bestowal or denial rests with Heaven. Creation has its own mysteries.\n\nLong ago, Fèi Xiàoxiān was renowned for his divination by shadows. Once, the ceremonial officer Yáng Shàoyán visited his shop to consult the oracle. Examining the shadow, Xiàoxiān saw two women giving birth to a single child. Shàoyán was astonished and confessed, \"I have long struggled to have a son, so I took a concubine. Now she is with child, but my wife is also pregnant—could this be the meaning?\" Xiàoxiān said, \"Let us wait and see.\" When the concubine went into labor at midnight, no one was available, so the wife herself held her as she gave birth—yet afterward, the wife’s own pregnancy had vanished. Was it that the concubine was fated to bear a son, but the wife, unable to remain silent, also conceived, merely to appease her own heart? The workings of creation are wondrous indeed.\n\nThe Buddha taught: \"Those who, in wealth and high position, delight in whipping and beating others, after death fall into hell for tens of thousands of years, suffering every agony. When their hellish punishment ends, they are reborn as water buffaloes, their noses pierced with ropes, made to pull boats and carts, beaten with great cudgels to repay their past deeds.\" He also said: \"Those who develop festering sores on their bodies do so because they once whipped and beat living beings.\"\n\nIf even servants and maids must not be treated cruelly, how much less so a pregnant concubine? The Buddha’s words are thus, and the Most High’s words are the same—how can one not take heed?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFrom dukes and ministers to scholars and commoners,\nEach rank follows in succession.\n\nServants, grooms, herdsmen, and stable-hands,\nAll rush to serve and drive the carriage.\nThough their stations differ,\nTheir feelings are to be pitied.\n\nBarbarians, southern tribes, Min peoples, and slaves—\nAll are listed in the ritual classics.\nThey too are children of men;\nHow profound was Yuanming’s compassion!\n\nTo terrify others—\nThe *Sutra* states: \"Guanyin Bodhisattva, in the midst of fear and urgent peril, bestows fearlessness upon beings, thereby attaining perfect enlightenment—this is the foremost practice.\" Thus, all beings in Jambudvīpa call him \"the Bestower of Fearlessness.\" If this is so, then how should one regard those who terrify others?\n\nTherefore, the noble person does not act thus; whenever encountering someone in fear, they spare no effort to offer comfort. Alas that such people do not know the harm in startling others—after death, they are reborn as river deer or stags. These creatures, by nature, flee in terror from all beasts by day, startling at every movement. When they sleep, they hang their antlers on branches, curling their bodies to rest. Yet the moment they doze, their limbs scatter in alarm; startled awake, they sleep again, only to be startled once more. From dusk till dawn, they never know a moment’s peace—such is their retribution.\n\nThose who lord over others and terrify them—even bailiffs, constables, and ruffians who freely intimidate for profit—do they understand this? Have they not heard of Li Shunqing, who, pressing a tenant farmer, Zhang San, for unpaid rent, drove him to hang himself? Or Sun Jiming, who, investigating a maid, Lai Xi, and a young servant for some fault, hounded them until they drowned themselves? Before even speaking of karmic consequences in the next life, such torment already brings no peace in this one. Though they took their own lives, in truth, it was *we* who killed them.\n\nOne need only consult the *Taishang Sutra of Karmic Retribution and Causes* to know these words are not false.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nIn ancient times, no governance was more excellent than ensuring the people’s peace. When wild geese return to roost and serpents coil in hibernation, all is settled. Yet when cruel officials raise their voices in clamor, even the stoutest tremble in terror, their gall bladders frozen with fear. The virtuous find their qi stifled, and a hundred dreads assail them. Who bears this responsibility? The officials charged with nurturing the people.\n\nTo blame Heaven and resent others—\nAs the saying goes: The Jambudvīpa world is ever flawed and wanting. How can those who dwell within it expect every matter to conform to their wishes? That which does not conform is simply their lot. For in general, those who accumulate little receive little in return. Yet can Heaven truly be blamed? Can others truly be resented? Such grievances bring no benefit; they only hasten one’s own misfortune.\n\nLong ago, Hu Ang, fallen into destitution and idleness, often drowned his sorrows in drink, cursing Heaven for his repeated failures in the imperial examinations. In the early years of the Taiping Xingguo era, while traveling through the Hebei region, a sheet of black paper suddenly descended from the sky, landing before his horse. Hu Ang retrieved it and saw that it bore golden characters in celestial script—a rebuke from the August Emperor. Well-versed in seal script, he read it through, then scoffed, \"What nonsense!\" He tore it to shreds, cast it aside, and spurred his horse onward. In an instant, dark clouds gathered, rain poured down, and with a single thunderclap, both man and steed collapsed. Hu Ang was struck dead. His servant gathered their belongings and rushed to the nearest inn, only to find the sky clear and the sun shining, not a trace of cloud or shadow.\n\nJiao Junming, a Gentleman for Literary Composition, passed the examinations in his youth but languished in office for years. Bitter over his misfortune, he railed against Heaven and later submitted a memorial in prayer. That very night, a scroll of white silk fluttered down before his brazier. Upon close inspection, he saw sixteen characters in celestial script. Unable to decipher them, he heard that the immortal He Xiangu possessed the Dao and took the scroll to her. She said, \"This is celestial script; there is no need to ask.\" But Junming pleaded, so she relented: \"It reads: *You accepted five taels of silver, which cost you ten years. Wrongfully killing one person—your retribution awaits after death.*\" Had this truly occurred? Junming was left speechless, unable to respond.\n\nOne must reflect upon oneself and not rashly blame or resent others.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo seek alliances among the feudal lords, yet cast aside the tortoise oracle and curse—\nYuan Shao’s defeat at Guandu, for which Tian Feng was not spared—\nZhuge Liang’s failure at Mount Qi, where he bitterly reproached himself—\nZixia, counting his faults, received the lesson with reverence.\nObserve these men: who was wise, and who was not?\n\n**Cursing wind and rain—**\nAs the saying goes: Confucius said, \"When violent thunder and fierce winds arise, one must change one’s demeanor.\" He also said, \"When there is a great wind, violent thunder, or torrential rain, one must change.\" Even in the dead of night, he would rise, dress properly, and sit upright—such was his awe of Heaven. How can the common folk, in summer’s scorching rain or winter’s biting cold, do nothing but complain?\n\nFew understand that wind is the messenger of Heaven and Earth. Heaven has eight winds, corresponding to the eight solar terms, through which yin and yang transform and the myriad things are nurtured. Thus, the sage kings aligned with the eight winds, enacted the eight policies, and accorded with the eight trigrams. On the day of *Lichun*, the *Tiaofeng* arrives—pardon minor offenses and release those detained. On the day of *Chunfen*, the *Mingshu Feng* arrives—rectify borders and cultivate fields. On the day of *Lixia*, the *Qingming Feng* arrives—present gifts of silk and honor the feudal lords. On the day of *Xiazhi*, the *Jingfeng* arrives—appoint great generals and reward the meritorious. On the day of *Liqiu*, the *Liangfeng* arrives—repay all debts and sacrifice to the four directions. On the day of *Qiufen*, the *Changhe Feng* arrives—release prisoners and refrain from playing zithers. On the day of *Lidong*, the *Buzhou Feng* arrives—repair city walls and defend frontier towns. On the day of *Dongzhi*, the *Guangmo Feng* arrives—punish the guilty and impose major penalties.\n\nRain is the messenger of the River Earl. His spirit wears white robes and a black cap, riding a white horse with a red mane. His host is divided into two battalions: one called the *Left Falling Thousand*, the other the *Right Falling Thousand*. Each battalion commands fifty thousand troops, massed at the edge of the clouds. They scatter the seeds of rain, with the rain troops leading and the wind chariots following. The quantity of rain is precisely measured.\n\nThere are two kinds of rain seeds: one resembles horse-tooth saltpeter, called *dry rain*; the other is stored in two small jars—this is the common rain that falls when the world lacks water.\n\nThe Most High said: Since I brought forth Heaven and Earth, I have been called the Primordial Beginning, the Void Sovereign. In rain, I am the Rain Master; in wind, I am the Wind Earl. Can one then curse the passing of wind and rain?\n\nLong ago, when the Grand Duke served as magistrate of Guantan, for a full year not a single branch stirred in the wind. One night, King Wen dreamed of a beautiful woman weeping in the road, saying, \"I am the Most High’s divine maiden of the Eastern Sea, wed to the Western Sea. Guantan lies upon my path home, but its magistrate is so virtuous that I dare not pass with violent wind and torrential rain. When may I return?\" The next day, King Wen summoned the Grand Duke. No sooner had he left the prefecture than the wind and rain descended in full force.\n\nDo those who curse wind and rain possess virtue like the Grand Duke?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nIn the age of Yao and Shun, ten rains and five winds came in due season.\nThe *Hongfan* records omens: \"mad\" and \"deluded.\"\nWhen human affairs are not tended, calamities arise.\nRevere Heaven’s wrath, approach with solemn awe.\nTo do nothing but complain—such is the sorrow of the common folk.\n\n**Quarrels and lawsuits—**\nAs the saying goes: Master Zeng said, \"To be wronged and not retaliate.\"\nLaozi said, \"The superior person does not contend.\"\nThe Buddha said, \"I have attained the samadhi of non-contention, foremost among men.\" He also said, \"Of the six perfections and ten thousand practices, forbearance is foremost.\"\n\nLong ago, Zhang Gongyi’s family lived in harmony for nine generations. Emperor Gaozong visited his home and asked the secret of their unity. Gongyi wrote the character \"forbearance\" in response. The emperor was moved to tears and bestowed upon him bolts of silk before departing.\n\nThus, when faced with injustice, forbearance is the way. Without forbearance, conflict arises; unchecked, it escalates into strife. Taking disputes to the authorities may lead to imprisonment, flogging, or torture—even broken skin and severed limbs.\n\nThe shame and humiliation, the pain and suffering—none can be spoken of. Parents share in their sorrow, wives and children weep with them, brothers are alarmed, and friends and relatives sigh in despair. They empty their coffers to seek powerful allies, prepare feasts to bribe clerks and runners, and if fortunate, the matter may be resolved in ten days—perhaps. Yet if misfortune strikes, years drag on, the case twists and turns, ascending from the local court to the prefecture, from the prefecture to the provincial authorities, and from there to the imperial censorate. What they contend over is trifling, but the harm they suffer is vast. The dispute may involve no more than a few strings of cash, yet the cost mounts a hundredfold. Soon, they exhaust their family wealth, sell their fields and gardens to sustain the fight, neglecting their parents, losing their wives’ affection, and failing to educate their children. Day after day, they rush between courtrooms, at the mercy of officials and clerks. Even if they possess grand halls and spacious homes, how can they dwell in peace? Warm clothes and ample food—how can they enjoy them? Alas, as lawsuits escalate, grudges deepen, like wildfire spreading across the plains, impossible to extinguish. Had they endured the initial grievance, they would never have reached such an extreme.\n\nYet some disputes arise from necessity, and none can entirely avoid them. But those who incite conflict, teaching others to litigate for profit, seeking only to satisfy their own desires—I have never seen such men escape misfortune, nor spare their descendants from its consequences.\n\nLet me now speak of one or two who resolved disputes and quelled strife, that those who wish to mediate may find no obstacle, and those who mediate may succeed.\n\nThe *Sutra of Encounters* states: \"There are two kinds of giving—giving of wealth, which exists among men, and giving of the Dharma, which exists within great compassion.\" If the merit of Dharma-giving is not slight, then when two parties rage in conflict, a single word of mediation that brings them both peace is also a form of Dharma-giving.\n\nLong ago, Li Wujiang was transferred to an official post in the Eastern Capital. Passing through Zhu Xian Town, he saw two beggars fighting in the road. One cried, \"I begged all year to save a few hundred coins, and you borrowed them, refusing to repay!\" Wujiang, seeing their violent struggle, paid the debt with his own money. One beggar departed, while the other said, \"Sir, you have resolved our fight—you are truly a good man. I live in Longhe Alley; if you visit me someday, I will surely repay you.\" Wujiang had already traveled several miles when he thought, \"He is but a beggar—how could he reward me?\" Yet upon reaching the Eastern Capital, he found time to seek him out. Indeed, he found the man and was invited into his home. The beggar offered him wine, but Wujiang declined. He then presented peaches, and though Wujiang politely refused, he took two and placed them in his sleeve. On the road, he examined them and found they were made of gold.\n\nCui Wei, at Kaiyuan Temple, saw an old beggar woman stumble and knock over a wine vendor’s jar. The vendor beat her mercilessly. Wei hurried to intervene, asking, \"How much was the wine worth?\" The vendor replied, \"One string of cash.\" Wei immediately removed his robe and paid the debt. The old woman left without a word of thanks. Days later, he encountered her again on the road, and she said, \"Yesterday, you resolved my trouble—I cannot forget your kindness. I am skilled in treating growths and warts. Here is a small bundle of Yuejinggang mugwort as a token of gratitude. If you encounter such ailments, use it to cauterize them—one treatment, and they will heal.\" Later, Wei met a monk with a growth dangling from his ear. One cauterization, and it vanished. The monk led him to a wealthy household where the master suffered from a similar growth. One treatment, and it was cured. From then on, Wei’s reputation spread, and many sought his help. Soon, he became a man of wealth, yet he never forgot the old woman, thinking of her day and night. One day, he met someone who told him, \"That old woman was Bao Gu, daughter of Bao Jing and wife of Ge Hong. She has practiced this moxibustion in Nanhai for many years.\"\n\nThus, when witnessing disputes, should one fan the flames or seek to extinguish them?\n\nIn praise I say:\n\nWords that strike at the heart of reason resolve disputes and dispel difficulties. Yet slander and deceit, though whispered, suffice to sow discord. When doubt and resentment gather among friends, regret and fault spread like creeping vines. The two noble scions’ quarrel ultimately brought calamity to the state. Alas! Glib tongues trade in fortune like merchants—recklessly chasing factions.\n\nThe *Scripture* states: The Supreme Lord, through the Twenty-Four Gates of Essential Methods for Governing Thought, instructed the Perfected One of Universal Salvation:\n\n- For those who delight in killing and harm, govern with compassion.\n- For thieves and robbers, govern with justice and sharing.\n- For the licentious and dissolute, govern with chastity.\n- For the miserly and grasping, govern with generosity.\n- For the wrathful and contentious, govern with joy.\n- For the deluded and confused, govern with expedient means.\n- For frivolous and ornate speech, govern with simplicity and rectitude.\n- For false and deceitful words, govern with trust and compliance.\n- For harsh curses and maledictions, govern with recitation and invocation.\n- For divisive slander and abuse, govern with praise and admiration.\n- For those who drink wine and eat meat, govern with fasting and abstinence.\n- For defamation and disparagement, govern with discourse and exposition.\n- For arrogance and disdain, govern with reverence and prostration.\n- For rigidity and aggression, govern with softness and humility.\n- For disbelief in karma and past lives, govern with dependent origination.\n- For clinging to existence or nonexistence, govern with the Middle Way.\n- For partiality and self-interest, govern with equanimity.\n- For greed and filth, govern with purity.\n- For obstinacy and immobility, govern with cyclical change.\n- For ceaseless fabrication, govern with non-action.\n- For narrow adherence to convention, govern with all-pervading adaptability.\n- For restlessness and competition, govern with stillness and concentration.\n- For sorrow and discontent, govern with carefree ease.\n- For unrelieved affliction, govern with liberation.\n\nBy and large, the vices of the world are not easily eradicated. Thus, the Supreme Lord revealed these methods to teach restraint. Yet now, people recklessly pursue factions, indulging in frivolous speech, deceitful words, divisive slander, and partisan strife. Measured against these precepts, such conduct incurs the censure of the Supreme Lord.\n\nHave they not heard the *Discourse on Factions*? It states: The noble form factions through shared principles; the petty, through shared gain. A ruler need only dismiss the false factions of petty men and employ the true factions of the noble. The words of Ouyang Xiu may be called perfect.\n\nLong ago, the Khitans and the Xia clashed beyond the Yellow River. At the time, Lord Fan Wenzheng was ordered to pacify Hedong and requested troops for support. Duke Du Zhengxian argued that the Khitans were unlikely to come and that troops should not be rashly deployed. Wenzheng grew furious, even insulting Zhengxian, who bore no grudge. Later, the Khitans indeed did not come. If these two lords were labeled as factions by the vulgar, how could such discord in state affairs justify banishing factions?\n\nSima Junshi and Fan Jingren enjoyed profound harmony, each deeming the other unmatched. They once said: \"We share the same aspirations in life and the same legacy in death. In matters of employment or dismissal, we act in unison without prior consultation. On the three great affairs, our words seem as if spoken by one man, our actions as coordinated as left and right hands.\" They also declared: \"Jingren and I are brothers—our only difference is our surname.\" Yet when debating the tuning of bells, they endlessly disputed, never reaching accord. Thus, the noble know that though these two agreed, it was not blind agreement. How, then, could factions be banished?\n\nGenerally, whether at home or in the community, in matters great or small, one should defer to public judgment. How can factions be recklessly expelled on mere suspicion?\n\nIn praise I say:\nWords may be right or wrong—resolve them with reason.\nPeople may differ—judge them by their virtue.\nTo stand alone may seem upright, yet not all who do so are true gentlemen.\nWhen the Way aligns and aspirations converge, it must be the noble.\nDistinguish the upright from the crooked, and the question of factions is settled.\n\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Twenty-One, concludes.\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Twenty-Three.\n\n**The Transmission of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nTo abandon the proper and emulate the perverse.\n\nThe *Transmission* states: Shi Que said: \"The lowly encroaching upon the noble, the young overbearing the elder, the distant estranging the near, the new supplanting the old, the petty overriding the great, and lewdness subverting righteousness—these are the Six Perversions. The lord acting with justice, the minister with loyalty; the father with kindness, the son with filial piety; the elder brother with affection, the younger with respect—these are the Six Proprieties. To abandon the proper and emulate the perverse is to hasten calamity.\"\n\nGenerally, the discourse on propriety and perversion cannot surpass this. Formerly, Fan Wei, a great clansman of Chang’an, amassed vast wealth and falsely claimed the county magistrate of Wugong, Fan You, as his grandfather. When You held office as magistrate, he exempted Fan Wei’s household from corvée for over fifty years. Later, when western affairs arose, all lesser households were conscripted and levied, falling into dire straits—only Fan Wei remained untouched. When Liu Chang became prefect of Chang’an, he uncovered the matter, and Fan Wei was punished, his family’s property confiscated by the authorities.\n\nZhou Zong, having failed the examinations repeatedly, traveled to Qiao Commandery and bowed to the clerk Zhou Ji as his father, daily ranking among his sons. He adopted all three generations’ names and taboos as his own. The following year, he unexpectedly passed one examination, but his father reproached him in verse. Zhou Zong, deeply disheartened, died of shame and regret. Was this not a case of abandoning the proper and emulating the perverse? How lamentable that he never heard the words of the True Lord of the Southern Culmen, Longevity Star.\n\nThe Perfected of the Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, once encountered the True Lord of the Southern Culmen, Longevity Star, and inquired about matters of longevity, early death, fortune, and misfortune. The Star Lord said: \"The Way of Heaven blesses the good and calamitizes the lewd; the divine spirits reward the proper and punish the perverse. If you can devote yourself to goodness, revere yourself and align with Heaven, remain tranquil when the Dao is fitting, and act in accord with fortune, then your life rests with you—not controlled by the Lord of Death, nor seized by ghosts and spirits. You will not seek longevity yet attain it naturally; you will not pursue life yet preserve it effortlessly.\n\nBut if you undermine the moral order, defy Heaven and Earth, indulge in folly and rebellion, insult the divine spirits, oppose benevolence and kindness, and diminish loyalty and filial piety—then in the manifest, the net of punishment will bind you; in the hidden, ghosts and spirits will execute you. When death approaches and you speak of goodness, or when transgressions overflow and you seek repentance, it will be too late.\"\n\nJudging by the Star Lord’s words, can one truly abandon the proper and emulate the perverse?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nIn public, nothing is not proper; in private, nothing is not perverse.\nPublic conduct stems from principle and righteousness; private conduct arises from the heart’s whims.\nSubduing emotion to follow principle, all endeavors remain upright.\nA single errant thought, and ten thousand affairs are overturned.\nFortune favors the proper; misfortune befalls the perverse—this is the Emperor’s standard.\n\nTo turn from kin toward the distant.\n\nThe *Transmission* states: Confucius said: \"One who does not love their kin but loves others is called perverse in virtue. One who does not respect their kin but respects others is called perverse in ritual.\" Generally, the distinction between kin and the distant must be made clear. One must not fail to guard against perversity in ritual and virtue.\n\nFormerly, Shen Jizhong, the bedchamber son of Xuan Yilang Qi, had a grandmother who was the paternal aunt of Hanlin Academician Yang Yuansu. At the time, Yuansu had a son afflicted with illness who could not manage affairs. When Jizhong was born, Yuansu, due to their kinship, took him as his own son. Later, Yuansu had two more sons in succession, and Jizhong, though aware of his origins, remained silent and dared not speak. He redoubled his filial devotion, ensuring no slander or estrangement entered between them, and Yuansu grew to love him. On two occasions when Yuansu recommended him for office, Jizhong firmly declined, insisting the positions go to his two younger brothers. He vowed to advance through the examination system by his own efforts. In the fifth year of Yuanfeng, he indeed passed the imperial examinations.\n\nSeveral years after placing, Yuansu died in Yuhang. Jizhong escorted his coffin home, observed the full mourning rites, then arranged marriages for his younger brothers and sisters, selecting reputable families. Once all was settled, he handed over the entire family estate to his two brothers and departed with nothing. He also composed a treatise, *On Returning to One’s Lineage*, several thousand words long, to show his relatives. In essence, he argued that the kindness of one’s birth parents and adoptive parents is equal. Having repaid his adoptive parents, he could not neglect his birth parents.\n\nAfter returning, he paid respects to his father and mother and sought out his birth mother, née Du. After a long search, he found her in a humble alley, her face unwashed, her feet bound, barely surviving. Mother and son embraced and wept bitterly, moving all who witnessed it. Twenty years later, his parents died. After observing the full mourning rites, he returned all his ancestral lands to his elder brothers and left empty-handed, renting a house to live in. When urged to accept even a small portion, Jizhong firmly refused, saying: \"The Yang family’s wealth was ten times this, yet I cast it aside like a worn-out sandal. How could I bear to take anything from my brothers’ livelihood to enrich myself?\" The scholarly community universally admired him.\n\nAt the time, Xu Guangyi, serving as Transport Commissioner, recommended him to the court. An imperial edict praised him and granted him an official post, appointing him as Supervisor of Schools in the Yongxing and other circuits. Shortly after, he died. Xu Guangyi, along with Xuanhe Hall Academician Xue Sichang and Drafter of the Central Secretariat Yuwen Huangzhong, jointly memorialized the throne, and a second edict was issued, granting an official post to one of his sons.\n\nAlas! How many in the world are like Jizhong? Truly, he was one who knew how to conduct himself rightly.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nOf all human bonds, none are closer than those between parent and child. Brothers share the same qi, like feet and hands. Extending this principle, the clan expands to nine degrees of kinship. Though their ranks may differ, the affection and duty between them ought to be profound. To abandon them and turn elsewhere is to act contrary to virtue—what good could come of it?\n\nOne may invoke Heaven and Earth to attest to one’s sincerity. As the tradition states: Heaven has thirty-two modes of covering, Earth has thirty-two modes of bearing; Heaven covers, Earth bears, each governing its own qi. Humanity dwells between them—fortune follows compliance, misfortune defiance, the response as swift as an echo. Even with utmost caution and reverence, one still fears incurring fault; how much more so if one rashly invokes Heaven and Earth to attest to one’s own base sentiments—is this not blasphemy?\n\nIn former times, the father of Wang Yigong, though unlearned himself, was devoted to scholars of the classics. Whenever he encountered discarded paper, he would gather and cleanse it, then store it in scented water. Once, he made a vow: “May my descendants achieve prominence through literary accomplishment.” One night, he dreamed that the Sage Confucius patted his back and said, “How diligently you honor my teachings! Yet you are already aged, with no hope of personal achievement—thus I shall send Zeng Shen to be reborn in your family.” In his later years, he indeed had a son, who was none other than Yigong. He named the child *Zeng* after the disciple, and the boy eventually passed the imperial examinations as *zhuangyuan*, rising to the rank of Vice Director of the Secretariat and Grand Councilor.\n\nLi Jingxun’s mother, née Zheng, was strict in educating her sons. One day, a wall collapsed, revealing a jar of coins. Lady Zheng burned incense and prayed: “Could it be that Heaven and Earth pity us, mother and sons, in our orphaned and widowed state, and have bestowed this upon us? Yet my sole wish is that my sons complete their studies, enter officialdom, and receive their salaries—this money is not what I desire.” She then buried it again. Later, Jingxun indeed passed the examinations and rose to the position of Junior Guardian of the Heir Apparent.\n\nAlas! With a single utterance from Wang’s father and a single utterance from Lady Zheng, Heaven and Earth responded so decisively—who can say that invoking Heaven and Earth to attest to one’s sincerity will not incur their reproach?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nThe mother of Lu Zhuang’s oath was a grave breach of filial piety and kindness. Vowing not to serve and swearing at the grave drew ridicule even from Xi Zhi. Yet when Dai asked twice about the shoes, ten eyes could not deceive—heart and deed stood clear, leaving no room for doubt. How could the August Heaven and Earth heed wanton words? To invoke the divine to witness base matters!\n\nAs the tradition says: Each body has its own spirits, each dwelling its own deities. The spirit of the brain, *Jinggen*, is called *Nijiu*; the spirit of the eyes, *Mingshang*, is called *Yingxuan*; the spirit of the ears, *Kongxian*, is called *Youtian*; the spirit of the nose, *Yulong*, is called *Lingjian*; the spirit of the teeth, *Efeng*, is called *Luoqian*; the spirit of the tongue, *Tongming*, is called *Zhenglun*; the spirit of the hair, *Cangying*, is called *Taiyuan*; the twelve-storied *Chonglou* is called *Taiyi*; the spirit of the lungs, *Haohua*, is called *Xushen*; the spirit of the liver, *Longyan*, is called *Sheming*; the spirit of the gallbladder, *Longyao*, is called *Weiming*; the spirit of the heart, *Danyuan*, is called *Shouling*; the spirit of the spleen, *Changzai*, is called *Hunting*; the spirit of the kidneys, *Xuanming*, is called *Yuying*; the spirit of the palms, *Cunxiang*, is called *Jingning*. Then there are the Jade Youth Lord, Jade Maiden Lord, Dao Father Lord, Dao Mother Lord, Master Father Lord, Master Mother Lord, Drinking Sea Lord, Life-Uniting Lord, Thirty-Six Lion Lords, Cinnabar Field Lord, Upper Harmony, Middle Harmony, and Lower Harmony Venerable Lords, and the Three Primordial Perfected Lords—all spirits of the body.\n\nThe ghost of the gate is called *Chengbo*; the ghost of opening and closing is called *Shibo*; the ghost-official guarding the main gate is called *Zhengong*; the ghost-official of the small gate is called *Xiaozhen*; the ghost of the dwelling is called *Xizidu*; the ghost-official of the chamber door is called *Wanlun*; the guardian of the stove is called *Yanjing*; the guardian of the privy is called *Nu Zhi*; the ghost of the road is called *Wu Ziding*; the guardian of the road is called *Shigong*—these are the spirits of a dwelling. Know that in every place, wherever one is, there are always spirits presiding. How could one rashly invoke them to witness lewd or vulgar acts?\n\nLong ago, Wang Shaoyi was imprisoned for a long time. Tao Hongjing said: “This man offended the spirits by recklessly invoking them in his grievance, thus bringing this misfortune upon himself.” This further shows that the divine must never be rashly invoked.\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nThe tradition holds that coercive oaths are not heard by the spirits. When the people of Qin cursed Chu, their virtue was not strong enough. The invocators falsely raised their pleas, yet through fear they amended their governance. When Zheng did not perform rites to avert fire, Kong Ning prayed for illness. The spirits are keen of hearing and upright—how could flattery with the mouth suffice? To give and then regret it.\n\nIt is recorded: During the *Mingdao* era, the Taiping Prefecture suffered consecutive droughts and locust plagues, leaving the people severely lacking in food. Suddenly, a kind of dark grass grew in the mountains and marshes, which the people gathered to eat, relying on it to stave off hunger. In the *Zhidao* era, the Huanqing Circuit faced famine, and the five grains failed to sprout. Suddenly, artemisia spread across the fields, bearing seeds like millet that could fill the stomach. At the beginning of the *Xining* era, the Huaizhe Circuit suffered famine. Suddenly, mushrooms grew across the fields, sweet and soft, quite delicious, and could be made into soup. During the *Yuanfeng* era, Qingzhou and Zizhou experienced great famine. Suddenly, a kind of stone flour appeared among the mountain rocks; mixed with a little flour, it could be made into cakes. In the *Shengli* era, Zizhou faced a severe famine. The Perfected Lord of True Martiality transformed into an old man, entering the city daily to sell steamed cakes, aiding many. At the end of the *Jianlong* era, the Hebei Circuit suffered famine. He again transformed into a merchant, transporting 150,000 *hu* of millet and wheat into the city. When the goods arrived, the merchant vanished; the officials took them to provide relief, extending aid to several neighboring prefectures.\n\nGenerally, famine and scarcity are disasters and the workings of fate, but the growth of such things is the original intent of Heaven and Earth. The Perfected Lord’s actions were likewise the intent of Heaven and Earth. Now, those who receive the harmony of Heaven and Earth, embody the image of Heaven and Earth, yet lack the heart of Heaven and Earth—how can they be called human? It is lamentable that they do not know how superior persons conduct themselves in the world: with great compassion, impartiality, and the virtue of universal salvation. To extinguish one life and give rise to another is to ascend to the supreme fruit. Have they not heard of the deeds of Zhou Huihua and others?\n\nZhou Huihua was fond of aiding the poor and distressed, enduring hardship without weariness. One day, the Perfected Lord of Wise Observation transformed into a beggar, begging for food in the streets to test his resolve. Zhou indeed delighted in giving, so that very day he was delivered and is now the Perfected Lord of Western Florescence. Liu Kuan was fond of helping the poor and never neglected this duty; as a result, he was recorded by the Most High and now serves as the Marshal of the Youthful Beginning Prefecture, overseeing those who first embark on the Dao. He warned against the dangers of hoarding wealth, urging that one should not惜千金, but rather give freely until nothing remains. The Lord on High praised him and granted him deliverance from the world. Liu Baiyun was also wealthy but initially knew nothing of cultivating the Dao. However, he delighted in giving and did not惜钱帛. Eventually, he encountered the Perfected Lord of Joy, who transmitted the essentials of the Dao to him, allowing him to ascend as an immortal.\n\nHow worthy are these men, who through their joy in giving swiftly attained the supreme fruit! Has there ever been one who gave and then regretted it, yet still achieved such rank? Know that the act of giving is the swiftest way to establish merit. Even if one does not immediately attain the fruit, they will surely receive their reward. Have they not heard of the deeds of Lord Yang and others?\n\nYang Boyong was fond of offering righteous libations. One day, he encountered an extraordinary person who gave him a pint of jade seeds; his descendants all became greatly wealthy and noble. The three brothers Pei Yannian all delighted in generous giving. One day, an old man came to their door begging for a drink, and the brothers treated him with utmost respect. The old man said: “I see that you brothers are all virtuous men. With such accumulated virtue, how could you lack good fortune?” During the An Lushan rebellion, they were led by the old man into a cave, thus escaping the calamity of war. Later, the brothers all attained high office, and their entire families lived past a hundred years.\n\nXi Baisan was originally a poor man. One day, he saw a Daoist approach a shopkeeper, begging for a single copper coin, but the shopkeeper refused with a scowl. Baisan, indignant on the Daoist’s behalf, reached into his own belt and gave him a coin. That night, he dreamed the Daoist gave him a jade pendant. When he awoke, the pendant had indeed appeared on his chin.\n\nTang Shumi had been dead for several days when he appeared in his grandson’s dream, saying: “Though I was harsh and narrow-minded in life, I committed no great transgressions. This year, the harvest is poor. If you could open the granary to relieve the people, it would be far better than performing Buddhist rites for me, and I would also benefit.” His grandson that very day gave five hundred *shi* of rice to the county magistrate Sun Kuang for distribution. That night, he dreamed again of Tang Shumi, who smiled and said: “I have now ascended to Heaven.”\n\nAll these are examples of those who delighted in giving and each received their due reward. Can those who give and then regret it hope for the same?\n\nThe Buddha said: In the single act of giving food, five kinds of blessed rewards may be obtained. The first is the gift of life. The reward for this gift is longevity and boundless wealth in every lifetime. When a person lacks food, they will surely die within seven days; if I provide it, I restore them to life—this is called the gift of life. The second is the gift of beauty. The reward for this gift is a flawless appearance in every lifetime, bringing joy to all who see it. When a person lacks food, their complexion must wither; if I provide it, I restore their radiance—this is called the gift of beauty. The third is the gift of strength. The reward for this gift is great vigor in every lifetime, never diminishing. When a person lacks food, they must grow weak; if I provide it, I restore their strength—this is called the gift of strength. The fourth is the gift of peace. The reward for this gift is safety and stability in every lifetime, free from disaster and misfortune. When a person lacks food, they must suffer distress and peril; if I provide it, I restore their peace—this is called the gift of peace. The fifth is the gift of eloquence. The reward for this gift is wisdom and fluency in every lifetime, with words that others heed. When a person lacks food, they are too weary to speak; if I provide it, I restore their voice—this is called the gift of eloquence.\n\nHow great indeed! If the single act of giving food already yields five such rewards, how much greater must be the blessings for all acts of giving, in every circumstance where giving is due?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nTo walk the Way in search of fortune,\nto move grain in hope of the people’s favor—\ngiving only to seek reward,\nthe hegemon feigns benevolence.\nSeeking fame abroad,\ntheir pretense is not sincere.\nShould their schemes falter,\nthey curse Heaven and blame others.\nWhen the five grains fail to ripen,\neven chaff and millet become precious.\nTo borrow and not repay—\nas the saying goes: in this world, many act thus.\nHow could they know that though they may not repay in life,\nthey must repay after death?\n\nThere was an official named Chen Yi who borrowed two hundred thousand coins from Wu Zongsi but refused to return them. Wu reproached him, saying: “If I owed you money in a past life, I repay it now with this. If I did not owe you, but you owe me, then you must become a donkey to repay me.” A year later, Wu sat alone in his hall when he suddenly saw Chen Yi arrive, carrying the money to repay him. Not realizing Chen was dead, Wu called out to question him, but Chen had already slipped into the stable—his tracks vanished. Soon after, a mare gave birth to a foal. Upon inquiry, Wu learned that Chen Yi had indeed died that very day.\n\nZhang and Chen had a daughter named Fo’er, fifteen years old, who suddenly died. After half a day, she revived and said: “At first, two ghosts seized me and took me past Bi Cliff. Then I saw two other ghosts wrapping two people in a black blanket and carrying them to the Chen household. Next, they wrapped a servant in a patterned blanket, saying: ‘You owe this family fifteen hundred coins—now you must repay them.’ Suddenly, a figure in green appeared and said: ‘This person has also awakened to prajñā; let us forgive her misstep.’ At once, she fell into a pond and awoke with a start.” The next day, her father went to Bi Cliff to investigate and found a Chen family who that night had given birth to three puppies—one brindle and two black. The brindle one had accidentally fallen into a pond and drowned. Hurrying home, he took the money and repaid the Chen household, but they refused to accept it.\n\nThus, they took the money together and offered it to Huangyan Temple to sponsor Buddhist rites, seeking to atone for their transgressions.\n\nYet if even borrowed things may not be repaid, how much worse to leave debts unpaid in life?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Jin ate Qin’s grain—three gifts went unrewarded.\nWar’s chains and woes brought ruin, a nation’s lament.\nThe deer repaid its debt; who calls the tiger cruel?\nA single meal not forgotten marks the worthy’s resolve.\nWith no burden on the heart, gods and men alike approve.\nYet to seek beyond one’s lot—\n\n**Tradition says:** In this world, men may be noble or rich, humble or poor, yet each has his destined portion. What the unseen records, the visible receives—all is the karma of past lives. To seek beyond one’s portion—can such things be obtained?\n\nLong ago, Liu Gang was a man of letters who believed himself certain to pass the imperial examinations with high honors. At the time, the Perfected Lord of Auspicious Aid descended to speak on Mount Zhongnan, and Gang, bearing incense, came to inquire. The Perfected Lord said: “Your writing is fine, yet your fate is meager. If you accept your lot and withdraw, you may preserve your remaining years. Should you seek beyond measure, your life will be cut short.” Gang did not believe him and ultimately died without achievement.\n\nThus, rank and degree are indeed fixed by fate. Even a single degree cannot be sought and gained.\n\nLord Wu, an official who rose to the rank of Grand Master, was over seventy when he prepared to retire. One night, he dreamed a spirit told him: “You still have seven hundred thousand in salary unclaimed from your post.” At dawn, he examined his records and found the sum exact. He warned his sons and nephews not to claim it, and they obeyed, making no mention of it. Soon after, he died. His descendants sighed: “Were dreams not to be trusted?” That very night, he dreamed again of the spirit, who said: “After resigning your cap, did you not claim half your salary? Was that not seven hundred thousand?” His descendants were stunned, their regret too late.\n\nThus, lifespan and emolument are indeed fixed by fate. Even what one is due cannot be fully possessed.\n\nWhen Xiahou Jiazhen had not yet passed the examinations, a boy named Liu who was skilled in physiognomy once told him: “You will attain high office through reputation, but all else is weak. Beyond your salary, you will receive a hundred taels of ill-gotten gain—unless you fall ill, you will die.” Later, Jiazhen rose to become Remonstrator and Straight Historian. Sent as an envoy to celebrate the Prince of Yi’s birthday, he received several hundred thousand in gifts. As he returned home to store them, intending to renovate his house, a single string of cash suddenly rose from the ground and stood upright for a long while before toppling. Startled, he fell ill and died.\n\nThus, every coin and ingot is indeed fixed by fate. Even ill-gotten gains cannot be possessed.\n\nHave you not heard of the Underworld’s *Lüesheng* Enforcers? After Pei Pu’s death, he became the *Lüesheng* Enforcer of the Three Rivers in Longyou. In a dream, he told his friend Wei Yuanfang: “Every sip and bite, every treasure in the world, is recorded. There is a limit to what one may obtain; if one exceeds that number, I am empowered to seize the excess.”\n\nAfter Zhang Yu’s death, he was punished by being made a *Lüesheng* Ghost in Yangzhou. In a dream, he told the monk Minchu: “In the world, those like us number in the thousands and tens of thousands, beyond counting. Every trade and profit has its fixed measure. If one exceeds that measure, we are empowered to seize the excess.”\n\nYet if this is so, are the misfortunes of the world indeed caused by such spirits seizing what exceeds one’s allotment?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nWhat nature desires is governed by fate.\nThose rich without seeking,\ncontent even to hold the whip,\nabide in ease awaiting their turn,\nwhile those who rush through peril stumble and fall.\nHe who does not overreach his station\npreserves both body and name.\nO you hundredfold gentlemen,\nwhy strive in vain upon the fields of others?\nTo force labor beyond measure—\nthis is what the Most High calls \"imposing toil above.\"\n\nThe tradition states: \"He who spares not the strength of others but drives them with excessive harshness enacts precisely what the Most High condemns as 'imposing toil above.'\" How could they know that greed in accomplishment becomes sin, and that such sin leads to death and rebirth in evil destinies?\n\n\"Greed in accomplishment\" refers to exploiting the labor of others to achieve one’s ends. As recorded by Li Xuzhou, this is plainly evident. During the Jiayou era, Shen Yu governed Hangzhou. At every weir he passed, oxen were assembled to haul boats. It was the height of summer, and from the supervising officials down to the lowest clerks, all slept exposed upon the weirs, awaiting the ebb and flow of water. Suddenly, they heard voices calling one another by birth order: \"What work awaits us tomorrow?\" One replied, \"Tomorrow Shen Ji’s son will pass through—he who governs Hangzhou. We shall have another round of toil.\" Another asked, \"Has Shen Ji so soon a son governing Hangzhou?\" At this, they broke into sobs and lamentations. The officials, struck by the uncanny tone of their speech, sent men to investigate and found only several weir-oxen. Seeing one shed tears, they sighed deeply: \"Who knows but that these oxen were once kin or acquaintances of Shen Ji?\" Xuzhou heard of this and recorded it in large script as a warning against \"imposing toil above,\" yet many remain heedless.\n\nFormerly, Lu Bing served as Salt Transport Commissioner and dug a new canal solely for salt barges. Autumn rains fell without cease, and the harvest remained unfinished. Yet Bing daily pressed thousands of laborers to dig through mud and rain, driving them relentlessly. The people suffered greatly. Dongpo composed a poem on the matter, including the lines: \"Like swine and ducks, they are flung into the mire, splashing and startling one another\"—from which the cruelty of their treatment is clear. Alas! Had they seen Xuzhou’s account, would they not have trembled in fear?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nOn a thousand-fathom cliff’s edge, even Peng and Yu would be gripped with fear—should one fall, they would plunge into the abyss. Why then impose reckless toil, indulging in wanton cruelty? Resources meant to aid the people instead become their poison. Yet we rely on the sagely sovereign, who bestows the Five Blessings.\n\n*The Twenty-Third Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Stimulus and Response* concludes.\n*The Twenty-Fourth Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Stimulus and Response*\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nExcess in desire and indulgence.\n\nIt is recorded: According to the *Daoist Canon*, humans are the spirits of all beings, granted a lifespan of 43,200 days. Their spirit possesses 36,000 primordial yang qi, originally weighing 384 *zhu*, corresponding internally to *Qian*. If one fails to preserve it, allowing it to dissipate, they will meet an untimely end midway.\n\n*Qian* embodies the six yang forces before any movement or expenditure. Those who understand this and cultivate accordingly become immortals.\n\nFrom age fifteen to twenty-five, unrestrained expenditure depletes 48 *zhu* of qi, leaving a state corresponding to *Gou*. If desires grow more intense over the next decade, another 48 *zhu* is lost, leaving a state corresponding to *Dun*. Without proper nurturing, another decade brings another loss of 48 *zhu*, leaving a state corresponding to *Pi*—here lies the central qi of Heaven and Earth. Without nurturing, another five years deplete 72 *zhu*, leaving a state corresponding to *Guan*. Another five years without nurturing deplete 96 *zhu*, leaving a state corresponding to *Bo*. Beyond this, the sixty-four hexagrams exhaust their qi, and primordial qi is spent entirely, corresponding to *Kun*.\n\n*Kun* is pure yin. Those who subsist on grains alone may yet linger, hence the term \"provisional longevity.\" At this stage, death is near.\n\nMoreover, the kidney chamber is the Mysterious Pass. Heart and kidney unite as one meridian, white as a thread, linked like a ring, spanning one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth. It encases the essence of the entire body, the wondrous qi of the Nine Heavens’ True Unity and Void Harmony, the deep root of life’s most refined vitality. The five viscera, six bowels, hundreds of joints and meridians, golden fluids and jade liquids, the radiance of sun and moon—all reside here. By preserving and consolidating it, the seas of the two regions respond to the rhythm of a single breath, their tides naturally arising to reach the Gate of Life.\n\nIn essence, *ren* is the foundation of life, and the kidneys are the lower palace of the Metal Chamber, hence called the Sea of Longevity. If the Tailbone Gate is left unguarded, the vast ocean will run dry. Have you not heard the words of Qibo?\n\nEmperor Huang asked Qibo: \"I have heard that people of high antiquity lived past a hundred years in spring and autumn, yet their movements did not decline. Today’s people, however, reach but half a century, and their movements already weaken. Is this because the world has changed? Or have people lost something?\"\n\nQibo replied: \"The people of high antiquity, those who understood the Dao, modeled themselves upon yin and yang, harmonized with the arts of calculation, regulated their eating and drinking, maintained regularity in rising and resting, and did not recklessly exhaust themselves. Thus, their form and spirit remained united, and they fulfilled their natural lifespan, living past a hundred years before departing.\n\nToday’s people, however, take wine as their broth, treat recklessness as normal, enter the bedchamber while drunk, exhaust their essence with desire, dissipate their true qi, fail to preserve fullness, fail to govern their spirit, seek only to gratify their hearts, and act contrary to the joys of life. Their rising and resting lack regulation, and so they decline by fifty.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* also states: 'For long life, strictly guard the bedchamber.' The urgency of this lies precisely in the weight of beings’ karmic burdens. How lamentable that they do not know—women’s allure, as the Buddha taught, is the root of all suffering, the source of obstacles, the origin of killing and harm, the wellspring of sorrow. Thus, the enlightened keep far from it.\n\nRen Huigong grew stronger in his later years. When asked about his art of nurturing life, he said: 'I gained insight from reading the *Wen Xuan*.' Someone pressed: 'May I ask where the insight lay?' He replied: 'A stone that holds jade makes the mountain gleam; water that cradles a pearl makes the river radiant.'\n\nPu Chuanzheng, while serving as prefect of Hangzhou, was visited by an elder from his hometown named Li Jue, who was already a hundred years old yet had the glowing complexion of an infant. Pu said: 'I wish to hear your method of self-cultivation.' The elder replied: 'My method is most simple and easy—there is nothing to it but abstaining from desire early on.'\"\n\nShall indulgence in lust then know no bounds? Should the teaching of restraining desire remain unpracticed? As for the transgression of illicit desire—such as gazing upon another’s fair wife and harboring secret designs, or engaging in clandestine acts in secluded places—\n\nThe eulogy states:\nTo teach what harms oneself is forbidden;\nWhat benefits, one should bear for life.\nGuard against lust above all,\nFor nurturing life is paramount.\nHeed the sagely words with awe,\nAnd to the end of your days, you shall have no regrets.\nYielding to desire injures life—\nTo whom can one complain at death?\nA venomous heart beneath a gentle guise—\n\nAs the saying goes: *\"A venomous heart beneath a gentle guise\"*—such were the likes of Li Yifu. Li Yifu’s countenance was most courteous and tender; whenever he spoke, he wore a cheerful, gentle smile. Yet in secret, he was treacherous and quick to anger, his malice rooted deep in his heart. The slightest offense would provoke him to strike. People called him *\"the dagger in the smile\"* or *\"the human cat\"*—soft in appearance, yet truly harmful. Later, he was exiled and died in Jun.\n\nCan such venom in the heart be justified? Most in the world harbor such malice, yet how many realize that after death, they shall fall into wretched destinies?\n\nLong ago, Lu Zhen had a maidservant named Xiaojin who was suddenly tormented by a female ghost. Though many shamans and exorcists were summoned, none could cure her. They then prayed before the Buddha. One night, Lu dreamed of an old man riding a lion, his form like that of a bodhisattva, who said to him: *\"The one harassing Xiaojin was once the daughter-in-law of the Wu family in the eastern neighbor’s house, named Zhu the Twelfth. For her lifelong malice, she fell into the serpent realm after death. She dwells beneath the great paper mulberry tree by the She Tianzhu Temple, where a passage leads to an underground cavern. Over the years, she has grown into a spirit and gained the power to transform. If you wish to escape this calamity, hasten to a household of good people and hide in secret—then she will not dare approach.\"*\n\nLu followed the warning, and indeed, the ghost no longer came.\n\nYet consider this: when it comes to the heart’s intent, should one wield it with malice—or with goodness? One path leads to death and rebirth in the serpent realm; the other ensures even ghosts dare not draw near. Between these two, you must choose for yourself.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen the raptor strikes, it first conceals its form.\nThe pitfall for men is veiled as level ground.\nSoft words and gentle countenance—\neven foes remain unalarmed.\nYet the venom of aconite and the toxin of the *zhen* bird\nmay still be met with retribution.\nSo too the \"human cat\"—\na name not earned in vain.\n\n**To feed another with defiled food:**\nAs the saying goes, *\"To feed another with defiled food\"*—even our Confucian scholars speak of this. The *Book of Rites* states: *\"Do not return fish or meat\"*—meaning what has passed one’s own lips. Yet if we speak in terms of karmic cause and effect, such acts not only forfeit blessings but surely invite disaster.\n\nHave you not heard of the Venerable Shi-yan and Qu Yongshou?\n\nLong ago, the Venerable Shi-yan abandoned his rank to leave the household life. As his eyes bore a double pupil, his younger brother grew suspicious. To allay doubts, he feigned an eye ailment, constantly wiping his eyes with a cloth—hence his name, \"Wiping-Eyes.\" Yet wherever he went, a radiant glow emanated from him, deepening his unease. One day, as the temple kitchen prepared congee, he removed his undergarments and shook them over the cauldron. That very day, his glow vanished. If feeding others with defiled food does not forfeit blessings, then what does?\n\nQu Yongshou made his living as a rice merchant. In the *yimao* year of the Shaoxing era, he suddenly heard that rice prices had soared. Seizing the moment, he drew water from a paddy field to moisten his grain—unaware that the field had been fertilized with manure. Soon, dark clouds gathered, and thunder roared. Yongshou knew his transgression and feared the worst. Reaching into his sash, he pulled out a string of cash and handed it to a traveling companion, entreating him to return it to his mother. No sooner had he spoken than the skies cleared, and he escaped unharmed. If feeding others with defiled food does not invite disaster, then what does?\n\nYet according to the Buddha’s teachings, the consequences extend far beyond this. After death, one is destined to be reborn as a pig, a dung beetle, or a hungry ghost. How can one fail to guard against this?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe grain of the unrighteous—\neven Master Zhongzi would retch at the taste.\n\nThose who steal to feed others may spit out the food without soiling their teeth, yet to kick it toward them is to invite the beggar’s scorn. If even proper offerings are made without reverence, what merit do the three sacrificial beasts confer? To treat men as beasts—how can this not be deemed callous?\n\n**Left Daoism deludes the masses.**\nAs the saying goes: *Left Dao* refers to sorcery. To make sorcery one’s art—how can it not end in ruin?\n\nHou Mochen Liyue gained favor through leftist arts and rose to become Defense Commissioner of Zhengzhou. Profligate and lawless, he wantonly killed many. Zhao Pu sent men to investigate and uncovered his crimes; he was stripped of his rank, tattooed, and exiled to Shangzhou. Later, Zhao Pu forcefully petitioned for his execution. An imperial edict was issued, dispatching an envoy to cut out his heart as a warning to the masses. Soon after, the court regretted the decision and sent another envoy to spare him. Before long, the messenger’s horse stumbled on the road to Bian, throwing him off and exposing the heart. After switching mounts and hurrying onward, the envoy arrived only to find Liyue’s abdomen already slit open, his corpse stoned and hung from a post at the relay station.\n\nHis son, Li Tan, practiced sorcery and was implicated in the scandal. Father and son were both imprisoned in the Censorate’s dungeon. Once the charges were confirmed, Tan was demoted to Vice Prefect of Nan’enzhou, while his sons were all exiled beyond the Five Ridges. They were escorted out of the city under guard that very day. Later, as his attendants took their leave, Tan took his own life.\n\nYang Qian claimed to have mastered the arts of Mozi, able to command ghosts and spirits, summoning food even when the objects were clenched in another’s fist. He could also refine cinnabar into dry mercury, and none could best him at dice. He could pick locks, alter appearances—nothing was beyond him. At the time, the powerful and eminent all held him in high regard, bestowing upon him offices and robes, which he wore with great pride. Before long, his schemes unraveled, and he was ultimately executed.\n\nMing Chongyan was skilled in sorcery, able to instantly summon objects from a thousand *li* away. One day, while sleeping alone in his chamber, he was suddenly stabbed to death by a ghost.\n\nUpon his death, the dagger remained lodged in his heart, and all said it was because he had overworked the spirits, so they killed him in return.\n\nYet if heterodox ways delude the masses, can this be tolerated?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe people of Qi and Ai were long ago restrained by prohibitions.\nConfucius did not speak of the uncanny, fearing it would disrupt the constant order.\nHumaneness, rightness, ritual, and music—these were the guiding principles of the hundred kings.\nDaily sustenance—nothing more than farming and weaving.\nEven Wen Cheng and Wu Li were executed by Emperor Wu.\nYet now, short measures and narrow gauges prevail.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe *Canon of Shun* states: \"Standardize the pitch-pipes, measures, weights, and balances.\"\nThe *Great Commentary* says: \"When the sage faces south to govern the world, he must begin with the human Dao.\"\nThe human Dao encompasses nine matters, and establishing standards of weight and measure comes first.\nThe *Royal Regulations* states: \"Cloth and silk that do not meet the proper fineness or width shall not be sold in the market.\"\nThe *Monthly Ordinances* says: \"In the mid-autumn days, unify the measures, balance the scales, correct the steelyards, and calibrate the peck and bushel.\"\nMencius said: \"Only by measuring can one know what is long and what is short.\"\nIn ancient times, the Duke of Zhou assembled the feudal lords in the Bright Hall, instituted rites and music, and promulgated standards of measure—whereupon all under heaven submitted.\n\"Measure\" refers to lengths like *zhang* and *chi*, heights and depths, breadths and narrows.\n\"Capacity\" refers to the volumes held by *dou*, *ou*, *dou*, *hu*, baskets, and boxes.\nIn essence, when the human heart is unbalanced, these standards are set to maintain its equilibrium.\nYet now, instead of adhering to this balance, people shorten and narrow their measures—this is to defy the prohibitions of the Most High, to lose the equilibrium of one’s own heart. It is not merely deceiving others but deceiving oneself.\n\nDo you not heed the teachings on the spirit of the heart?\nThe southern recluse Zhu Zhenbai said: \"The world speaks of not deceiving the gods and spirits. I say it is not the gods of heaven and earth one must not deceive, but the spirit of one’s own heart—then one does not deceive the gods and spirits.\"\nSomeone asked the old pedant: \"Should one serve the spirits?\"\nHe replied: \"Serve the spirit of your own heart. No millet, no sacrificial animals—only the practice of not deceiving is of use.\"\n\nAlas, how many truly understand this?\nBecause they do not, short measures and narrow gauges are but the least of their transgressions.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo bend a foot for a yard—this is what the noble man finds shameful.\nGoods that do not meet the measure shall not be sold in the market.\nNot a hair’s breadth of partiality, not a grain’s weight of discrepancy.\nHow dare one adorn the heart of a thief and cast aside public principle?\nWhat harm does it do to the measure? The harm to oneself is far greater.\n\n**Light scales and small measures.**\n**Commentary:**\nHeaven has its Hall of the Dipper and Scale, and man has his use of the dipper and scale. Among the twenty-eight constellations, it is the Star of Zhang that governs them. In this text, the Most High has decreed it a sin.\n\nGenerally, the *zhu* and *li*, the *sheng* and *ge*—these are the daily necessities of the common folk. Every coin, every cash is hard-won. Thus, not a *zhu*, not a *li*, not a *sheng*, not a *ge* may be made light or small.\n\nAccording to the *Cloud Script of the Five Thunders*, during the reign of Chen Houzhu, a man in the market was struck dead by lightning, and on his back were written the words: \"...\" The Daoist adept Li Juzheng recognized them as the four characters for \"light and heavy in scales and measures.\"\n\nFurthermore, in the *Lotus Sutra*, when the scripture was being expounded, ten rakshasa women, along with their children and retinues, made a solemn vow before the Buddha to protect this sutra, saying:\n\"Like the sin of killing one’s parents,\nLike the misfortune of pressing oil,\nLike the crime of cheating with scales and measures,\nLike Devadatta’s sin of splitting the Sangha—\nWhoever harms this Dharma-teacher\nShall incur such retribution.\"\n\nThus, are light scales and small measures truly a minor sin?\n\nFor this reason, Cheng Sichang did not use uneven scales and measures, and was recorded in the ledger of good deeds as having been inspected by the Perfected Warrior and True Lord.\nLi Yongzheng crafted scales that twisted in midair and bushels with false bottoms—these were condemned by the Supreme Emperor, who commanded local spirits to warn him openly and punish him in secret.\nYing Xianwu the Martial and Illustrious repeatedly ignored the warnings until both his eyes were blinded, his wife exiled, his son dead, and he himself reduced to begging in the streets.\n\nAll these are recorded in the annals—how can one not stand in awe?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\n\"Scales arise from the standard weight,\nWeighing things with impartiality.\nMeasures turn and bushels gauge,\nEntrusted with all giving and receiving.\nYet some seek profit,\nDeceiving others’ ears and eyes.\nIndulging private desire,\nThey rely on public instruments.\nScales and measures must not deceive—\nTo deceive the heart is most fearful.\nTo mingle falsehood with truth—\nAs the saying goes: to mingle falsehood with truth,\nLike Lu Chang beneath Mount Lu,\nWho mixed fish fat into oil;\nOr Huang Yu before Jianlong Abbey,\nWho made candles from ox tallow.\nAfter days accumulated, both were struck by thunder.\nGenerally, to deceive and mislead others\nBrings the gravest of sins.\nNot only these two cases are so—\nIn all matters of food and drink,\nMedicinal substances,\nOr even the exchange of gold and silk,\nAny deceit or error is impermissible.\nHave you not heard the tales of the two immortals?\n\nLong ago, when Lü Dongbin first studied the Dao,\nHe met a stranger who taught him the method of nurturing the Dao.\nDongbin said, 'I wish to hear of it.'\nThe stranger replied, 'Boil copper into silver.'\nDongbin asked, 'Will it change?'\n'It will,' said the stranger, 'but only after five hundred years.'\nDongbin said, 'To mislead people five hundred years later—who would wish to learn?'\nWith this single remark, he was named among those hidden in the Celestial Treasury.\nLater, he met Zhongli Quan and thus attained transcendence.\n\nLi Zhen was gentle and frugal,\nNever having wronged another.\nOne day, he met a Daoist who called himself Zhang Qiwu,\nWho taught him the art of transmuting base metals.\nZhen said, 'My fate is meager—I do not wish to learn.'\nQiwu was greatly astonished and said,\n'Your insight surpasses mine.'\nThereupon, he drew his hairpin, wielded it as a sword,\nAnd slashed the earth—it opened.\nHe cast himself into the fissure, and the earth closed behind him.\nThus was he revealed as an immortal,\nAnd later, Zhen too attained the Dao.\n\nYet those who mingle falsehood with truth—\nHow can they avoid falling?\nAfter the deaths of Lu Chang and Huang Yu,\nWhat fate awaited them?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo counterfeit truth with falsehood,\nThe harm to things is but slight.\nYet when men disrupt the constant norms,\nHouseholds and states are imperiled.\nActing like market swindlers,\nDeceitful, greedy, treacherous, and foul,\nThey falsely claim to follow the great current,\nForming cliques and currying favor.\nOnce deceived,\nOne may unknowingly consume the beak of a bird.\n\nTo seize illicit gain—\nAs the *Highest* says: to mingle falsehood with truth.\nIt also says: those who seize illicit gain\nDo not merely mingle falsehood with truth.\n\nLong ago, Yang Bing lived beside the great river.\nEach year, he amassed hay and straw,\nHoping the river would burst its banks to double his profit.\nAt the time, Zhao Changyan governed Tianxiong Prefecture\nAnd learned of his deeds.\nWhen autumn floods came,\nBing again enticed corrupt villagers to breach the dikes.\nThe dike officials sent urgent reports,\nAnd Changyan ordered his men to go directly to Bing’s home,\nSeize all his stored hay and straw,\nAnd use it to reinforce the dikes.\nHe then sent Bing to prison for interrogation,\nAnd the case was concluded with his punishment.\nFrom then on, such harm ceased,\nAnd those dwelling by the river dared not seek illicit gain.\n\nSun Nanjin was adopted as the heir to a wealthy family.\nRelying on his power,\nHe befriended officials and clerks,\nAiding lawsuits and disrupting governance,\nStopping at nothing.\nIn one or two major cases,\nThe officials gained little,\nWhile he alone secretly amassed great wealth,\nAcquiring fields and estates,\nEver more arrogant and overbearing.\nHe even melted coins to forge vessels,\nDrained ponds to catch all the fish,\nExchanged wine for hemp,\nBuilt boats and installed pestles,\nEncroached on waterways,\nAnd seized commoners’ fields.\nWhatever others dared not do,\nHe did without hesitation;\nWhatever others dared not take,\nHe took without restraint.\"\n\nFor several years thus, he suddenly contracted a malignant illness, unable to take food or drink, his spine withered like a jackal’s. When he died, people all said he had already been reborn as a donkey. If this is how one fares by seizing illicit gain, can such conduct be justified?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nProfit through deceitful words,\nAcquisition through cunning schemes.\nTrace his intent—\nA thousand twists, ten thousand turns.\nTrue venom finds no cure,\nLike fire set beneath tinder.\nHis methods sold through treachery,\nHis harm wrought by fierce obsession.\nStinging the blind, gnawing the hidden,\nLike arrowroot, wall-scorpions, and burrowing lizards.\nCrushing the good to serve as the base—\n\nAs the saying goes: *\"Crushing the good to serve as the base\"*—this is precisely what those who deny cause and effect dare to do. How could they know that those now reduced to bondservants and maidservants are all souls who, in past lives, committed sins and accumulated evil until their transgressions numbered one thousand eight hundred? If one who does not truly belong among them is forced into their ranks, this is what is called *\"crushing the good to serve as the base.\"* Would any person of discernment ever consent to such a fate?\n\nLong ago, Ma Juan’s father, having no son in middle age, took a concubine of surpassing beauty.\n\nEach time he trimmed his hair, he would invariably withdraw upon seeing the master, his demeanor as though disheartened. The master, finding this strange, questioned him, to which he replied: \"My father once held such-and-such an office, but died unluckily far from home, leaving no means to return. Thus I was sold into servitude, and even now the period of mourning rites has not yet ended. When I bind my hair, I wrap plain white silk beneath, covering it temporarily with red cloth—I did not wish for you to see it, and there was no other reason.\" The master was moved with pity and, that very day, sought out his mother to return him, moreover providing generous aid.\n\nThat very night, he dreamed of a feather-robed figure who said: \"Heaven bestows upon you a son; joy flows like a stream.\" The following year, a son was indeed born, and he named him *Juan*, meaning \"streamlet\"—this was Juji. When the boy grew and sat for the examinations, the feather-robed figure again entered his dream, saying: \"If you wish to pass, you must be first thirteen times.\" Later, he ranked first in the Imperial Academy, first in the provincial recommendations, and when the roll was called, he stood first in the realm—counting on his fingers, it was indeed thirteen times first.\n\nWhen Cheng Yanbin, Prefect of Luocheng, advanced to attack Suining, the day the city fell, his subordinates presented three maidens, all strikingly beautiful. The master, then in his cups, addressed the girls: \"You are as my own daughters—how dare I offend you?\" He personally sealed the door and confined them to a chamber. At dawn, he sought out their parents and returned them.\n\nThey wept in gratitude, saying: \"We pray the Grand Marshal will soon be granted the banner and staff of command.\" Yanbin replied: \"I dare not hope for such honors—only that when my time comes, I may die without illness, and that will be blessing enough.\" Later, he rose to the rank of Surveillance Commissioner and lived to ninety-seven, passing without sickness. All his sons held office.\n\nWho would say that such deeds go unrewarded? From this, we must know that those who oppress the good and reduce them to servitude will surely incur retribution.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nLou Jing halted the imperial carriage;\nWei Qing was once a bondsman.\nThe lowly must not be despised—\nhow much less the good, who may be oppressed?\nDuke Wen of Jin washed his hands,\nprovoking the anger of Qin’s lady.\nWomen must not be scorned—\nhow much less men?\nAs parents to the people,\nwhat then should be their way?\nBeware deceiving the foolish.\n\n**Tradition says:** All deception is forbidden—\nbut to deceive the foolish is especially forbidden.\nLong ago, Mao Lie built his fortune through injustice. If a man had good fields, Mao would covet them relentlessly until he seized them. There was a man named Chen Qi, whose three younger brothers were still young. He sold all his family’s land at a low price to Mao’s household. When the brothers came of age and divided their inheritance, Chen secretly gathered funds to redeem the land. Mao, however, detained him when he came to reclaim it, refusing to return the deeds. Over time, he grew increasingly deceitful. Chen pleaded his case repeatedly but found no justice, so he went to the shrine of Mount Yue and submitted a petition. Soon after, Mao died; the next day, Chen died as well. Later, Chen revived and said: \"In the courts of Mount Yue, Mao pleaded with me, saying: ‘In my life, I committed such acts thirteen times—all the contracts are in such-and-such a chest in such-and-such a place. When you return, urge my family to search for them and return each to its rightful owner. Only then may my punishment be lessened. Otherwise, my sins will only grow heavier.’\"\n\nZhang Gai owned a grand and stately residence. In need of funds, he mortgaged it to Zhang Jun for a thousand strings of cash. Jun coveted the house and bribed the broker to draft a deed of absolute sale. Once the contract was made, he swapped the first page to turn it into a deed of sale. Years later, when Gai lacked funds and sought to reclaim his property, Jun produced the contract—now a deed of sale. Gai was speechless, left in tears, and looking to the heavens, he cursed: \"May your descendants one day suffer as I do, unable even to speak their grievance.\" Later, Jun’s descendants all lost their voices and died.\n\nCan deceiving others be justified? Even if they are not foolish, it must never be done.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nMeet the blind with respect;\nenter an empty room as if others were present.\nIn darkness, guard your solitude;\nstep outside as if greeting a guest.\nLet your heart be without deceit,\nand regard all things with impartiality.\nThe people may be simple,\nbut even the foolish are watched by the divine.\nWho is more foolish than the common folk?\nThose who deceive themselves.\nGreed knows no bounds.\n\n**Tradition says:** Laozi said: \"He who knows contentment is rich.\" And again: \"No sin is greater than desire; no disaster greater than discontent.\" And: \"Which is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Excessive love leads to great waste; hoarding invites heavy loss. Know contentment and avoid disgrace; know restraint and avoid danger—this is the way to longevity.\"\n\nMozi said: \"It is not that there is no secure dwelling, but no secure heart; not that there is no sufficient wealth, but no contented heart.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"The roc and the wren differ in size; the cedar and the morning mushroom differ in lifespan. Yet each finds its own peace, its own fulfillment.\" These are the words of sages and worthies—models for conduct in the face of wealth.\n\nAlas! People wear clothes only to cover their bodies, yet those draped in thousand-tael furs still feel lacking, unaware that those in patched robes are at ease. They eat only to fill their stomachs, yet those who feast on thousand-coin banquets still feel wanting, unaware that those content with simple fare are joyful. Houses exist only to shelter from wind and rain, yet those in towering mansions with carved walls still feel unsatisfied, unaware that those in huts with earthen windows are at peace. Utensils serve only their purpose, yet those who dine with jade cups and ivory chopsticks still feel deprived, unaware that those who drink from chipped vessels are content.\n\nBecause of this, the heart is never satisfied. How can one awaken to the truth that all things in this world vanish in an instant? This body of ours will ultimately perish. What does not perish is the single luminous essence. Rather than toiling in vain over what is transient, why not devote effort to what is eternal?\n\nLong ago, King Prasenajit asked Śākyamuni Buddha: \"Now that I am weighed down by age, I know I must perish.\" The Buddha said: \"Have you ever seen the waters of the Ganges?\" The king replied: \"When I was three, I saw them.\" The Buddha asked: \"Now that you are sixty, have you seen them again?\" The king said: \"I saw them just yesterday.\" The Buddha asked: \"How do they compare to what you saw at three?\" The king said: \"They are unchanged.\" The Buddha said: \"Though your face is wrinkled, your faculty of sight has never wrinkled. What wrinkles is subject to change; what does not wrinkle is beyond change. What changes must perish; what is beyond change was never born and never dies.\" The king was enlightened in that moment, realizing that after death, life does not cease but continues—there is no true annihilation.\n\nThe Third Patriarch, Śāṇavāsa, asked Upagupta: \"How old are you?\" Upagupta replied: \"I am seventeen.\" The Patriarch asked: \"Is your body seventeen, or is your nature seventeen?\" Upagupta said: \"Master, your hair is white—is it your hair that is white, or your mind?\" The Patriarch said: \"Only my hair is white, not my mind.\" Upagupta said: \"My body is seventeen, but my nature is not seventeen—it is the same.\"\n\nIn general, the body of birth and death cycles through existence, a wheel without beginning or end. Moreover, this flowing mind is unbroken—what appears as bubbles rising and vanishing is but delusion. From the first moment of consciousness to the last breath, it is all the same.\n\nIf all in the world could awaken to this truth, then that single point of luminous clarity would remain ever evident. Once it emerges, what fear of lacking fortune? What wealth or possessions could ever be wanting?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nHow brief is man’s sojourn in the world—\nmorning dew clinging to the stalk,\nautumn leaves parting from the branch.\nLife has its bounds; why must one seek excess?\nThe ruins of Deer Terrace,\nthe slopes of Black Dragon Palace—\nwealth exhausted, rank at its height,\nall crumble into mounds and hollows.\n\nAs the *Tradition* states: \"So-called curses need not be formally inscribed in memorials. Whenever, in the heat of anger and dispute, one recklessly invokes spirits, that is a curse.\" According to the *Chapter on Oaths and Curses*, if one utters curses, then beneath the ninefold earth, in the four cardinal directions and four intermediate quarters, within mountains and marshes, upon the five kinds of soil, malevolent ghosts—those who exact punishment through curses and oaths, those who transmit lingering corpse qi, the ghosts of the Five Hills and Five Graves, spirits that bring calamity and harm, the ghosts of deceased officials and earthly essences, the ghosts of plague and pestilence that deplete and destroy, specters and demons, inauspicious and ruinous spirits, the ghosts of the five directions and five soils that rebound with retribution, those that lurk and linger without retreat, the ghosts that bind and strangle, that execute and kill, that spread epidemic and flood—all manner of vicious ghosts seize the opportunity to inflict harm. Unless one submits a memorial to seek absolution, invoking the Heavenly Master’s Generals—*Breaker of Ghosts*, *Destroyer of Temples*, and *Terminator of Curses*—to descend and disperse them, such curses cannot easily be eradicated.\n\nYet is it truly worth seeking vindication through curses?\n\nIn former times, the Zhang family, father and son, would quarrel in anger and point to heaven and revile the sun. Later, when the son and his nephew disputed their inheritance, they too sacrificed to ghosts and invoked spirits, cursing one another. Within a few years, nearly all perished; only one branch, uninvolved in the strife, remained—yet even they declined, never matching their former prosperity.\n\nThere was also Elder Yang, who frequented the home of a widow, appearing quite intimate. Some spoke of it. The widow, fierce by nature, could not contain her rage and called upon heaven and sacrificed to ghosts to curse him. Within a year, the widow and Elder Yang died on the same day. Was it that, at the time, there was no truth to the rumors, and she sought only to clear her name? Or was there truth, and she acted merely to silence the slander? Otherwise, how could two die on the same day? Whether the affair was real or not, none can say—yet it serves as a warning.\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\n\"In the *Rites of Zhou*, the five modes of hearing reveal nothing hidden in speech or countenance. How could mere words suffice? For therein lies the liver and kidneys. When rival states forge alliances, the king’s grace is thus extinguished. Excessive speech leads to repeated failure—better to endure with silence. If one heeds only the divine, how can trust be shown? Thus concludes the twenty-fourth scroll of the *Taishang Ganying Pian*.\n\n---\n\nThe *Taishang Ganying Pian*, Scroll Twenty-Eight\n*Biography of Li Changling*\n*Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi*\n\nIt is said: Spitting or urinating toward the north—\n\nThe *Tradition* records: Yang Ziyun wrote an essay arguing that during the Spring and Autumn period, day and night were of equal length, for the sun rose due east at *mao* and set due west at *you*. Huan Tan, however, composed his *New Treatise* to refute him, saying: \"Ziyun’s argument refers to the *mao* and *you* of the human realm, not the celestial *mao* and *you*. The celestial *mao* and *you* align with the Northern Dipper’s pole. The pole is the Celestial Pivot; the pivot is the axis of heaven. Just as a canopy has its *baodou* (central pin), though the canopy turns, the *baodou* remains fixed—so too does the Northern Pole, though heaven revolves. From man’s perspective, the north is indeed north, yet not the true center of heaven. Thus, during the Spring and Autumn period, the sun’s rising and setting always occurred near the Southern Dipper. One must recognize that heaven turns like a canopy, its northern path ever distant, its southern path ever near. How could day and night have been equal? Ziyun, at a loss, could not rebut him. From this, we know all the more that the Dipper is the center of heaven—no doubt remains.\n\nTherefore, the Primordial Supreme Lord calls the Northern Pole the *Central Pole*, and the Precious Upper Perfected One names the Northern Dipper’s seven stars the *Seven Stars of the Central Heaven*. Even our Confucians say: 'The Dipper is the Emperor’s Chariot, revolving at the center, governing the four directions, dividing yin and yang, establishing the four seasons, balancing the five phases, shifting the nodal measures, and fixing all celestial markers.' Who could deny this?\n\nIn ancient times, the Heavenly Sovereign’s Northern Pole and the Northern Dipper’s seven stars transformed and took form from within the Seven-Treasure Lotus, coalescing into radiant light. They flew to the Central Pole, nine million nine hundred thousand *li* above the earth, and manifested as the Nine Great Treasure Palaces—the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, the Great Void Palace, and the Curved Array’s domain—where they grasp the talismans and charts, govern the primordial transformations, and preside as lords over all stars.\n\n- **Greedy Wolf** aligns with Heaven as the *Celestial Origin*, governing the body.\n- **Giant Gate** aligns with Earth as the *Terrestrial Origin*, governing fate.\n- **Salary Store** aligns with Fire as the *Solar Origin*, governing fortune.\n- **Literary Curved** aligns with Wood as the *Lunar Origin*, governing emolument.\n- **Integrity Perfected** aligns with Earth as the *River Origin*, governing official rank.\n- **Martial Curved** aligns with Water as the *River Origin*, governing longevity.\n- **Broken Army** aligns with Metal as the *Oceanic Origin*, governing wives and children.\n\nEach star commands thirty-six palaces, and each palace oversees thirty-six bureaus. The Three Realms and the Ten Directions, the hundred spirits and host of perfected beings, all submit to their authority. Thus, is not the Central Heaven’s Northern Pole most revered? How could the dwelling of such majesty be defiled?\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of Longevity*, the term *north* need not mean true north. In spring, it is east; in summer, south; in autumn, west; in winter, north—wherever the lunar station points, one violates the Dipper’s handle, swiftly diminishing lifespan. Beware!\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe aim of self-mastery: move not without propriety.\"\n\nSpitting without regard—brave yet devoid of righteousness.\nUrinating into a basket—even plucking every hair would not suffice to atone.\nStanding firm without shifting one’s ground—this the noble person holds weighty.\nHow much more so for dwelling in the north, where all stars converge in reverence?\n\nFacing the hearth to chant or weep:\nAs the *Yellow Emperor’s Scripture of the Hearth* states, one must not sing, recite poetry, weep, curse, or shout at the hearth’s entrance. All such admonitions align with the foregoing.\nYet people see the hearth as mere piled bricks and clay—how could they know its mighty power, its inviolability, to be thus?\n\nLong ago on Mount Song stood a temple of extraordinary numinosity. Within its hall stood only a hearth, utterly untouchable; to approach was to court disaster. Thus, from near and far, offerings and prayers came without cease. One day, a Chan master arrived at the temple, strode directly into the hall, and struck the hearth thrice with his staff, saying: “You are but clay molded together—where does your sacredness arise? From whence comes your spirit? How dare you thus boil and butcher living beings?” Having spoken, he struck thrice more, and the hearth shattered at his touch.\n\nPresently, a green-robed attendant emerged, his tall cap swaying as he leapt forth. Bowing to the master, he said: “I am the hearth spirit of this temple. Long have I craved requital, but now, through the Chan master’s teaching of the *Endurance of the Unborn Dharma*, I have attained liberation from this place and shall be reborn in heaven. How could I not offer my deepest gratitude?” The master replied: “This is your inherent nature—no coercion from my words.” The spirit bowed again and vanished.\n\nThereafter, people called the master “Breaker of the Hearth.” Later, a monk who had long served at his side asked: “Though I have been near you for years, you never once guided me to enlighten this hearth. By what principle did it swiftly attain rebirth in heaven?” The master said: “I merely pointed out that you are but clay molded together—there is no other truth.” The monk stood in contemplation, and the master asked: “Do you understand?” “I do not,” the monk replied. The master said: “Your inherent nature—what is there not to understand?” The monk bowed in reverence. The master exclaimed: “Fallen! Fallen! Shattered! Shattered!” The monk then experienced great awakening.\n\nAlas! This hearth, upon hearing the Chan master’s words, swiftly attained the *Endurance of the Unborn Dharma*. If such is the case, how could chanting or weeping before it not invite the calamity of blasphemy?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nSilence at meals, no words to speak;\nFeasts are not the place for sighs.\nSorrow and joy each have their kind,\nEach with its proper time and place.\nHow can chanting or weeping be recklessly performed?\nNot only does it profane the divine,\nBut it disrupts the proper order.\nAttend to your duties with reverence,\nAnd be mindful of silence.\n\nMoreover, burning incense in the hearth fire:\nAs the tradition states: According to the statutes of the Heavenly Master’s school,\nThe ashes and embers beneath the hearth are called *\"Hidden Dragon’s Dung\"*—\nThus, incense must not be burned there.\n\nI have perused the scriptures and teachings,\nAnd the prohibitions regarding incense and fire extend beyond this single case.\nFor instance, oil-stained paper wicks must not be used to ignite paper money,\nFor this is called *\"Wasted Accumulation of Wax Coins.\"*\nPiled high as mountains in the Eastern Peak,\nYet the celestial and terrestrial offices of yin and yang all refuse them.\n\nAgain, when making offerings to the Perfected Warrior,\nIn summer, plums must not be used;\nIn winter, pomegranates must not be used.\nWhen inviting the descent of the Highest Perfected,\nOne must not burn *\"Nipple Incense\"* or sandalwood,\nFor these are called *\"Bathing Incense.\"*\nThe *\"Monthly Rose\"* is called the *\"Untimely Flower,\"*\nThe *\"Golden Paulownia\"* is called the *\"Ghost Flower.\"*\nAll these must be avoided.\nFor what is better—to heed these prohibitions with reverence,\nOr to disregard them and invite offense?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nFire, as recorded in the Zhou canon, is dispensed and received in due time. When the burning-mirror draws from the sun, its purity and sincerity are manifest. Where reverent intent resides, there may sacrifice and prayer be offered. Yet to gather smoldering embers—this is not fitting. If even one thing is not done with care, the gods will take heed.\n\nImpure firewood makes impure food. As the saying goes: though the firewood may not burn, its qi still rises upward—this is why impure firewood must not be used for cooking. Have you not heard of the matters of *\"labored firewood\"* and *\"refined charcoal\"*? Once, Xun Xu was seated beside the emperor when the royal chef presented the meal. Xu said: \"This must have been cooked with labored firewood.\" The emperor did not believe him, but upon summoning the chef and questioning him, it was confirmed that an old carriage axle had indeed been used for fuel. Yang Shou, though he ate plain fare, always cooked with charcoal. One day, Li Zhang hosted a banquet for his two sons, also using charcoal for the fire. The two sons would not touch the food, barely nibbling on some fruit instead. Their retainer, the monk Shenggang Lian, asked: \"Even if other dishes are inedible, what fault lies in rice cooked with charcoal?\" The two sons replied: \"When cooking with charcoal, one must first burn the charcoal until it is hot, hence the name *refined charcoal*. Otherwise, it still carries smoke and qi—this is why we do not eat it.\" Alas! A carriage axle was used for fuel, yet Xun Xu recognized it as labored firewood; the charcoal was not properly refined, yet the two sons still avoided its smoky odor. How much more so, then, should one avoid using impure firewood when preparing offerings for the gods?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nMillet is called *\"bright grain,\"*\nThe first taste precedes the sacrifice.\nVegetarian meals are prepared with care,\nTransforming simple fare into a grand feast.\nThe bounty of Heaven must be honored,\nWith no hint of negligence.\nThe fire’s measure must be precise,\nThe firewood pure and bright.\nFor offerings to guests and gods alike,\nPurity is paramount—what barrier lies between man and spirit?\n\nTo rise naked at night: As the *Daoist Canon* states, the sun and moon each span eight hundred and forty *li*. The sun travels through *qian*, the moon through *kun*; the sun gains clarity from the moon’s essence, the moon gains brightness from the sun’s spirit. Clarity is their qi, radiance their substance. Yin and yang are their Way, the crow and hare their symbols. *Mao* and *you* are their paths, day and night their cycles. Their union is their function. Generally, day belongs to yang, night to yin—night is the time when the hundred spirits converge, and to be naked then risks offense. Have you not heard of Huang Sangou and Yuan Qing? Once, Zhu Shoucheng was robbed three nights in a row, yet the thieves could not enter.\n\nThe bandit leader Huang Sangou, enraged, was determined to fulfill his intent. He returned once more, but as he entered the second gate, he saw flames blazing fiercely, and several armored warriors shouting to seize him. Terrified, Huang Sangou scrambled to escape, unwittingly wounding his own men in the chaos. When the case was tried, the armored warriors he had seen were none other than the attendant deities from the portrait of Zhenwu worshipped in Zhu Shoucheng’s home.\n\nThe courtesan Yang Suzhen of Shanzhou lived alone and had amassed great wealth. The military officer Yuan Qing, through a hundred schemes, seduced her, and they became husband and wife. He took all her possessions and set off with her for the capital. Stopping at Mengyang, he got Yang Suzhen drunk that very night and drowned her in the deep abyss. By chance, Zhenwu was passing through the heavens at that moment and saved her, restoring her to life. Thus, even in the dead of night in a secluded place, who can say there are no divine spirits? How then could one rise naked at night?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nDwell with body ever covered,\nGaze not below the sash.\nIn all form and appearance,\nMove as though in reverent caution.\nCarelessness invites theft,\nDiligence knows no rest.\nHow can one claim the dark is hidden,\nAnd thus indulge in ruin?\nBy this, one may examine fortune—\nNo need for tortoise or milfoil.\n\nThe Eight Nodal Days for Enforcing Punishment\n\nIt is transmitted: The Shangqing Perfected says: On the eight nodal days, one should devote oneself to good deeds and avoid anger, resentment, or strife. These are great taboos for heaven and humanity, and the offenses incurred are no small matter—how much less should one dare to carry out punishments? Generally, on these days, the Primordial Celestial Worthy dispatches the Heavenly Worthies, Heavenly Lords, Heavenly Emperors, divine immortals, and countless hosts of celestial soldiers to transform and enlighten the world, opening the path to salvation for all beings. The Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, also descend to record merits and transgressions.\n\nFor example, the sun’s usual course is along the Red Way, the moon’s along the Yellow Way. But at the Beginning of Spring, the sun travels the Green Way, emerging east of the Yellow Way. The Three Primordial Sovereign Ladies ascend to the Celestial August Emperor, roaming the Primordial Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of Ascending Saints, together with the Lord of the Beginning Azure Heavens, descend.\n\nAt the Beginning of Summer, the sun travels the Red Way, emerging south of the Yellow Way. The Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate and the Three Primordial Perfected ascend to the Purple Tenuity Palace, roaming the Mystic Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of Cherishing Life, together with the Lord of the Beginning Vermilion Heavens, descend.\n\nAt the Beginning of Autumn, the moon travels the White Way, emerging west of the Yellow Way. The Supreme Perfected White Emperor of the Great Simplicity ascends to the High Perfected of the Jade Heaven, roaming the Primordial Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous Void, together with the Lord of the Beginning Pale Heavens, descend.\n\nAt the Beginning of Winter, the moon travels the Black Way, emerging north of the Yellow Way. The Perfected of the Highest Clarity, the Imperial Lord, and the August Ancestor ascend to the Supreme Jade Emperor of the Nine Heavens, roaming the Grotto Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Infinite Great Flower, together with the Lord of the Beginning Mystic Heavens, descend.\n\nAt the Spring Equinox, the sun again travels the Green Way, emerging east of the Yellow Way. The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity ascends to the Supreme Jade Emperor, roaming the Beginning Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, together with the Azure Spirit Beginning Elder Emperor, descend.\n\nAt the Autumn Equinox, the moon travels the White Way, emerging west of the Yellow Way. The Supreme Perfected Red Emperor of the Southern Culmen ascends to the Nine Numinous Ladies of the Upper Terrace of Langfeng, roaming the Bright Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Mystery, together with the Radiant Spirit August Elder Emperor, descend.\n\nAt the Summer Solstice, the sun travels the Red Way, emerging south of the Yellow Way. The Great Emperor of Fusang ascends to the Supreme Tenuity Palace, roaming and receiving the Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Myriad Blessings of the Mystic Perfected, together with the Vermilion Spirit Perfected Elder Emperor, descend.\n\nAt the Winter Solstice, the moon travels the Black Way, emerging north of the Yellow Way. The Supreme Perfected of the Great Empyrean and the Jade Consort of the Great Void ascend to the Supreme Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Palace, roaming the Pure Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Dawn of the Mystic Empyrean, together with the Five Spirit Mystic Elder Emperor, descend.\n\nAll beings that contain *qi*, on these days, undergo transformations—soaring, creeping, plants and trees rising and sinking—responding to conditions, shedding the old and embracing the new. The light may become heavy, the heavy may become light; good and evil reverse, and the movements of *qi* and images proceed naturally.\n\nScholars of the higher studies, on these days, should meditate and offer prayers, adapting to change, cultivating good and eliminating evil, advancing brightness and abandoning darkness, entering rectitude and governing perversity, refining the false into the true, striving to ascend to sagehood, opening the path to salvation for all beings, and bringing forth the myriad things—thus aligning with the intentions of the Most High and the host of Perfected. Those who carry out punishments—what petty creatures dare act thus?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe primordial *qi* flows and circulates,\nEach with its allotted measure.\n\nThe Dipper turns and stars shift, the cauldron renews and the old is transformed. Rewards and punishments serve Heaven, following the patterns of images and numbers. The seasons unfold their beginnings, and the impulse of life resides within. Revering the times and receiving blessings, one should restrain might and anger. Yet some spit at shooting stars.\n\nIt is said in tradition: The divine descends from the Dipper and the Celestial Master is born; the brilliance divides at *Xu* and *Wei* and True Warrior is born; the Maiden’s Node senses the star and the White Emperor is born; a shooting star enters the mouth and Master Ye is born. How then do stars divide their numinous essence and nurture brilliance?\n\nA shooting star is but one kind of star. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* states: Some see two suns or two moons, or even halos, jade pendants, comets, flying and streaming stars, inverted rainbows, and double rainbows—all these are inauspicious signs. The *Erya* says: A fleeing star is called *yue*, which is a shooting star; a broom star is called *chan*, and a rushing star is called *bei*.\n\nPeople know only that fleeing and streaming stars are ominous, yet they do not realize that such stars are not inherently ominous—rather, ominousness is self-invited. One should be fearful, swiftly cultivate and reflect. How then can the virtue of expiation be met with contemptuous spitting? Have you not heard of Duke Jing’s three wise words, by which *Yinghuo* retreated three lodgings?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nThe celestial messenger of shooting stars soars through the vast heavens.\nTheir portents of fortune or misfortune gather where disaster or blessing alights.\nWhen a meteorite fell in Song, it was taken as an omen;\nwhen one struck Zhuge Liang’s camp, his fate was sealed.\nWhen movements stir above,\nhow dare one fail in reverence and awe?\n\nThe doctrine of suppression and triumph arose from the eastern lands of Qi.\n(They point to rainbows and halos.)\nAs the *Yan Kong Tu* states: “The *ni* is the disorder of the Dipper.”\nWhen the essence of the Dipper strays from its proper measure, it casts forth *ni* in response.\nThe *He Tu Ji Yao Gou* says: “When the Star of Stability scatters, it becomes the rainbow and *ni*.”\nThe *Chun Qiu Yun Dou Shu* says: “When stars scatter, they form rainbows.”\nOne must recognize that rainbows and *ni* are indeed the residual *qi* of the Dipper manifesting in form and color.\n\nIn former times, Confucius composed the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and compiled the *Classic of Filial Piety*.\nUpon completion, he purified himself and, facing the Northern Dipper, declared the purpose of his writings.\nSuddenly, a crimson rainbow descended from the heavens, transforming into a yellow jade inscribed with characters.\nConfucius knelt and received it.\nWho can deny that rainbows and *ni* are the residual *qi* of the Dipper?\nShould one rashly point at them, how could one escape blame?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nWhen the rainbow arches in the east, no poet dares point to it.\nThe white rainbow pierces the sun—Gao Jianli crosses the Yi River.\nThe *Li Sao* alludes to petty men, its intent shared with the whirlwind.\nWhen celestial signs transform, calamities arise.\nThose who witness them stand in awe—how could they regard them lightly?\nTo rashly point at the Three Luminaries—\n\nThe tradition states: The Most High says: If you see the sun, the moon, the Northern Dipper, or the Southern Dipper, you must reverently bow your head, beseeching protection. Speak aloud, invoking the Most Sacred, the Most Honored, the True Sovereign, the True Lord, entreating mercy for mortal folly and pardon for transgressions. Then bow twice—do not treat them with disdain, lest you invite misfortune.\n\nCan the Three Luminaries be pointed at?\nThe Three Luminaries are the sun, the moon, and the stars.\nSince the sun and moon are already too distant below, let us speak of the Northern Dipper, the Southern Dipper, the Five Elders, the Five Stars, and the Twenty-Eight Constellations.\n\nGenerally, those who cultivate blessings in the world are few, while those who commit evil are many. Thus, for years they falter, year after year they suffer hardship, and few find peace. If one receives the protection of the Lord of the Nine Yi of the East, the Venerable Lord of the Hu, the Lord of the Year Star Chonghua, and the lords of the seven lodges—Jiao, Kang, Di, Fang, Xin, Wei, and Ji—one may resolve the disasters of the three destinies, punishments, and harms in the years, months, days, and hours of yin, mao, chen, jia, and yi. Within the eighty-one myriad paces of the eastern quadrant, the *qi* of the five disasters, nine calamities, and earthly harms may be repelled. In the first, second, and third months, one may be safeguarded from misfortune.\n\nIf one receives the protection of the Lord of the Eight Man of the South, the Venerable Lord of the Yue, the Lord of the Fire Virtue and the Sparkling Deluder, the Lord of the Great Yang and the Southern Dipper, and the lords of the seven lodges—Jing, Gui, Liu, Xing, Zhang, Yi, and Zhen—one may resolve the disasters of the three destinies, punishments, and harms in the years, months, days, and hours of si, wu, wei, bing, and ding. Within the sixty-four myriad paces of the southern quadrant, the *qi* of the five disasters, nine calamities, and metallic harms may be repelled. In the fourth, fifth, and sixth months, one may be safeguarded from misfortune.\n\nIf one receives the protection of the Lord of the Six Rong of the West, the Venerable Lord of the Shi, the Lord of the Metal Virtue and Venus, and the lords of the seven lodges—Kui, Lou, Wei, Mao, Bi, Zi, and Shen—one may resolve the disasters of the three destinies, punishments, and harms in the years, months, days, and hours of shen, you, xu, geng, and xin. Within the thirty-six myriad paces of the western quadrant, the *qi* of the five disasters, nine calamities, and wooden harms may be repelled. In the seventh, eighth, and ninth months, one may be safeguarded from misfortune.\n\nIf one receives the protection of the Lord of the Five Di of the North, the Venerable Lord of the Qiang, the Lord of the Water Virtue and Mercury, the Lord of the Great Yin and the Northern Dipper, and the lords of the seven lodges—Dou, Niu, Nü, Xu, Wei, Shi, and Bi—one may resolve the disasters of the three destinies, punishments, and harms in the years, months, days, and hours of hai, zi, chou, ren, and gui. Within the twenty-five myriad paces of the northern quadrant, the *qi* of the five disasters, nine calamities, and fiery harms may be repelled. In the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth months, one may be safeguarded from misfortune.\n\nIf one receives the protection of the Lord of the Three Qin of the Center, the Venerable Lord of the Cang, the Lord of the Earth and the Star of Stability, and the lords of the seven lodges—[...], Gouchen—one may resolve the disasters of the three destinies, punishments, and harms in the years, months, days, and hours of chen, xu, chou, wei, wu, and ji. The *qi* of earthly harms in the center may be repelled, accumulated malevolent spirits may be dispelled, and within the four seasons, one may be safeguarded from misfortune.\n\nCan the Three Luminaries be rashly pointed at?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nEmperor Yao faced south, gazing upon the central stars.\nShun aligned the Seven Governances, with jade and pivoting instruments of observation.\nWith reverence and diligence, he observed and contemplated, examining all affairs.\nShining and overseeing from above, nothing hidden was left unnoticed.\nThose who rashly point—common folk without understanding—dare to gaze long upon the sun and moon.\n\nIt is transmitted: The Sun Sovereign, Lord of the Sun, presides as the supreme overseer of the Yang Palace, with the twenty-eight lodges as his subordinate officials. The Moon Sovereign, Lady of the Moon, presides as the supreme overseer of the Yin Palace, governing the five sacred peaks and the twenty-four *qi*, administering the mountains as Earthly Controllers, and the Three Rivers, Four Seas, Nine Jiang, and Twelve Streams as the Water Bureau.\n\nEach year comprises twenty-four *qi*, and at the beginning of each seasonal *qi*, the Sun Sovereign, Lord of the Sun, arrives first, patrolling the corresponding lodge for that *qi*. On that day, the Moon Sovereign, Lady of the Moon, also arrives. On such days, the twenty-four *qi* govern the mountains. The Lords of the Twenty-Four *Qi* each compile the good and evil, disasters and blessings, longevity and fortune, life and death of the world’s people, submitting them to their respective sacred peaks. The Controller of Destiny of each peak then transcribes and presents them to the Yin and Yang Sovereigns patrolling the lodge of that *qi*.\n\nAt the *Li Chun* (Beginning of Spring) *qi*, the report is made at the Xu Lodge, with the Yongquan Yin Official, Left Supervisor of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Yu Shui* (Rain Water) *qi*, at the Wei Lodge, with the Beiping Yin Official, Right Supervisor of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Jing Zhe* (Awakening of Insects) *qi*, at the Shi and Bi Lodges, with the Chougeng Yin Official, Left Inspector of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Chun Fen* (Spring Equinox) *qi*, at the Kui Lodge, with the Scribe Yin Official, Right Minister of Merit of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Qing Ming* (Pure Brightness) *qi*, at the Lou Lodge, with the Mengqin Yin Official, Left Director of Merit of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Gu Yu* (Grain Rain) *qi*, at the Wei Lodge, with the Pinggai Yin Official, Right Director of Merit of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Li Xia* (Beginning of Summer) *qi*, at the Mao Lodge, with the Yuntai Yin Official, Left Supervisor of Merit of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Xiao Man* (Lesser Fullness) *qi*, at the Bi Lodge, with the Jinkou Yin Official, Right Supervisor of Merit of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Mang Zhong* (Grain in Ear) *qi*, at the Zi and Shen Lodges, with the Gongmu Yin Official, Right Capital *Qi* Lord.\nAt the *Xia Zhi* (Summer Solstice) *qi*, at the Jing Lodge, with the Yuju Yin Official, Left Inspector of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Xiao Shu* (Lesser Heat) *qi*, at the Gui Lodge, with the Pinggang Yin Official, Left Minister of Merit of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Da Shu* (Greater Heat) *qi*, at the Liu Lodge, with the Beimang Yin Official, Right Inspector of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Li Qiu* (Beginning of Autumn) *qi*, at the Xing Lodge, with the Gegui Yin Official, Right Director of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Chu Shu* (End of Heat) *qi*, at the Zhang Lodge, with the Houcheng Yin Official, Left Capital *Qi* Lord.\nAt the *Bai Lu* (White Dew) *qi*, at the Yi Lodge, with the Benzhu Yin Official, Right Inspector of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Qiu Fen* (Autumn Equinox) *qi*, at the Zhen Lodge, with the Qinzhong Yin Official, Left Director of the Spirit *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Han Lu* (Cold Dew) *qi*, at the Jiao and Kang Lodges, with the Yangping Yin Official, Left Pacifier of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Shuang Jiang* (Frost Descent) *qi*, at the Di Lodge, with the Heming Yin Official, Left Elder of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Li Dong* (Beginning of Winter) *qi*, at the Fang Lodge, with the Liyuan Yin Official, Right Elder of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Xiao Xue* (Lesser Snow) *qi*, at the Xin and Wei Lodges, with the Gengchu Yin Official, Right Capital Director of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Da Xue* (Greater Snow) *qi*, at the Ji Lodge, with the Shangzhi Yin Official, Left Capital Supervisor of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Dong Zhi* (Winter Solstice) *qi*, at the Dou Lodge, with the Zhenduo Yin Official, Right Director of the Spirit *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Xiao Han* (Lesser Cold) *qi*, at the Niu Lodge, with the Changli Yin Official, Left Capital Supervisor of the *Qi* Lords.\nAt the *Da Han* (Greater Cold) *qi*, at the Nü Lodge, with the Lutang Yin Official, Right Pacifier of the *Qi* Lords.\n\nThen, may the sun and moon be gazed upon for long?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nAt ancient times, the lord of men would face the sun at dawn and the moon at dusk. They oversaw the receipt and disbursement of offerings, presiding over the regulation of *qi*. In the Bamboo Palace, they performed rites of obeisance—such rites endured even into the Han. Yet as canonical rituals gradually fell into disuse, reverence and diligence waned. What purpose remains in vacant gazing, if the torch’s flame extinguishes itself?\n\n*The Twenty-Eighth Scroll of the* Supreme Scripture on Stimulus and Response *concludes here.*\n\n*The Twenty-Ninth Scroll of the* Supreme Scripture on Stimulus and Response\n\n*The Biography of Li Changling*\n*In Praise of Zheng Qingzhi*\n\nIn spring, they would hunt with fire.\nIt is recorded: Cheng Sichang, throughout his life, observed the precept against killing and never engaged in butchery. While in Mizhou, he witnessed several hunters trapping birds—some with heads crushed or chests pierced beneath the talons and beaks of hawks and owls, others with legs broken or wings torn in snares and nets. That very night, he burned incense beneath the open sky and declared: “I intend to take all living beings my family consumes, along with the karmic ties of my seven generations of ancestors, and compile them into an *Illustrated Precept Against Killing*, then print and distribute it. Perhaps this land may yet awaken to reform.”\n\nAfter printing and circulating the work, a man named Peng Jing requested a copy. His wife, née Hua, upon seeing it, flew into a rage, seized the book, tore it to shreds, and cast it into filth. The next day, she bought a fish and prepared to slice it for minced fish. Suddenly, the fish leapt, striking her eye and splattering blood across the floor. In an instant, the blood transformed into worms, swarming and coiling around her body. Amid the uproar, the regional inspector, Xiang Shuhuang, beheld the Perfected Warrior Lord, who declared: “I have observed this land and found one of supreme goodness—Cheng Sichang, a sojourner from Xinghua Commandery, who printed and distributed the *Illustrated Precept Against Killing*. Yet this woman, Hua, dared to tear it apart. Her sins are grave, and she cannot escape retribution. As for the rest of the unrepentant, they too shall incur punishment.”\n\nWhen I descend again on the twenty-seventh day, I shall observe what transpires further. Yet is hunting with fire permissible? It is lamentable that people do not recognize that all sentient beings possess the Buddha-nature. If guided by righteousness, none would fail to comprehend.\n\nIn former times, when Wei Nan’gang governed Shu, there was a parrot of remarkable intelligence. Its keeper, instructing it in the Dao of the Buddha, said: “If you wish to recite the Buddha’s name, begin with thought, and from thought proceed to thoughtlessness.” The parrot lifted its head and flapped its wings, as though listening and assenting. When bidden to recite the Buddha’s name, it remained silent. Questioned why it did not recite, it suddenly cried out, “Amitābha Buddha!”—its intent seemingly awakened: it took thought as conditioned arising, and thoughtlessness as the true limit.\n\nOne day, without trembling or falling, it folded its wings, drew in its feet, and passed away in stillness. When cremated, ten śarīra relics appeared. The governor had a stupa built to inter them, naming it the Parrot Stupa. Who would claim it lacked the Buddha-nature?\n\nLady Li, wife of Wei Jingyu, was widowed at twenty. Though her parents urged her to remarry, she vowed never to consent. A pair of swallows nested in her home; one day, one flew off alone. Moved by this, Li said to it: “Can you be like me?” She tied a thread to its foot. The next year, it returned alone as before. Li composed a poem:\n\n*Last year you left without a mate,*\n*This spring you still return alone.*\n*Our bond runs deep—how could I bear*\n*To see you fly again as one?*\n\nThe following year, it returned once more, only to find Li already dead. Told of her death and burial place, it flew straight to her grave, cried out in grief, refused food, and perished. The people buried it there, calling it the Swallow’s Mound. Who would claim it lacked devotion to righteousness?\n\nThe Most High warns against hunting with fire, particularly in spring, for spring is the season when all things come to life. If one indulges in such hunting, the harm from the chase may yet be counted; but the passage of a single fire—can its toll be numbered? The *Monthly Ordinances* likewise admonishes against it. How can one fail to heed this warning?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe Zhou rites and Xia hunts selected only barren game,\nYet even spring’s culling spared the breeding fowl.\nThe intent was to train troops, not to slaughter wantonly.\nBirds and beasts mate and rear their young when life’s course runs smooth.\nHow could a humane heart bear to burn the forest for sport?\n\nTo revile while facing north—how much worse! As the tradition states: The Venerable Bhaguka, before attaining arhatship, once cursed a man for eating slowly, calling him an “ox chewing grass.” Even after becoming an arhat, he could not escape the karmic retribution of being fed like an ox. The deva prince Sudarśana, in his former life, once reviled a visiting monk as a “blind fool.” When his heavenly blessings were exhausted, he too could not avoid the retribution of blindness. Who would claim that malicious speech is harmless? How much more so when directed toward the north?\n\nThe north is where the Supreme One dwells, home to the Northern Asterism. Among its five stars, the first is the Heavenly August Emperor, and the fifth is the Northern Culmen Emperor. Of the Dipper’s nine stars, the seventh is the Star of Ruinous War, known as the Celestial Supreme Thearch, the Mysterious Yang Gate, the Radiant Brilliance, the Most High Jade Sovereign Dao Lord—his majesty is beyond all others.\n\nAccording to the *Sutra of Past Lives*, the Primordial Supreme Thearch declared: “If faithful men and women, on the first spring day, wholeheartedly observe purification rites, reverently invoke the divine, and perform the Ninefold Radiance Offering to welcome the Purple Radiance Holy Mother and the Seven Primal Lords, then even the gravest of the ten evils, the bitterest of karmic retributions, shall melt like ice beneath the nine suns. Their blessings and longevity shall increase, immeasurable heavenly perfected beings shall gather to protect them, their present life shall be fulfilled, their descendants shall flourish, and their merit and virtue shall flow like a sweet spring, ever replenishing, boundless in use. After death, they shall ascend to the Great Brahmā Heaven of True Reality.”\n\nHow, then, can one revile while facing north? Have you not heard how Envoy Liu, through a life-mandate offering, was indeed pardoned of his sins, and how Yanlou, through prayers for his father, did indeed secure his extended years?\n\nHave you further not heard how Li Da, through his devout service, begot the future Duke Wei, a meritorious minister of Tang; and how the Marquis of Wu’s daughter, emulating the filial Peng maiden in her devotions, likewise ascended to the heavens? These accounts are all recorded in the sacred canons, and such instances are too numerous to recount—here but a few are cited to instruct the world.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nWhen mortals face north, they turn in reverence toward their sovereign.\nWhen heaven’s north pole is named, it is called the Celestial Apex and the Dipper.\nIn the span between bowing and raising one’s head,\nthere should be no careless word or deed.\nOnce, while combing his hair, Guan Ning recalled his past transgressions.\nIf even in quiet seclusion one must not offend,\nhow much less dare one loose one’s tongue in idle speech?\n\nWithout cause, to kill a tortoise or strike a snake—\nthe scriptures say: The Perfected One of the Manifest World declared:\n“None among the winged or creeping beings may be slain.\nOf all creatures, the tortoise and the snake in particular must not be killed.\nShould one rashly take their lives, or even slay those possessed of spirit,\ntheir hidden essence shall surely bring harm to the slayer.”\nThus do the wise ever strive to protect them.\n\nLong ago, Liu Yanxiang’s father served as an aide to the prefect of Huzhou.\nOn his return from the silver mines, someone presented him with a great tortoise, saying:\n“Whoever obtains this tortoise shall live a thousand years.”\nThat very day, his father personally returned it to the place where it was found.\nAfter his father’s death, Yanxiang became a registrar in Fangzhou.\n\nSuddenly, a violent flood surged forth from the mountains, rising several feet above the flat ground. The entire household was seized with terror, not knowing where to flee. Just then, a great tortoise appeared, seemingly intent on leading the way. Following the tortoise, they passed through more than ten locations, each time finding shallower ground, and thus escaped the calamity of the flood.\n\nThat very night, Yanxiang dreamed of the great tortoise, which said: “Long ago in the silver mines, I once received the kindness of your late father, the Prefect’s aide, who saved and released me. Today, I have come to repay that debt.”\n\nWhen the Perfected Master Sun was in the world, he once traveled through the mountains on the Dao. He saw villagers striking a green snake and forcefully intervened to save it. A month later, as he passed by the same place again, he saw a young man galloping toward him on horseback, who invited him to return home. Upon arrival, it was a royal residence, and a figure in crimson robes emerged to express gratitude, saying: “Yesterday, my foolish son nearly came to harm, but thanks to your intervention, he was saved. Here, our blood kin are many, and all are deeply grateful. Thus, I have sent my eldest son to welcome you and convey our humble thanks.”\n\nThen, he was led into a deep palace, where a consort emerged, holding a young boy dressed in green, to bow and express gratitude. They repeatedly urged him to stay. For three days, he was offered exquisite delicacies, fine meals, silks, pearls, and jade—nothing was lacking. Yet the Master declined all gifts, accepting only the *Thirty Immortal Prescriptions of the Dragon Palace*, bestowed by the Celestial Emperor, which he brought back with him. The *Thousand Gold Remedies* is said to have drawn from these thirty prescriptions.\n\nIf this is so, can the killing of tortoises and the striking of snakes truly be justified?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe tortoise ranks among the Four Spirits,\nThe snake leads the hundred hibernating creatures.\nYet even Yuju’s net could not spare them from capture,\nAnd the essence of the White Emperor wept upon the path.\nWho would expect the ignorant to bring such misfortune upon themselves?\nIf one encounters a wise soul, they should hasten to relieve such distress.\n\nSuch sins as these are recorded by the Deities of Fate, who diminish one’s allotted lifespan in proportion to their severity. When the tally is exhausted, death follows; if the transgression exceeds the debt, the misfortune extends to one’s descendants.\n\nAs the saying goes: the offenses described above have each been expounded in detail in the preceding text, and so shall not be reiterated here. Instead, let us speak of the karmic causes and effects governing rebirth into the Seven Realms, that all may come to know them.\n\nWithin the cycle of the Seven Realms, none attain true purity, for all is but illusion. Even the habits of killing, stealing, and lust persist, following one’s inclinations. The sutra states: “In all the worlds, the succession of death and rebirth follows habitual tendencies; at death, it flows with transformation.”\n\nAt the moment of passing, before the warmth has fully departed, the entirety of one’s lifetime of good and evil deeds appears in an instant. Death reverses life’s course, and the two habits intersect. If pure thought prevails, one ascends and is surely born in the heavens. If the mind takes flight while still possessing blessings, wisdom, and pure vows, the heart naturally opens. One beholds the Buddhas of the ten directions and all the pure lands, and is reborn according to one’s wishes. With more thought than emotion, one rises lightly but not far—such are the flying immortals.\n\nThe mighty ghost kings, flying yakṣas, earth-walking rākṣasas, and those who roam the four heavens move without obstruction. Among them, those with virtuous vows and good hearts protect my Dharma, uphold the precepts, follow the precept-observers, guard the divine mantras, accompany the mantra-holders, or safeguard meditation and preserve the endurance of Dharma. These beings proceed directly to the seat of the Tathāgata. With thought and emotion in balance, they neither ascend nor fall, but are reborn among humans. Those with clear thoughts become wise; those with deep emotions grow dull. With more emotion than thought, one drifts into the realm of beasts—heavy as furred creatures, light as feathered flocks. With seven parts emotion and three parts thought, one descends even lower into the watery wheel.\n\nBorn in the realm of fire, one receives the fierce breath of fire, becoming a hungry ghost, constantly burned. Water harms them, and they have no food or drink, enduring for hundreds of thousands of kalpas with nine parts emotion and one part thought. Descending into the fiery wheel of the abyss, the body enters wind and fire, where the two elements clash. Those lightly burdened are born in the intermediate state; the heavily burdened fall into the realm without respite. These two hells are purely emotional—one sinks into the Avīci Hell. If the heart harbors slander of the Mahāyāna, violates the Buddha’s precepts, deceitfully expounds the Dharma, falsely covets offerings, or usurps reverence, committing the five heinous crimes or the ten evils, one is reborn in the Avīci Hells of the ten directions.\n\nThough the evil karma is self-inflicted, it also affects those sharing the same conditions, for the original ground is thus. The hells, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, gods, immortals, and asuras—all who delve into the Seven Realms—are benighted, bound to the conditioned phenomena of saṃsāra. Rebirth arises from delusion, and delusion follows karma. In the wondrous, radiant, and uncreated original mind, all is like flowers in the sky, fundamentally nonexistent—mere illusion without root or thread.\n\nThese beings, unaware of their original mind, endure this cycle of rebirth for countless kalpas without attaining true purity, all due to following the habits of killing, stealing, and lust.\n\nWhat are the Seven Realms?\n\n**First, the Heavenly Realm.**\nThe sutra states: “Worldly beings who do not seek permanence, unable to forsake the love of wives and concubines, yet do not stray in licentiousness, their minds clear and bright—at death, they dwell near the sun and moon. Such are called the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings. Those who have slight attachment to their wives, unable to fully savor the purity of their abodes, at death transcend the brightness of the sun and moon, residing atop the human realm. Such are called the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. Those who engage in desire briefly and depart without longing, active little and still much in the human world—at death, they dwell serenely in the void, beyond the reach of the sun and moon’s light. These beings possess their own radiance. Such are called the Suyāma Heaven. Those who are always still, yet when touched cannot refuse—at death, they ascend to the subtle, no longer touching the lower realms or the abodes of humans and gods. Such are called the Tuṣita Heaven. Those who, without desire, comply with others’ actions, finding the act as tasteless as chewing wax—at death, they are born in the realm of transformation. Such are called the Heaven of Joyous Transformation. Those without worldly minds, yet conforming to worldly deeds, clearly transcending in their conduct—at death, they fully surpass the realm of transformation. Such are the two kinds called the Heaven of Freely Enjoying Transformations by Others. These six heavens, though their forms transcend movement, their hearts and traces remain entangled. From here downward is called the Desire Realm. Even the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm and the four heavens of the Formless Realm—all these heavenly beings, as the Buddha expounded, fail to comprehend the wondrous, luminous mind of enlightenment. Delusion accumulates and arises, falsely creating the three realms, falsely following the Seven Realms in sinking and drowning. Each *pudgala* follows its kind.”\n\n**Second, the Immortal Realm.**\nThe sutra states: “There are also those who do not rely on true enlightenment, cultivating *samādhi* but separately nurturing deluded thoughts, fixing their forms through visualization, dwelling in mountains and forests where humans do not see. There are ten kinds of immortals: Those who persistently consume elixirs without rest, perfecting the Way of ingestion, are called Earth-Walking Immortals. Those who persistently consume herbs and plants without rest, perfecting the Way of medicine, are called Flying Immortals. Those who persistently refine metals and stones without rest, perfecting the Way of transformation, are called Wandering Immortals. Those who persistently regulate movement and stillness without rest, perfecting the essence of *qi*, are called Sky-Walking Immortals. Those who persistently refine bodily fluids without rest, perfecting the virtue of moisture, are called Heaven-Walking Immortals. Those who persistently refine essence and form without rest, perfecting the absorption of purity, are called Permeating Immortals. Those who persistently uphold mantras and prohibitions without rest, perfecting the arts of magic, are called Way-Walking Immortals. Those who persistently cultivate thought without rest, perfecting recollection, are called Radiant Immortals. Those who persistently advance in interaction without rest, perfecting resonance, are called Essence Immortals.”\n\nThose who persistently refine transformation without rest, perfecting awakening, are called Utmost-Walking Immortals. All these cultivate the heart among humanity, yet do not cultivate true awakening, and thus attain a separate principle of life, living for thousands or tens of thousands of years. They dwell in deep mountains or on great sea islands, cut off from the human realm. Yet this too is but the turning of the wheel—deluded thoughts flowing on, without the cultivation of samadhi. When their retribution is exhausted, they return again, scattering into the various destinies.\n\nThe third is the asura destiny. The sutras say: Within these three realms, there are four kinds of asuras. If, within the ghost destiny, they protect the Dharma with their powers and attain penetration into emptiness, these asuras are born from the *mao* direction and belong to the ghost destiny. If, within the heavens, their virtue declines and they fall, their dwelling is near the sun and moon—these asuras emerge from the womb and belong to the human destiny. There are asura kings who hold the world in their grasp, their power pervading without fear, able to contend with Brahma, Indra, and the Four Heavenly Kings for dominion—these asuras arise from transformation and belong to the heavenly destiny. There is also a lesser class of asuras who are born in the heart of the great sea, submerged in water with gaping mouths; by day they roam the empty sky, and by night they return to the water to rest—these asuras arise from damp qi and belong to the animal destiny.\n\nThe fourth is the human destiny. The sutras say: Those who are noble and exalted as humans, or become kings or elders, come from revering the Three Jewels. Those who are upright in appearance, with pure and radiant complexions, foremost in bearing, come from the practice of forbearance. Those who are diligent and untiring, delighting in merit and virtue, come from the practice of diligence. Those who are serene, with careful speech and conduct, come from the practice of meditation. Those who are wise and bright, comprehending profound Dharma, expounding sublime meanings, awakening the ignorant, and whose words are treasured as jewels by those who hear them, come from the cultivation of wisdom. Those with clear and resonant voices come from singing the praises of the Three Jewels. Those who are pure and free from illness come from the practice of compassion. Those who are fearful, with hoarse voices, come from hell. Those who are dull and lazy, gluttonous, inarticulate, timid, delighting in foolish company, and fond of darkness come from the animal destiny. Those who are unclean come from pigs. Those who are fierce and cruel come from vipers. Those lacking in aspiration come from dogs. Those who are stubborn and self-willed come from sheep. Those who delight in fine food and drink, recklessly take lives, and lack compassion come from jackals, wolves, foxes, and hawks. Those who are restless and intolerant come from macaques.\n\nFurthermore: Those who are tall and respectful come from respecting others. Those who are short and small come from disdaining others. Those who are ugly come from anger. Those who are ignorant at birth come from lack of study. Those who are dull-witted come from not teaching others. Those who are short-lived and sickly come from killing. Those who lack livelihood and suffer constant poverty come from theft. Those who are childless come from adultery. Those whose children are licentious come from defiling virgins. Those who are widowed, orphaned, or solitary come from mistreating children. Those who suffer hunger come from hoarding food. Those who are slaves or servants, burdened by debt and unable to repay, come from disrespecting the Three Treasures. Those who are ugly and repulsive come from obstructing the Buddha’s light. Those born as water buffaloes come from official cruelty and oppressing the common people. Those born as deer come from startling others. Those born among dragons come from delighting in mischief. Those whose bodies bear incurable sores come from flogging others. Those who bring joy to others come from delighting in others. Those who are disliked come from disliking others. Those who are imprisoned by officials, bound in cangues and fetters, come from confining living beings. Those with protruding lips come from enjoying fishing. Those born in the Land of Naked People come from disrespectfully entering Buddhist monasteries without clothing. Those born in the Land of Horse-Hoof People come from trampling Buddha-land with sandals. Those born in the Land of Pierced-Chests come from regretting acts of generosity and merit-making.\n\nIt is also said: Those of the owl kind repay their debts and regain human form, mingling with the dull-witted. Those of the fault kind mingle with the foolish, those of the fox kind with the mediocre, those of the venomous kind with the wolf-like, those of the parasitic kind with the insignificant, those of the gluttonous kind with the gentle, those of the servile kind with the laborious, those of the responsive kind with the cultured, those of the auspicious kind with the enlightened, and those of the compliant kind with the discerning. All these, having repaid their past debts and regained human form, remain from beginningless time in the deluded reckoning of karma, mutually arising and destroying. Without encountering the Tathagata or hearing the true Dharma, they turn endlessly in the dust and toil of samsara—such beings are called the pitiable.\n\nThe fifth is hell. The sutras say: These beings, deluded by their own karma, create the ten habitual causes and receive the six intersecting retributions. What are the ten causes? First, the habit of lust; second, the habit of greed; third, the habit of arrogance; fourth, the habit of anger; fifth, the habit of deceit; sixth, the habit of fraud; seventh, the habit of enmity; eighth, the habit of wrong views; ninth, the habit of oppression; and tenth, the habit of litigation. What are the six retributions? All beings create karma with the six senses, and the evil retributions they incur emerge from the six roots.\n\nFirst is the retribution of sight, which summons karmic consequences. When this visual karma intersects, at the approach of death, one first sees raging fires filling the ten directions. The deceased’s spirit, borne by smoke, falls and enters the Avici Hell.\n\nSecond is the retribution of hearing, which summons karmic consequences. When this auditory karma intersects, at the approach of death, one first sees waves surging and submerging heaven and earth. The deceased’s spirit, descending with the current, enters the Avici Hell.\n\nThird is the retribution of smell, which summons evil consequences. When this olfactory karma intersects, at the approach of death, one first sees poisonous qi filling the distance. The deceased’s spirit leaps from the ground and enters the Avici Hell.\n\nFourth is the retribution of taste, which summons evil consequences. When this gustatory karma intersects, at the approach of death, one first sees iron nets with raging, blazing flames covering the world. The deceased’s spirit plunges downward, ensnared in the net, head dangling upside down, and enters the Avici Hell.\n\nFifth is the retribution of touch, which summons evil consequences. When this tactile karma intersects, at the approach of death, one first sees great mountains closing in from all four sides, leaving no path of escape. The deceased’s spirit then sees a great iron city, with fire-serpents, fire-dogs, tigers, wolves, lions, ox-headed jailers, and horse-headed rakshasas, all wielding spears and lances, driving them through the city gates toward the Avici Hell.\n\nSixth is the retribution of thought, which summons evil consequences. When this mental karma intersects, at the approach of death, one first sees evil winds blowing apart the land. The deceased’s spirit is swept up into the sky, then whirled down by the wind, falling into the Avici Hell.\n\nWithin each of these six retributions, two further evil signs are revealed, making this the \"ten causes and six effects of hell.\" In general, all are the deluded fabrications of sentient beings. If sentient beings complete their evil karma in full, they enter the Avīci Hell, suffering boundless torment for boundless kalpas. Each of the six roots generates its own karma, and what they have done—combining both sense-objects and sense-roots—leads them into the eight Avici Hells. If the three karmas of body, speech, and mind commit killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct, they enter the eighteen hells. If the three karmas do not overlap but commit, for instance, one act of killing and one of stealing, they enter the thirty-six hells. If a single root, such as the eye, commits a single transgression, they enter the one hundred and eight hells. Thus, sentient beings, each acting and creating separately, enter corresponding realms in the world, their deluded thoughts arising—yet these are not originally existent.\n\nSixth is the realm of hungry ghosts. The sutras state: These sentient beings, without having broken the monastic precepts, violated the bodhisattva vows, or destroyed the Buddha’s nirvana, but through other miscellaneous karmas, burn for kalpas. After their sins are exhausted, they take the forms of ghosts. If their original transgression was greed for possessions, upon the exhaustion of their sin, they encounter objects and take form, becoming *guài* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for sensual pleasure, they encounter wind and take form, becoming *bá* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for delusion, they encounter animals and take form, becoming *mèi* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for hatred, they encounter insects and take form, becoming *chóngdú* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for attachment, they encounter decay and take form, becoming *lì* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for arrogance, they encounter qi and take form, becoming hungry ghosts. If their transgression was greed for deception, they encounter darkness and take form, becoming *yǎn* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for clarity, they encounter essence and take form, becoming *wǎngliǎng* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for achievement, they encounter light and take form, becoming servant ghosts. If their transgression was greed for factionalism, they encounter people and take form, becoming messenger ghosts. All these beings, having fallen purely through emotion, are scorched by karmic fire and emerge as ghosts. Among the realms of hungry ghosts, this is the most extreme suffering. Due to their greed, though they conceive desires, they ultimately obtain nothing. Due to their jealousy, when they see others sated, they themselves remain perpetually hungry. Due to their malice, their bodies emit fire, which burns them. Due to their arrogance, their merit is minimal, and even the smallest ghosts overpower them.\n\nFormerly, when the Buddha was in the country of Vaiśālī, he went out at dawn and eighty-four thousand hungry ghosts wailed to him, saying: \"In our past lives, though we saw the Buddha, we did not recognize him. Though we heard the Dharma, we did not acknowledge it. Though we saw the Sangha, we did not know them. We did not perform meritorious deeds, nor did we teach others to do so. Seeing others perform merit, we would mock them. Seeing others commit sins, we rejoiced in our hearts. Due to these most evil actions, we have fallen into this realm for seventy thousand years. Whenever we see even a small amount of water, it soon vanishes. When we see a large body of water, it is guarded by yakshas and rakshasas. Even when great rains fall, our bodies feel as though we stand on scorching sand. We beseech your compassion and salvation.\" The Buddha then taught them to offer water to the Buddha and the Sangha, and thus they were freed from suffering.\n\nWhen Ānanda was in the city of Kapilavastu, he saw a hungry ghost who called himself *Miànrán* and said to Ānanda: \"In three days, you will certainly die and fall into our realm.\" Ānanda asked: \"What can I do to avoid this?\" *Miànrán* replied: \"There is no way except to offer us food, allowing us to be sated and thus liberated, so that you too may be spared.\" Ānanda reported this to the Buddha, who said: \"If you wish to offer food, first place it in a clean vessel, recite my *dhāraṇī* mantra seven times over it, then take it outside, snap your fingers seven times, and offer it to the ghosts. They will be liberated, and you too will be spared, gaining longevity as well.\" The mantra was then spoken: *Namo savadhadhakatavaru kṛtī om samvara samvara hūṃ.* Ānanda believed and practiced accordingly, and indeed was spared.\n\nSeventh is the realm of animals. The sutras state: When the karma of ghosts is exhausted, both emotion and thought become empty. Then, in the world, they encounter those to whom they owe karmic debts, and as animal masters, they repay their past obligations. *Wùguài* ghosts, once their retribution for objects is exhausted, are born in the world mostly as owl-like creatures. *Fēngbá* ghosts, once their retribution for wind is exhausted, become omens and all manner of strange creatures. *Chùmèi* ghosts, once their retribution for animals is exhausted, become solitary creatures. *Chónggǔ* ghosts, once their retribution for insects is exhausted, become poisonous creatures. *Shuāilì* ghosts, once their retribution for decay is exhausted, become parasitic creatures. *Shòuqì* ghosts, once their retribution for qi is exhausted, become edible creatures. *Miányōu* ghosts, once their retribution for darkness is exhausted, become creatures used for clothing. *Héjīng* ghosts, once their retribution for harmony is exhausted, become responsive creatures. *Mínglíng* ghosts, once their retribution for clarity is exhausted, become auspicious creatures of all kinds.\n\nGhosts bound to humans, once their retribution for human death is exhausted, often become creatures of habit. All these are desiccated by the fires of karma, repaying their past debts. Though they become beasts, it is their own deluded karma that draws them. If one awakens to bodhi, these delusions are revealed as fundamentally nonexistent.\n\nIt is also said: from these beasts, past debts are repaid. If the repayer exceeds what is owed, these beings may return to human form, only to reclaim the excess. If they possess strength and virtue, they may remain in human form to repay what is due. Those without virtue revert to beasts, settling the remaining debt. Know that whether through money, goods, or labor, repayment continues until the debt is cleared. If, in the interim, one kills or consumes another, even across kalpas as countless as motes of dust, they devour and slay one another in an endless cycle—like a turning wheel, rising and falling without cease.\n\nHave you not heard of Dōudiào, who for his arrogance and love of insults died and took the form of a dog? Or of Li Liùláng, who for lending at usurious rates also died and became a dog?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe accumulation of unvirtuous deeds\nbrings calamity in excess.\n\nThe accumulation arises gradually, and the excess is not easily dispelled. Those who delight in oppression and cruelty bring annihilation upon their entire clan. Qin, having long indulged in tyranny, saw Ziying ride the plain carriage. Retribution and recompense stand in opposition—such proofs are not false.\n\n*Here ends Scroll Twenty-Nine of the* **Taishang Ganying Pian** *(The Supreme Scripture on Actions and Responses).*",

      "translated_text": "**Preface to the Memorial Presenting the *Taishang Ganying Pian***\n\nYour servant, in his humble words, reveres the profound and venerable Dao, deeply admiring the sagely maxims of the Most High. With the carving of the woodblocks now complete, this long-held wish of your servant is fortunately fulfilled. Presumptuously, I dare to present this before Your August Ears, humbly repaying a fraction of Your boundless grace.\n\nWith trepidation and awe, I bow my head again and again.\n\nI have observed that among the treasured scriptures of the sacred canon, there exists a great teaching of jade-like elegance—rooted in compassion to save all beings, it repeatedly instructs humanity with earnestness. It declares that the causes of good and evil responses arise like the pivot of a mechanism, while the principles of fortune and misfortune manifest more swiftly than shadow follows form. Its twelve hundred earnest words and countless ages of luminous admonitions require the elucidation of wise rulers to guide the multitude toward return and devotion.\n\nOur August Emperor, in serene governance and morning audience, has illuminated the classics with diligent study. Though his mastery is devoted to the Six Classics, his inquiry extends broadly to all texts. He seeks the subtle and profound, following in the footsteps of his sagely ancestors’ quests; his transformative influence flows with purity, surpassing even the standards of the Han emperors of old. In the leisure between state affairs, he delights in pondering the interplay of Heaven and humanity, intending to propagate and transmit this work for posterity. Thus, he has compiled and refined it with care. Its solemn admonitions, like eight characters of black pearls, crown the text; its sweet and measured praises, wielded by a master’s brush, distinguish it as a singular achievement. How radiant is the splendor of this treasury! How honored is the favor bestowed upon cap and robe!\n\nYour servant, insignificant and unrefined, is unworthy—how could I presume to serve in the bamboo palace or allow my name to sully the imperial court? Yet, having once been elevated within the teaching’s ranks, I now dare to presume upon Your Sagacious Decree. Commanded with the honor of receiving imperial gold, I was entrusted with overseeing the engraving of the plates. I vow to exhaust my meager strength in humble repayment of this private devotion.\n\nReflecting upon my late father, I have ever feared the neglect of this text; yet, by some twist of fate, the fire that spared it has only further illuminated the Dao. With the transcription and carving now complete, I reverently seal and present it.\n\nI humbly beseech Your Imperial Majesty to deign to glance upon it, then widely promulgate it to the four directions. May all the people turn toward goodness and joyfully follow its teachings, so that this book may serve as an aid to uphold the world—thus fulfilling the role of both sovereign and teacher.\n\nYour servant respectfully presents the printed edition of the *Taishang Ganying Pian*, inscribed with Your Majesty’s title, in eight volumes, accompanying this memorial.\n\nWith trepidation and awe, I bow my head again and again, and respectfully submit these words.\n\nOn a day in the eighth month of the sixth year of the Shaoding era,\nYour servant Hu Yingwei, Supervisor of the Teaching on the Right Street, and Attendant for Ritual Offerings at the Taiyi Palace, respectfully memorializes.\n\n**The *Taishang Ganying Pian*, Volume Two**\nTransmitted by Li Changling, with Eulogies by Zheng Qingzhi.",

      "translated_text": "Loyalty and Filial Piety.\nThe *Tradition* states: The Eastern Minister of Destiny declares: Some possess talents surpassing Xiao and Miao, their aspirations towering above the multitude, nurturing their vast and unyielding qi while scorning wealth and rank. Others attain the utmost integrity and incorruptibility, refusing food or clothing not rightfully theirs—neither ostentation nor the allure of ten thousand chariots can sway their steadfast virtue or tarnish their noble conduct. Still others inherit blessings from ancestors of merit, their legacy flowing to descendants, refined through generations until their lineage is transformed and reborn. All such individuals meet the criteria for transcendence and are destined to ascend among the ranks of immortals. Yet they must pass through many years before gradually advancing.\n\nAs for those of perfect loyalty and perfect filial piety, should they depart this world today, they shall be appointed as Earthly Governors by tomorrow, and from that office, they shall swiftly ascend to the celestial ranks. Generally speaking, loyalty is the cardinal virtue of a minister, just as filial piety is the fundamental duty of a child. If all ministers were disloyal, what could a ruler expect of them? If all children were unfilial, what could a father hope for from them? In such a world, the bonds of ruler and minister, father and child, would utterly collapse—humanity would differ little from beasts or barbarians.\n\nHow lamentable that they fail to recognize loyalty and filial piety as the very foundation of transcendence, the swiftest path to liberation from the mortal realm! Have you not heard the tales of Master Lü’s instruction or the covenant of Master Lan? Long ago, Master Lü served as Censor-in-Chief, his stern countenance and forthright speech shaking the court and the realm. One day, as he sat alone, a green-clad attendant appeared and presented him with an elixir, saying: “This is the Cooling Elixir. The August Emperor will soon journey south to the fiery lands, and He has charged you with rectifying the ranks of immortals there. As those regions are scorching, He first bestows this upon you.” Master Lü bowed twice and swallowed the pill, its coolness like ice and snow sliding down his throat.

      "translated_text": "At that time, Zhu Mingfu had just passed the imperial examination and, while by the Xiang River, encountered the Master. The Master rode a deer with jade-like antlers, flanked by young attendants in green, with hundreds of officials and soldiers clearing the way before and behind. Mingfu stepped forward and bowed, asking: \"Have you already attained immortality?\" The Master replied: \"I now accompany the August Emperor on His southern journey. With no time for leisurely discourse, I shall recite a poem:\n\n*By chance my merits were inscribed in jade towers high,*\n*While countless robed ones lie buried ‘neath the dust.*\n*Now following the Emperor as inspector of the ranks,*\n*Who else remains to stand guard at the Cypress Terrace?*\n\nWith these words, he vanished from sight.\n\nThe Lan family was rooted in filial piety and fraternal love, with over a hundred mouths to feed, yet all lived in harmony, never exchanging harsh words. One evening, a perfected being descended from the Dipper and declared: \"I am the Filial Piety King of the Northern Dipper. When filial devotion reaches Heaven, the sun and moon shine brighter; when it reaches Earth, grasses and trees flourish; when it reaches mankind, the kingly Way is fulfilled. Your filial piety has drawn my gaze—having met me, you are certain to attain the Dao.\" And so it came to pass.\n\nThus, utmost loyalty and filial devotion—how swiftly they hasten one’s transcendence of the mortal realm! Alas, if loyalty and filial piety yield such rewards, what fate awaits those who lack them?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWithout loyalty, there is no lord;\nWithout filial piety, there are no kin.\nAbandon these two, and one is but a beast, not human.\nZhuang Zhou roamed free, yet still honored duty;\nThe Śākya school embraced emptiness, yet diligently repaid kindness.\nBeneath Heaven and upon Earth, who can escape these bonds?\n*Fraternal love.*\n\n**Tradition states:** The *Analects* records: \"The noble person attends to the root; when the root is established, the Dao arises. Is filial piety not the very root of benevolence?\" The Envoys of the Controller of Destiny regard father and son, elder and younger brothers, and husband and wife as the Three Bonds. Root and bond—though the terms differ, their meaning is one. If one discards the root and abandons the bonds, how can human relations stand?\n\nIn general, those who practice these virtues in truth ensure harmony between high and low, unchanging and steadfast. But those who merely pay lip service invite regret and offense, leading inevitably to transgression.\n\nLong ago, Yao Qiyun’s family was not wealthy, relying solely on farming and sericulture. When he was three, his father, having no son, took his elder brother’s place in distant garrison duty and died at the frontier. After his father’s death, Qiyun retrieved his spirit for burial, built a hut by the grave, and mourned for the rest of his life. The county magistrate, Su Che, donated his salary to buy land, opened paths, and erected a stele to commemorate the deed. The prefect, Hun Jian, reported the matter to the throne. An imperial edict praised and rewarded him, honoring his gate, naming his village \"Filial Piety,\" its altar \"Loyalty and Righteousness,\" and its lane \"Love and Respect.\" From Qiyun’s time onward, for fifteen generations, hundreds lived together for over three hundred years, never uttering a discordant word. Even through the upheavals of the Five Dynasties, descendants guarded the ancestral tombs, never scattering. There was also Zhang Cheng, a farmer whose family lived together for generations, numbering over a hundred and seventy. Within and without, all lived in harmony, never exchanging harsh words. Clothing and the like had no fixed owners. Each morning, the family elder sat in the hall while descendants lined up below, receiving their duties in turn, all diligent and reverent. From his ancestor Guan to Cheng, six generations lived together for nearly two hundred years, ever constant. Alas! These two families were truly what is meant by \"practicing in truth.\"",

      "translated_text": "Now, in Huishu, I encountered Master Lü of Yingyang, whose heart and Dao were profoundly aligned, his mind serene and unclouded. When he served as lecturer at Chongzheng Hall, he daily expounded the teachings of rectifying the heart and cultivating the self, exhorting and guiding the sovereign. He often declared: “If one’s self is cultivated and heart upright, no other arts are needed, and the realm will naturally transform.” Thus, wherever he resided, the restless were transformed, and those who heard his influence, though shallow, became steadfast.\n\nWhen Hu Gongyuan served as professor in the two prefectures of Su and Hu, each time he explained the classics and reached a crucial principle, he earnestly urged his students to first govern themselves before governing others. “Then, gentlemen,” he would ask, “how do you rectify yourselves? By this, who would not be transformed?”\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen the standard is upright, its shadow is straight;\nwhen the source is pure, its streams run clear.\nTo bend oneself while straightening others—\nthere is no such principle in all the world.\nWhat art do sages and worthies possess?\nThey simply apply to others what they first apply to themselves.\nTo punish others for one’s own flaws—\neven an army would gnash its teeth in scorn.\n\n*The Great Learning* teaches: cultivate the self, order the household, govern the state.\n**Pity the orphan.**\nAs the *Record* says: “The orphan is one who has not yet achieved maturity when parents pass early. Some lose their mother while the father remarries, or lose their father while the mother takes another husband. Worst of all are those who lose both parents, left alone and exposed—how unbearable their plight! Though a royal decree commands care, with fosterers providing food, clothing, and shelter, even the most compassionate guardian cannot match the tender love of true parents. How can one not pity them?”\n\nYet the world sees only the lowly status of orphans and scorns them, unaware that some, though orphaned, grow into greatness. Of old, Zhang Denggong Shixun lost both parents in infancy. As he grew, he endured poverty, studying tirelessly without respite, and ultimately passed the imperial examinations, rising to the rank of grand councilor, renowned for his virtue. Was this not an orphan of the poorest means who forged his own path and became a vessel of greatness?\n\nLü Zhongcheng lost his father in childhood, yet roused himself to study, refusing frivolous friendships. Few in Luoyang knew him. Only after passing the examinations did people learn he was the grandson of Lü Zhengdui, and he later held high office, famed for his integrity. Was this not an orphan of noble birth who forged his own path and became a vessel of greatness?\n\nIf so, how can orphans be scorned? Though this section is titled “Pity the Orphan,” I have not merely written of pity but recorded these examples to show that those unfortunate enough to be orphaned may take them as models and strive for self-improvement.\n\nThe foregoing speaks of pitying orphans, yet the elders of old regarded such conduct as ordinary, never deeming it extraordinary. When Scholar Cha of the Dragon Diagram Bureau was impoverished, he gathered and supported the lonely and destitute among his kin, spending all his salary and stipends as soon as he received them. In his dealings with others, he was deeply sincere, and toward the abandoned and exposed, he showed even greater kindness. Once, a colleague’s daughter, reduced to servitude by poverty...",

Gui prostrated himself in tears and said, “Though I am dead, my eldest son has inherited my work, and my family of ten need no longer fear starvation. I am deeply indebted to your kindness.” With that, he vanished.\n\nAlas, such manifest events may be set aside for now. Yet I observe that widows, though standing alone among men, often resolve with a will far surpassing others—this cannot go unrecorded.\n\nCounselor Zhao Gai was orphaned at seven. His mother, steadfast in her devotion, raised him with rigorous instruction, and he eventually ranked third in the imperial examination of the fifth year of Tiansheng. When the court later granted the privilege of official appointment to meritorious families, Gai requested that the honor be bestowed upon his mother as a commandery grand lady. The prime minister said, “As a scholar-official, your own rank is not far off.” Gai replied, “My mother is eighty-two, and her days are uncertain. I wish to see her honored in her lifetime.” His request was granted.\n\nPrefect Li Jun was orphaned at three. His mother, Lady Qin, was comely. When suitors urged her to remarry, she rebuked them angrily: “The bond of husband and wife is ordained by heaven, and life and death are decreed by fate. I would sooner starve than remarry.” She devoted herself to Jun’s education, and he eventually passed the examinations and rose to the rank of military commissioner of Yaozhou.\n\nCan the widowed be taken lightly? I record these accounts beneath my reflections on aiding widows precisely to show all widows the path to emulate.\n\nAlas! For those who uphold such principles, heaven’s reward is certain, for they honor the weight of human bonds—how could their children’s success be theirs alone?\n\n**In Praise:**\nWidows who hold fast to virtue\nAre revered by the wise and worthy.",

      "translated_text": "The cultivation of the Three Elders is learned and nurtured; rites honor those of advanced years. This is as close as kinship, the foremost duty of family and state. Heaven grants them longevity, allowing their crowns to flourish. Those who fail to revere them profane Heaven itself. How much more should those of venerable virtue be accorded respect? Surely none dare neglect their due rites.\n\n**Cherishing the Young.**\nThe *Traditions* record Confucius’s words: *“The young should be cherished.”* Mencius likewise said: *“Cherish your own young, and extend that care to the young of others.”* For the young are but children, their understanding yet unformed. Those who are elder must naturally show them compassion and nurture them. To treat them with cruelty is no human way. Thus, parents with young children must exhaust their loving diligence; elder brothers with younger siblings must extend their fraternal affection. Even toward the young of others, one should extend the same heart of kindness, regarding them equally, without distinction of self and other. To love only one’s own children and kin while neglecting others’ is no true fulfillment of the Way of cherishing the young.\n\nMoreover, the young hold lowly station and feeble strength—lowliness invites contempt, weakness invites oppression. Without a heart of compassion, elders may exploit their position to indulge their whims. The young, lacking eloquence to discern right from wrong or strength to contest victory, suffer as the lame endure the rod, unable to flee; as the mute endure slander, unable to defend themselves. Who could fully recount their hardships? How grievous is the thinness of custom!\n\nWomen’s nature often inclines toward jealousy and harshness. When a mother’s virtue is uneven, her love for her children becomes partial. She cherishes her own offspring but treats the children of concubines with coldness. Stepmothers, even more so, often neglect the children of their predecessors. As with Min Ziqian’s mother, who in winter clad her own son in silk floss but dressed Ziqian in reed catkins, then sent him to drive the carriage—such was her cruelty. If even Ziqian’s mother acted thus, what can be said of others? Countless orphaned and young stepchildren suffer cruel fates.\n\nAmong common folk, when disputes over property arise, elders and elder siblings—even those who have married into the family—may act without kindness or righteousness, oppressing their juniors. They craft false petitions, forge contracts, instruct brokers to bear false witness, and bribe clerks to twist the law, leaving the young helpless and stifled, with no recourse for grievance. Worse still, some resort to dark schemes and treachery, even harming their lives. Alas! How can one bear to speak of it?\n\nIn former times, the Li Zhiben household numbered over a hundred descendants, old and young living in harmony. The Yang brothers, orphaned and alone, relied upon one another. When the ancients sought to relieve famine, they made the care of orphans and the young their first priority. Such conduct truly fulfills the Way of cherishing the young.\n\n**In praise I say:**\nYao cherished the young child;\nLaozi longed for infancy.\nConfucius’s aspiration:\n*“The young should be cherished.”*\nIn their earliest years,\ntheir virtue remains pure, undiluted.\nEasily oppressed,\nthey must be protected and upheld.\nThus, for orphans and the young,\nbenevolence should come first.\n\n*Here ends Scroll Two of the* Taishang Ganying Pian.\n*Scroll Three of the* Taishang Ganying Pian *begins.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Transmission of Li Changling**\n*With a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi*\n\nEven insects and plants must not be harmed.\n\nAs the transmission states: According to the scriptures, all sentient beings possess within their single bodies the full array of forms and substances, taking shape as they are created. Ignorance gives rise to egg-born life; the womb of afflictions envelops the womb-born; the moisture of craving soaks the moisture-born; and sudden surges of vexation produce the transformation-born. Among these four modes of birth, humanity further distinguishes twelve classes of beings. Within each of these twelve classes, there are in turn eighty-four thousand distinct kinds. Taken together, the twelve classes thus comprise one million and eighty thousand varieties. How vast, then, is the diversity of sentient life!\n\nYet when we observe our daily conduct, we see that the eye, upon beholding rare treasures, immediately gives rise to thoughts of greed; the tongue, upon tasting rich and savory flavors, immediately gives rise to thoughts of killing; and the mind, upon grasping at splendor, immediately gives rise to thoughts of desire. Not only do the eye, tongue, and mind act thus—so too do the ear, nose, and body. Such deluded thoughts, such inverted perceptions, arise without cease. Even at the moment of death, when the eyes close, all remains in chaos, and one cannot take control. On the thirtieth day of the twelfth month, when feet scurry and hands flail, can one truly be master of oneself? It is from this that the Buddha’s twelve classes of beings and one million eighty thousand varieties arise.\n\nIn former times, when the Buddha wandered and taught among the kingdoms, there was one land that resisted his transformation. He sent Maudgalyāyana, and the entire nation came before him. The assembly asked the Buddha why. The Buddha replied: “The people of this land were once a swarm of bees. Maudgalyāyana was then a woodcutter who, while gathering firewood, struck a branch and disturbed the hive. The bees swarmed in fury, seeking to sting him. Maudgalyāyana said to them: ‘You all possess the Buddha-nature, yet through evil karma you have drifted into this state. Even now, you harbor petty resentment and wish to vent your venom. May I swiftly attain enlightenment and first deliver you.’ At that moment, the bees seemed to awaken and took his words to heart. Thus, when they now appear before us, they all follow in submission.”\n\nElsewhere, by the side of the Karanda Pond in Jambudvīpa, he expounded the Dharma for the assembly.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, how does the Most High show compassion for the wicked?\n\nIn former times, the residents of Chaozhou, beyond their daily sustenance, vied in consuming aquatic creatures. They knew not that on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month each year, the Jade Emperor presents his report to the Three Pure Ones, traverses the heavens, descends to observe the world, and determines the judgment of sins and blessings. On that day, the Envoys of the Nine Heavens, the sun, moon, and stars, the spirits of heaven and earth, the sacred mountains and rivers, and the deities of altars and temples all submit their detailed accounts.\n\nOne day, the Jade Emperor summoned the Central Heaven’s North Pole Purple Tenuity Great Emperor and asked: “In the southern continent of Jambudvīpa, within the astrological division of Wu, lies the land called Chaozhou. What is the state of its goodness and evil?”\n\nThe North Pole Emperor replied: “The inhabitants of this region are truly wicked, slaughtering living beings without restraint. I fear that as time accumulates, their vengeful spirits will grow ever more entangled. Unless the land is utterly submerged to form a great lake, it will not suffice to cleanse the years of cruel killings and the noxious, defiling qi of their savagery.”\n\nThe Jade Emperor said, “Let it be so.”\n\nAfter the North Pole Emperor withdrew, he summoned Zhenwu and said: “As the patroller of the Three Realms, charged with examining good and evil, how could you not know of the wickedness of Chaozhou’s people? Their noxious, defiling qi has ascended to disrupt the Jade Emperor’s celestial procession, causing the sun and moon to lose their light and the stars to fall from their courses. The Jade Emperor has decreed that the entire city be sunk and destroyed. This task falls to you—proceed swiftly.”\n\nZhenwu replied: “A land spanning a thousand *li* is not uniformly corrupt. If all are sunk without distinction, I fear many will suffer unjustly. Allow me to descend and further inquire of the local earth deities before reporting back.”\n\nThe North Pole Emperor said: “The deities of that region have already received their edicts and been relocated elsewhere.”\n\nZhenwu then sighed deeply and said: “Alas! Even a single creature’s life remains bound in the cycle of rebirth, not easily liberated. How much more so when a thousand *li* become a watery expanse, where beings turn upon one another in harm, their great grievances ever more entangled—how can they be saved?”\n\nHe again pleaded earnestly, dispatching his subordinate Celestial Stem generals to conduct another investigation. Thereupon, one of the generals transformed into a giant soft-shelled turtle, floating upon the Han River. First, the local officials and their attendants carved its flesh for consumption, followed by the common people, who did likewise.\n\nThe Celestial Stem general returned and reported. Zhenwu once more requested to descend himself. This time, he transformed into a wandering Daoist, begging for water in the streets. For seven days, every household’s water reeked of filth. Only in the last home, belonging to an old woman called Jiao, was the water pure and clean.\n\nThe Perfected Lord questioned her, and the old woman replied: “Our family of three has long detested the stench of flesh. We eat only vegetables.”\n\nThe Perfected Lord said: “I am no mortal. This region will soon be submerged to form a great lake. Though I wished to save it, it is no longer possible. You must flee to another place at once.”\n\nBefore long, a torrential rain indeed fell, and a great flood surged forth. In an instant, the thousand-*li* expanse of the region became towering waves, vast and boundless.\n\nOn that day, the Perfected Lord descended again and said to Jiao: “You shall preside over this lake.” Several days later, the old woman died, followed by her son and daughter-in-law. They thus became spirits, and the lake was named *Jiao* after her surname.\n\nThus, how does the Heavenly Perfected One show compassion for the wicked? The scripture says: “Do not harbor resentment toward the stubborn”—this is its meaning.",

      "translated_text": "Then how do the Highest Perfected Ones uphold and sustain goodness? Alas! The Highest Perfected and the Buddhas, having long abided in liberation, still take such delight in the goodness of others. How much more should humans, who remain in the sea of suffering, do likewise? In the world, such people are not absent. Hu Wending, upon seeing Li Wenjing—serene and free from desire, and further enriched by learning—exclaimed: “This man stands at the eight- or nine-tenths mark of attainment.” When he beheld Wang Suogong, steadfast and unshaken, coupled with earnest study, he again declared: “This man, too, stands at the eight- or nine-tenths mark.” Shao Kangjie, observing Sima Wengong’s loyalty, kindness, brotherly respect, reverence, frugality, and integrity, rejoiced and said: “This man walks with both feet firmly on the ground—an eight- or nine-tenths man indeed.” When he saw Han Qinzhong argue matters before his superiors without evasion, he remarked: “This man is utterly pure yet unostentatious, utterly upright yet unprovocative, utterly courageous yet gentle—truly rare and admirable.” Likewise, Du Zhengxian, upon hearing of another’s goodness, rejoiced as if it were his own. Liu Jixian, upon hearing of another’s goodness, extolled it without end. Wen Lugong, upon seeing another’s goodness, feared he could not match it. Han Zhongxian, upon hearing of even a small act of goodness, would say: “This is something I have not yet achieved.” Could such men as these, unless they truly delighted in goodness—reaching that state where delight precludes all aversion—have acted thus?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nGoodness is innate in all,\nFlowing from heaven’s nature.\nWhy then envy and malice,\nThe triumph of self-interest?\nAggression, contention, resentment, desire—\nThese afflict one another.\nOnly when the self is forgotten\nDoes this heart cease to vie.\nSeeing another’s goodness,\nLike the moon reflected in a mirror.\nAiding another in distress—\n\nAs the *Yunji Qiqian* states: “The Venerable Nuojuluo said: ‘One of great wisdom is like a steadfast lamp within a basket. One of great merit and virtue is like a bubble floating upon the sea. One of great skillful means is like rain falling through empty space.’ Now, when one aids another in distress with the strength to do so, this is precisely what is meant by great skillful means. Like rain that nourishes all, its benefit to living beings is beyond words.”\n\nDistress takes many forms. In illness, the urgent need is for medicine. In death and mourning, it is for funeral arrangements. In hunger and want, it is for food and drink. In marriage, it is for dowries and provisions. Beyond these, there are countless other urgencies that cannot all be enumerated. Yet if one responds to each according to its urgency, aiding with skillful means, this is truly to relieve another’s distress.\n\nLong ago, Xu Shuwei, in his youth, prayed for success in the imperial examinations. One night, he dreamed a spirit told him: “If you wish to pass, you must rely on hidden virtue.” Xu reflected that, being poor and without means, only medicine could serve this purpose. Thus, he devoted himself to medical texts, eventually mastering them. Regardless of rank, he hastened to aid all who called. As the number of lives he saved grew, so too did his renown. Later, the spirit appeared to him again in a dream and bestowed a poem:\n*“Medicine bears hidden merit,\nIn the hall of Chen and Lou.\nAt the gaming table, ‘Six!’ is called,\nYet ‘Five!’ is what they count.”*\nThat year, he placed sixth in the imperial examinations. The candidate above him was named Chen Zuyan, and the one below, Lou Cai. When official appointments were later adjusted, he was promoted to the fifth rank, returning home as a commissioned official—every word of the poem proved true. This was one who aided others in their distress.\n\nFan Wenzheng, while governing Binzhou, once took leisure to ascend a tower with wine and his subordinates for a view. As they raised their first cups, he suddenly saw several mourners in hempen garments moving about, preparing funeral rites. He sent someone to inquire and learned that a low-ranking official, residing away from home, had just died, leaving no provisions for his burial. Fan immediately canceled the feast and generously provided for the deceased. This was one who aided another in the distress of death and mourning.\n\nFan Zhongxuan, governing Qingzhou during a great famine, saw corpses of the starved lining the roads, yet had no grain to distribute. He requested the release of stored grain from the Ever-Normal Granary, but the local officials refused, saying: “A memorial must first be submitted.” Fan replied: “A person cannot survive seven days without food. If we wait for approval, how can we act in time?” That very day, he released the grain, adding: “Let none of you share responsibility—I shall bear it alone.” This was one who aided others in the distress of hunger and want.\n\nZha Dao, before passing the examinations, once traveled through the Xiang and Han regions, borrowing money from others to the sum of one hundred thousand coins. On the road, he encountered an old friend urgently preparing for his daughter’s marriage but lacking funds. Without hesitation, Zha emptied his purse and gave it all, showing no reluctance. This was one who aided another in the distress of marriage.\n\nWith such devotion of heart, how could they not be rewarded in the end? Xu Shuwei ultimately passed the examinations; Fan Wenzheng rose to the rank of vice-minister; Fan Zhongxuan became chancellor; and Zha Dao attained the position of attendant-in-ordinary. Were these not their rewards?\n\nIn general, when one dwells in the world, one ought to act thus in the face of another’s distress.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe noble one aids in urgency,\nNot for private gain.\nAs one trapped in a well,\nIf you withhold the rope,\nIt is as if you killed them.\nTo bow and yield while another drowns—\nIs this not self-deception?\nJudging others by oneself,\nTheir urgency is plain.\nRescuing another in peril—\n\nAs the *Yunji Qiqian* states: “One who saves a life extends their own years by twelve. If the one saved is a good person, the extension doubles.” Then how can one fail to rescue another in peril? Peril here means the very threshold of life and death.\n\nWhen Wang Jun rebelled in Shu, the court, enraged by Shu’s repeated uprisings, ordered Lei Youzhong to lead troops to suppress it, intending to massacre the city. At the time, the Shu scholars Fan Can, known for his integrity; Fan Xun, devoted to study; and the eminent monk Wenjian, all respected figures in Shu, joined together to secretly welcome the imperial army. Kneeling, they pleaded: “The people of Shu are weak. Those in the city are all common folk, and those who joined the rebellion did so only out of fear. They are not truly guilty.”",

      "translated_text": "When the city was about to fall, they entreated: “We beg that slaughter not be wantonly inflicted; rooting out the ringleaders will suffice.” These three were all men of towering stature, and their arguments, delivered with fervor, were made selflessly for the sake of others, springing from utmost sincerity. Lei Youzhong was moved by their words and replied: “Had I not heard the words of such elders, the massacre of the city would have been certain.” Thus, the entire populace of the city was spared from death—through the efforts of Fan and Wenjian.\n\nZhang Xun, the great-grandfather of Zhang Dexiang, the Duke of Xuān, once served the Min kingdom as prefect of Jianzhou. His wife, Lady Lian, was a woman of wisdom and discernment. Zhang Xun once dispatched two generals on a military campaign; when they failed to return on time, he intended to execute them. Lady Lian interceded, and the two generals were spared. Later, they served as generals under the Southern Tang and led the attack to retake Jianzhou. By then, Zhang Xun had already passed away. Lady Lian still resided in Jianzhou, and the two generals sent envoys bearing generous gifts of gold and silk, along with a white banner, which they presented to her, saying: “When we sack the city, plant this banner at your gate, and we will command our soldiers not to violate your household.” Lady Lian returned their gold, silk, and banner, refusing them, and said: “I am grateful for your remembrance of past kindness and your wish to spare this city. If you insist on slaughter, my family will perish alongside the rest—I do not wish to survive alone.” Moved by her words, the two generals abandoned their plan to massacre the city—through the efforts of Lady Lian.\n\nThe Fan family has since become a prominent clan in Shu, with descendants flourishing and officials numbering in the hundreds. The Zhang family, too, has grown into a great lineage in Jian, with successive generations attaining high ministerial ranks—all descendants of Lady Lian.\n\nAlas! The lives these two families saved were so numerous, and the recompense bestowed by Heaven was equally abundant. Such cases are indeed rare in the world. Yet in all matters of peril—whether from flood and fire, bandits and thieves, famine and cold, illness and plague, judicial coercion, or distress in travel—if one maintains such a heart of compassion, though the circumstances may differ, the act of rescuing those in danger remains the same.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen a child falls into a well,\nAll who witness it feel alarm.\nWhen a vessel is about to shatter,\nOnlookers reach out to catch it.\nTurning peril into safety,\nReviving the crippled to walk—\nOnce the other’s distress is averted,\nMy joy is profound.\nWith a heart of benevolence,\nRegret and blame are no more.\n\n*This concludes Chapter Three of the* Taishang Ganying Pian. *Chapter Four of the* Taishang Ganying Pian *begins.*",

      "translated_text": "**The Biography of Li Changling**\n\n**Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi:**\nTo see another’s gain as one’s own gain,\nTo see another’s loss as one’s own loss.\n\nThe *Biography* states: Wenju asked Vimalakīrti at the bodhimanda, “What is the bodhimanda?”\nVimalakīrti replied, “An even mind is the bodhimanda.”\n\nZhaozhou asked Nanquan, “What is the Dao?”\nNanquan replied, “An even mind is the Dao.”\n\nThus, is an even mind the Dao, or is it the bodhimanda?\nOuyang Wenzhong cultivated goodwill and delighted in virtue, yet he often found maintaining an even mind difficult.\nPrefect Peng Siyong of Peng studied tirelessly and would tell others, “I do not study for others; since youth, I have studied only to even my mind.”\nIs an even mind truly so difficult? Must one learn it for oneself?\n\nGenerally, the mind as a thing has no inherent substance, yet it is not absent when put to use. If one wishes to even the mind, it lies within oneself—what difficulty could there be? Those among the elders who found it difficult did so lamenting the lack of others to guide them, offering instruction to later learners.\n\nThose in the world who cannot regard another’s gains and losses as their own surely do not understand this. Precisely because they do not understand, the distinction between self and others always prevails, and transgressions accumulate upon them like water flowing to the sea, growing deeper and broader day by day. How then could they be fit to receive the teachings of the bodhimanda or the Dao?\n\nIn ancient times, Xue Yuan served as minister to the state of Yan. He could not maintain an even mind: when he saw others gain, he felt as though he had lost; when he saw others lose, he felt as though he had gained. He never recommended a single scholar or promoted a single worthy. If there was anything praiseworthy, he envied it like an enemy, suppressing it to prevent advancement. In his later years, one son died in prison, and the rest were afflicted with blindness, deafness, muteness, hunchbackedness, madness, or idiocy.\n\nAt that time, Gongming Zigao saw him and took pity, rebuking him: “All this stems from your misguided thoughts and actions. Your crimes warrant the extermination of your entire family. Though your sons suffer thus, it is not yet enough to exhaust your transgressions.” Terrified, Xue Yuan earnestly begged for salvation. Zigao then transmitted to him the *Central Admonitions* of Master Red Pine. Yuan vowed to reform and practiced diligently, barely preserving one son.\n\nWhat, then, is this *Central Admonition*? I have humbly reflected upon the *Book of Songs*, and it differs not at all from this text. In essence, both point out the errors in how people employ their minds. Their power to avert misfortune is most potent.\n\nXue Yuan reverently received the *Central Admonition* and thus escaped the extermination of his family. Zhou Chi propagated this text and thereby avoided starvation—is this not proof of its power?\n\nAlas! All things in the world turn to emptiness in an instant; only evil karma remains a lasting burden upon the self. The purpose of annotating this book is precisely to elucidate this truth. Those who know of this book cannot but seek to read it; having read it, they cannot but put it into practice. If one truly acts thus, in the future, when facing the path of life and death, one will receive great power.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThough a hundred chapters fill this book,\nMu’s oath concludes it best.\nWhen others rise, regard it as your own;\nIf the people stray from the mean, blame has not yet departed.\nThe lord of *Hong Fan* grants blessings equally—\nNot for others’ sake, but for one’s own good.\nDo not expose the faults of others.",

      "translated_text": "The Tradition states: Ma Fubo admonished his descendants, saying, \"When you hear of another’s faults, it should be as if you heard the names of your parents—your ears may hear them, but your mouth must not speak of them.\" This fully embodies the teaching of the Highest Sages: \"Do not expose the faults of others.\" As for Master Guishan, he further refined this saying: \"Not only must the mouth not speak of them, the ears must not even hear of them.\" This surpasses Ma Fubo’s teaching, ascending to a yet higher realm.\n\nGenerally, those entangled in worldly toil cannot be without faults. Yet their faults are their own—what concern are they to me? For me, it suffices to remain in a state of not hearing, not knowing; thus, their faults will never be exposed through me. If, however, one utters even a single word to expose them, those faults will inevitably spread. Reputation will diminish from that moment, and one’s long-held integrity will collapse. If one traces the cause of this, who shall bear the blame? Know this: a noble person does not engage in exposing others’ faults, while the petty do so without scruple.\n\nIn ancient times, among the people of Guicheng, there was a man named Zhu Qisheng. He was narrow-minded and shallow, delighting in exposing others’ faults. If someone had a physical imperfection, he mocked them; if they were beautiful, he slandered them with envy; if they were foolish, he belittled them; if they were wise, he critiqued and ranked them; if they were poor, he despised them; if they were wealthy, he defamed them. With officials, he exposed their hidden deceit; with scholars and friends, he revealed their private affairs. If anyone’s lineage, talent, or reputation surpassed his own, leaving no room for criticism, he would cunningly seek out their flaws, saying: \"Their grandfather was a commoner,\" \"Their father was base,\" \"Their mother’s family were merchants,\" \"Their wife’s family were brokers,\" \"Their brother is unprincipled,\" \"Their son is worthless.\" Even the slightest fault would be exaggerated and embellished to magnify their shortcomings. No matter how trivial the matter, he acted thus—turning nothing into something, one into a hundred, suspicion into certainty, coincidence into deliberate offense, necessity into willful misconduct, and error into malice. If he judged someone gullible, he would confront them to their face, humiliate them before others, and slander them excessively. He treated strangers this way, and his own kin no differently. All his acquaintances fell under his censure. In extreme cases, he called his parents obstinate and unruly, his brothers like Guan and Cai. He would incite others to litigation, then mediate the dispute himself; urge others to curse their horses, then testify against them. Over time, such habits became second nature, and he saw no wrong in them.",

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, Li Bi was exceptionally intelligent. At the age of seven, he was already skilled in composition. Once, he wrote a *Ballad of Endless Singing*, which went:\n\n\"Heaven covers me, earth bears me,\nHeaven and earth gave me life—was it with intent or none?\nElse I’d fast and ascend the celestial thoroughfare,\nElse I’d jingle my jade pendants and roam the imperial capital.\nHow could I fail to rise, fail to depart,\nWasting my towering stature as a true man?\nO true man, ah, true man,\nMy lifelong aspirations brim with grand designs.\nI beg you to survey the affairs of a hundred years—\nOnce my work is done, I’ll take a small boat and drift upon the five lakes.\"\n\nWhen the song was finished, none failed to praise it. Only Zhang Jiuling sternly warned him: *\"To conceal one’s talents within is what the ancients valued. Now that you’ve gained fame so early, you will surely face setbacks. You must veil your light and nurture your character—only then may you perfect your virtue. How much more so for a child? If you compose poetry, simply admire the scenery and sing of past and present; never exalt yourself, for that is the wiser course.\"* Li Bi seemed to awaken. He wept and thanked Zhang repeatedly, and from then on never again displayed his talents. Had he not ceased, how could he have perfected his virtue and become a renowned minister of his age?\n\nOne must know: if a person has strengths, they must never flaunt them.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Three Powers stand as one: Heaven, Earth, and Man.\nThe warp and weft of the world rest upon a single person.\nFrom worthy to sage, from sage to spirit—\nYet in an instant, if one borrows without renewal, their virtue does not grow.\nYan Yuan appeared dull, yet his example is worthy of inscription on one’s sash.\nTo suppress evil and exalt goodness—\n\nThe *Commentary* states: *\"To suppress evil and exalt goodness is called a gentleman in the *Book of Changes*, and a good person in the *Book of Songs*.\"*\nThe *Changes* says: *\"Fire above heaven—Great Possession. The image of greatness and inclusiveness. The gentleman suppresses evil and exalts goodness, aligning with Heaven’s blessed mandate.\"*\nThus, to suppress evil and exalt goodness is to follow Heaven’s virtue and fulfill the mandate of all things. Is Heaven’s blessed mandate truly found in this?\n\nGenerally, unless one is a Yao or Shun, how can every deed be perfectly good? What is not good is called evil. If I can suppress it, preventing one from abandoning themselves, and instead encourage them to turn toward goodness—who does not value goodness? In every word and deed, if there is anything worthy, it is called good. If I can exalt it, making it known to all so that people strive to emulate it—is this not Heaven’s blessed mandate?\n\nHeaven’s blessed mandate is thus;\nMy treatment of others is thus.\nIs this not aligning with Heaven’s blessed mandate?\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: *\"Shun—was he not greatly wise? He concealed others’ faults and exalted their goodness.\"* If even Shun acted thus, how much more should others?\n\nTherefore, Zhao Kangjing (Zhao Pu) made it his duty to conceal faults and exalt goodness. Shao Kangjie (Shao Yong) delighted in speaking of others’ virtues and never mentioned their vices. Both grasped the principle of suppressing evil and exalting goodness.\n\nAlas, how few understand this—yet the making or breaking of a person often lies in a single word. Once spoken, how can one not be cautious?\n\nWhen Kou Laigong (Kou Zhun) was in office, he built a mountain pavilion for his birthday, which was reported by the supervising officials. The emperor was furious, his imperial voice severe, and he said to Wang Wenzheng (Wang Dan): *\"Kou Zhun imitates me in every matter—why?\"* Wang replied: *\"Kou Zhun is truly capable, but he is simple-minded.\"* The emperor said: *\"Only simple-minded?\"* And so he did not pursue the matter further. Had it not been for Wang’s single remark, how could the emperor’s anger over the mountain pavilion have dissipated so quickly? How could the praise of Kou’s ability have reached the throne?\n\nWhen Wang Wenkang (Wang Zeng) governed Shu, he sentenced all thieves, regardless of the severity of their crimes, to death. Some criticized his excessive harshness. Later, when Liu Ye was summoned back, the emperor asked: *\"Between Ling Ce and Wang Zeng, who governed Shu better?\"* Liu said: *\"Ling Ce served during years of abundance, so he could govern with leniency. Wang Zeng faced years of scarcity, fearing the people would turn to banditry, so he had to enforce the law strictly. In each other’s place, they would have done the same.\"* The emperor approved of his words. Had it not been for Liu’s single remark, how could the suspicion of excessive harshness have been so swiftly resolved?",

Moreover, wealth is especially valued for its connection to righteousness. Heaven’s judgment of men often hinges on this. Does taking more today truly mean one gains more? Does taking less today truly mean one gains less?\n\nIn ancient times, when Xue Bao divided property with his brothers, he took the elderly slaves, the barren fields, and the broken utensils. When Xu Ji divided property with his two uncles, he first asked them to take whatever they desired, leaving only a chest of books and two dilapidated rooms, which he accepted with joy, showing no resentment. Likewise: Wei Gong in the Xianxi era took only one or two divine artifacts; Dong Rong Shiheng took only books; Du Zhengxian Yan gave everything to his brothers; and Du Shentong Chun gave all to his youngest brother.

      "translated_text": "To know the masculine yet guard the feminine—great whiteness appears as black. Not to be poor is the treasure; the Old Master’s thrift. To broaden oneself by narrowing others—how can this be called abundant virtue? The mind must guard against excess, the body must practice restraint. Yet to speak only of wealth is to fall short of Heaven’s principle.\n\nTo endure humiliation without resentment: as the *Nirvana Sutra* relates, there was once a man who praised the Buddha as one of great blessed countenance. A listener grew furious and said, \"He lost his mother seven days after birth—how can he have great blessed countenance?\" The praiser replied, \"In the prime of his years and strength, he did not die prematurely; though violently beaten, he felt no anger; though his horse was struck, he did not retaliate—is this not great blessed countenance?\" The angry man’s heart was subdued. Generally, only one with blessed virtue can act thus, and only one who acts thus possesses blessed virtue. Such depth is not within the grasp of those with narrow and shallow capacities. Have you not heard of those in our dynasty with great blessed virtue?\n\nLong ago, when Lü Mengzheng was appointed Vice Minister, he was about to enter the court when a courtier behind a curtain pointed and said, \"Is this little fellow also a Vice Minister?\" Mengzheng feigned ignorance. Later, his colleagues insisted on learning the man’s name, but Mengzheng firmly refused, saying, \"If I knew his name, I would never forget it for the rest of my life—better not to hear it at all.\"\n\nWhen Fu Bi, Duke Wenzhong, was young, someone reviled him, and he heard it as if he had not. When told of it, he said, \"Perhaps he was cursing someone else.\" They replied, \"He clearly called out your name, Bi.\" He said, \"Are there not others in the world with the same name?\" And so he never inquired further.\n\nThese were scholars, and some might manage such restraint. But when even military men can do the same, it is truly admirable. Di Qing, the Vice Commander of Zhen Ding, once feasted with Sun Mian. A certain Liu Yi, also present, was known for his bluntness. When an actor mocked a scholar in jest, Liu flew into a rage and cried, \"How dare a branded convict behave so!\" He cursed Di Qing without cease, even hurling cups and dishes before storming off. Sun Mian watched Di Qing, whose composure remained unshaken, his smile unwavering, his words ever gentle. Only upon returning did Sun regret his own conduct—by then, Di Qing had already come to his door to apologize.\n\nWang Ji, serving as an auxiliary commander, joined the campaign against Liu Gan. Wang was cautious, dutiful, and sparing of words, appearing as if he had no ability. His peers constantly berated and scorned him, but he paid no heed, devoting himself entirely to his duties. He charged fearlessly into enemy lines, breaking through their ranks, and was later promoted to Commander. Could one without extraordinary forbearance have done the same? These men all had futures ahead of them, enjoying the fruits of blessed virtue. Who can say the Buddha’s words are untrue?\n\n**Eulogy:**",

      "translated_text": "**The Account of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\n**On Bestowing Kindness Without Seeking Recompense**\n\nThe *Tradition* states: The noble person acts with intention in bestowing kindness, but without intention in seeking recompense. If one acts with intention in seeking recompense, then self-interest lies in the reward. Such an act is not truly for another. Recompense may not be certain, but resentment will surely precede it—how can this be called kindness? Thus, recompense unattained is ever present in kindness given without intent.\n\nLong ago, Shang Lin served as magistrate of Wushan. The county commandant, Li Zhu, was most fierce and unruly. Without warning, he fell gravely ill. Lin took pity on him and asked if he had any last wishes. The commandant wiped his tears and spoke of his aged mother and young daughter. When he died, Lin set aside a portion of his salary to send the mother and her son’s coffin back to Hedong, and he arranged for the daughter’s marriage into a respectable family. One night, Lin dreamed of the commandant as if alive, bowing and weeping: \"You have no son. Moved by your kindness, I have petitioned the Emperor with all my strength. Now I am permitted to become your son.\" That very month, Lin’s wife conceived. The following year, as Lin resigned his post and traveled downstream, whenever he passed treacherous rapids, he glimpsed the commandant standing faintly on the shore, as if pointing the way. Nearing Jingzhou, he dreamed again of the commandant, who said: \"Tomorrow I shall be born in your residence. You must send a small box to the birthing chamber.\" Lin prepared a small box filled with millet, ready for gruel, and called it *he*. The child was named Ying. As he grew, he was exceedingly generous, quick to benevolence, and deeply filial. He rose to the rank of secretary in the Court of Judicial Review.\n\nYuwen Yingdi initially oversaw the prisons of Qianjiang. A local man, Fu Ai, had often lodged complaints against the officials of the Transport Bureau. When Fu was later imprisoned on unrelated charges, the officials, resentful, sought to fabricate evidence against him. Yingdi, indignant, vigorously defended him, and the sentence was ultimately reduced. Three years later, Yingdi traveled home along the official route, sailing downstream from Nanbin. It was the sixth month when suddenly a great rain fell, and the waters surged violently, waves towering like mountains. The towline snapped midstream, and the boatmen clasped their hands, resigned to capsizing. Then, a small boat emerged faintly through the mist and waves, drawing near to rescue them. Once ashore, they saw it was Fu Ai. Gazing at one another in astonishment, they exclaimed: \"When I once adjudicated the case in Qian, I had no particular intent toward you. Today, you risked your life to come—did you know the drowning man was I? Was this heaven’s design to make the matter known?\" They sighed together for a long while.\n\nAlas! When Lin acted as he did for the commandant, he thought only, *We are colleagues; this is how it should be*—how could he have known of the recompense of a son today? When Yingdi acted as he did for Fu Ai, he thought only, *This is how a case should be judged*—how could he have known of the recompense of rescue from drowning today? These were both acts of kindness without intent, recompense unattained. Had there been intent, the outcome would not have been the same.",

      "translated_text": "The ancient saying goes: \"Kindness, though bestowed indiscriminately, may meet with unexpected reciprocity; resentment must not be provoked, lest one encounter an adversary on a narrow path.\" Truly, these are words of profound wisdom.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nFear and compassion arise spontaneously from the seven emotions of the heart.\nWhen one seeks reputation through private connections, the mind of profit takes root.\nBenevolence is the natural principle of heaven, flourishing when it encounters the world.\nProfit, however, is human desire—its end inevitably leads to strife.\nA hair’s breadth may span a thousand miles; one must weigh matters carefully.\nTo give to others without regret is the way.\n\nThe *Tradition* says: Laozi declared, \"Having acted for others, one finds oneself ever more abundant; having given to others, one finds oneself ever more enriched.\" Generally, when people confront wealth, most become miserly—some refuse to part with even a single hair, while others give only to regret it later. Yet here are those who give without remorse. How could this be, if not for true joy in generosity? From this, fortune and virtue grow ever greater—is this not to be \"ever more abundant, ever more enriched\"?\n\nIn his youth, Liu Zhongtu once drank at a tavern where he saw a scholar about to call upon the Prefect of Wei to seek funds for his parents’ burial. Zhongtu asked, \"How much do you need?\" The scholar replied, \"Two hundred thousand cash.\" That very day, Zhongtu returned home, emptied all he possessed—one hundred taels of silver and tens of thousands in coin—and gave it all to the scholar without the slightest reluctance.\n\nWhen Master Fan Zhongyan sent his son Yaofu back to Gusuzhou to fetch wheat, their boat stopped at Danyang. There, Yaofu saw his old friend Shi Manqing, who had been unable to return home due to three unburied family members. Without hesitation, Yaofu gave him the entire five hundred *shi* of wheat on the boat. Upon returning home, before he could speak, Zhongyan asked, \"Did you see your old friend?\" Yaofu replied that Manqing had three unburied dead. Zhongyan said, \"Why did you not give him the wheat on the boat?\" Yaofu answered, \"I already did.\" His face lit up with joy. Could such men as these ever regret their actions? These were indeed great men, and such deeds were only fitting. Yet even among those of lesser stature, such people are not absent.\n\nConsider Li Qian, a wealthy man. During a year of famine, he lent a thousand *shi* of grain to his fellow villagers. The following year, famine struck again, and the people had nothing to repay him.",

      "translated_text": "Li Qian then gathered the villagers and burned the debt records before them, declaring, \"The debts are settled. No repayment is needed.\" The following year brought a bountiful harvest, and the people rushed to repay him, but he accepted nothing. The year after, famine struck again, and Li Qian exhausted his family’s wealth to set up gruel stations, saving tens of thousands of lives. Those who perished, he buried. Someone remarked, \"Your hidden virtue is vast.\" Li Qian replied, \"Hidden virtue is like ringing in the ears—only the self perceives it. If others now know, how can it still be called virtue?\"\n\nAnother man, Li Haoran, also wealthy, spent over forty years aiding the poor and distressed without the slightest slackening. Could such men as these ever regret their actions?\n\nLater, Liu Fan rose to prominence, and the grandsons of both Lis passed the imperial examinations. As the saying goes, \"The more one gives, the more one gains\"—was this not so?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo begin virtue and not see it through—this the ancients despised.\nBetter to incur one’s own resentment than to demand fulfillment of promises.\nThe noble man is not stingy; he acts decisively in doing good.\nWealth despised and cast aside is shallow when hoarded.\nTo act within one’s means—this is true convenience.\nSuch are the so-called good men.\n\nThe *Traditions* states: Confucius said, \"Good men I have never seen. If I could see those who are constant in virtue, that would suffice.\" But how then does one cultivate and adorn oneself to reach such a state? There is no other way—only by practicing the words in this text can one attain it.\n\nThe text says: As a minister, be loyal; as a child, be filial; among siblings, be harmonious; between husband and wife, be concordant. Rectify yourself to transform others, and extend compassion to all things. Do not deceive in darkness, nor tread crooked paths. Advance and retreat with the Dao, accumulate merit through deeds. Console the widowed, pity the orphaned, respect the aged, cherish the young. Grieve at misfortune, rejoice in goodness. Aid the urgent, rescue the imperiled. Do not flaunt your strengths nor expose others’ faults. Suppress evil, praise good. Take little, give much. Bear insult without resentment, receive favor with awe. Bestow kindness without seeking repayment, give to others without regret. Rejoice in others’ gains as your own, grieve at their losses as your own. Extend your benevolence even to insects, your kindness even to plants. Those who walk this path—are they not good men?\n\nFormerly, when the retired Grand Councilor Li Fang was honored during the Lantern Festival, Emperor Taizong ordered a palanquin to welcome him, seated him beside the imperial throne, and personally poured him wine from the imperial goblet. Selecting the finest fruits and delicacies, the emperor bestowed them upon him, saying, \"Men like you are truly good men and noble gentlemen. Though you held the highest offices, you never harbored thoughts of harming others—this is why I hold you in esteem.\"\n\nUpon returning home, Li Fang told his sons, \"Though I have no extraordinary achievements to astonish the world, I have never obscured others’ virtues, envied others’ advancement, deceived in darkness, or overstepped my bounds. In these four matters, I can say I have walked the path faithfully. Now, the Son of Heaven has honored me before the assembled ministers, calling me a good man and noble gentleman. Such titles are the highest praise for a man. Even Confucius said, ‘If I do not see such a person, how dare I claim the title?’ You must remember the emperor’s words of praise and my lifelong practice of these four principles. Be loyal to your lord, filial to your parents, cultivate yourself with care, and perhaps you may avoid disgrace.\"\n\nHis son, Li Zong’e, faithfully upheld his father’s teachings and became a renowned figure of his time.\n\nWhen Minister Li Mu passed away, the emperor personally attended the funeral, weeping bitterly. Turning to his attendants, he said, \"Does Heaven not wish good men to assist me? Why take him so soon?\"\n\nLi Zong’e asked Li Fang, \"What did my uncle do to move the emperor to such grief?\" Li Fang replied, \"Minister Li was pure, upright, and unassuming, free from desire. He was forthright without offending others, yielding without compromise. His learning was comprehensive, his judgment profound and refined—truly a man of great elegance. Moreover, he excelled in governance and was kind in his dealings with others. Thus, on the day of his passing, all who knew him—and even those who did not—lamented in unison. How else could he have moved the emperor, the lord of ten thousand chariots, to attend his funeral and weep so deeply?\"\n\nAlas!

      "translated_text": "The *Qian* hexagram’s six yang lines—with the *yuan* as the chief of goodness—admit not even an inch of shadow, pure as the celestial image. To receive the center of Heaven, one must cultivate it within. Extend this and act upon it: ease and benefit come through diligence. As yang grows and yin wanes, this heart expands to the breadth of Heaven. All people revere such a one.\n\nAs the tradition records: When Juyuan served as county magistrate, he once purchased silk in the public hall, personally unrolling the bolts himself. His maidservant, observing from behind the screen, grew indignant and said, “Who would have thought that today I would be made to serve a silk merchant’s clerk?” She demanded to leave, and none could dissuade her.\n\nWhen Fan Feng was Imperial Censor, there was a gatekeeper who had served in the Censorate for over forty years, having attended more than twenty censors. He could always discern a censor’s worth: when the censor was virtuous, the staff he held would lie horizontally as he bowed; otherwise, it stood upright. This saying had long been known. Those who became censors feared nothing more than his staff standing straight. One day, when it did, Fan Feng asked in alarm what was wrong. The gatekeeper replied, “Lately, I have seen the Censor repeatedly summon guests to instruct the kitchen—four or five times already. I thought to myself: if he ever becomes chief minister, will he not be just as fussy, meddling in every trifle? My heart truly disdains such pettiness, and so, unthinkingly, my staff stood straight.” Fan Feng, deeply ashamed, apologized again and again.\n\nAlas! Even a single misstep in conduct may cost one the respect of servants and subordinates—how much more so the reverence of all people? Know then that those whom all revere must truly be worthy of reverence. Have you not heard of the cases of Lord Wen and Grand Remonstrator Liu?\n\nWhen Lord Wen journeyed to the capital, the imperial guards, upon seeing him, could not help but raise their hands to their brows in salute. Even the common folk blocked his path, pleading, “Do not return home yet—stay and assist the Son of Heaven, that the people may live.” When Wang Bizhi passed through Qingzhou, he encountered hundreds of villagers who cheered and leapt for joy, crying out, “If Sima becomes chief minister, we shall all rejoice!” When Lord Wen passed away, the people of the capital closed their markets to mourn, selling their clothes to offer libations. Those who gathered for his funeral numbered tens of thousands. Even the elders of Fengzhou in Lingnan came in procession, over nine hundred of them burning incense upon their heads. Could such things occur if all did not revere him?\n\nWhen Grand Remonstrator Liu served in the Song court, people said: “To pass through Nanjing without seeing Attendant Liu is like visiting Sizhou without paying homage to the Great Sage.” When he died, the elderly, scholars, commoners—even women, children, farmers, and marketplace vendors—all vied to bring incense and recite Buddhist scriptures as they wept. The crowd at his gate was so dense that none could enter; thus, a great brazier was set in the hall to receive their offerings, and the price of incense soared. Could such things occur if all did not revere him?\n\nAnother example: When Lord Yi served in the Grand Secretariat, Yang Wengong, known for his jesting nature, would tease and mock all his colleagues without exception—save for Lord Yi, of whom he said, “I dare not jest with the Fourth Hall Academician.” Chen Xiang, Chen Lie, Zhou Ximeng, and Zheng Mu, all devoted to understanding Heaven and exhausting human nature, took the weight of the world as their own duty. Scholars revered them as the Four Masters. Even the most unruly and insolent dared not show disrespect at their gates.\n\nLord Fu Wenzhong once rode a small boat past Tianjin Bridge.",

      "translated_text": "In former times, Liu Qizhi, having passed the imperial examination, did not immediately assume office but returned to his studies. He often took Lacquered Carving Kai’s inability to trust fully as a warning, which greatly impressed Master Wen. When first appointed as a remonstrance official, he submitted twenty-four memorials in defiance, discerning the uprightness and depravity of court ministers. He also presented nineteen memorials opposing the employment of the petty man Zhang Zihou, causing others to shrink back in fear—yet he remained undeterred. When Zihou gained power, the minister fled into exile amid slanderous rumors, his path fraught with peril like plum blossoms in early spring or the perilous edge of death. The thunderous clamor of gossip made even mention of his name a cause for dread. Of the eight provinces he traversed, he governed seven, and though the summer heat made the roads treacherous, he ensured his subordinates maintained strict oversight. Each day, he advanced one stage, sometimes braving the dangers of sea voyages. All believed he would surely perish, yet he remained unharmed, living to eighty without ever falling ill.\n\nDuring his exile, a grain merchant, discerning Zihou’s intent, volunteered to assassinate him. Zihou promptly promoted the man from a minor post to transport commissioner of the region. The assassin rushed to within twenty *li* of the minister’s place of exile, intending to carry out his deed the following day. His attendants trembled with fear. Yet at midnight, a sudden clamor arose—it seemed the commissioner had been struck by some unseen force, vomiting blood and dying instantly. Had he not perished, the minister would have met his end. If not for the Dao of Heaven protecting him, could such a thing have come to pass?\n\nGeng Ziyu was likewise a man of virtue. When his father, serving as prefect of Baxi, was transferred to Ning Shu and died there, Ziyu escorted the coffin home. Autumn floods swelled the rivers, with only the tips of submerged rocks breaking the surface. The currents of Qutang Gorge were especially fierce, and as rain threatened, the boatmen grew terrified. Ziyu lifted his gaze to the heavens and wept aloud. Before his lament ended, the waters receded by over twenty *zhang*. Once they had passed, the river returned to its former state. Had the waters not subsided, who can say what might have befallen them? If not for the Dao of Heaven protecting him, could such a thing have come to pass?\n\nKnow this: the Dao of Heaven’s protection lies within oneself. How much more so for those of loyalty and filial piety, the crown of all virtues? Such goodness stands foremost.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nHeaven is impartial principle,\nacting as it must.\nWithout preference or aversion,\nwho wields its power?\nIt aids the good, upholds virtue,\nsupports the upright, exalts the worthy.\nFollowing the auspicious path,\nit responds in kind.\nWho protects me?\nHeaven within myself.\nFortune and emolument follow.\n\nThe *Tradition* says: As the *Book of Songs* declares,\n*\"Joyful is the noble man—\nfortune and emolument extend him;\njoyful is the noble man—\nfortune and emolument enrich him.\"*\nThis is the meaning of \"follow\" in the preceding passage. Generally, good and noble men, through their auspicious kindness, naturally attract fortune and emolument. Thus, wherever they go, these come unbidden, as if in pursuit.\n\nFormerly, Minister Fu Zhenggong, for his forthright remonstrance, incurred the displeasure of the chief minister, who recommended him for a mission to the unpredictable barbarians. At that time, Minister Ouyang Wenzhong submitted a memorial citing the case of Lu Qi recommending Yan Zhenqing to Li Xilie, warning that the chief minister sought to harm Zhenggong. Though the memorial went unanswered, by the time Zhenggong reached the barbarians, their ruler and ministers were reciting his words, seeking peace with the Middle Kingdom and eschewing war for nearly a hundred years. Upon his return, he was appointed Academician of the Bureau of Military Affairs, then Hanlin Academician, then Vice Director of the Bureau—each post he firmly declined. A month later, he was named Director of the Bureau, and again he refused. The emperor insisted on waiting for him before proceeding with court. Was this not fortune and emolument following him as a matter of course?\n\nSuch great fortune and emolument are not the sort that ordinary achievers dare aspire to. Yet speaking of each in their own circumstances, any attainment is fortune and emolument.\n\nThe physician Zhen Baili was originally a coarse and common man, yet he applied his mind with diligence. Regardless of the illness—great or small—he rushed to attend to it. One day, when the emperor fell ill, someone recommended his skill. After a single dose, the emperor recovered. Thereafter, he was favored above all other physicians, entering and leaving the palace for half a year. The gold he amassed was piled like ripe grain, totaling over twenty thousand pieces. The wine he stored in fine vessels exceeded three thousand *hu*. Though this may not be deemed fortune and emolument in the grandest sense, for Zhen himself, compared to his former days, was it not fortune and emolument?\n\nKnow this: fortune and emolument following one also lie within oneself.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nYan Yuan dwelt in a humble lane,\nBoyi and Shuqi starved on Shouyang.\nPoverty befell Yuan Xian,\npunishment claimed Fan Pang.\nThe response of fortune and emolument\nseems almost perverse.\nYet know these men\nrival the sun and moon in splendor.\nThis fortune, this emolument,\nshines bright for a thousand ages.\nThe multitude of evils shuns them.\n\nThe *Tradition* says: The multitude of evils refers to all that is unrighteous, for their kinds are manifold. Generally, the paths of right and wrong diverge and cannot coexist. Where right prevails, wrong cannot abide. It is like the sun shining upon an iceberg—the sun remains unchanged, while the ice must melt. The \"shunning\" is seen in ancient examples: spells could not touch Tan Xian, and the moon goddess dared not appear before Liang Gong.\n\nFormerly, the Daoist Lu Xiujing and his followers were skilled in incantations. They could cause monks’ robes and palace beams to tremble and rise, boasting of their prowess as if they were immortals. When the Dharma Master Tan Xian heard of this, he rebuked them: \"You have not yet met a true adversary—how dare you indulge in such petty tricks?\" He placed the robe of Master Zhou the Meditator on the ground and bade them cast their spells.

His sons, Zhongrong and Zhongbin, both passed the imperial examinations. The following year, Zhong’an also passed.

      "translated_text": "Cheng served in the Grand Council; Xi became Gentleman for Court Ceremonies. Alas! He desired longevity and attained it; he desired sons and had five; he desired rank and received it; he cultivated virtue and ascended as a Perfected Immortal. Then can anything one undertakes in this world fail to come to fruition?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nSeeking benevolence, one attains benevolence—such were Shuqi and Boyi.\nDiligently pursuing profit, one meets the fate of Robber Zhi.\nHeaven rewards the good, while evil ripens in due course.\nGreed, deceit, and cunning—each act bears its consequence.\nSuccess or failure, good or ill—its end is ever foreseeable.\nYet the Way of Immortals may still be hoped for.\n\nAs the tradition records: Zhang Yang perused the *Daoist Canon* and saw a wall-fish with a five-colored body, resplendent and dazzling. When he opened the scripture, he found that the characters for \"immortal\" had been entirely eaten away by bookworms. Thus he knew that the wall-fish, having consumed the characters for \"immortal,\" had gained its five-colored form. He Ruo once acquired a scroll of the *Daoist Scripture of Rites* and found within it an object resembling a coiled lock of hair, about four inches in circumference, endless in its loop. When he cut it, water flowed from both ends, filling more than a liter. He asked many, but none could identify it. One day, he encountered a Daoist adept and inquired. The adept said, \"That you met this thing yet failed to ascend—such is your fate. This is a *maiwang*, born of a wall-fish that has thrice consumed the characters for 'immortal.' When held to the light of the stars, it summons celestial messengers, and one may obtain the Elixir of Return. Drinking its water transforms the bones.\" He Ruo returned home, read the scroll in full, and found that every instance of the characters for \"immortal\" had indeed been eaten away. Thus he knew that a wall-fish, having thrice consumed the characters for \"immortal,\" could transform into a *maiwang*.\n\nAlas! Even an insect may achieve this—how much more so a human who aspires to immortality! There is nothing unattainable in such hope. Generally, humans and immortals share the same true nature; it is only that emotions prevail, and one loses this truth. Once one returns to truth and sheds worldly attachments entirely, one becomes an immortal. Moreover, if one aids this with goodness, seeking examples from antiquity—such as Zhang Liang’s loyalty, Wu Meng’s filial piety, Wang Jinxian’s unwavering chastity, Lan Qi’s fraternal devotion, Liu Yi’s selfless generosity, Zhao Sutai’s relief of the poor and burial of the dead, Master Xu’s healing with talismans and water, Yan Pingjun’s guidance through virtue, Zhou Bochi’s burial of abandoned remains, Li Wulang’s honesty in measurement, Chen Anshi’s refusal to take life, Li Xizi’s rescue of starving birds, Yang Jingzhi’s tranquil meditation, Tang Ruoshan’s freedom from anger, Huang Wanyou’s few faults, Jing Xiang’s passion for liberating living creatures—even Liu Pinga, originally a physician; Wu Mu, a county clerk; Liu Yan, a courtesan; Bao Jing, an innkeeper; He Sheng, a butcher; Ding Yue, a soldier; Zhu, a bandit; Li Zhengxuan, a hunter—all ascended from mortal to immortal.\n\nIn our own time, Chao Gongxiong became the Heavenly Lord of Tranquil Abode; Master Zhang Wenqi, the Perfected Lord of Life and Destiny; Wang Gongsu, Attendant Gentleman of the Jade Capital; Lü Gonghui, Censor of the Celestial Court; Han Gongqi, Master of the Purple Palace; Fu Gongbi, Overseer of Kun Terrace; Wang Gongsou, Keeper of the Iron Wheel of the Sagely Protector; Jin Sansan, Wind Earl of the Sagely Assistant; Zhang Xiaoji, Master of Mount Song; Dou Yujun, Perfected Immortal of the Grotto-Heavens; Ouyang Xiu, Master of Divine Clarity; Wang Anguo, Master of Lingzhi; Lü Qin, Master of the Jade Assembly; Shi Yannian, Master of Hibiscus; Chen Jing, Judge of the Bureau of Merit; Tian Chengjun, Master of Weiyang—these, too, ascended from mortal to immortal.\n\nThe scriptures state: In the Left Grotto-Yang Palace of the Second Grade of the Middle Primordial, which governs the Nine Imperial Mounds of Earth, the Four Corners, and the Eight Extremities, the divine officials and their subordinates number ninety-nine million, nine hundred ninety-nine thousand. All were persons of merit in the world who, upon receiving the Daoist precepts, were promoted to their posts. For example, He Xizhi of our prefecture, who annotated the *Diamond Sutra* to benefit the world, was posthumously appointed Inspector of the Western Marchmount and held various offices. Though this was a position in the Marchmount’s administration, it was still a promotion through the Daoist precepts. Who then can say that immortality is unattainable?\n\nYet some aspire to it and ultimately fail—not because immortality is unattainable, but because their cultivation was insufficient. Have you not heard the words of the Two Perfected? Zhongli Quan said, \"Immortals seek humans more earnestly than humans seek immortals.\" Lü Dongbin said, \"People lament not seeing me, yet even if they saw me daily and did not follow my words, what benefit would it bring?\" Both lamented that humans cannot attain immortality.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe Way of Immortals is often called remote and vague.\nSeeking yet not finding—Emperor Wu of Han was shamed.\nLike the Buddhist teachings of hell and heaven:\nIf heaven truly exists, it must be the abode of the loyal and good.\nIf hell truly exists, it must be the domain of the petty and base.\nThose who seek celestial immortality must perform one thousand three hundred good deeds;\nThose who seek earthly immortality must perform three hundred.\n\nAs the tradition states: The distinction between celestial and earthly immortals lies in the difference in the number of good deeds performed. This has already been explained in the text and need not be discussed further. Let us speak instead of advancing beyond the hundred-foot pole—those who have already attained immortality will not fall but ascend further; those who have not yet attained need not seek elsewhere, for they may reach it this very day.\n\nŚākyamuni said: There are ten kinds of immortals:\n1. Earth-Walking Immortals,\n2. Flying Immortals,\n3. Wandering Immortals,\n4. Void-Traveling Immortals,\n5. Heaven-Walking Immortals,\n6. All-Pervading Immortals,\n7. Dao-Practicing Immortals,\n8.

      "translated_text": "It is further stated: All these follow not the true awakening but pursue deluded thoughts, fixating on preserving form and wandering in mountain forests where men do not tread. Though they live for thousands or ten thousand years, they remain bound to the cycle of rebirth—deluded, inverted, and confused. When their retribution is exhausted, they return, scattered into various destinies.\n\nThose who steadfastly ingest elixirs without ceasing, perfecting the Way of ingestion, are called Earth-Walking Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly consume herbs and plants without ceasing, perfecting the Way of medicine, are called Flying Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly refine metals and minerals without ceasing, perfecting the Way of transformation, are called Wandering Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly regulate movement and stillness without ceasing, perfecting the purity of qi, are called Void-Traveling Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly preserve seminal essence without ceasing, perfecting the nourishment of virtue, are called Heaven-Walking Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly refine essence and form without ceasing, perfecting the absorption of purity, are called All-Pervading Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly uphold incantations and prohibitions without ceasing, perfecting the arts of method, are called Dao-Practicing Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly cultivate contemplation without ceasing, perfecting the clarity of thought, are called Radiant Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly engage in union without ceasing, perfecting the resonance of awakening, are called Essence-Preserving Immortals.\nThose who steadfastly master transformation without ceasing, perfecting the nature of awakening, are called Transcendent Immortals.\n\nZhongli Quan said: There are five kinds of immortals:\n1. Ghost Immortals,\n2. Human Immortals,\n3. Earthly Immortals,\n4. Divine Immortals,\n5. Celestial Immortals.\n\nIn response to a question on the Great Dao, he further stated: The Dao originally has no questions; questions originally have no answers. Among all things, the most intelligent and noble is man. If one can exhaust the principles of all things and fulfill one’s own nature, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature to the utmost of destiny—preserving life in its entirety to harmonize with the Dao—then one naturally becomes as steadfast as heaven and earth and shares in their longevity.\n\nThose who do not awaken to the Great Dao but seek only swift attainment, making their minds like dead ashes and their forms like withered wood, inwardly guarding their spirit and unwavering in their resolve, may project their yin spirit in deep concentration. Yet in the end, they are but ethereal ghosts, not pure yang immortals, and are called Ghost Immortals.\n\nThose who briefly encounter the Great Dao among men, yet bear heavy karma and meager fortune, may retreat due to demonic obstacles or cling to one-sided practices without change—abstaining from the five flavors without knowing the six qi, forgetting the seven emotions without knowing the ten precepts, practicing swallowing and rinsing while mocking breath cultivation as misguided, dismissing stillness as foolish, delighting in seizing qi from heaven and earth without ceasing their grain intake, or fixating on visualization to absorb the essence of the sun and moon without practicing daoyin, sitting idly in solitude without recognizing natural movement, or laboring the body without understanding non-action—can only prolong their years in ease and comfort, and are called Human Immortals.\n\nThose who emulate the ascending and descending principles of heaven and earth, grasp the generative and consummative numbers of the sun and moon, employ years and months within the body and hours within the day, recognize the dragon and tiger, pair Kan and Li, discern the clarity and turbidity of the water source, distinguish the earliness and lateness of qi, gather the True One, observe the Two Modes, differentiate the Three Powers, divide the Four Images, arrange the Five Phases, stabilize the Six Qi, assemble the Seven Treasures, sequence the Eight Trigrams, practice the Five Phases, invert the Nine Provinces, transmit qi from mother to child, circulate fluids between husband and wife, reverse the Three Fields, refine the elixir to joy, permanently stabilize the lower field, refine the form to abide in the world, and attain longevity without death, are called Earthly Immortals.\n\nThose who, having attained Earthly Immortality, continue their practice without cease, transcend the ordinary and enter the sagely, and return to the Three Mountains, are called Divine Immortals.\n\nThose who, having attained Divine Immortality, transmit the Dao to the world, contribute to the Dao and benefit others, fulfill their merit and conduct, and ascend to the Grotto-Heavens to assume office as immortal officials—if they further render great service to heaven and earth and achieve great deeds across past and present—progress through the ranks, ascending through the thirty-six Grotto-Heavens, returning to the eighty-one Yang Heavens, and from there transcending into the realm of emptiness and spontaneity, are called Celestial Immortals.\n\nThus, what Śākyamuni called true awakening and Zhongli Quan called the Great Dao—what do they truly signify? True awakening is the Great Dao; the Great Dao is true awakening. In general, if one wishes to recognize one’s own mind without falling into conceptual understanding, have you not heard the teaching of *seng-nā*? *Seng-nā* said: Illuminate your own mind by constantly examining and reflecting in the midst of daily activities—walking, standing, sitting, and lying down. When encountering forms or sounds, before thoughts arise, where does the mind go? Is it existent? Is it nonexistent? If it does not fall into existence or nonexistence, the mind’s pearl shines alone, perpetually illuminating the world without the slightest obstruction, interruption, or discontinuity—this is true awakening, this is the Great Dao.\n\nThus, Master Lü, though unlearned in alchemy, attained deliverance into the world. Later, upon hearing the teaching “Do not abide anywhere, yet give rise to the mind,” his heart-mind became thoroughly enlightened. Having attained this enlightenment, he once offered meals to monks at Xinghua in Tan. Master Sun, though devoted to medical texts, attained deliverance into the world. Later, he sought instruction from the Vinaya Master Xuan of the Tang. Having received this instruction, he once listened to the *Treasure Pagoda Sutra* from an unnamed wandering monk in Chengdu. This is what it means to advance beyond the hundred-foot pole.\n\nAs for performing good deeds, it is naturally so; even without seeking immortality, it is naturally so.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThree hundred rituals, three thousand deportments—\nOnly through interaction with others is the human way fulfilled.\nAccumulating merit and piling up good deeds,\nThere must be sequence and priority.\nWith strict and detailed regulations,\nNot a hair’s breadth is amiss.",

      "translated_text": "Thus is the immortal’s Dao: to harmonize humanity with Heaven. If one acts contrary to righteousness or moves against principle, the saying goes—Mencius said: \"Principle and righteousness are what all human hearts naturally affirm.\" What Mencius called righteousness is principle; in essence, principle and righteousness reside within humanity and must not be violated. Should one transgress them, one cannot avoid being swept away into turbid obscurity, sinking into mediocrity and base dealings, descending to every sort of degradation. How then could one dwell in purity and stillness, delighting in the savor of the Dao?\n\nLet me speak of one or two exemplary gentlemen, that others may know shame. Of old, Guo Yanqing was renowned for his literary refinement and conduct. Disdaining the shallowness of the age, he built a garden on the south bank of the river and dwelt there for over twenty years, never once setting foot in the city. In his youth, he kept company with Zhang Wending and Lü Wenmu. When Zhang and Lü successively became chief ministers, they recommended him to the court, but though he was offered an official post, he refused to accept it. At the time, Qian Weiyan, the cultured and refined, served as military governor; Xie Jiang was judicial administrator; Yin Zhu was secretary; and Ouyang Xiu was assistant magistrate—all men of literary and moral distinction who admired his character. One day, they dismissed their retinues and went together to visit Yanqing. After a long conversation, Yanqing served them wine in a pottery vessel with fruit and nuts. Weiyan, charmed by his rustic simplicity, drank deeply without restraint. As evening fell, an officer arrived to report that the hour of *shen* had passed, and the governor’s clerks and armed attendants were arrayed in the courtyard. Yanqing calmly asked, \"What offices do you gentlemen hold, that you travel with such a large retinue?\" Zhu pointed to Weiyan and said, \"This is the governor, the chief minister.\" Yanqing replied, \"I never imagined that today you would deign to visit a rustic like me.\" They all laughed heartily and drank several more cups. When the sun set, the officials took their leave. Yanqing saw them out, saying, \"I am old and infirm and cannot return your visit—pray do not be surprised.\" Weiyan mounted his carriage in a daze, as though he had entered the realm of immortals. Later, he sighed and said, \"How lightly this man regards wealth and honor!\" Such was a scholar-official who dwelt in purity and stillness, delighting in the savor of the Dao.\n\nAs for Du Wulang, he was originally a farmer, yet he too held firmly to his principles. His home lay thirty *li* from the county seat, consisting of only two small rooms—one for himself, the other for his son. There was nothing but an empty bed, with no other possessions.",

He laughed and replied, \"I am of no use to the times and seek nothing from others—it is merely that I do not go out by chance.\"\n\nSun then asked how he made a living. Du said, \"Formerly, I lived south of the county, where I had half a *qing* of land, which I farmed together with my brother’s son. After my brother’s son married, I judged that the land would not suffice to support us both, so I gave it all to him. I then brought my wife and children here, where a villager had two vacant rooms, and I borrowed them to live in. At first, I sold medicines and selected auspicious days to support myself. When my son grew up, a villager gave me thirty *mu* of land to tenant. With surplus strength from farming, I also hired myself out to others. From then on, I had just enough, and as I did not wish to contend with others for profit, I abandoned all practices like medicine and divination.\"\n\nSun asked, \"What do you do all day?\" Du replied, \"I simply sit upright.\" Sun asked, \"Have you ever read scriptures?\" Du said, \"Twenty years ago, I once read a copy of the *Vimalakīrti Sutra*.

Now that I have entered China, everywhere I see the slaughter of pigs and sheep, their flesh hung in the markets—I cannot bear the sight. I do not wish to stay here long; I will make a brief pilgrimage to Mount Wutai to pay homage to Mañjuśrī, then return home.”\n\nThere is a line in a poem by the mountain recluse: *“Its fangs are already clenched like a child’s fist.”* When Zhang Ge first read this, he frowned in displeasure, calling the poet a cruel man. Yet this was merely the poet’s description of a thing—hardly an act of cruelty. Zhang, then serving as judicial officer in Henei, had followed the example of his superior, Ge Fan, who ate only vegetables and chanted scriptures; Zhang, too, had given up meat, hence his reaction.\n\nIf all people could awaken as Master Jue did, or as Zhang did, and always regard all creatures with compassion, I am certain they would never dare to take evil for ability or steel themselves to cruelty and harm. For this reason, I first set forth these examples before briefly recounting the consequences of such acts.\n\nLong ago, Lu Xiaozheng sought to gather a swarm of bees but failed. Enraged, he poured boiling water over them, leaving none alive. Soon after, in the same place, he was suddenly stung to death by a giant bee.\n\nZhou Ang once napped during the day. On the door above him was a swallow’s nest, where three fledglings chirped, waiting to be fed. Ang, in a fury, stuffed thorns into their mouths, and all three died with their chests split open. Later, his three sons were all born mute.\n\nAt Jinhua Temple stood several cypress trees, which suddenly became infested with yellow caterpillars nearly two inches long. They devoured the branches and leaves without end. The monk Xiu Rong, repulsed, ordered them all swept away, buried, or discarded in a pile of firewood. His disciple, Xiu Ren, then spread the firewood in the sun to kill the remaining caterpillars before using it for fuel.\n\nYears later, when Xiu Rong died, another monk in the temple also passed away but later revived. He told Xiu Ren: “I saw Xiu Rong in the underworld, bearing an iron yoke beneath the scorching sun. Countless caterpillars swarmed over him, biting and gnawing—his suffering was unbearable.” Upon hearing this, Xiu Ren was seized with terror. Within days, he developed a carbuncle on his back and died.\n\nThe monk Xiu Zhun of Daci Temple had newly built a pavilion surrounded by bamboo. Ants crawled all over the railings.

Even if you do not ascend to heaven in broad daylight, you are destined to become a grand councilor for twenty years of peace. When power is in your hands, remember my words—do not recklessly engage in secret harm.\"* Once Linfu attained high office, he no longer recalled the warning. Instead, he clung to favor and wrought much destruction. After some time, he dreamed of the Daoist reproaching him: *\"Have you forgotten my words? Now you have truly incurred guilt.\"* Thereupon, an underling led him to a place where Linfu heard only the rushing sound of wind and water in his ears. Upon arrival, he saw an imposing government office, its curtains and bedding lavishly adorned. Linfu rejoiced, saying: *\"Even if I were to dwell here, it would not be so bad.\"* The Daoist laughed: *\"This is the abode of scaled and shelled creatures. The suffering here is most cruel and bitter. If you still find it not bad, what then would you call evil?\"* Linfu was struck with terror, his sweat soaking through as he awoke. This is the fate of one who secretly harms the good and virtuous—reborn among aquatic creatures.\n\nXu Wengui was once summoned to the netherworld.

Guo Cong was honored by imperial decree, his gate and lane adorned with banners of commendation; Meng Xi, while digging the earth, discovered gold beneath his hoe and thus became a wealthy household. Does Heaven ever fail to reward loyalty and filial piety? In truth, it never errs.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nReverence spares no disrespect,\nDeceit bears no true weight.\nIn serving father, in serving lord,\nNo reverence surpasses this.\nTo withhold one’s heart\nIs but deceit.\nAs face and form belong to man,\nSo too the role of minister and child.\nThough one claim ignorance,\nThe gods and spirits make it plain.\n\n*The Sixth Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Stimulus and Response concludes here.*\n\n*The Seventh Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Stimulus and Response begins.*\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\n*On Teachers*\nA teacher is one who transmits the Dao, imparts knowledge, and resolves doubts. Even a single word of enlightenment, a single character passed down, originates from them—how could one dare treat them with disdain?\n\nIn former times, when Hu Yuandi served as a teacher, his disciples—such as Qian Zao, steadfast and profound; Sun Jue, pure and bright; Fan Chunren, upright and gentle; and Qian Gongfu, simple and honest—were all renowned scholars of their age. Yet in their teacher’s presence, they conducted themselves no differently than children and younger brothers attending their father and elder brothers, never once showing disrespect.\n\nWhen Sun Mingfu served as a teacher, his disciples—such as Shi Jie, broadly learned and versatile, and Zhang Dong, widely read and erudite—were among the most virtuous in Lu. Even those of great virtue, in their teacher’s presence, followed in step when ascending or descending, carried his staff and sandals when bowing, and maintained solemn reverence—never was disrespect heard of.\n\nTake, for instance, Peng Ruli, a Grand Master for Court Consultation, who in his youth studied under Ni Tianyin of Silu. When Peng later held the office of Protector of Trust, he welcomed Tianyin to his residence and treated him with the utmost reverence as a disciple. After Tianyin’s death, his mother remained unburied, and the following year, his wife also passed, leaving no son. Peng arranged the burials of all three, then married Tianyin’s daughter to Song Huan, a successful candidate in the same imperial examination. Minister Wang Cun, in his youth, studied under Chen Jun of Yingchuan. When Jun died without an heir, Wang appointed Jun’s brother’s son to an official post, ensuring Jun’s wife had someone to rely on. Such men never forgot their teachers even after death—how much less would they dare show disrespect while they lived?\n\nThose who do treat teachers with disdain are but frivolous and petty men. They fail to recognize that teachers possess profound qualities not to be slighted. Their guidance may yet enlighten, their hidden virtues may be immense, and their descendants may flourish in ways yet unseen. The deeds of the Wang family serve as proof.\n\nLong ago, there was a teacher named Wang, whose family was exceedingly poor, and he made his living by instructing village children. In his old age, he had a son at eight years old but could not afford to raise him, so he entrusted the boy to a monk at the Western Temple. The monk, upon seeing the child, recognized his exceptional nature and immediately allowed him to partake in offerings, sparing no expense in supporting him. During the Xianping era, the boy was recommended as a worthy and upright candidate, later rising to the rank of Participant in Determining Governmental Matters, then Military Affairs Commissioner. His name and position were illustrious, his official achievements surpassing others—this was Wang Wenkang. Xu was his given name. Wenkang’s son, Yirou, advanced to the rank of Dragon Diagram Academician. Yirou’s sons, Jinxing and Jinyan, both attained the rank of Grand Master, known for their virtue, and often associated with scholars like Kangjie. How, then, could one dare treat teachers with disdain?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFather gives life, teacher imparts teaching,\nBoth are spoken of as one.\nTransmitting the Dao, imparting knowledge—\nWhich is the root, which the source?\nIn mourning garb, the heart mourns three years.\nThis is the weight of human relations,\nAnd the Way of Heaven as well.\nTo disdain what one should revere—\nNo evil surpasses this.\nTo betray what one serves.\n\n*On Betrayal*\nSubordinates to their superiors, soldiers to their commanders, servants and concubines to their masters—all serve. Betrayal need not be outright defiance; even in times of urgency, failing to rely on them, or in matters of profit and harm, showing no concern—this is betrayal. Let me speak of a few servants and soldiers, that those above them may feel some shame.\n\nLong ago, a servant named Zhao Yansi served Wang Linji as a retainer. Linji, who held the office of Drafter of Imperial Decrees, died within a year along with his son, leaving his family impoverished and unable to support themselves. Yansi, bound by righteousness, refused to leave. He exhausted his strength to raise Linji’s three daughters for over a decade, never once seeing their faces. When the girls came of age, he journeyed to the capital to seek out Linji’s former colleagues, Academician Bai and Vice Director Yang Huizhi, weeping loudly as he recounted his story. The two officials, astonished, said, “What you have done surpasses us.” They pooled their resources to bring the three daughters to the capital, arranged good marriages for them, and found them reputable husbands. At the time, Master Shi Shoudao of Culai wrote an account of this to shame those who lacked steadfastness in righteousness.\n\nWang Kui initially served as a servant to Luntian Langzhong Li Tan, then enlisted as a soldier and was selected for the Bangri Army. When Tan and his son were implicated in a case and imprisoned in the Censorate, none of their former relatives or friends dared visit or send provisions. Only Kui stood guard at the prison gate daily, supplying them with food and drink for over forty days without the slightest negligence. When the case was concluded, Tan was exiled to Nannen Prefecture. As the entourage prepared to depart, all others took their leave, but Kui alone accompanied them. Tan, suddenly overcome with grief and indignation, took his own life. Kui arranged his funeral and mourned him as if he were his own father and son, moving all who witnessed it to tears. Only after all matters were settled did he dare depart. At the time, Minister Sima Wengong also wrote an account of this to admonish those who treat righteousness lightly.\n\nHow, then, can those who receive kindness from others, yet abandon them at the first sign of profit or harm, compare even to servants like Zhao Yansi and Wang Kui?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nRulers, teachers, elders, and superiors—\nThose who receive their grace...",

As a result, Guo repeatedly failed the imperial examinations, while Li later passed first. When Guo was later appointed examiner, Li—having only qualified through the lesser *mingjing* degree—was among the candidates. On the day the edict was announced, Li deeply regretted his past actions and returned home. Upon hearing this, Guo immediately sent a trusted friend to summon him back, allowing him to retake the examination and pass. Yet could Guo’s excellence ever truly be suppressed?

It is lamentable that he did not understand how elders and classmates should treat one another with kindness.\n\nIn another case, Han Yi and Li Ruogu studied together in their youth and once traveled the same road to take the examinations, sharing a single quilt and felt mat. Whenever they went out, they took turns serving as each other’s attendants. That year, Li passed first and was appointed registrar of Changshe in Xuzhou. As he prepared to take office, Li personally led the mule for his wife, while Han followed behind, carrying a basket.

Yet when friends observe and emulate one another’s virtues, the Dao flourishes and transformation ripens. Even if one’s talent is lacking, like stone that polishes jade, with the right companionship, one attains high office and a hundred blessings.\n\nBut falsehood, slander, deceit, and pretense—these are the four poisons. As the saying goes: *Falsehood* is reckless and groundless; *slander* is baseless defamation; *deceit* is a web of cunning schemes; *pretense* is exaggerated artifice. Though distinct in name, they share the same root: dishonesty.\n\nBroadly speaking, sincerity is the Way of Heaven; cultivating sincerity is the Way of Man. Yet now, abandoning sincerity to practice falsehood, slander, deceit, and pretense is to rebel against Heaven’s Way and forsake the human path. Having defied both, where can one escape the Three Evil Realms?\n\nThus Master Yaoshan said: \"To recognize the path of hungry ghosts, look to those today who are full of emptiness and short on substance, who make others distrust them.\" Again he said: \"Do you wish to know the path of hell? It is those now boiling in cauldrons of scalding oil. Do you wish to know the path of hungry ghosts? It is those now full of emptiness and short on substance, who make others distrust them. Do you wish to know the path of beasts? It is those now who recognize neither benevolence nor duty, who cannot distinguish kin from stranger.

Looking to those who came before, none expressed this more aptly than Master Fan Wenzheng.\n\nFan Wenzheng said: \"Many of my clan dwell in Wu.

He selected one virtuous elder to oversee its administration, giving each person a daily ration of one *sheng* of rice and an annual allotment of one bolt of silk. For weddings, funerals, and other needs, he provided additional support. His son, Chunren, was especially able to carry on his father’s aspirations. He maintained frugality and integrity, using his entire salary to expand the charitable estate. When granted the privilege of hereditary office, he always prioritized distant relatives. On the day of his death, five of his grandsons had yet to receive official appointments.\n\nSuch were these father and son—they truly embodied the principle of cherishing one’s kin. Others, too, exemplified this virtue: Minister Peng Siyong showed great kindness in nurturing his clan; Duke Zhang Kangjie often shared his salary with his nine generations of kin; Zhao Fuyou Shikai donated gold to relieve the uncountable poor among his relatives; and Gong’an, my revered ancestor, took in orphaned and widowed members of the clan, arranging marriages for them.

      "translated_text": "**Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nStrength without benevolence.\nThe *Transmission* says: Confucius regarded strength as akin to benevolence, while the Most High deemed strength devoid of benevolence. How could the words of the sages contradict one another? The strength Confucius commended was resolute fortitude—unyielding within, the strength of a noble man, who would even sacrifice himself to fulfill benevolence, hence \"akin to benevolence.\" It is also said: \"The root, if it desires, how could it not be strong?\"\n\nThe strength the Most High cautioned against was brute force—wrath ever manifest without, the strength of a petty man, who bullies others and tramples all things. How could this be benevolence? Thus, it is called \"without benevolence.\" It is also said: \"The violent do not meet a natural death.\" And again: \"The rigid and unyielding are companions of death.\" Generally, brute force, if one cannot restrain oneself, readily leads to the fault of lacking benevolence. This is why the Most High declared it in writing: \"without benevolence.\"\n\nIn former times, Huan Fan, bearing the imperial tally, oversaw the military affairs of Qing and Xu provinces. Upon first arriving in Xuzhou, he quarreled with the prefectural governor, Xu Qi, over a residence and sought to invoke his authority to execute Qi. Qi reported this to the court, and Fan, having no just cause, was dismissed from office. Later, when he governed Jizhou, Lü Zhaocai served as General of the Northern Garrison, and Jizhou fell under his command. Fan, considering that Zhaocai had risen in office after him, held him in contempt and said to his wife: \"I would rather kneel before the Three Dukes than bow to Lü Zizhan.\" His wife replied: \"In Xuzhou, you sought to invoke your authority to execute Qi. Everyone said you would be difficult to serve under. Now in Jizhou, you refuse to bow to Lü Zizhan. People will say you are difficult to serve above.\" Enraged by her words, Fan struck her abdomen with a sword hilt, causing her to miscarry and die. Such violence—was this not lacking in benevolence?\n\nBao Xiaosu was inwardly resolute and unyielding. When his subordinates presented matters to him, he often rebuked them to their faces. Yet if their words accorded with reason, he would cheerfully amend his ways. Thus, all admired his strength without finding him obstinate. This was resolute fortitude, distinct from brute force. Hence, the differing views of the Most High and Confucius.\n\nI have often reflected: even if one avoids brute force, excessive reliance on strength still risks error. Yang Wengong Yi, unmatched in literary prowess, was deeply favored by the emperor, yet his unyielding nature alienated others. Though many spoke in his favor, the emperor’s regard waned. Wang Neihan Yuchen, also unmatched in literary skill, was considered for high office, but his unyielding nature provoked opposition, and the imperial decree never came. Thus, unchecked strength—does it not bring harm to oneself? If even these two gentlemen met such ends, what of others?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nStrength that does not overcome strength,\nviolent and without kinship.\nStrength that does not strengthen the self\nmust lord over others.\nThis is called a baleful virtue—\nhow could it be benevolence?\nGood thoughts thus severed,\nwhat evil would not follow?\nSeek your manifold blessings,\nfor a withered tree knows no spring.\n\n**Obstinate and Self-Willed**\nThe *Transmission* says: Obstinate and self-willed—according to the Buddha’s analogy, like a vicious horse, difficult to tame. If one is as untamable as a horse, should one not be counted among the lowest of men? Thus, in the *Dharma Wheel Sutra*, the Most High praised those who do not cling to their own ways and exhorted others to follow. Here, in this text, he again warns against obstinacy and self-will. Our Master Confucius also said: \"The foolish who delight in their own ways, the lowly who delight in their own authority—such men bring disaster upon themselves.\" The sages of the Three Teachings all spoke thus—how could one not take heed?\n\nGenerally, the obstinate and self-willed distance themselves from friends and acquaintances, and take no pleasure in the discourse of life and the Dao. In daily conduct, they are perverse and unyielding—how could they avoid error? It is lamentable that they do not flow with goodness as water flows downward.\n\nWhat the noble man practices, how could one cling to one’s own ways—let alone be obstinate? Formerly, Lord Li Wenzheng Fang often said: \"At the end of the Xiande reign, I served as Hanlin Academician. When my mother, the Great Lady Ding, passed away, I resumed my duties after the mourning period. At the time, the Vice Minister of Rites, Dou Yan, admonished me: 'The fish-shaped tally, signifying diligent service to the ruler day and night, is adorned with gold—an ornament of the body. You, having been compelled by imperial decree to curtail your mourning, should not wear gold or jade.' I immediately acknowledged my oversight. From then on, I resolved: 'As a son, though mourning rites are not prearranged, if one fails to observe the three-year mourning with propriety, not only does one fall short of the norms of proper conduct, but how could one face one’s peers among the gentry?' Through this, I came to recognize Dou’s words as those of a true elder.\"\n\nMaster Zhengshu, passing through Fan Yaofu’s administrative post, said to Yaofu: \"I heard that when the former commander died, you, having succeeded him only days before, held a banquet with music to entertain and reward the officers. Is this true?\" Yaofu replied: \"It is.\" The master said: \"At first, you should have dispersed the gathering, making them understand that the lack of provisions was due to the former commander’s death.\" Yaofu’s face flushed with heat, and sweat drenched him as shame welled within. The next day, he escorted the master to the border, saying: \"Had you not traveled far, I would not have heard such wise words.\"\n\nThese two gentlemen, when faced with matters, followed goodness thus. Is it any wonder their names resounded in their time and their blessings flowed to their descendants? Could the obstinate and self-willed ever hope for the same?\n\n**Eulogy:**",

      "translated_text": "In the early years of the Qingli era, he was appointed as the wine inspector of Zhengzhou. One day, a sudden storm of wind and hail arose, and a copper coffin without a lid descended. The master immediately straightened his robe and cap, entered, and lay within it. In an instant, a lid descended and sealed the coffin. With a thunderous crash, the coffin rose into midair and drifted slowly northward. Today, he serves as the Judge of the Northern Dipper’s Lifespan Bureau, accompanying the Perfected Warrior Lord in his annual descent to assess the good and evil deeds of mortals, measuring the length of their allotted lifespans. Had he not, in daily life, affirmed right and negated wrong without reckless utterance, would the Perfected Warrior Lord have entrusted him with such a weighty office? These two gentlemen, in their transcendence, achieved such an end—what fate, then, awaits those who fail to discern right from wrong?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWho slanders, who praises—such was the upright Way of the Three Dynasties.\nThe impartiality of right and wrong is as clear as black and white.\nYet petty minds, once deluded, invert praise and blame,\nConfusing the upright with the wicked, the virtuous with the thieving.\nHeaven’s judgment is never misled; the sun shines bright and clear.\nTo turn toward or away—this is where propriety is breached.\n\n**Commentary:**\n\"Turning toward\" means aligning with what is proper; \"turning away\" means opposing it. To turn away when one should turn toward, or turn toward when one should turn away—this is what the Most High calls \"breaching propriety.\" The gentleman refrains from such acts, but the petty man commits them without scruple.\n\nIn former times, Minister Wang Zun maintained fair and impartial judgments, never swaying toward or against any side. His resolve was steadfast and unshakable. As Master Wen once praised him: *\"Amidst ten thousand galloping horses, only Wang Zun could stand firm.\"* Thus, from his youth to old age, serving five reigns with unwavering devotion, he held fast to one principle through all changes and upheavals.\n\nWhen Minister Liu Zhisu enumerated the ten harms of the corvée assistance policy, those in power demanded an account of his stance. Summoned to the Ministry of Revenue, he was ordered to explain himself. He replied: *\"What I turn toward is loyalty and uprightness; what I turn away from is deceit and flattery. What I turn toward is righteousness; what I turn away from is self-interest. What I turn toward is the sovereign and the father; what I turn away from is the powerful and the corrupt. If governance follows this path, punishment is my due. Yet the corvée remains a scourge upon the realm—I beg Your Majesty not to forget my words.\"* Though others recoiled in fear, he stood unmoved. Could such men as these have breached propriety in their turning toward or away?\n\nYet others, like Li Shizhong and Wu Xiaozong, acted otherwise. Li Shizhong’s views had long clashed with those of Duke Jing. When the duke’s power grew, Li sought to curry favor, erecting a pavilion in Shuzhou named *Chuanyan*, alluding to the duke’s past tenure there and his enfeoffment in Shu. Wu Xiaozong, in his initial policy response, vehemently opposed the Xining reforms. But when Duke Jing gained the emperor’s favor, Wu composed *Ten Chapters of Alleyway Discourse*, claiming that even common folk praised the new laws. The duke scorned him. Such breaches of propriety—were these the acts of a gentleman or a petty man?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo act with propriety is called righteousness.\nTo perceive truth clearly, to hold fast without wavering—\nOnce the path of compliance or defiance is chosen,\nFortune and misfortune diverge sharply.\nDo not distance yourself from the wise and virtuous,\nNor draw near to the deceitful and false.\nOnly by following the human Way\nDoes one align with Heaven’s will.\n\n**Oppressing the Lowly to Seize Merit**\n\n**Commentary:**\nA candle in darkness dispels shadows; a boat on water bears its load.\nWhen conditions are ripe, merit arises naturally—\nIt need not be seized.\nTo insist on seizing it is to oppress those below.\nMerit may never be achieved, but calamity will surely strike first.\nThis is what is meant by \"oppressing to seize wealth\" or \"oppressing to exploit labor\"—both are acts of oppression.\n\nConsider the seizure of wealth. Wealth is what all people urgently need. Have you not heard of the cases of Wang Zi and Ma Jiang?\n\nWang Zi, known for his harshness in office, served as an assistant in the Sichuan Transport Bureau during the Shaoxing era. When ordered to inspect the salt wells of Tongchuan, he personally visited each well, compelling the well owners to acknowledge inflated quotas. Those who owed fifty catties were forced to pledge a hundred, ensuring their assets would be confiscated and the salt boiled by the state. Soon after, the well owners were ruined, and Wang died suddenly, reborn as an ox. On the night of his death, his friend Prefect Yang and his household saw Wang come seeking help—his official robe already split by a tail emerging from beneath. The next day, a neighbor’s cow gave birth.\n\nThen there was Ma Jiang, another assistant official, even more ruthless. Whenever he went to collect taxes, he demanded exorbitant sums, heedless of actual quotas or market conditions. If his demands were not met, he would fly into a rage, earning the nickname *Ma the Scraper*—for his habit of scraping money clean. Someone warned him of Wang Zi’s fate, saying, *\"Even if you grew two tails today, you wouldn’t care.\"* Soon after, boils erupted on his left back, then his right, the two sores facing each other like a beaten spine, over an inch deep, exposing his organs. His colleagues visited in shock. Only then did he confess: *\"Let those who scrape money in the future take me as a warning.\"* His flesh wasted away, and only then did he draw his last breath.\n\nOthers, too, met grim fates: Li Zi died childless, Chen Shu’s soldiers perished, Lin Te’s descendants met unnatural ends—all for oppressing those below.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe world has its \"stalwart officials,\"\nUnafraid of imperial decrees.\nThey carve away at the people’s strength\nTo fill their bribe sacks.\nOnce their coffers overflow,\nThey offer \"surplus\" to their superiors.\nHigh ranks are easily enjoyed,\nGrand mansions easily occupied.\nBut what becomes of them and their descendants in the end?\nFlattering the powerful to curry favor.",

      "translated_text": "The *Tradition* states: The sovereign governs the statutes of life, death, sin, and fortune, and none oversee this more than Fengdu. Beneath the Northern Emperor of Fengdu, only the Heavenly Lord of Mystic Nourishment assists the Four Lords, the Six Heavenly Demons, and the minor officials of the Three Palaces of Heaven, Earth, and Water—none of whom reveal their names. Among their subordinates, as recorded in the *Declarations of the Perfected*, are all the loyal and upright of the world. Those above them include the Duke of Shaogong Shi, who became the Duke of Southern Brightness, and Wu Jizha, who became the Duke of Northern Brightness. Those of the next rank include Jia Yi, who served as the Forbidden Gentleman of the Western Brightness, and Zang Hong, who became the Northern Dipper Lord and Heavenly Gate Warden. Still others, like Ji Zhan, who became the Northern Heavenly Gate Keeper, and Wen Qiao, who became the Earl Overseer of the Sea, are also among them. Has there ever been one who curried favor with superiors that was counted among their ranks?\n\nGenerally, in serving a ruler, loyalty is paramount. A single word of flattery is enough to brand one as disloyal. The disloyal are inevitably condemned by Heaven—how can they hope for deliverance?\n\nIn the past, Emperor Gaozong of Tang sought to elevate Lady Wu as empress but hesitated, fearing the dissent of his ministers. One day, he summoned Li Ji, Changsun Wuji, Yu Zhining, and Chu Suiliang to deliberate. Suiliang and the others all opposed the idea, while Li Ji remained silent. Yu Zhining, too, glanced about and said nothing. Days later, the emperor secretly consulted Li Ji again. Had Ji spoken even a single word of remonstrance then, he would have remained loyal, and the Tang might have been spared the disaster that befell its imperial clan. But Ji did otherwise, replying instead that this was the emperor’s private affair, not to be questioned by outsiders. Thus, the emperor’s resolve was set, Lady Wu was enthroned, and the Tang’s imperial house was annihilated.\n\nIn Ji’s heart, he sought only to protect himself, fearing calamity. Yet he failed to see that the self cannot be truly shielded, nor can disaster be truly feared. Soon after his death, his entire clan was exterminated, his tomb desecrated—every misfortune befell him. Who can say that flattering superiors to curry favor brings no disaster?\n\nThere was also Guo Chongtao, who met the same fate. Having risen to high office and seeing his own merits as great, he grew restless and scheming. He petitioned the emperor to establish Empress Liu, intending to secure his own position. Little did he know that the hearts of others are hard to fathom and easily turned against one. In the end, it was Empress Liu who had him killed. Can such flattery of superiors be justified? Can it bring anything but ruin?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFlattering superiors, chasing favor,\nOpening the way to sin.\nSo-called \"pleasing the ruler\"—\nNo crime is greater.\nWhen the ruler’s mind is yet undecided,\nChange may still come.\nA single word of compliance,\nAnd their resolve hardens.\nRuined lives, fallen nations—\nBlame not Heaven.\nIngrates receive kindness yet feel no gratitude.\n\nThe *Tradition* further states: According to the *Dharma Treasury Forest of Gems*, receiving kindness is like sowing grain. Though the seed depends on the earth, without rain, it will not grow. When the grain ripens, one cannot credit only the earth and ignore the grace of rain. As the *Great Perfection of Wisdom Treatise* says, ingratitude is worse than being a beast.\n\nI once read a passage in Liu Zongyuan’s writings that further illustrates how ingratitude is a deed even beasts would not commit. To be human yet fall short of beasts—is that not worse than being a beast?\n\nAt Jianfu Temple, there was a hawk that perched atop the pagoda. One winter’s night, the temple’s bell-ringer caught a bird small enough to hold in his hand. Instead of killing it, he turned it gently in his palms to warm its claws. At dawn, he released it unharmed. After setting it free, he watched it intently as it flew—eastward when it vanished in the west, westward when it vanished in the east—seemingly unwilling to meet his gaze again, lest it be seized once more.\n\nAlas! Hawks are creatures that seize and tear their prey to eat. Yet this one, having had its claws warmed for a single night, acted thus. How can those who receive kindness yet feel no gratitude claim to be anything but worse than beasts?\n\nHow lamentable that those who do not know gratitude are farthest from the Dao. For it is not ingratitude, but gratitude, that brings one closer to the Dao. And if one is grateful, their daily conduct is plain to see.\n\nDuring the Xuanhe era, there was a scholar-official named Xu Wenzhong who once traveled to the Eastern Capital. One of his soldiers was accidentally run over by a cart and left lame, unable to walk. He encountered a Daoist who gave him a small dose of medicine, and soon the soldier walked as before.",

      "translated_text": "The soldier was deeply moved and grateful. He traveled throughout the realm, seeking the Daoist to offer even a modest token of thanks. One day, he encountered him again on the road and wept as he bowed in gratitude. The Daoist said, \"I have bestowed kindness upon many, yet none have been like you.\" Thereupon, he transmitted a secret formula, and the soldier attained the Dao.\n\nWhen Xu Wenzhong heard of this, he visited the soldier to inquire about the Way. The soldier replied, \"Stillness is the Dao; simplicity is supreme.\" Wenzhong was suddenly enlightened, and he too attained the Dao.\n\nWho could claim that one who knows no gratitude may yet attain the Dao? How many in this world are like this soldier?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nIn this world, there are those more cruel than wolves and tigers.\nThey take shelter under another’s wings,\nYet repay with axes and blades.\nSuch men sever all human bonds,\nNeither lord nor father do they acknowledge.\nLike the man who shielded the Duke of Wei beneath the mulberry,\nOr the one who lacquered his body to feign madness—\nTo bear a debt and repay it is one thing,\nBut to cling to resentment without end is another.\nThe giver should not look back,\nYet the aggrieved nurse their grievances ceaselessly.\n\nThe *Record* states: Master Deshan addressed the assembly, saying, \"Even a single thought tied to the dharma becomes the cause of the Three Wretched Realms. A fleeting emotion gives rise to eons of bondage.\" If mere attachment to the dharma can still be such a burden, how much worse is the mind that harbors resentment without cease?\n\nKnow this: the mind that clings to resentment binds itself most tightly, never to be freed, plunging swiftly into the Three Wretched Realms as if shot by an arrow, never hearing the teachings of repentance. Does this not confirm the saying, \"Without enmity, there are no evil destinies\"?\n\nAccording to the sutras: \"When hatred and resentment arise from mutual animosity, at the moment of death—before the body’s warmth has faded—stones will fly, cangues will lock, and cages, jars, and sacks will appear before the dying, ready to crush and confine.\" This is the fate of those who cling to resentment without end: they are bound for hell.\n\nFurther, it is said: \"Greed and hatred are sins. When one’s punishment in hell is complete, they are reborn as venomous creatures, known as poisonous ghosts.\" This is the fate of those who cling to resentment: they fall into the realm of hungry ghosts.\n\nAgain, it is said: \"When the poison of such ghosts is exhausted, they are reborn in the world as venomous beings.\" This is the fate of those who cling to resentment: they fall into the realm of beasts.\n\nThe Buddha’s words are never false. Who could deny this?\n\nYet there are those who, having already fallen into the Three Evil Realms, still do not cease their resentment. Like the bandit of Jizhou, who, after dying for his crimes and falling into hell, still harbored hatred for Prefect Zhang Yi, who had executed him beyond the law. His resentment unceasing, he sought to drag Zhang Yi into hell. Or like the ghost recorded in the *Vibhāṣā Śāstra*, who, having died with accumulated sins and fallen into the realm of hungry ghosts, still resented a woman who had killed him five hundred lifetimes prior. His resentment unceasing, he ultimately took her life in return. Or like the mule in Yang Bao’s stable, which, having died for its evil karma and fallen into the realm of beasts, still harbored resentment toward Wang He, who had once wronged it. Its resentment unceasing, it returned to kill Wang He.\n\nThus, is not the character for \"resentment\" the very thing that binds a person most tightly, ensuring they never attain liberation?\n\nHave you not heard the words of the Thirty-First Ancestor, Great Master Can? The Thirty-Second Ancestor, Great Master Daoxin, once respectfully asked Can, \"I beg the Master’s compassion—grant me liberation.\" Can replied, \"Who binds you?\" Daoxin said, \"No one binds me.\" Can said, \"If no one binds you, why seek liberation?\" At these words, Daoxin awakened and was liberated.\n\nIf these words of Can were widely spread, then those who do not cease would cease, and those who are not liberated would be liberated.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nBoyi and Shuqi bore no grudges,\nTheir hearts set on seeking benevolence.\nWhen others failed to return courtesy,\nMencius turned inward to reflect.\nWith empathy and principle, all things flourish in spring.\nYet Xi Ke remembered a slight,\nAnd bones lay strewn between neighboring states.\nA single thought of resentment\nIs the root of ten thousand evils.\n\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Eight—Concluded\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Nine",

When the river flooded, the people of eight prefectures fled entirely into the eastern capital region. Lord Fu urged the people to donate grain, amassing over 100,000 *hu*, which he stored in various locations to succor the starving. He also requisitioned over 100,000 vacant public and private dwellings, dispersing the refugees among them to ensure access to firewood and water. The following year, when the wheat ripened, he calculated the distance each household had traveled and provided them with grain for their return, saving over 500,000 lives.\n\nTeng Zhangmin, Yuanfa, served as Prefect of Yunzhou. When famine struck Huainan and the eastern capital region, he repaired over 1,200 abandoned barracks outside the city to house refugees, saving 50,000 lives.\n\nLi Yunze served as Prefect of Tanzhou. When famine struck, he requested to open the granaries for relief before submitting his memorial, but the Transport Commission refused. Li said, \"If we wait for approval before acting, how can we address the crisis in time?\" Thus, he pledged his family fortune as collateral to distribute grain, saving 50,000 lives.\n\nChen Dahui, Yaozuo, served as Prefect of Shouzhou.

The generals in command, seeking only their own safety, dared not even slightly blunt the enemy’s edge. At the time, Li Juzheng, a minor official, was pressing for tax collection in a garrison town. Enraged by the raiders’ brutality, he rallied the townspeople, recruited able-bodied men, and struck back with all his might. Pursuing them deep into their lair, he recovered the women and children they had seized and returned them to their families. Though those in power admired his courage, not one would recommend him for reward—only Zhang Yongding secretly memorialized the throne. When the memorial reached the emperor, he was overjoyed and immediately promoted Juzheng several ranks, summoning him to serve as Gentleman of the Palace Gate. Juzheng, unaware of the source of his favor, was later told of Yongding’s role. He hastened to visit him, but try as he might, he could not secure an audience. He then bribed the gatekeeper to deliver a calling card, yet Yongding still refused to appear, merely writing at the bottom of the card: 'In wealth, you were generous; in battle, brave; in affairs, diligent; toward the people, kind. Add to this your prudence and reverence—these are the great proofs of service to the state. To decline a private meeting is but a small matter.' Juzheng received this with greater joy than if he had met him in person. He cherished and carried it with him always. Juzheng’s reward may indeed be called righteous.\n\nShi Ji served as military commissioner of Yanzhou. During the Kangding era, Tangut raiders attacked Yongping Fort in Yanzhou. The fort commander and the supervising officer both wished to withdraw their troops into the deep mountains and wait for the raiders to leave before returning. Ji led several hundred of his men to block the city gate, halting before their horses, and demanded: 'Where do you intend to go, Commander and Supervisor?' The two answered truthfully. Ji said: 'If you do this, the troops will be preserved, but what of the people in the city? Where will they take their grain and fodder? How can you conceal your tracks? One day, the authorities will impeach you. As military commissioner, I would not escape execution—so let me be beheaded before your horses first. Otherwise, I will not lead these troops to follow you.' Ashamed and fearful, the two turned their reins and returned. Suddenly, the raiders surrounded the city, and Ji again led his men in defense. After several days, the raiders withdrew, and the fort commander and supervisor were both promoted for preserving the city. Were their rewards not unrighteous?\n\nAlas! Though Ji himself did not receive a reward, he later rose to the rank of brigade commander, all three of his sons were appointed to office, and one daughter married Guo Kui, becoming a commandery lady. This was far better than the two men’s unrighteous promotion by a single rank.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nTo gain high rank through unrighteousness—\nthis is a warning the Sage left us.\"",

To reward bandits is to encourage treachery; how then can the state enforce its decrees? When titles are bestowed upon the wicked and the virtueless, it is a profanation of Heaven’s Mandate. Thus did the Grand Steward instruct the king in the Eight Powers: punishment must reach the innocent.\n\nAs the tradition states: 'Punishment exists to chastise evil.' Yet when no evil exists and punishment is still meted out, this is what the Most High calls innocence. Whispers among men are heard in Heaven like thunder. If the innocent cry out to Heaven, will Heaven not hear?\n\nIn Caizhou there lived a man named Qian Ju, who falsely accused his younger brother of being of another surname and concealing over two hundred thousand in family wealth, refusing to divide it equally. The officials before and after all accepted Ju’s bribes and rendered unjust verdicts. Only the witness Zhu Xijie maintained a consistent account throughout, refusing to curry favor or submit. Later, when Xu Yi, the Vice Prefect of Xuzhou, was dispatched to Caizhou to establish a prison and investigate the case at its root, Yi again acted with recklessness. Manipulated by the interrogator Yang Zhonghe, he instead had Zhu Xijie sentenced to thirteen strokes of the heavy rod on the buttocks.\n\nFrom that time on, Yi’s every action was obstructed in review and went unapproved. Hearing that at the Tianqing Abbey there was a Daoist named Pei Junsou skilled in memorializing the throne, he prepared incense and offerings and went to the abbey to perform three successive jiao rites, praying for auspicious favor. At first, Junsou prostrated himself to submit the petition and immediately fell into a snoring slumber. The next day, he rose like a dragon and said:\n\n'I arrived at the Gate of Heaven and saw the Great Emperor of the North Pole leading the True Lord of the Hall of Blessing and Judgment of Good and Evil, the Perfected Warrior, to present a memorial. They stated: \"The Vice Prefect in Caizhou was wrong to unjustly sentence the witness Zhu Xijie to thirteen strokes of the heavy rod on the buttocks.\" Then, glaring fiercely, they commanded: \"Xu Yi’s petition is to be kept here. Should the Register of the Golden Script demand an accounting, your response must not err, or you will not be permitted to return.\" I then hastened back—such is the matter.'\"",

Though Ji himself did not receive a reward, he later rose to the rank of brigade commander, all three of his sons were appointed to office, and one daughter married Guo Kui, becoming a commandery lady. This was far better than the two men’s unrighteous promotion by a single rank.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nTo gain high rank through unrighteousness—\nthis is a warning the Sage left us.\"",

The muleteer fled in secret, and with no one to intervene, the matter was brought before the authorities. At that time, Wen Zhongshu was serving as the magistrate of Kaifeng.

      "translated_text": "Should the offense be minor, pardon it; where guilt is doubtful, impose the lightest penalty. Such was the Sage’s intent: that punishment should aim to eliminate punishment itself. How much more then should the innocent be met with compassion? Yet when the prison gates swing open, the roots are torn up and the measuring lines drawn taut. With wrongful cages overflowing, can one not be sternly chastised?\n\nTo kill a man for his wealth—\nAs the saying goes: \"Bandits force their victims into peril; physicians exploit their patients’ vulnerability. Both kill for gain, and in this their crimes are one and the same.\"\n\nLet us speak of physicians, that the sick may not fall prey to poisonous hands.\nTo disregard urgency and demand exorbitant fees is to kill.\nTo insist on payment regardless of means is to kill.\nTo be lazy or drowsy, treating life with contempt, is to kill.\nTo diagnose carelessly and prescribe mistakenly is to kill.\nTo delay treatment until the illness worsens is to kill.\nThese five failings, when coupled with medical skill, make the physician’s killing more heinous than wielding a blade. Beneath the blade, if the strike misses vital points, life may yet be spared; but beneath the bowl, when the five organs are ruined, is there any hope of survival?\n\nLong ago, Yan Ji sought treatment for illness and lost his life. Later, he revived, his breath faint and indistinct, neither dead nor alive, for thirteen years. Chen Jingren’s wife, Zhang-shi, suffered a minor ailment; the physician mistakenly administered a blood-separating drug, and she did not rise again. After death, the underworld refused her, her soul adrift and scattered. Wherever she wandered, she was driven away by the local earth gods, enduring unbearable suffering. One day, as Jingren traveled beyond the city, he chanced upon her. Their essences merged, and from then on, Jingren grew disoriented, singing and muttering to himself. At that time, his father was serving in the capital when the imperial envoy Qin Zhongli passed through his post. Zhongli, a devotee of Zhenwu, reported the matter to the Northern Dipper. Moved by the unjust death, Zhenwu, the Perfected Lord, immediately granted rebirth without passing through the underworld. Who can say physicians do not kill?\n\nAlas, they know not that medicine is a craft where ascent and descent come swiftest. In a past life, the Venerable Bakkula offered a single harītakī fruit to a sick monk. By this merit, for ninety kalpas he was born in heaven and among men, never falling ill. In his final life, he met the Buddha, left the household, and attained arhatship, becoming the foremost among five hundred. Wang Sou made his living with acupuncture, never counting his fees, and his treatments were often effective. One day, he told the assembly: \"Next summer, I cannot remain.\" When the time came, he departed, and the place where he lived was filled with fragrance for months. Liu Jin also practiced medicine, tireless in his labor, and his cures were many. On the day of his burial, only an empty coffin was interred. These physicians, by applying their hearts with goodness, swiftly attained liberation from the world.\n\nIn our dynasty, Ding Fengji was skilled in medicine; his son Du and a second son both passed the imperial examinations, rising to the rank of Grand Scholar of the Hall of Literary Glory. Zhang Zhonghe applied the methods of Zhang Zhongjing to treat cold damage disorders. His two sons, Qi and Zhao, both succeeded in the examinations. Zhang Xingfu also practiced medicine; his descendants have governed great provinces and held high office for generations. These too are physicians who, by applying their hearts with goodness, ensured the flourishing of their posterity.\n\nThe Bodhisattva Sincere Appearance once visited a hell where a sinner endured molten iron poured over his body and iron nails driven into his flesh. Bowing, he asked what crime had led to this. The Buddha replied: \"In a past life, this man was an acupuncturist who recklessly applied needles, and thus he receives this retribution.\"\n\nThe Venerable Maudgalyāyana, leaving the city one morning, saw a hungry ghost weeping. It said: \"This body of mine is like a lump of flesh, without hands, feet, eyes, ears, or nose. Birds and insects have long fed upon it. What crime brought this upon me?\" Maudgalyāyana replied: \"In a past life, you practiced medicine without mastering your craft, recklessly administering drugs, causing patients to die. This is your retribution.\"\n\nThe divine nun Hui Pu of Caizhou was once sitting with guests when two oxen were led past the hall. The nun said: \"The ox leading the way was once an official who condemned an innocent man. The one following was a physician who killed in error.\" She called out their past-life names, and both oxen responded. These too are physicians who, by failing to apply their hearts with goodness, fell into the three evil destinies.\n\nAlas! The deeds of good and ill are fully recorded above. Whether to follow or defy them—you must choose for yourself.\n\nIn praise, it is said:",

      "translated_text": "One day, a Daoist priest appeared—his hat torn, his robe threadbare, his beard bristling like a boar’s tusks, his grin stretching from ear to ear. He announced himself as the abbot of Fengdu Temple and presented a calling card, saying: \"Yesterday, a decree arrived from the Celestial Court. Twenty thousand barbarian souls have been sent here, but this temple dares not yet enter them into the register of the dead. If you, sir, truly insist on slaughtering them, your name will resound through the ages, but you will forfeit ten years of your lifespan. Choose between the two.\" The general dismissed him as a madman and drove him away.\n\nShortly after, the Khitans led their troops to hunt at Liangmen. A sudden snowstorm rendered their bows useless. Recalling the thousands of bow and crossbow materials stored in his armory, Wang Xian ordered craftsmen to work through the night, shaping them into weapons. Seizing the enemy’s unpreparedness, he unleashed his troops, routing the Khitan forces. The next day, he erected a mound of the slain and counted exactly twenty thousand heads. Only then did he grasp the Daoist’s warning—too late to undo what was done.\n\nWhen the victory was reported to the court, the emperor rejoiced and summoned him to the Bureau of Military Affairs. Yet Wang Xian left Dingzhou only thirteen days later—and died. Alas! These were souls fated for death, yet even for them, his insistence on slaughter cost him his years. How much graver, then, the sin of executing those who have already surrendered and submitted?\n\nWhen Cai Juhou governed Yunzhou, five hundred bandits from Liangshan Marsh came to surrender. He had them all executed. The following year, while serving as Vice Minister of War on a ritual mission to Jinling, a carbuncle erupted on his back. He ordered Daoist priests to perform a grand offering to atone, instructing his confidant Wang Gong to compose the prayer on his behalf. The next day, Cai Juhou died; the day after, Wang Gong followed.\n\nLater, Wang Gong’s spirit returned, saying: \"When I arrived in the underworld, the magistrate rebuked me: ‘You, a scholar, dared to falsely compose a prayer, deceiving the Celestial Court!’ I replied, ‘It was Cai Juhou’s intent; I merely wrote the words.’ Soon, several ghosts dragged Cai out, his neck shackled in a chain of cangues, his body emaciated to the bone. Then two more ghosts appeared, holding a bucket of blood. They poured it over his head, and with each dousing, he shrieked in agony, thrashing as if on the verge of death. When he revived, they poured again; when he fainted, they revived him—repeating this four times in quick succession. From afar, he called to me: ‘Go back and tell my wife to save me at once! Here, I am only being made to account for the Yunzhou affair.’\"\n\nCan the execution of the surrendered and submissive ever be justified?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe penal code debates punishments,\nYet even homicide in battle is deemed light.\nTo repel foes and take heads—this is called *just warfare*.\nWhen no other course remains, the unseen realm may pardon the act.\nBut for those who have surrendered—why resort to arms or law?\nTo kill the bound and helpless—heaven’s way is ever watchful.\n\nThe *Annals* say: \"Only with a Bo Le does the thousand-mile steed appear.\"\nYet thousand-mile steeds are ever present—Bo Le is not.\nSo too with men of talent: their fortunes depend on encountering the right patron.\nIf those in power were like Bo Le,\nThen men of virtue and capacity could become prime ministers;\nThose who grasp the greater good could guard the realm;\nMen of strategy could command armies;\nThose skilled in pacification could govern frontiers;\nMen of resolve could oversee surveillance;\nThe incorruptible could manage finances;\nAnd those who cherish the people could serve as prefects and magistrates.\nThus, every office, great or small, would be filled by the right man,\nNo talent left untapped, and all affairs would flourish.\n\nYet the truly upright and worthy must be given authority,\nSo that the court may be well-staffed, officials within and without may stand in awe,\nAnd none dare entertain reckless ambitions.\nHow could such men be demoted or sidelined?\nTo push them aside is to remove obstacles—clearing the way for one’s desires.\n\nThus, those who delight in discerning and promoting talent\nAre ever embraced by the Highest Dao, never overlooked.\nBut those who recklessly demote or exclude others\nAre ever met with the Highest Dao’s stern retribution.\n\nLong ago, Han Chong lifted Yuan An from a mere scribe to the rank of Minister over the Masses.\nAll praised Chong for his discernment, likening him to a radiant light in darkest night.\nYuan An’s upright worth was thus plain to see,\nAnd Chong, too, was recognized by the Highest Dao for this.\nHe was commanded by the immortal official Wang Weixuan to transmit the *Mud-Pill and Purple Portal* method,\nAnd so attained transcendence, ascending to Fengdu,\nWhere he now serves as Left Supervisor of the Registry of Determined Transcendents,\nOverseeing those who first embark on the Daoist path.\n\nIn our dynasty, the Remonstrance Grand Master Xie Bi was most discerning,\nNever offering praise lightly.\nIn his lifetime, he recommended only a few men—all of whom became prime ministers.",

Taking an earthly courier’s horn-sealed packet, he dispatched a direct talisman to deliver it to the vice-prefectural office of his home prefecture. When the letter arrived, it could not be opened; only after his wife was summoned did it unfold. Within, he recounted in full his encounter with the True Lord and repeatedly urged her: “Above all, raise our orphaned children and safeguard our household.” Alas! Even those who have already attained liberation from the world remain so deeply attached—how much more so those who have not? Here, indeed, lies the root of ancestral grievances. If this were not the case, why would the Most High have established the Register of Petitions, urging people to submit memorials seeking absolution?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe orphaned and widowed, without refuge—\nKing Wen always placed them first.\nYet even with benevolent governance,\ntheir plight may still not be fully redressed.\nAlas for our single lineage,\nbrothers fallen into ruin.\nHow could one bear such cruelty,\nbereaving those who depend on them?\nFor such a person,\nretribution will surely follow.\nDiscarding the law to accept bribes—\n\nThe *Scripture* states: The Most High declared: “Of all matters of right and wrong, weight and lightness, why begin with discarding the law to accept bribes?” Because to discard the law is necessarily to accept bribes; once bribes enter, right is made wrong and wrong is made right—all else is disregarded. How pitiful that they do not know: for every law and statute, the spirits and gods are ever aware. To discard the law and accept bribes is to invite the stripping of rank and emolument.\n\nLong ago, when Fan Zhiquality was yet obscure, he sat in a teahouse in Fengqiu, idly inscribing a fan with the lines:\n*“In the scorching heat, the cruel official departs;\nthe cool breeze brings an old friend.”*\nSuddenly, a grotesque stranger stepped forward and bowed, saying: “The suffering of those wronged by cruel officials is far worse than the scorching heat. One day, you must thoroughly investigate this abuse.” With that, he took the fan and left. Fan was left bewildered for a long while. Days later, passing a temple, he saw a clay-and-wood statue of a ghost at the gate—its appearance strikingly like the man he had met—and the fan was in its hand. Greatly astonished, when Fan later rose to high office, he first proposed revising the overly broad and baseless laws, where officials exploited loopholes for malfeasance. The Zhou Ancestor thus commanded him to compile and standardize them, creating the *Criminal Statutes*. Who can say the spirits and gods do not oversee all?\n\nWhen Hou Jian served as magistrate of Jiangxia, he had long been acquainted with Abbot Juyue of Shengyuan Mountain. Whenever he found leisure, he would visit the abbot, and upon arrival, the monastery would always have prepared for his reception. One day, he came again, only to be received with unusual neglect. Startled, Hou questioned the abbot, who replied: “Whenever you visit, the local earth god always reports in advance, saying, ‘The Minister is coming.’ This time, he did not report, so we failed to prepare.” Hou was deeply alarmed and secretly instructed the abbot to ask the earth god why he had not reported. That night, the abbot dreamed that the earth god said: “Hou Jian was destined to become a grand councilor, and as such, he fell under my jurisdiction, which is why I always reported his coming. Recently, however, he accepted sixty taels of silver from the Hu family and wrongly decided a case. The Heavenly Bureau has already stricken his name from the register of grand councilors, leaving him only the post of provincial inspector. Since he no longer falls under my jurisdiction, I no longer report his visits.” If this is so, can it be said that his rank and emolument were not diminished?

      "translated_text": "In former times, Wang Changyu, originally a judicial officer in Tongchuan, never dared to abandon the law or accept bribes. In the end, the Supreme Emperor took him into his register, and he ascended to heaven in broad daylight, becoming the Perfected of Preserving Harmony. Wang Laozi, originally a judicial officer in Pu Prefecture, likewise never dared to abandon the law or accept bribes. He eventually encountered Master Zhongli, who transmitted to him the essentials of the Dao, enabling him to foreknow fortune and misfortune. During the Huizong Emperor’s reign, he was summoned to court and granted the title \"Master of Penetrating the Subtle.\" Alas! With such a heart, how could one not unite with the Dao above? If even petty officials can do this, how can scholar-officials fail to do so?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nRefusing the horses of Lu, his avoidance of summons is still recalled.\nTrembling before the \"four who know,\" he escaped entanglement.\nWhen material desires shift, emotions and conduct must change.\nIf bribes are accepted, even Tang the Completer would shun them.\nThose who wish to uphold the law must shun even the appearance of melons and plums.\nTo twist the straight into the crooked...\n\nIt is recorded: When Lu Chong knew of the descent of the Perfected Lord of Assisting Sageliness in Fengxiang, he arranged a ritual and inquired about the essentials of conducting oneself and acting in the world. The Perfected Lord said: \"Exert yourself in serving your lord, do not covet ill-gotten wealth, do not meddle in improper affairs, rectify and redress judicial cases, succor and heal the people. If your actions accord with the kingly Dao, you will naturally be a fortunate person. Accumulated transgressions become calamities, and one will surely sink into ruin. How then can those who hold judicial office fail to devote themselves wholeheartedly to rectifying and redressing wrongs? How dare they twist the straight into the crooked? Let me speak of one or two great elders, that all may know and emulate them.\n\nIn the past, when Lord Han of Wei governed Daming, litigation in Wei was most numerous. Matters great and small, he personally adjudicated all. Even when ill, he allowed reports to reach him and decided cases from his sickbed. Some, deeming his toil excessive, urged him to delegate to his subordinates. He said: 'When two parties are in litigation before the court, it is a matter of great consequence for the people. Life or death, bestowal or deprivation—all hinge on my single word. How can I treat this lightly?' After his death, he became a Perfected of the Purple Bureau.\n\nOuyang Wenzhong, the great Confucian of his time, whenever he conversed with guests, never spoke of literature but only of governance. Zhang Shunmin, finding this strange, asked him why. He replied: 'Literature merely adorns the self, but governance can reach others.' When I was demoted to Yiling in my prime, still unsatisfied with my learning, I wished to read the *Records of the Grand Historian* and the *Book of Han*. Neither public nor private collections had them, so I took the archived case files of bygone years and perused them one by one. Among them, right and wrong were often confused: what was not became what was, the crooked was made straight, laws were violated for personal favor, kinship was severed, and moral teachings were harmed—nothing was not present. I often sighed with joy, saying: 'Even in a small and remote place like Yiling, things are like this. The state of the realm can well be imagined.' Thereupon, I swore to Heaven: 'From now on, in all matters, I will be even more diligent and careful, never daring to be the least bit negligent.' To this day, over thirty years later, whether serving within the court or beyond, I have humbly held the three offices, conducting myself by this principle. Others may esteem me as a master of literature and governance, but in my own view, this is merely the reward for the oath I made in those days.\" After his death, he became the Transcendent Official of Divine Clarity.\n\nIf those who twist the straight into the crooked meet such ends after death, what fate awaits them?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWalking the straight path, impartial and unaligned—\nThis is the good person, worthy of esteem and reward.\nTo slander them as crooked is to punish what should be praised.\nWhat crime have the good committed to suffer such wrong?\nAfter executing Wang Chang, where could Hong and Xian flee?\n\nTo twist the crooked into the straight...\n\nIt is recorded: Some cases are straight yet cannot prove themselves so; some principles are crooked yet their crookedness is not self-evident. This is why litigation is so contentious, awaiting officials to decide. Those who serve as officials must be impartial in heart. If they analyze even a single word, then the crooked and the straight will all become as clear as melting ice. Even if the case is tangled, it will surely be resolved as if splitting bamboo. How then could there be the error of twisting the crooked into the straight? Those who do so are simply unable to be impartial, and must be yielding to influence.\n\nIn former times, Lord Liu of Yizhou Prefecture, when first serving as the constable of Lianjiang, encountered a case where villagers had disputed over fields for ten years without resolution. The prefecture entrusted it to him, and he uncovered the deceit, immediately rendering a decision. Right and wrong were thus distinguished. People called him divine, but he was not divine—he was merely impartial in heart. When he left office, the party who had been in the right waited for him in Jian Prefecture. Drawing him aside, he said: 'I have some fine incense, a few catties, as a small gift to honor you.' When opened, it was gold. Lord Liu laughed and declined, saying: 'Your case was just; I did not favor you privately. How dare I accept a private bribe for public duty?' He firmly refused, and all at the time admired him. Later, his two sons, Yuanfu and Gongfu, both gained renown for their literary talents. Who can say that serving in office with an impartial heart brings no reward?\n\nThere was also Liu Anmin, originally a clerk in Danleng County. He maintained a fair and upright heart, long respected by both officials and people. When villagers had disputes, they did not immediately go to the county court but first sought him out, laying out the right and wrong, asking whether to proceed. Only then would they act. He also took pride in this, accepting their requests without refusal. If a case was just, he affirmed its justice, saying: 'The principle is straight; it can proceed.' If it was crooked, he forthrightly enumerated its faults, saying: 'This is crooked; it does not accord with the law. Proceeding will surely lead to error.' As a result, litigation in the county sharply decreased. Later, his two sons both passed the imperial examinations in succession. The elder, Ji, rose to the rank of Grand Master for Palace Attendance. The younger, Shi, became Gentleman for Court Discussion, Rectifier of the Imperial Archives, and Judicial Intendant of Zizhou Circuit. One daughter married Yang Jun and also held office. To this day, they have become a prominent family. Who can say that a clerk’s impartial heart brings no reward?\n\nIn general, whether crooked or straight, all receive blessings;\nBut those who twist the straight into the crooked or the crooked into the straight all incur misfortune.\nBeware!",

The Heavenly Bureau has already stricken his name from the register of grand councilors, leaving him only the post of provincial inspector.

How pitiful that he did not know: had he not discarded the law, he would have attained liberation from the world.",

Whenever he sentenced a prisoner to death, he would first burn incense and memorialize Heaven before issuing the decree. One evening as he sat in his chambers, he suddenly saw a divine being in a cloud-patterned cap and crimson robes, holding several scrolls of official documents. Beside him stood a jade maiden in long robes and wide sleeves, holding a corner of an official document. They stood beneath the eaves and called out to Jin from afar: \"These are the cases you have memorialized in your life—each one accords with principle and law, without any injustice or excess. The August Emperor commends you and has already extended your father’s lifespan by twelve years, while doubling your own blessings for the same span. Your two grandsons will also one day serve as circuit intendants—strive even harder.\" With these words, they vanished.\n\nLi Guixiang also held a judicial post and was long known for his integrity and prudence. One evening, as he passed over Sanjing Bridge, he suddenly saw a dozen or so people crying out in grievance and protest, approaching in twos and threes until they pressed close. Guixiang was greatly alarmed; he wheeled his horse around and galloped home, where he collapsed in exhaustion.

There was a magistrate of Liyang County named Yu Shaoqing, imprisoned on charges that did not warrant death, yet Yu condemned him to execution. On the day the sentence was carried out, all deemed it a grievous wrong. From that moment, whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, Yu saw Shaoqing following him relentlessly, never leaving his thoughts, never granting him peace. In desperation, he journeyed to Mount Lu to seek the Nine Heavens Investigating Commissioner, where he arranged a three-day Yellow Altar ritual to atone for his deed. At the first night watch, he already saw Shaoqing at his side, filling him with dread. The next morning, he submitted another written confession, and just as he bowed in submission, he was suddenly seized by several ghosts, hurled before the altar steps, his body drenched in blood. After some time, he died.\n\nWhen Li Ruoshui served as Judicial Commissioner of Huainan, five bandits were captured and imprisoned after a failed robbery. They claimed to have conspired with a monk named Zicheng. Though the five were soon executed, the monk was only then being pursued. The monk protested his innocence, insisting he had never been a thief. Ruoshui could have shown leniency in this matter, yet he stubbornly upheld the bandits’ testimony as truth. That night, he had the monk’s mouth and nose sealed with damp paper, then pressed a sack of earth upon him. In an instant, the monk’s belly split open, and he died.\n\nA month later, the prison officer Li Neng suddenly cried out for no reason: “The monk had nothing to do with me—it was the Judicial Commissioner who forced me to do this!” With those words, he collapsed and died.

When the other monk went, the gardener happily sold to him, even consoling him: “Are you parched from the heat?” After selling one melon, he gave another. The two monks privately marveled and asked Zhigong about it. Zhigong said: “Five hundred lifetimes ago, the gardener was executed for a crime, and you two happened to be nearby. The one who succeeded in buying the melon had once pitied him, and so now rejoices at the sight of him. The one who failed to buy had once spoken words of ‘self-made, self-received,’ and so now meets him with anger.

When he was appointed Minister of Military Affairs, his rewards and gifts grew even more lavish, and his guests and visitors gathered to admire, none failing to praise him.

At the time, his venerable mother was already advanced in years, her heart heavy with worry. One day, Master Cundao visited his post and admonished him with a poem:\n\n*The sagely lord’s grace runs deep, selecting you for high office;*\n*Your kind mother’s years are long, her hair like the crane’s white plumes.*\n*Neither the sovereign’s favor nor a mother’s kindness have you repaid—*\n*If drink becomes a sickness, what regret could ever suffice?*\n\nUpon receiving the poem, he was deeply ashamed. From then on, he abstained from wine, drinking only with close kin and old friends, and never again became drunk in his lifetime.\n\nWhen Sima Wengong was but five years old, he tried to peel a green walnut but could not remove its skin.

      "translated_text": "His father rebuked him from the side, saying: \"How dare you, child, speak falsehoods!\" From that moment, Wengong took heed and never again dared utter a lie throughout his life, treating all with utmost sincerity.\n\nWhen Xu Jiexiao first met Master Anding, his head carriage was slightly tilted. Anding said in a stern voice: \"The carriage of the head must be upright.\" Wengong immediately understood: \"If the carriage of the head must be upright, how can the heart be allowed the slightest crookedness?\" From then on, he never once allowed his heart to deviate, and whenever asked about the essentials of conducting oneself in the world, he would invariably write the two large characters \"uprightness\" and \"integrity\" to instruct them.\n\nWere these gentlemen—when faced with their faults—men of understanding who refused to change?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe eclipse of sun and moon,\nonce passed, shines brighter still.\nWho among men is without fault?\nBut to correct it with sincerity—\nthis is what matters.\nTo craft excuses, to cloak deceit,\nto conceal one’s true feelings,\nto pile fault upon fault—\nhow can the heart of goodness ever arise?\nNot to begrudge a single word,\nbut to act with all one’s strength—\nthis is what is noble.\nTo know the good and not do it...\n\nAs the *True Person of Responding to the World* said: \"To take the small is how one achieves the great; to accumulate the one is how one completes the myriad.\" The *Book of Changes* states: \"Auspicious blessings must return to those who accumulate goodness.\" Generally speaking, goodness demands accumulation. What one knows must be done, and what one does must be done with all one’s strength. It is like planting a seed: though at first it is exceedingly small, with watering and nurturing, though its growth is not immediately seen, in time it will become great. One must understand that in the course of daily life, one must never regard small acts of goodness as without benefit and thus fail to perform them.\n\nHave you not heard the words of the Primordial Lord? The Primordial Lord said: \"When a person has one good deed, the heart is settled and the body at ease; with ten good deeds, the qi and strength are robust; with twenty, all illnesses vanish; with thirty, all that is sought is obtained; with forty, one flourishes in wealth and joy; with fifty, descendants multiply; with sixty, one escapes calamity; with seventy, heavenly spirits protect one; with eighty, one gains the advantages of the earth; with ninety, one is honored and renowned among the worthy; with one hundred, treasured omens descend; with two hundred, one’s name spreads through later generations; with three hundred, later generations become greatly prosperous; with four hundred, later generations attain purity and nobility; with five hundred, later generations enjoy long life; with six hundred, later generations are loyal and filial; with seven hundred, later generations are wise; with eight hundred, later generations embody virtue and power; with nine hundred, later generations become worthy sages; with one thousand, later generations become divine immortals; with two thousand, one becomes a teacher of the multitude, a sage, a perfected immortal, a general or an official; with three thousand, one becomes a national teacher, a sage, a perfected immortal, a general or a scribe; with four thousand, one becomes a teacher of the world, a sage, a perfected immortal who governs the host; with five thousand, one becomes a teacher of the spirits, a sage, a perfected immortal and marshal; with six thousand, one becomes a teacher of the divine luminaries, a sage, a perfected immortal and minister; with seven thousand, one becomes a teacher of the various heavens, a sage, a perfected immortal and high official; with eight thousand, one becomes a teacher of the Three Heavens, a sage, a perfected immortal emperor; with nine thousand, one becomes one of the Five Lords of the Primordial Beginning; with ten thousand, one becomes the Supreme Jade Emperor.\"\n\nThus, the ancients, in matters of goodness, knew without fail what must be done and did it without fail with all their strength. Formerly, Chancellor Li Fang once said to others: \"Of the phrase in the *Analects*—'to be frugal and love the people, to employ the people at the proper time'—I have practiced it all my life and still have not fully attained it. This is what it means to strive with all one’s strength.\" Academician Yang Yingzhi, upon hearing a single good word, would invariably write it down and remember it—this is what it means to know without fail what must be done. Jia An, the Hanlin Academician, having passed the imperial examinations as *zhuangyuan*, said that what he gained from [Fan] Wenzheng was the two words \"never deceive,\" which he used throughout his life without exhaustion—this is what it means never to deceive. Liu Anshi, the Grand Censor, renowned for his forthright speech, said that what he gained from Wengong was the two words \"utmost sincerity,\" which he practiced throughout his life without the slightest deviation—this is what it means to be without fail sincere.\n\nIf every person were like these gentlemen, then to accumulate the one and complete the myriad—what difficulty would there be?\n\nIn praise it is said:",

Unable to contain her rage, Chang seized the opportunity while Chunqing was away and bludgeoned Chunnu to death with a heavy staff. Later, when Chunqing died, Chang remarried a man named Cheng Xuan. As she was about to give birth, the labor lasted three days, and the child could not be delivered. In her exhaustion, she suddenly saw Chunnu standing before her. Terrified, Chang pleaded gently, saying, \"I truly had no intention of killing you at first. The beating went too far, and it cost you your life. Could you not show me some leniency?\" Chunnu replied, \"My death was indeed at my mistress’s hands. How could you falsely implicate another?\" She pressed harder, and Chang ultimately did not survive.\n\nThus, can one truly escape by blaming oneself and citing others? Once you know you are at fault, why not refrain from the deed altogether?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nCalamity is self-made, and its consequences are self-inflicted.\nWith deep remorse and repentance, perhaps it may yet be redeemed.\nTo ignore one’s own faults and instead implicate others—\nEven if one evades the snares of guilt, Heaven cannot be deceived.\nSharing blame and accepting wrongdoing is the foundation of turning toward goodness.\n**Obstructing the arts and techniques.**\n\nAs the saying goes: \"So-called arts and techniques\" refer to all who wield skills to seek gain. A single word of discouragement, preventing them from succeeding, is obstruction.\n\nIn Baisha Village at Guankou, there stood a Temple of Mount Tai of extraordinary efficacy, where vegetarian offerings and sacrifices were made nearly every day. One day, a group of physicians and diviners traveled together and encountered an extremely poor man on the road, whom they greatly disdained. Enraged, the man threw himself into the river. Moments later, he emerged holding a dragon and said to the group, \"Each of you practices medicine or divination to relieve others’ suffering in times of urgency—all are close to the Dao. Henceforth, toward those of humble means, you must never harbor duplicity in your hearts.\"\n\nAlas! Though medicine and divination are mere arts, the divine and the wise call them \"close to the Dao\"—can they be obstructed? Have you not heard the words of the Dragon Maiden of Yun’an? Long ago, when Zhai Qianyou was alive, he was renowned for his mastery of summoning and invocation. He noted that in the single district of Yun’an, the Yangtze’s currents were perilous in fifteen places. One day, he performed a ritual to summon the rapids’ spirits and command them to be pacified. That night, fourteen rapids answered his call. Only one failed to appear. The Heavenly Master grew furious and insisted on summoning it. When it finally arrived, it was a woman, wearing a towering headdress and voluminous sleeves, who approached and declared resolutely, \"The Heavenly Master carries out Heaven’s transformations—how dare I, a mere water spirit, defy you?

Along this stretch of the river live three or four hundred humble folk, with no fields to till, no silk to weave—entirely dependent on hauling and porterage for their livelihood. If all the rapids were smoothed, it would indeed benefit the boats, but what would become of those small folk and their sustenance? The Most High’s intent would surely never permit such an outcome. I fear that in time, the blame would fall upon me, and I would be burdened with guilt—this matter must be reconsidered.”\n\nThe Heavenly Master sighed and said, “Your concern is beyond what I had considered.” Thereupon, he commanded the spirits of the fourteen rapids to restore their former dangers. That night, wind and rain roared, thunder crashed, and lightning struck.

Observing that the people of Wu were fond of Buddhist rites, he summoned the abbots of the temples and instructed them that with grain expensive and labor cheap, construction should proceed everywhere. The government, too, launched major works, repairing granaries, government offices, and the like.

Alas, the worthy and sagely are distant indeed—yet to slander their writings is to slander them.\n\nNow, among the scriptures of the Buddha, many are destroyed. Why? Simply because they speak of emptiness. It is a pity that their critics do not understand that the nature of the Tathāgata is like empty space, and the nature of empty space is the Tathāgata. Perfect in true purity and clarity, wondrously empty and spiritually penetrating, that which abides in true purity and clarity, wondrous emptiness and spiritual penetration—this is the Tathāgata. To dwell all day in true purity and clarity, wondrous emptiness and spiritual penetration, yet never truly be pure, clear, empty, or spiritually penetrating—this is the ordinary person.\n\nIf one can empty all that exists, leaving it utterly bare, exposed, and pure as empty space, then true purity and clarity, wondrous emptiness and spiritual penetration will manifest clearly, and one will become one body with the Tathāgata, without distinction. Who could say this is not so? Have you not heard the saying of Elder Pang: \"Only desire to empty all that exists; do not desire to substantiate what does not exist\"? Elder Pang in a former life was Vimalakīrti; Vimalakīrti in a former life was the Tathāgata Golden Grain.

A physician surnamed Zhu frequented the households of both gentlemen and had long wished to find an opportune moment to exhort Duke Qi, yet without success.\n\nOne day, the Duke fell ill and summoned Zhu. Zhu, however, was in the midst of reading the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* and did not go at once. When he finally arrived, the Duke flew into a rage, demanding, \"What manner of book is this *Śūraṅgama*? I know only of Confucius and Mencius!\" Zhu drew the first scroll from his sleeve and presented it to him. The Duke read it through, then demanded the remaining scrolls one after another, until—unawares—he had finished all ten fascicles. Sighing deeply, he exclaimed, \"Truly, this is a wondrous text!\" Thereupon, he dragged Zhu with him to call upon Wending, reproaching him for not having revealed it sooner. Wending merely smiled and said, \"It is like losing something and then finding it—what need is there to question why it was found so late?\"\n\nFrom that day forth, the Duke seemed to have gained profound insight and placed great faith in the teachings. There was also Xu Xuan, a renowned scholar who had never before encountered Buddhist scriptures. The Middle Lord bestowed upon him a copy of the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*, saying, \"Read it thoroughly, and you will perceive its subtle principles.\" After more than ten days, Xu submitted a memorial, stating, \"I have read it several times over, yet it is as though pouring from one vessel into another—utterly incomprehensible.\" The Middle Lord merely smiled at him.\n\nAlas! Duke Qi, with but a single glance, devoured all ten fascicles, while Xu Xuan, after more than ten days, could not grasp even a single word—is this not a matter of differing capacities?\n\nThe eulogy says:\nMen often speak of shielding their ailments and shunning physicians.\nThe sagely and worthy set forth teachings that cut to the heart of a hundred wrongs,\nYet those who cannot practice them proceed to slander and ridicule.\nChen Jia criticized Dan, and Shusun defamed Ni—\nWords issuing from the mouths of mere youths—why do they not reflect?\nSuch is the way they assail and undermine the Dao and virtue.",

      "translated_text": "The tradition states: According to the sutras, in ancient times, the youth Sudhana, in his cultivation of the bodhisattva path, diligently sought all bodhisattva teachings. He visited fifty-three great kalyāṇa-mittas, and only then did he attain enlightenment. These kalyāṇa-mittas are great guides—with but a single word, they can shatter the bottom of a lacquer barrel. The benefit they confer is by no means small. What is called the Dao and virtue resides in such persons, and this is not unique to Buddhism or Daoism. Since antiquity, renowned figures have never failed to rely on great kalyāṇa-mittas, who through grinding refinement and stirring encouragement enabled them to shine with brilliance and be celebrated through the ages. Examples include Zhang Liang with the Yellow Stone Elder, Zhuge Liang with Pang Degong, Li Jing with the Curly-Bearded Elder, Yan Zhenqing with Zhang Zhihe, Li Taibai with He Zhizhang, and Du Shaoling with Sima Ziwei. If this is so, can the Dao and virtue be of no benefit to people? Can they be assailed and undermined?\n\nIn the past, when Yin Gong Shilu was demoted to serve in Daliang, he associated with the monk Fayan Chan Master. One day, he said to Fayan, \"Of late, I have come to value withdrawal and tranquility as the highest attainment.\" Fayan replied, \"Why not forget both withdrawal and tranquility? Then you will gain insight, and at the moment of life and death, you will remain clear and undisturbed.\" The military commissioner’s judicial officer, Zhu Yan, had long studied Haiyan’s teachings but had yet to grasp their essence. One day, he asked the lecture monk Yijiang, \"When this body dies, where does this mind go?\" Yijiang replied, \"Before this body dies, where is this mind?\" Zhu immediately attained sudden clarity and was able to fully comprehend the meaning of the entire sutra. Minister Zeng Kai had long admired Chan but had found no resonance. One day, he visited Yuanwu and sought resolution. Yuanwu took out two cases from the *Gong’an* of Yunmen and Zhaozhou—\"Mount Sumeru\" and \"Set It Down\"—and showed them to him. Zeng immediately experienced a breakthrough, and all his lifelong doubts were dispelled. Ouyang Wenzhong did not believe in Buddhism or Daoism, but when he governed the district of Bo, he heard of the reclusive master Xu Changling of Later Tang and invited him to the prefectural residence. They spoke together daily, and with each exchange, he felt a sense of joy and attainment. If this is so, can the Dao and virtue be of no benefit to people?\n\nThe eulogy says:",

As the *Zhao Lun* states: \"Heaven and Earth share the same root with me; the myriad things are one body with me\"—this is no empty speech. The difference between birds and humans lies solely in their karmic fortune and the form of their bodily shells.\n\nI have examined the records and found that some have fallen from humanity into such forms, while others—immortals—have played among them. Liu Anmin was once a wealthy man who pursued empty fame without true attainment of the Dao. After death, he became a phoenix, and after sixty years, he regained human form. In this life, he diligently cultivated the Dao and finally achieved liberation through *shijie*, now residing in the Qinghua Palace. Huang Anshi was once a scholar who longed for transcendence but lacked single-minded devotion. After death, he became a wild goose, and after ninety years, he regained human form. In this life, he advanced in cultivation and finally ascended, now dwelling in the Joyous Heaven of Huangzeng—are these not cases of humans falling into the realm of birds?\n\nOn the ornamental pillars of Liaodong, a crane once alighted. When someone tried to shoot it, the crane spoke: *\"There is a bird, there is a bird—Ding Lingwei. / A thousand years away from home, now I return. / Though the city walls remain, the people are gone. / Why not learn the Dao? Graves lie heaped in rows.\"* Emperor Ming of Tang once shot a crane in Shayuan. Though struck, it spread its wings and flew straight toward the southwest. The following year, when the emperor fled to Shu and visited the Bright Moon Abbey, he saw the arrow lodged in the wall. When he asked where it came from, the Daoist assembly said: \"On the Double Ninth last year, the Daoist Xu Zuoqing of Qingcheng brought it here and left it behind.\" Only then did he realize the crane was none other than Zuoqing—was this not an immortal playing among them?\n\nThe eulogy says:",

      "translated_text": "In the age of the Great Dao, men harbored no intent to kill. The nests of crows and magpies could be peered into from above. Once the mind of cunning arose, even gulls took flight. Hawks possess loyalty, and crows are called compassionate. Why then are men so unkind, making sport of the hunt and chasing down prey?\n\nThe tradition states: The foregoing has briefly set forth the words of the Most High; now let the teachings of the Buddha serve as proof. The Buddha said: All sentient beings are fundamentally pure. Yet from deluded perceptions, deluded habits arise. From deluded habits, the cycle of birth and death continues. Birth follows habitual tendencies; death follows the flux of change. Those of pure thought ascend, surely reborn in heaven. When thought and emotion are balanced, they neither ascend nor fall, reborn again among men. Clarity of thought brings wisdom; obscurity of emotion brings dullness. When emotion outweighs thought, they flow into errant births—heavily as furred beasts, lightly as feathered flocks. Generally, the seven destinies of rebirth remain inescapable for those who have not entered true cultivation.\n\nThose now born as other kinds were surely once human in past lives; those now human were not necessarily other kinds before. Thus the Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and perfected ones of the Great Dao constantly instruct men to recognize the perilous threshold of birth and death as most fearsome. Have you not heard how the arhat Mātṛceṭa in a past life was a macaque, or how Kālodāyin was once reborn as an ox? Have you not heard that Zhou Xun and Cai Junmo were both serpent spirits? According to the *Dongzhai Record*, when Zhou Xun governed Anzhou, one day while strolling in his garden, the gardener saw a great serpent resting its head upon the railing. Looking closer, it was Zhou Xun in a light slumber. Cai Junmo, governing Fuzhou, fell ill and ceased attending to affairs. Each night, he dreamed of wandering atop the drum tower, leaning upon the drum to sleep. The vice-prefect reproached the drum officer for failing to strike the third watch, who replied that a great serpent coiled upon the drum, making it impossible to approach. When Junmo recovered, he recounted his dreams to the vice-prefect, finding them identical to the drum officer’s account. If the seven destinies of rebirth remain inescapable for those who have not entered true cultivation, how can one avoid them?\n\nKnow this: those now chased may one day chase others. To escape the cycle of rebirth and avoid being pursued, when you see others hunted, you must strive to save them. Once, the Prince of Hejian suffered a long illness with no hope of recovery. Suddenly, a Daoist named Xuan Su arrived at his gate, offering to heal him. After administering a knife-tip of medicine, the prince vomited over a dozen small serpents, and his illness was cured. Astonished, the prince asked the reason. Xuan Su replied: \"This is the lingering misfortune from six generations past. I am not human. In a former life, you saved a doe, who was in truth the mother of a qilin. Your kindness moved heaven and earth, so the Supreme Emperor sent me down to heal you.\" If one sees others hunted, can one fail to save them?\n\nLi Ying and Li Yan once chased a deer, binding its four legs and hanging it from a tree branch. They first took its organs to roast, preparing to eat. Suddenly, a giant, nearly ten feet tall, appeared, carrying a massive sack. Striding forward, he nearly reached them. Then, gathering all the roasted meat, he placed it in his sack and departed into the mountains. Soon after, both Ying and Yan died suddenly. If one sees prey running, can one truly chase it?\n\nThe eulogy says:",

All living beings possess awareness, and their principles are not distant. How can one bear to fill the cauldron with their flesh, savoring their fat and richness? Tigers and rhinoceroses may be escaped, but the snares set by humans are inescapable. The awakening of hibernating creatures—\n\nThe *Records* state: As the *Monthly Ordinances* says: \"In the second month of autumn, thunder begins to withdraw its voice, and hibernating insects seal their doors. In the third month of autumn, hibernating insects crouch within, all plastering their doors. In the second month of spring, thunder resounds, and they open their doors to emerge.\" *Zhe* means \"to hide.\" *Huai* means \"to enlarge\"—enlarging their doors slightly. *(Jin)* means \"to plaster,\" covering their doors entirely. One hibernation, one emergence—all correspond to the qi and seasons, completing their transformations. If this is so, can one truly disturb their hibernation?\n\nThus, the Supreme Writ warns humanity, and the Buddhas especially emphasize protection. Long ago, the monk Huijue once crossed a stream to build a Mañjuśrī Hall, intending to lay planks by the water’s edge. He thought: \"It is winter, and all creatures are hibernating. One must not lightly harm their lives.\" Thereupon, he held a three-day ritual by the stream, vowing that on the day of construction, whether creatures had one foot, many feet, or no feet, they might all be sheltered and kept far away. When the time came to dig to the spring and even after the bridge was completed, not a single ant was seen.\n\nAgain, in the Song era, an elder’s father fell ill, and he prayed before the Medicine Master Hall at Yongzuo Temple. After his father recovered, he prepared incense and offerings, intending to hold a ritual in the hall to repay the divine favor. The temple monk Yizhao said: \"Beneath the Medicine Master’s seat in this hall, there is a swarm of bees that has dwelled for many years, with many kinds among them. Now is their hibernation season. If disturbed, many may be harmed or killed. Would it not be better to move to another hall?\" The elder did not heed him. The monk then prayed in advance before the Buddha, saying: \"On the day of the feast, may the divine power of compassion shield those within the hive, allowing them to temporarily feed on old honey without leaving their doors. May those outside the hive remain undisturbed, unstartled by any commotion.\" When the day arrived, lamps and candles blazed, and the clamor of cymbals and conches filled the air. For a day and two nights, not a single bee was seen.\n\nAlas! Though this was the power of these two men’s vows, it was also the protective power of the sages. Who could say otherwise?",

      "translated_text": "The *Tradition* records: The bodhisattva Sincere Form addressed the Buddha, saying, “There are sentient beings who have no children, living alone and desolate. What karmic transgression has brought this upon them?” The Buddha replied, “In a former life, such a person was cruel and wicked, disbelieving in sin and fortune. They captured fledglings and devoured eggs, causing all flying birds to lose their young, their cries of grief so piercing that blood flowed from their eyes. This is their retribution.”\n\nThe Buddha spoke thus, and the Supreme Lord’s *Chapter on Protecting Offspring* says the same. Then can eggs truly be broken?\n\nAccording to the *Vibhāṣā Śāstra*, as sentient beings cycle through rebirth, some become egg-born. Consciousness dwells within, bound and enveloped by the egg, until the hatchling pecks its way free. The karmic weight of this is self-evident.\n\nIt is also said: Cranes, geese, mandarin ducks, peacocks, parrots, mynas, *qianqiu* birds, and *Golden-Winged* birds—whether dragons or humans—are all egg-born. I once doubted this, thinking, “Birds are indeed egg-born, but how could humans also emerge from eggs?” Yet upon learning of the tales of Kāśyapa, Gavāṃpati, and King Xu Yan, I came to know that humans born from eggs do exist.\n\nLong ago, in the land of Kuadi, a merchant ventured into the sea to gather treasures. He obtained two cormorants—one died, the other lived—and they transformed at will, their feathers resembling those of a crane. Soon, they laid two eggs. When the eggs hatched, two boys emerged, who later left the household life and attained arhatship. One was named the Venerable Kāśyapa, the other the Venerable Gavāṃpati.\n\nAccording to the *Gazetteer of Xuzhou*, in ancient times, a palace woman of the Lord of Xu conceived and gave birth to an egg. When the egg broke, a child was born. He grew to be benevolent and wise, inheriting the throne of Xu. Because he was born in a reclining position, he was named King Yan.\n\nWho can say there are no egg-born humans?\n\nWhen Zhi Dun was young, he once debated with his teacher about the nature of living things. Dun argued, “Before an egg hatches, killing it does not count as taking life.” His teacher, unable to refute him, took an egg and cast it to the ground. The shell broke, and a chick emerged, only to perish soon after—its spirit and consciousness extinguished. Dun was deeply moved and thereafter ate only vegetables.\n\nLi Daonian was fond of eating chicken eggs. In his later years, he fell gravely ill. Magistrate Chu Cheng fed him perilla juice, and he immediately vomited thirteen objects. When cut open, they were found to be fully formed chicken feathers, wings, claws, and spurs—all capable of flight. Daonian was terrified and never dared eat eggs again.\n\nThen can eggs truly be broken?\n\nI have often reflected that among egg-born creatures, none produce as many eggs as fish. The largest lay thousands, the smallest no fewer than hundreds. To kill a single fish is to destroy countless eggs—how can one even begin to describe the magnitude?\n\nLi Chongyuan once intended to kill a catfish. The night before, he dreamed of a woman in black who pleaded, “In my belly are five thousand children. If I live, they live. If I die, they die. I beg for your mercy—spare my life.” Chongyuan released the fish.\n\nDuring the Xuanhe era, the wealthy merchant Yang Xu dreamed that a deity told him, “You will die in ten days. If you can save a hundred million lives, you may yet be spared.” Xu replied, “The appointed time is near, and the lives of creatures are limited. How can I possibly reach such a number?” The deity said, “The Buddhist scriptures state: Fish eggs, if not dried and salted for three years, can still revive. Why not act on this?” Xu then inscribed the deity’s words on the walls of the main thoroughfare. From then on, people took heed—whenever they saw someone killing fish, they would retrieve the eggs and cast them into the river. After a month, Xu dreamed again of the deity, who said, “The hundred million lives have been saved, and your lifespan may now be extended.” And so it came to pass.\n\nIn general, if we can save the lives of creatures in their moment of peril, our own lives will not fail to be prolonged when death draws near.",

Then, with wife and children weighing on the heart and household affairs on the mind—whether holding office, where official duties swarm, or pursuing profit, where market ways are petty—unaware and unknowing, the great term suddenly arrives.

      "translated_text": "Guo Congyi was garrisoning Heyang and built a grand estate in Luoyang, comprising over a thousand rooms. All were constructed of fragrant cypress, even the beams made of figured catalpa. The floors were paved with patterned stone, ponds dug and waters channeled in, hills raised and fruit trees planted. Mills and grindstones were installed throughout, and stables, storehouses, pavilions, and towers—nothing was lacking. The estate’s completion required five thousand *ding* of silver.\n\nThe following year, Guo was summoned back to the capital. Arriving at dusk, he took up a candle to survey his estate but had not yet seen it all when the time came for court assembly, allowing no delay. After dining and resting briefly, he departed before dawn. Having attended court and returned, he died upon reaching the Eastern Capital, never again setting foot in his estate. His family could not bear to live there and offered it to the court, which bestowed it upon the Prince of Fu. When the Prince of Fu was exiled to Fuzhou, the estate at Fangling became an abandoned hall.\n\nChen Gonggong, in Runzhou, built a grand estate of equal magnificence. Pavilions, terraces, ponds, and gardens stretched for several hundred paces. Upon its completion, Gonggong had already fallen ill and could only be carried in a sedan chair to ascend the western tower before he, too, soon died. People named his estate the \"Three Impossibles\": *unable to reside, unable to maintain, unable to sell*.\n\nLooking back on the days of planning and building—was it not all a dream? From this, one sees ever more clearly that what enriches others diminishes oneself, and what enriches oneself only diminishes. Have you not heard the saying of the Most High: *\"Some are diminished yet enriched; some are enriched yet diminished\"*?\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*Enriching the lowly, diminishing the high,*\n*The people rejoice without end.*\n*Impoverishing others to enrich oneself—*\n*Such a principle cannot endure.*\n*The hexagrams bear no blame,*\n*For humility is noble and radiant.*\n*Waxing and waning, ebb and flow,*\n*Each in turn restrains and uplifts.*\n*Those who seek to enrich themselves*\n*Rarely avoid ruin.*\n*Exchanging good for evil—*\n\n**Record:**\n*\"This body of mine—ears hear, eyes see, body senses, mind knows—clearly exists.\"*\nYet according to the Buddha’s teaching, earth, water, fire, and wind—four conditions combined in illusion—falsely give rise to the six senses. If the four great elements disperse, where would this illusory body of mine reside?\n\n*\"This mind of mine—doing good, doing evil, manifest in daily life—clearly exists.\"*\nYet according to the Buddha’s teaching, the four great elements and six senses, inner and outer, combine to form the illusion of conditioned *qi*, accumulating within. A semblance of conditioned appearance arises, falsely named the mind. Knowing this truth, one seeks awakening beyond illusion.\n\nYet according to the Buddha’s teaching, to speak of awakening in dependence on illusion is still to speak of illusion. To assert the existence of awakening is still not to depart from illusion. To assert its non-existence is likewise. Thus, this body, this mind, and even the seeker of awakening—all are named illusion. How much more so external things—what among them is not illusion? Why, then, falsely distinguish good and evil within them?\n\nVihevahu said:\n*Borrowing the four great elements to form a body,*\n*The mind, originally unborn, arises with conditions.*\n*If prior conditions vanish, the mind too vanishes—*\n*Karma and merit, like illusions, arise and perish.*\n\nThe Fourth Patriarch said:\n*Conditions bear no beauty or ugliness;*\n*Beauty and ugliness arise from the mind.*\n*If the mind does not cling to names,*\n*From where do deluded thoughts arise?*\n\nThe Brahmin Hei once employed spiritual power, holding in each palm a blossoming parasol tree to offer to the Buddha. The Buddha said, *\"Put it down.\"* The Brahmin put down the flower in his left hand. The Buddha said again, *\"Put it down.\"* The Brahmin put down the flower in his right hand. The Buddha said once more, *\"Put it down.\"* The Brahmin replied, *\"World-Honored One, I held only two flowers and have already put them both down. Now I stand empty-handed—what more would you have me put down?\"* The Buddha said, *\"I do not ask you to relinquish the flowers. I ask you to put down the six external dusts, the six internal roots, and the six consciousnesses in between. If you can relinquish all three, with nothing left to relinquish, that is where you escape birth and death.\"* The Brahmin suddenly attained great liberation.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Dezong of Tang, Wu Yuanqing served as the Six Palace Attendant. When the flowers of Luoyang were in full bloom, Yuanqing grew deeply attached to them. Suddenly, a voice from the void said, *\"Illusory forms, blooming and fading without cease—how can they corrupt good roots? Why cling to them?\"* Yuanqing suddenly attained liberation.\n\nThus, Wang Wenzheng disdained thousand-*jin* jade belts, and Lü Wenmu rejected mirrors that could illuminate two hundred *li*—they understood this truth. How could one who exchanges good for evil be told such things? Even if they remain unenlightened by Buddhist scriptures, why not reflect on the Confucian teaching *\"What you do not desire, do not impose upon others\"* and awaken thereby?\n\nWhen Wang Dan was chief minister, someone presented a jade belt through his younger brother, saying, *\"This belt is exquisite.\"* Wang replied, *\"If I wear it myself, bearing its weight, and others say it is fine—is that not wearisome?\"* Thus, throughout his life, he wore only the belt bestowed upon him.\n\nWhen Lü Wenjing was chief minister, his son-in-law sought to sell an ancient mirror, saying, *\"This mirror can illuminate two hundred *li* beyond.\"* Lü replied, *\"My face is no larger than a plate—why would I need to see two hundred *li*?\"*\n\n**Eulogy:**\n*Zilu’s coarse hemp, disdaining fox-fur.*\n*Alchemizing copper into gold—Lü Dongbin scorned the craft.*\n*Simplicity in poverty and lowliness—*\n*The noble man delights in such things.*\n*Purple usurps vermilion,*\n*Zheng music disrupts proper harmony.*\n*The cunning of thieves and burglars*\n*Never stoop in shame.*\n*To abandon the public for the private—*\n\n**Record:**\n*\"Forget the state for the sake of the family, forget the self for the sake of the lord, forget the private for the sake of the public—such is the duty of a minister.\"* How can one abandon the public for the private? If one does so, right may be twisted into wrong, the worthy into the unworthy, and the affairs of state will swiftly fall into chaos. Thus, the noble man dares not act thus.\n\nMinister Zhao Kangjing, in his early years, served in the Hanlin Academy alongside Ouyang Wenzhong. Kangjing was grave and reticent, and Wenzhong somewhat slighted him. Later, when Wenzhong was implicated in a scandal involving his nephew’s misconduct, the emperor’s wrath was severe, and the case pressed urgently.

Generally speaking, the scent-dust exists as it is; it is only through my nasal faculty that the perception of smell arises, distinguishing it as fragrance. Yet according to the Buddha’s teaching, this is already called theft.\n\nKnow then that to seize another’s abilities and claim them as one’s own is true theft.\n\nConsider the case of Gao Ling: in his later years, though he held the post of Libationer, his Dao and qi failed to commune, and his spirit lacked a master. Thus, a host of malevolent forces assailed him, hastening his misfortune. The Perfected Lord of Life Protection said to Director Xu: “Gao Ling’s lack of virtue has endured for long; the entanglements of ghostly litigation have accumulated. Moreover, he once defaced the steles and inscriptions of ancients, passing them off as his own work. The Water Official condemned him for obscuring goodness to aggrandize himself, secretly injuring spirits and deities.

Years after his death, he appeared in a dream to his friend Guan Yong, saying: “In my lifetime, I composed many poems, but of all of them, I took greatest pride in *Substituting Yangping for Intent*—its words and meaning were profound and beautiful. Yet though the world praises it, only you can ensure this poem spreads widely.” Guan awoke with the lines of *Hidden Measures of the Daoist Adept* and *The Immortal’s Invitation* expanding in his mind, and he set them to song. Later, he dreamed again, and Manqing came to express his gratitude.\n\nAlas! Even for a poem left uncelebrated, one must plead for its recognition—how much worse, then, to steal another’s ability and claim it as one’s own?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nSeeing the worthy, one strives to emulate;\nSeeing the sagely, one follows their path.\nWhen myriad virtues are complete,\nIt lies in man to seek them within.\nTo think oneself inferior to Shun\nIs cause for self-reproach.\nHow can one of sheep-like nature\nBear the guise of a mighty beast?\nTo deceive others is to deceive oneself—\nA shame most profound.\nTo obscure another’s goodness…\n\nAs the saying goes: Since ancient times, those whose skills won them fame in later ages never did so without relying on others. Consider Yuan Ying of the Prince of Teng’s mastery of butterfly painting, Madam Gongsun’s sword dance, Cao Gang’s pipa, or Mi Jiarong’s singing—these were but incidental mentions in palace lyrics or verses by Tang poets. Yet even the slightest talent is a form of goodness. To leave it unrecognized is to suppress it.\n\nHave you not heard of the affair of Lord Xu, the Perfected Duke? In his mortal days, Xu the Perfected once renovated a Daoist abbey and wished to record the event. Chancing upon an ancient stele whose inscription had worn away, he scraped off the old text and engraved his own account. Thereafter, he grew restless and unsettled. One day, as he strolled through the courtyard, he suddenly heard a voice from the void: “Lord Xu, Lord Xu, hasten to the Water Official to seek deliverance! Else, unforeseen calamity may befall you.” Startled, Xu lit incense and prayed devoutly, wishing to learn the reason for his peril. After a long while, the voice spoke again: “Though the old stele’s text was effaced, its original author has lodged a complaint with the Water Official, accusing you of usurping his name to exalt your own. Thus, the Water Official is preparing to summon you for judgment—you must act swiftly.” Xu then sought out the original inscription and had it carved anew on a separate stone. That night, he dreamed of a spirit who thanked him, saying: “Since you have restored my name, I can offer no repayment but to request a grand Water and Land Ritual, proclaiming it to the myriad spirits, that the Three Officials may record your merit and aid your attainment of the Dao.” Xu followed the instructions, and later indeed achieved the Way.\n\nWhen Caizhou was pacified, Emperor Xianzong ordered Daoists to perform a ritual at the Purple Ultimate Abbey. The abbey had once been a shrine to Wu Shaocheng, but Pei the Duke of Jin had repurposed it as a Daoist sanctuary. On the day of the ritual, a great thunderclap resounded. The stele bearing Han Hong’s *Inscription on the Pacification of Huaixi* had originally been Wu Shaocheng’s *Stele of Virtuous Governance*. That day, it wept beads of sweat that turned to mud. Within ten days, an imperial envoy arrived to grind away Han’s inscription on the pacification of Huai and restore Shaocheng’s text on virtuous governance. Such transformations, though glimpsed in dreams, are not without consequence.\n\nAlas! If even the written word is thus, how much more so for goodness greater than mere text?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe sin of suppressing the worthy\nIs called inauspicious.\nTrace it to its origin—\nEnvy of another’s excellence.\nJade glistens within wood,\nPearls gleam in the night.\nAll things possess inherent worth,\nYet how can they be concealed?\nTo stifle ability and bury goodness\nIs to seek obscurity yet achieve renown.\nTo expose another’s shame…\n\nAs the saying goes: “Shame” refers to the shame of ugliness; “expose” means to lay bare. Consider Nie Chongyi’s love of mockery or Zhang Qiyi’s talent for slander. Chongyi, though skilled in poetry, delighted in ridicule, sparing not even colleagues. Ultimately, he was exiled to Dengzhou for slandering governance, his corpse left by the roadside, unclaimed by any who passed. Zhang Qiyi, also a poet fond of mockery, would expose others’ misdeeds in verse, ensuring their infamy spread unchecked. Some of his accusations were exaggerated, even to the point of breaking marriages and severing bonds. In the end, he contracted a loathsome illness and died chewing his own tongue.\n\nCan one’s shame truly be exposed?\n\nOne would do well to heed the tale of Huangkeng, for had they heard it, they would surely take warning. A military officer named Duan Gou once passed through Huangkeng. His attendant, walking ahead of the horse, picked up several pounds of skull fragments. Among them was a piece bearing faint traces of the words “runaway slave”—the ink had seeped into the bone. That night, the attendant dreamed of a man covering his face with his hands, pleading for the bones: “I am deeply ashamed. I beg you, bury them deeply where no one may see. I will repay your kindness.” The attendant awoke in alarm and immediately interred the remains. When he later passed through Huangkeng again, he dreamed of the same man, who said: “In gratitude for your mercy, a few steps from here lies buried treasure—let it be my thanks.” Following the instructions, he dug and uncovered wealth worth over ten thousand coins.\n\nThus, to expose another’s shame—who can say what retribution may come in days to come?\n\n**Eulogy:**",
      "overlap_context": "o Ling’s lack of virtue has endured for long; the entanglements of ghostly litigation have accumulated. Moreover, he once defaced the steles and inscriptions of ancients, passing them off as his own work. The Water Official condemned him for obscuring goodness to aggrandize himself, secretly injuring spirits and deities. Thus, his case was placed at the forefront of the docket to be reported—his guilt was inescapable.” Soon after, he indeed perished.\n\nCan the abilities of others truly be stolen?",

      "translated_text": "A beauty like Wang Zhaojun was misrepresented by a painter’s error—how much more so when it comes to profit! To surpass even the crimson emaciation of a consumptive: such is the art of depiction, refined through meticulous imitation. Once the crowd has clamored and spread the tale, it can never be washed clean. With but a few words of mine, I plunge another into grave wrong. To expose another’s secrets—Confucius said: “To expose is not merely to depict; it is to attack outright,” as did men like Lü Jifu.\n\nWhen Zeng Zixuan served as Minister of Revenue, Lü Jifu succeeded him and immediately petitioned the throne, claiming the ministry’s affairs were incomplete or improperly managed. When Zhang Cuiming held the same post, Shu Dan replaced him and, having gathered all the clerks, declared the ministry’s business unresolved. Zhou Shihou, as Transport Commissioner of Hubei, entrusted several dozen bottles of tribute wine to the Salt Supervisor Zhang Shangying for sale. Shangying reported this to Inspector Pu Zongmeng, who impeached Zhou, leading to his demotion. Later, when Zhang Shangying held a court appointment, he asked Examination Supervisor Shu Dan to recommend a candidate. Dan submitted a memorial denouncing Shangying’s negligence, and Shangying was likewise stripped of office. Did they not know Confucius’ disciple Zigong’s warning that those who expose others’ faults under the guise of honesty are detestable? Would a man of profound virtue ever act thus?\n\nWhen Han Weigong Qi served as Chancellor, whenever he encountered documents attacking another’s hidden faults, he would personally seal them to prevent others from seeing. Chen Zhongsuxuan Guan, while serving as a censor, spoke out on every matter, yet his impeachments never touched on personal affairs. Prime Minister Su Fan, during his tenure in Hangzhou, was approached by an influential figure with a private request, which he refused. Later, when that man became a censor, he unleashed a torrent of slander against Su. Advisors urged Su to present the original letters of solicitation as evidence, but he only smiled and said: “To expose another’s secrets—would I ever do such a thing?”\n\nMagistrate Hu Suxiao governed Runzhou. His predecessor, Governor Teng, had vigorously promoted education, spending millions of cash. Before the project was completed, Teng was dismissed, and petty officials began spreading slander, accusing him of misusing funds. From the vice-magistrate downward, none would sign the accounts. Hu addressed them in assembly: “Gentlemen, how long have you served under Governor Teng? If there were any impropriety, why did you not speak up sooner, instead of silently observing and only now recording it after his departure? Is this honorable?” The entire assembly hung their heads in shame and signed the ledgers. To act with such magnanimity is as distant from pettiness as heaven is from earth.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo expose differs from forthrightness—even the sages despised it.\nIt is treacherous and cunning, striking at flaws when opportunity arises.\nSwearing oaths to heaven, laughing and clasping hands in feigned friendship—\nYet when slight harm touches them, they turn and bare their fangs.\nNeither rhinoceros nor tiger, what manner of man is this?\nTo deplete another’s wealth—Confucius said: “To drain another’s wealth, leaving their household ruined and their descendants destitute—is this not a grievous sin?”\n\nConsider the case of Wen Qi. He wandered among the nobles of Shu, peddling his alchemical arts. All who took an interest in the furnace and flame were deceived by him. A wealthy merchant named Li the Fifteenth had amassed a fortune of ten thousand strings of cash. Enamored of Qi’s sorcery, within three years his wealth was utterly exhausted. The knowing laughed at him, and in despair, he hanged himself. Qi then fled, renting a house in Jianzhou where he forged elixirs. Soon, a fire broke out, engulfing an entire ward. Qi fled in panic, losing himself in the forest, where he was pursued by wild beasts. Deeper into the ravine he stumbled, only to be followed again. As dawn broke, he was captured by hunters. The case was tried, and he was beheaded at the site of his alchemical work, to appease the residents. If another’s wealth may not be depleted, may one’s own wealth be squandered?\n\nLet me recount another tale, that young men may take heed. Wang Zude died in Qinzhou in the yichou year of the Shaoxing reign. One evening, his wife and son were sitting in the hall when they dimly perceived Zude returning from outside. He reproached them: “I hear the family plans to sell the estate—how can you part with our ancestral home?” He continued: “The treasures of my lifetime—Huang Quan’s and Guo Xi’s landscapes, Li Cheng’s wintry forests—ten scrolls in all. I hear they too have been taken out for appraisal. I have been dead but a short time, and the family is not yet impoverished. Why such haste?” He sighed: “I long for home, yet have no way to return. By chance, it is the Ghost Festival, and I was able to come briefly. If you do not change your ways, I will bring disaster upon you.” His wife, terrified, abandoned the idea of selling. From this, we see: whether another’s wealth or one’s own, neither may be wasted.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe drought demon starves the poor; the poverty ghost resents the rich.\nAs omens and calamities, their logic defies reason.\nHuman nature is most noble—kin, clan, and friends.\nWhat heart could envy what others possess?\nLord Liu loved wealth, yet enriched his people.\nTo sunder another’s flesh and blood—Confucius said: “Flesh and blood are bound by kinship, the great human relationships. How can they be severed?”\n\nHave you not heard the tale of Zhang Songshan? Long ago, Zhang Xiaoji was the son-in-law of a wealthy man from the same commandery. The rich man had only one son, who committed a minor offense. The household, united in resentment, drove him out. Soon after, the rich man fell ill. On his deathbed, he entrusted all his wealth to Xiaoji. Years later, Xiaoji encountered the rich man’s son begging by the road. He called him over and asked: “Can you tend a garden?” The son replied: “To be fed and sheltered would be my greatest fortune.” Later, when the son had proven himself, Xiaoji asked: “Can you manage the accounts?” The son answered: “To tend a garden was already my good fortune—if I could manage the accounts, it would be even more so.” Thus, Xiaoji entrusted him with the ledgers. Over time, the son grew ever more diligent and respectful, his former faults erased. Xiaoji reflected: “He is truly his father’s son. How can I profit from his wealth alone, letting this noble deed pass unfulfilled?”",

      "translated_text": "Thus, Xiaoji returned all the family wealth to the son. At the time, none who heard of it failed to praise and marvel, deeming it unheard of since ancient days. After Xiaoji’s death, several of his friends traveled to Mount Song. Along the way, they encountered a nobleman, his banners filling the fields, his retinue of attendants and outriders streaming in procession—like a regional governor newly assuming office. Glancing at the occupant of the grand carriage, they saw it was Xiaoji. They stepped forward to bow and asked how he had come to attain such a state. Xiaoji replied: “It was because of the matter of returning the wealth.” Before he could finish speaking, he suddenly vanished.\n\nAlas! How many sons-in-law in the world are like Xiaoji? How many others in his place would have done the same? Long ago in Hangzhou, there was a scholar who also married into a wealthy family. When the rich man fell ill and neared death, mindful that his son was only three years old, he entrusted his son-in-law with his assets and left a will stating: “When the time comes to divide the property, give three-tenths to my son and seven-tenths to my son-in-law.” When the son grew up, he took the matter to court. At the time, Zhang Zhongding was the prefect. After reading the will, he poured a libation of wine upon the ground and said: “Your father-in-law was truly a wise man. Because his son was young, he devised this plan to ensure you would diligently raise and protect him. Had he not done so, your hands would not have spared the child’s life.” He then ordered that seven-tenths go to the son and three-tenths to the son-in-law. Both departed in tears, expressing their gratitude.\n\nAh! If one were to compare this son-in-law to Xiaoji of Mount Song, the very ground beneath Mount Song would already lie far beyond the heavens—how could he not become an immortal? If one were to seek such a man among others, even this son-in-law, though humbled, still understood righteousness. How much better is he than those who are cruel, unfeeling, and unworthy of trust? Yet his aspiration to Mount Song remains as distant as the sky.\n\nIn praise it is said:",

      "translated_text": "Of old, there was the Great Ancestor who ordered the ranks of ancestral temples. The teachings of the Zhou classics also united the clan. Later generations gathered in righteousness, valuing kinship and harmony. Even a sage like the Duke of Zhou was slandered by the two uncles. The venomous tongues of flatterers wrought bitter poison.\n\n*End of Scroll Fourteen of the Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response*\n*Scroll Fifteen of the Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response*\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nTo encroach upon what others cherish.\n\nIt is said: When the Perfected Lord Xu was in the world, he once exterminated a serpent spirit in Nanchang. His Daoist companions who wished to follow him numbered no fewer than a thousand. The Perfected Lord selected only three hundred whom he knew well and set out with them. Later, they lodged for the night at the foot of a mountain. Fearing that their cultivation lacked strength, he took three hundred lumps of charcoal from the fire and transformed them into three hundred beauties to test them. At dawn, when he examined them, only Wu Meng and Shi Daoyi had no charcoal stains on their robes. The remaining two hundred and ninety-eight had all embraced the charcoal. At the moment of embrace, did they not each see a beautiful woman? How could they have known it was merely a lump of charcoal? For the most part, their desires had not yet been severed, and so they were easily deceived—how much more so for those who do not cultivate at all?\n\nIn former times, Tao Gu was sent as an envoy to Jiangnan. Though his bearing was lofty and his demeanor stern, even in casual conversation, he never relaxed his guard. Han Xizai said to his confidant: “I observe that this man is no true gentleman. His resolve can be broken. I shall make the court laugh at him.” He then selected a famous courtesan, Qin Ruolan, dressed her in ragged clothes, and had her pretend to be the daughter of a courier station attendant. Morning and night, she swept the courtyard with a broom. Ruolan was of unmatched beauty, and Tao was moved by her. He abandoned his vigilance in solitude and composed several *Youting* poems, which he had Ruolan sing. A few days later, the King of Li held a grand feast and poured wine for the envoy from a massive goblet. Tao remained as stern and unyielding as before. Then Ruolan was brought out to sing the poems he had gifted her as entertainment. Tao was deeply ashamed and ended up drunk, vomiting upon the mats. From then on, the King of Li treated him coldly. Upon his return, the court already knew of the affair and never employed him again.\n\nWhen Wen Lugong was in Shu, he often held feasts and gatherings, and rumors spread. Coincidentally, the imperial censor He Shengcong, whose given name was Tan, returned to Shu on leave. Wen tasked him with secretly investigating the matter. As He was about to cross the border, Wen arranged a grand reception for him. Zhang Shaoyu, whose given name was Yu, said to Wen: “He Shengcong’s arrival is nothing to fear. When he previously served as prefect of Hanzhou, there was a gathering of fellow townsmen. A courtesan skilled in dance caught his eye. He asked her surname, and she replied, ‘Your servant is surnamed Yang.’ He Shengcong said, ‘So you are the famed Willow of Yang Terrace.’” Shaoyu then took her scarf and inscribed a poem upon it:\n\n*A beauty of Shu is called Slender Waist,*\n*The Eastern Terrace censor cherishes her fiery grace.*\n*From now on, call her Willow of Yang Terrace,*\n*Dancing away ten thousand strands of spring wind.*\n\nHe had the courtesan sing it as a *zhuzhi* poem. He Shengcong became thoroughly drunk, which revealed his true nature. Wen said, “Keep this secret for now.” When He Shengcong arrived, he indeed conducted himself with strict dignity. Wen held a banquet for him and had the courtesan mingle among the official entertainers, singing Shaoyu’s poem as entertainment. He Shengcong became drunk once more. The affair soon spread, reaching the emperor’s ears. Upon his return, he was never again granted an audience. Thus, the slander against Wen Lugong was silenced.\n\nAlas! Tao Gu had no self-restraint, and He Shengcong, though known for his integrity, how could he have acted thus? For the most part, when words take shape, the heart has already been moved. Is this not because desires remain unsevered, illusory forms are mistaken for reality, and love and attachment arise from within?\n\nIn praise it is said:\n\nPeople cherish themselves more than jade,\nAnd love their children as they love themselves.\nExtending this love to others,\nNone should be treated otherwise.\nWhy then do they cruelly plunder,\nIndulging in predation?\nA beauty and a gem nearly overturned Han’s chariot.\n\n**To aid others in wrongdoing.**\n\nIt is said: One version reads: *To teach others in wrongdoing.* For the most part, this is about encouraging others’ vices and failing to guide them toward goodness. Have you not heard the Buddha’s words? The Buddha said: To expound the Dharma and teach others is called the gift of Dharma, enabling beings to awaken through hearing the Way. For this cause, in future lives, seven rewards are obtained:\n\n1. When beings hear the Dharma and instantly dispel anger, in my future lives, I shall attain a sublime form.\n2. When beings hear the Dharma and cultivate compassion, refraining from killing, in my future lives, I shall enjoy long life.\n3. When beings hear the Dharma and do not steal others’ wealth, in my future lives, I shall abound in treasures.\n4. When beings hear the Dharma and open their hearts to joyful giving, in my future lives, I shall gain great strength.\n5. When beings hear the Dharma and instantly cast off delusion, in my future lives, I shall attain unobstructed eloquence.\n6. When beings hear the Dharma and hold firm in faith, free from doubt, in my future lives, my faith shall be clear and bright.\n7. When beings hear the Dharma and skillfully follow its guidance, in my future lives, I shall attain the bodhi path.\n\nThus, guiding others toward goodness—how is this not far better than aiding them in wrongdoing? Let me present examples for each, that all may take heed.\n\nDuring the Yuanfeng era, Li Zhichun served three terms as transport commissioner of Chengdu. He was benevolent toward the people and cherished all things, and the people of Shu lived in peace. Beyond his official duties, he paid particular attention to burying the exposed bones of the dead. A minor official, Xu Xi, originally from Mei, was well-versed in doing good. Li entrusted him with this task, and Xu took it upon himself with dedication. One day, a man named Wang Bin from Jinhua Street in the western market fell ill and entered the netherworld. He saw several officials in crimson and purple robes gathered in a hall. They summoned Xu Xi before them and said: “A celestial decree has just arrived. Li Zhichun, for his merit in burying dry bones, shall be granted another term as prefect of Chengdu.”",

      "translated_text": "The officials declared, “As you have diligently managed the documents, we grant you a son who shall pass the imperial examination.” They continued, “Since you are sincere and trustworthy, you may return and proclaim this, that all may be encouraged.” In the third year of the Yuanyou era, Li Zhichun was indeed promoted to Academician of the Baowen Pavilion and appointed prefect of Chengdu. Xu Xi had a son named Xu Shi, who also passed the imperial examination that year under the Li Changning roster. This is an example of one who aided others in virtue and likewise received its reward.\n\nDuring the Zhenghe era, an edict was issued to extensively renovate the Western Palace. At the time, Wang Ju served as transport commissioner, but was dismissed for imposing excessive levies. The court then summoned Song Sheng of Huixu to serve as chief transport commissioner and oversee the project. Sheng’s intentions were overly exacting: he demanded vast quantities of ox-bone ash to plaster the palace walls, insisting they be made lustrous and smooth. However, his orders were too harsh, driving the people to slaughter oxen and horses, or even exhume graves to obtain bones—yet still, it was not enough.\n\nAt the time, Sun Kuang and Han Rong were both members of the staff. Kuang disapproved of the project and resigned on grounds of illness. Rong alone proposed a solution, suggesting they excavate over a dozen cluster graves from the Five Dynasties period outside the city to meet the demand.\n\nDuring the Xuanhe era, Kuang suddenly died and found himself at Mount Tai. There, he saw a gate bearing a placard that read “Pure and Peaceful.” An underworld official brandished an iron fork, compelling him to sign a confession of clan extermination.

The underworld official again brandished his iron fork, compelling him to sign a confession of clan extermination.

The local officials and people, cowering in fear, hid with nowhere to turn, even to the point of insulting his superiors, placing himself above them. Whenever he issued orders to prefectures and counties, he would insist, “Without official authorization, no directive from the transport commissioner’s office may be carried out.” When Vice-Commissioner Li Song and Judge Chen Gang discussed matters with him and disagreed, he would berate and curse them. When the prefect came to report, He Jia would force him to dismount outside the gate and proceed along the corridor, often not rising from his seat even when the prefect drew near.\n\nHe also sought to abolish Guang’an Prefecture. The consensus held that since it lay far from other commanderies, it could not be abolished. A local official named Zhang Pifang obtained a *Record of the Drum and Horn Tower* written by He Jia’s father, Academician He She, which explicitly stated the reasons it should not be abolished, and presented it to him. He Jia replied, “All matters should follow public consensus—this is hardly sufficient evidence.” Li Song and others then memorialized his conduct, and an imperial edict removed him from office.\n\nAfter his dismissal, someone along the way memorialized Li Song and the others, accusing them of every conceivable offense. When He Jia reached the capital and was handed over to the Kaifeng Prefecture for interrogation, he demanded ten thousand sheets of paper to submit his defense. The prefectural authorities provided the exact number. Yet when he submitted his response, each sheet bore only a single large character, filling the page.

Harm those who nurture, and Heaven will surely send down ruin.\n\nTo sunder another’s marriage—*The Tradition* says, *The Record of Rites* declares: Only with husband and wife does father and son arise.

Soon after, his father died, and his family’s fortunes waned. The Wangs then sought to break the engagement. Her brother, Wang Gu, serving as judicial commissioner of Wanzhou, controlled the matter. Yet pressed by public opinion, he reluctantly allowed the marriage to proceed. A son was born but did not survive, and so Hezhong was kept apart, never permitted to return. The Wangs sent him clothing, but Gu punished the bearers. Hezhong grew ever more bitter, fell ill in heart, and died.\n\nOne night, the Wang woman dreamed Hezhong appeared to her, saying: “I have lodged my complaint in the courts of the unseen. I have been sent to the Eastern Peak of Quzhou, where my case is being investigated.” By then, she had remarried to Lu Song, then serving as instructor in Jizhou. Within a month, Gu died, and all who had taken part in the decision to break the engagement perished.

The daughter, consumed by grief, fell ill and died. Her coffin was interred in a monastic hall. When Gong arrived, the hall’s door locks sprang open of their own accord, and the coffin’s lid lifted.

      "translated_text": "**The Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nThose who attain wealth and grow arrogant—\nThe tradition warns: gazing at the sky from the bottom of a well, they belittle all things; dwelling in idleness without discipline, they indulge their own complacency.\nBefore the horse’s hooves, they flaunt the skill of Yan Ying; from their lofty perch, they brandish the arms of a mantis.\nAtop the towering pavilion, they fuss over the trifling fame of grinding ink; by the Cai River’s edge, they vie for the softest morsels at the feast.\nSuch are the ways of those who, having gained wealth by chance, become haughty.\nYet if you yourself choose arrogance, who will admire it?\nAlas that they do not awaken—if today you are wealthy and proud, then tomorrow you shall bear the guilt of wealth and pride. The Supreme Lord has made this warning clear; how could it be otherwise?\nHave you not heard Laozi’s words: “Wealth and honor breed arrogance, and bring misfortune upon oneself”?\nConfucius said: “Duke Jing of Qi owned a thousand teams of horses, yet on the day he died, the people found nothing to praise.” But Boyi and Shuqi starved beneath Mount Shouyang, and the people still extol them to this day.\nSuch is the fate of those who gain wealth by chance—those whose Way is full cannot be so easily measured.\nLong ago, when Master Fan Wenzheng had yet to rise to office, he studied with Master Liu on Changbai Mountain. Each day, they boiled two *sheng* of millet, waited for it to congeal, then cut it into four pieces, eating two at dawn and two at dusk. Later, both became ministers.\nHan Yi and Li Ruogu once traveled together to take the examinations, sharing a single quilt and a single felt mat. Whenever they went out, they took turns serving as each other’s attendants. Later, both became ministers.\nZhu Ang gathered paulownia seeds to read by; Kong Yanzhi split pine torches to read by. Later, both became imperial attendants.\nLi Xingjian, too poor to afford paper, gathered leaves to practice writing; Li Xuzhou, too poor to own books, constantly borrowed copies from others. Later, both became academicians.\nDu Yan, in his youth, was desperately poor. He traveled between Meng and Luo, copying texts to support himself. Later, he rose to the rank of chief of the Bureau of Military Affairs.\nWang Sui, in his youth, was so destitute that he once fled from a creditor demanding repayment for a meal. He was seized and taken before the authorities—yet later, he too became a minister.\nHow vast is the gulf between those whose Way is full and those who gain wealth by chance!\nConsider Shi Culai in his student days, studying in the southern capital. When Minister Wang Ji heard of his poverty, he sent a tray of food during a banquet. Shi refused it, saying: “Today is fine, but what of tomorrow?”\nWhen the young Hengpu was at school, he endured bitter cold with neither proper clothes nor bedding. A wealthy villager offered him a fur robe, but he declined, saying: “To be resolved in poverty is the very time to cultivate oneself. If one does not restrain oneself with discipline, desire will arise, shame will be lost—where then is the work of self-cultivation?”\nSuch was the resolve of these gentlemen.\nHow could those who gain wealth by chance ever be justified in their arrogance?",

      "translated_text": "A Eulogy states:\nWealth gained by chance forsakes righteousness and harms benevolence.\nScheming day and night, they flaunt their pride in broad daylight.\nBurglars strut with swagger, riding grand carriages and silken cushions.\nBoasting of their ill-gotten riches, they mock and ridicule the poor and upright.\nYet success and failure shift like the wind—west winds scatter dust on the granary.\nTo escape by any means, shameless—what manner of men are these?\n\nThe *Scripture* states: The Buddha said, “I possess two white laws that can save all sentient beings. What are these two white laws? The first is *shame (惭)*, the second is *remorse (愧)*. *Shame* is to refrain from committing sins oneself. *Remorse* is to prevent others from doing so. *Shame* is inner self-reproach. *Remorse* is to confess before others. *Shame* is to feel humiliated before others. *Remorse* is to feel humiliated before Heaven. Those without shame or remorse are called beasts.” This is the teaching of the *Nirvana Sutra*. It further states: “The robe of shame is the foremost adornment among all virtues. Shame is like an iron hook, restraining unlawful deeds. Without shame, one loses all virtue. If the heart holds shame and remorse, enmity and guilt both vanish.” This is the teaching of the *Sutra of Bequeathed Instructions*. Our Master Confucius also said: “Conduct oneself with shame.” The *Book of Rites* likewise states: “In the face of adversity, do not seek escape by any means.” Yet today, men seek escape by any means and remain utterly shameless—what kind of people are they?\n\nGenerally, shame must never leave a person, not even for a moment. Without shame, the shame of having no shame leads to every conceivable transgression—what more need be said?\n\nOnce, the monk Yuancheng was skilled in talismans and incantations. When Wang Cong’s infant son cried incessantly at night, Yuancheng uttered a single incantation, and the child fell silent. Cong deeply revered him and recommended him to Zhang Sheng, Duke Shen. At the time, Duke Shen was inspecting the northern and southern circuits of Jinghu, intending to pacify the river valleys and caves. Someone suggested that the barbarians practiced southern sorcery and feared talismans. When Duke Shen arrived in Chenzhou, he ordered Yuancheng, along with Zhang Yu, Li Ziming, and others, to enter Jiangnan to accept surrender. Upon reaching the caves, Yuancheng and his companions indulged their desires without restraint, even defiling the barbarian women. The chieftain Yuan Meng, enraged beyond endurance, impaled Zhang Yu and the others on pillars, tearing them apart. When Yuancheng’s turn came, he beat his cheeks and begged for mercy. Meng, a devout Buddhist, spared him. Yuancheng thus escaped unscathed. Upon his return, he was rewarded for his “labor in the caves” with the purple robe and the title of Master, styling himself the Grand Master of Investigation. He rode a grand horse, surrounded by attendants bearing maces and swords, utterly without shame. Did he possess shame? Where, then, were the “two white iron hooks” of his daily scripture recitations?\n\nFan Libo and Wang Kui, a retired official of the Bureau of Fields, were old friends from the same village. One day, Wang Kui composed a poem on the six *huo* (活) to critique current affairs. The provincial surveillance commissioner arrested Libo to coerce Kui. Libo, lacking principle, betrayed all of Kui’s past associations to save himself. As a result, Kui was convicted of slander, stripped of his rank, and exiled. Libo alone escaped punishment by informing and was soon promoted. His letter of appointment contained the phrase: “Is it not difficult to be your friend?” The judgment of contemporary moral discourse was thus evident. Yet Libo accepted his promotion with arrogance, utterly devoid of the shame of the threefold disgrace. Did he possess remorse? Where, then, were the teachings on shame from his days of study and self-conduct?\n\nA Eulogy states:\nSeeking survival by any means, shamelessly currying favor—\nAs a son, disloyal; as a minister, unfaithful.\nIn Han, Zhang Yu fell; in Jin, Jia Chong collapsed.\nFirst fearing loss, they ended in treachery and villainy.\nHow to punish such men? With the wind of Boyi.\nRecognizing favors, shifting blame.\n\nThe *Scripture* states: The Supreme One said: “To teach others to cultivate the heart is to cultivate the Dao. To teach others to cultivate the Dao is to cultivate the heart. Generally, the heart *is* the Dao. Before speaking of cultivating the Dao, first govern the heart. Thus, the ancients governed their hearts: when restless, they calmed it; when deviant, they corrected it; when grasping, they relinquished and restrained it; when turbid, they purified and clarified it. In action and stillness, in haste and leisure, over time, external things grew dim, while inner spirit shone clearly. Naturally, the heart’s ground became level, and the Dao was even and straight. The thought of recognizing favors and shifting blame would never arise.”\n\nOnce, Wang Wenzheng served as Chancellor. When Duke Lai sent someone to privately petition for the title of Chancellor-Envoy, Wenzheng was astonished: “The duties of general and minister—how can they be sought? Moreover, I do not accept private requests.” The Duke resented his words.",

Du entered court, wept, and expressed his gratitude: “Had Your Majesty not known me, how could I have attained this?” The Emperor said: “This was Wang Dan’s recommendation.” Only then did Du feel shame and admiration, considering himself inferior.\n\nWhen Li Wenzheng served as Chancellor, if any scholar-official sought a post through private request, he would sternly refuse if he deemed the man unworthy. Yet once appointed, he would never speak of it again. His disciples asked: “Why not let them know?” He replied: “Employing the worthy is the ruler’s prerogative. If I were to inform them, it would be me currying favor and trading personal gratitude. Should the favor be claimed by me, who would bear the resentment? Would either of these two gentlemen [Wang Dan and Du] have claimed credit?”\n\nWhen Wei Renpu served as Chancellor under the Zhou, Emperor Shizong was narrow-minded and quick-tempered, harsh in punishment and execution. If any inner court official or close minister offended him, Renpu would invariably take the blame upon himself. Through his intercessions, seven or eight out of ten were spared. When Cao Wuhui first campaigned against Shu alongside Wang Quanbin, Quanbin slaughtered over three thousand surrendered soldiers. Wuhui remonstrated, but was ignored. Upon their return, the Emperor was furious and determined to investigate. Wuhui then falsely confessed, and Quanbin was thus spared. When Wuhui was later reappointed to campaign against Jiangnan, the Emperor admonished him: “This time, do not repeat what you did in Xichuan—recklessly slaughtering people.” Wuhui then truthfully replied, adding: “The reason I firmly took the blame before was to prevent Quanbin from bearing sole guilt.” Thereupon, the Emperor held him in even higher esteem. Would either of these two gentlemen [Wei Renpu and Cao Wuhui] have shifted blame?",

The thought of recognizing favors and shifting blame would never arise.”\n\nOnce, Wang Wenzheng served as Chancellor. When Duke Lai sent someone to privately petition for the title of Chancellor-Envoy, Wenzheng was astonished: “The duties of general and minister—how can they be sought? Moreover, I do not accept private requests.” The Duke resented his words.",

They were dispatched to Dayun Granary to measure and inspect tribute grain. Yao Zi accepted bribes of gold, silver, and valuables from the supervising officials, then falsely reported a deficit of over eight thousand *shi* of wheat. Wang Hu merely signed his name without knowledge of the matter. When the affair was exposed, they were sent to Shouzhou for investigation. Unwilling to bear the disgrace of corruption alone, Yao Zi took a gold ingot and five silver ingots he had originally received, coated them in lacquer, and bundled them with other items. He sent a trusted servant to deliver them to Wang Hu, anticipating refusal. The servant was instructed to feign a river mishap en route, claiming the letter had been water-damaged and requesting to leave the package at a roadside shrine until he could retrieve a new letter upon return. Wang Hu, unsuspecting, kept it. Soon after, the superior office suddenly issued documents to the Shouzhou investigative court, summoning Wang Hu to confront Yao Zi’s corruption charges. Only then did Wang Hu realize he had been betrayed, but his regret came too late. When brought to prison, Yao Zi falsely accused Wang Hu of colluding in the bribery. Officials retrieved the original ingots from Wang Hu’s home, and upon inspection, they proved to be pure gold. Wang Hu, speechless and unable to defend himself, soon choked with rage and died. Yao Zi then bribed the investigators heavily, shifting all blame onto Wang Hu and thus escaping punishment.\n\nYears later, Yao Zi became Vice Prefect of Luzhou. One day, while traveling along the Huai River, Wang Hu’s wandering spirit appeared across the water, seized him, and refused to release him.

Between heaven and earth, no name remains unblemished. When a man’s name is about to rise, something must inevitably ruin it. Is a name, then, not weighty indeed?

He passed the imperial examination with distinction, his fame resounding so that none dared surpass him. When the palace examination was held, Wang Gongchen ranked first, and Junmin was deeply aggrieved. One day, he dreamed of wandering in the netherworld and paying homage to its ruler, to whom he pleaded for the reason behind his misfortune. The ruler replied, \"You are the reincarnation of Yang Su, Duke of Yue during the Sui dynasty, having passed through several lifetimes. Though you have endured poverty without rising above it, your present suffering is retribution for deeds committed in the Sui era. Even in this life, your fate remains ill-starred. Though your karmic fortune differs, your talent remains unchanged.\" Upon hearing this, Junmin was utterly disheartened. Later, he indeed achieved nothing and died.\n\nAlas! That Yang Su of old should become Junmin of today—he had truly fallen from heaven to earth. Yet he did not lose his male form, which is still preferable to being reborn as a woman.\n\nLi Shu served as Minister and was renowned for his purity and eloquence. When Xu Ling met him, he was deeply impressed, declaring himself inferior. Shu, too, was rather proud of his own abilities. Before he had a son, he suddenly died.

Wherever there were fords, crossroads, or treacherous fields hindering carts and horses, I would level the ground, build bridges, or carry sand and soil—laboring tirelessly thus. Through countless Buddhas’ appearances, until the time of the Tathāgata Vipaśyin, when the king invited the Buddha to a feast, I leveled the earth to await the Buddha. Vipaśyin placed his hand upon my head and said, ‘If you level the earth of your mind, the earth of the world will all be level.’ At once, my mind opened: I saw my body as dust, no different from the dust of the world. The nature of dust does not clash or grind—thus I attained perfect enlightenment and was named Earth-Holder.\nIf the earth of the mind may not be leveled, how can treachery be harbored?\"\n\nGenerally, petty men take risks for fleeting gain—such schemes cannot be forestalled by wisdom or foresight. Long ago, the Attendant-in-Ordinary Cao Liyong carried himself with the pride of an old meritorious official; even the Grand Empress Dowager held him in awe. Whenever imperial favors were bestowed, Liyong often blocked their execution. As his refusals multiplied, even when three were issued in succession, he could not reject them all. Over time, this was noticed by petty men: whenever a request was denied thrice, they would petition again. The Grand Empress Dowager said, \"The Attendant-in-Ordinary has already refused.\" The petitioner replied, \"I have already informed the Attendant-in-Ordinary’s wet nurse—or his kinswoman, Lady Chun—who said he had consented. Liyong truly knew nothing of this.\" Later, when the favor was granted, it was only because three refusals had already been made. Enraged, the Grand Empress Dowager’s wrath gave rise to the disaster of Cao Rui.\n\nChen Guan, serving as Vice Minister of the Three Departments, had an underling of extreme cunning who secretly curried favor with the powerful. Matters in the ministry were routinely referred to him, and when he voiced his assent, the ministers and vice ministers would feign yawns, as if unworthy of his courtesy. Guan, indignant, resolved to dismiss him. The underling, sensing this, served him all the more diligently. Over a year passed without any delays in affairs, and Chen began to treat him well. Once, while entertaining guests, he entrusted the underling with preparing the feast. Unaware of his true intentions—his treacherous heart—the next day, the underling brought a ten-year-old girl to the street outside Donghua Gate, wailing, \"Vice Minister Chen invited guests on such-and-such a day and ordered me to prepare the feast. Not even a tenth of what was needed is ready! What am I to do? I must sell this girl to raise the money!\" He then bribed the secret agents of the Imperial City Bureau to report this. The court believed him and nearly demoted Chen on the spot. Only through the intervention of the chief minister was the matter resolved—yet a year later, Chen was still dismissed because of it.\n\nAlas! Were the schemes of these two men not treacherous? Such treachery—how can it be guarded against?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nA treacherous heart towers ten thousand *ren*,\nWithin it, five weapons arise.\nYi Fu’s faint smile, Lin Pu’s gentle demeanor—\nTheir faces give nothing away; fortune and misfortune strike like lightning.\nThey boast of their cunning, surpassing even the gods.\nYet how could they know the Creator sees all, unseen?\nTo crush another’s strengths—\n**The Scripture says:**\nLuo Zhongxin asked Mount Tortoise, \"To fully realize the mind is to know one’s nature. What is the principle of fully realizing the mind?\"\nMount Tortoise replied, \"Before discussing the full realization of the mind, one must first understand what the mind is. The mind is clarity, penetration, vastness, stillness, and unity. If you grasp this clearly, then we may speak of fully realizing the mind. Without such understanding, what mind is there to realize?\"\nThe Great Silence Chan Master said, \"The mind and nature of man are like the cold moon. When it is cold, water freezes into ice. When it warms, ice melts back into water. When beings are deluded, their nature congeals into mind. When they awaken, their mind dissolves back into nature—it is ever thus.\"\nAlas! These teachings urge us to recognize the mind and illuminate the nature.\nCan those who crush another’s strengths understand this?\n\nLong ago, Mu Xiu was renowned for his poetry and often traveled between the capital and Luoyang. Someone inscribed his verses on the walls of the palace, and when Emperor Zhenzong saw them, he marveled, asking whose poetry it was.

Had he not devoted himself to the learning of exhausting the mind and knowing one’s nature, or to the doctrine of dissolving the mind into nature, could he have attained such understanding? This is why he comprehended life and death before his death, already able to foreknow the month and day, secretly recording it upon his posthumous portrait.\n\nAn ancient saying goes: \"A single deviant thought creates a gulf as vast as heaven and earth.\"\n\n**Eulogy:**\nA person’s slightest goodness,\nIs like beholding a propitious omen.\nNurture and perfect it,\nLest it be thwarted or disturbed.\nWhoever harbors envy,\nWill sink into obscurity.\nConcealing another’s innate worth,\nOnly deepens one’s own negligence.\nHarming oneself and others,\nInvites calamity that pierces to the bone.\nYet shielding one’s own flaws—\n\nAs the *Tradition* records: Someone asked Master Sun the True Man, \"On the doctrine of nurturing one’s nature, I wish to hear it.\" The True Man replied: \"To nurture one’s nature is to cultivate one’s inherent nature. The essential lies in perfecting all conduct; even without medicinal elixirs, one may preserve longevity. If one’s virtue and conduct are deficient, even daily ingesting golden cinnabar and jade nectar will be of no avail. Thus, in daily life, can one shield one’s flaws? If one shields them, then in daily life, nothing will not be flawed—how can this be spoken of? If only one realized the folly of shielding flaws, and over time nurtured one’s inherent nature until no flaws remained, one would be called a person of perfect goodness. How distant then would one be from transcendence?\"\n\nFormerly, Huang Wanyou cultivated the Dao in the uninhabited wilds of southern Qian. Wang Jian invited him to Chengdu, honoring him with utmost reverence as a teacher. One day, he asked about the method of ingesting elixirs. Wanyou replied: \"I am no immortal, nor one who ingests elixirs. I merely empty my mind to nurture qi, cultivate benevolence in my conduct, and minimize my faults.\" Later, he earnestly sought to return and could no longer be summoned.\n\nLiu Yi hailed from an illustrious family and passed the imperial examinations in his youth. Within a decade, he rose to an official post of two thousand *shi*. During the Chongning era, he governed Hanyang. Whenever he had leisure, he would disguise himself in plain clothes and wander among the mountains of Dabie, conversing daily with farmers and rustics. He inquired into the efficacy of prefectural governance and the hardships of the common folk. If he found any matter amiss and deemed it reformable, he would return and rectify it. Eventually, he encountered an extraordinary person and thus attained transcendence.\n\nAs for these two gentlemen, would they have shielded their flaws? Could they have had flaws at all? This is how they nurtured their inherent nature and ultimately ascended to the rank of immortals.\n\nLet me further expound on lesser examples, that those who cling to shielding their flaws may each take heed and strictly guard against it.\n\nLi Ji rose through the ranks to high office. On the day of his death, he summoned his son and said: \"I have no other regrets in life, save for one thing: during my time in Hangzhou, I once purchased a set of *White Anthology*—that is my sole remorse.\" Cai Junmo once wrote in large characters on fine Wu paper to embellish the matter.

      "translated_text": "Grieve with compassion when passing judgment, mourn with propriety in funerals, and wage war only when unavoidable—thus may the necessity of killing be discerned. To cherish the people and love all creatures is to make no distinction between noble and base. Those cruel and destructive men, beast-hearted though human-faced, wantonly cut and waste. As the *Daoist Canon* records: the three stars of Weaving Maidens govern silk and precious treasures, while the four stars of Woman’s Lodge oversee the weaving and tailoring of cloth. How then can wanton cutting and waste be justified? Have you not heard how the silkworm originated from the transformation of Horse Neigh?\n\nIn a former life, the Great Master Horse Neigh was once king of Vaiśālī. In his realm lived a people shaped like horses yet clothed in nothing. The king, exercising his divine power, divided his own body to become silkworms, that they might have garments. Later, reborn in Central India, the king’s former subjects—those horse-shaped folk—yearned for him and neighed in sorrow without cease, whence he was called Horse Neigh, the Twelfth Patriarch.\n\nIn general, a single garment costs a thousand silkworm lives. According to the Buddha’s teaching, even wearing silk incurs a debt to be repaid—how much worse, then, to cut and waste it without cause? Thus did Emperor Wen of Han ensure his favored ladies’ robes did not trail upon the ground. Emperor Wenzong of Tang once bared his sleeve before his ministers, saying, “This garment has been washed thrice.” Duke Wen of Jin wore no double-layered silk; Zixia’s robes were patched like a quail’s plumage; Ji Wenzi kept no concubine clad in silk; Yan Ying’s concubines wore no silk; Dong Wei pieced together scraps into a robe called “Hundred Knots”; and Ji Tong wore no duplicate garments—all in frugal reverence for fortune.\n\nHave you not heard that wanton cutting and waste bring retribution after death? In the early years of Shaoxing, Guo Yinzhi’s daughter, named Yin Feng, was seized by the underworld court and saw countless sinners. Among them was a woman surnamed Zhao, named Twelve, bound in the corridor. Before her lay several heaps of cloth—shredded bolts, remnants, and countless garments both new and old. Yin Feng asked, “What crime is this?” The underworld officer replied, “This woman delighted in fine silks and wasted bolts by cutting them. She is ordered to mend every piece back into whole cloth before she may be released.”\n\nZhao Shizhou’s wife, née Quan, after dying for several days, possessed her maid Lai Xi and said, “In life, I squandered silk for shoes and stockings, and used excess water for washing my hair and feet. The Water Bureau of the underworld now punishes me, flogging me daily with unbearable torment. Pray convey this to Shizhou.” Her family, hearing this, was overcome with grief. How then can wanton cutting and waste be deemed without sin?",

Quickly gather my hunting gear and burn it—perhaps they will know I have repented.\"\n\nThus, can wanton slaughter and harm be justified? Even dogs, when provoked to kill, are counted among the ten foremost transgressions—how can such violence be indulged?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nPunishment is to halt crime,\nArms are to quell disorder.",

      "translated_text": "Before long, the fire flared up, and the tree was consumed in flames. The five hundred bats, so rapt in listening to the sound of the Dharma that they could not bear to leave, all perished in the fire. Later, they were reborn as humans—bright, keen, and quick-witted—renounced their homes to cultivate the Dao, and together attained the fruit of sagehood. Later, King Kaniṣka and the Venerable Pārśva gathered five hundred sages in Kashmir to compose the *Vibhāṣā Śāstra*. Those five hundred sages were none other than the five hundred bats of former days.\n\nDo they not cultivate realization?\n\nIn general, humans and creatures are not inherently different; what sets them apart is the power of fortune and karma, and the shell of the body. Have you not heard of the power of not killing? Long ago, Aṅgulimāla was once a king who delighted most in slaughter. Repenting his sins, he left the household life and went begging. Arriving at a household where a woman was in difficult labor, she clutched him and begged for help. Aṅgulimāla said, “I have only just entered the Way—how can I save you? Wait until I return and ask the Buddha.” When he returned, the Buddha said, “Hurry back to the bedside of the woman in labor and loudly proclaim: ‘I have come from the Dharma of the sages and have never taken a life.’ Upon hearing these words, no child fails to be born.” Aṅgulimāla followed the instruction, and the child was indeed delivered.\n\nAlas! This was but a single declaration of not killing, yet its power to deliver from distress was so great. If such is the case, then how much more power must there be in wanton butchery to sink one into suffering?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nA scholar, if not for necessity,\nshould not kill dogs or swine.\nTo eat meat for seventy days—\nits weight is thus.\nFor offerings to guests or ancestors,\nit may be unavoidable.\nHow dare one indulge the palate,\nwielding knife and spoon at will?\nBeholding the suffering of living beings,\nfeel their pain as your own.\nTo scatter and waste the five grains—\n\nThe *Tradition* says: The Celestial Granary of the five grains resides among the twenty-eight constellations, governed by the star *Wēi*. Generally, humans regard food as heaven; to go a single day without eating is to suffer the pangs of hunger. Thus, the sages devoted themselves to agriculture and valued grain. The Son of Heaven plowed the fields himself to encourage farming, and in spring and summer, prayed to the Supreme Emperor for abundant harvests. How then can the five grains be scattered and wasted?\n\nOnce, during a famine in the Three Rivers region, the price of grain soared, and people resorted to gathering mountain tubers and wild vines to survive. The dead numbered no fewer than fifteen in ten. At that time, Wang Fajin, having completed his merit and attained immortality, ascended to the heavens. Yet he returned to plead with the Emperor on behalf of the people. The Emperor said: “Humans occupy the great position among the Three Powers, embodying the harmony of heaven and earth. To attain human form and be born in the Central Land is not easily achieved. Heaven moves the origin of the four seasons; earth endows the essence of the five phases, producing the five grains and a hundred fruits to nourish the people. Yet humans fail to appreciate the nurturing grace of heaven and earth, carelessly wasting grain, disdaining silk and hemp, so that farmers and weaving women toil without enough to eat, exhaust themselves without warmth, and are further ungrateful for their labor. This is why the divine spirits reproach them, and heaven and earth do not protect them.”\n\nRecently, the local administrators of mountains and rivers all submitted memorials, reporting that people despise and discard the five grains, failing to value the foundation of clothing and food. The Supreme Emperor had already commanded the Bureau of Mount Taihua to summon the spirits of the five grains, causing their cultivation to fail and leading gradually to famine as a form of punishment, hoping to chasten their hearts. Yet soon after, the Most High issued a merciful decree: “The Great Dao cherishes life and must first save beings. Though the recent famine was brought upon themselves by the people, they know not the cause and have no path to repentance or redemption. You shall now serve as an attendant in the Celestial Palace. Temporarily return to the mortal world and universally proclaim to the people that they must repent their sins, treasure and cherish agriculture and sericulture, and not dare to waste or squander. This, too, shall be your hidden merit.”\n\nFajin received the decree and returned, speaking his message before departing again. Liu Yuanzhen was also one who attained the Dao. In his youth, he dreamed of a Daoist who fed him a peach, after which he could abstain from grain. One day, on the road in Zhongnan, he encountered a nobleman with a grand retinue. Yuanzhen said to him, “Have some regard for my people.” The nobleman nodded in assent. A companion asked, “Who is that?” Yuanzhen replied, “That is the mountain spirit. The Supreme Emperor, seeing that the wheat harvest would be abundant but that people would not cherish it, ordered that two-tenths be reaped. I pleaded on behalf of the people.” Soon after, a great wind and rain arose, ruining two-tenths of the wheat. From this, we know all the more that the five grains truly must not be carelessly discarded.\n\nMoreover, each person’s allotment of sustenance is fixed by destiny. For example, if one has a thousand strings of cash and spends one hundred a day, it will last ten thousand days. If one spends a string a day, it will last a thousand days. Between a thousand days and ten thousand days—would you not prefer the latter?\n\nFormerly, Minister Feng Ji often said: “In my youth, I personally witnessed Xuedou teaching people to cherish their fortune, saying: ‘Humans do not die by fate but by the exhaustion of their allotted blessings.’” Yuan Houzhi died and was revived, and recounted: “When I first arrived in the netherworld, the master said to me: ‘Your blessings are not yet exhausted; in time, you will rise to the rank of minister in two bureaus. However, you must cherish your fortune to do so.’” From then on, Houzhi reduced his expenses in every matter. Even with a single cup of rice, he would first set some aside before eating. In all his provisions, he dared not exceed his due. Later, he indeed attained the position of chief minister and lived past seventy. If even those with meager fortune must cherish it, how much more should others?\n\nThe *Gazetteer of Wuyun Mountain* records that the Great Master Zhi Feng was once seated in meditation in the Hall of Samantabhadra when suddenly a spirit knelt before him. The master asked, “Who are you?” The spirit replied, “I am the guardian of the precepts.” The master said, “I have long been troubled by past transgressions—do you know of them?” The spirit said, “What sins have you committed? However, there is one small fault. Since you have asked, I dare not conceal it. For example, the water used to rinse your alms bowl is also the property of the donor. To discard it as you do is not proper. From now on, you will suffer a minor illness.”",

From this, his compassion for the people and concern for the realm became known, and he was subsequently elevated to high office.\n\nWhen Sima Chi served as magistrate of Guangshan County, the imperial palace caught fire, and all counties were ordered to supply bamboo and timber. The prefectural decree demanded delivery within three days. Sima, knowing the region produced no large bamboo, had to purchase it from Qi and Huang, which could not arrive in three days. He therefore set a separate deadline for the people, with penalties for late delivery. Sheng Du, the prefect, flew into a rage upon hearing this. Yet when Guangshan delivered its bamboo, it was the first among all counties to do so.\n\nWhen Lord Fan Zhennan governed Qingshe, the Hebei region suffered a severe grain shortage, and the tribute grain from Qingshe was to be transported to Bozhou for collection. The people were greatly burdened by the transport, yet grain prices in Hebei were not particularly high. Lord Fan instructed the people to pay three *huan* per *hu* at their local prefecture, then dispatched his staff to carry the funds to Bozhou, where they offered double the price to purchase grain. The high price attracted vast quantities, and within five days, the quota was met, with surplus funds remaining for several years. Lord Fan distributed the remainder to the people according to their contributions.\n\nWhen Wang Ji served as registrar of Longxi, the prefectures of Fujian were ordered to procure crane feathers for arrows. As crane feathers were not a common resource, and the officials pressed the people with excessive urgency, the people could not endure the hardship. Wang instructed them to substitute goose feathers instead and promptly dispatched a memorial to the court via courier.

      "translated_text": "**The Biography of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nTo ruin a family and seize its wealth and treasures—this is recorded in the *Biographies*: if such destruction arises unintentionally, the wrong is already no small matter. But if one acts for the sake of wealth and treasures, thereby deliberately ruining a family, it is truly a great evil. Let us recount those who, having once destroyed a family, later restored its property—one or two virtuous deeds—so that those who govern the people in later times, should they encounter such matters, may all act likewise. In this way, those whose families have been ruined may yet find benefit.\n\nWhen Liu Chang governed Yangzhou, the prefecture contained a reservoir called Leibei, originally belonging to the people but later seized by the authorities to store water for the convenience of canal transport. Over the years, the reservoir fell into disrepair, and the canal transport no longer relied upon it. Eventually, it was occupied by the Hao clan, and though the original landowners repeatedly petitioned, they received no redress. Upon taking office, Liu immediately ruled that the land be returned. Thus, thirty-six households—over three hundred men and women—regained their fields and were spared from hunger and want.\n\nWhen Hou Shuxian served as magistrate of Sizhou County, the county contained many confiscated fields. Among them was the estate of Li Cheng, encompassing ten *li* in circumference, with a river flowing through its center—some of the most fertile land in the region. A hundred tenant families, all prosperous clans, had farmed it for generations. The original assessed price of fifteen thousand strings of cash had never been met, and when Jia Weigong held power, he sought to raise the price by another five thousand strings. Chen Daogu, dispatched on official business, arrived to discuss increasing the price with Hou. Hou sighed and said: \"Does the gentleman know the full story of this matter? Li Cheng, during the reign of Emperor Taizu, served as a wine officer. When the goods under his care were damaged by flooding, he was held liable for the loss, assessed at five thousand strings of cash. At the time, the court had allocated funds from the Ministry of Revenue, instructing local officials to purchase materials for arrows, bows, and crossbows in preparation for military needs. When Li Chongjin rebelled and the court prepared to raise troops, the pre-purchased materials failed to arrive. Enraged, Emperor Taizu ordered that all those indebted to the government have their property confiscated. Though Li Cheng had never personally received the funds, the officials, fearing the emperor’s wrath, dared not distinguish his case, and his estate was seized along with the rest. His descendants were thus reduced to ruin. It is regrettable that the prime minister did not correct this injustice and return their land. Would it not be better to reduce the price by five thousand strings, allowing Li’s descendants to repurchase it? The government would still profit handsomely, and Li’s descendants would avoid destitution. What does the gentleman think?\" Chen replied: \"I was truly unaware of these details. If it benefits the people, how could I object?\" Thus, the price was reduced by five thousand strings.\n\nHou then summoned Li Cheng’s descendants and explained the matter. They wept and bowed, saying: \"We are deeply grateful for your kindness, but our family is too poor to afford it.\" Hou next called the tenants together and addressed them: \"You were all once humble households who, by farming Li’s land, have grown prosperous—your granaries full, your families elevated to wealth. Now the government sells this land, and the Li family, impoverished, cannot afford it. If another buys it, they will surely tear down your granaries, dismantle your homes, and drive you from your livelihood. Will you still enjoy such prosperity? Would it not be better for all one hundred households to pool your money, allowing the Li family to repurchase the land? I will then extend your payment deadlines. In this way, the land returns to the Li family, and you retain your tenancy for generations to come—both sides benefit. Does this not seem right?\" The tenants all bowed and said: \"We will do as you say.\" Thus, Li Cheng’s descendants regained their land.\n\nThose who ruin families and seize their wealth and treasures—could they ever act thus? It is a pity they do not comprehend the heavens and hells, for their fate is sealed by such deeds. What delusion drives them to act so?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nA family is built through toil and hardship,\nPassed down through generations, gathering and preserving.\nWho are these bandits and plunderers,\nSeizing what others have amassed?\nThe wolves in power, the tigers of harsh governance,\nLurking in your halls, specters watching at your door.\nThey breach the dikes, set fires,\nTo harm the people’s homes.\nAs the *Biographies* say: floods and flames,\nThe cruelest disasters in the world.\nYet they breach the dikes, set fires,\nTo harm the people’s homes—can their crimes be light?\nThis is why the Perfected Ones above cannot tolerate them,\nAnd the luminous spirits will surely punish them.\n\nIn the second year of Tiansheng, the Yellow River’s embankment at Daming Prefecture suddenly collapsed, and the water surged forth with great force. When Han Weigong governed Beijing, an official rushed to report: \"At the breach, a great turtle has long been the source of trouble. When it lurks beneath the water, the river flows calmly. When it surfaces, the waters flood. Now it has surfaced—what is to be done?\" At that moment, the emissary Zheng Gui, dispatched on a mission, happened to arrive at the office. He shot the turtle dead with a single arrow. Later, the turtle lodged a complaint in the underworld, and King Yama summoned Zheng Gui to face it in judgment. That very day, the Perfected Warrior, the Spiritually Responsive True Lord, descended to Mount Luofeng to review the ledgers of life and death. By his grace, the demonic turtle was exonerated, shattered into dust in midair, so that it could never again harm the people. Zheng Gui was then ordered to be escorted back to the mortal realm by a divine messenger.\n\nIf this is how the gods deal with those who breach dikes, how much more will they punish those who harm the people?\n\nLi Yuan was most filial to his mother. One evening, a traveler arrived seeking lodging. Li was by the stream, boiling a chicken, and the guest assumed it was for his meal. When the rice was served, however, it was coarse and unpolished, and the guest grew furious, refusing to eat before storming out. Li explained: \"My mother is ill and craves meat. Living in the mountains, we have none, so I boiled this chicken for her. I had nothing to offer you.\" The guest’s anger only grew. That night, he crept behind the house, set a fire, and fanned the flames toward Li’s home. Suddenly, the heavens sent rain and reversed the wind, extinguishing the fire.",

Once our main force departs Daizhou, order them to advance with their troops. When our army reaches Yingzhou, the enemy will surely muster all their strength to resist. At that moment, the officials and people of Shu Prefecture can be gathered into the Shijie Valley, while a thousand strong crossbowmen are stationed to guard the valley’s entrance.

Only when they were caged and sent to the capital did he fall silent.\n\nHad the assistant minister not made preparations in advance, would success not have been thwarted?\n\nThe eulogy states:\nDu Yu pacified Wu, yet the merit was Yang Hu’s.\nFang Xuanling excelled in strategy, and Du Ruhui always followed.\nOnce their enterprises were established, their fame and achievements soared.\nYet narrow-mindedness, like Qi’s downfall, consumes all.\nThey failed, and what use was it to me?\nTo damage another’s tools to exhaust their use—\nThe *Classic* says: \"To damage another’s tools to exhaust their use.\"\nThe *Taishang Shu* warns against this, for it is also a failure of the heart.\nA failure of the heart is indeed a sin, but some thereby incur great calamity and sow endless enmity—such acts merit the gravest retribution.\nThus, to damage another’s tools to exhaust their use—how can one not beware?\n\nLong ago, the Huayan Master was skilled in the *Huayan Sutra* and delighted in expounding it, earning his name and drawing many followers. He favored fine alms bowls and begging bowls, and his three hundred disciples all emulated him. Among them was a monk whose conduct was unmatched, yet he had fallen ill and remained secluded for months. He possessed a precious glass bowl, which he treasured.\n\nOne day, a visiting monk arrived from afar, lacking a bowl. Someone suggested borrowing the sick monk’s temporarily. At first, the monk refused, but after persistent pleas, he relented, warning earnestly: \"Return it promptly after the meal.\" When the bowl was returned, the visitor soon stumbled, shattering it on the ground. The sick monk flew into a rage, cursing violently, and died shortly after.\n\nYears later, when the Huayan Master moved to Mount Song, both the sick monk’s disciple and the monk who had borrowed the bowl were present. One day, as he was expounding the teachings, a rushing wind and water suddenly arose outside the temple. The master knew what was coming and hastily had the visiting monk sit behind him. Moments later, a great python, nearly ten *zhang* long, glared with bulging eyes and bared fangs as it slithered in. The crowd nearly scattered in panic, but the master restrained them. Brandishing his staff, he restrained the python, saying: \"Among three hundred disciples, your cultivation was the highest. Yet for excessive anger and refusing my teachings, you have come to this. Even now, over a single bowl, do you seek to harm this monk?\"\n\nHe then commanded the assembly to administer the Three Refuges, the Three Reverences, and recite scriptures and mantras to repent and liberate the python. The serpent coiled and departed. The Huayan Master summoned the disciple and said: \"The great python just now was your master. Through kalpas of cultivation, he was on the verge of attaining fruition. But in his final moments, a single outburst of anger brought him to this. Had he not encountered me, he would have devoured that monk—and if he had, he would surely have fallen into hell. From there, how long would his transmigration have lasted?\"\n\nHe then addressed the assembly: \"Tomorrow, after the cremation of the deceased monk behind the mountain, you will find that the great python has already died, its skull shattered.\" After the cremation, the Huayan Master summoned the disciple again and said: \"Next year, your master will be reborn as a girl in the Pei family. When the birth is difficult, he will grow enraged and harm his mother, deepening his karmic burden. When the time comes, hasten to save her. Call his name and relay my words—then no harm will come.\" And so it came to pass.",

It is only because they have long planted the roots of virtue that they come to this. Those who have not reached such heights—how could they rashly harbor resentment and jealousy, wishing for their ruin?\n\nIn the early years of the dynasty, when Lu Duoxun was exiled to Zhuhai, Li Fu said to the Grand Councilor Zhao Pu: \"Though Zhuhai lies beyond the sea, its climate and terrain are not so harsh. Chunzhou, though within the realm, is a place from which none return alive. Why not exile him to Chunzhou instead? Outwardly, this would appear a lenient sentence from the court, yet in truth, it would consign him to certain death.\" Zhao Pu did not reply. Soon after, Li Fu himself was implicated in a crime and exiled to Xuanzhou. The emperor’s wrath had not yet subsided when Zhao Pu presented Li Fu’s words to the throne. That very day, Li Fu’s sentence was changed to exile in Chunzhou. He arrived at his post and died within ten days.\n\nWhen Minister Kou was demoted, Ding Wei bore much of the responsibility. When the matter of his place of exile was first discussed, Ding Wei and Feng Zheng were both in the Grand Council. As Ding Wei took up the brush to draft the edict, he turned to Feng Zheng and said: \"I had intended to exile him to Yazhou, but feared the perilous journey across the whale-infested waves. So I settled on Leizhou instead.\" Soon after, Ding Wei himself was implicated in a crime and faced exile. Feng Zheng was still in the Grand Council and happened to be drafting the edict. Smiling, he said to Zeng Shen: \"The Crane Chancellor once wished to exile Minister Kou to Yazhou, lamenting the dangers of the whale-infested seas.

All our endeavors come to naught. Meanwhile, our neighbors, who have long practiced *yogācāra*, enjoy robust health and success in all they do. Why are they so fortunate, and what wrong have we done?”\n\nKumāralāta replied, “The retribution of good and evil unfolds in three times. People see only the virtuous die young and the wicked live long, fortune favor the perverse and misfortune the righteous, and so they dismiss cause and effect as empty, karma and its fruits as false. Yet they do not know that echo follows sound, shadow follows form—even the slightest deviation remains unerring. Though a hundred thousand kalpas may pass, it is never erased.”\n\nŚayata’s doubts were instantly dispelled.\n\nKumāralāta continued, “Though you have faith, you have not yet attained clarity. *Karma* arises from delusion, perception from conditioning, perception from unawareness, and unawareness from the mind. The mind is fundamentally pure—without birth or extinction, without creation or cessation, without retribution or victory or defeat. It is still, it is luminous. If you enter this gate of the Dharma, you may become one with all Buddhas.”\n\nAlas! Can those who see others wealthy and wish their ruin comprehend this?\n\nEven if the wealthy are unvirtuous, their downfall will come in due time—yet one must not harbor the thought of wishing their ruin.\n\nZhou Yifu of Hong County was immensely wealthy, dominating his region and acting with great arrogance. A man from a neighboring prefecture, Sun Shizhi, once gently admonished him. Yifu flew into a rage, cursing, “What does a little ghost like you know? How dare you meddle in my affairs!”\n\nLater, when Shizhi passed the imperial examinations and became the transport commissioner of his circuit, Yifu still raged, “Even if he’s a surveillance commissioner, what can he do to me?”\n\nOne day, Shizhi conducted an inspection in Hong County. Just then, Yifu was beating a man in the marketplace, and the victim lodged a complaint. Shizhi subtly encouraged the man to report Yifu’s lawless acts. That very day, he sent the case to the authorities for investigation. Before long, the ringleader died in prison. After deliberation, the officials memorialized the throne, transferring the case to another prefecture. Yifu was ultimately sentenced to death for conspiracy to murder, and his descendants were registered as government bondsmen. Within a few years, Shizhi was transferred to serve as transport commissioner in Hebei. At the time, war had broken out, and his entire family perished at the hands of the invaders. Their ruin was no different from Yifu’s—was this not retribution?\n\nQian Ruoshui served as an assistant magistrate in Tong Prefecture. A wealthy family lost a young servant girl, and her mother and grandfather filed a complaint. The prefecture ordered the registrar to investigate. The registrar had once sought a favor from the wealthy family but was refused, so he falsely accused them of father and son jointly murdering the servant girl and throwing her body into the water. The case was submitted to the prefecture, and the officials who reviewed it found no discrepancies. Only Ruoshui doubted the verdict and steadfastly refused to sign. He even spent his own money to secretly send men to search for the servant girl. Eventually, they found her, and the family was exonerated. Had they not encountered Ruoshui, the wealthy family might have met the same fate as Yifu.\n\nIn my humble view, not only did the wealthy family owe him gratitude, but the registrar did as well.

Once, while traveling by boat, his vessel drew alongside that of a foreign merchant. The merchant suddenly fell gravely ill and summoned Yue to his side. Upon arriving, Yue was bequeathed a luminous pearl, along with the care of the merchant’s two daughters—both of surpassing beauty. The next day, the merchant died, leaving behind tens of thousands in treasure. Every soul aboard the vessel cast covetous eyes upon it. Yet Yue meticulously cataloged the wealth and entrusted it to the authorities. He arranged for one daughter to be wed, then prepared the merchant’s body for burial. As he did so, he secretly placed the luminous pearl in the merchant’s mouth, unseen by all. Later, when the merchant’s kin arrived to claim the fortune, Yue requested the officials to open the coffin. There lay the pearl, and all who witnessed it marveled at his integrity.\n\nWei Zidu was traveling at dusk when he encountered a scholar collapsed by the roadside, clutching his chest in agony. Zidu dismounted and tended to him, but the scholar soon died. Searching his belongings, Zidu found a scroll of plain silk and ten ingots of gold. He sold two ingots to cover the funeral costs, then placed the remaining eight beneath the scholar’s head and laid the silk scroll beside him. Years later, a man inquired of Zidu about the scholar’s burial site. Zidu led him to the grave, and upon exhumation, both the gold and the scroll were found untouched. From that day forth, Zidu’s reputation resounded far and wide.\n\nThese are the noble deeds of our forebears, recorded in the annals of history, their brilliance dazzling the eyes and ears of all who hear them. Such conduct is far beyond the reach of those who covet another’s wealth and wish another’s death.\n\nYet even so, let us recount these few examples, that all may take heed.\n\nIn Yongjia, there lived a merchant named Xu Hui. Once, in Danyang, he borrowed over a thousand strings of cash from a wealthy broker. Before he could repay the debt, the broker died, and Xu kept silent. The broker’s family, unaware of the loan, never sought repayment.",

      "translated_text": "Later, Hui fathered a son, remarkably bright and clever, whom he cherished deeply. At the age of eight, the boy fell ill, and Hui summoned physicians and purchased medicines, spending beyond measure. Though his wealth was exhausted, the child’s illness showed no sign of abating. One day, as the boy lay sick, he suddenly spoke to Hui’s close acquaintance, the nun Shi: “I wish to return home.” The nun replied, “This is your home. Your parents love you so—where else would you go?” The boy said, “I am from Danyang. Long ago, Master Xu borrowed a thousand strings of cash from me, and when I died, he never repaid the debt. Now I have come to be reborn in his household to reclaim what is mine.” With these words, he passed away.\n\nThere was also Bai Yuantong, who once owed five strings and four hundred coins to Yang Jun of the Eastern Market. Before he could repay the debt, Jun died suddenly, and Yuantong concealed the matter. After his death, he was reborn in Jun’s family as a donkey. One day, Jun’s son rode the donkey to the market, when it suddenly spoke in a human voice: “I am Bai Yuantong. I owed your father five strings and four hundred coins, and this is my retribution. Now, the bran-seller in the Southern Market owes me the same amount. Sell me to him at once, and with the money you receive, settle your father’s debt.” Jun’s son did as instructed, and two days later, the donkey died.\n\nCan those who covet another’s wealth and wish another’s death ever escape their fate?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWu Zixu repaid kindness, casting gold into the river’s rapids.\nJi Zha honored his vow, hanging his sword upon a tomb’s tree.\nThough their fates differed, their hearts never wavered.\nEntrusting life and orphans, their names endure through integrity.\nBut those who deceive the dead are as filth to flies and gnats—\ntheir schemes unfulfilled, they curse and resent.\nAs the saying goes: “Those who know no shame pursue only gain, save for men of principle.\nIf, when their demands go unmet, they immediately curse and resent, they are the basest of men.”\nHow could they grasp Han Changli’s teaching on self-accountability and forbearance toward others,\nor Fan Zhongxuan’s principle of holding others to the same standard one holds oneself?\n\nChangli said: “The noble man examines himself strictly and thoroughly;\nin dealing with others, he is lenient and forgiving.\nStrict and thorough, he never falters;\nlenient and forgiving, others delight in doing good.”\n\nZhongxuan said: “All my life, I have studied but two words—loyalty and forbearance—\nand they have never failed me, whether serving at court, attending to my lord,\ninteracting with colleagues, or fostering kinship.\nI once warned my descendants: ‘Even the dullest man is sharp when judging others;\neven the wisest grows dim when excusing himself.\nIf you can judge yourself as you judge others, and forgive others as you forgive yourself,\nyou will not fail to reach the realm of sages and worthies.’”\nDo those who clamor for gain understand this?\n\nIn this world, few indeed refrain from grasping hands outstretched for favors.\nLet me recount a few more examples, that all may feel shame.\n\nDirector Hu Bao of the Ministry of Justice once told others: “When I served as magistrate of Wu County in Suzhou, many scholar-officials resided there, and none failed to make requests of me. Only the retired Grand Supervisor Fu Yan, though living in Suzhou for three years, never once imposed upon me.”\n\nSenior Academician Qiu Shunqing also said: “When I governed Xinjian County in Hongzhou, the powerful clans of the region often interfered with official affairs.

This is called delighting in misfortune, and calamity will befall one’s own person.\n\nTo laugh at another for an incomplete or flawed physique—\nAs the tradition records: Duke Jin sent Xi Chou to summon an assembly in Qi, and Duke Qing of Qi had women concealed behind curtains to observe.

If my attendants see him, they will surely mock and humiliate him. One day, should he gain power, not a soul of my clan will remain.” Ziyi’s discernment was profound—how far removed from Duke Qing’s!\n\nAgain, like the beauty of Lord Pingyuan who laughed at the hunchbacked servant hobbling to fetch water and had him executed; or the man of Zhao County who mocked Mengchang Jun as a puny husband and was put to death.

Once, he presented a composition to Minister Wei Zhou, whose sons and nephews openly ridiculed him. Wei Zhou said: “Though Lu’s person is unremarkable, his writing has beginning and end. One day, he will rise high.” Later, Lu indeed passed the examinations, swiftly ascending to the halls of governance, promoting officials in the capital, and becoming the Fujian observer.\n\nWang Yigong Qinruo was gaunt and ungainly, his manner rustic, with a growth upon his neck. Once, he presented a composition to Qian Gong Xibai, who looked upon him with disdain. By chance, a diviner was present, who exclaimed in astonishment: “This is a man of the highest nobility—how can he be slighted?” Qian Gong asked: “In my hall, could such a one become chief minister?” The diviner replied: “It may not be long.” Within a few years, he indeed rose to the position of grand councilor.\n\nSun Wenyi Gong was likewise unprepossessing in appearance. Once, traveling to the capital for the examinations, he sought a certificate from the county to sell his fields. The magistrate’s aide, Li Zhaoyan, jested: “How many men like you are there?” That year, Wenyi ranked third in the examinations. Within a few years, he became a judge of the Bureau of Appointments.

According to the *Record of Strange Phenomena*, when the soldier Lü Yongzhi was executed, his central hall was searched, and a stone casket was found. Inside lay a copper figurine, nearly three feet tall, its body bound in shackles, its mouth pierced by a long nail, its back inscribed with Gao Pian’s native village, official rank, surname, and given name—all part of a *yasheng* curse. Thus was Gao Pian ever constrained by Yongzhi’s machinations.\n\nAlas! If Gao Pian was already under Yongzhi’s control, why then did Yongzhi meet his own execution?

Some, having erred in their cultivation, find their spirits lodged within trees, as the *Sutra of Karmic Retribution* tells of Han Yuanshou transformed into a tree spirit.

      "translated_text": "In former times, at the Flying Hall of Eastern Gorge Mountain, there stood an ancient pine. During the Daguan era, a retainer of the Imperial City Commissioner Qian Shiyu struck its roots with an axe, and sap flowed forth in abundance. The following year, Palace Attendant Qian Ji passed by the temple and dreamed at night of an old man who said to him: \"Though I am not one of those round-headed and square-footed beings, I am a plant imbued with spiritual essence. Yesterday, Qian Shiyu’s man struck my knee with an axe, taking my sap to use as candle wax, and even now my blood still flows. I beg you to inform the abbot, that he may swiftly mend my wound, so I may not be shaken by blind winds and thus fulfill my allotted years—I would be deeply indebted.\" At dawn, Ji set out in haste and failed to notify the abbot, but upon meeting Magistrate Qian Lu, he recounted the dream. Lu went to the temple to inspect the tree and found it just as Ji had described. He promptly had the wound sealed with lacquer.\n\nThe residence of Military Inspector and Minister of Works Qian Renkang adjoined that of the Central Army Captain Marshal Jin Zhao. In Zhao’s garden grew a peony, which each year bore no fewer than three hundred blossoms, their petals crimson as blood, their edges gilded like gold, and atop each stem, the calyx bore silken veins, every one resembling a natural butterfly—truly a marvel of its kind. Whenever the flowers bloomed, Zhao would host a feast, and Renkang was always invited to attend. One night, Renkang drank heavily, brandished his sword, stripped to his undergarments, slung a large basket on his back, and dagger at his waist, leapt over the wall, and stole the peony away. Zhao remained unaware. As he was stealing the plant, a voice sounded from the air, faint as a bee’s hum: *\"Three hundred blossoms on a single stem, / Smiling in the spring breeze. / Next year in the third month, / Each petal shall be a crimson of heartbreak.\"* The following year, when the flowers bloomed, Zhao once more held a feast, and Renkang again attended. At the sight of the peony, he flew into a rage. Upon returning home, he slit his own belly and died, fulfilling the verse spoken at the time of the theft.\n\nAlas! Renkang perished for the sake of a flower, for the spirit had foreseen his fate even as he stole it.

      "translated_text": "At dawn’s misty ascent, poets conceal their hidden sorrows.\nHeaven and earth bring forth life—where harmonious qi roams.\nTo harm without cause is no different from severing a ditch’s flow.\nThe sacred oak appeared in dreams, its parable no idle tale.\n\n*The Nineteenth Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response* concludes here.\n\n---\n\n**The Twenty-First Scroll of the Supreme Scripture on Retribution and Response**\n\n**Biography of Li Changling, with Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nRewards and punishments are not impartial.\nThe tradition states: According to the *Great Treasury*, when heaven and earth first parted, there were already men and women.\nTo sustain life, each coveted accumulation.\nThrough accumulation, they began to encroach and steal.\nTo prevent theft, they collectively chose one.\nThe wise established him as king, to administer rewards and punishments, calling it equity.\nThus, the use of rewards and punishments is not a matter of today.\n\nOf old, the elder Wang was most courageous. He often lamented that rewards and punishments were unjust, leaving him to grow old in the ranks. Whenever he heard of strange or monstrous affairs, he would clench his fists and gnash his teeth, longing to eradicate them. Having long heard of the numinous wonders of the Guardian Sage Perfected Lord, he sought to leave the mortal register, daily offering incense and fire. Morning and evening, he would bow twice before the hall, crying out in a loud voice: *\"I cannot abide injustice. Now I am old, and when my body dies, I wish to serve at your side, ready to be commanded.\"* The Perfected Lord granted his request.\n\nYears after his death, when a ritual feast was held in the hall, a voice suddenly sounded from the air: *\"Why not summon my Daoist?\"* Zhang Shouzhen said: *\"Beneath the Perfected Lord, only four attendants have ever been venerated. What deity are you? I beg you to reveal your name.\"* After a moment, the voice spoke again: *\"I am the elder Wang of former days. The Perfected Lord has taken me in, appointing me to wield the iron wheel, my rank below the Four Generals. In future rites, do not forget me.\"*\n\nAlas! Wang made his vow thus, and the Perfected Lord’s acceptance was thus—who can say that unjust rewards and punishments escape the knowledge of the Perfected on High? Generally, rewards encourage merit, while punishments chastise evil. Without rewards and punishments, how can one encourage or chastise? This is why the Supreme One inscribed them in the scripture, and why the Perfected Lord took in Wang.\n\nLet me recount one or two more examples, that those who wield military authority hereafter may know what to emulate.\n\nDuring the campaign against Liu Xu, soldiers vied to carry severed heads, seeking rewards. Chancellor Bao said: *\"In the heat of battle, who has time to claim heads? These must have been cut from the dead afterward. Who knows whose they are?\"* Duan Lun replied: *\"Your Excellency’s words are truly divine.\"* At the time, Duan served as vanguard, and those who charged into the enemy’s ranks were all wounded. The commander-in-chief had already ordered them to report to camp for commendation. The chancellor said: *\"Bring them all here.\"* When they arrived, he first recorded the merits of those who had fought valiantly, then those who bore heads. Thereupon, the army’s morale soared, deeming the rewards and punishments perfectly just, and they rejoiced as one.\n\nDuring the Ganling campaign, only the Ding troops clamored for rewards, their resentment nearly erupting in protest beneath the city walls. At the time, Han Wei Gong commanded the army. Applying military law, he identified those who had caused disorder and could not be disciplined, dragging them to the camp gate to be beheaded. For soldiers who died in battle, he generously compensated their families, providing for their orphans and ensuring their sustenance. With trust in both grace and authority, the troops’ morale redoubled.\n\nCan rewards and punishments, then, be anything but impartial?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nRewards and punishments lie with Heaven—blessing the good, calamity the wicked.\nRewards and punishments lie with man—steadfast as stone and metal.\nThey bring it upon themselves; why should I bear the burden?\nIf chastisement and encouragement are misapplied, chaos and ruin follow.\nClear proof and great verification are recorded in ancient and modern times.\n\n---\n\n**Excessive Pleasure**\n\nThe tradition states: The Venerable Monk Zhigong and Emperor Wu of Liang discussed matters of pleasure. The monk requested the emperor to bring forth several condemned prisoners to test his theory. Thereupon, he ordered the prisoners each to hold a full cup of water and walk around the courtyard. He warned: *\"If not a drop spills, I shall spare your lives.\"* Then he commanded music to be played, to stir their hearts. After a long while, he observed them—none had spilled a drop.",

      "translated_text": "One day, while hosting a banquet, the front of his robe came undone, and he could not fasten it himself. Chén Fèngyí stepped forward to secure it, and the Lord turned slightly to smile at her. Fèngyí said, \"So Your Lordship does glance at others after all.\" From then on, his heart was at ease, and he spoke with her often. Rumors spread, and the court dispatched the imperial censor Hé Tán to investigate in secret. When Tán arrived in Hànzhōu, he saw among the courtesans one surnamed Yáng, whose dancing was exceptionally graceful. Someone remarked in passing, \"This must be the famed *Yáng tái liǔ*.\" The words spread until they reached the emperor’s ears.\n\nIf even in moments of leisure and pleasure one must be so cautious, how much more so for others? If these two lords—men of such standing—could not avoid fault, what of those beneath them?\n\nDù Yǎn, the Duke of Integrity, when dining at home, would take but a single dish and a single bowl of rice. If someone remarked on his frugality, he would say, \"I was once a poor scholar. My rank, longevity, and fortune—all my robes and emblems—belong to the state. Should I depart this life, I would return to being a poor scholar. How then could I indulge myself?\"\n\nFàn Zhòngyān, the Duke of Culture, once said of himself: \"Each night before sleep, I tally the day’s expenses for food and comfort, then review what I have accomplished. If the two balance, I sleep soundly, free of shame. If not, I toss and turn, unable to rest.\"\n\nLǚ Gōngzhù, the Duke of Application, often declared: \"Fine robes ill befit a man of restraint; a full granary seems to fear the books in one’s belly.\"\n\nFù Zhègōng, the Duke of Wealth, likewise said: \"Guard your words as you would a sealed jar; guard your thoughts as you would a fortified city.\"\n\nSuch vigilance leaves no room for indulgence, let alone excess. One must recognize that the conduct of the ancients was ever thus—not merely the words of these two masters.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nDwelling without seeking ease,\nEven benevolence demands effort.\nGreat Yǔ rode a sled,\nTáo Kǎn moved his bricks.\nChǔ’s calamity brought daily warnings,\nThe *Book of Changes* urged evening vigilance.\nWho am I to lounge in comfort,\nCareless in sleep and food?\nThe sages of old left their teachings—\nAn inch of time is worth a foot of jade.\n\nAs for cruelty to subordinates: The *Traditions* say, \"To serve in office yet harshly oppress officials and commoners, or to manage a household yet excessively beat servants and maids—this is cruelty.\" Have you not heard of Wáng Jùnkuàng’s father, who in his entire official career never struck anyone unjustly? He had eight sons, all of whom entered the civil service, and Jùnkuàng himself became the empire’s finest scholar.\n\nHave you not also heard of Yuán Láng’s mother, who in life excessively beat her servants and maids, and after death fell into hell, suffering every torment? These are clear examples of karmic retribution, warnings not to be ignored.\n\nThere are those who beat their pregnant concubines—before the child in her womb is even born, it has already suffered harm. To cut off a man’s descendants is no small sin. They lament their own lack of heirs, yet others have them—this is the work of cause and effect. If you insist on having an heir, can you truly force one to come? If you insist on preventing one, can you truly stop it? The matter of descendants is grave, and bestowal or denial rests with Heaven. Creation has its own mysteries.\n\nLong ago, Fèi Xiàoxiān was renowned for his divination by shadows. Once, the ceremonial officer Yáng Shàoyán visited his shop to consult the oracle. Examining the shadow, Xiàoxiān saw two women giving birth to a single child. Shàoyán was astonished and confessed, \"I have long struggled to have a son, so I took a concubine. Now she is with child, but my wife is also pregnant—could this be the meaning?\" Xiàoxiān said, \"Let us wait and see.\" When the concubine went into labor at midnight, no one was available, so the wife herself held her as she gave birth—yet afterward, the wife’s own pregnancy had vanished. Was it that the concubine was fated to bear a son, but the wife, unable to remain silent, also conceived, merely to appease her own heart? The workings of creation are wondrous indeed.\n\nThe Buddha taught: \"Those who, in wealth and high position, delight in whipping and beating others, after death fall into hell for tens of thousands of years, suffering every agony. When their hellish punishment ends, they are reborn as water buffaloes, their noses pierced with ropes, made to pull boats and carts, beaten with great cudgels to repay their past deeds.\" He also said: \"Those who develop festering sores on their bodies do so because they once whipped and beat living beings.\"\n\nIf even servants and maids must not be treated cruelly, how much less so a pregnant concubine? The Buddha’s words are thus, and the Most High’s words are the same—how can one not take heed?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nFrom dukes and ministers to scholars and commoners,\nEach rank follows in succession.",

At every feast, she never left his side, and for this he drew censure, which reached the court’s ears. When Lord Lù succeeded him, he sternly corrected such lapses.

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, no governance was more excellent than ensuring the people’s peace. When wild geese return to roost and serpents coil in hibernation, all is settled. Yet when cruel officials raise their voices in clamor, even the stoutest tremble in terror, their gall bladders frozen with fear. The virtuous find their qi stifled, and a hundred dreads assail them. Who bears this responsibility? The officials charged with nurturing the people.\n\nTo blame Heaven and resent others—\nAs the saying goes: The Jambudvīpa world is ever flawed and wanting. How can those who dwell within it expect every matter to conform to their wishes? That which does not conform is simply their lot. For in general, those who accumulate little receive little in return. Yet can Heaven truly be blamed? Can others truly be resented? Such grievances bring no benefit; they only hasten one’s own misfortune.\n\nLong ago, Hu Ang, fallen into destitution and idleness, often drowned his sorrows in drink, cursing Heaven for his repeated failures in the imperial examinations. In the early years of the Taiping Xingguo era, while traveling through the Hebei region, a sheet of black paper suddenly descended from the sky, landing before his horse. Hu Ang retrieved it and saw that it bore golden characters in celestial script—a rebuke from the August Emperor. Well-versed in seal script, he read it through, then scoffed, \"What nonsense!\" He tore it to shreds, cast it aside, and spurred his horse onward. In an instant, dark clouds gathered, rain poured down, and with a single thunderclap, both man and steed collapsed. Hu Ang was struck dead. His servant gathered their belongings and rushed to the nearest inn, only to find the sky clear and the sun shining, not a trace of cloud or shadow.\n\nJiao Junming, a Gentleman for Literary Composition, passed the examinations in his youth but languished in office for years. Bitter over his misfortune, he railed against Heaven and later submitted a memorial in prayer. That very night, a scroll of white silk fluttered down before his brazier. Upon close inspection, he saw sixteen characters in celestial script. Unable to decipher them, he heard that the immortal He Xiangu possessed the Dao and took the scroll to her. She said, \"This is celestial script; there is no need to ask.\" But Junming pleaded, so she relented: \"It reads: *You accepted five taels of silver, which cost you ten years. Wrongfully killing one person—your retribution awaits after death.*\" Had this truly occurred? Junming was left speechless, unable to respond.\n\nOne must reflect upon oneself and not rashly blame or resent others.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo seek alliances among the feudal lords, yet cast aside the tortoise oracle and curse—\nYuan Shao’s defeat at Guandu, for which Tian Feng was not spared—\nZhuge Liang’s failure at Mount Qi, where he bitterly reproached himself—\nZixia, counting his faults, received the lesson with reverence.\nObserve these men: who was wise, and who was not?\n\n**Cursing wind and rain—**\nAs the saying goes: Confucius said, \"When violent thunder and fierce winds arise, one must change one’s demeanor.\" He also said, \"When there is a great wind, violent thunder, or torrential rain, one must change.\" Even in the dead of night, he would rise, dress properly, and sit upright—such was his awe of Heaven. How can the common folk, in summer’s scorching rain or winter’s biting cold, do nothing but complain?\n\nFew understand that wind is the messenger of Heaven and Earth. Heaven has eight winds, corresponding to the eight solar terms, through which yin and yang transform and the myriad things are nurtured. Thus, the sage kings aligned with the eight winds, enacted the eight policies, and accorded with the eight trigrams. On the day of *Lichun*, the *Tiaofeng* arrives—pardon minor offenses and release those detained. On the day of *Chunfen*, the *Mingshu Feng* arrives—rectify borders and cultivate fields. On the day of *Lixia*, the *Qingming Feng* arrives—present gifts of silk and honor the feudal lords. On the day of *Xiazhi*, the *Jingfeng* arrives—appoint great generals and reward the meritorious. On the day of *Liqiu*, the *Liangfeng* arrives—repay all debts and sacrifice to the four directions. On the day of *Qiufen*, the *Changhe Feng* arrives—release prisoners and refrain from playing zithers. On the day of *Lidong*, the *Buzhou Feng* arrives—repair city walls and defend frontier towns. On the day of *Dongzhi*, the *Guangmo Feng* arrives—punish the guilty and impose major penalties.\n\nRain is the messenger of the River Earl. His spirit wears white robes and a black cap, riding a white horse with a red mane. His host is divided into two battalions: one called the *Left Falling Thousand*, the other the *Right Falling Thousand*. Each battalion commands fifty thousand troops, massed at the edge of the clouds. They scatter the seeds of rain, with the rain troops leading and the wind chariots following. The quantity of rain is precisely measured.\n\nThere are two kinds of rain seeds: one resembles horse-tooth saltpeter, called *dry rain*; the other is stored in two small jars—this is the common rain that falls when the world lacks water.\n\nThe Most High said: Since I brought forth Heaven and Earth, I have been called the Primordial Beginning, the Void Sovereign. In rain, I am the Rain Master; in wind, I am the Wind Earl. Can one then curse the passing of wind and rain?\n\nLong ago, when the Grand Duke served as magistrate of Guantan, for a full year not a single branch stirred in the wind. One night, King Wen dreamed of a beautiful woman weeping in the road, saying, \"I am the Most High’s divine maiden of the Eastern Sea, wed to the Western Sea. Guantan lies upon my path home, but its magistrate is so virtuous that I dare not pass with violent wind and torrential rain. When may I return?\" The next day, King Wen summoned the Grand Duke. No sooner had he left the prefecture than the wind and rain descended in full force.\n\nDo those who curse wind and rain possess virtue like the Grand Duke?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nIn the age of Yao and Shun, ten rains and five winds came in due season.\nThe *Hongfan* records omens: \"mad\" and \"deluded.\"\nWhen human affairs are not tended, calamities arise.\nRevere Heaven’s wrath, approach with solemn awe.\nTo do nothing but complain—such is the sorrow of the common folk.\n\n**Quarrels and lawsuits—**\nAs the saying goes: Master Zeng said, \"To be wronged and not retaliate.\"\nLaozi said, \"The superior person does not contend.\"\nThe Buddha said, \"I have attained the samadhi of non-contention, foremost among men.\" He also said, \"Of the six perfections and ten thousand practices, forbearance is foremost.\"\n\nLong ago, Zhang Gongyi’s family lived in harmony for nine generations. Emperor Gaozong visited his home and asked the secret of their unity. Gongyi wrote the character \"forbearance\" in response. The emperor was moved to tears and bestowed upon him bolts of silk before departing.\n\nThus, when faced with injustice, forbearance is the way. Without forbearance, conflict arises; unchecked, it escalates into strife. Taking disputes to the authorities may lead to imprisonment, flogging, or torture—even broken skin and severed limbs.",

Soon, they exhaust their family wealth, sell their fields and gardens to sustain the fight, neglecting their parents, losing their wives’ affection, and failing to educate their children. Day after day, they rush between courtrooms, at the mercy of officials and clerks. Even if they possess grand halls and spacious homes, how can they dwell in peace? Warm clothes and ample food—how can they enjoy them? Alas, as lawsuits escalate, grudges deepen, like wildfire spreading across the plains, impossible to extinguish. Had they endured the initial grievance, they would never have reached such an extreme.\n\nYet some disputes arise from necessity, and none can entirely avoid them. But those who incite conflict, teaching others to litigate for profit, seeking only to satisfy their own desires—I have never seen such men escape misfortune, nor spare their descendants from its consequences.\n\nLet me now speak of one or two who resolved disputes and quelled strife, that those who wish to mediate may find no obstacle, and those who mediate may succeed.\n\nThe *Sutra of Encounters* states: \"There are two kinds of giving—giving of wealth, which exists among men, and giving of the Dharma, which exists within great compassion.\" If the merit of Dharma-giving is not slight, then when two parties rage in conflict, a single word of mediation that brings them both peace is also a form of Dharma-giving.\n\nLong ago, Li Wujiang was transferred to an official post in the Eastern Capital. Passing through Zhu Xian Town, he saw two beggars fighting in the road. One cried, \"I begged all year to save a few hundred coins, and you borrowed them, refusing to repay!\" Wujiang, seeing their violent struggle, paid the debt with his own money. One beggar departed, while the other said, \"Sir, you have resolved our fight—you are truly a good man. I live in Longhe Alley; if you visit me someday, I will surely repay you.\" Wujiang had already traveled several miles when he thought, \"He is but a beggar—how could he reward me?\" Yet upon reaching the Eastern Capital, he found time to seek him out. Indeed, he found the man and was invited into his home. The beggar offered him wine, but Wujiang declined. He then presented peaches, and though Wujiang politely refused, he took two and placed them in his sleeve. On the road, he examined them and found they were made of gold.\n\nCui Wei, at Kaiyuan Temple, saw an old beggar woman stumble and knock over a wine vendor’s jar. The vendor beat her mercilessly. Wei hurried to intervene, asking, \"How much was the wine worth?\" The vendor replied, \"One string of cash.\" Wei immediately removed his robe and paid the debt. The old woman left without a word of thanks. Days later, he encountered her again on the road, and she said, \"Yesterday, you resolved my trouble—I cannot forget your kindness. I am skilled in treating growths and warts. Here is a small bundle of Yuejinggang mugwort as a token of gratitude. If you encounter such ailments, use it to cauterize them—one treatment, and they will heal.\" Later, Wei met a monk with a growth dangling from his ear. One cauterization, and it vanished. The monk led him to a wealthy household where the master suffered from a similar growth. One treatment, and it was cured. From then on, Wei’s reputation spread, and many sought his help. Soon, he became a man of wealth, yet he never forgot the old woman, thinking of her day and night. One day, he met someone who told him, \"That old woman was Bao Gu, daughter of Bao Jing and wife of Ge Hong. She has practiced this moxibustion in Nanhai for many years.\"\n\nThus, when witnessing disputes, should one fan the flames or seek to extinguish them?\n\nIn praise I say:",

Without forbearance, conflict arises; unchecked, it escalates into strife. Taking disputes to the authorities may lead to imprisonment, flogging, or torture—even broken skin and severed limbs.",

      "translated_text": "Words that strike at the heart of reason resolve disputes and dispel difficulties. Yet slander and deceit, though whispered, suffice to sow discord. When doubt and resentment gather among friends, regret and fault spread like creeping vines. The two noble scions’ quarrel ultimately brought calamity to the state. Alas! Glib tongues trade in fortune like merchants—recklessly chasing factions.\n\nThe *Scripture* states: The Supreme Lord, through the Twenty-Four Gates of Essential Methods for Governing Thought, instructed the Perfected One of Universal Salvation:\n\n- For those who delight in killing and harm, govern with compassion.\n- For thieves and robbers, govern with justice and sharing.\n- For the licentious and dissolute, govern with chastity.\n- For the miserly and grasping, govern with generosity.\n- For the wrathful and contentious, govern with joy.\n- For the deluded and confused, govern with expedient means.\n- For frivolous and ornate speech, govern with simplicity and rectitude.\n- For false and deceitful words, govern with trust and compliance.\n- For harsh curses and maledictions, govern with recitation and invocation.\n- For divisive slander and abuse, govern with praise and admiration.\n- For those who drink wine and eat meat, govern with fasting and abstinence.\n- For defamation and disparagement, govern with discourse and exposition.\n- For arrogance and disdain, govern with reverence and prostration.\n- For rigidity and aggression, govern with softness and humility.\n- For disbelief in karma and past lives, govern with dependent origination.\n- For clinging to existence or nonexistence, govern with the Middle Way.\n- For partiality and self-interest, govern with equanimity.\n- For greed and filth, govern with purity.\n- For obstinacy and immobility, govern with cyclical change.\n- For ceaseless fabrication, govern with non-action.\n- For narrow adherence to convention, govern with all-pervading adaptability.\n- For restlessness and competition, govern with stillness and concentration.\n- For sorrow and discontent, govern with carefree ease.\n- For unrelieved affliction, govern with liberation.\n\nBy and large, the vices of the world are not easily eradicated. Thus, the Supreme Lord revealed these methods to teach restraint. Yet now, people recklessly pursue factions, indulging in frivolous speech, deceitful words, divisive slander, and partisan strife. Measured against these precepts, such conduct incurs the censure of the Supreme Lord.\n\nHave they not heard the *Discourse on Factions*? It states: The noble form factions through shared principles; the petty, through shared gain. A ruler need only dismiss the false factions of petty men and employ the true factions of the noble. The words of Ouyang Xiu may be called perfect.\n\nLong ago, the Khitans and the Xia clashed beyond the Yellow River. At the time, Lord Fan Wenzheng was ordered to pacify Hedong and requested troops for support. Duke Du Zhengxian argued that the Khitans were unlikely to come and that troops should not be rashly deployed. Wenzheng grew furious, even insulting Zhengxian, who bore no grudge. Later, the Khitans indeed did not come. If these two lords were labeled as factions by the vulgar, how could such discord in state affairs justify banishing factions?\n\nSima Junshi and Fan Jingren enjoyed profound harmony, each deeming the other unmatched. They once said: \"We share the same aspirations in life and the same legacy in death. In matters of employment or dismissal, we act in unison without prior consultation. On the three great affairs, our words seem as if spoken by one man, our actions as coordinated as left and right hands.\" They also declared: \"Jingren and I are brothers—our only difference is our surname.\" Yet when debating the tuning of bells, they endlessly disputed, never reaching accord. Thus, the noble know that though these two agreed, it was not blind agreement. How, then, could factions be banished?\n\nGenerally, whether at home or in the community, in matters great or small, one should defer to public judgment. How can factions be recklessly expelled on mere suspicion?\n\nIn praise I say:\nWords may be right or wrong—resolve them with reason.\nPeople may differ—judge them by their virtue.\nTo stand alone may seem upright, yet not all who do so are true gentlemen.\nWhen the Way aligns and aspirations converge, it must be the noble.\nDistinguish the upright from the crooked, and the question of factions is settled.\n\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Twenty-One, concludes.\n*Tai Shang Gan Ying Pian*, Scroll Twenty-Three.",

      "translated_text": "**The Transmission of Li Changling, with a Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi**\n\nTo abandon the proper and emulate the perverse.\n\nThe *Transmission* states: Shi Que said: \"The lowly encroaching upon the noble, the young overbearing the elder, the distant estranging the near, the new supplanting the old, the petty overriding the great, and lewdness subverting righteousness—these are the Six Perversions. The lord acting with justice, the minister with loyalty; the father with kindness, the son with filial piety; the elder brother with affection, the younger with respect—these are the Six Proprieties. To abandon the proper and emulate the perverse is to hasten calamity.\"\n\nGenerally, the discourse on propriety and perversion cannot surpass this. Formerly, Fan Wei, a great clansman of Chang’an, amassed vast wealth and falsely claimed the county magistrate of Wugong, Fan You, as his grandfather. When You held office as magistrate, he exempted Fan Wei’s household from corvée for over fifty years. Later, when western affairs arose, all lesser households were conscripted and levied, falling into dire straits—only Fan Wei remained untouched. When Liu Chang became prefect of Chang’an, he uncovered the matter, and Fan Wei was punished, his family’s property confiscated by the authorities.\n\nZhou Zong, having failed the examinations repeatedly, traveled to Qiao Commandery and bowed to the clerk Zhou Ji as his father, daily ranking among his sons. He adopted all three generations’ names and taboos as his own. The following year, he unexpectedly passed one examination, but his father reproached him in verse. Zhou Zong, deeply disheartened, died of shame and regret. Was this not a case of abandoning the proper and emulating the perverse? How lamentable that he never heard the words of the True Lord of the Southern Culmen, Longevity Star.\n\nThe Perfected of the Great Ultimate, Xu Laile, once encountered the True Lord of the Southern Culmen, Longevity Star, and inquired about matters of longevity, early death, fortune, and misfortune. The Star Lord said: \"The Way of Heaven blesses the good and calamitizes the lewd; the divine spirits reward the proper and punish the perverse. If you can devote yourself to goodness, revere yourself and align with Heaven, remain tranquil when the Dao is fitting, and act in accord with fortune, then your life rests with you—not controlled by the Lord of Death, nor seized by ghosts and spirits. You will not seek longevity yet attain it naturally; you will not pursue life yet preserve it effortlessly.\n\nBut if you undermine the moral order, defy Heaven and Earth, indulge in folly and rebellion, insult the divine spirits, oppose benevolence and kindness, and diminish loyalty and filial piety—then in the manifest, the net of punishment will bind you; in the hidden, ghosts and spirits will execute you. When death approaches and you speak of goodness, or when transgressions overflow and you seek repentance, it will be too late.\"\n\nJudging by the Star Lord’s words, can one truly abandon the proper and emulate the perverse?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nIn public, nothing is not proper; in private, nothing is not perverse.\nPublic conduct stems from principle and righteousness; private conduct arises from the heart’s whims.\nSubduing emotion to follow principle, all endeavors remain upright.\nA single errant thought, and ten thousand affairs are overturned.\nFortune favors the proper; misfortune befalls the perverse—this is the Emperor’s standard.\n\nTo turn from kin toward the distant.\n\nThe *Transmission* states: Confucius said: \"One who does not love their kin but loves others is called perverse in virtue. One who does not respect their kin but respects others is called perverse in ritual.\" Generally, the distinction between kin and the distant must be made clear. One must not fail to guard against perversity in ritual and virtue.\n\nFormerly, Shen Jizhong, the bedchamber son of Xuan Yilang Qi, had a grandmother who was the paternal aunt of Hanlin Academician Yang Yuansu. At the time, Yuansu had a son afflicted with illness who could not manage affairs. When Jizhong was born, Yuansu, due to their kinship, took him as his own son. Later, Yuansu had two more sons in succession, and Jizhong, though aware of his origins, remained silent and dared not speak. He redoubled his filial devotion, ensuring no slander or estrangement entered between them, and Yuansu grew to love him. On two occasions when Yuansu recommended him for office, Jizhong firmly declined, insisting the positions go to his two younger brothers. He vowed to advance through the examination system by his own efforts. In the fifth year of Yuanfeng, he indeed passed the imperial examinations.\n\nSeveral years after placing, Yuansu died in Yuhang. Jizhong escorted his coffin home, observed the full mourning rites, then arranged marriages for his younger brothers and sisters, selecting reputable families. Once all was settled, he handed over the entire family estate to his two brothers and departed with nothing. He also composed a treatise, *On Returning to One’s Lineage*, several thousand words long, to show his relatives. In essence, he argued that the kindness of one’s birth parents and adoptive parents is equal. Having repaid his adoptive parents, he could not neglect his birth parents.\n\nAfter returning, he paid respects to his father and mother and sought out his birth mother, née Du. After a long search, he found her in a humble alley, her face unwashed, her feet bound, barely surviving. Mother and son embraced and wept bitterly, moving all who witnessed it. Twenty years later, his parents died. After observing the full mourning rites, he returned all his ancestral lands to his elder brothers and left empty-handed, renting a house to live in. When urged to accept even a small portion, Jizhong firmly refused, saying: \"The Yang family’s wealth was ten times this, yet I cast it aside like a worn-out sandal. How could I bear to take anything from my brothers’ livelihood to enrich myself?\" The scholarly community universally admired him.\n\nAt the time, Xu Guangyi, serving as Transport Commissioner, recommended him to the court. An imperial edict praised him and granted him an official post, appointing him as Supervisor of Schools in the Yongxing and other circuits. Shortly after, he died. Xu Guangyi, along with Xuanhe Hall Academician Xue Sichang and Drafter of the Central Secretariat Yuwen Huangzhong, jointly memorialized the throne, and a second edict was issued, granting an official post to one of his sons.\n\nAlas! How many in the world are like Jizhong? Truly, he was one who knew how to conduct himself rightly.\n\n**Eulogy:**",

      "translated_text": "Of all human bonds, none are closer than those between parent and child. Brothers share the same qi, like feet and hands. Extending this principle, the clan expands to nine degrees of kinship. Though their ranks may differ, the affection and duty between them ought to be profound. To abandon them and turn elsewhere is to act contrary to virtue—what good could come of it?\n\nOne may invoke Heaven and Earth to attest to one’s sincerity. As the tradition states: Heaven has thirty-two modes of covering, Earth has thirty-two modes of bearing; Heaven covers, Earth bears, each governing its own qi. Humanity dwells between them—fortune follows compliance, misfortune defiance, the response as swift as an echo. Even with utmost caution and reverence, one still fears incurring fault; how much more so if one rashly invokes Heaven and Earth to attest to one’s own base sentiments—is this not blasphemy?\n\nIn former times, the father of Wang Yigong, though unlearned himself, was devoted to scholars of the classics. Whenever he encountered discarded paper, he would gather and cleanse it, then store it in scented water. Once, he made a vow: “May my descendants achieve prominence through literary accomplishment.” One night, he dreamed that the Sage Confucius patted his back and said, “How diligently you honor my teachings! Yet you are already aged, with no hope of personal achievement—thus I shall send Zeng Shen to be reborn in your family.” In his later years, he indeed had a son, who was none other than Yigong. He named the child *Zeng* after the disciple, and the boy eventually passed the imperial examinations as *zhuangyuan*, rising to the rank of Vice Director of the Secretariat and Grand Councilor.\n\nLi Jingxun’s mother, née Zheng, was strict in educating her sons. One day, a wall collapsed, revealing a jar of coins. Lady Zheng burned incense and prayed: “Could it be that Heaven and Earth pity us, mother and sons, in our orphaned and widowed state, and have bestowed this upon us? Yet my sole wish is that my sons complete their studies, enter officialdom, and receive their salaries—this money is not what I desire.” She then buried it again. Later, Jingxun indeed passed the examinations and rose to the position of Junior Guardian of the Heir Apparent.\n\nAlas!

      "translated_text": "The tradition holds that coercive oaths are not heard by the spirits. When the people of Qin cursed Chu, their virtue was not strong enough. The invocators falsely raised their pleas, yet through fear they amended their governance. When Zheng did not perform rites to avert fire, Kong Ning prayed for illness. The spirits are keen of hearing and upright—how could flattery with the mouth suffice? To give and then regret it.\n\nIt is recorded: During the *Mingdao* era, the Taiping Prefecture suffered consecutive droughts and locust plagues, leaving the people severely lacking in food. Suddenly, a kind of dark grass grew in the mountains and marshes, which the people gathered to eat, relying on it to stave off hunger. In the *Zhidao* era, the Huanqing Circuit faced famine, and the five grains failed to sprout. Suddenly, artemisia spread across the fields, bearing seeds like millet that could fill the stomach. At the beginning of the *Xining* era, the Huaizhe Circuit suffered famine. Suddenly, mushrooms grew across the fields, sweet and soft, quite delicious, and could be made into soup. During the *Yuanfeng* era, Qingzhou and Zizhou experienced great famine. Suddenly, a kind of stone flour appeared among the mountain rocks; mixed with a little flour, it could be made into cakes. In the *Shengli* era, Zizhou faced a severe famine. The Perfected Lord of True Martiality transformed into an old man, entering the city daily to sell steamed cakes, aiding many. At the end of the *Jianlong* era, the Hebei Circuit suffered famine. He again transformed into a merchant, transporting 150,000 *hu* of millet and wheat into the city. When the goods arrived, the merchant vanished; the officials took them to provide relief, extending aid to several neighboring prefectures.\n\nGenerally, famine and scarcity are disasters and the workings of fate, but the growth of such things is the original intent of Heaven and Earth. The Perfected Lord’s actions were likewise the intent of Heaven and Earth. Now, those who receive the harmony of Heaven and Earth, embody the image of Heaven and Earth, yet lack the heart of Heaven and Earth—how can they be called human? It is lamentable that they do not know how superior persons conduct themselves in the world: with great compassion, impartiality, and the virtue of universal salvation. To extinguish one life and give rise to another is to ascend to the supreme fruit. Have they not heard of the deeds of Zhou Huihua and others?\n\nZhou Huihua was fond of aiding the poor and distressed, enduring hardship without weariness. One day, the Perfected Lord of Wise Observation transformed into a beggar, begging for food in the streets to test his resolve. Zhou indeed delighted in giving, so that very day he was delivered and is now the Perfected Lord of Western Florescence. Liu Kuan was fond of helping the poor and never neglected this duty; as a result, he was recorded by the Most High and now serves as the Marshal of the Youthful Beginning Prefecture, overseeing those who first embark on the Dao. He warned against the dangers of hoarding wealth, urging that one should not惜千金, but rather give freely until nothing remains. The Lord on High praised him and granted him deliverance from the world. Liu Baiyun was also wealthy but initially knew nothing of cultivating the Dao. However, he delighted in giving and did not惜钱帛. Eventually, he encountered the Perfected Lord of Joy, who transmitted the essentials of the Dao to him, allowing him to ascend as an immortal.\n\nHow worthy are these men, who through their joy in giving swiftly attained the supreme fruit! Has there ever been one who gave and then regretted it, yet still achieved such rank? Know that the act of giving is the swiftest way to establish merit. Even if one does not immediately attain the fruit, they will surely receive their reward. Have they not heard of the deeds of Lord Yang and others?\n\nYang Boyong was fond of offering righteous libations. One day, he encountered an extraordinary person who gave him a pint of jade seeds; his descendants all became greatly wealthy and noble. The three brothers Pei Yannian all delighted in generous giving. One day, an old man came to their door begging for a drink, and the brothers treated him with utmost respect. The old man said: “I see that you brothers are all virtuous men. With such accumulated virtue, how could you lack good fortune?” During the An Lushan rebellion, they were led by the old man into a cave, thus escaping the calamity of war. Later, the brothers all attained high office, and their entire families lived past a hundred years.\n\nXi Baisan was originally a poor man. One day, he saw a Daoist approach a shopkeeper, begging for a single copper coin, but the shopkeeper refused with a scowl. Baisan, indignant on the Daoist’s behalf, reached into his own belt and gave him a coin. That night, he dreamed the Daoist gave him a jade pendant. When he awoke, the pendant had indeed appeared on his chin.\n\nTang Shumi had been dead for several days when he appeared in his grandson’s dream, saying: “Though I was harsh and narrow-minded in life, I committed no great transgressions. This year, the harvest is poor. If you could open the granary to relieve the people, it would be far better than performing Buddhist rites for me, and I would also benefit.” His grandson that very day gave five hundred *shi* of rice to the county magistrate Sun Kuang for distribution. That night, he dreamed again of Tang Shumi, who smiled and said: “I have now ascended to Heaven.”\n\nAll these are examples of those who delighted in giving and each received their due reward. Can those who give and then regret it hope for the same?",

      "translated_text": "The Buddha said: In the single act of giving food, five kinds of blessed rewards may be obtained. The first is the gift of life. The reward for this gift is longevity and boundless wealth in every lifetime. When a person lacks food, they will surely die within seven days; if I provide it, I restore them to life—this is called the gift of life. The second is the gift of beauty. The reward for this gift is a flawless appearance in every lifetime, bringing joy to all who see it. When a person lacks food, their complexion must wither; if I provide it, I restore their radiance—this is called the gift of beauty. The third is the gift of strength. The reward for this gift is great vigor in every lifetime, never diminishing. When a person lacks food, they must grow weak; if I provide it, I restore their strength—this is called the gift of strength. The fourth is the gift of peace. The reward for this gift is safety and stability in every lifetime, free from disaster and misfortune. When a person lacks food, they must suffer distress and peril; if I provide it, I restore their peace—this is called the gift of peace. The fifth is the gift of eloquence. The reward for this gift is wisdom and fluency in every lifetime, with words that others heed. When a person lacks food, they are too weary to speak; if I provide it, I restore their voice—this is called the gift of eloquence.\n\nHow great indeed! If the single act of giving food already yields five such rewards, how much greater must be the blessings for all acts of giving, in every circumstance where giving is due?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nTo walk the Way in search of fortune,\nto move grain in hope of the people’s favor—\ngiving only to seek reward,\nthe hegemon feigns benevolence.\nSeeking fame abroad,\ntheir pretense is not sincere.\nShould their schemes falter,\nthey curse Heaven and blame others.\nWhen the five grains fail to ripen,\neven chaff and millet become precious.\nTo borrow and not repay—\nas the saying goes: in this world, many act thus.\nHow could they know that though they may not repay in life,\nthey must repay after death?\n\nThere was an official named Chen Yi who borrowed two hundred thousand coins from Wu Zongsi but refused to return them. Wu reproached him, saying: “If I owed you money in a past life, I repay it now with this. If I did not owe you, but you owe me, then you must become a donkey to repay me.” A year later, Wu sat alone in his hall when he suddenly saw Chen Yi arrive, carrying the money to repay him. Not realizing Chen was dead, Wu called out to question him, but Chen had already slipped into the stable—his tracks vanished. Soon after, a mare gave birth to a foal. Upon inquiry, Wu learned that Chen Yi had indeed died that very day.\n\nZhang and Chen had a daughter named Fo’er, fifteen years old, who suddenly died. After half a day, she revived and said: “At first, two ghosts seized me and took me past Bi Cliff. Then I saw two other ghosts wrapping two people in a black blanket and carrying them to the Chen household. Next, they wrapped a servant in a patterned blanket, saying: ‘You owe this family fifteen hundred coins—now you must repay them.’ Suddenly, a figure in green appeared and said: ‘This person has also awakened to prajñā; let us forgive her misstep.’ At once, she fell into a pond and awoke with a start.” The next day, her father went to Bi Cliff to investigate and found a Chen family who that night had given birth to three puppies—one brindle and two black. The brindle one had accidentally fallen into a pond and drowned. Hurrying home, he took the money and repaid the Chen household, but they refused to accept it.",

At the time, the Perfected Lord of Auspicious Aid descended to speak on Mount Zhongnan, and Gang, bearing incense, came to inquire. The Perfected Lord said: “Your writing is fine, yet your fate is meager. If you accept your lot and withdraw, you may preserve your remaining years. Should you seek beyond measure, your life will be cut short.” Gang did not believe him and ultimately died without achievement.\n\nThus, rank and degree are indeed fixed by fate. Even a single degree cannot be sought and gained.\n\nLord Wu, an official who rose to the rank of Grand Master, was over seventy when he prepared to retire. One night, he dreamed a spirit told him: “You still have seven hundred thousand in salary unclaimed from your post.” At dawn, he examined his records and found the sum exact. He warned his sons and nephews not to claim it, and they obeyed, making no mention of it. Soon after, he died. His descendants sighed: “Were dreams not to be trusted?” That very night, he dreamed again of the spirit, who said: “After resigning your cap, did you not claim half your salary? Was that not seven hundred thousand?” His descendants were stunned, their regret too late.\n\nThus, lifespan and emolument are indeed fixed by fate. Even what one is due cannot be fully possessed.\n\nWhen Xiahou Jiazhen had not yet passed the examinations, a boy named Liu who was skilled in physiognomy once told him: “You will attain high office through reputation, but all else is weak. Beyond your salary, you will receive a hundred taels of ill-gotten gain—unless you fall ill, you will die.” Later, Jiazhen rose to become Remonstrator and Straight Historian. Sent as an envoy to celebrate the Prince of Yi’s birthday, he received several hundred thousand in gifts. As he returned home to store them, intending to renovate his house, a single string of cash suddenly rose from the ground and stood upright for a long while before toppling. Startled, he fell ill and died.\n\nThus, every coin and ingot is indeed fixed by fate. Even ill-gotten gains cannot be possessed.\n\nHave you not heard of the Underworld’s *Lüesheng* Enforcers?

As recorded by Li Xuzhou, this is plainly evident. During the Jiayou era, Shen Yu governed Hangzhou. At every weir he passed, oxen were assembled to haul boats. It was the height of summer, and from the supervising officials down to the lowest clerks, all slept exposed upon the weirs, awaiting the ebb and flow of water. Suddenly, they heard voices calling one another by birth order: \"What work awaits us tomorrow?\" One replied, \"Tomorrow Shen Ji’s son will pass through—he who governs Hangzhou. We shall have another round of toil.\" Another asked, \"Has Shen Ji so soon a son governing Hangzhou?\" At this, they broke into sobs and lamentations. The officials, struck by the uncanny tone of their speech, sent men to investigate and found only several weir-oxen. Seeing one shed tears, they sighed deeply: \"Who knows but that these oxen were once kin or acquaintances of Shen Ji?\" Xuzhou heard of this and recorded it in large script as a warning against \"imposing toil above,\" yet many remain heedless.\n\nFormerly, Lu Bing served as Salt Transport Commissioner and dug a new canal solely for salt barges. Autumn rains fell without cease, and the harvest remained unfinished. Yet Bing daily pressed thousands of laborers to dig through mud and rain, driving them relentlessly. The people suffered greatly. Dongpo composed a poem on the matter, including the lines: \"Like swine and ducks, they are flung into the mire, splashing and startling one another\"—from which the cruelty of their treatment is clear.

Their spirit possesses 36,000 primordial yang qi, originally weighing 384 *zhu*, corresponding internally to *Qian*. If one fails to preserve it, allowing it to dissipate, they will meet an untimely end midway.\n\n*Qian* embodies the six yang forces before any movement or expenditure. Those who understand this and cultivate accordingly become immortals.\n\nFrom age fifteen to twenty-five, unrestrained expenditure depletes 48 *zhu* of qi, leaving a state corresponding to *Gou*. If desires grow more intense over the next decade, another 48 *zhu* is lost, leaving a state corresponding to *Dun*. Without proper nurturing, another decade brings another loss of 48 *zhu*, leaving a state corresponding to *Pi*—here lies the central qi of Heaven and Earth. Without nurturing, another five years deplete 72 *zhu*, leaving a state corresponding to *Guan*. Another five years without nurturing deplete 96 *zhu*, leaving a state corresponding to *Bo*. Beyond this, the sixty-four hexagrams exhaust their qi, and primordial qi is spent entirely, corresponding to *Kun*.\n\n*Kun* is pure yin. Those who subsist on grains alone may yet linger, hence the term \"provisional longevity.\" At this stage, death is near.\n\nMoreover, the kidney chamber is the Mysterious Pass. Heart and kidney unite as one meridian, white as a thread, linked like a ring, spanning one *cun* and two *fen* in breadth. It encases the essence of the entire body, the wondrous qi of the Nine Heavens’ True Unity and Void Harmony, the deep root of life’s most refined vitality. The five viscera, six bowels, hundreds of joints and meridians, golden fluids and jade liquids, the radiance of sun and moon—all reside here. By preserving and consolidating it, the seas of the two regions respond to the rhythm of a single breath, their tides naturally arising to reach the Gate of Life.\n\nIn essence, *ren* is the foundation of life, and the kidneys are the lower palace of the Metal Chamber, hence called the Sea of Longevity.

Today’s people, however, reach but half a century, and their movements already weaken. Is this because the world has changed? Or have people lost something?\"\n\nQibo replied: \"The people of high antiquity, those who understood the Dao, modeled themselves upon yin and yang, harmonized with the arts of calculation, regulated their eating and drinking, maintained regularity in rising and resting, and did not recklessly exhaust themselves. Thus, their form and spirit remained united, and they fulfilled their natural lifespan, living past a hundred years before departing.\n\nToday’s people, however, take wine as their broth, treat recklessness as normal, enter the bedchamber while drunk, exhaust their essence with desire, dissipate their true qi, fail to preserve fullness, fail to govern their spirit, seek only to gratify their hearts, and act contrary to the joys of life. Their rising and resting lack regulation, and so they decline by fifty.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* also states: 'For long life, strictly guard the bedchamber.' The urgency of this lies precisely in the weight of beings’ karmic burdens. How lamentable that they do not know—women’s allure, as the Buddha taught, is the root of all suffering, the source of obstacles, the origin of killing and harm, the wellspring of sorrow. Thus, the enlightened keep far from it.\n\nRen Huigong grew stronger in his later years. When asked about his art of nurturing life, he said: 'I gained insight from reading the *Wen Xuan*.' Someone pressed: 'May I ask where the insight lay?' He replied: 'A stone that holds jade makes the mountain gleam; water that cradles a pearl makes the river radiant.'\n\nPu Chuanzheng, while serving as prefect of Hangzhou, was visited by an elder from his hometown named Li Jue, who was already a hundred years old yet had the glowing complexion of an infant.

It is not merely deceiving others but deceiving oneself.\n\nDo you not heed the teachings on the spirit of the heart?\nThe southern recluse Zhu Zhenbai said: \"The world speaks of not deceiving the gods and spirits. I say it is not the gods of heaven and earth one must not deceive, but the spirit of one’s own heart—then one does not deceive the gods and spirits.\"\nSomeone asked the old pedant: \"Should one serve the spirits?\"\nHe replied: \"Serve the spirit of your own heart. No millet, no sacrificial animals—only the practice of not deceiving is of use.\"\n\nAlas, how many truly understand this?\nBecause they do not, short measures and narrow gauges are but the least of their transgressions.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo bend a foot for a yard—this is what the noble man finds shameful.\nGoods that do not meet the measure shall not be sold in the market.\nNot a hair’s breadth of partiality, not a grain’s weight of discrepancy.\nHow dare one adorn the heart of a thief and cast aside public principle?\nWhat harm does it do to the measure? The harm to oneself is far greater.\n\n**Light scales and small measures.**\n**Commentary:**\nHeaven has its Hall of the Dipper and Scale, and man has his use of the dipper and scale. Among the twenty-eight constellations, it is the Star of Zhang that governs them. In this text, the Most High has decreed it a sin.\n\nGenerally, the *zhu* and *li*, the *sheng* and *ge*—these are the daily necessities of the common folk. Every coin, every cash is hard-won. Thus, not a *zhu*, not a *li*, not a *sheng*, not a *ge* may be made light or small.\n\nAccording to the *Cloud Script of the Five Thunders*, during the reign of Chen Houzhu, a man in the market was struck dead by lightning, and on his back were written the words: \"...\" The Daoist adept Li Juzheng recognized them as the four characters for \"light and heavy in scales and measures.\"\n\nFurthermore, in the *Lotus Sutra*, when the scripture was being expounded, ten rakshasa women, along with their children and retinues, made a solemn vow before the Buddha to protect this sutra, saying:\n\"Like the sin of killing one’s parents,\nLike the misfortune of pressing oil,\nLike the crime of cheating with scales and measures,\nLike Devadatta’s sin of splitting the Sangha—\nWhoever harms this Dharma-teacher\nShall incur such retribution.\"\n\nThus, are light scales and small measures truly a minor sin?\n\nFor this reason, Cheng Sichang did not use uneven scales and measures, and was recorded in the ledger of good deeds as having been inspected by the Perfected Warrior and True Lord.\nLi Yongzheng crafted scales that twisted in midair and bushels with false bottoms—these were condemned by the Supreme Emperor, who commanded local spirits to warn him openly and punish him in secret.\nYing Xianwu the Martial and Illustrious repeatedly ignored the warnings until both his eyes were blinded, his wife exiled, his son dead, and he himself reduced to begging in the streets.\n\nAll these are recorded in the annals—how can one not stand in awe?\n\n**Eulogy:**",

Chen pleaded his case repeatedly but found no justice, so he went to the shrine of Mount Yue and submitted a petition. Soon after, Mao died; the next day, Chen died as well. Later, Chen revived and said: \"In the courts of Mount Yue, Mao pleaded with me, saying: ‘In my life, I committed such acts thirteen times—all the contracts are in such-and-such a chest in such-and-such a place. When you return, urge my family to search for them and return each to its rightful owner. Only then may my punishment be lessened. Otherwise, my sins will only grow heavier.’\"\n\nZhang Gai owned a grand and stately residence. In need of funds, he mortgaged it to Zhang Jun for a thousand strings of cash. Jun coveted the house and bribed the broker to draft a deed of absolute sale. Once the contract was made, he swapped the first page to turn it into a deed of sale. Years later, when Gai lacked funds and sought to reclaim his property, Jun produced the contract—now a deed of sale. Gai was speechless, left in tears, and looking to the heavens, he cursed: \"May your descendants one day suffer as I do, unable even to speak their grievance.\" Later, Jun’s descendants all lost their voices and died.\n\nCan deceiving others be justified? Even if they are not foolish, it must never be done.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nMeet the blind with respect;\nenter an empty room as if others were present.\nIn darkness, guard your solitude;\nstep outside as if greeting a guest.\nLet your heart be without deceit,\nand regard all things with impartiality.\nThe people may be simple,\nbut even the foolish are watched by the divine.\nWho is more foolish than the common folk?\nThose who deceive themselves.\nGreed knows no bounds.\n\n**Tradition says:** Laozi said: \"He who knows contentment is rich.\" And again: \"No sin is greater than desire; no disaster greater than discontent.\" And: \"Which is dearer, name or self? Which is greater, self or wealth? Which is more harmful, gain or loss? Excessive love leads to great waste; hoarding invites heavy loss. Know contentment and avoid disgrace; know restraint and avoid danger—this is the way to longevity.\"\n\nMozi said: \"It is not that there is no secure dwelling, but no secure heart; not that there is no sufficient wealth, but no contented heart.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"The roc and the wren differ in size; the cedar and the morning mushroom differ in lifespan. Yet each finds its own peace, its own fulfillment.\" These are the words of sages and worthies—models for conduct in the face of wealth.\n\nAlas! People wear clothes only to cover their bodies, yet those draped in thousand-tael furs still feel lacking, unaware that those in patched robes are at ease. They eat only to fill their stomachs, yet those who feast on thousand-coin banquets still feel wanting, unaware that those content with simple fare are joyful. Houses exist only to shelter from wind and rain, yet those in towering mansions with carved walls still feel unsatisfied, unaware that those in huts with earthen windows are at peace. Utensils serve only their purpose, yet those who dine with jade cups and ivory chopsticks still feel deprived, unaware that those who drink from chipped vessels are content.\n\nBecause of this, the heart is never satisfied. How can one awaken to the truth that all things in this world vanish in an instant? This body of ours will ultimately perish. What does not perish is the single luminous essence. Rather than toiling in vain over what is transient, why not devote effort to what is eternal?\n\nLong ago, King Prasenajit asked Śākyamuni Buddha: \"Now that I am weighed down by age, I know I must perish.\" The Buddha said: \"Have you ever seen the waters of the Ganges?\" The king replied: \"When I was three, I saw them.\" The Buddha asked: \"Now that you are sixty, have you seen them again?\" The king said: \"I saw them just yesterday.\" The Buddha asked: \"How do they compare to what you saw at three?\" The king said: \"They are unchanged.\" The Buddha said: \"Though your face is wrinkled, your faculty of sight has never wrinkled. What wrinkles is subject to change; what does not wrinkle is beyond change. What changes must perish; what is beyond change was never born and never dies.\" The king was enlightened in that moment, realizing that after death, life does not cease but continues—there is no true annihilation.\n\nThe Third Patriarch, Śāṇavāsa, asked Upagupta: \"How old are you?\" Upagupta replied: \"I am seventeen.\" The Patriarch asked: \"Is your body seventeen, or is your nature seventeen?\" Upagupta said: \"Master, your hair is white—is it your hair that is white, or your mind?\" The Patriarch said: \"Only my hair is white, not my mind.\" Upagupta said: \"My body is seventeen, but my nature is not seventeen—it is the same.\"\n\nIn general, the body of birth and death cycles through existence, a wheel without beginning or end. Moreover, this flowing mind is unbroken—what appears as bubbles rising and vanishing is but delusion. From the first moment of consciousness to the last breath, it is all the same.",

The master, then in his cups, addressed the girls: \"You are as my own daughters—how dare I offend you?\" He personally sealed the door and confined them to a chamber. At dawn, he sought out their parents and returned them.",

      "translated_text": "\"In the *Rites of Zhou*, the five modes of hearing reveal nothing hidden in speech or countenance. How could mere words suffice? For therein lies the liver and kidneys. When rival states forge alliances, the king’s grace is thus extinguished. Excessive speech leads to repeated failure—better to endure with silence. If one heeds only the divine, how can trust be shown? Thus concludes the twenty-fourth scroll of the *Taishang Ganying Pian*.\n\n---\n\nThe *Taishang Ganying Pian*, Scroll Twenty-Eight\n*Biography of Li Changling*\n*Eulogy by Zheng Qingzhi*\n\nIt is said: Spitting or urinating toward the north—\n\nThe *Tradition* records: Yang Ziyun wrote an essay arguing that during the Spring and Autumn period, day and night were of equal length, for the sun rose due east at *mao* and set due west at *you*. Huan Tan, however, composed his *New Treatise* to refute him, saying: \"Ziyun’s argument refers to the *mao* and *you* of the human realm, not the celestial *mao* and *you*. The celestial *mao* and *you* align with the Northern Dipper’s pole. The pole is the Celestial Pivot; the pivot is the axis of heaven. Just as a canopy has its *baodou* (central pin), though the canopy turns, the *baodou* remains fixed—so too does the Northern Pole, though heaven revolves. From man’s perspective, the north is indeed north, yet not the true center of heaven. Thus, during the Spring and Autumn period, the sun’s rising and setting always occurred near the Southern Dipper. One must recognize that heaven turns like a canopy, its northern path ever distant, its southern path ever near. How could day and night have been equal? Ziyun, at a loss, could not rebut him. From this, we know all the more that the Dipper is the center of heaven—no doubt remains.\n\nTherefore, the Primordial Supreme Lord calls the Northern Pole the *Central Pole*, and the Precious Upper Perfected One names the Northern Dipper’s seven stars the *Seven Stars of the Central Heaven*. Even our Confucians say: 'The Dipper is the Emperor’s Chariot, revolving at the center, governing the four directions, dividing yin and yang, establishing the four seasons, balancing the five phases, shifting the nodal measures, and fixing all celestial markers.' Who could deny this?\n\nIn ancient times, the Heavenly Sovereign’s Northern Pole and the Northern Dipper’s seven stars transformed and took form from within the Seven-Treasure Lotus, coalescing into radiant light. They flew to the Central Pole, nine million nine hundred thousand *li* above the earth, and manifested as the Nine Great Treasure Palaces—the Purple Tenuity Enclosure, the Great Void Palace, and the Curved Array’s domain—where they grasp the talismans and charts, govern the primordial transformations, and preside as lords over all stars.\n\n- **Greedy Wolf** aligns with Heaven as the *Celestial Origin*, governing the body.\n- **Giant Gate** aligns with Earth as the *Terrestrial Origin*, governing fate.\n- **Salary Store** aligns with Fire as the *Solar Origin*, governing fortune.\n- **Literary Curved** aligns with Wood as the *Lunar Origin*, governing emolument.\n- **Integrity Perfected** aligns with Earth as the *River Origin*, governing official rank.\n- **Martial Curved** aligns with Water as the *River Origin*, governing longevity.\n- **Broken Army** aligns with Metal as the *Oceanic Origin*, governing wives and children.\n\nEach star commands thirty-six palaces, and each palace oversees thirty-six bureaus. The Three Realms and the Ten Directions, the hundred spirits and host of perfected beings, all submit to their authority. Thus, is not the Central Heaven’s Northern Pole most revered? How could the dwelling of such majesty be defiled?\n\nAccording to the *Scripture of Longevity*, the term *north* need not mean true north. In spring, it is east; in summer, south; in autumn, west; in winter, north—wherever the lunar station points, one violates the Dipper’s handle, swiftly diminishing lifespan.

By what principle did it swiftly attain rebirth in heaven?” The master said: “I merely pointed out that you are but clay molded together—there is no other truth.” The monk stood in contemplation, and the master asked: “Do you understand?” “I do not,” the monk replied.

      "translated_text": "Fire, as recorded in the Zhou canon, is dispensed and received in due time. When the burning-mirror draws from the sun, its purity and sincerity are manifest. Where reverent intent resides, there may sacrifice and prayer be offered. Yet to gather smoldering embers—this is not fitting. If even one thing is not done with care, the gods will take heed.\n\nImpure firewood makes impure food. As the saying goes: though the firewood may not burn, its qi still rises upward—this is why impure firewood must not be used for cooking. Have you not heard of the matters of *\"labored firewood\"* and *\"refined charcoal\"*? Once, Xun Xu was seated beside the emperor when the royal chef presented the meal. Xu said: \"This must have been cooked with labored firewood.\" The emperor did not believe him, but upon summoning the chef and questioning him, it was confirmed that an old carriage axle had indeed been used for fuel. Yang Shou, though he ate plain fare, always cooked with charcoal. One day, Li Zhang hosted a banquet for his two sons, also using charcoal for the fire. The two sons would not touch the food, barely nibbling on some fruit instead. Their retainer, the monk Shenggang Lian, asked: \"Even if other dishes are inedible, what fault lies in rice cooked with charcoal?\" The two sons replied: \"When cooking with charcoal, one must first burn the charcoal until it is hot, hence the name *refined charcoal*. Otherwise, it still carries smoke and qi—this is why we do not eat it.\" Alas! A carriage axle was used for fuel, yet Xun Xu recognized it as labored firewood; the charcoal was not properly refined, yet the two sons still avoided its smoky odor. How much more so, then, should one avoid using impure firewood when preparing offerings for the gods?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nMillet is called *\"bright grain,\"*\nThe first taste precedes the sacrifice.\nVegetarian meals are prepared with care,\nTransforming simple fare into a grand feast.\nThe bounty of Heaven must be honored,\nWith no hint of negligence.\nThe fire’s measure must be precise,\nThe firewood pure and bright.\nFor offerings to guests and gods alike,\nPurity is paramount—what barrier lies between man and spirit?\n\nTo rise naked at night: As the *Daoist Canon* states, the sun and moon each span eight hundred and forty *li*. The sun travels through *qian*, the moon through *kun*; the sun gains clarity from the moon’s essence, the moon gains brightness from the sun’s spirit. Clarity is their qi, radiance their substance. Yin and yang are their Way, the crow and hare their symbols. *Mao* and *you* are their paths, day and night their cycles. Their union is their function. Generally, day belongs to yang, night to yin—night is the time when the hundred spirits converge, and to be naked then risks offense. Have you not heard of Huang Sangou and Yuan Qing? Once, Zhu Shoucheng was robbed three nights in a row, yet the thieves could not enter.",

He returned once more, but as he entered the second gate, he saw flames blazing fiercely, and several armored warriors shouting to seize him. Terrified, Huang Sangou scrambled to escape, unwittingly wounding his own men in the chaos. When the case was tried, the armored warriors he had seen were none other than the attendant deities from the portrait of Zhenwu worshipped in Zhu Shoucheng’s home.\n\nThe courtesan Yang Suzhen of Shanzhou lived alone and had amassed great wealth. The military officer Yuan Qing, through a hundred schemes, seduced her, and they became husband and wife. He took all her possessions and set off with her for the capital. Stopping at Mengyang, he got Yang Suzhen drunk that very night and drowned her in the deep abyss. By chance, Zhenwu was passing through the heavens at that moment and saved her, restoring her to life. Thus, even in the dead of night in a secluded place, who can say there are no divine spirits? How then could one rise naked at night?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nDwell with body ever covered,\nGaze not below the sash.\nIn all form and appearance,\nMove as though in reverent caution.\nCarelessness invites theft,\nDiligence knows no rest.\nHow can one claim the dark is hidden,\nAnd thus indulge in ruin?\nBy this, one may examine fortune—\nNo need for tortoise or milfoil.\n\nThe Eight Nodal Days for Enforcing Punishment\n\nIt is transmitted: The Shangqing Perfected says: On the eight nodal days, one should devote oneself to good deeds and avoid anger, resentment, or strife. These are great taboos for heaven and humanity, and the offenses incurred are no small matter—how much less should one dare to carry out punishments? Generally, on these days, the Primordial Celestial Worthy dispatches the Heavenly Worthies, Heavenly Lords, Heavenly Emperors, divine immortals, and countless hosts of celestial soldiers to transform and enlighten the world, opening the path to salvation for all beings. The Northern Dipper and Southern Asterisms, the Four Controllers and Five Emperors, also descend to record merits and transgressions.\n\nFor example, the sun’s usual course is along the Red Way, the moon’s along the Yellow Way. But at the Beginning of Spring, the sun travels the Green Way, emerging east of the Yellow Way. The Three Primordial Sovereign Ladies ascend to the Celestial August Emperor, roaming the Primordial Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of Ascending Saints, together with the Lord of the Beginning Azure Heavens, descend.\n\nAt the Beginning of Summer, the sun travels the Red Way, emerging south of the Yellow Way. The Supreme Perfected of the Great Ultimate and the Three Primordial Perfected ascend to the Purple Tenuity Palace, roaming the Mystic Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of Cherishing Life, together with the Lord of the Beginning Vermilion Heavens, descend.\n\nAt the Beginning of Autumn, the moon travels the White Way, emerging west of the Yellow Way. The Supreme Perfected White Emperor of the Great Simplicity ascends to the High Perfected of the Jade Heaven, roaming the Primordial Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Great Numinous Void, together with the Lord of the Beginning Pale Heavens, descend.\n\nAt the Beginning of Winter, the moon travels the Black Way, emerging north of the Yellow Way. The Perfected of the Highest Clarity, the Imperial Lord, and the August Ancestor ascend to the Supreme Jade Emperor of the Nine Heavens, roaming the Grotto Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Infinite Great Flower, together with the Lord of the Beginning Mystic Heavens, descend.\n\nAt the Spring Equinox, the sun again travels the Green Way, emerging east of the Yellow Way. The Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity ascends to the Supreme Jade Emperor, roaming the Beginning Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Treasure, together with the Azure Spirit Beginning Elder Emperor, descend.\n\nAt the Autumn Equinox, the moon travels the White Way, emerging west of the Yellow Way. The Supreme Perfected Red Emperor of the Southern Culmen ascends to the Nine Numinous Ladies of the Upper Terrace of Langfeng, roaming the Bright Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Supreme Mystery, together with the Radiant Spirit August Elder Emperor, descend.\n\nAt the Summer Solstice, the sun travels the Red Way, emerging south of the Yellow Way. The Great Emperor of Fusang ascends to the Supreme Tenuity Palace, roaming and receiving the Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Myriad Blessings of the Mystic Perfected, together with the Vermilion Spirit Perfected Elder Emperor, descend.\n\nAt the Winter Solstice, the moon travels the Black Way, emerging north of the Yellow Way. The Supreme Perfected of the Great Empyrean and the Jade Consort of the Great Void ascend to the Supreme Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity Palace, roaming the Pure Radiance, performing the Dao, receiving immortality, and the Heavenly Worthy of the Jade Dawn of the Mystic Empyrean, together with the Five Spirit Mystic Elder Emperor, descend.\n\nAll beings that contain *qi*, on these days, undergo transformations—soaring, creeping, plants and trees rising and sinking—responding to conditions, shedding the old and embracing the new. The light may become heavy, the heavy may become light; good and evil reverse, and the movements of *qi* and images proceed naturally.\n\nScholars of the higher studies, on these days, should meditate and offer prayers, adapting to change, cultivating good and eliminating evil, advancing brightness and abandoning darkness, entering rectitude and governing perversity, refining the false into the true, striving to ascend to sagehood, opening the path to salvation for all beings, and bringing forth the myriad things—thus aligning with the intentions of the Most High and the host of Perfected.

Suddenly, the fish leapt, striking her eye and splattering blood across the floor. In an instant, the blood transformed into worms, swarming and coiling around her body.

      "translated_text": "When I descend again on the twenty-seventh day, I shall observe what transpires further. Yet is hunting with fire permissible? It is lamentable that people do not recognize that all sentient beings possess the Buddha-nature. If guided by righteousness, none would fail to comprehend.\n\nIn former times, when Wei Nan’gang governed Shu, there was a parrot of remarkable intelligence. Its keeper, instructing it in the Dao of the Buddha, said: “If you wish to recite the Buddha’s name, begin with thought, and from thought proceed to thoughtlessness.” The parrot lifted its head and flapped its wings, as though listening and assenting. When bidden to recite the Buddha’s name, it remained silent. Questioned why it did not recite, it suddenly cried out, “Amitābha Buddha!”—its intent seemingly awakened: it took thought as conditioned arising, and thoughtlessness as the true limit.\n\nOne day, without trembling or falling, it folded its wings, drew in its feet, and passed away in stillness. When cremated, ten śarīra relics appeared. The governor had a stupa built to inter them, naming it the Parrot Stupa. Who would claim it lacked the Buddha-nature?\n\nLady Li, wife of Wei Jingyu, was widowed at twenty. Though her parents urged her to remarry, she vowed never to consent. A pair of swallows nested in her home; one day, one flew off alone. Moved by this, Li said to it: “Can you be like me?” She tied a thread to its foot. The next year, it returned alone as before. Li composed a poem:\n\n*Last year you left without a mate,*\n*This spring you still return alone.*\n*Our bond runs deep—how could I bear*\n*To see you fly again as one?*\n\nThe following year, it returned once more, only to find Li already dead. Told of her death and burial place, it flew straight to her grave, cried out in grief, refused food, and perished. The people buried it there, calling it the Swallow’s Mound. Who would claim it lacked devotion to righteousness?\n\nThe Most High warns against hunting with fire, particularly in spring, for spring is the season when all things come to life. If one indulges in such hunting, the harm from the chase may yet be counted; but the passage of a single fire—can its toll be numbered? The *Monthly Ordinances* likewise admonishes against it. How can one fail to heed this warning?\n\nIn praise it is said:\nThe Zhou rites and Xia hunts selected only barren game,\nYet even spring’s culling spared the breeding fowl.\nThe intent was to train troops, not to slaughter wantonly.\nBirds and beasts mate and rear their young when life’s course runs smooth.\nHow could a humane heart bear to burn the forest for sport?\n\nTo revile while facing north—how much worse! As the tradition states: The Venerable Bhaguka, before attaining arhatship, once cursed a man for eating slowly, calling him an “ox chewing grass.” Even after becoming an arhat, he could not escape the karmic retribution of being fed like an ox. The deva prince Sudarśana, in his former life, once reviled a visiting monk as a “blind fool.” When his heavenly blessings were exhausted, he too could not avoid the retribution of blindness. Who would claim that malicious speech is harmless? How much more so when directed toward the north?\n\nThe north is where the Supreme One dwells, home to the Northern Asterism. Among its five stars, the first is the Heavenly August Emperor, and the fifth is the Northern Culmen Emperor. Of the Dipper’s nine stars, the seventh is the Star of Ruinous War, known as the Celestial Supreme Thearch, the Mysterious Yang Gate, the Radiant Brilliance, the Most High Jade Sovereign Dao Lord—his majesty is beyond all others.\n\nAccording to the *Sutra of Past Lives*, the Primordial Supreme Thearch declared: “If faithful men and women, on the first spring day, wholeheartedly observe purification rites, reverently invoke the divine, and perform the Ninefold Radiance Offering to welcome the Purple Radiance Holy Mother and the Seven Primal Lords, then even the gravest of the ten evils, the bitterest of karmic retributions, shall melt like ice beneath the nine suns. Their blessings and longevity shall increase, immeasurable heavenly perfected beings shall gather to protect them, their present life shall be fulfilled, their descendants shall flourish, and their merit and virtue shall flow like a sweet spring, ever replenishing, boundless in use. After death, they shall ascend to the Great Brahmā Heaven of True Reality.”\n\nHow, then, can one revile while facing north? Have you not heard how Envoy Liu, through a life-mandate offering, was indeed pardoned of his sins, and how Yanlou, through prayers for his father, did indeed secure his extended years?",

Just then, a great tortoise appeared, seemingly intent on leading the way. Following the tortoise, they passed through more than ten locations, each time finding shallower ground, and thus escaped the calamity of the flood.\n\nThat very night, Yanxiang dreamed of the great tortoise, which said: “Long ago in the silver mines, I once received the kindness of your late father, the Prefect’s aide, who saved and released me. Today, I have come to repay that debt.”\n\nWhen the Perfected Master Sun was in the world, he once traveled through the mountains on the Dao. He saw villagers striking a green snake and forcefully intervened to save it. A month later, as he passed by the same place again, he saw a young man galloping toward him on horseback, who invited him to return home. Upon arrival, it was a royal residence, and a figure in crimson robes emerged to express gratitude, saying: “Yesterday, my foolish son nearly came to harm, but thanks to your intervention, he was saved. Here, our blood kin are many, and all are deeply grateful. Thus, I have sent my eldest son to welcome you and convey our humble thanks.”\n\nThen, he was led into a deep palace, where a consort emerged, holding a young boy dressed in green, to bow and express gratitude. They repeatedly urged him to stay. For three days, he was offered exquisite delicacies, fine meals, silks, pearls, and jade—nothing was lacking. Yet the Master declined all gifts, accepting only the *Thirty Immortal Prescriptions of the Dragon Palace*, bestowed by the Celestial Emperor, which he brought back with him. The *Thousand Gold Remedies* is said to have drawn from these thirty prescriptions.\n\nIf this is so, can the killing of tortoises and the striking of snakes truly be justified?\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe tortoise ranks among the Four Spirits,\nThe snake leads the hundred hibernating creatures.\nYet even Yuju’s net could not spare them from capture,\nAnd the essence of the White Emperor wept upon the path.\nWho would expect the ignorant to bring such misfortune upon themselves?\nIf one encounters a wise soul, they should hasten to relieve such distress.",

      "translated_text": "Such sins as these are recorded by the Deities of Fate, who diminish one’s allotted lifespan in proportion to their severity. When the tally is exhausted, death follows; if the transgression exceeds the debt, the misfortune extends to one’s descendants.\n\nAs the saying goes: the offenses described above have each been expounded in detail in the preceding text, and so shall not be reiterated here. Instead, let us speak of the karmic causes and effects governing rebirth into the Seven Realms, that all may come to know them.\n\nWithin the cycle of the Seven Realms, none attain true purity, for all is but illusion. Even the habits of killing, stealing, and lust persist, following one’s inclinations. The sutra states: “In all the worlds, the succession of death and rebirth follows habitual tendencies; at death, it flows with transformation.”\n\nAt the moment of passing, before the warmth has fully departed, the entirety of one’s lifetime of good and evil deeds appears in an instant. Death reverses life’s course, and the two habits intersect. If pure thought prevails, one ascends and is surely born in the heavens. If the mind takes flight while still possessing blessings, wisdom, and pure vows, the heart naturally opens. One beholds the Buddhas of the ten directions and all the pure lands, and is reborn according to one’s wishes. With more thought than emotion, one rises lightly but not far—such are the flying immortals.\n\nThe mighty ghost kings, flying yakṣas, earth-walking rākṣasas, and those who roam the four heavens move without obstruction. Among them, those with virtuous vows and good hearts protect my Dharma, uphold the precepts, follow the precept-observers, guard the divine mantras, accompany the mantra-holders, or safeguard meditation and preserve the endurance of Dharma. These beings proceed directly to the seat of the Tathāgata. With thought and emotion in balance, they neither ascend nor fall, but are reborn among humans. Those with clear thoughts become wise; those with deep emotions grow dull. With more emotion than thought, one drifts into the realm of beasts—heavy as furred creatures, light as feathered flocks. With seven parts emotion and three parts thought, one descends even lower into the watery wheel.\n\nBorn in the realm of fire, one receives the fierce breath of fire, becoming a hungry ghost, constantly burned. Water harms them, and they have no food or drink, enduring for hundreds of thousands of kalpas with nine parts emotion and one part thought. Descending into the fiery wheel of the abyss, the body enters wind and fire, where the two elements clash. Those lightly burdened are born in the intermediate state; the heavily burdened fall into the realm without respite. These two hells are purely emotional—one sinks into the Avīci Hell. If the heart harbors slander of the Mahāyāna, violates the Buddha’s precepts, deceitfully expounds the Dharma, falsely covets offerings, or usurps reverence, committing the five heinous crimes or the ten evils, one is reborn in the Avīci Hells of the ten directions.\n\nThough the evil karma is self-inflicted, it also affects those sharing the same conditions, for the original ground is thus. The hells, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, gods, immortals, and asuras—all who delve into the Seven Realms—are benighted, bound to the conditioned phenomena of saṃsāra. Rebirth arises from delusion, and delusion follows karma. In the wondrous, radiant, and uncreated original mind, all is like flowers in the sky, fundamentally nonexistent—mere illusion without root or thread.\n\nThese beings, unaware of their original mind, endure this cycle of rebirth for countless kalpas without attaining true purity, all due to following the habits of killing, stealing, and lust.\n\nWhat are the Seven Realms?\n\n**First, the Heavenly Realm.**\nThe sutra states: “Worldly beings who do not seek permanence, unable to forsake the love of wives and concubines, yet do not stray in licentiousness, their minds clear and bright—at death, they dwell near the sun and moon. Such are called the Heaven of the Four Heavenly Kings. Those who have slight attachment to their wives, unable to fully savor the purity of their abodes, at death transcend the brightness of the sun and moon, residing atop the human realm. Such are called the Heaven of the Thirty-Three. Those who engage in desire briefly and depart without longing, active little and still much in the human world—at death, they dwell serenely in the void, beyond the reach of the sun and moon’s light. These beings possess their own radiance. Such are called the Suyāma Heaven. Those who are always still, yet when touched cannot refuse—at death, they ascend to the subtle, no longer touching the lower realms or the abodes of humans and gods. Such are called the Tuṣita Heaven. Those who, without desire, comply with others’ actions, finding the act as tasteless as chewing wax—at death, they are born in the realm of transformation. Such are called the Heaven of Joyous Transformation. Those without worldly minds, yet conforming to worldly deeds, clearly transcending in their conduct—at death, they fully surpass the realm of transformation. Such are the two kinds called the Heaven of Freely Enjoying Transformations by Others. These six heavens, though their forms transcend movement, their hearts and traces remain entangled. From here downward is called the Desire Realm. Even the eighteen heavens of the Form Realm and the four heavens of the Formless Realm—all these heavenly beings, as the Buddha expounded, fail to comprehend the wondrous, luminous mind of enlightenment. Delusion accumulates and arises, falsely creating the three realms, falsely following the Seven Realms in sinking and drowning. Each *pudgala* follows its kind.”\n\n**Second, the Immortal Realm.**\nThe sutra states: “There are also those who do not rely on true enlightenment, cultivating *samādhi* but separately nurturing deluded thoughts, fixing their forms through visualization, dwelling in mountains and forests where humans do not see. There are ten kinds of immortals: Those who persistently consume elixirs without rest, perfecting the Way of ingestion, are called Earth-Walking Immortals. Those who persistently consume herbs and plants without rest, perfecting the Way of medicine, are called Flying Immortals. Those who persistently refine metals and stones without rest, perfecting the Way of transformation, are called Wandering Immortals. Those who persistently regulate movement and stillness without rest, perfecting the essence of *qi*, are called Sky-Walking Immortals. Those who persistently refine bodily fluids without rest, perfecting the virtue of moisture, are called Heaven-Walking Immortals. Those who persistently refine essence and form without rest, perfecting the absorption of purity, are called Permeating Immortals. Those who persistently uphold mantras and prohibitions without rest, perfecting the arts of magic, are called Way-Walking Immortals. Those who persistently cultivate thought without rest, perfecting recollection, are called Radiant Immortals. Those who persistently advance in interaction without rest, perfecting resonance, are called Essence Immortals.”",

      "translated_text": "Those who persistently refine transformation without rest, perfecting awakening, are called Utmost-Walking Immortals. All these cultivate the heart among humanity, yet do not cultivate true awakening, and thus attain a separate principle of life, living for thousands or tens of thousands of years. They dwell in deep mountains or on great sea islands, cut off from the human realm. Yet this too is but the turning of the wheel—deluded thoughts flowing on, without the cultivation of samadhi. When their retribution is exhausted, they return again, scattering into the various destinies.\n\nThe third is the asura destiny. The sutras say: Within these three realms, there are four kinds of asuras. If, within the ghost destiny, they protect the Dharma with their powers and attain penetration into emptiness, these asuras are born from the *mao* direction and belong to the ghost destiny. If, within the heavens, their virtue declines and they fall, their dwelling is near the sun and moon—these asuras emerge from the womb and belong to the human destiny. There are asura kings who hold the world in their grasp, their power pervading without fear, able to contend with Brahma, Indra, and the Four Heavenly Kings for dominion—these asuras arise from transformation and belong to the heavenly destiny. There is also a lesser class of asuras who are born in the heart of the great sea, submerged in water with gaping mouths; by day they roam the empty sky, and by night they return to the water to rest—these asuras arise from damp qi and belong to the animal destiny.\n\nThe fourth is the human destiny. The sutras say: Those who are noble and exalted as humans, or become kings or elders, come from revering the Three Jewels. Those who are upright in appearance, with pure and radiant complexions, foremost in bearing, come from the practice of forbearance. Those who are diligent and untiring, delighting in merit and virtue, come from the practice of diligence. Those who are serene, with careful speech and conduct, come from the practice of meditation. Those who are wise and bright, comprehending profound Dharma, expounding sublime meanings, awakening the ignorant, and whose words are treasured as jewels by those who hear them, come from the cultivation of wisdom. Those with clear and resonant voices come from singing the praises of the Three Jewels. Those who are pure and free from illness come from the practice of compassion. Those who are fearful, with hoarse voices, come from hell. Those who are dull and lazy, gluttonous, inarticulate, timid, delighting in foolish company, and fond of darkness come from the animal destiny. Those who are unclean come from pigs. Those who are fierce and cruel come from vipers. Those lacking in aspiration come from dogs. Those who are stubborn and self-willed come from sheep. Those who delight in fine food and drink, recklessly take lives, and lack compassion come from jackals, wolves, foxes, and hawks. Those who are restless and intolerant come from macaques.\n\nFurthermore: Those who are tall and respectful come from respecting others. Those who are short and small come from disdaining others. Those who are ugly come from anger. Those who are ignorant at birth come from lack of study. Those who are dull-witted come from not teaching others. Those who are short-lived and sickly come from killing. Those who lack livelihood and suffer constant poverty come from theft. Those who are childless come from adultery. Those whose children are licentious come from defiling virgins. Those who are widowed, orphaned, or solitary come from mistreating children. Those who suffer hunger come from hoarding food. Those who are slaves or servants, burdened by debt and unable to repay, come from disrespecting the Three Treasures. Those who are ugly and repulsive come from obstructing the Buddha’s light. Those born as water buffaloes come from official cruelty and oppressing the common people. Those born as deer come from startling others. Those born among dragons come from delighting in mischief. Those whose bodies bear incurable sores come from flogging others. Those who bring joy to others come from delighting in others. Those who are disliked come from disliking others. Those who are imprisoned by officials, bound in cangues and fetters, come from confining living beings. Those with protruding lips come from enjoying fishing. Those born in the Land of Naked People come from disrespectfully entering Buddhist monasteries without clothing. Those born in the Land of Horse-Hoof People come from trampling Buddha-land with sandals. Those born in the Land of Pierced-Chests come from regretting acts of generosity and merit-making.\n\nIt is also said: Those of the owl kind repay their debts and regain human form, mingling with the dull-witted. Those of the fault kind mingle with the foolish, those of the fox kind with the mediocre, those of the venomous kind with the wolf-like, those of the parasitic kind with the insignificant, those of the gluttonous kind with the gentle, those of the servile kind with the laborious, those of the responsive kind with the cultured, those of the auspicious kind with the enlightened, and those of the compliant kind with the discerning. All these, having repaid their past debts and regained human form, remain from beginningless time in the deluded reckoning of karma, mutually arising and destroying. Without encountering the Tathagata or hearing the true Dharma, they turn endlessly in the dust and toil of samsara—such beings are called the pitiable.\n\nThe fifth is hell. The sutras say: These beings, deluded by their own karma, create the ten habitual causes and receive the six intersecting retributions. What are the ten causes? First, the habit of lust; second, the habit of greed; third, the habit of arrogance; fourth, the habit of anger; fifth, the habit of deceit; sixth, the habit of fraud; seventh, the habit of enmity; eighth, the habit of wrong views; ninth, the habit of oppression; and tenth, the habit of litigation. What are the six retributions? All beings create karma with the six senses, and the evil retributions they incur emerge from the six roots.\n\nFirst is the retribution of sight, which summons karmic consequences. When this visual karma intersects, at the approach of death, one first sees raging fires filling the ten directions. The deceased’s spirit, borne by smoke, falls and enters the Avici Hell.\n\nSecond is the retribution of hearing, which summons karmic consequences. When this auditory karma intersects, at the approach of death, one first sees waves surging and submerging heaven and earth. The deceased’s spirit, descending with the current, enters the Avici Hell.\n\nThird is the retribution of smell, which summons evil consequences. When this olfactory karma intersects, at the approach of death, one first sees poisonous qi filling the distance. The deceased’s spirit leaps from the ground and enters the Avici Hell.",

If a single root, such as the eye, commits a single transgression, they enter the one hundred and eight hells. Thus, sentient beings, each acting and creating separately, enter corresponding realms in the world, their deluded thoughts arising—yet these are not originally existent.\n\nSixth is the realm of hungry ghosts. The sutras state: These sentient beings, without having broken the monastic precepts, violated the bodhisattva vows, or destroyed the Buddha’s nirvana, but through other miscellaneous karmas, burn for kalpas. After their sins are exhausted, they take the forms of ghosts. If their original transgression was greed for possessions, upon the exhaustion of their sin, they encounter objects and take form, becoming *guài* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for sensual pleasure, they encounter wind and take form, becoming *bá* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for delusion, they encounter animals and take form, becoming *mèi* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for hatred, they encounter insects and take form, becoming *chóngdú* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for attachment, they encounter decay and take form, becoming *lì* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for arrogance, they encounter qi and take form, becoming hungry ghosts. If their transgression was greed for deception, they encounter darkness and take form, becoming *yǎn* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for clarity, they encounter essence and take form, becoming *wǎngliǎng* ghosts. If their transgression was greed for achievement, they encounter light and take form, becoming servant ghosts. If their transgression was greed for factionalism, they encounter people and take form, becoming messenger ghosts. All these beings, having fallen purely through emotion, are scorched by karmic fire and emerge as ghosts. Among the realms of hungry ghosts, this is the most extreme suffering. Due to their greed, though they conceive desires, they ultimately obtain nothing. Due to their jealousy, when they see others sated, they themselves remain perpetually hungry. Due to their malice, their bodies emit fire, which burns them. Due to their arrogance, their merit is minimal, and even the smallest ghosts overpower them.\n\nFormerly, when the Buddha was in the country of Vaiśālī, he went out at dawn and eighty-four thousand hungry ghosts wailed to him, saying: \"In our past lives, though we saw the Buddha, we did not recognize him. Though we heard the Dharma, we did not acknowledge it. Though we saw the Sangha, we did not know them. We did not perform meritorious deeds, nor did we teach others to do so. Seeing others perform merit, we would mock them. Seeing others commit sins, we rejoiced in our hearts. Due to these most evil actions, we have fallen into this realm for seventy thousand years. Whenever we see even a small amount of water, it soon vanishes. When we see a large body of water, it is guarded by yakshas and rakshasas. Even when great rains fall, our bodies feel as though we stand on scorching sand. We beseech your compassion and salvation.\" The Buddha then taught them to offer water to the Buddha and the Sangha, and thus they were freed from suffering.\n\nWhen Ānanda was in the city of Kapilavastu, he saw a hungry ghost who called himself *Miànrán* and said to Ānanda: \"In three days, you will certainly die and fall into our realm.\" Ānanda asked: \"What can I do to avoid this?\" *Miànrán* replied: \"There is no way except to offer us food, allowing us to be sated and thus liberated, so that you too may be spared.\" Ānanda reported this to the Buddha, who said: \"If you wish to offer food, first place it in a clean vessel, recite my *dhāraṇī* mantra seven times over it, then take it outside, snap your fingers seven times, and offer it to the ghosts. They will be liberated, and you too will be spared, gaining longevity as well.\" The mantra was then spoken: *Namo savadhadhakatavaru kṛtī om samvara samvara hūṃ.* Ānanda believed and practiced accordingly, and indeed was spared.\n\nSeventh is the realm of animals. The sutras state: When the karma of ghosts is exhausted, both emotion and thought become empty. Then, in the world, they encounter those to whom they owe karmic debts, and as animal masters, they repay their past obligations. *Wùguài* ghosts, once their retribution for objects is exhausted, are born in the world mostly as owl-like creatures. *Fēngbá* ghosts, once their retribution for wind is exhausted, become omens and all manner of strange creatures. *Chùmèi* ghosts, once their retribution for animals is exhausted, become solitary creatures. *Chónggǔ* ghosts, once their retribution for insects is exhausted, become poisonous creatures. *Shuāilì* ghosts, once their retribution for decay is exhausted, become parasitic creatures. *Shòuqì* ghosts, once their retribution for qi is exhausted, become edible creatures. *Miányōu* ghosts, once their retribution for darkness is exhausted, become creatures used for clothing. *Héjīng* ghosts, once their retribution for harmony is exhausted, become responsive creatures. *Mínglíng* ghosts, once their retribution for clarity is exhausted, become auspicious creatures of all kinds.",

      "translated_text": "Ghosts bound to humans, once their retribution for human death is exhausted, often become creatures of habit. All these are desiccated by the fires of karma, repaying their past debts. Though they become beasts, it is their own deluded karma that draws them. If one awakens to bodhi, these delusions are revealed as fundamentally nonexistent.\n\nIt is also said: from these beasts, past debts are repaid. If the repayer exceeds what is owed, these beings may return to human form, only to reclaim the excess. If they possess strength and virtue, they may remain in human form to repay what is due. Those without virtue revert to beasts, settling the remaining debt. Know that whether through money, goods, or labor, repayment continues until the debt is cleared. If, in the interim, one kills or consumes another, even across kalpas as countless as motes of dust, they devour and slay one another in an endless cycle—like a turning wheel, rising and falling without cease.\n\nHave you not heard of Dōudiào, who for his arrogance and love of insults died and took the form of a dog?
