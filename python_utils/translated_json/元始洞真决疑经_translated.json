  "full_translation": "**The Primordial Perfection Scripture of Resolving Doubts**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Primordial Perfection Scripture of Resolving Doubts*. Also known as *The Supreme Scripture of Resolving Doubts*. A Tang dynasty revision of the second scroll of *The Scripture of Original Boundary*, later circulated as an independent text. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Dongzhen Division, Benwen Category.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was upon the Lingering Clarity Towering Terrace within the Hall of Harmonious Dawn, seated alongside the Supreme Dao Lord and twelve hundred million lofty perfected and exalted sages upon thrones of white jade lions. Together, they proclaimed the secret essentials and expounded the wondrous gate.\n\nNone but those who shared the Heavenly Worthy’s karmic practice and entered the realm of the Dao were present at this assembly.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy emitted a radiance of five subtle and wondrous hues, suffusing all lands in the ten directions. From within the light arose sounds of every kind, each adapting to the customs of those who heard, so all understood.\n\nHe declared that all dharmas are impermanent, that afflictions and defilements lack autonomy, and that in an instant they transform and vanish like dreams and illusions.\n\n\"You should all cultivate thoughts of revulsion and detachment. Even if you live for kalpas beyond count, without embodying the wondrous Dao, you will ultimately perish. The Three Clarities and the host of sages are momentary and impermanent—thus, nothing in the world is worth preserving.\n\nFor your sake, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy provisionally manifests a responsive body to teach and guide you, enabling your liberation. For those not yet liberated, this is for the sake of future karmic conditions. When the work is accomplished and the task fulfilled, my vows will be perfectly realized.\n\nNow I shall return my spirit to the realm of non-action, profound stillness, and eternal immutability. If any among you harbor doubts like a net, come forth and ask, and I shall expound for you.\n\nThese are my final entrusted instructions—heed them in due time, and harbor no regret.\"\n\nThen, with divine power, he shook the great earth, causing it to revolve and spin, startling the hearts of all beings.\n\nOn that day, the multitudes of the Three Evil Realms all found respite, and the retributions of humans and gods each received augmentation, free from all suffering, afflictions, and obstacles.\n\nWithout exception, all assembled from near and far, their numbers boundless and beyond expression.\n\nAt that moment, the great assembly, with one mind, gazed upon the Dao Lord, their eyes never wavering. They bowed their heads in sorrow and spoke these verses:\n\n*\"Primordial, unsurpassed Teacher of Heaven and Humankind,*\n*Now you forsake great compassion, departing birth and death,*\n*Alone returning to the tranquil, wondrous, singular source,*\n*No longer abiding in the world to save the dust-bound multitudes.*\n\n*Your true wisdom, pure and unobstructed body,*\n*Cannot be likened by parable or word.*\n*Beyond the ken of our perception,*\n*How may we behold and awaken to the profound principle?*\n\n*We have but newly aroused the mind of the supreme vehicle,*\n*Like newborn calves, weak and unsteady.*\n*We rely solely on the compassionate ox of your responsive form,*\n*Drinking the Dharma-milk to grow strong and mature.*\n\n*Heavenly Worthy, you manifest a peerless body,*\n*On which all sentient beings depend.*\n*How can you, in a single moment, abandon your original vow,*\n*Leaving the world orphaned, without refuge?*\n\n*Excellent! O Great Dao Lord, Eye of the World,*\n*Who comprehends the true and responsive without end or beginning.*\n*We beseech you to entreat the Primordial Worthy:*\n*Cover and protect all beings as a father and mother would.\"*\n\nFor the sake of all beings, the Supreme Dao Lord rose from his seat, bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, and said: \"I implore your great compassion, to pity and grieve for all. Prolong your wondrous responsiveness, abide constantly in the world, teach and benefit, enabling all to attain accomplishment, universally raising and liberating them, that all may enter the Dharma-gate.\"\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy, his heart suffused with great compassion, replied to the Dao Lord: \"You are able to sorrow for all sentient beings, following the world’s inclinations, and entreat me to remain in the world.\n\nDao Lord, tell those in this assembly who have not yet entered samadhi: Since attaining the Dao, I have passed through kalpas beyond measure, ever abiding in the world, never having departed.\n\nThose who are to be liberated always see my form. When the time and conditions shift, they cannot see me.\n\nThe beings of this kalpa, responsive to their karmic capacities, shall be liberated through you, Dao Lord.\n\nThus, I now ascend to the mysterious and enter the wondrous. Your mortal eyes cannot perceive my true body, and you may mistakenly believe I have ceased to exist. But if you cultivate right contemplation, you will naturally see me, no different from now.\n\nIf you have not yet clearly discerned the empty nature, and still rely on images to bind your mind, then cast my true likeness in purple gold. Worship and make offerings as if before my true form, and through sincere visualization, the merit will be equal.\n\nWhy is this so? Because neither the body nor its image is real. If you can understand the body that is not a body, then in principle, image and true form are not two.\n\nThus, reverence for the image depends on the mind—whether the karmic reward is light or heavy rests solely with your heart.\n\nThe poor may use clay, wood, bronze, or pigments, according to their means. Erect halls and canopies, banners and flowers, lamps and incense, making offerings in proportion to your capacity, as if serving my true body.\n\nThrough this cause and condition, you will ultimately return to the true Dao and surely meet me in the Great Luo.\"\n\nAgain, he addressed the Dao Lord: \"Among this great assembly, if any harbor unresolved doubts, ask freely, and I shall assist in teaching and instructing, hastening their awakening and understanding, lest they miss the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord raised his hand and addressed the assembly: \"By the Heavenly Worthy’s compassionate command, I am to resolve what you have not yet understood. Let each of you take heed.\"\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One Xu Laile, Dharma Master of the Supreme Ultimate, rose from his seat amidst the great assembly, approached the Supreme Lord, knelt, and said: \"By fortune, I have been permitted to attend your august presence and receive your instruction on the profound depths of the Three Treasures. Though unworthy, I have been entrusted with the office of Perfected Dharma Master—an honor beyond compare.\n\nNow, by your command, I dare to question the Heavenly Worthy. Though my ignorance and dullness render me unfit to make such an inquiry, as a Dharma Master charged with propagating the true Dao, and further entrusted with your teaching, I dare not conceal my thoughts. Thus, I venture to seek your counsel.\n\nI humbly beseech your vast compassion to instruct me on whether to advance or retreat, and await your admonition.\"\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord said to Laile: \"Through accumulated merit and virtue, you have attained the manifest signs of a lofty sage and become a great Dharma Master, guiding later learners. If you have doubts, ask and resolve them—you are precisely the one for this task.\"\n\nAt that time, Xu Laile composed his countenance, straightened his robes, and with measured, graceful steps—like a disciple in the sandalwood grove—advanced through the great assembly with ease and fearlessness. Receiving the sacred decree of the Dao, he approached the Heavenly Worthy, prostrated himself with limbs outstretched, clasped his hands in reverence, and with tears of sorrow and gratitude, addressed the Heavenly Worthy:\n\n\"Earlier, within the radiant light, I received your command to bow deeply before the Dao Lord and to proclaim and urge the teachings. Though I am unworthy and shallow, I venture to seek your counsel. I pray that your heavenly compassion will surely grant me your gracious permission.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy rejoiced and replied: \"Excellent, excellent! Your question is most timely. Now listen well.\n\nIt is like a king who rules over the world, possessing the seven treasures and all manner of storehouses. At times, this king travels throughout the four seas for his own enjoyment and to universally benefit the people. The crown prince, inheriting the throne, continues the great enterprise, entrusted with its charge. There are ministers of great wisdom who uphold and govern rightly, bringing benefit and peace to the people.\n\nI, too, am thus—governing all as the Great Dharma King. I wish to traverse the most wondrous and ascendant realm of the Mysterious, guiding the multitudes of the Three Clarities with right contemplation. I entrust all the secret and true treasures to the Dao Lord, to succor the impoverished and those lacking in good fortune, and to bestow merit upon those who cultivate diligence. Furthermore, I wish to universally enjoin all perfected sages to propagate the true Dao, each opening the way to benefit according to what suits the occasion—just as the king entrusts his ministers only after selecting those of profound wisdom capable of bearing such responsibility.\n\nYou, too, are thus. Through countless kalpas as numerous as motes of dust, you have renounced desire and guarded the true, advancing with vigor and courage, your wisdom clear and bright, your virtue cultivated through merit. Thus, you have aroused the unsurpassed mind and inquired into the great Dharma. Because I am replete with perfect merit and wisdom, I am well able to resolve your doubts. I know you are capable of receiving the profoundest secrets and assisting the Dao Lord in propagating the Dao and benefiting beings.\"\n\nThen, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"I venture to ask: as the true Dharma flows through the world, its spoken words follow worldly texts. Yet heavenly demons and heterodox teachings intermingle with the true scriptures. When examining their meaning, how are we to distinguish them? I pray you reveal the essentials, that future generations may be free from obstruction.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"The Dao is fundamentally wordless, without script or text. Yet for the world’s deluded beings—foolish and stumbling, their minds suspended in ignorance of the Dao—worldly texts are established to gradually enlighten the uninitiated. Thus, words are employed to proclaim the true Dao, and texts are provisionally used to compose scriptures and diagrams. Though language and characters are the same, they are not of the common stream.\n\nIf you wish to know, listen with single-minded attention: there are twelve seals that mark my true Dharma. Any teaching that bears these seals is a true scripture; without them, it is heterodox doctrine. What are the twelve?\n\nFirst, all conditioned phenomena in the world are impermanent—arising and transforming, aging and perishing in an instant, swifter than flowing water, lightning, a galloping steed, or a whirlwind. Allotted lifespans, whether long or short, inevitably end, and beings flow through the three evil destinies according to their karma. The great term of death and dissolution is easily perceived, but the impermanence of change is not understood by the world. Those of the Three Clarities, perceiving the marks of arising and ceasing, awaken to the suffering of impermanence. Through wisdom, they clearly understand, for they embody the formless. With wisdom, they know and awaken; forgetting and non-attachment free them from suffering. Yet, being unrestrained, they remain serene and joyful, though their liberation is not yet complete, and they still follow the arising and ceasing of thoughts.\n\nSecond, all worldly phenomena are without self, for they are not autonomous, not truly real, and exist only in mutual dependence.\n\nThird, all worldly phenomena involving mind are suffering. Why? Because they are subject to oppression, opposition, and the impermanence of change and dissolution. Suffering has two kinds: coarse and subtle. What is coarse suffering? All that is born, ages, sickens, and dies; the meeting of enemies, the parting of loved ones, and the frustration of desires—this is coarse suffering. What is subtle suffering? The subtle impermanence of moment-to-moment decay is true suffering, yet people do not know it—this is subtle suffering.\n\nFourth, all worldly phenomena are impure and defiled, with both coarse and subtle aspects. The coarse is visible, the subtle unknown. For example, the fleshly body—skin, blood, and vessels—is grossly impure, its corpse foul and rotting. The afflictions and outflows of defilement, which the wise discard, are subtle impurities.\n\nFifth, all things are empty, without inherent nature or reality, for they arise from dependent origination.\n\nSixth, the ascendant realm of the transcendent Dao is eternally abiding, its essence quiescent and spontaneous, unborn and undying, free from the marks of conditioned existence.\n\nSeventh, the wondrous wisdom of the True One is unobstructed and autonomous, its divine power manifesting as it wills, thus called the Great Self.\n\nEighth, free from the duality of impermanence and untouched by any reception, the mind’s marks are extinguished—thus called peace and bliss.\n\nNinth, the true nature is empty and unobstructed, free from all marks, unstained and undefiled—thus called purity.\n\nTenth, the true and real Dao is not a false or compounded body; it is the vajra body—thus called true existence.\n\nEleventh, all worldly and transcendent phenomena are provisionally established, arising from causes and conditions. The expedient path is opened to transform beings, and names are forcibly assigned.\n\nTwelfth, the true nature of the Dao is neither arising nor ceasing, neither existent nor nonexistent—thus called the Middle Way.\n\nThese twelve Dharma seals define my teaching. Wherever they are found in speech, they should be revered and followed. Without them, such teachings are not to be cultivated.\n\nWith the eye of the Dao, I observe from afar the stillness of the realm and perceive beings. Those who can discern and clearly understand the Dharma seals, practicing in accord with the teaching—I manifest in various forms throughout the six destinies of humans and gods, acting as is fitting.\"\n\nSuddenly appearing and swiftly vanishing, I provisionally manifest to guide and receive, shelter and support, ensuring no obstacles remain. You must widely proclaim this seal of the true Dharma to all heavenly and human beings, that all may know and follow it according to the teaching.\n\nThe Supreme Pole Perfected One bowed reverently and accepted the command. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign rose from his seat, bowed deeply, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: \"Today I wish to ask something—would you deign to permit me to speak?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: \"Excellent, excellent. Ask freely whatever you wish.\"\n\nThe Sovereign inquired: \"For those beginners who have not yet entered the stage of concentration, what should they cultivate as their stepping stones?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: \"Excellent. That you ask this on behalf of those beings who have not yet awakened—men and women of the latter age shall receive this grace. For learners, the initial practice of ten matters serves as their stepping stones. Like one ascending a ladder, from the first rung to the second, and so on to the summit, climbing step by step from low to high. One must first cultivate these ten matters, and only then can one deeply enter right contemplation. What are these ten matters?\n\nFirst, arouse a heart of joyful faith—only then can one advance.\nSecond, draw near to good companions; encountering good companions guides the heart to deeply believe in the true Dao.\nThird, seek an enlightened teacher; the teacher possesses wondrous Dharma, broadly able to proclaim and reveal its essential safeguards.\nFourth, hear the true teaching and be able to receive, read, and recite it.\nFifth, be able to leave the household life, freeing oneself from all fetters.\nSixth, receive the true precepts to guard body, mind, and speech.\nSeventh, retreat to mountain forests, dwelling in seclusion, forever leaving the clamor of dust, cultivating the aspiration for stillness.\nEighth, contemplate the great Dao as the true Dharma King, able to ferry beings across the sea of birth and death, like a ship’s captain rescuing the drowning.\nNinth, contemplate the scriptural teachings as wondrous medical prescriptions, able to show beings the remedies for afflictions.\nTenth, contemplate the Dharma master as true father and mother, skillfully giving birth to our Dharma-body and wisdom-life.\n\nThrough these ten practices, practitioners can advance in right understanding, enter the stage of certainty, and ascend the ladder to its summit.\"\n\nThe Sovereign asked further: \"What is the sign of cultivating right contemplation and attaining the summit?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable answered: \"For beginners, diligently cultivating the ten practices serves as the expedient path, learning the semblance of emptiness. They come to understand that beings have no true substance, gradually awakening to the fact that even dust motes lack true nature, all being empty and false. Entering the gate of one mark, they become firm and unwavering—this is called attaining the summit. Like ascending a high mountain, reaching the peak and abiding there without retrogression. Knowing they will not retreat, they further cultivate and attain superior clarity, giving rise to the true Dao, their power and efficacy increasing, resembling non-desire. Because they are still bound by attachment, it is called 'resembling'; entering the true Dharma gate, it is called 'non-desire.' The profound true teaching can lead beings into the path of non-desire, and is thus also called the 'Dharma gate of non-desire.' Deepening their penetrating understanding of true nature, they rightly see that all dharmas are without marks of arising or ceasing, transcend birth and death, and shatter all demonic hosts. Their minds become like lapis lazuli, luminously clear and unimpeded. The utmost of the Middle Way is forever severed—this is called turning the Dharma wheel. The essence of the Dharma wheel is true wisdom, which transports one beyond the three realms, surpassing the Jade Clarity Heaven, and arriving at the realm of constant stillness—hence it is called the Dharma wheel. When the divine perfected ones obtain this Dharma, they wish for all beings to ride this true wisdom and reach the bodhimanda. Through skillful means, they teach according to their awakening, and by this skillful teaching, beings come to understand, turning from darkness to light. Through this wondrous teaching, it is thus also called the true Dharma wheel. Just as a cart with wheels can transport riders to wherever they wish, arriving at a place of peace and bliss, so too does the true Dharma wheel carry practitioners to the place of liberation. Moreover, just as a king possesses a great wheel-treasure that can destroy enemy foes, so does this Dharma destroy the four demonic adversaries of heterodox paths—thus it is also called the true Dharma wheel. These are the signs of cultivating right understanding and right contemplation, and attaining the summit.\"\n\nThe Sovereign asked again: \"If great bodhisattvas in this defiled and evil age wish to teach beings, with what Dharma should they first mature them? I humbly request your instruction, that both may benefit.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: \"It is like a skilled physician who thoroughly knows the art of healing and can then cure all illnesses. This scripture is like a skilled physician in the world, able to show beings the essential art of treating afflictions. Why is this so? Without encountering this scripture, one does not recognize the root source of beings’ evil actions or the symptoms of their inverted illnesses, nor can one know the methods to cure and sever them. Like a foolish person afflicted with grave illness who, not meeting a skilled physician, arbitrarily takes various poisonous medicines, their illness does not improve, and they die prematurely. Beginners who do not encounter this scripture are likewise in darkness, practicing heterodox paths to save themselves. Not only do they fail to attain liberation, but they fall into the three evil destinies. Therefore, one should listen to and receive this scripture, recognize the skilled physician’s art, and only then can one treat the illnesses of deluded confusion and transcend to the realm of immortals. What is this art? If practitioners wish to ferry all beings across, they must first enter concentration and examine the conditions of their arising, their desires, and the differences in their faculties and natures. For those with heavy greed and desire, expound the body’s lack of wonder, its impurity, foulness, and fullness of evils, breaking their thoughts of attachment and love. For those with much anger, demonstrate the four immeasurables, teaching them to cultivate kindness and compassion, forgetting self and cherishing others, dissolving their resentment and eliminating hatred and vexation. For those heavily obstructed by ignorance, reveal the Dharma gates, teaching with expedient means to awaken their wisdom. For those with scattered minds, instruct them to guard the One, restrain the hun and po souls, and focus and soften their minds. For those practicing infant-like conduct or clinging to views, demonstrate emptiness, dissolving their discriminations. For those with calculating minds and much arrogance, show the mark of non-self and the lack of autonomous power—what do they rely on to raise their pride? Soon it will be ground away, and in the end, they must die and return to dust.\"\n\nWhen suffering and affliction press without a moment’s respite, employ the universal remedy of impermanence and suffering to cure all ills, ever mindful of the true Dao as the equal treatment for the many ailments. This is called the sign of maturing sentient beings. Once matured, they become capable of receiving the teaching—profoundly forgetting the dual, embracing the equal and true Dharma, and entering the ultimate reality. This is called the method of Mahāyāna transformation.\n\nThis sutra thus demonstrates the skillful art of healing. Therefore, I compare it to a skilled physician. Those who obtain this sutra can discern the various partial ailments of sentient beings as well as their common afflictions, administering medicine as appropriate, with none failing to recover. Such a person is also called the King of Physicians. By virtue of this sutra, they can dispel all afflictions, and thus it is further named the Medicine of Wisdom. It generates wisdom and severs the illness of afflictions, hence the name Medicine of Wisdom.\n\nYou should know that names and meanings are boundless: sometimes the cause is spoken of as the fruit, and sometimes the fruit as the cause. Those who can teach the Dharma as the Medicine of Wisdom are called those who receive the fruit’s name within the cause. Why? Only that which can cure illness is called medicine. This Medicine of Wisdom arises from the true teaching, and thus the true teaching is called the Medicine of Wisdom.\n\nThis sutra not only cures the illness of delusion but also generates wondrous goodness, enabling practitioners to reach the realm of eternal joy, the palace of deathlessness. It is like ambrosia: those who partake of it will never suffer untimely death but will enjoy long life and extended years. This sutra is likewise: those who practice it will surely attain the life of eternal, constant bliss. If, however, one cannot practice skillful means, learning only to interpret in a one-sided manner and thus giving rise to attachments, afflictions will only increase, and long life will not be secured. It is like one who, though partaking of ambrosia, fails to regulate its use, damaging its potency and instead incurring harm. Therefore, one should deeply understand the expedient means within the true Dharma gate, awakening appropriately according to circumstances, and realizing the path of ambrosia. Only then is it called obtaining the benefit of the Dharma.\n\nThe August One bowed in reverence, praised it as excellent, and resumed his seat. The Prime Minister, Lord Blue Lad, inwardly reflected: The Ten Kinds of Steps spoken by the Heavenly Worthy—are these the initial expedient forms for learners entering the Dao? I have yet to understand them. How could beginners possibly comprehend them? Having thought thus, he rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, composed his mind with solemnity, approached the Heavenly Worthy, bowed deeply, knelt, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"Earlier, I heard that the ten Dharmas serve as the steps for cultivation. I, dull as I am, have not understood them. I humbly request further instruction: What is meant by the mind of good desire?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Excellent. The Prime Minister’s question has two aspects: first, he asks because of his own lingering doubts; second, he asks on behalf of all those who have yet to understand. The Prime Minister, having long since in distant kalpas well understood and heard the true Dharma, has entered the realm of the Dao and bathed in the flow of the Dharma. He observes both emptiness and existence and skillfully knows the essentials of both concise and expansive teachings. For the sake of sentient beings, he now makes this expedient request.\n\nThose who teach the Dharma exhibit two kinds of characteristics: concise and expansive. For those of dull faculties, the teaching is both concise and expansive: opening but a single gate is called concise; if much is said, their limited wisdom cannot bear it, so within one matter, distinctions are made—this is called expansive. Because they are difficult to awaken, instruction is given with great care, hence it is called expansive. For those of sharp faculties, there are also concise and expansive teachings: fully opening the Dharma gates is called expansive; their wisdom is capable, so no detailed elaboration is needed, and they can fully understand even with a rough explanation of one aspect—this is called concise. For the August One, I teach in a manner suited to the middle way, though beginners and those of lesser faculties have not yet fathomed these principles. Out of compassion, the Prime Minister makes this request on behalf of future generations, and now I shall expound at length.\n\nThe term 'good desire' refers to the mind of faith and reverence that arises naturally from past karmic conditions, wishing to honor the Three Treasures, seeking liberation from the world, and loathing the mundane. All that sentient beings do arises from desire: if the desire is to practice goodness, they can progress toward goodness; if the desire is to do evil, they will commit evil deeds. The root of desire lies in the sharpness or dullness of one’s faculties: those who bear the fruit of blessings receive clear and sharp qi, and because their faculties are sharp, they can generate good desires; those who bear the retribution of sin receive turbid and base qi, and because their faculties are dull, they generate evil desires. As desires accumulate through habit, they become unchanging nature. This is called the distinguishing mark of good desire.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"What is further meant by being near to good friends?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Friends are of two kinds: those who corrupt and those who perfect. If someone advises: 'The rewards of human life follow fate and arise naturally. When one’s allotted span is exhausted, it ends—this is unrelated to karmic practice. Like the tip of a thorn, whether scorched by fire or soaked by water, whose doing is it? Fools and sages, the noble and the base, the rich and the poor—who created these distinctions? Simply abide by your allotted portion and accept what you have been given. Why trouble yourself with ascetic practices to seek good Dharma? Forcing your nature harms yourself, laboring in vain without gain. Even visible benefits are absent—how can there be a Dao?' Those who speak thus are called evil companions. They should not be approached but rather kept far away.\n\nIf, however, someone says: 'All karmic retribution arises from causal conditions. The fleshly eye cannot perceive the retribution across the three times, so one claims it is natural—this is not the true meaning. Do not believe it. Instead, arouse the aspiration for goodness, seek a teacher to inquire about the Dao, cultivate the true teaching, and create conditions for future lives, turning toward the root of faith and attaining the supreme Dao.' Those who speak thus are called good companions. Such people should always be drawn near. Why? Because they can generate and perfect the life of the Dharma body and produce blessings and joy for both this life and the next.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"I have just heard the benefits of good companions. What is meant by serving a wise teacher?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Teachers are of two kinds: ornamental and substantive. The ornamental teacher has no inner understanding but outwardly displays the appearance of wisdom, adorning themselves to deceive others and make them believe and follow. This is called the foolish teacher, one who cannot be relied upon.\"\n\n\"The substantive teacher possesses complete inner understanding and conduct without flaw. Though their robes are tattered and sandals worn, they humbly conceal their brilliance, appearing outwardly unremarkable—yet they are called great beings. If through a good companion one recognizes such a teacher, one should go forth to serve them diligently and receive their solemn instruction.\n\nIf a teacher speaks of the attainments of the lesser vehicle—teachings of arising and ceasing, of existence and non-existence, of cause and effect—such doctrines as these are called the teachings of a benighted master. But if a teacher expounds that all dharmas are without cultivation and without obstruction, without cessation and without arising, neither existent nor non-existent, neither cause nor effect, yet both existent and non-existent, neither non-cause nor non-effect, skillfully explaining conditioned origination and provisionally designating the Middle Way to reveal this Dharma—such a one is called an enlightened teacher.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"Such heavenly teachers are exceedingly rare. What is meant by the appearance of one who has left the household life?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"To leave the household life carries profound meaning and vast, far-reaching benefit. There are two kinds of 'household': the first is the household of affection and attachment, the second is the household of all conditioned existence.\n\nFor one who has just begun to learn, having encountered an enlightened teacher and possessing the resolve to endure hardship, serving and attending upon them to receive their wondrous instruction—if they remain in the household life, parents, spouse, and children become entanglements of love that bind them like a prison, allowing no freedom. But when the mind is at ease and unhurried, one may follow the teacher near or far, inquiring into and seeking the profound teaching. Thus, one entreats one’s parents, bids farewell to spouse and children, leaves behind the dwelling place, and journeys far into the mountains and forests, taking refuge in a pure abode. Casting off worldly attire and adornments, they don yellow-brown robes and a dark headcloth, forsaking worldly glory to devote themselves solely to the Dao—this is called first leaving the household of affection and attachment.\n\nHaving left the household, they diligently practice fasting and precepts, escape the three evil destinies, establish the root of faith, study stillness and enter emptiness, relinquish desire for the three realms, and ascend to the Nine Pure Realms—this is called leaving the household of all conditioned existence. This is what is meant by leaving the household life.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"Now that I have left the household of the three evil destinies, I wish to leave the household of all conditioned existence. What is meant by the true teaching?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Any scripture that possesses the twelve seals and accords with the Three Caverns is called a true scripture. All else is called heterodox dharma and should not be received or upheld. One should personally seek a teacher and carefully discern the distinction.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad asked: \"What is meant by precepts?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Precepts are of two kinds: one is 'with attainment,' the other is 'without attainment.' The precepts with attainment include the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Eight Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, Twenty-Seven Precepts, One Hundred Eighty Precepts, and the Three Hundred Great Precepts. They restrain evil and prevent transgressions, yet without comprehending the expedient means—they are called precepts with attainment. They only prevent suffering in the three evil destinies and among humans, but do not enter the Dao’s domain. If one regards all dharmas of precepts as ultimately quiescent and empty, this is called the true precept. Without holding or transgressing, it opens the gate of right contemplation and serves as the root of the Dao.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad asked: \"What is meant by dwelling in seclusion in mountains and forests?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"This, too, is of two kinds. The lesser practitioner, timid and fearful of defilement by the dusts, enters cliffs, forests, and marshes to avoid impurities. Serene and composed, they cultivate pure conduct. The superior practitioner, dwelling in the world, fears no dust or toil. Though abiding in the mundane, they remain unstained, like a pearl or jade whose nature is luminous and pure. Abiding in the realm of wisdom, they rely on the formless wilderness—this is called skillfully understanding the aspect of mountain-dwelling.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad asked: \"What is the aspect of mindfulness of the Dao?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Mindfulness of the Dao universally subdues and extinguishes all evil aspects, like the adamantine force that severs all, like a fierce fire that burns all. Mindfulness is of two kinds: first, mindfulness of the birth-body, endowed with seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, perfectly subtle, uniquely exalted in the human and heavenly realms of the three spheres—this is my refuge and shelter. Second, mindfulness of the Dharma-body, like empty space, perfectly pure, is the true Dao, also called the Dao-body or Dao-nature. Constantly abiding in right mindfulness without interruption by other thoughts—this is called mindfulness of the Dao.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"I beg for the essential teaching—what is the aspect of mindfulness of scriptures?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Scriptures are of three kinds: the Great Vehicle, the Lesser Vehicle, and the Middle Vehicle. With focused mind, one receives and upholds them, constantly generating faith and reverence. Unwavering in contemplation, one discerns that this Dharma is the essential path, free from杂念—this is called mindfulness of scriptures. If one knows that all dharmas are originally without words, rightly contemplates true reality, and penetrates their purport, this too is called mindfulness of scriptures—this is called skillfully understanding the aspect of mindfulness of scriptures.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad asked: \"What is mindfulness of the teacher?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"The teacher is like a father. Without a teacher, I could not attain the Dao. Therefore, one should follow closely, whether near or far, and with the mind’s eye, constantly visualize them as present, never wavering for even a moment, without turning elsewhere—this is called mindfulness of the teacher. One should also rightly contemplate all the great sages and perfected beings who have attained the Dao, for they are all teachers and treasures, all capable of instructing me. They are fertile fields of blessings; with focused mindfulness, one takes refuge in them, thought after thought unbroken, so that wayward thoughts do not arise—this is called mindfulness of the teacher.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"Now that my doubts are forever dispelled by this illumination, in future lives as men or women, I shall no longer be deluded.\" Having bowed in reverence, he returned to his seat.\n\nThe Most High Heavenly Worthy raised his hand and addressed the assembly: \"You should know that my true body is pure and unimpeded, like empty space—unborn, undying, eternally abiding in the quiescence of the great source of wisdom. Though profound and obscure, its essence is most trustworthy. For immeasurable kalpas, I have realized this true body, steadfast and unshaken, transcending all comparison, beyond the ken of sages or the understanding of ordinary beings. For the sake of sentient beings, I manifest a responsive body, wandering through the five destinies, adapting to conditions to liberate and guide, employing expedient means to lead all to awakening. According to the faculties of beings, I provisionally display forms and appearances—thus it is called the responsive body. Yet this responsive body, too, is without birth or death, without going or coming, eternally abiding and unchanging. For the benefit of all, it appears or withdraws differently, arousing diligence and preventing retrogression. All that should be done has been accomplished; what remains undone, the Dao Lord will fulfill. You, all the perfected beings, should together uphold and follow, and do not generate discriminating thoughts toward me.\"\n\nHaving spoken thus, he slowly ascended into the sky, and the assembly strained their eyes but could no longer see him. At that moment, the perfected beings choked with sobs, longing as if they had lost their parents, and looking up to the sky, they bowed in reverence. Turning to the Dao Lord, they recited a verse:\n\nThe supremely pure and wondrous true wisdom-body,\nTruly formless, none can behold.\nOnly the responsive form returns to the source—\nThus each harbors great sorrow.\n\nWe rely on the Most High, the Boundless Worthy,\nLike children who have lost their mother turning to a compassionate father.\nSentient beings are submerged in the fire of suffering—\nWe only pray for the timely shower of sweet dew,\nTo sever inverted thoughts and clinging minds,\nTo dissolve all views and extinguish wayward paths.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord addressed the four assemblies: \"You should know that all dharmas are of the nature of emptiness and quiescence. The realm of birth and death is no different in essence—do not falsely entertain thoughts of going or coming. From the moment of initial resolve, recognize impermanence, each seek your own liberation, and escape the suffering of birth and death. The Heavenly Worthy’s teachings on precepts and exhortations are clear—strive diligently in cultivation and seek early liberation. Do not harbor sorrow or vexation, lest you waste your good efforts.\"\n\nHaving spoken these words, he returned with his attendants to the Jade Capital. All the remaining immortals and those who had come from the ten directions bowed to the Dao Lord and departed at once.\n\nThus concludes *The Primordial Beginning’s Perfect Realization Scripture on Resolving Doubts*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Primordial Perfection Scripture of Resolving Doubts**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Primordial Perfection Scripture of Resolving Doubts*. Also known as *The Supreme Scripture of Resolving Doubts*. A Tang dynasty revision of the second scroll of *The Scripture of Original Boundary*, later circulated as an independent text. One scroll. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Dongzhen Division, Benwen Category.\n\n---\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy was upon the Lingering Clarity Towering Terrace within the Hall of Harmonious Dawn, seated alongside the Supreme Dao Lord and twelve hundred million lofty perfected and exalted sages upon thrones of white jade lions. Together, they proclaimed the secret essentials and expounded the wondrous gate.\n\nNone but those who shared the Heavenly Worthy’s karmic practice and entered the realm of the Dao were present at this assembly.\n\nThen the Heavenly Worthy emitted a radiance of five subtle and wondrous hues, suffusing all lands in the ten directions. From within the light arose sounds of every kind, each adapting to the customs of those who heard, so all understood.\n\nHe declared that all dharmas are impermanent, that afflictions and defilements lack autonomy, and that in an instant they transform and vanish like dreams and illusions.\n\n\"You should all cultivate thoughts of revulsion and detachment. Even if you live for kalpas beyond count, without embodying the wondrous Dao, you will ultimately perish. The Three Clarities and the host of sages are momentary and impermanent—thus, nothing in the world is worth preserving.\n\nFor your sake, the Primordial Heavenly Worthy provisionally manifests a responsive body to teach and guide you, enabling your liberation. For those not yet liberated, this is for the sake of future karmic conditions. When the work is accomplished and the task fulfilled, my vows will be perfectly realized.\n\nNow I shall return my spirit to the realm of non-action, profound stillness, and eternal immutability. If any among you harbor doubts like a net, come forth and ask, and I shall expound for you.\n\nThese are my final entrusted instructions—heed them in due time, and harbor no regret.\"\n\nThen, with divine power, he shook the great earth, causing it to revolve and spin, startling the hearts of all beings.\n\nOn that day, the multitudes of the Three Evil Realms all found respite, and the retributions of humans and gods each received augmentation, free from all suffering, afflictions, and obstacles.\n\nWithout exception, all assembled from near and far, their numbers boundless and beyond expression.\n\nAt that moment, the great assembly, with one mind, gazed upon the Dao Lord, their eyes never wavering. They bowed their heads in sorrow and spoke these verses:\n\n*\"Primordial, unsurpassed Teacher of Heaven and Humankind,*\n*Now you forsake great compassion, departing birth and death,*\n*Alone returning to the tranquil, wondrous, singular source,*\n*No longer abiding in the world to save the dust-bound multitudes.*\n\n*Your true wisdom, pure and unobstructed body,*\n*Cannot be likened by parable or word.*\n*Beyond the ken of our perception,*\n*How may we behold and awaken to the profound principle?*\n\n*We have but newly aroused the mind of the supreme vehicle,*\n*Like newborn calves, weak and unsteady.*\n*We rely solely on the compassionate ox of your responsive form,*\n*Drinking the Dharma-milk to grow strong and mature.*\n\n*Heavenly Worthy, you manifest a peerless body,*\n*On which all sentient beings depend.*\n*How can you, in a single moment, abandon your original vow,*\n*Leaving the world orphaned, without refuge?*\n\n*Excellent! O Great Dao Lord, Eye of the World,*\n*Who comprehends the true and responsive without end or beginning.*\n*We beseech you to entreat the Primordial Worthy:*\n*Cover and protect all beings as a father and mother would.\"*\n\nFor the sake of all beings, the Supreme Dao Lord rose from his seat, bowed to the Heavenly Worthy, and said: \"I implore your great compassion, to pity and grieve for all. Prolong your wondrous responsiveness, abide constantly in the world, teach and benefit, enabling all to attain accomplishment, universally raising and liberating them, that all may enter the Dharma-gate.\"\n\nThe Primordial Heavenly Worthy, his heart suffused with great compassion, replied to the Dao Lord: \"You are able to sorrow for all sentient beings, following the world’s inclinations, and entreat me to remain in the world.\n\nDao Lord, tell those in this assembly who have not yet entered samadhi: Since attaining the Dao, I have passed through kalpas beyond measure, ever abiding in the world, never having departed.\n\nThose who are to be liberated always see my form. When the time and conditions shift, they cannot see me.\n\nThe beings of this kalpa, responsive to their karmic capacities, shall be liberated through you, Dao Lord.\n\nThus, I now ascend to the mysterious and enter the wondrous. Your mortal eyes cannot perceive my true body, and you may mistakenly believe I have ceased to exist. But if you cultivate right contemplation, you will naturally see me, no different from now.\n\nIf you have not yet clearly discerned the empty nature, and still rely on images to bind your mind, then cast my true likeness in purple gold. Worship and make offerings as if before my true form, and through sincere visualization, the merit will be equal.\n\nWhy is this so? Because neither the body nor its image is real. If you can understand the body that is not a body, then in principle, image and true form are not two.\n\nThus, reverence for the image depends on the mind—whether the karmic reward is light or heavy rests solely with your heart.\n\nThe poor may use clay, wood, bronze, or pigments, according to their means. Erect halls and canopies, banners and flowers, lamps and incense, making offerings in proportion to your capacity, as if serving my true body.\n\nThrough this cause and condition, you will ultimately return to the true Dao and surely meet me in the Great Luo.\"\n\nAgain, he addressed the Dao Lord: \"Among this great assembly, if any harbor unresolved doubts, ask freely, and I shall assist in teaching and instructing, hastening their awakening and understanding, lest they miss the opportunity.\"\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord raised his hand and addressed the assembly: \"By the Heavenly Worthy’s compassionate command, I am to resolve what you have not yet understood. Let each of you take heed.\"\n\nAt that time, the Perfected One Xu Laile, Dharma Master of the Supreme Ultimate, rose from his seat amidst the great assembly, approached the Supreme Lord, knelt, and said: \"By fortune, I have been permitted to attend your august presence and receive your instruction on the profound depths of the Three Treasures. Though unworthy, I have been entrusted with the office of Perfected Dharma Master—an honor beyond compare.\n\nNow, by your command, I dare to question the Heavenly Worthy. Though my ignorance and dullness render me unfit to make such an inquiry, as a Dharma Master charged with propagating the true Dao, and further entrusted with your teaching, I dare not conceal my thoughts. Thus, I venture to seek your counsel.\n\nI humbly beseech your vast compassion to instruct me on whether to advance or retreat, and await your admonition.\"\n\nThe Supreme Dao Lord said to Laile: \"Through accumulated merit and virtue, you have attained the manifest signs of a lofty sage and become a great Dharma Master, guiding later learners. If you have doubts, ask and resolve them—you are precisely the one for this task.\"",

      "translated_text": "At that time, Xu Laile composed his countenance, straightened his robes, and with measured, graceful steps—like a disciple in the sandalwood grove—advanced through the great assembly with ease and fearlessness. Receiving the sacred decree of the Dao, he approached the Heavenly Worthy, prostrated himself with limbs outstretched, clasped his hands in reverence, and with tears of sorrow and gratitude, addressed the Heavenly Worthy:\n\n\"Earlier, within the radiant light, I received your command to bow deeply before the Dao Lord and to proclaim and urge the teachings. Though I am unworthy and shallow, I venture to seek your counsel. I pray that your heavenly compassion will surely grant me your gracious permission.\"\n\nThereupon, the Heavenly Worthy rejoiced and replied: \"Excellent, excellent! Your question is most timely. Now listen well.\n\nIt is like a king who rules over the world, possessing the seven treasures and all manner of storehouses. At times, this king travels throughout the four seas for his own enjoyment and to universally benefit the people. The crown prince, inheriting the throne, continues the great enterprise, entrusted with its charge. There are ministers of great wisdom who uphold and govern rightly, bringing benefit and peace to the people.\n\nI, too, am thus—governing all as the Great Dharma King. I wish to traverse the most wondrous and ascendant realm of the Mysterious, guiding the multitudes of the Three Clarities with right contemplation. I entrust all the secret and true treasures to the Dao Lord, to succor the impoverished and those lacking in good fortune, and to bestow merit upon those who cultivate diligence. Furthermore, I wish to universally enjoin all perfected sages to propagate the true Dao, each opening the way to benefit according to what suits the occasion—just as the king entrusts his ministers only after selecting those of profound wisdom capable of bearing such responsibility.\n\nYou, too, are thus. Through countless kalpas as numerous as motes of dust, you have renounced desire and guarded the true, advancing with vigor and courage, your wisdom clear and bright, your virtue cultivated through merit. Thus, you have aroused the unsurpassed mind and inquired into the great Dharma. Because I am replete with perfect merit and wisdom, I am well able to resolve your doubts. I know you are capable of receiving the profoundest secrets and assisting the Dao Lord in propagating the Dao and benefiting beings.\"\n\nThen, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"I venture to ask: as the true Dharma flows through the world, its spoken words follow worldly texts. Yet heavenly demons and heterodox teachings intermingle with the true scriptures. When examining their meaning, how are we to distinguish them? I pray you reveal the essentials, that future generations may be free from obstruction.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"The Dao is fundamentally wordless, without script or text. Yet for the world’s deluded beings—foolish and stumbling, their minds suspended in ignorance of the Dao—worldly texts are established to gradually enlighten the uninitiated. Thus, words are employed to proclaim the true Dao, and texts are provisionally used to compose scriptures and diagrams. Though language and characters are the same, they are not of the common stream.\n\nIf you wish to know, listen with single-minded attention: there are twelve seals that mark my true Dharma. Any teaching that bears these seals is a true scripture; without them, it is heterodox doctrine. What are the twelve?\n\nFirst, all conditioned phenomena in the world are impermanent—arising and transforming, aging and perishing in an instant, swifter than flowing water, lightning, a galloping steed, or a whirlwind. Allotted lifespans, whether long or short, inevitably end, and beings flow through the three evil destinies according to their karma. The great term of death and dissolution is easily perceived, but the impermanence of change is not understood by the world. Those of the Three Clarities, perceiving the marks of arising and ceasing, awaken to the suffering of impermanence. Through wisdom, they clearly understand, for they embody the formless. With wisdom, they know and awaken; forgetting and non-attachment free them from suffering. Yet, being unrestrained, they remain serene and joyful, though their liberation is not yet complete, and they still follow the arising and ceasing of thoughts.\n\nSecond, all worldly phenomena are without self, for they are not autonomous, not truly real, and exist only in mutual dependence.\n\nThird, all worldly phenomena involving mind are suffering. Why? Because they are subject to oppression, opposition, and the impermanence of change and dissolution. Suffering has two kinds: coarse and subtle. What is coarse suffering? All that is born, ages, sickens, and dies; the meeting of enemies, the parting of loved ones, and the frustration of desires—this is coarse suffering. What is subtle suffering? The subtle impermanence of moment-to-moment decay is true suffering, yet people do not know it—this is subtle suffering.\n\nFourth, all worldly phenomena are impure and defiled, with both coarse and subtle aspects. The coarse is visible, the subtle unknown. For example, the fleshly body—skin, blood, and vessels—is grossly impure, its corpse foul and rotting. The afflictions and outflows of defilement, which the wise discard, are subtle impurities.\n\nFifth, all things are empty, without inherent nature or reality, for they arise from dependent origination.\n\nSixth, the ascendant realm of the transcendent Dao is eternally abiding, its essence quiescent and spontaneous, unborn and undying, free from the marks of conditioned existence.\n\nSeventh, the wondrous wisdom of the True One is unobstructed and autonomous, its divine power manifesting as it wills, thus called the Great Self.\n\nEighth, free from the duality of impermanence and untouched by any reception, the mind’s marks are extinguished—thus called peace and bliss.\n\nNinth, the true nature is empty and unobstructed, free from all marks, unstained and undefiled—thus called purity.\n\nTenth, the true and real Dao is not a false or compounded body; it is the vajra body—thus called true existence.\n\nEleventh, all worldly and transcendent phenomena are provisionally established, arising from causes and conditions. The expedient path is opened to transform beings, and names are forcibly assigned.\n\nTwelfth, the true nature of the Dao is neither arising nor ceasing, neither existent nor nonexistent—thus called the Middle Way.\n\nThese twelve Dharma seals define my teaching. Wherever they are found in speech, they should be revered and followed. Without them, such teachings are not to be cultivated.\n\nWith the eye of the Dao, I observe from afar the stillness of the realm and perceive beings. Those who can discern and clearly understand the Dharma seals, practicing in accord with the teaching—I manifest in various forms throughout the six destinies of humans and gods, acting as is fitting.\"",

You must widely proclaim this seal of the true Dharma to all heavenly and human beings, that all may know and follow it according to the teaching.\n\nThe Supreme Pole Perfected One bowed reverently and accepted the command. The Heavenly Perfected Sovereign rose from his seat, bowed deeply, and addressed the Heavenly Venerable: \"Today I wish to ask something—would you deign to permit me to speak?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: \"Excellent, excellent. Ask freely whatever you wish.\"\n\nThe Sovereign inquired: \"For those beginners who have not yet entered the stage of concentration, what should they cultivate as their stepping stones?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable said: \"Excellent. That you ask this on behalf of those beings who have not yet awakened—men and women of the latter age shall receive this grace. For learners, the initial practice of ten matters serves as their stepping stones. Like one ascending a ladder, from the first rung to the second, and so on to the summit, climbing step by step from low to high. One must first cultivate these ten matters, and only then can one deeply enter right contemplation. What are these ten matters?\n\nFirst, arouse a heart of joyful faith—only then can one advance.\nSecond, draw near to good companions; encountering good companions guides the heart to deeply believe in the true Dao.\nThird, seek an enlightened teacher; the teacher possesses wondrous Dharma, broadly able to proclaim and reveal its essential safeguards.\nFourth, hear the true teaching and be able to receive, read, and recite it.\nFifth, be able to leave the household life, freeing oneself from all fetters.\nSixth, receive the true precepts to guard body, mind, and speech.\nSeventh, retreat to mountain forests, dwelling in seclusion, forever leaving the clamor of dust, cultivating the aspiration for stillness.\nEighth, contemplate the great Dao as the true Dharma King, able to ferry beings across the sea of birth and death, like a ship’s captain rescuing the drowning.\nNinth, contemplate the scriptural teachings as wondrous medical prescriptions, able to show beings the remedies for afflictions.\nTenth, contemplate the Dharma master as true father and mother, skillfully giving birth to our Dharma-body and wisdom-life.\n\nThrough these ten practices, practitioners can advance in right understanding, enter the stage of certainty, and ascend the ladder to its summit.\"\n\nThe Sovereign asked further: \"What is the sign of cultivating right contemplation and attaining the summit?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable answered: \"For beginners, diligently cultivating the ten practices serves as the expedient path, learning the semblance of emptiness. They come to understand that beings have no true substance, gradually awakening to the fact that even dust motes lack true nature, all being empty and false. Entering the gate of one mark, they become firm and unwavering—this is called attaining the summit. Like ascending a high mountain, reaching the peak and abiding there without retrogression. Knowing they will not retreat, they further cultivate and attain superior clarity, giving rise to the true Dao, their power and efficacy increasing, resembling non-desire. Because they are still bound by attachment, it is called 'resembling'; entering the true Dharma gate, it is called 'non-desire.' The profound true teaching can lead beings into the path of non-desire, and is thus also called the 'Dharma gate of non-desire.' Deepening their penetrating understanding of true nature, they rightly see that all dharmas are without marks of arising or ceasing, transcend birth and death, and shatter all demonic hosts. Their minds become like lapis lazuli, luminously clear and unimpeded. The utmost of the Middle Way is forever severed—this is called turning the Dharma wheel. The essence of the Dharma wheel is true wisdom, which transports one beyond the three realms, surpassing the Jade Clarity Heaven, and arriving at the realm of constant stillness—hence it is called the Dharma wheel. When the divine perfected ones obtain this Dharma, they wish for all beings to ride this true wisdom and reach the bodhimanda. Through skillful means, they teach according to their awakening, and by this skillful teaching, beings come to understand, turning from darkness to light. Through this wondrous teaching, it is thus also called the true Dharma wheel. Just as a cart with wheels can transport riders to wherever they wish, arriving at a place of peace and bliss, so too does the true Dharma wheel carry practitioners to the place of liberation. Moreover, just as a king possesses a great wheel-treasure that can destroy enemy foes, so does this Dharma destroy the four demonic adversaries of heterodox paths—thus it is also called the true Dharma wheel. These are the signs of cultivating right understanding and right contemplation, and attaining the summit.\"\n\nThe Sovereign asked again: \"If great bodhisattvas in this defiled and evil age wish to teach beings, with what Dharma should they first mature them? I humbly request your instruction, that both may benefit.\"\n\nThe Heavenly Venerable replied: \"It is like a skilled physician who thoroughly knows the art of healing and can then cure all illnesses. This scripture is like a skilled physician in the world, able to show beings the essential art of treating afflictions. Why is this so? Without encountering this scripture, one does not recognize the root source of beings’ evil actions or the symptoms of their inverted illnesses, nor can one know the methods to cure and sever them. Like a foolish person afflicted with grave illness who, not meeting a skilled physician, arbitrarily takes various poisonous medicines, their illness does not improve, and they die prematurely. Beginners who do not encounter this scripture are likewise in darkness, practicing heterodox paths to save themselves. Not only do they fail to attain liberation, but they fall into the three evil destinies. Therefore, one should listen to and receive this scripture, recognize the skilled physician’s art, and only then can one treat the illnesses of deluded confusion and transcend to the realm of immortals. What is this art? If practitioners wish to ferry all beings across, they must first enter concentration and examine the conditions of their arising, their desires, and the differences in their faculties and natures. For those with heavy greed and desire, expound the body’s lack of wonder, its impurity, foulness, and fullness of evils, breaking their thoughts of attachment and love. For those with much anger, demonstrate the four immeasurables, teaching them to cultivate kindness and compassion, forgetting self and cherishing others, dissolving their resentment and eliminating hatred and vexation. For those heavily obstructed by ignorance, reveal the Dharma gates, teaching with expedient means to awaken their wisdom. For those with scattered minds, instruct them to guard the One, restrain the hun and po souls, and focus and soften their minds. For those practicing infant-like conduct or clinging to views, demonstrate emptiness, dissolving their discriminations. For those with calculating minds and much arrogance, show the mark of non-self and the lack of autonomous power—what do they rely on to raise their pride? Soon it will be ground away, and in the end, they must die and return to dust.\"",

      "translated_text": "When suffering and affliction press without a moment’s respite, employ the universal remedy of impermanence and suffering to cure all ills, ever mindful of the true Dao as the equal treatment for the many ailments. This is called the sign of maturing sentient beings. Once matured, they become capable of receiving the teaching—profoundly forgetting the dual, embracing the equal and true Dharma, and entering the ultimate reality. This is called the method of Mahāyāna transformation.\n\nThis sutra thus demonstrates the skillful art of healing. Therefore, I compare it to a skilled physician. Those who obtain this sutra can discern the various partial ailments of sentient beings as well as their common afflictions, administering medicine as appropriate, with none failing to recover. Such a person is also called the King of Physicians. By virtue of this sutra, they can dispel all afflictions, and thus it is further named the Medicine of Wisdom. It generates wisdom and severs the illness of afflictions, hence the name Medicine of Wisdom.\n\nYou should know that names and meanings are boundless: sometimes the cause is spoken of as the fruit, and sometimes the fruit as the cause. Those who can teach the Dharma as the Medicine of Wisdom are called those who receive the fruit’s name within the cause. Why? Only that which can cure illness is called medicine. This Medicine of Wisdom arises from the true teaching, and thus the true teaching is called the Medicine of Wisdom.\n\nThis sutra not only cures the illness of delusion but also generates wondrous goodness, enabling practitioners to reach the realm of eternal joy, the palace of deathlessness. It is like ambrosia: those who partake of it will never suffer untimely death but will enjoy long life and extended years. This sutra is likewise: those who practice it will surely attain the life of eternal, constant bliss. If, however, one cannot practice skillful means, learning only to interpret in a one-sided manner and thus giving rise to attachments, afflictions will only increase, and long life will not be secured. It is like one who, though partaking of ambrosia, fails to regulate its use, damaging its potency and instead incurring harm. Therefore, one should deeply understand the expedient means within the true Dharma gate, awakening appropriately according to circumstances, and realizing the path of ambrosia. Only then is it called obtaining the benefit of the Dharma.\n\nThe August One bowed in reverence, praised it as excellent, and resumed his seat. The Prime Minister, Lord Blue Lad, inwardly reflected: The Ten Kinds of Steps spoken by the Heavenly Worthy—are these the initial expedient forms for learners entering the Dao? I have yet to understand them. How could beginners possibly comprehend them? Having thought thus, he rose from his seat, adjusted his robes and cap, composed his mind with solemnity, approached the Heavenly Worthy, bowed deeply, knelt, and addressed the Heavenly Worthy: \"Earlier, I heard that the ten Dharmas serve as the steps for cultivation. I, dull as I am, have not understood them. I humbly request further instruction: What is meant by the mind of good desire?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Excellent. The Prime Minister’s question has two aspects: first, he asks because of his own lingering doubts; second, he asks on behalf of all those who have yet to understand. The Prime Minister, having long since in distant kalpas well understood and heard the true Dharma, has entered the realm of the Dao and bathed in the flow of the Dharma. He observes both emptiness and existence and skillfully knows the essentials of both concise and expansive teachings. For the sake of sentient beings, he now makes this expedient request.\n\nThose who teach the Dharma exhibit two kinds of characteristics: concise and expansive. For those of dull faculties, the teaching is both concise and expansive: opening but a single gate is called concise; if much is said, their limited wisdom cannot bear it, so within one matter, distinctions are made—this is called expansive. Because they are difficult to awaken, instruction is given with great care, hence it is called expansive. For those of sharp faculties, there are also concise and expansive teachings: fully opening the Dharma gates is called expansive; their wisdom is capable, so no detailed elaboration is needed, and they can fully understand even with a rough explanation of one aspect—this is called concise. For the August One, I teach in a manner suited to the middle way, though beginners and those of lesser faculties have not yet fathomed these principles. Out of compassion, the Prime Minister makes this request on behalf of future generations, and now I shall expound at length.\n\nThe term 'good desire' refers to the mind of faith and reverence that arises naturally from past karmic conditions, wishing to honor the Three Treasures, seeking liberation from the world, and loathing the mundane. All that sentient beings do arises from desire: if the desire is to practice goodness, they can progress toward goodness; if the desire is to do evil, they will commit evil deeds. The root of desire lies in the sharpness or dullness of one’s faculties: those who bear the fruit of blessings receive clear and sharp qi, and because their faculties are sharp, they can generate good desires; those who bear the retribution of sin receive turbid and base qi, and because their faculties are dull, they generate evil desires. As desires accumulate through habit, they become unchanging nature. This is called the distinguishing mark of good desire.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"What is further meant by being near to good friends?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Friends are of two kinds: those who corrupt and those who perfect. If someone advises: 'The rewards of human life follow fate and arise naturally. When one’s allotted span is exhausted, it ends—this is unrelated to karmic practice. Like the tip of a thorn, whether scorched by fire or soaked by water, whose doing is it? Fools and sages, the noble and the base, the rich and the poor—who created these distinctions? Simply abide by your allotted portion and accept what you have been given. Why trouble yourself with ascetic practices to seek good Dharma? Forcing your nature harms yourself, laboring in vain without gain. Even visible benefits are absent—how can there be a Dao?' Those who speak thus are called evil companions. They should not be approached but rather kept far away.\n\nIf, however, someone says: 'All karmic retribution arises from causal conditions. The fleshly eye cannot perceive the retribution across the three times, so one claims it is natural—this is not the true meaning. Do not believe it. Instead, arouse the aspiration for goodness, seek a teacher to inquire about the Dao, cultivate the true teaching, and create conditions for future lives, turning toward the root of faith and attaining the supreme Dao.' Those who speak thus are called good companions. Such people should always be drawn near. Why? Because they can generate and perfect the life of the Dharma body and produce blessings and joy for both this life and the next.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"I have just heard the benefits of good companions. What is meant by serving a wise teacher?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Teachers are of two kinds: ornamental and substantive. The ornamental teacher has no inner understanding but outwardly displays the appearance of wisdom, adorning themselves to deceive others and make them believe and follow. This is called the foolish teacher, one who cannot be relied upon.\"",

Though their robes are tattered and sandals worn, they humbly conceal their brilliance, appearing outwardly unremarkable—yet they are called great beings. If through a good companion one recognizes such a teacher, one should go forth to serve them diligently and receive their solemn instruction.\n\nIf a teacher speaks of the attainments of the lesser vehicle—teachings of arising and ceasing, of existence and non-existence, of cause and effect—such doctrines as these are called the teachings of a benighted master.

But when the mind is at ease and unhurried, one may follow the teacher near or far, inquiring into and seeking the profound teaching. Thus, one entreats one’s parents, bids farewell to spouse and children, leaves behind the dwelling place, and journeys far into the mountains and forests, taking refuge in a pure abode. Casting off worldly attire and adornments, they don yellow-brown robes and a dark headcloth, forsaking worldly glory to devote themselves solely to the Dao—this is called first leaving the household of affection and attachment.\n\nHaving left the household, they diligently practice fasting and precepts, escape the three evil destinies, establish the root of faith, study stillness and enter emptiness, relinquish desire for the three realms, and ascend to the Nine Pure Realms—this is called leaving the household of all conditioned existence.

      "translated_text": "Lord Blue Lad asked: \"What is meant by precepts?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Precepts are of two kinds: one is 'with attainment,' the other is 'without attainment.' The precepts with attainment include the Three Precepts, Five Precepts, Eight Precepts, Nine Precepts, Ten Precepts, Twenty-Seven Precepts, One Hundred Eighty Precepts, and the Three Hundred Great Precepts. They restrain evil and prevent transgressions, yet without comprehending the expedient means—they are called precepts with attainment. They only prevent suffering in the three evil destinies and among humans, but do not enter the Dao’s domain. If one regards all dharmas of precepts as ultimately quiescent and empty, this is called the true precept. Without holding or transgressing, it opens the gate of right contemplation and serves as the root of the Dao.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad asked: \"What is meant by dwelling in seclusion in mountains and forests?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"This, too, is of two kinds. The lesser practitioner, timid and fearful of defilement by the dusts, enters cliffs, forests, and marshes to avoid impurities. Serene and composed, they cultivate pure conduct. The superior practitioner, dwelling in the world, fears no dust or toil. Though abiding in the mundane, they remain unstained, like a pearl or jade whose nature is luminous and pure. Abiding in the realm of wisdom, they rely on the formless wilderness—this is called skillfully understanding the aspect of mountain-dwelling.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad asked: \"What is the aspect of mindfulness of the Dao?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Mindfulness of the Dao universally subdues and extinguishes all evil aspects, like the adamantine force that severs all, like a fierce fire that burns all. Mindfulness is of two kinds: first, mindfulness of the birth-body, endowed with seventy-two marks and eighty-one excellences, perfectly subtle, uniquely exalted in the human and heavenly realms of the three spheres—this is my refuge and shelter. Second, mindfulness of the Dharma-body, like empty space, perfectly pure, is the true Dao, also called the Dao-body or Dao-nature. Constantly abiding in right mindfulness without interruption by other thoughts—this is called mindfulness of the Dao.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"I beg for the essential teaching—what is the aspect of mindfulness of scriptures?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Scriptures are of three kinds: the Great Vehicle, the Lesser Vehicle, and the Middle Vehicle. With focused mind, one receives and upholds them, constantly generating faith and reverence. Unwavering in contemplation, one discerns that this Dharma is the essential path, free from杂念—this is called mindfulness of scriptures. If one knows that all dharmas are originally without words, rightly contemplates true reality, and penetrates their purport, this too is called mindfulness of scriptures—this is called skillfully understanding the aspect of mindfulness of scriptures.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad asked: \"What is mindfulness of the teacher?\"\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"The teacher is like a father. Without a teacher, I could not attain the Dao. Therefore, one should follow closely, whether near or far, and with the mind’s eye, constantly visualize them as present, never wavering for even a moment, without turning elsewhere—this is called mindfulness of the teacher. One should also rightly contemplate all the great sages and perfected beings who have attained the Dao, for they are all teachers and treasures, all capable of instructing me. They are fertile fields of blessings; with focused mindfulness, one takes refuge in them, thought after thought unbroken, so that wayward thoughts do not arise—this is called mindfulness of the teacher.\"\n\nLord Blue Lad said: \"Now that my doubts are forever dispelled by this illumination, in future lives as men or women, I shall no longer be deluded.\" Having bowed in reverence, he returned to his seat.\n\nThe Most High Heavenly Worthy raised his hand and addressed the assembly: \"You should know that my true body is pure and unimpeded, like empty space—unborn, undying, eternally abiding in the quiescence of the great source of wisdom. Though profound and obscure, its essence is most trustworthy. For immeasurable kalpas, I have realized this true body, steadfast and unshaken, transcending all comparison, beyond the ken of sages or the understanding of ordinary beings. For the sake of sentient beings, I manifest a responsive body, wandering through the five destinies, adapting to conditions to liberate and guide, employing expedient means to lead all to awakening. According to the faculties of beings, I provisionally display forms and appearances—thus it is called the responsive body. Yet this responsive body, too, is without birth or death, without going or coming, eternally abiding and unchanging. For the benefit of all, it appears or withdraws differently, arousing diligence and preventing retrogression. All that should be done has been accomplished; what remains undone, the Dao Lord will fulfill. You, all the perfected beings, should together uphold and follow, and do not generate discriminating thoughts toward me.\"\n\nHaving spoken thus, he slowly ascended into the sky, and the assembly strained their eyes but could no longer see him. At that moment, the perfected beings choked with sobs, longing as if they had lost their parents, and looking up to the sky, they bowed in reverence. Turning to the Dao Lord, they recited a verse:\n\nThe supremely pure and wondrous true wisdom-body,\nTruly formless, none can behold.\nOnly the responsive form returns to the source—\nThus each harbors great sorrow.\n\nWe rely on the Most High, the Boundless Worthy,\nLike children who have lost their mother turning to a compassionate father.\nSentient beings are submerged in the fire of suffering—\nWe only pray for the timely shower of sweet dew,\nTo sever inverted thoughts and clinging minds,\nTo dissolve all views and extinguish wayward paths.\n\nThe Most High Dao Lord addressed the four assemblies: \"You should know that all dharmas are of the nature of emptiness and quiescence. The realm of birth and death is no different in essence—do not falsely entertain thoughts of going or coming. From the moment of initial resolve, recognize impermanence, each seek your own liberation, and escape the suffering of birth and death. The Heavenly Worthy’s teachings on precepts and exhortations are clear—strive diligently in cultivation and seek early liberation. Do not harbor sorrow or vexation, lest you waste your good efforts.\"",

What is meant by the true teaching?\"\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: \"Any scripture that possesses the twelve seals and accords with the Three Caverns is called a true scripture. All else is called heterodox dharma and should not be received or upheld. One should personally seek a teacher and carefully discern the distinction.\"",
