  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Great Mystery Collection**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Great Mystery Collection*\n**Ten fascicles.** Authored by Jin Hou Shanyuan.\n**Source text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Great Mystery Section.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Clarity Great Mystery Collection, Fascicle One*\n**By Hou Shanyuan of Gushe**\n\n#### **Chapter One: On the Primordial Transformation of Supreme Clarity**\nThe Primordial Transformation of Supreme Clarity unfolds in harmonious splendor, revealing the celestial chart.\nThat which precedes all things is the Dao.\nThat which ends only to begin anew is nature.\nWhen loyalty does not adhere to sectarianism, the countenance of one who embodies virtue becomes serene and profound—his temples and beard like jade set amidst luminous clarity, radiant with subtle grace.\nDelighting in the melody of harmonious winds, he intones the dawn of primordial essence. Unfettered in flight, he roams the paths of the Dao.\nThe Primordial Ancestor is vast yet without exterior, minute yet without interior; above, round like heaven; below, square like earth. In form and name, it inwardly unfolds the intermingling qi.\nBound by the east’s emergence and the west’s descent, the sun and moon rise and set.\nThe radiance of great transformation illumines all—mind and matter congeal in brilliance, none fail to respond to its command.\n\n#### **Chapter Two: The Path of Flourishing Virtue**\nThe path of flourishing virtue lies in its constant application.\nBehold the great image: the great image is formless. To give it form is to dazzle the eye, yet naturally its light overflows without limit.\nThus, even one as keen-sighted as Li Lou cannot attest to true wisdom.\nListen to the great sound: the great sound is soundless. To give it sound is to confuse the ear, yet naturally it harmonizes without direction.\nThus, even one as keen-eared as Shi Kuang cannot attest to true hearing.\nUtmost hearing, utmost wisdom, utmost adaptability, utmost penetration—all are bestowed within the Dao of the primordial and the level.\n\n#### **Chapter Three: Manifesting Things and Exhausting Principles**\nTo manifest things and exhaust principles is to embody stillness and receptivity.\nChew and shift the mysterious vision; let jade-like radiance and crimson essence flow forth.\nIn clarity, it conceals itself in the intervals; in life, it subdues decline.\nThe mechanism of fortune releases sorrow, attaining constancy; the pattern of pure extension severs the gate of calamity.\n\n#### **Chapter Four: Harmonizing with the Dao and Ascending to Perfection**\nTo harmonize with the Dao and ascend to perfection is to achieve meritorious virtue.\nMovement within the Three Realms is unobstructed only when no barriers exist.\nFirst: things follow transformation—this is the essence of the Dao. Responding and manifesting form is the function of spirit. To employ the useless is the ultimate use.\nSecond: the mechanism confronts the myriad forms, lifting the veils of ignorance. Shining yet not dazzling—this is the colorless. The color of the colorless is the ultimate color.\nThird: the tally of emptiness is not possession; clinging to possession is not emptiness. The emptiness of non-emptiness is called true emptiness.\nComprehending these in unity transcends all bounds.\n\n#### **Chapter Five: Fortifying Nature and Non-Birth**\nTo fortify nature and embrace non-birth is to delight in transformation. Responding with virtue ensures a life without obstruction.\nExternal meditation is expansive and relaxed; in vast emptiness and stillness, the human Dao merges with the celestial Dao.\nBreath harmonizes and fuses; the intermingling qi responds to signs. In luminous purity, the primordial qi and the vital qi connect.\nGaze fixed in auspicious concentration, the numinous bird descends as an omen; the two luminaries exchange radiance—pupil and sun-moon unite their brightness.\nThus, the Six Caverns of Flying Mystery and the wondrous transformations of the Three Palaces divide into the nine qi, converging into the One True.\nThe transformations of the One True lie in the action of non-action.\n\n#### **Chapter Six: On Gain and Loss**\nGain and loss differ in their application.\nTo gain is to treasure essence, cherish qi, preserve life, and nurture spirit—embracing the Dao and holding fast to virtue.\nTo lose is to indulge in greed and desire, mind in chaos and heart in desolation—forgetting one’s root and concealing one’s truth.\nTo penetrate the mystery and dispel falsehood, to invigorate numinous power and awaken wisdom, is to achieve the merit of resolute advancement.\n\n#### **Chapter Seven: Gathering Intent and Refining Thought**\nTo gather intent and refine thought is to attain joyful tranquility.\nWithin, the jade casket appears, resembling the visage of an infant.\nThe constancy of governing principle and the harmony of natural ease ensure no transgressions; the upright nature keenly senses the mechanism.\nTo silence it is not to shatter the eye but to heighten desire.\nTo model it is not to grind the inkstone but to strengthen vigilance.\nThe transformations of the inner pattern—unbounded and without fixed direction—lie in the action of non-transforming transformation.\n\n#### **Chapter Eight: The Dao’s Vast Embrace**\nThe Dao’s vast embrace extends without limit.\nAbove, it covers without bound, upholding the celestial net. Heaven’s roundness establishes its image; sun, moon, and stars descend. Their light hangs day and night, numinous and penetrating—none fail to align with its brightness.\nBelow, it governs without bound, grasping earth’s yielding nature. Earth’s squareness establishes its image; mountains and valleys fill and empty. Following the seasons, they release transformation—all things arise and are completed within it.\nUtmost vastness, utmost greatness—greatness encompasses all. Utmost subtlety, utmost minuteness—minuteness enters all. To extend it is to blend principles; to unify mechanisms is to harmonize all without exception.\n\n#### **Chapter Nine: The Dao Beyond Dao**\nThe Dao beyond Dao exists yet is forgotten. Following principle’s constancy, forgetting things yet preserving truth—this is how one attains its measure.\nResponding to things while forgetting the mind, abandoning principle’s constancy, preserving desire yet losing one’s root—this is how one invites inquiry.\nThe wise discern this distinction. Such is the seeing beyond sight—this is true seeing. The response beyond response—this is true response.\nTo respond without imposing transformation is to pervade the boundless Dao.\n\n#### **Chapter Ten: The Path of Inner Stillness**\nThe path of inner stillness knows the way to keen responsiveness.\nStillness governs movement; uprightness governs deviation.\nThe law of compliance and change fortifies the substance, unifying the casket. The movement of preserving the level initiates the constancy of abundance.\n\n#### **Chapter Eleven: The All-Transforming**\nTo be all-transforming is to attain great penetration.\nReceiving streams without overflowing—this is the Dao’s abyss.\nCongealing emptiness without filling—this is the Dao’s profundity.\nBlending qi without excess—this is the Dao’s vastness.\nPresent in court yet unseen—this is the Dao’s constancy.\nLingering in obscurity yet undimmed—this is the Dao’s principle.\n\n#### **Chapter Eleven (continued)**\nResponding to things without cessation—this is the Dao’s transformation.\nCommuning with spirits without loss—this is the Dao’s fidelity.\nBestowing life without discrimination—this is the Dao’s virtue.\nThose who turn their backs on it possess it in full; who can attest to its truth?\nThus do they cast themselves into ruin.\n\n#### **Chapter Twelve: Abandoning the False and Preserving the True**\nAbandoning the false and preserving the true, forgetting schemes and severing cares,\nall secrecy and pretense dissolve—sincerity of heart and steadfast resolve.\nAbiding in stillness, the clamor of disturbance brings no vexation;\nserene and holding to simplicity, the spirit’s breath rests in unbroken ease—\nthis is how clarity is distilled.\nAbiding in loyalty, the gourd of prohibitions knows no selfishness;\njoyful and nurturing vastness, pure and flourishing—\nthis is how fidelity is established.\nAbiding in virtue, humility veils its light, essence and refinement embrace all;\nthe unadulterated wind conceals its resonance—\nthis is how the Dao is joined.\nThe true Dao walks alone; the defiled Dao is wholly consumed.\nTo know this as an obstacle is to miss the mark.\n\n#### **Chapter Thirteen: Utmost Sincerity, Utmost Rectitude**\nUtmost sincerity, utmost rectitude—delusion and awakening are two mechanisms.\nThe deluded cling to illusion;\nthe awakened refine their truth.\nTruth is not seen by the eye—gazing upon it dazzles the senses.\nIllusion is not grasped by the mind—discerning it verifies wisdom.\nThe spirit fills the empty valley; abundance must roam freely.\nSevering yet penetrating it—this is the repose of sitting in the flowering garden.\n\n#### **Chapter Fourteen: Turning from Awakening to Merge with Dust**\nTurning from awakening to merge with dust is to revert to the supreme Dao.\nThe possession of possessions is foreseen by the possession of no-possession—\ngaining it, one loses it, thus becoming a peril to the body.\nThe use of uses is foreseen by the use of no-use—\npreserving it, one forgets it, thus becoming a fetter to the heart.\nThe color of colors is foreseen by the color of no-color—\nilluminating it, one obscures it, thus becoming a dazzlement to the eyes.\nThe sound of sounds is foreseen by the sound of no-sound—\nspeaking of it, one silences it, thus becoming a strain to the ears.\nThe transformation of transformations is foreseen by the transformation of no-transformation—\nrescuing it, one betrays it, thus becoming a confusion to the spirit.\nUpholding correctness and returning to purity, refining thought and sharpening responsiveness—\nthis is how one skillfully severs all faults.\n\n#### **Chapter Fifteen: Refining the Subtle and Radiant**\nRefining the subtle and radiant—why chase after mere adornments?\nClamor and splendor each cling to their vessels;\nsecrecy and favor each invite their transgressions.\nYet in the midst of resplendent ornamentation, one suddenly awakens—\nthe spirit’s eyes open wide, the celestial breath rests in tranquil repose,\nsitting in the attainment of spontaneity.\nSpontaneity as such is not spontaneity;\nnot-spontaneity as spontaneity—this is the perfection of spontaneity.\n\n#### **Eulogy**\nSeeking the true and revering the teachings, aspirations and vows remain earnest.\n\n**Purification of Heart and Spirit**\n\nPurifying the heart and washing away filth, sweeping defilement and banishing impurity.\nThe two majestic spirits in serene meditation, severing sharpness and shattering miasmic vapors.\nForgetting form yet retaining essence, shedding falsity to preserve the true.\nThe body like scattered fragments, its function akin to linked jade.\nThe Jade Void brims with fullness, the Numinous Treasure overflows with purity.\nSupporting the dawn and aiding the subtle, one contracts with the Dao and ascends at daybreak.\nThe Primordial Unity congeals its origin, the Great One remains undivided.\nPreceding heaven through its transformations—this is called \"generating the spirit.\"\n\n---\n\n### **The Dao of Supreme Purity: First Chapter**\nThe Dao of Supreme Purity, wondrously transforming without bound.\nA single qi divides, and heaven and earth are sundered; the Two Modes unite, and sun and moon shine.\nThe Three Powers respond to their images, the myriad things flourish and grow.\nNurturing the spirit and circulating qi, preserving and refining the primordial essence.\nCongealing and transforming it, suddenly an image appears.\nRespond to it, and the thousand perfected all govern; penetrate it, and the ten thousand sages all attain.\nThe thousand perfected and ten thousand sages—none are not within it.\nThis awakening and illumination—this is called the essential subtlety of the Primordial Subtle.\n\n### **The Radiant Mysterious Yang: Second Chapter**\nThe Radiant Mysterious Yang, blazing bright across the ten directions.\nScattering the splendor of jade and crystal, releasing the auspicious signs of jade瑞.\nAbove, it pervades the celestial net; below, it covers the earth’s softness.\nExpanding the pivot of the myriad transformations, wielding the handle of the thousand mechanisms.\nThings do not receive it and do not live; spirits do not commune with it and do not become numinous.\nThe numinous nourishes the host of wonders, shining resplendent across the five directions in their time.\n\n### **The Resplendent Void and Brightness: Third Chapter**\nThe Resplendent Void and Brightness, roaring and blazing with intermingled light.\nIts flames kindle the brilliance of sun and moon, its beacons blaze through the bodies of heaven and earth.\nDazzling and radiant, it revolves through the myriad cycles of the numinous.\nFreely penetrating and all-pervading, it encompasses the thousand isles in their entirety.\nWithin, the coalesced pearl is transmitted through the lineage of numinous sages.\nAscending to the Crimson Empyrean’s palace, seated in repose at the Nine Yang’s gate.\nThe Emperor commands the immortals and perfected to extend their years, their distant lifespans bound to the One without decay.\n\n### **The Body of the Primordial Beginning: Fourth Chapter**\nThe body of the Primordial Beginning, immaculate and empty, full of purity.\nUnadorned and without thing, tranquil and without form.\nThe formless form that nurtures all forms,\nthe colorless color that unfurls all colors.\nNeither non-being nor being, yet being and non-being respond of themselves.\nNeither movement nor stillness, yet movement and stillness follow of themselves.\nHeaven does not receive it and does not become clear; earth does not sense it and does not become tranquil.\nThings do not commune with it and do not transform; spirits do not receive it and do not become numinous.\nThe constancy of the Perfect Dao—humans dwell within it yet use it daily without knowing.\nAs fish in water do not recognize their water, humans in the Dao do not recognize the Dao.\nWhen fish recognize water, they avoid the depths, refuse fragrant bait, and in time grow vast—\nleaping beyond Lü Liang, transforming into dragons, thus attaining the water’s mystery.\nWhen humans recognize the Dao, they dwell in seclusion, abandoning ornament and thinning desires,\ninwardly preserving primordial qi, outwardly embracing the spirit’s wind.\nIn time, when their merit is complete, they transcend the Mysterious Pass,\ntransform into feathered transcendents, and true persons confer their ordination—\nthus attaining the Dao’s essentials.\n\n### **Refining Thought Within and Without: Fifth Chapter**\nRefining thought within and without, inwardly containing numinous wisdom.\nTempering the true form like jade, transforming the flesh until it is bloodless.\nA body like frost and ice—this is the principle of preserving essence to safeguard life.\nOutwardly embracing the spirit’s wind, the spirit soars on spread wings,\nlightly ascending the mysterious, beyond life and death, unpredictable—\npassing through metal and stone, roaming beyond the four quarters—\nthis is the mechanism of refining the spirit to unite with the Dao.\n\n### **The Mechanism of Movement and Stillness: Sixth Chapter**\nThe mechanism of movement and stillness, skillfully applied without force.\nIlluminating the chaotic image before the Lord of Heaven, comprehending the great cavern beyond the empty valley.\nIn stillness, vast and boundless, without mind, standing alone and transcendent—the great body severs its obstructions.\nIn movement, inwardly deploying primordial qi, outwardly blazing the spirit’s light,\nmerging into the Great Void, pervading and filling the true within.\nReturning to the origin, pure and without admixture; realizing the ancestor, offering without measure.\nThus, the wind of plucking the zither—mind without views of severance or constancy.\n\n### **The Divisions of the Great Simplicity: Seventh Chapter**\nThe divisions of the Great Simplicity, circling thrice complete.\nFirst, the realm of the eternal and peerless, vast and without corner,\ncovering and bearing all things without fail—this is called the domain of the Imperial Palace.\nSecond, supporting the pupil and flowing with radiance, dazzling all directions,\nnurturing all things without fail—this is called the land of Flourishing Yang.\nThird, releasing transformation and ascending to jade-like purity, congealing auspicious splendor,\nenveloping the womb within—this is called the homeland of nurturing the self.\n\n### **The Form Born of Turbid Substance: Eighth Chapter**\nThe form born of turbid substance, a heart washed clean as snow.\nA heart pure and desireless, its majesty upright and awe-inspiring.\nIn movement, it responds to the void; in emptiness, it overflows with qi.\nQi robust, it preserves essence; essence robust, it preserves the spirit.\nThe spirit not numinous, the Dao not clear; qi not settled, the nature not illuminated.\nIlluminating the obscure without fixation—this is communion with the true.\nThe wings of communion with the true emerge beyond the prior heaven.\n\n### **The Dao Revered Without Rank: Ninth Chapter**\nThe Dao revered without rank, its counterpart without peer.\nExpanding the myriad transformations, grandly grasping the thousand mechanisms—\nyet the Great Dao is not sufficient to be its thing, though it is the image of no-image.\nMountains and peaks collapse, winds and thunder rage violently—\nyet the Great Dao is not sufficient to be its sound, though it is the tone of no-tone.\nBoring through the nine earths, descending to the Yellow Springs—\nyet the Great Dao is not sufficient to be its depth, though it is the abyss without bottom.\nGazing to the three heavens, ascending to the vast celestial realm—\nyet the Great Dao is not sufficient to be its height, though it is the apex without summit.\nSun, moon, and stars radiate, their intermingled light dazzling, illuminating the ten directions—\nyet facing our Great Dao, they are not sufficient to be its brightness.\nThe Great Void empty of things, penetrating and without mind, desolate and without trace—\nyet facing our Great Dao, it is not sufficient to be its emptiness.\nUtterly mysterious, utterly wondrous—this is the origin of the ten thousand dharmas.\nUtterly obscure, utterly subtle—this is the ancestor of the three vehicles.\nWise yet inexhaustible, spirit-like yet unfathomable—what sage could this be?\nIt is the principle of the Supreme Mysterious Origin.\n\n### **Utmost Sincerity Without Deceit: Tenth Chapter**\n\n**Utmost Sincerity Without Deceit: Tenth Chapter**\n\nUtmost sincerity is free from deceit, naturally devoid of thought.\nThe nature traverses open paths—like the dragon’s scales, the radiance of sun and moon.\nThe spirit soars to the Mysterious Capital—like the phoenix’s plumes, the form of Heaven and Earth.\nIts course leaves no trace, its adversaries leave no mark, as transformations unfold within the revolving cosmos.\nIt ever dwells in the realm of Mount Tai and Hua.\n\n**Transformations of the Spirit-Machine: Eleventh Chapter**\n\nTransformations of the spirit-machine—six perfections share the same principle.\nFirst: nourishing the body without obstruction, the five viscera all unblocked, the seven orifices responding without discord.\nSecond: knocking at the Dao’s profound depths, plumbing its vast expanse, great elucidation embraces all images without exception.\nThird: primordial qi flows and circulates, pervading the empty and boundless, spreading transformation to harmonize all things.\nFourth: the thoroughfare qi preserves fullness, inner bestowal unceasing, merging and blending the primordial of harmonious principle.\nFifth: the fetal radiance is subtle and recondite, its glances swift as shooting stars, its interweaving dense as clouds—none fails to preserve its brilliance.\nSixth: the spirit-lord emerges in transformation, blazing like the sun in lofty flight, pearls, jade, gold, and stone—none fails to emit its light.\nAbove, it aligns with the Three Palaces—this is called qi within qi, spirit within spirit, Dao within Dao, the three vehicles merged as one, like the Great Void’s image of no-thing.\n\n**Pervasive Illumination of Knowing Clarity: Twelfth Chapter**\n\nPervasive illumination of knowing clarity—who can attest to its wisdom?\n\nIn application yet not attuned to its constancy, in substance yet not exhausting its quiescence.\nThe deeper the flaw, the more profound the emotion—following the current and losing the source, forsaking the root to chase the branches, those who stray far from the Dao’s standard perish.\nThe time for nurturing goodness, the resolve of utmost sincerity, released and enlightened, the essence pervades the Great Void—none differ therein.\n\n**Unwavering Integrity and Purity: Thirteenth Chapter**\n\nUnwavering integrity and purity, vigilant and sincere in earnest.\nGentle and pure, reverent and yielding, harmonious and unobstructed.\nIntegrity means guarding the true with no desire, embracing the Dao without selfishness.\nPurity means dwelling in the dust yet unstained, holding jade without flaw.\nVigilance means acting only by principle, following only the Dao.\nSincerity means upright loyalty without crookedness, correct faith without deviation.\nGentleness means yang arising in accord with destiny, qi transforming to return to spirit.\nPurity means radiant and unstained, luminous and without intent.\nReverence means ceaseless operation, following transformation without fixed form.\nUnobstructed means merging with the Dao as one, pure and without admixture.\nAdvancing goodness without restraint—this is the essence of attaining the Dao.\n\n**Nurturing Essence and Cultivating Qi: Fourteenth Chapter**\n\nNurture essence and cultivate qi, preserve and refine spirit and truth.\nThe body light and graceful, supple and drifting with the wind, riding the swiftness of the Six Voids, roaming beyond the great expanse—transforming without blemish, following opportunity and destiny, responding to change without losing constancy.\nDescending, it aligns with earth’s tranquility, giving life to the myriad things, uncrafted yet naturally fulfilling its work.\nAscending, it aligns with heaven’s clarity, weaving the myriad images in silence, unlit yet naturally displaying its brilliance.\nAbiding in the center without loss, it merges with the Void’s transformation, governing the myriad spirits, untransmitted yet naturally attaining its measure.\nThus, the vast and sagely embrace all directions, and even those who reach the mysterious yang are but a fraction of this all-embracing vastness.\n\n**The Dao Is Eternally Without Thing: Fifteenth Chapter**\n\nThe Dao is eternally without thing, primordial qi interpenetrating the origin, modeling heaven and earth, nurturing and maturing all—all lies within it.\nWhether born from womb, egg, moisture, or transformation, all creatures with spirit rely on its virtue.\nWaters, valleys, mountains, plains, metals, stones, grasses, and trees—none fail to borrow its truth.\nIf one awakens to this, preserves essence without loss, nurtures vastness without depletion, refines form and spirit, and merges into oneness, this is called the principle of the mysterious within the mysterious.\n\n**Eulogy**\n\nIn the dawn of the great antiquity, the mysterious yang unfolded in transformation.\nThe primordial spirit-lord opened, the fetal radiance flashed in an instant.\nThe Yellow Thearch’s luminous thoroughfare, the azure vastness brightly illumined.\nBelow, it connects to the source-sea; above, it penetrates the cosmic net.\nThe golden hall gathers splendor, the precious cavern congeals auspiciousness.\nLight like jade fragments, lustrous as frost and ice.\nMelting and nourishing the cinnabar body, alchemizing the spirit’s realm.\nBoundless wondrous principle, unfathomable true constancy.\nEmbracing the origin and knowing contentment, one dies yet does not perish.\n\n**Treatise on Perfect Illumination**\n\n**First Chapter: Before Chaos Opened**\n\nBefore chaos opened, it dwelled in the indistinct, dim and obscure, no form discernible, dark and misty—how could clarity arise?\nWhen the primal chaos was kneaded and split, the initial division appeared: the manifestation of primordial qi was the operation of utmost essence; the movement of ascent and descent was determined by floating and sinking.\nHeaven and earth expanded in their covering and bearing, the sun and moon took form in their illumination, the myriad things received life and completion.\nThrough communication and transformation, it becomes supremely spiritual—nothing it cannot do, nowhere it does not reach.\nCalled to respond to its substance, employ its truth, establish its image, attain its spirit, and ride its governance and trust—this is how one may perfect sagely achievement.\n\n**Second Chapter: The Dao’s Utmost Nonbeing**\n\nThe Dao’s utmost nonbeing becomes its utmost being.\nBeing is the transformation of spirit; nonbeing is the extremity of stillness.\nThe path of movement and stillness is the image of celestial patterns and the form of earthly principles.\nThe changes of the central breath: if preserved, its numen endures to the point of destiny; if violated, its essence scatters to the point of nature.\nCalled resplendent yet without trace, released yet responsive—this is the full embodiment of yang.\nEmbodying it fully is merging with its truth; possessing all things is burdening the self.\nWhen the self is not imperiled, it emerges beyond heaven and earth—peerless indeed!\n\n**Third Chapter: The Eon of Constant Principles**\n\nIn the eon of constant principles, one relies on feathers to know direction.\nThose who labor in transformation externally seal it, internally unfold it.\nGovernance through stubbornness descends; descent through opposition sinks.\nCalled round and molded: internally enclosed, externally opened, governance through harmony ascends, ascent through regulation floats.\nThe communication of ascent, the preservation of descent, the breath of the center—without loftiness and clarity, who could attain this?\n\n**Fourth Chapter: The Governance of Primordial Qi**\n\nThe governance of primordial qi divides and transforms to generate form.\nEstablishing its substance, returning to truth, governing through the Dao—this is the utmost of the image-lord.\nCalled the origin of communication, the precursor of merging, illuminated in all directions, manifesting the principle of singular truth.\nWhat does this mean?\nGoverning through nature, reaching destiny, released and transformed, the primordial precedes heaven.\nThe system of the primordial, the ease of position—this is how one may return to the image.\n\n**Fifth Chapter: The Transformation of Primordial Unity**\n\nThe transformation of primordial unity is the division of qi and image.\nGoverning movement and stillness is the operation of floating and sinking.\nCalled: heaven and earth establish their positions, mountains and marshes connect their qi, rivers and valleys fill their voids, and the void’s attainment of its spirit.\nIs it the essence of the Dao’s transformation, or the blood vessels of virtue’s transformation?\nObserving above and below, it resembles the body of a plant, the breath of the central current, the function of a maple.\nCalled near yet unapproachable—those who approach it grow distant.\nDistant yet unneglectable—those who neglect it draw near.\nThose who attain transformation grasp the realm of near and far.\nWithout delving into traces, who can comprehend this?\n\n**Sixth Chapter: Governing the Myriad Images**\n\nGoverning the myriad images, merging into the attainment of emptiness.\n\n**Seventh Chapter: The Heavenly Body of Qian’s Origin**\n\nVast in nature, abundant in preservation—what lies to left and right is discerned through the essence of meaning.\nFollowing principle is the gradual advance of refinement.\nIlluminating the Dao is the steadfast sincerity of control.\nCalled: the hard is the body, the soft is its function.\nThe purity of hardness and softness is the ultimate of the *Yi*’s images.\nCalled: the Dao’s transformation, virtue’s generation.\nHeaven and earth divide into clarity and turbidity; sun and moon move within their measured paths.\nThe myriad things submit to creation’s work—when transformation stirs desire, it is ever restrained.\nTo restrain it is to return to the center of the perfect Dao.\n\n**Eighth Chapter: The Sincere and Solemn Will**\n\nThe sincere and solemn will is the heart’s estimation.\nYi Yin in nature—nature’s serenity.\nIf not so, then refine and polish it, lamenting governance that remains unenlightened.\nCalled: rigid in form, indolent in nature—this is deep delusion, grave confusion.\nCalled: silently yet keenly acting, clearly yet penetratingly understanding—what does this mean?\nIt is that the sage illuminates emptiness and non-being as essence, and manifests spirit and transformation as function.\nSoaring and wheeling, dazzling as scattered gems—delivered to perfect principle, radiant at the center of heaven and earth.\n\n**Ninth Chapter: Embracing the One and Returning to Simplicity**\n\nEmbracing the One and returning to simplicity, centered in seeing the plain.\nDesire before it sprouts is directed toward the primordial image.\nReturning to the perfect Dao is reverting to the divine lord.\nCalled: forgetting its unity, pursuing secret forms and names—when resentment and carelessness arise, it becomes a lifelong affliction.\nExhausting principle is the ease of the constant Dao.\nThe spirit of the perfect Dao is the utmost penetration of spirit, illuminating the myriad wonders and entering the gate of mystery.\n\n**Tenth Chapter: The Reality of Flourishing Virtue**\n\nThe reality of flourishing virtue does not mix with things.\nClear, empty, vast, and boundless, it responds to transformation without end.\nIts ceaseless movement is one with heaven and earth.\nWhen emotions and nature are not focused, diverging from the Dao, regret and sorrow arise, leading to calamity.\nPolishing and refining them leads to nature.\nCalled: embracing reality releases falsehood.\nSupporting the upright removes the perverse.\nCalled: like the awe of a formidable foe, emerging transformed with sudden clarity—this is the demeanor of one who watches and waits with reverence.\nIlluminating the ultimate unity, preserving profit and purity, relying on Qian’s function—this is riding the achievement of change.\n\n**Eleventh Chapter: The Vastness of Qian’s Origin**\n\nThe vastness of Qian’s origin is boundless and without direction.\nIts Dao grows ever greater—how can one fathom it?\nThe signs of contraction and expansion, the swift glance of divine insight.\nMoving through perfect spirit is gathering in constant use.\nCalled: gathering in profound contemplation, governing through the One’s convergence.\nAttaining principle—who cannot become self-enlightened?\nCalled: departing from delusion, entering awakening, embracing virtue, guarding against peril, illuminating the resource of the perfect Dao, shining upon the world—all things follow its transformation.\nCalled: none fail to rest in their allotted place, none fail to fulfill their destiny.\nFollowing this to practice the Dao brings benefit and enrichment to all directions—is this not the beginning of the profound mystery?\n\n**Twelfth Chapter: The Dao’s Law Relies on Purity**\n\nThe Dao’s law relies on purity, profoundly still and unmoving.\nDeep as an abyss, empty as a void—dim and boundless.\nThe cycle of ascent and descent is the operation of floating and sinking.\nCalled: the virtue of compliance and gentleness, the achievement of excellence and beauty, adapting to time and changing with circumstances.\nTransformation’s image returns to reality, revealing the end of its linked brilliance—this is the culmination of the storehouse’s inception.\nCalled: at the boundary of the Great Mystery, perfect virtue harmonizes all.\nDiligent and earnest—this is the tranquil garden of the Upper Clarity’s palace.\n\n**Thirteenth Chapter: The Myriad Transformations Open the Origin**\n\nThe myriad transformations open the origin, attaining the One’s reality.\nThe One reality’s change—nothing vast is not penetrated, nothing minute is not reached.\nGathering in the myriad wonders is illuminating the primordial image.\nCalled: ascending jade-like radiance, entering profound depths, congealing flame and breath, compassing without corners—this is the rule of the companion’s model.\nCompanions changing and aligning, black above Qian’s origin, overlooking the myriad images—this is the storehouse’s transformation before the Great Beginning.\n\n**Fourteenth Chapter: The Way of the Storehouse’s Nourishment**\n\nThe way of the storehouse’s nourishment is mighty and all-pervading.\nVast and boundless—soaring traces appear and flourish.\nCalled: exhausting principle—why regret sorrow?\nBefore it manifests, one cannot preserve harmony, and flaws obstruct clarity.\nThus the sage’s keenness is silent yet settled, open yet ascending—this is supporting insight and unfolding wisdom.\nCalled: shifting the gaze and entwining the spirit, its virtue is keen.\nVast in teaching’s achievement—this is the assembly that covers and sustains all.\n\n**Fifteenth Chapter: Culmination in the Perfect Dao**\n\nCulmination in the perfect Dao does not cling to deliberate action.\nNot relying on nature—how could it be so?\n\n**Min said:** To verify transformation in pure *gui*—the essence’s true perfection—brilliant and congealed in radiance: ah! This is the origin of the ten thousand forms.\n\n**Yi-zi said:** The master’s existence is thus.\n**He asked:** Is it so?\n**He answered:** What could it be?\n**He said:** Before Heaven’s before, the perfect Dao’s beginning—beginning and end unchanging.\nThe perfect Dao’s origin, the origin’s transformation—this may be taken as my master.\n**He said:** Great indeed is the numinous luminosity! Pervading the Brahmā-realm, profound and boundless without limit, it gives birth to Heaven and Earth, wherein the ten thousand transformations abide.\nAdapting to every direction, its transformations are inexhaustible; responding to the level, its responses are unbounded.\nOne who illuminates the multitude of forms—this is the spirit of my attainment of the Dao.\n\n**The Reading states:**\nThe

radiance.\nNo darkness remains unillumined: it precedes Heaven’s precelestial state.\nNo transformation fails to arise: it governs the Great Simplicity of the *Yi*.\nPursue it without end, fathom it without measure.\nNameless, formless—\nYet because it is without name or form, nothing exists beyond its naming and shaping.\nThe sun’s gourd glows with ordered brilliance, circling in stillness alone.\nThe Dao of Heaven flows ceaselessly, encompassing all;\nThe mind’s pattern flows ceaselessly, resonating with all.\nComing and going, they meet—substance and essence without fixed form.\nWithout fixed form: this is called \"without form that is not form.\"\n\n**Chapter Two: Subtlety Manifests Without Extremity**\nSighs at dawn, why mimic the measures of the ancient worthies?\nLater schools, straying into side doors, cling to resentment and error.\nGreedy for advancement, recklessly hasty—who can remain serene in sorrow for the Great Dao?\nThus, the Dao does not wither or obstruct.\nMaster Rixuan observes inwardly and attains sudden awakening.\nImages without fragrance or luster—first sketching their sorrow—\nThe Perfect Dao moves from dawn to dusk without cease.\nThe key lies in curbing desires, stilling the net of cares to nurture one’s destiny.\n\n**Chapter Three: Convulsions Between Life and Death**\nConvulsions in life and death—how unlike the hidden repose of the profound!\nFrom life to death, from death to life—\nWithin the cycle of life and death, who can align with the true principle?\nNi said: The maidservant in the nether bureau,

Three Clarities, self-attuned.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Unfolding of the Divine**\nThe bronze cauldron unfolds the divine—its questions cannot be exhausted.\nThose who grasp abundance and attain prosperity first bestow virtue;\nThose who suffer poverty and resent their fate only receive blessings belatedly.\nYet in matters of life and death, gain and loss—\nThis is one, that is another.\nMaster Xuan’s words, when applied, are never untrue.\n\n**Chapter Six: Grasping Without Perception**\nEyes that do not perceive, ears that do not comprehend—\nClarity and wisdom have their appointed time, hindered by external things.\nMaster Yixu sighs: \"Voices harmonize with sounds, things connect—\nYet in the emptiness of coming and going, how can dawn be reached?\"\nMaster Taoyi said: \"Emptiness that is not empty, things that are not things—\nAll things arise naturally, and the natural is eternally so.\nNothing fails to attain its proper state.\"\n\n**Chapter Seven: Observing the Profound and Vigorous**\nProfound and vigorous, like water shaping the abyss;\nRefined and majestic, governing with orchid-like grace.\nFollow the Dao, and the image abides in tranquil

penetrating—\nExchanging for emptiness and purity, who can fathom its hidden depths?\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Crown of Governance Opens the Constant**\nThe crown of governance opens the constant, attuned to transformation.\nGrasping the profound is like a fleeting glimpse of Yan Hui’s thought—\nAwakening and weariness merge with the mysterious, all relying on its truth.\nMaster Yuanguan: \"Perfect clarity attains brightness—brightness in great simplicity.\nVast and luminous in supreme eloquence—eloquence without extremity.\"\nMaster Xuanyang said: \"Merging and flowing with light,

Shun, in harmony, blooms into perfect perception;\nMaster Er, in harmony, awakens into perfect clarity.\nMaster Xuan, hearing this, laughed: \"To observe with the mind and exhaust the body is to lose the Dao.\nMy heart is not for seeing or hearing, nor for clarity or enlightenment.\nNot one form, yet not many bodies.\nUnfathomable yet inexhaustible, unmade yet accomplished,\nUnmoving yet arrived,

seals the earth’s gates, brilliance illumines Heaven’s doors.\nThe Kunlun Mountains pour forth their essence, rivers and seas flow with their essence.\nClimbing the numinous to restore life, the myriad transformations return to the root.\nThe use of no-use, divine without divinity—\nFloating and sinking define their forms, clear and turbid distinguish themselves.\nThe stubborn vessel converges as one, wisdom and judgment attain harmony.\nWaning and waxing complete each other, sending off the old and welcoming the new.\nPrinciples like jade wheels, eyes like ice orbs—\nExchanging emptiness for images, governing with brilliance untouched by dust.\nEmbracing the vast and divine, enduring through kalpas.\n---\n\n**Treatise on Penetrating the Real**\n**Chapter One: The Beginning of the Great Commencement**\nAt the beginning of the Great Commencement, it arose before Heaven and Earth.\nGenerative transformations without end, governing the essence of nature.\nMysterious and unfathomable, the root and origin of the myriad transformations.\nLuminous and boundless—this is the essence of the Perfect Dao.\nMaster Zi said: \"In solemn stillness, wandering between water and moon—\nNot controlling form, yet transforming like the destiny of a kingdom.\nSerene and flowing, the clear abyss attains its Dao.\"\n\n**Chapter Two: Governance Transforms and the Primordial Flows Through**\nGovernance transforms and the primordial flows through—exchanging to attain the purest essence of Liu Chun.\nIts spirit cannot be swayed by the most intimate of companions;\nits ghosts cannot deceive it.\nClumsy or skillful, all who awaken to its numinous leech\nand embrace its harmonious ease\nare employed by the Dao without exception.\n\nOne says:\n\"Zhongzi does not wander—\ngazing from the hall, he shifts his chamber,\nabandoning the chamber to refine his true seeing.\nIs this not the uprightness of the inner chamber’s song?\"\n\n**Chapter Three: The Radiant Response of Yang**\nThe radiant response of Yang—\nthe heart’s glance cannot grasp its essence.\nThus, the worst of delusions and illusions\ngradually attain their penetration.\nWho can obscure it?\nKnow that Master Guo and Zhan the Duke\ndiscussed this with the lofty scholar.\nEven at the foundation of the Great Mystery,\nthough a thousand *li* distant,\nthey grasped the luminous truth and beheld the divine flight of cinnabar’s crucible.\nFeathers and tablets reached the source’s end in the great square—\nhow could they be bound by the emotions of planted trees?\n\n**Chapter Four: The Soaring and the Joining of Companions**\nThe soaring and the joining of companions—\nits Dao does not act for trust alone.\nLeisurely, it flows through;\neffortlessly, it enters.\nGreat indeed!\nIts body is vast and without limit.\n\nIt is said:\n\"Zijiao is keen—\nhis ears can turn, his eyes can perceive.\nIs this not the ultimate of the pupil’s glance?\nOnly the sage,\ntranscending brightness and darkness to reach divine transformation,\nis neither used nor unused.\"\n\n**Chapter Five: The Treasury of Primordial Unity**\nThe Treasury of Primordial Unity—\nthe darksome thread at the center.\n\n**The Divine Transformation and the Square of Feathered Blood**\n\nThe divine transformation links with change—\nfeathers and blood meet at the square.\nThe sun’s gaze is the emptiness of non-emptiness;\nthe enchantress is the existence of non-existence.\nHere, the numinous dawns,\nhere, the Dao is born.\nStirred by the interplay of void and solid,\none chews the principle of being and non-being.\n\nIt is said:\n\"The cuttlefish governs the abyss,\nyet feeds not on the highest good.\nThe swan commands its qi,\nyet does not order the true origin.\"\nAlas! How radiant are the heart and eyes of the enlightened—\nwho could obstruct the flourishing of their Dao?\n\n**Chapter Six: The Dao Harmonizes with Pristine Essence**\n\nThe Dao transcends pristine

clarity of the earth’s essence—\nsuch is the Dao that may be called sagely.\"\n\n**Chapter Seven: The Subtle and Pristine**\n\nSubtle and pristine,\nstartling as a burst of radiance,\nthe form of the bound and the mutilated—\nhow could it attain brightness?\nThe appearance of the listless and the scattered—\nhow could it govern the real?\n\nIt is said:\n\"Xiazi, alert and soaring above the harmony of all images,\nchews it whole and leads the ten thousand spirits to follow of themselves.\nFrom above and below, the scrutiny of floating and sinking—\nall converges at the true center.\"\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Numinous Without Limit**\n\nThe numinous without limit—\nstillness unmoving.\nThe Dao unfolds without form,\nyet luminously pervades all.\n\nIt is said:\n\"Jingzi dams it—\nhow could he wield its bait?\nNie’s acuity—\nis it not the essence of wakefulness?\nYet these two stand tall without plumbing its depths.\"\n\nIt is said:\n\"Observe the near, yet do not

scrutiny of the ancient Dao—\nfeathers ascend the vermilion towers of heaven.\n\nHuazi, resplendent,\nshines at the center of heaven and earth.\nThe auspicious omen of empty whiteness—\nnot the brightest of daily use,\nnor the blindness of the sightless and the dull.\n\nIt is said:\n\"The use of the useless—\nits use is formless.\nThe transformation of the untransformed—\nits transformation is imageless.\nAs for the primordial image—\nit has ever been revered.\"\n\n**Chapter Ten: The Near and the Generation of All Things**\n\nApproaching the generation of all things—\nthis is the ultimate principle, vast and without intent.\n\nIt is said:\n\"The Dao is pure and unadulterated.\"\n\"The essence is pristine, secluded, and refined.\"\n\"The qi responds and pervades.\"\n\"The numinous floats and sinks, settling the body.\"\n\"Man masters ascent and descent.\"\n\"The guest harmonizes qi and flows with yang.\"\n\"Transformation aligns with the numinous and images the

upon mystery, from the prepared to the inconceivable.\"\n\n**Profound and Subtle Discourse**\n\n**Chapter One: The Vast Goodness of Obscured Vision**\n\nVast goodness, obscured vision—\nrescued by plain stillness.\nDarkness is that which thins its sound;\nbrightness is that which dissolves its form.\nAt the juncture of the constant,\nbenevolence and righteousness are established.\nWho, in calming the heart,\nlacks true faith?\n\nNi said to Yu Yuanzi Jing:\n\"The luster of Kun’s peak, polished into jade,\nmerges into the radiance of a precious orb.\nEmpty whiteness fills the numinous—\nthe essence of the supreme Dao.\nUnmixed with things—\nthe origin of the supreme Dao.\"\n\n**Chapter Two: The Constant of Suspended Judgment**\n\nThe constant of suspended judgment—\nits mechanism distant, its demeanor serene.\nThus it is said:\n\"That which is neither permissible nor impermissible—\nthis is the Dao that can be spoken.\nThat which is neither constant nor inconstant—\nthis is the constant Dao.\"\nConfounding life and death, mingling things—\nthe ultimate principle is beyond shame and regret.\n\nNi said:\n\"Yu Muzi Zhou, with luminous abundance and

indeed!\nIt traverses the boundaries of heaven and earth,\ntransforms the joy of the ten thousand things.\nThings and self are not constant;\nself and things are not the other.\n\nNi said:\n\"Yu Liuzi, penetrating the cavern of Wei’s integrity—\nthe crane’s cap, laboring yet awakening to radiant enlightenment—\nis the morning proof of the island’s numinous dawn.\"\n\n**Chapter Four: The Chessboard and the Cliff’s Edge**\n\nOffering only the maid’s toil,\nfeeding desires in distant enclosures—\nheart and things in restless tug—\nhow could one not be stripped bare,\nbecoming

Ford’s Great Brahmā, all was boundless and lightless—profoundly obscure, utterly silent, its nature unknown. Then, true essence stirred and aroused, primordial qi flowed and circulated, heaven and earth took form, and the myriad beings came into existence.\n\nYet among the myriad beings, only humans are noble: cultivate the Way, and they ascend; lose it, and they fall. If one can turn the gaze inward to return to the origin, embody the One to enter wondrous perfection, abide in softness and dwell in emptiness, conceal traces and hide radiance—then their Dao is called victorious, their virtue flourishing.\n\nTo discriminate is to invite manifold disgrace; to illuminate is to invite manifold obstruction. To grasp is to invite manifold loss; to preserve is to invite manifold dissolution. Only one who knows advance and retreat, waxing and waning, and never strays from the true center of heaven and earth—how could fortune or misfortune, benefit or harm, ever bring them to ruin?\n\nSuch virtue cannot be clarified by settling, nor muddied by stirring—it is wondrous and non-doing. It cannot be adorned to gain glory, nor defiled to suffer shame—it is mysterious and spontaneous.\n\nVast and obscure! Within it lies essence.\nFlickering and indistinct! Within it lies truth.\nFormless form,\nobjectless image.\nIt encompasses the Great Ultimate,\nembraces the six directions.\nDwelling at the edge yet abiding in wonder,\ndetached from things yet preserving the real.\n\nIts principle is constant, yet seen differently by the vulgar.\nIts Dao is universal, yet embodied, it transforms customs.\nTo be deluded by it is to lose the real and encounter illusion—illusion like waves in a coffer, sinking and floating, drowning and drifting, swept away by the great river’s current. To awaken to it is to shed the husk and nurture essence, spirit-light shining within, emptiness pure and flawless—clouds recede, the sky gleams; mist disperses, the sun shines. The radiance of the Great Clarity is revealed, the supreme real unveiled in leisure.\n\nPrimal virtue governs all; the Dao obstructs nothing.\nCommuning with spirits, the images shift;\nthe constellations align with their signs.\nIn serene and wondrous transformation,\none ascends the ladder of mystery to the Jade Dawn Palace.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe wondrous Dao knows no bounds,\nmerged with the primordial ridge.\n\nWaters surge into the cinnabar pool, billowing through the cloud chambers.\nDivine tones ring clear, celestial melodies resonant and bright.\nFlowing essence gleams like gold, soaring spirit radiates jade light.\nMystic yellow and auspicious mist, empty white and felicitous signs.\nSubstance bears yin, majestic gaze embraces yang.\nNine-hued radiance shimmers in the rosy clouds, the One Real blazes in splendor.\nA single star knots the dense canopy, the Jade Empyrean soars aloft.\n\n**Inscription on the Subtle Principles of the Supreme Clarity’s Mysterious Transformation**\nThe Great Dao emerges before the Supreme Ultimate,\nthe supreme virtue transforms at heaven and earth’s inception.\nVast and formless, sunk in silence without light.\nDim and indistinct, yet suddenly there is being.\nThis being is no ordinary being—it is called the utmost essence.\nThe utmost essence has no image;

They eradicate cravings and desires, casting aside the clamor of worldly dust. Through accumulated merit, they succor orphans and care for widows; through layered deeds, they cherish the aged and pity the poor. They look up to the virtuous without slackening, and lift the stubborn and indolent without arrogance. Harmony above and concord below—establishing virtue with compassion as its root. Inner rectitude and outward integrity—the Supreme Dao takes purity and stillness as its gate. When affairs are many, the heart finds no inner ease; when thoughts are severed, the mind does not wander outward. To halt excess and guard against loss, one must discern the moment for advance and retreat. Dwelling in peace, one contemplates peril, thereby distinguishing the principles of survival and ruin. Being and non-being mutually aid each other; movement and stillness share a single source. Stillness is called the Dao; movement is called the spirit. Silent yet responsive, moved yet without intent. Penetrating the primordial to replenish qi, fathoming the profound and luminous. Gathering the radiant yang soul in pure brilliance, transforming the yin po to reveal celestial truth. Stars congeal in mysterious illumination, the Dao releases its blossoming fragrance. Delving into the ultimate principle, one may die at dusk after hearing it at dawn. Thus, there is death yet no perishing—why envy Qi’s three sublime attainments? Not that there is no long life and enduring vision, but one does not scheme for Lin Lei’s century of years. Why not reflect: having form entails suffering, and one ultimately falls into the abyss of emptiness; only without appearance and form does one transcend beyond images. Diligently guard and cultivate merit—once merit is achieved and fame attained, shedding the mortal frame to ascend as an immortal is scarcely difficult.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Supreme Ultimate soars vast and distant,\nits abyssal depths profoundly mysterious.\nOne qi waxes and wanes,\nand the myriad things are born.\nA numinous breeze, elegant and fair,\na luminous moon, resplendent and bright.\nMountains conceal jade treasures,\ngrasses split to reveal golden ornaments.\nNourishing an entire realm,\nmoistening and fostering a hundred streams.\nWithout intent, all is wondrous;\nwith desire, one approaches the brink.\nDeluded, one becomes a ghost;\nawakened, one ascends as an immortal.\nEmerging from the boundless,\nits image precedes heaven.\n\n**Inscription on the Pure Heart of the Grand Abyss’ Celestial Boundary**\n\nThe Dao is silent yet unceasing,\nresponding and transforming without fixed form.\nVirtue is manifest yet not forceful,\nadapting to change with proper place.\nEstablishing images reveals the principles of sun, moon, heaven, and earth;\nstabilizing hexagrams embodies the mechanisms of yin-yang, closure, and openness.\nThe fullness within *Kan*:\nin heaven, it is the moon;\nin humans, it is the ear.\nThe ear can perceive the sounds of thunder, wind, and rain—\nthis is called hearing and knowing, the mark of sageliness.\nThe emptiness within *Li*:\nin heaven, it is the sun;\nin humans, it is the eye.\nThe eye can discern the beauty of mountains, marshes, and waters—\nthis is called seeing and knowing, the mark of spirit.\nLooking up, one models oneself on heaven;\nlooking down, one models oneself on earth.\nIn profound stillness, one observes images in transformation;\nthrough transformation, one fathoms the causes of darkness and light.\nTracing beginnings and returning to endings,\none thus understands the discourse on life and death.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Probe the obscure and seek the hidden,\nhook forth the deep and reach the distant.\"\nThe distant cannot be exhausted,\nthe near cannot be measured.\nVast and dim, none can know\nwhy it is so, yet so it is.\nTo diminish or expend it\ndoes not lose its essence.\nTo trust and uphold it\ndoes not reveal its form.\nHeaven endures, earth persists—\nwho can claim merit for high ascent?\nThose who uphold the Dao\nyet lack steadfast resolve,\nturning back midway—\nthis is what it means.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nEmbracing the divine splendor of the horizontal,\nemerald shadows on jade peaks.\n\nThe toad’s radiance emerges in restraint, the sun’s glow sinks in the west.\nThe Dao illumines the mysterious realm, virtue aligns with the celestial pivot.\nClouds bathe in snowy purity, primordial qi purifies the heart.\nDrought-spirits descend, all sages arrive in unison.\nGirded with gold, adorned with jade, treasured auspices fill their hairpins.\nLight trails like white feathers, tones arise from cold jasper.\nGently striking the jade chime, the clear sound is raised again.\n\n**Inscription of the Jade Dawn of Supreme Clarity:**\nThe Terrace of Supreme Clarity—nothing is born without transformation.\nThe Illuminated Sovereign of Images—no darkness remains unlit.\nThe Two Spirits enfold purity, resplendent before sun and moon.\nThe One Qi waxes and wanes, blending beyond heaven and earth.\nMystery upon mystery—tracing its traces is endless.\nWonder within wonder—profound thought cannot fathom it.\nHui Shi could debate, yet his words failed to capture its form.\nDuanmu could speak, yet his speech could not open its gate.\nLi Lou excelled in sight;

mechanism lies in the eye.\"\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"I do not know that the mechanism lies in the eye.\"\nWhat does this mean?\n\nThe Heavenly Perfected One of the Celestial Truth said: \"The Dao that is distant lies beyond the eight wilds, yet the Dao that is near lies between the brows and lashes. Vast, it encompasses heaven and earth; minute, it penetrates the finest hair. Guangchengzi said: 'The spirit’s mechanism moves within, the eyelashes fly like lead.' Thus, the spirit’s mechanism lies in the eye. When the eye’s spirit-light stirs, it resides in the eye. The secret mechanism of the nine heavens emerges from the mechanism before one’s eyes—this mechanism is the transformation of stirring movement. Summoning yang and calling forth yin, grasping the origin’s authority, emerging from clarity and entering the mysterious—thus, the two great corners of the eyes are called the brows. The green cavity ascends, connecting to the mud pill, descending to the two kidneys, which are the gates of mao and you. Kangcangzi said: 'My body harmonizes with the heart, the heart harmonizes with qi, qi harmonizes with spirit, spirit harmonizes with non-being.' There is the sound of *jieran*, the tone of *weiran*. Though distant beyond the eight wilds or near between the brows and lashes, whatever comes to me, I must know it. Yet this is not the awareness of my seven apertures and four limbs, nor the knowledge of my heart, abdomen, and six viscera—it is self-knowing alone.\"\n\nLiezi said: \"Spirit pertains to heaven’s portion, bones and frame to earth’s portion. What belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; what belongs to earth is turbid and gathers. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its truth—this is called *gui*. *Gui* means 'return,' returning to its true dwelling. The true dwelling is the realm of the Great Void.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what remains of me?\"\nThe Most High said: \"The Dao is empty yet employed, never filling. Profound, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. Blunting its sharpness, unraveling its tangles, harmonizing its light, merging with its dust. Vast and deep, it seems to abide—yet I know not whose child it is, as it appears before the Lord of Heaven.\"\n\nMaster Lü said: \"Gently warming the lead crucible, light penetrates the curtain.\"\nXu Shenweng’s commentary: \"The gentle warmth is the human body. At the initial union of the lead crucible, the spirit-light overflows—closing the eyes, one sees the curtain.\"\nThe eye is the eye itself.\nThus, the Master of Pointing to the Mysterious said: \"Concentrating spirit in the grotto palace, closing the eyes and lowering the curtain.\"\nThe workings of creation contend in haste—this speaks of humans employing spiritual merit to vie with creation, which is the spirit’s use by humans.\n\nMaster Haichan’s ode says:\nGently warming the lead crucible into the middle origin,\nreleasing the three lights to nurture auspicious lotuses.\nWhen the lotus naturally attains the method of sagehood,\nstep by step, the spirit-light is before the eyes.\n\nSong Qiqiu said: \"What the eye does not see, set up a bright mirror to reflect it; what the ear does not hear, set up empty qi to perceive it. Spirit is within me, seeing and hearing are yonder.\"\nHe also said: \"The bell in the ear, I myself hear it; the flower in the eye, I myself see it. My day and night are its day and night. Thus, day cannot be called bright, nor night called dark. Only the great person can equalize darkness and light.\"\nHe also said: \"Water, when utterly clear, congeals into ice that is not clear; spirit, when utterly bright, forms a body that is not bright. When ice melts, it returns to clarity; when form disperses, it returns to brightness. One who knows this death can roam the capital of the Most High.\"\n\nThe Fourth Scroll of *Supreme Clarity and Great Mystery Collection* Concludes\nThe Fifth Scroll of *Supreme Clarity and Great Mystery Collection*\nComposed by Gu Shehou Shanxuan\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains**\n\nAt Kunlun’s peak, the fire-dragon soars asunder,\nThe jeweled banquet’s celestial radiance illumines the Purple Tenuity.\nA single grain of numinous cinnabar fuses in splendor—\nOnly then does one know the Dao’s power wields divine might.\n\nThe Jasper Pool’s feast stirs strife, the sun yields its solitude,\nIts light shatters the dusty world—nothing remains.\nIn the vastness of silent emptiness, who is my companion?\nThe crystal curtain reflects the night-shining pearl.\n\nGolden brilliance, resplendent, auspicious clouds drift,\nLuminous and immaculate, flawless as jade.\nThe two spirits of purity and simplicity merge as one image—\nSuch is the wondrous skill of the Azure Micro immortal.\n\nA drop of crimson dew bathes the hibiscus,\nNourishing the numinous sprout to emerge anew.\nThe tender bud unfolds, smiling in the sun’s glow,\nPresenting you with a branch of spring in return.\n\nThe marvelous and the putrid are but empty names,\nIn this troubled world, floating and drifting, honor and disgrace startle.\nHow much better to shed the mortal coil and return to the unbegun,\nThan to be bound by the vulgar gaze that scorns the transcendent.\n\nThe three-foot dragon-spring sword rings in the night,\nSevering evil, slaying demons, it commands numinous efficacy.\nIts radiance untainted by the black serpent’s blood,\nIt soars to the Jasper Heavens, transformed into jade essence.\n\nThe two qi converge in the palace, guarding the true yang,\nYang’s light, jewel-bright, advances the mysterious frost.\nGiving birth to heaven, giving birth to earth, returning to the primal ancestor,\nAlone in the vastness, it mirrors the realm of the Celestial Emperor.\n\nIn the silent, empty hall, the door stands half-ajar,\nThe spirit-light meanders within, distinctly clear.\nThough the moon sinks into the Pool of Sun’s Mouth,\nA few stars still gleam in the wintry grove.\n\nA blazing sun rises through the sparse woods,\nIts luminous qi fills the eyes, joyfully explored.\nAwakening to the great completeness, the Dao is lucidly known,\nThe image of mystery takes flight to the azure heart of heaven.\n\nWithout, the armored dragon embraces the Water Palace,\nWithin, the metal tiger is driven into the Palace of Flame.\nRefined into a single substance, purely essence,\nIt follows the primordial wind of the Celestial Origin.\n\nSitting beyond the loom of fate, ten thousand cares forgotten,\nWithin, the heart settles, instantly cooled and clarified.\nYang congeals, substance solidifies, yin vanishes—\nUnawares, the spirit roams the Northern Emperor’s realm.\n\nThe resolute man’s will is firm and unyielding,\nReady to ascend as an immortal, he answers the celestial examination.\nHe grasps Mount Zou, shatters Kunlun’s peak,\nScattering the radiant mystery-pearl to merge with the Jade Yang.\n\nWith an empty heart, the mind at ease, he awakens to the subtle and serene,\nThere is yet a higher mechanism of the Mysterious Origin.\nRaindrops of the Valley Spirit fly to the Moon Palace,\nA sky of starry splendor moistens the lingzhi brows.\n\nLead and mercury in the golden crucible, auspicious clouds drift,\nRefined to perfection, it shines like a luminous sea-pearl.\nA single gleaming grain penetrates the dharma-realm,\nThe nine heavens’ light scatters into the pure void.\n\nThe blue dragon and white tiger mate in the crimson furnace,\nThe Mysterious Female and cinnabar phoenix freely inhale and exhale.\nFlaming brilliance of the samadhi fire,\nLucidly illuminating the old paths of darkness.\n\nThe two spirits merge in radiance at the center,\nEach drop, cool and clear, blends into the Jade Yang.\nThe mysterious image, resplendent, veils the Jasper Gate,\nThe Jade Tower’s deep chambers are locked within azure cloud-chambers.\n\nLeisurely riding a white deer to the Jasper Pool,\nAwaiting entry to the Moon Palace to pluck the cassia branch.\n\nThe Great Brahma, towering, is but an image,\nYet it shifts the stars’ radiance to moisten the lingzhi brows.\nThe Treasure-Essence Youth plucks the moonflower,\nFlames advance, the flying soul releases purple auroras.\n\nReversing the current beyond the Milky Way,\nNo need for misty waves to cradle the numinous elixir.\nThe virtuous elder’s demeanor is foolish,\nWithin, bloodless, his flesh becomes ice.\nSerenely awakened, he returns to the primal image,\nAscending to the Central Heaven to pay homage at the Purple Tenuity.\n\nBrahma-qi lightly drifts, merging with the Emperor’s origin,\nThe cinnabar’s light, resplendent, shines through the mystery.\nThe Jade Dawn requires no thatched-hut effort,\nInstantly, the empty hurricane grasps the plain sky.\n\nVast and boundless, the ten thousand images arise anew,\nThe Celestial Origin’s single qi blends with the pure void.\nThe Mysterious Yang’s universal sovereign contains the numinous essence,\nAll transforms without remainder into five-colored pearls.\n\nBlack mercury and red lead transmute into jade essence,\nMoistening the brows with golden splendor, illuminating the mysterious essence.\nIn the wintry grove, the sacred cassia and numinous cinnabar congeal,\nRough jade scatters, scattering auspicious stars.\n\nGrasping firmly, preserving the spirit, entering the wondrous mechanism,\nA man’s single-minded resolve never wavers.\nRefining the Celestial Crucible, the heart-pearl bursts forth,\nThe snow-capped youth treads the Jade Stream.\n\nBlack waters and crimson auroras illuminate the azure sky,\nThe blue dragon and white tiger enter the abyss of perception.\nThey swallow the sea-bottom’s numinous turtle marrow,\nAdvancing the armor-clad black pearl, round and gleaming.\n\nThe arrayed tripods’ souls wander, merging with the Great Azure,\nThe azure vault crackles, flames soaring.\nThe Three Origins are securely sealed, returning to the Qian image,\nThe vast secret, boundless, enters the great square.\n\nAuspicious qi and propitious clouds fill the eyes,\nA sky of true refinement transforms the cinnabar infant.\nThe numinous wind does not follow the willow floss away,\nIt flies into the Palace of Flame to accompany the morning star.\n\nEmerging from the Yang Pass, he travels the old road,\nListening freely, gazing in all directions.\nThe essence-jewel is not made to occupy mud and dust,\nIt pierces the long sky, a single point of clarity.\n\nThe primordial current of chaos, Brahma-qi ascends,\nThe sun of celestial wisdom shines most distinctly.\nIn stillness, a single mirror—by whose power?\nThe mysterious pearl descends, dazzling the Great Clarity.\n\nHeavenly wind and sea-sun radiate in splendor,\nAbove and below, molten gold scatters jewel-crystals.\nKnocking on the Dao, vast and luminous,\nShifting the spirit’s radiance, the eyes awaken.\n\nBrahma-qi circulates, blending the hundred rivers,\nA single glance from the majestic eyes ripples the numinous mist.\nPillowing on cloudy mountains, dreaming the Huaxu dream,\nNot desiring to slumber in the Chang’an marketplace.\n\nThe red sun half-embraces the emerald mountains,\nA wisp of azure mist lightly veils the water’s gleam.\nThe brocade-scaled fish are not hooked, returning empty-handed—\nWhat use is a thousand-foot silk line?\n\nBreaking through the sea-gate to seek the formless,\nPiercing the empty valley to retrieve the mysterious pearl.\nThe celestial court’s supreme treasure—who is worthy to receive it?\nI tell it to the great men of the world.\n\nA drunken man asks, “Forty springs have passed,”\nSuddenly awakened, he finds himself in a dream.\nForgetting form, there is naturally a path through the heavens,\nAscending to the Southern Palace, ranked among the jade stars.\n\nIn the silent, empty hall, the door stands half-closed,\nGreen peaches and red apricots emerge from the sparse fence.\nBeyond the southern window, a pillow in the spring breeze—\nNot like Zhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream.\n\nThe mist at the granary’s corner disperses, the red sun gleams,\nThe mist at the river’s edge clears, the azure sky shines.\nThe carefree scholar, his heart unburdened,\nThe snow-capped transcendent, his eyes bright.\n\nLast night, sitting alone as the night deepened,\nGuarding the inner elixir furnace, the four limbs at ease.\nNo wonder the sparse shadows beyond the curtain are white—\nThe moonflower visits, illuminating the jade.\n\nThe Qian Origin and Great Simplicity wondrously embrace the vast,\nRefining the substance, flowing gold, purple qi arises.\nAt home, the auspicious youth smiles in the sun’s glow,\nFor whom does the sky’s scenery shine?\n\nThe vermilion gate opens to wondrous revelation, the azure grotto unfolds—\nFive numinous immortals roam at will.\nDragon smoke coils into a thousand poems,\nAmber cups brim with a hundred draughts.\n\nIn fleeting trance, the soul wanders the Great One’s abode,\nClouds and mist swirl like flying dragons and serpents.\nSince the descent of celestial omens, who in the world has known?\nTen thousand drops of flowing essence merge with the splendor of things.\n\nFar reaching to the Jasper Heavens, yet near as one’s brows,\nThe image bears celestial substance, wondrously pure and subtle.\nOnce I traced the traces back to the Primordial Ancestor,\nThe vast Brahman void transformed into jade and rainbow.\n\nThough the body withers and the heart turns to ash, the will remains steadfast,\nEmbracing the spirit, guarding the One, one attains distant years.\nLongevity need not mean lingering in the world—\nBeyond lies a realm of gourd-bound sun and moon.\n\nHow can an earthen cauldron boil the golden elixir to froth?\nThe bottomless stone pool blends the ceaseless flow.\nHeaven-shaking waves surge past Ox and Dipper,\nAlone I steer a single-leaf skiff through the void.\n\nThe deluded, benighted child curls inward,\nYet the sea’s eye gazes outward, bright and clear.\nWandering the cinnabar heavens, the essence glistens,\nAzure pupils faintly perceive the pale light’s chill.\n\nSleeping at night and stirring at dawn, both states forgotten,\nGradually the harmonious qi rises above and below.\nThe horn of dawn half-contains the gleaming red sun,\nA range of brow-like mountains clears the azure sky.\n\nLast night at the third watch, the moonlight was fresh,\nThe old path to the Jade Empyrean remained unchanged.\nOpening wide my gaze across a thousand miles,\nAll phenomena arise from the single round mirror.\n\nAuspicious cinnabar light scatters, illuminating the azure void,\nLead’s radiance, speck by speck, moistens the lingzhi brows.\nThe numinous youth, inclined toward the Yang abode,\nYet follows the phoenix carriage to the phoenix tower in flight.\n\nBinding mercury, congealing lead, refining jade and rainbow,\nThe flesh transforms, bloodless, the countenance star-like.\nWith a single transcendent leap, ascending to heaven,\nThe imperial throne relies on the true wind and the Dao’s mighty power.\n\nAll gloom before the eyes transforms into Yang,\nWithin the cinnabar tripod, lead frost emerges.\nThe black serpent inverts to drink the blue dragon’s blood,\nThe image, formless, spits forth light in the night.\n\nFrom time immemorial, all has been guest dust—\nWhat thing constitutes the celestial truth?\nDisciples toil in vain with their visits,\nSeeking to see the present, yet failing to see the man.\n\nWaves rise on Kun Mountain, stirring the Jasper Pool,\nBlowing open jade flowers that scatter everywhere.\nThe vast void shimmers with auspicious hues,\nEssence flows forth, dispersing through the Nine Purities.\n\nEarthly po, heavenly po, sun and moon essence,\nTrue Yang blazes resplendently bright.\nWithin the swirling divine wind, the Three Qi return,\nThrice reborn, a single star revives.\n\nTo refine and preserve, first master the six emotions,\nWith a start, guard simplicity—thus the Dao is born.\nWho knows the flavor of Feather Mountain’s wind?\nClouds depart, heartless, yet the moon shines clear.\n\nThe Three Origins’ divine radiance, qi unbroken,\nFive-colored jasper blossoms illuminate the Nine Heavens.\nHeavenly omens merge into the True One’s image,\nThe mysterious image soars into the Great Clarity’s abyss.\n\nThe fiery furnace blazes, flames soaring,\nThe seething tripod surges with jade nectar.\nThe elixir’s fortune fills the eyes with splendor,\nMyriad spirits harmonize, naturally pure and cool.\n\nNorth’s darkness and South’s cinnabar each have their time,\nThe two spirits swiftly grasp heaven’s mechanism.\nTogether they devise to repay the chaos of death,\nSevenfold return, perfect communion, transcending old hearsay.\n\nThick mists and demonic vapors pierce the gall with chill,\nIn the dark, the black egg emerges from the mud pill.\nA divine wind sweeps through the celestial strife,\nThe shadow-bearing light leaves no bloodstains.\n\nThe grotto’s true radiance merges with the pure void,\nThe resplendent golden elixir shines through the nine thoroughfares.\nHaving united the fetal spirit into one body,\nWithin it contains the numinous essence, birthing the mysterious pearl.\n\nLayer upon layer of thin mist clears the cinnabar empyrean,\nThe cinnabar empyrean’s path is not distant.\nWhere earth meets heaven amid fragrant grasses,\nA divine wind returns, transforming jade and lingzhi sprouts.\n\nThe stainless pure void, daily renewed,\nIlluminates the heavenly summit, startling the soul.\nSuddenly, unawares, form is forgotten,\nFar off, striking the numinous Yang, passing the sea gate.\n\nThe Dao’s mystery is mystery upon mystery,\nMysteriously pervading, touching the realm before birth.\nThe cinnabar phoenix blows through the shooting-star eyes,\nFlying into the Flourishing Yang and Great Unity’s heaven.\n\nA wisp of rosy mist pierces the purple haze,\nYu’s remnant wind stills, grasses lush.\nThe sun’s soul foresees the numinous splendor,\nBreaking through the cinnabar mound to reveal the sky.\n\nLeaning on a pine, I ascend to gaze at Jade Flower Peak,\nTowering, tier upon tier, hundreds of folds.\nMoon’s po and sun’s hun inquire of each other,\nBetween them, above and below, the youthful countenance.\n\nThe toad’s radiance, bright and clear, pours into the Silver River,\nIlluminating the cosmos with its vast, luminous qi.\nRefining the po, enhancing the po, clarifying the Great Simplicity,\nTransforming into immortals who ascend heaven’s net.\n\nNorthward, the misty waters dark and deep,\nPouring into the fiery palace of the Red Emperor’s realm.\nThus the waves calm, the dragon sleeps soundly,\nBlack lead wholly transforms into purple gold frost.\n\nThe dragon’s abyss in the watery realm reflects the sea pearl,\nIn the night’s darkness, the world’s mirror gleams like jade lard.\nThe carefree immortal’s twin pupils shine,\nJust as the moon goddess ascends the Azure Capital.\n\nPhoenix marrow and dragon fat perfume the land,\nBrilliantly congealing, illuminating the encircling eyes.\nBeyond the clear pupils, the spirit’s hues divide,\nA single golden elixir shines in the Great Clarity.\n\nWithin the profound, deeper mysteries lie,\nBeyond the heavens, more heavens arise.\nGazing upward, ever more distant, boundless,\nUnawares, the soul flies beyond the Image Lord.\n\nSilent and dim, the Dao incomplete,\nSplitting open the chaos to reveal the double mystery.\nNaturally mastering the Nine and Five, concealing all functions,\nThe soul soars, distant, through the eighteen heavens.\n\nThe Dao of nature is originally formless,\nClinging to this formlessness is but a borrowed name.\nRecognize the single wheel of crystal sun,\nThrough the mysterious, one begins to perceive the Great Void’s clarity.\n\nThe Great Mystery’s vast grotto conceals the numinous treasure,\nThe Supreme’s emptiness hides the inner truth.\nTo know what the original truth is—\nNot spirit, yet spirit, therefore spirit.\n\nI originally idly chant poems of heaven,\nDo not confuse them with inferior methods in wild guesses.\nTo you, I point directly to the path of cultivating truth—\nThe Dao connects to the numinous pupils, near as your brows.\n\nParting the cold mist to reveal the azure vault,\nThe sea’s moon clears the sky, all phenomena interpenetrate.\nStanding alone in the vast, who is my match?\nThe cinnabar infant wanders, borne by the heavenly wind.\n\nThe divine wind, ceaseless, breaks through the cloud blossoms,\nWashing the frosty heavens, the atmosphere pure.\nOnly then does the jade peak’s solitary moon gleam,\nPiercing the mysterious tripod, suddenly awakening.\n\nIn former years, benighted, the heart’s source was closed,\nToday, the Dao’s eye opens, clear and bright.\nDelighted to see the azure sky like a jade table,\nThe twin millstones grind through the white cloud banks.\n\nTurning the mysterious pass, the qi’s aspect returns,\nThe numinous crow flies past, the azure heavens open.\n\nA single truth suddenly illumines both eyes bright,\nRecognize the morning sun’s precious mirror-platform.\nOne millstone refines the sun’s light through the cosmos,\nTwo points of primordial essence radiate the valley spirit.\n\nThe precious mirror enhances the numinous, Heavenly Water flourishes,\nJade blossoms bloom across the Jade Capital’s spring.\nThe Jade Clarity, Primordial Beginning, Great Lofty Heaven—\nIts majestic qi emerges before the Emperor’s advent.\n\nWithin the Purple Tenuity’s golden gates it unfolds,\nThe cinnabar infant wanders, countenance resplendent.\nThe sun-essence youth appears luminous,\nFeathered canopy and jade blossoms veil the purple mist.\n\nThereby attaining the mysterious yang to open the precious mirror,\nThe jade star flies into the Grand Clarity’s abyss.\nTwin blades of frost-edged swords gleam on Mount Taihua,\nCleaving the heavens’ crown to admit dragon-sand.\n\nTen thousand points of cinnabar yang, pure and refined,\nAll belong to the Primordial Lord’s Purple Mansion.\nVast qi and harmonizing wind penetrate the azure window,\nSuddenly worldly traces merge with true yang.\n\nIn profound unity, all scheming ceases,\nResponsibility and mutual radiance dispel ghosts of themselves.\nGolden splendor clear, jade blossoms fly,\nCinnabar flowers flourish, purple clouds return.\n\nTwin lads gather herbs beyond the cold stream,\nWhether attained or not—who can know?\nDivine work has its method to refine the elixir knife,\nThe lead crucible gently warmed by subtle fire.\n\nNo need for breath or forceful effort,\nThe flame furnace naturally bears snowflake blossoms.\nWashing away worldly dust, ten thousand cares settle,\nShifting spirit into the sea to transform the cinnabar infant.\n\nThe Hua-Yuan immortal calls out in greeting,\nLaughing, pointing toward the jade capital deep in clouds.\nTwin phoenixes welcome the immortal into emerald haze,\nPurple mist softly rises, illuminating crimson robes.\n\nWhere jade towers stir fragrant winds,\nGolden flowers are blown aloft in flight.\nShifting spirit, stepping alone into the pure void,\nLuminous purity of the void leaves no speck of dust.\n\nExchanging the drill for the agate casket, essence refines day by day,\nPiercing the heart’s crucible to illumine the ice-pot.\nWithin, the true nature is clear; without, the mysterious is communicated,\nOnly when the mysterious illuminates the yang pass does the Dao begin.\n\nInner and outer awaken, jade-like clarity resplendent,\nIntertwined radiance flies upward to Jade Capital Mountain.\nPenetrating insight reveals the numinous jade, phenomena dissolve,\nThe primordial chaos directly flourishes, seizing the heavenly wind.\n\nA single stream from Kunlun’s western waters\nPours into the icy abyss ten thousand fathoms deep.\nReleasing a single point of primordial chaos’ essence,\nIt aids the dark yin and yang, illuminating the unseen.\n\nWere it not the jade infant wandering the Purple Mansion,\nHow could the numinous palace encounter the Three Stars?\nCleaving open chaos to reveal dragon-light,\nEntering and exiting vermilion gates to receive cassia frost.\n\nThereby attaining the five spirits to clarify the Grand Simplicity,\nA single grain of golden elixir seizes heaven’s constancy.\nThe cinnabar phoenix toils, descending cassia branches,\nThe Jade Pool’s waters are sipped all day.\n\nReleased from the dual gates’ intent,\nA single transformation of the mysterious pearl ascends the Great Lofty.\nNuminous sound emerges from the distant and obscure,\nA waft of fragrant wind enters the dream, clear.\n\nExpounding the twin gates to connect the ancient Dao,\nIn the Jade Empyrean, one meets the Lesser Micro Star.\nScreening away worldly dust, ten thousand affairs vanish,\nOnly in nothingness is the primordial chaos pearl seen.\n\nWhere does the vanished form, altered image return?\nSoftly, following the wind, it ascends the Jade Capital.\nGazing upward, the mysterious is revealed in the azure realm,\nFlowing bells cast fire into the center.\n\nA single point of cavernous origin, the heavenly wind flourishes,\nBenefiting my three yin to transform into nine yang.\nCultivation requires exerting deadly effort,\nExchanging substance to retain the true, embodying the Great Nothingness.\n\nThe waning soul benefits the spirit in the golden banquet hall,\nThe cavernous mysterious returns to illumine the Jade Clarity Capital.\nJasper plum blossoms first unfurl with the east wind,\nDrifting ethereally, connecting every place in the human realm.\n\nLike the moon goddess departing her precious palace,\nJust as the immortal enters the dragon palace.\nWho has seen the Jade Pool’s jade-spring rinse,\nWhere ringing chimes startle the soul, first shocking heaven?\n\nThe yang soul pursues the flowing bell-fire to its end,\nAt night, the Lesser Micro Star awakens the plain mysterious.\nNot desiring to scheme in the world of dust,\nThe carefree crane-nature recalls its eastern journey.\n\nAt the Dao’s gate, one realizes few know the tune,\nOnly the numinous Kunlun remains as before.\nStrolling by chance to the Southern Palace to visit the Emperor’s return,\nSword-light flies past, shattering the precious mountain.\n\nAlas for the countless eyes of mortals,\nWho do not recognize Penglai’s board or Yuan’s go-between.\nHeaven’s concealment, the true wind’s brilliance,\nWithin, it enfolds dragon-light, flying over the sea.\n\nThe golden cavern’s beauty, triple-layered mist,\nThe jade spirit’s grace, the twofold patterns’ harmony.\nA single wheel of bright moon illumines the pure subtle,\nThe water realm’s divine forest reflects the jade stream.\n\nBracing air pierces the bones with crystalline clarity,\nThe Milky Way still bathes its icy flesh.\nIn the zhi-hall, feathered guests discuss the true mechanism,\nDirectly pointing to the jade heavens, the path unobscured.\n\nClear eyes unclouded by veiling mists,\nIn the Jade Empyrean’s banquet, one’s countenance shines like a star.\nSun and moon revolve, heaven and earth gleam,\nDivine light intertwines, the Great Void brightens.\n\nThose who attain this observe its wonders,\nEasily meeting the heavenly wind to fill the realm with purity.\nTransforming customs, shifting winds to emerge from worldly passions,\nA single point of cool constancy, profoundly clear.\n\nContaining light, silently merging with heaven’s substance,\nOnly then does one trust the divine work, the Dao’s awakening.\nCleaving open chaos to reveal the golden crow’s nest,\nStriking through Kunlun’s ridge to the jade hare’s gate.\n\nNo need for twin pupils to illumine the dharma-realm,\nThus a single eye suffices to illumine heaven and earth.\nThe Grand Mystery pure, moon blossoms fly,\nThe Limitless radiant, moon essence returns.\n\nOrchids and zhi flourish by the jade stream,\nWho knows the divine work’s gathering?\nDivine skill is reaped—who can know?\n\n**Five-Character Verse**\n\nShattering Kunlun’s

the *Daode* chapter.\nAwakening to this true and wondrous principle,\nWhat worry of not attaining immortality?\n\n**Presented to Enlightened One Yang Qing**\nThe superior practitioner abandons glory and splendor,\nCarefree, entering the grotto’s mist.\nLead simmers the pot’s snow,\nMercury refines the crucible’s sand.\nThe medicine complete, the complexion flourishes,\nThe elixir formed, the color transforms further.\nPrimary and secondary divide into five hues,\nThe utmost principle, wondrous and without flaw.\n\n**Presented to Serene One Xu Ji**\nThe superior practitioner abandons stubborn rigidity,\nCarefree, entering the grotto’s chamber.\nHeaven’s emptiness suspends the wondrous body,\nThe heart’s ground merges with true yang.\nThe old woman sleeps in the toad’s shadow,\nThe infant embraces the sun’s light.\nThe original spirit knows there is a master,\nThrough myriad ages, attaining pure clarity.\n\n*Shangqing Taixuan Ji*, Scroll Five, Complete\n*Shangqing Taixuan Ji*, Scroll Six\n\n**Seven-Character Quatrains by Marquis Gu She Shanyuan, Sixty Poems**\n\nHow wondrous—this heart at ease in the great school,\nNot drifting midstream but reaching distant shores.\nDrunk, I fell from the cart for white wine’s sake;\nSober, I grasp my sandals for pure tea’s grace.\n\nPrimal essence surges forth, piercing heaven’s flight,\nWandering winds yield to the Two Modes’ might.\nThus I shed my form to return to the unbegun,\nWhere the Azure Lad invites me to the Elixir Pool.\n\nWhy in youth did I leave my home?\nPondering deeply, I sigh with woe.\nHad not the Image-Mystery flowed into the crucible,\nI’d still be driving the salt cart to this day.\n\nDragon’s drool and phoenix candles trace fragrant smoke,\nEyes illumine sparse woods, vast qi serene.\nA gust of cold wind startles the crane’s dream—\nOn the star altar, the *Step-of-Void* chant rings.\n\nThe secluded pass’s fading light dissolves form,\nDual luminaries merge their glow in one bright realm.\nSelf and things both forgotten, the whole body appears,\nFused into a single point of Great Void’s essence.\n\nBrows unfurled like wings, the sky’s vastness gleams,\nThe radiant sun and numinous wind illumine the Grand Clarity.\nTransforming the body leaves no room for wind-fire’s nature—\nI know my true self belongs to the Lesser Weave Star.\n\nA furnace of gold and fire emits lead’s splendor,\nDazzling heaven and earth with emerald haze.\nGuarding within, no thieving yin-ghosts intrude—\nNaturally, the sacred crucible congeals numinous sand.\n\nNurturing one furnace of red phoenix marrow,\nRefining two crucibles of crimson dragon essence,\nI open the cosmos-wide Heavenly Eye—\nAt chaos’ first division, my vision grows clear.\n\nLate at night, sitting alone as autumn’s moon hangs,\nAuspicious qi lightly floats through twelve cycles.\nLonging to return to Divine Empyrean’s old path,\nThe ancient fork gleams where azure haze gathers.\n\nThe soaring kite outshines cloud-ladders,\nCarved wood’s craft plays with cunning mechanisms.\nTo be useful or not—one must suit oneself;\nIn the forest, I cast aside the sling and wander home.\n\nShaking off the dust’s bonds, I part ways,\nMy brother’s resolve stands firm, unchanging.\nThough water and clouds veil us three thousand leagues apart,\nI vow not to return unless I become an immortal.\n\nGazing up and down through a hundred thousand fathoms,\nMy drunken soul flies into the azure sky’s heart.\nA youth guides me to Jade Pool’s mouth—\nThe toad’s radiance is refined into pure gold.\n\nThis illusory body long concealed in deep illness,\nExchanging form and light to illumine the jeweled peak.\nLayers of jade-green shadows float on rushing mist,\nA fire-dragon emerges from the azure pool’s depths.\n\nIn a blink, brows raised, the sun of wisdom dawns,\nA river of landscapes unfolds before my eyes.\nJingshan’s peaks split open to reveal the spirit-treasure—\nA flawless heap of jade gleams forth.\n\nMy heart dwells beyond things, serene and free,\nA single lotus leaf floats on the azure sea.\nThe lotus blooms, its flower born of the sun’s smile,\nDrifting with the wind to Jade Capital’s sky.\n\nStanding tall in the empyrean, I survey the world’s splendor,\nOn Jade Pool’s twin shores, golden flowers bloom.\nMy drunken soul roams beyond the mundane,\nAwakening into the Mysterious Metropolis, the Lord of Images’ abode.\n\nThe Mysterious Origin and Great One embrace vast mystery,\nWithin the misty haze, all sights arise.\nOnly when the two spirits merge with the twin luminaries\nDoes yin’s numen transform into a single celestial star.\n\nGazing into the grotto’s waves of deep green,\nA sea-dragon plays with the night’s radiance.\nLight blazes from the Great Nonbeing’s vast solar horn—\nMyriad spirits converge to bear witness to the True Yang.\n\nAuspicious clouds densely blanket river and sky,\nPhoenix plumes and rainbows pierce the sun’s corner.\nNo wonder fragrant winds fill the hall—\nIn the jade palace, the jasper trees’ flowers vie in bloom.\n\nThe pearl-playing dragon emerges as the sea-gate opens,\nPurple mist soars through the ninefold heavens.\nBreaching the Bitter Pool to swallow sun and moon,\nThe immortals of the ten directions all turn in awe.\n\nRolling up the pearl curtain to gaze outward,\nPine winds and radiant sun penetrate the jade grove.\nSeven treasures gather in the tortoiseshell abode—\nA dazzling cluster of silver haze and jade.\n\nRoaming and soaring through golden clarity, merged with the Great Void,\nBrow Mountain’s moon-valley floats with auspicious clouds.\nWithout mastering this art, what can one achieve?\nIn vain does one stand tall in the empyrean as a man.\n\nBefore the jade mountain, myriad trees bloom,\nNaturally claiming a fine livelihood.\nThe immortal lad smiles at the western guest—\nRecently, the High Yang wine-tasting household.\n\nReturning again to Divine Empyrean’s old path,\nI wander at ease within the Jade Clarity Palace.\nThe starry river gleams, unknown to all—\nTwo blossoms of jasper bloom in one place.\n\nClearing the wild to plant jade *zhi* sprouts,\nI break open Jade Pool to irrigate them anew.\nDao-qi circulates, surging through the azure sea,\nNuminous winds pervade the clear empyrean.\n\nSun’s essence and moon’s marrow are refined without loss,\nEarth’s po and heaven’s hun are tempered without flaw.\nExchanging substance while retaining truth, I endure in the world,\nAmid ninefold radiance, I roam at will.\n\nMisty Jiang’s haze scatters, the vast sky clears—\nAlone, I face the Crimson Yang’s flying snowflakes.\nGolden and jade light streams, illumining the Grand Clarity,\nIn the cold forest, jasper flowers naturally form.\n\nThe world’s net and dust’s passions—already left behind,\nThe Mysterious Gate’s true secret—what doubt remains?\nIf a man harbors the will to soar to heaven,\nWhy wait to become an immortal?\n\nClinging to illusion, why question the illusory mechanism?\nAwakening to the mechanism still leads one astray.\nI sigh for the cloud-water wanderer of the east—\nIn vain he journeyed to Jing Mountain, returning empty-handed.\n\nThe hundred-legged *kui* and serpent pass pity in turn,\nWandering winds and spirit transformations—all in vain.\nOne must first seek the precelestial ancestor—\nOnly then can one enter my school’s foremost mystery.\n\nLast night at the third watch, the moon shone bright,\nGentle winds and dew dripped in clear spheres.\nWho sang that resonant melody?\nI suspect it was a jade-inebriated immortal from the jasper palace.\n\nAlone I come and go on Zhongnan’s slopes by the Wei,\nSeeking the worthies, I pass through Tong Pass.\nMarket scholars and rustic elders pay no heed—\nThrough rain and clouds, I return to my old mountain.\n\nBriefly leaving the immortal isle for the human realm,\nThe bitter sea’s waves make salvation arduous.\nBraving snow and wind, I return to my old retreat—\nIn the night’s chill, I cross Tong Pass with sword in hand.\n\nNine years’ work accomplished, the effect is subtle,\nReturning home, I contain the jade mechanism’s secret.\nLong have I sighed for the empyrean—\nYet in the forest, I am again bound like a tree stump.\n\nClinging to illusion, Master Wen questions the illusory mechanism,\nFurther inquiring of Master Yang—only to deepen the maze.\nHow many gains and losses does the deer discern?\nDrunk, I ride the cart, my limbs undone.\n\nWords and wit contend with Hui Ang,\nYet I regret having no master to meet Liang Yang.\nAbandoning home and neglecting work to indulge desires—\nThorns await the moment to test Ji Chang.\n\nThe wise of this world mock those who leave home,\nKnowing their spirit’s vastness has no bounds.\nSeeking the fire-mirror, three cups of wine—\nTheir savor surpasses Lu Tong’s seven bowls of tea.\n\nThe rut-bound fish long trapped, awaiting the western river,\nFor my esteemed guest, I speak of Master Yang.\n\nAll say, \"Having gained the pearl, why need the Dao?\"\nFortunate to meet Master Dongguo, I pour out my heart.\n\nTen thousand layered emerald peaks lean against the azure haze,\nA river of jade-green waters joins the river’s edge.\nWhere now the sword bestowed in years past?\nTo whom today is the hidden light entrusted?\n\nAuspicious radiance stirs the celestial glow, illuminating the Great Clarity,\nThe vermilion court bears the fiery essence of tiger and dragon.\nRefined into a treasure-mirror, luminous as the heavens,\nTwo divine beams converge in one bright place.\n\nFacing the wind, we chant and harmonize a thousand poems,\nBeneath the moon, cups brim with a hundred measures of wine.\nAt ease upon ancient Kunlun, self and other forgotten,\nThe drunken soul soars into the Palace of Broad Cold.\n\nThe ancient Dao was originally divided from the Primordial Beginning,\nVast and boundless, the Three Realms merge as one.\nThe whale and roc emerge from the sea, their traces stretching far,\nFlying to the Jasper Pool in the sixth summer month.\n\nI regret having pursued rare skills and vain pursuits,\nFor rank and wealth, glory and gate—how hard to attain!\nJust now I saw the lord boast of his strength,\nFashioning a single leaf for you to see.\n\nThe shallow filth of the salamander and loach becomes their foundation,\nYet to restrain the weak and bind the sturgeon is not fitting.\nIf only the heavenly wind would lift my wings,\nI would ride the whirlwind to the Jasper Pool.\n\nThe fiery wheel grinds through the azure beryl,\nTwo golden beams advance in radiant flight.\nThus the image of the Mysterious flows into the crucible,\nNaturally roaming and soaring through the Ninefold Clarity.\n\nWho pities the rut-bound fish, trapped on the road?\nThose who flow with the current mock the sickly flesh.\nThe misty waves of the Northern Sea must part in the end—\nUnfurl your wings, chart the southern course, cross the Five Lakes.\n\nWho has seen the divine being, so ethereal in form,\nDrinking wind, sipping dew, her skin like snow?\nFor a moment she leaves the misty caves of Guye,\nSteadily riding the flying dragon to the Jade Capital.\n\nWhat matter of the Primordial Origin is most profound?\nThe towering treasure-dharma crowns all past and present.\nHaving gained the jade grove’s soaring white feathers,\nA single crimson sun illumines the heart of heaven.\n\nAt ease with Mei and Zhang, I chant extemporaneously,\nThe two masters’ wisdom deepens our bond.\nLike wind and moon, clear through all ages,\nThey illuminate the heart of heaven, ten thousand fathoms deep.\n\nStriking the void, striking things—ghosts and spirits startle,\nLeaning into each step, borrowing lightness with ease.\nWhen I ascend the Jade Empyrean to the realm of Jia,\nI shall transform you then, carrying you to take dragon form.\n\nA crucible of golden fire blazes in the celestial thoroughfare,\nRevealing the flawless pearl that illumines the sea.\nEnveloped and suddenly clarified, congealing into jade,\nRefined into an immortal—wondrous skill!\n\nJade springs well forth, flowing into golden wells,\nIn an instant, the southern cinnabar and northern sea achieve merit.\nSplitting the Mysterious Pearl to release radiant clouds,\nThe Mysterious Pearl soars to Kunlun’s summit.\n\nPerfect clarity—ten thousand dharmas exist within the void,\nA single stream of cinnabar surges through the gate of wisdom.\nGazing upon the jade grove’s clustered blossoms,\nTwo geese tilt the celestial flask, pouring wine from the Gourd Heaven.\n\nThe Primordial Great Man’s wind tears asunder,\nHis brows like the jade toad swallowing the moon over the sea.\nThe treasure-feast’s celestial light illumines the Five Tombs,\nCinnabar essence scatters, yellow blossoms form.\n\nStaff in hand, I wander to visit the misty vines,\nYet how many desolate paths and wayward inns lie in wait!\nNo need for the two concubines to know beauty or ugliness—\nAlas, I lack the grace to emulate Han E.\n\nThree-colored mists swirl, striking the Crimson Palace,\nVermilion gates half-conceal the true countenance.\nThe ice-grinding wheel shatters the path of the Mysterious Ridge,\nTransforming all under heaven with the wind of primordial antiquity.\n\nTo move things, to pluck flowers—all is emptiness,\nWhere in human relations does one apply effort?\nThe Tathāgata once spoke of awe-inspiring spiritual power—\nI ask the Chan stream: have you grasped it?\n\nAscending the upper story, the eye’s realm brightens,\nI seem to doubt my body has reached Huaqing.\nNo need for cloud-borne chariots in the central heavens—\nI fly into the fiery palace to accompany the morning star.\n\nGazing all day at the golden crow in the empyrean,\nThe Vermilion Mound’s fiery domain refines the jade crucible.\nThe treasure-dharma dissolves form, transcending the material,\nThe Nine Spirits’ immortals ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe numinous gaze, tempered, enters the vermilion court,\nYellow qi surges, sweeping away impure forms.\nLooking up and down, the cavernous void is fully responsive,\nThe lush radiance of the Empyrean illumines Huaqing.\n\n**Seven-character full verse**\nIn the Hall of Fungi, verdant hues speak of the Mysterious Subtle,\nDirectly pointing to the alchemical canon, revealing the jade mechanism.\nThe ocean’s depths churn with red agate,\nThe mountain’s heights shatter azure beryl.\n\nThe jade hare of the Moon Palace roams the mossy path,\nThe golden crow of the Sun Palace rests on the cassia branch.\nTwo segments of light return to one place—\nThe Peerless Noble ascends to the Jasper Pool.\n\nIn years past, I wandered and lost my way, not returning home,\nToday, turning my gaze, I return to the emerald clouds.\nGolden fire overflows the crucible in five hues,\nCinnabar fills the tripod, emitting triple radiance.\n\nBy the river, I seize and break the Black Dragon’s tail,\nOn the ridge, I strike open the White Tiger’s teeth.\nThe cave-mirror of Fivefold Clarity penetrates the Great Existence—\nThen I ride the crane-chariot, driving the cloud-carriage.\n\nIn the cavern-chamber, the night is desolate,\nThe ape and horse are captured to accompany solitude.\nThe jade hare pursues the toad at the corner of the heavens,\nThe golden crow embraces the sun, circling the sky’s waist.\n\nThe dragon coils around the medicine tripod, the Three Flowers gather,\nThe tiger retreats from the elixir furnace, the Five Qi pay homage.\nRefining the numinous cinnabar to dwell beyond form,\nThe Jade Capital’s immortal precincts are not far.\n\nBy chance I traverse the long abyss, dwelling temporarily,\nLike one waiting for a hare by an empty stump.\nUnmet by Bo Le, I ride a salt-laden horse,\nLike encountering Zhuangzi’s rut-bound fish.\n\nHow could I heed the vain search of years past?\nOnly now do I know the attainment of the Mysterious Pearl.\nIn Longxi, we meet again by chance—\nI write these heartfelt words to send to you.\n\nWhy does Zhan He reel in his fishing line?\nThe □ carp leaps the waves, snapping the hook.\nDelighted to escape the shallow stream, leaving the sea of suffering,\nFortunate to meet the long waters and find ease.\n\nContent to dwell in a thatched hut, welcoming the mountain elder,\nForgetting to visit the vermilion gates of noble lords.\nWho will see me home, drunk from the village feast?\nA shepherd boy supports me, riding backward on an ox.\n\nAlas, I wander within and without, knowing no path,\nMistakenly entering the cloudy mountains to strike and stay.\nThe lost Mysterious Pearl must be sought in concealment,\nThe moon of the mind, once stilled, requires no search.\n\nA single strand of blue mist descends from the heavens,\nTwo trails of red rainbow roll across the earth.\nHaving reached the Fiery Palace, mother and child part,\nSideways, the Seven Luminaries circulate through the great expanse.\n\nI send word to the pine-shaped, crane-haired elder:\nSearch well for the Mysterious Subtle, leap from the mortal cage.\nThe Three Passes’ qi surges, white as the heavens,\nA single golden elixir shoots red into the crucible.\n\nMercury congeals in the Jade Yang, leaving the Water Palace,\nLead solidifies into golden qi, entering the Fiery Palace.\nThe flowing pearl ascends Kunlun’s summit—\nI behold the vast winds of the Jasper Pool.\n\nTo imitate others is not merely to betray kindness,\nConcealing evil, obscuring the upright, dimming heaven’s truth.\nRelying on spirits, clinging to the Dao for livelihood,\nClasping a child, nestling with a wife, expounding the teachings—\n\nSuch is not the way.\n\nThe discerning masses despise the lofty adept,\nThe ignorant demons slander the enlightened one.\nSay not that heaven and earth lack judgment—\nFar in descendants, near in one’s own person.\n\n**Five-character full poem**\n\nJoy and sorrow stem from a lost horse,\nA blemished eye from birthing an ox.\nThe deer was shared by Duke Xun’s minister,\nThe butterfly dream awakened Zhuang Zhou.\nGu Ye returned through spiritual transformation,\nHu Qiu resumed his outer wanderings.\nDongmen became my companion,\nNanguo too my fellow.\nIn youth, my nature inclined toward the sacred,\nIn middle age, my appearance grew dull as folly.\nThe gull startled, forgetting its true form,\nThe dog barked at the exchange of black robes.\nWhy question the two concubines?\nThe Three Spirits have their own appointed time.\nJi Jian failed in physiognomy,\nWen Zhi excelled in healing arts.\nWho wields the illusions of the owl and rooster?\nThe ring dance charts its own discord.\nSharp as a mountain-consuming fire,\nProud as a cup set upon the elbow.\nA gentleman’s vessel bears no burden,\nYet displays the talent of a petty man.\nRecent conduct differs not from wisdom,\nVainly laboring on a thousand-foot terrace.\nWhy should such as these cross the threshold?\nA master craftsman measures before cutting.\nEasy to maintain a pure and disciplined mind,\nHard to sustain a daily fast.\nThe crucible boils root-bound greens,\nThe furnace burns leaf-laden firewood.\nI marvel at the fish trapped in the wheel rut—\nA ladle of water brings no disaster.\nDisciples’ affections run shallow,\nThe Daoist abbey grows desolate.\nWild herbs remain year-round,\nHousehold grain nears exhaustion.\nMy heart has already consented—\nWhat say you, sir?\nLiezi journeyed through Wei,\nYet where to find one’s true abode?\nIn facing affairs, one knows the value of leisure,\nIn stilling the mind, one perceives the Dao’s majesty.\nAncient masters personally demonstrated ruin,\nTemporarily borrowing aid from the Mysterious Gate.\nWhy boast of flint’s sharpness?\nShang Qiu remains in dullness.\nThree years to form a single leaf,\nAll by grace of heaven’s favor.\nThe secret of ascending immortality is broken—\nKunlun’s peaks array the Two Modes.\nThe elixir furnace gathers divine fire,\nThe precious tripod glows with nocturnal radiance.\nRefining the body into golden liquid,\nNourishing the countenance into jade mist.\nMighty spirit shines in great abundance,\nThe roc’s wings reach the celestial pool.\nHaving encountered the true immortal’s secret,\nI dwell in seclusion to refine the valley spirit.\nThrough penetrating the mysterious, self and other are forgotten,\nAttaining the wondrous, kinship and estrangement dissolve.\nYin Shi transformed into a servant,\nThe laborer presumptuously played the guest—\nNo need to distinguish waking from dreaming,\nBeyond appearances lies eternal spring.\nA long whistle laughs at the unworthy,\nFishing for fools, not for fish.\nA needle’s tip dispenses grains of rice,\nA standing tree praises the long road.\nWhen singing in harmony, gratitude must be distant,\nThose who know the tune keep the Dao close.\nLooking down upon my disciples,\nNot one shares the same aspiration.\nStriking tiles, the child is careless,\nMocking poetry, the vase is but a model.\nInquiring of the dawn, one knows distance,\nPitying creatures, one discerns their arising.\nDispelling illusions, the ring dance ceases,\nWelcoming the lord, facing the circular screen.\nRefining cinnabar to temper azure jade,\nExchanging bones to ascend Qingcheng.\nOn the road, startled by the three cloths,\nMidway, wary of the five brews.\nThe inept servant cannot judge a horse,\nThe neighbor’s son has already lost his sheep.\nWhy plot to wear Zhang’s seal?\nWhy imitate Ji Chang?\nNot boasting of autumn waters’ arrival,\nThe heart finds boundless ease.\nThe Great Dao manifests the Three Bodies,\nThe Three Bodies all converge in one truth.\nThe black dragon hides in the depths,\nThe cinnabar phoenix rises in auspicious clouds.\nThe two apertures pour forth golden liquid,\nThe twin passes refine the jade spirit.\nWisdom’s light soars to the purple towers,\nResplendent, it illumines the celestial wheel.\nSplitting open the seamless pagoda,\nReleasing the primordial essence.\nQi spreads, calming the three rivers,\nClouds withdraw, clarifying the four seas.\nThe golden serpent roams the water palace,\nThe jade hare hastens to the fiery city.\nRefining the firm and pure nature,\nReturning to rest in the Great Clarity.\nTen thousand *yi* given are still too few,\nA single hair’s aid is more than enough.\nAt ease with the three excellences,\nDwelling in leisure for a hundred years.\nThe Yan capital holds no intent to depart,\nThe Hua Xu realm beckons with purpose.\nLife and death are but momentary realizations,\nForgotten again in an instant.\nHidden illumination pierces the jade grove,\nJasper blossoms scatter from the jeweled peak.\nThe vermilion court hears the golden phoenix cry,\nThe lunar palace echoes the jade dragon’s chant.\nRefining the body to condense the Three Qi,\nNourishing the spirit to disperse the Nine Yin.\nThe mysterious image is like a precious mirror,\nEver present in the azure sky’s heart.\n\n**Two five-character quatrains**\n\nAzure pupils cast light to earth,\nThe red sun’s flames reach heaven.\nWithin the five-colored clouds,\nA single lotus leaf in the Jasper Pool.\nOuter and inner are all illusion,\nThe center is wholly void.\nPointing to the unenlightened—\nWhere to apply effort?\n\n**Seven-character quatrains**\n\nThe true message is clearly revealed,\nThe celestial eye pierces emptiness through wisdom’s power.\nAbove and below, perfectly fused—nothing remains,\nMajestically revealing the vast and luminous.\nWho can recognize the Primordial Dao of Mystery?\nSilent and desolate, it enters without seam.\nStriking with unyielding might, it shatters the sky,\nCongealing emptiness, ten thousand points of streaming stars emerge.\nThe Primordial Void Sovereign gave birth to the Great Antiquity,\nFitting to be the eternal lord of the mysterious.\nAmong the four great domains, it alone stands first,\nEnduring through kalpas as heaven and earth’s ancestor.\nNourishing the spirit, I knock upon the Dao to clarify mysterious virtue,\nVastly distant from misty vines, still and silent.\nLeaping forth as a flying immortal into Great Hua,\nDwelling forever in the serene and sunlit realm.\nThe heart connects to wondrous subtleties, illuminating true patterns,\nAttaining that pure emptiness, delving into profundities.\nThe supreme Dao is level and easy, taken in due course,\nAscending the mysterious to become a guest of the Great Canopy.\nAt heaven and earth’s center, like a bellows,\nSkillfully harmonizing sound and form through mutual accord.\nWithin the mysterious, not striking the fine notes,\nA single strain of reed pipes pierces the phoenix pavilion.\nThe Jade Clarity Sage Ancestor left the Three Armors,\nResponding to the supremely profound and wondrous Dharma.\nSending forth jasper blossoms to descend from the azure sky,\nRed frost flake by flake, pressed by fragrant winds.\nSincerity subdues the corporeal soul, uplifting the ethereal,\nLuminous qi, pure and clear, envelops the jeweled jade.\nIntent follows the sun’s splendor into emerald peaks,\nJade cliffs stretch into the gaze of empty mountains.\nShaking off the dusty world, not long submerged,\nMerging with the Great Beginning, knowing the true origin.\nDivine might and qi’s image encompass heaven’s heart,\nThe Dao spreads the sun’s essence, bright and glistening.\nThe Dao slays the Three Corpses through the power of attraction,\nThe numinous yang elixir conceals pure yin.\nSuddenly, unaware, the inner form is forgotten,\nSeated, one attains the cloudy heavens, the spirit feasts in repose.\nWithin, the essence is cleansed, the void gleams with jade fragments,\nClear as ice, lustrous as the autumn river’s moon.\nThe Crimson Palace faintly senses the crystal’s chill,\nJeweled splendor, starlight’s radiance, flying flakes of snow.\nA single point of heaven’s light in the Great Void,\nClapping, sealing, surging harmony enters without seam.\nTreading upon the ten thousand fathoms’ peak of heaven and earth,\nCongealing emptiness, flying stars rush forth.\nThe jade well’s flowing spring does not burst forth,\nThe resonant chime echoes against the green mountains.\n\nThe jade waves surge through the peaks’ clouds,\nWaves batter Kunlun’s stones to powder.\nThe golden well glows with the sun’s radiance,\nCloud-jades fly forth from the Jasper Pool Isle.\n\nThe crystal curtain winds roll, wafting pure fragrance,\nHeaven’s lustrous void, dustless, transmits the Six Treasures.\nThe Dharma-eye unfolds at the brows’ lashes,\nEyes gleam, pupils dazzle, weaving celestial brilliance.\n\nAwe-inspiring wind encircles the earth from the four directions,\nTen thousand streams of numinous light greet the heavens.\nThe Primordial Beginning dwelt before the vast kalpas,\nOpening the Three Realms, establishing the Double Mystery.\n\nHeaven and earth are born from Its transformation,\nThrough kalpas’ ruin, It endures, ever majestic.\nThe Dao transforms the Three Palaces in wondrous mystery,\nThe Primordial Spirit Emperor secretly transmits It.\n\nFetal radiance flows into the numinous yang body,\nSix Caverns’ flying essence descends from the Nine Heavens.\nThe pilgrim’s staff stirs the sea of Perfect Awakening,\nThe precept-knife cleaves the Jade Capital Mountain.\n\nThe Dragon Palace proffers the resplendent Mystic Pearl,\nSubtle flowing light fills heaven and earth.\nJade-like forms ascend the peaks in reverse,\nThe numinous crow alights by the sea turtle’s edge.\n\nForms shift, shadows turn, following the wind’s departure,\nThings change, stars drift, waves meet the sky.\nThe divine sword, whetted, startles the mad steed,\nThe wisdom-blade, brandished, shocks the playful ape.\n\nHeaven and earth stand apart, all demons’ heads severed,\nA single surge of awe-inspiring light topples the world.\nAt night, the sonorous stone is cast into the sea’s depths,\nThe Water Palace is split open, revealing the Dragon Palace.\n\nAll proffer the luminous pearl in offering,\nFlames blaze in the cloudy skies, the azure firmament.\nThe Precept Altar’s sacred beasts exhale fragrant spirals,\nJade pendants chime, harmonizing with the tinkling girdle-ornaments.\n\nTrue sages descend, returning to their original stations,\nOnce more wielding the divine sword, ascending the stellar pivot.\nI urge you to keep your heart in the realm of Dao and virtue,\nI hear the immortal courts have established the examination grounds.\n\nThe Divine Empyrean bears wings to transmit the golden register,\nThe Purple Palace knows no one to present the jade missive.\nThe dragon soars, roaming the Crimson Emperor’s realm,\nThe Luo Yuan immortal maiden sits in Flowery Yang.\n\nTwo streams of earthly qi traverse the Ox and Dipper,\nA single ray of heavenly light anchors the azure vault.\nThe Crimson Palace just perceives the talismanic smoke’s fragrance,\nThe wind gently carries the sound of jade pendants.\n\nIn the clear night, who presents the memorial?\nThe perfected one paces the stellar pivot upon the altar.\nCultivation must attain the Valley Spirit’s numinosity,\nA single point of perfect clarity illumines the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe frosty sky, profound, hosts the ancient moon,\nThe limpid sea of awakening bathes the streaming stars.\nA single grain of numinous cinnabar glows in the Great Clarity,\nMerged with the empty valley, the formless appears.\n\nThe Dharma-realm’s boundless truth gleams in a thousandfold purity,\nMisty radiance illumines the ten thousand images of heaven and earth.\nThe ancient Dao, level and smooth, allows progress,\nTwo branching paths connect to the celestial court.\n\nRiding the dragon, the maiden of alchemy roams the Golden Gates,\nMounting the tiger, the infant traverses the Jade Capital.\nTreading Kunlun, piercing the heavens,\nReturning to the supreme Dao, restoring the primordial origin.\n\nTigers leap, mountain peaks turn,\nDragons soar from the abyss, sea waves churn.\nOpening the wisdom-eye, beholding the divine light,\nA single surge of pure yin wholly transforms into yang.\n\nVast as the sun rising to illuminate the world,\nBright as the moon casting its glow upon all directions.\nBrushing aside the mist, the spirit roams the azure realm,\nTwo wheels converge, grinding the stellar pivot.\n\nDragons fly in the sun’s palace, brewing golden liquid,\nPhoenixes blaze in the moon’s palace, drinking jade nectar.\nShunning worldly ties, seeking beyond the material,\nHead held high, laughing freely, delighting in the joy of song.\n\nShifting the spirit, step by step, following the wind’s path,\nEscorting my light form to ascend the precious peak.\nThe Dao descends in misty splendor, the scene is sublime,\nThe wondrous birth of heaven and earth knows no bounds.\n\nFlying essence, refined, pierces the heavens’ summit,\nEmbracing the sun, approaching the void, transforming Mount Taihua.\nAvoiding wind, nestling by the sun, eyes languidly open,\nWithin, yin and yang unite to nurture the sacred embryo.\n\nOnly then does one believe a man’s body can conceive,\nNaturally, beyond the material, the immortal fetus dances.\nPairing heaven and earth to serve as the elixir furnace,\nThe sun and moon, round, encircle the face’s dwelling.\n\nAt the sea’s bottom, the true supreme treasure is refined,\nThe gray-haired one cooks the Primordial Pearl to perfection.\nSlaying the ape, taming the horse, transforming the dragon colt,\nIt bears me, following the wind, into the Great Void.\n\nA single streaming star flies to the moon’s palace,\nTwo crimson flames ascend to the celestial Wu.\nClad in simplicity, awakened, drinking the true wind,\nEmerging from the human realm, affairs are not the same.\n\nShould you ask where the master abides,\nSteadily riding the crane’s back, wings upon the turtle palace.\nAmidst the seated clouds and mist, the cold stream is locked,\nThunder’s peaks rumble, disturbing the Supreme Subtlety.\n\nTen thousand silver waves pour into the azure ravine,\nA single surge of jade waves cascades into the Jasper Pool.\nThe sun’s soul and moon’s spirit cast their cold radiance,\nThe two are captured, held between Kan and Li.\n\nSuddenly, from the sea’s depths, the dragon and tiger roar,\nAtop the mountain, the phoenix and luan bird take startled flight.\nThe layered peaks of Guye cast floating emerald shadows,\nWithin the grotto, the divine transformation reveals snow-white skin.\n\nBy what power does one roam the four seas?\nThe crane’s chariot, riding the whirlwind, departs the Jade Capital.\nReleasing the jade hare to chase the numinous crow,\nCatching up to the Gate of Simplicity, entering the Great Beginning.\n\nTen thousand golden rays illuminate the cosmos,\nA thousand silver mists shine upon the void.\nTo refine the One True, the Three Wonders must be cultivated,\nThen employ the Three Wonders to unite the Two Modes.\n\nIf the Two Modes are made one body,\nThe golden elixir will naturally pierce the heavens and fly.\nEyes pure, beholding the celestial signs,\nEars keen, listening to the steps of emptiness.\n\nGreat is the Dao that follows all directions,\nThe most wondrous true constancy merges with the sun’s congealment.\nThe fiery furnace pours into the tripod, refining red cinnabar,\nThree-colored mists swirl, releasing rainbow hues.\n\nResplendent treasures, intricate, fly through the cosmos,\nThe Primordial Elixir descends into the Central Land.\nThe body like withered wood, the nature like ashes,\nSilently, in clarity, nurturing the sacred embryo.\n\nSeated in the jade palace, coming to inquire of the Dao,\nHead held high, laughing freely, the osmanthus blooms.\nBrows arched, eyes bright, the heart’s pearl leaps,\nDescending upon the golden plate, five colors unfurl.\n\nWithin, dispatching the jade lad to gather the sun’s sea,\nTo accompany me in returning to the grotto-heaven’s abode.\nWhen lead and mercury are paired, rely on the sun and moon,\nWhen the tripod and furnace are placed, employ heaven and earth.\n\nThe Three Yangs’ true fire burns the numinous substance,\nA single grain of golden elixir ascends in reverse.\nA foot’s distance, yet the sea of suffering is deep,\nThe mind follows the currents, drifting into the waves’ heart.\n\nLosing the celestial truth, one wanders through a thousand kalpas,\nFrom ancient times until now, endlessly cycling.\nAscending the Mystery, awakening to the Dao’s profundity,\nExpanding the numinous source, concealing the illusory heart.\n\nIn an instant, traversing all directions,\nOnly by treading the ancient path can one know the present.\nStartled awake, one awakens to the immortal realm,\nOnly then does one trust the spirit’s congealment in the sun’s beneficent light.\n\nIn the child’s furnace, the jade liquid pours,\nWithin the fetal immortal’s tripod, the jasper nectar blends.\n\nThe Dao’s utmost profundity, wondrous and mysterious,\nThe Supreme Clarity’s true teaching—how could it be vain words?\nIf you still possess a man’s resolve,\nI shall impart the celestial mechanism to your ear alone.\n\nAll speak of refining the elixir, yet none speak of the elixir’s duality—\nThe two golden elixirs lie but a foot’s span from the Great Void.\nA single pill, resplendent, illuminates the cosmos,\nYet in daily use, it seems as distant as ten thousand mountains.\n\nGazing down, one sees Earth’s tranquility in Kun’s softness;\nLooking up, one beholds Heaven’s clarity in Qian’s Dao.\nFloating and sinking, their positions manifest in the center,\nMerging with the Void, sun and moon shine brightly.\n\nWithin, purify the mind-ape to nurture the pearl of nature;\nWithout, subdue the intent-horse to refine the path of darkness.\nThe numinous light pierces the Golden Crow’s cavern,\nMerging into perfect clarity, the body unites with the Great Void.\n\nGently strike the jade lock, the grotto gate opens,\nA pair of divine winds rush through the doorway.\nWith intent, embrace the simurgh and soar to the Moon Palace,\nBeneath the Yinless Tree, wander at leisure.\n\nThe four leaky vessels ultimately return to illusion,\nOnly the perfectly luminous nature is not yet true.\nWait until your name is inscribed in the Jade Empyrean,\nOnly then shall you truly embody the one who has left the household.\n\nCloudy mists scatter as dawn’s frost glistens,\nIn the clear night, dustless, the moon is full.\nSeated, one draws near the jasper palace,\nWithin ninefold radiance, the Golden Immortal is borne aloft.\n\nKan and Li unite, breaking free from the dusty world’s confines,\nSun and moon exchange their light, illuminating the body.\nWater and fire refine the Leakless Child,\nThe precious vase cradles the Jade Flower Infant.\n\nGolden crystals rain through the jade window,\nThe Hua Yang Immortal enters the Central August.\nThe Lesser Weaving Star falls to the clear river’s depths,\nThe crane presses the treetops, snow dusts the frost.\n\nThe waters are pure, fishless, waves touch the sky,\nThe numinous spirit flies away, entering the Essence Abyss.\nHua Yang does not follow the red dust’s path,\nFor the divine wind naturally merges with the Great Mystery.\n\n*Supreme Clarity and Great Mystery Collection, Scroll Six Concludes*\n*Supreme Clarity and Great Mystery Collection, Scroll Seven*\n\n**Seven-Character Verses by Gu Shehou Shanyuan**\n\nKan and Li intertwine, merging the sacred mechanism,\nTwo paths sever the way, linking to Heaven’s frontier.\nThe celestial cycle ten thousand times returns, the dragon assumes its stance,\nThe earth a thousand fathoms deep, the tiger displays its might.\n\nDriving back external demons, eradicating the six harms,\nSeizing the retreating yin ghosts and the Three Worms.\nFrom between the brows, the toad sword is drawn,\nWith a single slash, floating clouds mend the leaky pond.\n\nCarefree and untroubled, delighting in pure leisure,\nLeading cranes, bearing staffs, wandering water and mountain.\nWind rolls emerald mist across verdant peaks,\nMoonlight and gentle haze reach the blue ridges.\n\nBefore the grotto, water bursts forth like a thousand pearls,\nBeneath the ravine, clouds congeal into a ball of snow.\nLuminous and crystalline, the Dao-eye shines,\nDivinely clear and refreshing, chilling all who approach.\n\nIn the primal chaos, the Two Modes first parted,\nThe Three Powers transformed, root of creation.\nAscending and descending, sun and moon soar,\nFloating and sinking, Qian and Kun stand firm.\n\nJade fragments drift down from the void,\nGolden elixir grains surge upward in reverse.\nTwo azure lads roam the green peaks,\nEmbracing the simurgh, they fly into the Gate of the Great Mystery.\n\nSuddenly, the nature awakens to the true source,\nInstantly, the heart-pearl connects everywhere.\nUnfettered and pure, returning to refined delight,\nMighty and spiritually refined, washing away dust and delusion.\n\nClouds withdraw, revealing the moon in the deep pool,\nMists disperse, and the primordial wind arises.\nSupremely all-knowing, pervading the ten directions,\nPerfectly luminous, the solitary body illumines the void.\n\nSplitting open chaos to reveal Heaven’s heart,\nThe essence of sun and moon fills the Great Yin.\nThe Dipper’s handle turns, heaven and earth rain,\nThe Dharma wheel revolves, the Great Void deepens.\n\nIntermingling light emits a thousand pearls,\nChaotic things welcome ten thousand specks of gold.\nThe supreme treasure needs no search beyond,\nNurturing spirit and awareness, the Dao takes its course.\n\nEmbracing constancy, knowing contentment, the primordial spirit is restored,\nDelighting in ease and tranquility, the utmost truth is cultivated.\nEradicating sharpness, eliminating greed, the Dao is fully realized,\nDispelling the blade, gazing into the mystery, the eternal body is renewed.\n\nExternally seeking jade and pearls brings no true worth,\nInternally cleansing the sacred casket is never impoverished.\nWhere does the crane’s chariot, borne on the whirlwind, alight?\nWithin the grotto, only the four seasons renew.\n\nEver preserve the will, severing false splendor,\nReturning to reflect on the Dragon Realm, the Purple Mansion.\nIn the indistinct, the primordial spirit surges through vast qi,\nIn the profound darkness, true breath radiates crimson mist.\n\nThe Jade Pool’s waves are pure, golden pistils float,\nThe Azure Sea’s ripples are clear, jade blossoms drift.\nFragrance unfurls, heaven and earth gleam,\nFrom the congealed void, night-bright sand flies.\n\nDivine fire blazes fiercely on Mount Gen,\nWith a single thrust from the tail gate, the Three Passes open.\nThe colossal image of heaven circles the void,\nThe sea-blending flood dragons coil beyond all things.\n\nCongealing in one crucible, the marrow of heaven and earth,\nFusing in two cauldrons, the liver of the Great Yang.\nThose who awaken to this ascend as immortals,\nRiding the Yi, mounting the true, straddling the colored simurgh.\n\nTurning the Dipper’s handle, moving the numinous pivot,\nThe Great Being’s gate opens—nothing remains.\nExternally embracing the primordial Dao of Heaven,\nInternally concealing two scrolls of life-giving scripture.\n\nFrom nothingness, a thousand layers of jade are built,\nIn emptiness, ten thousand pearls are adorned.\nWith merit and practice both complete, transcending the world,\nRiding the whale, stepping steadily toward Yingdu.\n\nVastly opening the wisdom eye, revealing the clear gaze,\nThe two wings of divine wind chase the sun’s head.\nIn the Ren-Wu clouds, riding the jade elephant,\nIn the Ding-Gong sea, straddling the golden ox.\n\nCrimson mist curls around the Dragon Pavilion,\nPurple haze swirls thickly around the Phoenix Tower.\nShould one ask what blessed land this is,\nThe azure lad respectfully reports: it is Yingzhou.\n\nCurbing desire, removing passion, the will stands firm,\nThe barren wilderness of the quail transforms into fields of lingzhi.\nThe heart like the azure Han, probing the moon in the deep pool,\nThe nature like the red furnace, a lotus within the flame.\n\nRoaming and feasting beyond the true realms of Supreme Clarity,\nLingering in the primordial Great Luo Heaven of Yuanshi.\nThe Central August names me the Double Mystery Child,\nThe Gu She immortal dwells as the Primordial Transcendent.\n\nReversing yin and yang is true cultivation,\nA single torrent of the Yellow River flows backward.\nTen thousand strands of white light pierce the corners of the universe,\nA thousand threads of crimson flame emerge from mountain peaks.\n\nThe sun’s soul gleams brightly, manifesting everywhere,\nThe moon’s spirit radiates brilliantly, circling all directions.\nGreatly unfolding the majestic wind, opening the ancient Dao,\nRiding the simurgh, wielding the sword, roaming the nine heavens.\n\n**Ode to Nurturing Spirit**\nIn true emptiness, the child-mother mechanism is complete,\nGhosts and spirits intermingle, penetrating the mud pill.\nThe Two Modes and the Great Beginning must return to one—\nThe Dao of the Three Essentials.\n\nThe six directions share a single path—\nThe mechanism of the six harmonies.\nThe nine qi, profoundly mysterious, are the body beyond—\nThe Dao of the nine yang.\n\nThe celestial flow and heavenly water are the central symbol—\nThe mechanism of the upper pivot.\nOne must rely on the essentials, the master’s clear teaching,\nThe most profound explanation of the Double Mystery.\n\n**Ode to the Mysterious Image**\nVaguely, the divine transforms, the Jade Pass opens,\nA single point of fetal light descends upon the wisdom terrace.\nNaturally, the brilliance of Li and Yang shines,\nReturning the light to the origin, the flame glows white.\n\nThe Double Mystery’s wondrous pointer is hard to fathom,\nThe gate of all wonders—fools cannot guess.\nSerene, it may exist, approaching the morning audience with the Emperor,\nEmbracing the heart-moon, hastening to Penglai.\n\n**Ode to Cultivating Nature**\nIn the indistinct, departing for the Toad Palace to nurture the nature-embryo,\nThe hidden dragon bathes the cinnabar embryo beneath the waters.\nOne must know that guarding the dark is the root,\nNaturally, the numinous radiance illuminates the nature-terrace.\n\nWithin chaos, the Great One is revealed,\nIn the profound darkness, the heart’s brilliance is unfathomable.\nOne should follow where the wisdom-soul and yang arise,\nThe resplendent mystery-pearl moves of itself.\n\n**Ode to Heavenly Auspices**\nThe Heavenly Treasure is naturally so, without contrivance,\nAbandoning wisdom, leaving form, preceding the ten thousand transformations.\nLeaving nature to accompany emptiness, light pervades all,\nMoving spirit, gazing into the mystery, the Jade Heaven gleams.\n\nAllowing things and self to become illusory,\nNaturally, starry radiance shines before the eyes.\nThe sea-moon contains brilliance, light in ten thousand strands,\nTransforming into the Heavenly Auspicious Jade Pot Immortal.\n\nQian’s origin, benefit, and harmony reveal my spirit,\nThe five qi ascend to the origin, employing the utmost truth.\nThe *Zhouyi*’s opening and closing clarify movement and change,\nThe ten thousand mechanisms converge, emerging from the dust.\n\nFollowing the mechanism, responding to all, observing the mysterious image,\nAll day, diligently, drawing near to the Dao.\nInternally and externally crystalline, penetrating inside and out,\nThe numinous radiance adorns me, hastening to Pengying.\n\n**Hidden-Head Poems**\nQi intermingles, the ten thousand things flourish—know this,\nThe eye’s qi refines the true, the yin soul scatters—awareness.\nThe Yellow Palace’s chambers, the Dao is complete within the Great—\nThe four enter the numinous emperor, images gather in the void.\n\nOpening, returning to the hour, awakening the drunken soul—treasure bright,\nThe grotto’s gate gleams, the three mountains gather mist—clear.\n\n**Again**\nDwelling in solitude near the forest springs, the jade stream,\nA thousand years of bitter practice rely on the heart’s deep rectitude.\n\nThe Three Perfections’ wondrous form—vainly slight in record’s light,\nIn primordial chaos, immortals soar, transformations fill the vast expanse.\nThings refine within, naturally merging with Heaven’s diligence—\nLuminous brilliance shines on both, yet formless is the Way.\n\n**Lyrics to \"Fragrant Incense\"**\nHeaven and earth, dark and yellow, follow transformations, unforced.\nThe Great Void’s heights—sun and moon take flight.\nDragon musk and starry Dipper, phoenix ignites the Mysterious Net.\nBehold the sea’s divine tides, the river’s spirit convenes, the valley’s power unfurls.\n\nResplendent, radiant, illuminating the ten directions.\nMerging the Three Palaces, with one shake, yang currents flow.\nNot apart from daily use, here and now, receive and uphold.\nGradually return to true emptiness, revert to true correctness, attain true constancy.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Lesser Layered Mountains\"**\nYin and yang inverted—a single thunderclap.\nSuddenly startled from sleep, awakened within the dream.\nDeluded clouds brushed away, wisdom’s light unfolds.\nFollowing the wind, embracing the sun’s orb, I come.\n\nTempering nurtures the immortal embryo.\nIn emptiness, clearly manifest, surpassing the numinous terrace.\nGazing all around—above and below—at Penglai.\nWorthy to return to the jade grotto as immortal talent.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Intertwined Branches\"**\nBlunting sharpness, no shame; encountering favor, no joy.\n\nAmidst gentle softness and ordinary ease, flow with conditions and pass by—unfettered and at peace.\nStrolling through forests and springs, deep into emerald clouds,\nI delight in a lifetime of pure leisure.\nShould one wish to transcend birth and death,\nto grasp that truth of eternal constancy:\nRefine qi into spirit, spirit soars beyond the azure vault,\none with the Great Void.\nRoam boundless heaven and earth, forever free from care—\nattain longevity and enduring vision.\n\n**Two Poems to the Tune of \"A Sprig of Plum Blossoms\"**\nOne in worldly toil, one in ceaseless haste.\nSince parting, one attains true constancy.\nOne day of radiant essence, one day of cool clarity—\na single gleam of pure light,\na single band of congealed yang.\nOne qi intermingles, one qi expands.\nOne binds the elixir of spirit, one extends life’s span.\nOne numinous spark enters one cloud-chamber—\na pair of golden youths,\none guides to the immortal realm.\n\nAgain:\nLightly breaking from the world, tender green branches grow.\nUnlike the pine and bamboo, they alone endure frost and wind.\nA heart steadfast through winter’s cold—auspicious sign.\nTiny buds first bloom,\noutshining all other fragrances.\nLet not the graceful one overstep the powdered wall.\nLet Huan Yi play his flute—\nwhat harm in his artful strains?\nNature’s beauty unfolds in golden splendor.\nPeerless charm, pure and rare—\nthe fragrance of a single sprig of plum.\n\n**Two Poems to the Tune of \"Voicing Hidden Feelings\"**\nYin and yang cycle—let no deviation arise.\nHold to correctness, let not the heart stray.\n\nPerpetual tending of the alchemical furnace and crucible,\nDragon and Tiger stir the Three Carts.\nGather the divine water, refine the essence’s splendor,\ncongeal the numinous cinnabar.\nWithin the crystal palace,\njade hare and golden rooster\nspit forth blossoms of jade radiance.\n\nAgain:\nOne day’s autumn hues, emerald as if painted.\nThe wild goose trills its high song.\nMountains resplendent, waters bright—mirroring each other,\nmist-laden trees reflecting on the brook’s bridge.\nWhite waves surge,\ncloud-waves billow,\nbrushing the light robe.\nReturning, deep in intoxication,\nuntil dusk descends,\nmoonlight cresting the pine boughs.\n\n**To the Tune of \"Tang Duoling\"**\nCease this bitter striving for silks,\nhow long does a human life endure?\nAlas—these hundred years,\nbut a dream of Nanke.\nWealth and honor, fame and achievement—all as one desires,\nyet none escape the grindstone of death and life.\n*Ye luo.*\n\nFollow your portion, nurture harmony with heaven,\nyang flourishes, the crucible brims full.\nWithin, simmer and seethe,\ncongealing the numinous waves.\nRefine the golden elixir until its light suffuses the body,\nmerge into one qi,\npervading the sahā world.\n*Ye luo.*\n\n**Four Returning Songs**\nThe Way of long life,\nin daily practice abides in emptiness.\nOne qi first divides, clearly moving and still,\nthe Three Powers transform, revealing sinking and floating.\nThe jade hare pursues the spirit crow.\n\nRumbling through the cosmos,\na single strike shatters the dark thoroughfare.\nLight pierces the White Tiger’s brow on Three Mountains,\nflames fly from the twin strands of the Red Dragon’s whiskers,\nilluminating the night-shining pearl.\n\nAgain:\nThe work of cultivation—\nsever love, cut off entanglements.\nBody purified, heart cleansed, the Dao-eye bright,\nwithin, uphold the untainted, qi and spirit whole.\nTrue mercury refines true lead.\n\nSet the furnace and crucible,\nproceed with fire, let it simmer and boil.\nGently ladled, hammered into flakes,\nround and round, congealed into a precious pearl.\nBeyond the body, transform into a flying immortal.\n\nThe True Constant Dao,\nin daily practice pervades the three thousand worlds.\nVast, it encompasses beyond heaven and earth;\nsmall, it circles even a grain of sand or mustard seed.\nIn every thing, the Mystery is fully known.\n\nMighty spiritual power,\nwithin the undifferentiated, moves in ceaseless return.\nShattering empty space into seven or eight fragments,\na luminous pearl rolls forth from the sea turtle’s edge.\nIts light joins the flaming demon-heaven.\n\nAgain:\nForsake worldly thoughts,\nall the ten thousand kinds are utterly empty.\nSinging by the pillow, sleeping at night, dreams of wandering cease;\nhalf a window’s bright moon, a curtain’s breeze.\nGently, one awakens in a hazy drowse.\n\nDonning robes, sitting,\nat once beholding the original countenance.\nIn the quiet chamber, radiance arises, vast qi surging;\nin the empty hall, auspicious signs reveal divine work.\nLight shines within the jade flask.\n\n*Jiangshenzi*\nThe cinnabar flower vainly clings to a false frame,\nlong buried, inviting misfortune and calamity.\nTiny mayflies, all are pressed by death and life.\nSuddenly awakening, knowing self and other perish,\nletting form and emptiness come before the eyes.\n\nThe golden crow beneath the sea first appears,\nthe azure sky opens, free of the slightest dust.\nLight densely spreads across the heavens,\nbrilliant light returns before the face.\nIntertwined splendor—jade-like youths outshine jade,\nlike snow reflecting a single plum branch.\n\n*Shengshengman (Seven Poems)*\nThe human heart is hard and stubborn,\nunwilling to turn back.\nDeeply submerged in the bitter sea, lingering.\nWine, sex, wealth, and qi—never forsaken,\nwhen will it ever end?\nHearing early, seek the path of return,\njoyfully drifting like clouds and water.\nNo entanglements, no vexations, no sorrows,\nno joys, no cares.\n\nGradually entering the cool, living practice,\nembracing heaven’s true purity, a single qi harmonious and gentle.\nMatching frost-like lead, repeatedly gathering transformations within the crucible.\nGently, the golden elixir gradually congeals;\nlater, the work complete, seizing immortality’s companions.\nWorthy of returning,\nriding the phoenix and crane, ascending to\nthe Purple Court and Penglai Isles.\n\nAgain:\nThe heart floats, easily moved,\nfamiliar scenes hard to forget.\nHurried all day long, restless.\nAlready past middle age,\nlike the fading light of dusk.\nJust as a dying lamp fears dawn,\nlike wind-blown withered leaves turning yellow.\nMost bitter is the sigh—\nas stars shift and things change,\none is seized by impermanence.\n\nSeeing through, seek the path of return,\nknocking earnestly at the Mystery Gate,\ndiscussing the immortal’s recipe.\nEntrusted with intimate transmission,\ncalm the heart, in the quiet chamber ponder deeply.\nPolish the ice-like platform until it gleams,\nrevealing divine light, merging into the numinous yang.\nPerfectly bright and manifest,\nattaining long life and enduring vision,\neternal peace and well-being.\n\nAgain:\nTime swiftly passes,\nlike ants in an endless cycle.\nBack and forth, unbroken in succession.\nA year gone by,\nunaware, another year has already come.\nSuddenly, the limit of impermanence arrives—\nwhat can one delay in the journey ahead?\nThe work of cultivation:\nothers may have a share,\nbut oneself has no fate for it.\n\nIf one turns back in awakening,\nforsaking fame, wealth, and honor,\ndetached beyond the world.\nPreserve the original essence,\nin the jade furnace, simmer flakes of snow.\nVaguely, heaven and earth become radiant and clear,\nbrilliant and translucent, the sun’s light dazzling.\nThe Three Lights shine,\nblending the one numinous true nature,\nescorting it to the Jade Heaven.\n\nAgain:\nThe busy fool, burdened and dull,\nunaware of others’ praise.\nWildly chasing absurdities, acting recklessly.\nStubborn and witless,\nvainly seeking, wildly guessing.\nHasty words, empty quarrels,\nbattling ignorance, galloping in strange perversities.\nForcing ruin,\nblocking others, burying oneself.\n\nIf one awakens to the celestial mechanism’s secret,\nknocking once at the Mystery Pass,\nthe jeweled cavern’s gate opens.\nThe jade maiden and golden youth,\nentering and exiting, nestling side by side.\nNaturally, yin and yang unite,\nin the void, giving birth to an immortal embryo.\nThe True Person appears,\nleaping over the turtle palace and sun hall,\nroaming freely at will.\n\nAgain:\nHard and soft, strong and weak,\ngood and evil clearly distinguished.\n\nThe responses of Heaven and Earth differ:\nThose who muddy the Way to flaunt prosperity,\nwhile the steadfast and virtuous languish in poverty.\nThe wondrous Dao of purity and non-action\nis slandered by fools as a heretical gate.\nHow can they understand?\nTo those true cultivators who refine themselves,\nthey appear as enemies.\nThe lofty Dao is suspected as theft and banditry,\nwhile the vicious and stubborn are deemed worthy.\nAdorned in fine robes and sashes,\nversed in etiquette, yet blind to rank.\nThe masses learn only to brawl,\nheedlessly debating human ethics.\nAll is swept aside—\ncloud-patterned robes and hairpins exchanged\nfor a simple headscarf.\n\nAgain:\nWisdom and folly intermingle,\nright and wrong entangled in the thicket,\nclear and turbid matters urgently confused.\nHow many, in ignorance,\nspeak recklessly, indulging in absurdities?\nThe phoenix chick is called a sparrow,\nthe sacred *chun* tree mistaken for a morning mushroom.\nEven if one were as eloquent as Sui He or Lu Jia,\nthere would be no door for reasoned debate.\nNiu Que feigns benevolence and righteousness,\nwhile Xiang Wu, eyes locked, obscures his celestial truth.\nBlind men groping an elephant,\nday and night, unaware of light or dark.\nThe jade chime is used as cooking fuel,\nthe sacred *hulian* vessel treated as a mere mortar.\nMost grievous of all—\njade zithers burned, phoenix plumes boiled,\nthe qilin and unicorn slain in error.\n\nAgain:\nTime flies swiftly,\nsummer departs, winter arrives,\nsuddenly announcing another new year.\nForms shift, appearances change,\nall silently worn away in obscurity.\nWho realizes that each person grows older,\nyouthful verdancy replaced by silver hair and aged countenance?\nWasted away,\nlike fallen blossoms and drifting catkins,\ngone with the flowing water, never to return.\nYet if one turns the light inward,\nstirring the spiritual pivot with a single strike,\nshattering the twin barriers,\nthe luminous pearl of the sea shines,\nits radiant flame connecting with Kunlun’s peak.\nThe jewel of inherent nature illuminates the body,\ntransforming the mortal frame,\nnurturing the immortal elixir.\nThe Jade Dawn appears,\nsoaring through the central heavens,\ntranscendent and free beyond the worldly.\n\n**Nan Ke Zi**\nA thousand things exist before awakening,\nthe heart opens to nothingness.\nIn the struggle between being and non-being,\nawareness suddenly clarifies the void.\nWithin the chaos, yang pours forth,\na single point piercing the celestial crow.\nAuspicious vapors coil in the golden crucible,\nauspicious smoke plays in the jade vessel.\nIn the jade vessel and golden crucible,\nthe spirit pearl is refined.\nIts light, resplendent as flowing clouds,\nslowly ascends to the celestial Wu.\n\n**Tian Zi Cai Sang Zi**\nWithdraw early from the thicket of fame and profit,\nI urge you to turn your heart,\ncutting off all dissipation.\nWhen stirred, the demon hordes are instantly subdued—\ndo not let them encroach.\nThe nine worms slain, the three corpses destroyed,\nentrusting yourself to the Dao,\nwho then is your confidant?\nOn a clear night, dustless, the moon climbs the peak,\ngazing toward the grove of *qian* trees.\n\n**Jian Zi Cai Sang Zi**\nAlas, this bodily form—\na hundred deceptions,\ntwisted into wild perversities.\nNow awakened, I seek the path of return,\npure as ice, flawless as jade,\nsoaring to towering heights,\nwhy cling to the vulgar cliff?\nThe heart, still as an ice terrace,\nits spiritual light lustrous,\nuntouched by the slightest dust.\nSuddenly, another wondrous truth emerges—\n□ and *sheng* unite as one,\nascending through the mysterious, feather-transformed,\nshedding the mortal husk.\n\n**Ta Suo Xing (Two Poems)**\nWithin primordial chaos,\ntraces vanish into the boundless.\nFrom the vast expanse of *hongmeng* and *mingxing*,\nthe universe first unfolds.\nIn the hollow void, a single sun-star,\nits divine wind and qi expanding in majesty.\nGraceful as ice-formed flesh,\njade cliffs stretch across the azure.\n\nA crane startles heaven and earth—\na single bird soaring.\nNot merely traversing the Great Void,\nit shatters a thousand walls of Mount Jing.\nMoreover, nurturing *qi* and preserving spirit,\nits essence grows firm and unyielding.\nHow could the muddled vessel of mortal form comprehend?\nThe pearl of the heart leaps into the Great Void,\nthe Jade Infant’s divine transformations unlocking the gates of mystery.\nChasing away the Golden Crow,\npursuing the Jade Hare’s return,\ncongealed yang refines and ascends in immortal flight.\nPure tones and fragrant breezes escort its farewell from the Jasper Terrace,\nas the Perfected One, drunk, reclines in Penglai’s affairs.\n\n**The Oxherd**\nEssence depleted, soul scattered, spirit adrift.\nHeavenly truth warped into delusion.\nChasing appearances, the nature dims,\nadrift in the bitter sea, rushing and wandering.\nThe path ahead—how treacherous to navigate.\nI urge you all: cultivate the Supreme Dao early.\nThe Supreme Dao pervades all knowledge, luminous,\nits radiance outshining Li Lou and Huan the Master.\n\n**Yu Meiren**\nWithin the Cavern Origin, a single point of celestial light,\nluminous and pure as a thousand suns.\nSilver rosy clouds shimmer, threading through the earthly realm.\nMyriad spirits gather in awe,\nsuddenly, boundlessly bright.\nFrom the void emerges an embryonic immortal,\ngraceful as the wind’s drift.\nIt strikes open the heavens’ vault, ascending through clouded jade,\nwhere jeweled towers and jasper pavilions\ninscribe its name upon the Jade Register.\n\n**Dao Lian Zi (Two Poems)**\nSpeak of the Golden Elder,\ndiscourse on the Yellow Matriarch—\nnaturally paired, they refine harmony.\nMolten cinnabar fills the crucible,\nabundant and overflowing.\nDivine light manifests,\nilluminating the Celestial River.\nA single point of fetal radiance emerges from the vast waves,\nrevealing the Three Clarities,\nascending to the Great Luo.\n\n**True Lead and Mercury,**\nKan and Li in harmony.\nTwo reversed, yet naturally fitting.\nRefining the golden elixir,\nradiant as the sun’s brilliance.\nPenetrating the profound mystery,\nattaining the subtle and hidden.\nThe Crimson Maiden and Infant ever ride dragon and tiger.\nAscending to the Immortal Capital,\nuniting with the sacred mechanism.\n\n**Four Jade Tablets (Two Poems)**\nA single point, luminous and pure,\nlike ice and jade, unsullied.\nThrough kalpas unborn, undying,\ntranscending ancient and present without pause.\nGazing boundlessly,\ntrue emptiness gathers all.\nOnly then is the wondrous key understood—\nthe profound principle few discern.\nTwo paths diverge at Caoxi’s node,\nmirrored in water, the moon in empty sky.\n\nAgain,\nWithin the false, the true is sought—yet the true essence differs.\nWisdom’s illumination pierces the vast heavens.\nThe sun gleams, the void crystalline,\nspirit-light enfolding all.\nSealed in azure vastness,\ncongealed in emerald hue.\nAttaining this, the heart opens to the wondrous key,\nself and other both dissolve.\nBeyond birth and death, in endless clarity,\nthere is yet another—\nthe eternal moon in boundless sky.\n\n**Willow Branches (Seven Poems)**\nReclining, coiled in stillness, gazing into the precious mirror,\neyes without flaw.\nPurified vision, like an infant’s,\nupright in bearing.\nAsk where this night leads—\nto the immortal’s tryst.\nA boat laden with emptiness returns by moonlight,\nascending to the Jasper Pool.\n\nAgain,\nWithin, the compass and square reveal the root of the lineage,\nthe Dao flows through.\nIn solitude, abiding in the Primordial Palace,\nawakening to true emptiness.\nGazing above and below—nothing remains,\nwith whom to share?\nRoaming freely, seated alone in moonlight,\naccompanied by the pure wind.\n\nAgain,\nSuddenly perceiving the round and bright, the image of ease,\nmystery without end.\nAuspicious mist drifts into the Jade Clarity Palace,\nthe moon hangs in the void.\nNature’s essence, naturally pure, the ancient Dao—\nwith whom to share?\nWillow branches set in a precious vase,\na fine family tradition.\n\nAgain,\nPrecious nature perfected, rising and descending in harmony,\ninwardly probed to its depths.\nThreefold misty radiance illumines the Jade Palace,\nflames soaring into the void.\nThe Jade Yang’s clarity refines the precious sign,\nnaturally harmonized.\nThe Valley Spirit soars within the Primordial,\nplaying in the immortal’s wind.\n\nAgain,\nWho has seen the western dawn’s brocade adornments,\na scene beyond compare?\nMist-wreathed willow banks reflect the slanting sun,\na realm of water and clouds.\nThe home mountain lies near, yet none approach—\nwhat wondrous scenery!\nStepping into emptiness, ascending to the azure chamber,\nthe grotto-heaven endures.\n\nAgain,\nThe crane’s nature, lofty and far-reaching, climbs beyond,\npassing Tong Pass.\nDeep autumn, rain cleared, robes suddenly thin,\nwater and clouds chill.\nHow could one bear the taint of fame and profit in years past?\nBetter to return early.\nIn the twilight, villages fade into the mist,\ngazing toward home.\n\nAgain,\nIn the year of Mao, a tumbleweed drifting to distant mountains,\nwater and clouds at leisure.\nKnow that a thousand ages weary of the human realm—\nlonging to return.\nExchanging bones, shedding the fetal husk, retracing the old path,\nrestoring youthful countenance.\nStepping into emptiness, ascending to the ancient Star Altar,\nriding the cloud-phoenix.\n\n**Farewell to a Hundred Masters (Willow Branches)**\nWild cranes and solitary clouds depart and return,\nhard to detain.\nHeart-rending, the bond of love’s two passions,\ntears like scattered beads.\nAfter autumn, the homeward path is desolate and distant—\nhasten the climb.\nBy Luoyang’s misty shores, willow-fringed banks,\ngazing toward home.\n\n**Crossing the Mountain Stream**\nA man’s single resolve—\nnever let the initial aspiration wane.\nIn decisive rectitude, hold fast to integrity,\ncasting aside all reckless impulses.\nFollowing conditions, letting fate take its course,\nclouds and water as livelihood.\nBeneath green pines, amid emerald bamboo,\nlies a true and savory taste.\n\nSerene and empty, tranquil and still—\nthis is the plan for the remainder of life.\nQi settled, spirit naturally harmonized,\nadvancing the mysterious pearl, emerging from Kan’s position.\nGlowing crimson, faintly entering Li’s palace,\nconnecting above and below,\nilluminating the ten directions,\ngathering all realms into the heart’s ground.\n\n**Nocturne (Four Poems)**\nEarth, water, fire, wind—the four great elements,\nfor you, a hundred harms arise.\nLet each depart in its own way,\nand my Dharma-body becomes light and

toward the river homeland,\nscattered auspices drift like duckweed, nearly touching.\n\nGrief and resentment,\ngrief and resentment—\na single leaf of wind-sail carries me lightly away.\n\nAgain,\n\nFacing the southern bank of the green stream,\nendless flowing water and falling blossoms.\nTurning my head through the mist of fine weather,\nmy Dao-companions fade from sight.\n\nA long sigh,\na long sigh—\na single leaf of wind-boat gently drifts.\n\nAgain,\n\nA man of integrity, resolute and pure,\nbeyond this, no distinction remains.\nThe solitary moon stands

to Jade Purity’s Primordial Beginning.\n\nAgain,\n\nVows declared, heartfelt words spoken,\nall things and sentiments cast aside in haste.\nHeart and mouth at odds,\nunable to discern truth from falsehood—\nundoing the return to the mysterious gate’s achievement.\n\nIndulging the will in wrongdoing, hard to admonish,\nkarma deep and transgressions boundless.\nIn the cold night’s wind-knives,\nghosts and spirits tug and provoke—\nhow can you not tremble with fear?\n\n**Welcoming Immortals**\n\nThe Dao is not distant,\nthough Kunlun stands between.\n\n**In Meditative Repose**\n\nIn silent sitting, the spirit probes the profound.\nWithin this cultivation—no schemes, no strategies.\nA single gleaming speck of gold,\nits jewel-bright radiance blazing in the

in welcome for the immortal guest.\n\n**Two Poems of Grotto-Heaven Spring**\n\nThe Dao’s essential immortal mechanism—\nsudden awakening alone reveals it,\nall things cast aside without remainder.\nBehold the original, single nature,\npiercing the vastness of heaven’s expanse,\nlucid as autumn’s moon,\npure as a cold spring.\nDeep and limpid, utterly still,\nnot a mote of dust clings—\nentering and exiting the Dragon Realm,\nthe Purple Palace of Heaven.\nAt the return to the origin,\nit answers to the Boundless, the Great Beginning,\nbefore the vast kalpas of time.\n\nThe Primordial One’s qi stretches unbroken,\nheedless of summer’s heat or winter’s cold,\nunchanging through all shifts.\nLike the great void—\nsubtle, dense, flawless—\nthough the three disasters and kalpas crumble,\nit remains serene as ever.\nThus in emptiness there is no birth or death,\nfrom the most ancient past,\neternally enduring, ageless.\nThe true and constant Dao—\nthis is the Mysterious Origin’s Sage Ancestor,\ntransmitted through ten thousand generations.\n\n**Again**\n\nAt the first division of creation,\na single transformation: the hidden dragon,\nthe undifferentiated splits into the Two Modes.\nBehold the sun’s essence, the moon’s marrow,\ncongealing lead, binding mercury,\nyin and yang in reversal,\ntiger leaping, dragon soaring.\nThe hexagrams of Pi and Tai alternate,\nZhun and Meng return—\nthe *Yi*’s images emerge from Kan and Li.\nPure and refined,\nit illumines the ignorant and the fledgling,\ntransmuting them into radiant clarity.\n\nHow vast and wondrous, the supreme Dao!\nYet who would turn their heart back to the old gate?\nThe earth’s great turtle bears aloft the vault of heaven,\nwhere towering peaks stand proud,\na solitary moon casts its limpid glow.\nSeas stilled, skies empty,\nno flying dust intrudes—\nthe crisp qi, the spirit’s clarity, the marvelous mechanism.\nThe path to the true opens,\nthe mortal frame exchanged for one resplendent,\nriding the wind to return.\n\n**Three Poems to \"Court of Blossoms\"**\n\nAmong the ten thousand things,\nhumankind is most noble,\nholding within a single spark of the subtle and refined.\nMost numinous, most sagely—\nwho in daily use perceives it?\nHidden or manifest, born or extinguished, flowing with change,\nsquare or round, bending or straight—all meet the moment.\nFrom its transformations,\nwhether walking, dwelling, sitting, or lying,\nmovement and stillness ever attend.\n\nSuddenly,\nlight suffuses the body—\nthe True Person appears,\nclad in a different majesty.\nJade hairpins and vermilion slippers,\nsashes of jade pendants and brocade tassels.\nA jeweled canopy, a phoenix chariot,\nclouds of jade trailing,\nthe graceful True Consort.\nImmortal music plays,\ngolden lads bear the goblets—\ndrunk as mud, they revel.\n\n**Again**\n\nShedding the gross for the splendid,\nreturning to simplicity, restoring antiquity,\nthe root-source, once turbid, slowly clears.\n\nHumble and modest, dwelling in depth,\nwhat is worn need not be new to endure.\nContentment knows neither glory nor shame,\nserene in mastery—neither hasty nor light.\nDo you yet understand?\nExistence and extinction, gain and loss,\nadvance and retreat—all like waxing and waning.\nThus,\nwholly may the Dao be preserved:\nfrom the heart, dross is cast out;\nfrom the eyes, nails are drawn.\nDim pupils brighten like feathers in flight,\nthe empty valley shines in vast clarity.\nThree qi intermingle in dense harmony—\npure yang descends,\nilluminating form, liberating mind.\nCondensing, returning to the source,\nwind stills, waves settle,\nbright moon gilds the earth and seas.\n\n**Again**\n\nJade dust and numinous frost,\ncloud essence in secluded purity—\nthe Three Treasures of primal chaos hold fullness.\nFullness, then return—\nsun and moon pierce Kunming’s depths.\n□ grasps the realm of round penetration,\nqi descends in misty profusion,\nheavenly treasures bloom as sacred infants.\nWithin this mystery,\nfive peaks send flying snow,\none dwells in the crystal city.\nDivine jade opens the ancient path,\nspirit winds shift with ease—\nwho guards the distant years?\nI ponder my long flow, enduring vision,\nthe profound verses ever sincere.\nSecretly transmitted elixir must transform the body;\nfrom this, ascend to wander Huaqing’s halls.\nGolden lads summon—\nin the Jade Dawn Palace,\nthe self belongs to the Lesser Weaving Star.\n\n---\n\n**Four Western River Moons**\n\nStill and solitary, the thatched hut stands free,\nsteep peaks seal mist and rosy clouds.\nBeyond the sunlit pavilion, a single branch slants—\nawaiting guests with clear tea and quiet words.\nSilent sitting, effortless in purity,\nnot a speck of dust or sand clings.\nThe heart’s terrace, white as the lotus,\never abides beneath the Western River Moon.\n\n**Again**\n\nTo pore over a thousand scriptures is still too little;\nto awaken to a single word is yet too much.\n\nWithin the cauldron of Great Void, refine the harmonious and tranquil.\nNurtured thus, a myriad of dark pearls coalesce.\nFollowing principle, roam directly through the jeweled realm;\non the path of profound emptiness, traverse the starry river.\nTen thousand spirits gather, piercing the misty veil—\nin oneness, no division of self and other.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\nThe Lesser Reclusion admits not a speck of dust;\nthe Great Permeation fills all directions.\nMerged with the numinous expanse, boundless and vast—\none nature grasps the great image.\nWithin fire, white snow is forged;\nin water, the crimson sun is nurtured.\nThe jade infant, wondrously transformed, rides phoenix and simurgh,\nsoaring into the moon above the Western River.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\nUnwilling to seek within the self,\nstubbornly grasping outward in ceaseless pursuit.\nClinging to lesser arts of side doors, long mired in delusion—\nsuch folk are hard to save.\nLike one who guards a tree awaiting a hare,\nhow much better to brave the snow astride an ox.\nIn the land of Hua Xu, roam at will—\nat midnight, turn night back to day.\n\n---\n\n**Three Long Thoughts on Immortality**\n\nSubtle within the profound—\nmercury and lead.\nAdvance the fire, laboring as the cauldron seethes and boils.\nSpirit-sand, round in every grain.\nInner work complete,\nouter ascent to immortality.\nDivine water flows deep, reversing course to ascend the heavens—\nlightly borne on a single lotus leaf.\n\n---\n\n**Again**\nThe Dao is level and smooth.\n\n**Nature’s Subtle Dependence**\n\nNature leans on the elusive—\nwater and fire conjoin, the low and the high.\nYin and yang meet in their own time.\nUse the Flowery Pond,\nbathe the jade-like flesh.\nA radiant child soars beyond the heavens—\ndivine light illumines the Purple Tenuity.\n\n**Again**\n\nMoonlight Pool,\nbathe the sacred tortoise.\nFrom its mouth, auspicious clouds transform to jade rainbows—\nspiritual radiance gleams in the Purple Tenuity.\n\nCrimson robes gleam,\nveiling skin like ice.\nGraceful, it drifts on the wind beyond the heavens—\nthe Jasper Palace awaits its destined hour.\n\n**Two Boating Songs**\n\nSharp as refined essence at night’s end,\nyang’s flame and luminous splendor dispel evil.\nThe jeweled *Brahmā* crystal pierces the void with its gaze.\nThe cinnabar phoenix flourishes—\nten thousand spirits bow in submission.\nThe wondrous work of non-action unfolds naturally.\nWeave the horned net without error.\nWhere are my companions?\nNone remain.\nI speak to the clear wind and bright moon—\nthey are mine.\n\n**Again**\n\nFrom the primal depths, the mind refines to its end.\nThe boundless *wangxiang* governs good and evil.\nIts dark scrutiny is impartial, never missing or erring.\nTruth and falsehood—\nall\n\n**Ten Odes on the Skull by Gu Shehou Shanyuan**\n\n**The Skull Is Not**\nThe skull is not, the skull is not—\na heap of white bones

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Clarity Great Mystery Collection**\n\n**Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Great Mystery Collection*\n**Ten fascicles.** Authored by Jin Hou Shanyuan.\n**Source text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, Great Mystery Section.\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Clarity Great Mystery Collection, Fascicle One*\n**By Hou Shanyuan of Gushe**\n\n#### **Chapter One: On the Primordial Transformation of Supreme Clarity**\nThe Primordial Transformation of Supreme Clarity unfolds in harmonious splendor, revealing the celestial chart.\nThat which precedes all things is the Dao.\nThat which ends only to begin anew is nature.\nWhen loyalty does not adhere to sectarianism, the countenance of one who embodies virtue becomes serene and profound—his temples and beard like jade set amidst luminous clarity, radiant with subtle grace.\nDelighting in the melody of harmonious winds, he intones the dawn of primordial essence. Unfettered in flight, he roams the paths of the Dao.\nThe Primordial Ancestor is vast yet without exterior, minute yet without interior; above, round like heaven; below, square like earth. In form and name, it inwardly unfolds the intermingling qi.\nBound by the east’s emergence and the west’s descent, the sun and moon rise and set.\nThe radiance of great transformation illumines all—mind and matter congeal in brilliance, none fail to respond to its command.\n\n#### **Chapter Two: The Path of Flourishing Virtue**\nThe path of flourishing virtue lies in its constant application.\nBehold the great image: the great image is formless. To give it form is to dazzle the eye, yet naturally its light overflows without limit.\nThus, even one as keen-sighted as Li Lou cannot attest to true wisdom.\nListen to the great sound: the great sound is soundless. To give it sound is to confuse the ear, yet naturally it harmonizes without direction.\nThus, even one as keen-eared as Shi Kuang cannot attest to true hearing.\nUtmost hearing, utmost wisdom, utmost adaptability, utmost penetration—all are bestowed within the Dao of the primordial and the level.\n\n#### **Chapter Three: Manifesting Things and Exhausting Principles**\nTo manifest things and exhaust principles is to embody stillness and receptivity.\nChew and shift the mysterious vision; let jade-like radiance and crimson essence flow forth.\nIn clarity, it conceals itself in the intervals; in life, it subdues decline.\nThe mechanism of fortune releases sorrow, attaining constancy; the pattern of pure extension severs the gate of calamity.\n\n#### **Chapter Four: Harmonizing with the Dao and Ascending to Perfection**\nTo harmonize with the Dao and ascend to perfection is to achieve meritorious virtue.\nMovement within the Three Realms is unobstructed only when no barriers exist.\nFirst: things follow transformation—this is the essence of the Dao. Responding and manifesting form is the function of spirit. To employ the useless is the ultimate use.\nSecond: the mechanism confronts the myriad forms, lifting the veils of ignorance. Shining yet not dazzling—this is the colorless. The color of the colorless is the ultimate color.\nThird: the tally of emptiness is not possession; clinging to possession is not emptiness. The emptiness of non-emptiness is called true emptiness.\nComprehending these in unity transcends all bounds.\n\n#### **Chapter Five: Fortifying Nature and Non-Birth**\nTo fortify nature and embrace non-birth is to delight in transformation. Responding with virtue ensures a life without obstruction.\nExternal meditation is expansive and relaxed; in vast emptiness and stillness, the human Dao merges with the celestial Dao.\nBreath harmonizes and fuses; the intermingling qi responds to signs. In luminous purity, the primordial qi and the vital qi connect.\nGaze fixed in auspicious concentration, the numinous bird descends as an omen; the two luminaries exchange radiance—pupil and sun-moon unite their brightness.\nThus, the Six Caverns of Flying Mystery and the wondrous transformations of the Three Palaces divide into the nine qi, converging into the One True.\nThe transformations of the One True lie in the action of non-action.\n\n#### **Chapter Six: On Gain and Loss**\nGain and loss differ in their application.\nTo gain is to treasure essence, cherish qi, preserve life, and nurture spirit—embracing the Dao and holding fast to virtue.\nTo lose is to indulge in greed and desire, mind in chaos and heart in desolation—forgetting one’s root and concealing one’s truth.\nTo penetrate the mystery and dispel falsehood, to invigorate numinous power and awaken wisdom, is to achieve the merit of resolute advancement.\n\n#### **Chapter Seven: Gathering Intent and Refining Thought**\nTo gather intent and refine thought is to attain joyful tranquility.\nWithin, the jade casket appears, resembling the visage of an infant.\nThe constancy of governing principle and the harmony of natural ease ensure no transgressions; the upright nature keenly senses the mechanism.\nTo silence it is not to shatter the eye but to heighten desire.\nTo model it is not to grind the inkstone but to strengthen vigilance.\nThe transformations of the inner pattern—unbounded and without fixed direction—lie in the action of non-transforming transformation.\n\n#### **Chapter Eight: The Dao’s Vast Embrace**\nThe Dao’s vast embrace extends without limit.\nAbove, it covers without bound, upholding the celestial net. Heaven’s roundness establishes its image; sun, moon, and stars descend. Their light hangs day and night, numinous and penetrating—none fail to align with its brightness.\nBelow, it governs without bound, grasping earth’s yielding nature. Earth’s squareness establishes its image; mountains and valleys fill and empty. Following the seasons, they release transformation—all things arise and are completed within it.\nUtmost vastness, utmost greatness—greatness encompasses all. Utmost subtlety, utmost minuteness—minuteness enters all. To extend it is to blend principles; to unify mechanisms is to harmonize all without exception.\n\n#### **Chapter Nine: The Dao Beyond Dao**\nThe Dao beyond Dao exists yet is forgotten. Following principle’s constancy, forgetting things yet preserving truth—this is how one attains its measure.\nResponding to things while forgetting the mind, abandoning principle’s constancy, preserving desire yet losing one’s root—this is how one invites inquiry.\nThe wise discern this distinction. Such is the seeing beyond sight—this is true seeing. The response beyond response—this is true response.\nTo respond without imposing transformation is to pervade the boundless Dao.\n\n#### **Chapter Ten: The Path of Inner Stillness**\nThe path of inner stillness knows the way to keen responsiveness.\nStillness governs movement; uprightness governs deviation.\nThe law of compliance and change fortifies the substance, unifying the casket. The movement of preserving the level initiates the constancy of abundance.\n\n#### **Chapter Eleven: The All-Transforming**\nTo be all-transforming is to attain great penetration.\nReceiving streams without overflowing—this is the Dao’s abyss.\nCongealing emptiness without filling—this is the Dao’s profundity.\nBlending qi without excess—this is the Dao’s vastness.\nPresent in court yet unseen—this is the Dao’s constancy.\nLingering in obscurity yet undimmed—this is the Dao’s principle.",

the movement of ascent and descent was determined by floating and sinking.\nHeaven and earth expanded in their covering and bearing, the sun and moon took form in their illumination, the myriad things received life and completion.\nThrough communication and transformation, it becomes supremely spiritual—nothing it cannot do, nowhere it does not reach.\nCalled to respond to its substance, employ its truth, establish its image, attain its spirit, and ride its governance and trust—this is how one may perfect sagely achievement.\n\n**Second Chapter: The Dao’s Utmost Nonbeing**\n\nThe Dao’s utmost nonbeing becomes its utmost being.\nBeing is the transformation of spirit; nonbeing is the extremity of stillness.\nThe path of movement and stillness is the image of celestial patterns and the form of earthly principles.\nThe changes of the central breath: if preserved, its numen endures to the point of destiny; if violated, its essence scatters to the point of nature.\nCalled resplendent yet without trace, released yet responsive—this is the full embodiment of yang.\nEmbodying it fully is merging with its truth; possessing all things is burdening the self.\nWhen the self is not imperiled, it emerges beyond heaven and earth—peerless indeed!\n\n**Third Chapter: The Eon of Constant Principles**\n\nIn the eon of constant principles, one relies on feathers to know direction.\nThose who labor in transformation externally seal it, internally unfold it.\nGovernance through stubbornness descends; descent through opposition sinks.\nCalled round and molded: internally enclosed, externally opened, governance through harmony ascends, ascent through regulation floats.\nThe communication of ascent, the preservation of descent, the breath of the center—without loftiness and clarity, who could attain this?\n\n**Fourth Chapter: The Governance of Primordial Qi**\n\nThe governance of primordial qi divides and transforms to generate form.\nEstablishing its substance, returning to truth, governing through the Dao—this is the utmost of the image-lord.\nCalled the origin of communication, the precursor of merging, illuminated in all directions, manifesting the principle of singular truth.\nWhat does this mean?\nGoverning through nature, reaching destiny, released and transformed, the primordial precedes heaven.\nThe system of the primordial, the ease of position—this is how one may return to the image.\n\n**Fifth Chapter: The Transformation of Primordial Unity**\n\nThe transformation of primordial unity is the division of qi and image.\nGoverning movement and stillness is the operation of floating and sinking.\nCalled: heaven and earth establish their positions, mountains and marshes connect their qi, rivers and valleys fill their voids, and the void’s attainment of its spirit.\nIs it the essence of the Dao’s transformation, or the blood vessels of virtue’s transformation?\nObserving above and below, it resembles the body of a plant, the breath of the central current, the function of a maple.\nCalled near yet unapproachable—those who approach it grow distant.\nDistant yet unneglectable—those who neglect it draw near.\nThose who attain transformation grasp the realm of near and far.\nWithout delving into traces, who can comprehend this?\n\n**Sixth Chapter: Governing the Myriad Images**\n\nGoverning the myriad images, merging into the attainment of emptiness.",

hardness and softness is the ultimate of the *Yi*’s images.\nCalled: the Dao’s transformation, virtue’s generation.\nHeaven and earth divide into clarity and turbidity; sun and moon move within their measured paths.\nThe myriad things submit to creation’s work—when transformation stirs desire, it is ever restrained.\nTo restrain it is to return to the center of the perfect Dao.\n\n**Eighth Chapter: The Sincere and Solemn Will**\n\nThe sincere and solemn will is the heart’s estimation.\nYi Yin in nature—nature’s serenity.\nIf not so, then refine and polish it, lamenting governance that remains unenlightened.\nCalled: rigid in form, indolent in nature—this is deep delusion, grave confusion.\nCalled: silently yet keenly acting, clearly yet penetratingly understanding—what does this mean?\nIt is that the sage illuminates emptiness and non-being as essence, and manifests spirit and transformation as function.\nSoaring and wheeling, dazzling as scattered gems—delivered to perfect principle, radiant at the center of heaven and earth.\n\n**Ninth Chapter: Embracing the One and Returning to Simplicity**\n\nEmbracing the One and returning to simplicity, centered in seeing the

names—when resentment and carelessness arise, it becomes a lifelong affliction.\nExhausting principle is the ease of the constant Dao.\nThe spirit of the perfect Dao is the utmost penetration of spirit, illuminating the myriad wonders and entering the gate of mystery.\n\n**Tenth Chapter: The Reality of Flourishing Virtue**\n\nThe reality of flourishing virtue does not mix with things.\nClear, empty, vast, and boundless, it responds to transformation without end.\nIts ceaseless movement is one with heaven and earth.\nWhen emotions and nature are not focused, diverging from the Dao, regret and sorrow arise, leading to calamity.\nPolishing and refining them leads to nature.\nCalled: embracing reality releases falsehood.\nSupporting the upright removes the perverse.\nCalled: like the awe of a formidable foe, emerging transformed with sudden clarity—this is the demeanor of one who watches and waits with reverence.\nIlluminating the ultimate unity, preserving profit and purity, relying

ever greater—how can one fathom it?\nThe signs of contraction and expansion, the swift glance of divine insight.\nMoving through perfect spirit is gathering in constant use.\nCalled: gathering in profound contemplation, governing through the One’s convergence.\nAttaining principle—who cannot become self-enlightened?\nCalled: departing from delusion, entering awakening, embracing virtue, guarding against peril, illuminating the resource of the perfect Dao, shining upon the world—all things follow its transformation.\nCalled: none fail to rest in their allotted place, none fail to fulfill their destiny.\nFollowing this to practice the Dao brings benefit and enrichment to all directions—is this not the beginning of the profound mystery?\n\n**Twelfth Chapter: The Dao’s Law Relies on Purity**\n\nThe Dao’s law relies on purity, profoundly still and unmoving.\nDeep as an abyss, empty as a void—dim and boundless.\nThe cycle of ascent and descent is the operation of floating and

radiance.\nNo darkness remains unillumined: it precedes Heaven’s precelestial state.\nNo transformation fails to arise: it governs the Great Simplicity of the *Yi*.\nPursue it without end, fathom it without measure.\nNameless, formless—\nYet because it is without name or form, nothing exists beyond its naming and shaping.\nThe sun’s gourd glows with ordered brilliance, circling in stillness alone.\nThe Dao of Heaven flows ceaselessly, encompassing all;\nThe mind’s pattern flows ceaselessly, resonating with all.\nComing and going, they meet—substance and essence without fixed form.\nWithout fixed form: this is called \"without form that is not form.\"\n\n**Chapter Two: Subtlety Manifests Without Extremity**\nSighs at dawn, why mimic the measures of the ancient worthies?\nLater schools, straying into side doors, cling to resentment and error.\nGreedy for advancement, recklessly hasty—who can remain serene in sorrow for the Great Dao?\nThus, the Dao does not wither or obstruct.\nMaster Rixuan observes inwardly and attains sudden awakening.\nImages without fragrance or luster—first sketching their sorrow—\nThe Perfect Dao moves from dawn to dusk without cease.\nThe key lies in curbing desires, stilling the net of cares to nurture one’s destiny.\n\n**Chapter Three: Convulsions Between Life and Death**\nConvulsions in life and death—how unlike the hidden repose of the profound!\nFrom life to death, from death to life—\nWithin the cycle of life and death, who can align with the true principle?\nNi said: The maidservant in the nether bureau, seized by Master Xuan, sought to reclaim her life.\nMaster Xuan, hearing this, laughed: \"Sever your head—how can you argue?\nWound your nature—who will perceive or hear?\"\nThe maidservant, enlightened after long reflection, suddenly rejoiced:\n\"Now I have awakened to the Dao of governing life and nurturing destiny!\"\n\n**Chapter Four: The Marsh Encompasses All Directions**\nThe marsh encompasses all directions—who grasps its governance?\nGaze into its unfathomable depths, its barriers without end.\nVague and indistinct, yet its essence remains unlost;\nInheriting without attainment, its truth remains unrealized.\nMaster Rizi, in solemn stillness, unites the primordial and the luminous.\nContemplating the chamber’s essence, awakening to clarity—\nThis is the Dao of the Three Clarities, self-attuned.\n\n**Chapter Five: The Unfolding of the Divine**\nThe bronze cauldron unfolds the divine—its questions cannot be exhausted.\nThose who grasp abundance and attain prosperity first bestow virtue;\nThose who suffer poverty and resent their fate only receive blessings belatedly.\nYet in matters of life and death, gain and loss—\nThis is one, that is another.\nMaster Xuan’s words, when applied, are never untrue.\n\n**Chapter Six: Grasping Without Perception**\nEyes that do not perceive, ears that do not comprehend—\nClarity and wisdom have their appointed time, hindered by external things.\nMaster Yixu sighs: \"Voices harmonize with sounds, things connect—\nYet in the emptiness of coming and going, how can dawn be reached?\"\nMaster Taoyi said: \"Emptiness that is not empty, things that are not things—\nAll things arise naturally, and the natural is eternally so.\nNothing fails to attain its proper state.\"\n\n**Chapter Seven: Observing the Profound and Vigorous**\nProfound and vigorous, like water shaping the abyss;\nRefined and majestic, governing with orchid-like grace.\nFollow the Dao, and the image abides in tranquil clarity;\nAbide in it, and the heart finds boundless ease.\nMaster Yushi, bright as the eye, stirs water with an icy heart—\nNot by controlling the abyss.\nProfound and unmoving, clear and penetrating—\nExchanging for emptiness and purity, who can fathom its hidden depths?\n\n**Chapter Eight: The Crown of Governance Opens the Constant**\nThe crown of governance opens the constant, attuned to transformation.\nGrasping the profound is like a fleeting glimpse of Yan Hui’s thought—\nAwakening and weariness merge with the mysterious, all relying on its truth.\nMaster Yuanguan: \"Perfect clarity attains brightness—brightness in great simplicity.\nVast and luminous in supreme eloquence—eloquence without extremity.\"\nMaster Xuanyang said: \"Merging and flowing with light,

To awaken to it is to shed the husk and nurture essence, spirit-light shining within, emptiness pure and flawless—clouds recede, the sky gleams; mist disperses, the sun shines. The radiance of the Great Clarity is revealed, the supreme real unveiled in leisure.\n\nPrimal virtue governs all; the Dao obstructs nothing.\nCommuning with spirits, the images shift;\nthe constellations align with their signs.\nIn serene and wondrous transformation,\none ascends the ladder of mystery to the Jade Dawn Palace.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe wondrous Dao knows no bounds,\nmerged with the primordial ridge.",

      "translated_text": "**Lord Guanshe Shanyuan’s Inscription on the Golden Radiance and Jade Countenance of the Grand Beginning**\n\nThe noble person establishes conduct and practices the Dao, revering state laws and devoutly upholding the Mysterious Truth. They eradicate cravings and desires, casting aside the clamor of worldly dust. Through accumulated merit, they succor orphans and care for widows; through layered deeds, they cherish the aged and pity the poor. They look up to the virtuous without slackening, and lift the stubborn and indolent without arrogance. Harmony above and concord below—establishing virtue with compassion as its root. Inner rectitude and outward integrity—the Supreme Dao takes purity and stillness as its gate. When affairs are many, the heart finds no inner ease; when thoughts are severed, the mind does not wander outward. To halt excess and guard against loss, one must discern the moment for advance and retreat. Dwelling in peace, one contemplates peril, thereby distinguishing the principles of survival and ruin. Being and non-being mutually aid each other; movement and stillness share a single source. Stillness is called the Dao; movement is called the spirit. Silent yet responsive, moved yet without intent. Penetrating the primordial to replenish qi, fathoming the profound and luminous. Gathering the radiant yang soul in pure brilliance, transforming the yin po to reveal celestial truth. Stars congeal in mysterious illumination, the Dao releases its blossoming fragrance. Delving into the ultimate principle, one may die at dusk after hearing it at dawn. Thus, there is death yet no perishing—why envy Qi’s three sublime attainments? Not that there is no long life and enduring vision, but one does not scheme for Lin Lei’s century of years. Why not reflect: having form entails suffering, and one ultimately falls into the abyss of emptiness; only without appearance and form does one transcend beyond images. Diligently guard and cultivate merit—once merit is achieved and fame attained, shedding the mortal frame to ascend as an immortal is scarcely difficult.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe Supreme Ultimate soars vast and distant,\nits abyssal depths profoundly mysterious.\nOne qi waxes and wanes,\nand the myriad things are born.\nA numinous breeze, elegant and fair,\na luminous moon, resplendent and bright.\nMountains conceal jade treasures,\ngrasses split to reveal golden ornaments.\nNourishing an entire realm,\nmoistening and fostering a hundred streams.\nWithout intent, all is wondrous;\nwith desire, one approaches the brink.\nDeluded, one becomes a ghost;\nawakened, one ascends as an immortal.\nEmerging from the boundless,\nits image precedes heaven.\n\n**Inscription on the Pure Heart of the Grand Abyss’ Celestial Boundary**\n\nThe Dao is silent yet unceasing,\nresponding and transforming without fixed form.\nVirtue is manifest yet not forceful,\nadapting to change with proper place.\nEstablishing images reveals the principles of sun, moon, heaven, and earth;\nstabilizing hexagrams embodies the mechanisms of yin-yang, closure, and openness.\nThe fullness within *Kan*:\nin heaven, it is the moon;\nin humans, it is the ear.\nThe ear can perceive the sounds of thunder, wind, and rain—\nthis is called hearing and knowing, the mark of sageliness.\nThe emptiness within *Li*:\nin heaven, it is the sun;\nin humans, it is the eye.\nThe eye can discern the beauty of mountains, marshes, and waters—\nthis is called seeing and knowing, the mark of spirit.\nLooking up, one models oneself on heaven;\nlooking down, one models oneself on earth.\nIn profound stillness, one observes images in transformation;\nthrough transformation, one fathoms the causes of darkness and light.\nTracing beginnings and returning to endings,\none thus understands the discourse on life and death.\nThe *Book of Changes* says: \"Probe the obscure and seek the hidden,\nhook forth the deep and reach the distant.\"\nThe distant cannot be exhausted,\nthe near cannot be measured.\nVast and dim, none can know\nwhy it is so, yet so it is.\nTo diminish or expend it\ndoes not lose its essence.\nTo trust and uphold it\ndoes not reveal its form.\nHeaven endures, earth persists—\nwho can claim merit for high ascent?\nThose who uphold the Dao\nyet lack steadfast resolve,\nturning back midway—\nthis is what it means.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nEmbracing the divine splendor of the horizontal,\nemerald shadows on jade peaks.",

Vast, it encompasses heaven and earth; minute, it penetrates the finest hair. Guangchengzi said: 'The spirit’s mechanism moves within, the eyelashes fly like lead.' Thus, the spirit’s mechanism lies in the eye. When the eye’s spirit-light stirs, it resides in the eye. The secret mechanism of the nine heavens emerges from the mechanism before one’s eyes—this mechanism is the transformation of stirring movement. Summoning yang and calling forth yin, grasping the origin’s authority, emerging from clarity and entering the mysterious—thus, the two great corners of the eyes are called the brows. The green cavity ascends, connecting to the mud pill, descending to the two kidneys, which are the gates of mao and you. Kangcangzi said: 'My body harmonizes with the heart, the heart harmonizes with qi, qi harmonizes with spirit, spirit harmonizes with non-being.' There is the sound of *jieran*, the tone of *weiran*. Though distant beyond the eight wilds or near between the brows and lashes, whatever comes to me, I must know it. Yet this is not the awareness of my seven apertures and four limbs, nor the knowledge of my heart, abdomen, and six viscera—it is self-knowing alone.\"\n\nLiezi said: \"Spirit pertains to heaven’s portion, bones and frame to earth’s portion. What belongs to heaven is clear and disperses; what belongs to earth is turbid and gathers. When spirit departs from form, each returns to its truth—this is called *gui*. *Gui* means 'return,' returning to its true dwelling. The true dwelling is the realm of the Great Void.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said: \"When spirit enters its gate and bones return to their root, what remains of me?\"\nThe Most High said: \"The Dao is empty yet employed, never filling. Profound, it seems the ancestor of the myriad things. Blunting its sharpness, unraveling its tangles, harmonizing its light, merging with its dust. Vast and deep, it seems to abide—yet I know not whose child it is, as it appears before the Lord of Heaven.\"\n\nMaster Lü said: \"Gently warming the lead crucible, light penetrates the curtain.\"\nXu Shenweng’s commentary: \"The gentle warmth is the human body. At the initial union of the lead crucible, the spirit-light overflows—closing the eyes, one sees the curtain.\"\nThe eye is the eye itself.\nThus, the Master of Pointing to the Mysterious said: \"Concentrating spirit in the grotto palace, closing the eyes and lowering the curtain.\"\nThe workings of creation contend in haste—this speaks of humans employing spiritual merit to vie with creation, which is the spirit’s use by humans.\n\nMaster Haichan’s ode says:\nGently warming the lead crucible into the middle origin,\nreleasing the three lights to nurture auspicious lotuses.\nWhen the lotus naturally attains the method of sagehood,\nstep by step, the spirit-light is before the eyes.\n\nSong Qiqiu said: \"What the eye does not see, set up a bright mirror to reflect it; what the ear does not hear, set up empty qi to perceive it. Spirit is within me, seeing and hearing are yonder.\"\nHe also said: \"The bell in the ear, I myself hear it; the flower in the eye, I myself see it. My day and night are its day and night. Thus, day cannot be called bright, nor night called dark. Only the great person can equalize darkness and light.\"\nHe also said: \"Water, when utterly clear, congeals into ice that is not clear; spirit, when utterly bright, forms a body that is not bright. When ice melts, it returns to clarity; when form disperses, it returns to brightness. One who knows this death can roam the capital of the Most High.\"",

cinnabar fuses in splendor—\nOnly then does one know the Dao’s power wields divine might.\n\nThe Jasper Pool’s feast stirs strife, the sun yields its solitude,\nIts light shatters the dusty world—nothing remains.\nIn the vastness of silent emptiness, who is my companion?\nThe crystal curtain reflects the night-shining pearl.\n\nGolden brilliance, resplendent, auspicious clouds drift,\nLuminous and immaculate, flawless as jade.\nThe two spirits of purity and simplicity merge as one image—\nSuch is the wondrous skill of the Azure Micro immortal.\n\nA drop of crimson dew bathes the hibiscus,\nNourishing the numinous sprout to emerge anew.\nThe tender bud unfolds, smiling in the sun’s glow,\nPresenting you with a branch of spring in return.\n\nThe marvelous and the putrid are but empty names,\nIn this troubled world, floating and drifting, honor and disgrace startle.\nHow much better to shed the mortal coil and return to the unbegun,\nThan to be bound by the vulgar gaze that scorns the transcendent.\n\nThe three-foot dragon-spring sword rings in the night,\nSevering evil, slaying demons, it commands numinous efficacy.\nIts radiance untainted by the black serpent’s blood,\nIt soars to the Jasper Heavens, transformed into jade essence.\n\nThe two qi converge in the palace, guarding the true yang,\nYang’s light, jewel-bright, advances the mysterious frost.\nGiving birth to heaven, giving birth to earth, returning to the primal ancestor,\nAlone in the vastness, it mirrors the realm of the Celestial Emperor.\n\nIn the silent, empty hall, the door stands half-ajar,\nThe spirit-light meanders within, distinctly clear.\nThough the moon sinks into the Pool of Sun’s Mouth,\nA few stars still gleam in the wintry grove.\n\nA blazing sun rises through the sparse woods,\nIts luminous qi fills the eyes, joyfully explored.\nAwakening to the great completeness, the Dao is lucidly known,\nThe image of mystery takes flight to the azure heart of heaven.\n\nWithout, the armored dragon embraces the Water Palace,\nWithin, the metal tiger is driven into the Palace of Flame.\nRefined into a single substance, purely essence,\nIt follows the primordial wind of the Celestial Origin.\n\nSitting beyond the loom of fate, ten thousand cares forgotten,\nWithin, the heart settles, instantly cooled and clarified.\nYang congeals, substance solidifies, yin vanishes—\nUnawares, the spirit roams the Northern Emperor’s realm.\n\nThe resolute man’s will is firm and unyielding,\nReady to ascend as an immortal, he answers the celestial examination.\nHe grasps Mount Zou, shatters Kunlun’s peak,\nScattering the radiant mystery-pearl to merge with the Jade Yang.\n\nWith an empty heart, the mind at ease, he awakens to the subtle and serene,\nThere is yet a higher mechanism of the Mysterious Origin.\nRaindrops of the Valley Spirit fly to the Moon Palace,\nA sky of starry splendor moistens the lingzhi brows.\n\nLead and mercury in the golden crucible, auspicious clouds drift,\nRefined to perfection, it shines like a luminous sea-pearl.\nA single gleaming grain penetrates the dharma-realm,\nThe nine heavens’ light scatters into the pure void.\n\nThe blue dragon and white tiger mate in the crimson furnace,\nThe Mysterious Female and cinnabar phoenix freely inhale and exhale.\nFlaming brilliance of the samadhi fire,\nLucidly illuminating the old paths of darkness.\n\nThe two spirits merge in radiance at the center,\nEach drop, cool and clear, blends into the Jade Yang.\nThe mysterious image, resplendent, veils the Jasper Gate,\nThe Jade Tower’s deep chambers are locked within azure cloud-chambers.\n\nLeisurely riding a white deer to the Jasper Pool,\nAwaiting entry to the Moon Palace to pluck the cassia branch.\n\nThe Great Brahma, towering, is but an image,\nYet it shifts the stars’ radiance to moisten the lingzhi brows.\nThe Treasure-Essence Youth plucks the moonflower,\nFlames advance, the flying soul releases purple auroras.\n\nReversing the current beyond the Milky Way,\nNo need for misty waves to cradle the numinous elixir.\nThe virtuous elder’s demeanor is foolish,\nWithin, bloodless, his flesh becomes ice.\nSerenely awakened, he returns to the primal image,\nAscending to the Central Heaven to pay homage at the Purple Tenuity.\n\nBrahma-qi lightly drifts, merging with the Emperor’s origin,\nThe cinnabar’s light, resplendent, shines through the mystery.\nThe Jade Dawn requires no thatched-hut effort,\nInstantly, the empty hurricane grasps the plain sky.\n\nVast and boundless, the ten thousand images arise anew,\nThe Celestial Origin’s single qi blends with the pure void.\nThe Mysterious Yang’s universal sovereign contains the numinous essence,\nAll transforms without remainder into five-colored pearls.\n\nBlack mercury and red lead transmute into jade essence,\nMoistening the brows with golden splendor, illuminating the mysterious essence.\nIn the wintry grove, the sacred cassia and numinous cinnabar congeal,\nRough jade scatters, scattering auspicious stars.\n\nGrasping firmly, preserving the spirit, entering the wondrous mechanism,\nA man’s single-minded resolve never wavers.\nRefining the Celestial Crucible, the heart-pearl bursts forth,\nThe snow-capped youth treads the Jade Stream.\n\nBlack waters and crimson auroras illuminate the azure sky,\nThe blue dragon and white tiger enter the abyss of perception.\nThey swallow the sea-bottom’s numinous turtle marrow,\nAdvancing the armor-clad black pearl, round and gleaming.\n\nThe arrayed tripods’ souls wander, merging with the Great Azure,\nThe azure vault crackles, flames soaring.\nThe Three Origins are securely sealed, returning to the Qian image,\nThe vast secret, boundless, enters the great square.\n\nAuspicious qi and propitious clouds fill the eyes,\nA sky of true refinement transforms the cinnabar infant.\nThe numinous wind does not follow the willow floss away,\nIt flies into the Palace of Flame to accompany the morning star.\n\nEmerging from the Yang Pass, he travels the old road,\nListening freely, gazing in all directions.\nThe essence-jewel is not made to occupy mud and dust,\nIt pierces the long sky, a single point of clarity.\n\nThe primordial current of chaos, Brahma-qi ascends,\nThe sun of celestial wisdom shines most distinctly.\nIn stillness, a single mirror—by whose power?\nThe mysterious pearl descends, dazzling the Great Clarity.\n\nHeavenly wind and sea-sun radiate in splendor,\nAbove and below, molten gold scatters jewel-crystals.\nKnocking on the Dao, vast and luminous,\nShifting the spirit’s radiance, the eyes awaken.\n\nBrahma-qi circulates, blending the hundred rivers,\nA single glance from the majestic eyes ripples the numinous mist.\nPillowing on cloudy mountains, dreaming the Huaxu dream,\nNot desiring to slumber in the Chang’an marketplace.\n\nThe red sun half-embraces the emerald mountains,\nA wisp of azure mist lightly veils the water’s gleam.\nThe brocade-scaled fish are not hooked, returning empty-handed—\nWhat use is a thousand-foot silk line?\n\nBreaking through the sea-gate to seek the formless,\nPiercing the empty valley to retrieve the mysterious pearl.\nThe celestial court’s supreme treasure—who is worthy to receive it?\nI tell it to the great men of the world.\n\nA drunken man asks, “Forty springs have passed,”\nSuddenly awakened, he finds himself in a dream.\nForgetting form, there is naturally a path through the heavens,\nAscending to the Southern Palace, ranked among the jade stars.\n\nIn the silent, empty hall, the door stands half-closed,\nGreen peaches and red apricots emerge from the sparse fence.\nBeyond the southern window, a pillow in the spring breeze—\nNot like Zhuang Zhou’s butterfly dream.\n\nThe mist at the granary’s corner disperses, the red sun gleams,\nThe mist at the river’s edge clears, the azure sky shines.\nThe carefree scholar, his heart unburdened,\nThe snow-capped transcendent, his eyes bright.\n\nLast night, sitting alone as the night deepened,\nGuarding the inner elixir furnace, the four limbs at ease.\nNo wonder the sparse shadows beyond the curtain are white—\nThe moonflower visits, illuminating the jade.\n\nThe Qian Origin and Great Simplicity wondrously embrace the vast,\nRefining the substance, flowing gold, purple qi arises.\nAt home, the auspicious youth smiles in the sun’s glow,\nFor whom does the sky’s scenery shine?",

      "translated_text": "The vermilion gate opens to wondrous revelation, the azure grotto unfolds—\nFive numinous immortals roam at will.\nDragon smoke coils into a thousand poems,\nAmber cups brim with a hundred draughts.\n\nIn fleeting trance, the soul wanders the Great One’s abode,\nClouds and mist swirl like flying dragons and serpents.\nSince the descent of celestial omens, who in the world has known?\nTen thousand drops of flowing essence merge with the splendor of things.\n\nFar reaching to the Jasper Heavens, yet near as one’s brows,\nThe image bears celestial substance, wondrously pure and subtle.\nOnce I traced the traces back to the Primordial Ancestor,\nThe vast Brahman void transformed into jade and rainbow.\n\nThough the body withers and the heart turns to ash, the will remains steadfast,\nEmbracing the spirit, guarding the One, one attains distant years.\nLongevity need not mean lingering in the world—\nBeyond lies a realm of gourd-bound sun and moon.\n\nHow can an earthen cauldron boil the golden elixir to froth?\nThe bottomless stone pool blends the ceaseless flow.\nHeaven-shaking waves surge past Ox and Dipper,\nAlone I steer a single-leaf skiff through the void.\n\nThe deluded, benighted child curls inward,\nYet the sea’s eye gazes outward, bright and clear.\nWandering the cinnabar heavens, the essence glistens,\nAzure pupils faintly perceive the pale light’s chill.\n\nSleeping at night and stirring at dawn, both states forgotten,\nGradually the harmonious qi rises above and below.\nThe horn of dawn half-contains the gleaming red sun,\nA range of brow-like mountains clears the azure sky.\n\nLast night at the third watch, the moonlight was fresh,\nThe old path to the Jade Empyrean remained unchanged.\nOpening wide my gaze across a thousand miles,\nAll phenomena arise from the single round mirror.\n\nAuspicious cinnabar light scatters, illuminating the azure void,\nLead’s radiance, speck by speck, moistens the lingzhi brows.\nThe numinous youth, inclined toward the Yang abode,\nYet follows the phoenix carriage to the phoenix tower in flight.\n\nBinding mercury, congealing lead, refining jade and rainbow,\nThe flesh transforms, bloodless, the countenance star-like.\nWith a single transcendent leap, ascending to heaven,\nThe imperial throne relies on the true wind and the Dao’s mighty power.\n\nAll gloom before the eyes transforms into Yang,\nWithin the cinnabar tripod, lead frost emerges.\nThe black serpent inverts to drink the blue dragon’s blood,\nThe image, formless, spits forth light in the night.\n\nFrom time immemorial, all has been guest dust—\nWhat thing constitutes the celestial truth?\nDisciples toil in vain with their visits,\nSeeking to see the present, yet failing to see the man.\n\nWaves rise on Kun Mountain, stirring the Jasper Pool,\nBlowing open jade flowers that scatter everywhere.\nThe vast void shimmers with auspicious hues,\nEssence flows forth, dispersing through the Nine Purities.\n\nEarthly po, heavenly po, sun and moon essence,\nTrue Yang blazes resplendently bright.\nWithin the swirling divine wind, the Three Qi return,\nThrice reborn, a single star revives.\n\nTo refine and preserve, first master the six emotions,\nWith a start, guard simplicity—thus the Dao is born.\nWho knows the flavor of Feather Mountain’s wind?\nClouds depart, heartless, yet the moon shines clear.\n\nThe Three Origins’ divine radiance, qi unbroken,\nFive-colored jasper blossoms illuminate the Nine Heavens.\nHeavenly omens merge into the True One’s image,\nThe mysterious image soars into the Great Clarity’s abyss.\n\nThe fiery furnace blazes, flames soaring,\nThe seething tripod surges with jade nectar.\nThe elixir’s fortune fills the eyes with splendor,\nMyriad spirits harmonize, naturally pure and cool.\n\nNorth’s darkness and South’s cinnabar each have their time,\nThe two spirits swiftly grasp heaven’s mechanism.\nTogether they devise to repay the chaos of death,\nSevenfold return, perfect communion, transcending old hearsay.\n\nThick mists and demonic vapors pierce the gall with chill,\nIn the dark, the black egg emerges from the mud pill.\nA divine wind sweeps through the celestial strife,\nThe shadow-bearing light leaves no bloodstains.\n\nThe grotto’s true radiance merges with the pure void,\nThe resplendent golden elixir shines through the nine thoroughfares.\nHaving united the fetal spirit into one body,\nWithin it contains the numinous essence, birthing the mysterious pearl.\n\nLayer upon layer of thin mist clears the cinnabar empyrean,\nThe cinnabar empyrean’s path is not distant.\nWhere earth meets heaven amid fragrant grasses,\nA divine wind returns, transforming jade and lingzhi sprouts.\n\nThe stainless pure void, daily renewed,\nIlluminates the heavenly summit, startling the soul.\nSuddenly, unawares, form is forgotten,\nFar off, striking the numinous Yang, passing the sea gate.\n\nThe Dao’s mystery is mystery upon mystery,\nMysteriously pervading, touching the realm before birth.\nThe cinnabar phoenix blows through the shooting-star eyes,\nFlying into the Flourishing Yang and Great Unity’s heaven.\n\nA wisp of rosy mist pierces the purple haze,\nYu’s remnant wind stills, grasses lush.\nThe sun’s soul foresees the numinous splendor,\nBreaking through the cinnabar mound to reveal the sky.\n\nLeaning on a pine, I ascend to gaze at Jade Flower Peak,\nTowering, tier upon tier, hundreds of folds.\nMoon’s po and sun’s hun inquire of each other,\nBetween them, above and below, the youthful countenance.\n\nThe toad’s radiance, bright and clear, pours into the Silver River,\nIlluminating the cosmos with its vast, luminous qi.\nRefining the po, enhancing the po, clarifying the Great Simplicity,\nTransforming into immortals who ascend heaven’s net.\n\nNorthward, the misty waters dark and deep,\nPouring into the fiery palace of the Red Emperor’s realm.\nThus the waves calm, the dragon sleeps soundly,\nBlack lead wholly transforms into purple gold frost.\n\nThe dragon’s abyss in the watery realm reflects the sea pearl,\nIn the night’s darkness, the world’s mirror gleams like jade lard.\nThe carefree immortal’s twin pupils shine,\nJust as the moon goddess ascends the Azure Capital.\n\nPhoenix marrow and dragon fat perfume the land,\nBrilliantly congealing, illuminating the encircling eyes.\nBeyond the clear pupils, the spirit’s hues divide,\nA single golden elixir shines in the Great Clarity.\n\nWithin the profound, deeper mysteries lie,\nBeyond the heavens, more heavens arise.\nGazing upward, ever more distant, boundless,\nUnawares, the soul flies beyond the Image Lord.\n\nSilent and dim, the Dao incomplete,\nSplitting open the chaos to reveal the double mystery.\nNaturally mastering the Nine and Five, concealing all functions,\nThe soul soars, distant, through the eighteen heavens.\n\nThe Dao of nature is originally formless,\nClinging to this formlessness is but a borrowed name.\nRecognize the single wheel of crystal sun,\nThrough the mysterious, one begins to perceive the Great Void’s clarity.\n\nThe Great Mystery’s vast grotto conceals the numinous treasure,\nThe Supreme’s emptiness hides the inner truth.\nTo know what the original truth is—\nNot spirit, yet spirit, therefore spirit.\n\nI originally idly chant poems of heaven,\nDo not confuse them with inferior methods in wild guesses.\nTo you, I point directly to the path of cultivating truth—\nThe Dao connects to the numinous pupils, near as your brows.\n\nParting the cold mist to reveal the azure vault,\nThe sea’s moon clears the sky, all phenomena interpenetrate.\nStanding alone in the vast, who is my match?\nThe cinnabar infant wanders, borne by the heavenly wind.\n\nThe divine wind, ceaseless, breaks through the cloud blossoms,\nWashing the frosty heavens, the atmosphere pure.\nOnly then does the jade peak’s solitary moon gleam,\nPiercing the mysterious tripod, suddenly awakening.\n\nIn former years, benighted, the heart’s source was closed,\nToday, the Dao’s eye opens, clear and bright.\nDelighted to see the azure sky like a jade table,\nThe twin millstones grind through the white cloud banks.\n\nTurning the mysterious pass, the qi’s aspect returns,\nThe numinous crow flies past, the azure heavens open.",

      "translated_text": "A single truth suddenly illumines both eyes bright,\nRecognize the morning sun’s precious mirror-platform.\nOne millstone refines the sun’s light through the cosmos,\nTwo points of primordial essence radiate the valley spirit.\n\nThe precious mirror enhances the numinous, Heavenly Water flourishes,\nJade blossoms bloom across the Jade Capital’s spring.\nThe Jade Clarity, Primordial Beginning, Great Lofty Heaven—\nIts majestic qi emerges before the Emperor’s advent.\n\nWithin the Purple Tenuity’s golden gates it unfolds,\nThe cinnabar infant wanders, countenance resplendent.\nThe sun-essence youth appears luminous,\nFeathered canopy and jade blossoms veil the purple mist.\n\nThereby attaining the mysterious yang to open the precious mirror,\nThe jade star flies into the Grand Clarity’s abyss.\nTwin blades of frost-edged swords gleam on Mount Taihua,\nCleaving the heavens’ crown to admit dragon-sand.\n\nTen thousand points of cinnabar yang, pure and refined,\nAll belong to the Primordial Lord’s Purple Mansion.\nVast qi and harmonizing wind penetrate the azure window,\nSuddenly worldly traces merge with true yang.\n\nIn profound unity, all scheming ceases,\nResponsibility and mutual radiance dispel ghosts of themselves.\nGolden splendor clear, jade blossoms fly,\nCinnabar flowers flourish, purple clouds return.\n\nTwin lads gather herbs beyond the cold stream,\nWhether attained or not—who can know?\nDivine work has its method to refine the elixir knife,\nThe lead crucible gently warmed by subtle fire.\n\nNo need for breath or forceful effort,\nThe flame furnace naturally bears snowflake blossoms.\nWashing away worldly dust, ten thousand cares settle,\nShifting spirit into the sea to transform the cinnabar infant.\n\nThe Hua-Yuan immortal calls out in greeting,\nLaughing, pointing toward the jade capital deep in clouds.\nTwin phoenixes welcome the immortal into emerald haze,\nPurple mist softly rises, illuminating crimson robes.\n\nWhere jade towers stir fragrant winds,\nGolden flowers are blown aloft in flight.\nShifting spirit, stepping alone into the pure void,\nLuminous purity of the void leaves no speck of dust.\n\nExchanging the drill for the agate casket, essence refines day by day,\nPiercing the heart’s crucible to illumine the ice-pot.\nWithin, the true nature is clear; without, the mysterious is communicated,\nOnly when the mysterious illuminates the yang pass does the Dao begin.\n\nInner and outer awaken, jade-like clarity resplendent,\nIntertwined radiance flies upward to Jade Capital Mountain.\nPenetrating insight reveals the numinous jade, phenomena dissolve,\nThe primordial chaos directly flourishes, seizing the heavenly wind.\n\nA single stream from Kunlun’s western waters\nPours into the icy abyss ten thousand fathoms deep.\nReleasing a single point of primordial chaos’ essence,\nIt aids the dark yin and yang, illuminating the unseen.\n\nWere it not the jade infant wandering the Purple Mansion,\nHow could the numinous palace encounter the Three Stars?\nCleaving open chaos to reveal dragon-light,\nEntering and exiting vermilion gates to receive cassia frost.\n\nThereby attaining the five spirits to clarify the Grand Simplicity,\nA single grain of golden elixir seizes heaven’s constancy.\nThe cinnabar phoenix toils, descending cassia branches,\nThe Jade Pool’s waters are sipped all day.\n\nReleased from the dual gates’ intent,\nA single transformation of the mysterious pearl ascends the Great Lofty.\nNuminous sound emerges from the distant and obscure,\nA waft of fragrant wind enters the dream, clear.\n\nExpounding the twin gates to connect the ancient Dao,\nIn the Jade Empyrean, one meets the Lesser Micro Star.\nScreening away worldly dust, ten thousand affairs vanish,\nOnly in nothingness is the primordial chaos pearl seen.\n\nWhere does the vanished form, altered image return?\nSoftly, following the wind, it ascends the Jade Capital.\nGazing upward, the mysterious is revealed in the azure realm,\nFlowing bells cast fire into the center.\n\nA single point of cavernous origin, the heavenly wind flourishes,\nBenefiting my three yin to transform into nine yang.\nCultivation requires exerting deadly effort,\nExchanging substance to retain the true, embodying the Great Nothingness.\n\nThe waning soul benefits the spirit in the golden banquet hall,\nThe cavernous mysterious returns to illumine the Jade Clarity Capital.\nJasper plum blossoms first unfurl with the east wind,\nDrifting ethereally, connecting every place in the human realm.\n\nLike the moon goddess departing her precious palace,\nJust as the immortal enters the dragon palace.\nWho has seen the Jade Pool’s jade-spring rinse,\nWhere ringing chimes startle the soul, first shocking heaven?\n\nThe yang soul pursues the flowing bell-fire to its end,\nAt night, the Lesser Micro Star awakens the plain mysterious.\nNot desiring to scheme in the world of dust,\nThe carefree crane-nature recalls its eastern journey.\n\nAt the Dao’s gate, one realizes few know the tune,\nOnly the numinous Kunlun remains as before.\nStrolling by chance to the Southern Palace to visit the Emperor’s return,\nSword-light flies past, shattering the precious mountain.\n\nAlas for the countless eyes of mortals,\nWho do not recognize Penglai’s board or Yuan’s go-between.\nHeaven’s concealment, the true wind’s brilliance,\nWithin, it enfolds dragon-light, flying over the sea.\n\nThe golden cavern’s beauty, triple-layered mist,\nThe jade spirit’s grace, the twofold patterns’ harmony.\nA single wheel of bright moon illumines the pure subtle,\nThe water realm’s divine forest reflects the jade stream.\n\nBracing air pierces the bones with crystalline clarity,\nThe Milky Way still bathes its icy flesh.\nIn the zhi-hall, feathered guests discuss the true mechanism,\nDirectly pointing to the jade heavens, the path unobscured.\n\nClear eyes unclouded by veiling mists,\nIn the Jade Empyrean’s banquet, one’s countenance shines like a star.\nSun and moon revolve, heaven and earth gleam,\nDivine light intertwines, the Great Void brightens.\n\nThose who attain this observe its wonders,\nEasily meeting the heavenly wind to fill the realm with purity.\nTransforming customs, shifting winds to emerge from worldly passions,\nA single point of cool constancy, profoundly clear.\n\nContaining light, silently merging with heaven’s substance,\nOnly then does one trust the divine work, the Dao’s awakening.\nCleaving open chaos to reveal the golden crow’s nest,\nStriking through Kunlun’s ridge to the jade hare’s gate.\n\nNo need for twin pupils to illumine the dharma-realm,\nThus a single eye suffices to illumine heaven and earth.\nThe Grand Mystery pure, moon blossoms fly,\nThe Limitless radiant, moon essence returns.\n\nOrchids and zhi flourish by the jade stream,\nWho knows the divine work’s gathering?\nDivine skill is reaped—who can know?\n\n**Five-Character Verse**\n\nShattering Kunlun’s peak,\nTrue essence enters the distant obscure.\nA single furnace of phoenix marrow,\nTwo crucibles of red dragon essence.\n\nFive mountains’ auspicious clouds arise,\nThree peaks’ auspicious qi is born.\nOpening the heavenly eye to illumine,\nThe cosmos expands, clear and bright.\n\nTigers roar, wind stirs the ravine,\nDragons chant, mist fills the horizon.\nAuspiciousness floats, the pure realm scatters,\nFlames blaze, the azure heavens open.\n\nA single horse enters the gold mine,\nTwin wheels grind the jade mounds.\nThe profound image seeks only me,\nIntent remains on Mount Tiantai.\n\nThe silver toad emerges from the plain forest,\nDescending to cover the Qujiang’s heart.\nBright, bright star river fades,\nClear, clear the sea of awakening deepens.\n\nA single roar of the mighty tiger,\nTen thousand ravines’ female dragons chant.\nStartled, the numinous pupils glance,\nIntertwined radiance, jade questions gold.\n\nSitting in solitude, freely roaming,\nAshen, things arise of themselves.\nAfter the ninth of the scorching season,\nAt noon, striking the third watch.\n\nThe wooden horse emerges from fire,\nThe clay ox treads beneath the water.\nUnknowing the inverted intent,\nHaving eyes, yet blind as can be.\n\nThe Grand Supreme’s Mysterious Origin Ancestor,\nBorn during the vast kalpa’s time.\nHeaven and earth’s bright steward,\nSun and moon’s alternating support.\n\nVastly bestowing benevolent virtue,\nMajestically expounding great compassion.",

      "translated_text": "Since I encountered the Mysterious Origin,\nIts transmission has spread everywhere among people.\nIn tranquil, true joy, far from recklessness,\nA single cloud-heart refines the Nine Suns.\n\nFrom heaven descends the Fire Dragon, roaming the sea’s depths,\nFrom earth rises the black mist, entering the vaulted sky.\nGolden Elixir flies forth from the Primordial Ancestor,\nThe Jade Image returns to the homeland of Dao and virtue.\n\nShould you wish to know the true marvels of the Mysterious Origin,\nWithin the Five Thousand Words, ponder them in detail.\nRolling forth from Fusang, the sun’s single wheel,\nIts radiant, blazing flames illuminate the Void.\n\nWithin the Qian-Yuan cauldron, the Fire of Li is added,\nIn the Taiyi furnace, the Wind of Xun arises.\nThe refined Golden Elixir soars through the cosmos,\nThe forged Great Joy emerges from the vaulted sky.\n\nDivine transformations transcend a thousand kalpas,\nAscending Kunlun’s first peak.\nSilent and desolate, the myriad forms dissolve into emptiness,\nWithin the void, dimly discerned, divine powers appear.\n\nThe moon in the endless sky is neither round nor incomplete,\nThe primordial wind neither moves nor sways.\nMoonlight shines, yet Li Lou’s eyes lose their sight,\nThe wind blows, and Shi Kuang’s ears forget their keen hearing.\n\nThrough refined thought, the divine and sagely work grows refined,\nGreatly revealing the Mysterious Origin’s supreme achievement.\nOnce parted from homeland and kin, forsaking the six relations,\nHeart like cold ashes, form withered, escaping the clamor of dust.\n\nThe Azure Youth daily presents treasures within the text,\nThe Red Child constantly replenishes the cauldron’s precious contents.\nClouds and waters, Mount Jing’s empty appearances,\nPost roads and merchant travels weary the spirit in vain.\n\nSpirit roams the eight directions, riding the empty chariot,\nIn another realm, the Purple Palace blooms with spring.\nBeyond the misty forest, the ancient pavilion of echoes,\nGibbons cry in the haze, awakening from drunkenness.\n\nAt midnight, through parted curtains, the sparse moon gleams white,\nAt dawn, beyond the window, the drifting wind is clear.\nPure as the jade zither’s chill beyond the world,\nResonant as the jade pendants’ sound amid the clouds.\n\nNot a speck of dust remains, the starry eyes gleam bright,\nThe Flying Youth pierces the great Orchid City.\nThe Immortal of the Northern Darkness pays homage to Fuxi,\nThe path smooth, the Cinnabar Phoenix enters the Emperor’s realm.\n\nScattering auspicious jade blossoms, they reach the Sun Palace,\nGathering rosy clouds, the golden mirror shines in the Hall of Light.\nForm shifts, shadow turns, transcending the Three Realms,\nThings change, stars flow, emerging from the four directions.\n\nPenetrating earth and heaven, yet nothing remains,\nSolitary, a single point illuminates the center.\nWithout fasting rituals or scripture study,\nRefining true essence enters the Great Vehicle.\n\nIn heaven’s furnace, the Red Phoenix’s marrow,\nBetween the brows, two cauldrons of Black Tortoise essence.\nYang’s light illuminates, piercing dark valleys,\nVast qi surges into the profound, entering the distant void.\n\nSelf and other both forgotten, the whole body manifests,\nThe work complete, one is ranked among the Nine Celestial Stars.\nThe solitary peak of Mount Mei, locked in cloudy blossoms,\nA single path of mindfulness dissolves the form.\n\nTwo streams of pure light pierce the azure vault,\nA single wisp of blue mist pours into the cold courtyard.\nOsmanthus blossoms push forth, the spirit refreshed,\nLuminous qi clears the forms, making them bright.\n\nThe twin luminaries’ intersecting light dazzles the heavens,\nThe Five Spirits’ immortals may ascend.\nWorldly affairs and dusty passions, swept away with a single sword,\nThe divine wind’s mighty power matches the Mysterious Mechanism.\n\nThe sun’s essence and moon’s spirit penetrate the hexagrams,\nWood’s fluid and metal’s essence transform Kan and Li.\nRiding phoenix wings through the Nine Bends of the river,\nEmbracing the dragon, soaring above the Three Mountains’ peaks.\n\nSilently paying homage to the Lord of Images, returning to the transformations of Chen,\nSwiftly driving the jade heavens, the path never lost.\nThe Mysterious Pass moves in and out, operating the pivot,\nDividing yin and yang, establishing the Two Modes.\n\nBefore the Taiyi Kun, the Jade Hare dashes,\nAtop Kunlun’s summit, the Golden Rooster takes wing.\nWithin the Western River’s waves, red brocade unfurls,\nFrom the Eastern Sea’s billows, the White Tortoise emerges.\n\nSpitting forth auspicious light, the heart-cauldron shines,\nThe divine elixir advances in splendor, piercing the heavens in flight.\nThe celestial essence melts, nourishing the Seven Treasures’ body,\nAt ease, one never loses their true nature.\n\nTwo wisps of blue mist return to the Source Sea,\nA single streak of light illuminates the Valley Spirit.\nOften taking this mechanism to guide the superior person,\nAlways using the Supreme Dao to refine the stubborn vessel.\n\nFellow disciples, grasping the poem’s essence,\nMay also become carefree, idle individuals.\n\n**Inscription of the Three Sages (Two Chapters)**\n\nThe Three Sages’ rule begins with the Dao as foremost.\nBeyond affairs, how can it be natural?\nOpening the *Book of Zhou*, \"silent and unmoving,\"\nIlluminating the hexagrams and images, \"stirred, they penetrate the Mysterious.\"\n\nDelving into Buddhist scriptures, forgetting the finger pointing at the moon,\nAwakening to perfect clarity, this may be called Chan.\nPerusing the *Dao and Virtue*, \"the Valley Spirit does not die,\"\nThe profound Feminine, \"entering and exiting, ceaselessly.\"\n\nWandering beyond the dust and grime,\nUnfettered, before the Great Ultimate.\nAll streams, when gathered, return to the sea,\nThe myriad forms, when arrayed, all belong to heaven.\n\n**Another Chapter**\n\nOf old, the two masters opened my sacred text,\nUttering a single truth, unlocking the primordial chaos,\nExpounding the Two Modes, splitting open Qian and Kun.\n\nThe great sound, why should it be confined to notes?\nThe great image, not bound by blue and black.\nPursuing Zhuangzi, attaining the

      "translated_text": "**Seven-Character Quatrains by Marquis Gu She Shanyuan, Sixty Poems**\n\nHow wondrous—this heart at ease in the great school,\nNot drifting midstream but reaching distant shores.\nDrunk, I fell from the cart for white wine’s sake;\nSober, I grasp my sandals for pure tea’s grace.\n\nPrimal essence surges forth, piercing heaven’s flight,\nWandering winds yield to the Two Modes’ might.\nThus I shed my form to return to the unbegun,\nWhere the Azure Lad invites me to the Elixir Pool.\n\nWhy in youth did I leave my home?\nPondering deeply, I sigh with woe.\nHad not the Image-Mystery flowed into the crucible,\nI’d still be driving the salt cart to this day.\n\nDragon’s drool and phoenix candles trace fragrant smoke,\nEyes illumine sparse woods, vast qi serene.\nA gust of cold wind startles the crane’s dream—\nOn the star altar, the *Step-of-Void* chant rings.\n\nThe secluded pass’s fading light dissolves form,\nDual luminaries merge their glow in one bright realm.\nSelf and things both forgotten, the whole body appears,\nFused into a single point of Great Void’s essence.\n\nBrows unfurled like wings, the sky’s vastness gleams,\nThe radiant sun and numinous wind illumine the Grand Clarity.\nTransforming the body leaves no room for wind-fire’s nature—\nI know my true self belongs to the Lesser Weave Star.\n\nA furnace of gold and fire emits lead’s splendor,\nDazzling heaven and earth with emerald haze.\nGuarding within, no thieving yin-ghosts intrude—\nNaturally, the sacred crucible congeals numinous sand.\n\nNurturing one furnace of red phoenix marrow,\nRefining two crucibles of crimson dragon essence,\nI open the cosmos-wide Heavenly Eye—\nAt chaos’ first division, my vision grows clear.\n\nLate at night, sitting alone as autumn’s moon hangs,\nAuspicious qi lightly floats through twelve cycles.\nLonging to return to Divine Empyrean’s old path,\nThe ancient fork gleams where azure haze gathers.\n\nThe soaring kite outshines cloud-ladders,\nCarved wood’s craft plays with cunning mechanisms.\nTo be useful or not—one must suit oneself;\nIn the forest, I cast aside the sling and wander home.\n\nShaking off the dust’s bonds, I part ways,\nMy brother’s resolve stands firm, unchanging.\nThough water and clouds veil us three thousand leagues apart,\nI vow not to return unless I become an immortal.\n\nGazing up and down through a hundred thousand fathoms,\nMy drunken soul flies into the azure sky’s heart.\nA youth guides me to Jade Pool’s mouth—\nThe toad’s radiance is refined into pure gold.\n\nThis illusory body long concealed in deep illness,\nExchanging form and light to illumine the jeweled peak.\nLayers of jade-green shadows float on rushing mist,\nA fire-dragon emerges from the azure pool’s depths.\n\nIn a blink, brows raised, the sun of wisdom dawns,\nA river of landscapes unfolds before my eyes.\nJingshan’s peaks split open to reveal the spirit-treasure—\nA flawless heap of jade gleams forth.\n\nMy heart dwells beyond things, serene and free,\nA single lotus leaf floats on the azure sea.\nThe lotus blooms, its flower born of the sun’s smile,\nDrifting with the wind to Jade Capital’s sky.\n\nStanding tall in the empyrean, I survey the world’s splendor,\nOn Jade Pool’s twin shores, golden flowers bloom.\nMy drunken soul roams beyond the mundane,\nAwakening into the Mysterious Metropolis, the Lord of Images’ abode.\n\nThe Mysterious Origin and Great One embrace vast mystery,\nWithin the misty haze, all sights arise.\nOnly when the two spirits merge with the twin luminaries\nDoes yin’s numen transform into a single celestial star.\n\nGazing into the grotto’s waves of deep green,\nA sea-dragon plays with the night’s radiance.\nLight blazes from the Great Nonbeing’s vast solar horn—\nMyriad spirits converge to bear witness to the True Yang.\n\nAuspicious clouds densely blanket river and sky,\nPhoenix plumes and rainbows pierce the sun’s corner.\nNo wonder fragrant winds fill the hall—\nIn the jade palace, the jasper trees’ flowers vie in bloom.\n\nThe pearl-playing dragon emerges as the sea-gate opens,\nPurple mist soars through the ninefold heavens.\nBreaching the Bitter Pool to swallow sun and moon,\nThe immortals of the ten directions all turn in awe.\n\nRolling up the pearl curtain to gaze outward,\nPine winds and radiant sun penetrate the jade grove.\nSeven treasures gather in the tortoiseshell abode—\nA dazzling cluster of silver haze and jade.\n\nRoaming and soaring through golden clarity, merged with the Great Void,\nBrow Mountain’s moon-valley floats with auspicious clouds.\nWithout mastering this art, what can one achieve?\nIn vain does one stand tall in the empyrean as a man.\n\nBefore the jade mountain, myriad trees bloom,\nNaturally claiming a fine livelihood.\nThe immortal lad smiles at the western guest—\nRecently, the High Yang wine-tasting household.\n\nReturning again to Divine Empyrean’s old path,\nI wander at ease within the Jade Clarity Palace.\nThe starry river gleams, unknown to all—\nTwo blossoms of jasper bloom in one place.\n\nClearing the wild to plant jade *zhi* sprouts,\nI break open Jade Pool to irrigate them anew.\nDao-qi circulates, surging through the azure sea,\nNuminous winds pervade the clear empyrean.\n\nSun’s essence and moon’s marrow are refined without loss,\nEarth’s po and heaven’s hun are tempered without flaw.\nExchanging substance while retaining truth, I endure in the world,\nAmid ninefold radiance, I roam at will.\n\nMisty Jiang’s haze scatters, the vast sky clears—\nAlone, I face the Crimson Yang’s flying snowflakes.\nGolden and jade light streams, illumining the Grand Clarity,\nIn the cold forest, jasper flowers naturally form.\n\nThe world’s net and dust’s passions—already left behind,\nThe Mysterious Gate’s true secret—what doubt remains?\nIf a man harbors the will to soar to heaven,\nWhy wait to become an immortal?\n\nClinging to illusion, why question the illusory mechanism?\nAwakening to the mechanism still leads one astray.\nI sigh for the cloud-water wanderer of the east—\nIn vain he journeyed to Jing Mountain, returning empty-handed.\n\nThe hundred-legged *kui* and serpent pass pity in turn,\nWandering winds and spirit transformations—all in vain.\nOne must first seek the precelestial ancestor—\nOnly then can one enter my school’s foremost mystery.\n\nLast night at the third watch, the moon shone bright,\nGentle winds and dew dripped in clear spheres.\nWho sang that resonant melody?\nI suspect it was a jade-inebriated immortal from the jasper palace.\n\nAlone I come and go on Zhongnan’s slopes by the Wei,\nSeeking the worthies, I pass through Tong Pass.\nMarket scholars and rustic elders pay no heed—\nThrough rain and clouds, I return to my old mountain.\n\nBriefly leaving the immortal isle for the human realm,\nThe bitter sea’s waves make salvation arduous.\nBraving snow and wind, I return to my old retreat—\nIn the night’s chill, I cross Tong Pass with sword in hand.\n\nNine years’ work accomplished, the effect is subtle,\nReturning home, I contain the jade mechanism’s secret.\nLong have I sighed for the empyrean—\nYet in the forest, I am again bound like a tree stump.\n\nClinging to illusion, Master Wen questions the illusory mechanism,\nFurther inquiring of Master Yang—only to deepen the maze.\nHow many gains and losses does the deer discern?\nDrunk, I ride the cart, my limbs undone.\n\nWords and wit contend with Hui Ang,\nYet I regret having no master to meet Liang Yang.\nAbandoning home and neglecting work to indulge desires—\nThorns await the moment to test Ji Chang.\n\nThe wise of this world mock those who leave home,\nKnowing their spirit’s vastness has no bounds.\nSeeking the fire-mirror, three cups of wine—\nTheir savor surpasses Lu Tong’s seven bowls of tea.\n\nThe rut-bound fish long trapped, awaiting the western river,\nFor my esteemed guest, I speak of Master Yang.",

      "translated_text": "All say, \"Having gained the pearl, why need the Dao?\"\nFortunate to meet Master Dongguo, I pour out my heart.\n\nTen thousand layered emerald peaks lean against the azure haze,\nA river of jade-green waters joins the river’s edge.\nWhere now the sword bestowed in years past?\nTo whom today is the hidden light entrusted?\n\nAuspicious radiance stirs the celestial glow, illuminating the Great Clarity,\nThe vermilion court bears the fiery essence of tiger and dragon.\nRefined into a treasure-mirror, luminous as the heavens,\nTwo divine beams converge in one bright place.\n\nFacing the wind, we chant and harmonize a thousand poems,\nBeneath the moon, cups brim with a hundred measures of wine.\nAt ease upon ancient Kunlun, self and other forgotten,\nThe drunken soul soars into the Palace of Broad Cold.\n\nThe ancient Dao was originally divided from the Primordial Beginning,\nVast and boundless, the Three Realms merge as one.\nThe whale and roc emerge from the sea, their traces stretching far,\nFlying to the Jasper Pool in the sixth summer month.\n\nI regret having pursued rare skills and vain pursuits,\nFor rank and wealth, glory and gate—how hard to attain!\nJust now I saw the lord boast of his strength,\nFashioning a single leaf for you to see.\n\nThe shallow filth of the salamander and loach becomes their foundation,\nYet to restrain the weak and bind the sturgeon is not fitting.\nIf only the heavenly wind would lift my wings,\nI would ride the whirlwind to the Jasper Pool.\n\nThe fiery wheel grinds through the azure beryl,\nTwo golden beams advance in radiant flight.\nThus the image of the Mysterious flows into the crucible,\nNaturally roaming and soaring through the Ninefold Clarity.\n\nWho pities the rut-bound fish, trapped on the road?\nThose who flow with the current mock the sickly flesh.\nThe misty waves of the Northern Sea must part in the end—\nUnfurl your wings, chart the southern course, cross the Five Lakes.\n\nWho has seen the divine being, so ethereal in form,\nDrinking wind, sipping dew, her skin like snow?\nFor a moment she leaves the misty caves of Guye,\nSteadily riding the flying dragon to the Jade Capital.\n\nWhat matter of the Primordial Origin is most profound?\nThe towering treasure-dharma crowns all past and present.\nHaving gained the jade grove’s soaring white feathers,\nA single crimson sun illumines the heart of heaven.\n\nAt ease with Mei and Zhang, I chant extemporaneously,\nThe two masters’ wisdom deepens our bond.\nLike wind and moon, clear through all ages,\nThey illuminate the heart of heaven, ten thousand fathoms deep.\n\nStriking the void, striking things—ghosts and spirits startle,\nLeaning into each step, borrowing lightness with ease.\nWhen I ascend the Jade Empyrean to the realm of Jia,\nI shall transform you then, carrying you to take dragon form.\n\nA crucible of golden fire blazes in the celestial thoroughfare,\nRevealing the flawless pearl that illumines the sea.\nEnveloped and suddenly clarified, congealing into jade,\nRefined into an immortal—wondrous skill!\n\nJade springs well forth, flowing into golden wells,\nIn an instant, the southern cinnabar and northern sea achieve merit.\nSplitting the Mysterious Pearl to release radiant clouds,\nThe Mysterious Pearl soars to Kunlun’s summit.\n\nPerfect clarity—ten thousand dharmas exist within the void,\nA single stream of cinnabar surges through the gate of wisdom.\nGazing upon the jade grove’s clustered blossoms,\nTwo geese tilt the celestial flask, pouring wine from the Gourd Heaven.\n\nThe Primordial Great Man’s wind tears asunder,\nHis brows like the jade toad swallowing the moon over the sea.\nThe treasure-feast’s celestial light illumines the Five Tombs,\nCinnabar essence scatters, yellow blossoms form.\n\nStaff in hand, I wander to visit the misty vines,\nYet how many desolate paths and wayward inns lie in wait!\nNo need for the two concubines to know beauty or ugliness—\nAlas, I lack the grace to emulate Han E.\n\nThree-colored mists swirl, striking the Crimson Palace,\nVermilion gates half-conceal the true countenance.\nThe ice-grinding wheel shatters the path of the Mysterious Ridge,\nTransforming all under heaven with the wind of primordial antiquity.\n\nTo move things, to pluck flowers—all is emptiness,\nWhere in human relations does one apply effort?\nThe Tathāgata once spoke of awe-inspiring spiritual power—\nI ask the Chan stream: have you grasped it?\n\nAscending the upper story, the eye’s realm brightens,\nI seem to doubt my body has reached Huaqing.\nNo need for cloud-borne chariots in the central heavens—\nI fly into the fiery palace to accompany the morning star.\n\nGazing all day at the golden crow in the empyrean,\nThe Vermilion Mound’s fiery domain refines the jade crucible.\nThe treasure-dharma dissolves form, transcending the material,\nThe Nine Spirits’ immortals ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe numinous gaze, tempered, enters the vermilion court,\nYellow qi surges, sweeping away impure forms.\nLooking up and down, the cavernous void is fully responsive,\nThe lush radiance of the Empyrean illumines Huaqing.\n\n**Seven-character full verse**\nIn the Hall of Fungi, verdant hues speak of the Mysterious Subtle,\nDirectly pointing to the alchemical canon, revealing the jade mechanism.\nThe ocean’s depths churn with red agate,\nThe mountain’s heights shatter azure beryl.\n\nThe jade hare of the Moon Palace roams the mossy path,\nThe golden crow of the Sun Palace rests on the cassia branch.\nTwo segments of light return to one place—\nThe Peerless Noble ascends to the Jasper Pool.\n\nIn years past, I wandered and lost my way, not returning home,\nToday, turning my gaze, I return to the emerald clouds.\nGolden fire overflows the crucible in five hues,\nCinnabar fills the tripod, emitting triple radiance.\n\nBy the river, I seize and break the Black Dragon’s tail,\nOn the ridge, I strike open the White Tiger’s teeth.\nThe cave-mirror of Fivefold Clarity penetrates the Great Existence—\nThen I ride the crane-chariot, driving the cloud-carriage.\n\nIn the cavern-chamber, the night is desolate,\nThe ape and horse are captured to accompany solitude.\nThe jade hare pursues the toad at the corner of the heavens,\nThe golden crow embraces the sun, circling the sky’s waist.\n\nThe dragon coils around the medicine tripod, the Three Flowers gather,\nThe tiger retreats from the elixir furnace, the Five Qi pay homage.\nRefining the numinous cinnabar to dwell beyond form,\nThe Jade Capital’s immortal precincts are not far.\n\nBy chance I traverse the long abyss, dwelling temporarily,\nLike one waiting for a hare by an empty stump.\nUnmet by Bo Le, I ride a salt-laden horse,\nLike encountering Zhuangzi’s rut-bound fish.\n\nHow could I heed the vain search of years past?\nOnly now do I know the attainment of the Mysterious Pearl.\nIn Longxi, we meet again by chance—\nI write these heartfelt words to send to you.\n\nWhy does Zhan He reel in his fishing line?\nThe □ carp leaps the waves, snapping the hook.\nDelighted to escape the shallow stream, leaving the sea of suffering,\nFortunate to meet the long waters and find ease.\n\nContent to dwell in a thatched hut, welcoming the mountain elder,\nForgetting to visit the vermilion gates of noble lords.\nWho will see me home, drunk from the village feast?\nA shepherd boy supports me, riding backward on an ox.\n\nAlas, I wander within and without, knowing no path,\nMistakenly entering the cloudy mountains to strike and stay.\nThe lost Mysterious Pearl must be sought in concealment,\nThe moon of the mind, once stilled, requires no search.\n\nA single strand of blue mist descends from the heavens,\nTwo trails of red rainbow roll across the earth.\nHaving reached the Fiery Palace, mother and child part,\nSideways, the Seven Luminaries circulate through the great expanse.\n\nI send word to the pine-shaped, crane-haired elder:\nSearch well for the Mysterious Subtle, leap from the mortal cage.\nThe Three Passes’ qi surges, white as the heavens,\nA single golden elixir shoots red into the crucible.\n\nMercury congeals in the Jade Yang, leaving the Water Palace,\nLead solidifies into golden qi, entering the Fiery Palace.\nThe flowing pearl ascends Kunlun’s summit—\nI behold the vast winds of the Jasper Pool.\n\nTo imitate others is not merely to betray kindness,\nConcealing evil, obscuring the upright, dimming heaven’s truth.\nRelying on spirits, clinging to the Dao for livelihood,\nClasping a child, nestling with a wife, expounding the teachings—\n\nSuch is not the way.",
      "overlap_context": "mbs undone.\n\nWords and wit contend with Hui Ang,\nYet I regret having no master to meet Liang Yang.\nAbandoning home and neglecting work to indulge desires—\nThorns await the moment to test Ji Chang.\n\nThe wise of this world mock those who leave home,\nKnowing their spirit’s vastness has no bounds.\nSeeking the fire-mirror, three cups of wine—\nTheir savor surpasses Lu Tong’s seven bowls of tea.\n\nThe rut-bound fish long trapped, awaiting the western river,\nFor my esteemed guest, I speak of Master Yang.",

awakened Zhuang Zhou.\nGu Ye returned through spiritual transformation,\nHu Qiu resumed his outer wanderings.\nDongmen became my companion,\nNanguo too my fellow.\nIn youth, my nature inclined toward the sacred,\nIn middle age, my appearance grew dull as folly.\nThe gull startled, forgetting its true form,\nThe dog barked at the exchange of black robes.\nWhy question the two concubines?\nThe Three Spirits have their own appointed time.\nJi Jian failed in physiognomy,\nWen Zhi excelled in healing arts.\nWho wields the illusions of the owl and rooster?\nThe ring dance charts its own discord.\nSharp as a mountain-consuming fire,\nProud as a cup set upon the elbow.\nA gentleman’s vessel bears no burden,\nYet displays the talent of a petty man.\nRecent conduct differs not from wisdom,\nVainly laboring on a thousand-foot terrace.\nWhy should such as these cross the threshold?\nA master craftsman measures before cutting.\nEasy to maintain a pure and disciplined mind,\nHard to sustain a daily fast.\nThe crucible boils root-bound greens,\nThe furnace burns leaf-laden firewood.\nI marvel at the fish trapped in the wheel rut—\nA ladle of water brings no disaster.\nDisciples’ affections run shallow,\nThe Daoist abbey grows desolate.\nWild herbs remain year-round,\nHousehold grain nears exhaustion.\nMy heart has already consented—\nWhat say you, sir?\nLiezi journeyed through Wei,\nYet where to find one’s true abode?\nIn facing affairs, one knows the value of leisure,\nIn stilling the mind, one perceives the Dao’s majesty.\nAncient masters personally demonstrated ruin,\nTemporarily borrowing aid from the Mysterious Gate.\nWhy boast of flint’s sharpness?\nShang Qiu remains in dullness.\nThree years to form a single leaf,\nAll by grace of heaven’s favor.\nThe

in seclusion to refine the valley spirit.\nThrough penetrating the mysterious, self and other are forgotten,\nAttaining the wondrous, kinship and estrangement dissolve.\nYin Shi transformed into a servant,\nThe laborer presumptuously played the guest—\nNo need to distinguish waking from dreaming,\nBeyond appearances lies eternal spring.\nA long whistle laughs at the unworthy,\nFishing for fools, not for fish.\nA needle’s tip dispenses grains of rice,\nA standing tree praises the long road.\nWhen singing in harmony, gratitude must be distant,\nThose who know the tune keep the Dao close.\nLooking down upon my disciples,\nNot one shares the same aspiration.\nStriking tiles, the child is careless,\nMocking poetry, the vase is but a model.\nInquiring of the dawn, one knows distance,\nPitying creatures, one discerns their arising.\nDispelling illusions, the ring dance ceases,\nWelcoming the lord, facing the circular screen.\nRefining cinnabar to temper azure jade,\nExchanging bones to ascend Qingcheng.\nOn the road, startled by the three cloths,\nMidway, wary of the five brews.\nThe inept servant cannot judge a horse,\nThe neighbor’s son has already lost his sheep.\nWhy plot to wear Zhang’s seal?\nWhy imitate Ji Chang?\nNot boasting of autumn waters’ arrival,\nThe heart finds boundless ease.\nThe Great Dao manifests the Three Bodies,\nThe Three Bodies all converge in one truth.\nThe black dragon hides in the depths,\nThe cinnabar phoenix rises in auspicious clouds.\nThe two apertures pour forth golden liquid,\nThe twin passes refine the jade

three rivers,\nClouds withdraw, clarifying the four seas.\nThe golden serpent roams the water palace,\nThe jade hare hastens to the fiery city.\nRefining the firm and pure nature,\nReturning to rest

grove,\nJasper blossoms scatter from the jeweled peak.\nThe vermilion court hears the golden phoenix cry,\nThe lunar palace echoes the jade dragon’s chant.\nRefining the body to condense the Three

unyielding might, it shatters the sky,\nCongealing emptiness, ten thousand points of streaming stars emerge.\nThe Primordial Void Sovereign gave birth to the Great Antiquity,\nFitting to be the eternal lord of the mysterious.\nAmong the four great domains, it alone stands first,\nEnduring through kalpas as heaven and earth’s ancestor.\nNourishing the spirit, I knock upon the Dao to clarify mysterious virtue,\nVastly distant from misty vines, still and silent.\nLeaping forth as a flying immortal into Great Hua,\nDwelling forever in the serene and sunlit realm.\nThe heart connects to wondrous subtleties, illuminating true patterns,\nAttaining that pure emptiness, delving into profundities.\nThe supreme Dao is level and easy, taken in due course,\nAscending the mysterious to become a guest of the Great Canopy.\nAt heaven and earth’s center, like a bellows,\nSkillfully harmonizing sound and form through mutual accord.\nWithin the mysterious, not striking the fine notes,\nA single strain of reed pipes pierces the phoenix pavilion.\nThe Jade Clarity Sage Ancestor left the Three Armors,\nResponding to the supremely profound and wondrous Dharma.\nSending forth jasper blossoms to descend from the azure sky,\nRed frost flake by flake, pressed by fragrant winds.\nSincerity subdues the corporeal soul, uplifting the ethereal,\nLuminous qi, pure and clear, envelops the jeweled jade.\nIntent follows the sun’s splendor into emerald peaks,\nJade cliffs stretch into the gaze of empty mountains.\nShaking off the dusty world, not long submerged,\nMerging with the Great Beginning, knowing the true origin.\nDivine might and qi’s image encompass heaven’s heart,\nThe Dao spreads the sun’s essence, bright and glistening.\nThe Dao slays the Three Corpses through the power of attraction,\nThe numinous yang elixir conceals pure yin.\nSuddenly, unaware, the inner form is forgotten,\nSeated, one attains the cloudy heavens, the spirit feasts in repose.\nWithin, the essence is cleansed, the void gleams with jade fragments,\nClear as ice, lustrous as the autumn river’s moon.\nThe Crimson Palace faintly senses the crystal’s chill,\nJeweled splendor, starlight’s radiance, flying flakes of snow.\nA single point of heaven’s light in the Great Void,\nClapping, sealing, surging harmony enters without seam.\nTreading upon the ten thousand fathoms’ peak of heaven and

Jasper Pool Isle.\n\nThe crystal curtain winds roll, wafting pure fragrance,\nHeaven’s lustrous void, dustless, transmits the Six Treasures.\nThe Dharma-eye unfolds at the brows’ lashes,\nEyes gleam, pupils dazzle, weaving celestial brilliance.\n\nAwe-inspiring wind encircles the earth from the four directions,\nTen thousand streams of numinous light greet the heavens.\nThe Primordial Beginning dwelt before the vast kalpas,\nOpening the Three Realms, establishing the Double Mystery.\n\nHeaven and earth are born from Its transformation,\nThrough kalpas’ ruin, It endures, ever majestic.\nThe Dao transforms the Three Palaces in wondrous mystery,\nThe Primordial Spirit Emperor secretly transmits It.\n\nFetal radiance flows into the numinous yang body,\nSix Caverns’ flying essence descends from the Nine Heavens.\nThe pilgrim’s staff stirs the sea of Perfect Awakening,\nThe precept-knife cleaves the Jade Capital Mountain.\n\nThe Dragon Palace proffers the resplendent Mystic Pearl,\nSubtle flowing light fills heaven and earth.\nJade-like forms ascend the peaks in reverse,\nThe numinous crow alights by the sea turtle’s edge.\n\nForms shift, shadows turn, following the wind’s departure,\nThings change, stars drift, waves meet the sky.\nThe divine sword, whetted, startles the mad steed,\nThe wisdom-blade, brandished, shocks the playful ape.\n\nHeaven and earth stand apart, all demons’ heads severed,\nA single surge of awe-inspiring light topples the world.\nAt night, the sonorous stone is cast into the sea’s depths,\nThe Water Palace is split open, revealing the Dragon Palace.\n\nAll proffer the luminous pearl in offering,\nFlames blaze in the cloudy skies, the azure firmament.\nThe Precept Altar’s sacred beasts exhale fragrant spirals,\nJade pendants chime, harmonizing with the tinkling girdle-ornaments.\n\nTrue sages descend, returning to their original stations,\nOnce more wielding the divine sword, ascending the stellar pivot.\nI urge you to keep your heart in the realm of Dao and virtue,\nI hear the immortal courts have established the examination grounds.\n\nThe Divine Empyrean bears wings to transmit the golden register,\nThe Purple Palace knows no one to present the jade missive.\nThe dragon soars, roaming the Crimson Emperor’s realm,\nThe Luo Yuan immortal maiden sits in Flowery Yang.\n\nTwo streams of earthly qi traverse the Ox and Dipper,\nA single ray of heavenly light anchors the azure vault.\nThe Crimson Palace just perceives the talismanic smoke’s fragrance,\nThe wind gently carries the sound of jade pendants.\n\nIn the clear night, who presents the memorial?\nThe perfected one paces the stellar pivot upon the altar.\nCultivation must attain the Valley Spirit’s numinosity,\nA single point of perfect clarity illumines the Supreme Clarity.\n\nThe frosty sky, profound, hosts the ancient moon,\nThe limpid sea of awakening bathes the streaming stars.\nA single grain of numinous cinnabar glows in the Great Clarity,\nMerged with the empty valley, the formless appears.\n\nThe Dharma-realm’s boundless truth gleams in a thousandfold purity,\nMisty radiance illumines the ten thousand images of heaven and earth.\nThe ancient Dao, level and smooth, allows progress,\nTwo branching paths connect to the celestial court.\n\nRiding the dragon, the maiden of alchemy roams the Golden Gates,\nMounting the tiger, the infant traverses the Jade Capital.\nTreading Kunlun, piercing the heavens,\nReturning to the supreme Dao, restoring the primordial origin.\n\nTigers leap, mountain peaks turn,\nDragons soar from the abyss, sea waves churn.\nOpening the wisdom-eye, beholding the divine light,\nA single surge of pure yin wholly transforms into yang.\n\nVast as the sun rising to illuminate the world,\nBright as the moon casting its glow upon all directions.\nBrushing aside the mist, the spirit roams the azure realm,\nTwo wheels converge, grinding the stellar pivot.\n\nDragons fly in the sun’s palace, brewing golden liquid,\nPhoenixes blaze in the moon’s palace, drinking jade nectar.\nShunning worldly ties, seeking beyond the material,\nHead held high, laughing freely, delighting in the joy of song.\n\nShifting the spirit, step by step, following the wind’s path,\nEscorting my light form to ascend the precious peak.\nThe Dao descends in misty splendor, the scene is sublime,\nThe wondrous birth of heaven and earth knows no bounds.\n\nFlying essence, refined, pierces the heavens’ summit,\nEmbracing the sun, approaching the void, transforming Mount Taihua.\nAvoiding wind, nestling by the sun, eyes languidly open,\nWithin, yin and yang unite to nurture the sacred embryo.\n\nOnly then does one believe a man’s body can conceive,\nNaturally, beyond the material, the immortal fetus dances.\nPairing heaven and earth to serve as the elixir furnace,\nThe sun and moon, round, encircle the face’s dwelling.\n\nAt the sea’s bottom, the true supreme treasure is refined,\nThe gray-haired one cooks the Primordial Pearl to perfection.\nSlaying the ape, taming the horse, transforming the dragon colt,\nIt bears me, following the wind, into the Great Void.\n\nA single streaming star flies to the moon’s palace,\nTwo crimson flames ascend to the celestial Wu.\nClad in simplicity, awakened, drinking the true wind,\nEmerging from the human realm, affairs are not the same.\n\nShould you ask where the master abides,\nSteadily riding the crane’s back, wings upon the turtle palace.\nAmidst the seated clouds and mist, the cold stream is locked,\nThunder’s peaks rumble, disturbing the Supreme Subtlety.\n\nTen thousand silver waves pour into the azure ravine,\nA single surge of jade waves cascades into the Jasper Pool.\nThe sun’s soul and moon’s spirit cast their cold radiance,\nThe two are captured, held between Kan and Li.\n\nSuddenly, from the sea’s depths, the dragon and tiger roar,\nAtop the mountain, the phoenix and luan bird take startled flight.\nThe layered peaks of Guye cast floating emerald shadows,\nWithin the grotto, the divine transformation reveals snow-white skin.\n\nBy what power does one roam the four seas?\nThe crane’s chariot, riding the whirlwind, departs the Jade Capital.\nReleasing the jade hare to chase the numinous crow,\nCatching up to the Gate of Simplicity, entering the Great Beginning.\n\nTen thousand golden rays illuminate the cosmos,\nA thousand silver mists shine upon the void.\nTo refine the One True, the Three Wonders must be cultivated,\nThen employ the Three Wonders to unite the Two Modes.\n\nIf the Two Modes are made one body,\nThe golden elixir will naturally pierce the heavens and fly.\nEyes pure, beholding the celestial signs,\nEars keen, listening to the steps of emptiness.\n\nGreat is the Dao that follows all directions,\nThe most wondrous true constancy merges with the sun’s congealment.\nThe fiery furnace pours into the tripod, refining red cinnabar,\nThree-colored mists swirl, releasing rainbow hues.\n\nResplendent treasures, intricate, fly through the cosmos,\nThe Primordial Elixir descends into the Central Land.\nThe body like withered wood, the nature like ashes,\nSilently, in clarity, nurturing the sacred embryo.\n\nSeated in the jade palace, coming to inquire of the Dao,\nHead held high, laughing freely, the osmanthus blooms.\nBrows arched, eyes bright, the heart’s pearl leaps,\nDescending upon the golden plate, five colors unfurl.\n\nWithin, dispatching the jade lad to gather the sun’s sea,\nTo accompany me in returning to the grotto-heaven’s abode.\nWhen lead and mercury are paired, rely on the sun and moon,\nWhen the tripod and furnace are placed, employ heaven and earth.\n\nThe Three Yangs’ true fire burns the numinous substance,\nA single grain of golden elixir ascends in reverse.\nA foot’s distance, yet the sea of suffering is deep,\nThe mind follows the currents, drifting into the waves’ heart.\n\nLosing the celestial truth, one wanders through a thousand kalpas,\nFrom ancient times until now, endlessly cycling.\nAscending the Mystery, awakening to the Dao’s profundity,\nExpanding the numinous source, concealing the illusory heart.\n\nIn an instant, traversing all directions,\nOnly by treading the ancient path can one know the present.\nStartled awake, one awakens to the immortal realm,\nOnly then does one trust the spirit’s congealment in the sun’s beneficent light.\n\nIn the child’s furnace, the jade liquid pours,\nWithin the fetal immortal’s tripod, the jasper nectar blends.",

      "translated_text": "**Seven-Character Verses by Gu Shehou Shanyuan**\n\nKan and Li intertwine, merging the sacred mechanism,\nTwo paths sever the way, linking to Heaven’s frontier.\nThe celestial cycle ten thousand times returns, the dragon assumes its stance,\nThe earth a thousand fathoms deep, the tiger displays its might.\n\nDriving back external demons, eradicating the six harms,\nSeizing the retreating yin ghosts and the Three Worms.\nFrom between the brows, the toad sword is drawn,\nWith a single slash, floating clouds mend the leaky pond.\n\nCarefree and untroubled, delighting in pure leisure,\nLeading cranes, bearing staffs, wandering water and mountain.\nWind rolls emerald mist across verdant peaks,\nMoonlight and gentle haze reach the blue ridges.\n\nBefore the grotto, water bursts forth like a thousand pearls,\nBeneath the ravine, clouds congeal into a ball of snow.\nLuminous and crystalline, the Dao-eye shines,\nDivinely clear and refreshing, chilling all who approach.\n\nIn the primal chaos, the Two Modes first parted,\nThe Three Powers transformed, root of creation.\nAscending and descending, sun and moon soar,\nFloating and sinking, Qian and Kun stand firm.\n\nJade fragments drift down from the void,\nGolden elixir grains surge upward in reverse.\nTwo azure lads roam the green peaks,\nEmbracing the simurgh, they fly into the Gate of the Great Mystery.\n\nSuddenly, the nature awakens to the true source,\nInstantly, the heart-pearl connects everywhere.\nUnfettered and pure, returning to refined delight,\nMighty and spiritually refined, washing away dust and delusion.\n\nClouds withdraw, revealing the moon in the deep pool,\nMists disperse, and the primordial wind arises.\nSupremely all-knowing, pervading the ten directions,\nPerfectly luminous, the solitary body illumines the void.\n\nSplitting open chaos to reveal Heaven’s heart,\nThe essence of sun and moon fills the Great Yin.\nThe Dipper’s handle turns, heaven and earth rain,\nThe Dharma wheel revolves, the Great Void deepens.\n\nIntermingling light emits a thousand pearls,\nChaotic things welcome ten thousand specks of gold.\nThe supreme treasure needs no search beyond,\nNurturing spirit and awareness, the Dao takes its course.\n\nEmbracing constancy, knowing contentment, the primordial spirit is restored,\nDelighting in ease and tranquility, the utmost truth is cultivated.\nEradicating sharpness, eliminating greed, the Dao is fully realized,\nDispelling the blade, gazing into the mystery, the eternal body is renewed.\n\nExternally seeking jade and pearls brings no true worth,\nInternally cleansing the sacred casket is never impoverished.\nWhere does the crane’s chariot, borne on the whirlwind, alight?\nWithin the grotto, only the four seasons renew.\n\nEver preserve the will, severing false splendor,\nReturning to reflect on the Dragon Realm, the Purple Mansion.\nIn the indistinct, the primordial spirit surges through vast qi,\nIn the profound darkness, true breath radiates crimson mist.\n\nThe Jade Pool’s waves are pure, golden pistils float,\nThe Azure Sea’s ripples are clear, jade blossoms drift.\nFragrance unfurls, heaven and earth gleam,\nFrom the congealed void, night-bright sand flies.\n\nDivine fire blazes fiercely on Mount Gen,\nWith a single thrust from the tail gate, the Three Passes open.\nThe colossal image of heaven circles the void,\nThe sea-blending flood dragons coil beyond all things.\n\nCongealing in one crucible, the marrow of heaven and earth,\nFusing in two cauldrons, the liver of the Great Yang.\nThose who awaken to this ascend as immortals,\nRiding the Yi, mounting the true, straddling the colored simurgh.\n\nTurning the Dipper’s handle, moving the numinous pivot,\nThe Great Being’s gate opens—nothing remains.\nExternally embracing the primordial Dao of Heaven,\nInternally concealing two scrolls of life-giving scripture.\n\nFrom nothingness, a thousand layers of jade are built,\nIn emptiness, ten thousand pearls are adorned.\nWith merit and practice both complete, transcending the world,\nRiding the whale, stepping steadily toward Yingdu.\n\nVastly opening the wisdom eye, revealing the clear gaze,\nThe two wings of divine wind chase the sun’s head.\nIn the Ren-Wu clouds, riding the jade elephant,\nIn the Ding-Gong sea, straddling the golden ox.\n\nCrimson mist curls around the Dragon Pavilion,\nPurple haze swirls thickly around the Phoenix Tower.\nShould one ask what blessed land this is,\nThe azure lad respectfully reports: it is Yingzhou.\n\nCurbing desire, removing passion, the will stands firm,\nThe barren wilderness of the quail transforms into fields of lingzhi.\nThe heart like the azure Han, probing the moon in the deep pool,\nThe nature like the red furnace, a lotus within the flame.\n\nRoaming and feasting beyond the true realms of Supreme Clarity,\nLingering in the primordial Great Luo Heaven of Yuanshi.\nThe Central August names me the Double Mystery Child,\nThe Gu She immortal dwells as the Primordial Transcendent.\n\nReversing yin and yang is true cultivation,\nA single torrent of the Yellow River flows backward.\nTen thousand strands of white light pierce the corners of the universe,\nA thousand threads of crimson flame emerge from mountain peaks.\n\nThe sun’s soul gleams brightly, manifesting everywhere,\nThe moon’s spirit radiates brilliantly, circling all directions.\nGreatly unfolding the majestic wind, opening the ancient Dao,\nRiding the simurgh, wielding the sword, roaming the nine heavens.\n\n**Ode to Nurturing Spirit**\nIn true emptiness, the child-mother mechanism is complete,\nGhosts and spirits intermingle, penetrating the mud pill.\nThe Two Modes and the Great Beginning must return to one—\nThe Dao of the Three Essentials.\n\nThe six directions share a single path—\nThe mechanism of the six harmonies.\nThe nine qi, profoundly mysterious, are the body beyond—\nThe Dao of the nine yang.\n\nThe celestial flow and heavenly water are the central symbol—\nThe mechanism of the upper pivot.\nOne must rely on the essentials, the master’s clear teaching,\nThe most profound explanation of the Double Mystery.\n\n**Ode to the Mysterious Image**\nVaguely, the divine transforms, the Jade Pass opens,\nA single point of fetal light descends upon the wisdom terrace.\nNaturally, the brilliance of Li and Yang shines,\nReturning the light to the origin, the flame glows white.\n\nThe Double Mystery’s wondrous pointer is hard to fathom,\nThe gate of all wonders—fools cannot guess.\nSerene, it may exist, approaching the morning audience with the Emperor,\nEmbracing the heart-moon, hastening to Penglai.\n\n**Ode to Cultivating Nature**\nIn the indistinct, departing for the Toad Palace to nurture the nature-embryo,\nThe hidden dragon bathes the cinnabar embryo beneath the waters.\nOne must know that guarding the dark is the root,\nNaturally, the numinous radiance illuminates the nature-terrace.\n\nWithin chaos, the Great One is revealed,\nIn the profound darkness, the heart’s brilliance is unfathomable.\nOne should follow where the wisdom-soul and yang arise,\nThe resplendent mystery-pearl moves of itself.\n\n**Ode to Heavenly Auspices**\nThe Heavenly Treasure is naturally so, without contrivance,\nAbandoning wisdom, leaving form, preceding the ten thousand transformations.\nLeaving nature to accompany emptiness, light pervades all,\nMoving spirit, gazing into the mystery, the Jade Heaven gleams.\n\nAllowing things and self to become illusory,\nNaturally, starry radiance shines before the eyes.\nThe sea-moon contains brilliance, light in ten thousand strands,\nTransforming into the Heavenly Auspicious Jade Pot Immortal.\n\nQian’s
