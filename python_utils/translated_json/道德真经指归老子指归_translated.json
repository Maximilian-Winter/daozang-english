  "full_translation": "**The *Zhǐguī* of the *Dàodé Zhēn Jīng*\nTitle: *The Zhǐguī of the Dàodé Zhēn Jīng*\nAlso titled *The Zhǐguī of the Lǎozǐ*.\nComposed by Yán Zhūn (style name Jūn Píng) of the Han dynasty.\nOriginal text comprised thirteen volumes; the first six are now lost.\nBase text source: *Zhèngtǒng Dàozàng*, *Dòngshén* section, *Yùjué* category.\nCollation references:\n1. *Chéngdū Yílán Táng Cóngshū* edition (hereafter *Yílán* text);\n2. *Mìcè Huìhán* edition (hereafter *Mìcè* text).\nSupplemented from Wáng Déyǒu’s *pointed and annotated* edition of *The Zhǐguī of the Lǎozǐ* (published by Zhōnghuá Shūjù, 1994).\n\n**The *Zhǐguī of the Dàodé Zhēn Jīng*\nComposed by Yán Zhūn of Shǔ Commandery (style name Jūn Píng), with annotations by Gǔshénzǐ.**\n\nIn ancient times, when Lǎozǐ composed the *Dàodé Jīng*,\nHis original intent was to trace the form and refine the *qi*,\nAscending to the divine and luminous.\nWhere life and nature first emerge,\nWhere emotions and intentions take root,\nWhere advance and retreat, response and influence unfold,\nWhere breath and movement bend and stretch—\nHe aligned these with Heaven and Earth,\nExamined them through Yin and Yang,\nUnfolding transformations from beginning to end,\nWhere all things find their place.\nHe penetrated the subtle and reached the profound,\nTo perceive the natural order.\n\nCondensing the essentials and extending the categories,\nHe recorded two *jīng* scrolls,\nArticulating Heaven’s intent,\nRevealing Earth’s heart,\nTo govern the realm,\nTo nurture all things and the people.\n\nEach chapter has its inner and outer layers,\nUnchangeable in their order.\nWhen a chapter is complete, its structure is whole—\nLike a root and its stem.\nThe words follow one another in sequence,\nNeither above nor below can be altered.\nWidely spreading the Dao and virtue,\nLike the dragon and the *lín* [unicorn].\n\nAdd a single character, and it becomes a wart or excrescence;\nSubtract a single word, and it becomes a scar or ulcer.\nThus, \"great\" precedes \"small\"—this is the highest principle.\nTo record the Dao and expound virtue is called a *jīng*.\n\nAt its beginning, \"upper virtue does not virtue,\"\nFor transformation arises from the Dao,\nYet the Dao does not claim dominion over it.\nHence, he entrusted it to the \"one of old times.\"\n\n「In ancient times, the *One* [得一] was attained—\nIts movement stems from *contrary action* [反行],\nAnd only those of high innate nature can truly perceive it,\nThus it was entrusted to the *superior sage* [上士].\n\nThe *superior sage* has lofty and keen insight,\nDeep and distant understanding alone,\nDisdaining the world and holding all things lightly,\nHe bears only the *Dao* [道] on his shoulders,\nThus it was entrusted to *Dao generating the One* [道生一].\n\n*Dao generating the One* is supreme emptiness without name,\nReceiving the primal *hun* [混冥],\nRefining the clear and the turbid,\nMolding the *Great Harmony* [太和],\nThus it was entrusted to *the utmost softness under heaven* [天下至柔].\n\n*The utmost softness under heaven* is subtle and formless,\nPiercing the firm and penetrating the distant,\nConquering all without defeat,\nThus it was entrusted to *possessing named wealth and goods* [身有名货].\n\nTo possess named wealth and goods brings strength and power,\nYet strength and power invite calamity,\nThus it was entrusted to *Great Completion* [大成].\n\n*Great Completion* is like emptiness,\nVoid of named wealth and goods,\nAll things harmonize and communicate,\nThus it was entrusted to *the world with the Dao* [天下有道].\n\n*The world with the Dao* rests with the sovereign,\nThe sovereign without desire sees all things preserved,\nThus it was entrusted to *not stepping outside the door* [不出户].\n\nBy not stepping outside the door, one knows the life and fate of all the people,\nReceiving them in harmony and resting in ease,\nThus it was entrusted to *daily learning brings increase* [为学日益].\n\nTo daily learn brings increase,\nYet words arise and affairs multiply, exhausting the spirit and harming the people,\nThus it was entrusted to *the Sage has no mind* [圣人无心].\n\n*The Sage has no mind*,\nUniting with the people’s *shen* [神],\nCautiously preserving their life and fate,\nReturning to the primal *zhen* [素真],\nThus it was entrusted to *born and enter death* [出生入死].\n\nTo be born and enter death,\nEvery movement depletes the spirit,\nDiscarding the non-returning for the returning,\nCannot long endure,\nThus it was entrusted to *Dao generating life* [道生之].\n\n*Dao generating life* is through emptiness and nothingness,\nWhere all things are preserved,\nSilent and still, unmoving,\nNothing it refuses,\nThus it was entrusted to *the world has a beginning* [天下有始].\n\n*The world has a beginning*,\nNon-action as its core,\nTo penetrate all affairs without confusion,\nTo know all without limitation,\nThus it was entrusted to *let me have knowledge* [使我有知].\n\n*Let me have knowledge*,\nThe *Dao* refined and practiced,\nFear of losing the natural order,\nBringing ruin to descendants,\nThus it was entrusted to *good foundation* [善建].\n\nTo *good foundation* with virtue,\nConnecting with all things,\nBlessing future generations,\nFlowing to the ends and flourishing,\nThus it was entrusted to *the virtuous sage* [含德之士].\n\n*The virtuous sage*,\nEmbodied in the *Dao* and walking in the *shen* [神],\nLike an infant—innocent and unknowing,\nThus it was entrusted to *the knowing do not speak* [知者不言].\n\n*The knowing do not speak*,\nThe *yīnyáng* [阴阳] subtly transform,\nInternally rectifying the self,\nThe self extending to the family,\nThe family extending to the people,\nThus it was entrusted to *govern the realm* [政治国].\n\nTo govern with rectitude,\nWithout decrees yet all things move,\nForeign lands and customs come without command,\nThus it was entrusted to *square yet not cutting* [方而不割].\n\n*Square yet not cutting*,\nAll things preserved whole,\nConquering all without defeat,\nThe *Dao* of heaven shines great,\nThus it was entrusted to *rule the great realm* [治大国].\n\nThe ruler of the great realm must not act greatly nor do greatly,\nGreat actions and deeds bring great disorder and turmoil—then ruin,\nThus it was entrusted to *the great realm* [大国].\n\n*The great realm* is naturally advantageous,\nAll under heaven desire it,\nCalmness below brings return,\nFrenzy above breeds war,\nThus it was entrusted to *harmonizing with things* [道物].\n\n*Harmonizing with things* is firm and steady,\nThose who attain it are enlightened,\nThose who treasure it are preserved,\nThose who guard it are profound,\nThus it was entrusted to *non-action* [为无为].\n\n*Non-action* makes the transformations effortless,\nThings flourish unseen—yet all things grow,\nThus it was entrusted to *its ease in holding* [其安易持].\n\nBefore signs appear, plans are easy,\nHolding to it like the simple,\nNo visible affairs yet all calamities vanish,\nAll blessings come naturally,\nThus it was entrusted to *the ancient Way* [古之为道].\n\n*The ancient Way* is to keep the people simple,\nCutting off extremes and eradicating roots,\nSealing the gates of knowledge,\nThus it was entrusted to *the rivers and seas* [江海].\n\n*The rivers and seas* know no limits,\nEmpty and tranquil, dwelling in the lowly,\nTo receive all the valleys,\nThus it was entrusted to *the world calls me greatly unlike* [天下谓我大似不肖].\n\n*The unlike* Way uniquely aligns with heaven’s heart,\nRaising armies and moving the people,\nInvincible and undefeated,\nThus it was entrusted to *the use of arms* [用兵].\n\n*The use of arms* follows heaven’s patterns and responds to human needs,\nArising from its root,\nNot from my own will,\nThus it was entrusted to *my words are easily known* [吾言易知].\n\n*My words are easily known*,\nWithout wisdom or understanding,\nWithout speech or affairs,\nLetting things act naturally,\nThus it was entrusted to *knowing the unknown* [知不知].\n\n*Knowing the unknown*,\nDiscarding the mind and discarding intent,\nBorn yet like death,\nPreserved yet like loss,\nAbandoning my clever artifices,\nTo pursue calamity and misfortune,\nThus it was entrusted to *the people do not fear authority* [民不畏威].\n\n*The people do not fear authority*,\nLightly shunning prohibitions and easily entering,\nTrapped in officialdom,\nTheir great fate severed from heaven,\nThus it was entrusted to *daring to be bold* [勇於敢].\n\n*Daring to be bold* stirs the heart of the thief,\nTaking life and losing principle,\nThe law decays and the state perishes,\nThus it was entrusted to *the people do not fear death* [民不畏死].\n\n*The people do not fear death*,\nDesires unchecked and prohibitions ignored,\nFollowing their emotions and inclinations,\nTo reach poverty and destitution,\nThus it was entrusted to *the people’s hunger* [人之饥也].\n\n*The people’s hunger*,\nHeavy taxes and excessive levies,\nGreed for plunder, ceaseless scheming,\nHarshness and rigidity, seizing life,\nThus it was entrusted to *the people’s life* [人之生也].\n\n*The people’s life*,\nSoft and weak yet fearing reverence,\nHarmonious and pure, subtle and refined,\nKeen and bright with daily learning,\nIn death, they become harsh and rigid,\nThus it was entrusted to *the Way of heaven* [天之道].\n\n*The Way of heaven* diminishes fullness and supplements emptiness,\nNurtures the soft and compliant,\nOverthrows the firm and shatters the rigid,\nThus it was entrusted to *nothing under heaven is softer and weaker than water* [天下莫柔弱於水].\n\n*Water*, though soft and weak,\nCan overcome the firm and strong,\nResting in the subtle and delighting in the small,\nIn peril it finds its ease,\nThus it was entrusted to *the small realm* [小国].\n\n*The small realm*’s sovereign,\nForm is empty, power is weak,\nLife depends on neighbors,\nThus it was entrusted to *the trustworthy* [信者].\n\n*The trustworthy* are aided by all the people,\nAnd preserved by ministers and generals,\nHeavened by earth and sky,\nAnd assisted by the *Dao* and virtue.\n\nZhuangzi said: In the past, when Laozi composed the *Jīng* [经],\nHe recorded the principles of transformation,\n*Dao* and *virtue* as its mother,\nThe *Jīng* listed first,\nHeaven and earth as its model.\n\nThe *upper jīng* corresponds to heaven,\nThe *lower jīng* corresponds to earth.\nEight chapters for the *yin* Way,\nNine chapters for the *yang* Way,\nUsing *yin* to follow *yang*,\nThus seventy-two chapters.\nBeginning with *yang* to follow *yin*,\nThus divided into upper and lower.\nWith eight chapters for the five *xíng* [行],\nThus the upper *jīng* has forty chapters before it begins anew.»\n\n「With four *xíng* [行] and eight chapters,\nThus the lower *jīng* [经] has thirty-two chapters before it concludes.\n\nThe *yang* Way is odd, the *yin* Way even,\nHence the upper *jīng* precedes and the lower *jīng* follows;\nThe *yang* Way is vast, the *yin* Way confined,\nThus the upper *jīng* contains many, the lower few;\nThe *yang* Way moves leftward, the *yin* Way rightward,\nSo the upper *jīng* follows in succession, the lower reverses its course.\n\nIn reverse and succession, they intermingle as one form,\nIn profound obscurity, they merge into chaos—\nThe *Dao* [道] as their central sovereign,\nWith repeated seals and verifications to reveal their threads.\n\nThe lower *jīng* is the door,\nThe upper *jīng* is the frame.\n\nThe wise discern its efficacy in the *jīng*,\nAnd thus grasp the numbers of heaven and earth,\nThe cycles of *yin* and *yang*,\nThe pairing of husband and wife,\nThe bond of parent and child,\nThe rites of lord and subject—\nAnd all things unfold in harmony.\n\n**Yán Jūn Píng** [严君平] of the **Zhuāng** [庄] clan spoke of the *jīng* titles—\nHe was a native of **Chéngdū** [成都], in the commandery of **Shǔ** [蜀],\nAnd since his surname was **Zhuāng** [庄], he was thus called **Zhuāngzi** [庄子].\n\nDuring the **Chānghé** [章和] era of the **Eastern Hàn** [东汉],\n**Bān Gōng** [班固] composed the *Hànshū* [汉书],\nBut to avoid the taboo of Emperor **Míng** [明], he altered it to **Yán** [严];\nBoth **Zhuāng** [庄] and **Yán** [严] were common terms in ancient and modern times.\n\n**Jūn Píng** [君平] was born in the middle of the **Western Hàn** [西汉],\nWhen **Wáng Mǎng** [王莽] usurped the throne,\nHe withdrew into seclusion during the **Yǒnghé** [炀和] era,\nTruly a **zhēnrén** [真人] of the ancient age.\n\nThe *Moral Dao/Way True Classic* [道德真经] *Zhǐguī* [指归] consists of volumes one to six (missing),\nThe *Moral Dao/Way True Classic* [道德真经] *Zhǐguī* [指归] volume seven.\n\nThe **Commandery of Shǔ** [蜀郡] **Yán Zūn** [严遵], styled **Jūn Píng** [君平], compiled the *Gǔshénzǐ Zhù* [谷神子注].\n\nThe **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] does not **virtue/power** [德] (Chapter#1).\nThe **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] does not **virtue/power** [德], its virtue/power is **mysterious** [玄]—\nThus, it is said that he who has virtue/power, **virtues/powers** [德] without return.\nThe **lowest virtue/power** [下德] does not lose virtue/power—\nIts virtue/power is **heard** [可闻], thus it is said that he who lacks virtue/power, **virtues/powers** [德] **recur upon the self** [反身].\n\nThe **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] acts without **doing** [为], and all things follow **naturally** [自然]—\nYet nothing is left undone; its merit is **ascribed to Heaven** [归天].\nThe **lowest virtue/power** [下德] **does** [为]—\nYet it exhausts the **spirit** [精神], and its merit is **ascribed to man** [归人].\n\nThe **uppermost benevolence** [上仁] **does** [为]—\nYet it adds **favor and love** [恩爱], and does not **do** [为] as the **ascetic** [禅] of the **sages and worthies** [圣贤].\nThe **uppermost righteousness** [上义] **does** [为]—\nYet it establishes **order and limits** [有民] for the people, and its merit is **transmitted to descendants** [传子孙].\nThe **uppermost propriety** [上礼] **does** [为]—\nYet it **regulates rites and origins** [节事原], and none respond—\nIt loses the **people’s hearts** [人心], then **rolls up one’s sleeves** [攘臂] and **enforces harmony and kinship** [强和亲].\nThus, when the **Dao/Way** is lost, the **virtue/power** [德] **name** [名] first **sprouts** [萌].\nWhen **virtue/power** [德] is lost, **benevolence and love** [仁爱] **take form** [形].\nWhen **benevolence and love** [仁] is lost, **righteous distinctions** [义分] and **roles** [职] become **clear** [明].\nWhen **righteousness** [义] is lost, **rites and jade offerings** [礼玉帛] are **performed** [行].\n**Rites** [礼], then, are the **thin outer layer of loyalty and trust** [忠信之薄], the **waning of virtue/power** [衰亡].\nThey are the **beginning of disorder** [乱之首], the **gateway to craft and deceit** [巧伪门].\n**Preassigned roles** [前职] are **thus established** [预设然], yet **the Dao/Way’s refinement** [道之华化] has not yet **been heard** [闻].\nThey mark the **beginning of foolishness** [愚之始] and the **source of confusion** [惑乱根].\nThus, the **true man** [大丈夫] **embodies the Dao/Way** [体道] and **rules** [君].\nHe **dwells in its substance** [处其厚], **embracing loyalty and trust** [含忠信].\nHe does not **dwell in its thinness** [不处其薄], **abandoning rites** [去礼].\nHe **dwells in its reality** [处其实], **moving with cause** [动有因].\nHe does not **dwell in its refinement** [不处其华], **avoiding premature knowledge** [不前识].\nHe **seeks this and discards that** [去彼取此], **pursuing it within himself** [求诸身].\n\n**Zhǐguī** [指归]:\nThe **origin** [所由] of **Heaven and Earth** [天地],\nThe **source** [所以] of **all things** [物类],\nThe **Dao/Way** [道] is its **root** [元],\n**Virtue/power** [德] is its **beginning** [始],\n**Divine clarity** [神明] is its **core** [宗],\n**Great Harmony** [太和] is its **ancestor** [祖].\nThe **Dao/Way** [道] has **depth and subtlety** [深微],\n**Virtue/power** [德] has **thickness and thinness** [厚薄],\n**Divine essence** [神] has **purity and turbidity** [清浊],\n**Harmony** [和] has **height and depth** [高下].\nThe **pure** [清] is **Heaven** [天], the **turbid** [浊] is **Earth** [地],\nThe **yang** [阳] is **male** [男], the **yin** [阴] is **female** [女].\n**Humans and things** [人物] **borrow and receive** [禀假],\nTheir **endowment** [受] has **much and little** [多少],\nTheir **nature** [性] has **refinement and coarseness** [精粗],\nTheir **fate** [命] has **length and brevity** [长短],\nTheir **emotions** [情] have **beauty and ugliness** [美恶],\nTheir **intentions** [意] have **greatness and smallness** [大小].\nSome become **petty men** [小人], some become **gentlemen** [君子].\nTheir **transformations** [变化] and **separations** [分离]\nAre **divided and judged** [剖判] by **categories** [数等].\nThus there are **Dao/Way men** [道人], **virtue/power men** [德人],\n**benevolent men** [仁人], **righteous men** [义人], **proper men** [礼人].\n\nDare I ask: What **actions** [行] does that **man** [彼人] take\nTo earn such **contradictory titles** [殊谬名号] as these?\n**Zhuāngzi** [庄子] said:\n**Emptiness and non-action** [虚无无为], **opening and guiding** [开导] all things—\nThis is called the **Dao/Way man** [道人].\n**Purity and stillness** [清静], **responding naturally** [因应], yet **doing nothing** [无所不为]—\nThis is called the **virtue/power man** [德人].\n**Compassionate love for all things** [兼爱], **boundless universal application** [博施无穷]—\nThis is called the **benevolent man** [仁人].\n**Rightly ordering names and realities** [理名正实], **acting with righteousness** [处事之义]—\nThis is called the **righteous man** [义人].\n**Modesty and withdrawal** [谦退], **words and yielding** [辞让], **respectfully guarding harmony** [敬以守和]—\nThis is called the **proper man** [礼人].\n\nAll these five types **seek longevity** [乐长生], **revere virtue/power’s thickness** [尊厚德], **value high renown** [贵高名].\nEach **cautiously refines his emotions and nature** [慎其情性],\n**Trusts in his innate wisdom** [任其聪明],\n**Follows his strengths** [道其所长],\n**Returns to his ease** [归其所安].\nTheir **endeavors and pursuits** [趋务] **diverge and scatter** [舛驰],\nSome **negate** [否], some **affirm** [然],\nTheir **transformations** [变化] **differ in direction** [殊方],\nTheir **titles** [建号] **vary endlessly** [万差].\n\n**Virtue/power** [德] has **superiority and inferiority** [优劣],\nThe **world** [世] has **prosperity and decline** [盛衰],\n**Winds and customs** [风离] **drift apart** [俗异],\n**People’s fates** [民命] **differ** [不同].\nThus some **drift boundless and profound** [溟涬玄寥] yet **lack a name** [无名],\nSome **are enveloped in dim radiance** [蒙澒芒芒] yet are called **Emperor** [皇],\nSome **are vast and overflowing** [汪然漭泛] yet are called **Sovereign** [帝],\nSome **are bright and expansive** [廓然昭昭] yet are called **King** [王],\nSome **are distant yet harmoniously varied** [远通参差] yet are called **Lord** [伯].\nThese are the **names that can be spoken** [可言者].\n\nYet **Lord** [伯] is not **Lord** [伯],\n**King** [王] is not **King** [王],\n**Sovereign** [帝] is not **Sovereign** [帝],\n**Emperor** [皇] is not **Emperor** [皇],\n**Being** [有] is not **Being** [有],\n**Non-being** [无] is not **Non-being** [无].\n**Ten thousand transformations** [千变], **ten thousand variations** [万化]—\nThey cannot be **reckoned** [为计].\n**Layer upon layer, countless eons** [重累亿万]—\nThey cannot be **named** [为名].\n\nHow then can one **clarify** [明] this?\nWhen **one changes a dynasty and becomes King** [易姓而王], **sealing at Tàishān** [封於太山], **ascending at Liángfù** [禅於梁父]—\nThere are **seventy-two instances** [七十有二] of this.\nYet some **have signs and portents** [形兆] **so indistinct** [圻堮仿髴] as to be **unrecognizable** [不可识]—\nThey cannot be **spoken of** [称言].\nAre these not cases where **nature and fate differ** [性命不同], **merits and titles do not align** [功名不齐]?\nNo, this is not so.\n\nThus, the **ruler of uppermost virtue/power** [上德之君]\n**embodies the Dao/Way** [体道] and **preserves** [存],\nHis **divine essence** [神] **harmonizes with transformation** [与化伦],\nHis **virtue/power** [德] **moves the mysterious depths** [动玄冥].\nHe **rules the world** [天下王], yet **none witness or hear** [莫有见闻].\nHis **virtue/power** [德] **returns to all things** [归万物],\nAnd all say it is **natural** [自然].\nThe **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] does not **virtue/power** [德]—\nIt **aligns with the Dao/Way** [与道同].\n\nThe **ruler of lowest virtue/power** [下德之君]\n**embodies virtue/power** [体德] and **acts** [行],\nHis **divine essence** [神] **wanders with transformation** [与化游],\nHis **virtue/power** [德] **matches Heaven’s grandeur** [配皇天].\nHe **rules the world** [天下王], yet some **see or hear** [或见或闻],\nHis **virtue/power** [德] **flows to all things** [流万物],\nThen **recurs upon his ruler** [复反其君].\nThe **lowest virtue/power** [下德] does not lose virtue/power—\nIt **virtues/powers** [德德] itself.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe **ruler of uppermost virtue/power** [上德之君]\n**receives in nature** [性受] the **Dao/Way’s subtle intricacies** [道之纤妙],\nHis **fate** [命] **obtains the One’s refined essence** [一之精微].\nHis **nature and fate** [性命] **harmonize with nature** [同於自然],\nHis **emotions and intentions** [情意] **embody divine clarity** [体於神明],\nHis **actions** [动作] **align with Great Harmony** [伦於太和],\nHis **taking and discarding** [取舍] **conforms to Heaven’s will** [合乎天心].\nHis **divine essence** [神] **thinks of nothing** [无所思],\nHis **will** [志] **worries about nothing** [无所虑],\nHis **wisdom and clarity** [聪明] are **mysteriously distant** [玄远],\nHis **stillness** [寂] is **emptily void** [泊空虚].\nHis **movements** [动] are **formless** [若无形],\nHis **stillness** [静] is **as yet unborn** [若未生],\nHis **merits** [功] are **like Heaven and Earth** [若天地],\nHis **deeds** [事] are **as a babe’s brother** [如婴兄].\nHe **abandons form** [遗形] and **hides his will** [藏志],\n**Aligns with the Dao/Way** [与道相得],\n**Boundless and profound** [溟涬], **enveloped in dim radiance** [蒙澒].\n**None in the world know him** [天下莫知],\n**He drifts beyond the four directions** [潼溶方外],\n**Soaring to the utmost distance** [翱翔至远].\n**Yin and yang** [阴阳] **serve as his ministers** [为使],\n**Ghosts and spirits** [鬼神] **plot his counsel** [为谋].\nHis **body** [身] **transforms with the Dao/Way** [与道变],\n**Above and below are endless** [上下无穷].\nHe **advances and retreats** [进退], **shifts and adjusts** [推移],\n**Ever accompanying transformation** [常与化俱].\n\nThus, **serene and effortless** [恬淡无为],\nHis **virtue/power** [德] **overflows the mysterious realm** [德盈于玄域].\n**Silent and profound** [玄默], **still and boundless** [寥],\nHis **transformation** [化] **flows to the limitless** [流於无极].\nHis **favor** [恩] is **incalculable** [不可量],\nHis **virtue/power’s thickness** [厚] is **unfathomable** [不可测].\nHe **encompasses all** [兼包大营],\nHis **benevolence reaches ten thousand lands** [泽及万国].\nHis **wisdom is insufficient** [知不足] to **match his transformation** [伦其化],\nHis **words are insufficient** [言不足] to **guide the customs** [导其俗].\n**All under Heaven** [天下] **chatter and murmur** [咮咮喁喁],\nYet all **receive his transformation** [蒙其化] and **are enveloped in his harmony** [被其和].\n\nIf such a one **originates from nothing** [元无],\n**He vanishes and none know who made him so** [绝而不知为之者何谁].\n\nThis is called the **uppermost virtue/power** [上德] **does nothing yet nothing is left undone** [无为而无以为].\n\nThe **ruler of lowest virtue/power** [下德之君]\n**Receives in nature** [性受] the **Dao/Way’s righteous breath** [道之正气],\nHis **fate** [命] **obtains the One’s middle-lower essence** [一之下中].\nHis **nature and fate** [性命] **compare with nature** [比於自然],\nHis **emotions and intentions** [情意] **approach divine clarity** [几於神明],\nHis **actions** [动作] **nearly align with Great Harmony** [近於太和],\nHis **taking and discarding** [取舍] **embody utmost virtue/power** [体於至德].\nHe **entrusts his divine essence** [托神] to the **Great Void** [太虚],\n**Hides his roots** [隐根] in the **mysterious depths** [玄冥].\nHis **movements** [动] **return to softness and weakness** [反柔弱],\nHis **stillness** [静] **returns to peace and harmony** [归和平].\nHe **loads the compass and measures with the square** [载规履矩],\n**Gazes into the utmost purity** [镜视太清].\nHis **transformations** [变化] are **dim and indistinct** [惚恍],\nHis **responses** [因应] are **formless** [无形],\nHis **refinement** [希夷] is

**none respond**.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThough **words are abundant and appearance splendid**,\n**Sincerity does not reach the heart**.\n\nThus, the **foundation of emperors and kings**,\n**Dao is the primordial origin**.\nWhen **Dao is lost, virtue takes its place**,\nWhen **virtue is lost, benevolence takes its place**,\nWhen **benevolence is lost, righteousness takes its place**,\nWhen **righteousness is lost, rites take its place**,\nWhen **rites are lost, chaos takes its place**.\n\nThese five stages—\n**Dao governs as one body**,\nYet **each age’s ruler** has its strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThus, what is done is not what one truly desires,\nWhat is sought is not what one truly obtains—\nThey neglect the natural way and instead pursue petty trifles.\n\nNow, the practice of rites,\nThough outwardly refined and inwardly discordant,\nThough splendid in appearance yet hollow in substance,\nThough elaborate in form yet decaying at its root—\nWhen rites grow thin, loyalty is neglected;\nWhen authority is light, threats lose their weight;\nWhen trust fails to reach righteousness,\nWhen virtue does not encompass benevolence,\nThen governance becomes superficial,\nAnd chaos becomes the origin.\nDeceit and falsehood arise,\nAnd disputes spring from resentment.\n\nTherefore, rites and music are established,\nCalendars and garments are reformed,\nProper conduct in advance and retreat is prescribed,\nEvery action follows fixed norms,\nAnticipating events to discern gain and loss.\nYet these are but the outward flourishing of Dao,\nThe superficial aspects of virtue—\nTemporary laws, partial techniques—\nNot suited to govern an endless age\nOr harmonize diverse customs.\n\nThus, the roots of calamity and confusion lie here,\nThe beginning of folly and delusion lies here.\nWhat is called foresight—\nThe outward adornment of Dao,\nThe first step toward ignorance.\n\nHow may this be made clear?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"The response of Heaven and Earth follows events,\nAnd events respond to change.\nChange has no fixed time,\nThus actions cannot be predetermined,\nNor can change be preordained—\nJust as pain cannot be pre-moistened,\nNor itching pre-broken,\nFive flavors cannot be measured by bushels,\nNor zithers tuned by inches.*\n\nRites are suited to their time;\nWhen time shifts, rites must diverge.\nTo impose the rites of one era\nUpon an endless custom—\nIt is like gluing a pillar to a boat,\nOr tuning a zither while holding a ruler—\nThus, it cannot endure the long term.\n\nTherefore, the most subtle subtlety cannot be spoken,\nThe most wondrous wonder cannot be transmitted.\nPerfect loyalty and trust\nCannot be adorned by rites;\nTimely harmony and precedence\nCannot be preserved by calculation.\n\nThus, the keenly insightful and broadly learned,\nWith wisdom arising from all directions,\nPerceive the threads of yin,\nGrasp the patterns of yang,\nUnderstand the Dao of spirits and gods,\nComprehend the principles of all things.\nGazing upward, they see Heaven’s embrace;\nGazing downward, they see Earth’s embrace.\nTeaching the people without ceasing,\nActing without end—\nYet achieving balance through this—\nIs not what is heard.\n\nTo speak of deliberate knowledge is not the method for attaining Great Peace.\n\nCompare the trust of all things in their ruler\nTo the dwelling of the divine in the body,\nOr court well-water in the courtyard.\nWater cannot be *made* clear by force,\nThe divine cannot be *thought* into tranquility.\nBetween Heaven and Earth, all things flourish together—\nNot by artificial means can peace be achieved.\nThus, the noble transformation of the great person\nEmbodies Dao and embraces virtue,\nPierces the boundless void with clarity,\nCompletes yet seems incomplete,\nPossesses yet seems lacking—\nIn stillness, formless;\nIn motion, soundless.\nLoyal and trustworthy, yet unassuming,\nIgnoring the trappings of authority,\nDoing nothing yet achieving all,\nLike dragon or serpent.\n\nRejecting rites and abandoning righteousness,\nReturning to the state of non-action;\nAdapting to the times and responding to change,\nWithout pre-set rules.\nHolding the subtle and grasping the essential,\nMoving with the times;\nFlexing and yielding in harmony,\nSurviving with change.\nCalamity and blame arise from within;\nA hundred blessings and myriad fortunes\nAre unattached to others.\n\nAbandon that, embrace this.\nObtain the Chapter.\n\nThe ancient ones who attained the One\nUsed it as a foundation for life.\nThe heavens, attaining the One,\nManifest purity, vigor, and rectitude.\nThe earth, attaining the One,\nFinds tranquility, compliance, and right alignment.\nThe spirit, attaining the One,\nBecomes luminous, responsive, and all-pervasive.\nThe valleys, attaining the One,\nOverflow with boundless abundance.\nLords and kings, attaining the One,\nBring harmony and righteous governance to all under heaven.\n\nThe means by which this is achieved\nIs the cessation of contrivance.\nThe heavens, without purity, lack yin and yang—\nThen fear they may fracture and fail to purify.\nThe earth, without tranquility, lacks firmness and softness—\nThen fear it may erupt and fail to settle.\nThe spirit, without responsiveness, lacks relaxation and tension—\nThen fear it may exhaust and fail to persist.\nThe valleys, without overflow, lack fullness and emptiness—\nThen fear they may dry up and fail to brim.\nLords and kings, without righteousness,\nExcessive pride, miserliness, or arrogance—\nAnd those who claim nobility yet neglect the people—\nThen fear their lineage may crumble and their temples topple.\n\nThus, the noble is rooted in the humble,\nAnd disgrace precedes honor.\nThe exalted is founded upon the lowly,\nAnd greatness arises from modesty.\nLords and kings, in their self-proclaimed restraint,\nAre solitary and impoverished, lacking abundance,\nTheir names are obscure and their forms diminished—\nIs this not the way to take the humble as root\nAnd preserve the body within?\n\nNot so! Their affairs are not the One.\nHence, they fashion the cart from non-cart,\nAnd the thing from non-thing,\nNot wishing to be busy like the solitary and obscure,\nNor to stand out like the stark and prominent.\n\nThe *Dao*’s movement and transformation\nAre the principle of change—\nThe weak, its harmonious application.\n\nThe things of heaven and earth,\nHaving form, arise from causes and conditions;\nHaving life, arise from the void’s beginning.\nThe One is the child of *Dao*,\nThe mother of luminous intelligence,\nThe source of great harmony,\nThe ancestor of heaven and earth.\n\nTo the spirit, it is non-existence;\nTo the *Dao*, it is existence.\nTo the spirit, it is vast;\nTo the *Dao*, it is minute.\nThus, in its manifestation,\nIt is both empty and real,\nBoth nonexistent and existent,\nRound yet not circular,\nSquare yet not measured.\nIt stretches without end,\nMoves without trace,\nNeither floats nor sinks,\nNeither proceeds nor halts—\nIt acts yet does not act,\nIt bestows yet does not give,\nIts changes are boundless,\nIts principles are contained in the whole.\n\nThe void of non-void,\nThe beginning of beginnings,\nNeither outer nor inner,\nMingled in primordial chaos—\nBlurred and indistinct,\nIt may turn left or right.\nIn emptiness, it abides as constant,\nIn stillness, it reigns supreme.\nIt flows through the ten thousand heavens,\nIt permeates the myriad lands.\nAll things arise from it,\nYet it bears no form or sign.\n\nThe One alone remains,\nIn mysterious solitude,\nAll-encompassing without gaps,\nUnchanging in simplicity.\nMingled in dark clarity,\nIt lacks nothing.\nIt molds the luminous spirit,\nYet does not share its nature.\nIt shapes the heavens and earth,\nYet does not dwell among them.\n\nIt receives without depletion,\nIt gathers without hoarding—\nNeither crooked nor straight,\nNeither first nor last.\nIts grandeur is boundless,\nIts depths unfathomable.\nAbove and below cannot conceal it,\nIts currents cannot be measured.\nIt spreads and nourishes,\nRadiant and unceasing—\nNourishing without mingling,\nTransforming without joining.\nIt does not create, yet all things arise;\nIt does not act, yet all things are accomplished.\nBeyond heaven and earth,\nWithin the smallest measure,\nThe breath of *qi* differs,\nThe forms and kinds are diverse—\nYet all attain the One’s essence to live,\nAnd all fulfill its transformation to thrive.\n\nThus, the One is the guiding thread for all things,\nAnd the supreme principle of change.\nIt is the standard for all directions,\nAnd the balance for all variations.\nThe One is its name,\nVirtue its title,\nNon-existence its dwelling,\nNon-action its work,\nFormlessness its measure,\nReturn its great cycle,\nHarmony its end,\nThe weak its use.\nThus, to know the One,\nAll changes are inexhaustible,\nAll transformations are unerring;\nTo fail to know the One,\nFortunes wax and wane,\nThose who rule nations perish,\nThose who guard their lives are lost.\n\nTherefore, the ancients who attained the One:\nThe heavens, in their nature, attained the One’s purity,\nYet what the heavens do is not purity.\nWithout heart or intent,\nWithout action or deed,\nThey follow their nature.\nMysterious and silent,\nWithout container or shape,\nThey preserve their life.\nThus, yin and yang arise spontaneously,\nChange unfolds naturally—\nSo they move with firm yet yielding vigor,\nAchieving their height,\nLuminous and clear,\nGreatly harmonious,\nPure and true, unmingled—\nThe *Daoyi* stands grand,\nRadiant and resplendent,\nAll things draw from its beginning,\nClouds and mists ascend,\nForms and kinds flow forth,\nThe primal breath of life—\nMysterious and boundless,\nWithout fail, it covers all.\n\nThe heavens attain the One with purity.\n\nThe earth, in its nature, attains the One’s tranquility,\nYet what the earth does is not tranquility.\nWithout knowledge or perception,\nWithout action or deed,\nThey follow their nature.\nWithout measure or number,\nWithout worry or gain,\nThey preserve their life.\nThus, mountains and rivers arise spontaneously,\nFirmness and softness align naturally—\nSo they remain steadfast yet yielding,\nDirect yet harmonious,\nVast and limitless,\nDeep and serene,\nAll things draw from them to live,\nNone fail to be sustained.\n\nThe earth attains the One with tranquility.\n\nThe spirit, in its nature, attains the One’s responsiveness,\nYet what the spirit does is not responsiveness.\nWithout thought or deliberation,\nWithout action or deed,\nThey follow their nature.\nWithout schemes or plans,\nWithout echoes or beginnings,\nThey preserve their life.\nThus, ebb and flow arise spontaneously,\nPreservation and extinction align naturally—\nSo the aged can return to vigor,\nThe dead can revive,\nThe trapped can find release,\nThe ruined can flourish anew—\nChange knows no limit,\nReturn is endless,\nAll kinds entrust themselves to it,\nNone stray from its core.\n\nThe spirit attains the One with responsiveness.\n\nThe valleys, in their nature, attain the One with fullness,\nYet what the valleys do is not fullness.\nWithout desire or seeking,\nWithout action or deed,\nThey follow their nature.\nWithout kindness or righteousness,\nWithout giving or bestowing,\nThey preserve their life.\nThus, solid and void arise spontaneously,\nFlourishing and decline align naturally—\nSo they steam the mountains and flow the marshes,\nBecoming pathways of virtue,\nTrickling yet ceaseless,\nEndless yet uninterrupted,\nRadiant and boundless,\nExtending far without end,\nFilling the rivers and seas,\nDeep and vast beyond measure.\n\n「The valleys attain the One with fullness.\nThe lords and kings’ nature attains the One’s *正* (orthogonality/rectitude), yet what lords and kings do is not rectitude.\nDiscarding the heart and the will,\nWithout action or deed,\nThey follow their nature;\nDiscarding sharpness and brilliance,\nIn emptiness and stillness, they respond naturally,\nTo preserve their life.\n\nThus, harmony arises spontaneously,\nAll things align naturally—\nSo they embody the Dao and harmonize with virtue,\nUniting with Heaven’s principles,\nClasping the spirit and treading upon harmony,\nEnveloping all things,\nTheir influence transforms the myriad,\nFilling the six directions with abundance,\nTheir virtue guides Heaven and Earth,\nTheir clarity shines like sun and moon,\nTheir rule governs the world and directs the customs,\nMaking all under Heaven one.\n\nLords and kings attain the One to establish rectitude for all under Heaven.\nIn all these five cases—\nAttaining the One and acting upon it—\nThey flourish without decline,\nAchieve without deficiency,\nFlow without interruption,\nGlow without extinction.\n\nWhy is this so?\nNature and life are spontaneous,\nTheir movement follows the One.\n\nThus, if Heaven acts,\nIts movement does not follow the One,\nIt will gain elevation yet lose stability,\nGain purity yet risk fracture,\nAnd the yin and yang will stray from their proper courses,\nThe fundamental principles will slacken,\nThe harmonious *qi* will be blocked—\nThe Three Lights will vanish,\nThunder and lightning will act in disorder,\nAnd all things will lose their way.\nHeaven, without stillness, will fear fracture.\n\nIf Earth acts,\nIts movement does not follow the One,\nIt will gain straightness yet lose flexibility,\nGain tranquility yet risk eruption—\nMountains and rivers will crumble,\nThe firm and yielding will be twisted,\nThe *qi*’s transformation will not flow,\nThe Five Phases will be impaired,\nAll grains will wither,\nAnd living beings will suffer pestilence.\nEarth, without tranquility, will fear eruption.\n\nIf the spirit acts,\nIts movement does not follow the One,\nIt will gain openness yet fall into constraint,\nGain responsiveness yet risk exhaustion—\nChange will lose its order,\nMovement will stagnate and deplete,\nThose who flourish will perish,\nThose who relax will die.\nThe spirit, without responsiveness, will fear exhaustion.\n\nIf the valleys act,\nTheir movement does not follow the One,\nThey will gain existence yet risk annihilation,\nGain fullness yet risk depletion—\nVoid and solid will invert,\nFlows will not enter.\nThe valleys, without fullness, will fear depletion.\n\nLords and kings who act,\nTheir movement does not follow the One,\nThey will gain nobility yet lose humility,\nGain rectitude yet risk downfall—\nIn chaos and confusion,\nActions spring from their own will,\nOfficials stray from the center,\nThey lose their true name and substance,\nThe people do not return,\nAnd Heaven and Earth will sever.\nKings without nobility will fear downfall.\n\nIn all these five cases—\nNature and life, purity and beauty—\nChange reaches its utmost extremes,\nAdvance and retreat, bending and extending,\nNever straying from the proper measure—\nAttaining the One, they endure;\nLosing the One, they perish.\nMuch less so for those who rule the myriad without being sages,\nWho abandon the proper measure and follow their own hearts.\n\nTo uphold the proper measure in action\nIs still not free from blame and calamity,\nMuch less so for those who abandon the measure and follow their hearts—\nThus, they perish in no time.\n\nTherefore, the Dao of Heaven and humanity,\nThe myriad transformations of things—\nThe few become the many,\nThe humble become noble,\nThe high become low,\nThe completed become ruined,\nWhat benefits becomes harm,\nWhat profits becomes injury.\nThose who dwell in opposition find their reversal,\nThose who seek gain lose what they cherish.\nThis is called: *\"Nobility rests upon humility as its foundation,\nElevation rests upon lowliness as its base.\"*\n\nThus, the virtuous ruler and sage sovereign\nHold sway over the people,\nTheir rank is esteemed throughout the world,\nTheir blessings extend to all things,\nTheir virtue encompasses the four seas.\nThe Dao protects them,\nHeaven and Earth assist them,\nAll things return to them,\nGhosts and spirits align with them,\nTheir austerity inspires virtue,\nYet they call themselves solitary and few.\nThis is called: *\"Lords and kings, calling themselves solitary and few, do not attain the valleys.\"*\n\nDwelling in lowliness and guarding modesty,\nEngaging in labor and hardship,\nHumbling their hearts and curbing their wills,\nStriving to place themselves below the people—\nNot claiming nobility, so they command the people’s lives;\nNot claiming elevation, so they remain above the people;\nNot desiring, so they possess all;\nNot acting, so they govern all.\nAmidst the myriad’s confusion,\nTheir own being is uninvolved—\nThus they become the foundation of all.\nThis is not unique to the ruler’s Dao;\nAll affairs are the same.\n\nThe craftsman shaping a carriage,\nMakes it round or square,\nShort or long,\nCurved or straight,\nVertical or horizontal—\nYet all his life he labors,\nAnd in the end, it is not a carriage—\nThus he can complete the carriage and make it usable.\nThis is called: *\"Counting the carriage without making it a carriage, yet achieving its form.\"*\n\nJade, as a thing,\nIs subtle and few;\nYet stone, as a thing,\nIs vast and many.\nMany, hence humble;\nFew, hence noble.\nJade and stone,\nThough born of the same kind,\nFew and many,\nAre either sought or discarded.\nThus, nobility and humility lie in abundance or scarcity,\nSuccess and failure lie in whether one acts or not.\nThus, neither does one desire to be polished like jade,\nNor to be coarse like stone.\n\nTherefore, the sage acts through reversal,\nGuards through harmony,\nAdapts with the times in ascent and descent,\nFollows transformations in things.\nNeither stone nor jade,\nEver dwelling between them—\nNeither excessive nor deficient,\nNeither noble nor humble—\nThe One as their guiding principle,\nThe Dao as their supporting structure.\nThus they can dominate all under Heaven with power that cannot be overcome,\nPreserve all living things with virtue that cannot be measured—\nNoble yet without worry,\nHumble yet without harm,\nElevated yet without peril,\nLowly yet ever more secure,\nDiscerning in reversal,\nReturning to primal silence,\nClear in presence and absence,\nReverting to the first beginning.\n\nWithout acting for themselves,\nTheir spirit and clarity do not falter;\nWithout acting for all under Heaven,\nAll under Heaven aligns with them.\nThis is called: *\"Reversal is the Dao’s movement,\nWeakness is the Dao’s use.\"*\n\nWhy is this so?\nFollowing the Dao in movement,\nConforming to the One in action—\nThe Dao’s utmost subtlety,\nThe One’s greatest simplicity—\nChange arises through reversal,\nHarmony through refinement,\nExistence through non-action.\nHeaven and Earth are born from the Great Harmony,\nThe Great Harmony is born from the Void and Dark.\nThe Void and Dark are the utmost non-being,\nYet the Great Harmony begins with them and generates.\nThe Great Harmony has the seed of being,\nAnd Heaven and Earth draw upon it to begin—\nThis is called: *\"Heaven and Earth, the myriad, are born from being,\nBeing is born from non-being.\"*\n\nThe upper sage hears the Dao and finds it profound and good,\nDiligent in following it, for their nature is near;\nThe middle sage hears the Dao and doubts it shallowly,\nAs if it exists or does not, for their nature is distant;\nThe lower sage hears the Dao and finds it unnatural,\nLaughing at it, for their nature is opposed—\nNot to laugh is insufficient for the Dao;\nThe Dao’s symbols must be displayed.»\n\n「Thus, the sage sets forth the words of *having*—\nTo present the Dao as though in darkness, yet its movement is ceaseless and subtle;\nTo advance the Dao as though in retreat, returning to its origin;\nTo smooth the Dao as though with a file, refining its roots;\nTo uphold the highest virtue like a valley, bestowing it in profound mystery;\nTo display great purity as though in disgrace, appearing unwise;\nTo manifest abundant virtue as though insufficient, leaving no trace to describe;\nTo establish virtue as though by stealth, diminishing the people’s blessings;\nTo reveal true essence as though in error, seeming shallow and lacking;\nTo embody the Dao’s vastness without corners, without crookedness or straightness;\nTo achieve greatness through slow maturation, not by immediate clarity;\nTo produce the grandest sound where voice is scarce, where speech is faint;\nTo manifest the most sublime forms where shape is none, where no setting is made;\nTo conceal the Dao without name, without posthumous titles, without distinction—\n\nOnly the Dao, indeed, is good at lending itself to completion,\nAnd responds to all things.\n\n**Returning to the source:**\nThe Way and virtue of Heaven and Earth each have their own patterns,\nThings have their high and low, *qi* has its short and long.\nEach takes delight in what it delights in,\nSuffers from what it suffers,\nSees what it sees,\nHears what it hears,\nAccepts and rejects with divergent paths#3,\nFears and rejoices in different directions.\n\nThus, the quail and partridge soar high,\nYet their whole day is spent in ceaseless flight,\nWhile their hearts dwell in the humble weeds;\nThe wild goose and swan rise aloft,\nCrossing east and west, spanning thousands and reaching ten thousand,\nYet their hearts dwell in the marshes and ponds;\nThe phoenix and *luan*#4 soar above the ninefold peaks,\nLeisurely in the boundless purity,\nYet they always consider themselves lowly.\n\nStretching their necks, spreading their wings,\nThey skim the azure clouds,\nEclipse the sun and moon,\nSoar high and drift far,\nGo long days without eating,\nTravel the nine regions,\nRest in the eight extremes,\nAnd thus find their true fit.\n\nThe three creatures differ in their ways,\nYet all find joy in their own kind.\n\nTherefore, the boundless source,\nThe ten-thousand-fathom springs,\nWhere the divine dragon takes its rest,\nAnd tiny fish retreat—\nHigh mountains and great mounds,\nDeep forests and vast ravines,\nLush trees with sprawling branches—\nAre where the great birds and tigers and leopards take delight,\nYet where the chickens and dogs recoil in disgust.\n\nAlas, the inherited customs of the Three Dynasties,\nThe rustic scholars and inked literati’s refined styles,\nReciting the *Shijing* and *Shujing*,\nPracticing rituals and etiquette,\nSinging elegies and odes,\nPlucking the *qin* and *se*,\nExalting benevolence and righteousness,\nHonoring purity and clarity,\nStudying past antiquity,\nMastering divination and numerology,\nFixing what is and condemning what is not,\nAchieving personal security and fame,\nWith neighbors preserving their legacy—\nThese are the ways of the middle sage,\nYet abandoned by the upper sage.\n\nIn quiet seclusion and profound contemplation,\nThey strain their minds to comprehend all things,\nFabricate falsehoods and disguise reality,\nSpeak empty words of names and things,\nDash about in pursuit of advancement or retreat,\nAscend or descend, kneel or bow,\nRegulate the rituals of the inner chambers,\nConform to the customs of their age,\nLean or recline, tilt or bow,\nStrive to align with the world’s expectations,\nFlatter the wealthy and honor the noble,\nCater to the masses’ ears and eyes,\nGain esteem and favor from the powerful,\nFollow the trends of the common folk—\nThese are the practices of the lower sage,\nYet rejected by the middle sage.\n\nThus, rules and measures do not harm one another,\nDiverse natures find their own harmony;\nThe wise and saintly are not paired with the unworthy,\nThe foolish and clever do not form a single group.\n\nThe noble take joy in simplicity and tranquility,\nThe petty revel in grand and imposing achievements,\nYet fail to understand the humble dwelling of the common folk,\nNor delight in the deeds of a true gentleman.\n\nBirds and beasts all flourish together,\nEach pursuing its own inclinations;\nScholars of all kinds traverse the world,\nEach finding their own path.\n\nTherefore, they abandon sharp intelligence,\nDiscard clever scheming,\nReturn to true simplicity,\nRoam in the Great Purity,\nHold the world in disdain,\nStand aloof without blemish,\nLet anger and joy not disturb their hearts,\nLet profit and harm not enter their minds,\nTreat noble and base as equal,\nHold life and death in balanced measure,\nAct without striving,\nGaze upon the profound mysteries,\nTheir spirits serene and undefiled,\nEmbrace virtue and contain harmony,\nNaturally reversing the transformations of the world.\n\nThis is what the greatest sages uphold,\nAnd what the upper sages strive for,\nWhile the middle sages are dazzled by it,\nAnd the lower sages laugh at it in derision.\n\nThus, what the middle sages hear is not the utmost beauty,\nAnd what the lower sages see is not the utmost goodness.\nWhat dazzles the middle sages and amuses the lower sages\nIs truly the most beautiful and good of all.\n\nTo lay out grand theories and expound lofty doctrines,\nTo display the natural and exhaust the subtle—\nThen the middle sages are dazzled,\nAnd the lower sages laugh in scorn.\n\nTo float empty words and wander in persuasions,\nTo generate endless variations and schemes,\nTo create blessings and seek advantages,\nTo achieve success and fulfill tasks—\nThen the middle sages debate,\nAnd the lower sages wake to awareness.\n\nThis is not because they delight in calamity and abhor fortune,\nNor because they value misfortune and despise blessings—\nTheir nature is far removed,\nTheir feelings opposed.\n\nIt is as though they were in the Yellow Springs,\nListening to the nine heavens,\nYet so distant and utterly cut off\nThat they cannot see or hear at all.\n\nThe lower sages do not laugh at the great Dao,\nBut the Dao is too lofty to be seen—\nLike playing a drum before an ox,\nThat is why they laugh.\n\nThus, the sage sets forth the words of *having*—\nThose who speak of *having* say the Dao is hard to know,\nTrace the natural origin of all things,\nAnd use these to guide the myriad directions of life.\n\nTo truly speak of *having* is beyond the grasp of the mediocre.\nOnce the extraordinary Dao is understood,\nIt is beyond the reach of ordinary men.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe sage’s Dao is profound, subtle, vast, and distant,\nMajestic yet elusive, dim yet luminous,\nEmpty yet tranquil, where all things pass.\nFrom the finest to the grandest,\nIt has no form or image.\n\nTo push it to its limits is to know it cannot endure,\nTo constrain it tightly is to find words cannot express it,\nTo shift and disperse it is to see books cannot convey it—\nThe bright Dao appears as though in darkness.\n\nWhy does advancing the Dao seem like retreat,\nAnd the lost Dao appear as though in existence?\nTo govern the world, one must first rectify oneself.\n\nEmpty stillness is the Dao’s gateway,\nTranquility is the root of the spirit,\nSerenity is the origin of harmony,\nSilence is the foundation of virtue,\nFrugality is the vessel of *qi*,\nSubtlety is the craft of action.\n\nDwelling beyond the realm of *having*,\nStanding before the realm of *having*,\nAbandoning the world,\nFirst cultivating oneself,\nNurturing the spirit and accumulating harmony,\nTo govern one’s own heart—\n\nThe heart is the sovereign of the body,\nThe body is the heart of the state,\nThe world responds in kind,\nAs though by nature.\n\nThus, advancing the Dao seems like retreat.\n\nTherefore, to smooth the Dao as though with a file,\nIs to let the true and profound arise,\nTo discard its trappings and distinctions,\nTo abandon its divisions and logic,\nTo follow the people’s hearts,\nTo listen to their natural inclinations,\nTo extinguish its ornate expressions,\nTo level its highs and lows.\n\nTo break down barriers and shatter keys,\nSo that deceit naturally ceases;\nTo dismantle walls and scatter prisons,\nSo that the people naturally defend themselves—」\n\nThe breath of life ceases, the armies rest—\nThe world becomes a great marketplace.\nTen thousand regions flock to it,\nLike rivers flowing to the sea.\n\nThe Dao is smoothed as though with a file.\nVirtue like the Han Valley—\nNot giving, yet all is given;\nNot loving, yet all is benefited;\nNot dwelling, yet not absent;\nWithout action, yet grace overflows;\nWithout kindness, yet blessings abound.\nNurturing all life,\nAs the mother of the world.\n\nAbundant virtue is like a valley.\nGreat brightness, pure and green,\nEver as though in fear,\nWithout constraint yet power ascends,\nWithout reliance yet authority is heavy.\nVirtue mingles with transformation,\nFriending the world,\nEmerging white, returning black,\nNot for beauty’s sake,\nFleeing merit, shunning fame,\nYet ever luminous.\n\nGreat brightness seems like shame.\nThe person of abundant virtue—\nSincere and earnest,\nAs though insufficient,\nFormless, without appearance,\nSimple in emotion, easy in nature,\nTransformed into childlike innocence,\nDoing nothing yet all is done,\nAs though deaf, as though mute,\nThe body dwelling in one,\nThe spirit encompassing all.\nChanges unseen, joys unheard,\nAs though closed, as though sealed,\nAlone with the Dao.\n\nAbundant virtue seems insufficient.\n\nEstablishing virtue like theft—\nNothing cannot be accomplished.\nPlugging the people’s ears and eyes,\nAdorning their spirits,\nCutting their desires to benefit their nature;\nExtinguishing their pleasures to prolong their lives;\nReducing their adornments so they have no schemes;\nSealing their hearts and minds so they find peace.\nEstablishing virtue like theft.\n\nAuthentic substance like decay—\nThe people’s mysterious standard.\nNurturing them with the Dao,\nFeeding them with virtue,\nGuiding them with spirit,\nHarmonizing them with laws,\nDwelling in heaven and earth,\nIlluminated by sun and moon,\nTransformed by yin and yang,\nSustained by water and grain,\nGoverned by the formless,\nBound by the boundless.\n\nThe world murmurs in submission;\nThe realm is at peace, all things flourish.\nYet it is not their doing,\nNor their virtue—\nGreat yet seeming small,\nPure yet seeming thin.\nAuthentic substance like decay—\nDecay, meaning shallow and thin.\n\nThe great square has no corners,\nEncompassing all without measure,\nSquare yet not square,\nStraight yet not straight,\nWithout boundaries or walls,\nWithout laws or forms.\nNot straight, not square—\nAll things find their place;\nNot square, not straight—\nHeaven and earth move naturally.\nIn action, it is the yin of negation;\nIn stillness, the yang of affirmation.\nHarmony is the central sovereign;\nDistinctions clarify themselves.\nUnified with heaven, constant with earth.\nThe great square has no corners.\n\nThus, great vessels mature late,\nContaining all without limit.\nTransforming in the formless,\nChanging without trace,\nMoving yet soundless,\nActing yet bodiless.\nAwe and virtue unseen,\nAchievements unviewed,\nCalamities stilled in darkness,\nBlessings born in obscurity,\nSilent yet accomplished—\nThis is called supreme skill.\nAll things arise from it,\nYet none know how.\nStriving yet complete,\nThus enduring forever.\nGreat vessels mature late.\n\nTherefore, the greatest sound is rare in voice,\nAnnounced without words.\nSpeaking in silence,\nDivine transmission unfolds—\nMotionless, yet the world harmonizes.\nSoundless, yet all things respond,\nHeaven, earth, and all beings\nIn perfect accord, like echoes answering sound.\nThe greatest sound is rare in voice.\n\nThe greatest form is formless,\nThe greatest appearance has no shape.\nAdvancing, all things live;\nRetreating, all things perish.\nHeaven and earth bow and rise with it,\nYin and yang bend and stretch in response,\nFollowing its form, mirroring its image,\nLike shadow to shape.\nThe greatest form is formless.\n\nThus, the Dao’s fullness has no name,\nVirtue’s abundance no posthumous title.\nMerit surpasses measure,\nYet the world does not call it great;\nVirtue spans the four seas,\nYet the world does not deem it noble.\nIts radiance illuminates the six directions,\nYet returns to obscurity.\nThe Dao is hidden, nameless.\n\nWhy so?\nThe Dao’s transformation—\nBeginning in the nonexistent,\nEnding in the trivial,\nExisting in nonexistence,\nLending in non-lending,\nMoving, all things are made;\nStill, the world is fulfilled.\nGenerous in lending, yet complete.\n\n「**Chapter on the Generation of the Dao/Way**\n\nThe Dao/Way generates *One*—a state of confused and indistinct darkness. *One* generates *Two*, which is the realm of the divine and luminous. *Two* generates *Three*, the harmonious mingling of purity and turbidity. *Three* generates the myriad things, manifesting as the forms of Heaven and Earth and humanity.\n\nAll things bear yin within and embrace yang without, turning toward the yielding to give rise. The subtle *qi* unites them in harmony, and the weak become complete. What humanity abhors—nameless, solitary, and lowly—are the very things that earn the titles of *Ruler* and *Noble* through ritual and birth. To diminish it is to benefit it; to benefit it is to diminish it. To teach it as lowly and weak is also to teach it as the sacred and knowing. The arrogant and forceful have power, yet they cannot command even their own death, making them cheap in life. I shall use them as examples of calamity and extreme misfortune.\n\n**Annotations on *Zhi Gui* (指归):**\nThe *void within the void*—opening and guiding the reception—is the void itself, the Dao/Way.\nThere is no *void* without the void, yet the void cannot void itself.\nThe Dao/Way can void and thus generates all things, but all things cannot void and generate the Dao/Way.\nTherefore, the Dao/Way is the origin from which all things void—the reason it is said: *\"There is no void without the void, yet the void cannot void itself.\"*\n\nThe *void* that generates is the transformation and change of the subtle.\nThe origin of existence is the subtle, yet existence cannot generate itself.\nThe subtle is *One*.\n*One* can be the origin of existence, but it is not a tangible form of existence that cannot generate itself—hence: *\"The origin of existence is the subtle, yet existence cannot generate itself.\"*\n\nThe *void of the nonexistent*—the divine and luminous—cannot be altered.\nThe *void* that creates existence is the nonexistent, yet the nonexistent cannot exist.\nThe nonexistent is *Two*.\n*Two* arises from *One*, though it has a form, and thus can create existence—but it is not existence itself that can create. Hence: *\"The nonexistent is the void that creates existence, yet the nonexistent cannot exist.\"*\n\nThe *void* that generates is the subtle and mysterious.\nThe *void* that moves and completes is the completed, yet the completed cannot complete itself.\nThe *void* is *Three*.\n*Three* arises from *Two*, yet also has its form, rooted in *One*, receiving its mandate from the divine. It portends the generation of all things, yet all things cannot complete it—hence: *\"The void that moves and completes is the completed, yet the completed cannot complete itself.\"*\n\nThus, the *void within the void* generates the *voids*—the nonexistent, the nonexistent, and the void that generates form.\nTherefore, all things with form belong to the category of *things*, and each thing has its origin, each category its ancestor.\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of things; humanity follows next.\n\nNow, the generation of Heaven and humanity—\nForm arises from *qi*,\n*Qi* arises from harmony,\nHarmony arises from the divine and luminous,\nThe divine and luminous arise from virtue and the Dao/Way,\nVirtue and the Dao/Way arise from naturalness,\nAnd all things exist.\n\nNaturalness is the name given to that which no thing compels—it is the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way’s natural transformation generates the divine,\nThe divine communicates and forms harmony,\nHarmony disperses and becomes *qi*,\n*Qi* condenses and takes form.\nHence it is said: *\"The Dao/Way generates One, One generates Two, Two generates Three, Three generates all things.\"*\n\nTherefore, Heaven is called Heaven not because it is Heaven,\nAnd humanity is called humanity not because it is humanity.\nExistence arises from the origin, yet the origin cannot generate existence—hence: *\"What is called humanity is not humanity.\"*\n\nHow can this be made clear?\nZhuangzi said:\nWhen a person’s form decays, where does it derive from?\nWhen the wise and responsive shine forth, where do they obtain this?\nWhen transformation reaches its end, who is its author?\nThe origin lies in the nonexistent.\nFrom this perspective, existence arises from the nonexistent,\nAnd reality arises from the void—this is made clear.\n\nThus, the nonexistent is the origin of the nonexistent,\nAnd cannot be grasped in existence.\nIt has no form, no sound, and cannot be heard or seen.\nReceiving the nonexistent and granting existence—\nThis cannot be spoken or explained as the Dao/Way.\n\nThe nonexistent is the origin of the nonexistent,\nThe beginning of the unbegun.\nAll things derive from it,\nAnd it is the source of life and nature.\nThat which has no name is called the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way is the origin of *One*.\n\nThe Dao/Way is the void within the void,\nAnd thus can generate *One*.\nThe origin is tranquil and boundless—\nIt is the void within the void that first generates *One*.\n\nThere is a primal *thing* of confusion and indistinction,\nVague and indistinct in its emergence.\nLight yet not dispersing, heavy yet not settling,\nYang yet without exterior, yin yet without interior.\nIt has neither above nor below, nor left nor right,\nReaching through without boundary—\nIt is the guiding principle of the Dao/Way.\nEmbracing the void, it is spacious and empty,\nEnfolding what has not yet come into being.\nFormless, nameless,\nBlazing yet indistinct,\nConfused yet indistinct,\nDark yet beyond measure—\nIt vanishes in sound and color,\nAnd nothing can compare to it.\nPoint to it, and there is no direction,\nSeize it, and there is nothing to grasp.\nVast and boundless, it cannot be reasoned or explained,\nGrand and harmonious, without end or beginning,\nThe dwelling of all things,\nThe first of the primordial—\nThus it is called *One*.\n\nThe primordial *One* has the nonexistent,\nThe nonexistent is nameless.\nThat from which *One* arises—\nThe *One* yet without form—\nIs the virtue/power within the confused darkness that can generate.\n\nThus, without end or beginning,\nWithout left or right,\nSeeming yin yet not yin,\nSeeming yang yet not yang—\nHence: *\"Yang without exterior, yin without interior.\"*\n\n*One* is void, and thus can generate *Two*.\n*One* is the void within existence, transforming into *Two*.\nWith *Two* things arising, subtle and refined,\nThey exist and sustain existence,\nFollowing things in their transformations,\nSlippery yet formless,\nTheir vitality never decaying,\nIlluminating the dark mysteries,\nWithout direction or existence,\nEnfolding Heaven and Earth,\nTheir origin unseen,\nThey cannot be traced by sound,\nNor evaded by form—\nThis is called the divine and luminous.\n\nExistence sustains things, absence destroys them.\nWisdom and power cannot reach them,\nNor virtue and might be employed—\nThis is called *Two*.\n*Two* is the divine and luminous.\n\n*Two* arises from the origin’s nonexistent,\nAnd thus can generate *Three*.\nThe divine and luminous are the nonexistent within the nonexistent,\nAnd thus can generate *Three*.\n\nWith *Three* things arising together,\nMingled and indistinct,\nVisible yet no form discerned,\nHeard yet no sound perceived,\nSeized yet no thread grasped,\nGazed upon yet no entrance seen—\nIt cannot be measured or fathomed,\nDark yet indistinct,\nGrand yet harmonious,\nPure and turbid in unity,\nMoving with harmony,\nThe origin of Heaven and humanity,\nYet without distinct form or boundary,\nRooted in *One*, receiving its mandate from the divine—\nThis is called *Three*.」\n\n「Three is the *Great Harmony* (Tàihé).\n*Three* arises from the nonexistent,\nAnd thus can generate all things.\nThe *Great Harmony* is the nonexistent within the existent,\nA single transformation yielding the existent,\nHence the saying: *Three* generates all things.\nWith purity and turbidity divided,\nHigh and low arrayed,\nYin and Yang first distinguished,\nAnd the *Harmonious Qi* (Hégǔ) flowing,\nThe *Three Lights* (Sānguāng) revolving,\nAll classes of beings born,\nThings with form that may be traced,\nThings with sound and color that may be seen and heard—\nThis is called all things.\n\nWhen all things are born,\nThey all originate from the *Void* (Xū),\nAnd begin with the nonexistent.\nThe *Void* is the root of the nonexistent,\nThe origin is the root of beginnings.\n\nBacking Yin, facing Yang—\nAll things back Yin and face Yang.\nReturning to softness, abandoning hardness,\nIn stillness and purity, unmoved,\nMind and intent not stirred,\nYet their form and substance refined,\nTheir vitality and spirit unbounded—\nThis is by containing *Harmonious Qi* (Hégǔ) and *Softness* (Ruò),\nSo that the *Way* is formless.\n\nThus, the *Void*, the nonexistent, the formless, the subtle, the few, and the soft—\nThese are the source from which Heaven and Earth arise,\nAnd the root by which all things are generated,\nWhat the common people detest yet rulers name themselves with,\nThe primal origin of all things,\nThe fundamental root of success.\n\nFor the *Void*, the nonexistent, the solitary, and the few—\nThese are the fundamental roots of all things,\nHence rulers name themselves with them,\nYet the common people detest them.\n\nTherefore, the wise sovereign and saintly ruler,\nWith their utmost honor and greatest power,\nDwell in solitude and fewness,\nReside in humility and simplicity,\nPursue what they seek yet flee what they desire,\nDiscard greatness for smallness,\nFind joy in lowliness and loss,\nLeave no trace when they act,\nNor any mark when they withdraw,\nAdvance in fortune and retreat in calamity,\nAct without doing, yet all things settle,\nObserve not, listen not,\nEmbrace *Harmony* (Hé) in stillness,\nGive birth to divine luminosity,\nTheir form and substance naturally upright,\nTheir advance and retreat in accordance with the *Way*,\nNever altering their course,\nTheir virtue soaring like the wind,\nTheir principles reaching all things,\nHeaven and Earth aiding them,\nAll things returning to them.\n\nLoss is gain.\nThe common people are not so—\nThey see and hear only what is already manifest.\nSeeing and hearing only manifest things,\nThey align with what has already come to pass,\nAnd fail to perceive the changes yet unseen,\nHence they value hardness and strength.\nWielding great authority and creating power,\nThey govern all affairs yet fail to restrain them,\nDispising softness and fewness,\nDistancing themselves from subtlety and the solitary,\nTheir actions clash with the *Way*,\nTheir stillness contradicts Heaven,\nDivine luminosity dissipates into turbidity,\nAll affairs arise in chaos,\nTheir thoughts confused and errant,\nTheir joys and angers unfounded,\nFortunes flee the door,\nCalamities enter the home,\nThe Heavenly Net descends—\nThey cannot escape it.\n\nGain is loss.\nThen suddenly calamity arises,\nAnd they awaken in sorrow,\nBow their heads in speech yet lower their words,\nOn the verge of death, they praise virtue.\nThough they wish to reform and renew,\nReturning to fewness and softness,\nIt comes too late, and they cannot be released,\nTheir path to life is distant,\nTheir nations shattered, their families ruined,\nTheir misfortunes extending to their descendants.\nHence, the teachings of the common people,\nTransform stupidity into wisdom,\nChange weakness into strength,\nAbandon subtlety for the manifest,\nDiscard concealment for display,\nFlout humility and compete for glory,\nAnd die in pursuit of honor and fame.\nThis is what people are taught.\n\nYet the teachings of the *Sage* (Shèngrén) are contrary to this:\nStupidity becomes wisdom,\nHumiliation becomes honor,\nSubtlety becomes manifest,\nConcealment becomes display,\nFewness becomes multitude,\nWeakness becomes strength.\nAbandon mind and intent,\nPursue the nameless,\nBe without knowing or recognizing,\nReturn to the *Mysterious Darkness* (Xuānmíng).\nPaths diverge, directions vary—\nSome persist, some perish.\n\nThe teachings of the *Sage* teach with fewness and softness;\nThe teachings of the common people teach with multitude and strength.\nWhat people are taught, I also teach—\nYet the teachings differ.\n\nHence, mighty Qin and great Chu,\nWith their strength and domination, were extinguished;\nDivine Han and the rise of the *Dragon* (Lóng),\nWith their harmony and compliance, flourished.\n\nThus, the strong stray from the *Way*,\nThe hard reject divine luminosity,\nAnd the ruler who seeks to live long\nMust retreat in order to endure.\nThe strong and hard\nCannot escape their fate.\n\nNot seeking within themselves,\nThey blame Heaven and fate,\nThe *Sage* pities them,\nAnd sets forth these teachings first,\nRecording them on bamboo and silk,\nClearly demonstrating them to later generations,\nSo that throughout their lives they may reflect upon them,\nAnd thus incur their own misfortunes.\nI shall make this my foundational teaching.\n\n**Chapter on the *Ultimate Softness* (Zhìróu):**\nThe *Ultimate Softness* is the most formless thing under Heaven,\nYet it overcomes the most rigid and solid things in the world.\nThe formless enters the *Gapless Chamber of Non-Action* (Wújiān Wúwéi shì),\nThus I know to see gain and loss.\nNon-action’s benefit is to preserve the original and cut off chaos;\nAction’s harm is to disrupt the original and sever life.\nThe teaching of the unsaid closes the door to calamity,\nNon-action’s benefit preserves all things,\nYet few under Heaven can attain it.\n\n**Pointing to the Return:**\n*Virtue* (Dé) and divine luminosity are the most subtle,\nYet they are the *guests* (Bīn) of divine luminosity.\nDivine luminosity is the external manifestation of *Virtue*,\nHence it is called *guest*.\n\nDivine luminosity is the most nonexistent,\nYet the *Great Harmony* is its *subject* (Chén).\nThe *Great Harmony* is the manifestation of divine luminosity’s work,\nHence it is called *subject*.\n\nPurity and turbidity, the *Great Harmony*,\nThe *Ultimate Softness*—formless,\nEnveloping Heaven and Earth,\nContaining Yin and Yang,\nGuiding all things,\nWithout fail maintaining their order.\n\nSome exist beyond the cosmos,\nSome dwell within Heaven,\nHumans and things borrow from it to be born,\nYet none can see or hear it.\n\nFollowing the *Way* through three transformations,\nAll things begin to form,\nHumans borrow from it to be born,\nYet none can truly know it.\n\nThe hair-fine is insufficient to name it,\nThe weak are insufficient to describe it—\nThe *Sage* names it with intent alone.\n\nHow the *Sage* is called *Sage*:\nAll *Sages* obtain their title\nBy studying the *Way* and preserving divine luminosity,\nCultivating life and safeguarding truth,\nAchieving truth and thus the *Way*,\nEnveloping Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis is the profound and essential thing,\nHence it cannot be named with intent alone.\nTherefore, it is called *Ultimate Softness*,\nAnd named *Formless*.\n\nThus, the formless thing\nIs not overcome by rigidity,\nNor by strength—\nHence it can wear down Heaven and Earth,\nConsume copper and iron,\nRace like the wind and lightning,\nSpan the poles and traverse sun and moon,\nCirculate above and below,\nPass through and linger without pause,\nSoar in stability,\nAnd descend into the formless.\n\nThings with form have solidity,\nThe *Void* without subtlety has no power.\nThe *Way*, neither existent nor nonexistent,\nCan thus uphold existence without obstruction.\n\nHow does one demonstrate its truth?\nThe echo is without sound yet cannot be exhausted,\nThe shadow is without form yet cannot be measured,\nWater, though soft and weak, pierces metal and stone,\nAnd sinks all things.\nEarth, though gentle and compliant, achieves great works,\nAnd surpasses grass and trees.»\n\nThe tongue and ears suffer no harm,\nYet horns and teeth are injured and broken—\nThus it is seen: the soft overcomes the hard,\nThe empty overcomes the full—\nNot by contrivance, but by nature’s own way.\n\nSuch is the inevitable order of things,\nUnalterable and unavoidable.\n\nThis is the natural order of affairs,\nNot the natural essence of the *Way*.\n\nThus, when the land is narrow and the people few,\nWith scant soldiers and meager provisions,\nWhen desires are subtle and intentions refined,\nWhen the spirit is bright and vigilant,\nAnd harmony aligns with Heaven—\n\nTo regard the people as one’s own children,\nWith virtue flourishing and transformation vast,\nWith deep benevolence and abundant grace,\nWhen officials are loyal and soldiers trustworthy,\nWhen the ruler worries and generals tremble,\nWhen softness accumulates and weakness endures,\nEver placing oneself last among the people,\nBearing shame and humiliation,\nThe state becomes a submissive female,\nYet the lords of the realm trust it,\nComparing it to an infant,\nAnd all under Heaven flock to it,\nAs though returning to parents.\n\nWhen the people share a single desire,\nAuthority and might arise naturally,\nThe strong cannot oppress,\nThe great cannot seize,\nFrom beginning to end, strength and weakness invert,\nHeaven and Earth lend their aid,\nThe spirit’s brilliance provides support,\nOpportunity arrives without constraint,\nAnd one becomes the master of all under Heaven.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause the *Way* is soft and weak,\nYet its essence is subtle and sparse.\n\nThus, when the land is vast and the people many,\nWhen the state is rich and its armies strong,\nWhen historians are bold and soldiers fierce,\nWhen the ruler commands with severity,\nWhen rewards are heavy and punishments sharp,\nWhen laws are rigid and punishments deep,\nWhen officials tremble before the sovereign,\nWhen advantage favors terrain and strategy,\nThe realm becomes the hero of the world,\nLightly provoking enemies and delighting in battle,\nEasily mobilizing troops,\nWhere cunning begets the extraordinary,\nWhere Heaven is defied and Earth is scorned,\nWhere lords submit in fear,\nNone dare resist,\nWhere terror shakes the borders,\nWhere one is always the model of excellence,\nWhere people fear and things tremble,\nWhere might shakes Heaven and Earth,\nWhere virtue and the *Way* are abandoned,\nWhere the spirit departs,\nWhere the weak unite in disunity,\nWhere the people do not rally,\nWhere the ruler dies and the state collapses,\nWhere the lineage scatters and disperses.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause their essence is hard and rigid,\nAnd their greed and stinginess accumulate.\n\nThe *Way* manifests as the having of the non-existent,\nPassing through without obstruction,\nMoving without constraint,\nIlluminating the halls of contrivance,\nPurifying the chambers of non-action,\nEntering and exiting without boundary or fracture,\nTraveling through pearls and jade without trace.\n\nIt is said: the utmost softness\nOvercomes the utmost hardness.\nHow does one demonstrate this?\n\nSharp blades with form\nCannot pierce the formless.\nThe spirit, dwelling in the body,\nExits without obstruction,\nEnters without aperture—\nIn the blink of an eye,\nIt traverses thousands of miles.\nThere is no entering the formless.\n\nFrom this, it is said:\nAction brings ruin and no fruit,\nNon-action brings fulfillment without end.\nHeaven and Earth are thus formed,\nHumans and things are thus flourished.\nThe sound of sound is heard a hundred *li* away,\nThe sound of no-sound moves beyond Heaven,\nShaking the four seas.\n\nWhat is spoken of is spoken of—\nDifferent kinds cannot communicate.\nWhat is not spoken of—\nTransforms yin and yang,\nMakes Heaven and Earth respond.\n\nFor when virtue and the *Way* are in non-action,\nHeaven and Earth are completed.\nWhen Heaven and Earth do not speak,\nThe four seasons proceed.\nThese two things—\nThe signs of the spirit’s brilliance,\nThe verification of nature’s course.\n\nThus it is known that non-action is beneficial.\nTherefore, the sage empties the heart\nTo return to virtue and the *Way*,\nCalms the *qi* to preserve the spirit’s brilliance,\nDiminishes sharpness to hear the soundless,\nAbandons clarity to see the formless,\nObserves the transformations of Heaven and Earth,\nEncourages the natural course of all things,\nTo perceive how contrivance is the origin of chaos.\nHaving reached the function of non-action,\nOne naturally sees the disorder of contrivance.\n\nNon-action is the root of governance.\nSpeech is the doorway to calamity.\nNon-speech is the gate to blessing.\nThus, abandon wisdom and discard cleverness,\nEliminate benevolence and discard righteousness,\nAwaken the heart of the *Way*,\nExalt the intention of virtue,\nFollow the spirit and nurture harmony,\nEntrust oneself to Heaven and serve Earth,\nLet yin and yang fulfill their duties,\nLet the four seasons move freely,\nCut off the roots of chaos,\nLet things rest in their places,\nLet the ruler remain serene and unadorned,\nLet the people have no concerns.\n\nTeach with the speech of no-speech,\nTransform with the transformation of the untransformed,\nDemonstrate with the symbol of no-symbol,\nAnd return to the mysterious and profound,\nCover the people’s desires,\nFollow their nature and vital essence,\nMake the people ignorant,\nAnd they will live long and see far.\n\nThis is the teaching of no-speech.\n\nThus, when I speak not, Heaven and Earth act without contrivance,\nWhen Heaven and Earth act without contrivance, virtue and the *Way* act without contrivance.\nThese three harmonize and advance together,\nTheir *qi* blending and overflowing,\nGenerating great peace,\nGathering humans and things,\nUnifying the world within,\nClosing the door to calamity,\nMaking all under Heaven like infants,\nWith no shame or disgrace,\nNo sight of fortune or misfortune,\nNo knowledge of origins or endings,\nNaturally vast and unrestricted,\nEach household receiving the blessings of the spirit’s brilliance,\nEach person achieving the deeds of the sage’s wisdom.\n\nThe benefits of non-action.\n\nAt such times,\nThe ruler is like Heaven and Earth,\nThe people like infants,\nDrinking the ruler’s virtue,\nFeeding on the ruler’s harmony,\nYin emerging, yang retiring,\nRolling and unfolding with the *Way*.\nThe sovereign and father above\nAre present yet absent,\nThe world is dazed and content,\nSoft and murmuring,\nUnknowing like a newborn,\nNon-action like a fledgling,\nBorn without joy,\nDying without sorrow,\nGrieving yet enduring,\nWith vitality in excess,\nSeeking nothing,\nYet blessings arrive of their own accord.\nFew under Heaven attain this.\n\nWhy is this so?\n\nThe sovereign who does not speak yet embodies the Dao of non-action.\nThe key of non-action, the mechanism of speechlessness,\nLies in subtlety and refinement,\nResides in the divine and the profound.\n\nThe onset of the divine and profound,\nThe origin of subtlety and refinement,\nGives birth without root or stem,\nEmerges and retreats without gate or door.\nEver abiding between action and non-action,\nThe primal source of harmony,\nThe Dao, though formless and unseen,\nCan be known through its timely resonance.\n\nThus it may be heard yet never fully revealed,\nSeen yet never fully expounded,\nGrasped yet never fully transmitted,\nUtilized yet never fully spoken.\nTo seize and then shove away,\nTo hold fast and then relinquish—\nEasy for the wise sage to explain,\nDifficult for the shallow to comprehend.\n\nWhy so?\nBecause it is vast and profound yet common folk cannot reach it,\nBecause its lofty heights are inverted yet common folk cannot enter,\nBecause it is faint and diffuse yet the world cannot discern it,\nBecause it is obscure and hidden yet vulgar rulers cannot practice it.\n\nThe body’s name—who is closer, fame or self?\nSelf or wealth—what is more abundant?\nGain or loss—what is more harmful?\nThus extreme affection brings great depletion to the spirit,\nExcessive hoarding brings heavy ruin and retreat to the body.\n\nTherefore, knowing sufficiency prevents disgrace,\nKnowing cessation prevents peril,\nAnd the body may endure long,\nWith great vitality preserved.\n**Point of Return:**\n\nThat which I inherit by nature and am,\nIs virtue and power.\nThat which I borrow to live,\nIs the spirit’s brilliance.\nThat which I rely upon to flourish,\nIs the Great Harmony.\nThat which I entrust to take form,\nAre Heaven and Earth.\n\nAll these four—\nThey nourish me, yet I cannot nourish them.\nThus no law is higher than virtue and power,\nNo model is greater than the spirit’s brilliance,\nNo standard is broader than the Great Harmony,\nNo illumination is grander than Heaven and Earth.\n\nVirtue and power—\nEver living, never dying;\nHarmony of purity and turbidity—\nEndless transformation.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth—\nPreserved yet hard to lose;\nThe workings of yin and yang—\nEver moving, hard to conclude.\n\nHeaven and Earth, yin and yang,\nBut seen in their difficulty to conclude,\nNot because they lack beginning or end.\nFrom this perspective,\nMisfortune reaches its extreme at death,\nFortune reaches its extreme at birth.\nThus the sage,\nAbove, traces the intent of virtue and power,\nBelow, measures the heart of Heaven and Earth,\nExalts and displays honor,\nInvokes auspiciousness and flourishing virtue,\nEmbraces depth and vastness,\nCultivates reverence and exhaustion,\nYet nothing surpasses the value of life.\n\nAll things arrayed,\nWonders and treasures,\nGold and jade, pearls and jade discs,\nTheir use profound yet their gain immense—\nNothing surpasses the body.\n\nThe artisan of worldly calamity,\nThe craftsman of national chaos,\nWho defies Heaven and Earth,\nWho harms the body—\nNothing surpasses the name.\n\n**Extreme pride and excess,**\n**Oppressing the people, impoverishing the state,**\n**Disturbing the spirit’s clarity,**\n**Multiplying desires of the heart,**\n**Rebelling against Heaven, violating the Dao,**\n**Competing to become thieves and robbers,**\n**The world shuns them, wars abound,**\n**One person’s actions bring ruin to ten thousand states,**\n**The ruler dies, the people perish,**\n**All creatures suffer their poison—**\nNothing surpasses wealth.\n\nThough wealth and name are feared and shocking,\nTheir benefits to the body are distant indeed.\nThus gain and loss,\nSometimes harmful, sometimes useful.\nGaining name or wealth,\nVirtue and power do not abide,\nThe spirit’s brilliance does not linger,\nGreat vitality is severed,\nHeaven cannot save.\n\nLosing name and wealth#1,\nVirtue and power naturally support,\nThe spirit’s brilliance naturally aids,\nFame appears effortlessly,\nRiches align with Heaven and Earth.\nGaining name or wealth,\nLosing the Dao and the body.\nLosing name and wealth,\nBenefits align with Heaven and Earth.\nThus preserving the body while pursuing great fame,\nCannot yet be discussed in terms of the ultimate Dao;\nLightening the body while valuing the state,\nCannot yet be plotted for profit.\n\nThe name without name,\nIs the dwelling of my life;\nThe name with name,\nIs the sack that buries me.\nThe wealth without wealth,\nIs the nourishment of my fortune;\nThe wealth with wealth,\nIs the thief that robs me.\nThus extreme affection for the body,\nTo build and maintain fame,\nActing and laboring for it,\nForcing nature and temperament,\nOnly depletes the spirit.\n\nExcessive accumulation of wealth,\nDaily swelling with arrogance,\nThe path to ruin—\nWealth and name both end.\nExtreme affection brings great depletion.\n\nThus the spirit’s brilliance cannot sustain life,\nHeaven and Earth cannot preserve the body.\nWhy is this so?\n\nThe transformation of **Dao** and **virtue/power** follows the patterns of Heaven and Earth—\none yin, one yang,\ndividing into the four seasons,\nseparating into the five phases,\nspinning like a net,\nsetting traps without gaps.\n\nAll things’ natures,\neach have their measure,\nunable to interfere.\nThe heart of creation,\nharmonious and upright with fairness,\nnaturally unified—\nstraightforward, balanced, and equal,\nneither favoring nor rejecting,\ncommuning with all things.\nExtending the long,\ncontinuing the short,\nreducing the excess,\nsupplementing the deficient—\nthe insufficient are nourished,\nthe surplus perish.\n\nGreed and accumulation bring self-inflicted calamity;\ninsufficiency without restraint stirs the heart of gain.\nThe wise deceive the foolish,\nthe strong seize what they desire—\nNature balances it:\nname and profit return to their origin.\nLosing them brings sorrow,\ngaining them brings joy.\nOne joy, one sorrow—\nthe soul and spirit wander;\none sorrow, one joy—\nthe spirit departs.\n\nWhen the body dies, the name vanishes,\nand disaster extends to descendants.\nThus, name and profit with the body,\nare like charcoal and ice—\nforms and natures opposed,\ntheir forces cannot coexist.\nWhen name reaches its end and the body its limit,\nthere is none in the world who survives with both thriving.\n\nThe empty is where **Dao** returns,\nthe real is where things perish.\nNow, if one accumulates the real and seeks to align with the empty,\nit is like water and fire repelling each other—\nimpossible to achieve.\n\nThus, disturbing the heart, scheming the mind,\nusing emotions to exhaust the spirit,\nnight and day pursuing affairs,\nadornment and rhetoric,\nworrying over the masses,\ncreating deeds and establishing merit,\nstriving for self-discipline to display virtue—\nthis depletes what sustains life\nand increases what destroys it.\n\nExhausting sinew and strength,\nenduring hunger and thirst,\nbearing cold and heat,\ntreading dangers and narrow paths,\ncoarse clothing and poor food,\nunsuited to appetite,\nserving court and night,\nbearing shame and disgrace,\nspirit and essence fleeing—\nunrelenting, opposing **Dao** for glory,\nentering excess to possess,\nrisking the body for security—\nwealth accumulates while the spirit perishes,\ndisaster naturally follows.\nArrogance and ruin arrive together—\nthis is using fortune to destroy fortune,\nseeking profit while losing it.\n\nThe more one hoards, the greater the ruin.\nThus, success and failure depend on action or inaction,\nlife and death on departure or arrival.\n\nTherefore, those who know sufficiency,\nalign with **Dao** and virtue/power,\nabandon name and profit,\nestablish the self in non-being,\nnourish things without self-generation,\nshare with things without self-preservation—\nin sincerity and compliance,\nsufficient to preserve the spirit.\nHousehold affairs suffice for a lifetime.\n\nEver natural, thus unassailable;\ndwelling in emptiness, thus unpenetrable;\nlight on name, light on things, thus unstained;\ndesiring without desire, thus enduring glory—\nthis is called *not being humiliated*.\n\nThose who know restraint,\nwhether noble as a sovereign or poor in caves,\ndo not distort their will,\nnor dim their spirit.\nAdvancing does not bring pride,\nretreating does not bring despair.\nNo gain, no loss,\nno guilt, no merit,\nno seeking, no refusal—\nlike the sea, like a great river,\nwandering in the boundless domain,\nspirit and clarity unified.\nMoving in harmony with Heaven and Earth,\nthus unshaken;\ndistinct from harm and gain,\nthus ever constant.\n\nThus, profound and unshaken,\nspirit firm and unbroken,\nlike Heaven and Earth in grandeur,\nlike the sun and moon in radiance—\nboth refined and spiritual,\nto preserve the body.\nKnowing sufficiency and stopping,\nthus enduring forever.\nKnowing restraint brings no peril.\n\nThis is called *chasing name while name pursues me*,\n*fleeing profit while profit pursues me*.\nTo conceal desire while revealing it—\nthis can endure forever.\n\n**Great attainment resembles a missing chapter**—\ngreat attainment resembles a missing law—\nformless, its use unexhausted, transformation flowing.\n**Great fullness resembles emptiness**—\nmasterless, its use unfathomable, principles vast.\n**Great straightness resembles bending**—\nnameless,\ngreat skill resembles clumsiness—\nunaccomplished,\ngreat eloquence resembles stammering—\nfull yet empty.\n**Agitation overcomes cold**—\nmovement in form and appearance,\n**stillness overcomes heat**—\ncalm in form and spirit.\nTo be able to still and clear—\nthis is Heaven and Earth,\nthe rectifier for all things, the standard of the world.\n\n**Pointing to the return:**\n**Dao** and virtue/power act without action, yet spirit is manifest;\nspirit acts without action, yet **Great Harmony** arises.\nWithout action, things regulate themselves.\nSome are born without roots, some walk without feet,\nsome hear without ears, some sing without mouths—\ndiverse kinds, distinct orders,\nall trading with them.\nMothers grieve for their children,\nchildren grieve for their mothers,\nmale and female pair,\nthings honor their masters,\nnest-born peck, womb-born nurse,\nbirds scatter when startled,\nbeasts flee when alarmed,\nyin-things dwell in burrows,\nyang-things nest above,\nfire moves upward in flame,\nwater moves downward in moisture—\nall things verdant,\nspring born, summer growing,\nautumn ripening, winter maturing—\nall return to soil.\nNo governance or teaching—\nthings act naturally.\n\nThis is the natural **effort**, **pattern**, and **measure** of yin and yang,\ninevitable as such.\n\nFrom this perspective,\n*non-action* does not generate *non-action*,\n*negation* does not generate *negation*,\n*clarity* does not generate *clarity*,\n*obscurity* does not generate *obscurity*.\n*Non-action* is not *negation*,\n*clarity* is not *obscurity*—\nonly then does one grasp the rhythm.\n\n*Non-action* is not *negation*,\n*clarity* is not *obscurity*—\nthis is ease, aligning with **Dao**.\n\nThus, the **Great Dao** is vast and open,\nnot confined to doors—\nthe farther it extends, the fewer who know it.\n**Dao** resides in the self, not in the wild,\ntransformation originates within, not from without—\nall things perpetually ordered,\nwisdom does not arise.\n\nTherefore, the sage holds **Harmony** and treads **Rectitude**,\ngoverns without form,\nwanders in emptiness,\nmirroring **Great Clarity**,\nabandoning soul and spirit,\nresting essence and spirit,\nacting without action,\nsilent yet trustworthy,\nvast and boundless,\nilluminated and solitary—\napproaching yet unattainable,\nits essence true,\nits use unexhausted,\nunseen, unheard.\n\nThis is called **great attainment resembling a missing chapter**—\nits use unexhausted.\n\nWhy is this so?\n\nSubtle and thorough,\nclear and still in truth,\nbefore form and sound,\ntransforming its origin—\nopening like yang,\nclosing like yin,\nblocked like earth,\nmoving like Heaven.\n**Patterned and martial**, **mysterious and virtuous**—\nprofound virtue naturally divides.\n\nThus, when full yet appearing empty,\nwhen solid yet appearing void,\nwhen benevolence and righteousness are not flaunted,\nwhen propriety and decorum are unseen,\nwhen laws and institutions are not erected,\nwhen action is not contrived—\n\nThe ruler desires not to desire,\nyet the world transforms itself.\nGentle and unadorned, the people are like infants,\ndimly unaware, their longings vague,\ntheir paths unknown—\nits use inexhaustible,\nflowing yet never decaying.\n\nGreat fullness resembles emptiness,\nits use inexhaustible.\n\nWithout tilling, food is plentiful;\nwithout weaving, clothing is ample.\nIn summer, they rest in nakedness;\nin winter, they wrap in furs.\nNo taboos exist—\nthey dwell with beasts, unbound,\nhair loose, suckling at will,\nwandering freely together.\nThe ruler abounds in virtue,\nthe people abound in wealth.\n\nIts transformation pervades all things,\ndoing without doing.\nIts radiance unseen, its mystery profound—\nHeaven, Earth, and all beings\ntransform with it in harmony.\n\nRiding the void, bearing the empty,\nwandering with the Dao,\nmeasuring the four seas,\ncirculating through the six voids,\nvast and boundless,\ndwelling in the utmost nothingness.\n\nWhy is this so?\nStraight yet appearing crooked,\ntrue yet appearing wrong.\nGreat straightness seems like crookedness.\n\nWhen the ruler speaks, the world echoes;\nwhen the ruler acts, all beings follow.\nThus, without sacrifices, Heaven’s harmony aligns,\nwithout decrees, the four seas rectify.\nHence it is said: *Great skill resembles clumsiness.*\n\nHeaven’s Way is naturally humble—\nwithout calendars, yin and yang harmonize;\nwithout fixed seasons, the four times proceed;\nwithout laws, the world is at ease;\nwithout rewards or punishments, names and realities align.\n\nConcealing martial might, it conquers all;\nabandoning warfare, it overcomes all.\nWithout commands, the people govern themselves;\nwithout rituals, the realm enlightens itself;\nwithout seals, the world trusts itself;\nwithout measures, all things balance themselves.\n\nGreat eloquence seems like stammering.\nThus, though weak, it appears deficient;\nthough gaining, it seems like loss.\nWithout bells and drums, the people rejoice;\nwithout five flavors, their food is sweet;\nwithout adornments, their beauty is natural;\nwithout hoarding, their abundance overflows.\n\nWhy is this so?\nFollowing the Dao, trusting Heaven, not relying on knowledge—\nthus the people act naturally.\n\nThough the Five Emperors seemed unworthy,\neach achieved greatness.\nThe enlightened ruler, through the Dao, transforms people,\nmaking them align with the Way.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s Way—\nadvancing and retreating in turn—\nall things thereby flourish.\nTransformation is unobstructed,\nflexing and extending cannot be barred.\n\nWhen yin reaches its peak,\nthe earth splits and ice congeals,\ncold winds howl, frost descends thick,\nfish and turtles burrow deep,\nall things curl in fear.\nYet in this time,\ndwelling in warm chambers,\nbeside blazing fires,\nwearing thick furs and layered silks—\nstill, one cannot withstand it.\nBut when the mind steadies and the spirit calms,\nwhen the body moves and toils,\nthen sweat pours, garments are cast aside,\nand warmth suffuses the body.\n*Agitation overcomes cold.*\n\nWhen yang reaches its peak,\nsand is seared, stones crumble,\nbirds take flight, water creatures flee,\nall things wither, rivers dry up.\nYet in this time,\nplunging into cool springs,\nwearing coarse linen,\ndwelling in high halls,\nwearing cold stones—\nstill, one cannot endure it.\nBut when the heart releases, the mind clears,\nwhen the spirit drifts beyond the four seas,\nwhen the will wanders in the void,\nwhen breath and heart align—\ncoolness pervades the body.\n*Stillness overcomes heat.*\n\nThus, knowing how to act is a craft—\ngoverning people, nurturing life,\nvirtue extending to Heaven and Earth,\nachievement matching yin and yang.\nYet when chaos arises,\nit emerges without form,\nstirs without sound,\nexpanding with governance,\nshifting with transformation.\nIt seizes people like dampness,\nreaches them like shadow—\nresponding like echoes to speech,\nnever leaving their forms.\nThe more one acts, the greater the disorder;\nthe more one governs, the more tangled the affairs.\nEven the wise cannot lead,\neven harsh punishments cannot restrain.\n\nYet the *non-acting* ruler\nis the sovereign of action,\nthe origin of governance and transformation,\nwhose removal of calamity\nis like agitation overcoming cold\nor stillness overcoming heat.\n\nThus the sage abandons knowledge, abandons scheming,\nempties the heart, focuses the breath,\nclears and stills, responding naturally—\nthen Heaven’s will aligns,\nEarth’s intent follows,\ngovernance rises, transformation flows like sunlight,\ncalamity vanishes like dispersing clouds.\nThe world follows its example without limit,\nall things learn from it without restraint.\n\nThis is called *able to clear, able to still—\nthe world naturally rectifies itself.*\n\n---\n**When the Way prevails in the world, the ruler desires nothing—**\neven warhorses are turned to manure for fields.\n**When the Way does not prevail, the ruler takes action—**\nwarhorses breed in the suburbs, laws favor martial might.\n\nNo sin is greater than ceaselessly pursuing desire,\nno calamity greater than insatiable greed,\nno blame greater than coveting gain.\nContentment’s fullness knows no lack—\nit possesses all without taking.\n\n**The Way’s return:**\nA person’s life is entrusted to the ruler;\nthe ruler’s standing depends on the people.\nWhen the ruler follows the Dao, the people flourish;\nwhen the ruler loses the Dao, the people perish.\nThe people’s flourishing makes temples glorious;\ntheir ruin makes temples crumble.\nThus the ruler is the people’s source;\nthe people are the ruler’s root.\nWhen the root is injured, flowers and fruit wither;\nwhen the source decays, the flow runs dry.\nAbove and below sustaining each other—\nthus they endure.\n\nTherefore, when the ruler follows the Dao,\nthe world is undisturbed,\nlords and vassals submit in reverence,\nbarbarians rejoice in submission,\nthe four seas share the same winds,\nweapons never rise,\nborder guards have no use for their words,\nmighty warriors have no place for their strength.\n\nThe wise and clever till where rain falls,\nfine steeds pull plows.\nThis is called: *When the Way prevails, even warhorses are turned to manure.*\n\nThe world at ease, each pursues their work,\ncustoms are sincere, the people unified—\nclothing woven from hemp, food from tilling,\nHeaven’s heart in harmony, all things bountiful,\nauspicious omens frequent, blessings abundant.\nNot Heaven’s bestowal, but the ruler’s virtue and Dao.\n\n「When the Son of Heaven loses the Dao,\nlords do not pay tribute,\nvalleys split and streams diverge,\nlaws and institutions clash and differ,\nthe four quarters rebel and vie in strength,\nraising armies to contest authority—\nthe weak become captives#2,\nthe strong become rulers.\n\nThus, the land selects generals and sharpens warriors,\nkindling beacon fires on all sides,\ndeeply plotting and crafting great deceits,\nstrategizing in the halls of state,\nconcocting schemes that spawn rebellion,\nforming shifting alliances—*crossing and combining*—\nlight chariots and swift cavalry surge forth,\nenemies rise to match them in might,\nwarriors and steeds perish in the wilderness,\nyear after year without return,\ntheir ambition and force twisted into ruin,\ntheir governance marked by treachery and violence.\n\nIn such times, they groom warhorses\nwithout pause for kin,\nrace to battlefields first,\ndwell on coarse fare of beans and millet,\ngreedy men sit as butchers,\nlowly servants rise as brigands,\nthe people exhausted and spent,\ntreasures drained, strength weary,\nendless conscription and military labor.\n\nThis is why warhorses are born in the wilds.\n\nThey long to return home,\nbut sorrow and lament fill their hearts—\nremembering parents aged and weary,\nweeping in exile.\n\nKind fathers and benevolent mothers,\ngrief and anguish pierce their souls,\ntheir resolve and spirit shattered within.\n\nSoldiers lie slain, heads and heels bound,\nbones exposed to the elements,\nscattered in the desolate fields—\nnumberless beyond reckoning.\n\nThe roads stretch desolate,\nall are fatherless sons,\nyearning for command,\nrising with sobs and tears—\nwhat crime against Heaven,\nto suffer such calamity?\n\nFemales lack husbands,\nchildren lack fathers,\ntheir cries of woe and sorrow\ngather without cause.\n\nThe mighty become leaders,\nthe middling become butchers,\nthose above and below protect one another,\ninner and outer realms guard as one—\nnot bound by blood,\nyet closer than brothers.\n\nTall grasses serve as banners,\nhollowed earth as drums,\nseizing weapons and wielding tools,\nmarching in disciplined ranks,\nconstantly drilled in warfare,\ntheir thoughts and loyalty fixed on their lord,\nso ardent that their spirits intertwine,\ntheir *qi* and transformations move as one.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth grow rigid and disjointed,\nyin and yang are severed and blocked,\nstars scatter and wander,\nsun and moon clash in eclipse,\ndeceit and rebellion sprout,\ncalamities arise in tandem—\nnot Heaven’s infliction of woe,\nbut the ruler’s loss of the Dao.\n\nThe ruler without the Dao\nwas not born without the Dao,\nbut first gained Heaven’s mandate through it,\nyet failed to uphold it,\nand in arrogance and excess,\nknowing no bounds,\nreverts to his original desires,\nsharing the same fate as slaves and captives.\n\nTo receive Heaven’s grand mandate,\nto follow the sacred ones before,\nnoble as the Son of Heaven,\nrich with all the four seas,\nhonored with supreme rank and favor—\nnone can compare.\n\nYet coarse robes and simple furs are deemed delight,\nplain vegetables and humble broths are called exquisite.\n\nTo transform the world and shift its customs\nis as effortless as wind bending grass;\nthe people’s conformity\nis as natural as fish to water.\n\nIf one does not strive to elevate the Dao,\nbroaden virtue,\nrefine oneself and rectify one’s conduct,\ngrieve for the common folk,\nto fulfill ancestral sacrifices,\nto honor forefathers and pass on their legacy—\nto vie with Heaven and Earth in renown,\nto share their eternal preservation—\nbut instead pursues pride and extravagance for fame,\nseeks power without restraint,\ndefies Heaven and opposes Earth,\nspurning all with insolence—\n\nthen the unworthy rise in defiance,\nlightly pressing deep into battle,\nthe first to arrive are deemed rightful,\ndistant foes go unchallenged,\nalliances fracture, bonds dissolve,\nthe inner and outer realms offer no reliance,\nand with their deaths comes the fall of the state,\nthe ancestral temples crumble—\nyet these are the consequences of their own greed,\nnot the fault of the world.\n\nThis is called: *No guilt is greater than unchecked desire.*\n\nThus, those who wield authority and honor,\nexhausting the people’s limits,\nwhose fame and titles cover the land,\nyet know no contentment—\nthey become instruments of disaster,\nthe grand measure of their own ruin.\n\nNo misfortune is greater than knowing no contentment.\n\nFor the ruler’s virtue and sacred power,\nto mold and transform—\nalready attained, they preserve the people,\nunify spirit and form,\nand take great shape.\n\nTheir movements are effortless,\nears and eyes keen,\nwandering in bright and open realms,\nlistening across Heaven and Earth,\nobserving Nature’s eternal laws,\nstudying the gains and losses of ancient generals—\ndigging wells to drink,\nplowing fields to eat,\nlong wives and children born,\nliving in harmony with fate—\nthis is true contentment,\nthe fullness of sufficiency.\n\nDifferent beings share the same attainment,\nthus it is sufficiency.\n\nHow much more so for the lord of ten thousand chariots,\nthe ruler of a thousand chariots?\n\nTheir sufficiency is clear indeed.»\n\nThe Way is not in this—\nwhen greed arises in the heart,\ncoveting others’ lands,\ndesiring their wealth and treasures,\nmerging and seizing without end,\never increasing without cease—\nthis is the great cause of calamity,\nthe ultimate source of blame.\n\nNo fault is greater than the desire to take.\n\nFrom ancient times to now,\nflying birds and running beasts,\nall living things with breath and kind—\nnone preserve their nature and life\nwithout the desire to take.\n\nThus, the one who dwells as a ruler becomes a captive,\nthe one who dwells as a tiger becomes a mouse.\nThough their name soars above the green clouds,\ntheir body lies beneath the Yellow Springs.\n\nThose who occupy the station of ox or horse\nsuffer no ox or horse’s fate;\nthose who take refuge among dogs and sheep\nbear no dogs and sheep’s blame.\n\nTherefore, the lord who attains the Way\nestablishes his heart in sufficiency,\nwanders his mind in stillness,\nrejects might and yields to power,\nstands alone and dwells in solitude,\nabandons all things,\nand holds only the numinous in his grasp.\nHis life preserved, his name honored,\nhe endures without peril,\nand all under Heaven turns to him.\nNone can resist him.\n\nThis is the sufficiency that is always sufficient.\n\nNot stepping beyond the doorstep—\nnot leaving the door to wander the courtyard—\none knows the households of the world,\nknows the people.\n\nNot peering through the window—\nthere is nothing to gaze upon.\nSeeing the Dao of Heaven,\none knows Heaven itself.\n\nThe farther one goes from home,\nthe less one knows—\nno sight, no hearing.\n\nThus, the Sage—meaning the enlightened ruler—\nacts without moving yet knows all under Heaven,\nsees without looking yet names the Heaven and Earth,\ndoes without doing yet accomplishes through spontaneity.\n\n**The Return to Origins:**\nVirtue and power transform,\nmolding the primal head,\nreceiving life and nature\nfrom the boundless void,\nthe mysterious dark—\nand from this, all things arise in undifferentiated chaos.\n\nThe numinous and the clear interact,\npure and turbid separate,\nand the Great Harmony flows\nthrough the vast and open wilds,\nthe subtle and refined—\nand from this, all things are born.\n\nHeaven is round, Earth is square,\nhumans stand upright, beasts move horizontally,\ngrasses and trees take root,\nfish sink, birds soar,\neach thing by its kind,\neach kind by its group—\nrank and status are fixed,\nand from this, fortune and misfortune arise.\n\nFrom this perspective,\nHeaven, Earth, and all beings share the same origin,\nthe same ancestral source.\nWithin the four quarters and beyond the cosmos,\nall are connected as one body.\n\nQi transforms and separates,\nspreading horizontally and vertically,\ndivided into two,\njudged into five.\nTwo—Heaven and Earth.\nFive—the five colors, the five phases, the five flavors, the five notes.\n\nSome become white or black,\nsome water or fire,\nsome sour or salty,\nsome the metal or wood phases.\nHumans and things of the same kind,\nmale and female—\nall these are kin, like brothers.\n\nThough their forms differ and their lands are distant,\ntheir benefits and harms oppose one another,\nand the myriad things vary beyond measure.\nThey return to joy and anger,\nto death and life,\ntheir emotions and nature born together,\ntheir minds and intentions in harmony.\n\nHow so?\nZhuangzi said:\nWithin a single body,\nall born of the same parents,\nthe four limbs and nine orifices,\neach with its distinct function,\nthe five viscera and six entrails,\neach receiving its own charge—\nabove and below do not know each other,\ninner and outer do not see each other.\nThe head and feet are Heaven and Earth,\nthe elbows and knees are the four seas,\nthe liver and gallbladder are the Hu and Yue,\nthe eyebrows and eyes are Qi and Chu.\n\nIf they did not share the same origin,\nif their bodies were separate and distinct,\ntheir movements would not support one another,\ntheir stillness would not await one another—\neven the Nine Heavens above and the Yellow Springs below\nare insufficient to describe it.\n\nYet, if the head is afflicted, the feet cannot walk;\nif the chest is sick, the mouth cannot speak;\nif the heart finds peace, the ears and eyes are keen.\nWhen bending and stretching are harmonious,\nwhen all joints move lightly—\nthis is because of their shared form.\n\nWhen the ruler moves nearby,\nall things respond from afar;\nwhen things move here,\nHeaven and Earth respond there.\nThey and I respond in kind,\nentering and exiting without gates,\ncoming and going without doors.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nwithin the vast emptiness,\nendless and boundless,\nall things resonate in kind,\nnever missing by a hair—\nfor they are of one body.\n\nHumans know only the unity of their own body,\nbut do not know that a single realm is always one body.\nHumans know that a single realm is one body,\nbut do not know that all things share one mind.\n\nIf all things share one mind,\nhow can there be separation within it?\n\nThus, one knows the world without leaving the doorstep.\n\nTherefore, the Sage\ndoes not step beyond the threshold,\nascends to his parents above,\ndescends to his descendants below,\nweighs peril and security, benefit and harm,\nreturns to the teachings of life and death,\ndiscerns the principles of right and wrong,\npenetrates the origins of benefit and harm,\nreaches the roots of order and chaos.\n\nKnowing oneself, one knows the family;\nknowing the family, one knows others.\nHolding fast to the essentials,\ngrasping the principles,\nin action, knowing where to go,\nin stillness, knowing what to guard.\n\nVirtue and power are father and mother,\nclarity and stillness are teacher,\nGreat Harmony is friend,\nall under Heaven is home,\nall things are body.\nView others as oneself,\nview oneself as others.\nThe heart dares not stir,\nthe will dares not rise.\nAbandoning old knowledge,\nabolishing the three and five.\n\nActing without contrivance,\ndwelling in caves and holes,\nnot killing living things,\nnot eating raw plants,\nnot wearing what is unformed,\nnot taking what is incomplete—\nHeaven, Earth, and all beings\neach preserve what is theirs.\n\nThough Heaven, Earth, and all things seem to differ in form,\ntheir beginning and end, their roots and branches,\nare all of one body.\nWithin this unity, there is no resentment or malice.\nReceived from virtue and power,\nhow dare they harm or injure?\nThus, Heaven, Earth, and all beings each preserve what is theirs.\n\nBefore my form took shape,\nthe source of my nature and life,\nthe origin of spirit and breath,\nthe foundation of my body—\nthis reveals that the real arises from the void,\nthat being comes from non-being.\nThe small void contains nothing,\nthe great void encompasses all.\n\nMy origin lies in virtue and power,\nconceived yet unborn,\nthe means by which form is perfected\nuntil emerging from the dark—\nthis reveals the profound, the subtle, the refined,\nthe harmonious, the weak, the moist—\nthe great through which all things pass,\nthe unknown, the unknowing,\nthe doing without doing, the acting without action—\nyet its function is great.\n\nViewing myself as the infant brother,\nuntil I grew strong and knowing,\nI saw the soft giving rise to the hard,\nthe weak to the strong,\nthe small to the great,\nthe short to the long,\nthe foolish to the wise,\nthe obscure to the clear.\n\n---\n\nExamine my breath’s inhalation and exhalation,\nto know that loss is the first of gain,\ngain is the root of loss,\nadvance is the foundation of retreat,\nretreat is the root of advance,\nfortune is the beginning of calamity,\ncalamity is the precursor of fortune.\n\nAscending steep slopes, traversing obstacles and dangers,\nmy form grows weary, breathless, and trembling—\nyet when I rest in stillness,\nmy spirit becomes even, my *qi* harmonious,\ninner and outer preserved in balance—\nthis is the equilibrium of those who align with the Dao.\n\nThus I know the great function of\nclearing stillness, emptiness, and non-action,\nwhere transformation unfolds.\n\nThe four limbs and nine orifices,\npursuing diverse tasks and errands,\nwith varied abilities and forms—\nall arise from the singular origin of mind.\nThus I know that all things, in their myriad directions and forms,\ntheir benefits and harms, all spring from the master.\n\nThe master is the origin of all people,\nas the heart is to the body.\nExamining the heavens and earth,\nverifying past and present,\nmovement never contradicts—\nthus I know the Dao of heaven and earth is complete within me.\nI differ not from heaven and earth.\n\nTherefore, the family is the root of knowing people;\nthe body is the source of knowing heaven.\nObserve the body to know the body,\nobserve the family to know the family,\nobserve the world to know the world.\nTo observe heaven without the body,\nto observe people without the family—\nnearness leads to great distance,\nsmall knowledge leads to great confusion.\nAbandon the family and step outside—\nyou see not the world;\nabandon the body and peer through a window—\nyou know not the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther you go, the less you know;\nroaming the four seas, the more you stray.\nThe more you seek, the smaller your achievements;\nthe more you pursue fame, the less you attain.\n\nDo not look, do not listen—\nseek within yourself.\nAt the juncture of heaven and humanity,\nthe great Dao is complete.\nObtain yourself and obtain heaven,\nobtain heaven and obtain the Dao,\nobtain the Dao and obtain humanity.\nThus, without stepping outside, one knows the world;\nwithout peering through a window, one knows the Dao of heaven.\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\n\nTherefore, the sage does not observe the likes and dislikes of one family\nto command the affairs of ten thousand families;\nwithout traveling a thousand *li*,\nhe commands the changes of the nine regions.\nHis feet do not ascend to heaven,\nyet he knows the intent of the nine heavens;\nhis body does not enter the earth,\nyet he knows the meaning of the nine depths.\nThe advance and retreat of yin and yang,\nthe transformations of the four seasons,\nthe profound and hidden, the obscure and mysterious—\nnothing escapes him.\n\nHow so?\nBy examining the inner to know the outer,\nby tracing the small to know the great,\nby using myself to understand others,\nby clarifying the near to illuminate the distant.\n\nThus, the sage governs as the heart governs the body,\nas the body governs itself.\nThe heart resides within the body,\nyet it does not impose external rules—\nonly by subtly initiating harmony\ndo all limbs align in accord.\n\nNot knowing to act in accordance with the Dao,\nnot desiring to respond to heaven,\nacting without action to guide the world,\nremaining without doing to nourish the people—\nmysterious and silent,\nallowing transformation to unfold naturally,\nabove in harmony with the divine,\nbelow in unity with all things—\nmoving, they oppose yet sustain;\nstill, they preserve yet endure.\nEmpty, tranquil, and secluded,\nthey let things return to their natural state.\n\nThe sage, secluded and without action,\nallows all things to naturally conform to the Dao—\nlike a pearl in water, making the river beautiful,\nthis is the transmission of divine transformation.\nThus it is said:\nthe sage speaks not yet is believed,\nacts not yet achieves.\n\nSome say the sage, having attained the Dao,\nits principle eternally present,\ndivine transformation ever ongoing—\nwhy, then, do I not practice,\nyet naturally align with perfection?\nThe world grows ever more distant from the Dao.\n\nThis fails to grasp the sage’s transformation.\nIf rain and dew nourish grass and trees,\nall flourish with fragrance—\nyet withered and dried things remain unchanged.\nCan the nature of withered things\nabsorb the grace of clouds and rain?\nIs it not like the blind who do not believe in the light of sun and moon?\n\n---\n*(End of Daoist Canon: *Zhuangzi*’s *Gu Shen Zi* Commentary, Vol. 8–9)*\n\nThe pursuit of learning daily increases—\nyet learning only increases the people’s knowledge.\nThe practice of the Dao daily diminishes—\nyet diminishing only diminishes the people’s knowledge.\n\nDiminish again, and again—\nuntil they know not at all.\nReach the state of *wuwei*—\nuntil there is no doing,\nand thus no undone.\nTo seek to take the world,\none must first harmonize it—\never abiding in *wuwei*,\never without function.\n\nWhen affairs arise, knowledge and ability are strained—\nyet even then, they are insufficient to take the world,\nand thus it is never attained.\n\n**Commentary:**\nThe transformation of virtue and Dao—\nshifting, void, and mysterious,\nvast and silent,\nboundless and formless,\nturbulent yet indistinct,\nchaotic yet without origin.\nIt cannot be seen, cannot be heard,\nyet opens and guides all things—\nnothing is absent from its embrace.\nWhen deeds are accomplished, affairs fulfilled,\nnothing is left undone.\n*Wuwei* is the root of all things.\n\nFrom this, we see:\nThe knowing of the unknown is the origin of knowing;\nThe teaching of the uninstructed is the source of teaching.\n*Wuwei* as action is the beginning of action;\nThe doing of non-doing is the origin of affairs.\nThe teaching of the uninstructed,\n*wuwei* as action—\nall are the supreme movements of the ultimate Dao,\nformless yet spiritually complete,\nineffable and nameless,\nthus called the Great Origin, the Ancestral Source.\n\nAll these things:\nThe workings of the divine,\nThe return of heaven and earth,\nThe teachings of the Mysterious Sage,\nThe transmission of the recluse.\n\nYet when benevolence and righteousness grow shallow,\nlife and nature become false,\nthe Great Dao is unseen,\nactions follow mere desires,\nthey sink into knowledge’s delusions,\nare steeped in sorrow and favor,\ntheir emotions and intentions multiply,\ntheir spirit binds to things,\ntheir schemes are deep yet unheard,\ntheir grand theories clash with truth,\nthey exalt knowledge over the Dao,\nvalue deeds over virtue.\n\nThus they devise arts and calculations,\ncompile words and writings,\nrecord them in texts,\nto instruct the people.\nThey weave the threads of heaven and earth,\nmeasure the patterns of yin and yang,\ndivide and judge human affairs,\nscatter the Ancestral Source,\ncorrupt simplicity with artifice,\nfabricate deceits in all directions,\nshift customs, topple norms,\nalter rites and clothing—\nall things become manifest.\n\nBells and drums, zithers and se,\nflutes and sheng pipes,\nascending and descending,\nadvancing and retreating,\nornate symbols and soaring rites—\nthree hundred ceremonies, three thousand decorums.\nDisputes arise, conflicts multiply,\naffairs flourish, words dance,\nthey argue to subdue, outwit to triumph—\nevery hair raised, endlessly so.\nThis is the daily increase of learning.\n\nThus the world abandons its root, forsakes its origin,\nturns to superficiality, clings to words.\nScholarship deepens, questions multiply—\nevery household knows, every door holds a sage.\nThe extreme: they emulate the Sage,\nto establish lord and subject.\n\nThose in accord, though powerless, are honored;\nthose who differ, though great in deed, are destroyed.\nThe Confucian way embraces love yet breeds factions—\nthose who align with them,\nthough wicked, are praised as good;\nthose who do not,\nthough virtuous, are condemned as evil.\n\nThus the world is restless,\nunable to tend to their kin,\nchasing trivial pursuits,\nserving their lords.\nThey blend the five flavors to nourish their mouths—\nrich, fragrant, sweet, and crisp—\nyet ignore the suffering of all living things.\nThey alter the five colors to please their eyes—\ndeep blacks, bright yellows, delicate hues—\nyet do not consider the people’s poverty.\nThey harmonize the five tones to delight their ears—\nperfecting the intricacies of bells and chimes—\nyet do not fear the world’s corruption.\nThey build high towers and vast halls to satisfy their desires—\nyet do not dread the people’s exhaustion.\nThey hunt and ride to sharpen their resolve—\nseeking personal gain,\nyet defying heaven’s will.\nThey exploit others’ lives to sustain themselves,\ndiminish others’ wealth for their own profit—\nthey do not mourn the world’s plight,\nonly take what they can.\nNone of this stems from benevolence and love—\nall defy the harmony of heaven and earth.\n\nAll these things:\nNot done for virtue’s sake,\nbut to please their lords.\n\nThus the world abandons sincerity,\nfeigns virtue, masks deceit,\nerodes harmony,\nnurtures violence’s roots,\nuntil it becomes custom—\ncleverness is prized as wisdom,\nthe people’s vital essence is drained,\ntheir labor increased,\ntheir natural goodness harmed,\ntheir burdens multiplied.\n\nAt such times,\nvalleys rebel against their rulers,\nthe seas each crown their own kings.\nTitles and power are revered,\nstrength dictates right,\nwrath and contention escalate,\nmight justifies force—\nthe strong enslave the weak,\nthe many dominate the few.\nThey nurse chaos as governance,\ndistort truth as policy—\nsubjects slay their lords,\nsons slay their fathers.\nThe greater the strife,\nthe fewer who can endure.\nMany seek, few attain—\nthe roads fill with sorrow,\nall speak of war.\nThe wails and groans rise—\nuntil men are boiled alive.\n\nWhy does this happen?\nBecause they adorn words and multiply affairs,\ncompeting to outdo each other.\n\nFor learning, the error lies in daily increase.\nThus the Sage abandons virtue and discards righteousness,\nreturns to the Great Dao,\nsevers wisdom and rejects teachings,\nseeking within oneself.\nHis words grow ever subtler,\nhis actions ever fewer.\nFor the Way is daily diminished.\n\nFade and vanish it must,\nnight and day without cease,\nenveloped in boundless obscurity,\nso the people know no shame.\nDestroy all texts, abandon all affairs—\nthe world will settle of its own accord.\nDiminish, diminish again,\nuntil all striving ceases.\nDiminish yet again.\n\nEschew renown, abandon the self,\npreserve the vital essence and spirit.\nGrasp the essence of virtue and power,\nsecure the mechanism of life and death.\nNeither rule as sovereign,\nnor teach as master.\nSilent as nonexistence,\narriving at non-action.\nTo reach the utmost non-being.\n\nHeaven and Earth act spontaneously,\nvirtue and beauty follow naturally,\nall things manifest themselves,\nthe myriad tribes harmonize,\nthe common folk wander in bewilderment,\nunaware of their path.\nIllumination emerges from within,\ntrusting the four seasons.\nThe spirit drifts freely,\nunbound by the mind’s designs.\nThe heart is empty within,\nlike wood floating,\nlike earth at rest.\nThey know not virtue nor righteousness,\nnor grasp ritual and propriety.\nThe heart desires nothing,\nthe will acts without purpose.\nTheir steps are steady and true,\ntheir gaze lofty and far.\n*Shuǎnshuǎn*—honest and direct.\n*Diāndiān*—elevated and boundless.\nTheir speech is silent,\ntheir essence profound.\nExternally, they seem like beasts,\nyet inwardly, they differ.\n\nSilent yet acting,\nas if no rulers exist,\ngoverning without action,\nthick with loyalty and sincerity,\nuntil great peace prevails.\nThe spirit rests, the essence breathes—\nlife and death preserved intact.\nAll things follow in succession,\naligned with virtue and power.\nTo act without acting,\nyet nothing remains undone.\n\nWhy so?\nBecause the ruler issues no commands,\nand the people hear none.\nThus, to take the world,\none must act through non-action.\nSpeak not of techniques,\nteach through non-teaching.\nDesire nothing as treasure,\nignorance as the key.\nTo act in accordance with the Dao,\nnothing remains unopened.\n\nTo take the world is to act through non-action.\nRelease the void, return to reality,\ntake extremes as substance.\nKnow the height of Heaven above,\nthe depth of Earth below.\nDiscern the division of yin and yang,\ngrasp the patterns of all things.\nBy day, see stars in the sky,\nby night, fish in the depths.\nThe ears harmonize with the eight winds,\nthe eyes perceive the fur of all beasts.\nThis is the utmost of thought—\nyet it profits nothing for survival.\nStrength tenfold that of Wu Ge,\nmight a hundredfold that of Meng Xin,\ncourage a thousandfold that of Xia Yu,\nterror commanding three armies,\nadvancing like radiant light,\nretreating like drifting clouds,\nstriking like thunder,\nunmoving as yin.\nThis is the peak of power—\nyet it profits nothing for victory.\n\nIf all beneath Heaven were to wield *The Rites* and *The Changes*,\nmaster *The Odes* and *The Documents*,\nunderstand laws and decrees,\nknow proclamations and orders,\neach household a clerk,\neach neighborhood an officer,\neach village a granary,\neach watchtower a treasury,\nsharp in judgment, strict in punishment,\nstrong in suppressing bandits—\nthe people would stand with heavy feet,\nglance with sidelong eyes,\nfathers and sons would betray one another,\nbrothers would harbor no trust.\nThis is the extreme of governance—\nyet it profits nothing for order.\n\nThus, to know what is known is to separate from Heaven,\nto act is to oppose Heaven’s intent,\nto act in affairs is to lose Heaven’s purpose.\nDaily increase in governance\nbrings a hundred flaws to fruition.\nActing yet failing to achieve,\nseeking yet never attaining—\nthe world descends into chaos,\nending in disorder.\nThis is called: when affairs arise,\nthey are insufficient to take the world—\nthus, disorder follows.\n\n**The Sage has no fixed heart.**\nThe Sage’s heart is formless,\nfor the Sage takes the people’s heart as their own.\nTo the virtuous, I am virtuous—\nextending their clarity.\nTo the unvirtuous, I too am virtuous—\ntransforming their nature.\nThus virtue is attained,\nand harmony is restored.\nTo the trustworthy, I am trustworthy—\nextending their sincerity.\nTo the untrustworthy, I too am trustworthy—\ntransforming their emotions.\nThus trust is attained,\nand peace is restored.\n\nThe Sage in the world—\nthe Emperor—\n*Wǎnwǎn*—his heart is empty.\nFor the world, his heart is vast,\nembracing all directions.\nThe people gaze with their ears and eyes,\nbut the Sage follows only the Dao.\n**Pointers:**\nVirtue and power are formless yet rule all beneath Heaven—\nthe heart without heart exists.\nHeaven and Earth act without action yet all things comply—\nthe thought without thought operates.\n\nFrom this, it is seen:\nThe heart without heart is the master of the heart.\nNon-use is the mother of use.\n\nHow to clarify this?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"What I use to be myself—\nam I truly myself?\nEven my body is not myself.\nI am like my body,\nyet my body is not myself.\nWhat my body uses to be itself—\nit is because I exist.\nBecause I distinguish,\nI am called ‘body,’\nyet I do not call myself so.\nWhat I use to be myself—\nit is because of the spirit.\nWhat the spirit uses to retain me—\nthe Dao makes it so.\nThe Dao generates the spirit,\nthe spirit generates the body.\nBody and spirit unite,\nand I am called ‘I.’\nI am not myself through the body,\nso my body does not belong to itself through me.\nI am not myself through the spirit,\nso the body and spirit are one.\nThe Dao, though not having, has—\nthis is the heart without heart.\nRelying on the Dao’s method,\npreserving the spirit’s way,\nstillness and purity as foundation,\nemptiness and nothingness as constant—\nthis cannot be achieved by heart or intent,\nnor realized by thought or deliberation.\n\nThus, the wise dwell thus:\nears and eyes see and hear,\nmind and thought deliberate,\nmeals and rest follow their time,\nfulfilling desires to their utmost.\nCleverness and insight surge without end,\nday and night without pause,\nexperiencing myriad paths,\nplanning ten thousand affairs,\ndetermining the beginnings of safety and peril,\nclarifying the roads of retreat and advance,\naiming to preserve the body and prolong life.\n\nYet thus,\nthe spirit is diminished,\nthe vital essence decayed,\nthe soul and vital breath scattered—\nlife and death are cut short.\nThey strive for their bodies,\nyet do not know that thought harms the body.\nWhen they sleep,\nmind and intent are idle,\nhearing and sight sealed,\nthought and deliberation cease,\nneither eating nor drinking,\nthe spirit harmonized,\nthe vital essence at ease,\nthe heart finds rest,\nthe body free of ailments.\n\nWhen calamity and harm befall,\ngreat sores erupt as rashes,\nbroken bones are set and bound,\nevery joint and orifice\nfulfills its natural desire.\n\nYet even in slumber,\none still finds fleeting peace—\nhow much more so when\none embodies the Dao and forgets the self,\never at ease.\n\nFor with a single body,\nto abandon thought is to turn peril into safety,\nto employ thought is to risk losing what is secure—\nhow much more so for those\nwho uphold virtue and Dao,\nalign with the numinous and bright,\nfollow Heaven’s intent,\nand nurture all living beings?\n\nNurturing all living beings\nrequires above all a tranquil mind.\n\nThus, the Sage establishes\na body without a body,\na heart without a heart,\na presence within absence,\na trust in what is not stored—\nabove, encompassing the transformation of virtue and Dao,\nbelow, embracing the hearts of all people.\n\nThe Sage has no heart,\nyet takes the hearts of the people as their own.\n\nNeither hating nor loving,\nneither favoring nor rejecting,\nnot feuding with the wicked,\nnot befriending the fortunate,\nnot consorting with the sincere,\nnot resenting the deceitful.\n\nBearing them as the earth bears all,\ncovering them as Heaven does,\nilluminating them as the sun,\ntransforming them as the numinous.\n\nFor humanity’s delusion\nhas endured for ages.\nTo suddenly make the unvirtuous virtuous—\nhow could it be so swift?\n\nOne must first comfort and soften them,\nlet them seek it themselves,\nimmerse and moisten them,\nlet them find it themselves—\nonly then may their clarity grow,\ntheir sincerity take root,\ntheir desires align,\ntheir hearts transform.\n\nThus it is said:\nbear them as the earth bears all,\ncover them as Heaven does,\nilluminate them as the sun,\ntransform them as the numinous.\n\nWhether great or small,\nall things are viewed as the self.\nAct before action begins,\ngovern before disorder arises,\ncutting off misfortune at its source,\nawakening fortune from its origin.\n\nBlock gradual corruption,\nprevent evil’s sprouting,\nsuppress vice and promote virtue.\n\nAbandon my desires,\ntake what brings the people ease;\nabandon my scheming,\nreturn to what is natural.\n\nLet nature allow all things to find ease,\nso the people live unaware in their daily lives.\n\nMove them with harmony,\nguide them with spontaneity,\nabove containing the intent of virtue and Dao,\nbelow attaining the heart of the numinous and bright,\nilluminating Heaven and Earth,\nconnecting virtue to all people.\n\nThe people bear no burdens,\nthe ruler holds no grievances,\nall find their true nature,\nall retain their vital essence.\nSeeing nothing, hearing nothing,\nforgetting their refined thoughts,\ntaking the ruler as their heart.\n\nWhen the ruler embodies the Dao,\ncovering people with the Way,\nthe people receive the ruler’s grace\nas if it were their own.\n\nTheir hearts follow the ruler,\nlike children returning to their mother.\nBowing, rising, resting, waking—\nall move as if in a marketplace.\n\nWith them in bowing and rising,\nwith them in floating and sinking,\nfollowing their external stirrings,\nreleasing their flexing and bending—\nwithout speaking, the world responds;\nwithout acting, all things endure.\nWithin the four seas,\nno commands are given,\nyet all transform their hearts.\n\nThe virtuous reach great virtue,\ntheir clarity deepening daily.\nThe wicked’s nature shifts,\ngradually becoming serene.\n\nSo-called unvirtuous—\nI also treat them with virtue,\nthus they attain virtue.\n\nThe trustworthy become utterly trustworthy,\nreaching beyond self-interest.\nThe deceitful’s nature transforms,\ndaily approaching sincerity.\n\nThe untrustworthy—\nI also treat them with trust,\nthus they attain trust.\n\nThe cruel and destructive return to virtue,\nthe deceitful return to truth.\nVirtue and vice, trust and doubt—\nall return to their natural state.\n\nThe reason the Way repeatedly returns to nature\nis that the ultimate Dao stands independent and profound,\nexisting since antiquity.\nIts power acts upon all things,\nyet all things cannot act upon it—\nthus it is called *natural*.\n\nNot that insects and birds\nare the ultimate measure.\n\nThose who embody this natural Dao\ncan harmonize with the dust of the world,\nstand without sharp edges,\nlet things transform of their own accord,\nall returning to virtue.\nAdvancing their singular will,\nas if by nature’s own impulse.\n\nAs the Sage says:\n*\"Without speaking, I nourish people with harmony.\"*\n\nAt such times,\nthe world is submerged in boundless unity,\ndrenched in supreme harmony.\nThe people forget their thoughts,\nlost in a daze of floating ease,\nlosing what they hated,\ngaining what they sought,\nmoving with Heaven,\nflowing with the Dao—\nnot driven by coercion to abandon vice,\nnot bound by teaching to change.\n\nThrough *wuwei*, transformation occurs unknowingly.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe ruler’s transformation\nis empty, still, and silent,\nlike withered wood,\nthe heart like a hollowed gourd,\nthe will like the sea,\nactions like valleys—\nnot distinguishing east and west,\nnot separating south and north,\nnot judging sweet and bitter,\nnot favoring white and black,\nnot enforcing square or round,\nnot fixing straight or crooked,\ndelving into the mysterious,\nstriving to remain hidden.\n\nAs the Sage says:\n*\"Awakened, awakened—\nfor all under Heaven, I muddle their hearts.\"*\n\nWithout governing things,\nfloating without end,\nabandoning what I would do,\nembracing what Heaven would gain,\nall things in tumult—\nall pour into their ears and eyes.\n\nAs the Sage says:\n*\"The people all pour into their ears and eyes.\"*\n\nThe ruler’s *wuwei*\nis serene, composed—\nHeaven and Earth as the furnace,\nGreat Harmony as the bellows,\nthe numinous as the wind,\nall things as the iron,\nvirtue as the master craftsman,\nthe Dao as the work—\nthe world verdant and lush,\nnothing left unmoistened.\n\nThe Sage contains such transformative power,\nthus able to benefit all things endlessly.\n\nThus can they mold the people’s hearts,\ntransform the customs of the age,\nabove encompassing all,\nbelow conquering all,\nperfecting all things,\nnothing left unmeasured,\nstirring all living beings,\nshaking the eight extremes.\n\nThe world is vast and indistinct,\nunaware of good and evil,\ndarkly effective, obscure in form,\nself-forming in law.\n\nThe Sage stirs all things,\nreturning them to the Dao,\nfollowing what is fitting to establish law.\n\n---\n**出生入死章**\n**Birth and Death**\n\nBirth and death,\nabandoning *wuwei*.\n\nThose who cling to life—thirteen types—\nare heavy with false vitality.\nThose who cling to death—thirteen types—\nare burdened with excess.\nYet the people live their lives,\ndriven to death’s edge for profit and name—\nthirteen types cling to strength.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause their obsession with

are called the **Death** [死] types.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe **Sage’s Dao/Way** [圣人之道],\nin motion has its **root** [因],\nin stillness has its **response** [应].\nThe four limbs and nine orifices—\nthese thirteen are the **external** [外] **apparatus** [具] of life and death.\n\nThe matters of **emptiness** [虚] and **solidity** [实],\nthe changes of **hardness** [刚] and **softness** [柔],\nare the **internal** [内] **counts** [数] of life and death.\nThus, thirteen are spoken of in total.\n\nBecause within are thirteen **Birth** [生] types,\nand without are the four limbs and nine

**non-action** [无为] of **governing all under Heaven** [治天下].\n\nAll who practice **non-action** [无为] are **Birth** [生] types.\n\nGreedy for life and **longevity** [利寿],\nfearing they may not attain it,\nthey **forcefully suppress** [强藏] their **heart** [心] and **intentions** [意],\n**close off** [闭塞] their **ears** [耳] and **eyes** [目].\nThey **guide and lead** [导引] their **steps** [步],\n**agitate** [动摇] their **hundred joints** [百节].\nThey **expel the old** [吐故] and **intake the new** [纳新],\n**blow warmly** [吹煦] and **breathe deeply** [呼吸].\nThey **adorn themselves with the Five Stars** [被服五星],\n**nourish with the Sun and Moon** [饮食日月].\nTheir **form** [形] and **spirit** [神] both **act** [作],\nyet they **never rest** [休息].\nThis is the **action** [有为] of **self-cultivation** [治身].\n\nThey **neglect Heaven’s timing** [废释天时],\n**solely rely on human affairs** [独任人事].\nThey **debase themselves** [贱强] to **pursue nobility** [求贵],\n**poverty** [贫] to **pursue wealth** [求富].\nThey **name hunger** [饥名] and **call thirst power** [渴势],\ntheir **heart** [心] is always **laden with seeking** [载求].\nTheir **clothing** [衣] and **food** [食] are **luxurious and extravagant** [奢泰],\ntheir **undertakings** [事] exceed their **capacity** [务].\nThis is the **action** [有为] of **household governance** [治家].\n\nThey **amass lands** [兼壤] for their **wealthy state** [富国],\n**lightly wage war** [轻战] and **take pleasure in arms** [乐兵].\nThey **establish threats** [底威] and **raise banners** [起节],\ntheir **name** [名] is **displayed** [显], their **power** [势] is **exalted** [隆].\nTheir **punishments** [刑] are **severe** [严], their **penalties** [罚] are **harsh** [峻],\n**rigid** [峭直] and **deeply engraved** [刻深].\nTheir **laws** [法] are **fine-meshed** [网周], their **governance** [察] is **poisonous** [操毒],\n**sparse in kindness** [少恩].\nThe **feudal lords** [诸侯] **fear and revile** [畏忌] them,\nthey are **often hailed as heroes** [俊雄].\nThey **pursue the title of Marquis** [公强求伯],\n**Marquis** [伯] to **King** [王].\nThis is the **action** [有为] of **state governance** [治国].\n\nThey **cherish ancestral and filial piety** [祖孝悌],\n**uphold benevolence and righteousness** [宗仁义],\n**refine rituals and propriety** [修礼节],\n**teach the people to adorn themselves** [教民知饰].\nThey **cultivate** [修治] **colors** [色] and **flavors** [味]\nto **please the people’s hearts** [以顺民心].\nThey **employ bells and drums** [钟鼓], **lutes and zithers** [琴瑟]\nto **harmonize the people’s wills** [以和民志].\nThe **sovereign speaks** [主言], the **ministers listen** [臣听],\nthe **sovereign moves** [主动], the **ministers follow** [臣随].\nThey **display achievements** [表功] and **exert force** [厉行],\n**opening with kindness** [开以恩厚],\n**proclaiming orders with splendor** [号令声华],\n**making the people cling** [使民亲附].\nThey **undertake all affairs themselves** [诸事任己],\n**rely on the people in all matters** [百方仰朝].\nThis is the **action** [有为] of **governing all under Heaven** [治天下].\n\nAll who practice **action** [有为] are **Death** [死] types.\n\nHence, the thirteen **Birth** [生] types—\n**emptiness** [虚], **without** [无], **purity** [清], **serenity** [静],\n**subtlety** [微], **sparseness** [寡], **softness** [柔], **weakness** [弱],\n**lowliness** [卑], **self-effacement** [损], **timeliness** [时],\n**harmony** [和], **restraint** [啬]—\nare the **Dao/Way’s** [道] beginnings,\nthe **abode of the spirit** [神].\nThus they are called the **Birth** [生] types.\n\nThe thirteen **Death** [死] types—\n**solidity** [实], **excess** [有], **impurity** [浊],\n**turbulence** [扰], **manifestness** [显], **abundance** [众],\n**hardness** [刚], **strength** [强], **elevation** [高],\n**fullness** [满], **excess** [过], **profligacy** [泰],\n**exhaustion** [费]—\ncontradict the **Dao/Way** [道],\noppose the **spirit** [神].\nThus they are called the **Death** [死] types.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe **Sage’s Dao/Way** [圣人之道],\nin motion has its **root** [因],\nin stillness has its **response** [应].\nThe four limbs and nine orifices—\nthese thirteen are the **external** [外] **apparatus** [具] of life and death.\n\nThe matters of **emptiness** [虚] and **solidity** [实],\nthe changes of **hardness** [刚] and **softness** [柔],\nare the **internal** [内] **\n\nThe **void** [虚] gives rise to **fullness** [充] and **solidity** [实],\n**emptiness** [无] sustains **constancy** [常存];\n**clarity** [清] brings **acuity** [聪] and **penetration** [达],\n**stillness** [静] yields **inner luminosity** [内明].\n\n**Subtlety** [微] generates **magnificence** [章] and **manifestness** [显],\n**sparseness** [寡] produces **abundance** [众];\n**softness** [柔] begets **hardness** [刚] and **robustness** [健],\n**weakness** [弱] fosters **firmness** [坚] and **strength** [强].\n\n**Lowliness** [卑] engenders **elevation** [高],\n**depletion** [损] spawns **advantage** [益];\n**timeliness** [时] ensures **permeation** [通] and **reach** [达],\n**harmony** [和] achieves **moderation** [中].\n\n**Frugality** [啬] results in **excess** [余]—\nthis is called **augmenting life** [益生].\n\nThose who practice this **Dao/Way** [道],\nalign with **Heaven and Earth** [天地],\nendure long in **the body** [为身],\nprosper far in **the realm** [为国].\nThough they wish otherwise,\n**Creation** [造化] does not comply.\n\nFor **emptiness** [虚] and **voidness** [无] are **clarity** [清] and **stillness** [静],\nand if one seeks to **unify with the Dao/Way** [合道],\nthey can give rise to **all things** [诸有].\nThus, though they wish otherwise,\n**Creation** [造化] does not permit it.\n\n**Solidity** [实] produces **emptiness** [空] and **voidness** [虚],\n**excess** [有] leads to **consumption** [消] and **extinction** [亡];\n**impurity** [浊] causes **obstruction** [塞] and **deafness** [听],\n**turbulence** [扰] brings **loss of luminosity** [失明].\n\n**Manifestness** [显] reverts to **subtlety** [微],\n**abundance** [众] returns to **sparseness** [寡],\n**hardness** [刚] yields **softness** [柔] and **flexibility** [韧],\n**strength** [强] generates **weakness** [弱] and **calamity** [殃].\n\n**Elevation** [高] descends to **lowliness** [卑] and **abasement** [贱],\n**fullness** [满] leads to **depletion** [损] and **emptiness** [空];\n**profligacy** [泰] invites **constraint** [困] and **poverty** [穷],\n**exhaustion** [费] beckons **misfortune** [祸].\n\nThese thirteen—\nthey are the **burdens** [累] of **form** [形],\nthe **roots** [元] of **disaster** [祸].\nThus, when one acts in accordance with them,\nthey drive one to **extremity** [穷].\n\nIn **the body** [为身], they bring **short-lived endurance** [不久],\nin **the realm** [为国], they cause **instability** [不平].\nThough one wishes otherwise,\n**Heaven and Earth** [天地] do not obey.\n\n**Action** [有为] must meet **defeat** [败],\n**natural law** [理数] is immutable—\nthus **Heaven and Earth** [天地] do not comply.\n\nYet the people all cherish their **life** [生] and **augment it** [益] without ceasing,\nall love their **bodies** [身] and **favor them** [爱] without end.\nTheir **movements** [动] lead to **action** [有为],\ntheir **scheming** [智虑] constantly arises.\n\n**Human existence** [人之生],\nis the **path to Death** [动之死地].\n\nThus they **forsake emptiness** [虚] for **solidity** [实],\n**abandon voidness** [无] for **dependence** [依有],\n**leave clarity** [清] for **impurity** [浊],\n**turn from stillness** [静] to **turbulence** [扰].\n\nThey **change subtlety** [微] into **manifestness** [显],\n**transform sparseness** [寡] into **abundance** [众],\n**reject softness** [柔] for **hardness** [刚],\n**discard weakness** [弱] to **exalt strength** [强].\n\nThey **abandon lowliness** [卑] for **elevation** [高],\n**forsake depletion** [损] for **fullness** [满],\n**indulge excess** [过] and **create profligacy** [泰],\n**release moderation** [和] to **pursue extravagance** [泰].\n\nThey **act with intent** [有为],\n**discard frugality** [啬] to **spend wastefully** [施费].\n\nWhy is this so?\nThey **possess their bodies** [有其身] yet **forget the Dao/Way of life** [忘生之道].\n\n「They are called the disciples of death.\n\nThus, the practitioners of **life mastery** [摄生], with their lofty and boundless Dao/Way, stand apart in grandness and transcend the mundane, soaring far beyond the world’s constraints. They do not cling to the **customs of the masses** [俗], nor are they bound by the **affairs of the world** [世]. They diminish their **form** [形] in the **boundless** [无境], and let their **spirit** [神] drift in the **void** [无内]. They do not regard life as gain, nor death as harm. Their **comprehensive cultivation** [兼施] knows no limits—all things, great or small, are seen as the self, with neither aversion nor attachment. Their **spirit and virtue/power** [精神隆盛] are vast and harmonious, their blessings and **virtue/power** [福德] converge naturally. The Dao/Way is their central sovereign, its radiance visible without. In accordance with **natural transformations** [自然之变], they respond effortlessly—nothing in heaven, earth, or all things can defeat them.\n\nWhen they walk on land, **rhino-beasts and tigers** [兕虎] cannot harm them; when they enter battle, the **five weapons** [五兵] cannot wound them. No added strength can conquer them, nor can any thrown force subdue them—**their spirit and qi** [神气] are in perfect accord, and the intent to harm is already nullified within.\n\nFor those skilled in **life mastery** [摄生], their actions are such that, with no love or hate for all things, they view each thing as if it were their own body. Thus, all things respond in kind, returning affection without malice, as **natural law** [理数] must.\n\nLike shadows following form, it is not by **skill or technique** [法术] that they manipulate form, but by its inherent nature.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause **sounds echo in response** [声响相应], and **things follow their kind** [物从其类]. **Rhino-beasts and tigers** [兕虎] cannot harm the **formless** [无形], and the **five weapons** [五兵] cannot strike the **void of substance** [无质]. The practitioners of **life mastery** [摄生] have already extinguished the **thief’s or harmer’s intent** [贼害之心] within, and the **forms of death and injury** [死伤之形] vanish without.\n\nThus, **tigers have no place to set their claws** [虎无所措其爪], and **weapons find no opening for their blades** [兵无所容其刃], for they possess **no ground of death** [无死地]—this truth is not hollow.\n\n**Dao/Way generates brilliance** [道生章]\nThe **inherent nature** [禀] of things born from the Dao/Way,\nThe **virtue/power** [德] bestowed that grants life to all things.\nThe **forms** [物形] of all things vary in every direction,\nThe **fulfillment of effort** [势成] that completes their shapes.\n\nThus, all things attain life through this,\nAnd those who **honor the Dao/Way and value virtue/power** [尊道贵德] are like **sages and worthies** [视宗正].\nThe Dao/Way is honored, virtue/power is valued—**grand and flourishing** [高大盛].\nNone can confer titles upon it, for its name is **constant naturalness** [常自然].\nThe Dao/Way’s **generation of life** [道生] leaves nothing unborn,\nIts **virtue/power’s nurturing** [德畜] leaves nothing incomplete.\nIt **lengthens** [长] without fail,\nIt **nourishes** [育] without rest,\nIt **completes** [成] without end,\nIt **ripens** [熟] without error,\nIt **sustains** [养] without harm,\nIt **covers** [覆] without concealment.\n\nTo **give birth without possession** [生而不有] is to do so without **hoarding** [赀],\nTo **act without reliance** [为而不恃] is to do so without **intent** [所为].\nTo **lengthen without slaughter** [长而不宰] is to do so without **purpose** [以为].\nThis is called the **mysterious virtue/power** [玄德], which **virtue/power does not know** [德不知].\n\n**Pointing to the return** [指归]:\nThe **sage’s wisdom** [圣知] unfolds—\nNot from the **heavens and earth** [天下],\nNor by **earthly means** [地出],\nBut **inherent within the body** [内在於身],\nAnd **manifest in all things** [外在於物].\nGuided by **natural law** [自然], it permeates without limit.\nFollowing **patterns and effects** [因循效象], it is inexhaustible.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way is **formless** [虚], virtue/power is **voidless** [无],\nYet they do not lose their **heart** [心].\nHeaven is **exalted** [尊], earth is **lowly** [卑],\nYet they do not violate their **principles** [节].\n\nWhy?\nBecause **knowing arises from the void** [有知无],\nAnd **human discernment follows things** [由人识物].\nThings of the same **kind** [类], when **voidless** [无], give rise to **possession** [有];\nThe **formless** [虚] generates the **solid** [实].\nTo **perceive subtlety and know its manifestation** [见微知着],\nTo **observe beginnings and foresee endings** [观始睹卒],\nIs not a matter of **clever skill** [巧能],\nBut the **natural workings of things** [自然之物], which the **sage follows** [圣人因之],\nIn **harmony with heaven** [与天周密].\n\nThus, **knowing the Dao/Way through its ultimate formlessness** [太虚之虚],\nThey **draw from nothingness** [无所不禀].\nThis is the **inherent nature of things** [物性].\n\n**Understanding virtue/power through its supreme voidlessness** [至无之无],\nThey **bestow without limit** [无所不授].\nThis is the **granting of life** [授物命].\n\nThe Dao/Way **acts without possession** [无为之为],\nIts **manifestation** [品] in all directions has no **beginning** [首].\nTo **act without possession** [为而不有].\n\nVirtue/power **sets without attachment** [无设之设],\nIt **fulfills the forms of all things** [遂万物之形] without **doing** [事].\nTo **complete without claiming** [成功不居].\n\nThus, they can **refine life and destiny** [陶性命],\n**Regulate feelings and thoughts** [治情意],\n**Shape resolve and cravings** [造志欲],\nAnd **transform all affairs** [化万事].\n\nWhat are **life, nature, feelings, thoughts, resolve, and cravings** [性命情意志欲]?\nAsk of the **differences among these six** [六者之差].\n\nThat which is **inherited from the Dao/Way** [所禀於道] and forms **body and shape** [成形体],\nVaries in every direction—**all things and beings** [人物],\n**Male and female** [男女], **sage’s contemplation and bold daring** [圣虑、勇怯],\n**Small and great, long and short** [小大、修短],\n**Kindness and meanness, greed and cruelty** [仁廉、贪酷],\n**Strength and weakness, lightness and heaviness** [强弱、轻重],\n**Sounds and colors, appearance and substance** [声色、状貌],\n**Refinement and coarseness, high and low** [精粗、高下]—\nThis is called **nature** [性].\nAll this is **inherited from the Dao/Way** [禀於道],\nArises from within, and **never changes** [终焉不变].\n\nThat which is **bestowed by virtue/power** [所授於德],\nRiches and poverty, **early death and longevity, suffering and joy** [夭寿苦乐],\nSome encounters are **fitting**, others **unfitting** [有宜不宜]—\nThis is called **heavenly destiny** [天命].\nAll this is **received from virtue/power** [受於德],\nComes from without, and **progress or retreat is in my hands** [进退由我].\n\nTo **meet with rulers and parents** [遭遇君父],\nThe **movements of heaven and earth** [天地之动],\nTo **encounter fortune or misfortune** [逆顺昌衰],\nTo **face life or death** [存亡及我]—\nThis is called **encountered destiny** [遭命].\nIt is **fortuitous** [偶然], not **fixed** [非常定].\n\nWhen **all things are arranged** [万物陈列],\nAnd I **undertake affairs** [将有事],\nTo **deploy or abandon** [举错废置],\nTo **take or leave, approach or withdraw** [取舍去就],\nWhen **auspicious or inauspicious events come** [吉凶来],\nWhen **calamity or fortune arrives** [祸福至]—\nThis is called **following destiny** [随命].\nIt is **obtained by my actions** [随我所为].\n\nTo **move from nature and destiny** [因性而动],\nTo **interact with things and awaken** [接物感寤],\nTo **love or hate, like or dislike** [爱恶、好憎],\nTo **startle or fear, rejoice or anger** [惊恐、喜怒],\nTo **grieve or delight, worry or rage** [悲乐、忧恚],\nTo **advance or retreat, take or give** [进退、取与]—\nThis is called **feelings** [情].\nThey arise from **nature** [性], and come **unconsciously** [不觉而至].\n\nTo **act from destiny** [因命而动],\nTo **generate thought and deliberation** [生思虑],\nTo **establish plans and strategies** [定计谋],\nTo **judge safety and peril** [决安危],\nTo **understand all affairs** [通万事],\nTo **discern right and wrong** [明是非],\nTo **differentiate the same and the different** [别同异]—\nThis is called **thought** [意].\nIt moves **along with destiny** [缘命], and is **by my doing** [由我所为].\n\nTo **stem from feelings and thoughts** [因於情意],\nTo **move outward and connect with things** [动而之外],\nTo **always find delight** [与物相连，常有所悦],\nTo **summon fortune or misfortune** [招麾祸福],\nTo **accomplish fame and achievement** [功名所遂]—\nThis is called **resolve** [志].\nThe **movement of nature and destiny** [性命之动] leads to **feelings and thoughts** [情意],\nAnd from these, **resolve is strengthened** [因而自强].\n\nTo **align with nature and destiny** [顺性命],\nTo **fit with feelings and thoughts** [适情意],\nTo **be drawn by diverse kinds** [牵於殊类],\nTo **be bound by all affairs** [系於万事],\nTo **form attachments that are hard to untie** [结而难解]—\nThis is called **craving** [欲].\nThough **craving arises from feelings and thoughts** [出乎情意],\nIt **exceeds nature and destiny** [侈於性命],\nAnd **must not be indulged** [不可纵].\n\nAll these six—**nature, destiny, feelings, thoughts, resolve, and craving** [性命情意志欲]—\nAre **rooted in virtue/power and the Dao/Way** [原道德],\nAnd **thousandfold transformations** [千变万化] know no end.\nOnly those who **hear of virtue/power and the Dao/Way** [闻道德者] can follow their **principles** [则].\n\nThe **Dao/Way is the principle** [则], and **those who attain the principle** [得本者]\nMove freely in **advance and retreat**, unshackled by **feelings and cravings** [情欲].\n\n**Nature is refined, destiny is high** [性精命高],\nIt can be **transformed or altered** [可变可易].\n**Nature is coarse, destiny is low** [性粗命下],\nIt can be **diminished or enhanced** [可损可益].\nIf one **grasps the root and principle** [得根本],\nThey are not **stuck in possession or void** [滞有无].\n\nThus, **heaven, earth, and all beings** [天地人物] contain **heart and core** [含心包核],\nBelonging to their **kind** [有类].\nThey **obtain the Dao/Way to be born** [得道以生],\nYet the Dao/Way **does not possess their virtue/power** [而道不有其德].\nThe Dao/Way **generates life** [道生], yet **does not claim it** [未有].」\n\nThe **One** attained brings completion,\nYet the **One** does not seek its own fortune.\nAll things honor and revere it,\nCherish and worry over it,\nYet it never repays their virtue/power.\nAttaining the completion of the **One**,\nThe **One** requires no thanks—\nThis is called *\"when principle reaches its utmost, opposites vanish.\"*\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe **Dao/Way** is lofty and its virtue/power vast,\nDeep beyond words—\nThings cannot enrich it,\nTitles cannot exalt it.\nIt acts without doing,\nYet all things act through it.\nIt is not forced by anything,\nYet nature remains ever spontaneous.\n\nIt acts without acting toward things,\nYet things act through it without contrivance—\nPrinciple and law move as they must,\nNot compelled by things to do so.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** as a thing:\nLooked upon, it has no door,\nExamined, it has no gate,\nProbed, it has no form,\nMapped, it has no shape.\nMind cannot exhaust it,\nSpeech cannot convey it.\nAll things are born through it,\nYet it is not diminished by them.\nAll things return to it,\nYet it is not filled by them.\n\nAbove and below, it knows no end,\nBroad and vast without boundary.\nEbbing and flowing, curving and bending—\nIts measure cannot be fathomed.\nIt plays in the autumn hair’s breadth,\nYet is not deemed small;\nIt encompasses all heavens,\nYet is not deemed great.\nIts radiance shines like emerald and purple,\nYet it does not alter its resolve.\nIn darkness and decay,\nIt does not change its nature—\nThis is called **constancy**.\n\nIt moves without exertion,\nHolds no favorites.\nIt bestows nature and destiny,\nYet does nothing in particular.\n\nIts virtue/power flows through all things,\nYet cannot be reclaimed;\nIts grace binds and its blessings endure,\nYet cannot be returned.\n**Dao/Way** and virtue/power lend and give birth,\nLike the sound of a *tuóluò* flute—\nQi issues forth endlessly,\nNever to be recovered.\n\nIt gazes upon all under heaven without depletion,\nAchieves and completes without exhaustion.\nToward all things, does it merely give life?\nIt shapes them, establishes them, arranges them into ranks,\nStops them to perfect them,\nEnds them to begin anew,\nLeads them to follow or precede.\n\nLike water to fish—\nLife, form, beginning, and end,\nNever parting for an instant.\nIt both follows and precedes,\nWith spirit dwelling within,\nGreat Harmony preserved.\nThe clear ascends to accumulate,\nThe turbid descends to congeal.\nHeaven is round through it,\nEarth is square through it.\nYin finds its yin,\nYang finds its yang.\nSun and moon shine through it,\nStars move through it.\nThe four seasons transform through it,\nThe Five Phases overcome one another through it.\n\nFire burns through it,\nWater chills through it.\nGrasses and trees bend through it,\nMetals and stones harden through it.\nFlavors are sweet or bitter through it,\nColors are dark or bright through it.\nSounds rise or fall through it,\nChanges stretch or contract through it.\nMountains and hills stagnate through it,\nWinds and rains move through it.\nScaled creatures swim through it,\nFeathered creatures fly through it.\nBeasts run through it,\nHumans gain wisdom through it.\nDiverse kinds and races all exist through it,\nYet perish when they oppose its transformations.\n\nAll heavens differ in form,\nWaters and lands vary in shape,\nCustoms clash, benefits and harms diverge,\nAppearance and desire are deceptive,\nIntentions and cravings are incomprehensible.\nEven yin and yang cannot reach them,\nSun and moon cannot illuminate them—\nAll begin and end through it.\n\nOpening the mouth, stretching the eyes,\nBending, tilting, bowing, or rising—\nIn the space of a breath,\nIn the space of inhaling and exhaling,\nWhere spirit traverses,\nWhere mind and intention dwell,\nWhere love and attraction take hold,\nWhere male and female transform—\nIt guides all things,\nDoes all things,\nGives life without claiming reward,\nActs without demanding return,\nNurtures without possession.\n\nAll under heaven is bewildered,\nNone can know it.\nDark and silent, formless and empty,\nYet it gives birth and completes—\nNot like the boundless void,\nFor long has humanity been deluded,\nThus they do not recognize it.\n\nSome say:\n**\"Dao/Way** is the divine mystery of heaven and earth;\nHeaven and earth are the manifestation of **Dao/Way**.\"\n\nOthers claim:\n**\"Dao/Way** is the function of heaven and earth,\nHeaven and earth are the substance of **Dao/Way**.\"\nThis is the shortsightedness of a gnat in a jar,\nThe limited wisdom of lice in clothing—\nUnfit to speak of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nHow may this be made clear?\n**Dao/Way** encompasses all heavens.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Heaven and earth have their kinds,\nYet **Dao/Way** has no form.\nThings with kinds all have limits,\nThings without form know no end.*\nTo entrust the limited to the boundless\nIs like grasses and trees torn from the earth,\nOr stars torn from the sky—\nInsufficient to illustrate it.\n\nYet to say otherwise\nIs to fail to grasp\nHow having and not-having embrace,\nHow emptiness and reality contain each other—\nLike the rind of a gourd,\nUnaware of the tendrils’ neighboring growth,\nOr lice hiding in fur,\nUnaware of the multitude in the city.\n\nThus, beyond the cosmos yet within its domain,\nUnconstrained by any prohibition,\nBound by no regulation—\nSafety and peril, ebb and flow,\nKnow no inside or outside.\nAll follow the same wind,\nPoint in the same direction,\nHarmonious and obedient to its decree,\nPerfect and unblemished,\nWithout flaw or ruin.\nTen thousand blessings abound—\n**Dao/Way** covers them all.\nIts deeds are mysterious, its work hidden,\nUnrevealed to the world.\nAll under heaven sees it not,\nYet it never ceases to act.\n\nIt responds without being seen—\nIf seen, it is not true.\nIts constant speech never reaches,\nIts extraordinary nature cannot be recognized.\nThis is called **mysterious virtue/power**,\nVirtue/power that aids without end.\n\n---\n**The Beginning of All Under Heaven**\nAll under heaven has a **beginning**—\nA **non-doing body** that is the mother of all things,\nThe root of ten thousand beings.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nIt holds to spontaneity—\nThus it knows its offspring:\nAll things arise without intervention.\nHaving known its offspring,\nIt never strays—\nThus it returns to its mother,\nReverting to its origin.\nDeath does not bring peril,\nLife ends in tranquility.\n\nSeal its senses—\nEyes and ears are darkened,\nIts doors and openings are closed—\nNo speech all its life,\nNo toil or labor—\nThis is ease.\n\nOpen its senses—\nEars and eyes are sharp,\nIts affairs are accomplished,\nIts fame and deeds are manifest—\nYet its life is unsalvageable.\n\nSeeing the small is called **clarity**—\nPerceiving what has not yet sprouted.\nHolding to softness is called **strength**—\nHarmony as constancy.\n\nUsing its light—\nSpirit moves outward,\nReturning to its clarity—\nSpirit moves inward.\nNo harm befalls the body—\nThis is not greatness,\nBut donning the **Dao/Way’s** ordinary garb,\nFollowing its decrees.\n\n---\n**Pointing to the Return:**\nThe **Dao/Way** as a thing—\nFormless, shapeless,\nWithout mind or intention,\nYet never forgets or ponders,\nWithout knowledge or awareness,\nWithout head or direction,\nWithout action or deed,\nEmpty, insubstantial, serene and still,\nVague, hazy, pure and tranquil.\n\n「Its transformations unfold—\nChange within the unchanging,\nMotion within the still,\nReturning to give birth to cover,\nCovering to return to give birth,\nHaving to birth nothingness,\nNothingness to birth having,\nReturn and cover interwoven,\nNaturally holding fast—\nActing without action, all things flourish,\nNot acting yet all things succeed.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way’s** embodiment of *wuwei* (無為),\nIs the origin of heaven and earth.\nSo it is said, \"Heaven and earth have a beginning.\"\n\n*Wuwei* is subtle and profound,\nEncompassing all in secrecy;\nSmooth and tranquil, yet nothing escapes its sway.\nLife and growth are keen and bright,\nSkillful and discerning—\nReaching all corners, yet none remain untouched.\nTherefore, it is said: \"The origin of all things,\nIs the mother of ten thousand affairs.\"\nThis is the mother of all under heaven.\n\nThe sage attains it,\nAnd reverses with all things.\nHaving obtained its child,\nThus able to grasp the **Dao/Way’s** essence,\nTo penetrate heaven’s principles,\nTo birth as its origin,\nTo open the gate of affairs,\nTo harness all knowledge of ten thousand realms,\nTo exhaust the tongues of the multitude,\nTo exhaust the cunning of divergent schools,\nTo drain the arts of a hundred families.\n\nAll knowledge of ten thousand realms,\nThe arts of a hundred families,\nAll spring from the **Dao/Way**, hence called its child.\nAttaining the **Dao/Way’s** perfect harmony,\nNot only does one cultivate virtue alone,\nBut responds to every situation with effortless skill—\nWondrous uses without measure.\nWithout measure in its use,\nIt guides all things back to the **Dao/Way**,\nHence it is said: \"Having known its child,\nOne again guards its mother.\"\n\nMoreover, the **Dao/Way** adapts to human affairs,\nTurning with the times’ transformations,\nNurturing and refining it,\nEnding to begin anew,\nSudden in its changes,\nPenetrating spirits, commanding ghosts,\nManifest in the formless,\nNo matter unaddressed,\nExhausting the inexhaustible,\nReaching the unreachable—\nYet through it all, one carves and refines,\nReturning to guard its mother.\n\nReturn and guard its mother,\nThe root of all under heaven,\nRoaming in the mysterious depths,\nA lifetime without peril.\nPerishing yet without peril.\n\nThus the sage can:\nPlug his ears to preserve clarity,\nClose his eyes to preserve insight,\nSilence speech to preserve virtue,\nAbandon deeds to preserve efficacy—\nHearing without listening aligns with heaven’s acuity,\nSeeing without gazing aligns with heaven’s brilliance,\nTransforming without words aligns with heaven’s **virtue/power** (德),\nActing without striving aligns with heaven’s function.\n\nWhat is guarded is essential,\nWhat is cultivated is thorough.\nThe **Dao/Way’s** luminous virtue is never obscured,\nAnd heaven and earth’s concerns are fully realized.\n\nThus one can echo and shadow,\nIllumine without end,\nAs the origin of blessings,\nAs the ancestor of transformations—\nFlowing through all, permeating the great middle,\nThings follow in accord, the world without toil.\nThe **Dao/Way’s** use is never exhausted,\nLike echoes and shadows to form and sound—\nThus a lifetime without toil.\n\nTherefore, straining eyes harms clarity,\nForcing ears harms acuity,\nHasty speech undermines virtue,\nCunning deceit ruins efficacy.\nThus, with mouth wide open,\nEyes and ears stretched taut,\nKnowledge and perception arise,\nAll things multiply and thrive,\nStirring the heart, raising thoughts—\nFame and deeds are accomplished.\nFame and deeds accomplished,\nCalamity arrives, blessings end,\nMotion triggers the **Heavenly Net** (羅天網),\nStillness invites the **Earthly Retribution** (地殃),\nSpirits and **Dao/Way** cannot aid,\nCreation cannot sustain—\nCommon folk lose their lives,\nStates perish in ruin.\n\nOpening its senses,\nAccomplishing its affairs,\nNot embodying the **Dao/Way** yet acting—\nThus its life is unsalvageable.\n\nHence the sage withdraws from deeds,\nAbandons affairs,\nEmbodies the **Dao/Way’s** heart,\nFollows **virtue/power** (德) with intention,\nUnites the boundless mechanisms,\nHolds the essentials of nature—\nSoaring before the origin,\nGathering in the profound,\nClarity acts as if unheard,\nInsight as if unseen,\nSprouts and seeds undisturbed,\nThe subtle threads uncut—\nBrightly perceiving alone,\nThe changes of the formless,\nPenetrating the unexpressed,\nReaching the limitless—\nNot even the slightest evil can arise,\nNot even the greatest calamity can approach.\nSeeing the small is called **clarity**—\nThus evil ceases, good prevails.\n\nActing and refining,\nCutting off speech, extinguishing thought,\nAccumulating softness, embodying weakness,\nReturning to the state of no awareness—\nPunishing violence, aiding the few,\nAligning with the divine transformations,\nThe unconquerable is conquered,\nThe unattainable is achieved,\nStrength cannot be added,\nAll under heaven cannot scheme.\nHolding to softness is called **strength**.\n\nGoverning people, managing things,\nIn harmony with yin and yang,\nInternally using its light,\nYet externally causing no offense—\nClothing, food, tilling, and harvest,\nSilk weaving with abundance,\nBlessings accumulate, misfortunes dissolve,\nPeople are provided, households are supported,\nThe heart does not bear the weight of seeking,\nThe humble do not aspire to the noble,\nThe poor do not envy the rich,\nThe refined honor simplicity,\nWithin and without, nothing is excessive—\nServing above, nourishing below,\nHuman ways fully realized.\n\nUsing its external light,\nReturning to its internal **clarity**,\nReturning to its internal **clarity**—\nSpirit and insight are never depleted,\nStored like a coiled serpent, firmly held,\nDaring not to call it wisdom.\n\n---」\n\n「Like the great rivers and seas sharing the same purpose as Heaven,\nTo extinguish the **Three Five**—\nTo harm them with affairs,\nTo fill and block them,\nSo they cannot be discerned.\n\nAs **malaria** and **deafness**,\nIn harmony with Heaven and Earth,\nAs **mysterious** and **silent**,\nExhausting the Dao,\nDeparting leaves no blame,\nDefying calamities and ruining bandits,\nFloating **virtue** laden with peace—\nNothing it cannot overcome.\n\nBecause it does not leave the body to suffer.\n\nThus, when a person enters the Dao,\nThe Dao also enters the person,\nOur Dao merging within—\nSubmerged and unified as one.\n\nPreserving stillness to attain **emptiness**,\nI become the Dao’s dwelling,\nWith all things in their natural state,\nChaotic yet complete in every detail,\nReturning to the origin, to the beginning—\nThe Dao covers me like a robe.\n\nA robe—\nLayer upon layer.\n\nMerging with the **constant Dao** in **virtue/power**,\nLike piling garments upon the body,\nHence it is said the Dao covers me,\nThis is the **constant Dao** that envelops me.\n\nIn the chapter *Conducting the Great Dao*:\n\nIt is I who, with knowledge and clarity,\nConduct myself in the Great Dao—\nRefining the **constant Dao**,\nOnly fearing **Shi** lest I stumble and fall.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and smooth,\nEasy and level—\nYet people prefer narrow paths,\nDelight in reckless action.\n\nMorning is pristine, yet palaces are adorned with excess,\nFields are overgrown with weeds and pests,\nGranaries are empty, agriculture neglected,\nGarments flash with five colors,\nSwords are worn for slaughter,\nFeasts are indulged in gluttony and drunkenness,\nWealth is hoarded like mountains,\nAll treasures compared to a sovereign’s.\n\nThis is called **plundering, boasting, and hoarding**—\nA perversion of the Dao,\nA rebellion against Heaven.\n\n**Pointing to return**:\nThe Dao’s **virtue/power** is not a matter of cleverness,\nThus it can mold Heaven and Earth,\nShape yin and yang,\nAnd Heaven and Earth cannot deceive it.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not rely on cleverness,\nThus they contain and release transformations,\nKill and give life to all beings,\nAnd all things cannot escape them.\n\nIf the Dao **releases** and **returns** to cleverness,\nThen the body cannot preserve itself,\nAnd how could Heaven and Earth be shaped,\nOr yin and yang be realized?\n\nIf Heaven and Earth **release** and **return** to cleverness,\nThen the body cannot sustain itself,\nAnd how could transformations be embraced,\nOr all things be fully nurtured?\n\nThis so-called **naturalness**,\nLike water naturally moistening below,\nFire naturally blazing upward—\nWithin their inherent nature,\nIt is not a matter of contrivance.\n\nThus, **emptiness** and **non-action**,\n**non-knowledge** and **non-desire**—\nThe heart of **virtue/power** and the intent of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Clarity** and **stillness** mirroring the **form**,\n**Non-action** responding to circumstances—\nThe movement of **virtue/power** and the transformation of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Virtue/power** responds to circumstances,\nHeaven and Earth move and transform—\nLike images within a mirror,\nEchoes in empty space—\nThis is no difficult matter.\n\nHow does one know this?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"What the Dao produces, Heaven nurtures,\nBeginning without beginning,\nGiving life without giving life,\nPreserving without preserving,\nDestroying without destroying.\nThat which has no beginning, no giving life,\nNo preserving, no destroying—\nThis is the origin of **virtue/power**.*\n\nAll these things,\nAre the **verifications** of naturalness,\nThe **constants** of transformation.\n\nThus, when a person’s actions do not align with the Dao,\nThe Dao does not favor them;\nWhen they do not align with **virtue/power**,\n**Virtue/power** does not aid them;\nWhen they do not align with Heaven,\nHeaven does not shelter them;\nWhen they do not align with Earth,\nEarth does not bear them.\n\nWhat the Dao does not favor,\nWhat **virtue/power** does not aid,\nWhat Heaven does not shelter,\nWhat Earth does not bear—\nThis is where calamities linger,\nAnd blessings never draw near.\n\nPeople draw **qi** from **virtue/power**,\nTake form from Heaven and Earth—\nIf their actions do not align with the Dao,\nThey naturally find no peace,\nThus blessings recede daily,\nAnd misfortunes approach.\n\nTherefore, the **mysterious sages** and **recluses**,\nBearing the Dao and embracing its **completeness**,\nLifting **insight** and grasping **clarity**,\nAligning with the Dao and honoring **virtue/power**,\nDiscarding cleverness and abandoning the body,\nGrasping their resolve with dread,\nOnly fearing to stumble and fall.\n\nThus they strive for **cleverness** that is not clever,\nPursue **clarity** that is not clear,\nTrust in softness and weakness,\nTilling the land for their sustenance,\nEver content with moderation,\nReturning to the **nameless**,\nTrembling with fear,\nLest they lose **naturalness**,\nAnd their misfortunes extend to Heaven and Earth,\nAffecting all people.\n\nThose who, with knowledge and clarity,\nConduct themselves in the Great Dao—\nOnly fear **Shi**.\n\nThus auspicious responses and blessings arrive,\nLike shadows following form,\nEchoes answering sound,\nWithout expectation or prearrangement,\nArising as if born together—\nHence the Great Dao is vast and smooth,\nIts transformation formless,\nLike something distant yet near,\nLike something dim yet bright.\n\nSimple and vast without blemish,\nConcise yet easy to follow,\nAchieving success without contrivance,\nAttaining blessings without effort—\nHeaven and Earth follow it,\nAnd all things come to life from it.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and smooth.\n\nYet people turn away from it,\nUsing their cleverness,\nEmbracing deceit and neglecting the Dao,\nReversing Earth and defying Heaven,\nExalting knowledge and valuing cleverness,\nCheating spirits and mocking gods,\nAdorning false governance with perversion,\nPursuing deceit while abandoning truth,\nInventing customs and altering institutions,\nCreating affairs and accomplishing deeds.\n\nPeople delight in narrow paths.\n\nPalaces are grand, gates towering high,\nAdorned with bizarre embellishments,\nLayered with colorful patterns—\nCleverness as their foundation,\nCunning as their measure.\n\nMorning is pristine, yet deception is their axe,\nFalsehood is their adze—\nWielding schemes and manipulating numbers,\nWeaving fine cloth while exploiting labor,\nNeglecting fields, letting weeds and pests flourish,\nHarvests failing, granaries empty.\n\nFields are overgrown, granaries are empty.\n\nGarments flash with five colors,\nSilks and brocades in dark yellows,\nFine linen and delicate embroidery,\nSmooth as deer, radiant as phoenixes.\n\nWearing garments of five colors.\n\nSharp blades and sturdy armor,\nMighty crossbows and powerful bows,\nLight chariots and swift steeds,\nMany reckless and fierce warriors.\n\nWealth is heavy, status honored,\nPower and influence prevail—\nSlaughtering without restraint,\nSubjugating the common folk,\nJealous of the upright, resentful of the generous,\nHating loyalty, poisoning trust,\nBinding with evil, joining with falsehood,\nHarming the good, nurturing enmity,\nValuing contention and martial prowess—\nNone they do not oppress,\nForcing borders to expand,\nEver plotting to assassinate rulers.\n\nWearing swords of slaughter.\n\nFeasts overflow with five flavors,\nPests swarm in abundance,\nCutting into wombs, killing unborn—\nA defiance of Heaven’s intent,\nEver drunk and gluttonous,\nTaking without restraint.\n\nIndulging in food and drink.\n\nHoarding gold and jade,\nPiling wealth like mountains—\nAll treasures compared to a sovereign’s.»\n\nExcess in wealth and goods.\nStrange and wondrous comings and goings,\nHonor and splendor radiant and bright,\nDetached from the masses, severed from custom,\nStanding alone in tumultuous times,\nPraised as a great sage—\nThis is called **theft of glory**.\n\nExceeding the crowd in vice, great in evil,\nCrimes heavy, calamities deep,\nThe virtuous father does not rear them,\nThe enlightened ruler does not employ them,\nThe Dao does not favor them,\nThe spirits do not dwell with them,\nHeaven does not shelter them,\nAll things hold them in hatred.\n\nIf one is thus,\nTo lose them is to invite calamity,\nTo keep them is to invite ruin,\nTheir bodies unprotected,\nTheir misfortunes extending to descendants—\nAll through un-Dao ways.\n\n**On Establishing Virtue Properly**\nThose who establish well do not falter—\nThey stand firm through the Dao.\nThose who embrace well do not slip—\nThey hold fast through virtue.\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease—\nThe world knows no end.\n\nCultivated in the self, its virtue becomes true—\n**Nurturing life and breath.**\nCultivated in the family, it governs kindness and abundance—\nIts virtue overflows, benefiting kin.\nCultivated in the village, it orders roles and duties—\nIts virtue endures, conquering all.\nCultivated in the state, it establishes laws and norms—\nIts virtue flourishes, free from slander and treachery.\nCultivated in the world, it sets standards and models—\nIts virtue is universal, all under heaven in service.\n\nThus, by observing the self, one knows other selves,\nBy observing the family, one knows other families,\nBy observing the village, one knows other villages,\nBy observing the state, one knows other states,\nBy observing the world, one knows the world—\nNear and far revealed.\n\nHow do I know this to be true?\nBy seeking it within oneself.\n\n**The Principle of Return:**\nBetween Heaven and Earth, vast and boundless,\nDiverse winds and customs, myriad creatures great and small,\nEndless transformations, benefits and harms deceitfully entwined—\nThus, the able cannot control the unable,\nAnd the unable cannot act where the able cannot.\n\nI act for the world, yet the world also acts for me.\nWhen I and it meet, if I am few and it many,\nTo meet many with few—\nThe many grow secure, the few grow perilous.\n\nThus, if one establishes by strength, others will seize it;\nIf one establishes by cunning, others will counter it;\nIf one establishes by force, others will threaten it.\nOnly by doing nothing can one not be defeated.\n\nHow does this manifest?\nSilent, yet seeking echoes—\nEchoes do not answer me.\nTrusting shadow to follow shade—\nShadow does not follow me.\nYet fearing echoes, I strike the bell—\nEchoes answer louder than before.\nHating shadows, I stand in the sun—\nShadows cling to me more fiercely.\n\nFrom this, it is clear:\nNon-action cannot evade blessing,\nAction cannot escape misfortune.\n\nThus, the sage abandons strength,\nAbandons cunning,\nAbandons knowledge,\nAbandons virtue—\nEstablishes the Dao, embraces virtue,\nHarbors essence, nurtures spirit,\nHarmonizes the body, follows weakness,\nSteps upon the Earth, bears Heaven.\n**This is the unshaken foundation.**\n\nEmpty, still, and quiet,\nAs if absent yet present,\nInner and outer both silent,\nTransforming in the Mysterious,\nDoing nothing, yet nothing undone,\nReturning to simplicity, embracing truth,\nWithout laws or measures,\nYet aligned with transformation.\n\n**This is the unbroken embrace.**\n\nNurturing the small to sustain the great,\nTending the myriad people,\nOrdering square and round, precedence and sequence,\nEver abiding with the body,\nUpright in form, serene in spirit,\nTransmitting lineage to descendants.\nDescendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n\nVirtue accumulates, transforming and flowing,\nEndless, ebbing and swelling with Heaven.\nCultivated in the self, its virtue is true—\n**Life’s vitality thrives, the body light and strong,**\nBeauty enduring yet untamed.\n\nCultivated in the family,\nHusbands trustworthy, wives chaste,\nFathers merciful, children filial,\nBrothers obedient, younger siblings respectful,\nNine clans harmonious and affectionate,\nFarming and silk-reeling timely,\nStorehouses abundant,\nLivestock thriving,\nAffairs prosperous, wealth ever sufficient,\nNeighbors envy their fortune.\n\nCultivated in the family, its virtue overflows.\n\nCultivated in the village,\nClear distinctions in governance,\nActions aligned with harmony,\nNames and realities correct,\nBlack and white distinct,\nCurved and straight in their nature,\nRight and wrong self-evident,\nNo deceit arises,\nAuthority revered and displayed,\nOrders enforced without obstruction,\nAbove transforming, below responding,\nPublic and private as father and child,\nRespect and love sincere,\nSuperior and inferior in joy,\nPeople united, officials without grievance,\nDuties fulfilled, reputation honored,\nCalled *junzi*, virtue ever abundant,\nDeath not a peril.\n\nCultivated in the village, its virtue endures.\n\nCultivated in the state,\nThe ruler enlightened, ministers loyal,\nNo blocking of the worthy in court,\nNo jealousy of merit among scholars,\nNo obstruction of the upright by the crooked,\nNo slander harming the public,\nHarmony and compliance above and below,\nNo grievances, officials delighted in their duties,\nAll affairs in natural order,\nDistant peoples drawn in longing,\nThe world follows its wind,\nThe state rich, the people flourishing,\nBorders secure without conquest,\nAncestral temples honored,\nAltars and fields eternally at peace,\nYin and Yang eternally united,\nNo calamities arise,\nAll things bountiful and ripe,\nThe realm at great ease,\nNeighbors entrust their lives,\nPosterity thrives,\nVirtue and Dao abundant,\nEver as Heaven’s constant.\n\nCultivated in the state, its virtue is exalted.\n\nCultivated in the world,\nThe ruler yin, ministers yang,\nThe ruler still, ministers active,\nThe ruler round, ministers square,\nThe ruler follows, ministers respond,\nThe ruler silent, ministers speak.\nUpright and fair, harmonious and unified,\nEasy and effortless, quiet and soundless,\nVirtue spreads like whispers,\nSpirit transmits like currents,\nMovement without origin,\nTransformation like Heaven,\nActing without action,\nAchieving without doing,\nMerit aligned with the Dao,\nThe world returns to truth,\nNo affairs, no worries,\nGreat Peace spontaneously arises.\n\nCultivated in the world, its virtue is universal.\n\nThus, my self is the measure of other selves,\nMy family the balance of other families,\nMy village the compass of other villages,\nMy state the standard of other states—\nThis is the meaning of:\nObserving the self to know other selves,\nObserving the family to know other families,\nObserving the village to know other villages,\nObserving the state to know other states,\nObserving the world to know the world—\nNear and far revealed.\n\nThe ruler is the vital core of the land;\nThe land is the form of the ruler.\n\nThus, the land and the ruler share prosperity and suffering,\nShare corruption and rectitude.\nWhen the people thrive, the land flourishes;\nWhen the ruler is whole, the land is whole.\nFamilies and states preserve each other,\nRulers sustain one another.\nIf one attains self-mastery, the land naturally follows.\n\nTherefore, those who can know me know all;\nThose who can govern me govern all;\nWhat benefits me benefits all;\nWhat suits me suits all.\nWhat harms me yet benefits others—\nThe world knows none such.\n\nThis is the meaning of:\n*\"A single word sufficient for a lifetime’s practice—*\n*Is it not perhaps the virtue of *rú*?\"*\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nIt is by this.\nIt is by this.\n\n---\n**Volume Ten: *The Dao and Virtue Classic—Guidance on the True Path* (Attributed to Shùjùn Yán Zhūn, style name Jūn Píng, with annotations by *Gǔshénzǐ*)**\n\n**Falsehood and Emotional

body aligns with the Dao’s origin,\nLike a babe in its tender, weak, and void state.\n\nVenomous creatures do not sting,\nRaptors do not clutch,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nNor do they add harm—\nIts bones are frail, its sinews soft,\nYet its grasp is firm, its hold unyielding.\nIt knows not the union of male and female,\nYet the Dao’s effortless transformation is complete—\nIts essence is the most divine and luminous.\n\nAll day it wails, yet its throat never grows hoarse,\nIts voice remains in perfect harmony—\nThe harmony of the Dao is its way.\n\nTo know harmony is to know the eternal Dao,\nTo know the eternal Dao is to be enlightened and discerning—\nLife flourishes as a blessed, boundless day,\nThe heart directs the *qi* to become robust and unshakable—\nWhen things grow strong, they turn decrepit and rigid,\nThis is called *not* aligning with the Dao—\nA fate of calamity and ruin.\nTo stray from the Dao means an early end to one’s great destiny.\n\n**Explanation of the Way:**\nVirtue is void and boundless,\nDivine luminosity is tranquil and profound—\nPure, still, and subtly vast,\nThe Great Harmony flows like water.\nListen to it, and it is silent and empty,\nObserve it, and it is formless and easy.\nIts limits are without end, its bounds without measure—\nHeaven cannot enfold it,\nEarth cannot contain it,\nThe compass cannot make it round,\nThe square cannot make it square,\nMeasure cannot measure it,\nYet scales cannot weigh it—\nGold and jade cannot shield it,\nWater and fire cannot obstruct or destroy it,\nAll things fail to grasp it,\nMisfortune cannot befall it.\n\nHow much more so for those who float and soar,\nWho are pure and vast like the primordial chaos—\nTheir hearts have no dwelling,\nTheir forms no fixed abode.\nThrough natural refinement and reception,\nThey take form from the Ten Thousand Heavens,\nAll beings receive it—\nNourished and content,\nYet thought cannot grasp it,\nAction cannot seize it—\nThe farther one seeks, the thinner it becomes,\nThe more one clutches, the more it eludes.\nTo grasp it is to be caught by it,\nTo let go is to be released by it.\n\nOnly those without desire\nMake their bodies its dwelling,\nStore it within their hearts—\nThus it is called *containing virtue*.\n\nTo align with virtue is to receive virtue—\nThe depth of contained virtue is profound.\nVirtue in a person\nIs like a parent’s love for their child—\nFor all beings, it is like pearls and jade compared to clay and lead.\nParents give birth to me, and this cannot be changed,\nPearls and jade nourish me, and this cannot be discarded.\n\nThus, the virtuous person\nValues their body above all else,\nYet regards the world with lightness—\nLike a benevolent father and filial child,\nWho would not trade their love for wealth.\nThe one who cherishes their body\nAnd holds all else in slight regard\nIs like a wise merchant,\nWho would not exchange pearls and jade for clay and lead.\n\nTheir lack of desire is not from hating wealth or loving ease—\nThe world’s treasures cannot please their heart.\nTheir embrace of emptiness is not from loving stillness or hating disturbance—\nThe world’s affairs are not worth their effort.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they hold their own nature as weighty,\nAnd the world as light.\n\nThey understand the distinction between weight and light,\nThey grasp the shifts between profit and harm—\nThus all things cannot enslave them,\nNor can the world deceive them.\n\nTherefore, they do not seek stillness, yet stillness arises,\nThey do not seek harmony, yet harmony is born,\nThey do not rest their spirit, yet the spirit finds peace,\nThey do not cultivate harmony, yet the *qi* becomes balanced.\n\nThus, they do not listen, yet hear the soundless sound,\nThey do not look, yet see the formless form,\nThey do not think, yet discern right and wrong,\nThey do not ponder, yet reach the realm of unity.\n\nTheir spirit permeates Heaven and Earth,\nTheir virtue follows Yin and Yang—\nThey do not pray for blessings, yet Heaven and Earth protect them,\nThey do not shun misfortune, yet calamities and harm depart,\nThey do not execute, yet all under Heaven fears them,\nThey do not bestow, yet all under Heaven loves them.\n\nThey find joy in a full belly,\nDelight in bowing and rising,\nEat coarse grasses yet find it savory,\nDrink plain water yet find it sweet.\n\nBeneath towering trees,\nTheir spirit remains whole,\nWithin rocky caves,\nTheir heart ever rejoices—\nThe poor find joy in their work,\nThe lowly forget their humility,\nIn destitution, they meet death with serenity,\nIn hardship, they forget all danger.\nTheir deeds match the Earth’s,\nTheir virtue aligns with Heaven’s—\nThey return to simplicity, embrace naturalness,\nAnd are like infants once more.\n\nThe profound depth of contained virtue\nIs likened to the babe in its cradle.\n\nThus, to establish the body as the foundation of the state,\nAnd to take the babe as the model of governance,\nThen the world will honor the Dao and revere virtue,\nEach will cherish their own body,\nRenown and power will become stains,\nAll things mere dust—\nThe greedy will flee titles,\nThe cruel will turn to benevolence,\nGathering softness and weakness,\nOnly virtue will be cultivated.\n\nYet those who create blessings and sow chaos—\nHow could this ever arise?\n\nIt is from aligning with virtue by nature,\nNo cause for its generation.\n\nAlas, the Dao of Heaven and Earth—\nDeep and distant, subtle and refined—\nFew can recognize it,\nFewer still can follow it.\nWisdom and insight cannot grasp it,\nOnly the babe embodies it.\n\nThe babe’s nature mirrors virtue—\nThe babe knows yet does not speak,\nUnderstands yet does not reveal,\nHas power yet does not act,\nIs skilled yet remains hidden—\nAlive yet like death,\nFresh yet like decay—\nActing without action,\nMatching the Dao in every detail.\n\nLife that is not life,\nA body that is not a body,\nUse that is not use,\nHearing that is not hearing—\nWithout action or affairs,\nWithout intention or heart,\nNot seeking virtue or spirit,\nNot accumulating wisdom—\nNeither thinking nor pondering,\nNor obstructed by barriers—\nTheir spirit does not stir,\nTheir clarity knows no bounds,\nSoft yet void, still yet tranquil,\nTheir souls are at peace.\n\nJoy without seeking joy,\nEase without desiring ease—\nThey live without wasting their spirit,\nThey die without lingering regrets.\n\nThus they can be enveloped by the Dao and contain virtue,\nAlign with Heaven and Earth—\nThen bees and wasps, venomous creatures and snakes,\nWill have no will to inflict their stings.\nRaptors and fierce beasts\nWill have no intent to seize or attack.\n\nVenomous creatures do not sting,\nRaptors do not clutch—\nBecause there is no place for death.\nBones frail, sinews soft,\nYet their grasp is firm and unyielding.\nThey see not male and female,\nYet Yin and Yang transform them.\n\nTheir spirit is full and complete,\nAll beings unite with them—\nTheir cries do not grow hoarse,\nTheir harmony can be called perfect.\nTheir actions and deeds\nAlign with the eternal Dao.\n\nTo know harmony is to know the eternal.\nTo hold fast and guard it\nIs to be wise and enlightened—\nTo know the eternal is to be clear.\n\nBy nature, they flourish and grow—\nWhen they move, all blessings gather.\nTheir hearts act in profound mystery,\nTheir *qi* flows, robust and unyielding—\nThe heart directs the *qi*, and this is called *strength*—\nWithout striving, they overcome all.\n\nWithout desire, their movements lose nothing.\nNaturally open and free, all virtues sprout anew—\nHeaven and Earth shower their favor,\nWhile calamity and chaos fade away.\n\nYet why is this so?\nBecause they embrace virtue and harmony of spirit,\nAnd preserve the innocence of youth.\n\nWhen knowledge dawns, they abandon unity for duality,\nDiscard obscurity for clarity—\nTheir bodies adorned, their virtue erodes,\nThe more they know, the deeper their confusion grows.\n\nThus, they prize the world yet neglect their spirit,\nValue fame and power yet scorn their own bodies,\nOverthink and overplan, scattering their spirit’s essence,\nRejecting softness, abandoning weakness,\nForcing progress toward rigidity,\nFalling into greed, drowning in the pursuit of life,\nOpening themselves to peril while blocking all safety.\n\nWhen strength peaks, decay begins.\nThus, blessings as vast as Heaven and Earth—\nYou see them yet cannot grasp them;\nDisaster strikes like thunder—\nYou hear it yet cannot avoid it.\n\nThey give without receiving,\nDaily inviting ruin.\nThis is called *not aligning with the Dao*.\n\nAct and you reach exhaustion,\nStrive and you court destruction—\nCultivating the self, loving the nation,\nYet such devotion brings misfortune.\n\nOffer sacrifices, and Heaven and Earth turn against you;\nPray to spirits, and the gods abandon you.\nNo fault of fate—\nThe consequences of actions unfold as they must.\n\nThe wise do not speak of their virtue—\nThe wise do not speak lest they lose focus,\nThose who speak do not know—\nAnd lose their lives.\n\n---\n\nTo block the senses, dull the ears and eyes,\nTo close the mouth and door, speak not at all.\nTo blunt the sharpness of purpose and its direction,\nTo dissolve the anger of the heart and its thoughts,\nTo smooth the brightness of appearance without strangeness,\nTo blend with common garb, unmarked by eccentricity—\nThis is called *playing with the Dao*, aligning with the mundane.\n\nThey cannot be drawn close by love nor pushed away by neglect,\nThey cannot be gained by benefit nor lost by harm,\nThey cannot be honored by rank nor humbled by disgrace,\nYet they stand as the most noble and revered under Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Key Principle:**\nThe Dao has no fixed manifestation,\nVirtue no fixed direction,\nThe spirit no fixed form,\nHarmony no fixed appearance—\nYou gaze upon it yet cannot see,\nYou listen to it yet cannot hear,\nIt cannot be foreseen nor touched.\n\nThus, those who attain the Dao\nPerceive it alone, hear it alone,\nAct upon it alone, and abide by it alone.\n\nA father cannot pass it to his son,\nA subject cannot bestow it upon his lord,\nYet as a mother recognizes her child,\nOr a younger brother his elder—\nSo too, the child recognizes the mother.\n\nThis recognition is natural,\nYet its reason cannot be articulated.\n\nThe five flavors are in the mouth,\nThe five tones in the ear—\nYet what is sweet is not sweet,\nWhat is bitter is not bitter,\nWhat is *shang* is not *shang*,\nWhat is *yu* is not *yu*—\nYet the cook Yi and the musician Jiang could distinguish them.\n\nYet their means of distinction—\nThe mouth could not speak of it.\n\nThus, the saying: *\"Those who speak do not know, those who know do not speak.\"*\n\nHence, the form without form,\nCan be seen yet not seen;\nThe image without image,\nCan be imitated yet not declared;\nThe action without action,\nCan be followed yet not described;\nThe use without use,\nCan be practiced yet not transmitted.\n\nTherefore, those who attain the Dao\nSee it as a child recognizes its parent,\nTread it like the earth,\nWear it like the sky,\nEncase it as clothing,\nEmbody it like the self,\nAct with it in rise and fall,\nReact to external stimuli as if in water,\nBend with the flexing of fortune,\nYet remain steadfast in their own spirit.\n\nTheir spirit wanders with transformation,\nTheir resolve moves with virtue,\nTheir wisdom acts inwardly,\nYet outwardly they seem deaf and blind.\nTheir thoughts arise in mystery,\nTheir demeanor seems mad.\n\nThus, their mouth cannot speak,\nNor can their intent be made clear—\nLike dreaming of being a king,\nStanding on the brink of peril,\nJoy and sorrow reversed,\nThe heart alone knows—\nYet upon waking, they cannot convey it to another.\n\nThose who stray from the Dao are not so.\nThey see only the exterior, not the interior,\nFollow the current, yet grasp not the source,\nHold the end, yet exhaust not the root.\nThey affirm what is not affirmed,\nDeny what is not denied.\nThe superficiality of things,\nIs what they affirm as true.\n\nThe fundamental truth of the Dao,\nCannot be comprehended by such superficiality.\n\nThus, the Dao lies in externals,\nNot in the self—\nThe central ruler is undecided,\nHis defenses are not steadfast,\nThe heart harbors doubts, the will wavers,\nEmotions cling to things,\nWisdom is flashy,\nFalsity is mistaken for truth,\nHe oscillates between affirmation and negation,\nBetween existence and non-existence,\nHarmonious *qi* is easily disturbed—\nLike illness in a man,\nVitality leaks, spirit escapes,\nHe loves speech yet hates silence.\nWhen he speaks, his heart is troubled,\nHis resolve is distracted,\nHis wisdom is all outward,\nHis spirit departs.\n\nHis inner voice is spent,\nYet his outer words overflow,\nHis virtue and power scatter daily,\nHis self grows ever more distant.\nThe more he speaks, the less he understands his own perfection,\nThe more he acts, the less he knows his own virtue.\n\nThus, those who speak\nAre the essentials of opposing the Dao,\nThe means of straying from virtue,\nThe craftsmen of defying Heaven,\nThe instruments of overturning Earth.\n\nTherefore, those who attain the Dao\nDiminish their hearing, discard their brightness,\nDo not see, do not listen,\nAs if without sight or sound,\nClose their mouths, seal their tongues,\nAs if they know not speech.\n\nBlock their senses,\nClose their doors.\nBlunt their sharpness,\nRelease their attachments,\nTheir will guards nothing,\nTheir form seems void.\n\nDissolve their thoughts,\nScatter their worries,\nSeem to know nothing,\nYet hide as if alone in existence.\nBlunt their sharpness,\nDissolve their anger.\n\nExtinguish disaster at its root,\nReturn to the *Tai Su* (Great Primordial),\nTheir appearance is unchanged,\nTheir dress is unmarked,\nThey follow Heaven and Earth,\nBlend with the common in transformation,\nPlunge deep into the Great Dao,\nWander with virtue.\n\nWithout words to speak of speech,\nWithout action to speak of action,\nThey govern themselves with clarity and stillness,\nRespond to the times with harmony and balance,\nMerge with the world in undifferentiated chaos,\nAlign with the common in *playing with the Dao*.\n\nThey smooth their brightness,\nBlend with the dust.\nSeizing the root of all things,\nGrasping the foundation of all affairs,\nThey alone differ from the crowd—\nYet the world knows them not.\n\nThey drift through the thresholds of closeness and distance,\nSoar through the gates of gain and harm,\nFloat in the wilds of honor and disgrace,\nSteadfastly guard their own spirit,\nVanish into the realm of the formless,\nRoam in the land of abandon.\n\nPoverty and lowliness do not shame them,\nWealth and nobility do not flatter them—\nThey hide when they wish to hide,\nThey reveal when they wish to reveal.\nEven *yin* and *yang* cannot harm or benefit them,\nNor can rulers obscure their clarity.\n\nThis is called *playing with the Dao*.\nThus, they cannot be drawn close nor distanced.\n\nThey stand unmatched, alone,\nDistinct without peer—\nSounds and colors cannot please them,\nThe five flavors cannot sweeten them,\nTen thousand things cannot contend with them,\nWisdom and strength cannot dispute them.\n\nWithout taking nor giving,\nWithout gaining nor losing,\nThey close their doors, shut their gates,\nSever the ends, extinguish the threads,\nTheir spirit and clarity are self-made,\nThe Dao is their central ruler—\nTheir movement aligns with transformation,\nTheir stillness harmonizes with the natural.\nWhen they follow the natural order, they endure.\n\nAbandoned and unrestrained,\nThey have no fixed form,\nNo one can precede or follow them—\nThus, those who love them cannot approach,\nThose who hate them cannot distance,\nRewards cannot be added,\nTaxes cannot be taken,\nRank and honor cannot be elevated,\nPoverty and lowliness cannot be imposed.\n\nThey have no need of all things,\nThus all things cannot enslave them.\nThey take no possession of the world,\nThus the world cannot possess them.\n\nThis is how they become noble under Heaven.\n\n**The Methods:**\nTo govern the nation with uprightness and loyalty,\nTo employ the Dao in warfare with cunning and strategy,\nTo take the world without action, relying on natural order.\n\nHow do I know this is so?\nI know it from my own self.\n\nThe world abounds with prohibitions, taboos, shame, and contempt for what is ugly and coarse,\nYet the people grow ever poorer, their wealth ever fewer.\n\nWhen the people are skilled in sharp tools and clever stratagems,\nThe state becomes increasingly chaotic and deceitful.\n\nMen rely on artifice and elaborate deception,\nAnd strange things proliferate without end.\n\nWhen laws and decrees are made ever more explicit and traps set ever tighter,\nThieves and bandits multiply, their violence and rebellion increasing.\n\nThe Sage’s words declare the **true method of governance**:\nIf I do not rule with **non-action** (*wuwei*), the people will not transform themselves,\nYet they will gather in harmony and unity.\nIf I do not govern with **non-interference** (*wushi*), the people will not enrich themselves,\nYet they will have no cravings.\nIf I favor **stillness** and rule with emptiness and tranquility,\nThe people will naturally align with proper principle and order.\nIf I suppress desire and govern by contentment,\nThe people will return to simplicity and abandon ornamentation.\n\nWhen governance is **obscured** and **obscured** (*mènmèn*), lacking virtue and power (*fude*),\nThe people are **docile** and **docile** (*pièpiè*), loyal and steadfast.\nWhen governance is **scrutinizing** and **scrutinizing** (*cháchá*), virtue and power clear,\nThe people are **cunning** and **cunning** (*quēquē*), knowing how to scheme and grow.\n\nCalamity arises from fortune’s reliance—fortune leans upon calamity to complete it,\nFortune hides within calamity’s guise—calamity lurks to fulfill it.\nWho knows where their extremes begin, with no discernible threads?\n\nIf there is no **uprightness** (*zhèng*), no **loyalty** (*xìn*) will endure.\n**Uprightness** (*zhèng*) inverted becomes **cunning** (*qí*), **cleverness** (*zhì*), and **deceit** (*zhà*) in action.\n**Goodness** (*shàn*) inverted becomes **evil** (*yāo*), and **evil omens** (*yāo xiáng*) follow.\n\nMen have long strayed from what is proper and constant—\nThe source of their prolonged confusion.\n\n**Key Principle**:\nThe **emotion of virtue** (*dàoqíng*) is constant—**uprightness** (*zhèng*) and **loyalty** (*xìn*) are the norm.\nChange and movement, stillness and action—\nOne arises, the other vanishes.\n\nThe **covering** (*fù*) of Heaven and Earth,\nThe **threads** (*jī*) and **patterns** (*gāng*) of yin and yang,\nThe **records** (*jì*) and **guidelines** (*lǐ*) of sun and moon,\nNurturing all living beings—\nThose who oppose it perish, those who follow it thrive.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,\nIs one yin and one yang,\n**Yang-qi** (*yángqì*) governs **virtue/power** (*dé*),\n**Yin-qi** (*yīnqì*) governs **punishment** (*xíng*),\nPunishment and virtue are contrary,\nYet harmony lies at the center.\n\nSpring brings forth, summer grows,\nAutumn harvests, winter conceals—\nEnding to begin anew,\nDecaying yet rising again,\nYang reaches its end and turns to yin,\nYin reaches its end and turns to yang,\nYin and yang in opposition,\nExtending to infinity.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of kings and the conduct of men,\nIs one soft and one hard,\nOne civil and one martial,\nWith **central uprightness** (*zhōngzhèng*) as the guiding thread—\nHardness and softness in contrast,\nWar and virtue intertwined,\nWar turns to virtue,\nVirtue turns to war,\nWar and virtue safeguarding each other,\nLaw at the center,\n**Numbers** (*shù*) and **principles** (*fǎ*) in harmony,\nThus all can flow freely.\n\nTherefore, the **enlightened kings** and **sage rulers**,\nReduce their desires to empty their minds,\nEmpty their minds to calm their spirits,\nCalm their spirits to grasp the **Dao/Way**,\nGain the **Dao/Way** to rectify their hearts,\nRectify their hearts to cultivate their bodies,\nCultivate their bodies to order their households,\nOrder their households to establish laws,\nEstablish laws to clarify names,\nClarify names to govern the state.\n\nThis is how they govern the state with **uprightness**.\n\nWhen the state is **upright** (*zhèngguó*), its **records** (*jì*) are firm,\nIts principles clear and discerned,\nFrom the **roots** (*yuán*) to the **origins** (*běn*),\nDrawing connections left and right,\nAligning ranks front and back,\nThings return to their proper places—\nClarifying names to **cover** reality,\nVerifying reality to **supervise** names.\n\nOne name, one reality,\nBalanced and thorough,\nSquare and round, straight and curved,\nNone can stray—\nRewards and punishments applied,\nNeither **excessive** (*yáng*) nor **stunted** (*suō*).\nNames and reality,\nLike moon and sun,\nOne name **upright** brings prosperity to the state,\nOne name **deceitful** brings enslavement to the state.\n\nThe **secrets** (*mì*) of nurturing the state,\nLie in having no fixed course—\nBending and extending, giving and taking,\nAll in accordance with the times.\nFollowing disorder, relying on law,\nEncountering rebellion, using war,\nGuarding peace with the **Dao/Way**,\nEmbodying **virtue/power** as the norm,\nGreat and small states meet—\nWith **uprightness** as their mutual expectation.\n\nIf they stray from **uprightness**, transform them,\nIf they do not comply, restrain them,\nIf they do not cease, regulate them,\nIf they do not submit, strike them.\n\n**Understanding** the great state’s **coordination** (*xié*) with the small,\nThey dare not lightly use war,\nThus they first employ **transformation** and **restraint**,\nOnly when compliance fails do they resort to regulation and punishment.\n\nIf a small state is **pressed** between great states,\nFacing a ruler without the **Dao/Way**,\nAnd **uprightness** cannot prevail,\nThen leave it—\nIf leaving is impossible, cede land to it—\nIf ceding land is impossible, lead the people to flee—\nIf fleeing is impossible, take up the staff and depart—\nIf departing is impossible, calamity will reach all the people,\nAnd disaster will fall upon me—\nThus, I must **devise plans** and **scheme**,\nFor this is where **contention** arises,\nAnd war is born.\n\nI wish to **select generals** and **train soldiers**,\nSharpen arms and fortify defenses,\nStockpile grain and raise ramparts,\nCamp and defend myself—\nYet the people suffer exhaustion,\nThe state becomes hollowed out—\nThis is how **war** is **initiated**,\nAnd **uprightness** is **invoked**.\n\nIf I enter with **uprightness**,\nYet I am few while they are many,\nI am weak while they are strong—\nLike an egg thrown upon a stone,\nI will be the enemy’s victim,\nSuffering calamity—\nThe armies must surely fail,\nSoldiers die in wounds,\nThe **Heavenly intent** (*tiānxīn*) will not be fulfilled,\nThe ancestral temples will perish—\nBelow, I lament the people’s fate,\nAbove, I fear the **heart of Heaven and Earth** (*tiāndìxīn*)—\nThis is how **strategy** (*quán*) is **activated**,\nAnd **deceit** (*qí*) is **deployed**.\n\nThus, I **establish** the **plan of opposition** (*fǎnwéng*) and **attraction** (*fùlái*),\nOpen the **hearts of the people**,\nStimulate the **schemes of the feudal lords**,\nReveal my **virtue/power’s** (*dàodé*) **blessings**,\nIllustrate the **assistance of Heaven and Earth**—\nTo **unify** the hearts of the four seas,\nTo **harmonize** the intentions of all states.\n\nThe people respond to me like echoes,\nNeighboring states follow me like shadows,\nBirds and beasts take flight with me—\nThis is how **plans** are **utilized**,\nAnd **deceit** is **executed**.\n\n**Deceit** is **strategy**—\nWhen a small state is **pressed** between great states,\nAnd matters of fleeing or retreat arise,\nWar cannot be avoided—\nThus **strategy** and **deceit** are **employed**.\n\n**Understanding** that war is an **omen of misfortune**,\nUsed only when there is no alternative—\nI **activate** schemes and **plans**,\nTo **align** with the people’s expectations—\nHeaven and Earth, birds and beasts,\nAssist me as my **fortified city** (*chéng*—*cf.* 以浑四海之心，同万国之意，天地鸟兽助我为城),\nThus it is said: *\"Employing **deceit** in war.\"*\n\nAbove, **aligning** with the **intention of virtue**,\nBelow, **harmonizing** with the **heart of Heaven and Earth**,\nIn **danger**, ensuring **safety**,\nIn **harm**, safeguarding **benefit**—\nTreating the people as one’s own body,\nEmbodying the **formless form** (*wúxíng zhī xíng*),\nDwelling in the **Great Yin** (*Tài Yīn*),\n**Issuing** the **action of non-action** (*wúwéi zhī wéi*),\n**Displaying** the **soundless sound** (*wúshēng zhī shēng*),\nDistinguishing the **crimes of extinguishing transformation** (*mièhuà zhī zuì*),\nRevealing the **labors of defying Heaven** (*nìtiān zhī gōng*),\nManifesting what **Heaven** bestows,\nShowing what **Earth** produces.\n\nThere are names without reality,\nThere are realities without names,\nNames and reality **contradict**—\nSometimes **upright**, sometimes **tilted**,\nSometimes **flexible**, sometimes **rigid**,\nSometimes **contrary**—\nYet all **converge** in the **mysterious** (*míng*).\n\n**Understanding** the **virtue/power’s** (*dàodé*) **effects**,\nRevealing the **transgressions of rebellion** (*bó nì*),\nSometimes **contradicting** names and reality\nTo **flexibly align** with the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThe calamities of Heaven arise spontaneously,\nThe portents and misfortunes emerge naturally—\nSevering father and son,\nCutting off brothers,\nSlaying their valiant generals,\nBeheading their loyal ministers,\nSo that all under Heaven harbor resentment,\nNone sharing a single heart.\nStanding alone and unyielding,\nReceiving Heaven’s decree of war,\nVictory brings great joy,\nAnd the Four Seas find peace—\nThis is the **highest** use of the **unconventional** (*qí*).\n\nFirst employing the **Dao/Way**,\nOnly when it is not followed do the calamities arise—\nThus it is the **highest**.\n\nSoothing the anger of the world,\nGathering those skilled in the **unconventional**,\nEars attuned to distant whispers,\nEyes scanning the horizon,\nScholars roaming freely,\nForming alliances and bonds of kinship,\nLife and death transform strangely,\nFollowing the **Dao/Way** to respond to deceit.\n\nAdorning authority and nurturing influence,\nTo deceive the people with substance;\nSpreading rumors and fabricating schemes,\nTo confuse the enemy;\nUsing humble words to subdue the lowly,\nTo close the mind of their lord;\nOffering light tasks with heavy rewards,\nTo open the hearts of their ministers.\n\nWhen rifts form between lord and subject,\nManipulating their spirits,\nActions concealed in darkness,\nPower shifting in subtlety,\nSuspending their fate,\nExploiting their vulnerabilities,\nDriving the enemy to madness and confusion,\nSo they cannot act—\nAdvancing or retreating with the times,\nNo fixed rituals,\nNot striking yet the enemy surrenders,\nNot fighting yet the enemy falters,\nOverthrowing their lord without harming their ministers,\nSlaying their generals without touching their troops,\nVictory brings the people’s joy,\nThe feudal lords fear them—\nThis is the **second** use of the **unconventional**.\n\nFirst devising strategies,\nLater securing their fate—\nThus it is the **second**.\n\nControlling the terrain,\nMastering their lords and ministers,\nOffering low status with heavy rewards,\nTo pacify their outward appearance,\nSpreading covert schemes,\nTo sow discord among their kin,\nDeceit comes from them,\nThe **Dao/Way** arises from this—\nGranting cities to seal generals,\nJoining states to reward deceit.\n\nDeceit arrives like a specter,\nPlots unfold like divine foresight,\nStrategies unmeasured,\nUnconventional shifts endless,\nDividing their strength,\nSowing doubt in their hearts,\nAs if rising from the earth,\nAs if born of Heaven,\nSevering their inner circle,\nScattering their alliances,\nRaising influence and generating change,\nTo determine their fate,\nBlocking their schemes,\nSo they cannot trust.\n\nBreaking their strong supporters,\nTo isolate their resolve,\nExploiting their form to ensure victory,\nLike an endless ring,\nStriking at the opportune moment,\nHarmony as its constant,\nAttacking their vulnerabilities,\nIn stillness, cutting their supplies.\n\nStripping them of resources,\nStarving and parching them,\nBurdening them with weight,\nDrowning them in fire,\nExhausting them with labor,\nFreezing and scorching them,\nLuring them with profit,\nMaddening them with confusion,\nDriving them to desperation,\nPressing them to the brink.\n\nStriking from high to low,\nUsing many to overcome few,\nStrengthening ranks and divisions,\nOfficers and troops aligned,\nThe high protecting the low,\nThe low aiding the high,\nThe three armies united,\nBound as father and son.\n\n**Unconventional** formations merge and split,\nHidden and concealed in layers.\nCamps before, supplies behind,\nOverwhelming the left, routing the right,\nDazzling with banners and drums,\nConfounding with music and war cries,\nAdvancing like surging waves,\nRetreating like wind and rain,\nStriking like a collapse,\nClashing like a tiger—\nDefenses unbreakable,\nOffensives unyielding,\nVictory brings awe,\nAll under Heaven trembles—\nThis is the **lowest** use of the **unconventional**.\n\nEmploying force first,\nOnly then determining their fate—\nThus it is the **lowest**.\n\nWhen chaos and disorder cease,\nAll things flourish in peace,\nHeaven’s will is fulfilled,\nThe world rejoices—\nConcealing the **unconventional**, diminishing cleverness,\nPrioritizing loyalty and sincerity,\nCultivating stillness and simplicity,\nWithdrawing from affairs, halting speech.\n\nThough skilled in unconventional victory,\nUnclear in **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,\nFearful that affairs will shift and change,\nCorrupting purity, scattering simplicity—\nThus halting speech.\n\nWhy is this so?\n**Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** transform endlessly,\nAll things have high and low,\nDirections diverge,\nPaths intertwine—\nSome turn west, some east,\nEach follows its nature,\nTo sustain its life.\n\nThe virtuous thrive through goodness,\nThe wicked spread through evil,\nThe sincere shine through truth,\nThe deceitful mask with falsity—\nEach displays their wisdom,\nTo avoid calamity and ruin.\n\nSeeking without fulfillment,\nThe wise feign cunning;\nLaboring without rest,\nThe loyal turn deceitful;\nOppressed and tormented,\nThe faithful spread lies;\nDriven to ruin without end,\nThe worthy do not transform.\n\nThus when the ruler favors knowledge, the people deceive;\nWhen the ruler favors profit, the people suffer;\nWhen the ruler favors rewards, the people grow weary;\nWhen the ruler favors punishment, the people resent.\n\nWhy?\nAffairs originate with the ruler,\nActions rest with the ministers;\nRewards come from the ruler,\nWealth comes from the people;\nLaws come from the ruler,\nObedience rests with the ministers.\nWhen the ruler desires,\nAll under Heaven follows the wind.\n\nAll affairs stem from the ruler,\nThe ruler is the source of transformation.\nIf the ruler does not conceal their schemes,\nThey revert to the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThough clever and wise in strategy,\nIt is not as effective as acting without thought.\nThus governing with public-mindedness\nIs not as harmonious as the great unity of non-action;\nSeeking to curb excess through prohibition\nIs not as effective as loyalty born of no desire;\nGuiding through measured anger\nIs not as fruitful as the merit of non-action;\nBalancing thought with **virtue/power**\nIs not as vast as the boundless flow of inaction;\nMastering the arts of divination and omens\nIs not as beneficial as nurturing a world without ailment;\nWielding the strategies of the Yellow Emperor and Duke Zhou,\nOr grasping the essentials of Sunzi and Wu Qi,\nIs not as profound as letting all under Heaven\nRefrain from exerting cleverness or strength.\n\nThus what **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** produce,\nLove cannot profit from;\nWhat Heaven and Earth complete,\nAction cannot achieve.\n\nSmall acts of love and gain\nUltimately defy the great **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\nOnly those without love can bring profit,\nOnly those without action can fulfill.\nThus the enlightened kings and sage rulers\nHave no desires, no seeking,\nNo creation, no contrivance,\nNo burdens, no formalities—\nReturning to origins, embracing simplicity,\nAll under Heaven finds peace.\n\nTaking the realm through inaction—\nHow is this made clear?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"To bring fortune and benefit,\nTo achieve success and complete affairs,\nTo prepare all things and fulfill their use,\nTo enrich people greatly—\nThen all under Heaven indulges in extravagance,\nWealth and goods are insufficient,\nThe people grow ever more depraved.\nFortune fills the mountains and marshes,\nGold and jade pile up,\nYet the state grows ever less secure,\nThe people gain less benefit.\nAdorning cleverness while appearing foolish,\nUsing deceit to manipulate,\nGuarding against licentiousness and lust,\nThe paths of deceit and falsity grow dense,\nDistinguishing same from different,\nThe shifts of right and wrong multiply—\nThen the state grows dim,\nAnd governance decays.\"*\n\nThe world fears taboos,\nYet the people grow ever poorer.\nThe more sharp tools they possess,\nThe more the state descends into chaos.\n\nCrafting schemes and perfecting arts,\nCarving and embellishing with ornament,\nStrange transformations and monstrous novelty—\nTo exalt those of virtue,\nTo distinguish high and low.\n\nArtifice multiplies,\nTalents flourish ever more bizarre,\nRewards are swift and deep,\nPunishments harsh and laws severe,\nPiercing flesh and severing limbs,\nDistant kin grow estranged, near kin grow discordant,\nGuilt leads to utter annihilation,\nReward leads to knighthood and lordship,\nEarth and Heaven tremble—\nYet thieves and bandits multiply.\n\nThe people grow skilled in strange cleverness,\nStrange things multiply,\nLaws and decrees grow ever more elaborate—\nThieves and bandits grow ever more numerous.\n\nThus the Sage’s words declare:\n*\"I act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves.\nWhy so?*\nThe ruler is the heart of all under Heaven.\nQi responds to sensation, the body follows its impulse,\nThe heart moves, the body obeys,\nSounds echo in resonance, forms shadow in pursuit—\nNot enough to illustrate the point.\n\nTherefore, if the ruler truly practices non-action,\nThen the hearts of all under Heaven have no direction,\nEnveloped by the Dao, containing virtue,\nWithout thought nor desire,\nWithout orders nor laws,\nThe people transform themselves of their own accord.\nI act with non-action, yet the people transform themselves.\n\nIf the ruler truly practices the affairs of non-affairs,\nThen all under Heaven lacks effect nor form,\nLacks knowledge nor perception,\nNo rewards nor gifts given,\nThe people grow rich of their own accord.\nI act with non-affairs, yet the people grow rich.\n\nIf the ruler truly practices the stillness of non-stillness,\nAnd the joy of non-clearance,\nThen all under Heaven does not study nor inquire,\nHears nothing nor sees nothing,\nHas no punishments nor laws,\nThe people align themselves naturally.\nI love stillness, yet the people align themselves.\n\nIf the ruler truly practices the desires of non-desire,\nThen the hearts of all under Heaven grow empty and their wills level,\nGreat bodies and small things,\nAction yet returning to cessation,\nStillness yet returning to sufficiency—\nWithout constraint nor regulation,\nThe people return to simplicity.\nI act with non-desire, yet the people return to simplicity.*\n\nThus, when the ruler’s governance is correct,\nThere is no filial piety nor benevolence,\nNo giving nor bestowing,\nYet the people are drawn and swayed,\nMute and docile,\nTheir likes and dislikes indistinguishable,\nTheir right and wrong undiscerned—\nThus they obtain what they desire,\nAnd their lives are preserved whole.\nHis governance is stifling,\nAnd his people are docile.\n\nWhen the ruler’s governance is probing,\nBestowing virtue and spreading benefit,\nMaking distinctions clear and keen,\nThe people are bright and discerning,\nAll know of calamity and fortune.\nFilial piety and brotherly respect,\nBenevolence and righteousness,\nAll affairs are differentiated—\nYet the wise are obscured and the foolish prevail.\nHis governance is probing,\nAnd his people are obscured.\n\nThus, he loses what he relies upon,\nAnd his life is cut short by Heaven.\nFortune arises from calamity,\nCalamity arises from fortune—\nFortune and calamity,\nShare the same source yet different realms,\nBoth perish together, both endure together,\nDifferent in nature yet the same in appearance,\nFollowing each other in and out,\nSame in origin yet different in end.\nWithout the Sage,\nNone can grasp them alone.\nFortune and calamity,\nDepend upon each other,\nLie in wait for one another.\n\nThus, to abandon fortune is to abandon calamity,\nTo abandon calamity is to abandon fortune—\nFortune without fortune,\nThe most subtle and profound,\nYet all under Heaven loves to know,\nNone can exhaust its depths.\nWho knows its ultimate extent?\n\nOnly the non-acting can follow its natural course,\nStanding correct between calamity and fortune,\nOvercoming all without effort.\nThis is the true correctness.\nTo lose correctness is to give rise to strangeness,\nStrangeness arises and the people are bewildered,\nGood men become malevolent,\nRight and wrong invert.\n\nCorrectness becomes strangeness,\nGoodness becomes malevolence.\nAll under Heaven is deeply confused and cannot return.\n\nThe Dao is very easy to follow,\nYet people’s confusion endures long—\nThus it cannot be recovered.\n\nRectangular yet not cutting,\nSharp yet not harming,\nStraight yet not overbearing,\nBright yet not dazzling.\n\nTo govern people and harmonize Heaven for living—\nNothing surpasses frugality and non-action.\n\nOnly frugality,\nThus early service without prohibitions.\nAccumulating virtue in subtle profundity,\nThen there is nothing it cannot overcome,\nNothing it cannot conquer.\nNone know its ultimate transformation—\nTangtang, it can make a state,\nIt can make a sovereign king.\nThe mother of states is frugality,\nIt can endure long and move with difficulty.\n\nDeep roots and firm stems,\nSpirit concealed,\nLong life and enduring vision,\nThe body preserved whole.\n\nPointing back:\nThe Dao has nothing it does not possess,\nYet does not give or withhold—\nThus all things exist.\nIt lacks no power,\nYet does not act or kill—\nThus all things flourish.\nHow can this be made clear?\n\nThe Dao is formless yet all things have form,\nIt lacks state nor appearance yet all things are square or round,\nSilent yet all things have sound.\nFrom this perspective,\nThe Dao does not give nor withhold,\nYet all things exist;\nIt does not act nor slaughter,\nYet all things flourish.\nFlourishing arises from non-flourishing,\nExistence arises from non-existence—\nThis is clear.\nThe Dao can preserve in non-preservation,\nFlourish in non-flourishing.\n\nSome say:\n*\"The Dao is formless and soundless,\nYet does not give nor withhold—\nHow can it flourish in non-flourishing,\nPreserve in non-preservation?\"*\n\nThe Sage discerns each thing in its natural state,\nEach thing preserves its own Dao—\nThis is called recognizing form and sound,\nYet not recognizing their influence.\n\nThe sun, though not making form to cast shadow,\nYet shadow must follow sunlight,\nThe void, though not making sound to produce echo,\nYet echo must follow hollow valleys.\nIf the sun and void had hearts to create shadows and echoes,\nThen there would be times when they fail—\nHow could they ever be seen nor heard,\nNor ensure that flourishing and preservation must exist?\n\nThe Dao can flourish and preserve in things,\nYet the Dao has never had a heart.\nThus, when the king raises troops and uses sharp tools,\nThe people grow desirous—\nDesire grows, and with desire comes cutting.\nCutting as the standard,\nThen the licentious advance while the upright retreat,\nLoyal ministers suffer its poison,\nAnd all the people bear its harm.\n\nThe desirous use desire as the standard,\nYet desire is licentious—\nThus the upright are cut down,\nAnd all the people suffer harm.\n\nTo value wealth,\nThen the people seek—\nSeeking grows, and with seeking comes piercing.\nPiercing as the standard,\nThen the greedy prevail while the frugal suffer,\nLoyal ministers bear the blame,\nAnd all the people suffer defeat.\n\nThe seekers use seeking as the standard,\nYet seeking is greedy—\nThus the frugal are pierced,\nAnd piercing brings injury.\n\nWhen strife is opened, the people bend crookedly—\nBending crookedly, yet the standard is uprightness,\nUprightness then becomes unrestrained.\nIf unrestraint is taken as uprightness,\nThen the perverse soar while the upright lie low,\nLoyal ministers bear its calamity,\nAnd all the people suffer its ruin.\n\nWhen the ruler prizes fame, the people feign—\nFeigning, yet the standard is brightness,\nBrightness then becomes dazzling.\nIf dazzling is taken as brightness,\nThen great virtue is concealed while petty favors are displayed,\nLoyal ministers face death,\nAnd all the people suffer misfortune.\nThe feigners use feigning as brightness,\nYet brightness is then darkness—\nThus, those who claim brightness are struck by misfortune.\n\nThe ruler who rules alone,\nWhile ministers serve with divided loyalty,\nNurtures the ruler’s will,\nFlatteringly indulges the ruler’s heart,\nBlocks the ruler’s ears,\nAnd veils the ruler’s wisdom—\nThis is how the state becomes perilous\nAnd the ancestral temples fall into ruin.\n\nThus, the enlightened kings and sage rulers\nHold alone what they do not share,\nKnow alone what they do not teach,\nPossess alone what they do not employ,\nMeasure themselves by uprightness yet do not impose it,\nAre frugal in all things yet do not hoard,\nCling to natural rectitude yet do not rely on it,\nLet their virtue shine universally yet do not haggle over it.\n\nWhy so?\nRemove desire yet uphold uprightness,\nSo that the people act justly by themselves;\nPierce not where piercing is not due,\nSo that the people have no quarrels.\nMatters are naturally resolved,\nAll things flow freely—\nNone call it fortune, none call it misfortune,\nThe world drifts in harmony, without fixed norm.\nTreasure the Dao in one’s heart,\nBe open and magnanimous,\nLet things find their own place,\nNo one knows their limits.\n\nThough not piercing, all things attain their proper form—\nThis is the piercing that transcends mere cutting,\nNot the work of any blade.\nNot that there is no cutting—\nPruning the proud, restraining the violent,\nYet leaving no scars or wounds.\nAdapting to the times, conforming to nature,\nRuler and people are as one—\nThough cutting, it is not injury.\n\nRemove wealth yet uphold frugality,\nSo that the world naturally balances;\nPierce not where piercing is not due,\nSo that people have no disputes.\nThe greedy and grasping cease,\nPurity and honesty arise—\nNone call it turbid, none call it clear,\nReputation is not falsely conferred,\nTruth is not misrepresented.\nNot that there is no piercing—\nPracticing virtue, beauty, and humility,\nExposing flaws and manifesting vice,\nYet debate is without deception.\nRemove wealth, embrace sincerity,\nHumility and yielding follow reason—\nGood and evil self-separate,\nThus nothing is concealed.\n\nRemove strife yet uphold rectitude,\nSo that the people restrain themselves;\nUnrestrain not where restraint is not due,\nSo that the people submit themselves.\nRight the perverse, correct the chaotic,\nTransform licentiousness, rectify customs—\nNone call it blessing,\nYet the world thrives in wildness,\nAll things find their natural place.\nNot that there is no unrestraint—\nPromote the upright, exalt the just,\nExpose errors, highlight crimes,\nDiminish the perverse, curb the crooked,\nReveal people’s faults—\nThe world is thoroughly rectified,\nYet action brings no sound.\nFollow reason to mediate disputes,\nAlign with the Dao to suit the occasion—\nThough just, there is no excess,\nThough not unrestrained, it is not so.\n\nRemove vanity yet uphold brightness,\nSo that the people act appropriately;\nDazzle not where dazzling is not due,\nSo that the people are naturally enlightened.\nNone call it illumination, none call it obscurity,\nThe world is vast and harmonious,\nAll things flourish and grow—\nVirtue compares with Heaven,\nTransformation aligns with the Dao.\nNot that there is no dazzling—\nVirtue shines universally,\nIlluminates all things,\nYet its transformation is formless.\n\nThe Dao is its own brightness,\nPermeating all without measure—\nEach thing finds its own place,\nNo one knows its name.\nAbove and below mirror each other,\nInner and outer correspond,\nEntry and exit leave no trace,\nMovement and stillness know no bounds—\nLike shadow to form, echo to sound.\n\nThus, the Way to govern a state,\nThe foundation of nurturing the people,\nIs rooted in frugality.\nNo method surpasses frugality in governing people and harmonizing with Heaven.\nFrugality means moderation and restraint.\n\nTherefore, the enlightened kings and sage rulers\nDiminish their outward displays,\nLower their official palaces,\nAbandon the five flavors,\nExtinguish music and color,\nUse wisdom to dwell in simplicity,\nSpeak with clarity yet hold silence.\nEstablish a form without ostentation,\nSet a pattern without imitation—\nFearful that others know them,\nThey conceal themselves in the unfathomable.\n\nThus, before they act, the world responds;\nBefore they command, the people gather;\nBefore they wage war, victory is assured;\nBefore they attack, the world submits.\nHence, they do not labor yet the people prosper,\nThey do not divide yet their duties are fulfilled,\nThey do not punish yet all fear them,\nThey do not scheme yet they receive Heaven’s blessings—\nDisaster and chaos do not arise,\nAll auspicious signs converge,\nWithout action yet nothing fails to succeed,\nWithout strife yet nothing fails to conquer.\nThis is called \"accumulating virtue\"—\nThus, nothing fails to conquer.\n\nAll things return to their mysterious unity,\nThe world is in perfect accord—\nFloating and sinking, ebbing and flowing,\nAlign with the Dao’s natural course.\nLike end and beginning,\nLike chaos and order,\nLike emptiness and fullness,\nLike absence and presence,\nLike sparseness and density,\nLike slowness and speed—\nNo form, no shadow,\nNo root, no trace—\nVague and indistinct,\nDark and silent,\nMysterious and boundless,\nLike the vastness of Heaven and Earth,\nBeyond measure or limit.\n\nNo one knows its limits.\nSelf-cultivation leaves abundance,\nThus one can establish a state;\nGoverning people and ordering things,\nOne’s descendants will never perish.\nThis is the way to establish a state.\n\nWhy so?\n\nWith its frugality thus established,\nThe Dao of sound is neither given nor bestowed—\nSparing and subtle, its virtue refined,\nFull yet appearing as if nonexistent.\nWhen sincerity flows through its intent,\nThen endurance becomes its nature.\n\nForm small, spirit vast—\nA thousandfold its might,\nOne bearing ten thousand—\nThus it moves with effortless grace.\n\nOne principle governs all things,\nIn harmony with Heaven’s Dao.\nRoots deep, foundations firm,\nDwelling with the divine—\nThe True Person embodies it,\nThe Sage preserves it.\n\nThis is the \"mother of states,\"\nDeep-rooted, enduring, long-lived, and ever-visionary.\n\n---\n\n**On Governing Great States**\n\nTo govern a great state is to speak of its ruler—\nLike poaching a small fish, gentle and unhurried.\n\nWith Dao as the cauldron, the world simmers beneath,\nTrue authority reigns above—\nIts spirits neither frighten nor harm.\n\nWhat is not its spirit does not frighten,\nIts spirit, when present, aids nature’s flow.\nWhat is not its spirit does not harm life,\nIts spirit, when balanced, nurtures all things pure.\n\nTwo forces unharming, Dao preserved,\nVirtue returns—\nA thousandfold the people’s blessing.\n\n**Illustrating the Principle:**\nWhen the sun declines, shadows rise;\nDryness peaks, winds stir;\nValleys tremble, seas surge high—\nHigh and low stand in contrast,\nDiffering by hundreds of fathoms—\nBecause of their vast form.\n\nCliffs a thousand *ren* high,\nPrecipitous a hundred *zhang* deep—\nBeasts ascend, yet crumble to ruin,\nWhile gnats and ants glide unscathed,\nAnd rhinos, elephants, tigers, and leopards—\nBecause of their weight—\nPerish in the fall.\n\nGales howl, roofs lift, trees snap,\nRocks fly, iron scatters,\nMountains crumble—\nYet human blood flows undisturbed—\nBecause of their sudden might.\n\nA breeze through cracks and holes\nStirs not a hair—\nYet when it enters the body,\nIt breeds a hundred ailments, bringing death—\nBecause of its subtlety.\n\nGreat states are like the ocean, like rhinos—\nYet their virtue is like the wind through cracks,\nLike the breeze through holes.\n\nThus their blessings cannot be recklessly bestowed,\nTheir gains cannot be violently seized,\nTheir goodness cannot be grandly displayed,\nTheir evils cannot be recklessly abandoned.\n\nTo recklessly bestow is to recklessly lose,\nTo violently seize is to violently collapse,\nTo grandly display is to grandly depart,\nTo recklessly abandon is to recklessly invite.\n\nTo hold high office, wielding the world’s levers,\nPower and authority already vast—\nTo agitate further would multiply losses.\nThus, governing a great state is like poaching a small fish.\n\nIssuing decrees like the wind through cracks,\nStill fearing overreach—\nA thread’s tension, a hair’s breadth.\n\nHow much more so when indulging desires,\nLightly ruling the seas,\nActing with grand schemes,\nExhausting the people—\nThen it is like the tiger’s torn flesh,\nThe wind’s shattered roofs—\nIs it not fitting?\n\nHow may this be made clear?\n\nZhuangzi said:\nTo eat when starving yet gluttonously,\nTo drink when thirsty yet excessively,\nTo plunge into water when scorched,\nTo rush into fire when freezing—\nThough the suffering ends,\nThe body must die.\n\nA chest’s obstruction cannot be drilled,\nA throat’s ailment cannot be scraped,\nA gnat’s sting cannot be shot,\nA louse’s bite cannot be hacked—\nWhy?\nTo remove small woes\nIs to invite greater ruin.\n\nThe wise sovereign and sagely ruler govern a great state\nLike handling the finest threads,\nLike guiding a tiny stream,\nLike discerning the autumn hair,\nLike hearing nothing yet all is heard—\nAs if present yet absent,\nAs if true yet false,\nAs if acting yet resting,\nIn the realm where action is both action and non-action,\nIn the wild where transformation is in both having and not having—\nWhere blessings are subtle and benefits scarce,\nWhere words are few and prohibitions rare,\nWhere movement occurs in the formless,\nAnd achievements flow throughout the lands.\n\nHe who grasps the essentials,\nMoves little yet gains much.\nHe who loses the opportunity,\nActs much yet gains little.\nThus, the subtle opportunity\nExceeds the expectations of ten thousand men—\nAs if in both having and not having,\nIt cannot be shown to others.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause he takes **Dao/Way** as father,\nAnd **virtue/power** as mother,\nDivine wisdom as teacher,\nAnd **Great Harmony (太和)** as friend,\nClarity and stillness as constant,\nSimplicity and ease as master,\nHeaven and Earth as law,\nAnd the interplay of **yin** and **yang** as model—\nThe sun and moon as ritual,\nAll things as exemplars,\nResponding to circumstances as fundamental principle,\nAnd sincerity as the foremost virtue.\n\nDistinguishing roles and duties,\nGuiding with subtle yet profound silence,\nDrawing forth the threads of governance,\nLifting the great essentials while seeking them within himself—\nThus, the people are like embryos,\nThe ruler is like an infant,\nCunning and deceit have no cause to arise,\nAnd cleverness finds no opportunity to emerge.\nAll things are equal and balanced,\nNone overflowing, none deficient,\nIn perfect accord and compliance,\nAll things flourish abundantly,\nSpirits and humans unite,\nTogether thriving in harmony,\nActing naturally without constraint,\nEach fulfilling its inherent potential.\n\nSilent as if without a ruler,\nSecure as if without spirits—\nAll things grow to completion,\nThe people live to their natural span,\nReaching the end of their days,\nNone perish prematurely.\n\nThis is called **Dao/Way** nurturing the world,\nIts spirits not acting with malevolence.\nThe ruler, if not **virtue/power** is lacking,\nThe spirits, if not divine, are not malevolent.\nThe ruler is not lacking in **virtue/power**,\nYet he universally applies benevolence,\nHis **virtue/power** permeates all directions,\nAnd he does not favor or pity selectively.\n\nThe spirits are not malevolent,\nYet they float in vague uncertainty,\nThey ride upon the slightest changes,\nThey traverse all lands,\nConforming to time’s transformations,\nTheir divine essence encompassing all things,\nYet they do not harm humanity.\n\nIt is not that their divine essence does not harm,\nBut when the sage rules above,\nHe aligns with Heaven,\nHumans and spirits harmonize,\nGreat transformation flows naturally,\nCunning does not arise,\nStrange things do not emerge,\nNone are full, none are empty—\nThe world murmurs in accord,\nAll things equal and balanced,\nNeither raising high nor digging deep,\nNot assaulting metals and stones,\nNot blocking rivers and springs,\nPeople do not migrate far,\nFood is not scarce—\nAll may be enjoyed,\nNone can be shaped or forced,\nGrasses and trees yellow and then fall,\nHumans transform fully and then end.\nThus, the sage does not harm.\n\nTherefore, what Heaven nurtures,\nWhat Earth contains,\nWhat **Great One (太一)** governs,\nWhat **Heavenly Unity (天一)** leads—\nThe four seasons converge,\nThe five phases align,\nJoy and sorrow share the same threshold,\nFortune and misfortune share the same gate.\nThus, what brings peace also brings peril,\nAnd what brings peril also brings peace;\nWhat preserves life also brings death,\nAnd what brings death also preserves life.\nHe who knows peace yet forgets peril is secure,\nHe who knows security yet forgets peril is in danger.\nHow may this be made clear?\n\nThe tiger and leopard, with their majestic forms and broad adornments,\nFirm claws and teeth, resplendent hides and abundant fur,\nDistinct markings bright and clear—\nThus they seize all beasts yet are mastered by humankind.\n\nThe fragrant and splendid grasses, with their radiant hues and sweet scents,\nThus delight the multitude yet harm their own roots.\n\nThe sovereign of a great realm, with vast lands and teeming people,\nHigh status and favored form, towering might and illustrious name—\nThus they provoke neighboring states yet endanger their own rule.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is upheld, they are steadfast as a flat stone,\nSecure as the great mountain.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is lost, they are perilous as a pile of eggs,\nLight as a feather.\n\nBoth weak, they suffer first;\nBoth chaotic, they perish first.\nThus, great realms are the steps to tyranny\nAnd the stage to ruin.\n\nTherefore, the sovereign of a great realm\nStands alone with none to rival,\nMountains encircle their borders, three sides blocked by defenses,\nRivers unite their flow, all things beneath them bow—\nThe hub of the feudal lords.\n\nA storehouse of fertile lands,\nThe corpse of the strong and mighty,\nThe master of power and influence,\nBound by unmeasured steadfastness,\nChoked by narrow and constrained paths.\n\nAbundant and rich, vast and easy,\nSpanning thousands of miles,\nTreasure and marvels without end,\nFew taxes or burdens upon the people,\nHerds and flocks roam freely,\nBoats and carriages numberless,\nArms and provisions piled high,\nThe people dwell in ease and joy,\nTravelers pause and stay—\nMen like grass and trees,\nCattle filling the hills and fields,\nHunting and tilling, their gains tenfold.\n\nThus, all under Heaven desire to submit,\nAnd ministers and generals strive to attach—\nWith chariots and cavalry charging boldly,\nA million armored men,\nDefending easy terrain, holding strong passes,\nFavored by Heaven’s order, Earth’s support—\nThey suspend life, dictate death,\nAssist them and they gain strength,\nBetray them and they lose their ancestral halls.\nThus, the feudal lords desire their alliance,\nAnd all under Heaven fears their might.\n\nSo-called great realms,\nAre the currents of all under Heaven,\nThe meeting of all under Heaven’s exchanges.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is extended, they can unite and encompass,\nWhen virtue and favor are exalted, they can issue commands,\nWhen they are struck, they can exalt benevolence,\nWhen they govern, they can clarify righteousness,\nWhen they unite, they can expand their lands,\nWhen they take, they can grow their wealth—\nThus the feudal lords delight in them,\nAnd ministers and generals profit from them.\n\nTherefore, from ancient times to today,\nGreat realms—like the female—\nConquer with stillness the male,\nUnchanged for ten thousand ages,\nUnaltered for a hundred thousand years.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThey receive the full with emptiness,\nThey respond to the present with the void,\nThey do not seek to be great,\nBut strive to be small,\nThey do not seek to be high,\nBut always remain low.\n\nThe female guards with yielding softness,\nThe male seeks with forceful vigor—\nThus the female ever conquers the male with stillness.\n\nExcessive fullness brings regret,\nHence great realms should act as the lowly.\n\nThus, the enlightened kings and sage rulers in great realms\nExtend the **Dao/Way** yet do not claim possession,\nAct humbly yet do not seek subservience—\nTheir lands enfold the realms of feudal lords,\nYet none dare oppose them;\nTheir virtue encompasses the strength of feudal lords,\nYet none dare resist them;\nThey bow in submission to align with others’ will,\nTheir loyalty, integrity, and sincerity lead their officers—\nThey divide lands east and west to attract the worthy and brilliant,\nThey diligently till and weave to amass wealth and resources,\nThey form shifting alliances to guard against unforeseen threats.\n\nThey open granaries and distribute wealth,\nNourish the aged and feed the orphaned,\nRelieve the poor and aid the destitute,\nHonor recluses in their caves.\n\nThey receive yet do not take,\nThey grant yet do not withhold—\nSoftness, simplicity, and ease,\nTaking no action while in position.\n\nThough feudal lords may be greedy and vile,\nResentful and haughty, relying on strength,\nAnd though they dislike compliance and plot rebellion,\nThey are still subdued by the **Dao/Way**’s might and virtue’s weight,\nBy yielding stillness and humility—\nThen they mend their ways, correct their errors,\nCede lands and offer treasures,\nSubmit their allegiance, even risk their lives,\nAnd beg to be made vassals, border guards of their realm.\n\nSo-called great realms acting humbly toward small realms,\nAre those who take small realms.\n\nWhen they occupy small and weak realms,\nThey follow the **Dao/Way** in action,\nGovern with moderation and care,\nWealth in boats and carriages,\nStrength in arms and provisions,\nLoyalty, sincerity, and honesty—\nThey value simplicity and honor tillage,\nTilling and weaving are their duties,\nThey do not tax the people,\nSuperior and inferior in harmony,\nAffection like father and son,\nThe ruler as the heart within the body,\nThe people as its limbs—\nTheir realm unified in peace,\nThey can share life and death,\nSuperior and inferior in accord,\nThey can join with neighboring states in mutual trust.\n\nThough the sovereigns of great realms\nBear the weight of many strong powers,\nHold sway over influence and authority,\nLeft with virtue and right with benevolence,\nTheir hearts like hungry tigers,\nTheir wrath like surging springs—\nThey do not delight in giving,\nBut always wish to devour others.\n\nYet if they gain the will of Heaven,\nThe favor of the people,\nThe trust of ministers and generals,\nThe aid of neighboring states,\nAnd raise the unmeasured might of their enemies,\nIf they display their unfathomable power,\nIf they humble their bodies and exhaust their sincerity,\nIf they act with clear and tranquil purpose—\nThen their spirits are moved, their minds swayed,\nTheir wrath shifts, their calamities depart,\nAnd they become my strange allies.\n\nSmall realms acting humbly toward great realms,\nAre those who take great realms.\n\nThose who take great realms,\nAre those who seize what others depend upon.\n\nThe superior who takes from others,\nTheir lands vast, their influence abundant,\nTheir virtue broad and their power heavy—\nThis is what others seek.\n\nGreat realms, acting without force,\nCan secure this advantage.\n\nBut they must always unite with the lowly,\nAnd thus gain what others possess.\n\nThe inferior who takes from others,\nTheir lands narrow, their people few,\nTheir power light and their virtue scarce—\nThis is what others easily seize.\n\nSmall realms, being light,\nAre often taken by others.\nForced to submit,\nThey must not be greedy.\n\nThus, without battle they destroy another’s city,\nWithout assault they surrender another’s stronghold—\nTheir lands expand, their names grow eminent,\nTheir ancestral halls stand in glory,\nTheir deeds and virtues flow without end—\nThis is what great realms aspire to.\n\nGreat realms, if they but guard their yielding nature,\nCan naturally hope for such benefits.\n\nIn alliance with great realms,\nIn close ties and bonds of kinship—\nWhen disasters strike, great realms share their concern,\nWhen neighboring states are in peril, great realms offer aid,\nThey bend beneath one man yet raise ten thousand above,\nTheir altars honored, their ancestral halls illustrious—\nTheir realm rich, their armies strong,\nTheir people and resources complete—\nTheir prosperity extends without end,\nThis is what small realms wish for.\n\nSmall realms serve the great with humility,\nAnd thus the great themselves bear their concern—\nThis is how they secure their survival.\n\nHence, they border neighboring lands with measured restraint,\nHold the scales of power without swaying,\nAct first to gain first advantage,\nThe humble govern the proud,\nThe still overcome the restless,\nThey occupy the high ground while yielding to the great—\nSmall yields to great, small gains from great.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe Way of Nature cannot be forced.\nWater flows downward when moved,\nHumans act when drawn by gain.\nIf the great release their dominance and entrust matters,\nThe many weak unite as one,\nEmerging from the unexpected—\nThis is how the strong perish.\n\nThus, the great should yield.\nWhen the great oppress the small, calamity follows.\nWhen the small retreat in humility, aid comes from the many—\nTherefore, the great should embrace yielding.\n\n---\n*Daoist Canon: The Dao of the *Zhi Gui* (指归)\nVolume Ten: On Calamities [Corrected from original

Register* (秘册本) and *Yìlán* (怡兰本) editions, as referenced in the original text.]*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Essence of All Things**\n\nThe Dao/Way is the essence of all things, opening and guiding them.\nIt is the treasure of the virtuous, who embody **weakness** (*yì* 翕),\nWhile the unvirtuous cannot preserve it—\nThey are bound by **rigid constraints** (*qūyuē* 拘约).\n\n**Fine words** (*měiyán* 美言) can secure what one desires,\n**Noble conduct** (*zūnxíng* 尊行) can elevate one to high rank.\nYet humans, when unvirtuous, love to act contrary—\nWhy should they abandon **favor** (*chǒng* 宠) and endure **deprivation** (*xiāo* 削)?\n\nThus, the **Sage-King** (*Shàngzì* 上子) establishes the **Son of Heaven** (*Tiānzǐ* 天子),\nAnd sets the **Three Exalted Ministers** (*Sāngōng* 三公)—\nAll are **virtuous and sage** (*xiánshèng* 贤圣).\nEven if one offers **a jade tablet** (*gǒngbì* 拱璧) as a light burden,\nOr **four steeds** (*xiāndàmǎ* 先驷马) for secure dwelling,\nIt is not as precious as **this Dao**—\n**Words and deeds** (*yánxíng* 言行) refined and cultivated.\n\nThe ancients valued this Dao because it harmonizes the human heart—\nWhy not say: *\"Seek and gain\"* (*qiúyǐdé* 求以得) is but **power and force** (*shìzé* 势则),\nAnd *\"Crime forgiven, none to blame\"* (*yǒuzuìyǐmiǎn* 有罪以免) is mere **self-indulgence** (*wéiwéiyǐwéi* 无以为)?\n\nThus, this Dao is **held in highest esteem** (*guì* 贵) throughout the world.\n\n**On Calamities** (*Zhǐguī* 指归):\nWood grows from its **root** (*běn* 本) to its **tip** (*mò* 末).\nThe tip depends on the **branches** (*tiáo* 条),\nThe branches on the **limbs** (*zhī* 枝),\nThe limbs on the **trunk** (*jìng* 茎),\nThe trunk on the **root** (*běn* 本),\nThe root on **Heaven and Earth** (*Tiāndì* 天地),\nAnd Heaven and Earth receive it from the **formless** (*wúxíng* 无形).\n\n**Flower and fruit** (*huāshí* 华实) arise from **vital qi** (*yǒuqì* 有气),\nVital qi from the **four seasons** (*sìshí* 四时),\nThe four seasons from **yin-yang** (*yīnyáng* 阴阳),\nYin-yang from Heaven and Earth,\nAnd Heaven and Earth receive it from the **formless**.\n\nThus, I know the Dao/Way—\nFrom the **formless shape** (*wúxíng* 无形) and **featureless aspect** (*wúzhuàng* 无状),\nOpening **emptiness** (*xū* 虚),\nGuiding **spiritual penetration** (*shéntōng* 神通),\nHarmonizing Heaven and Earth,\nCalming yin-yang,\nRegulating the four seasons,\nResolving the myriad regions,\nDiverse forms and kinds all flourish and complete.\n**Transformation and change** (*biànhuà* 变化) know no end—\nThe **constant** (*cháng* 常) is **non-action** (*wúwéi* 无为).\nNo love nor hatred, it aligns with all things—\nAll classes respond, each attaining its proper course.\n\nThis is the Dao/Way, the essence of all things.\nThe virtuous who attain it **expand and contract** (*yìzhāng* 以翕以张),\nPure and serene, soft and weak,\nSilent and indistinct—\n**Ren** (*rén* 仁) is gentle and harmonious,\nNourishing and tranquil, **virtue** (*dé* 德) is **power** (*shì* 势) yet **subtle** (*wúxíng* 无形).\n**Great and small** (*dàxiǎo* 大小) are **comprehensive** (*zhōumì* 周密),\nFine and minute are **invisible** (*wúxíng* 无形),\n**Mysterious penetration** (*Xuándá* 玄达) reaches all affairs,\nAnd returns to the **Nameless** (*wúmíng* 无名).\n\n**Change and return** (*zhōngshǐ* 终始) are **reversed** (*fǎnfù* 反覆),\nAll blessings arise naturally—\nActing, one secures what is desired,\nStillness, one avoids what is harmful.\nAbove all others, its **virtue** (*wéi* 威) and **power** (*dé* 德) are **self-evident** (*zìmíng* 自明).\nIt **overcomes the firm** (*jīan* 坚) and **conquers the great** (*dà* 大),\nNone can rival it in **duality** (*shuāng* 双).\nThus, it is the treasure of the virtuous.\n\nThe **wicked** (*xiōng* 凶) who attain it **emit and expand** (*fāzhāng* 以发以张),\nFirm and rigid, yet **coarse and scattered** (*yǐcū* 以疏),\n**Substance and action** (*shí* 实) come **first** (*xiān* 先),\n**Arrogance** (*jiāo* 骄) overflows, **swelling** (*yì* 溢) in **grandeur** (*zhuàngdà* 壮大),\n**Fullness** (*shèng* 盛) and **excess** (*mǎn* 满) **strengthen to extremity** (*yǐqiángjí* 以强极),\n**Ambitious cultivation** (*guāngxiū* 广修) is **boundless**

(*qiángdàzhōngxiǎo* 强大终小),\n**Calamity does not come** (*bùhuòzìshēng* 不祸自生)—\nActing, one loses what is desired,\nStillness, one suffers harm.\n**Heart troubled** (*xīn yōu* 忧), **resolve diminished** (*zhì xiāo* 志削),\nThen one **returns to the norm** (*fǎnzhèngcháng* 反正常).\n\n**Spiritual qi** (*shénqì* 神气) is **agitated** (*fáncù* 烦促),\n**Contracting** (*qū* 趋) while **expanding** (*zhāng* 张) is abandoned,\n**Oppressed and confined** (*yùyuē* 郁约), yet **words are humble** (*cí bēi* 辞卑),\n**Bound and restrained** (*jūzhì* 拘制), yet **body is lowered** (*tǐ jiàng* 体降),\n**Driven

while **easing restraints** (*yìjié* 易节),\n**Aligning with the virtuous** (*yǔjūnzǐ* 与君子同).\n\n**Crime is fixed** (*zuìdìng* 罪定) yet **words are good** (*yánshàn* 而言善),\n**At death’s door** (*línsǐ* 临死) yet **love for life** (*ài shēn* 爱身),\n**Obedient to Heaven’s decree** (*yīfèng Tiānshù* 一奉天数),\n**Changing nature** (*biànxìng* 变性) and **easing emotions** (*yìqíng* 易情),\n**Finding joy in poverty** (*ān pín* 安贫) and **delighting in hardship** (*lè kùn* 乐困),\n**Lowliness and humiliation** (*bēijiàn* 卑贱) as **constant** (*cháng* 常),\n**Honoring Heaven** (*zūn Tiān* 尊天) and **respecting

下列犬羊),\n**Heaven’s net is drawn** (*Tiānwǎng yǐfā* 天网以发),\n**Yet nature does not hear** (*zìrán bùtīng* 自然不听).\n\nAh, how painful it is!\nThis warning is **most clear** (*shènmíng* 甚明).\nThe unvirtuous do not preserve themselves—\nThey **burden** (*lěi* 累) the **True** (*Zhēn* 真).\nWhen the burden is complete,\nThey **regret too late** (*fānghuǐ bùjí* 方悔不及).\n\nThis is like **digging a well when thirsty** (*línkě juéjǐng* 临渴掘井),\nNot as wise as **ordering affairs before chaos arises** (*lǐ yú wèiluàn* 理於未乱).\nThese two paths diverge—\nBoth stem from **Daoic practice** (*dàoxíng* 道行),\n**One precedes, one follows** (*zàiqián zàihòu* 在前在后),\n**One thrives, one perishes** (*huòcún huòwáng* 或存或亡).\nThe virtuous **practice the Dao first** (*xiāndào* 先道) and **thrive**,\nThe wicked **practice the Dao late** (*hòudào* 后道) and **perish**.\n\nThus, **words and deeds** are the **litigation of the self** (*zhìshēn zhī yù* 治身之狱).\n**Timely harmony** (*shíhé* 时和) and **order of precedence** (*xiānhòu* 先后)\nBelong to the **Great Destiny** (*dàmìng* 大命).\n\nTherefore, the **virtuous person** (*jūnzǐ* 君子) in **self-cultivation** (*lìshēn* 立身):\n**Like the deaf** (*rú hā* 如哈) and **like the mute** (*rú lóng* 如聋),\n**Like the uncarved block** (*ruò pǔ* 若朴) or **plain wood** (*ruò zhì* 若质),\n**Hiding words in the heart** (*cángyán yúxīn* 藏言於心),\n**Ever dwelling in silent mystery** (*chángchǔ xuánmò* 常处玄默),\nWhen speaking, **deep reflection** (*shēn sī* 深思),\n**Voice rises like weeping** (*fāshēng ruòkū* 发声若哭),\n**Harmonious and yielding** (*héshùn shíshì*

fills the world** (*yán mǎn tiānxìa* 言满天下) yet **is not excessive** (*bù duō* 不多),\n**Vibrations reach the four seas** (*zhèndòng sìhǎi* 振动四海) yet **are not hasty** (*bù sù* 不速),\n**Connecting all

谦虚止足),\n**Self-abasing** (*bēisǔn zìmù* 卑损自牧).\n\n**Joy in lowliness** (*lè xià* 乐下) like water,\nEnduring yet **never rigid** (*jiǔ ér bùshì* 久而不式),\n**Lowering ever further** (*xià zhī yòu xià zhī* 下之又下之),\nTo the **ultimate extreme** (*yuánjí* 元极),\nThe world responds to them—\nThus, they can **have a realm** (*yǒu guó* 有国).\n\n**Noble conduct** can **elevate others** (*jiā rén* 加人).\nWhy is this so?\n\n「Human nature and disposition are such that they delight in honor and favor, abhor lowliness and shame, resent when diminished, rejoice when enriched, take pleasure in being lowered, and scorn being restrained. This is the universal Dao of past and present, and the natural logic of human hearts.\n\nThe worthy practice this even more so; the petty even more so. Therefore, when one cultivates noble speech and conduct, there will be no misfortune in one’s undertakings.\n\nIn ancient times, those who led the people—how could they be abandoned? The officials of Jie and Zhou could be made to follow virtue. The soldiers of Qin and Chu could be made to follow virtue.\n\nWhat is called \"what people do not approve of\"—how could it be abandoned?\n\nThus, if one can win their hearts, the realm may be obtained; if one cannot grasp their intentions, even one’s wives and concubines will not obey.\n\nHow can this be demonstrated?\n\nThe rank of nobility commands the realm,\nWealth possesses the four seas,\nMight and influence are boundless,\nAbsolute power and authority are held—\nthese are what people fear.\n\nTo establish the Son of Heaven.\n\nTo depart from the ranks of foot soldiers,\nTo leave the common troops,\nTo rise with grand purpose like a dragon,\nTo assist the Son of Heaven,\nTo spread the Way and display virtue,\nTo enact all good governance,\nTo let benevolence flow to all households,\nTo honor and illuminate one’s ancestors—\nthese are what people benefit from.\n\nTo appoint the Three Exalted Ministers.\n\nUsing what people fear to seek what they benefit from,\nWith speech that is not beautiful and conduct that is not respectful,\nEven if one presents the great jade tablet or holds precious treasures to offer,\nEven if one rides in a fine carriage with four horses,\nThe worthy’s heart will remain doubtful and hesitant,\nThe Mysterious Sage will remain deeply hidden,\nAnd the gentleman will not come.\n\nBecause the Son of Heaven possesses an awe-inspiring might,\nAnd the Three Exalted Ministers bestow abundant blessings upon the people,\nYet relying solely on oneself to lord over others,\nOffering the jade and silk of favors,\nPeople will not submit to it.\n\nThus, it is said: *It is better to sit and advance this Dao than to labor with carriages and treasures.*\n\nWhen speech and conduct are refined within,\nThen the spirit and qi overflow outward.\nWithout the toil of four horses or the expense of precious jades,\nThe scholars of the land will respond in harmony like the wind,\nAnd the virtuous, heroic, and talented will gather from all directions,\nTheir radiance reaching its peak.\nThe Sage will descend, and the court will abound with gentlemen.\n\nThis is because of *sitting and advancing this Dao*.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao so highly?\nBecause speech aligns with Heaven and Earth yet does not boast,\nConduct harmonizes with human hearts yet does not rely on force,\nReputation is achieved without display,\nAccomplishment is realized without possession.\n\nEmotion and disposition flow naturally,\nNot seized for personal gain,\nBut to follow the Way,\nNot for oneself,\nAll things return to it,\nAnd it governs the realm.\n\nThis is called *obtaining without seeking, having virtue without claiming*—\nThus, it is valued by all under Heaven.\n\n**On the Chapter of Non-Action (Wuwei)**\n\nNon-action is formless,\nNon-doing is silent,\nTastelessness is nameless.\n\nGreat or small, much or little—virtue and power are manifest,\nYet repaying grudges with virtue is done before they arise.\nPlanning for difficulties in ease,\nConsidering what is not yet formed,\nActing for the great in the small,\nMaking the subtle profound—\nThis is how the Sage says that even the brightest ruler\nNever undertakes great matters in their slightest form,\nThus achieving their grandest purpose and aligning with humanity.\n\nThose who make light of promises must be few in trust—*this cannot be done*.\nThose who act on many trifles must face many calamities—*this cannot be relied upon*.\n\nEven the Sage finds difficulty in constant scheming,\nThus ultimately avoiding calamity and achieving completeness.\n\n**On the Principle of Return (Zhigui):**\n\nThe numbers of the Divine Mind,\nThe Dao of Nature—\nWhat is not born does not perish,\nWhat is born does not persist,\nWhat neither perishes nor persists\nIs the birth of what neither perishes nor persists.\n\nFrom this perspective,\nSorrow does not generate sorrow,\nJoy does not generate joy,\nNeither sorrow nor joy\nIs the birth of sorrow and joy.\n\nThus, those dwelling in misfortune gain blessings,\nThose dwelling in blessings suffer misfortune.\nThe master of blessings and misfortune lies with the ruler.\n\nTo act without form,\nTo listen without sound,\nWithout form or sound, it becomes profound and far-reaching—\nThus, *non-action’s function is great*, while *action’s function is small*,\n*Virtue’s power is thin*, while *non-virtue’s power is thick*.\n\nOne who embodies *neither non-being nor being* yet generates *non-being and being*\nCan transform misfortune and blessings,\nNeither misfortune nor blessing,\nYet can resolve both.\n\nLike a mirror before one’s face,\nActing before what has not yet arisen—\nThus, it becomes profound and far-reaching, great and thick.\n\nHence, the Sage does not act for being,\nDoes not act for non-being,\nDoes not act for death,\nDoes not act for life,\nBut wanders in the realm of *non-being*,\nDwells in the space between death and life,\nAdapting and responding naturally,\nThus maintaining the constant.\n\nTherefore, *without looking, they see*,\n*Without listening, they hear*,\nSupporting and stabilizing Heaven and Earth,\nEmbellishing the Way and nourishing the spirit,\nLifting and guiding all things,\nRuling the imperial realm and governing the people,\nFreeing emotions and releasing intentions—\nAll return to their original truth.\n\nThis is called *Non-action as Non-action*—\nSimply responding to the appropriate changes.\n\nThey have never truly known,\nThus they can do without limit.\n\nNot creating life’s burdens,\nNot stirring up affairs,\nNot adding with kindness,\nNot bestowing with benefit,\nTeaching what cannot be taught,\nGuiding what lacks awareness,\nCutting off what the people delight in,\nTo follow their true emotions,\nPermitting what the people abhor,\nTo grasp their true intentions.\n\nExiting the door of untimely death,\nEntering the path of eternal life,\nSoaring in the Mysterious Depths,\nRejoicing in the Great Primordial,\nDim and vast, beyond knowing,\nThick and murky, as if in darkness—\nThe world knows no troubles.\n\nThis is called *Non-doing as doing*—\nSimply altering what has already become.\n\nThey have never truly thought,\nThus they reach *Non-doing*.\n\nTasting what is tasteless,\nObserving what is formless—\nThus they can distinguish the categories of similarity and difference,\nAnd clarify the nature of right and wrong.\n\nActing before what has not yet arisen,\nFixing before it has tilted—\nBrave deeds are unseen,\nWise names are unclaimed,\nBlessings do not arise,\nMisfortunes do not take root—\n*Blessings without blessings*\nRest in the silent,\n*Misfortunes without misfortunes*\nCease in the nameless,\nEnsuring the people’s peace and joy,\nAnd the realm’s great harmony.\n\nThis is called *Tastelessness as taste*—\nSimply discerning what has not yet sprouted.\n\nThey have never truly intended,\nThus they achieve without limit.\n\nTherefore, the ruler worries and alleviates calamity,\nExtends and secures blessings,\nKills traitors who dishonor the lord,\nAvenges those who insult the father,\nOvercomes those who create difficulties,\nDestroys those who stir up chaos,\nRepels bandits who invite disaster,\nPunishes rebels who defy order.\n\nWhen brave deeds are seen, they conflict with Heaven,\nWhen wise names arise, they oppose the Way.」\n\n「When actions stir the people’s delight,\nYet labor yields little virtue—\nWhen deeds are done and the people rejoice,\nYet the giver’s kindness is slight.\n\nIf one cannot practice *wuwei* (無為) as *wuwei*,\nAnd treat affairs as nonexistent,\nThen the vast benefits of earlier efforts\nAre outweighed by the petty gains of later kindness—\nGreat and small differ in measure,\nAnd blame for calamity is unavoidable.\nThus it is said: *\"Great and small, much and little.\"*\n\nTherefore, loyalty and trust are undermined,\nRighteous undertakings perish,\nAnd those who oppose naturally submit,\nWhile the clever fly high.\n\nThose who usurp merit are exposed,\nThose who steal authority are revealed,\nThe violent prosper in chaos,\nThe deceitful thrive in corruption.\n\nRight and wrong are inverted,\nThe realm teeters toward collapse,\nThings lose their natural order,\nAnd states perish in ruin.\n\nThus, it is better to prevent calamity\nThan to remedy it after it has grown great;\nTo act before disorder arises\nIs nobler than to speak after it has begun.\n\nThis is the benefit of *unspeaking*,\nThe nobility of *wuwei*.\n\nHence, the virtuous one\nActs before the first stirrings,\nStays still in the absence of absence,\nSpreads the Dao and bestows virtue,\nTransforms and harmonizes in the mysterious,\nAngers without showing anger,\nSpeaks without uttering words,\nStrikes without daring to attack,\nDefends without a fixed end,\nCommands without force,\nAnd avenges grudges before they sprout.\n\n*Virtue* is the root of order,\n*Grudges* are the end of affairs.\nTo extinguish the end and return to the root,\nOne must cultivate virtue and revert to the true—\nThen affairs and things dissolve unseen before they manifest.\n\nThus it is said:\nTo act before the first stirrings,\nTo speak before speaking—\nIs to avenge grudges with virtue.\n\nPlotting against difficulties while they are easy,\nTreating their fundamental causes,\nEradicating them before signs appear,\nSo they cannot take form—\nThen deeds are as fine as autumn hair,\nAnd achievements as vast as Tai Mountain.\n\nGreatness over smallness,\nTending to things thread by thread,\nRespectful and cautious,\nAs if beginning anew each time,\nNot yielding to desires,\nNot seeking personal advantage,\nAlways opposing what is done,\nAlone preserving the origin—\nWith time, all benefits accumulate,\nDaily progress knows no bounds.\nThough one does not strive for greatness,\nAffairs unfold naturally.\n\nThis is plotting against difficulties while they are easy,\nYet greatness arises from smallness.\n\nTherefore, when great calamities are about to emerge,\nThey are like evil winds invading a person.\nBefore they manifest,\nGuard against them so they do not come.\nWhen they lodge in the skin and hair,\nUse warm compresses to dispel them.\nWhen they reach the joints and tendons,\nApply gentle admonitions to remove them.\nWhen they affect the internal organs,\nA hundred medicines can cure them.\nWhen they penetrate to the marrow,\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot alleviate them,\nAnd *zaohua* (造化) cannot treat them.\n\nThis is what is meant by *\"difficult matters arise from the easy.\"*\n\nWhen great undertakings are about to begin,\nThey are like water flowing from mountains.\nAt first, it dampens and moistens,\nThen ripples appear,\nSteadily trickling and gathering,\nIt becomes rivers and valleys,\nSwelling and surging,\nCapable of carrying ships and floating stones,\nAnd finally forming vast seas,\nDeep and immeasurable.\n\nThis is how great undertakings arise from small beginnings.\n\nThus, when the sage establishes merit and renown,\nEven minute beginnings can become manifest,\nEven hidden origins can become clear,\nSmall beginnings can grow vast,\nAnd concealed truths can become evident—\nTheir ambition lies beneath the myriad people,\nSo they become rulers and kings.\n\nTheir authority shakes the world,\nThe Four Seas are all rectified,\nTheir commands are obeyed, their governance accepted,\nNone can stand against them—\nTheir virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nTheir wisdom shines like the sun and moon.\n\nThe sage never seeks greatness,\nAnd thus achieves it.\n\nTherefore, those who speak much of gratitude\nWill be burdened with many affairs and still lack trust—\nSuch behavior cannot be sustained.\nThose whose hearts easily sway\nWill accumulate difficulties and change—\nSuch behavior cannot be relied upon.\nLight promises lead to few fulfillments.\n\nTrust, when easily given, leads to many calamities—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nThus, the sage remains inwardly silent,\nUnmoved in action, speechless in words,\nUnseeing in gaze, unhearing in listening.\nIn motion, they are like Heaven and Earth,\nIn stillness, like spirits and gods—\nThey achieve without doing,\nThey inspire trust without speaking,\nAdvance with no rivals,\nRetreat with no limits,\nTheir body knows no minor worries,\nTheir state no trivial calamities.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao,\nDoes not engage in artificial deeds,\nAligns with the true and cultivates virtue,\nAnd naturally faces no calamities—\nThus they never encounter difficulties.\n\nWhy is this so?\nPeril lies in what seems not perilous,\nRuination lies in what seems not ruined—\nIt is clearly visible alone,\nAnd operates through formlessness.\n\nIn times of no danger,\nThey always regard it as dangerous;\nIn times of no ruin,\nThey always regard it as ruinous—\nWith trembling vigilance,\nThey act before the first signs appear,\nThus avoiding peril and ruin.\n\nTheir ease in holding fast is like their ease in maintaining the state and self,\nTheir ease in plotting against calamities is like their ease in preventing disasters before they arise,\nTheir ease in breaking calamities is like their ease in dispersing them before they settle,\nTheir ease in treating calamities is like their ease in transforming their roots before they manifest.\n\nThose who act invite defeat,\nThose who grasp invite loss—\nThus the sage, with *wuwei*, faces no defeat,\nKnowing it comes from itself;\nWith *wuwei* in grasping, faces no loss,\nKnowing virtue comes from itself.\n\nWhen the people engage in affairs,\nThey do so with purpose—\nThe sage always stops them\nBefore their undertakings are fully formed,\nThus avoiding defeat and blame.\n\nTherefore, the sage says of enlightened rulers:\nDesiring what they do not desire,\nThinking what they have not thought—\nThey do not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures,\nNor value jade and pearls.\n\nLearning what they have not learned,\nDoing what is empty—\nThey restore what others have already passed,\nAnd do not cling to the fading.\n\nThey aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nAssisting Heaven and Earth,\nYet do not dare to act artificially,\nNor to uphold false traditions.\n\n*Pointing to the origin:*\nBefore illness takes hold in a person,\nIt is easy for a physician to act;\nBefore a state faces peril,\nIt is easy for counselors to devise strategies;\nBefore grudges sprout like teeth,\nIt is easy to address them;\nBefore minor calamities grow strong,\nIt is easy to relieve them.\n\nHow should this be applied?»\n\nZhuangzi said:\nWhen a cart’s wheel is still intact,\nA child can guide it along—\nYet when it begins to wobble,\nToppling into ravines and heights,\nA thousand men cannot steady it.\n\nBefore an egg is cracked,\nA single finger can brush it—\nYet once it becomes a soaring wild goose,\nFlapping its wings through the clouds,\nNo snare or net can ensnare it.\n\nWhen a calf is still nursing,\nA single rope can restrain it—\nYet once it becomes a bull,\nNo net can contain it.\n\nWhen a tiger seizes the herd,\nFeeding on oxen and horses,\nNo sword or spear can resist it.\n\nThus, a single drop of water,\nOver time, becomes a river and sea;\nA small serpent, if not killed,\nTransforms into a divine dragon.\n\nAccumulated goodness leads to auspicious fortune,\nUnchecked evil leads to ruin.\n\nTherefore, when a successor-ruler governs,\nWith no grievances or malice,\nMinisters and officials are harmonized,\nThe people submit in peace,\nNeighboring states trade freely,\nNo slanderers or traitors exist,\nThe realm is tranquil and undisturbed,\nSuperior and inferior in accord.\nAt such times,\nRule requires no coercion,\nGovernance demands no force—\nNon-action, non-interference,\nAnd none can overcome it.\nIts stability is effortless to maintain.\n\nYet when a state teeters toward peril,\nThe people face ruin,\nDisasters loom though not yet manifest—\nAt this juncture,\nSafety rests within oneself, not others.\nCounsel need not come from sages,\nStrength need not come from warriors—\nYet even on one’s deathbed,\nDisaster may already be sealed.\nIts onset is easy to avert.\n\nWhen the ruler abandons the Dao,\nMinisters harbor resentment,\nNeighboring states cease trade,\nOfficials grow negligent,\nDisasters take root—\nThough still weak and fragile.\nAt this stage,\nWise men plot in secret,\nYet before action is taken, peril arises,\nBefore force is applied, ruin shatters.\nIts fragility is easy to break.\n\nWhen the ruler strays from rectitude,\nMinisters err in counsel,\nNeighboring states harbor grudges,\nThe people waver,\nDisasters have already surfaced—\nRoots and branches unmoored,\nAmbition rises, yet lacks support,\nAlliances form but do not bind.\nAt this point,\nHonoring the worthy while suppressing the masses,\nSevering loyalty and resolve,\nListening to whispers and probing faults,\nSeeking blame within oneself—\nYet even then, advisors scatter before battle is joined.\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse,\nThough already far harder than when unmanifest.\n\nThus, fortune and calamity arise from the nameless,\nLife and death emerge from the subtle.\nThese two forces intertwine,\nShifting like winds and waves,\nExtending and contracting like tides—\nAdvancing and retreating in chaos.\nTo hear them is impossible,\nTo see them is invisible,\nCunning cannot act upon them,\nWisdom cannot discern them.\nThe mechanisms of life and death, fortune and ruin,\nAre subtle, chaotic, and unseen.\n\nTherefore, the sage transforms through the Dao,\nTeaches through personal example,\nActs before things take form,\nGovern before disorder arises—\nWithout intervention, things settle naturally,\nWithout nurturing, things preserve themselves.\nAction aligns with fortune,\nStillness diverges from ruin,\nMysterious and obscure—\nNone perceive its origin.\n\nPreventing chaos before it arises,\nRectifying before imbalance,\nCutting off deceit at its root,\nSuppressing falsehood at its source,\nSealing the door to vice,\nBlocking the path to wrongdoing—\nBefore sprouts take hold,\nBefore signs appear,\nBefore destruction is visible,\nBefore annihilation is complete—\nTeach without teaching,\nGuide without naming,\nKnow without knowing,\nShape without form—\nChaos cannot take root,\nDisorder cannot emerge,\nThe world governs itself,\nLife unfolds naturally.\n\nThis is to act before existence,\nTo govern before chaos.\n\nAs for the great tree of Tai Mountain,\nIts roots rest in the shade,\nIts branches reach the sun—\nBranches sprawl, leaves spread,\nFruit lush and green,\nTrunks wide enough to embrace,\nTowers high beyond measure—\nYet it grows from nothingness,\nCompletes itself through non-action.\n\nWhat is called an embrace-worthy tree\nArises from the tiniest sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nBroad as hills, towering a hundred *ren* high,\nPiercing the heavens—\nYet it begins with a single clod of earth,\nRises from the ground.\n\nThus, the great is not forced to be great,\nThe small is not forced to be small,\nThe high is not forced to ascend,\nThe low is not forced to descend.\nNeither great nor small—\nThen greatness and smallness emerge.\nNeither high nor low—\nThen height and depth manifest.\n\nTherefore, the artificer\nDoes not leave traces of his craft,\nThe non-artificer\nProvides the path for creation.\nNot great, not small—\nThis is the path of non-action.\nNot high, not low—\nThis is the path of non-artificer.\nYet greatness and smallness,\nHighness and lowness—\nThese are the traces of action,\nThe marks of the artificer.\n\nThus, what is completed is ruined,\nWhat is pursued becomes harm,\nWhat is clung to leads to death,\nWhat is fostered is abandoned.\nGrasping what one desires,\nOne loses it.\nClinging to what one thinks,\nOne loses it.\nHolding onto oneself,\nOne loses oneself.\nFixating on one’s spirit,\nOne loses it.\n\nSeeking the path of non-action\nYet clinging to traces of existence—\nThis is why the artificer brings ruin,\nThe grasper invites loss.\n\nTherefore, the sage acts without acting,\nGenerates all things,\nDoes not cling, yet directs desire—\nLike two craftsmen building a high tower,\nOr Heaven and Earth nurturing mighty trees,\nNaturally, without effort.\nNon-action brings no ruin,\nNon-clinging brings no loss.\n\nVirtue and power do not envy,\nDivine clarity does not harm,\nHarmony knows no obstruction,\nGreatness knows no defeat.\nLife and death follow their course,\nFortune and misfortune find their due.\nThose who align with the Way attain it,\nThose who stray from it suffer it.\n\nWhen people face ruin,\nIt is because they abandon spontaneity\nAnd rely on cleverness and strength,\nRejecting their nature while embracing their undoing.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they seek what they seek,\nDesire what they desire.\n\nMen’s undertakings often falter at completion\nBecause they cling to desire and lose their foundation.\n\nIf one could truly\nTreasure the end as the beginning,\nAct without desiring,\nGuard what is not to be occupied,\nMove before the origin,\nReturn before the start—\nActing as if not acting,\nHaving as if not having,\nThough seemingly unaccomplished,\nThings naturally align.\n\nThe beginning may stray from the Way,\nYet the end will never lose it—\nThus there is no failure.\n\nWhen the spirit is disturbed and the essence muddied,\nWhen clarity fails to reach and action misses its mark,\nWhen stillness loses what it seeks—\nThis is the work of wealth and learning.\n\nOnly those who refine their emotions and transform their nature,\nWho delight in desire without desire,\nWho find joy in action without action—\nThese are the Way and virtue.\n\nWealth agitates the spirit,\nLearning breeds deceit.\nIf one desires not to desire, wealth loses its power;\nIf one learns not to learn, daily loss returns to truth—\nThus aligning with the Dao and virtue,\nNo multitude of faults can persist.\n\nTherefore, cherish the Way as one cherishes a beloved,\nAbhor wealth as one abhors losing one’s own body,\nPonder thought beyond thought,\nSeek what is beyond seeking—\nClear and all-encompassing,\nLearning what cannot be known,\nSkilled in shaping all things,\nYet knowing what cannot be done—\nTurning from what the masses pursue,\nReturning to the void and the formless.\n\nDesiring not to desire, one enters the boundless mystery;\nLearning not to learn, one reaches the utmost subtlety—\nPenetrating what the enlightened cannot fathom,\nExhausting what the common cannot measure,\nAchieving what the accomplished cannot do,\nAttaining what none can possess.\n\nThe mind profound, the form serene,\nLying like a corpse, standing like withered wood—\nNo thought, no deliberation,\nAs if unaware of all things.\n\nLet things follow their nature,\nLet affairs unfold of themselves—\nEmpty, still, and solitary,\nThe body uninvolved,\nAll things in their proper place—\nTowering like a mound, vast like the ocean’s expanse,\nRaised and discarded, ever contrary to the world—\nAll things respond in kind,\nThus attaining depth and distance.\n\nThe world’s great reversal,\nMoving with the divine transformation,\nAiding Heaven, assisting Earth,\nDaring not to create what is good.\n\nThe true practitioner of the Way is manifest.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in the Way\nGoverned themselves thus—\nNot to enlighten the people with knowledge,\nBut to blind them, sealing their hearts.\n\nThe people’s difficulty in governance cannot be measured,\nFor their wisdom abandons loyalty and sincerity.\n\nTo rule with wisdom benefits the state but harms the people;\nNot to rule with wisdom preserves the natural purity—\nThe state’s blessing, the people’s survival.\n\nKnowing these two paths—calamity and blessing—\nThese are the fundamental patterns of right and wrong.\n\nAlways knowing the patterns to apply to the ruler’s body—\nThis is called the profound virtue, unseen and unheard.\n\nProfound virtue is deep, unseen,\nFar, unimaginable,\nContrary to things, distinct from the spirit—\nUntil it reaches the perfect harmony of the world.\n\n**The Conclusion:**\nDao and virtue, divine and mundane,\nPure and impure, the Great Harmony—\nHeaven, Earth, and all things,\nLike roots and branches.\n\nNumbers follow in sequence,\nQi transformations connect—\nSuccess and decline, fortune and misfortune,\nAll share in the same fate.\n\nThe intent of Dao and virtue,\nThe heart of Heaven and Earth—\nPeaceful generation, joyful repose,\nHatred and injury, life and death—\nThus the Sage is named King of all things.\n\nBenefiting others brings their blessing,\nHarming them brings their fear—\nThe Sage fears greatly,\nFearful of future calamity,\nDeeply tracing its origins—\nNone better than returning to nature,\nFor nature’s path lies in the formless.\n\nHow may this be made clear?\nZhuangzi said:\nHeaven and Earth do not know the workings of virtue,\nYet they act accordingly;\nAll things do not see Heaven and Earth’s methods,\nYet they cannot be preserved;\nThe masses do not recognize the ruler’s intentions,\nYet they may be at ease;\nThe limbs and orifices do not understand the heart’s guidance,\nYet they remain whole.\n\nThe ruler of all things is like the heart to the body.\nThe heart to the body—\nWhat comes first or last?\nFlowing through the blood and vessels,\nPresent everywhere,\nAbove and below, inside and out—\nNothing escapes its influence.\nMoving with change, containing the spirit,\nBalanced within, contrary without—\nThus all is preserved.\n\nTherefore, the ancient emperors and kings\nFollowed Dao and virtue,\nOrganized divine and mundane,\nUnified purity and impurity,\nLed the Great Harmony—\nNot with innate knowledge to act,\nNot to open the world or guide customs,\nBut to dull the people’s senses,\nSeal their hearts,\nPrevent them from knowing,\nReturn them to nature.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in the Way\nDid not enlighten the people,\nBut sought to blind them.\n\nThus, placing the people in the bright and clear,\nWhile dwelling in the murky and obscure,\nTeaching them ignorance,\nGuiding them with the formless—\nFilial piety and brotherly love unseen,\nRen and righteousness unexalted,\nThe ruler without honor,\nThe wise without renown.\n\nTeaching without teaching,\nFlowing through the four seas,\nDoing without doing,\nReaching the eight directions—\nMoving with Heaven and Earth in rhythm,\nResting with Dao and virtue in harmony,\nAll things flourishing together,\nEach knowing its place—\nNames and realities arising together,\nEach fulfilling its role.\n\nHarmonious qi flows freely,\nThe world in childlike simplicity—\nNo knowledge, no desire,\nNo action, no achievement—\nThe heart like wood and soil,\nThe will like dead ashes—\nSeeing no difference, no fortune or misfortune,\nThus the people are easily governed and the world may be at peace.\n\nTherefore, what benefits the people is their ease,\nWhat sustains them is their life—\nYet the people stray from ease and life, making governance difficult,\nBecause of their knowing.\n\nWhen the people know, they desire to live;\nDesiring to live, they begin their pursuits;\nPursuits begun, fame and gain arise;\nFame and gain arise, contention and strife follow;\nStrife and contention breed great deceit;\nGreat deceit breeds difficulty in governance.\n\nThe people’s difficulty in governance stems from their excess of knowledge.\n\nThus, ruling with knowledge,\nThe world spawns cleverness, deceit, and artifice,\nStrange things multiply,\nDesires know no end,\nLuxury and licentiousness cease not,\nDeceit and perversion flourish,\nThe bold and the cunning vie for dominance,\nNames proliferate in the valleys—\nGreat calamity arises.\n\nMinisters deceive their lords,\nSons rebel against their fathers,\nWhite is called black,\nAbsence is called presence,\nNames and realities invert,\nBanditry and slaughter ensue.\n\nUnsettled and restless, none find peace,\nLight and reckless, none remain whole—\nArmies march lightly, the world turns to war,\nThe dead numberless, rivers run with blood.\n\nGrief and resentment stir the heavens,\nStars scatter, sun and moon dim,\nYin and yang lose order,\nAll things are harmed—\nMountains wither, valleys dry,\nThousands of miles of barren earth,\nThe world in ruin,\nUntil people eat one another.\n\nThe fault lies not with Heaven,\nFor the Sage above delights in wisdom and instructs the myriad people.\nWhen the excess of favoring wisdom reaches this point,\nIt is said that governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state—\nA truth that cannot be false.\n\nAbandon cleverness and artifice,\nLet virtue be pure and simple.\nKnow alone, ponder alone,\nDesire nothing seen.\nFollow the people’s heart,\nClose their ears and eyes to falsehoods.\nEat no five flavors,\nWear no five colors.\nThe ruler, like Heaven and Earth,\nThe people, like grasses and trees.\nDwell in rocky retreats, find peace in valleys,\nDrink water, eat grass, seek no grains.\nKnow mother, recognize father,\nYet see no kin.\nStuporous and unknowing,\nUnaware of east or west,\nMen and women take no pleasure in one another,\nFathers and sons feel no fondness.\nWood and stone are not despised,\nGold and jade are not prized.\nClusters live together in harmony,\nThe world unites in one mind,\nThe eight extremes share purpose,\nThe nine regions align in wind.\nBorer-beetles do not act,\nPoisonous beasts do not arise,\nSpiritual dragons dwell among people,\nQilin and phoenixes roam the courts.\n\nGentle winds blow,\nSweet springs trickle,\nSweet dew falls,\nRed grasses flourish,\nFine millet thrives lush,\nAll things live eternally.\n\nThis is not Heaven’s blessing,\nBut the ruler’s knowing of the Unknowable,\nNaming the Unnameable.\nThe Unknowing-Knowing,\nThe Unnameable-Name,\nAligns with the Dao—\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\nThus, dimmed wisdom recognizes stupidity,\nAnd aligns with the Dao’s essence.\nKnowing stupidity, knowing wisdom,\nBoth align with the Dao’s intent.\nGovernance follows this,\nSometimes bringing harm, sometimes benefit.\nTo discern harm and benefit,\nGreat harmony naturally arises.\nTo grasp benefit and harm,\nAll things naturally align.\n\nTo govern with wisdom brings calamity and precedent;\nTo govern without wisdom brings blessing and virtue.\nThese two paths serve as models.\nEver knowing these models,\nThis is called *Xuan De* (玄德).\n\nThus, the recognition of stupidity and wisdom\nOvercomes all obstacles.\nIn purity and stillness, a tranquil foundation,\nA hidden blessing for all beings,\nUnseen by the world—\nThus it is called *Xuan De*.\n\n*Xuan De* is profound, immeasurable;\nDistant, beyond reach;\nOpposed to things, none can overcome it.\nIt is said: *Xuan De* is profound, distant, opposed to things.\nWhen *Xuan De* descends,\nIt drifts, surges, retreats, indistinct—\nOpposing things in action,\nHarmonizing with virtue and the Way,\nGuiding spirit and clarity,\nEmbracing all lands,\nUnbounded in scope.\nBeyond the six extremes, within the minutest measure,\nNo place is untouched by its virtue and benevolence,\nPreserving life and nature,\nEnding at Heaven’s appointed time,\nNurturing what is natural.\nThis is called *Great Harmony*.\n\n**The Chapter on Rivers and Seas**\nRivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they are thus—\nThey are below all streams,\nThus they rule all valleys without submission.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says of the enlightened ruler:\nTo place oneself above the people is to occupy the highest position,\nYet to speak in humility aligns with the people’s hearts.\nTo act before the people is to avoid their calamities,\nYet to place oneself last ensures their security.\nTo lead the people is to be their model,\nYet to harm none clarifies one’s virtue.\nThe world willingly follows,\nYet the ruler does not know he is being offered—\nNot to compete for position,\nThus none can contend, none can prevail.\n\n**The Principle of Return:**\nVirtue and the Way do not create the myriad things,\nYet the myriad things arise naturally.\nHeaven and Earth do not gather the myriad beings,\nYet the myriad beings find refuge in them.\nNatural things do not seek to rule,\nYet things rule themselves.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth, vast and myriad, are ruled by the Dao;\nThe myriad suns blazing, are ruled by Heaven;\nThe yin essence flowing, is ruled by Earth;\nThe naked dwell in caves, ruled by the Sage;\nThe winged soar in emptiness, ruled by the Divine Phoenix;\nThe furred tread the earth, ruled by the Qilin;\nThe scaled dwell in waters, ruled by the Spirit Dragon;\nThe shelled dwell in marshes, ruled by the Sacred Tortoise;\nAll streams converge, ruled by the River and Sea.\n\nThese nine rulers\nDo not claim dominion over things,\nYet things return to them.\nWithout laws or measures,\nYet things govern themselves.\nWithout benevolence or righteousness,\nYet things attach to them.\nWithout exerting wisdom or strength,\nYet things fear them.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThey embody the Dao, harmonize with nature,\nDo nothing to things,\nYet things transform under their influence.\n\nThus, the River and Sea’s rule\nIs not through accumulating virtue or deeds,\nNor through flowing spirit and grace,\nNor through bestowing favors to win allegiance;\nNor through upholding rites and propriety,\nNor through eloquence and cunning,\nNor through displaying wisdom and skill,\nNor through extraordinary actions or schemes,\nNor through wielding might and terror,\nNor through exhausting life’s energies to control them—\nBut in stillness and humility, waiting below,\nIn non-action and non-seeking,\nAll streams come naturally.\n\nThe streams do not hear of the Sea’s beauty,\nYet they are transformed by its virtue and return in reverence.\nNor does the Sea bind or teach them,\nNor set paths or mark directions—\nYet water, piercing metal, shattering stone,\nBoring cliffs, toppling mountains,\nRushing over hills,\nHastens to the Sea without return—\nForm and nature align,\nThings act naturally.\n\nFrom this, it is seen:\nGreat is the Way of humility and self-effacement,\nHarm cannot injure it,\nWisdom cannot seize it,\nStrong without battle,\nMighty without coercion,\nSilent and doing nothing,\nYet trading with all things.\n\nValleys are low but not east or west,\nThus they reach their end without exhaustion.\nRivers and seas dwell below but are not vast,\nThus they rule without ceasing.\nRivers and seas rule all valleys\nBecause they excel in humility—\nTruly so.\n\nThus, the enlightened king and sage,\nDesiring to honor the people,\nFollows nature’s essence,\nNurtures virtue’s grace,\nSpeaks in humble words, bows with respect,\nAssociates with the common folk,\nViews himself as the earth,\nServes the people as Heaven,\nIlluminated in solitary knowing yet unfathomable,\nOutstanding in singular ability yet untraceable,\nDeep in insight, broad in reach, yet impassable,\nClear and bright, flowing yet unobstructed—\nNot to dominate things,\nBut to follow, placing the people first.\n\nThe Sage, though possessing such abilities,\nDoes not place himself above others—\nFor he speaks humbly, does not lead—\nFor he follows with his own person.\nThus, the people willingly follow without tiring.\n\nTherefore, the people tread upon him as upon the earth,\nTrust him as though he were divine.\nEver above them, his land aligns with Heaven’s decree.\n\nIf he seeks to lead, yet dwells in obscurity,\nHolds the highest honor, yet lives long and unharmed,\nFinds joy in carefree existence—\nThen he abandons ambition, forsakes self,\nTo ensure the people’s ease.\nHe labors while the people rest,\nRetreats while the people advance,\nStands above while the people thrive,\nLeads while the people find security.\n\nBecause the people thrive, they revere him without burden,\nBecause the people are secure, they follow him without distress.\nThe reason they revere him without burden\nIs that he benefits them—\nThus, though he stands before them, they suffer no harm.\n\nTherefore, the world pushes him upward,\nDraws him forward,\nDelights in him without weariness,\nTakes joy in him without satiety.\n\nThus, the Sage’s rule is not one of seeking the people—\nThe people seek him.\nNot one of benefiting the people—\nThe people benefit from him.\nNot one of honoring the people—\nThe people honor him.\nNot one of leading the people—\nThe people lead through him.\n\nThus, he can exhaust hardship, adapt to change,\nRevive decay, rectify chaos,\nAchieving supreme peace,\nAbove aligning with virtue and power,\nBelow encompassing the divine and mysterious,\nDescending into the boundless,\nEmbracing the unfathomable,\nGalloping through Heaven and Earth,\nRanging across yin and yang.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause he abandons the mind’s designs and follows with his body.\n\nThus, the virtue of non-contention,\nRelies on the people’s strength,\nAligns with the Dao’s transformations,\nExtends with the divine’s extremes—\nOnly those who abandon knowledge\nCan follow its principles.\n\nHow could anyone contend with such a one?\nTherefore, royal affairs proceed naturally,\nCannot be arbitrarily initiated,\nAre attained through complete vitality,\nSustained by proper order,\nSage wisdom is innate,\nGovernance follows the Way.\n\nTo lose the order is to fail in royal affairs,\nTo abandon the Way is to misalign nature’s course.\nThus, the Sage trusts the Dao, not the self,\nFollows the Dao, not the heart,\nActs not for self, but for others,\nDoes not claim the world—\nThus, the world contends to serve him.\n\nTruly, these words are sincere.\nThe treasure of a nation,\nTen thousand emperors and kings cannot enact—\nOnly those who grasp even a fraction\nBecome the sovereign of all things.\n\nThe origin without end,\nReturning to exhaustion and constraint.\nTo harmonize with its subtlety,\nWithout incurring self-harm.\n\nThis is called *clinging to constancy*,\nBoundless and eternal.\n\nThe world calls me *manifest*—\nThe world calls me *with* and names me—\nGreatly resembling the unworthy,\nFormless as a shadow.\n\nFor only the great virtue is resplendent,\nThus resembling the unworthy—\nReturning to the nature of illness.\nIf resembling, it is honored by the multitude,\nYet its end is small—\nIt defies the natural order.\n\nI possess three treasures—\nThe Dao’s application.\nHold them and preserve them—\nThe heart’s origin.\n\nFirst: *compassion*—\nThe initial injury.\nSecond: *frugality*—\nModerating oneself.\nThird: *not daring to lead the world*—\nTrusting what comes after.\n\nCompassion thus generates courage—\nThe weak become strong.\nFrugality thus expands—\nModesty yields growth.\nNot daring to lead the world,\nTrusting nature’s course,\nThus one can perfect the vessel—\nThe later born surpass the first.\n\nNow, if one abandons compassion for rigidity,\nFrugality for ostentation,\nAnd \"trusting what comes after\" for leading,\nThen death ensues—\nThe great fate is lost.\n\nCompassion in war brings victory—\nThe people follow sincerely.\nIn defense, it secures—\nThe people’s loyalty is steadfast.\nWhen Heaven intends to save,\nIt shields from calamity—\nEnveloping life within.\n\nThe skilled warrior does not rely on force,\nThe skilled fighter does not rage,\nThe skilled victor does not retaliate,\nThe skilled ruler wins hearts—\nThus, their words and deeds are revered below.\n\nThis is called the virtue of *non-contention*—\nBlessings spontaneously arise.\n\nUsing others’ strength to achieve their deeds—\nThis is called *aligning with Heaven*,\nMatching Heaven’s course.\nThe ancient ultimate sages exhausted the Dao.\n\n**Reflections:**\nThings may share similarity yet differ,\nOr differ yet share similarity,\nOr appear false yet be true,\nOr true yet be false—\nThus the sage knows no woe,\nWhile the multitude suffers and grieves.\n\nThe sun and moon rise and set—\nDifferent yet equally bright.\nThe wise and foolish share form,\nYet their hearts differ.\nThe sage harmonizes with the world without distress,\nWhile the petty man seeks distinction—\nThus, he bears sorrow.\n\nHence it is said:\nThere is similarity within difference,\nTruth within falsehood.\n\nHow does one demonstrate this?\nZhuangzi said:\nThe rising and setting of the sun and moon—\nTheir brightness is the same.\nHuman life and death—\nTheir form is identical.\nThe seasons’ divisions—\nTheir benefits are equal.\nThe sage and the commoner—\nTheir appearance is alike.\nThe open-minded and the closed—\nTheir deeds are the same.\nThe Daoist and the infant—\nTheir efficacy is identical.\n\nAll these things,\nThough internally varied,\nExternally align—\nNone but the sage can clarify them.\n\nThus, the world harbors suspicions,\nDazzled by false appearances,\nEntangled in conflicting judgments—\nHence the sage appears unworthy.\n\nThe world calls me greatly unworthy.\nWhy so?\nThose who grasp the Dao—\nExternally absent, internally present,\nStudy to transform their nature,\nAct to govern themselves,\nSubstantial yet appearing empty,\nMysterious and indistinct,\nAs if without purpose,\nSpeech sparse, demeanor humble,\nAppearance crude and vulgar,\nYet their essence is boundless,\nTheir nature transcendent,\nQuiet and withdrawn,\nAs if without end,\nAvoiding renown, escaping influence,\nResting with the divine in rise and fall,\nEmbodying the Dao, walking in harmony,\nAll things in accord,\nNot conforming to the times,\nFriendly with Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe multitude, however, feigns and deceives,\nConsiders straightforwardness as ugliness,\nSuffers from misdirection,\nCalls it illness.\n\nOnly the great thus appears unworthy—\nHence the world deems it sickness.\n\nThe petty man is otherwise:\nWide learning, many knowledges,\nUsing wisdom to gain fame,\nUnusual conduct, conspicuous deeds,\nCreating doubt about virtue,\nDeceiving the world, ordering customs,\nAdorning speech, embellishing appearance,\nHumbling himself to curry favor,\nAnticipating intentions to win hearts,\nForming factions, harboring thieves.\nLaboring little yet receiving heavy rewards,\nAchieving few deeds yet holding high rank,\nWhile the nation grows poor and his family rich,\nThe ruler weakens while he grows powerful.\nWielding power to create change,\nSeizing advantage in prosperity,\nHis name and influence resound,\nShaking distant lands,\nArrogant, extravagant, violent,\nUnrestrained, unchecked,\nCompliant when favored, rebellious when opposed,\nActions costing lives, inaction breeding corruption,\nOpening his mouth to harm the people.\n\nThis is what the world honors,\nWhat society calls *resemblance*.\n\nIf so, then:\nThe Dao departs,\nThe divine withdraws,\nHeaven and Earth abhor,\nYin and Yang reject,\nKindred reject him,\nThe people do not follow,\nHis actions meet no end,\nHis stillness yields no gain,\nLife brings harm,\nDeath brings blessing—\nThe multitude, misled, leads others astray,\nTheir gains are meager,\nTheir days prolonged.\n\nThus, the petty man’s *resemblance* endures in triviality.\n\nBut those who grasp the Dao are otherwise:\nTheir body is empty, yet compassion accumulates,\nThey regard all things as themselves.\n\nFirst: *compassion*.\nRestraining form, moderating appearance,\nReturning to subtlety.\n\nSecond: *frugality*.\nSilent and withdrawn, trusting what comes after,\nNot leading the world,\nHarmonizing with nature’s course.\n\nThird: *not daring to lead the world*.\n\nTheir actions and stillness contrast with the multitude,\nTheir comings and goings pass through different gates,\nThey do not use courage to be courageous—\nThus, they do not rage, yet the world fears them.\n*Compassion thus generates courage.*\n\nThey do not use expansiveness to expand—\nThus, they do not bestow, yet the world follows them.\n*Frugality thus expands.*\n\nThey do not lead—\nThus, without speaking, the world reveres them.\n*Not daring to lead the world, thus perfecting the vessel.*\n\nHence, compassion transforms into courage,\nFrugality into expansiveness,\n\"Trusting what comes after\" into leadership—\nContrary to harmony, opposing the divine,\nDefying nature’s course,\nBlessings distance themselves,\nCalamities draw near,\nThe great fate is severed,\nDivine essence disperses,\nHeaven and Earth cannot sustain,\nThe Dao and virtue cannot endure,\nAt death, unaware,\nBlaming fate, reproaching Heaven.\n\nNot because fate is meager,\nNor because men are malevolent—\nBut because they revel in arrogance,\nDiscard the Dao, and rely on force.\n\nThis is called:\nAbandoning compassion for rigidity,\nFrugality for ostentation,\n\"Trusting what comes after\" for leadership—\nThus, death ensues.\n\nFor compassion as conduct—\nMost harmonious and true,\nIn action, it mobilizes strength,\nIn stillness, it aligns with Heaven’s will,\nHumbling the weak, ruling all things,\nRectifying the world, saving the people,\nHarmonizing Heaven and humanity,\nIn war, undefeatable,\nIn defense, unassailable.\n\nThe benevolent one—\nWhen waging war, triumphs;\nWhen defending, stands firm—\nThis is its nature.\n\nWhy so?\nHeaven and Earth arise together,\nTransformations endless, without bound.\n\nOn the day of battle,\nThe Earth stirs beneath,\nThe Heavens tremble above,\nHeaven sends omens of strife,\nEarth unleashes winds of chaos,\nGhosts and spirits manifest,\nTo foes, misfortune comes;\nIt aids my generals and ministers,\nIt aids my myriad people,\nYet enrages my soldiers,\nExtending to all living things.\n\nOxen lose their threshing,\nHorses lose their grain,\nBirds falter in flight,\nBeasts stumble on land,\nTigers and rhinos may be fought,\nSnatching birds may be led—\nFoes in terror, crouching beneath ambush.\n\nHeaven’s intent to save me,\nIs through benevolence as my shield.\n\nThus, the worthy counselor to a victorious general\nDoes not rely on strength or grandeur,\nNor on rigidity or harshness,\nBut yields to softness and weakness, fearing force#9,\nAnd the enemy then perishes.\n\nThe skilled soldier does not wield force.\nIn battle, he harms only outward intent,\nCherishing peace and harmony,\nDeclining small matters to trust in what follows,\nIn action and stillness, conforming to Heaven’s will,\nNot stirring wrath to provoke anger,\nNor using force to raise armies.\nThe skilled warrior does not rage.\n\nTo overcome the enemy,\nHe always acts contrary to expectation,\nPlans and movements unseen,\nTo capture the enemy’s resolve,\nActions spring from their own resources,\nTransformations arise from their own deeds—\nReverse and overturn them,\nTo handle their unexpected moves.\n\nThus, when they act deceitfully, I stand upright,\nWhen they speak, I listen,\nWhen they grow angry, I rejoice,\nWhen they move, I remain still,\nOpening what they seek to exploit,\nTo preserve their lives.\n\nThe skilled victor does not contend.\n\nIn employing men,\nI speak to them with humility,\nShow them their benefits,\nExplain to them with sincerity,\nAnd let them come of their own accord.\nThe skilled leader serves below.\n\nThus, without contention or demand,\nI gain the people’s intent,\nI follow the people’s hearts,\nHolding their key principles and prohibitions.\nThis is the virtue of non-contention.\n\nWhen others scatter, I remain united,\nWhen foes do not wish to perish, yet cannot,\nWhen I do not wish to persist, yet cannot—\nThis is the power of employing men.\n\nAt such times,\nThe Dao is without form,\nVirtue takes root,\nDivine clarity serves as the standard,\nGreat harmony as the measure,\nPure and impure as my domain,\nAll things as my children,\nThe Three Lights as my aides,\nThe Four Seasons as my assistants,\nStillness as the origin of all things,\nMovement as the beginning of transformation—\nAll beings entrust themselves to it,\nWithout fear of blame or retribution,\nMy virtue aligns with Heaven’s,\nEnduring forever without peril.\n\nFrom ancient to modern,\nThe Way of the sage and the wise,\nIn transformations from beginning to end,\nFrom Heaven to kingship,\nAll derive from this.\n\nThis is called:\nThe ancient peak of matching Heaven.\n\n**Dao De Zheng Jing (The True Classic of the Dao and

*Dao De Zheng Jing* – compiled by Yan Zhen of Shu Commandery, styled Jun Ping.**\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Use of Arms**\n\nThe use of arms has a saying: *Chen Ji Gang* (陈纪纲) teaches it.\n\nI do not dare to be the aggressor,\nNor to provoke the first strike—\nYet I follow as the guest,\nAnd let the people act.\n\nI do not dare to advance an inch,\nNor to retreat a foot in despair—\nYet I retreat a foot,\nAnd hope they will return.\n\nThis is called:\n**Action without action, countering with reverse.**\n**Repelling without arms, yet causing no harm.**\n**Seizing without weapons, foes find no response.**\n**Yet when facing the enemy, there is none before me.**\n\n**The greatest calamity is to slight the enemy and rely on oneself alone.**\n**To slight the enemy risks the loss of my treasure—**\n**The natural order of things.**\n\n**Guidance:**\n\nThe Dao is ever-present, yet its presence does not act;\nThe Way is ever-true, yet its truth does not force.\nHarmonize with nature, yield to weakness,\nYet embrace the great power within.\nNurture all beings, none can defy—\nNo form, yet the teacher of all things.\nWho attains it finds security,\nWho loses it faces peril.\nHeaven and Earth embody it,\nAnd endure without decay.\n\n**How may one emulate it?**\n\nZhuangzi said:\n**If there is no yin without yang, all things would not flourish;**\n**If there is no yang without yin, all things would not complete.**\n\nFrom this perspective,\n**Power without virtue cannot govern the people;**\n**Virtue without power risks the collapse of ancestral shrines.**\n**Lacking both virtue and power is to invite disaster—**\n**When fate shifts and changes, the ruler dies,\nAnd the nation perishes.**\n\nThus, the ruler is the **vital core of the state**,\nAnd the military is the **manifest power of the nation**.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth,\nAll nations rise and fall,\nGreat or small, wise or foolish—\nAll wish to be sovereign.\nThe wise submit when their wisdom is exhausted,\nThe strong yield when their strength is spent.\nThey do not have excess power,\nYet kneel willingly as subjects.\n\nHence, the enlightened kings and sage rulers,\n**Follow the Dao and emulate Heaven**,\n**Prioritize tranquility and purity**,\n**Maintain harmony and compliance**,\n**Adapt to circumstances as their foundation**,\n**Uphold sincerity and trust as their essence**,\n**Align name and reality as their standard**,\n**Employ rewards and punishments as their framework**,\n**Balance virtue on the left and power on the right**,\n**To counter misfortune**—\n**The world looks to them for order,**\n**None dare to harm or defy them.**\nThus, **the nation is preserved and the people are whole**.\n\n**Virtue and power, like Heaven and Earth, yin and yang,**\n**Are the martial and civil, surface and depth—**\n**Balanced and harmonious,**\n**Hidden in the mysterious realm,**\n**Only employed when absolutely necessary.**\n\n**Thus, when a ruler loses the Dao,**\n**Loves war and harms himself,**\n**Neglects proper governance,**\n**And indulges in corruption,**\n**He grows arrogant and extravagant,**\n**Disregards laws and weakens discipline,**\n**Adorns palaces and lavishes on horses,**\n**Builds lofty towers and vast enclosures,**\n**Pursues music and beauty—**\n**He slaughters loyal advisors,**\n**Honors favorites and beauties,**\n**Disrespects ancestral shrines,**\n**Insults elders,**\n**Oppresses with cruelty and violence,**\n**Leaves widows and orphans to perish,**\n**Defies Heaven and Earth,**\n**Violates the order of yin and yang,**\n**Disfigures virtue and power,**\n**Shatters divine clarity,**\n**Dissolves harmonious qi into filth,**\n**And disrupts the natural flow of transformation—**\n**Then winter thunders and summer frosts arise,**\n**And all things wither and die.**\n\n**With armies clashing and strategies unraveling,**\n**Plots bring only misfortune—**\n**Great nations tremble in fear,**\n**Small nations flee in terror,**\n**The elderly and weak scatter,**\n**Weeping as they depart—**\n**The world seethes with resentment,**\n**All people long for peace,**\n**Yet rise in rebellion,**\n**And I am left to follow their lead.**\n\n**Why is this so?**\n\nIt is because **their ancestors**,\n**Each possessed divine virtue and wisdom,**\n**Communed with Heaven and Earth,**\n**And labored for the benefit of all people.**\nThus, **they were granted the Mandate of Heaven,**\n**Received the land and noble lineage,**\n**Elevated as rulers,**\n**Their glory shining upon their forebears,**\n**Their deeds passed down to future generations.**\n\n**This is the heart of Heaven and Earth,**\n**The enduring merit of ten thousand years.**\nYet **those who inherit this legacy**,\n**Do not strive to humble themselves,**\n**Refine their essence,**\n**Or cultivate the Dao and virtue—**\n**Instead, they ignore small virtues and embrace small vices,**\n**Growing worse day by day, month by month.**\n**Ancestral shrines crumble,**\n**The nation becomes a ruin,**\n**Clans scatter and disperse,**\n**The young have no refuge—**\n**Ghosts and spirits, orphaned souls,**\n**Find no resting place.**\n\n**Alas! How can such a nation not decline?**\n\nThus, I instruct **my brave and bold warriors,**\nAnd speak to **my soldiers.**\n**The use of arms has a saying.**\n\n**Unarm the soldiers and release the weapons,**\n**Yet let them rest and recover.**\n**Exhausted by battle, their spirits shift—**\n**They may yet repent and change,**\n**Transform their appearance and ease their burdens.**\n\n**I do not dare to be the aggressor,**\n**Yet I follow as the guest.**\n**To march forward without return is to become a thief to the world—**\n**The people suffer to the extreme,**\n**Their wealth exhausted, strength spent,**\n**And woes grow daily.**\n**Heaven responds in kind,**\n**Disaster gathers upon the land—**\n**Though I wish to spare them,**\n**Destruction comes naturally.**\n**Heaven and people align in heart,**\n**I cannot overcome them.**\n\n**I do not dare to advance an inch,**\n**Nor retreat a foot in despair—**\n**Yet I retreat a foot,**\n**And hope they will return.**\n\nThus, **the mission is accomplished,**\n**Yet the spirit is weary;**\n**The body moves forward,**\n**Yet the resolve lingers behind.**\n**The form opposes my will,**\n**The deed defies my purpose.**\n**Action without action.**\n\n**Pity those sage ancestors,**\n**And lament the suffering of the people—**\n**They had no fault before Heaven,**\n**Yet why did they meet such ruin?**\n\nThough it seems sudden,\n**The lives of the people depend on war—**\n**When orders are given with sincerity and trust,**\n**They must be obeyed.**\n**Those who submit first are rewarded,**\n**Those who submit late are harmed,**\n**The small nations are benefited,**\n**The great nations thrive—**\n**Those who surrender their lands are granted titles,**\n**Those who yield their cities are given fiefs.**\n**If cities and lands do not surrender,**\n**Do not despair if they are not yet conquered.**\n\n**The guilty are pardoned,**\n**The capable are appointed,**\n**The elderly and weak are provided for,**\n**The dead are given proper burial.**\n**Repelling without arms shows no harm.**\n\n**Virtue and benevolence spread far and wide,**\n**Love and harmony flow among the people,**\n**Kindness and grace bind them together—**\n**All hearts are uplifted,**\n**And without a word, their spirits align with mine.**\n**Seizing without weapons:**\n\n**If my three armies share my resolve,**\n**The treacherous become my messengers,**\n**The thieves become my laborers—**\n**They teach me their strategies,**\n**And reveal their terrain.**\n**Using their own resources,**\n**My clever schemes succeed.**\n\n**Laws are not harsh,**\n**Dangerous obstacles are left unguarded—**\n**Heaven and people cooperate,**\n**Victory comes like the divine.**\n**No enemy remains before me,**\n**No strategy is lost—**\n**Though the foe be many,**\n**They provoke me,**\n**And when the two armies stand apart,**\n**They face none before them.**\n\n**Yet there is no enemy:**\n\n**Though war is fully prepared,**\n**The enemy cannot be changed.**\n**To change the enemy breeds deceit,**\n**And when defeat comes, I lose advantage—**\n**Fortune departs, calamity arrives,**\n**And I am despised by Heaven.**\n**The greatest calamity is to insult the enemy.**\nThus, **even if I gain Heaven’s favor**\n**And the aid of the people,**\n**I still hold them with concern,**\n**And grasp them with caution—**\n**Exiting peril, seizing opportunity,**\n**My encampments are fortified,**\n**My resting places secure,**\n**I rely on water and grass,**\n**Fill gaps and block flaws,**\n**And maintain distance from the enemy.**\n\n「If I insult the enemy, I shall perish—\nThus, I must act as I do.\n\nThe Dao’s flow is formless,\nIts stratagems emerge unseen,\nIts victories unfold endlessly,\nIts battles leave no trace.\nProfound and subtle, its transformations know no beginning,\nYet it remains close to me—\nI do not grasp its workings,\nNor do they comprehend my power.\nHow, then, can they benefit me?\n\nTherefore, the household dwells in ease and finds joy,\nThe disciple rejoices and takes delight.\nWhen people harbor utmost sincerity,\nThey treat me as their own child—\nLeaving home and crossing borders,\nThey gather like crowds at a marketplace.\nThey toil in farming and weaving with vigor,\nRest at dusk and rise at dawn,\nTheir movements follow disciplined formation,\nNo one dares act alone,\nSupplying teacher and pupil\nAs if honoring father and mother.\n\nWeighing advantage to claim victory,\nThe enemy rises not.\nNo battle fought, yet all under Heaven submit,\nNo assault launched, yet the feudal lords bow.\nHeaven and Earth shelter and nurture all,\nSun and Moon illuminate and reveal all—\nMajestic and boundless,\nEach content in its own domain.\n\nWhy so?—\nCompassion and mercy set things in motion,\nAligning with Heaven’s intent,\nNot daring to act against its will.\nWhen armies face each other,\nThe merciful prevail.\n\n**My words are easy to understand—**\n**Yet none can know the unknowable.**\n**My actions are simple to follow—**\n**Yet none can emulate the unemulated.**\n\nYet my words have a lineage,\nMy deeds a sovereign principle—\nUnspoken yet inherent,\nNatural yet unforced.\nOnly those who fail to recognize me\nAnd differ from my ways\nDo not comprehend me,\nDo not affirm my truth.\nFew know me—\nCommon folk say, *\"Then you are noble, you alone are true.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage—\nThe wise ruler—\nClad in coarse garments, humble in body,\nYet treasures virtue within, rich in spirit.\n**Pointing to the source:**\nWhat is formless and soundless yet guides all things naturally?\nThe **Dao/Way** and the **Divine**#5.\nWhat is formed and audible yet guides all things naturally?\nEarth and Heaven.\nThe **Divine’s** transformations surge and flow,\nHeaven and Earth speak in silence.\nThe surge transforms all without exception,\nThe silence reveals all without fail.\n**Divine qi**#6 and vitality pass on,\nResponding to each other’s impulses—\nReturning to boundless emptiness,\nExquisitely subtle and wondrous,\nThey rest in nature.\n\nThey lead all things without end.\n\nThus, **spoken words are but tools of expression—**\n**Action is the ruin of authenticity.**\n**Non-action, no words—**\n**This is the apex of achievement**\n**And the key to enduring life.**\n\nTherefore, the Sage speaks of what is unspeakable,\nActs without doing—\nWords to silence words,\nActions to halt actions.\n**The path of ceasing speech:**\nDiscard the heart and mind’s designs,\n**The art of halting action:**\nAbandon human cleverness and wisdom.\nBecome foolish and guileless,\nKnow nothing, desire nothing.\nWithout desire comes stillness,\nStillness brings emptiness,\nEmptiness yields substance,\nSubstance births the **Divine**#7.\nMovement returns to the **Great Primordial**#8,\nStillness to nature—\nPreserve the self, safeguard the realm,\nWealth and honor fade not,\nAll creatures fulfill their aspirations,\nAnd attain lasting life.\n\nThese are words easy to grasp,\nActions simple to follow—\nYet Heaven and Earth cannot fathom them,\nCannot emulate them.\nWhy so?\n\nThe rulers of this world delight in knowledge,\nStrive to please their hearts,\nSee not the Great Dao,\nRecognize not nature—\nThey take action as action,\nSpeak words as words,\nExhausting knowledge to spawn deeds,\nSeeking comfort in their own inclinations,\nYet they deem this as the common way,\nAnd suffer afflictions all their lives—\nTheir essence fades, their emotions shift,\nThey sink deep into confusion and stray far from truth,\nTheir vitality dulls, their spirit unsettles,\nTheir bodies appear solid yet their inner selves are hollow,\nForced silence breeds guilt,\nForced stillness invites calamity.\n\nThus, they look yet do not see,\nThey are told yet do not hear—\nNot from spite, but because they believe otherwise.\nThey refuse loyal counsel,\nNot from spite toward themselves,\nBut because they think no such principle exists,\nAnd so they do not follow it.\n\nThe Sage’s words spring from nature,\nTake root in the **Divine**#9—\nEver dwelling in their opposite#10,\nBetween silence and utterance.\nExquisitely subtle and wondrous,\nThey return to nature—\nBright yet as unseen,\nHeard yet as unheard,\nPermeating yet appearing blocked,\nReaching yet seeming confined.\n\nTheir deeds begin in nature,\nFlow through the **Divine**—\nEver abiding in harmony,\nBetween action and inaction.\n**Pure, still, yielding, weak—**\n**Movement refined, actions delicate—**\n**Simplicity, ease, retreat, and self-effacement**\n**Return to non-action.**\n\nThis is the **source of words, the master of deeds.**\n\nEmptiness unites with the **Dao/Way**,\nSerenity dwells in life,\nTimely harmony secures the realm,\nEstablishing teachings to nurture the people.\n**Nourish with no desire—**\n**Guide with nature—**\n**Bestow with Heaven and Earth—**\n**Grant with mountains and rivers—**\n**Enrich with years and seasons—**\n**Honor with existence—**\n**Protect with no worry—**\n**Ensure with no calamity—**\nWithout desire, nothing is lost,\nWithout joy, nothing is sustained.\nPeople without a ruler,\nA ruler without people—\nPerish through knowledge and cleverness,\nRely on the **Dao/Way**, lean on Heaven—\nAll nations in harmony,\nUnited under one sovereign.\n\nThis is the grandest of undertakings,\nThe most exalted of achievements—\nYet the world deems it otherwise.\nThe **Dao/Way** makes it so,\nLogic knows no deception.\nThe wise are clouded by their own understanding,\nThus they refuse to believe.\n\nThe world cannot know me,\nNot because my **Dao/Way** is insignificant,\nNor because my deeds are shallow,\nNor because the world delights in ruin and evil,\nRejoices in disaster and misfortune—\nHeaven’s nature opposes mine,\nHuman desires diverge from my truth,\nWisdom ensnared by desires\nEndures weakness all its life;\n**Divine qi** does not affirm me,\nHearts and minds do not accept my words.\n\nThus, they cannot see my clarity,\nCannot hear my insight—\nDeep words invite slander,\nGreat deeds invite reproach,\nUnique vision is unused by the world,\nUnheard wisdom shames the people.\nDeeds that align with the **Divine** are not embraced by convention,\nAchievements that match Heaven and Earth please not the masses.\n\nFew know me.\n\n**The ultimate discourse, the greatest words—**\nThey encompass all variations,\nGrasp all directions,\nDivide even the finest distinctions,\nIlluminate the void beyond form and perception—\nBoundless and thorough,\nYet return to **obscurity and ambiguity**#11.\n\nThis is what petty scholars cannot hear,\nAnd narrow-minded folk cannot attain.»\n\nThe lofty wild goose soars all day,\nYet never knows what lies beyond the cosmos.\n\nThose who craft laws and bind themselves to teachings,\nStudy for years, debate a lifetime,\nYet never grasp the vastness of **virtue/power**.\n\nMoreover, there are things even the **Divine** cannot comprehend,\nThings even Heaven and Earth cannot govern—\nHow much more so for those who cling to common doctrines,\nWho fail to perceive the fundamental principles?\n\nThus, what the multitude despises as worthless\nIs what those who attain the **Dao/Way** alone uphold.\nTherefore, I am esteemed.\n\nHence, the Sage knows yet does not act,\nIs capable yet does not assume responsibility,\nPractices benevolence and righteousness yet does not proclaim them,\nIs enlightened yet does not name it so,\nIs steadfast yet does not flaunt it,\nIs towering yet does not take pride—\nWords cannot be heard,\nActions cannot be seen,\nThe heart vast as the sea,\nThe will boundless as the sky,\nAbandoning artifices to establish the **Dao/Way**,\nDiminishing superficial virtues to nurture true nature.\n\nSilent and boundless, none can fathom,\nLuminous yet unseen, none can discern its essence,\nCrumbled yet enduring, alone it stands,\nThin without, thick within,\nHumble in self, lowly in name,\nAbandoning the crowd, departing from convention,\nTaking the **Dao/Way** as constant.\n\nClad in coarse robes yet cradling jade within.\nKnowing yet feigning ignorance—this is the chapter.\n\nThe unknown does not know—this is the Way of returning to the boundless.\nThe known knows not—this is the sickness of mistaking ignorance for wisdom.\n\nOnly the sickly cling to cleverness and profit,\nThus they are not plagued by harm nor enslaved by the crowd.\n\nThe Sage does not fret over non-existence,\nFor fretting over the **Dao/Way**’s unknown is the sickness itself—\nThus they are not troubled by calamity nor ensnared by comparison.\n\n**Chapter on Returning:**\nThe teaching of **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** is naturalness itself.\nThe verification of naturalness is resonance—\nAll things have form and sound,\nTaking and discarding echo with resonance—\nNot only the myriad creatures.\n\nWhen form moves, it does not generate form but generates shadow;\nWhen sound moves, it does not generate sound but generates echo.\nThe non-existent generates the existent without itself existing,\nThe covering generates reversal without itself being covered.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** governs through *wuwei* (non-action),\nYet the knowing are vexed by excessive affairs.\nThe infant thrives through ignorance,\nThe aged decline through overreaching.\n\nFrom this, it is seen:\nFolly is the shape of clever wisdom,\nClever wisdom is the shadow of folly.\n*Wuwei* is the original sound of spontaneous action;\nSpontaneous action is the echo of *wuwei*.\nClever wisdom is the net of chaos,\nAction is the rope of ruin.\n\nFolly, through *wuwei*, is like form and sound—\nThe root, thus able to generate clever wisdom.\nAction, like shadow and echo—\nThe branch, thus bringing disorder and ruin.\n\nHence, the myriad things cannot be harmonized,\nHeaven and Earth cannot be conformed to.\nHarmonizing leads to the loss of harmony,\nConforming leads to the loss of conformity.\nOnly by not harmonizing can harmony be achieved,\nOnly by not conforming can conformity be attained.\n\nSpeaking of clever wisdom’s use,\nChasing traces spawns waves—\nThe principles of harmony and conformity\nAre extinguished with time.\n\nThus, action is not permissible,\nNon-action is permissible.\nHence, the secure do not know danger,\nThe chaotic do not know governance.\n\nLike shadows following forms, there is no escape;\nSeeking shadows without movement yields nothing.\nThus, knowing yet severing knowledge—\nNot constrained by knowing.\nSelf-destruction is its nature,\nThus it is not constrained.\n\nNot using knowing to know—\nAlso not constrained by knowing.\nThough its use is lost,\nIt does not know knowing as use—\nThus both are unconstrained.\n\nTheir unconstrained ways differ,\nYet in not being constrained, they are one.\nBoth do not use knowing—thus one.\n\nYet severing knowledge is for oneself,\nUsing knowledge is for others—\nThus they differ.\n\nTherefore, the Sage cultivates the nature of openness,\nRoams in the realm of profound silence,\nDwells in the land of incapacity,\nEntrusts the body of non-knowing—\nSilent as empty space,\nFleeting as death,\nThe heart scheming for nothing,\nThe will governing nothing,\nYet clarity and insight move,\nIlluminating the four seas,\nDulling the people’s ears and eyes,\nShowing them emptiness—\nKitchens unformed, sounds and colors not aroused,\nKnowledge does not arise, calamities cease.\n\nWithout speech, the world is governed;\nWithout action, the world is transformed.\nThe people bow without rebellion,\nLook up without imitation,\nSincere and upright, each guards their true nature—\nDazed and vast, all fulfill their natural end.\n\nThe dead have no posthumous names,\nThe living have no titles—\nThus they succeed endlessly, numberless as the sands of time.\n\nThrough knowing ignorance, such benefits arise—\nThus called the highest.\n\nThe next level:\nEmotion finds no delight,\nNature no joy,\nThe heart no ease,\nThe will no gain—\nHating ignorance of filial piety,\nSickened by ignorance of fraternal duty,\nNeither dimming **virtue/power** nor recognizing righteousness,\nNo rites or ceremonies,\nGuarding their innate purity—\nLike deer or wild geese,\nNeither in sorrow nor in chaos,\nAs blind, as deaf—\nNo palaces for rulers,\nNo cities for the people,\nNo laws for the land,\nNo shame in the world.\n\nThrough deficient knowing,\nThey perform actions like sickness.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe known knows not—this is the sickness of mistaking ignorance for wisdom.\n\nThe sickly are not sick,\nEntrusting themselves to the **Dao/Way**,\nNeither speaking nor acting,\nYet **virtue/power** and awe arise naturally.\n\nHeaven and Earth in harmony,\nMingled and vast,\nLike turbid waters settling,\nLike a dignified guest arriving—\nAll creatures return to simplicity,\nVanishing into stillness,\nMoving without dismemberment,\nResting without fracture—\nRulers and people flourish together,\nThe world in quietude,\nPerishing in trivial gains,\nYet enjoying great blessings.\n\nSilent governance—\nPlans cannot be plotted,\nMeasurements cannot be taken.\nThe Sage always seems sickly,\nThus not sick—\nAble to align with the **Dao/Way**,\nBeyond calculation or measure.\n\nIf differing from this,\nKnowledge arises and deceit takes form.\n\nHow to demonstrate this?\nWhen **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** decay,\nPurity vanishes,\nStrange things proliferate,\nKnowledge spreads,\nRites and norms emerge,\nRankings and measures are clear—\nThe myriad things have order,\nA hundred affairs have codes.\nBorders are drawn, cities built,\nStates divided into districts and villages.\nNations have loyal ministers,\nFamilies have filial children,\nInner records, outer omissions,\nPaired bodies as companions,\nTaking from one to give to another,\nStriving for mutual enrichment—\nThe strong grow mighty, the weak perish.\nSacrifices to Heaven, Earth, great mountains and rivers,\nEnfeoffments at Tai Mountain,\nPilgrimages to Liangfu—\nGradual traditions, some true, some false.\nThousands of lawsuits decided,\nBranded criminals fill the roads,\nSubjects kill their rulers,\nSons kill their fathers,\nNations fall, families break—\nNumberless.\nThe world reaps the benefits of knowledge,\nYet suffers the guilt of death.\n\nThe knowing of ignorance,\nYet forcing knowledge upon ignorance—\nThis is the true knowing.\n\nFrom this, it is clear:\nSevering knowledge is blessing,\nLoving knowledge is ruin.\n\nThus, even a **virtue/power**-filled ruler,\nChanging resolve and heart,\nGenerating myriad affairs to teach the people,\nPraying and sacrificing for great governance—\nNaturalness will not comply.\n\nIf a **virtue/power**-filled ruler temporarily abandons the **Dao/Way** and indulges desire,\nThen blessing does not become blessing—\nThis is the nature of rites.\n\nIf a fallen ruler discards cleverness and desire,\nSevers all to halt affairs,\nCultivates the **Dao/Way** and practices **virtue/power**,\nAbandons heart and intent, even seeking death—\nTheir form will not obey.\n\nNow the fallen ruler temporarily turns his heart toward the **Dao/Way**,\nThen ruin does not become ruin—\nThus, the form does not obey.\n\nTherefore, the rush and retreat, the abandoning and taking up,\nAre the **Dao/Way** of the Sage-King’s form and sound.\n\nLife and death, prosperity and ruin,\nAre the echoes of rush and retreat.\n\nThe Sage, thus, can move in harmony with Heaven,\nAnd rest in unity with the **Dao/Way**,\nPreserving his body while governing the realm,\nSoaring beyond all doing,\nAt ease within the void of affairs,\nDrawing blessing from the subtlest threads,\nAnd spreading it beyond the four seas.\n\nThe Sage embodies the knowing of ignorance,\nThough it seems like sickness, yet he does all things,\nNever missing the slightest hint—\nThus, he blocks the ruin of petty doing,\nAnd fulfills the greatness of non-doing.\nHence, it is said: *Take blessing from the subtlest threads,*\nAnd spread it beyond the four seas.\n\nPlug the eyes of the sighted,\nSeal the mouths of the knowing,\nStop the ears of the hearing,\nSever the hands of the clever—\nFollow the rhythms of time,\nBow and rise with the harmony.\n\nWithout doing, yet all is accomplished;\nWithout teaching, yet the people are governed.\nGrace extends to fleeing beasts,\nKindness reaches flying birds—\nFor he discards hearing and wisdom,\nAbandons doing and trusts the **Dao/Way**.\n\nBecause he treats sickness as sickness,\nThus he does not fall ill.\nIf he did not treat sickness as sickness,\nThen he would not be correct.\n\nThus, following emotion and desire,\nExhausting the depths of heart and intent,\nMoving to guide Heaven and Earth,\nResting to nurture all things,\nDivine spirit within himself,\nUnseen and unburned—\nWithout descending from his seat,\nAll nations prepare themselves.\nEven if he wished not to perish,\nNature itself would not allow it.\n\nIf one turns away from the **Dao/Way** and follows desire,\nThough he hopes to survive, he must fail—\nFor the strong and violent do not meet their end naturally;\nThis is the inevitable order.\n\nHence, it is said: *Nature itself would not allow it.*\n*Allow* means *halt*.\n\nThe people do not fear great authority—\nIf the people do not fear authority, they easily do wrong—\nThen great authority arrives, detached from its form.\n\nDo not cling to what you possess, for it is low and weak;\nDo not exhaust what you are given, for it is constrained and perilous.\n\nOnly those who do not weary of sweetness’s joy\nWill not weary of enduring hardship.\n\nThus, the Sage says to the ruler:\n*\"Know yourself, but do not reveal yourself—*\n*Then you are not called virtuous.*\n*Love yourself, but do not exalt yourself above the people—*\n*Then you take from that and seek this within yourself.\"*\n\n**Key Principle:**\nThe essence of **Dao** and **virtue/power**,\nThe divine affairs of the numinous,\nThe great harmony of the heart,\nThe intent of Heaven and Earth—\nNo calamity is greater than ruin,\nNo blessing is greater than survival.\nThis is not only the **Dao/Way** of Heaven,\nBut also of all things and beings.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of preserving life\nIs nothing more urgent than nurturing the spirit;\nThe essence of nurturing the spirit\nIs nothing greater than simplicity.\n\nAlways embodying reverence and dread,\nTrembling and quaking—\nLosing the spirit’s guardianship\nStems from indulgence;\nLosing the spirit’s measure\nLies in self-assertion.\n\nThus, the highest reverence is for the **Dao/Way**,\nNext for Heaven,\nThen for Earth,\nThen for humanity,\nThen for oneself.\n\nProsperity and decline, fortune and ruin—\nAll arise from oneself.\nDo not fear what is subtle,\nBut you must fear what is manifest.\n\nDo not ponder small faults,\nOr they will become great offenses.\nSuffering great calamity and deep ruin,\nUntil annihilation—\nReverence and dread must begin at the origin,\nAscending to the formless and soaring.\n\nGuard and be cautious before signs appear,\nThen the **Dao/Way** shines greatly.\nIn action, you attain what you desire;\nIn stillness, you attain what is tranquil.\nBlessing and fortune are profound and subtle,\nLost in boundlessness.\n\nGuard and be cautious before signs appear,\nFear what has not yet been heard—\nHence, it is said: *Reverence and dread at the origin*\nLeads to profound blessing and fortune.\n\nStraight speech seems contrary,\nYet it is clear as if in darkness,\nVast and deep, beyond hearing.\n\nWaiting for fate is within yourself—\nWhat need is there of Heaven?\nGreatest blessing turns to calamity,\nGreatest fortune seems like misfortune.\nWhen the world is drunk and sated,\nNone can perceive it.\n\nThus, the common folk see only what is near,\nHear only what is shallow,\nAnd do not recognize the **Dao/Way** of the profound and mysterious.\nThey are blocked by the subtle and constant,\nSealed from the divine logic,\nExamining the profit of a hair’s breadth,\nYet failing to see the ruin of mountains.\nThey indulge emotion and behavior,\nFearless and uninhibited.\n\nSpeech follows what is so,\nAction follows what is good,\nUsing strength to take what is possible,\nThe heart complying with delusion—\nProud, extravagant, arrogant, and contentious,\nSelf-assertive and self-diminishing.\n\nLoyalty and trust are what they love,\nYet they deceive even their parents,\nPlunder Heaven and Earth,\nDisrespect their sovereign,\nPursuing emotion and desire,\nThus defying the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\n\nHence, they devise clever schemes and false names\nTo replace their true selves,\nBestow favors and spread kindness\nYet invite great ruin,\nFlee blessings beyond Heaven,\nChase calamities across the seas—\nSeeking **virtue/power** and blessing,\nYet cannot obtain them;\nCalamity and disaster pursue,\nWith no escape.\n\nBecause they do not fear great authority,\nGreat authority arrives.\nWhen great authority arrives,\nOnly then do they begin to do good.\n\nAt this point,\n**Dao** and **virtue/power** cannot save,\nHeaven and Earth cannot resolve—\nThis is not Heaven’s fault.\nThey delight in height and excess,\nBear great authority and rely on power,\nLacking dread and reverence,\nSeeking nothing within themselves.\n\nThus, those who dread for their own bodies\nNeed not fear others;\nThose who fear within themselves\nNeed not be controlled by others;\nThose who comply with the small\nNeed not fear the great;\nThose who warn of the near\nNeed not regret the distant.\n\nIf one can self-admonish and self-strengthen,\nBeing cautious each day,\nThen ruin will not come from afar,\nAnd blessing will be near.\n\nThus, one does not despise his station,\nYet resides in it with diligence;\nDoes not slight his position,\nYet enriches his conduct with propriety;\nDoes not weary of lowliness,\nYet transforms his great beginnings;\nDoes not tire of hardship and peril,\nYet severs what leads to it—\nFinding joy in adversity as in success,\nAccepting death as peacefully as longevity.\nEven if he wished to linger,\nHe could not remain long.\n\nNot shunning the bitterness of his station,\nThough low and small, he refines it further,\nThus transforming its great essence—\nIf he finds sweetness in it without wearying,\nThen he will not remain in it long.\n\nHow is this made clear?\nZhuangzi said:\n*The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth*\n*Begins and yet has an end,*\n*Ends and yet returns to beginning.*\n\nWhen yang-qi rests as the hidden dragon,\nIt can melt metal;\nWhen yin-qi is at ease with frost,\nIt can freeze ice;\nWhen wood thrives in the autumn hair’s breadth,\nIt can grow to a hundred fathoms;\nWhen water delights in the trickling stream,\nIt can become the sea;\nWhen birds take joy in the egg’s warmth,\nThey can soar high;\nWhen beasts prepare in the womb’s embrace,\nThey can run far.\n\n「Therefore, the sage’s wisdom is boundless and vast,\nHe can align with Heaven’s **Dao/Way**,\nTransforming and moving with its shifts,\nPiercing through the great constancy—\nYet still he accumulates **virtue/power** in depth,\nReleases his mind’s intentions,\nConceals his keen insight,\nFears the unseen and the formless,\nHides his traces and vanishes his appearance,\nRetreats to emptiness and returns to **玄冥** (Xuanming, the mysterious and dark),\nThough his body weighs as much as Heaven and Earth, he does not exalt himself,\nThough his **virtue/power** surpasses yin and yang, he does not display it.\nThus the sage knows himself yet does not reveal himself.\n\nHe entrusts himself to the humble and few,\nPlacing himself last among the myriad people,\nHis food lacks flavor, his garments lack adornment,\nHis actions are plain yet he dares not indulge his desires.\nHe cherishes himself yet does not esteem himself.\n\nHe upholds the **Dao/Way** and practices **virtue/power**,\nRising and falling with all things,\nNurturing the people as a father,\nMeeting the masses like a sovereign,\nHis **virtue/power** ascending to Heaven,\nHis achievements credited to others,\nThe world renounces him in favor of others,\nHis benevolence deep and enduring—\nThus calamity cannot harm him while misfortune cannot plague him#6,\nFortune cannot escape him while **virtue/power** does not vanish.\n\nNot the **Dao/Way** of harmony with Heaven and Earth,\nNor the **Dao/Way** of partiality toward the world—\nHe guards against the slightest beginnings,\nMaintains loyalty and sincerity in weakness,\nFollows the **Dao/Way** and aligns with Heaven,\nResonates with all things in their natural course,\nFears calamity yet finds joy in it,\nEmbraces ease yet endures hardship,\nSuccess and failure, life and death—\nThese he seeks within himself.\nAbandoning arrogance and excess,\nTaking humility and meekness instead.\n**Courage and daring:**\nIf one dares in courage, he brings slaughter, defeat, and injury;\nIf one dares not in courage, he achieves vitality, joy, and longevity.\nThese two paths teach life and death,\nSometimes beneficial, sometimes harmful—\nA matter of gain or loss, of fortune or woe.\n\nWhat Heaven detests is easily named,\nYet who knows its reasons? None can explain.\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven is both yin and yang,\nIt does not contend yet naturally prevails—\nFollowing the forms of things,\nResponding without words to their sounds,\nSummoning none yet all come of their own accord—\nThings reveal themselves naturally.\nIt is plain yet masterfully strategizes—\nThings disclose their own dispositions.\nThe Heavenly net is vast and boundless,\nFine as though nonexistent yet nothing escapes—\nWide yet nothing is lost, retaining what should not be abandoned#7.\n\n**The principle of alignment:**\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,\nThe logic of life and death,\nHas neither departure nor approach,\nNeither taking nor giving,\nNeither action nor inaction—\nYet all things arise naturally.\nStraight as a plumb line,\nSmooth as water,\nResponding to circumstances and emulating patterns,\nRising with all things in harmony,\nGaining and losing, taking and discarding,\nCompleting tasks from beginning to end,\nDeep or shallow, light or heavy—\nAll things take their own measure,\nDiverse forms and kinds,\nEach returning to its natural state#8.\nLife is the root of death,\nDeath is the origin of life—\nThese two, when contrasted,\nReveal fortune and misfortune.\n\nThus, he who knows life yet not death\nInverts Heaven’s order;\nHe who knows death yet not life\nDefies Earth’s principle.\nHence, joy and anger have their limits,\nLife and death their measures—\nReceiving Heaven’s punishment,\nEnduring Earth’s retribution.\nWhen anger is due yet not expressed,\nHis sons become wolves and his brothers oxen#9;\nWhen battle is called yet not fought,\nHis wives become enemy states and his concubines great bandits#10;\nWhen death is decreed yet not carried out,\nHe invites Heaven’s wrath and is dominated by things;\nWhen joy is owed yet not given,\nHe suffers Heaven’s disaster and meets Earth’s blame;\nWhen life is granted yet not nurtured,\nRulers lose their kingdoms and commoners their lives.\nThus the noble man kills his people as he would his own body,\nGives life to others as he would to himself,\nHolding fast to **virtue/power** and uprightness,\nActing only when necessity compels him.\n\nTo preserve life and ensure the nation’s peace,\nLies in the balance of life and death—\nIf life and death are governed rightly,\nHeaven and Earth will protect him,\nAnd the measure of joy and anger\nWill bring all things to him.\nHence, he is firm yet resolute,\nStrikes deep and with severity,\nRepels evil and nourishes the good,\nDares yet knows restraint.\n\nSkilled in defense and war,\nClear in opening and closing,\nLong in resentment yet swift in retribution,\nAt ease in stillness yet joyful in action,\nBenefiting the nation and the people,\nNot avoiding the strong or mighty,\nHis威令 (威令, awe and authority) shakes the hundred barbarians,\nHis influence sways the borders beyond—\nHe attains half of what is good.\nThis is from daring in courage.\n\nThe meek and weak, fearing and respecting,\nDreading to harm others with words,\nReflecting deeply to grasp far-reaching thoughts,\nConfronting justice yet punishing grudges,\nPursuing longevity and few conflicts,\nAccumulating benevolence through broad and profound deeds.\nHe benefits without harming,\nTo make his goodness known;\nHe gives without taking,\nTo manifest his name;\nHe rewards without punishing,\nTo establish his grace;\nHe grants life without killing,\nTo fulfill his仁 (ren, compassion)—\nHe attains half of what is good.\nThis is from daring not to dare.\n\nIn all these two achievements—\nDaring in courage and daring not to dare—\nTheir strategies diverge yet both strike the mark,\nTheir paths contradict yet both find their purpose—\nOne may turn a thousand chariots into captives,\nAnother may transform an ordinary man into a sovereign.\nThus, things may be nurtured for fortune or for calamity,\nOr slain for fortune or for ruin.\nThese two principles are profound and subtle,\nNone can fully fathom them.\nUnable to grasp them fully,\nThey do not perceive the mysterious and dark’s disposition,\nNor distinguish the divisions of calamity and fortune.\nOnly those who attain the **Dao/Way** comprehend the unseen before it occurs,\nAnd can thus govern its beginnings—\nBeyond the reach of ordinary measures.\nHence it is said that these two principles are profound and subtle,\nNone can fully explore them.\n\nThus, nurturing what Heaven detests,\nHarms what Heaven protects;\nNurturing what Heaven protects,\nHarms what Heaven detests.\nOne reversal, one inversion,\nMay yield **玄德** (Xuanming, mysterious virtue);\nOne inversion, one reversal,\nMay breed **玄贼** (Xuanming, mysterious ruin).\nServe Heaven and Earth as a father,\nAnd your descendants will prosper.\nThus, if you nurture yet the future declines,\nLife was meant to perish;\nIf you slay yet fortune arrives,\nDeath was meant to live;\nIf you slaughter yet blessings follow,\nKilling was meant to bring fortune;\nIf you destroy yet misfortune comes,\nKilling was meant to nurture life.\nWhat Heaven detests, do not dare to preserve;\nWhat Heaven protects, do not dare to slay;\nWhat Heaven diminishes, do not dare to give;\nWhat Heaven benefits, do not dare to take.\nTo give or not to give,\nOnly Heaven decides;\nTo slay or not to slay,\nNo mortal knows.\nThus, daring in courage often leads to harm and defeat,\nDaring not to dare aligns with Heaven’s decree.»\n\n「Thus, the daring that does not dare aligns with Heaven’s decree—\nin action, it harmonizes with the **Dao** of Heaven,\nin stillness, it reaches the **extreme** of Earth.\nWhat Heaven’s heart detests, none can justify.\nWho knows the reason for Heaven’s displeasure?\n\nThe **Dao** of Heaven and Earth:\none **yin** and one **yang**,\ndivides into the four seasons,\nseparates into the five **phases**,\nflows into the ten thousand things,\nrefines into the three luminaries.\n**Yang qi** governs **virtue/power**,\n**yin qi** governs punishment,\nencompassing all beings,\nbreathing life to distant lands,\nmysterious and impartial,\nupright and just.\n\nIt does not favor life for cleverness,\nnor punish killing for skillfulness,\nresponding to all things,\nnever acting alone—\nauspiciousness with auspiciousness,\ncalamity with calamity,\nharming those who do evil,\nrewarding those who do good.\nThus, without action, things arise;\nwithout action, things perish.\nShadows mingle, echoes resonate—\nwithout seeking, things are obtained;\nwithout constraint, things conform;\nwithout scrutiny, things reveal themselves;\nwithout inquiry, things express their nature.\nThis is the **Dao** of Heaven.\n\nHence, without strife, one conquers all;\nwithout words, one responds to all;\nwithout summoning, all come.\nSilent and vast,\nplanning all without effort—\nthis is called conquering without strife,\nresponding without words,\nsummoning without call,\nand planning without speech.\n\nThe **Dao** is woven in **惚恍** (huǎnghuǎng, indistinct yet discernible),\nyet its net is formless—\nsprawling yet boundless,\nfar-reaching yet lingering,\npenetrating without gaps,\nadapting to all things.\nThus, it precedes yet never strays far,\nfollows yet never arrives late,\nacts in stillness yet is inaudible,\nadvances and retreats unseen.\nFrom beginning to end, fortune and misfortune,\nauspiciousness and calamity,\nall return as they ought—\nnone can escape beyond Heaven’s reach.\nHeaven’s net is vast and wide,\nthough sparse, it never misses.\n\nThe people do not fear death—\nthey regard their lives lightly.\nHow can fear of death restrain them?\nIf the people were made to always fear death,\nthey would find peace.\nBut those who act strangely become blessings for others—\nI could seize and execute them,\npunish their deceitful excesses,\nand impose stern laws with trustworthy punishments.\nYet who would dare?\n\nThere are always those who execute punishment—\n*[referring to]* the great ministers.\nAnd those who substitute for them—\n*[referring to]* the sovereign.\nThis is improper—\nthe sovereign should not replace the great ministers in judgment.\nIf the sovereign were to replace the great carpenter in cutting,\nhis hands would soon be injured.\n*[Annotation: \"指归\" (zhǐguī) here may imply a moral or practical conclusion.]*\n\nHuman nature and disposition:\nthe ignorant are faithful and trustworthy,\nthe knowing are shameless and deceitful;\ncontent when fortunate,\nscheming when misfortune strikes;\ndespising death in poverty,\ncherishing life in ease.»\n\n「How does one understand this? Zhuangzi says: The infant is faithful and trustworthy toward its enemies and rivals when it knows nothing, but when it grows strong and gains knowledge, it deceives even its elder brothers and sisters-in-law.\n\nWhen the three armies are in high spirits, they abandon even captured soldiers; beasts in the narrow valleys do not flee from rhinoceroses or tigers. This is not because their nature has changed—it is simply the way of things.\n\nFrom this, we see: if the people’s hearts are not won, their lives and fates are incomplete, then decrees and commands cannot move them. If they are wretched and distressed, they do not fear death lightly, then punishments and penalties cannot terrify them.\n\nThus, rulers who delight in knowledge, burdened by worldly cares and the people’s labor, sacrifice to heaven and earth, ward off calamities and dispel misfortunes, summon goodness and invite blessings, pray to spirits and deities, and manipulate all affairs—ever shifting to please the people—will find that households know kindness, streets abound with virtuous and wise men.\n\nBut if they defy the natural order, rely solely on human hearts, take their own opinions as wisdom, and their own arguments as just—if they abandon proper distinctions, disregard the principles of things, and obstruct the Dao while fostering false praise—then the world will be thrown into great chaos, the common folk will be restless and anxious, labor will be unending, and poverty will breed deceit.\n\nThose who dare to defy will be honored and rewarded, the lighthearted will thrive in ease, the virtuous will suffer in want, those who fear the law will starve in distress, the weak will grow bitter and long for death, while the powerful will revel in their dominion over the king.\n\nThus, when the world rushes toward fame and contests for influence, without regard for right or wrong, splitting hairs and parsing minutiae, and treats death as a return home—then, if stern laws and harsh punishments are imposed, it is like restraining what is easy and controlling what is light. When it comes to this, people no longer fear death—how can one frighten them with it? Such words are senseless.\n\nHence, executions and punishments multiply, yet deceit does not cease; rewards and stipends are given, yet the great ministers do not obey; the common people do not rally, and the feudal lords do not submit. The land is not truly his, nor is the people’s loyalty. Therefore, the sage-ruler guides the people thus: the sovereign does nothing, yet the people have no grievances; the people gain nothing, yet the sovereign loses nothing.\n\nHis achievements are easily won yet hard to lose; his transformations are difficult to resist yet easy to enact; his garments are easily made yet hard to wear out; his food is easily sufficient yet hard to exhaust. Thus, those who crave life and abhor death, who shun excess and despise ruin, all hold their spirits dear and cherish their bodies, so that form can be controlled and influence can be restrained.\n\nPeople fear death and value life—this is their natural state. Hence, even the bold and the wise, those who are open and far-reaching, do not dare to create blessings or wield authority. Thus, laws are established yet unused, rewards are set yet not bestowed.\n\nWhy is this so? Because the sovereign’s weight is as great as heaven and earth, while all other things are as light as feathers. If laws are stern and punishments severe, the wise know not to transgress. Those who alone do not fear, when their crimes are exposed, will be put to death by the officials—who would dare to defy?\n\nTherefore, the Dao of the Emperor-King is to act without interference, to see without gazing, to hear without listening, to scheme without plotting, and to speak without uttering words. Before, behind, left, and right—each has its appointed duty. He relies on their responses to oversee, ensures their success, grants them their aspirations, and accepts their deeds. Titles are bestowed upon worthy lords, stipends given to advancing virtuous men. Those who create blessings will die, those who usurp authority will see their clans destroyed, and all officials will hasten to their duties—leaving the sovereign uninvolved.\n\nEach has its proper role, none may overstep or substitute. When entrusted with what they are capable of, the Great Dao is achieved, all affairs become clear, and the realm stands still in perfect order, conquering all without effort.\n\nIf ministers act as sovereigns, they will lose their own lives; if sovereigns act as ministers, they will surely harm their states.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* and *Virtue/Power* of the True Classic’s *Annotations* [卷之十二] conclude here:\n\n1. *威* [\"威\"] was originally *\"为\"* [\"for\"], corrected according to the *Secret Edition*.\n2. *\"所\"* [\"that which\"] was originally omitted, added according to the *Secret Edition*.\n3. *\"常处\"* [\"constant abode\"] was originally *\"堂处\"* [\"hall abode\"], corrected according to the *Secret Edition*.\n\nThe sovereign’s Dao lies in the unseen, the minister’s in the seen. The sovereign alone holds absolute authority, the ministers alone establish proper names. When the sovereign and ministers are separated, all affairs become clear.\n\nThe division between ruler and subject must never be blurred. Thus, when the sovereign’s position is fixed and the ministers’ duties are clear, all affairs become manifest. The sovereign has his allotted sphere, the ministers their appointed tasks. To discern their proper roles and duties is to ensure none may substitute for another. Each guards his own circle, the Great Dao is then achieved, all affairs become clear, and the realm stands still in perfect order, conquering all without effort.\n\nIf ministers act as sovereigns, they will lose their own lives; if sovereigns act as ministers, they will surely harm their states.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* and *Virtue/Power* of the True Classic’s *Annotations* conclude here.」\n\n「#4

obedience,\nfulfilling their appointed duties,\napproving the good and condemning the evil,\nnever altering truth for name,\nnot slighting their rank,\nnot demeaning their attire—\nthis is how ministers preserve their integrity.\n\nWith humble hearts and earnest simplicity,\npracticing moderation and fortifying resolve,\nconforming to Heaven’s seasons,\nexhausting Earth’s resources,\nwearing clothes suited to their form,\neating to harmonize their stomachs,\nlaboring at dawn and resting at dusk,\nnot despising their dwelling,\nnot wearying of their food—\nthis is how the common folk preserve their lives.\n\nWhen movement and stillness lose harmony, they lose the Dao/Way’s measure;\nWhen plowing and harvesting fall out of season, they lose Heaven’s measure;\nWhen they abandon duty and follow their own will, they lose the sovereign’s measure;\nWhen they fabricate and deceive, they lose the ministers’ measure;\nWhen their clothing and food are ill-suited, they lose the people’s measure.\n\nTo lose the Dao/Way’s measure is to corrupt one’s nature;\nTo lose Heaven’s measure is to bring ruin to one’s family;\nTo lose the sovereign’s measure is to imperil the state;\nTo lose the ministers’ measure is to endanger one’s life;\nTo lose the people’s measure is to forfeit one’s existence.\n\nThe Dao/Way, Heaven and Earth, sovereign and ministers, officials and commoners—\ntheir actions in motion and stillness each have their proper measure.\nTo uphold their measure is to ensure both high and low flourish;\nTo abandon their proper roles is to bring hardship to all.\n\nTo guard one’s measure as it should be is to align with Heaven and Earth,\nto diminish oneself and spare excess is to walk with the Dao/Way.\nIf sacrifices are never ceased,\nfuture generations will prosper.\n\nTo overstep one’s measure and seek excess\nbrings ill fortune upon oneself,\nburdens that accumulate,\nand calamity for future generations.\n\nThis is why ancient sages abandoned their bodies,\nenduring hunger, cold, hardship, and poverty—\nbecause their actions in motion and stillness were unharmonious,\ntheir plowing and harvesting fell out of season,\nthey indulged their emotions and followed their desires,\ntheir cravings for pleasure knew no limit,\nthey exhausted the five flavors in food,\nadorned themselves with elaborate patterns,\npursued extravagance and licentiousness,\nignored the awe of Heaven,\namassed great labor and virtue,\nyet could not restrain their excess.\nTheir consumption of food and clothing\nwas double that of ordinary people.\n\nThus, the people’s hunger stems\nfrom the sovereign’s heavy taxation\nand his failure to uphold his proper measure,\nwhile they emulate his extravagance and waste.\n\nHence, the poor suffer in body,\ntheir misfortunes extend to their descendants,\nso rags are worn thin yet never discarded,\nsimple fare is lacking yet never spurned,\nand the common folk secretly hoard gains while indulging in vice,\npublicly neglecting duty while pursuing private interests.\n\nThose who enrich their families grow wealthy,\nthose who scheme for the state grow poor,\nthe upright die first,\nthe honest suffer hardship and poverty,\ncustoms decay and morals falter,\nwhat is false prevails over truth,\nchaos and disorder thrive,\nvirtuous men retreat in seclusion,\nthe weak and few are oppressed,\nthe strong and powerful dominate,\nthe poor become slaves,\nthe rich act like kings.\n\nFor they indulge in licentious rule and chaotic governance,\ndo not heed the natural order,\ndefy their own nature and yield to desire,\nabandon the Dao/Way and stray from Heaven,\nadorn false knowledge and fabricate schemes,\nall to gratify their own hearts.\n\nThe people are hard to transform\nbecause the sovereign acts unnaturally.\n\nThus, simplicity fades and purity vanishes,\ncrafty schemes multiply,\nnovelties abound daily,\nbeyond count or form,\nflatterers are favored,\ndeceitful men are ennobled,\nministerial stratagems triumph,\nthe sovereign’s true Dao/Way is stifled,\npaths of deceit and oppression are embellished,\ndangers of annihilation and peril arise,\nloyal and upright men are sidelined and grow ever distant,\nwhile cunning deceivers gather in crowds and soar together.\n\nThe wicked do not die,\nthe corrupt are not punished,\npower is established, influence prevails,\ntheir authority shakes the armies—\nwhatever they gaze upon,\nwhatever they will,\ncomes swiftly to their command,\nall for their own preservation,\nyet they all exceed the bounds of the world,\nsome like this, some like that,\nconfused and discontented.\n\nIt is better to perish than to persist,\nbetter to die than to live—\nwith bold resolve and reckless daring,\nglowering eyes fixed upon one another,\nsovereign and ministers conspire,\nfathers and sons plot in secret,\nboiling cauldrons cannot deter them,\nsharp blades cannot stop them.\n\nThe people thus risk their lives for trifling gains,\nseize opportunities in perilous straits,\ndefy heavy prohibitions,\ncharge into deadly blades,\nbrave flying arrows,\nnever heeding their own safety—\nall for the sake of fleeting honor and excessive craving for life.»\n\nThe saying that people lightly risk death is because they crave life excessively. Thus, when they lose wealth or rank, some suffer gut-wrenching sorrow, drive themselves mad, hang themselves, waste their vital essence, abandon their spirit—constantly yearning for death, seizing blades to harm themselves, or plunging into deep waters. Hence, they hold death lightly.\n\nThus, the Way of Nature ever opposes things. The formless lives, the formed dies; those who pursue gain encounter calamity, those who seek fortune meet disaster. They come unsummoned, meet without invitation—I though I would avoid them, yet the world cannot escape. Therefore, the relentless pursuit of life and gain is the root of death, while abandoning form and rejecting gain is the root of life.\n\nThe nameless and lowly suffer no misfortune;\nthe humble and disgraced incur no blame;\ncoarse food and simple broth breed lasting contentment;\nrough cloth and deer-hide garments bring enduring comfort;\nwhen one does not burden the people, peace and ease endure;\nwhen one does not cling to life, longevity follows.\nThis is the way to transcend life.\n\nThus, one who can abandon all selfish divisions, stripping away all desires, lies motionless like a corpse, stands unchanging like a wooden post—neither altered by transformation, nor distinguished by life and death, neither exalted as a sovereign, nor debased as a slave. Only in what one encounters, yielding to the unfolding of Nature, does one neither fear annihilation nor rejoice in life. Then one aligns with the Dao as a person, befriends Heaven and Earth, attains longevity and clear vision, cycles endlessly, and transcends all bounds of wealth and nobility—becoming the marketplace of the world. This surpasses the mere valuing of life.\n\n**On the Nature of Life and Death**\nHuman life is soft and weak, for spirit resides in the body; death is rigid and strong, for spirit departs the body.\nGrass and trees in life are soft and pliable, for yang-qi abides within; in death, they wither and decay, for yang-qi withdraws.\n\nThus, rigidity and strength are the form of death’s followers,\nwhile softness and weakness are the bearing of life’s survivors.\nA strong army cannot overcome its fourfold reversals;\na rigid tree cannot thrive among its kin.\nStrength and grandeur bring ruin—this is the exhaustion of the Way;\nsmallness and weakness bring harmony—this is attaining the mean.\n\n**The Pivot of Return:**\nWith all things it arises together, yet has no form or sound;\nit lacks color or taste, nor does it reek or perfume.\nIt enters and exits without doors, comes and goes without gates—\nabove, it has no stalk; below, no root.\nSerene and still, it never alters, preserving its constancy.\nHarmonious and subtle, its transformations know no bounds.\nIt blends with all things, yet gives birth to the Three—\nthe origin of Heaven and Earth, the ancestral source of yin and yang.\nWhen things exist, it abides; when things perish, it departs.\nUnnameable, it is called *Shenming* [Divine Clarity].\n\nBorn of the Great Void, it thrives in the formless,\nreceiving without decay, bestowing without depletion.\nIn motion, it knows no end; in stillness, it is boundless.\nIt encompasses all without limit, penetrates all without exclusion—\nflowing beyond all things, traversing all that exists.\nHeaven gallops, Earth races, yet cannot overtake it;\nyin strains, yang flees, yet cannot outstrip it.\nEchoes exhaust themselves yet cannot respond;\nshadows dissolve yet cannot resemble it.\nTake from it, yet it is never spent;\ngive to it, yet it is never depleted.\nIt has no partiality in giving or taking,\nno hatred or love—\nit retains softness, dwells in weakness,\nreturning to emptiness.\nAdvancing and retreating, bending and stretching,\nit ever aligns with *virtue/power*,\nleading the Dao, while things grow distant.\nThose who receive much are sage and wise;\nthose who receive little are foolish and dull.\n\nThus, the Divine Clarity and sage wisdom are the eternal masters of life;\nsoftness, weakness, and stillness are the dwelling of Divine Clarity.\nWhen spirit resides in the body, life is soft and weak—\nthis is the abode of Divine Clarity.\n\nWhen Divine Clarity dwells in a person,\nit cannot be removed if in its right place,\nnor can it be retained if lost.\nNeither coercive power nor clever schemes can control it.\nIf one can nurture it, wealth and nobility never fade,\nand one remains forever in high station, growing ever more secure.\n\nThus, at birth, bones are weak, sinews supple,\nblood and qi flow freely,\nthe mind is focused, spirit harmonious,\nthe face radiant, the body luminous,\nmovements graceful, every joint firm—\nday by day, vitality increases, and within months, clarity sharpens.\nWhy? Because spirit resides within.\n\nBut as one ages, bones wither, sinews tighten,\nhair turns white, flesh atrophies,\nfood and drink lose flavor,\nhearing and sight dull,\nstrength and vigor wane daily,\nmovements decline monthly,\nthought grows muddled, choices conflict.\nAt death, the body shrinks, the face hollows, the tongue retreats, the limbs stretch.\nWhy? Because spirit has departed.\nThis is the rigidity of death.\n\nWhen grass and trees first sprout, branches are supple, leaves lush and green,\nabundant and beautiful, soft and harmonious—\nfor yang-qi abides within.\nAs they decline, leaves yellow and wither, colors fade and perish.\nAt death, roots and stems wither, branches grow rigid and hard—\nfor yang-qi has departed.\nThus, grass and trees in life are soft and pliable, in death, withered and brittle.\n\nWhere Divine Clarity resides, the perilous may be secured, the dead revived;\nwhere it departs, the safe may perish, the strong may be slain.\nWhere yang-qi abides, trees may bend and grass may bind;\nwhere it flees, breath may congeal and ice may shatter.\n\nThus, Divine Clarity and yang-qi are the root of life,\nwhile softness and weakness are the medicine for all things.\nHarmony and yielding are the means of longevity,\nthe refuge of Divine Clarity and yang-qi.\n\nAll things follow yang in their yielding softness—\nthus, rigidity and fullness are the likeness of death;\nsoftness and smoothness are the dwelling of life.\nThe rigid and strong are death’s followers;\nthe soft and weak are life’s survivors.\n\nIn human nature, one hates a neighbor’s father for his strength,\nloves a neighbor’s child for his weakness;\nburns withered branches for their hardness,\nadorns with jade and ornaments for their smoothness.\nPeople love the young and hate the old—\nfor life’s vitality lies in their measure.\n\nThus, when there is no sovereign above, the feudal lords encroach upon one another,\ncontending states vie for power, armies are raised and poised to confront—\nthe soft and weak prevail, the rigid and strong are exhausted.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe armies of the strong are not aligned with the Dao of Heaven and Earth;\ntheir foundation is not in harmony and yielding, nor in virtue of compassion and love.\nThey punish the arrogant and violent, rescue the insufficient,\nand break the greedy and the usurping.\n\nThe generals rely on the might of their state and the multitude of their people,\nseeking glory and fame, mimicking the ways of others,\nthus they covet others’ lands and wealth,\ntake joy in slaughter and injury,\nravage ancestral temples and shrines,\nand bring ruin to the people—\nall to display their overwhelming power.\n\nSubmissive and fearful below, they exploit others’ advantages to assert their own will,\nthose who draw near meet ruin, those who serve meet disaster,\ntheir blame and cruelty run counter to human nature,\ntheir slaughter defies the will of Heaven.\n\nIn life, they bring suffering to the world;\nin death, they benefit the world.\nThe many, though weak, unite as one,\nsharing sorrow and plotting together—\nthough they bear the name of strength,\nin truth, they cannot prevail.\n\nThis is what is meant by *\"strong armies do not conquer.\"*\nWhy is this so?\nFor they are bound by poisonous knots—\nHeaven’s Dao does not favor them.\n\nHow can this be made clear?\nIn ancient times, mighty Qin and Chu\nannihilated the feudal lords,\nunited the domains and cities,\ngrew rich in their states,\nand became sovereigns, their power swaying the world,\ntheir might trembling across the seas,\ntheir honors and privileges reaching their peak—\nthey could be called strong indeed.\n\nYet, when they sat at ease, the feudal lords were in distress;\nwhen they stretched their feet, the world trembled in fear;\nwhen they issued commands, Heaven’s heart grieved;\nwhen they took action, the Divine Clarity was disturbed—\ntheir nations fell, their families were ruined,\nand their own lives were cut short.\n\nWhy was this so?\nBecause they abandoned softness and weakness for rigidity and strength.\n\nWhen the divine Han was about to rise,\nthey fled like dragons into hiding,\nyet the people sought them out—\nand they could not escape.\n\nFather Heaven, Mother Earth,\nloving the people as their own children,\nrewarding merit and nurturing virtue,\nteaching those who follow the Dao,\nresponding to enemies and adapting to change,\ntheir strategies vast as rivers and seas—\nthey conquered Qin and extinguished Chu,\nthe world rejoiced in harmony,\nand they were established as sovereigns.\n\nWhy was this so?\nBecause they acted with compassion and humility,\nin accordance with Heaven’s will.\n\nThis is not only true of human affairs—\nit applies to all things.\n\nGreat trees, towering a hundred *rèn* high,\nwith massive trunks and branches,\ntheir heads split through the central gate,\ntheir roots divided by the doorframe—\nthough they bear no fruit,\nthey endure at the lowest level.\n\nYet countless smaller trees,\nstretching their limbs and leaves,\nlush and verdant,\nthrive above them—\nfor their forms are great yet their strength is weak.\nThis is what is meant by *\"strong trees are shared.\"*\n\nThus, the Dao of Divine Clarity,\nthe principle of Heaven and Earth,\ndoes not uphold the small to bear the great,\nnor the light to bear the heavy.\n\nHence, the strong cannot rule as kings,\nnor can the mighty trees dwell above.\nThe strong and mighty reside below;\nthe weak and small dwell above—\nthis is the natural order of things.\nWhen the weak and small dwell above,\nit is the fixed law of Heaven.\n\nThe **Chapter of Heaven’s Dao**:\nHeaven’s Dao is both yin and yang,\nlike a drawn bow with its tension and release.\nThe high are lowered to grow long and strong,\nthe low are raised to begin their life.\nThose with excess are diminished to break fullness,\nthose lacking are supplemented to fill emptiness.\nHeaven’s Dao:\nto diminish excess and balance is constant,\nto supplement deficiency and provide support is to court ruin.\n\nHuman affairs are not so—\nthey cannot be thus practiced.\nThey diminish the deficient, plunder the weak,\nand hoard the excess for the mighty.\nWho can diminish the excess with clear insight,\nand bestow the world’s blessings to all,\nthus ensuring life and harmony together?\nOnly the one who follows the Dao is nameless.\n\nThus, the Sage says of the enlightened king:\n*\"He acts but does not rely on force,\nhe achieves success but does not dwell upon it,\nhe does not seek fame nor fear great calamity.\nHe points the way—*\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth began,\nyin and yang had not yet emerged,\ncold and heat had not yet appeared,\nlight and darkness had not yet formed—\nthere stood a primordial entity,\none turbid, one pure,\nthe pure above, the turbid below,\nharmony in the center.\nWhen these three arose together,\nHeaven and Earth were complete,\nyin and yang intermingled,\nand all things were born.\n\nThose who lose it perish,\nthose who grasp it flourish.\nIn things, harmony is:\nrigid yet never broken,\nsoft yet never obstructed.\nIn Heaven, it is the measure;\non Earth, it is the standard.\nIn yang, it is the compass;\nin yin, it is the square.\nIt does not move without restraint,\nnor does it rest without purpose.\nThings rely on softness and weakness,\nwhile qi depends on firmness and strength—\nin motion, it controls all,\nin stillness, it accommodates all.\n\nThus, harmony is:\nthe application of virtue and power,\nthe support of Divine Clarity,\nthe mechanism of Heaven and Earth,\nthe dwelling of all living things,\nthe essential principle of the ten thousand directions,\nthe repository of nature,\nthe gateway of all blessings,\nthe door to universal fortune.\n\nHence, the wise see it as wisdom,\nthe virtuous see it as virtue—\nthe world clings to it day and night,\nyet none can fully comprehend it.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause its power in nurturing things is subtle,\nand its achievement of affairs is profound.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth’s Dao:\ndoes no harm nor injury,\nits action is non-action—\nit guards with great harmony and rectitude,\nadapting to things with depth and sincerity,\nupholding nothing in vain,\nclaiming nothing for itself—\neach thing fulfills its nature,\nand all things return to their natural state.\n\nHence, the flourishing self-destruct,\nthe stretched self-loosen,\nthe hidden self-reveal,\nthe obscure self-illuminate,\nthe deficient gain support,\nthe excessive are diminished—\nthose who exist will perish,\nthose who live will die,\nright and wrong invert themselves,\nfortune and misfortune are self-taken—\ndiminishment cannot be avoided,\ngain cannot be resisted—\ncalamity does not linger constantly,\nfortune does not remain forever—\neach receives its due share,\nand none can possess both.\n\nThus, the scaly have no fur,\nthe furred have no feathers,\nthe winged have no teeth,\nthe horned have no claws—\nthose seen in the day vanish at night,\nthose gained in the past are lost in the future,\ndouble benefits are rare,\nand never experienced before.\n\nAffairs do not flourish in parallel,\nbenefits do not come in pairs.\nNot too great, nor too small—\nfixed in unity, unchanging—\nonce they reach their fullness,\nthey cannot be resolved.\n\n「Thus, the sun reaches its zenith and then declines,\nthe moon waxes full and then wanes,\nthe seasons shift in their ceaseless change—\none wanes as the other waxes.\n\nBeneath towering peaks, deep valleys must lie;\nwhere great springs flow, fierce waves arise.\nMolten gold and stone harden in frozen ice,\nthe earth’s fissures are shaped by yin and yang—\nthis is the Dao/Way of Heaven:\nwhen yin reaches its extreme, yang ascends,\nwhen yang reaches its extreme, yin descends.\n\nAll craftsmen follow this principle without fail.\n\nNow, the archer’s craft:\nwhen the bow is strung, it both contracts and expands,\nwhen drawn, it both tightens and releases—\nits shape is measured by compass and square,\nits tension guided by the plumb line.\nIf the string is too high and taut, it is slackened;\nif too low and loose, it is pulled upward.\nExcess is trimmed, deficiency is supplemented;\nthe string’s balance is entrusted to its quality,\nthe bow’s harmony to its draw—\nthus, when struck, the bow sends the arrow true.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way is the same:\nhence it is said, *\"It is like drawing a bow.\"*\n\nTo elevate the low and suppress the high—\nthis is the Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth.\nTo act against Heaven’s will to please the people,\nto act against the people’s will to follow the Dao/Way—\nthe virtuous serve as assistants,\nthe sage rules as master.\nHe strives to love with abundance,\nto govern as both left and right hand.\nThe wise occupy high positions,\nthe foolish occupy low ones.\nGreat merit earns high rank,\nminor talents earn low office.\nOutstanding deeds receive meager rewards,\nexhaustive labor yields heavy stipends—\nthis is the Dao/Way of the feudal lords.\n\nThus, the conduct of humanity.\n\nTo deceive the sincere and loyal,\nto insult the faithful and upright,\nto oppress the weak and rob the few,\nto enslave the ignorant and burden the common folk,\nto take from the slack and give to the taut,\nto diminish the small and empower the strong,\nto oppose what is obscure and favor what is manifest—\nthis is the Dao/Way of the many,\nthe so-called *\"supplementing the deficient to serve the excessive.\"*\n\nTo dwell in the small while possessing the great,\nto abide in the dim while holding the bright,\nto stand firm while the weak are subdued,\nto gather strength while the few are scattered,\nto rise above while sinking low—\nthus, the lofty cannot be cut down,\nthe full cannot be shattered,\nthe great cannot be broken,\nthe overflowing cannot be diminished,\nthe rigid cannot be bent,\nthe yielding cannot be blocked,\nthe solitary cannot be controlled,\nthe feeble cannot be seized,\nthe foolish cannot be belittled,\nthe empty cannot be filled—\nHeaven and Earth protect them as their own children,\nthe people sustain them as their own mothers.\nIn harmony with all, they soar with the Dao/Way,\naligned with the Dao/Way, they begin and end with it—\nHeaven and humanity in mutual accord,\nthe divine and the bright as their steadfast guardians—\nthis is the Dao/Way of the *至人* (perfected sage).\n\nThe perfected sage always lacks nothing for himself yet ever has abundance,\nuniting with the Dao/Way to nurture all under Heaven—\nthus, they are called *有道者* (those of the Dao/Way).\n\nTherefore, the sage’s actions:\nno fixed purpose, yet in perfect accord,\ngentleness and weakness as their foundation,\nhidden yet never exhausted,\nhonored yet never ostentatious—\nthey decline titles and reject wealth,\nspare their strength and take nothing extra,\nfill the land yet do not enter it,\nnurture the people yet do not befriend them.\nThey tremble as if they had already lost something,\nthey vigilantly guard as if already guilty—\nwalking the Dao/Way in harmony,\nconstantly befriending all things,\nmastering Heaven’s patterns,\npenetrating Earth’s principles—\nthey achieve success yet do not claim it,\ntheir virtue flows yet they do not hoard it.\nThis is the saying: *\"Do and do not rely upon it; achieve success and do not claim it.\"*\n\nThey flee fame and evade power,\nthe mysterious and dark as their refuge—\nthey extinguish extremes and conceal traces,\nthe formless as their guardian—\nin stillness and solitude, vast as empty space,\nnone can take from or give to them—\nproud yet independent,\naligned with Heaven’s Dao/Way.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThey fear the calamities of the Dao/Way,\nand dare not appear before the virtuous.\n\nThough they possess merits that could overshadow Heaven,\nthey do not wish to be seen—\nthis is the saying: *\"Not wishing to appear before the virtuous,\"*\nthe conduct of sages and wise philosophers.\n\n**Chapter on the Soft and Weak:**\nUnder Heaven, nothing is softer and weaker than water,\nyet it erodes the hard and strong—\nits power is like that of a whetstone or chisel.\nNone can precede water in its formation,\nand nothing can surpass it—\nthis is its unparalleled nature.\n\nWater’s victory over the strong lies in its ability to submerge all things,\nthe yielding overcoming the rigid yet never exhausted—\nall under Heaven know its purpose clearly,\nyet few can act with its scarcity and weakness.\n\nThe sage’s words say:\n*\"The pattern of transmitting the state\"*—\nto endure the state’s filth and shame,\nto bear its disgrace—\nthis is called the ruler of the feudal lords, the *侯伯* (marquis and earl).\nTo endure the state’s misfortunes and calamities,\nto bear its ills—\nthis is called the ruler of all under Heaven, the *帝王* (emperor and king).\nStraight words appear as contrary,\nactions seem to clash with their purpose.\n\nTo pacify great grudges and offenses,\nif the ruler harms the people,\nthere will be even greater resentment toward the virtuous—\nhow can this be considered good?\nThus, the sage says of the *明君* (enlightened ruler):\nthey hold the left contract but do not demand it of others—\nthis is the Dao/Way of nature.\n\nThe virtuous govern through contracts,\nseeking virtue within themselves;\nthe unvirtuous govern through tracks,\ndemanding it from others.\n\nHeaven’s Dao/Way has no favorites—\nit is just and harmonious,\nits virtue always aligning with the good.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoral principles encompass all,\nHeaven and Earth bear them,\nyin and yang transform them,\nthe sun and moon illuminate them—\nall things flourish together,\nin chaotic yet ordered unity,\ntheir rise and fall, existence and demise,\nchanging with the times.\n\nThe rigid accumulate and thus fail,\nthe yielding endure and thus prevail—\nthis is the natural law of all things.\n\nHence, water’s ability to strike stone and pierce metal,\nto topple mountains and breach dikes,\nto flow ceaselessly in cycles of ebb and tide,\nto sink into boundlessness—\nvast and endless,\nfar-reaching with no shore,\nits clarity cannot be obscured,\nits strength cannot be augmented,\nthough murky, it can become pure,\nthough few, it can multiply—\nin peril, it can restore safety,\nin haste, it can bring repose—\nchanging with the times,\nit dies yet is reborn.\n\nIt permeates all things,\nnurtures all forms—\nit bestows without depletion,\nsustains without decay—\nit pours into the four seas yet claims no merit,\nit matches Heaven and Earth yet does nothing extra—\nwithin the minutest spaces, it moves with ease,\nabove the nine wilds, it soars without effort—\nits blessings reach the azure heavens,\nits depths accumulate in the yellow earth—\nit strengthens to support Heaven and Earth,\nit weakens to sink beneath fur and feathers,\nit gathers the sparse to form rivers and seas.\nHigh and low have no fixed order,\nit begins and ends without end—\nadvancing, retreating, bending, stretching—\nthis is the nature of those near the Dao/Way,\nfor its form is soft and weak,\nits actions and stillness await the times,\nit does not set a fixed direction,\nits harmony is smooth and effortless.\n\nThus, all craftsmen,\nthough their works differ in purpose and method,\nrely on water’s power—\nto soften gold and stone,\nto break the hard and bend the rigid,\nto level the low and refine the subtle,\nto release the bound and ease all forms,\nto blend the five flavors,\nto purify foul odors,\nto strike the firm and enter the great—\nnone can do this without water’s aid.»\n\nThe things beneath Heaven have none so soft and weak as water, yet none can surpass it in overcoming the strong.\n\nWhy is this so? All things are skilled in their own ways, yet none can rival it.\n\nThus, water extinguishes fire,\ngrinds and sharpens metal,\nshatters horns and teeth,\nyet harms no tongue or ear.\nIt humbles itself to conquer the proud and violent,\nendures insult to triumph over great grudges—\nall know this, all hear of it,\nyet none act accordingly, for they follow their private desires without end.\n\nWater’s mastery over strength,\nsoftness over hardness—\nall know it, yet none can practice it.\n\nThus, speaking brings ruin,\nsilence brings harm,\nadvancing invites calamity,\nretreating invites blame.\nLabor without virtue,\ntoil without reward—\nbrightness fades into obscurity,\nlong endurance sinks into darkness,\ngreatness turns to smallness,\npreservation leads to ruin.\n\nTherefore, enlightened kings and sage rulers, when inheriting a state,\nmust make solemn vows:\nto bear the nation’s filth,\nto be its sovereign;\nto endure the nation’s misfortunes,\nto be its king of all.\n\nThis is what the sage said.\nWhat is meant by bearing the nation’s filth?\nIt means:\nto eat what the people spit out,\nto wear what the people discard,\nto dwell where the people are sent,\nto find joy in the people’s suffering,\nto strive only in serving the people,\nnever pausing to attend to oneself.\n\nThus, the people entrust them as a father,\nlove them as a mother,\nwilling to be their servants,\nto die with them together.\nTherefore, even in barren lands of cold and stone,\nremote and desolate regions,\nthey turn humiliation into honor,\npreserve their ancestral line,\ntransform calamity into blessing,\nand endure as the people’s lord.\nThis is called bearing the nation’s filth,\nand thus they become the sovereign of the state.\n\nWhat is meant by enduring the nation’s misfortunes?\nIt means:\nto endure what the people despise,\nto bear what the people hate,\nto face the people’s greatest calamities,\nyet not consider it virtue,\nto plan for the nation’s ruin,\nyet not lose Heaven’s favor,\nto consider death,\nyet not lose the people’s blessing—\nHeaven and Earth bow with them,\nall creatures rise and fall with them,\nthey follow east and west,\nattach to south and north.\nWhere they act, ruin follows;\nwhere they scheme, submission comes.\nThe world unites as one domain,\nall turn toward the wind and embrace transformation,\nnone fail to receive its blessings.\n\nThus, they can rectify the crooked and pacify chaos,\nconquer without resistance,\ntransform decadence into simplicity,\nachieve great virtue and boundless renown.\nThis is called enduring the nation’s misfortunes,\nand thus they become the king of all.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause their hearts are soft, their wills weak,\nthey value others above themselves,\nand find ease in humiliation.\n\nThus, upright speech seems contrary,\nyet none can overturn it;\nnear yet seems distant,\nyet none can fathom it;\nseeking it from afar,\nyet none can attain it—\nall lies within oneself.\n\nHow so?\nLuxury lies within oneself,\nyet they appear frugal to others;\nwickedness lies within themselves,\nyet they seek righteousness from the people;\ndisaster is invited by themselves,\nyet they pray for blessings to Heaven—\nHeaven and the spirits show them,\nyet they cannot see;\nthe spirits warn them,\nyet they cannot hear.\n\nAbandoning this, they turn to harmony of heart,\ntheir actions here resonate with Heaven,\nrejecting themselves while blaming others—\nthe world falls into great confusion.\n\nThey rely on clear laws,\nexecute punishments with sincerity,\ntheir words and deeds are trustworthy,\nrewards and punishments are just,\npublic and impartial—\nyet they exceed Heaven’s intent,\nuprightness without deceit—\nyet they lose the people’s hearts.\nWhen punishments and executions are used together,\nevil only grows;\nwhen rewards are deep and gifts heavy,\nchaos only increases.\n\nAt such times,\nthe virtuous are ensnared,\nthe wise fall under law—\nthough they gain reputation and substance,\nhow can it be good?\n\nThis is called pacifying great grudges,\nyet leaving lingering resentment—\nhow can it be called good?\n\nThus, the sage holds the Dao’s token,\ngrasps virtue’s sincerity,\nand unites it within themselves,\nnever demanding it of others.\n\nTherefore, a ruler of virtue,\nwhen they wish to act,\nmust consult Heaven first;\nwhen they wish to proceed,\nmust verify the token’s truth.\nThey seek faults within themselves,\nnever blame the people;\nthey accept calamity upon themselves,\nnever resent others.\nThus, the sage holds the left contract\nand does not demand accountability from others.\n\nTherefore, right and wrong are self-determined,\nblack and white are self-divided—\nbefore they act, the world responds;\nbefore they command, all things comply.\nVirtue governs the contract.\n\nThe unvirtuous,\npursuing their own desires,\nignoring the people’s needs,\nlose governance and invite chaos,\nseek no reflection in themselves,\nyet blame the people’s failures,\nenforce harsh punishments—\nwhen people have faults,\nfamilies bear guilt,\nthe populace seethes with resentment,\nHeaven’s will is unfulfilled,\ntheir nation falls into disorder,\nand future generations suffer.\nThe unvirtuous govern the traces.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth\nmoves with all things,\nneither favoring nor rejecting,\nneither distant nor close—\nresponding in kind, like echo to sound,\nstillness and motion in harmony, like shadow to form,\nneither crooked nor flattering,\nupright as constant—\nevil meets negation,\ngoodness meets passage,\nsoftness and weakness find accord,\nnon-action aligns with harmony.\n\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites,\nyet it always sides with the virtuous—\ntruth is never empty.\n\n**Chapter on Small States and Few People**\nSmall states, few people—\nnarrow and few in number.\n\nLet people have ten or a hundred measures of grain,\nwealth and treasures unused—\nlet them practice frugality.\nLet them value death,\nfind fulfillment in their place—\nlet them not wander far,\nfind contentment in their homeland.\n\nThough they have carriages and boats,\ntheir wealth is unused—\nthe people are simple and unadorned.\nThough they have armor and arms in store,\nthey have no need to display them—\ngreat harmony arises.\n\nLet them use knotted cords for records,\nreturning to ancient simplicity.\nTheir food is plain, without refined flavors;\ntheir clothing is plain, without fine colors;\ntheir customs are convenient, aligned with the Dao;\ntheir dwellings are secure, self-sustaining.\n\nNeighboring states are visible,\nyet each guards their own—\nthe sounds of roosters and dogs are heard,\nyet few are true friends.\nPeople live to old age,\nfulfilling their natural span,\nrarely traveling or visiting others.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nStates vary in size,\nlands in difficulty,\npeople in number,\nwealth in abundance,\nforms in height and low,\npaths in distance,\nstrength in power,\nauthority in weight.\n\nThe great overcome the small,\nthe easy overcome the difficult,\nthe rich overcome the poor,\nthe many overcome the few,\nthe high overcome the low,\nthe near overcome the far,\nthe strong overcome the weak,\nthe light overcome the heavy—\nthis is the natural order of things.\n\nStrength and weakness depend on the general,\nsafety and peril rest with the minister,\ngain and loss lie with the ruler,\nlife and death hinge on the Dao.\n\nHeaven does not always favor,\nthe people do not always dwell in one place—\nthose of virtue gather to them,\nthose without virtue are abandoned—\nthis is the natural Way.\n\nThus, vast lands and numerous people,\nbrave generals and stern rulers,\nare insufficient to ensure strength;\nsturdy armor and seasoned troops,\nhigh walls and deep moats,\nare insufficient to ensure safety;\npersuasive speech and flattering words,\nfalse compliance and fawning,\nare insufficient to earn loyalty;\nceding territory and offering treasures,\nforming alliances or counter-alliances,\ngathering factions and thriving in power,\nare insufficient to ensure survival.\n\nOnly those who embody the Dao\ncan master all things—\nwith virtue profound and grace abundant,\nthey turn the small into the great,\nthe weak into the strong,\nthe light into the heavy,\nthe few into the many.\n\nThus, the virtuous ruler, though in a small state,\nmust necessarily endure;\nthe unvirtuous ruler, though in a great state,\nshall inevitably perish.\n\nTherefore, the ruler of a small state,\nwith narrow lands and few people,\nshallow virtue and light authority,\nunregarded by neighboring lords,\nwhose laws fail to restrain,\nwho lacks natural barriers of hills and rivers,\nnor the protection of allied states,\nisolated and alone among great powers—\nwhose land is barren and unworthy of sacrifice,\nwhose treasures are meager and unworthy of offering,\nwhose generals and ministers do not align,\nwhose people are easily swayed,\nwhose neighbors seek to exploit—\nsuch a state, without the steadfastness of a mountain,\nnor the security of a highland,\ndwells perpetually in the peril of a stacked egg.\n\nYet to attack it would not be tyranny,\nnor would its virtue be excessive—\nfor the small state is the hinge of ruin and the pivot of peace.\n\nThe ruler of a small state, prone to peril and defeat,\nmust cultivate humility and the Dao,\ndaily increasing his virtue—\nthus it is called the hinge of ruin and the pivot of peace.\n\nTherefore, the sage who governs a small state\ntransforms misfortune into fortune,\nconverts danger into security.\n\nLet there be abundance in boats and chariots,\nlet there be stores of armor and arms,\nlet tools and implements be convenient,\nlet food and clothing be plentiful,\nlet cattle and horses multiply,\nlet granaries overflow—\nyet tenfold the wealth of neighboring states,\nto secure the people’s hearts.\n\nThough capable, do not act;\nthough wise, do not scheme;\nlet flavors be simple, unrefined,\nlet kitchens be plain, undecorated;\nsever sensory indulgence, reject ornamentation—\nlet the ruler set the example,\ndrink before eating,\nlabor before resting,\nwear a single layer in summer,\na double layer in winter,\nseeking only harmony and ease,\nnot indulging in fine garments,\nlaboring only for life’s necessities,\nnot for gluttony—\nlet taxes be light and few,\nso the people have surplus strength.\n\nCut off the roots of aggression,\nand let the flow of wealth increase—\nlet customs grow sincere and frugal,\nlet loyalty and sincerity flourish,\nlet abundance seem like scarcity,\nlet capability seem like deficiency.\n\nThis is how the virtuous ruler\nmakes a small state with few people\npossess tenfold wealth yet not use it.\n\nWhy is this so?\n\nEstablish it with the Dao,\nembrace it with virtue,\nshare labor and ease, danger and security,\nwith the people as one.\n\nLet the heart be balanced and harmonious,\nlisten to verify substance,\nspeak with reverence and humility,\nto exalt the spirit,\nlet wisdom and virtue shine,\nto correct errant tendencies—\nthen neighboring states will not stir,\nthe people will be united and content,\ndelighting in life and secure in longevity,\navoiding banditry and crime.\n\nAt such times, without bells and drums,\nall things are sufficient,\nthe people are in harmony,\nand ruler and subjects are in accord.\nAttached to their land and content with life,\nthey die in their native hills and valleys.\nEven if offered a hundredfold gain,\nthey will not abandon their homeland—\nthis is how one makes death precious\nand prevents emigration.\n\nFamilies have boats and chariots,\nyet no need to transport or ride them;\nhouseholds possess armor and arms,\nyet no need to wield or display them.\nThough boats and chariots exist,\nthey are not used;\nthough armor and arms exist,\nthey are not marshaled.\n\nWhy is this?\n\n「Generals and ministers clearly understand the Dao/Way of the ruler,\nthe people diligently till and weave,\naccumulating wealth as their aim.\nWhen the ruler embodies humility and simplicity,\nsoftness and weakness are esteemed,\nloyalty and respect are prized,\nwhile cleverness is held low and labor is valued.\nWith laws clear and customs settled,\nsuperior and inferior mutually safeguard each other,\norders need not be given yet the people comply,\nbattles need not be fought yet enemies tremble.\nThose who seek profit do not debate the difficulty of victory,\nthose who chase fame do not scheme to avoid blame.\n\nThus, the realm stands alone in tranquility,\nthe people undisturbed.\nDiscarding artifice and embracing sincerity,\nthey return to the simplicity of primordial times.\n\nWith knotted cords they mark the seasons,\nin unadorned hearts they speak of truth,\nsimplifying things and refining words—\nfew in speech, few in schemes—\nall in accord with Nature,\neach finding their proper place.\n\nThis is what is called\n*restoring the knotted cords* while using them.\n\nPlain food and coarse gruel,\nlacking flavor yet deemed sweet;\nhomespun cloth and deer-hide garments,\nwithout patterns yet deemed fine.\n\nSweet their food, fine their garments.\nSteep cliffs and perilous paths,\nthough treacherous, bring peaceful repose;\nremote valleys and distant lands,\nthough harsh, are seen as deep virtue;\nharmonious customs and familiar ways,\nadapted to the land’s climate and terrain.\n\nThey delight in their customs,\nrest in their homes.\nWhen the Dao/Way flourishes and virtue abounds,\nharmony extends to widows and orphans,\nboundaries are respected, each guarding their own.\n\nNeighboring states lie in sight,\nyet spirits are unexhausted,\nsouls unbroken,\nlives complete and desires fulfilled.\n\nThe sounds of roosters and dogs reach one another,\npeople gather firewood and vegetables,\nclimb hills to catch sight of kin,\nshare streams and rivers for bathing—\nthough distant, they do not conspire with ruler or subject,\nnor gather in forbidden assemblies.\nEach content with their own,\nfrom birth to old age,\nfrom old age to death,\nwithout passing on authority or engaging in fraternization.\n\nThat the people do not fraternize until death\nis because of the utmost *non-action* (無為),\nand thus human desires are nonexistent.\n\n*Sincere words are not ornate*—\nsincere words are not ornate because they are direct,\nornate words are not sincere because they are flattering.\nThe wise do not indulge in broad knowledge—\n*returning to the root* is their principle.\nThe broad-minded do not attain wisdom—\ntheir pursuits are too manifold.\nThe virtuous do not argue—\n*silent integrity* is their nature.\nThe eloquent do not possess virtue—\nthey adorn speech to deceive.\n\nThus, the Sage does not hoard the Dao/Way—\nits clarity is self-evident.\nWhen it is applied to the people, the Dao/Way is put into practice,\nand the Sage’s own benefit deepens.\nWhen it is fully given to the people, the Dao/Way is transmitted,\nand the Sage’s own benefit overflows.\n\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven is both *yin* and *yang*,\nbeneficial yet not harmful—\nits purpose is to nurture life.\n\nThe Sage’s Dao/Way avoids display and honor,\nacts yet does not contend for merit or fame.\n\n*Returning to the source*:\nThe interplay of emptiness and reality,\npresence and absence,\ncold and heat,\nclarity and obscurity.\nWhen *yin* wanes, *yang* flourishes;\nwhen *yang* flourishes, *yin* wanes.\nIf the root is strong, the branches endure;\nif the branches perish, the root decays.\nThe Dao/Way of Heaven and Earth is the mechanism of transformation.\n\nAll these principles—\nthe gateways to wisdom,\nthe origins of sincerity,\nthe measure of doubt and suspicion,\nthe scales of dazzling display—\nare grasped by observing their roots,\ncultivating their essence,\naligning with Heaven’s intent,\nsupervising by Nature’s law,\nrefining to their core,\nsimplifying to their truth.\nTo discern the near and know the far,\nto observe what is hidden and reveal what is inverted,\nto hear of names and recognize their substance,\nto see beginnings and foresee endings,\nto listen to sounds and perceive forms—\nthus to illustrate gain and loss.\n\nThen this is the *resonance of ten thousand years*,\na shared method for all ages,\nthe visible heart of Heaven and Earth,\nand the complete intent of spirits and deities—\nwhat of human affairs?\n\nThis is the natural order of the world,\nthe common essence of all people.\n\nWhen one harbors the Dao/Way of Nature,\nunderstands the logic of human sentiment,\nholds fast to the primal *造化* (creative transformation),\nand grasps the distinctions of *紀* (order/principle),\nthen harsh words strike the mark,\nplainness harmonizes with virtue—\nthis is called *sincerity*.\n\nThe inferior look up to the superior,\nand the superior depend on this.\nThe source of strength and authority,\nthe origin of commands and threats,\nthe aid of the people,\nthe foundation of success,\nthe basis of power and influence,\nthe rise of titles and renown—\nall stem from here.\n\nThe Dao/Way is plain and unadorned,\nwithout embellishment or taste.\nThus, sincere words are not ornate,\nyet deeds are accomplished and truth is revealed.\n\nSo one voice sings and a thousand voices respond,\none moves and ten thousand follow.\nCrushing mighty foes,\ntrapping great armies,\nrushing into peril like water and fire—\ndying without hesitation,\nyet the people hold no resentment—\nthis is *sincerity*.\n\nThough *sincerity* is not ornate,\nits benefit is profound.\nSweet-talking and persuasive,\nendless flattery and grand promises—\nthis is called *lack of sincerity*.\n\nWhat is *lack of sincerity*?\nWords that do not align with truth—\nthis is *lack of sincerity*.\n\nWhen a person lacks sincerity,\nvirtue and grace cannot be established,\ncommands and threats cannot prevail,\npower and influence cannot shine,\ntitles and renown are unclear.\nBestowing rewards does not inspire obedience,\ninflicting punishments does not deter crime.\nThus, superiors and inferiors do not unite,\nundertakings fail,\nthough one may be noble yet without position,\nhigh yet without followers,\nlonely and isolated,\nthe ancestral altars and states unsettled,\nthe world expecting salvation,\nonly to meet with ruin and punishment—\nthis is the harm of *sweet words*.\n\nSweet words without substance,\nornate yet untrue.\n\n*Reverting to the root and returning to the origin*,\nabandoning superficiality and discarding artifice,\nprimordial and fundamental,\nfew in means yet vast in effect,\none in response yet encompassing all,\nrefining to control the elaborate,\nsimplifying to uphold the singular—\nthis is called *limited knowledge*.\n\n*Limited knowledge* thus enables wisdom.\nThe wise do not indulge in broad knowledge.\n\nWhat is *wisdom*?\nTo grasp human sentiment and penetrate divine insight—\nthis is *wisdom*.\nThe wise are the safeguards of the body,\nthe instruments for unifying the realm.\nThe superior’s reliance,\nthe inferior’s attachment,\nthe path to Heaven’s guidance,\nthe road to the Dao/Way’s truth.\n\nThus, they encompass the grand scope of safety and peril,\nhold the utmost keys to order and chaos,\nso that all within the seas are loyal and exert their utmost,\ndividing duties and fulfilling their roles,\nto bring peace to their superiors.\nPower and influence flow freely,\nauthority and virtue flourish greatly—\nthis is *wisdom*.\n\nThough the wise do not indulge in broad knowledge,\ntheir achievements are profound—\nas it is said: *Know one thing, and all ten thousand things are known*.\n\nThe mind perceives myriad details,\nthe eyes survey human affairs,\nyet without exhaustive limits—\nwhen ministers scatter in confusion,\nthis is called *broad knowledge*.\n\n*Broad knowledge* thus leads to ignorance.\nThe broad-minded do not attain wisdom.\n\nWhat is *ignorance*?\nTo doubt Heaven’s Dao/Way,\nto suspect human affairs—\nthis is *ignorance*.\nThe ignorant,\ncontent in ease and pleasure,\ninternally consumed by endless thoughts,\nexternally driven by endless desires,\nboth loathe and hate,\neasily lured to life,\neasily coerced to death.»\n\nThe one who perceives the strange and is moved,\nwho fears danger and recoils,\nwho dazzles with superficial displays,\nwho deceives with shifting words and times,\nwho opposes what is open and rejects what is clear—\nsuch a one falls into ruin and constraint,\nwhose actions neighbor calamity,\nwhose stillness borders disaster,\nwhose ancestral temples tremble in peril,\nwhose people scatter and depart—\nthis is *broad knowledge*.\n\nThis is the fate of the broad-minded who do not know.\n\nWhen one is widely informed and open-minded,\nyet speaks haltingly and is slow of tongue,\nthis is called *not eloquent*.\n\nWhen one is drawn and drawn again, yet succeeds,\nwhen one remains silent yet is trusted—\nthus one achieves *virtue*.\n\nThe virtuous, though not eloquent, achieve virtue.\n\nWhat is *virtue*?\nWhen actions align with Heaven’s will,\nwhen stillness attunes to Earth’s intent,\nwhen words flow without obstruction,\nwhen silence brings no harm—\nthis is *virtue*.\n\n*Virtue* is the foundation of the noble,\nthe pinnacle of all conduct,\nthe convergence of auspiciousness,\nthe path of boundless blessings,\nendless yet unexhausted,\nused yet never depleted—\nunaltered by ten thousand kings,\nunchanged by diverse customs,\ngranted by Heaven and Earth,\nenhanced by the numinous.\n\nThus, above it harmonizes with Heaven,\nbelow it harmonizes with humanity—\nthe origin of governance,\nthe eternal principle of affairs,\nthe fulfillment of all things,\nthe sheltering of all life.\nWhen the world reveres and follows it without end,\nthis is *virtue*.\n\nThough the virtuous may not be eloquent,\nthey possess such achievements.\n\nNot recognizing the fundamental source,\nnot perceiving the root origin,\ndefaming Heaven and Earth,\ndefaming humanity and spirits,\ntwisting words and altering intent—\nthis is called *eloquence*.\n\nClinging to suspicion, treading in doubt,\nfollowing desire while acting recklessly,\nprizing fine words and empty rhetoric—\nthus *vice* is born.\n\nThe eloquent are not virtuous.\n\nWhat is *vice*?\nWhen actions defy Heaven’s will,\nwhen stillness contradicts Earth’s intent,\nwhen words harm humanity and spirits—\nthis is *vice*.\n\nThose of vice\ndivide the Dao and separate virtue,\ndilute purity and corrupt sincerity,\nalter and embellish speech,\nlean on pretense while claiming benevolence,\nfabricate omens and signs,\nlinking Earth and Heaven,\ninvoking masters and beasts—\nthough revered by the world,\nthey invert meaning and conceal truth,\nfleeing substance for mere names,\ndazzling others while remaining empty,\nbewildering all without foundation,\nabandoning truth for deceit,\nstriving to deceive the sovereign.\n\nAdorning speech to please superiors,\nforming factions to sway the ruler’s heart,\nexposing the traces of favoritism,\nsealing the path of loyalty and rectitude,\nemploying flattery to tilt the state’s authority—\nthus they nurture violence and foster great deceit.\nThe world speaks ill, the age grows corrupt,\nthe ruler grows dim-witted,\nobstruction and stagnation lead to peril and ruin—\nthis is *eloquence*.\n\nThough eloquence is not virtuous,\nits harm is thus manifest.\n\nTherefore, the Sage guards against its beginnings,\ncuts it off before it sprouts,\nrejects eloquence and knowledge,\ndiscards artifice and speech,\nembracing emptiness, stillness, softness, and weakness,\nmysterious silence, undyed truth,\nconcealing wisdom and virtue,\nguiding all by naturalness.\n\nRight and wrong, black and white,\nare as clear as sun and moon;\nsame and different, true and false,\nare as vast as Earth and Heaven.\nEmpty yet boundless, transforming with all things—\nthis is the Sage’s non-accumulation.\n\nActing without action,\nharmonizing with all things,\nnurturing yet never full,\ndispersing yet never exhausted—\nencompassing all directions.\n\nThe broad-minded ponder deeply,\nyet see no thread;\nthe eloquent plan far ahead,\nyet hear no beginning.\nExtending without bending,\ntransforming without end,\nreturning to their start—\ngreat clarity like darkness.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses;\nthe more one exhausts for others, the brighter one becomes.\nThe more one nourishes others, the longer one lives;\nthe more one teaches others, the greater one’s gain.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one has;\nthe more one shares with others, the more one accumulates.\n\nBoth bright and dark,\ndark yet again bright—\nthis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\nBeneficial yet causing no harm,\naligned with Heaven and Earth,\ngiving life yet never killing,\ncommuning with the numinous.\n\nEstablishing virtue and flowing blessings,\never abiding in radiant honor,\nyielding eloquence to let blessings return to namelessness,\nacting yet not relying—\nmoving with the Dao.\n\nThough Heaven’s Dao is beneficial yet causes no harm,\nthe Sage acts yet does not contend.\n\nThough Heaven and humanity differ,\ntheir benefits are the same.\nThus, aligning with Heaven’s Dao,\nI have no separation.\n\n---\n\n**Dao/Way that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao/Way;**\n**Name that can be named is not the eternal Name.**\n**The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth,**\n**The Named is the mother of all things.**\n\nThus, **when one always lacks desire, one may perceive its subtlety;**\n**when one always has desire, one may perceive its peril.**\n\nThese two—though issuing from the same source yet bearing different names—\nare both called **Mysterious/Profound (Xuan)**.\n**Mysterious/Profound beyond measure,**\nthe gateway to all wonders.\n\n**The Supreme Sage’s manifestation:**\nNone is loftier than **Dao/Virtue**,\nNone is grander than **Divine Clarity (Shenming)**,\nNone is vast as **Great Harmony (Taihe)**,\nNone is exalted as **Heaven and Earth**,\nNone is more intimate than **Yin and Yang**,\nNone is more luminous than the **Great Sage (Dasheng)**.\n\n**Dao/Virtue** is that which can be spoken of yet cannot be exhaustively explained;\n**Divine Clarity (Shenming)** is that which can be preserved yet cannot be fully articulated;\n**Great Harmony (Taihe)** is that which can be embodied yet cannot be transformed;\n**Heaven and Earth** are that which can be followed yet cannot be proclaimed;\n**Yin and Yang** are that which can be utilized yet cannot be transmitted;\nThe **Great Sage (Dasheng)** is that which can be observed yet cannot be described.\n\nHence, **what can be measured is known, yet few know its limits;**\n**what can be understood is shallow, yet few act upon its depths.**\n\nThe **most multitudinous of the multitudinous cannot be counted,**\nthe **most vast of the vast cannot be measured;**\n**subtle and profound, exhausting principles—**\nthis is beyond the reach of mere wisdom.\n**The utmost fulfillment—**\nthis cannot be attained through striving.\nBetween **Heaven and Earth**, calamities and chaos\ncannot be overcome by human schemes.\n\nThus, **Dao/Way that cannot be spoken of is the eternal Dao/Way,**\n**Virtue/Power that cannot be named is the eternal Virtue/Power—**\nthe origin of governance.\n**Name that cannot be named,**\n**achieving merit without ostentation—**\nthe root of transformation.\n\nTherefore, **when rulers act,**\nthe people crave desires,\n**abandoning purity and forsaking sincerity,**\n**refining yet becoming coarse,**\n**opening their ears and eyes,**\n**enticing them with sounds and colors,**\n**indulging them with the five flavors,**\n**pleasing them with merit and reward,**\n**guiding them with rites and propriety,**\nthe people are like those awakening from sleep,\nemerging from a dark chamber,\nascending hills to gaze upon the eight directions,\nbeholding the **Big Dipper (Shenchen)** and **constellations (Cen)** to see the sun and moon.\n\nThus, **transformation can be articulated,**\n**virtue can be enumerated,**\n**merit can be recounted,**\n**and names can be distinguished.**\n\nHence, **knowing yet flowing unrestrained,**\n**evil and falsehood arise;**\n**Dao/Virtue is obstructed,**\n**Divine Clarity is severed;**\n**a hundred flaws sprout,**\n**Great Harmony is exhausted.**\n\nThe people wander in confusion, lost in the realm of right and wrong,\n**losing their natural rhythms.**\n**Emotions shift with the utmost transformations,**\n**entangled with all things;**\n**their faces grow wan and dark,**\n**their hearts filled with sorrow and woe;**\n**they do not find peace in life,**\n**nor joy in their customs;**\n**they lose their Heaven-ordained years,**\n**all harmed by violence and tyranny.**\n\nThus, **sovereign and subject regard each other with anxious scheming,**\n**father and child cling to one another with yearning,**\n**brothers fret over one another with melancholy,**\n**the common folk tremble in fear and shrink their bodies.**\n\n**Shrinking their bodies yet clinging together,**\ndeath comes swiftly—\nthis is the source of calamity and woe.\n**Clinging with yearning,**\n**fretting with melancholy,**\n**nighttime vigil and morning inquiry,**\n**words of distress and faces of anguish—**\nthis is the cause of untimely injury.\n\n**When subjects behold their rulers,**\n**their complexions lack composure,**\n**they hurry in haste and bow with exertion,**\n**shoulders hunched, elbows pressed,**\n**prostrating themselves in obeisance,**\n**crawling forward in submission—**\nthis is **not the way of true kinship.**\n\nThus, **Dao/Way that can be spoken of is Dao/Virtue made manifest, yet not the natural Way;**\n**Name that can be named is fame and merit displayed, yet not the innate Truth.**\n\n**(II)**\nHaving a name is not the Dao;\nBeing without a name is not the Dao.\nHaving action is not the Dao;\nBeing without action is not the Dao.\nWithout a name yet encompassing all names,\nWithout action yet accomplishing all deeds.\n\n**(III)**\nWithout name, without trace,\nMerging with the Divine,\nThe world relies upon it,\nYet none know its source—\nTransforming from the Void,\nIt is the origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**(IV)**\nThose with names who embody transformation\nFollow the Dao and virtue,\nRevere the numinous,\nEmulate Great Harmony,\nConform to Heaven and Earth,\nThus becoming the Mother of all things.\n\n**(V)**\nThe desireless one gazes beyond expectation;\nObserving its subtlety,\nThey attain the **Pure and Bright** [太清].\n\n**(VI)**\nThe heart like metal and stone,\nThe form like withered wood,\nSilent in seclusion,\nWith resolve as steadfast as a colt—\nSuch is the desireless one.\nRestoring the root of life and essence.\n\nYet those with desires\nChase after transient things,\nLosing the path of ease,\nSeeing only the narrow confines,\nLost and unable to return,\nThey squander their true essence.\n\nWhen all know beauty as beauty,\nThen ugliness arises;\nAll know goodness as goodness,\nThen not-goodness arises.\n\nThus, being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low depend on each other,\nSounds harmonize with tones,\nBefore and after follow in sequence.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without action,\nTeaches without speech,\nYet all things arise without resistance—\nCreates without possession,\nActs without reliance,\nAccomplishes without claiming.\nBecause they do not claim,\nTheir power does not depart.\n\n---\n\n**(VII)**\nHuman cleverness can be restrained but not dispersed,\nHuman desires can be countered but not indulged.\nAdorning one’s appearance harms one’s nature;\nIndulging desires diminishes one’s vitality.\nWhat the world calls \"beautiful\" and \"good\"\nIs not the utmost beauty or goodness.\nFor the utmost beauty is not seen by the world,\nThe utmost goodness is not known by the world.\n\n---\n\n**(VIII)**\nWithout being, one cannot perceive having;\nWithout having, one cannot comprehend non-being.\nWithout difficulty, one cannot know ease;\nWithout ease, one cannot grasp difficulty.\nWithout long, one cannot know short;\nWithout short, one cannot know long.\nWithout mountains, one cannot know valleys;\nWithout valleys, one cannot know mountains.\nWithout tones, one cannot discern sounds;\nWithout sounds, one cannot recognize tones.\nWithout before, one cannot know after;\nWithout after, one cannot know before.\n\nAll these pairs—\nHeaven and Earth’s proof,\nNature’s seal—\nAre laid out in plain sight, yet some deny them,\nAffirming or negating in sequence,\nReversing at their end.\nThe divine cannot evade them,\nYin and Yang cannot defy them.\n\nFrom this, it is clear:\nThe affairs of the Sage-King cannot be forced by action.\n\n---\n\n**(IX)**\nThe radiant does not endure,\nThe obscure does not persist.\nHonored splendor flourishes in mid-spring,\nYet wild greens and millet thrive at autumnal equinox.\nOn the winter solstice, all things grow lush;\nOn the summer solstice, all things sigh in sorrow.\n\n---\n\n**(X)**\nOnly those who dare not rest complacently\nAnd continually cultivate their virtue\nForget their deeds while their virtue remains—\nThus they do not claim yet do not lose it.\nTheir transformation aligns with the Dao,\nThey do not expect reward,\nTheir virtue equals Heaven’s,\nThey do not seek repayment,\nHiding their deeds, evading fame,\nDeep in the mysterious realm.\nThough they do not claim,\nTheir virtue does not depart.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter: Not Valuing the Skilled**\n\nDo not value the skilled,\nSo the people do not compete;\nDo not treasure rare goods,\nSo the people do not steal;\nDo not display what is desirable,\nSo the people’s hearts remain undisturbed.\n\nThus, the Sage’s governance:\nEmpties their minds, fills their bellies;\nWeakens their ambitions, strengthens their bones.\nAlways keep the people without knowledge, without desire,\nSo even the wise dare not act.\n\nAct with *wuwei*,\nAnd nothing remains untended.\n\n---\n\n**(XI)**\nWhen the world extols rites and morality,\nPeople compete, yet fall short—\nThen hypocrisy arises.\n\n---\n\n**(XII)**\nThose with abundant virtue rule,\nThose with meager virtue serve.\nThe worthy are rare—one in ten thousand,\nThe Sage appears not every age.\n\n---\n\n**(XIII)**\nAs when a slow horse and a swift steed race on level ground,\nOr a wild goose and a partridge fly in the blue sky—\nThen the worthy and unworthy become clear.\n\n---\n\n**(XIV)**\nHoarding jewels and jade makes people seek them,\nYet scarcity breeds theft.\nDisplaying music and dance delights people,\nYet excess leads to licentiousness.\n\n---\n\n**(XV)**\nIf the world does not value the skilled,\nThe people do not vie for them—\nNo vying, no strife, no chaos.\nIf the world does not treasure goods,\nThe people do not covet—\nNo coveting, no theft.\nIf the world abandons music and dance,\nThe people feel no joy—\nNo joy, no pleasure, no licentiousness.\nThis is the natural order.\n\n---\n\n**(XVI)**\nEmpty the mind, calm the breath,\nFocus the essence, gather the spirit.\nSilent and without action,\nSerene and without governance.\n\n---\n\n**(XVII)**\nOffer no titles or rewards,\nYet filial piety arises naturally;\nImpose no punishments,\nYet deceit ceases on its own.\nReturn to the true, restore the simple,\nRevert to the origin.\nThe ruler acts with *wuwei*,\nHeaven and humanity interact effortlessly;\nSoaring in natural harmony,\nAll things govern themselves.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter: The Dao’s Pervasiveness**\n\nThe Dao is boundless yet can be used without exhaustion—\nDeep, like the origin of all things.\nIt dulls the sharp,\nUnravels the tangled,\nBlends its radiance,\nAligns with the dust.\nIt sinks like the unseen—\nI do not know whose child it is,\nYet it precedes the Sovereign.\n\n---\n\n**(XVIII)**\nThe Dao is supremely void,\nThus its action is supremely unrestrained.\nVirtue is supremely without,\nThus its action is supremely harmonious.\nAll things receive it—\nNone escape its unrestrained, harmonious flow.\n\nThe application of Dao and virtue is the constant of the numinous,\nThe path followed by Heaven and Earth, the principle revered by yin and yang.\n\n**(XIX)**\nThat which is supremely void is not void,\nThat which is supremely harmonious is not harmonious.\nOnly by not striving for voidness and harmony\nDoes one attain true voidness and harmony.\nVoidness takes emptiness as its dwelling;\nHarmony takes *wuwei* as its home.\nTo be able to empty and to be without,\nIs to have surplus voidness;\nTo be able to be without and to empty,\nIs to always align with harmony.\n\n**(XX)**\nTo have resolve yet no sharpness,\nTo have intent yet no scheming,\nTo devise what is not devised,\nTo plan what is not planned.\n\n---\n**Chapter: Heaven and Earth’s Impartiality**\nHeaven and Earth are not benevolent,\nYet they treat all things as sacred offerings;\nThe Sage is not benevolent,\nYet he treats the people as sacred offerings.\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like a bellows?\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever producing.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion;\nBetter to guard the center.\n\n---\n**(XXI)**\nHeaven is high and clear,\nEarth is deep and tranquil;\nYin and yang intermingle,\nHarmonious *qi* flows freely,\nSerene and without contrivance—\nAll things arise spontaneously.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not incline their hearts or shift their intentions,\nExhaust their spirits, or labor in affairs.\nWith sorrowful yearning, they bestow love and profit,\nSpread kindness and abundance,\nAnd yet complete all things without effort.\n\nThe enlightened ruler and sage,\nUpholding Dao and harmony,\nRemains clear and tranquil, unchanging,\nAdapting with singular transformation,\nReaching subtly and silently,\nConforming to Dao’s manner—\nThe world responds,\nAll things transform naturally.\n\nThe Sage does not exhaust his wisdom or abilities,\nAgitate his mind or unsettle his resolve,\nDrain his essence or weary his spirit,\nCease from contemplation or fret in distraction,\nYet benevolence arises from action,\nAnd he governs myriad lives without contrivance.\n\n---\n**(XXII)**\nIf Heaven and Earth abandon emptiness for love and profit,\nTheir transformations falter,\nThings do not flourish fully.\nIf the Sage abandons emptiness for love and profit,\nHis virtue does not spread universally,\nThe realm does not unite,\nHis grace does not reach deeply,\nHis deeds do not complete fully.\n\nWhy?\nThe art of transforming through love has limits,\nYet the myriad things’ dependence on transformation is boundless.\nTo wield a limited measure against an endless demand\nIs like trying to replenish a dried river with tears.\n\n---\n**(XXIII)**\nWhen lice and fleas move upon the hair,\nSleep becomes restless;\nWhen mosquitoes and gnats cling to the skin,\nThe spirit grows agitated, thought obstructed;\nWhen stung by wasps or hornets,\nThe heart is pierced with pain;\nEven without harm to ears and eyes,\nAll limbs grow useless.\n\n---\n**(XXIV)**\nHeaven and Earth speak not,\nYet through their boundless emptiness,\nThey attain the harmony of all things,\nAnd bring forth without end.\nThe Sage speaks not,\nBut his laws are void yet all things conform to them.\n\nThe prison of Heaven is vast yet holds no restraint,\nThe spirits and gods are tranquil yet act not.\nThe world drifts in ease,\nIgnorant yet unknowing, yet great harmony prevails.\n\n---\n**(XXV)**\nWords spoken invite calamity,\nWords lost bring death to the self.\n\n---\n**Chapter: \"The Valley Spirit Never Dies\"**\nThe Valley Spirit never dies,\nThis is called the Mysterious Feminine.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Feminine,\nThis is called the root of Heaven and Earth.\nEndless yet as if it exists,\nUsed without depletion.\n\n---\n**(XXVI)**\nThe Dao of Great Harmony—subtle *qi*,\nThings born from it are divine.\nEmptiness and voidness are its home,\nStillness and solitude its constant.\nComing and going have no opening,\nForward and backward have no obstruction.\nIn motion, nothing is not accomplished,\nIn stillness, nothing is not formed.\nTransforming yet not transforming,\nGiving birth yet not giving birth.\n\n---\n**(XXVII)**\nThe Feminine, though yielding and soft,\nCan give birth.\nThe Mysterious, though deep and distant,\nIs unseen.\nThough it bears all things like a mother,\nNone can obscure its form.\n\n---\n**(XXVIII)**\nThe Dao of Great Harmony gives birth yet does not die,\nBegins yet does not end.\nIt opens and guides the divine and enlightened,\nAs the root and origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\n---\n**(XXIX)**\nMotion and stillness are profound and wondrous,\nAs if nonexistent, as if existing.\nIt accomplishes things and fulfills affairs,\nIn nothing does it fail.\nShining yet not extinguished,\nUsed without depletion—\nFor its birth is not born,\nIts form is without shape.\n\n---\n**Chapter: \"Heaven and Earth Endure Long\"**\nHeaven and Earth endure long.\nHeaven and Earth endure long because they do not generate themselves,\nThus they endure long in generating.\nTherefore the Sage places his self last, yet his self is first,\nSets his self aside, yet his self is preserved.\nIs this not because he has no private desires?\nThus he can fulfill his private desires.\n\n---\n**(XXX)**\nThe Sage’s awe shakes the eight directions,\nHis wisdom penetrates the four quarters.\nHe entrusts his deliberations to desirelessness,\nReturns his plans to non-action.\nHe humbles himself to honor Heaven,\nSets himself aside to benefit the people—\nThus he accomplishes without acting,\nCommands without speaking,\nAnd the people willingly serve him.\n\nTherefore, he places others first and reverses his own self to conform to the Dao,\nSets himself aside to benefit the people—\nHis deeds are vast yet unseen,\nHis virtue is high yet unheard.\nHis transformation flows with the divine and enlightened,\nHis longevity aligns with the mountains and rivers—\nThus he endures.\n\n---\n**Chapter: \"The Supreme Good is Like Water\"**\nThe supreme good is like water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend,\nDwells where people revile it—\nThus it approaches the Dao.\nResiding, it is good as Earth,\nIn heart, it is good as the depths,\nIn giving, it is good in kindness,\nIn speech, it is good in trust,\nIn governance, it is good in rectitude,\nIn action, it is good in capability,\nIn timing, it is good in motion.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nIt has no grievances.\n\n---\n**(XXXI)**\nMan, in body soft yet spirit weak,\nDescends from heights to lows,\nEndures humiliation like Earth,\nHolds filth like the sea,\nHis words conform to the hearts of others,\nHis self is last among people.\nWhere people revile, he alone abides,\nSerene as if heartless,\nDrifting as if selfless,\nEver-changing yet constant—\nFlowing with the Dao.\nTo relinquish the self and follow nature,\nNone surpasses water.\nEmperors embody it, using it to govern.\nIts virtue is subtle and profound—\nWhat grievances could there be?\n\n---\n**Chapter: \"Hold and It Will Be Full\"**\nHold and it will be full,\nYet not as good as letting it go.\nGrasp and it will slip away,\nYet cannot be long preserved.\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them.\nRiches and honor bring arrogance,\nYet invite one’s own doom.\nWhen deeds are accomplished, withdraw the self—\nThis is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n---\n**(XXXII)**\nPursuing wealth and honor in times of abundance,\nOne accumulates fortune and goods—\nThe heavier the goods, the more the divine and enlightened are drained.\nWealth and goods piled up bring calamity and doom—\nBetter than having fullness and stopping.\n\n---\n**(XXXIII)**\nTo sharpen the heart and focus the will,\nTo strategize and plot—\nWisdom and ability bring rank and honor,\nFame and influence advance the self.\nThe divine departs,\nHow can peace be long preserved?\n\n---\n**(XXXIV)**\nRiches and honor to me,\nAre like ascending a mountain to gaze afar.\nFame and power to me,\nAre like a fleeting bolt of lightning.\n\n---\n**(XXXV)**\nGold and jade compared to the self,\nFame and power compared to the divine—\nLike ice and charcoal,\nTheir essences cannot coexist.\nThus fame is the defilement of the divine,\nProfit is the harm to the self.\nNurturing the divine’s defilement,\nAccumulating the self’s harm—\nIt diminishes what I have accomplished,\nAnd increases what I have failed.\nGaining it is deemed as profit,\nLosing it is deemed as harm—\nThen one’s thoughts grow muddled,\nAnd inclinations perverse.\n\n---\n**(XXXVI)**\nWealth that benefits me harms my divine,\nFame that gives me birth destroys my self.\nCalamity arises from within me,\nNot from others.\nFortune arises from within me,\nNot from Heaven.\n\n---\n**(XXXVII)**\nRiches and honor without arrogance,\nEasy to say, yet hard to practice.\nThe higher the self’s station,\nThe more distant the will must be.\n\nBut when one is wealthy and noble yet remains arrogant,\nIt is like a torch seeking fire—\nThe brighter the torch, the more swiftly it burns away;\nCan one not be cautious?\n\n---\n**(Chapter XXXVIII: *Nurturing the Vital Essence and Embracing Oneness*)**\nTo bear the vital essence and embrace oneness,\nHow could one remain detached?\nTo focus one’s *qi* and attain supreme softness,\nHow could one not be like an infant?\nTo purify and remove all obscurity,\nHow could one not be flawless?\nTo love the people and govern the state,\nHow could one not be without knowledge?\nTo open and close the celestial gates,\nHow could one not be without partiality?\nTo be clear and unobstructed in all directions,\nHow could one not act without contrivance?\nTo give birth to them, to nourish them,\nTo give birth yet not possess them,\nTo act yet not claim credit,\nTo grow yet not dominate—\nThis is called the **Mysterious Virtue**.\n\n---\n**(Chapter XXXVIII: *The Mysterious Virtue*)**\nNot possessing, not claiming,\nNot giving birth yet not slaughtering—\nTransformation unfathomable,\nHeaven and Earth govern themselves.\nAbandoning ornamentation and discarding excess,\nReturning to the origin, reverting to the beginning—\nDisaster ceases from within me,\nChaos vanishes from others.\nFortune springs from Heaven,\nVirtue arises from Earth.\nYet in quietude, ever turning,\nAll things are harmonized and balanced.\nIts virtue is profound and dark,\nNo one can see or hear it.\n\n---\n**(Chapter XXXVIII: *Thirty Spokes and the Central Axis*)**\n\n**(Chapter XXXIX: *The Shepherding of the People in the Primordial Age*)**\nIn the Age of Great Antiquity, the sage shepherded the people,\nFollowing what Heaven and Earth naturally did,\nNot resorting to clever schemes.\nThey drank from gourds,\nThey ate with their hands—\nAll things were equal and balanced,\nNo distinction between high and low.\n\nWhen rulers began to act with purpose,\nThey imposed heavy taxes and laborious duties,\nThe people grew exhausted beyond measure,\nWhile the sovereign’s demands never ceased.\nTheir tributes came from distant lands,\nMen and women carried burdens they could not bear,\nAnd thus the clever devised the wheel hub,\nTo harness horses and oxen,\nTo bear heavy loads and travel far,\nTo ease the people’s toil.\n\nLater generations followed this path,\nAnd artificial refinements multiplied.\nThe wheels were painted with stripes and red,\nAdorned with gold and silver,\nAnd embellished with jade ornaments.\nThe cost of a single chariot\nWas enough to impoverish a family.\n\nThus, Laozi lamented the harm of contrivance to **Dao/Way** and **virtue**,\nIllustrating how well-intentioned action breeds disaster and chaos.\nHence, he cited the three cases—chariot, vessel, dwelling—\nTo explain how **having** and **non-having**,\n**utility** and **use**,\nInterdependently lead to both benefit and ruin.\nThis was his warning to all.\n\n---\n\n**(Chapter XL: *The Decay of Dao and Virtue*)**\nWhen **Dao/Way** and **virtue** decline,\nWorries assail from within,\nWhile yin and yang ravage without.\nThe people grow frail and emaciated,\nPlagued by disease.\nThus, water and fire rise together,\nThe five flavors take form,\nRaw and cooked are not distinguished,\nDry and damp are not separated.\nThe clever then knead clay to make vessels,\nTo cook sour and salty foods.\nThis leads to hunting and indulgence,\nTo slaughtering all living things,\nTo piercing wombs and killing eggs,\nTo gratify the ruler’s desires.\nThey carve and polish pearls and jade,\nTo fashion bowls and plates,\nAnd refine crude materials into tools—\nAll this to such an extent.\n\n---\n\n**(Chapter XLI: *The Corruption of Human Nature and Its Consequences*)**\nOnce human hearts are corrupted,\nAll things grow resentful and hateful.\nSerpents and venomous creatures rise,\nBirds and beasts harm mankind.\nThus, even caves and hollows\nAre no longer sufficient to ward off calamity,\nTo preserve one’s life,\nOr to complete one’s natural span.\nThe clever then devise dwellings:\nRoofed with beams, walled with eaves,\nWindows pierced for surveillance,\nGates fortified with locks,\nOpenings and closures made swift and sharp—\nSo that wasps and insects cannot enter,\nAnd birds and beasts cannot approach.\n\nYet later generations consider this governance,\nWhile earlier ones saw it as chaos.\nFor this is the flaw of **having** and **non-having**,\n**utility** and **use**,\nInterdependently leading to both order and disorder—\nIt lies in the hands of humanity alone.\n\n---\n**Five Colors**\n\n**Five Colors**\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate,\nGalloping and hunting drive the heart to madness,\nRare treasures lead to errant conduct.\n\nThus, the Sage nourishes the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd discards the one to embrace the other.\n\n*(Wang Bi’s commentary on Laozi, Chapter 12)*\n\n(42) To indulge in the shifting allure of the five colors\nIs to gaze without perceiving the forms of calamity and fortune—\nA spear piercing the eyes.\n\nTo revel in the shifting tones of the five sounds\nIs to listen without hearing the voices of auspice and omen—\nA plug sealing the ears.\n\nTo delight in the shifting flavors of the five tastes\nIs to taste without discerning the truth of right and wrong—\nA blade to sever the tongue.\n\n*(Qiang Sici’s Tang-era *Moral Teachings of the Dao De Jing*, Exalted Virtue Commentary)*\n\n(43) To take pleasure in the shifting thrills of hunting and pursuit\nIs to let the mind fall into frenzy and delusion.\nHunting and pursuit are the generals of frenzy and delusion.\n\n*(Qiang Sici’s Tang-era *Moral Teachings of the Dao De Jing*, Exalted Virtue Commentary)*\n\n(44) To covet the shifting allure of wealth and goods\nIs to let the mind stray into perverse inclinations.\nWealth and goods are things that harm the root.\n\n*(Qiang Sici’s Tang-era *Moral Teachings of the Dao De Jing*, Exalted Virtue Commentary)*\n\n(45) The Sage wears the color of no-color,\nListens to the sound of no-sound,\nTastes the flavor of no-flavor,\nGallops through realms of no-boundaries,\nTraverses paths of no-limits,\nCasts nets of no-form—\nAnd thus attains the heart of Dao and virtue!\n\n*(Qiang Sici’s Tang-era *Moral Teachings of the Dao De Jing*, Exalted Virtue Commentary)*\n\n**Chapter on Treating Favor and Insult as Startling**\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Treating Favor and Insult as Startling**\n\nTreating favor and insult as startling,\nOne esteems great calamities as if they were one’s own self.\n\nWhat is meant by *treating favor and insult as startling*?\nFavor is a lowly thing—\nTo receive it is startling,\nTo lose it is startling;\nThis is what is meant by *treating favor and insult as startling*.\n\nWhat is meant by *esteeming great calamities as if they were one’s own self*?\nThe reason I have great calamities\nIs that I have a self.\nAnd when I have no self,\nWhat great calamities do I have?\nThus, to value one’s self as the foundation of all under Heaven,\nIs as if one could entrust all under Heaven;\nTo love one’s self as the foundation of all under Heaven,\nIs as if one could be trusted by all under Heaven.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Unseen Vision**\n\n(46) Rest the mind in the Dao and virtue,\nPreserve the will in divine clarity,\nHarmony as the central sovereign,\nSerene as if not born.\n\nPlans without calculation,\nNurture the heavens and earth;\nConcerns without deliberation,\nSoar through the boundless void.\nPresence and absence in transformation,\nNot regarded as strange.\nHonor and disgrace, exaltation and abasement,\nNo lack or excess in them.\n\nGreat virtue perishes in the self,\nThus great calamities cannot befall,\nAnd the Heavenly Net cannot ensnare.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Unseen Vision**\n\n(46) What cannot be seen is called *Yi* (平易, simplicity),\nWhat cannot be heard is called *Xi* (希, subtlety),\nWhat cannot be grasped is called *Wei* (微, faintness).\nThese three cannot be defined in words,\nThus they merge into one.\nAbove, it does not dazzle,\nBelow, it does not obscure—\nIts threads are indistinct, yet it cannot be named,\nReturning to the formless.\nThis is called the *State of the Unseen* (无状之状),\nThe *Form of the Formless* (无物之象),\nThis is called *Hunhuang* (惚恍, indistinct yet discernible).\n\nPursue it, yet you cannot see its head,\nFollow it, yet you cannot see its tail.\nHold to the ancient Dao,\nTo govern the present with its naturalness—\nOne who knows the ancient beginning,\nThis is called *Dao’s Pattern* (道纪).\n\n---\n\n(47) Before the great goose is formed,\nIf one cracks its egg and examines it,\nIt is not yet a goose.\nYet its shape and sound, head and tail,\nAre already present in essence.\nThis is the goose that is not yet a goose.\n\nHow much more so when,\nBefore the egg of the great goose exists,\nCreation and transformation already give it form!\nThus it is clear:\nThe origin of the *Tai Ji* (太极),\nBefore Heaven and Earth,\nAlready possesses indistinct shape and sound,\nThough unseen and unheard.\n\nTo see without using sight,\nTo hear without using hearing,\nTo grasp without clinging,\nTo speak without words—\nThis is how one discerns.\n\nTherefore,\nThe *Form without Form* (无形之形),\nFrom which Heaven and Earth arise,\nIs called *Yi*.\nThe *Sound without Sound* (无声之声),\nFrom which the five tones begin,\nIs called *Xi*.\nThe *Thread without Thread* (无绪之绪),\nFrom which myriad things emerge,\nIs called *Wei*.\n\n---\n\n(48) Profound and vast, it returns to emptiness,\nIts curves shape all things, allowing them to exist.\nExhausting the subtle, reaching the mysterious,\nAll things find their fulfillment.\nFlowing through all directions,\nNo trace of its absence can be seen.\n\n---\n\n(49) The *State of the Unseen* (无状之状),\nYet it shapes all states;\nThe *Form of the Formless* (无象之象),\nYet it mirrors all forms;\nIts light shines in *Hunhuang* (惚恍),\nYet it reveals all things.\nGreat yet appearing small,\nPresent yet appearing lost.\n\n---\n\n(50) Holding to the ancient Dao’s naturalness,\nTo govern the present without altering its simplicity for barbarians,\nOr changing its form for the Central States.\nWith one principle, know the beginning,\nWith one principle, know the end—\nReverence the Dao’s commands,\nAnd all things hang suspended.\n\nIt governs all without exception,\nIt oversees all without fail—\nIts duties are vast and great,\nNothing it does not fulfill.\nAs the *Empty Framework* (虚纲纪),\nIt is the progenitor of Heaven and Earth.\n\n---\n\nThe Guest:\nAdapting to circumstances yet not innovating,\nFollowing the Dao and yielding to Heaven.\nAlways as a respectful guest,\nNot altering the halls for the host,\nNor changing his wives and concubines.\n\nIce:\nEver yin yet never yang,\nQuiet yet never clamorous,\nAdapting to events and shifting with things.\nSoft and yielding, smooth and supple,\nIt can adapt to all—\nLike winter’s accumulation as ice,\nSpring’s release as water—\nHeaven’s timing in motion.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Attaining the Ultimate Void (致虚极章):**\nAttain the ultimate void,\nHold fast to stillness with sincerity—\nAll things arise together,\nAnd I observe their return.\n\nThings teem and flourish,\nEach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is stillness—\nThis is called restoring the vital breath.\nRestoring the vital breath is constancy.\nKnowing constancy is clarity;\nNot knowing constancy, reckless action brings ruin.\nKnowing constancy is tolerance.\nTolerance brings impartiality,\nImpartiality brings kingship,\nKingship aligns with Heaven,\nHeaven aligns with the Dao,\nThe Dao endures eternally.\nThus, one’s life remains unharmed.\n\n---\n\n**Moral Virtue and the Void:**\nDao and virtue are void and formless,\nThus they can bestow and receive.\nHeaven and Earth are serene and tranquil,\nThus they can transform and change.\nYin and yang alternate,\nThus they can give life and bring death.\nSun and moon advance and retreat,\nThus they can radiate brilliance.\nThe four seasons begin and end,\nThus they can nurture and complete.\n\nTo discard the Void,\nDao and virtue cannot endure;\nTo abandon tranquility,\nHeaven and Earth cannot exist;\nTo move without returning,\nYin and yang cannot harmonize;\nTo advance without retreat,\nSun and moon cannot shine;\nTo end without beginning,\nAll things cannot flourish.\n\nThus, being yet returning to non-being,\nSubstance yet yielding to emptiness—\nThe mind bears nothing,\nThe will is unobstructed.\nAct without action, like a sealed vessel;\nUnworried, like madness;\nEmbrace the True, tread the Pure;\nAbandon cleverness,\nIgnorance as the foremost virtue,\nEmptiness as constancy—\nThen the divine and luminous reach their peak,\nAnd nature unfolds in its fullness!\n\nReflect upon actions inwardly,\nRecollect thoughts to restore the spirit;\nHide myself in non-thought,\nCarry my form in non-being;\nDo not burden the will with what harms life,\nDo not exhaust the spirit with what harms Heaven;\nAct with ease, yet the spirit remains undisturbed,\nFlow inwardly, yet the exterior remains unchanged;\nTurn vision inward, reverse hearing,\nAlign with the spirit’s shifts—\nAscend with Heaven, descend with the world;\nThe spirit guards without disturbance,\nVital breath flows without strain,\nAdvance and retreat, bend and stretch—\nAll find the Middle Way.\n\n---\n\n**The Way’s Origin:**\nBegin with non-action,\nMove with the formless,\nManifest in timely harmony,\nThus success is naturally achieved.\n\n---\n\n**Returning to Transformation:**\nHeaven and Earth alternate,\nThus they endure eternally;\nHumans return to sleep,\nThus they attain clarity;\nFlying birds return to gather,\nThus they soar high;\nRunning beasts return to rest,\nThus they leap far;\nDragons and serpents return to their coils,\nThus they shine resplendent;\nGrasses and trees return to root,\nThus they remain verdant.\n\nWhen transformation returns,\nThe divine attains its place,\nCommuning with the Void,\nThe soul rests, the vital breath settles,\nEach finds its ease—\nThe will is tranquil, the breath flows smoothly,\nBlood and vessels harmonize.\n\n---\n\n**Those Who Lose the Dao:**\nDiscarding constancy,\nPursuing cleverness,\nIndulging desires,\nReckless action brings calamity.\n\nThus, wisdom invites disaster,\nClarity brings calamity,\nDeep insight leads to death,\nErudition brings ruin.\nWhy is this so?\nThey do not return to the Original Beginning,\nThey do not restore the Root Source;\nTheir actions defy the Dao,\nTheir stillness estranges them from the Spirit.\n\nExisting, yet they cannot preserve;\nDoing, yet they cannot accomplish.\n\n---\n\nCultivate the mind in emptiness and stillness,\nAnchor the will in subtlety and wonder,\nAbandon thought in desirelessness,\nReturn to action in non-action—\nThus one attains longevity,\nAnd abides with the Dao eternally.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Supreme Dao:**\nThe Supreme Dao acts without contrivance,\nYet the world knows its existence.\nNext, it is cherished and praised.\nNext, it is feared.\nNext, it is reviled.\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nDoubt arises.\nMysterious! How precious its words!\nWhen deeds are complete and affairs fulfilled,\nThe people say, *\"It happened naturally.\"*\n\n---\n\nPeople delight in being rulers,\nCalling them *\"Emperors.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Discarding Learning:**\nDiscarding learning brings no anxiety.\nHow far apart are *\"only this\"* and *\"that\"*?\nHow different are *\"good\"* and *\"evil\"*?\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\nVast! Its end is boundless!\n\nThe masses rejoice and bustle,\nLike feasting on the grandest sacrificial offerings,\nLike ascending the Spring Terrace—\nI alone remain tranquil, yet no signs appear,\nLike an infant yet to be weaned,\nStaggering and unsteady, as if lost.\n\nThe masses all have excess,\nWhile I alone seem abandoned.\nAm I the heart of a foolish man?\nDull and indistinct!\n\nThe common folk are bright and discerning,\nI alone am dim and murky.\nThe common folk are keen and probing,\nI alone am muddled and obscure.\n\nSerene as the sea, yet boundless in its sweep—\nHow profound! How endless!\n\nThe masses all have something to grasp,\nWhile I alone appear crude and coarse.\nI alone differ from others,\nYet cherish the **Mother of All** (*Food of the Dao*).\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Perils of Worldly Learning:**\nWorldly learning extols argument and values knowledge,\nFosters cliques and partisan debates.\nThe virtuous gain from it, the wicked suffer harm.\nWithin heaven and earth, the virtuous are few while the wicked are many,\nThus learning’s benefits are shallow, yet its harms are deep.\n\nThe wicked who pursue learning\nAre like tigers gaining wings—\nSoaring and prowling across the four seas,\nSelecting flesh to devour.\n\nThe Sage discards it,\nAnd the world rests in peace.\nNo teaching, yet all transform naturally;\nNo commands, yet all submit of their own accord.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Dao’s Fullness Through Flexibility:**\n\n**Chapter on the Dao’s Fullness Through Flexibility:**\n\nWhat is bent remains whole,\nWhat is warped becomes straight,\nWhat is hollowed becomes filled,\nWhat is worn becomes renewed,\nWhat is few gains much,\nWhat is much falls into confusion.\nThus the Sage embraces **Oneness**,\nAnd serves as a model for all under heaven.\n\nHe does not flaunt himself, so he is bright;\nHe does not insist on being right, so his virtue shines;\nHe does not boast of his deeds, so his merit endures;\nHe does not pride himself, so he endures long.\n\nOnly by not contending does he surpass all contenders in heaven and earth.\nWas it mere empty words when the ancients said,\n*\"What is bent remains whole\"*?\nIndeed, it is whole and returns to its source.\n\nEven sages among kings and lords\nStill regard it as *\"bent\"*—\nBy entrusting governance to officials,\nTheir virtue remains whole.\n\nWhen constraints are few, gains are many—\nYet even then, things find their proper measure on their own.\n\nTo rely solely on one’s own thoughts and deliberations,\nWithout drawing from others,\nIs to invite madness through excessive speech and knowledge.\n\nThe Sage does not pride himself in his clarity,\nBut lets all under heaven see with their own eyes—\nThus even **Lí Lóu** cannot surpass his vision.\n\n*\"Boasting\"* means aggressive assault.\nIf one exploits the world’s anger to attack the world,\nEven the Yellow Emperor could not rival his might.\nIf one harnesses the world’s strength to wage war upon it,\nEven **Tang** and **Wu** could not match his achievements—\nThus all under heaven submit to him,\nAnd the descendants of feudal lords serve him willingly.\n\nShadows follow form, echoes answer sound—\nThey do not contend with anything,\nSo who could contend with them?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Virtue of Few Words:**\n\nFew words align with the natural Way.\nHence, gusting winds do not last a morning,\nSudden rains do not last a day.\nWho brings this about?\nHeaven and Earth.\nEven heaven and earth cannot endure long—\nHow much less can mortals?\n\nThose who follow the Dao:\nThose aligned with the Dao merge with the Dao,\nThose aligned with virtue merge with virtue,\nThose aligned with loss merge with loss.\nThose who merge with the Dao find the Dao rejoices in them;\nThose who merge with virtue find virtue rejoices in them;\nThose who merge with loss find loss rejoices in them.\n*\"Trust\"* is insufficient—there is *\"no trust.\"*\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Perils of Arrogance:**\n\nThe overreaching cannot stand,\nThe striding cannot walk,\nThe self-admiring cannot see clearly,\nThe self-righteous cannot shine,\nThe self-praising achieve no merit,\nThe self-proud do not endure.\nIn the Way, they are called *\"excessive food, superfluous limbs.\"*\nThings abhor them—\nThus those who follow the Dao do not dwell among them.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on the Primordial Oneness:**\n\nThere exists a **Primordial Unity**,\nBorn before heaven and earth,\nSilent, vast—\nIndependent, unchanging,\nCirculating without exhaustion,\nCapable of being the **Mother of All under heaven**.\nI do not know its name—\nI call it the **Dao**.\nForced to name it, I call it **\"Great.\"**\nGreat means *\"passing\"*—\nPassing means *\"distant\"*—\nDistant means *\"returning.\"*\nThus the Dao is Great,\nHeaven is Great,\nEarth is Great,\nAnd the Sovereign is Great.\nWithin the realm, there are four Greats—\nAnd the Sovereign holds one of them.\n\nHumans model Earth,\nEarth models Heaven,\nHeaven models the Dao,\nThe Dao models **Naturalness**.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Lightness as the Root of Substance:**\n\nSubstance is the root of lightness,\nStillness governs agitation—\nThus the Sage, though traveling all day,\nNever strays from his **carriage and baggage**.\nThough adorned with splendor,\nHe dwells aloof—\nHow could one who rules a thousand chariots\nLightly cast aside the weight of all under heaven?\nLightness leads to losing one’s foundation,\nAgitation leads to losing one’s master.\n\n---\n**Chapter on Knowing the Masculine:**\n\n**Chapter on Knowing the Masculine:**\n\nKnow its **masculine** (雄),\nHold its **feminine** (雌),\nAnd the world will be **a valley** (溪).\nIf the world is a valley,\nHis **virtue/power** (德) remains unerring,\nAnd he returns to the state of **innocence** (婴儿).\n\nKnow its **bright** (白),\nHold its **dark** (黑),\nAnd the world will be **transformed** (式).\nIf the world is transformed,\nHis **virtue/power** (德) will not falter,\nAnd he returns to the **boundless** (无极).\n\nKnow its **glory** (荣),\nHold its **humiliation** (辱),\nAnd the world will be **a natural plain** (谷).\nIf the world is a natural plain,\nHis **virtue/power** (德) will be complete,\nAnd he returns to **Naturalness** (朴).\n\n**Naturalness** (朴) dispersed becomes **vessels** (器),\nThe Sage uses it and becomes **officials and leaders** (官长).\nThus the great **mechanisms** (制) are not severed.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Knowing the Masculine (Additional Commentary):**\n\n(71) Return to **innocence** (婴儿) is to return to **essence** (志).\nIn **innocence**, he is **simple and unknowing** (蠢然无而无知也).\n\n(72) Revert to **the unborn** (未生),\nReturn to **the beginningless** (未始),\nAlign with the **Dao/Way** (道) as constant,\nAnd return to the **boundless** (无极).\n\n(73) **Virtue/power** (德) and **Dao/Way** (道) are **auxiliaries** (佑),\n**Divine clarity** (神明) is **assistance** (助).\nWhen **Dao/Way** (道) is complete and **virtue/power** (德) is complete,\nThen all things attain **great purity and Naturalness** (大淳朴).\n\n**Chapter on Taking the World:**\n\n**Chapter on Taking the World:**\n\nIf one would take the world and act upon it,\nI see that it cannot be done.\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nIt cannot be forced.\n\nThose who force it ruin it;\nThose who grasp it lose it.\nThus things sometimes move, sometimes follow,\nSometimes sigh, sometimes blow,\nSometimes grow strong, sometimes weak,\nSometimes falter, sometimes collapse.\n\nTherefore, the Sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids grandeur.\n\n---\n*(74)* The world is what divine clarity creates,\nWhat **Great Harmony** (太和) fulfills.\nDivine clarity perceives it,\nWhile the Sage’s wisdom and might cannot reach or control it.\n\n*(75)* Excess is overdoing;\nExtravagance is unbalanced;\nGrandeur is overbearing.\nThus, they are discarded.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Fine Arms:**\n\nFine arms are an inauspicious tool.\nMen detest them,\nSo those who follow the Way do not dwell upon them.\n\nThe gentleman, at home, values the left;\nIn war, values the right.\nArms are an inauspicious tool,\nNot the tool of the gentleman.\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nHe holds to serenity as supreme,\nVictory without pride.\nTo take pride in victory is to delight in killing.\nHe who delights in killing\nCannot achieve his aims in the world.\n\nAuspicious matters favor the left;\nInauspicious matters favor the right.\nThe **Left General** takes the left,\nThe **Right General** takes the right—\nThis is to treat war as a funeral rite.\nFor the multitude slain, let there be mourning and weeping.\nWhen victorious, treat it as a funeral rite.\n\n---\n*(76)* The gentleman is the ruler of the land.\nTo value the left is to honor life and growth.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Knowing People:**\n\nTo know others is wisdom;\nTo know oneself is enlightenment.\nTo overcome others is strength;\nTo overcome oneself is power.\nTo know contentment is wealth;\nTo persevere is resolve;\nTo remain steadfast is endurance;\nTo die without perishing is longevity.\n\n---\n*(77)* Not knowing others, one cannot act in the world;\nNot acting in the world, one cannot engage with society.\nNot knowing oneself, one cannot comprehend **Dao/Way**;\nNot comprehending **Dao/Way**, one cannot foresee what is unseen.\nNot overcoming others, one cannot rule;\nNot ruling, one cannot be sovereign.\nNot overcoming oneself, one cannot attain self-mastery;\nNot attaining self-mastery, one cannot win others.\nNot knowing contentment, one cannot know wealth;\nNot knowing wealth, one cannot curb desire.\nNot persevering, one cannot align with the **Way**;\nNot aligning with the **Way**, one cannot find fulfillment.\nActions not in accord with nature—\nOne cannot achieve harmony;\nWithout harmony, one cannot long endure.\nNot enduring, one cannot nurture **spirit-qi** (神精);\n**Spirit-qi** not accumulated, one cannot attain longevity.\n\nThus, to establish oneself in the world,\nTo promote benefit and remove harm,\nTo interact with others and adapt—\nNothing surpasses knowing people.\n\nTo gather wisdom and preserve clarity,\nTo establish the state and nurture the people,\nTo embody the **Way’s** intent,\nTo grasp **Heaven’s** will—\nNothing is greater than self-knowledge.\n\nTo govern with authority,\nTo set laws and rites,\nTo implement measures and commands,\nTo rectify the realm,\nTo subject the feudal lords—\nNothing is more noble than overcoming others.\n\nTo uphold **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,\nTo align with divine clarity,\nTo follow **Heaven** and **Earth**,\nTo harmonize **yin** and **yang**,\nIn action and stillness, advance and retreat—\nTo subtly win the hearts of men—\nNothing is more exalted than self-mastery.\n\nTo govern the family and state,\nTo make the people content and joyful,\nTo dwell in propriety, reverence, and caution,\nTo be filial, kind, and law-abiding—\nNothing is higher than contentment.\n\nTo wander in divine clarity’s luminous realm,\nSerene and undisturbed,\nTo attain honor, splendor, and grace—\nNothing is better than fulfillment.\n\nTo serve in office, attend to superiors,\nTo complete others’ works,\nTo follow in their footsteps,\nTo benefit the myriad people—\nNothing surpasses endurance.\n\nWhat **Heaven** and **Earth** cherish,\nWhat the living rely upon,\nTo dwell in it without satiety,\nTo rejoice in it without end—\nWhen all blessings converge,\nAnd none can rival its splendor—\nNothing is more beautiful than longevity.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter on Grasping the Great Image:**\n\nGrasp the **Great Image**,\nAnd the world will come to it.\nCome to it without harm,\nAnd it will be peaceful and vast.\nOffer delight and bait,\nAnd passing guests will stop.\n\nWhen the **Way** emerges in speech,\nIt is bland, without flavor.\nTo gaze upon it, insufficient to see;\nTo listen, insufficient to hear;\nTo use it, never exhausted.\n\n---\n*(78)* The **Way** has no form,\nYet **Heaven** and **Earth** rely on it to generate.\nThe **Way** has no being,\nYet **yin** and **yang** rely on it to begin.\nThe **Way** has no law,\nYet the four seasons rely on it for their work.\nThe **Way** has no image,\nYet the myriad beings rely on it to move.\n\nThus, the **Great Law** has no law,\nThe **Great Image** has no image,\nThe **Great** has no limits to what it lacks,\nThe **Great** has no limits to what it possesses.\nTo act where there is no acting,\nTo negate where there is no negation—\nThus the **Way** achieves its purpose without doing,\nAnd **virtue/power** governs without exertion.\n\nWhat then is there to do?\nNot lacking what is lacking,\nNot negating what is negated—\nThe **Way** finds itself here,\nAnd all things find themselves there.\n\n---\n\n*(79)* When one is about to **withdraw** it, one must first **fully expand** it;\nWhen one is about to **weaken** it, one must first **fully strengthen** it;\nWhen one is about to **abolish** it, one must first **fully promote** it;\nWhen one is about to **take away** it, one must first **fully grant** it—\nThis is called the **subtle luminosity**.\n\nThe **soft and weak** overcome the **hard and strong**.\nA fish cannot be lifted from the depths,\nAnd the **state’s sharp tools** cannot be kept from the people.\n\n*(80)* The **Dao/Way** that passes through **virtue/power** and **mystic luminosity**,\nThat **Heaven** and **Earth** transform through,\nThat **yin** and **yang** regulate—\nThe **real** returns to the **void**,\nThe **luminous** returns to **obscurity**,\nThe **flourishing** returns to **decay**,\nThe **expanded** returns to **relaxation**,\nThe **possessed** returns to **loss**,\nThe **alive** returns to **death**—\nThis is the nature of things and the **natural Way**.\n\nThus, the **advantage of reversal** and the **benefit of yielding**—\nThe **Way** governs **Heaven**,\n**Heaven** governs the **sovereign**,\nThe **sovereign** governs the **ministers**,\nThe **ministers** govern the **people**,\nAnd all **qi-bearing** kinds **preserve themselves in life**.\n\nWhen **tigers and leopards** seek to grasp,\nThey **conceal** their claws;\nWhen **jackals and wolves** prepare to devour,\nTheir **fangs** are not seen;\nThe **sage** abandons **intent** to follow the **Way**,\nThe **wise** turn against the **world** to follow the **people**.\n\n**Loyal words** that are **displeasing to the ear** contain their **rectitude**,\nAnd **wicked ministers** about to rise **submit** to their **lord**.\n\nIf one knows this and **applies** it,\nThen between **Heaven** and **Earth**, within the **six directions**,\nAll shall be **blessed**.\nIf one does not know this and **applies** it,\nThen even within the **inner chambers**, among **bone and flesh**,\nAll shall be **thieves**.\n\nThus, **children** and **brothers** may at times be **jackals and wolves**,\nAnd **enemies** and **foes** may at times be **father and elder brother**.\nYet within **affirmation** lies **negation**,\nAnd within **negation** lies **affirmation**—\n**One negation, one affirmation**,\nAnd **some perish while others survive**.\n\nThus, unless it is **loyalty**,\nEven **kin** cannot be trusted;\nUnless it is **goodness**,\nEven the **near** cannot be **loved**.",

      "translated_text": "「In ancient times, the *One* [得一] was attained—\nIts movement stems from *contrary action* [反行],\nAnd only those of high innate nature can truly perceive it,\nThus it was entrusted to the *superior sage* [上士].\n\nThe *superior sage* has lofty and keen insight,\nDeep and distant understanding alone,\nDisdaining the world and holding all things lightly,\nHe bears only the *Dao* [道] on his shoulders,\nThus it was entrusted to *Dao generating the One* [道生一].\n\n*Dao generating the One* is supreme emptiness without name,\nReceiving the primal *hun* [混冥],\nRefining the clear and the turbid,\nMolding the *Great Harmony* [太和],\nThus it was entrusted to *the utmost softness under heaven* [天下至柔].\n\n*The utmost softness under heaven* is subtle and formless,\nPiercing the firm and penetrating the distant,\nConquering all without defeat,\nThus it was entrusted to *possessing named wealth and goods* [身有名货].\n\nTo possess named wealth and goods brings strength and power,\nYet strength and power invite calamity,\nThus it was entrusted to *Great Completion* [大成].\n\n*Great Completion* is like emptiness,\nVoid of named wealth and goods,\nAll things harmonize and communicate,\nThus it was entrusted to *the world with the Dao* [天下有道].\n\n*The world with the Dao* rests with the sovereign,\nThe sovereign without desire sees all things preserved,\nThus it was entrusted to *not stepping outside the door* [不出户].\n\nBy not stepping outside the door, one knows the life and fate of all the people,\nReceiving them in harmony and resting in ease,\nThus it was entrusted to *daily learning brings increase* [为学日益].\n\nTo daily learn brings increase,\nYet words arise and affairs multiply, exhausting the spirit and harming the people,\nThus it was entrusted to *the Sage has no mind* [圣人无心].\n\n*The Sage has no mind*,\nUniting with the people’s *shen* [神],\nCautiously preserving their life and fate,\nReturning to the primal *zhen* [素真],\nThus it was entrusted to *born and enter death* [出生入死].\n\nTo be born and enter death,\nEvery movement depletes the spirit,\nDiscarding the non-returning for the returning,\nCannot long endure,\nThus it was entrusted to *Dao generating life* [道生之].\n\n*Dao generating life* is through emptiness and nothingness,\nWhere all things are preserved,\nSilent and still, unmoving,\nNothing it refuses,\nThus it was entrusted to *the world has a beginning* [天下有始].\n\n*The world has a beginning*,\nNon-action as its core,\nTo penetrate all affairs without confusion,\nTo know all without limitation,\nThus it was entrusted to *let me have knowledge* [使我有知].\n\n*Let me have knowledge*,\nThe *Dao* refined and practiced,\nFear of losing the natural order,\nBringing ruin to descendants,\nThus it was entrusted to *good foundation* [善建].\n\nTo *good foundation* with virtue,\nConnecting with all things,\nBlessing future generations,\nFlowing to the ends and flourishing,\nThus it was entrusted to *the virtuous sage* [含德之士].\n\n*The virtuous sage*,\nEmbodied in the *Dao* and walking in the *shen* [神],\nLike an infant—innocent and unknowing,\nThus it was entrusted to *the knowing do not speak* [知者不言].\n\n*The knowing do not speak*,\nThe *yīnyáng* [阴阳] subtly transform,\nInternally rectifying the self,\nThe self extending to the family,\nThe family extending to the people,\nThus it was entrusted to *govern the realm* [政治国].\n\nTo govern with rectitude,\nWithout decrees yet all things move,\nForeign lands and customs come without command,\nThus it was entrusted to *square yet not cutting* [方而不割].\n\n*Square yet not cutting*,\nAll things preserved whole,\nConquering all without defeat,\nThe *Dao* of heaven shines great,\nThus it was entrusted to *rule the great realm* [治大国].\n\nThe ruler of the great realm must not act greatly nor do greatly,\nGreat actions and deeds bring great disorder and turmoil—then ruin,\nThus it was entrusted to *the great realm* [大国].\n\n*The great realm* is naturally advantageous,\nAll under heaven desire it,\nCalmness below brings return,\nFrenzy above breeds war,\nThus it was entrusted to *harmonizing with things* [道物].\n\n*Harmonizing with things* is firm and steady,\nThose who attain it are enlightened,\nThose who treasure it are preserved,\nThose who guard it are profound,\nThus it was entrusted to *non-action* [为无为].\n\n*Non-action* makes the transformations effortless,\nThings flourish unseen—yet all things grow,\nThus it was entrusted to *its ease in holding* [其安易持].\n\nBefore signs appear, plans are easy,\nHolding to it like the simple,\nNo visible affairs yet all calamities vanish,\nAll blessings come naturally,\nThus it was entrusted to *the ancient Way* [古之为道].\n\n*The ancient Way* is to keep the people simple,\nCutting off extremes and eradicating roots,\nSealing the gates of knowledge,\nThus it was entrusted to *the rivers and seas* [江海].\n\n*The rivers and seas* know no limits,\nEmpty and tranquil, dwelling in the lowly,\nTo receive all the valleys,\nThus it was entrusted to *the world calls me greatly unlike* [天下谓我大似不肖].\n\n*The unlike* Way uniquely aligns with heaven’s heart,\nRaising armies and moving the people,\nInvincible and undefeated,\nThus it was entrusted to *the use of arms* [用兵].\n\n*The use of arms* follows heaven’s patterns and responds to human needs,\nArising from its root,\nNot from my own will,\nThus it was entrusted to *my words are easily known* [吾言易知].\n\n*My words are easily known*,\nWithout wisdom or understanding,\nWithout speech or affairs,\nLetting things act naturally,\nThus it was entrusted to *knowing the unknown* [知不知].\n\n*Knowing the unknown*,\nDiscarding the mind and discarding intent,\nBorn yet like death,\nPreserved yet like loss,\nAbandoning my clever artifices,\nTo pursue calamity and misfortune,\nThus it was entrusted to *the people do not fear authority* [民不畏威].\n\n*The people do not fear authority*,\nLightly shunning prohibitions and easily entering,\nTrapped in officialdom,\nTheir great fate severed from heaven,\nThus it was entrusted to *daring to be bold* [勇於敢].\n\n*Daring to be bold* stirs the heart of the thief,\nTaking life and losing principle,\nThe law decays and the state perishes,\nThus it was entrusted to *the people do not fear death* [民不畏死].\n\n*The people do not fear death*,\nDesires unchecked and prohibitions ignored,\nFollowing their emotions and inclinations,\nTo reach poverty and destitution,\nThus it was entrusted to *the people’s hunger* [人之饥也].\n\n*The people’s hunger*,\nHeavy taxes and excessive levies,\nGreed for plunder, ceaseless scheming,\nHarshness and rigidity, seizing life,\nThus it was entrusted to *the people’s life* [人之生也].\n\n*The people’s life*,\nSoft and weak yet fearing reverence,\nHarmonious and pure, subtle and refined,\nKeen and bright with daily learning,\nIn death, they become harsh and rigid,\nThus it was entrusted to *the Way of heaven* [天之道].\n\n*The Way of heaven* diminishes fullness and supplements emptiness,\nNurtures the soft and compliant,\nOverthrows the firm and shatters the rigid,\nThus it was entrusted to *nothing under heaven is softer and weaker than water* [天下莫柔弱於水].\n\n*Water*, though soft and weak,\nCan overcome the firm and strong,\nResting in the subtle and delighting in the small,\nIn peril it finds its ease,\nThus it was entrusted to *the small realm* [小国].\n\n*The small realm*’s sovereign,\nForm is empty, power is weak,\nLife depends on neighbors,\nThus it was entrusted to *the trustworthy* [信者].\n\n*The trustworthy* are aided by all the people,\nAnd preserved by ministers and generals,\nHeavened by earth and sky,\nAnd assisted by the *Dao* and virtue.\n\nZhuangzi said: In the past, when Laozi composed the *Jīng* [经],\nHe recorded the principles of transformation,\n*Dao* and *virtue* as its mother,\nThe *Jīng* listed first,\nHeaven and earth as its model.\n\nThe *upper jīng* corresponds to heaven,\nThe *lower jīng* corresponds to earth.\nEight chapters for the *yin* Way,\nNine chapters for the *yang* Way,\nUsing *yin* to follow *yang*,\nThus seventy-two chapters.\nBeginning with *yang* to follow *yin*,\nThus divided into upper and lower.\nWith eight chapters for the five *xíng* [行],\nThus the upper *jīng* has forty chapters before it begins anew.»",

Their affairs are not the One.\nHence, they fashion the cart from non-cart,\nAnd the thing from non-thing,\nNot wishing to be busy like the solitary and obscure,\nNor to stand out like the stark and prominent.\n\nThe *Dao*’s movement and transformation\nAre the principle of change—\nThe weak, its harmonious application.\n\nThe things of heaven and earth,\nHaving form, arise from causes and conditions;\nHaving life, arise from the void’s beginning.\nThe One is the child of *Dao*,\nThe mother of luminous intelligence,\nThe source of great harmony,\nThe ancestor of heaven and earth.\n\nTo the spirit, it is non-existence;\nTo the *Dao*, it is existence.\nTo the spirit, it is vast;\nTo the *Dao*, it is minute.\nThus, in its manifestation,\nIt is both empty and real,\nBoth nonexistent and existent,\nRound yet not circular,\nSquare yet not measured.\nIt stretches without end,\nMoves without trace,\nNeither floats nor sinks,\nNeither proceeds nor halts—\nIt acts yet does not act,\nIt bestows yet does not give,\nIts changes are boundless,\nIts principles are contained in the whole.\n\nThe void of non-void,\nThe beginning of beginnings,\nNeither outer nor inner,\nMingled in primordial chaos—\nBlurred and indistinct,\nIt may turn left or right.\nIn emptiness, it abides as constant,\nIn stillness, it reigns supreme.\nIt flows through the ten thousand heavens,\nIt permeates the myriad lands.\nAll things arise from it,\nYet it bears no form or sign.\n\nThe One alone remains,\nIn mysterious solitude,\nAll-encompassing without gaps,\nUnchanging in simplicity.\nMingled in dark clarity,\nIt lacks nothing.\nIt molds the luminous spirit,\nYet does not share its nature.\nIt shapes the heavens and earth,\nYet does not dwell among them.\n\nIt receives without depletion,\nIt gathers without hoarding—\nNeither crooked nor straight,\nNeither first nor last.\nIts grandeur is boundless,\nIts depths unfathomable.\nAbove and below cannot conceal it,\nIts currents cannot be measured.\nIt spreads and nourishes,\nRadiant and unceasing—\nNourishing without mingling,\nTransforming without joining.\nIt does not create, yet all things arise;\nIt does not act, yet all things are accomplished.\nBeyond heaven and earth,\nWithin the smallest measure,\nThe breath of *qi* differs,\nThe forms and kinds are diverse—\nYet all attain the One’s essence to live,\nAnd all fulfill its transformation to thrive.\n\nThus, the One is the guiding thread for all things,\nAnd the supreme principle of change.\nIt is the standard for all directions,\nAnd the balance for all variations.\nThe One is its name,\nVirtue its title,\nNon-existence its dwelling,\nNon-action its work,\nFormlessness its measure,\nReturn its great cycle,\nHarmony its end,\nThe weak its use.\nThus, to know the One,\nAll changes are inexhaustible,\nAll transformations are unerring;\nTo fail to know the One,\nFortunes wax and wane,\nThose who rule nations perish,\nThose who guard their lives are lost.\n\nTherefore, the ancients who attained the One:\nThe heavens, in their nature, attained the One’s purity,\nYet what the heavens do is not purity.\nWithout heart or intent,\nWithout action or deed,\nThey follow their nature.\nMysterious and silent,\nWithout container or shape,\nThey preserve their life.\nThus, yin and yang arise spontaneously,\nChange unfolds naturally—\nSo they move with firm yet yielding vigor,\nAchieving their height,\nLuminous and clear,\nGreatly harmonious,\nPure and true, unmingled—\nThe *Daoyi* stands grand,\nRadiant and resplendent,\nAll things draw from its beginning,\nClouds and mists ascend,\nForms and kinds flow forth,\nThe primal breath of life—\nMysterious and boundless,\nWithout fail, it covers all.\n\nThe heavens attain the One with purity.\n\nThe earth, in its nature, attains the One’s tranquility,\nYet what the earth does is not tranquility.\nWithout knowledge or perception,\nWithout action or deed,\nThey follow their nature.\nWithout measure or number,\nWithout worry or gain,\nThey preserve their life.\nThus, mountains and rivers arise spontaneously,\nFirmness and softness align naturally—\nSo they remain steadfast yet yielding,\nDirect yet harmonious,\nVast and limitless,\nDeep and serene,\nAll things draw from them to live,\nNone fail to be sustained.\n\nThe earth attains the One with tranquility.\n\nThe spirit, in its nature, attains the One’s responsiveness,\nYet what the spirit does is not responsiveness.\nWithout thought or deliberation,\nWithout action or deed,\nThey follow their nature.\nWithout schemes or plans,\nWithout echoes or beginnings,\nThey preserve their life.\nThus, ebb and flow arise spontaneously,\nPreservation and extinction align naturally—\nSo the aged can return to vigor,\nThe dead can revive,\nThe trapped can find release,\nThe ruined can flourish anew—\nChange knows no limit,\nReturn is endless,\nAll kinds entrust themselves to it,\nNone stray from its core.\n\nThe spirit attains the One with responsiveness.\n\nThe valleys, in their nature, attain the One with fullness,\nYet what the valleys do is not fullness.\nWithout desire or seeking,\nWithout action or deed,\nThey follow their nature.\nWithout kindness or righteousness,\nWithout giving or bestowing,\nThey preserve their life.\nThus, solid and void arise spontaneously,\nFlourishing and decline align naturally—\nSo they

the myriad without being sages,\nWho abandon the proper measure and follow their own hearts.\n\nTo uphold the proper measure in action\nIs still not free from blame and calamity,\nMuch less so for those who abandon the measure and follow their hearts—\nThus, they perish in no time.\n\nTherefore, the Dao of Heaven and humanity,\nThe myriad transformations of things—\nThe few become the many,\nThe humble become noble,\nThe high become low,\nThe completed become ruined,\nWhat benefits becomes harm,\nWhat profits becomes injury.\nThose who dwell in opposition find their reversal,\nThose who seek gain lose what they cherish.\nThis is called: *\"Nobility rests upon humility as its foundation,\nElevation rests upon lowliness as its base.\"*\n\nThus, the virtuous ruler

desiring, so they possess all;\nNot acting, so they govern all.\nAmidst the myriad’s confusion,\nTheir own being is uninvolved—\nThus they become the foundation of all.\nThis is not unique to the ruler’s Dao;\nAll affairs are the same.\n\nThe craftsman shaping a carriage,\nMakes it round or square,\nShort or long,\nCurved or straight,\nVertical or horizontal—\nYet all his life he labors,\nAnd

a thing,\nIs subtle and few;\nYet stone, as a thing,\nIs vast and many.\nMany, hence humble;\nFew, hence noble.\nJade and stone,\nThough born of the same kind,\nFew and many,\nAre either sought or discarded.\nThus, nobility and humility lie in abundance or scarcity,\nSuccess and failure lie in whether one acts or not.\nThus, neither does one desire to be polished like jade,\nNor to be coarse

      "translated_text": "「Thus, the sage sets forth the words of *having*—\nTo present the Dao as though in darkness, yet its movement is ceaseless and subtle;\nTo advance the Dao as though in retreat, returning to its origin;\nTo smooth the Dao as though with a file, refining its roots;\nTo uphold the highest virtue like a valley, bestowing it in profound mystery;\nTo display great purity as though in disgrace, appearing unwise;\nTo manifest abundant virtue as though insufficient, leaving no trace to describe;\nTo establish virtue as though by stealth, diminishing the people’s blessings;\nTo reveal true essence as though in error, seeming shallow and lacking;\nTo embody the Dao’s vastness without corners, without crookedness or straightness;\nTo achieve greatness through slow maturation, not by immediate clarity;\nTo produce the grandest sound where voice is scarce, where speech is faint;\nTo manifest the most sublime forms where shape is none, where no setting is made;\nTo conceal the Dao without name, without posthumous titles, without distinction—\n\nOnly the Dao, indeed, is good at lending itself to completion,\nAnd responds to all things.\n\n**Returning to the source:**\nThe Way and virtue of Heaven and Earth each have their own patterns,\nThings have their high and low, *qi* has its short and long.\nEach takes delight in what it delights in,\nSuffers from what it suffers,\nSees what it sees,\nHears what it hears,\nAccepts and rejects with divergent paths#3,\nFears and rejoices in different directions.\n\nThus, the quail and partridge soar high,\nYet their whole day is spent in ceaseless flight,\nWhile their hearts dwell in the humble weeds;\nThe wild goose and swan rise aloft,\nCrossing east and west, spanning thousands and reaching ten thousand,\nYet their hearts dwell in the marshes and ponds;\nThe phoenix and *luan*#4 soar above the ninefold peaks,\nLeisurely in the boundless purity,\nYet they always consider themselves lowly.\n\nStretching their necks, spreading their wings,\nThey skim the azure clouds,\nEclipse the sun and moon,\nSoar high and drift far,\nGo long days without eating,\nTravel the nine regions,\nRest in the eight extremes,\nAnd thus find their true fit.\n\nThe three creatures differ in their ways,\nYet all find joy in their own kind.\n\nTherefore, the boundless source,\nThe ten-thousand-fathom springs,\nWhere the divine dragon takes its rest,\nAnd tiny fish retreat—\nHigh mountains and great mounds,\nDeep forests and vast ravines,\nLush trees with sprawling branches—\nAre where the great birds and tigers and leopards take delight,\nYet where the chickens and dogs recoil in disgust.\n\nAlas, the inherited customs of the Three Dynasties,\nThe rustic scholars and inked literati’s refined styles,\nReciting the *Shijing* and *Shujing*,\nPracticing rituals and etiquette,\nSinging elegies and odes,\nPlucking the *qin* and *se*,\nExalting benevolence and righteousness,\nHonoring purity and clarity,\nStudying past antiquity,\nMastering divination and numerology,\nFixing what is and condemning what is not,\nAchieving personal security and fame,\nWith neighbors preserving their legacy—\nThese are the ways of the middle sage,\nYet abandoned by the upper sage.\n\nIn quiet seclusion and profound contemplation,\nThey strain their minds to comprehend all things,\nFabricate falsehoods and disguise reality,\nSpeak empty words of names and things,\nDash about in pursuit of advancement or retreat,\nAscend or descend, kneel or bow,\nRegulate the rituals of the inner chambers,\nConform to the customs of their age,\nLean or recline, tilt or bow,\nStrive to align with the world’s expectations,\nFlatter the wealthy and honor the noble,\nCater to the masses’ ears and eyes,\nGain esteem and favor from the powerful,\nFollow the trends of the common folk—\nThese are the practices of the lower sage,\nYet rejected by the middle sage.\n\nThus, rules and measures do not harm one another,\nDiverse natures find their own harmony;\nThe wise and saintly are not paired with the unworthy,\nThe foolish and clever do not form a single group.\n\nThe noble take joy in simplicity and tranquility,\nThe petty revel in grand and imposing achievements,\nYet fail to understand the humble dwelling of the common folk,\nNor delight in the deeds of a true gentleman.\n\nBirds and beasts all flourish together,\nEach pursuing its own inclinations;\nScholars of all kinds traverse the world,\nEach finding their own path.\n\nTherefore, they abandon sharp intelligence,\nDiscard clever scheming,\nReturn to true simplicity,\nRoam in the Great Purity,\nHold the world in disdain,\nStand aloof without blemish,\nLet anger and joy not disturb their hearts,\nLet profit and harm not enter their minds,\nTreat noble and base as equal,\nHold life and death in balanced measure,\nAct without striving,\nGaze upon the profound mysteries,\nTheir spirits serene and undefiled,\nEmbrace virtue and contain harmony,\nNaturally reversing the transformations of the world.\n\nThis is what the greatest sages uphold,\nAnd what the upper sages strive for,\nWhile the middle sages are dazzled by it,\nAnd the lower sages laugh at it in derision.\n\nThus, what the middle sages hear is not the utmost beauty,\nAnd what the lower sages see is not the utmost goodness.\nWhat dazzles the middle sages and amuses the lower sages\nIs truly the most beautiful and good of all.\n\nTo lay out grand theories and expound lofty doctrines,\nTo display the natural and exhaust the subtle—\nThen the middle sages are dazzled,\nAnd the lower sages laugh in scorn.\n\nTo float empty words and wander in persuasions,\nTo generate endless variations and schemes,\nTo create blessings and seek advantages,\nTo achieve success and fulfill tasks—\nThen the middle sages debate,\nAnd the lower sages wake to awareness.\n\nThis is not because they delight in calamity and abhor fortune,\nNor because they value misfortune and despise blessings—\nTheir nature is far removed,\nTheir feelings opposed.\n\nIt is as though they were in the Yellow Springs,\nListening to the nine heavens,\nYet so distant and utterly cut off\nThat they cannot see or hear at all.\n\nThe lower sages do not laugh at the great Dao,\nBut the Dao is too lofty to be seen—\nLike playing a drum before an ox,\nThat is why they laugh.\n\nThus, the sage sets forth the words of *having*—\nThose who speak of *having* say the Dao is hard to know,\nTrace the natural origin of all things,\nAnd use these to guide the myriad directions of life.\n\nTo truly speak of *having* is beyond the grasp of the mediocre.\nOnce the extraordinary Dao is understood,\nIt is beyond the reach of ordinary men.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe sage’s Dao is profound, subtle, vast, and distant,\nMajestic yet elusive, dim yet luminous,\nEmpty yet tranquil, where all things pass.\nFrom the finest to the grandest,\nIt has no form or image.\n\nTo push it to its limits is to know it cannot endure,\nTo constrain it tightly is to find words cannot express it,\nTo shift and disperse it is to see books cannot convey it—\nThe bright Dao appears as though in darkness.\n\nWhy does advancing the Dao seem like retreat,\nAnd the lost Dao appear as though in existence?\nTo govern the world, one must first rectify oneself.\n\nEmpty stillness is the Dao’s gateway,\nTranquility is the root of the spirit,\nSerenity is the origin of harmony,\nSilence is the foundation of virtue,\nFrugality is the vessel of *qi*,\nSubtlety is the craft of action.\n\nDwelling beyond the realm of *having*,\nStanding before the realm of *having*,\nAbandoning the world,\nFirst cultivating oneself,\nNurturing the spirit and accumulating harmony,\nTo govern one’s own heart—\n\nThe heart is the sovereign of the body,\nThe body is the heart of the state,\nThe world responds in kind,\nAs though by nature.\n\nThus, advancing the Dao seems like retreat.\n\nTherefore, to smooth the Dao as though with a file,\nIs to let the true and profound arise,\nTo discard its trappings and distinctions,\nTo abandon its divisions and logic,\nTo follow the people’s hearts,\nTo listen to their natural inclinations,\nTo extinguish its ornate expressions,\nTo level its highs and lows.\n\nTo break down barriers and shatter keys,\nSo that deceit naturally ceases;\nTo dismantle walls and scatter prisons,\nSo that the people naturally defend themselves—」",

I shall use them as examples of calamity and extreme misfortune.\n\n**Annotations on *Zhi Gui* (指归):**\nThe *void within the void*—opening and guiding the reception—is the void itself, the Dao/Way.\nThere is no *void* without the void, yet the void cannot void itself.\nThe Dao/Way can void and thus generates all things, but all things cannot void and generate the Dao/Way.\nTherefore, the Dao/Way is the origin from which all things void—the reason it is said: *\"There is no void without the void, yet the void cannot void itself.\"*\n\nThe *void* that generates is the transformation and change of the subtle.\nThe origin of existence is the subtle, yet existence cannot generate itself.\nThe subtle is *One*.\n*One* can be the origin of existence, but it is not a tangible form of existence that cannot generate itself—hence: *\"The origin of existence is the subtle, yet existence cannot generate itself.\"*\n\nThe *void of the nonexistent*—the divine and luminous—cannot be altered.\nThe *void* that creates existence is the nonexistent, yet the nonexistent cannot exist.\nThe nonexistent is *Two*.\n*Two* arises from *One*, though it has a form, and thus can create existence—but it is not existence itself that can create. Hence: *\"The nonexistent is the void that creates existence, yet the nonexistent cannot exist.\"*\n\nThe *void* that generates is the subtle and mysterious.\nThe *void* that moves and completes is the completed, yet the completed cannot complete itself.\nThe *void* is *Three*.\n*Three* arises from *Two*, yet also has its form, rooted in *One*, receiving its mandate from the divine. It portends the generation of all things, yet all things cannot complete it—hence: *\"The void that moves and completes is the completed, yet the completed cannot complete itself.\"*\n\nThus, the *void within the void* generates the *voids*—the nonexistent, the nonexistent, and the void that generates form.\nTherefore, all things with form belong to the category of *things*, and each thing has its origin, each category its ancestor.\nHeaven and Earth are the greatest of things; humanity follows next.\n\nNow, the generation of Heaven and humanity—\nForm arises from *qi*,\n*Qi* arises from harmony,\nHarmony arises from the divine and luminous,\nThe divine and luminous arise from virtue and the Dao/Way,\nVirtue and the Dao/Way arise from naturalness,\nAnd all things exist.\n\nNaturalness is the name given to that which no thing compels—it is the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way’s natural transformation generates the divine,\nThe divine communicates and forms harmony,\nHarmony disperses and becomes *qi*,\n*Qi* condenses and takes form.\nHence it is said: *\"The Dao/Way generates One, One generates Two, Two generates Three, Three generates all things.\"*\n\nTherefore, Heaven is called Heaven not because it is Heaven,\nAnd humanity is called humanity not because it is humanity.\nExistence arises from the origin, yet the origin cannot generate existence—hence: *\"What is called humanity is not humanity.\"*\n\nHow can this be made clear?\nZhuangzi said:\nWhen a person’s form decays, where does it derive from?\nWhen the wise and responsive shine forth, where do they obtain this?\nWhen transformation reaches its end, who is its author?\nThe origin lies in the nonexistent.\nFrom this perspective, existence arises from the nonexistent,\nAnd reality arises from the void—this is made clear.\n\nThus, the nonexistent is the origin of the nonexistent,\nAnd cannot be grasped in existence.\nIt has no form, no sound, and cannot be heard or seen.\nReceiving the nonexistent and granting existence—\nThis cannot be spoken or explained as the Dao/Way.\n\nThe nonexistent is the origin of the nonexistent,\nThe beginning of the unbegun.\nAll things derive from it,\nAnd it is the source of life and nature.\nThat which has no name is called the Dao/Way.\nThe Dao/Way is the origin of *One*.\n\nThe Dao/Way is the void within the void,\nAnd thus can generate *One*.\nThe origin is tranquil and boundless—\nIt is the void within the void that first generates *One*.\n\nThere is a primal *thing* of confusion and indistinction,\nVague and indistinct in its emergence.\nLight yet not dispersing, heavy yet not settling,\nYang yet without exterior, yin yet without interior.\nIt has neither above nor below, nor left nor right,\nReaching through without boundary—\nIt is the guiding principle of the Dao/Way.\nEmbracing the void, it is spacious and empty,\nEnfolding what has not yet come into being.\nFormless, nameless,\nBlazing yet indistinct,\nConfused yet indistinct,\nDark yet beyond measure—\nIt vanishes in sound and color,\nAnd nothing can compare to it.\nPoint to it, and there is no direction,\nSeize it, and there is nothing to grasp.\nVast and boundless, it cannot be reasoned or explained,\nGrand and harmonious, without end or beginning,\nThe dwelling of all things,\nThe first of the primordial—\nThus it is called *One*.\n\nThe primordial *One* has the nonexistent,\nThe nonexistent is nameless.\nThat from which *One* arises—\nThe *One* yet without form—\nIs the virtue/power within the confused darkness that can generate.\n\nThus, without end or beginning,\nWithout left or right,\nSeeming yin yet not yin,\nSeeming yang yet not yang—\nHence: *\"Yang without exterior, yin without interior.\"*\n\n*One* is void, and thus can generate *Two*.\n*One* is the void within existence, transforming into *Two*.\nWith *Two* things arising, subtle and refined,\nThey exist and sustain existence,\nFollowing things in their transformations,\nSlippery yet formless,\nTheir vitality never decaying,\nIlluminating the dark mysteries,\nWithout direction or existence,\nEnfolding Heaven and Earth,\nTheir origin unseen,\nThey cannot be traced by sound,\nNor evaded by form—\nThis is called the divine and luminous.\n\nExistence sustains things, absence destroys them.\nWisdom and power cannot reach them,\nNor virtue and might be employed—\nThis is called *Two*.\n*Two* is the divine and luminous.\n\n*Two* arises from the origin’s nonexistent,\nAnd thus can generate *Three*.\nThe divine and luminous are the nonexistent within the nonexistent,\nAnd thus can generate *Three*.\n\nWith *Three* things arising together,\nMingled and indistinct,\nVisible yet no form discerned,\nHeard yet no sound perceived,\nSeized yet no thread grasped,\nGazed upon yet no entrance seen—\nIt cannot be measured or fathomed,\nDark yet indistinct,\nGrand yet harmonious,\nPure and turbid in unity,\nMoving with harmony,\nThe origin of Heaven and humanity,\nYet without distinct form or boundary,\nRooted in *One*, receiving its mandate from the divine—\nThis is called *Three*.」",

      "translated_text": "「Three is the *Great Harmony* (Tàihé).\n*Three* arises from the nonexistent,\nAnd thus can generate all things.\nThe *Great Harmony* is the nonexistent within the existent,\nA single transformation yielding the existent,\nHence the saying: *Three* generates all things.\nWith purity and turbidity divided,\nHigh and low arrayed,\nYin and Yang first distinguished,\nAnd the *Harmonious Qi* (Hégǔ) flowing,\nThe *Three Lights* (Sānguāng) revolving,\nAll classes of beings born,\nThings with form that may be traced,\nThings with sound and color that may be seen and heard—\nThis is called all things.\n\nWhen all things are born,\nThey all originate from the *Void* (Xū),\nAnd begin with the nonexistent.\nThe *Void* is the root of the nonexistent,\nThe origin is the root of beginnings.\n\nBacking Yin, facing Yang—\nAll things back Yin and face Yang.\nReturning to softness, abandoning hardness,\nIn stillness and purity, unmoved,\nMind and intent not stirred,\nYet their form and substance refined,\nTheir vitality and spirit unbounded—\nThis is by containing *Harmonious Qi* (Hégǔ) and *Softness* (Ruò),\nSo that the *Way* is formless.\n\nThus, the *Void*, the nonexistent, the formless, the subtle, the few, and the soft—\nThese are the source from which Heaven and Earth arise,\nAnd the root by which all things are generated,\nWhat the common people detest yet rulers name themselves with,\nThe primal origin of all things,\nThe fundamental root of success.\n\nFor the *Void*, the nonexistent, the solitary, and the few—\nThese are the fundamental roots of all things,\nHence rulers name themselves with them,\nYet the common people detest them.\n\nTherefore, the wise sovereign and saintly ruler,\nWith their utmost honor and greatest power,\nDwell in solitude and fewness,\nReside in humility and simplicity,\nPursue what they seek yet flee what they desire,\nDiscard greatness for smallness,\nFind joy in lowliness and loss,\nLeave no trace when they act,\nNor any mark when they withdraw,\nAdvance in fortune and retreat in calamity,\nAct without doing, yet all things settle,\nObserve not, listen not,\nEmbrace *Harmony* (Hé) in stillness,\nGive birth to divine luminosity,\nTheir form and substance naturally upright,\nTheir advance and retreat in accordance with the *Way*,\nNever altering their course,\nTheir virtue soaring like the wind,\nTheir principles reaching all things,\nHeaven and Earth aiding them,\nAll things returning to them.\n\nLoss is gain.\nThe common people are not so—\nThey see and hear only what is already manifest.\nSeeing and hearing only manifest things,\nThey align with what has already come to pass,\nAnd fail to perceive the changes yet unseen,\nHence they value hardness and strength.\nWielding great authority and creating power,\nThey govern all affairs yet fail to restrain them,\nDispising softness and fewness,\nDistancing themselves from subtlety and the solitary,\nTheir actions clash with the *Way*,\nTheir stillness contradicts Heaven,\nDivine luminosity dissipates into turbidity,\nAll affairs arise in chaos,\nTheir thoughts confused and errant,\nTheir joys and angers unfounded,\nFortunes flee the door,\nCalamities enter the home,\nThe Heavenly Net descends—\nThey cannot escape it.\n\nGain is loss.\nThen suddenly calamity arises,\nAnd they awaken in sorrow,\nBow their heads in speech yet lower their words,\nOn the verge of death, they praise virtue.\nThough they wish to reform and renew,\nReturning to fewness and softness,\nIt comes too late, and they cannot be released,\nTheir path to life is distant,\nTheir nations shattered, their families ruined,\nTheir misfortunes extending to their descendants.\nHence, the teachings of the common people,\nTransform stupidity into wisdom,\nChange weakness into strength,\nAbandon subtlety for the manifest,\nDiscard concealment for display,\nFlout humility and compete for glory,\nAnd die in pursuit of honor and fame.\nThis is what people are taught.\n\nYet the teachings of the *Sage* (Shèngrén) are contrary to this:\nStupidity becomes wisdom,\nHumiliation becomes honor,\nSubtlety becomes manifest,\nConcealment becomes display,\nFewness becomes multitude,\nWeakness becomes strength.\nAbandon mind and intent,\nPursue the nameless,\nBe without knowing or recognizing,\nReturn to the *Mysterious Darkness* (Xuānmíng).\nPaths diverge, directions vary—\nSome persist, some perish.\n\nThe teachings of the *Sage* teach with fewness and softness;\nThe teachings of the common people teach with multitude and strength.\nWhat people are taught, I also teach—\nYet the teachings differ.\n\nHence, mighty Qin and great Chu,\nWith their strength and domination, were extinguished;\nDivine Han and the rise of the *Dragon* (Lóng),\nWith their harmony and compliance, flourished.\n\nThus, the strong stray from the *Way*,\nThe hard reject divine luminosity,\nAnd the ruler who seeks to live long\nMust retreat in order to endure.\nThe strong and hard\nCannot escape their fate.\n\nNot seeking within themselves,\nThey blame Heaven and fate,\nThe *Sage* pities them,\nAnd sets forth these teachings first,\nRecording them on bamboo and silk,\nClearly demonstrating them to later generations,\nSo that throughout their lives they may reflect upon them,\nAnd thus incur their own misfortunes.\nI shall make this my foundational teaching.\n\n**Chapter on the *Ultimate Softness* (Zhìróu):**\nThe *Ultimate Softness* is the most formless thing under Heaven,\nYet it overcomes the most rigid and solid things in the world.\nThe formless enters the *Gapless Chamber of Non-Action* (Wújiān Wúwéi shì),\nThus I know to see gain and loss.\nNon-action’s benefit is to preserve the original and cut off chaos;\nAction’s harm is to disrupt the original and sever life.\nThe teaching of the unsaid closes the door to calamity,\nNon-action’s benefit preserves all things,\nYet few under Heaven can attain it.\n\n**Pointing to the Return:**\n*Virtue* (Dé) and divine luminosity are the most subtle,\nYet they are the *guests* (Bīn) of divine luminosity.\nDivine luminosity is the external manifestation of *Virtue*,\nHence it is called *guest*.\n\nDivine luminosity is the most nonexistent,\nYet the *Great Harmony* is its *subject* (Chén).\nThe *Great Harmony* is the manifestation of divine luminosity’s work,\nHence it is called *subject*.\n\nPurity and turbidity, the *Great Harmony*,\nThe *Ultimate Softness*—formless,\nEnveloping Heaven and Earth,\nContaining Yin and Yang,\nGuiding all things,\nWithout fail maintaining their order.\n\nSome exist beyond the cosmos,\nSome dwell within Heaven,\nHumans and things borrow from it to be born,\nYet none can see or hear it.\n\nFollowing the *Way* through three transformations,\nAll things begin to form,\nHumans borrow from it to be born,\nYet none can truly know it.\n\nThe hair-fine is insufficient to name it,\nThe weak are insufficient to describe it—\nThe *Sage* names it with intent alone.\n\nHow the *Sage* is called *Sage*:\nAll *Sages* obtain their title\nBy studying the *Way* and preserving divine luminosity,\nCultivating life and safeguarding truth,\nAchieving truth and thus the *Way*,\nEnveloping Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis is the profound and essential thing,\nHence it cannot be named with intent alone.\nTherefore, it is called *Ultimate Softness*,\nAnd named *Formless*.\n\nThus, the formless thing\nIs not overcome by rigidity,\nNor by strength—\nHence it can wear down Heaven and Earth,\nConsume copper and iron,\nRace like the wind and lightning,\nSpan the poles and traverse sun and moon,\nCirculate above and below,\nPass through and linger without pause,\nSoar in stability,\nAnd descend into the formless.\n\nThings with form have solidity,\nThe *Void* without subtlety has no power.\nThe *Way*, neither existent nor nonexistent,\nCan thus uphold existence without obstruction.\n\nHow does one demonstrate its truth?\nThe echo is without sound yet cannot be exhausted,\nThe shadow is without form yet cannot be measured,\nWater, though soft and weak, pierces metal and stone,\nAnd sinks all things.\nEarth, though gentle and compliant, achieves great works,\nAnd surpasses grass and trees.»",

when the land is narrow and the people few,\nWith scant soldiers and meager provisions,\nWhen desires are subtle and intentions refined,\nWhen the spirit is bright and vigilant,\nAnd harmony aligns with Heaven—\n\nTo regard the people as one’s own children,\nWith virtue flourishing and transformation vast,\nWith deep benevolence and abundant grace,\nWhen officials are loyal and soldiers trustworthy,\nWhen the ruler worries and generals tremble,\nWhen softness accumulates and weakness endures,\nEver placing oneself last among the people,\nBearing shame and humiliation,\nThe state becomes a submissive female,\nYet the lords of the realm trust it,\nComparing it to an infant,\nAnd all under Heaven flock to it,\nAs though returning to parents.\n\nWhen the people share a single desire,\nAuthority and might arise naturally,\nThe strong cannot oppress,\nThe great cannot seize,\nFrom beginning to end, strength and weakness invert,\nHeaven and Earth lend their aid,\nThe spirit’s brilliance provides support,\nOpportunity arrives without constraint,\nAnd one becomes the master of all under Heaven.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause the *Way* is soft and weak,\nYet its essence is subtle and sparse.\n\nThus, when the land is vast and the people many,\nWhen the state is rich and its armies strong,\nWhen historians are bold and soldiers fierce,\nWhen the ruler commands with severity,\nWhen rewards are heavy and punishments sharp,\nWhen laws are rigid and punishments deep,\nWhen officials tremble before the sovereign,\nWhen advantage favors terrain and strategy,\nThe realm becomes the hero of the world,\nLightly provoking enemies and delighting in battle,\nEasily mobilizing troops,\nWhere cunning begets the extraordinary,\nWhere Heaven is defied and Earth is scorned,\nWhere lords submit in fear,\nNone dare resist,\nWhere terror shakes the borders,\nWhere one is always the model of excellence,\nWhere people fear and things tremble,\nWhere might shakes

collapses,\nWhere the lineage scatters and disperses.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause their essence is hard and rigid,\nAnd their greed and stinginess accumulate.\n\nThe *Way* manifests as the having of the non-existent,\nPassing through without obstruction,\nMoving without constraint,\nIlluminating the halls of contrivance,\nPurifying the chambers of non-action,\nEntering and exiting without boundary or fracture,\nTraveling through pearls and jade without trace.\n\nIt is said: the utmost softness\nOvercomes the utmost hardness.\nHow does one demonstrate this?\n\nSharp blades with form\nCannot pierce the formless.\nThe spirit, dwelling in the body,\nExits without obstruction,\nEnters without aperture—\nIn the blink of an eye,\nIt traverses thousands of miles.\nThere is no entering the formless.\n\nFrom this, it is said:\nAction brings ruin and no fruit,\nNon-action brings fulfillment without end.\nHeaven and Earth are thus formed,\nHumans and things are thus flourished.\nThe sound of sound is heard a hundred *li* away,\nThe sound of no-sound moves beyond Heaven,\nShaking the four seas.\n\nWhat is spoken of is spoken of—\nDifferent kinds cannot communicate.\nWhat is not spoken of—\nTransforms yin and yang,\nMakes Heaven and Earth respond.\n\nFor when virtue and the *Way* are in non-action,\nHeaven and Earth are completed.\nWhen Heaven and Earth do not speak,\nThe four seasons proceed.\nThese two things—\nThe signs of the spirit’s brilliance,\nThe verification of nature’s course.\n\nThus it is known that non-action is beneficial.\nTherefore, the sage empties the heart\nTo return to virtue and the *Way*,\nCalms the *qi* to preserve the spirit’s brilliance,\nDiminishes sharpness to hear the soundless,\nAbandons clarity to see the formless,\nObserves the transformations of Heaven and Earth,\nEncourages the natural course of all things,\nTo perceive how contrivance is the origin of chaos.\nHaving reached the function of non-action,\nOne naturally sees the disorder of contrivance.\n\nNon-action is the root of governance.\nSpeech is the doorway to calamity.\nNon-speech is the gate to blessing.\nThus, abandon wisdom and discard cleverness,\nEliminate benevolence and discard righteousness,\nAwaken the heart of the *Way*,\nExalt the intention of virtue,\nFollow the spirit and nurture harmony,\nEntrust oneself to Heaven and serve Earth,\nLet yin and yang fulfill their duties,\nLet the four seasons move freely,\nCut off the roots of chaos,\nLet things rest in their places,\nLet the ruler remain serene and unadorned,\nLet the people have no concerns.\n\nTeach with the speech of no-speech,\nTransform with the transformation of the untransformed,\nDemonstrate with the symbol of no-symbol,\nAnd return to the mysterious and profound,\nCover the people’s desires,\nFollow their nature and vital essence,\nMake the people ignorant,\nAnd they will live long and see far.\n\nThis is the teaching of no-speech.\n\nThus, when I speak not, Heaven and Earth act without contrivance,\nWhen Heaven and Earth act without contrivance, virtue and the *Way* act without contrivance.\nThese three harmonize and advance together,\nTheir *qi* blending and overflowing,\nGenerating great peace,\nGathering humans and things,\nUnifying the world within,\nClosing the door to calamity,\nMaking

      "translated_text": "The sovereign who does not speak yet embodies the Dao of non-action.\nThe key of non-action, the mechanism of speechlessness,\nLies in subtlety and refinement,\nResides in the divine and the profound.\n\nThe onset of the divine and profound,\nThe origin of subtlety and refinement,\nGives birth without root or stem,\nEmerges and retreats without gate or door.\nEver abiding between action and non-action,\nThe primal source of harmony,\nThe Dao, though formless and unseen,\nCan be known through its timely resonance.\n\nThus it may be heard yet never fully revealed,\nSeen yet never fully expounded,\nGrasped yet never fully transmitted,\nUtilized yet never fully spoken.\nTo seize and then shove away,\nTo hold fast and then relinquish—\nEasy for the wise sage to explain,\nDifficult for the shallow to comprehend.\n\nWhy so?\nBecause it is vast and profound yet common folk cannot reach it,\nBecause its lofty heights are inverted yet common folk cannot enter,\nBecause it is faint and diffuse yet the world cannot discern it,\nBecause it is obscure and hidden yet vulgar rulers cannot practice it.\n\nThe body’s name—who is closer, fame or self?\nSelf or wealth—what is more abundant?\nGain or loss—what is more harmful?\nThus extreme affection brings great depletion to the spirit,\nExcessive hoarding brings heavy ruin and retreat to the body.\n\nTherefore, knowing sufficiency prevents disgrace,\nKnowing cessation prevents peril,\nAnd the body may endure long,\nWith great vitality preserved.\n**Point of Return:**\n\nThat which I inherit by nature and am,\nIs virtue and power.\nThat which I borrow to live,\nIs the spirit’s brilliance.\nThat which I rely upon to flourish,\nIs the Great Harmony.\nThat which I entrust to take form,\nAre Heaven and Earth.\n\nAll these four—\nThey nourish me, yet I cannot nourish them.\nThus no law is higher than virtue and power,\nNo model is greater than the spirit’s brilliance,\nNo standard is broader than the Great Harmony,\nNo illumination is grander than Heaven and Earth.\n\nVirtue and power—\nEver living, never dying;\nHarmony of purity and turbidity—\nEndless transformation.\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth—\nPreserved yet hard to lose;\nThe workings of yin and yang—\nEver moving, hard to conclude.\n\nHeaven and Earth, yin and yang,\nBut seen in their difficulty to conclude,\nNot because they lack beginning or end.\nFrom this perspective,\nMisfortune reaches its extreme at death,\nFortune reaches its extreme at birth.\nThus the sage,\nAbove, traces the intent of virtue and power,\nBelow, measures the heart of Heaven and Earth,\nExalts and displays honor,\nInvokes auspiciousness and flourishing virtue,\nEmbraces depth and vastness,\nCultivates reverence and exhaustion,\nYet nothing surpasses the value of life.\n\nAll things arrayed,\nWonders and treasures,\nGold and jade, pearls and jade discs,\nTheir use profound yet their gain immense—\nNothing surpasses the body.\n\nThe artisan of worldly calamity,\nThe craftsman of national chaos,\nWho defies Heaven and Earth,\nWho harms the body—\nNothing surpasses the name.\n\n**Extreme

appears deficient;\nthough gaining, it seems like loss.\nWithout bells and drums, the people rejoice;\nwithout five flavors, their food is sweet;\nwithout adornments, their beauty is natural;\nwithout hoarding, their abundance overflows.\n\nWhy is this so?\nFollowing the Dao, trusting Heaven, not relying on knowledge—\nthus the people act naturally.\n\nThough the Five Emperors seemed unworthy,\neach achieved greatness.\nThe enlightened ruler, through the Dao, transforms people,\nmaking them align with the Way.\n\nHeaven and Earth’s Way—\nadvancing and retreating in turn—\nall things thereby flourish.\nTransformation is unobstructed,\nflexing and extending cannot be barred.\n\nWhen yin reaches its peak,\nthe earth splits and ice congeals,\ncold winds howl, frost descends thick,\nfish and turtles burrow deep,\nall things curl in fear.\nYet in this time,\ndwelling in warm chambers,\nbeside blazing fires,\nwearing thick furs and layered silks—\nstill, one cannot

cold.*\n\nWhen yang reaches its peak,\nsand is seared, stones crumble,\nbirds take flight, water creatures flee,\nall things wither, rivers dry up.\nYet in this time,\nplunging into cool springs,\nwearing coarse linen,\ndwelling in high halls,\nwearing cold stones—\nstill, one cannot endure it.\nBut when the heart releases, the mind clears,\nwhen the spirit drifts beyond the four seas,\nwhen the will wanders in the void,\nwhen breath and heart align—\ncoolness pervades the body.\n*Stillness overcomes heat.*\n\nThus, knowing how to act is a craft—\ngoverning people, nurturing life,\nvirtue extending to Heaven and Earth,\nachievement matching yin and yang.\nYet when chaos arises,\nit emerges without form,\nstirs without sound,\nexpanding with governance,\nshifting with transformation.\nIt seizes people like dampness,\nreaches them like shadow—\nresponding like echoes to speech,\nnever leaving their forms.\nThe more one acts, the greater the disorder;\nthe more one governs, the more tangled the affairs.\nEven the wise cannot lead,\neven harsh punishments cannot restrain.\n\nYet the *non-acting* ruler\nis the sovereign of action,\nthe origin of governance and transformation,\nwhose removal of calamity\nis like agitation overcoming cold\nor stillness overcoming heat.\n\nThus the sage abandons knowledge, abandons scheming,\nempties the heart, focuses the breath,\nclears and stills, responding naturally—\nthen Heaven’s will aligns,\nEarth’s intent follows,\ngovernance rises, transformation flows like sunlight,\ncalamity vanishes like dispersing clouds.\nThe world follows its example without limit,\nall things learn from it without restraint.\n\nThis is called *able to clear, able to still—\nthe world naturally rectifies

      "translated_text": "When calamity and harm befall,\ngreat sores erupt as rashes,\nbroken bones are set and bound,\nevery joint and orifice\nfulfills its natural desire.\n\nYet even in slumber,\none still finds fleeting peace—\nhow much more so when\none embodies the Dao and forgets the self,\never at ease.\n\nFor with a single body,\nto abandon thought is to turn peril into safety,\nto employ thought is to risk losing what is secure—\nhow much more so for those\nwho uphold virtue and Dao,\nalign with the numinous and bright,\nfollow Heaven’s intent,\nand nurture all living beings?\n\nNurturing all living beings\nrequires above all a tranquil mind.\n\nThus, the Sage establishes\na body without a body,\na heart without a heart,\na presence within absence,\na trust in what is not stored—\nabove, encompassing the transformation of virtue and Dao,\nbelow, embracing the hearts of all people.\n\nThe Sage has no heart,\nyet takes the hearts of the people as their own.\n\nNeither hating nor loving,\nneither favoring nor rejecting,\nnot feuding with the wicked,\nnot befriending the fortunate,\nnot consorting with the sincere,\nnot resenting the deceitful.\n\nBearing them as the earth bears all,\ncovering them as Heaven does,\nilluminating them as the sun,\ntransforming them as the numinous.\n\nFor humanity’s delusion\nhas endured for ages.\nTo suddenly make the unvirtuous virtuous—\nhow could it be so swift?\n\nOne must first comfort and soften them,\nlet them seek it themselves,\nimmerse and moisten them,\nlet them find it themselves—\nonly then may their clarity grow,\ntheir sincerity take root,\ntheir desires align,\ntheir hearts transform.\n\nThus it is said:\nbear them as the earth bears all,\ncover them as Heaven does,\nilluminate them as the sun,\ntransform them as the numinous.\n\nWhether great or small,\nall things are viewed as the self.\nAct before action begins,\ngovern before disorder arises,\ncutting off misfortune at its source,\nawakening fortune from its origin.\n\nBlock gradual corruption,\nprevent evil’s sprouting,\nsuppress vice and promote virtue.\n\nAbandon my desires,\ntake what brings the people ease;\nabandon my scheming,\nreturn to what is natural.\n\nLet nature allow all things to find ease,\nso the people live unaware in their daily lives.\n\nMove them with harmony,\nguide them with spontaneity,\nabove containing the intent of virtue and Dao,\nbelow attaining the heart of the numinous and bright,\nilluminating Heaven and Earth,\nconnecting virtue to all people.\n\nThe people bear no burdens,\nthe ruler holds no grievances,\nall find their true nature,\nall retain their vital essence.\nSeeing nothing, hearing nothing,\nforgetting their refined thoughts,\ntaking the ruler as their heart.\n\nWhen the ruler embodies the Dao,\ncovering people with the Way,\nthe people receive the ruler’s grace\nas if it were their own.\n\nTheir hearts follow the ruler,\nlike children returning to their mother.\nBowing, rising, resting, waking—\nall move as if in a marketplace.\n\nWith them in bowing and rising,\nwith them in floating and sinking,\nfollowing their external stirrings,\nreleasing their flexing and bending—\nwithout speaking, the world responds;\nwithout acting, all things endure.\nWithin the four seas,\nno commands are given,\nyet all transform their hearts.\n\nThe virtuous reach great virtue,\ntheir clarity deepening daily.\nThe wicked’s nature shifts,\ngradually becoming serene.\n\nSo-called unvirtuous—\nI also treat them with virtue,\nthus they attain virtue.\n\nThe trustworthy become utterly trustworthy,\nreaching beyond self-interest.\nThe deceitful’s nature transforms,\ndaily approaching sincerity.\n\nThe untrustworthy—\nI also treat them with trust,\nthus they attain trust.\n\nThe cruel and destructive return to virtue,\nthe deceitful return to truth.\nVirtue and vice, trust and doubt—\nall return to their natural state.\n\nThe reason the Way repeatedly returns to nature\nis that the ultimate Dao stands independent and profound,\nexisting since antiquity.\nIts power acts upon all things,\nyet all things cannot act upon it—\nthus it is called *natural*.\n\nNot that insects and birds\nare the ultimate measure.\n\nThose who embody this natural Dao\ncan harmonize with the dust of the world,\nstand without sharp edges,\nlet things transform of their own accord,\nall returning to virtue.\nAdvancing their singular will,\nas if by nature’s own impulse.\n\nAs the Sage says:\n*\"Without speaking, I nourish people with harmony.\"*\n\nAt such times,\nthe world is submerged in boundless unity,\ndrenched in supreme harmony.\nThe people forget their thoughts,\nlost in a daze of floating ease,\nlosing what they hated,\ngaining what they sought,\nmoving with Heaven,\nflowing with the Dao—\nnot driven by coercion to abandon vice,\nnot bound by teaching to change.\n\nThrough *wuwei*, transformation occurs unknowingly.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe ruler’s transformation\nis empty, still, and silent,\nlike withered wood,\nthe heart like a hollowed gourd,\nthe will like the sea,\nactions like valleys—\nnot distinguishing east and west,\nnot separating south and north,\nnot judging sweet and bitter,\nnot favoring white and black,\nnot enforcing square or round,\nnot fixing straight or crooked,\ndelving into the mysterious,\nstriving to remain hidden.\n\nAs the Sage says:\n*\"Awakened, awakened—\nfor all under Heaven, I muddle their hearts.\"*\n\nWithout governing things,\nfloating without end,\nabandoning what I would do,\nembracing what Heaven would gain,\nall things in tumult—\nall pour into their ears and eyes.\n\nAs the Sage says:\n*\"The people all pour into their ears and eyes.\"*\n\nThe ruler’s *wuwei*\nis serene, composed—\nHeaven and Earth as the furnace,\nGreat Harmony as the bellows,\nthe numinous as the wind,\nall things as the iron,\nvirtue as the master craftsman,\nthe Dao as the work—\nthe world verdant and lush,\nnothing left unmoistened.\n\nThe Sage contains such transformative power,\nthus able to benefit all things endlessly.\n\nThus can they mold the people’s hearts,\ntransform the customs of the age,\nabove encompassing all,\nbelow conquering all,\nperfecting all things,\nnothing left unmeasured,\nstirring all living beings,\nshaking the eight extremes.\n\nThe world is vast and indistinct,\nunaware of good and evil,\ndarkly effective, obscure in form,\nself-forming in law.\n\nThe Sage stirs all things,\nreturning them to the Dao,\nfollowing what is fitting to establish law.\n\n---\n**出生入死章**\n**Birth and Death**\n\nBirth and death,\nabandoning *wuwei*.\n\nThose who cling to life—thirteen types—\nare heavy with false

      "translated_text": "「They are called the disciples of death.\n\nThus, the practitioners of **life mastery** [摄生], with their lofty and boundless Dao/Way, stand apart in grandness and transcend the mundane, soaring far beyond the world’s constraints. They do not cling to the **customs of the masses** [俗], nor are they bound by the **affairs of the world** [世]. They diminish their **form** [形] in the **boundless** [无境], and let their **spirit** [神] drift in the **void** [无内]. They do not regard life as gain, nor death as harm. Their **comprehensive cultivation** [兼施] knows no limits—all things, great or small, are seen as the self, with neither aversion nor attachment. Their **spirit and virtue/power** [精神隆盛] are vast and harmonious, their blessings and **virtue/power** [福德] converge naturally. The Dao/Way is their central sovereign, its radiance visible without. In accordance with **natural transformations** [自然之变], they respond effortlessly—nothing in heaven, earth, or all things can defeat them.\n\nWhen they walk on land, **rhino-beasts and tigers** [兕虎] cannot harm them; when they enter battle, the **five weapons** [五兵] cannot wound them. No added strength can conquer them, nor can any thrown force subdue them—**their spirit and qi** [神气] are in perfect accord, and the intent to harm is already nullified within.\n\nFor those skilled in **life mastery** [摄生], their actions are such that, with no love or hate for all things, they view each thing as if it were their own body. Thus, all things respond in kind, returning affection without malice, as **natural law** [理数] must.\n\nLike shadows following form, it is not by **skill or technique** [法术] that they manipulate form, but by its inherent nature.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause **sounds echo in response** [声响相应], and **things follow their kind** [物从其类]. **Rhino-beasts and tigers** [兕虎] cannot harm the **formless** [无形], and the **five weapons** [五兵] cannot strike the **void of substance** [无质]. The practitioners of **life mastery** [摄生] have already extinguished the **thief’s or harmer’s intent** [贼害之心] within, and the **forms of death and injury** [死伤之形] vanish without.\n\nThus, **tigers have no place to set their claws** [虎无所措其爪], and **weapons find no opening for their blades** [兵无所容其刃], for they possess **no ground of death** [无死地]—this truth is not hollow.\n\n**Dao/Way generates brilliance** [道生章]\nThe **inherent nature** [禀] of things born from the Dao/Way,\nThe **virtue/power** [德] bestowed that grants life to all things.\nThe **forms** [物形] of all things vary in every direction,\nThe **fulfillment of effort** [势成] that completes their shapes.\n\nThus, all things attain life through this,\nAnd those who **honor the Dao/Way and value virtue/power** [尊道贵德] are like **sages and worthies** [视宗正].\nThe Dao/Way is honored, virtue/power is valued—**grand and flourishing** [高大盛].\nNone can confer titles upon it, for its name is **constant naturalness** [常自然].\nThe Dao/Way’s **generation of life** [道生] leaves nothing unborn,\nIts **virtue/power’s nurturing** [德畜] leaves nothing incomplete.\nIt **lengthens** [长] without fail,\nIt **nourishes** [育] without rest,\nIt **completes** [成] without end,\nIt **ripens** [熟] without error,\nIt **sustains** [养] without harm,\nIt **covers** [覆] without concealment.\n\nTo **give birth without possession** [生而不有] is to do so without **hoarding** [赀],\nTo **act without reliance** [为而不恃] is to do so without **intent** [所为].\nTo **lengthen without slaughter** [长而不宰] is to do so without **purpose** [以为].\nThis is called the **mysterious virtue/power** [玄德], which **virtue/power does not know** [德不知].\n\n**Pointing to the return** [指归]:\nThe **sage’s wisdom** [圣知] unfolds—\nNot from the **heavens and earth** [天下],\nNor by **earthly means** [地出],\nBut **inherent within the body** [内在於身],\nAnd **manifest in all things** [外在於物].\nGuided by **natural law** [自然], it permeates without limit.\nFollowing **patterns and effects** [因循效象], it is inexhaustible.\n\nThus, the Dao/Way is **formless** [虚], virtue/power is **voidless** [无],\nYet they do not lose their **heart** [心].\nHeaven is **exalted** [尊], earth is **lowly** [卑],\nYet they do not violate their **principles** [节].\n\nWhy?\nBecause **knowing arises from the void** [有知无],\nAnd **human discernment follows things** [由人识物].\nThings of the same **kind** [类], when **voidless** [无], give rise to **possession** [有];\nThe **formless** [虚] generates the **solid** [实].\nTo **perceive subtlety and know its manifestation** [见微知着],\nTo **observe beginnings and foresee endings** [观始睹卒],\nIs not a matter of **clever skill** [巧能],\nBut the **natural workings of things** [自然之物], which the **sage follows** [圣人因之],\nIn **harmony with heaven** [与天周密].\n\nThus, **knowing the Dao/Way through its ultimate formlessness** [太虚之虚],\nThey **draw from nothingness** [无所不禀].\nThis is the **inherent nature of things** [物性].\n\n**Understanding virtue/power through its supreme voidlessness** [至无之无],\nThey **bestow without limit** [无所不授].\nThis is the **granting of life** [授物命].\n\nThe Dao/Way **acts without possession** [无为之为],\nIts **manifestation** [品] in all directions has no **beginning** [首].\nTo **act without possession** [为而不有].\n\nVirtue/power **sets without attachment** [无设之设],\nIt **fulfills the forms of all things** [遂万物之形] without **doing** [事].\nTo **complete without claiming** [成功不居].\n\nThus, they can **refine life and destiny** [陶性命],\n**Regulate feelings and thoughts** [治情意],\n**Shape resolve and cravings** [造志欲],\nAnd **transform all affairs** [化万事].\n\nWhat are **life, nature, feelings, thoughts, resolve, and cravings** [性命情意志欲]?\nAsk of the **differences among these six** [六者之差].\n\nThat which is **inherited from the Dao/Way** [所禀於道] and forms **body and shape** [成形体],\nVaries in every direction—**all things and beings** [人物],\n**Male and female** [男女], **sage’s contemplation and bold daring** [圣虑、勇怯],\n**Small and great, long and short** [小大、修短],\n**Kindness and meanness, greed and cruelty** [仁廉、贪酷],\n**Strength and weakness, lightness and heaviness** [强弱、轻重],\n**Sounds and colors, appearance and substance** [声色、状貌],\n**Refinement and coarseness, high and low** [精粗、高下]—\nThis is called **nature** [性].\nAll this is **inherited from the Dao/Way** [禀於道],\nArises from within, and **never changes** [终焉不变].\n\nThat which is **bestowed by virtue/power** [所授於德],\nRiches and poverty, **early death and longevity, suffering and joy** [夭寿苦乐],\nSome encounters are **fitting**, others **unfitting** [有宜不宜]—\nThis is called **heavenly destiny** [天命].\nAll this is **received from virtue/power** [受於德],\nComes from without, and **progress or retreat is in my hands** [进退由我].\n\nTo **meet with rulers and parents** [遭遇君父],\nThe **movements of heaven and earth** [天地之动],\nTo **encounter fortune or misfortune** [逆顺昌衰],\nTo **face life or death** [存亡及我]—\nThis is called **encountered destiny** [遭命].\nIt is **fortuitous** [偶然], not **fixed** [非常定].\n\nWhen **all things are arranged** [万物陈列],\nAnd I **undertake affairs** [将有事],\nTo **deploy or abandon** [举错废置],\nTo **take or leave, approach or withdraw** [取舍去就],\nWhen **auspicious or inauspicious events come** [吉凶来],\nWhen **calamity or fortune arrives** [祸福至]—\nThis is called **following destiny** [随命].\nIt is **obtained by my actions** [随我所为].\n\nTo **move from nature and destiny** [因性而动],\nTo **interact with things and awaken** [接物感寤],\nTo **love or hate, like or dislike** [爱恶、好憎],\nTo **startle or fear, rejoice or anger** [惊恐、喜怒],\nTo **grieve or delight, worry or rage** [悲乐、忧恚],\nTo **advance or retreat, take or give** [进退、取与]—\nThis is called **feelings** [情].\nThey arise from **nature** [性], and come **unconsciously** [不觉而至].\n\nTo **act from destiny** [因命而动],\nTo **generate thought and deliberation** [生思虑],\nTo **establish plans and strategies** [定计谋],\nTo **judge safety and peril** [决安危],\nTo **understand all affairs** [通万事],\nTo **discern right and wrong** [明是非],\nTo **differentiate the same and the different** [别同异]—\nThis is called **thought** [意].\nIt moves **along with destiny** [缘命], and is **by my doing** [由我所为].\n\nTo **stem from feelings and thoughts** [因於情意],\nTo **move outward and connect with things** [动而之外],\nTo **always find delight** [与物相连，常有所悦],\nTo **summon fortune or misfortune** [招麾祸福],\nTo **accomplish fame and achievement** [功名所遂]—\nThis is called **resolve** [志].\nThe **movement of nature and destiny** [性命之动] leads to **feelings and thoughts** [情意],\nAnd from these, **resolve is strengthened** [因而自强].\n\nTo **align with nature and destiny** [顺性命],\nTo **fit with feelings and thoughts** [适情意],\nTo **be drawn by diverse kinds** [牵於殊类],\nTo **be bound by all affairs** [系於万事],\nTo **form attachments that are hard to untie** [结而难解]—\nThis is called **craving** [欲].\nThough **craving arises from feelings and thoughts** [出乎情意],\nIt **exceeds nature and destiny** [侈於性命],\nAnd **must not be indulged** [不可纵].\n\nAll these six—**nature, destiny, feelings, thoughts, resolve, and craving** [性命情意志欲]—\nAre **rooted in virtue/power and the Dao/Way** [原道德],\nAnd **thousandfold transformations** [千变万化] know no end.\nOnly those who **hear of virtue/power and the Dao/Way** [闻道德者] can follow their **principles** [则].\n\nThe **Dao/Way is the principle** [则], and **those who attain the principle** [得本者]\nMove freely in **advance and retreat**, unshackled by **feelings and cravings** [情欲].\n\n**Nature is refined, destiny is high** [性精命高],\nIt can be **transformed or altered** [可变可易].\n**Nature is coarse, destiny is low** [性粗命下],\nIt can be **diminished or enhanced** [可损可益].\nIf one **grasps the root and principle** [得根本],\nThey

their virtue/power.\nAttaining the completion of the **One**,\nThe **One** requires no thanks—\nThis is called *\"when principle reaches its utmost, opposites vanish.\"*\n\nWhy is this so?\nThe **Dao/Way** is lofty and its virtue/power vast,\nDeep beyond words—\nThings cannot enrich it,\nTitles cannot exalt it.\nIt acts without doing,\nYet all things act through it.\nIt is not forced by anything,\nYet nature remains ever spontaneous.\n\nIt acts without acting toward things,\nYet things act through it without contrivance—\nPrinciple and law move as they must,\nNot compelled by things to do so.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** as a thing:\nLooked upon, it has no door,\nExamined, it has no gate,\nProbed, it has no form,\nMapped, it has no shape.\nMind cannot exhaust it,\nSpeech cannot convey it.\nAll things are born through it,\nYet it is not diminished by them.\nAll things return to it,\nYet it is not filled by them.\n\nAbove and below, it knows no end,\nBroad and vast without boundary.\nEbbing and flowing, curving and bending—\nIts measure cannot be fathomed.\nIt plays in the autumn hair’s breadth,\nYet is not deemed small;\nIt encompasses all heavens,\nYet is not deemed great.\nIts radiance shines like emerald and purple,\nYet it does not alter its resolve.\nIn darkness and decay,\nIt does not change its nature—\nThis is called **constancy**.\n\nIt moves without exertion,\nHolds no favorites.\nIt bestows nature and destiny,\nYet does nothing in particular.\n\nIts virtue/power flows through all things,\nYet cannot be reclaimed;\nIts grace binds and its blessings endure,\nYet cannot be returned.\n**Dao/Way** and virtue/power lend and give birth,\nLike the sound of a *tuóluò* flute—\nQi issues forth endlessly,\nNever to be recovered.\n\nIt gazes upon all under heaven without depletion,\nAchieves and completes without exhaustion.\nToward all things, does it merely give life?\nIt shapes them, establishes them, arranges them into ranks,\nStops them to perfect them,\nEnds them to begin anew,\nLeads them to follow or precede.\n\nLike water to fish—\nLife, form, beginning, and end,\nNever parting for an instant.\nIt both follows and precedes,\nWith spirit dwelling within,\nGreat Harmony preserved.\nThe clear ascends to accumulate,\nThe turbid descends to congeal.\nHeaven is round through it,\nEarth is square through it.\nYin finds its yin,\nYang finds its yang.\nSun and moon shine through it,\nStars move through it.\nThe four seasons transform through it,\nThe Five Phases overcome one another through it.\n\nFire burns through it,\nWater chills through it.\nGrasses and trees bend through it,\nMetals and stones harden through it.\nFlavors are sweet or bitter through it,\nColors are dark or bright through it.\nSounds rise or fall through it,\nChanges stretch or contract through it.\nMountains and hills stagnate through it,\nWinds and rains move through it.\nScaled creatures swim through it,\nFeathered creatures fly through it.\nBeasts run through it,\nHumans gain wisdom through it.\nDiverse kinds and races all exist through it,\nYet perish when they oppose its transformations.\n\nAll heavens differ in form,\nWaters and lands vary in shape,\nCustoms clash, benefits and harms diverge,\nAppearance and desire are deceptive,\nIntentions and cravings are incomprehensible.\nEven yin and yang cannot reach them,\nSun and moon cannot illuminate them—\nAll begin and end through it.\n\nOpening the mouth, stretching the eyes,\nBending, tilting, bowing, or rising—\nIn the space of a breath,\nIn the space of inhaling and exhaling,\nWhere spirit traverses,\nWhere mind and intention dwell,\nWhere love and attraction take hold,\nWhere male and female transform—\nIt guides all things,\nDoes all things,\nGives life without claiming reward,\nActs without demanding return,\nNurtures without possession.\n\nAll under heaven is bewildered,\nNone can know it.\nDark and silent, formless and empty,\nYet it gives birth and completes—\nNot like the boundless void,\nFor long has humanity been deluded,\nThus they do not recognize it.\n\nSome say:\n**\"Dao/Way** is the divine mystery of heaven and earth;\nHeaven and earth are the manifestation of **Dao/Way**.\"\n\nOthers claim:\n**\"Dao/Way** is the function of heaven and earth,\nHeaven and earth are the substance of **Dao/Way**.\"\nThis is the shortsightedness of a gnat in a jar,\nThe limited wisdom of lice in clothing—\nUnfit to speak of the **Dao/Way**.\n\nHow may this be made clear?\n**Dao/Way** encompasses all heavens.\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"Heaven and earth have their kinds,\nYet **Dao/Way** has no form.\nThings with kinds all have limits,\nThings without form know no end.*\nTo entrust the limited to the boundless\nIs like grasses and trees torn from the earth,\nOr stars torn from the sky—\nInsufficient to illustrate it.\n\nYet to say otherwise\nIs to fail to grasp\nHow having and not-having embrace,\nHow emptiness and reality contain each other—\nLike the rind of a gourd,\nUnaware of the tendrils’ neighboring growth,\nOr lice hiding in fur,\nUnaware of the multitude in the city.\n\nThus, beyond the cosmos yet within its domain,\nUnconstrained by any prohibition,\nBound by no regulation—\nSafety and peril, ebb and flow,\nKnow no inside or outside.\nAll follow the same wind,\nPoint in the same direction,\nHarmonious and obedient to its decree,\nPerfect and unblemished,\nWithout flaw or ruin.\nTen thousand blessings abound—\n**Dao/Way** covers them all.\nIts deeds are mysterious, its work hidden,\nUnrevealed to the world.\nAll under heaven sees it not,\nYet it never ceases to act.\n\nIt responds without being seen—\nIf seen, it is not true.\nIts constant speech never reaches,\nIts extraordinary nature cannot be recognized.\nThis is called **mysterious virtue/power**,\nVirtue/power that aids without end.\n\n---\n**The Beginning of All Under Heaven**\nAll under heaven has a **beginning**—\nA **non-doing body** that is the mother of all things,\nThe root of ten thousand beings.\nHaving obtained its mother,\nIt holds to spontaneity—\nThus it knows its offspring:\nAll things arise without intervention.\nHaving known its offspring,\nIt never strays—\nThus it returns to its mother,\nReverting to its origin.\nDeath does not bring peril,\nLife ends in tranquility.\n\nSeal its senses—\nEyes and ears are darkened,\nIts doors and openings are closed—\nNo speech all its life,\nNo toil or labor—\nThis is ease.\n\nOpen its senses—\nEars and eyes are sharp,\nIts affairs are accomplished,\nIts fame and deeds are manifest—\nYet its life is unsalvageable.\n\nSeeing the small is called **clarity**—\nPerceiving what has not yet sprouted.\nHolding to softness is called **strength**—\nHarmony as constancy.\n\nUsing its light—\nSpirit moves outward,\nReturning to its clarity—\nSpirit moves inward.\nNo harm befalls the body—\nThis is not greatness,\nBut donning the **Dao/Way’s** ordinary garb,\nFollowing its decrees.\n\n---\n**Pointing to the Return:**\nThe **Dao/Way** as a thing—\nFormless, shapeless,\nWithout mind or intention,\nYet never forgets or ponders,\nWithout knowledge or

arise,\nNot even the greatest calamity can approach.\nSeeing the small is called **clarity**—\nThus evil ceases, good prevails.\n\nActing and refining,\nCutting off speech, extinguishing

transformations,\nKill and give life to all beings,\nAnd all things cannot escape them.\n\nIf the Dao **releases** and **returns** to cleverness,\nThen the body cannot preserve itself,\nAnd how could Heaven and Earth be shaped,\nOr yin and yang be realized?\n\nIf Heaven and Earth **release** and **return** to cleverness,\nThen the body cannot sustain itself,\nAnd how could transformations be embraced,\nOr all things be fully nurtured?\n\nThis so-called **naturalness**,\nLike water naturally moistening below,\nFire naturally blazing upward—\nWithin their inherent nature,\nIt is not a matter of contrivance.\n\nThus, **emptiness** and **non-action**,\n**non-knowledge** and **non-desire**—\nThe heart of **virtue/power** and the intent of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Clarity** and **stillness** mirroring the **form**,\n**Non-action** responding to circumstances—\nThe movement of **virtue/power** and the transformation of Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Virtue/power** responds to circumstances,\nHeaven and Earth move and transform—\nLike images within a mirror,\nEchoes in empty space—\nThis is no difficult matter.\n\nHow does one know this?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"What the Dao produces, Heaven nurtures,\nBeginning without beginning,\nGiving life without giving life,\nPreserving without preserving,\nDestroying without destroying.\nThat which has no beginning, no giving life,\nNo preserving, no destroying—\nThis is the origin of **virtue/power**.*\n\nAll these things,\nAre the **verifications** of naturalness,\nThe **constants** of transformation.\n\nThus, when a person’s actions do not align with the Dao,\nThe Dao does not favor them;\nWhen they do not align with **virtue/power**,\n**Virtue/power** does not aid them;\nWhen they do not align with Heaven,\nHeaven does not shelter them;\nWhen they do not align with Earth,\nEarth does not bear them.\n\nWhat the Dao does not favor,\nWhat **virtue/power** does not aid,\nWhat Heaven does not shelter,\nWhat Earth does not bear—\nThis is where calamities linger,\nAnd blessings never draw near.\n\nPeople draw **qi** from **virtue/power**,\nTake form from Heaven and Earth—\nIf their actions do not align with the Dao,\nThey naturally find no peace,\nThus blessings recede daily,\nAnd misfortunes approach.\n\nTherefore, the **mysterious sages** and **recluses**,\nBearing the Dao and embracing its **completeness**,\nLifting **insight** and grasping **clarity**,\nAligning with the Dao and honoring **virtue/power**,\nDiscarding cleverness and abandoning the body,\nGrasping their resolve with dread,\nOnly fearing to stumble and fall.\n\nThus they strive for **cleverness** that is not clever,\nPursue **clarity** that is not clear,\nTrust in softness and weakness,\nTilling the land for their sustenance,\nEver content with moderation,\nReturning to the **nameless**,\nTrembling with fear,\nLest they lose **naturalness**,\nAnd their misfortunes extend to Heaven and Earth,\nAffecting all people.\n\nThose who, with knowledge and clarity,\nConduct themselves in the Great Dao—\nOnly fear **Shi**.\n\nThus auspicious responses and blessings arrive,\nLike shadows following form,\nEchoes answering sound,\nWithout expectation or prearrangement,\nArising as if born together—\nHence the Great Dao is vast and smooth,\nIts transformation formless,\nLike something distant yet near,\nLike something dim yet bright.\n\nSimple and vast without blemish,\nConcise yet easy to follow,\nAchieving success without contrivance,\nAttaining blessings without effort—\nHeaven and Earth follow it,\nAnd all things come to life from it.\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and smooth.\n\nYet people turn away from it,\nUsing their cleverness,\nEmbracing deceit and neglecting the Dao,\nReversing Earth and defying Heaven,\nExalting knowledge and valuing cleverness,\nCheating spirits and mocking gods,\nAdorning false governance with perversion,\nPursuing deceit while abandoning truth,\nInventing customs and altering institutions,\nCreating affairs and accomplishing deeds.\n\nPeople delight in narrow paths.\n\nPalaces are grand, gates towering high,\nAdorned with bizarre embellishments,\nLayered with colorful patterns—\nCleverness as their foundation,\nCunning as their measure.\n\nMorning is pristine, yet deception is their axe,\nFalsehood is their adze—\nWielding schemes and manipulating numbers,\nWeaving fine cloth while exploiting labor,\nNeglecting fields, letting weeds and pests flourish,\nHarvests failing, granaries empty.\n\nFields are overgrown, granaries are empty.\n\nGarments flash with five colors,\nSilks and brocades in dark yellows,\nFine linen and delicate embroidery,\nSmooth as deer, radiant as phoenixes.\n\nWearing garments of five colors.\n\nSharp blades and sturdy armor,\nMighty crossbows and powerful bows,\nLight chariots and swift steeds,\nMany reckless and fierce warriors.\n\nWealth is heavy, status honored,\nPower and influence prevail—\nSlaughtering without restraint,\nSubjugating the common folk,\nJealous of the upright, resentful of the generous,\nHating loyalty, poisoning trust,\nBinding with evil, joining with falsehood,\nHarming the good, nurturing enmity,\nValuing contention and martial prowess—\nNone they do not oppress,\nForcing borders to expand,\nEver plotting to assassinate rulers.\n\nWearing swords of slaughter.\n\nFeasts overflow with five flavors,\nPests swarm in abundance,\nCutting into wombs, killing unborn—\nA defiance of Heaven’s intent,\nEver drunk and gluttonous,\nTaking without

in tumultuous times,\nPraised as a great sage—\nThis is called **theft of glory**.\n\nExceeding the crowd in vice, great in evil,\nCrimes heavy, calamities deep,\nThe virtuous father does not rear them,\nThe enlightened ruler does not employ them,\nThe Dao does not favor them,\nThe spirits do not dwell with them,\nHeaven does not shelter them,\nAll things hold them in hatred.\n\nIf one is thus,\nTo lose them is to invite calamity,\nTo keep them is to invite ruin,\nTheir bodies unprotected,\nTheir misfortunes extending to descendants—\nAll through un-Dao ways.\n\n**On Establishing Virtue Properly**\nThose who establish well do not falter—\nThey stand firm through the Dao.\nThose who embrace well do not slip—\nThey hold fast through virtue.\nTheir descendants’ sacrifices never cease—\nThe world knows no end.\n\nCultivated in the self, its virtue becomes true—\n**Nurturing life and breath.**\nCultivated in the family, it governs kindness and abundance—\nIts virtue overflows, benefiting kin.\nCultivated in the village, it orders roles and duties—\nIts virtue endures, conquering all.\nCultivated in the state, it establishes laws and norms—\nIts virtue flourishes, free from slander and treachery.\nCultivated in the world, it sets standards and models—\nIts virtue is universal, all under heaven in service.\n\nThus, by observing the self, one knows other selves,\nBy observing the family, one knows other families,\nBy observing the village, one knows other villages,\nBy observing the state, one knows other states,\nBy observing the world, one knows the

customs, myriad creatures great and small,\nEndless transformations, benefits and harms deceitfully entwined—\nThus, the able cannot control the unable,\nAnd the unable cannot act where the able cannot.\n\nI act for the world, yet the world also acts for me.\nWhen I and it meet, if I am few and it many,\nTo meet many with few—\nThe many grow secure, the few grow perilous.\n\nThus, if one establishes by strength, others will seize it;\nIf one establishes by cunning, others will counter it;\nIf one establishes by force, others will threaten it.\nOnly by doing nothing can one not be defeated.\n\nHow does this manifest?\nSilent, yet seeking echoes—\nEchoes do not answer me.\nTrusting shadow to follow shade—\nShadow does not follow me.\nYet fearing echoes, I strike the bell—\nEchoes answer louder than before.\nHating shadows, I stand in the sun—\nShadows cling to me more fiercely.\n\nFrom this, it is clear:\nNon-action cannot evade blessing,\nAction cannot escape misfortune.\n\nThus, the sage abandons strength,\nAbandons cunning,\nAbandons knowledge,\nAbandons virtue—\nEstablishes the Dao, embraces virtue,\nHarbors essence, nurtures spirit,\nHarmonizes the body, follows weakness,\nSteps upon the Earth, bears Heaven.\n**This is the unshaken foundation.**\n\nEmpty, still, and quiet,\nAs if absent yet present,\nInner and outer both silent,\nTransforming in the Mysterious,\nDoing nothing, yet nothing undone,\nReturning to simplicity, embracing truth,\nWithout laws or measures,\nYet aligned with transformation.\n\n**This is the unbroken embrace.**\n\nNurturing the small to sustain the great,\nTending the myriad people,\nOrdering square and round, precedence and sequence,\nEver abiding with the body,\nUpright in form, serene in spirit,\nTransmitting lineage to descendants.\nDescendants’ sacrifices never cease.\n\nVirtue accumulates, transforming and flowing,\nEndless, ebbing and swelling with Heaven.\nCultivated in the self, its virtue is true—\n**Life’s vitality thrives, the body light and strong,**\nBeauty enduring yet untamed.\n\nCultivated in the family,\nHusbands trustworthy, wives chaste,\nFathers merciful, children filial,\nBrothers obedient, younger siblings respectful,\nNine clans harmonious and affectionate,\nFarming and silk-reeling timely,\nStorehouses abundant,\nLivestock thriving,\nAffairs prosperous, wealth ever sufficient,\nNeighbors envy their fortune.\n\nCultivated in the family, its virtue overflows.\n\nCultivated in the village,\nClear distinctions in governance,\nActions aligned with harmony,\nNames and realities correct,\nBlack and white distinct,\nCurved and straight in their nature,\nRight and wrong self-evident,\nNo deceit arises,\nAuthority revered and displayed,\nOrders enforced without obstruction,\nAbove transforming, below responding,\nPublic and private as father and child,\nRespect and love sincere,\nSuperior and inferior in joy,\nPeople united, officials without grievance,\nDuties fulfilled, reputation honored,\nCalled *junzi*, virtue ever abundant,\nDeath not a peril.\n\nCultivated in the village, its virtue endures.\n\nCultivated in the state,\nThe ruler enlightened, ministers loyal,\nNo blocking of the worthy in court,\nNo jealousy of merit among scholars,\nNo obstruction of the upright by the crooked,\nNo slander harming the public,\nHarmony and compliance above and below,\nNo grievances, officials delighted in their duties,\nAll affairs in natural order,\nDistant peoples drawn in longing,\nThe world follows its wind,\nThe state rich, the

arises.\n\nCultivated in the world, its virtue is universal.\n\nThus, my self is the measure of other selves,\nMy family the balance of other families,\nMy village the compass of other villages,\nMy

void state.\n\nVenomous creatures do not sting,\nRaptors do not clutch,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nNor do they add harm—\nIts bones are frail, its sinews soft,\nYet its grasp is firm, its hold unyielding.\nIt knows not the union of male and female,\nYet the Dao’s effortless transformation is complete—\nIts essence is the most divine and luminous.\n\nAll day it wails, yet its throat never grows hoarse,\nIts voice remains in perfect harmony—\nThe harmony of the Dao is its way.\n\nTo know harmony is to know the eternal Dao,\nTo know the eternal Dao is to be enlightened and discerning—\nLife flourishes as a blessed, boundless day,\nThe heart directs the *qi* to become robust and unshakable—\nWhen things grow strong, they turn decrepit and rigid,\nThis is called *not* aligning with the Dao—\nA fate of calamity and ruin.\nTo stray from the Dao means an early end to one’s great destiny.\n\n**Explanation of the Way:**\nVirtue is void and boundless,\nDivine luminosity is tranquil and profound—\nPure, still, and subtly vast,\nThe Great Harmony flows like water.\nListen to it, and it is silent and empty,\nObserve it, and it is formless and easy.\nIts limits are without end, its bounds without measure—\nHeaven cannot enfold it,\nEarth cannot contain it,\nThe compass cannot make it round,\nThe square cannot make it square,\nMeasure cannot measure it,\nYet scales cannot weigh it—\nGold and jade cannot shield it,\nWater and fire cannot obstruct or destroy it,\nAll things fail to grasp it,\nMisfortune cannot befall it.\n\nHow much more so for those who float and soar,\nWho are pure and vast like the primordial chaos—\nTheir hearts have no dwelling,\nTheir forms no fixed abode.\nThrough natural refinement and reception,\nThey take form from the Ten Thousand Heavens,\nAll beings receive it—\nNourished and content,\nYet thought cannot grasp it,\nAction cannot seize it—\nThe farther one seeks, the thinner it becomes,\nThe more one clutches, the more it eludes.\nTo grasp it is to be caught by it,\nTo let go is to be released by it.\n\nOnly those without desire\nMake their bodies its dwelling,\nStore it within their hearts—\nThus it is called *containing virtue*.\n\nTo align with virtue is to receive virtue—\nThe depth of contained virtue is profound.\nVirtue in a person\nIs like a parent’s love for their child—\nFor all beings, it is like pearls and jade compared to clay and lead.\nParents give birth to me, and this cannot be changed,\nPearls and jade nourish me, and this cannot be discarded.\n\nThus, the virtuous person\nValues their body above all else,\nYet regards the world with lightness—\nLike a benevolent father and filial child,\nWho would not trade their love for wealth.\nThe one who cherishes their body\nAnd holds all else in slight regard\nIs like a wise merchant,\nWho would not exchange pearls and jade for clay and lead.\n\nTheir lack of desire is not from hating wealth or loving ease—\nThe world’s treasures cannot please their heart.\nTheir embrace of emptiness is not from loving stillness or hating disturbance—\nThe world’s affairs are not worth their effort.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they hold their own nature as weighty,\nAnd the world as light.\n\nThey understand the distinction between weight and light,\nThey grasp the shifts between profit and harm—\nThus all things cannot enslave them,\nNor can the world deceive them.\n\nTherefore, they do not seek stillness, yet stillness arises,\nThey do not seek harmony, yet harmony is born,\nThey do not rest their spirit, yet the spirit finds peace,\nThey do not cultivate harmony, yet the *qi* becomes balanced.\n\nThus, they do not listen, yet hear the soundless sound,\nThey do not look, yet see the formless form,\nThey do not think, yet discern right and wrong,\nThey do not ponder, yet reach the realm of unity.\n\nTheir spirit permeates Heaven and Earth,\nTheir virtue follows Yin and Yang—\nThey do not pray for blessings, yet Heaven and Earth protect them,\nThey do not shun misfortune, yet calamities and harm depart,\nThey do not execute, yet all under Heaven fears them,\nThey do not bestow, yet all under Heaven loves them.\n\nThey find joy in a full belly,\nDelight in bowing and rising,\nEat coarse grasses yet find it savory,\nDrink plain water yet find it sweet.\n\nBeneath towering trees,\nTheir spirit remains whole,\nWithin rocky caves,\nTheir heart ever rejoices—\nThe poor find joy in their work,\nThe lowly forget their humility,\nIn destitution, they meet death with serenity,\nIn hardship, they forget all danger.\nTheir deeds match the Earth’s,\nTheir virtue aligns with Heaven’s—\nThey return to simplicity, embrace naturalness,\nAnd are like infants once more.\n\nThe profound depth of contained virtue\nIs likened to the babe in its cradle.\n\nThus, to establish the body as the foundation of the state,\nAnd to take the babe as the model of governance,\nThen the world will honor the Dao and revere virtue,\nEach will cherish their own body,\nRenown and power will become stains,\nAll things mere dust—\nThe greedy will flee titles,\nThe cruel will turn to benevolence,\nGathering softness and weakness,\nOnly virtue will be cultivated.\n\nYet those who create blessings and sow chaos—\nHow could this ever arise?\n\nIt is from aligning with virtue by nature,\nNo cause for its generation.\n\nAlas, the Dao of Heaven and Earth—\nDeep and distant, subtle and refined—\nFew can recognize it,\nFewer still can follow it.\nWisdom and insight cannot grasp it,\nOnly the babe embodies it.\n\nThe babe’s nature mirrors virtue—\nThe babe knows yet does not speak,\nUnderstands yet does not reveal,\nHas power yet does not act,\nIs skilled yet remains hidden—\nAlive yet like death,\nFresh yet like decay—\nActing without action,\nMatching the Dao in every detail.\n\nLife that is not life,\nA body that is not a body,\nUse that is not use,\nHearing that is not hearing—\nWithout action or affairs,\nWithout intention or heart,\nNot seeking virtue or spirit,\nNot accumulating wisdom—\nNeither thinking nor pondering,\nNor obstructed by barriers—\nTheir spirit does not stir,\nTheir clarity knows no bounds,\nSoft yet void, still yet tranquil,\nTheir souls are at peace.\n\nJoy without seeking joy,\nEase without desiring ease—\nThey live without wasting their spirit,\nThey die without lingering regrets.\n\nThus they can be enveloped by the Dao and contain virtue,\nAlign with Heaven and Earth—\nThen bees and wasps, venomous creatures and snakes,\nWill have no will to inflict their stings.\nRaptors and fierce beasts\nWill have no intent to seize or attack.\n\nVenomous creatures do not sting,\nRaptors do not clutch—\nBecause there is no place for death.\nBones frail, sinews soft,\nYet their grasp is firm and unyielding.\nThey see not male and female,\nYet Yin and Yang transform them.\n\nTheir spirit is full and complete,\nAll beings unite with them—\nTheir cries do not grow hoarse,\nTheir harmony can be called perfect.\nTheir actions and deeds\nAlign with the eternal Dao.\n\nTo know harmony is to know the eternal.\nTo hold fast and guard it\nIs to be wise and enlightened—\nTo know the eternal is to be clear.\n\nBy nature, they flourish and grow—\nWhen they move, all blessings gather.\nTheir hearts act in profound mystery,\nTheir *qi* flows, robust and unyielding—\nThe heart directs the *qi*, and this is called *strength*—\nWithout striving, they overcome all.",

anger of the heart and its thoughts,\nTo smooth the brightness of appearance without strangeness,\nTo blend with common garb, unmarked by eccentricity—\nThis is called *playing with the Dao*, aligning with the mundane.\n\nThey cannot be drawn close by love nor pushed away by neglect,\nThey cannot be gained by benefit nor lost by harm,\nThey cannot be honored by rank nor humbled by disgrace,\nYet they stand as the most noble and revered under Heaven and Earth.\n\n**Key Principle:**\nThe Dao has no fixed manifestation,\nVirtue no fixed direction,\nThe spirit no fixed form,\nHarmony no fixed appearance—\nYou gaze upon it yet cannot see,\nYou listen to it yet cannot hear,\nIt cannot be foreseen nor touched.\n\nThus, those who attain the Dao\nPerceive it alone, hear it alone,\nAct upon it alone, and abide by it alone.\n\nA father cannot pass it to his son,\nA subject cannot bestow it upon his lord,\nYet as a mother recognizes her child,\nOr a younger brother his elder—\nSo too, the child recognizes the mother.\n\nThis recognition is natural,\nYet its reason cannot be articulated.\n\nThe five flavors are in the mouth,\nThe five tones in the ear—\nYet what is sweet is not sweet,\nWhat is bitter is not bitter,\nWhat is *shang* is not *shang*,\nWhat is *yu* is not *yu*—\nYet the cook Yi and the musician Jiang could distinguish them.\n\nYet their means of distinction—\nThe mouth could not speak of it.\n\nThus, the saying: *\"Those who speak do not know, those who know do not speak.\"*\n\nHence, the form without form,\nCan be seen yet not seen;\nThe image without image,\nCan be imitated yet not declared;\nThe action without action,\nCan be followed yet not described;\nThe use without use,\nCan be practiced yet not transmitted.\n\nTherefore, those who attain the Dao\nSee it as a child recognizes its parent,\nTread it like the earth,\nWear it like the sky,\nEncase it as clothing,\nEmbody it like the self,\nAct with it in rise and fall,\nReact to external stimuli as if in water,\nBend with the flexing of fortune,\nYet remain steadfast in their own spirit.\n\nTheir spirit wanders with transformation,\nTheir resolve moves with virtue,\nTheir wisdom acts inwardly,\nYet outwardly they seem deaf and blind.\nTheir thoughts arise in mystery,\nTheir demeanor seems mad.\n\nThus, their mouth cannot speak,\nNor can their intent be made clear—\nLike dreaming of being a king,\nStanding on the brink of peril,\nJoy and sorrow reversed,\nThe heart alone knows—\nYet upon waking, they cannot convey it to another.\n\nThose who stray from the Dao are not so.\nThey see only the exterior, not the interior,\nFollow the current, yet grasp not the source,\nHold the end, yet exhaust not the root.\nThey affirm what is not affirmed,\nDeny what is not denied.\nThe superficiality of things,\nIs what they affirm as true.\n\nThe fundamental truth of the Dao,\nCannot be comprehended by such superficiality.\n\nThus, the Dao lies in externals,\nNot in the self—\nThe central ruler is undecided,\nHis defenses are not steadfast,\nThe heart harbors doubts, the will wavers,\nEmotions cling to things,\nWisdom is flashy,\nFalsity is mistaken for truth,\nHe oscillates between affirmation and negation,\nBetween existence and non-existence,\nHarmonious *qi* is easily disturbed—\nLike illness in a man,\nVitality leaks, spirit escapes,\nHe loves speech yet hates silence.\nWhen he speaks, his heart is troubled,\nHis resolve is distracted,\nHis wisdom is all outward,\nHis spirit departs.\n\nHis inner voice is spent,\nYet his outer words overflow,\nHis virtue and power scatter daily,\nHis self grows ever more distant.\nThe more he speaks, the less he understands his own perfection,\nThe more he acts, the less he knows his own virtue.\n\nThus, those who speak\nAre the essentials of opposing the Dao,\nThe means of straying from virtue,\nThe craftsmen of defying Heaven,\nThe instruments of overturning Earth.\n\nTherefore, those who attain the Dao\nDiminish their hearing, discard their brightness,\nDo not see, do not listen,\nAs if without sight or sound,\nClose their mouths, seal their tongues,\nAs if they know not speech.\n\nBlock their senses,\nClose their doors.\nBlunt their sharpness,\nRelease their attachments,\nTheir will guards nothing,\nTheir form seems void.\n\nDissolve their thoughts,\nScatter their worries,\nSeem to know nothing,\nYet hide as if alone in existence.\nBlunt their sharpness,\nDissolve their anger.\n\nExtinguish disaster at its root,\nReturn to the *Tai Su* (Great Primordial),\nTheir appearance is unchanged,\nTheir dress is unmarked,\nThey follow Heaven and Earth,\nBlend with the common in transformation,\nPlunge deep into the Great Dao,\nWander with virtue.\n\nWithout words to speak of speech,\nWithout action to speak of action,\nThey govern themselves with clarity and stillness,\nRespond to the times with harmony and balance,\nMerge with the world in undifferentiated chaos,\nAlign with the common in *playing with the Dao*.\n\nThey smooth their brightness,\nBlend with the dust.\nSeizing the root of all things,\nGrasping the foundation of all affairs,\nThey alone differ from the crowd—\nYet the world knows them not.\n\nThey drift through the thresholds of closeness and distance,\nSoar through the gates of gain and harm,\nFloat in the wilds of honor and disgrace,\nSteadfastly guard their own spirit,\nVanish into the realm of the formless,\nRoam in the land of abandon.\n\nPoverty and lowliness do not shame them,\nWealth and nobility do not flatter them—\nThey hide when they wish to hide,\nThey reveal when they wish to reveal.\nEven *yin* and *yang* cannot harm or benefit them,\nNor can rulers obscure their clarity.\n\nThis is called *playing with the Dao*.\nThus, they cannot be drawn close nor distanced.\n\nThey stand unmatched, alone,\nDistinct without peer—\nSounds and colors cannot please them,\nThe five flavors cannot sweeten them,\nTen thousand things cannot contend with them,\nWisdom and strength cannot dispute them.\n\nWithout taking nor giving,\nWithout gaining nor losing,\nThey close their doors, shut their gates,\nSever the ends, extinguish the threads,\nTheir spirit and clarity are self-made,\nThe Dao is their central ruler—\nTheir movement aligns with transformation,\nTheir stillness harmonizes with the natural.\nWhen they follow the natural order, they endure.\n\nAbandoned and unrestrained,\nThey have no fixed form,\nNo one can precede or follow them—\nThus, those who love them cannot approach,\nThose who hate them cannot distance,\nRewards cannot be added,\nTaxes cannot be taken,\nRank and honor cannot be elevated,\nPoverty and lowliness cannot be imposed.\n\nThey have no need of

**evil** (*yāo*), and **evil omens** (*yāo xiáng*) follow.\n\nMen have long strayed from what is proper and constant—\nThe source of their prolonged confusion.\n\n**Key Principle**:\nThe **emotion of virtue** (*dàoqíng*) is constant—**uprightness** (*zhèng*) and **loyalty** (*xìn*) are the norm.\nChange and movement, stillness and action—\nOne arises, the other vanishes.\n\nThe **covering** (*fù*) of Heaven and Earth,\nThe **threads** (*jī*) and **patterns** (*gāng*) of yin and yang,\nThe **records** (*jì*) and **guidelines** (*lǐ*) of sun and moon,\nNurturing all living beings—\nThose who oppose it perish, those who follow it thrive.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,\nIs one yin and one yang,\n**Yang-qi** (*yángqì*) governs **virtue/power** (*dé*),\n**Yin-qi** (*yīnqì*) governs **punishment** (*xíng*),\nPunishment and virtue are contrary,\nYet harmony lies at the center.\n\nSpring brings forth, summer grows,\nAutumn harvests, winter conceals—\nEnding to begin anew,\nDecaying yet rising again,\nYang reaches its end and turns to yin,\nYin reaches its end and turns to yang,\nYin and yang in opposition,\nExtending to infinity.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of kings and the conduct of men,\nIs one soft and one hard,\nOne civil and one martial,\nWith **central uprightness** (*zhōngzhèng*) as the guiding thread—\nHardness and softness in contrast,\nWar and virtue intertwined,\nWar turns to virtue,\nVirtue turns to war,\nWar and virtue safeguarding each other,\nLaw at the center,\n**Numbers** (*shù*) and **principles** (*fǎ*) in harmony,\nThus all can flow freely.\n\nTherefore, the **enlightened kings** and **sage rulers**,\nReduce their desires to empty their minds,\nEmpty their minds to calm their spirits,\nCalm their spirits to grasp the **Dao/Way**,\nGain the **Dao/Way** to rectify their hearts,\nRectify their hearts to cultivate their bodies,\nCultivate their bodies to order their households,\nOrder their households to establish laws,\nEstablish laws to clarify names,\nClarify names to govern the state.\n\nThis is how they govern the state with **uprightness**.\n\nWhen the state is **upright** (*zhèngguó*), its **records** (*jì*) are firm,\nIts principles clear and discerned,\nFrom the **roots** (*yuán*) to the **origins** (*běn*),\nDrawing connections left and right,\nAligning ranks front and back,\nThings return to their proper places—\nClarifying names to **cover** reality,\nVerifying reality to **supervise** names.\n\nOne name, one reality,\nBalanced and thorough,\nSquare and round, straight and curved,\nNone can stray—\nRewards and punishments applied,\nNeither **excessive** (*yáng*) nor **stunted** (*suō*).\nNames and reality,\nLike moon and sun,\nOne name **upright** brings prosperity to the state,\nOne name **deceitful** brings enslavement to the state.\n\nThe **secrets** (*mì*) of nurturing the state,\nLie in having no fixed course—\nBending and extending, giving and taking,\nAll in accordance with the times.\nFollowing disorder, relying on law,\nEncountering rebellion, using war,\nGuarding peace with the **Dao/Way**,\nEmbodying **virtue/power** as the norm,\nGreat and small states meet—\nWith **uprightness** as their mutual expectation.\n\nIf they stray from **uprightness**, transform them,\nIf they do not comply, restrain them,\nIf they do not cease, regulate them,\nIf they do not submit, strike them.\n\n**Understanding** the great state’s **coordination** (*xié*) with the small,\nThey dare not lightly use war,\nThus they first employ **transformation** and **restraint**,\nOnly when compliance fails do they resort to regulation and punishment.\n\nIf a small state is **pressed** between great states,\nFacing a ruler without the **Dao/Way**,\nAnd **uprightness** cannot prevail,\nThen leave it—\nIf leaving is impossible, cede land to it—\nIf ceding land is impossible, lead the people to flee—\nIf fleeing is impossible, take up the staff and depart—\nIf departing is impossible, calamity will reach all the people,\nAnd disaster will fall upon me—\nThus, I must **devise plans** and **scheme**,\nFor this is where **contention** arises,\nAnd war is born.\n\nI wish to **select generals** and **train soldiers**,\nSharpen arms and fortify defenses,\nStockpile grain and raise ramparts,\nCamp and defend myself—\nYet the people suffer exhaustion,\nThe state becomes hollowed out—\nThis is how **war** is **initiated**,\nAnd **uprightness** is **invoked**.\n\nIf I enter with **uprightness**,\nYet I am few while they are many,\nI am weak while they are strong—\nLike an egg thrown upon a stone,\nI will be the enemy’s victim,\nSuffering calamity—\nThe armies must surely fail,\nSoldiers die in wounds,\nThe **Heavenly intent** (*tiānxīn*) will not be fulfilled,\nThe ancestral temples will perish—\nBelow, I lament the people’s fate,\nAbove, I fear the **heart of Heaven and Earth** (*tiāndìxīn*)—\nThis is how **strategy** (*quán*) is **activated**,\nAnd **deceit** (*qí*) is **deployed**.\n\nThus, I **establish** the **plan of opposition** (*fǎnwéng*) and **attraction** (*fùlái*),\nOpen the **hearts of the people**,\nStimulate the **schemes of the feudal lords**,\nReveal my **virtue/power’s** (*dàodé*) **blessings**,\nIllustrate the **assistance of Heaven and Earth**—\nTo **unify** the hearts of the four seas,\nTo **harmonize** the intentions of all states.\n\nThe people respond to me like echoes,\nNeighboring states follow me like shadows,\nBirds and beasts take flight with me—\nThis is how **plans** are **utilized**,\nAnd **deceit** is **executed**.\n\n**Deceit** is **strategy**—\nWhen a small state is **pressed** between great states,\nAnd matters of fleeing or retreat arise,\nWar cannot be avoided—\nThus **strategy** and **deceit** are **employed**.\n\n**Understanding** that war is an **omen of misfortune**,\nUsed only when there is no alternative—\nI **activate** schemes and **plans**,\nTo **align** with the people’s expectations—\nHeaven and Earth, birds and beasts,\nAssist me as my **fortified city** (*chéng*—*cf.* 以浑四海之心，同万国之意，天地鸟兽助我为城),\nThus it is said: *\"Employing **deceit** in war.\"*\n\nAbove, **aligning** with the **intention of virtue**,\nBelow, **harmonizing** with the **heart of Heaven and Earth**,\nIn **danger**, ensuring **safety**,\nIn **harm**, safeguarding **benefit**—\nTreating

brings great joy,\nAnd the Four Seas find peace—\nThis is the **highest** use of the **unconventional** (*qí*).\n\nFirst employing the **Dao/Way**,\nOnly when it is not followed do the calamities arise—\nThus it is the **highest**.\n\nSoothing the anger of the world,\nGathering those skilled in the **unconventional**,\nEars attuned to distant whispers,\nEyes scanning the horizon,\nScholars roaming freely,\nForming alliances and bonds of kinship,\nLife and death transform strangely,\nFollowing the **Dao/Way** to respond to deceit.\n\nAdorning authority and nurturing influence,\nTo deceive the people with substance;\nSpreading rumors and fabricating schemes,\nTo confuse the enemy;\nUsing humble words to subdue the lowly,\nTo close the mind of their lord;\nOffering light tasks with heavy rewards,\nTo open the hearts of their ministers.\n\nWhen rifts form between lord and subject,\nManipulating their spirits,\nActions concealed in darkness,\nPower shifting in subtlety,\nSuspending their fate,\nExploiting their vulnerabilities,\nDriving the enemy to madness and confusion,\nSo they cannot act—\nAdvancing or retreating with the times,\nNo fixed rituals,\nNot striking yet the enemy surrenders,\nNot fighting yet the enemy falters,\nOverthrowing their lord without harming their ministers,\nSlaying their generals without touching their troops,\nVictory brings the people’s joy,\nThe feudal lords fear them—\nThis is the **second** use of the **unconventional**.\n\nFirst devising strategies,\nLater securing their fate—\nThus it is the **second**.\n\nControlling the terrain,\nMastering their lords and ministers,\nOffering low status with heavy rewards,\nTo pacify their outward appearance,\nSpreading covert schemes,\nTo sow discord among their kin,\nDeceit comes from them,\nThe **Dao/Way** arises from this—\nGranting cities to seal generals,\nJoining states to reward deceit.\n\nDeceit arrives like a specter,\nPlots unfold like divine foresight,\nStrategies unmeasured,\nUnconventional shifts endless,\nDividing their strength,\nSowing doubt in their hearts,\nAs if rising from the earth,\nAs if born of Heaven,\nSevering their inner circle,\nScattering their alliances,\nRaising influence and generating change,\nTo determine their fate,\nBlocking their schemes,\nSo they cannot trust.\n\nBreaking their strong supporters,\nTo isolate their resolve,\nExploiting their form to ensure victory,\nLike an endless ring,\nStriking at the opportune moment,\nHarmony as its constant,\nAttacking their vulnerabilities,\nIn stillness, cutting their supplies.\n\nStripping them of resources,\nStarving and parching them,\nBurdening them with weight,\nDrowning them in fire,\nExhausting them with labor,\nFreezing and scorching them,\nLuring them with profit,\nMaddening them with confusion,\nDriving them to desperation,\nPressing them to the brink.\n\nStriking from high to low,\nUsing many to overcome few,\nStrengthening ranks and divisions,\nOfficers and troops aligned,\nThe high protecting the low,\nThe low aiding the high,\nThe three armies united,\nBound as father and son.\n\n**Unconventional** formations merge and split,\nHidden and concealed in layers.\nCamps before, supplies behind,\nOverwhelming the left, routing the right,\nDazzling with banners and drums,\nConfounding with music and war cries,\nAdvancing like surging waves,\nRetreating like wind and rain,\nStriking like a collapse,\nClashing like a tiger—\nDefenses unbreakable,\nOffensives unyielding,\nVictory brings awe,\nAll under Heaven trembles—\nThis is the **lowest** use of the **unconventional**.\n\nEmploying force first,\nOnly then determining their fate—\nThus it is the **lowest**.\n\nWhen chaos and disorder cease,\nAll things flourish in peace,\nHeaven’s will is fulfilled,\nThe world rejoices—\nConcealing the **unconventional**, diminishing cleverness,\nPrioritizing loyalty and sincerity,\nCultivating stillness and simplicity,\nWithdrawing from affairs, halting speech.\n\nThough skilled in unconventional victory,\nUnclear in **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power**,\nFearful that affairs will shift and change,\nCorrupting purity, scattering simplicity—\nThus halting speech.\n\nWhy is this so?\n**Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** transform endlessly,\nAll things have high and low,\nDirections diverge,\nPaths intertwine—\nSome turn west, some east,\nEach follows its nature,\nTo sustain its life.\n\nThe virtuous thrive through goodness,\nThe wicked spread through evil,\nThe sincere shine through truth,\nThe deceitful mask with falsity—\nEach displays their wisdom,\nTo avoid calamity and ruin.\n\nSeeking without fulfillment,\nThe wise feign cunning;\nLaboring without rest,\nThe loyal turn deceitful;\nOppressed and tormented,\nThe faithful spread lies;\nDriven to ruin without end,\nThe worthy do not transform.\n\nThus when the ruler favors knowledge, the people deceive;\nWhen the ruler favors profit, the people suffer;\nWhen the ruler favors rewards, the people grow weary;\nWhen the ruler favors punishment, the people resent.\n\nWhy?\nAffairs originate with the ruler,\nActions rest with the ministers;\nRewards come from the ruler,\nWealth comes from the people;\nLaws come from the ruler,\nObedience rests with the ministers.\nWhen the ruler desires,\nAll under Heaven follows the wind.\n\nAll affairs stem from the ruler,\nThe ruler is the source of transformation.\nIf the ruler does not conceal their schemes,\nThey revert to the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThough clever and wise in strategy,\nIt is not as effective as acting without thought.\nThus governing with public-mindedness\nIs not as harmonious as the great unity of non-action;\nSeeking to curb excess through prohibition\nIs not as effective as loyalty born of no desire;\nGuiding through measured anger\nIs not as fruitful as the merit of non-action;\nBalancing thought with **virtue/power**\nIs not as vast as the boundless flow of inaction;\nMastering the arts of divination and omens\nIs not as beneficial as nurturing a world without ailment;\nWielding the strategies of the Yellow Emperor and Duke Zhou,\nOr grasping the essentials of Sunzi and Wu Qi,\nIs not as profound as letting all under Heaven\nRefrain from exerting cleverness or strength.\n\nThus what **Dao/Way** and **virtue/power** produce,\nLove cannot profit from;\nWhat Heaven and Earth complete,\nAction cannot achieve.\n\nSmall acts of love and gain\nUltimately defy the great **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\nOnly those without love can bring profit,\nOnly those without action can fulfill.\nThus the enlightened kings and sage rulers\nHave no desires, no seeking,\nNo creation, no contrivance,\nNo burdens, no formalities—\nReturning to origins, embracing simplicity,\nAll under Heaven finds peace.\n\nTaking the realm through inaction—\nHow is this made clear?\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"To bring fortune and benefit,\nTo achieve success and complete affairs,\nTo prepare all things and fulfill their use,\nTo enrich people greatly—\nThen all under Heaven indulges in extravagance,\nWealth and goods are insufficient,\nThe people grow ever more depraved.\nFortune fills the mountains and marshes,\nGold and jade pile up,\nYet the state grows ever less secure,\nThe people gain less benefit.\nAdorning cleverness while appearing foolish,\nUsing deceit to manipulate,\nGuarding against licentiousness and lust,\nThe paths of deceit and falsity grow dense,\nDistinguishing same from different,\nThe

differentiated—\nYet the wise are obscured and the foolish prevail.\nHis governance is probing,\nAnd his people are obscured.\n\nThus, he loses what he relies upon,\nAnd his life is cut short by Heaven.\nFortune arises from calamity,\nCalamity arises from fortune—\nFortune and calamity,\nShare the same source yet different realms,\nBoth perish together, both endure together,\nDifferent in nature yet the same in appearance,\nFollowing each other in and out,\nSame in origin yet different in end.\nWithout the Sage,\nNone can grasp them alone.\nFortune and calamity,\nDepend upon each

people’s confusion endures long—\nThus it cannot be recovered.\n\nRectangular yet not cutting,\nSharp yet not harming,\nStraight yet not overbearing,\nBright yet not dazzling.\n\nTo govern people and harmonize Heaven for living—\nNothing surpasses frugality and non-action.\n\nOnly frugality,\nThus early service without prohibitions.\nAccumulating virtue in subtle profundity,\nThen there is nothing it cannot overcome,\nNothing it cannot conquer.\nNone know its ultimate transformation—\nTangtang, it can make a state,\nIt can make a sovereign king.\nThe mother of states is frugality,\nIt can endure long and move with difficulty.\n\nDeep roots and firm stems,\nSpirit concealed,\nLong life and enduring vision,\nThe body preserved whole.\n\nPointing back:\nThe Dao has nothing it does not possess,\nYet does not give or withhold—\nThus all things exist.\nIt lacks no power,\nYet does not act or kill—\nThus all things flourish.\nHow can this be made clear?\n\nThe Dao is formless yet all things have form,\nIt lacks state nor appearance yet all things are square or round,\nSilent yet all things have sound.\nFrom this perspective,\nThe Dao does not give nor withhold,\nYet all things exist;\nIt does not act nor slaughter,\nYet all things flourish.\nFlourishing arises from non-flourishing,\nExistence arises from non-existence—\nThis is clear.\nThe Dao can preserve in non-preservation,\nFlourish in non-flourishing.\n\nSome say:\n*\"The Dao is formless and soundless,\nYet does not give nor withhold—\nHow can it flourish in non-flourishing,\nPreserve in non-preservation?\"*\n\nThe Sage discerns each thing in its natural state,\nEach thing preserves its own Dao—\nThis is called recognizing form and sound,\nYet not recognizing their influence.\n\nThe sun, though not making form to cast shadow,\nYet shadow must follow sunlight,\nThe void, though not making sound to produce echo,\nYet echo must follow hollow valleys.\nIf the sun and void had hearts to create shadows and echoes,\nThen there would be times when they fail—\nHow could they ever be seen nor heard,\nNor ensure that flourishing and preservation must exist?\n\nThe Dao can flourish and preserve in things,\nYet the Dao has never had a heart.\nThus, when the king raises troops and uses sharp tools,\nThe people grow desirous—\nDesire grows, and with desire comes cutting.\nCutting as the standard,\nThen the licentious advance while the upright retreat,\nLoyal ministers suffer its poison,\nAnd all the people bear its harm.\n\nThe desirous use desire as the standard,\nYet desire is licentious—\nThus the upright are cut down,\nAnd all the people suffer harm.\n\nTo value wealth,\nThen the people seek—\nSeeking grows, and with seeking comes piercing.\nPiercing as the standard,\nThen the greedy prevail while the frugal suffer,\nLoyal ministers bear the blame,\nAnd all the people suffer defeat.\n\nThe seekers use seeking as the standard,\nYet seeking is

piercing—\nPracticing virtue, beauty, and humility,\nExposing flaws and manifesting vice,\nYet debate is without deception.\nRemove wealth, embrace sincerity,\nHumility and yielding follow reason—\nGood and evil self-separate,\nThus nothing is concealed.\n\nRemove strife yet uphold rectitude,\nSo that the people restrain themselves;\nUnrestrain not where restraint is not due,\nSo that the people submit themselves.\nRight the perverse, correct the chaotic,\nTransform licentiousness, rectify customs—\nNone call it blessing,\nYet the world thrives in wildness,\nAll things find their natural place.\nNot that there is no unrestraint—\nPromote the upright, exalt the just,\nExpose errors, highlight crimes,\nDiminish the perverse, curb the crooked,\nReveal people’s faults—\nThe world is thoroughly rectified,\nYet action brings no sound.\nFollow reason to mediate disputes,\nAlign with the Dao to suit the occasion—\nThough just, there is no excess,\nThough not unrestrained, it is not so.\n\nRemove vanity yet uphold brightness,\nSo that the people act appropriately;\nDazzle not where dazzling is not due,\nSo that the people are naturally enlightened.\nNone call it illumination, none call it obscurity,\nThe world is vast and harmonious,\nAll things flourish and grow—\nVirtue compares with Heaven,\nTransformation aligns with the Dao.\nNot that there is no dazzling—\nVirtue shines universally,\nIlluminates all things,\nYet its transformation is formless.\n\nThe Dao is its own brightness,\nPermeating all without measure—\nEach thing finds its own place,\nNo one knows its

dwell in simplicity,\nSpeak with clarity yet hold silence.\nEstablish a form without ostentation,\nSet a pattern without imitation—\nFearful that others know them,\nThey conceal themselves in the

they seize all beasts yet are mastered by humankind.\n\nThe fragrant and splendid grasses, with their radiant hues and sweet scents,\nThus delight the multitude yet harm their own roots.\n\nThe sovereign of a great realm, with vast lands and teeming people,\nHigh status and favored form, towering might and illustrious name—\nThus they provoke neighboring states yet endanger their own rule.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is upheld, they are steadfast as a flat stone,\nSecure as the great mountain.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is lost, they are perilous as a pile of eggs,\nLight as a feather.\n\nBoth weak, they suffer first;\nBoth chaotic, they perish first.\nThus, great realms are the steps to tyranny\nAnd the stage to ruin.\n\nTherefore, the sovereign of a great realm\nStands alone with none to rival,\nMountains encircle their borders, three sides blocked by defenses,\nRivers unite their flow, all things beneath them bow—\nThe hub of the feudal lords.\n\nA storehouse of fertile lands,\nThe corpse of the strong and mighty,\nThe master of power and influence,\nBound by unmeasured steadfastness,\nChoked by narrow and constrained paths.\n\nAbundant and rich, vast and easy,\nSpanning thousands of miles,\nTreasure and marvels without end,\nFew taxes or burdens upon the people,\nHerds and flocks roam freely,\nBoats and carriages numberless,\nArms and provisions piled high,\nThe people dwell in ease and joy,\nTravelers pause and stay—\nMen like grass and trees,\nCattle filling the hills and fields,\nHunting and tilling, their gains tenfold.\n\nThus, all under Heaven desire to submit,\nAnd ministers and generals strive to attach—\nWith chariots and cavalry charging boldly,\nA million armored men,\nDefending easy terrain, holding strong passes,\nFavored by Heaven’s order, Earth’s support—\nThey suspend life, dictate death,\nAssist them and they gain strength,\nBetray them and they lose their ancestral halls.\nThus, the feudal lords desire their alliance,\nAnd all under Heaven fears their might.\n\nSo-called great realms,\nAre the currents of all under Heaven,\nThe meeting of all under Heaven’s exchanges.\n\nWhen the **Dao/Way** is extended, they can unite and encompass,\nWhen virtue and favor are exalted, they can issue commands,\nWhen they are struck, they can exalt benevolence,\nWhen they govern, they can clarify righteousness,\nWhen they unite, they can expand their lands,\nWhen they take, they can grow their wealth—\nThus the feudal lords delight in them,\nAnd ministers and generals profit from them.\n\nTherefore, from ancient times to today,\nGreat realms—like the female—\nConquer with stillness the male,\nUnchanged for ten thousand ages,\nUnaltered for a hundred thousand years.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThey receive the full with emptiness,\nThey respond to the present with the void,\nThey do not seek to be great,\nBut strive to be small,\nThey do not seek to be high,\nBut always remain low.\n\nThe female guards with yielding softness,\nThe male seeks with forceful vigor—\nThus the female ever conquers the male with stillness.\n\nExcessive fullness brings regret,\nHence great realms should act as the lowly.\n\nThus, the enlightened kings and sage rulers in great realms\nExtend the **Dao/Way** yet do not claim possession,\nAct humbly yet do not seek subservience—\nTheir lands enfold the realms of feudal lords,\nYet none dare oppose them;\nTheir virtue encompasses the strength of feudal lords,\nYet none dare resist them;\nThey bow in submission to align with others’ will,\nTheir loyalty, integrity, and sincerity lead their officers—\nThey divide lands east and west to attract the worthy and brilliant,\nThey diligently till and weave to amass wealth and resources,\nThey form shifting alliances to guard against unforeseen threats.\n\nThey open granaries and distribute wealth,\nNourish the aged and feed the orphaned,\nRelieve the poor and aid the destitute,\nHonor recluses in their caves.\n\nThey receive yet do not take,\nThey grant yet do not withhold—\nSoftness, simplicity, and ease,\nTaking no action while in position.\n\nThough feudal lords may be greedy and vile,\nResentful and haughty, relying on strength,\nAnd though they dislike compliance and plot rebellion,\nThey are still subdued by the **Dao/Way**’s might and virtue’s weight,\nBy yielding stillness and humility—\nThen they mend their ways, correct their errors,\nCede lands and offer treasures,\nSubmit their allegiance, even risk their lives,\nAnd beg to be made vassals, border guards of their realm.\n\nSo-called great realms acting humbly toward small realms,\nAre those who take small realms.\n\nWhen they occupy small and weak realms,\nThey follow the **Dao/Way** in action,\nGovern with moderation and care,\nWealth in boats and carriages,\nStrength in arms and provisions,\nLoyalty, sincerity, and honesty—\nThey value simplicity and honor tillage,\nTilling and weaving are their duties,\nThey do not tax the people,\nSuperior and inferior in harmony,\nAffection like father and son,\nThe ruler as the heart within the body,\nThe people as its limbs—\nTheir realm unified in peace,\nThey can share life and death,\nSuperior and inferior in accord,\nThey can join with neighboring states in mutual trust.\n\nThough the sovereigns of great realms\nBear the weight of many strong powers,\nHold sway over influence and authority,\nLeft with virtue and right with benevolence,\nTheir hearts like hungry tigers,\nTheir wrath like surging springs—\nThey do not delight in giving,\nBut always wish to devour others.\n\nYet if they gain the will of Heaven,\nThe favor of the people,\nThe trust of ministers and generals,\nThe aid of neighboring states,\nAnd raise the unmeasured might of their enemies,\nIf they display their unfathomable power,\nIf they humble their bodies and exhaust their sincerity,\nIf they act with clear and tranquil purpose—\nThen their spirits are moved, their minds swayed,\nTheir wrath shifts, their calamities depart,\nAnd they become my strange allies.\n\nSmall realms acting humbly toward great realms,\nAre those who take great realms.\n\nThose who take great realms,\nAre those who seize what others depend upon.\n\nThe superior who takes from others,\nTheir lands vast, their influence abundant,\nTheir virtue broad and their power heavy—\nThis is what others seek.\n\nGreat realms, acting without force,\nCan secure this advantage.\n\nBut they must always unite with the lowly,\nAnd thus gain what others possess.\n\nThe inferior who takes from others,\nTheir lands narrow, their people few,\nTheir power light and their virtue scarce—\nThis is what others easily seize.\n\nSmall realms, being light,\nAre often taken by others.\nForced to submit,\nThey must not be greedy.\n\nThus, without battle they destroy another’s city,\nWithout assault they surrender another’s stronghold—\nTheir lands expand, their names grow eminent,\nTheir ancestral halls stand in glory,\nTheir deeds and virtues flow without end—\nThis is what great realms aspire to.\n\nGreat realms, if they but guard their yielding nature,\nCan naturally hope for such benefits.\n\nIn alliance with great realms,\nIn close ties and bonds of kinship—\nWhen disasters strike, great realms share their concern,\nWhen neighboring states are in peril, great realms offer aid,\nThey bend beneath one man yet raise ten thousand above,\nTheir altars honored, their ancestral halls illustrious—\nTheir realm rich, their armies strong,\nTheir people

forgiven, none to blame\"* (*yǒuzuìyǐmiǎn* 有罪以免) is mere **self-indulgence** (*wéiwéiyǐwéi* 无以为)?\n\nThus, this Dao is **held in highest esteem** (*guì* 贵) throughout the world.\n\n**On Calamities** (*Zhǐguī* 指归):\nWood grows from its **root** (*běn* 本) to its **tip** (*mò* 末).\nThe tip depends on the **branches** (*tiáo* 条),\nThe branches on the **limbs** (*zhī* 枝),\nThe limbs on the **trunk**

weak,\nSilent and indistinct—\n**Ren** (*rén* 仁) is gentle and harmonious,\nNourishing and tranquil, **virtue** (*dé* 德) is **power** (*shì* 势) yet **subtle** (*wúxíng* 无形).\n**Great and small** (*dàxiǎo* 大小) are **comprehensive** (*zhōumì* 周密),\nFine and minute are **invisible** (*wúxíng* 无形),\n**Mysterious penetration** (*Xuándá* 玄达) reaches all affairs,\nAnd returns to the **Nameless**

hear** (*zìrán bùtīng* 自然不听).\n\nAh, how painful it is!\nThis warning is **most clear** (*shènmíng* 甚明).\nThe unvirtuous do not preserve themselves—\nThey **burden** (*lěi* 累) the **True** (*Zhēn* 真).\nWhen the burden is complete,\nThey **regret too late** (*fānghuǐ bùjí* 方悔不及).\n\nThis is like **digging a well when thirsty** (*línkě juéjǐng* 临渴掘井),\nNot as wise as **ordering affairs before chaos arises** (*lǐ yú wèiluàn* 理於未乱).\nThese two paths diverge—\nBoth stem from **Daoic practice** (*dàoxíng* 道行),\n**One precedes, one follows** (*zàiqián zàihòu* 在前在后),\n**One thrives, one

      "translated_text": "「Human nature and disposition are such that they delight in honor and favor, abhor lowliness and shame, resent when diminished, rejoice when enriched, take pleasure in being lowered, and scorn being restrained. This is the universal Dao of past and present, and the natural logic of human hearts.\n\nThe worthy practice this even more so; the petty even more so. Therefore, when one cultivates noble speech and conduct, there will be no misfortune in one’s undertakings.\n\nIn ancient times, those who led the people—how could they be abandoned? The officials of Jie and Zhou could be made to follow virtue. The soldiers of Qin and Chu could be made to follow virtue.\n\nWhat is called \"what people do not approve of\"—how could it be abandoned?\n\nThus, if one can win their hearts, the realm may be obtained; if one cannot grasp their intentions, even one’s wives and concubines will not obey.\n\nHow can this be demonstrated?\n\nThe rank of nobility commands the realm,\nWealth possesses the four seas,\nMight and influence are boundless,\nAbsolute power and authority are held—\nthese are what people fear.\n\nTo establish the Son of Heaven.\n\nTo depart from the ranks of foot soldiers,\nTo leave the common troops,\nTo rise with grand purpose like a dragon,\nTo assist the Son of Heaven,\nTo spread the Way and display virtue,\nTo enact all good governance,\nTo let benevolence flow to all households,\nTo honor and illuminate one’s ancestors—\nthese are what people benefit from.\n\nTo appoint the Three Exalted Ministers.\n\nUsing what people fear to seek what they benefit from,\nWith speech that is not beautiful and conduct that is not respectful,\nEven if one presents the great jade tablet or holds precious treasures to offer,\nEven if one rides in a fine carriage with four horses,\nThe worthy’s heart will remain doubtful and hesitant,\nThe Mysterious Sage will remain deeply hidden,\nAnd the gentleman will not come.\n\nBecause the Son of Heaven possesses an awe-inspiring might,\nAnd the Three Exalted Ministers bestow abundant blessings upon the people,\nYet relying solely on oneself to lord over others,\nOffering the jade and silk of favors,\nPeople will not submit to it.\n\nThus, it is said: *It is better to sit and advance this Dao than to labor with carriages and treasures.*\n\nWhen speech and conduct are refined within,\nThen the spirit and qi overflow outward.\nWithout the toil of four horses or the expense of precious jades,\nThe scholars of the land will respond in harmony like the wind,\nAnd the virtuous, heroic, and talented will gather from all directions,\nTheir radiance reaching its peak.\nThe Sage will descend, and the court will abound with gentlemen.\n\nThis is because of *sitting and advancing this Dao*.\n\nWhy did the ancients value this Dao so highly?\nBecause speech aligns with Heaven and Earth yet does not boast,\nConduct harmonizes with human hearts yet does not rely on force,\nReputation is achieved without display,\nAccomplishment is realized without possession.\n\nEmotion and disposition flow naturally,\nNot seized for personal gain,\nBut to follow the Way,\nNot for oneself,\nAll things return to it,\nAnd it governs the realm.\n\nThis is called *obtaining without seeking, having virtue without claiming*—\nThus, it is valued by all under Heaven.\n\n**On the Chapter of Non-Action (Wuwei)**\n\nNon-action is formless,\nNon-doing is silent,\nTastelessness is nameless.\n\nGreat or small, much or little—virtue and power are manifest,\nYet repaying grudges with virtue is done before they arise.\nPlanning for difficulties in ease,\nConsidering what is not yet formed,\nActing for the great in the small,\nMaking the subtle profound—\nThis is how the Sage says that even the brightest ruler\nNever undertakes great matters in their slightest form,\nThus achieving their grandest purpose and aligning with humanity.\n\nThose who make light of promises must be few in trust—*this cannot be done*.\nThose who act on many trifles must face many calamities—*this cannot be relied upon*.\n\nEven the Sage finds difficulty in constant scheming,\nThus ultimately avoiding calamity and achieving completeness.\n\n**On the Principle of Return (Zhigui):**\n\nThe numbers of the Divine Mind,\nThe Dao of Nature—\nWhat is not born does not perish,\nWhat is born does not persist,\nWhat neither perishes nor persists\nIs the birth of what neither perishes nor persists.\n\nFrom this perspective,\nSorrow does not generate sorrow,\nJoy does not generate joy,\nNeither sorrow nor joy\nIs the birth of sorrow and joy.\n\nThus, those dwelling in misfortune gain blessings,\nThose dwelling in blessings suffer misfortune.\nThe master of blessings and misfortune lies with the ruler.\n\nTo act without form,\nTo listen without sound,\nWithout form or sound, it becomes profound and far-reaching—\nThus, *non-action’s function is great*, while *action’s function is small*,\n*Virtue’s power is thin*, while *non-virtue’s power is thick*.\n\nOne who embodies *neither non-being nor being* yet generates *non-being and being*\nCan transform misfortune and blessings,\nNeither misfortune nor blessing,\nYet can resolve both.\n\nLike a mirror before one’s face,\nActing before what has not yet arisen—\nThus, it becomes profound and far-reaching, great and thick.\n\nHence, the Sage does not act for being,\nDoes not act for non-being,\nDoes not act for death,\nDoes not act for life,\nBut wanders in the realm of *non-being*,\nDwells in the space between death and life,\nAdapting and responding naturally,\nThus maintaining the constant.\n\nTherefore, *without looking, they see*,\n*Without listening, they hear*,\nSupporting and stabilizing Heaven and Earth,\nEmbellishing the Way and nourishing the spirit,\nLifting and guiding all things,\nRuling the imperial realm and governing the people,\nFreeing emotions and releasing intentions—\nAll return to their original truth.\n\nThis is called *Non-action as Non-action*—\nSimply responding to the appropriate changes.\n\nThey have never truly known,\nThus they can do without limit.\n\nNot creating life’s burdens,\nNot stirring up affairs,\nNot adding with kindness,\nNot bestowing with benefit,\nTeaching what cannot be taught,\nGuiding what lacks awareness,\nCutting off what the people delight in,\nTo follow their true emotions,\nPermitting what the people abhor,\nTo grasp their true intentions.\n\nExiting the door of untimely death,\nEntering the path of eternal life,\nSoaring in the Mysterious Depths,\nRejoicing in the Great Primordial,\nDim and vast, beyond knowing,\nThick and murky, as if in darkness—\nThe world knows no troubles.\n\nThis is called *Non-doing as doing*—\nSimply altering what has already become.\n\nThey have never truly thought,\nThus they reach *Non-doing*.\n\nTasting what is tasteless,\nObserving what is formless—\nThus they can distinguish the categories of similarity and difference,\nAnd clarify the nature of right and wrong.\n\nActing before what has not yet arisen,\nFixing before it has tilted—\nBrave deeds are unseen,\nWise names are unclaimed,\nBlessings do not arise,\nMisfortunes do not take root—\n*Blessings without blessings*\nRest in the silent,\n*Misfortunes without misfortunes*\nCease in the nameless,\nEnsuring the people’s peace and joy,\nAnd the realm’s great harmony.\n\nThis is called *Tastelessness as taste*—\nSimply discerning what has not yet sprouted.\n\nThey have never truly intended,\nThus they achieve without limit.\n\nTherefore, the ruler worries and alleviates calamity,\nExtends and secures blessings,\nKills traitors who dishonor the lord,\nAvenges those who insult the father,\nOvercomes those who create difficulties,\nDestroys those who stir up chaos,\nRepels bandits who invite disaster,\nPunishes rebels who defy order.\n\nWhen brave deeds are seen, they conflict with Heaven,\nWhen wise names arise, they oppose the Way.」",

      "translated_text": "「When actions stir the people’s delight,\nYet labor yields little virtue—\nWhen deeds are done and the people rejoice,\nYet the giver’s kindness is slight.\n\nIf one cannot practice *wuwei* (無為) as *wuwei*,\nAnd treat affairs as nonexistent,\nThen the vast benefits of earlier efforts\nAre outweighed by the petty gains of later kindness—\nGreat and small differ in measure,\nAnd blame for calamity is unavoidable.\nThus it is said: *\"Great and small, much and little.\"*\n\nTherefore, loyalty and trust are undermined,\nRighteous undertakings perish,\nAnd those who oppose naturally submit,\nWhile the clever fly high.\n\nThose who usurp merit are exposed,\nThose who steal authority are revealed,\nThe violent prosper in chaos,\nThe deceitful thrive in corruption.\n\nRight and wrong are inverted,\nThe realm teeters toward collapse,\nThings lose their natural order,\nAnd states perish in ruin.\n\nThus, it is better to prevent calamity\nThan to remedy it after it has grown great;\nTo act before disorder arises\nIs nobler than to speak after it has begun.\n\nThis is the benefit of *unspeaking*,\nThe nobility of *wuwei*.\n\nHence, the virtuous one\nActs before the first stirrings,\nStays still in the absence of absence,\nSpreads the Dao and bestows virtue,\nTransforms and harmonizes in the mysterious,\nAngers without showing anger,\nSpeaks without uttering words,\nStrikes without daring to attack,\nDefends without a fixed end,\nCommands without force,\nAnd avenges grudges before they sprout.\n\n*Virtue* is the root of order,\n*Grudges* are the end of affairs.\nTo extinguish the end and return to the root,\nOne must cultivate virtue and revert to the true—\nThen affairs and things dissolve unseen before they manifest.\n\nThus it is said:\nTo act before the first stirrings,\nTo speak before speaking—\nIs to avenge grudges with virtue.\n\nPlotting against difficulties while they are easy,\nTreating their fundamental causes,\nEradicating them before signs appear,\nSo they cannot take form—\nThen deeds are as fine as autumn hair,\nAnd achievements as vast as Tai Mountain.\n\nGreatness over smallness,\nTending to things thread by thread,\nRespectful and cautious,\nAs if beginning anew each time,\nNot yielding to desires,\nNot seeking personal advantage,\nAlways opposing what is done,\nAlone preserving the origin—\nWith time, all benefits accumulate,\nDaily progress knows no bounds.\nThough one does not strive for greatness,\nAffairs unfold naturally.\n\nThis is plotting against difficulties while they are easy,\nYet greatness arises from smallness.\n\nTherefore, when great calamities are about to emerge,\nThey are like evil winds invading a person.\nBefore they manifest,\nGuard against them so they do not come.\nWhen they lodge in the skin and hair,\nUse warm compresses to dispel them.\nWhen they reach the joints and tendons,\nApply gentle admonitions to remove them.\nWhen they affect the internal organs,\nA hundred medicines can cure them.\nWhen they penetrate to the marrow,\nEven Heaven and Earth cannot alleviate them,\nAnd *zaohua* (造化) cannot treat them.\n\nThis is what is meant by *\"difficult matters arise from the easy.\"*\n\nWhen great undertakings are about to begin,\nThey are like water flowing from mountains.\nAt first, it dampens and moistens,\nThen ripples appear,\nSteadily trickling and gathering,\nIt becomes rivers and valleys,\nSwelling and surging,\nCapable of carrying ships and floating stones,\nAnd finally forming vast seas,\nDeep and immeasurable.\n\nThis is how great undertakings arise from small beginnings.\n\nThus, when the sage establishes merit and renown,\nEven minute beginnings can become manifest,\nEven hidden origins can become clear,\nSmall beginnings can grow vast,\nAnd concealed truths can become evident—\nTheir ambition lies beneath the myriad people,\nSo they become rulers and kings.\n\nTheir authority shakes the world,\nThe Four Seas are all rectified,\nTheir commands are obeyed, their governance accepted,\nNone can stand against them—\nTheir virtue aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nTheir wisdom shines like the sun and moon.\n\nThe sage never seeks greatness,\nAnd thus achieves it.\n\nTherefore, those who speak much of gratitude\nWill be burdened with many affairs and still lack trust—\nSuch behavior cannot be sustained.\nThose whose hearts easily sway\nWill accumulate difficulties and change—\nSuch behavior cannot be relied upon.\nLight promises lead to few fulfillments.\n\nTrust, when easily given, leads to many calamities—\nThis is the natural order.\n\nThus, the sage remains inwardly silent,\nUnmoved in action, speechless in words,\nUnseeing in gaze, unhearing in listening.\nIn motion, they are like Heaven and Earth,\nIn stillness, like spirits and gods—\nThey achieve without doing,\nThey inspire trust without speaking,\nAdvance with no rivals,\nRetreat with no limits,\nTheir body knows no minor worries,\nTheir state no trivial calamities.\n\nThe sage embodies the Dao,\nDoes not engage in artificial deeds,\nAligns with the true and cultivates virtue,\nAnd naturally faces no calamities—\nThus they never encounter difficulties.\n\nWhy is this so?\nPeril lies in what seems not perilous,\nRuination lies in what seems not ruined—\nIt is clearly visible alone,\nAnd operates through formlessness.\n\nIn times of no danger,\nThey always regard it as dangerous;\nIn times of no ruin,\nThey always regard it as ruinous—\nWith trembling vigilance,\nThey act before the first signs appear,\nThus avoiding peril and ruin.\n\nTheir ease in holding fast is like their ease in maintaining the state and self,\nTheir ease in plotting against calamities is like their ease in preventing disasters before they arise,\nTheir ease in breaking calamities is like their ease in dispersing them before they settle,\nTheir ease in treating calamities is like their ease in transforming their roots before they manifest.\n\nThose who act invite defeat,\nThose who grasp invite loss—\nThus the sage, with *wuwei*, faces no defeat,\nKnowing it comes from itself;\nWith *wuwei* in grasping, faces no loss,\nKnowing virtue comes from itself.\n\nWhen the people engage in affairs,\nThey do so with purpose—\nThe sage always stops them\nBefore their undertakings are fully formed,\nThus avoiding defeat and blame.\n\nTherefore, the sage says of enlightened rulers:\nDesiring what they do not desire,\nThinking what they have not thought—\nThey do not prize difficult-to-obtain treasures,\nNor value jade and pearls.\n\nLearning what they have not learned,\nDoing what is empty—\nThey restore what others have already passed,\nAnd do not cling to the fading.\n\nThey aid the natural unfolding of all things,\nAssisting Heaven and Earth,\nYet do not dare to act artificially,\nNor to uphold false traditions.\n\n*Pointing to the origin:*\nBefore illness takes hold in a person,\nIt is easy for a physician to act;\nBefore a state faces peril,\nIt is easy for counselors to devise strategies;\nBefore grudges sprout like teeth,\nIt is easy to address them;\nBefore minor calamities grow strong,\nIt is easy to relieve them.\n\nHow should this be applied?»",

steady it.\n\nBefore an egg is cracked,\nA single finger can brush it—\nYet once it becomes a soaring wild goose,\nFlapping its wings through the clouds,\nNo snare or net can ensnare it.\n\nWhen a calf is still nursing,\nA single rope can restrain it—\nYet once it becomes a bull,\nNo net can contain it.\n\nWhen a tiger seizes the herd,\nFeeding on oxen and horses,\nNo sword or spear can resist it.\n\nThus, a single drop of water,\nOver time, becomes a river and sea;\nA small serpent, if not killed,\nTransforms into a divine dragon.\n\nAccumulated goodness leads to auspicious fortune,\nUnchecked evil leads to ruin.\n\nTherefore, when a successor-ruler governs,\nWith no grievances or malice,\nMinisters and officials are harmonized,\nThe people submit in peace,\nNeighboring states trade freely,\nNo slanderers or traitors exist,\nThe realm is tranquil and undisturbed,\nSuperior and inferior in accord.\nAt such times,\nRule requires no coercion,\nGovernance demands no force—\nNon-action, non-interference,\nAnd none can overcome it.\nIts stability is effortless to maintain.\n\nYet when a state teeters toward peril,\nThe people face ruin,\nDisasters loom though not yet manifest—\nAt this juncture,\nSafety rests within oneself, not others.\nCounsel need not come from sages,\nStrength need not come from warriors—\nYet even on one’s deathbed,\nDisaster may already be sealed.\nIts onset is easy to avert.\n\nWhen the ruler abandons the Dao,\nMinisters harbor resentment,\nNeighboring states cease trade,\nOfficials grow negligent,\nDisasters take root—\nThough still weak and fragile.\nAt this stage,\nWise men plot in secret,\nYet before action is taken, peril arises,\nBefore force is applied, ruin shatters.\nIts fragility is easy to break.\n\nWhen the ruler strays from rectitude,\nMinisters err in counsel,\nNeighboring states harbor grudges,\nThe people waver,\nDisasters have already surfaced—\nRoots and branches unmoored,\nAmbition rises, yet lacks support,\nAlliances form but do not bind.\nAt this point,\nHonoring the worthy while suppressing the masses,\nSevering loyalty and resolve,\nListening to whispers and probing faults,\nSeeking blame within oneself—\nYet even then, advisors scatter before battle is joined.\nIts subtlety is easy to disperse,\nThough already far harder than when unmanifest.\n\nThus, fortune and calamity arise from the nameless,\nLife and death emerge from the subtle.\nThese two forces intertwine,\nShifting like winds and waves,\nExtending and contracting like tides—\nAdvancing and retreating in chaos.\nTo hear them is impossible,\nTo see them is invisible,\nCunning cannot act upon them,\nWisdom cannot discern them.\nThe mechanisms of life and death, fortune and ruin,\nAre subtle, chaotic, and unseen.\n\nTherefore, the sage transforms through the Dao,\nTeaches through personal example,\nActs before things take form,\nGovern before disorder arises—\nWithout intervention, things settle naturally,\nWithout nurturing, things preserve themselves.\nAction aligns with fortune,\nStillness diverges from ruin,\nMysterious and obscure—\nNone perceive its origin.\n\nPreventing chaos before it arises,\nRectifying before imbalance,\nCutting off deceit at its root,\nSuppressing falsehood at its source,\nSealing the door to vice,\nBlocking the path to wrongdoing—\nBefore sprouts take hold,\nBefore signs appear,\nBefore destruction is visible,\nBefore annihilation is complete—\nTeach without teaching,\nGuide without naming,\nKnow without knowing,\nShape without form—\nChaos cannot take root,\nDisorder cannot emerge,\nThe world governs itself,\nLife unfolds naturally.\n\nThis is to act before existence,\nTo govern before chaos.\n\nAs for the great tree of Tai Mountain,\nIts roots rest in the shade,\nIts branches reach the sun—\nBranches sprawl, leaves spread,\nFruit lush and green,\nTrunks wide enough to embrace,\nTowers high beyond measure—\nYet it grows from nothingness,\nCompletes itself through non-action.\n\nWhat is called an embrace-worthy tree\nArises from the tiniest sprout.\nA nine-tiered tower,\nBroad as hills, towering a hundred *ren* high,\nPiercing the heavens—\nYet it begins with a single clod of earth,\nRises from the ground.\n\nThus, the great is not forced to be great,\nThe small is not forced to be small,\nThe high is not forced to ascend,\nThe low is not forced to descend.\nNeither great nor small—\nThen greatness and smallness emerge.\nNeither high nor low—\nThen height and depth manifest.\n\nTherefore, the artificer\nDoes not leave traces of his craft,\nThe non-artificer\nProvides the path for creation.\nNot great, not small—\nThis is the path of non-action.\nNot high, not low—\nThis is the path of non-artificer.\nYet greatness and smallness,\nHighness and lowness—\nThese are the traces of action,\nThe marks of the artificer.\n\nThus, what is completed is ruined,\nWhat is pursued becomes harm,\nWhat is clung to leads to death,\nWhat is fostered is abandoned.\nGrasping what one desires,\nOne loses it.\nClinging to what one thinks,\nOne loses it.\nHolding onto oneself,\nOne loses oneself.\nFixating on one’s spirit,\nOne loses it.\n\nSeeking the path of non-action\nYet clinging to traces of existence—\nThis is why the artificer brings ruin,\nThe grasper invites loss.\n\nTherefore, the sage acts without acting,\nGenerates all things,\nDoes not cling, yet directs desire—\nLike two craftsmen building a high tower,\nOr Heaven and Earth nurturing mighty trees,\nNaturally, without effort.\nNon-action brings no ruin,\nNon-clinging brings no loss.\n\nVirtue and power do not envy,\nDivine clarity does not harm,\nHarmony knows no obstruction,\nGreatness knows no defeat.\nLife and death follow their course,\nFortune and misfortune find their due.\nThose who align with the Way attain it,\nThose who stray from it suffer it.\n\nWhen people face ruin,\nIt is because they abandon spontaneity\nAnd rely on cleverness and strength,\nRejecting their nature while embracing their undoing.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause they seek what they seek,\nDesire what they desire.\n\nMen’s undertakings often falter at completion\nBecause they cling to desire and lose their foundation.\n\nIf one could truly\nTreasure the end as the beginning,\nAct without desiring,\nGuard what is not to be occupied,\nMove before the origin,\nReturn before the start—\nActing as if not acting,\nHaving as if not having,\nThough seemingly unaccomplished,\nThings naturally

expanse,\nRaised and discarded, ever contrary to the world—\nAll things respond in kind,\nThus attaining depth and distance.\n\nThe world’s great reversal,\nMoving with the divine transformation,\nAiding Heaven, assisting Earth,\nDaring not to create what is good.\n\nThe true practitioner of the Way is manifest.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in the Way\nGoverned themselves thus—\nNot to enlighten the people with knowledge,\nBut to blind them, sealing their hearts.\n\nThe people’s difficulty in governance cannot be measured,\nFor their wisdom abandons loyalty and sincerity.\n\nTo rule with wisdom benefits the state but harms the people;\nNot to rule with wisdom preserves the natural purity—\nThe state’s blessing, the people’s survival.\n\nKnowing these two paths—calamity and blessing—\nThese are the fundamental patterns of right and wrong.\n\nAlways knowing the patterns to apply to the ruler’s body—\nThis is called the profound virtue, unseen and unheard.\n\nProfound virtue is deep, unseen,\nFar, unimaginable,\nContrary to things, distinct from the spirit—\nUntil it reaches the perfect harmony of the world.\n\n**The Conclusion:**\nDao and virtue, divine and mundane,\nPure and impure, the Great Harmony—\nHeaven, Earth, and all things,\nLike roots and branches.\n\nNumbers follow in sequence,\nQi transformations connect—\nSuccess and decline, fortune and misfortune,\nAll share in the same fate.\n\nThe intent of Dao and virtue,\nThe heart of Heaven and Earth—\nPeaceful generation, joyful repose,\nHatred and injury, life and death—\nThus the Sage is named King of all things.\n\nBenefiting others brings their blessing,\nHarming them brings their fear—\nThe Sage fears greatly,\nFearful of future calamity,\nDeeply tracing its origins—\nNone better than returning to nature,\nFor nature’s path lies in the formless.\n\nHow may this be made clear?\nZhuangzi said:\nHeaven and Earth do not know the workings of virtue,\nYet they act accordingly;\nAll things do not see Heaven and Earth’s methods,\nYet they cannot be preserved;\nThe masses do not recognize the ruler’s intentions,\nYet they may be at ease;\nThe limbs and orifices do not understand the heart’s guidance,\nYet they remain whole.\n\nThe ruler of all things is like the heart to the body.\nThe heart to the body—\nWhat comes first or last?\nFlowing through the blood and vessels,\nPresent everywhere,\nAbove and below, inside and out—\nNothing escapes its influence.\nMoving with change, containing the spirit,\nBalanced within, contrary without—\nThus all is preserved.\n\nTherefore, the ancient emperors and kings\nFollowed Dao and virtue,\nOrganized divine and mundane,\nUnified purity and impurity,\nLed the Great Harmony—\nNot with innate knowledge to act,\nNot to open the world or guide customs,\nBut to dull the people’s senses,\nSeal their hearts,\nPrevent them from knowing,\nReturn them to nature.\n\nThe ancients who excelled in the Way\nDid not enlighten the people,\nBut sought to blind them.\n\nThus, placing the people in the bright and clear,\nWhile dwelling in the murky and obscure,\nTeaching them ignorance,\nGuiding them with the formless—\nFilial piety and brotherly love unseen,\nRen and righteousness unexalted,\nThe ruler without honor,\nThe wise without renown.\n\nTeaching without teaching,\nFlowing through the four seas,\nDoing without doing,\nReaching the eight directions—\nMoving with Heaven and Earth in rhythm,\nResting with Dao and virtue in harmony,\nAll things flourishing together,\nEach knowing its place—\nNames and realities arising together,\nEach fulfilling its role.\n\nHarmonious qi flows freely,\nThe world in childlike simplicity—\nNo knowledge, no desire,\nNo action, no achievement—\nThe heart like wood and soil,\nThe will like dead ashes—\nSeeing no difference, no fortune or misfortune,\nThus the people are easily governed and the world may be at peace.\n\nTherefore, what benefits the people is their ease,\nWhat sustains them is their life—\nYet the people stray from ease and life, making governance difficult,\nBecause of their knowing.\n\nWhen the people know, they desire to live;\nDesiring to live, they begin their pursuits;\nPursuits begun, fame and gain arise;\nFame and gain arise, contention and strife follow;\nStrife and contention breed great deceit;\nGreat deceit breeds difficulty in governance.\n\nThe people’s difficulty in governance stems from their excess of knowledge.\n\nThus, ruling with knowledge,\nThe world spawns cleverness, deceit, and artifice,\nStrange things multiply,\nDesires know no end,\nLuxury and licentiousness cease not,\nDeceit and perversion flourish,\nThe bold and the cunning vie for dominance,\nNames proliferate in the valleys—\nGreat calamity arises.\n\nMinisters deceive their lords,\nSons rebel against their fathers,\nWhite is called black,\nAbsence is called presence,\nNames and realities invert,\nBanditry and slaughter ensue.\n\nUnsettled and restless, none find peace,\nLight and reckless, none remain whole—\nArmies march lightly, the world turns to war,\nThe dead numberless, rivers run with blood.\n\nGrief and resentment stir the heavens,\nStars scatter, sun and moon dim,\nYin and yang lose order,\nAll things are harmed—\nMountains wither, valleys dry,\nThousands of miles of barren earth,\nThe world in ruin,\nUntil people eat one another.",

      "translated_text": "The fault lies not with Heaven,\nFor the Sage above delights in wisdom and instructs the myriad people.\nWhen the excess of favoring wisdom reaches this point,\nIt is said that governing with wisdom is the ruin of the state—\nA truth that cannot be false.\n\nAbandon cleverness and artifice,\nLet virtue be pure and simple.\nKnow alone, ponder alone,\nDesire nothing seen.\nFollow the people’s heart,\nClose their ears and eyes to falsehoods.\nEat no five flavors,\nWear no five colors.\nThe ruler, like Heaven and Earth,\nThe people, like grasses and trees.\nDwell in rocky retreats, find peace in valleys,\nDrink water, eat grass, seek no grains.\nKnow mother, recognize father,\nYet see no kin.\nStuporous and unknowing,\nUnaware of east or west,\nMen and women take no pleasure in one another,\nFathers and sons feel no fondness.\nWood and stone are not despised,\nGold and jade are not prized.\nClusters live together in harmony,\nThe world unites in one mind,\nThe eight extremes share purpose,\nThe nine regions align in wind.\nBorer-beetles do not act,\nPoisonous beasts do not arise,\nSpiritual dragons dwell among people,\nQilin and phoenixes roam the courts.\n\nGentle winds blow,\nSweet springs trickle,\nSweet dew falls,\nRed grasses flourish,\nFine millet thrives lush,\nAll things live eternally.\n\nThis is not Heaven’s blessing,\nBut the ruler’s knowing of the Unknowable,\nNaming the Unnameable.\nThe Unknowing-Knowing,\nThe Unnameable-Name,\nAligns with the Dao—\nHow could it be otherwise?\n\nThus, dimmed wisdom recognizes stupidity,\nAnd aligns with the Dao’s essence.\nKnowing stupidity, knowing wisdom,\nBoth align with the Dao’s intent.\nGovernance follows this,\nSometimes bringing harm, sometimes benefit.\nTo discern harm and benefit,\nGreat harmony naturally arises.\nTo grasp benefit and harm,\nAll things naturally align.\n\nTo govern with wisdom brings calamity and precedent;\nTo govern without wisdom brings blessing and virtue.\nThese two paths serve as models.\nEver knowing these models,\nThis is called *Xuan De* (玄德).\n\nThus, the recognition of stupidity and wisdom\nOvercomes all obstacles.\nIn purity and stillness, a tranquil foundation,\nA hidden blessing for all beings,\nUnseen by the world—\nThus it is called *Xuan De*.\n\n*Xuan De* is profound, immeasurable;\nDistant, beyond reach;\nOpposed to things, none can overcome it.\nIt is said: *Xuan De* is profound, distant, opposed to things.\nWhen *Xuan De* descends,\nIt drifts, surges, retreats, indistinct—\nOpposing things in action,\nHarmonizing with virtue and the Way,\nGuiding spirit and clarity,\nEmbracing all lands,\nUnbounded in scope.\nBeyond the six extremes, within the minutest measure,\nNo place is untouched by its virtue and benevolence,\nPreserving life and nature,\nEnding at Heaven’s appointed time,\nNurturing what is natural.\nThis is called *Great Harmony*.\n\n**The Chapter on Rivers and Seas**\nRivers and seas become kings of all valleys\nBecause they are thus—\nThey are below all streams,\nThus they rule all valleys without submission.\n\nTherefore, the Sage says of the enlightened ruler:\nTo place oneself above the people is to occupy the highest position,\nYet to speak in humility aligns with the people’s hearts.\nTo act before the people is to avoid their calamities,\nYet to place oneself last ensures their security.\nTo lead the people is to be their model,\nYet to harm none clarifies one’s virtue.\nThe world willingly follows,\nYet the ruler does not know he is being offered—\nNot to compete for position,\nThus none can contend, none can prevail.\n\n**The Principle of Return:**\nVirtue and the Way do not create the myriad things,\nYet the myriad things arise naturally.\nHeaven and Earth do not gather the myriad beings,\nYet the myriad beings find refuge in them.\nNatural things do not seek to rule,\nYet things rule themselves.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth, vast and myriad, are ruled by the Dao;\nThe myriad suns blazing, are ruled by Heaven;\nThe yin essence flowing, is ruled by Earth;\nThe naked dwell in caves, ruled by the Sage;\nThe winged soar in emptiness, ruled by the Divine Phoenix;\nThe furred tread the earth, ruled by the Qilin;\nThe scaled dwell in waters, ruled by the Spirit Dragon;\nThe shelled dwell in marshes, ruled by the Sacred Tortoise;\nAll streams converge, ruled by the River and Sea.\n\nThese nine rulers\nDo not claim dominion over things,\nYet things return to them.\nWithout laws or measures,\nYet things govern themselves.\nWithout benevolence or righteousness,\nYet things attach to them.\nWithout exerting wisdom or strength,\nYet things fear them.\n\nWhy is this so?\nThey embody the Dao, harmonize with nature,\nDo nothing to things,\nYet things transform under their influence.\n\nThus, the River and Sea’s rule\nIs not through accumulating virtue or deeds,\nNor through flowing spirit and grace,\nNor through bestowing favors to win allegiance;\nNor through upholding rites and propriety,\nNor through eloquence and cunning,\nNor through displaying wisdom and skill,\nNor through extraordinary actions or schemes,\nNor through wielding might and terror,\nNor through exhausting life’s energies to control them—\nBut in stillness and humility, waiting below,\nIn non-action and non-seeking,\nAll streams come naturally.\n\nThe streams do not hear of the Sea’s beauty,\nYet they are transformed by its virtue and return in reverence.\nNor does the Sea bind or teach them,\nNor set paths or mark directions—\nYet water, piercing metal, shattering stone,\nBoring cliffs, toppling mountains,\nRushing over hills,\nHastens to the Sea without return—\nForm and nature align,\nThings act naturally.\n\nFrom this, it is seen:\nGreat is the Way of humility and self-effacement,\nHarm cannot injure it,\nWisdom cannot seize it,\nStrong without battle,\nMighty without coercion,\nSilent and doing nothing,\nYet trading with all things.\n\nValleys are low but not east or west,\nThus they reach their end without exhaustion.\nRivers and seas dwell below but are not vast,\nThus they rule without ceasing.\nRivers and seas rule all valleys\nBecause they excel in humility—\nTruly so.\n\nThus, the enlightened king and sage,\nDesiring to honor the people,\nFollows nature’s essence,\nNurtures virtue’s grace,\nSpeaks in humble words, bows with respect,\nAssociates with the common folk,\nViews himself as the earth,\nServes the people as Heaven,\nIlluminated in solitary knowing yet unfathomable,\nOutstanding in singular ability yet untraceable,\nDeep in insight, broad in reach, yet impassable,\nClear and bright, flowing yet unobstructed—\nNot to dominate things,\nBut to follow, placing the people first.",

intends to save,\nIt shields from calamity—\nEnveloping life within.\n\nThe skilled warrior does not rely on force,\nThe skilled fighter does not rage,\nThe skilled victor does not retaliate,\nThe skilled ruler wins hearts—\nThus, their words and deeds are revered below.\n\nThis is called the virtue of *non-contention*—\nBlessings spontaneously arise.\n\nUsing others’ strength to achieve their deeds—\nThis is called *aligning with Heaven*,\nMatching Heaven’s course.\nThe ancient ultimate sages exhausted the Dao.\n\n**Reflections:**\nThings may share similarity yet differ,\nOr differ yet share similarity,\nOr appear false yet be true,\nOr true yet be false—\nThus the sage knows no woe,\nWhile the multitude suffers and grieves.\n\nThe sun and moon rise and set—\nDifferent yet equally bright.\nThe wise and foolish share form,\nYet their hearts differ.\nThe sage harmonizes with the world without distress,\nWhile the petty man seeks distinction—\nThus, he bears sorrow.\n\nHence it is said:\nThere is similarity within difference,\nTruth within falsehood.\n\nHow does one demonstrate this?\nZhuangzi said:\nThe rising and setting of the sun and moon—\nTheir brightness is the same.\nHuman life and death—\nTheir form is identical.\nThe seasons’ divisions—\nTheir benefits are equal.\nThe sage and the commoner—\nTheir appearance is alike.\nThe open-minded and the closed—\nTheir deeds are the same.\nThe Daoist and the infant—\nTheir efficacy is identical.\n\nAll these things,\nThough internally varied,\nExternally align—\nNone but the sage can clarify them.\n\nThus, the world harbors suspicions,\nDazzled by false appearances,\nEntangled in conflicting judgments—\nHence the sage appears unworthy.\n\nThe world calls me greatly unworthy.\nWhy so?\nThose who grasp the Dao—\nExternally absent, internally present,\nStudy to transform their nature,\nAct to govern themselves,\nSubstantial yet appearing empty,\nMysterious and indistinct,\nAs if without purpose,\nSpeech sparse, demeanor humble,\nAppearance crude and vulgar,\nYet their essence is boundless,\nTheir nature transcendent,\nQuiet and withdrawn,\nAs if without end,\nAvoiding renown, escaping influence,\nResting with the divine in rise and fall,\nEmbodying the Dao, walking in harmony,\nAll things in accord,\nNot conforming to the times,\nFriendly with Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe multitude, however, feigns and deceives,\nConsiders straightforwardness as ugliness,\nSuffers from misdirection,\nCalls it illness.\n\nOnly the great thus appears unworthy—\nHence the world deems it sickness.\n\nThe petty man is otherwise:\nWide learning, many knowledges,\nUsing wisdom to gain fame,\nUnusual conduct, conspicuous deeds,\nCreating doubt about virtue,\nDeceiving the world, ordering customs,\nAdorning speech, embellishing appearance,\nHumbling himself to curry favor,\nAnticipating intentions to win hearts,\nForming factions, harboring thieves.\nLaboring little yet receiving heavy rewards,\nAchieving few deeds yet holding high rank,\nWhile the nation grows poor and his family rich,\nThe ruler weakens while he grows powerful.\nWielding power to create change,\nSeizing advantage in prosperity,\nHis name and influence resound,\nShaking distant lands,\nArrogant, extravagant, violent,\nUnrestrained, unchecked,\nCompliant when favored, rebellious when opposed,\nActions costing lives, inaction breeding corruption,\nOpening his mouth to harm the people.\n\nThis is what the world honors,\nWhat society calls *resemblance*.\n\nIf so, then:\nThe Dao departs,\nThe divine withdraws,\nHeaven and Earth abhor,\nYin and Yang reject,\nKindred reject him,\nThe people do not follow,\nHis actions meet no end,\nHis stillness yields no gain,\nLife brings harm,\nDeath brings blessing—\nThe multitude, misled, leads others astray,\nTheir gains are meager,\nTheir days prolonged.\n\nThus, the petty man’s *resemblance* endures in triviality.\n\nBut those who grasp the Dao are otherwise:\nTheir body is empty, yet compassion accumulates,\nThey regard all things as themselves.\n\nFirst: *compassion*.\nRestraining form, moderating appearance,\nReturning to subtlety.\n\nSecond: *frugality*.\nSilent and withdrawn, trusting what comes after,\nNot leading the world,\nHarmonizing with nature’s course.\n\nThird: *not daring to lead the world*.\n\nTheir actions and stillness contrast with the multitude,\nTheir comings and goings pass through different gates,\nThey do not use courage to be courageous—\nThus, they do not rage, yet the world fears them.\n*Compassion thus generates courage.*\n\nThey do not use expansiveness to expand—\nThus, they do not bestow, yet the world follows them.\n*Frugality thus expands.*\n\nThey do not lead—\nThus, without speaking, the world reveres them.\n*Not daring to lead the world, thus perfecting the vessel.*\n\nHence, compassion transforms into courage,\nFrugality into expansiveness,\n\"Trusting what comes after\" into leadership—\nContrary to harmony, opposing the divine,\nDefying nature’s course,\nBlessings distance themselves,\nCalamities draw near,\nThe great fate is severed,\nDivine essence disperses,\nHeaven and Earth cannot sustain,\nThe Dao and virtue cannot endure,\nAt death, unaware,\nBlaming fate, reproaching Heaven.\n\nNot because fate is meager,\nNor because men are malevolent—\nBut because they revel in arrogance,\nDiscard the Dao, and rely on force.\n\nThis is called:\nAbandoning compassion for rigidity,\nFrugality for ostentation,\n\"Trusting what comes after\" for leadership—\nThus, death ensues.\n\nFor compassion as conduct—\nMost harmonious and true,\nIn action, it mobilizes strength,\nIn stillness, it aligns with Heaven’s will,\nHumbling the weak, ruling all things,\nRectifying the world, saving the people,\nHarmonizing Heaven and humanity,\nIn war, undefeatable,\nIn defense, unassailable.",

leave no trace.\nProfound and subtle, its transformations know no beginning,\nYet it remains close to me—\nI do not grasp its workings,\nNor do they comprehend my power.\nHow, then, can they benefit me?\n\nTherefore, the household dwells in ease and finds joy,\nThe disciple rejoices and takes delight.\nWhen people harbor utmost sincerity,\nThey treat me as their own child—\nLeaving home and crossing borders,\nThey gather like crowds at a marketplace.\nThey toil in farming and weaving with vigor,\nRest at dusk and rise at dawn,\nTheir movements follow disciplined formation,\nNo one dares act alone,\nSupplying teacher and pupil\nAs if honoring father and mother.\n\nWeighing advantage to claim victory,\nThe enemy rises not.\nNo battle fought, yet all under Heaven submit,\nNo assault launched, yet the feudal lords bow.\nHeaven and Earth shelter and nurture all,\nSun and Moon illuminate and reveal all—\nMajestic and boundless,\nEach content in its own domain.\n\nWhy so?—\nCompassion and mercy set things in motion,\nAligning with Heaven’s intent,\nNot daring to act against its will.\nWhen armies face each other,\nThe merciful prevail.\n\n**My words are easy to understand—**\n**Yet none can know the unknowable.**\n**My actions are simple to follow—**\n**Yet none can emulate the unemulated.**\n\nYet my words have a lineage,\nMy deeds a sovereign principle—\nUnspoken yet inherent,\nNatural yet unforced.\nOnly those who fail to recognize me\nAnd differ from my ways\nDo not comprehend me,\nDo not affirm my truth.\nFew know me—\nCommon folk say, *\"Then you are noble, you alone are true.\"*\n\nThus, the Sage—\nThe wise ruler—\nClad in coarse garments, humble in body,\nYet treasures virtue within, rich in spirit.\n**Pointing to the source:**\nWhat is formless and soundless yet guides all things naturally?\nThe **Dao/Way** and the **Divine**#5.\nWhat is formed and audible yet guides all things naturally?\nEarth and Heaven.\nThe **Divine’s** transformations surge and flow,\nHeaven and Earth speak in silence.\nThe surge transforms all without exception,\nThe silence reveals all without fail.\n**Divine qi**#6 and vitality pass on,\nResponding to each other’s impulses—\nReturning to boundless emptiness,\nExquisitely subtle and wondrous,\nThey rest in nature.\n\nThey lead all things without end.\n\nThus, **spoken words are but tools of expression—**\n**Action is the ruin of authenticity.**\n**Non-action, no words—**\n**This is the apex of achievement**\n**And the key to enduring life.**\n\nTherefore, the Sage speaks of what is unspeakable,\nActs without doing—\nWords to silence words,\nActions to halt actions.\n**The path of ceasing speech:**\nDiscard the heart and mind’s designs,\n**The art of halting action:**\nAbandon human cleverness and wisdom.\nBecome foolish and guileless,\nKnow nothing, desire nothing.\nWithout desire comes stillness,\nStillness brings emptiness,\nEmptiness yields substance,\nSubstance births the **Divine**#7.\nMovement returns to the **Great Primordial**#8,\nStillness to nature—\nPreserve the self, safeguard the realm,\nWealth and honor fade not,\nAll creatures fulfill their aspirations,\nAnd attain lasting life.\n\nThese are words easy to grasp,\nActions simple to follow—\nYet Heaven and Earth cannot fathom them,\nCannot emulate them.\nWhy so?\n\nThe rulers of this world delight in knowledge,\nStrive to please their hearts,\nSee not the Great Dao,\nRecognize not nature—\nThey take action as action,\nSpeak words as words,\nExhausting knowledge to spawn deeds,\nSeeking comfort in their own inclinations,\nYet they deem this as the common way,\nAnd suffer afflictions all their lives—\nTheir essence fades, their emotions shift,\nThey sink deep into confusion and stray far from truth,\nTheir vitality dulls, their spirit unsettles,\nTheir bodies appear solid yet their inner selves are hollow,\nForced silence breeds guilt,\nForced stillness invites calamity.\n\nThus, they look yet do not see,\nThey are told yet do not hear—\nNot from spite, but because they believe otherwise.\nThey refuse loyal counsel,\nNot from spite toward themselves,\nBut because they think no such principle exists,\nAnd so they do not follow it.\n\nThe Sage’s words spring from nature,\nTake root in the **Divine**#9—\nEver dwelling in their opposite#10,\nBetween silence and utterance.\nExquisitely subtle and wondrous,\nThey return to nature—\nBright yet as unseen,\nHeard yet as unheard,\nPermeating yet appearing blocked,\nReaching yet seeming confined.\n\nTheir deeds begin in nature,\nFlow through the **Divine**—\nEver abiding in harmony,\nBetween action and inaction.\n**Pure, still, yielding, weak—**\n**Movement refined, actions delicate—**\n**Simplicity, ease, retreat, and self-effacement**\n**Return to non-action.**\n\nThis is the **source of words, the master of deeds.**\n\nEmptiness unites with the **Dao/Way**,\nSerenity dwells in life,\nTimely harmony secures the realm,\nEstablishing teachings to nurture the people.\n**Nourish with no desire—**\n**Guide with nature—**\n**Bestow with Heaven and Earth—**\n**Grant with mountains and rivers—**\n**Enrich with years and seasons—**\n**Honor with existence—**\n**Protect with no worry—**\n**Ensure with no calamity—**\nWithout desire, nothing is lost,\nWithout joy, nothing is sustained.\nPeople without a ruler,\nA ruler without people—\nPerish through knowledge and cleverness,\nRely on the **Dao/Way**, lean on Heaven—\nAll nations in harmony,\nUnited under one sovereign.\n\nThis is the grandest of undertakings,\nThe most exalted of achievements—\nYet the world deems it otherwise.\nThe **Dao/Way** makes it so,\nLogic knows no deception.\nThe wise are clouded by their own understanding,\nThus they refuse to believe.\n\nThe world cannot know me,\nNot because my **Dao/Way** is insignificant,\nNor because my deeds are shallow,\nNor because the world delights in ruin and evil,\nRejoices in disaster and misfortune—\nHeaven’s nature opposes mine,\nHuman desires diverge from my truth,\nWisdom ensnared by desires\nEndures weakness all its life;\n**Divine qi** does not affirm me,\nHearts and minds do not accept my words.\n\nThus, they cannot see my clarity,\nCannot hear my insight—\nDeep words invite slander,\nGreat deeds invite reproach,\nUnique vision is

to cleverness and profit,\nThus they are not plagued by harm nor enslaved by the crowd.\n\nThe Sage does not fret over non-existence,\nFor fretting over the **Dao/Way**’s unknown is the sickness itself—\nThus they are not troubled by calamity nor ensnared by comparison.\n\n**Chapter on Returning:**\nThe teaching of **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** is naturalness itself.\nThe verification of naturalness is resonance—\nAll things have form and sound,\nTaking and discarding echo with resonance—\nNot only the myriad creatures.\n\nWhen form moves, it does not generate form but generates shadow;\nWhen sound moves, it does not generate sound but generates echo.\nThe non-existent generates the existent without itself existing,\nThe covering generates reversal without itself being covered.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** governs through *wuwei* (non-action),\nYet the knowing are vexed by excessive affairs.\nThe infant thrives through ignorance,\nThe aged decline through overreaching.\n\nFrom this, it is seen:\nFolly is the shape of clever wisdom,\nClever wisdom is the shadow of folly.\n*Wuwei* is the original sound of spontaneous action;\nSpontaneous action is the echo of *wuwei*.\nClever wisdom is the net of chaos,\nAction is the rope of ruin.\n\nFolly, through *wuwei*, is like form and sound—\nThe root, thus able to generate clever wisdom.\nAction, like shadow and echo—\nThe branch, thus bringing disorder and ruin.\n\nHence, the myriad things cannot be harmonized,\nHeaven and Earth cannot be conformed to.\nHarmonizing leads to the loss of harmony,\nConforming leads to the loss of conformity.\nOnly by not harmonizing can harmony be achieved,\nOnly by not conforming can conformity be attained.\n\nSpeaking of clever wisdom’s use,\nChasing traces spawns waves—\nThe principles of harmony and conformity\nAre extinguished with time.\n\nThus, action is not permissible,\nNon-action is permissible.\nHence, the secure do not know danger,\nThe chaotic do not know governance.\n\nLike shadows following forms, there is no escape;\nSeeking shadows without movement yields nothing.\nThus, knowing yet severing knowledge—\nNot constrained by knowing.\nSelf-destruction is its nature,\nThus it is not constrained.\n\nNot using knowing to know—\nAlso not constrained by knowing.\nThough its use is lost,\nIt does not know knowing as use—\nThus both are unconstrained.\n\nTheir unconstrained ways differ,\nYet in not being constrained, they are one.\nBoth do not use knowing—thus one.\n\nYet severing knowledge is for oneself,\nUsing knowledge is for others—\nThus they differ.\n\nTherefore, the Sage cultivates the nature of openness,\nRoams in the realm of profound silence,\nDwells in the land of incapacity,\nEntrusts the body of non-knowing—\nSilent as empty space,\nFleeting as death,\nThe heart scheming for nothing,\nThe will governing nothing,\nYet clarity and insight move,\nIlluminating the four seas,\nDulling the people’s ears and eyes,\nShowing them emptiness—\nKitchens unformed, sounds and colors not aroused,\nKnowledge does not arise, calamities cease.\n\nWithout speech, the world is governed;\nWithout action, the world is transformed.\nThe people bow without rebellion,\nLook up without imitation,\nSincere and upright, each guards their true nature—\nDazed and vast, all fulfill their natural end.\n\nThe dead have no posthumous names,\nThe living have no titles—\nThus they succeed endlessly, numberless as the sands of time.\n\nThrough knowing ignorance, such benefits arise—\nThus called the highest.\n\nThe next level:\nEmotion finds no delight,\nNature no joy,\nThe heart no ease,\nThe will no gain—\nHating ignorance of filial piety,\nSickened by ignorance of fraternal duty,\nNeither dimming **virtue/power** nor recognizing righteousness,\nNo rites or ceremonies,\nGuarding their innate purity—\nLike deer or wild geese,\nNeither in sorrow nor in chaos,\nAs blind, as deaf—\nNo palaces for rulers,\nNo cities for the people,\nNo laws for the land,\nNo shame in the world.\n\nThrough deficient knowing,\nThey perform actions like sickness.\n\nThus it is said:\nThe known knows not—this is the sickness of mistaking ignorance for wisdom.\n\nThe sickly are not sick,\nEntrusting themselves to the **Dao/Way**,\nNeither speaking nor acting,\nYet **virtue/power** and awe arise naturally.\n\nHeaven and Earth in harmony,\nMingled and vast,\nLike turbid waters settling,\nLike a dignified guest arriving—\nAll creatures return to simplicity,\nVanishing into stillness,\nMoving without dismemberment,\nResting without fracture—\nRulers and people flourish together,\nThe world in quietude,\nPerishing in trivial gains,\nYet enjoying great blessings.\n\nSilent governance—\nPlans cannot be plotted,\nMeasurements cannot be taken.\nThe Sage always seems sickly,\nThus not sick—\nAble to align with the **Dao/Way**,\nBeyond calculation or measure.\n\nIf differing from this,\nKnowledge arises and deceit takes form.\n\nHow to demonstrate this?\nWhen **virtue/power** and **Dao/Way** decay,\nPurity vanishes,\nStrange things proliferate,\nKnowledge spreads,\nRites and norms emerge,\nRankings and measures are clear—\nThe myriad things have order,\nA hundred affairs have codes.\nBorders are drawn, cities built,\nStates divided into districts and villages.\nNations have loyal ministers,\nFamilies have filial children,\nInner records, outer omissions,\nPaired bodies as companions,\nTaking from one to give to another,\nStriving for mutual enrichment—\nThe strong grow mighty, the weak perish.\nSacrifices to Heaven, Earth, great mountains and rivers,\nEnfeoffments at Tai Mountain,\nPilgrimages to Liangfu—\nGradual traditions, some true, some false.\nThousands of lawsuits decided,\nBranded criminals fill the roads,\nSubjects kill their rulers,\nSons kill their fathers,\nNations fall, families break—\nNumberless.\nThe world reaps the benefits of knowledge,\nYet suffers the guilt of death.\n\nThe knowing of ignorance,\nYet forcing knowledge upon ignorance—\nThis is the true knowing.\n\nFrom this, it is clear:\nSevering knowledge is blessing,\nLoving knowledge is ruin.\n\nThus, even a **virtue/power**-filled ruler,\nChanging resolve and heart,\nGenerating myriad affairs to teach the people,\nPraying and sacrificing for great governance—\nNaturalness will not comply.\n\nIf a **virtue/power**-filled ruler temporarily abandons the **Dao/Way** and indulges desire,\nThen blessing does not become blessing—\nThis is the nature of rites.\n\nIf a fallen ruler discards cleverness and desire,\nSevers all to halt affairs,\nCultivates the **Dao/Way** and practices **virtue/power**,\nAbandons heart and intent, even seeking

      "translated_text": "Now the fallen ruler temporarily turns his heart toward the **Dao/Way**,\nThen ruin does not become ruin—\nThus, the form does not obey.\n\nTherefore, the rush and retreat, the abandoning and taking up,\nAre the **Dao/Way** of the Sage-King’s form and sound.\n\nLife and death, prosperity and ruin,\nAre the echoes of rush and retreat.\n\nThe Sage, thus, can move in harmony with Heaven,\nAnd rest in unity with the **Dao/Way**,\nPreserving his body while governing the realm,\nSoaring beyond all doing,\nAt ease within the void of affairs,\nDrawing blessing from the subtlest threads,\nAnd spreading it beyond the four seas.\n\nThe Sage embodies the knowing of ignorance,\nThough it seems like sickness, yet he does all things,\nNever missing the slightest hint—\nThus, he blocks the ruin of petty doing,\nAnd fulfills the greatness of non-doing.\nHence, it is said: *Take blessing from the subtlest threads,*\nAnd spread it beyond the four seas.\n\nPlug the eyes of the sighted,\nSeal the mouths of the knowing,\nStop the ears of the hearing,\nSever the hands of the clever—\nFollow the rhythms of time,\nBow and rise with the harmony.\n\nWithout doing, yet all is accomplished;\nWithout teaching, yet the people are governed.\nGrace extends to fleeing beasts,\nKindness reaches flying birds—\nFor he discards hearing and wisdom,\nAbandons doing and trusts the **Dao/Way**.\n\nBecause he treats sickness as sickness,\nThus he does not fall ill.\nIf he did not treat sickness as sickness,\nThen he would not be correct.\n\nThus, following emotion and desire,\nExhausting the depths of heart and intent,\nMoving to guide Heaven and Earth,\nResting to nurture all things,\nDivine spirit within himself,\nUnseen and unburned—\nWithout descending from his seat,\nAll nations prepare themselves.\nEven if he wished not to perish,\nNature itself would not allow it.\n\nIf one turns away from the **Dao/Way** and follows desire,\nThough he hopes to survive, he must fail—\nFor the strong and violent do not meet their end naturally;\nThis is the inevitable order.\n\nHence, it is said: *Nature itself would not allow it.*\n*Allow* means *halt*.\n\nThe people do not fear great authority—\nIf the people do not fear authority, they easily do wrong—\nThen great authority arrives, detached from its form.\n\nDo not cling to what you possess, for it is low and weak;\nDo not exhaust what you are given, for it is constrained and perilous.\n\nOnly those who do not weary of sweetness’s joy\nWill not weary of enduring hardship.\n\nThus, the Sage says to the ruler:\n*\"Know yourself, but do not reveal yourself—*\n*Then you are not called virtuous.*\n*Love yourself, but do not exalt yourself above the people—*\n*Then you take from that and seek this within yourself.\"*\n\n**Key Principle:**\nThe essence of **Dao** and **virtue/power**,\nThe divine affairs of the numinous,\nThe great harmony of the heart,\nThe intent of Heaven and Earth—\nNo calamity is greater than ruin,\nNo blessing is greater than survival.\nThis is not only the **Dao/Way** of Heaven,\nBut also of all things and beings.\n\nThus, the **Dao/Way** of preserving life\nIs nothing more urgent than nurturing the spirit;\nThe essence of nurturing the spirit\nIs nothing greater than simplicity.\n\nAlways embodying reverence and dread,\nTrembling and quaking—\nLosing the spirit’s guardianship\nStems from indulgence;\nLosing the spirit’s measure\nLies in self-assertion.\n\nThus, the highest reverence is for the **Dao/Way**,\nNext for Heaven,\nThen for Earth,\nThen for humanity,\nThen for oneself.\n\nProsperity and decline, fortune and ruin—\nAll arise from oneself.\nDo not fear what is subtle,\nBut you must fear what is manifest.\n\nDo not ponder small faults,\nOr they will become great offenses.\nSuffering great calamity and deep ruin,\nUntil annihilation—\nReverence and dread must begin at the origin,\nAscending to the formless and soaring.\n\nGuard and be cautious before signs appear,\nThen the **Dao/Way** shines greatly.\nIn action, you attain what you desire;\nIn stillness, you attain what is tranquil.\nBlessing and fortune are profound and subtle,\nLost in boundlessness.\n\nGuard and be cautious before signs appear,\nFear what has not yet been heard—\nHence, it is said: *Reverence and dread at the origin*\nLeads to profound blessing and fortune.\n\nStraight speech seems contrary,\nYet it is clear as if in darkness,\nVast and deep, beyond hearing.\n\nWaiting for fate is within yourself—\nWhat need is there of Heaven?\nGreatest blessing turns to calamity,\nGreatest fortune seems like misfortune.\nWhen the world is drunk and sated,\nNone can perceive it.\n\nThus, the common folk see only what is near,\nHear only what is shallow,\nAnd do not recognize the **Dao/Way** of the profound and mysterious.\nThey are blocked by the subtle and constant,\nSealed from the divine logic,\nExamining the profit of a hair’s breadth,\nYet failing to see the ruin of mountains.\nThey indulge emotion and behavior,\nFearless and uninhibited.\n\nSpeech follows what is so,\nAction follows what is good,\nUsing strength to take what is possible,\nThe heart complying with delusion—\nProud, extravagant, arrogant, and contentious,\nSelf-assertive and self-diminishing.\n\nLoyalty and trust are what they love,\nYet they deceive even their parents,\nPlunder Heaven and Earth,\nDisrespect their sovereign,\nPursuing emotion and desire,\nThus defying the **Dao/Way** of Heaven.\n\nHence, they devise clever schemes and false names\nTo replace their true selves,\nBestow favors and spread kindness\nYet invite great ruin,\nFlee blessings beyond Heaven,\nChase calamities across the seas—\nSeeking **virtue/power** and blessing,\nYet cannot obtain them;\nCalamity and disaster pursue,\nWith no escape.\n\nBecause they do not fear great authority,\nGreat authority arrives.\nWhen great authority arrives,\nOnly then do they begin to do good.\n\nAt this point,\n**Dao** and **virtue/power** cannot save,\nHeaven and Earth cannot resolve—\nThis is not Heaven’s fault.\nThey delight in height and excess,\nBear great authority and rely on power,\nLacking dread and reverence,\nSeeking nothing within themselves.\n\nThus, those who dread for their own bodies\nNeed not fear others;\nThose who fear within themselves\nNeed not be controlled by others;\nThose who comply with the small\nNeed not fear the great;\nThose who warn of the near\nNeed not regret the distant.\n\nIf one can self-admonish and self-strengthen,\nBeing cautious each day,\nThen ruin will not come from afar,\nAnd blessing will be near.\n\nThus, one does not despise his station,\nYet resides in it with diligence;\nDoes not slight his position,\nYet enriches his conduct with propriety;\nDoes not weary of lowliness,\nYet transforms his great beginnings;\nDoes not tire of hardship and peril,\nYet severs what leads to it—\nFinding joy in adversity as in success,\nAccepting death as peacefully as longevity.\nEven if he wished to linger,\nHe could not remain long.\n\nNot shunning the bitterness of his station,\nThough low and small, he refines it further,\nThus transforming its great essence—\nIf he finds sweetness in it without wearying,\nThen he will not remain in it long.\n\nHow is this made clear?\nZhuangzi said:\n*The **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth*\n*Begins and yet has an end,*\n*Ends and yet returns to beginning.*\n\nWhen yang-qi rests as the hidden dragon,\nIt can melt metal;\nWhen yin-qi is at ease with frost,\nIt can freeze ice;\nWhen wood thrives in the autumn hair’s breadth,\nIt can grow to a hundred fathoms;\nWhen water delights in the trickling stream,\nIt can become the sea;\nWhen birds take joy in the egg’s warmth,\nThey can soar high;\nWhen beasts prepare in the womb’s embrace,\nThey can run far.",

None can explain.\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven is both yin and yang,\nIt does not contend yet naturally prevails—\nFollowing the forms of things,\nResponding without words to their sounds,\nSummoning none yet all come of their own accord—\nThings reveal themselves naturally.\nIt is plain yet masterfully strategizes—\nThings disclose their own dispositions.\nThe Heavenly net is vast and boundless,\nFine as though nonexistent yet nothing escapes—\nWide yet nothing is lost, retaining what should not be abandoned#7.\n\n**The principle of alignment:**\nThe **Dao/Way** of Heaven and Earth,\nThe logic of life and death,\nHas neither departure nor approach,\nNeither taking nor giving,\nNeither action nor inaction—\nYet all things arise naturally.\nStraight as a plumb line,\nSmooth as water,\nResponding to circumstances and emulating patterns,\nRising with all things in harmony,\nGaining and losing, taking and discarding,\nCompleting tasks from beginning to end,\nDeep or shallow, light or heavy—\nAll things take their own measure,\nDiverse forms and kinds,\nEach returning to its natural state#8.\nLife is the root of death,\nDeath is the origin of life—\nThese two, when contrasted,\nReveal fortune and misfortune.\n\nThus, he who knows life yet not death\nInverts Heaven’s order;\nHe who knows death yet not life\nDefies Earth’s principle.\nHence, joy and anger have their limits,\nLife and death their measures—\nReceiving Heaven’s punishment,\nEnduring Earth’s retribution.\nWhen anger is due yet not expressed,\nHis sons become wolves and his brothers oxen#9;\nWhen battle is called yet not fought,\nHis wives become enemy states and his concubines great bandits#10;\nWhen death is decreed yet not carried out,\nHe invites Heaven’s wrath and is dominated by things;\nWhen joy is owed yet not given,\nHe suffers Heaven’s disaster and meets Earth’s blame;\nWhen life is granted yet not nurtured,\nRulers lose their kingdoms and commoners their lives.\nThus the noble man kills his people as he would his own body,\nGives life to others as he would to himself,\nHolding fast to **virtue/power** and uprightness,\nActing only when necessity compels him.\n\nTo preserve life and ensure the nation’s peace,\nLies in the balance of life and death—\nIf life and death are governed rightly,\nHeaven and Earth will protect him,\nAnd the measure of joy and anger\nWill bring all things to him.\nHence, he is firm yet resolute,\nStrikes deep and with severity,\nRepels evil and nourishes the good,\nDares yet knows restraint.\n\nSkilled in defense and war,\nClear in opening and closing,\nLong in resentment yet swift in retribution,\nAt ease in stillness yet joyful in action,\nBenefiting the nation and the people,\nNot avoiding the strong or mighty,\nHis威令 (威令, awe and authority) shakes the hundred barbarians,\nHis influence sways the borders beyond—\nHe attains half of what is good.\nThis is from daring in courage.\n\nThe meek and weak, fearing and respecting,\nDreading to harm others with words,\nReflecting deeply to grasp far-reaching thoughts,\nConfronting justice yet punishing grudges,\nPursuing longevity and few conflicts,\nAccumulating benevolence through broad and profound deeds.\nHe benefits without harming,\nTo make his goodness known;\nHe gives without taking,\nTo manifest his name;\nHe rewards without punishing,\nTo establish his grace;\nHe grants life without killing,\nTo fulfill his仁 (ren, compassion)—\nHe attains half of what is good.\nThis is from daring not to dare.\n\nIn all these two achievements—\nDaring in courage and daring not to dare—\nTheir strategies diverge yet both strike the mark,\nTheir paths contradict yet both find their purpose—\nOne may turn a thousand chariots into captives,\nAnother may transform an ordinary man into a sovereign.\nThus, things may be nurtured for fortune or for calamity,\nOr slain for fortune or for ruin.\nThese two principles are profound and subtle,\nNone can fully fathom them.\nUnable to grasp them fully,\nThey do not perceive the mysterious and dark’s disposition,\nNor distinguish the divisions of calamity and fortune.\nOnly those who attain the **Dao/Way** comprehend the unseen before it occurs,\nAnd can thus govern its beginnings—\nBeyond the reach of ordinary measures.\nHence it is said that these two principles are profound and subtle,\nNone can fully explore them.\n\nThus, nurturing what Heaven detests,\nHarms what Heaven protects;\nNurturing what Heaven protects,\nHarms what Heaven detests.\nOne reversal, one inversion,\nMay yield **玄德** (Xuanming, mysterious virtue);\nOne inversion, one reversal,\nMay breed **玄贼** (Xuanming, mysterious ruin).\nServe Heaven and Earth as a father,\nAnd your descendants will prosper.\nThus, if you nurture yet the future declines,\nLife was meant to perish;\nIf you slay yet fortune arrives,\nDeath was meant to live;\nIf you slaughter yet blessings follow,\nKilling was meant to bring fortune;\nIf you destroy yet misfortune comes,\nKilling was meant to nurture life.\nWhat Heaven detests, do not dare to preserve;\nWhat Heaven protects, do not dare to slay;\nWhat Heaven diminishes, do not dare to give;\nWhat Heaven benefits, do not dare to take.\nTo give or not to give,\nOnly Heaven decides;\nTo slay or not to slay,\nNo mortal knows.\nThus, daring in courage

      "translated_text": "「How does one understand this? Zhuangzi says: The infant is faithful and trustworthy toward its enemies and rivals when it knows nothing, but when it grows strong and gains knowledge, it deceives even its elder brothers and sisters-in-law.\n\nWhen the three armies are in high spirits, they abandon even captured soldiers; beasts in the narrow valleys do not flee from rhinoceroses or tigers. This is not because their nature has changed—it is simply the way of things.\n\nFrom this, we see: if the people’s hearts are not won, their lives and fates are incomplete, then decrees and commands cannot move them. If they are wretched and distressed, they do not fear death lightly, then punishments and penalties cannot terrify them.\n\nThus, rulers who delight in knowledge, burdened by worldly cares and the people’s labor, sacrifice to heaven and earth, ward off calamities and dispel misfortunes, summon goodness and invite blessings, pray to spirits and deities, and manipulate all affairs—ever shifting to please the people—will find that households know kindness, streets abound with virtuous and wise men.\n\nBut if they defy the natural order, rely solely on human hearts, take their own opinions as wisdom, and their own arguments as just—if they abandon proper distinctions, disregard the principles of things, and obstruct the Dao while fostering false praise—then the world will be thrown into great chaos, the common folk will be restless and anxious, labor will be unending, and poverty will breed deceit.\n\nThose who dare to defy will be honored and rewarded, the lighthearted will thrive in ease, the virtuous will suffer in want, those who fear the law will starve in distress, the weak will grow bitter and long for death, while the powerful will revel in their dominion over the king.\n\nThus, when the world rushes toward fame and contests for influence, without regard for right or wrong, splitting hairs and parsing minutiae, and treats death as a return home—then, if stern laws and harsh punishments are imposed, it is like restraining what is easy and controlling what is light. When it comes to this, people no longer fear death—how can one frighten them with it? Such words are senseless.\n\nHence, executions and punishments multiply, yet deceit does not cease; rewards and stipends are given, yet the great ministers do not obey; the common people do not rally, and the feudal lords do not submit. The land is not truly his, nor is the people’s loyalty. Therefore, the sage-ruler guides the people thus: the sovereign does nothing, yet the people have no grievances; the people gain nothing, yet the sovereign loses nothing.\n\nHis achievements are easily won yet hard to lose; his transformations are difficult to resist yet easy to enact; his garments are easily made yet hard to wear out; his food is easily sufficient yet hard to exhaust. Thus, those who crave life and abhor death, who shun excess and despise ruin, all hold their spirits dear and cherish their bodies, so that form can be controlled and influence can be restrained.\n\nPeople fear death and value life—this is their natural state. Hence, even the bold and the wise, those who are open and far-reaching, do not dare to create blessings or wield authority. Thus, laws are established yet unused, rewards are set yet not bestowed.\n\nWhy is this so? Because the sovereign’s weight is as great as heaven and earth, while all other things are as light as feathers. If laws are stern and punishments severe, the wise know not to transgress. Those who alone do not fear, when their crimes are exposed, will be put to death by the officials—who would dare to defy?\n\nTherefore, the Dao of the Emperor-King is to act without interference, to see without gazing, to hear without listening, to scheme without plotting, and to speak without uttering words. Before, behind, left, and right—each has its appointed duty. He relies on their responses to oversee, ensures their success, grants them their aspirations, and accepts their deeds. Titles are bestowed upon worthy lords, stipends given to advancing virtuous men. Those who create blessings will die, those who usurp authority will see their clans destroyed, and all officials will hasten to their duties—leaving the sovereign uninvolved.\n\nEach has its proper role, none may overstep or substitute. When entrusted with what they are capable of, the Great Dao is achieved, all affairs become clear, and the realm stands still in perfect order, conquering all without effort.\n\nIf ministers act as sovereigns, they will lose their own lives; if sovereigns act as ministers, they will surely harm their states.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* and *Virtue/Power* of the True Classic’s *Annotations* [卷之十二] conclude here:\n\n1. *威* [\"威\"] was originally *\"为\"* [\"for\"], corrected according to the *Secret Edition*.\n2. *\"所\"* [\"that which\"] was originally omitted, added according to the *Secret Edition*.\n3. *\"常处\"* [\"constant abode\"] was originally *\"堂处\"* [\"hall abode\"], corrected according to the *Secret Edition*.\n\nThe sovereign’s Dao lies in the unseen, the minister’s in the seen. The sovereign alone holds absolute authority, the ministers alone establish proper names. When the sovereign and ministers are separated, all affairs become clear.\n\nThe division between ruler and subject must never be blurred. Thus, when the sovereign’s position is fixed and the ministers’ duties are clear, all affairs become manifest. The sovereign has his allotted sphere, the ministers their appointed tasks. To discern their proper roles and duties is to ensure none may substitute for another. Each guards his own circle, the Great Dao is then achieved, all affairs become clear, and the realm stands still in perfect order, conquering all without effort.\n\nIf ministers act as sovereigns, they will lose their own lives; if sovereigns act as ministers, they will surely harm their states.\n\nThe *Dao/Way* and *Virtue/Power* of the True Classic’s *Annotations* conclude here.」",

      "translated_text": "The saying that people lightly risk death is because they crave life excessively. Thus, when they lose wealth or rank, some suffer gut-wrenching sorrow, drive themselves mad, hang themselves, waste their vital essence, abandon their spirit—constantly yearning for death, seizing blades to harm themselves, or plunging into deep waters. Hence, they hold death lightly.\n\nThus, the Way of Nature ever opposes things. The formless lives, the formed dies; those who pursue gain encounter calamity, those who seek fortune meet disaster. They come unsummoned, meet without invitation—I though I would avoid them, yet the world cannot escape. Therefore, the relentless pursuit of life and gain is the root of death, while abandoning form and rejecting gain is the root of life.\n\nThe nameless and lowly suffer no misfortune;\nthe humble and disgraced incur no blame;\ncoarse food and simple broth breed lasting contentment;\nrough cloth and deer-hide garments bring enduring comfort;\nwhen one does not burden the people, peace and ease endure;\nwhen one does not cling to life, longevity follows.\nThis is the way to transcend life.\n\nThus, one who can abandon all selfish divisions, stripping away all desires, lies motionless like a corpse, stands unchanging like a wooden post—neither altered by transformation, nor distinguished by life and death, neither exalted as a sovereign, nor debased as a slave. Only in what one encounters, yielding to the unfolding of Nature, does one neither fear annihilation nor rejoice in life. Then one aligns with the Dao as a person, befriends Heaven and Earth, attains longevity and clear vision, cycles endlessly, and transcends all bounds of wealth and nobility—becoming the marketplace of the world. This surpasses the mere valuing of life.\n\n**On the Nature of Life and Death**\nHuman life is soft and weak, for spirit resides in the body; death is rigid and strong, for spirit departs the body.\nGrass and trees in life are soft and pliable, for yang-qi abides within; in death, they wither and decay, for yang-qi withdraws.\n\nThus, rigidity and strength are the form of death’s followers,\nwhile softness and weakness are the bearing of life’s survivors.\nA strong army cannot overcome its fourfold reversals;\na rigid tree cannot thrive among its kin.\nStrength and grandeur bring ruin—this is the exhaustion of the Way;\nsmallness and weakness bring harmony—this is attaining the mean.\n\n**The Pivot of Return:**\nWith all things it arises together, yet has no form or sound;\nit lacks color or taste, nor does it reek or perfume.\nIt enters and exits without doors, comes and goes without gates—\nabove, it has no stalk; below, no root.\nSerene and still, it never alters, preserving its constancy.\nHarmonious and subtle, its transformations know no bounds.\nIt blends with all things, yet gives birth to the Three—\nthe origin of Heaven and Earth, the ancestral source of yin and yang.\nWhen things exist, it abides; when things perish, it departs.\nUnnameable, it is called *Shenming* [Divine Clarity].\n\nBorn of the Great Void, it thrives in the formless,\nreceiving without decay, bestowing without depletion.\nIn motion, it knows no end; in stillness, it is boundless.\nIt encompasses all without limit, penetrates all without exclusion—\nflowing beyond all things, traversing all that exists.\nHeaven gallops, Earth races, yet cannot overtake it;\nyin strains, yang flees, yet cannot outstrip it.\nEchoes exhaust themselves yet cannot respond;\nshadows dissolve yet cannot resemble it.\nTake from it, yet it is never spent;\ngive to it, yet it is never depleted.\nIt has no partiality in giving or taking,\nno hatred or love—\nit retains softness, dwells in weakness,\nreturning to emptiness.\nAdvancing and retreating, bending and stretching,\nit ever aligns with *virtue/power*,\nleading the Dao, while things grow distant.\nThose who receive much are sage and wise;\nthose who receive little are foolish and dull.\n\nThus, the Divine Clarity and sage wisdom are the eternal masters of life;\nsoftness, weakness, and stillness are the dwelling of Divine Clarity.\nWhen spirit resides in the body, life is soft and weak—\nthis is the abode of Divine Clarity.\n\nWhen Divine Clarity dwells in a person,\nit cannot be removed if in its right place,\nnor can it be retained if lost.\nNeither coercive power nor clever schemes can control it.\nIf one can nurture it, wealth and nobility never fade,\nand one remains forever in high station, growing ever more secure.\n\nThus, at birth, bones are weak, sinews supple,\nblood and qi flow freely,\nthe mind is focused, spirit harmonious,\nthe face radiant, the body luminous,\nmovements graceful, every joint firm—\nday by day, vitality increases, and within months, clarity sharpens.\nWhy? Because spirit resides within.\n\nBut as one ages, bones wither, sinews tighten,\nhair turns white, flesh atrophies,\nfood and drink lose flavor,\nhearing and sight dull,\nstrength and vigor wane daily,\nmovements decline monthly,\nthought grows muddled, choices conflict.\nAt death, the body shrinks, the face hollows, the tongue retreats, the limbs stretch.\nWhy? Because spirit has departed.\nThis is the rigidity of death.\n\nWhen grass and trees first sprout, branches are supple, leaves lush and green,\nabundant and beautiful, soft and harmonious—\nfor yang-qi abides within.\nAs they decline, leaves yellow and wither, colors fade and perish.\nAt death, roots and stems wither, branches grow rigid and hard—\nfor yang-qi has departed.\nThus, grass and trees in life are soft and pliable, in death, withered and brittle.\n\nWhere Divine Clarity resides, the perilous may be secured, the dead revived;\nwhere it departs, the safe may perish, the strong may be slain.\nWhere yang-qi abides, trees may bend and grass may bind;\nwhere it flees, breath may congeal and ice may shatter.\n\nThus, Divine Clarity and yang-qi are the root of life,\nwhile softness and weakness are the medicine for all things.\nHarmony and yielding are the means of longevity,\nthe refuge of Divine Clarity and yang-qi.\n\nAll things follow yang in their yielding softness—\nthus, rigidity and fullness are the likeness of death;\nsoftness and smoothness are the dwelling of life.\nThe rigid and strong are death’s followers;\nthe soft and weak are life’s survivors.\n\nIn human nature, one hates a neighbor’s father for his strength,\nloves a neighbor’s child for his weakness;\nburns withered branches for their hardness,\nadorns with jade and ornaments for their smoothness.\nPeople love the young and hate the old—\nfor life’s vitality lies in their measure.",

in virtue of compassion and love.\nThey punish the arrogant and violent, rescue the insufficient,\nand break the greedy and the usurping.\n\nThe generals rely on the might of their state and the multitude of their people,\nseeking glory and fame, mimicking the ways of others,\nthus they covet others’ lands and wealth,\ntake joy in slaughter and injury,\nravage ancestral temples and shrines,\nand bring ruin to the people—\nall to display their overwhelming power.\n\nSubmissive and fearful below, they exploit others’ advantages to assert their own will,\nthose who draw near meet

benefit the world.\nThe many, though weak, unite as one,\nsharing sorrow and plotting together—\nthough they bear the name of strength,\nin truth, they cannot prevail.\n\nThis is what is meant by *\"strong armies do not conquer.\"*\nWhy is this so?\nFor they are bound by poisonous knots—\nHeaven’s Dao does not favor them.\n\nHow can this be made clear?\nIn ancient times, mighty Qin and Chu\nannihilated the feudal lords,\nunited the domains and cities,\ngrew rich in their states,\nand became sovereigns, their power swaying the world,\ntheir might trembling across the seas,\ntheir honors and privileges reaching their peak—\nthey could be called strong indeed.\n\nYet, when they sat at ease, the feudal lords were in distress;\nwhen they stretched their feet, the world trembled in fear;\nwhen they issued commands, Heaven’s heart grieved;\nwhen they took action, the Divine Clarity was disturbed—\ntheir nations fell, their families were ruined,\nand their own lives were cut short.\n\nWhy was this so?\nBecause they abandoned softness and weakness for rigidity and strength.\n\nWhen the divine Han was about to rise,\nthey fled like dragons into hiding,\nyet the people sought them out—\nand they could not escape.\n\nFather Heaven, Mother Earth,\nloving the people as their own children,\nrewarding merit and nurturing virtue,\nteaching those who follow the Dao,\nresponding to enemies and adapting to change,\ntheir strategies vast as rivers and seas—\nthey conquered Qin and extinguished Chu,\nthe world rejoiced in harmony,\nand they were established as sovereigns.\n\nWhy was this so?\nBecause they acted with compassion and humility,\nin accordance with Heaven’s will.\n\nThis is not only true of human affairs—\nit applies to all things.\n\nGreat trees, towering a hundred *rèn* high,\nwith massive trunks and branches,\ntheir heads split through the central gate,\ntheir roots divided by the doorframe—\nthough they bear no fruit,\nthey endure at the lowest level.\n\nYet countless smaller trees,\nstretching their limbs and leaves,\nlush and verdant,\nthrive above them—\nfor their forms are great yet their strength is weak.\nThis is what is meant by *\"strong trees are shared.\"*\n\nThus, the Dao of Divine Clarity,\nthe principle of Heaven and Earth,\ndoes not uphold the small to bear the great,\nnor the light to bear the heavy.\n\nHence, the strong cannot rule as kings,\nnor can the mighty trees dwell above.\nThe strong and mighty reside below;\nthe weak and small dwell above—\nthis is the natural order of things.\nWhen the weak and small dwell above,\nit is the fixed law of Heaven.\n\nThe **Chapter of Heaven’s Dao**:\nHeaven’s Dao is both yin and yang,\nlike a drawn bow with its tension and release.\nThe high are lowered to grow long and strong,\nthe low are raised to begin their life.\nThose with excess are diminished to break fullness,\nthose lacking are supplemented to fill emptiness.\nHeaven’s Dao:\nto diminish excess and balance is constant,\nto supplement deficiency and provide support is to court ruin.\n\nHuman affairs are not so—\nthey cannot be thus practiced.\nThey diminish the deficient, plunder the weak,\nand hoard the excess for the mighty.\nWho can diminish the excess with clear insight,\nand bestow the world’s blessings to all,\nthus ensuring life and harmony together?\nOnly the one who follows the Dao is nameless.\n\nThus, the Sage says of the enlightened king:\n*\"He acts but does not rely on force,\nhe achieves success but does not dwell upon it,\nhe does not seek fame nor fear great calamity.\nHe points the way—*\n\nBefore Heaven and Earth began,\nyin and yang had not yet emerged,\ncold and heat had not yet appeared,\nlight and darkness had not yet formed—\nthere stood a primordial entity,\none turbid, one pure,\nthe pure above, the turbid below,\nharmony in the center.\nWhen these three arose together,\nHeaven and Earth were complete,\nyin and yang intermingled,\nand all things were born.\n\nThose who lose it perish,\nthose who grasp it flourish.\nIn things, harmony is:\nrigid yet never broken,\nsoft yet never obstructed.\nIn Heaven, it is the measure;\non Earth, it is the standard.\nIn yang, it is the compass;\nin yin, it is the square.\nIt does not move without restraint,\nnor does it rest without purpose.\nThings rely on softness and weakness,\nwhile qi depends on firmness and strength—\nin motion, it controls all,\nin stillness, it accommodates all.\n\nThus, harmony is:\nthe application of virtue and power,\nthe support of Divine Clarity,\nthe mechanism of Heaven and Earth,\nthe dwelling of all living things,\nthe essential principle of the ten thousand directions,\nthe repository of nature,\nthe gateway of all blessings,\nthe door to universal fortune.\n\nHence, the wise see it as wisdom,\nthe virtuous see it as virtue—\nthe world clings to it day and night,\nyet none can fully comprehend it.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause its power in nurturing things is subtle,\nand its achievement of affairs is profound.\n\nThus, Heaven and Earth’s Dao:\ndoes no harm nor injury,\nits action is non-action—\nit guards with great harmony and rectitude,\nadapting to things with depth and sincerity,\nupholding nothing in vain,\nclaiming nothing for itself—\neach thing fulfills its

All things are skilled in their own ways, yet none can rival it.\n\nThus, water extinguishes fire,\ngrinds and sharpens metal,\nshatters horns and teeth,\nyet harms no tongue or ear.\nIt humbles itself to conquer the proud and violent,\nendures insult to triumph over great grudges—\nall know this, all hear of it,\nyet none act accordingly, for they follow their private desires without end.\n\nWater’s mastery over strength,\nsoftness over hardness—\nall know it, yet none can practice it.\n\nThus, speaking brings ruin,\nsilence brings harm,\nadvancing invites calamity,\nretreating invites blame.\nLabor without virtue,\ntoil without reward—\nbrightness fades into obscurity,\nlong endurance sinks into darkness,\ngreatness turns to smallness,\npreservation leads to ruin.\n\nTherefore, enlightened kings and sage rulers, when inheriting a state,\nmust make solemn vows:\nto bear the nation’s filth,\nto be its sovereign;\nto endure the nation’s misfortunes,\nto be its king of all.\n\nThis is what the sage said.\nWhat is meant by bearing the nation’s filth?\nIt means:\nto eat what the people spit out,\nto wear what the people discard,\nto dwell where the people are sent,\nto find joy in the people’s suffering,\nto strive only in serving the people,\nnever pausing to attend to oneself.\n\nThus, the people entrust them as a father,\nlove them as a mother,\nwilling to be their servants,\nto die with them together.\nTherefore, even in barren lands of cold and stone,\nremote and desolate regions,\nthey turn humiliation into honor,\npreserve their ancestral line,\ntransform calamity into blessing,\nand endure as the people’s lord.\nThis is called bearing the nation’s filth,\nand thus they become the sovereign of the state.\n\nWhat is meant by enduring the nation’s misfortunes?\nIt means:\nto endure what the people despise,\nto bear what the people hate,\nto face the people’s greatest calamities,\nyet not consider it virtue,\nto plan for the nation’s ruin,\nyet not lose Heaven’s favor,\nto consider death,\nyet not lose the people’s blessing—\nHeaven and Earth bow with them,\nall creatures rise and fall with them,\nthey follow east and west,\nattach to south and north.\nWhere they act, ruin follows;\nwhere they scheme, submission comes.\nThe world unites as one domain,\nall turn toward the wind and embrace transformation,\nnone fail to receive its blessings.\n\nThus, they can rectify the crooked and pacify chaos,\nconquer without resistance,\ntransform decadence into simplicity,\nachieve great virtue and boundless renown.\nThis is called enduring the nation’s misfortunes,\nand thus they become the king of all.\n\nWhy is this so?\nBecause their hearts are soft, their wills weak,\nthey value others above themselves,\nand find ease in humiliation.\n\nThus, upright speech seems contrary,\nyet none can overturn it;\nnear yet seems distant,\nyet none can fathom it;\nseeking it from afar,\nyet none can attain it—\nall lies within oneself.\n\nHow so?\nLuxury lies within oneself,\nyet they appear frugal to others;\nwickedness lies within themselves,\nyet they seek righteousness from the people;\ndisaster is invited by themselves,\nyet they pray for blessings to Heaven—\nHeaven and the spirits show them,\nyet they cannot see;\nthe spirits warn them,\nyet they cannot hear.\n\nAbandoning this, they turn to harmony of heart,\ntheir actions here resonate with Heaven,\nrejecting themselves while blaming others—\nthe world falls into great confusion.\n\nThey rely on clear laws,\nexecute punishments with sincerity,\ntheir words and deeds are trustworthy,\nrewards and punishments are just,\npublic and impartial—\nyet they exceed Heaven’s intent,\nuprightness without deceit—\nyet they lose the people’s hearts.\nWhen punishments and executions are used together,\nevil only grows;\nwhen rewards are deep and gifts heavy,\nchaos only increases.\n\nAt such times,\nthe virtuous are ensnared,\nthe wise fall under law—\nthough they gain reputation and substance,\nhow can it be good?\n\nThis is called pacifying great grudges,\nyet leaving lingering resentment—\nhow can it be called good?\n\nThus, the sage holds the Dao’s token,\ngrasps virtue’s sincerity,\nand unites it within themselves,\nnever demanding it of others.\n\nTherefore, a ruler of virtue,\nwhen they wish to act,\nmust consult Heaven first;\nwhen they wish to proceed,\nmust verify the token’s truth.\nThey seek faults within themselves,\nnever blame the people;\nthey accept calamity upon themselves,\nnever resent others.\nThus, the sage holds the left contract\nand does not demand accountability from others.\n\nTherefore, right and wrong are self-determined,\nblack and white are self-divided—\nbefore they act, the world responds;\nbefore they command, all things comply.\nVirtue governs the contract.\n\nThe unvirtuous,\npursuing their own desires,\nignoring the people’s needs,\nlose governance and invite chaos,\nseek no reflection in themselves,\nyet blame the people’s failures,\nenforce harsh punishments—\nwhen people have faults,\nfamilies bear guilt,\nthe populace seethes with resentment,\nHeaven’s will is unfulfilled,\ntheir nation falls into disorder,\nand future generations suffer.\nThe unvirtuous govern the traces.\n\nThus, the Dao of Heaven and Earth\nmoves with all things,\nneither favoring nor rejecting,\nneither distant nor close—\nresponding in kind, like echo to sound,\nstillness and motion in harmony, like shadow to form,\nneither crooked nor flattering,\nupright as constant—\nevil meets negation,\ngoodness meets passage,\nsoftness and weakness find accord,\nnon-action aligns with harmony.\n\nHeaven’s Dao has no favorites,\nyet it always sides with the virtuous—\ntruth is never empty.\n\n**Chapter on Small States and Few People**\nSmall states, few people—\nnarrow and few in number.\n\nLet people have ten or a hundred measures of grain,\nwealth and treasures unused—\nlet them practice frugality.\nLet them value death,\nfind fulfillment in their place—\nlet them not wander far,\nfind contentment in their homeland.\n\nThough they have carriages and boats,\ntheir wealth
