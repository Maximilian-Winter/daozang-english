  "full_translation": "**\"The Dao De Jing: The Tang-Era Easy State Dragon Thriving Temple Dao De Jing Stele Edition**\n\nQian Da-xin remarked: *\"Examining the He Shang Gong annotated edition, the section beginning with ‘The Dao that can be spoken’ constitutes the Dao Jing (Upper Scroll), while the section beginning with ‘The highest virtue is non-action’ forms the De Jing (Lower Scroll).\"*\n\nZhao Shuo, in his postscript to Wang Bi’s commentary, stated that Wang did not separate *Dao* and *De* into upper and lower scrolls, thus preserving a form closer to the ancient text. Yet, Lu De-ming’s *Shuowen Jiezi* explicitly follows the Fu Si edition, titling it *Dao Jing (Upper Scroll)* and *De Jing (Lower Scroll)*, identical to the He Shang Gong edition. Zhao’s claim that his version was closer to antiquity was likely based on a Song-dynasty transcription, without further verification.\n\nIn my private collection, there are five stone-carved editions of the *Dao De Jing*, among which only the Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s annotated edition and this one divide the text into *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*—a structure consistent with Han and Wei-era chapter divisions. This edition, carved in early Tang, differs significantly in phrasing from other versions. For instance:\n- *\"Wu\"* (無) is rendered as *\"Wu\"* (無),\n- *\"Yu\"* (愈) as *\"Yu\"* (俞),\n- *\"Yun\"* (芸) as *\"Yun\"* (云),\n- *\"Yu\"* (誉) as *\"Yu\"* (豫),\n- *\"Huang\"* (荒) as *\"Mang\"* (忙),\n- *\"Zuo\"* (佐) as *\"Zuo\"* (作),\n- *\"■\"* (an obscure character) as *\"Xi\"* (翕).\n\nFurther, where the text reads *\"Thus, it can conceal without renewal, achieving completion,\"* the stele version states: *\"Thus, it can conceal and return to completion.\"* Beneath *\"Where the Master resides, brambles and thorns grow,\"* the stele omits the lines *\"After a great army passes, there will surely be years of calamity.\"* Below *\"The High General takes the right,\"* the stele lacks the phrase *\"Speak to them with funeral rites.\"* In the passage *\"Only when one is sick of sickness does one not fall ill; the Sage does not fall ill because he is sick of sickness,\"* the stele simplifies it to: *\"Thus, the Sage does not fall ill because he is sick of sickness.\"*\n\nSuch variations far surpass other editions, and I cite only a few examples to illustrate the value of ancient stone inscriptions.\n\nWu Yi remarked that dividing the *Laozi* into *Dao Jing (Upper Scroll)* and *De Jing (Lower Scroll)* aligns with ancient editions.\n\nLater, Lu You’s postscript noted: *\"Zhao claimed that Wang Fu-si’s *Laozi* did not separate *Dao* and *De* into upper and lower scrolls, saying it was closer to antiquity. Yet this edition has long been divided.\"* Thus, the Song dynasty had already lost Fu Si’s definitive text. Proof lies in Jing Yi’s *Lunyu Cun* citation of the *Laozi De Jing*: *\"The heavenly net is vast, yet nothing escapes.\"*\n\nYet further examination of *Han Shu* annotations reveals:\n- In the *Wei Bo* transmission, Yan Shigu cites the *Laozi Dao Jing*: *\"When a state is in chaos, loyal ministers arise.\"*\n- In the *Tian Heng* transmission, he cites the *Laozi De Jing*: *\"The noble relies on the lowly as foundation; the exalted relies on the humble as base—thus, lords and kings call themselves ‘orphaned, widowed, and unworthy.’\"*\n- In the *Chu Yuanwang* transmission, he cites the *Laozi De Jing*: *\"Knowing contentment brings no disgrace.\"*\n- In the *Yan Zhu* transmission, he notes: *\"This is what the *Laozi* says: ‘Where the Master resides, brambles and thorns grow.’\"* Yan Shigu comments: *\"This is from the *Dao Jing* of the *Laozi*.\"*\n- In the *Yang Xiong* transmission, citing *\"Few know me, yet I am noble,\"* Yan Shigu states: *\"The *Laozi De Jing* says: ‘Few know me, yet I am noble.’\"*\n- In the *Cruel Officials* transmission, the *Laozi* states: *\"The highest virtue acts without virtue, thus it has virtue; the lowest virtue clings to virtue, thus it lacks virtue. When laws proliferate, thieves multiply.\"* Yan Shigu remarks: *\"This is from the *De Jing* of the *Laozi*.\"*\n- For *\"The petty scholar hears the Dao and laughs,\"* he notes: *\"This is from the *Dao Jing* of the *Laozi*.\"*\n\nIn the *Western Regions* transmission’s annotation, it cites the *Laozi De Jing*: *\"When the world follows the Dao, horses are led backward to manure.\"* Clearly, the sources that distinguish *Dao* and *De* in their citations align with the *Shuowen Jiezi*’s *\"Dao Jing Audio and Meaning\"* and *\"De Jing Audio and Meaning.\"*\n\nAdditionally, Jia Gongyan’s *Zhou Li Shi Shi* commentary asserts: *\"The *Laozi Dao Jing* states: ‘The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.’\"* Below, he notes: *\"The *De Jing* states: ‘The highest virtue acts without virtue, thus it has virtue.’\"*\n\nZhang Huai’s *Hou Han Shu* annotation, in the *Zhi □* transmission, claims: *\"The *Laozi Dao Jing* says: ‘Fish cannot escape the spring.’\"*\n\nThese scholars, in early Tang, uniformly attested to this division. (The *Dream True Guest Stele* also states: *\"Examining the *Dao Jing*, compassion is the treasure.\"*) Such divisions must have originated from Jin and Song-era editions, as evidenced by this stele’s titles, which are well-founded.\n\nWang Kang remarked: *\"The upper scroll is titled *Laozi Dao Jing*, and the lower *Laozi De Jing*, clearly distinguishing *Dao* and *De* without merging them. Thus, Xuanzong’s annotations truly follow this ancient structure.\"*\n\nDong Jiong’s *Collected Books Record* incorrectly states: *\"After Xuanzong’s annotations were completed, the text was standardized as the *Dao De Jing*, grouping all references to *Dao* in the upper scroll and *De* in the lower.\"* This is incorrect.\n\nWu Yun noted: *\"The *Sui Shu Jing Ji Zhi* records the *Dao De Jing* in two volumes with Wang Bi’s commentary. Zhao Shuo and Xiong Ke-zhong’s postscripts both claim it was not divided into *Dao De Jing*, yet the current *Shuowen Jiezi* edition is split into two scrolls, leading some to suspect later carvers inserted divisions. However, Jing Yi’s *Lunyu Cun* cites the *Laozi De Jing*: ‘The heavenly net is vast, yet nothing escapes,’ and Yan Shigu’s *Han Shu* annotations frequently cite the *Laozi Dao Jing* and *De Jing* separately. Thus, the division predates Lu De-ming. This stele’s *De Jing* division is well-justified.\"*\n\nSun Yi-ran stated: *\"The *Laozi* consists of eighty-one chapters divided into upper and lower scrolls, titled *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*. The He Shang Gong edition, the *Shuowen Jiezi*’s recorded Wang Bi edition, the Daoist Canon’s Tang Fu Yi annotated edition, and the stone-carved Tang Xuanzong annotated edition all follow this structure.\"*\n\nThe *Hongming Ji* in its *Mouzi Lihuo Lun* states: *\"The reasoning is correct in its thirty-seven articles, and it also follows the Daoist teachings of Laozi’s thirty-seven chapters of the *Dao Jing*.\"* Thus, during the Han dynasty, this book was already divided into the *Dao Jing* (thirty-seven chapters) and *De Jing* (forty-four chapters), matching the structure of the current edition.\n\nThe extant *Wang Bi* annotations, however, derive from the Song dynasty edition as collated by Chao Shao, which does not split the text into *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*. Though this may be logically coherent, it does not reflect the original Han or Tang editions.\n\n**Laozi Dao Jing**\n**Chapter 1**\nThe Dao that can be spoken of is not the eternal Dao;\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\nNon-naming is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nNaming is the mother of myriad things.\nEver non-being, one seeks to observe its mystery;\nEver being, one seeks to observe its peril.\nThese two emerge together yet bear different names—\nBoth are called the *Xuan* (profound).\nThe *Xuan* that is yet again *Xuan*—\nThis is the gate of all mysteries.\n\n**Chapter 2**\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, ugliness already exists;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, evil already exists.\nThus being and non-being give rise to each other,\nDifficulty and ease complete each other,\nLong and short define each other,\nHigh and low incline toward each other,\nSound and voice harmonize with each other,\nFront and back follow each other.\nTherefore, the Sage acts in non-action,\nTeaches without speech.\nMyriad things thereby arise and do not resist,\nAre born and not possessed,\nAre achieved and not claimed,\nSucceed and not dwelled upon.\nIt is only because he does not dwell upon them\nThat they do not depart from him.\n\n**Chapter 3**\nDo not exalt the virtuous,\nThus the people do not contend;\n\n「Do not prize hard-to-obtain goods,\nThus the people do not steal;\nDo not display what is desirable,\nThus the heart does not become disordered.\n\nThe Sage governs by:\nEmptying their heart,\nFilling their belly,\nWeakening their will,\nStrengthening their bones.\nEver keep the people in ignorance and free from desire,\nMake the wise dare not act,\nThen there will be nothing left to govern.\n\n**Chapter 4**\nThe Dao is boundless,\nYet its use endures without exhaustion.\nHow profound!\nAll things take it as their origin.\nIt blunts the sharp,\nUnravels the tangled,\nMellows the glaring,\nAligns with the dusty.\nDeeply abiding, ever present—\nI do not know whose child it is.\nIt precedes the Sovereign of the Yellow Court.\n\n**Chapter 5**\nHeaven and Earth are not kind;\nThey treat all things as straw dogs.\nThe Sage is not kind;\nThey too treat the people as straw dogs.\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIt is like a bellows.\nEmpty yet never exhausted,\nPushed yet never rigid.\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to guard the center.\n\n**Chapter 6**\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female—\nThe root of Heaven and Earth.\nEndlessly, as if present,\nUsed yet never exhausted.\n\n**Chapter 7**\nHeaven is long, Earth is enduring.\nHeaven and Earth endure long because\nThey do not seek to live for themselves,\nThus they endure long.\nTherefore the Sage puts themselves last,\nYet they are first;\nThey abandon themselves,\nYet they are preserved.\nBecause they have no selfishness,\nThey achieve their own ends.\n\n**Chapter 8**\nThe highest virtue resembles water.\nWater benefits all things yet does not contend.\nIt dwells where others disdain to be,\nThus it approaches the Dao.\nResiding in good ground,\nHeart deep and still,\nAssociating with good people,\nSpeaking with trustworthiness,\nGoverning with skill,\nActing with competence,\nMoving with timing—\nBecause it does not contend,\nIt incurs no blame.\n\n**Chapter 9**\nTo grasp and fill is not as good as stopping in time.\nTo shape and sharpen is not as good as knowing when to cease.\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can keep them.\nRich and noble yet arrogant,\nThey bring ruin upon themselves.\nWhen achievement is complete and fame is secured,\nWithdraw—this is the Dao of Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 10**\nNurturing the vital essence, embracing unity,\nCan one avoid separation?\nFocusing the qi, attaining softness,\nCan one return to infancy?\nPurifying and clarifying, gazing into the profound,\nCan one avoid flaws?\nLoving the people, governing the state,\nCan one act without doing?\nOpening and closing the Heavenly Gate,\nCan one become the receptive?\nIlluminated and far-reaching,\nCan one avoid knowing?\nNourishing yet not possessing,\nCreating yet not relying,\nGrowing yet not dominating—\nThis is called the Mysterious Virtue.\n\n**Chapter 11**\nThirty spokes converge at one hub,\nYet it is the empty space that makes the wheel useful.\nClay is shaped into vessels,\nYet it is the empty space that makes them useful.\nDoors and windows are carved for rooms,\nYet it is the empty space that makes them useful.\nWhat exists is useful,\nWhat does not exist is also useful.\n\n**Chapter 12**\nThe five colors blind the eye;»\n\nThe five tones make the ears deaf;\nThe five flavors make the palate insipid;\nGalloping and hunting in the wilds make the heart frenzied;\nRare and coveted goods make conduct erratic.\nTherefore, the Sage acts for the belly, not for the eyes.\nThus, he discards that and embraces this.\n\n**Chapter 13**\nHonor and disgrace—both cause alarm;\nTreating great calamity as one’s own body—what does this mean?\nWhat is meant by *honor and disgrace causing alarm*?\nDisgrace is lowly—\nTo gain it is alarming,\nTo lose it is alarming—\nThis is called *honor and disgrace causing alarm*.\nWhat is meant by *treating great calamity as one’s own body*?\nIt is because of my body that I have great calamity.\nWhen I have no body, what calamity can I have?\nThus, to cherish the body above all under Heaven,\nIs to be entrusted with all under Heaven;\nTo love ruling all under Heaven as one’s own body,\nIs to be entrusted with all under Heaven.\n\n**Chapter 14**\nIt cannot be seen—called *level* (Qi);\nIt cannot be heard—called *rare* (Xi);\nIt cannot be grasped—called *subtle* (Wei).\nThese three cannot be pursued or examined,\nThus they merge into one.\nAbove, it is not bright;\nBelow, it is not dark.\nBoundless, it cannot be named—\nReturning to nothingness.\nThis is called the *form of formlessness*,\nThe *image of imagelessness*—\nThis is called *dim and vague*.\nApproach it, you see no head;\nFollow it, you see no tail.\nHolding the ancient Way,\nTo speak of those who now have it—\nTo know the ancient beginning,\nThis is called *the Way already*.\n\n**Chapter 15**\nThe ancients who were skilled as *scholars* (shi)\nWere subtle, mysterious, and profound—\nSo profound they could not be fathomed.\nBecause they could not be fathomed,\nThey forced themselves to appear thus:\nCautious as one crossing a winter river,\nFearful as one wary of neighbors,\nSolemn as a guest,\nDissolving like ice about to melt,\nSolid as uncarved wood,\nMuddled as muddy water,\nVast as a valley.\nHow can muddy water be made clear?\nGradually, it settles.\nHow can stillness be made to move?\nGradually, it stirs.\nHow can life be nurtured?\nGradually, it grows.\nThose who preserve this Way\nDo not seek fullness.\nBecause they do not seek fullness,\nThey can be depleted and yet renew.\n\n**Chapter 16**\nPush emptiness to its utmost,\nGuard stillness with steadfastness.\nAll things arise together—\nI observe their return.\nThings drift and drift,\nEach returning to its root.\nReturning to the root is called *stillness*;\nStillness is called *returning to life*;\nReturning to life is called *constancy*;\nKnowing constancy is called *clarity*.\nNot knowing constancy,\nOne forgets to act—disaster.\nKnowing constancy, one is tolerant;\nTolerance makes one fair;\nFairness makes one sovereign;\nSovereignty makes one heavenly;\nHeavenliness aligns with the Dao;\nThe Dao endures eternally—\nOne’s life ends without peril.\n\n**Chapter 17**\nThe Supreme Sage\nMakes the lowly aware of his existence;\n\n**Chapter 18**\nNext, they are cherished and indulged;\nNext, they are feared and scorned.\nIf trust is insufficient, there will be distrust!\nBecause of their reverence for words,\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs succeed,\nThe people say, *\"It happened naturally.\"*\n\n**Chapter 19**\nWhen the Great Dao declines,\nThere arises righteousness.\nWhen wisdom and cunning emerge,\nThere arises great deceit.\nWhen family bonds fracture,\nThere arises filial piety.\nWhen the state is chaotic,\nThere arise loyal ministers.\n\n**Chapter 20**\nAbandon learning, and there will be no worries.\n*\"Yes\" and \"No\"*—how far apart are they?\nGood and evil—how far apart are they?\nWhat people fear, one must not fail to fear.\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nAs if feasting on the finest sacrificial meat,\nAs if ascending the spring platform.\nMy essence is yet unmanifest,\nLike an infant not yet weaned.\nDrifting, drifting, with nowhere to rest!\nThe multitude all have excess,\nWhile I alone seem abandoned.\nWith my simple heart,\nPure and unadorned—\nThe common folk are bright and clear,\nWhile I alone seem dim.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nWhile I alone am muddled and obscure.\nMy stillness is like the sea,\nFloating without end.\nThe multitude all have purpose,\nWhile I alone seem crude and vulgar.\nI alone differ from others,\nYet I alone honor the Mother of the Way.\n\n**Chapter 21**\nThe sage holds this vessel with ease,\nFollowing only the Dao.\nThe Dao as a thing—\nOnly vague, only elusive.\nWithin vague and elusive, there is form;\nWithin form, there is substance.\nWithin profound obscurity, there is essence;\nIts essence is most profound,\nAnd within it, there is truth.\nFrom ancient times to now,\nIts name has never faded,\nTo observe all things.\nHow do I know all things are thus?\nBy this.\n\n**Chapter 22**\n\n**Chapter 23**\nWhen bent, it remains whole;\nWhen crooked, it stands straight;\nWhen hollowed, it fills;\nWhen worn, it renews;\nWhen few, it gains;\nWhen many, it falters.\nThus the sage, embracing Oneness,\nSets the pattern for all under Heaven.\nNot self-illuminating, yet clear;\nNot self-righteous, yet manifest;\nNot self-praising, yet achieves;\nNot self-glorifying, yet endures.\nOnly by not contending\nDoes one surpass all contention.\nWas it not said of old:\n*\"When bent, it remains whole\"*—\nWas this mere empty speech?\nThus completion returns to its source.\n\n**Chapter 24**\nSpeak little, act naturally.\nA sudden gust does not last the morning,\nA sudden rain does not last the day.\nWhy so?\nHeaven and Earth.\nHeaven and Earth cannot endure above,\nHow much less so mortals?\nThus those who act in accord with the Dao\nAre nurtured by virtue;\nThose in harmony with virtue\nAre further nurtured by virtue;\nThose in discord with virtue\nAre abandoned by the Dao.\nWhen trust is insufficient,\nThe untrustworthy arise.\n\n**Chapter 25**\nThe striving do not endure;\nThe overreaching cannot proceed.\nSelf-illumination brings no clarity;\nSelf-righteousness brings no renown;\nSelf-praise yields no merit;\nSelf-glorification brings no longevity.\nIn the Way, it is called *\"excess food, superfluous movement\"*—\nSome may detest it,\nThus those who embody the Dao\nFind no place to dwell.\n\n**Chapter 26**\nThere is a thing, indistinctly formed,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nSilent and void!\nStanding alone, unchanging,\nCirculating without weariness,\nIt may be called the Mother of all under Heaven.\nI do not know its name—\nI forcefully call it the *Dao*,\nForcefully name it *Great*.\nGreat means passing;\nPassing means distant;\nDistant means returning.\nThe Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nThe Sovereign is great.\nWithin the four greats, the Sovereign holds one.\nHumans follow Earth,\nEarth follows Heaven,\nHeaven follows the Dao,\nThe Dao follows *Naturalness*.\n\n**Chapter 27**\nHeavy is the root of light,\nStillness is the master of movement.\nThus the noble one, though journeying all day,\nNever strays from his provisions.\nThough adorned with splendor,\nHe dwells in serene detachment.\nHow then can the ruler of ten thousand chariots\nLighten himself over the world?\nLightness brings loss of ministers;\nMovement brings loss of subjects.\n\nThe Way is good—\nIt leaves no tracks behind.\nGood speech leaves no stuttering;\nGood planning needs no calculations.\nGood closure requires no locks to open;\nGood binding needs no cords to untie.\nThus the sage always rescues people without abandoning them,\nAlways rescues things without discarding them.\nThis is called *Clinging to Clarity*.\nThe good are teachers for the ungood;\nThe ungood are resources for the good.\nIf one does not honor their teacher,\nDoes not cherish their resource,\nThough they know the great confusion,\nThis is called *Essential Mystery*.\n\n**Chapter 28**\nKnow the masculine, hold to the feminine—\nThis is the Way of the world.\nThe Way of the world, ever virtuous, never departs,\nAnd returns to the infant.\nKnow the bright, hold to the dark—\nThis is the model for the world.\nEver steady, never erring,\nAnd returns to the formless.\nKnow the honored, hold to the humble—\nThis is the valley of the world.\nThe valley of the world, ever sufficient,\nAnd returns to the uncarved.\n\nThe uncarved scatters to become vessels;\nThe sage uses it for officials and leaders.\nThus great governance leaves no mark.\n\n**Chapter 29**\nIf one would take the world and act upon it,\nI see that it cannot be done.\nThe world is a divine vessel—\nIt cannot be acted upon.\nTo act upon it brings ruin;\nTo grasp it brings loss.\nThings move or follow,\nBreathe or exhale,\nAre strong or weak,\nAre joined or broken.\nThus the sage avoids excess,\nAvoids extravagance,\nAvoids extravagance.\n\n**Chapter 30**\nThe ruler who governs by the Way\nDoes not use force to dominate the world.\nHis affairs return to their natural course:\nWhere his armies dwell, thorns and brambles grow.\nThus the good are content with their harvest,\nAnd do not seek to dominate.\nContent, yet not arrogant,\nContent, yet not proud,\nContent, yet not boastful,\nContent, yet not self-sufficient—\nThis is content without domination.\nThings that are male grow old,\nAnd are called *Not the Way*.\nNot the Way perishes early.\n\n**Chapter 31**\nFine weapons are ominous instruments—\nMen detest them,\nSo those who follow the Way do not dwell upon them.\nThe noble, at home, values the left;\nIn war, values the right.\nWeapons are ominous instruments,\nNot the tools of the noble.\nUsed only when unavoidable,\nThey are held with solemnity—\nThis is the highest.\nTo delight in them is not beautiful;\nIf one delights in them,\nOne takes pleasure in killing.\nThose who take pleasure in killing\nCannot find joy in the world.\nThus auspicious matters are honored on the left,\nInauspicious matters on the right.\nHence the Left General commands the left,\nThe Right General commands the right.\nWhen many are killed, one mourns with tears;\nWhen victorious, one treats it with solemn rites.\n\n**Chapter 32**\nThe Way is ever nameless.\nThe uncarved, though small, under Heaven\nNo one dares to serve as its minister.\nIf kings and lords could guard it,\nAll things would come of their own accord.\nHeaven and Earth unite,\nAnd send down sweet dew—\nNo one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\nWhen names are first established,\nHeaven knows when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop brings no danger.\nThe Way in the world\nIs like valleys to rivers and seas.\n\n**Chapter 33**\nTo know others is wisdom;\nTo know oneself is enlightenment.\nTo overcome others is strength;\nTo overcome oneself is power.\nTo know contentment is wealth.\nTo persist with resolve is will.\nTo abide in one’s place is endurance;\nTo die without perishing is longevity.\n\n**Chapter 34**\nThe Great Way flows widely,\nYet people prefer its sides.\nAll things rely on it to live,\nYet it does not claim them.\nIt accomplishes without possessing,\nNurtures without dominating—\nThis may be called the Great.\nThus the sage never seeks to be great,\nAnd so achieves true greatness.\n\n**Chapter 35**\nGrasp the great image—\nThe world turns toward it.\nTurning toward it, yet unharmed,\nIt rests in peace and ease.\nDelight and bait—\nPassersby stop.\nThe Way emerges in speech,\nFlavorless, insipid.\nLooked at, not enough to see;\nListened to, not enough to hear.\nUsed, never exhausted—\n\n**Chapter 36**\nIf one would gather it,\nOne must first let it expand;\n\n**Chapter 36 (continued)**\nIf one would weaken it,\nOne must first make it strong;\nIf one would make it appear insufficient,\nOne must first let it flourish;\nIf one would take it away,\nOne must first give it.\n\nThis is called **subtle clarity** (微明).\nThe soft overcomes the hard,\nThe weak overcomes the strong.\nFish cannot be lifted from the depths,\nA state possesses sharp tools—\nOne must not display them to others.\n\n**Chapter 37**\nThe Dao is ever **non-action** (無為) yet nothing remains undone.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nAll things would transform of their own accord.\nWhen transformation begins and things take form,\nI shall govern them with the **nameless simplicity** (無名之朴).\nThe **nameless simplicity**, too, shall not desire.\n**Non-desire** with **stillness** (靜),\nThe world will return to its natural order.\n\n**Chapter 38**\nThe **virtue/power** (德) of the highest **Dao/Way** (道) is not **virtue/power** (德).\nAnd so it has **virtue/power** (德).\nThe **virtue/power** (德) of the lowest **Dao/Way** (道) does not lose **virtue/power** (德).\nAnd so it has no **virtue/power** (德).\nThe highest **virtue/power** (仁) acts yet does not claim credit.\nThe highest **righteousness** (義) acts yet does claim credit.\nThe highest **rites** (禮) acts yet none respond.\nAnd so it forces arms and insists.\nThus, when the **Dao/Way** (道) is lost, **virtue/power** (德) follows;\nWhen **virtue/power** (德) is lost, **仁** (仁) follows;\nWhen **仁** (仁) is lost, **righteousness** (義) follows;\nWhen **righteousness** (義) is lost, **rites** (禮) follow.\n\n**Rites** (禮) are the thin veneer of **loyalty and trustworthiness** (忠信),\nYet the beginning of disorder.\n**Preconceived notions** (前識) are the adornment of the **Dao/Way** (道),\nYet the origin of folly.\nThus the **great person** (大丈夫) abides in its substance, not its adornment;\nResides in its truth, not its veneer.\nTherefore, abandon the latter and embrace the former.\n\n「If the **valleys** (谷) are not filled, they shall fear exhaustion;\nIf all things lack their source, they shall fear annihilation;\nIf the **sovereigns and kings** (侯王) lack **uprightness** (贞), they shall fear ruin.\nThus, the noble esteems the lowly as its foundation,\nAnd the exalted takes the humble as its base.\nTherefore, when the **sovereigns and kings** call themselves *\"lonely\"* (孤), *\"widowed\"* (寡), *\"without wheels\"* (不毂),\nIs this not their taking the lowly as their foundation?\n\nThus, when a multitude of chariots is gathered, there is no single chariot.\nThey do not wish to gleam like jade, nor to clatter like stone.\n\n---\n**Chapter 40**\nThe **Dao/Way** moves through reversal,\nThe weak are its instrument.\nUnder heaven, all things arise from the **Having** (有),\nYet the **Having** arises from the **Non-Having** (无).\n\n---\n**Chapter 41**\nThe **superior person** (上士) hears the **Dao/Way** and diligently practices it;\nThe **middle person** (中士) hears the **Dao/Way** and holds it as if present, as if absent;\nThe **inferior person** (下士) hears the **Dao/Way** and laughs in derision.\nIf it is not laughed at, it is not the **Dao/Way**.\n\nThus, the **profound statement** (建言) says:\nTo illuminate the **Dao/Way** is like obscurity,\nTo advance the **Dao/Way** is like retreat,\nTo smooth the **Dao/Way** is like disorder,\nThe highest **virtue/power** (德) is like a **valley** (谷),\nThe greatest whiteness is like a stain,\nThe most expansive **virtue/power** is like insufficiency,\nTo establish **virtue/power** is like theft,\nTo preserve sincerity is like deception,\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel is fashioned late,\nThe greatest sound is faint,\nThe greatest form is shapeless.\nThe **Dao/Way** is hidden, nameless.\n\nOnly the **Dao/Way**—\nGenerous in lending, yet generous in repaying.\n\n---\n**Chapter 42**\nThe **Dao/Way** gives birth to **Oneness** (一),\n**Oneness** gives birth to the **Two** (二),\nThe **Two** gives birth to the **Three** (三),\nThe **Three** gives birth to all things.\nAll things bear the **yin** and embrace the **yang**,\nAnd through **harmonizing qi** (冲气) achieve balance.\nWhat people detest are *\"lonely\"* (孤), *\"widowed\"* (寡), *\"without wheels\"* (不毂),\nYet the **kings and nobles** (王公) take them as their titles.\nThus, some things are diminished to benefit,\nOthers are increased to harm.\nWhat people teach, I also teach:\nThe strong and violent shall not meet a proper end—\nI shall take this as my lesson.\n\n---\n**Chapter 43**\nUnder heaven, the most **yielding** (柔) overcomes the most **unyielding** (坚).\nThat which has no substance enters where there is no reputation.\nThus, one knows the benefit of **non-action** (无为).\nTeaching without words, benefiting through **non-action**—\nFew under heaven can attain this.\n\n---\n**Chapter 44**\n**Names** (名) and **substance** (身) become intimately familiar...\n\n「身与货熟多？\n**Wealth and body grow intimately familiar—how much more so?**\n\n得与亡熟病？\n**Gain and loss become well-acquainted—how much more so?**\n\n是故甚爱必大费，多藏必厚亡。\n**Thus, the more one loves, the greater the expenditure;\nThe more one hoards, the heavier the loss.**\n\n故知足不辱，知止不殆，\n**Therefore, one who knows contentment suffers no humiliation,\nOne who knows restraint faces no peril,**\n\n可以长久。\n**And may endure forever.**\n\n**Chapter 45**\nThe **greatly accomplished** (大成) seems incomplete—\nYet its use is **unexhausted** (不弊).\nThe **greatly full** (大盈) seems overflowing—\nYet its use is **unending** (不穷).\nThe **greatly upright** (大直) seems bent—\nThe **greatly skillful** (大巧) seems clumsy—\nThe **greatly eloquent** (大辩) seems inarticulate.\nThe **restless** (躁) overcomes the **obstructed** (塞),\nThe **serene** (静) overcomes the **boiling** (热).\n**To remain in stillness and clarity is to uphold the Dao as the standard for all under heaven.**\n\n**Chapter 46**\nWhen the **Dao prevails** (有道) under heaven,\n**The finest steeds are turned back to till the fields.**\nWhen the **Dao does not prevail** (无道) under heaven,\n**Warhorses breed in the suburbs.**\nNo crime is greater than **covetous desire** (可欲),\nNo calamity than **not knowing contentment** (不知足),\nNo misfortune than **desiring what one cannot obtain** (欲得).\n**Thus, true contentment is constant contentment—\nOne who knows it never strays from it.**\n\n**Chapter 47**\n**Not stepping beyond one’s door, one knows the world;\nNot peering through windows, one sees the Dao of heaven.**\nThe farther one’s gaze, the more distant one’s knowledge;\n**The more one seeks to know, the closer one’s understanding.**\n**Therefore, the Sage acts without venturing,\nSees without gazing,\nDoes without contriving—\nAnd thus achieves completion.**\n\n**Chapter 48**\n**To study learning is to daily increase,\nTo cultivate the Dao is to daily diminish.**\nDiminish and diminish again—\nUntil one reaches **non-action** (无为).\n**Non-action is the ultimate action.**\n**To take the world with ease is to act with simplicity;\nYet when affairs arise, such simplicity is insufficient to take the world.**\n\n**Chapter 49**\nThe **Sage has no fixed heart** (无心),\n**Taking the hearts of the people as their own.**\nThe **good, I make good** (善者吾善之),\n**The not-good, I also make good** (不善者吾亦善之)—**thus attaining goodness.**\nThe **trustworthy, I trust** (信者吾信之),\n**The untrustworthy, I also trust** (不信者吾亦信之)—**thus attaining trust.**\n**The Sage, present in the world, is cautious;\nYet in serving the world, their heart is at ease.**\n**All the people strain their ears and eyes,\nYet the Sage treats them as infants.**\n\n**Chapter 50**\n**Birth and death intertwine—\nLife and death are but one.**\nOf those who cling to life, **thirteen perish in ten ways** (生之徒十有三),\nOf those who cling to death, **thirteen perish in ten ways** (死之徒十有三).\n**Humans, clinging to life, are thrust into death’s domain—\nIn thirteen per ten.**\n**Why is this so?**\nBecause their **vitality is overbearing** (生生之厚).\n**Yet those who skillfully preserve life**\n**Walk upon land without fear of tigers or rhinoceroses** (不遇虎兕),\n**March into battle without being struck by weapons or armor** (不被甲兵).\n**The rhinoceros finds no place to hurl its horn,\nThe tiger finds no place to wield its claws,\nWeapons find no place to lodge their blades.**\n**Why is this so?**\nBecause they **avoid death’s domain** (无死地).\n\n**Chapter 51**\nThe **Dao** (道) gives birth to it,\n**Virtue** (德) nurtures it,\n**Form** (物) molds it,\n**Circumstance** (势) completes it.\n**Thus, all things reverence the Dao and honor virtue.**\nThe **Dao’s reverence, virtue’s honor—\nNone command them, yet they arise naturally.**\n**Therefore, the Dao gives birth and does not possess,\nActs and does not claim credit,\nGrows yet does not rule—\nThis is called **mysterious virtue** (玄德).**\n\n**Chapter 52**\nUnder heaven, there is a **beginning** (始),\n**Which we call the Mother of the world** (天下母).\n**Knowing this Mother, one also knows her child.**\n**Knowing the child, one returns to guard the Mother—\nAnd thus perishes not in body.**\n**Seal the senses, shut the doors—\nAnd thus one’s life is never weary.**\n**Open the senses, advance one’s affairs—\nAnd thus one’s life is never saved.**\n**To see the small as bright is clarity,\nTo hold the yielding as strong is power.**\n**To use its radiance and return to its clarity—\nWithout leaving behind one’s own ruin—\nThis is called **the Way of habit** (习常).**\n\n**Chapter 53**\n**If I were to claim knowledge and stand firm in the Dao,\nI would fear only to act in excess.**\n**The Dao is most smooth, yet people love ruggedness.**\n**Morning’s fields are cleared, yet afternoon’s are overgrown,\nGranaries are empty, yet treasures overflow.**\n**Adorned in fine silks, girded with sharp blades,\nThey glut themselves on food and drink—\nYet their wealth remains abundant.**\n**This is called **the ostentation of thieves** (盗夸);\nIt is not the Dao!**\n\n**Chapter 54**\n**The well-built stands firm and is not uprooted,\nThe well-embraced is not cast off—\nThus their descendants’ sacrifices never cease.**\n**Cultivate it in oneself, and one’s virtue is true;\nCultivate it in one’s family, and one’s virtue overflows;\nCultivate it in one’s village, and one’s virtue grows long;\nCultivate it in one’s state, and one’s virtue becomes abundant;\nCultivate it under all of heaven, and one’s virtue becomes universal.**\n**Thus, to observe oneself through oneself,\nOne’s family through one’s family,\nOne’s village through one’s village,\nOne’s state through one’s state,\nAll of heaven through all of heaven—\nHow do I know all of heaven thus?**\n**By this.**」\n\n「The depth of **virtue** (德) is like that of an infant.\n**Poisonous insects** do not sting,\n**Fierce beasts** do not seize,\n**Savage birds** do not attack.\nThe bones are frail, the sinews soft, yet their grasp is firm.\nThey do not know the union of male and female yet their **vital essence** (精) is fully formed—this is the peak of **vital essence** (精).\nThey cry all day yet never grow hoarse—this is the peak of **harmony** (和).\nTo know **harmony** (和) is to know the **constant** (常),\nTo know the **constant** (常) is to know **clarity** (明).\nTo benefit life is to bring **auspiciousness** (祥);\nTo let the **heart** (心) command the **qi** (氣) is to be strong.\nWhen things grow robust, they grow old—\nThis is called **not the Dao/Way** (不道),\nAnd **not the Dao/Way** (不道) will soon perish.\n**Chapter 66**\nThe wise do not speak,\nThose who speak do not know.\nStop up its **mouth** (兑),\nClose its **door** (門),\nDull its **sharpness** (鋭),\nRelieve its **anger** (忿),\nHarmonize its **radiance** (光),\nBlend with its **dust** (塵)—\nThis is called **Mysterious Uniformity** (玄同).\nThus, it cannot be grasped as near,\nNor rejected as distant;\nIt cannot be taken as advantageous,\nNor discarded as harmful;\nIt cannot be prized as noble,\nNor despised as lowly.\nThus, it is the most noble for all under heaven.\n**Chapter 67**\nTo govern a state with **rectitude** (正),\nTo employ **strategies** (奇) in warfare,\nTo take the world with **non-action** (無事)—\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nUnder heaven, many **taboos** (忌讳) exist,\nYet people grow ever poorer;\nMany **clever devices** (利器) are wielded,\nYet the state grows ever more **corrupt** (昏);\nMany **artful tricks** (伎巧) are practiced,\nYet **strange things** (奇物) proliferate;\n**Laws and rituals** (法物) grow ever more prominent,\nYet **thieves and robbers** (盗贼) abound.\nThus the **sage** (聖人) says:\n*\"I practice non-action, yet people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, yet people become upright;\nI have no affairs, yet people grow rich;\nI have no desires, yet people return to simplicity.\"*\"\n**Chapter 68**\n\nWhen governance is **obscure and quiet** (闷闷),\nIts people are **pure and sincere** (醇醇);\nWhen governance is **bright and scrutinizing** (察察),\nIts people are **deceitful and cunning** (缺缺).\n**Calamity** (祸) depends on **fortune** (福),\n**Fortune** (福) depends on **calamity** (祸).\nWho knows their **extremes** (極)?\nIt is **without rectitude** (無正).\nGovernance that is **too strange** (奇),\n**Goodness** (善) that is **too bizarre** (妖)—\nThe people’s **delusion** (迷) will endure long.\nThus the **sage** (聖人) remains **square without cutting** (方而不割),\n**Modest without harming** (廉而不害),\n**Upright without excess** (直而不肆),\n**Radiant without dazzling** (光而不曜).\n\n**Chapter 69**\nTo govern the people and serve **Heaven** (天),\nNothing surpasses **frugality** (啬).\nFor only **frugality** (啬)\nIs called **early cultivation** (早服).\n**Early cultivation** (早服) is **laying down deep virtue** (重积德).\nTo lay down deep virtue is to achieve nothing it cannot overcome,\nTo overcome nothing is to know no bounds.\nTo know no bounds is to have a state.\nThe **mother of a state** (有国之母),\nCan endure long.\nThis is called the **Dao/Way of deep roots** (深根),\n**Firm stems** (固蒂),\n**Long life** (長生),\n**Enduring vision** (久視).\n\n**Chapter 70**\nTo govern a great state is like **cooking a small fish** (亨小鲜).\nTo apply the **Dao/Way** (道) to all under heaven,\nIts **spirits** (鬼) do not become **ominous** (神).\nIt is not that its **spirits** (鬼) do not become **ominous** (神),\nBut that when they are **ominous** (神), they do not harm people.\nIt is not that when they are **ominous** (神) they do not harm people,\nBut that the **sage** (聖人) also does not harm people.\nThus, both do not harm each other—\nHence they can **return and abide** (交归) together.\n\n**Chapter 71**\nGreat states **flow downward** (下流),\nThe **pivot of the world** (天下之交),\nThe **receptive** (牝) of the world.\nThe **active** (牡) always **overcomes the receptive** (牝) through **tranquility** (静),\nAnd **tranquility** (静) is **to flow downward** (下).\nThus, great states **flow downward** (下) to the small states,\nAnd **take** (取) them;\nSmall states **flow downward** (下) to the great states,\nAnd **are taken** (取).\nThus, sometimes one **flows downward** (下) to **take** (取),\nSometimes one **flows downward** (下) as if to **take** (取).\nGreat states desire only to **harbor and nourish** (兼畜) the people,\nSmall states desire only to **enter and serve** (入事) them.\nThese two, each attaining what they desire—\nThe greater ought to **flow downward** (下).\nThus, **to flow downward** (下) is to **take** (取).\n\n**Chapter 72**\nThe **Dao/Way** (道) is the **mystery** (奧) of all things.\n**Virtue** (善) is the treasure of people;\n**Non-virtue** (不善) is what people do not treasure.\n**Fine words** (美言) can earn **esteem** (尊),\n**Actions** (行) can **augment** (加) others.\nIf people’s **non-virtue** (不善) is cast aside, what remains?\nThus, to **establish the Son of Heaven** (立天子),\nTo **appoint the Three Exalted Ones** (置三公),\nEven with **arching jade tablets** (拱璧) and **four horses** (先驷马),\nIt is not as good as **sitting and presenting this Dao/Way** (坐进此道).\nWhy did the ancients value this **Dao/Way** (道) so highly?\nWas it not because **to seek and obtain** (求以得),\nAnd **to have faults yet strive** (有罪以勉)?\nThus, it is the most noble for all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 73**\nTo **act without acting** (無為),\nTo **do without doing** (事無事),\nTo **taste without tasting** (味無味).\nGreat or small, many or few—\n**Repay resentment with virtue** (報怨以德).\n**Difficult tasks** (難) are **easier than easy ones** (易),\n**Great affairs** (大) are **smaller than small ones** (細).\nUnder heaven, **difficult tasks** (難) must begin with what is **easy** (易);\nUnder heaven, **great affairs** (大) must begin with what is **small** (細).\nThus, the **sage** (聖人) never **acts as great** (為大),\nHence they can **complete their greatness** (成其大).\nHe who **makes light of promises** (輕諾) will **lack trustworthiness** (寡信),\nHe who **multiplies cleverness** (多易) will **encounter many difficulties** (多難).\nThus, the **sage** (聖人) **avoids what is difficult** (犹難之),\nHence they **never encounter difficulties** (終無難).\n\n**Chapter 74**\nIts **tranquility** (安) is **easy to maintain** (易持),\nIts **latent signs** (未兆) are **easy to plan against** (易谋),\nIts **fragility** (脆) is **easy to break** (易破),\nIts **subtlety** (微) is **easy to disperse** (易散).\nTo **act before its existence** (未有),\nTo **govern before its chaos** (未乱).\nA tree as thick as **two arms embracing** (合抱之木),\nGrows from a **tiny sprout** (毫末);\nA **nine-tiered terrace** (九层之台),\nRises from a **heap of earth** (累土);\nA **thousand-li journey** (千里之行),\nBegins with a **single step** (足下).\nTo **act is to court defeat** (為者敗之),\nTo **cling is to lose it** (执者失之).\nThus, the **sage** (聖人) **does not act** (無為), hence **no defeat** (故無敗);\n**Does not cling** (無执), hence **no loss** (故無失).\nThe people’s **endeavors** (從事),\nOften **fail just as completion nears** (常于几成而敗之).\nTo **be cautious at the end as at the beginning** (慎终如始),\nThen there will be **no failed affairs** (敗事).\nThus, the **sage** (聖人) **desires yet does not desire** (欲不欲),\nDoes not **value difficult-to-obtain wealth** (貴難得之货);\n**Learns yet does not learn** (學不學),\n**Repeats what others have already passed over** (復眾人之所過).\nTo **aid the natural course of all things** (辅万物之自然而),\nYet **dare not act** (不敢為).\n\n「Frugality, hence able to be expansive;\nNot daring to lead the world, hence able to **fulfill one’s role and endure** (成器长).\nNow to abandon **virtue/power** (慈) and yet be **bold** (勇),\nTo abandon frugality and yet seek **expansiveness** (广),\nTo abandon **humility** (后) and yet **take the lead** (先)—\nThis is death.\n\n**Virtue/power** (慈): in battle, it brings victory;\nIn defense, it brings **fortification**.\nWhen Heaven intends to **aid** (救) one, it does so with **virtue/power** (慈) as its shield.\n\n**Chapter 68**\nThe ancients who excelled as **scholars** (士) were not **martial** (武);\nThose skilled in war did not **rage** (怒);\nThose who best **vanquished enemies** did not **contend** (争);\nThose who best **employed benevolence** (仁) **took the lower position** (为下).\nThis is called the **virtue/power of non-contention** (不争之德).\nThus, by **utilizing others’ strength** (用人之力),\nThis is called **harmonizing with Heaven’s ultimate** (配天古之极).\n\n**Chapter 69**\nIn wielding arms, there is a saying:\n*“I dare not be the aggressor but only the defender,\nNot dare to advance an inch but retreat a foot.”*\nThis is called **moving without movement** (行无行),\n**Repelling without arms** (攘无臂),\n**Confronting without rivals** (仍无敌),\n**Seizing without weapons** (执无兵).\n**No greater calamity than underestimating the enemy** (轻敌),\nFor underestimating the enemy nearly **loses one’s treasures** (丧吾宝).\nThus, when armies clash, **the compassionate prevail** (哀者胜).\n\n**Chapter 70**\nMy words are **easy to know, easy to act upon** (易知，易行).\nYet the world **cannot know them, cannot act upon them**.\nWords have their **root** (宗), affairs have their **master** (君).\nIt is only because of **ignorance** (无知) that they **do not know me**.\nFew **know me**, hence those who **follow me are precious** (则我者贵).\nThus, the **sage wears coarse cloth while harboring jade**.\n\n**Chapter 71**\nTo **know what one does not know** is **superior** (知不知上),\nTo **not know what one knows** is **illness** (不知知，病).\nThus, the **sage does not fall ill**.\nBecause he **heals illness with illness**, hence he **does not fall ill**.\n\n**Chapter 72**\nWhen the people **do not fear authority**, **great authority arrives**.\nDo not **narrow their dwelling**, do not **exhaust their sustenance**.\nIt is only because of **not exhausting** that there is **no exhaustion**.\nThus, the **sage knows himself but does not display himself**,\nLoves himself but does not **exalt himself**.\nHence, **discard that, take this**.\n\n**Chapter 73**\nTo be **bold in daring is to kill**,\nTo be **bold in not daring is to live**.\nKnow that these two may bring **benefit or harm**.\nWhat Heaven **abhors**, who knows its reason?\n\nHeaven’s **Dao/Way**—\n**Non-contention yet triumphant**,\n**Silent yet responsive**,\n**Unsummoned yet arriving**,\n**Unassuming yet masterful in planning**.\nHeaven’s net is vast and **meshed yet not entangled** (恢恢，疏而不漏).\n\n**Chapter 74**\nThe people do not fear death—\nHow can you **terrify them with death**?\nIf one **always fears death** and yet **acts strangely** (为奇),\nI would **seize and kill them**—what would I **dare**?\nThere are always **official executioners** who kill.\nFor one to **usurp the executioner’s role** and kill—\nThis is called **usurping the master carpenter’s chisel**.\nHe who **usurps the master carpenter’s chisel**—\nFew escape **injuring their hands**.\n\n**Chapter 75**\nThe people’s **hunger** stems from their **rulers’ excessive taxation** (食税之多),\nThus they **suffer hunger**.\nThe people’s **difficulty to govern** stems from their **rulers’ interference** (有为),\nThus they are **hard to govern**.\nPeople **trifle with death** because their **burden of living is heavy** (生生之厚),\nThus they **lightly regard death**.\nIt is only those who **do not cling to life** who are **superior to those who prize it**.\n\n**Chapter 76**\n**Life’s vitality** (生之柔弱) is **soft and weak**,\nYet in death, it becomes **hard and strong**.\nAll things—grasses and trees—\nIn life are **tender and fragile**,\nYet in death become **withered and brittle**.\nThus, the **hard and strong** belong to death,\nThe **soft and weak** belong to life.\nHence, **strong arms do not conquer** (兵强则不胜),\n**Hard wood is easily split** (木强则共).\nThus, the **hard and strong** take the **lower position**,\nThe **soft and weak** take the **upper position**.\n\n**Chapter 77**\nHeaven’s **Dao/Way**—\nIs it not like **drawing a bow**?\n\n「**Chapter 78**»\nThe **high are lowered**,\nThe **low are raised**,\nThe **excessive are diminished**,\nThe **deficient are supplemented**.\nHeaven’s **Dao/Way**—\nIt diminishes excess and supplements deficiency;\nYet **human affairs** are otherwise—\nThey diminish the deficient and heap upon the excessive.\nHow can one **heap upon the world** and yet **supplement the deficient**?\nOnly those who **embody the Dao**.\nThus, the **Sage acts but does not claim** (恃),\nAccomplishes deeds but does not dwell upon them—\nThis is how **the Sage is not seen as virtuous**.\n\n**Chapter 79**»\nThe **soft and weak** of all things under Heaven\nAre none greater than **water**,\nYet it **assails the hard and strong**—\nNone can **outdo it** (先),\nAnd there is **nothing to replace it**.\nThus, the weak **overcome the strong**,\nThe **soft overcomes the rigid**—\nYet none under Heaven **know** or **can practice** this.\nHence, the **Sage says**:\n“To **bear the filth of the state** (垢) is to be called the **lord of the ancestral altars** (社稷主);\nTo **bear the state’s calamities** (不祥) is to be called the **king of all under Heaven**.”\n**Right words seem inverted**.\n\n**Chapter 80**»\n**Sages of small states with few people**,\nThough they possess **hundreds and thousands of implements** (什伯之器),\nDo not **utilize them**;\nThough they **value life**,\nThey do not **flee to distant lands**.\nThough they have **chariots and boats**,\nThere is **none to ride them**;\nThough they have **armor and weapons**,\nThere is **none to display them**.\nThey **restore the people** to **tying knots** (結绳) for record-keeping,\nContent with their **food**,\nAdorned in their **garments**,\nSecure in their **dwellings**,\nDelighted in their **customs**,\nWhere neighboring states **look upon one another**,\nAnd the sounds of **chickens and dogs** are heard between them—\nThe people **grow old and die**,\nYet **do not travel to one another**.\n\n**Chapter 81**»\n**Trustworthy words** are not **ornate**,\n**Ornate words** are not **trustworthy**.\n**The virtuous do not argue**,\n**Those who argue are not virtuous**.\n**The wise are not learned** (博),\n**The learned are not wise**.\n**The Sage does not hoard**—\nWhen he **acts for others**, his **virtue/power** (德) increases;\nWhen he **gives to others**, his **abundance** (有) grows ever greater.\nHeaven’s **Dao/Way**—\n**It benefits but does not harm**.\nThe **Sage’s Dao/Way**—\n**It acts but does not contend**.",

      "translated_text": "**\"The Dao De Jing: The Tang-Era Easy State Dragon Thriving Temple Dao De Jing Stele Edition**\n\nQian Da-xin remarked: *\"Examining the He Shang Gong annotated edition, the section beginning with ‘The Dao that can be spoken’ constitutes the Dao Jing (Upper Scroll), while the section beginning with ‘The highest virtue is non-action’ forms the De Jing (Lower Scroll).\"*\n\nZhao Shuo, in his postscript to Wang Bi’s commentary, stated that Wang did not separate *Dao* and *De* into upper and lower scrolls, thus preserving a form closer to the ancient text. Yet, Lu De-ming’s *Shuowen Jiezi* explicitly follows the Fu Si edition, titling it *Dao Jing (Upper Scroll)* and *De Jing (Lower Scroll)*, identical to the He Shang Gong edition. Zhao’s claim that his version was closer to antiquity was likely based on a Song-dynasty transcription, without further verification.\n\nIn my private collection, there are five stone-carved editions of the *Dao De Jing*, among which only the Tang Emperor Xuanzong’s annotated edition and this one divide the text into *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*—a structure consistent with Han and Wei-era chapter divisions. This edition, carved in early Tang, differs significantly in phrasing from other versions. For instance:\n- *\"Wu\"* (無) is rendered as *\"Wu\"* (無),\n- *\"Yu\"* (愈) as *\"Yu\"* (俞),\n- *\"Yun\"* (芸) as *\"Yun\"* (云),\n- *\"Yu\"* (誉) as *\"Yu\"* (豫),\n- *\"Huang\"* (荒) as *\"Mang\"* (忙),\n- *\"Zuo\"* (佐) as *\"Zuo\"* (作),\n- *\"■\"* (an obscure character) as *\"Xi\"* (翕).\n\nFurther, where the text reads *\"Thus, it can conceal without renewal, achieving completion,\"* the stele version states: *\"Thus, it can conceal and return to completion.\"* Beneath *\"Where the Master resides, brambles and thorns grow,\"* the stele omits the lines *\"After a great army passes, there will surely be years of calamity.\"* Below *\"The High General takes the right,\"* the stele lacks the phrase *\"Speak to them with funeral rites.\"* In the passage *\"Only when one is sick of sickness does one not fall ill; the Sage does not fall ill because he is sick of sickness,\"* the stele simplifies it to: *\"Thus, the Sage does not fall ill because he is sick of sickness.\"*\n\nSuch variations far surpass other editions, and I cite only a few examples to illustrate the value of ancient stone inscriptions.\n\nWu Yi remarked that dividing the *Laozi* into *Dao Jing (Upper Scroll)* and *De Jing (Lower Scroll)* aligns with ancient editions.\n\nLater, Lu You’s postscript noted: *\"Zhao claimed that Wang Fu-si’s *Laozi* did not separate *Dao* and *De* into upper and lower scrolls, saying it was closer to antiquity. Yet this edition has long been divided.\"* Thus, the Song dynasty had already lost Fu Si’s definitive text. Proof lies in Jing Yi’s *Lunyu Cun* citation of the *Laozi De Jing*: *\"The heavenly net is vast, yet nothing escapes.\"*\n\nYet further examination of *Han Shu* annotations reveals:\n- In the *Wei Bo* transmission, Yan Shigu cites the *Laozi Dao Jing*: *\"When a state is in chaos, loyal ministers arise.\"*\n- In the *Tian Heng* transmission, he cites the *Laozi De Jing*: *\"The noble relies on the lowly as foundation; the exalted relies on the humble as base—thus, lords and kings call themselves ‘orphaned, widowed, and unworthy.’\"*\n- In the *Chu Yuanwang* transmission, he cites the *Laozi De Jing*: *\"Knowing contentment brings no disgrace.\"*\n- In the *Yan Zhu* transmission, he notes: *\"This is what the *Laozi* says: ‘Where the Master resides, brambles and thorns grow.’\"* Yan Shigu comments: *\"This is from the *Dao Jing* of the *Laozi*.\"*\n- In the *Yang Xiong* transmission, citing *\"Few know me, yet I am noble,\"* Yan Shigu states: *\"The *Laozi De Jing* says: ‘Few know me, yet I am noble.’\"*\n- In the *Cruel Officials* transmission, the *Laozi* states: *\"The highest virtue acts without virtue, thus it has virtue; the lowest virtue clings to virtue, thus it lacks virtue. When laws proliferate, thieves multiply.\"* Yan Shigu remarks: *\"This is from the *De Jing* of the *Laozi*.\"*\n- For *\"The petty scholar hears the Dao and laughs,\"* he notes: *\"This is from the *Dao Jing* of the *Laozi*.\"*\n\nIn the *Western Regions* transmission’s annotation, it cites the *Laozi De Jing*: *\"When the world follows the Dao, horses are led backward to manure.\"* Clearly, the sources that distinguish *Dao* and *De* in their citations align with the *Shuowen Jiezi*’s *\"Dao Jing Audio and Meaning\"* and *\"De Jing Audio and Meaning.\"*\n\nAdditionally, Jia Gongyan’s *Zhou Li Shi Shi* commentary asserts: *\"The *Laozi Dao Jing* states: ‘The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao.’\"* Below, he notes: *\"The *De Jing* states: ‘The highest virtue acts without virtue, thus it has virtue.’\"*\n\nZhang Huai’s *Hou Han Shu* annotation, in the *Zhi □* transmission, claims: *\"The *Laozi Dao Jing* says: ‘Fish cannot escape the spring.’\"*\n\nThese scholars, in early Tang, uniformly attested to this division. (The *Dream True Guest Stele* also states: *\"Examining the *Dao Jing*, compassion is the treasure.\"*) Such divisions must have originated from Jin and Song-era editions, as evidenced by this stele’s titles, which are well-founded.\n\nWang Kang remarked: *\"The upper scroll is titled *Laozi Dao Jing*, and the lower *Laozi De Jing*, clearly distinguishing *Dao* and *De* without merging them. Thus, Xuanzong’s annotations truly follow this ancient structure.\"*\n\nDong Jiong’s *Collected Books Record* incorrectly states: *\"After Xuanzong’s annotations were completed, the text was standardized as the *Dao De Jing*, grouping all references to *Dao* in the upper scroll and *De* in the lower.\"* This is incorrect.\n\nWu Yun noted: *\"The *Sui Shu Jing Ji Zhi* records the *Dao De Jing* in two volumes with Wang Bi’s commentary. Zhao Shuo and Xiong Ke-zhong’s postscripts both claim it was not divided into *Dao De Jing*, yet the current *Shuowen Jiezi* edition is split into two scrolls, leading some to suspect later carvers inserted divisions. However, Jing Yi’s *Lunyu Cun* cites the *Laozi De Jing*: ‘The heavenly net is vast, yet nothing escapes,’ and Yan Shigu’s *Han Shu* annotations frequently cite the *Laozi Dao Jing* and *De Jing* separately. Thus, the division predates Lu De-ming. This stele’s *De Jing* division is well-justified.\"*\n\nSun Yi-ran stated: *\"The *Laozi* consists of eighty-one chapters divided into upper and lower scrolls, titled *Dao Jing* and *De Jing*. The He Shang Gong edition, the *Shuowen Jiezi*’s recorded Wang Bi edition, the Daoist Canon’s Tang Fu Yi annotated edition, and the stone-carved Tang Xuanzong annotated edition all follow this structure.\"*",

be taken as advantageous,\nNor discarded as harmful;\nIt cannot be prized as noble,\nNor despised as lowly.\nThus, it is the most noble for all under heaven.\n**Chapter 67**\nTo govern a state with **rectitude** (正),\nTo employ **strategies** (奇) in warfare,\nTo take the world with **non-action** (無事)—\nHow do I know this is so?\nBy this:\nUnder heaven, many **taboos** (忌讳) exist,\nYet people grow ever poorer;\nMany **clever devices** (利器) are wielded,\nYet the state grows ever more **corrupt** (昏);\nMany **artful tricks** (伎巧) are practiced,\nYet **strange things** (奇物) proliferate;\n**Laws and rituals** (法物) grow ever more prominent,\nYet **thieves and robbers** (盗贼) abound.\nThus the **sage** (聖人) says:\n*\"I practice non-action, yet people transform themselves;\nI love tranquility, yet people become upright;\nI have no affairs, yet people grow rich;\nI have no desires, yet people return to simplicity.\"*\"\n**Chapter 68**\n\nWhen governance is **obscure and

(福),\n**Fortune** (福) depends on **calamity** (祸).\nWho knows their **extremes** (極)?\nIt is **without rectitude** (無正).\nGovernance that is **too strange** (奇),\n**Goodness** (善) that is **too bizarre** (妖)—\nThe people’s **delusion** (迷) will endure long.\nThus the **sage** (聖人) remains **square without cutting** (方而不割),\n**Modest without harming** (廉而不害),\n**Upright without excess** (直而不肆),\n**Radiant without dazzling** (光而不曜).\n\n**Chapter 69**\nTo govern the people and serve **Heaven** (天),\nNothing surpasses **frugality** (啬).\nFor only **frugality** (啬)\nIs called **early cultivation** (早服).\n**Early cultivation** (早服) is **laying down deep virtue** (重积德).\nTo lay down deep virtue is to achieve nothing it cannot overcome,\nTo overcome nothing is to know no bounds.\nTo know no bounds is to have a state.\nThe **mother of a state** (有国之母),\nCan endure long.\nThis is called the **Dao/Way of deep roots** (深根),\n**Firm stems** (固蒂),\n**Long life** (長生),\n**Enduring vision** (久視).\n\n**Chapter 70**\nTo govern a great state is like **cooking a small fish** (亨小鲜).\nTo apply the **Dao/Way** (道) to all under heaven,\nIts **spirits** (鬼) do not become **ominous** (神).\nIt is not that its **spirits** (鬼) do not become **ominous** (神),\nBut that when they are **ominous** (神), they do not harm people.\nIt is not that when they are **ominous** (神) they do not harm people,\nBut that the **sage** (聖人) also does not harm people.\nThus, both do not harm each other—\nHence they can **return and abide** (交归) together.\n\n**Chapter 71**\nGreat states **flow downward** (下流),\nThe **pivot of the world** (天下之交),\nThe **receptive** (牝) of the world.\nThe **active** (牡) always **overcomes the receptive** (牝) through **tranquility** (静),\nAnd **tranquility** (静) is **to flow downward** (下).\nThus, great states **flow downward** (下) to the small states,\nAnd **take** (取) them;\nSmall states **flow downward** (下) to the great states,\nAnd **are taken** (取).\nThus, sometimes one **flows downward** (下) to **take** (取),\nSometimes one **flows downward** (下) as if to **take** (取).\nGreat states desire only to **harbor and nourish** (兼畜) the people,\nSmall states desire only to **enter and serve** (入事) them.\nThese two, each attaining what they desire—\nThe greater ought to **flow downward** (下).\nThus, **to flow downward** (下) is to **take** (取).\n\n**Chapter 72**\nThe **Dao/Way** (道) is the **mystery** (奧) of all things.\n**Virtue** (善) is the treasure of people;\n**Non-virtue** (不善) is what people do not treasure.\n**Fine words** (美言) can earn **esteem** (尊),\n**Actions** (行) can **augment** (加) others.\nIf people’s **non-virtue** (不善) is cast aside, what remains?\nThus, to **establish the Son of Heaven** (立天子),\nTo **appoint the Three Exalted Ones** (置三公),\nEven with **arching jade tablets** (拱璧) and **four horses** (先驷马),\nIt is not as good as **sitting and presenting this Dao/Way** (坐进此道).\nWhy did the ancients value this **Dao/Way** (道) so highly?\nWas it not because **to seek and obtain** (求以得),\nAnd **to have faults yet strive** (有罪以勉)?\nThus, it is the most noble for all under heaven.\n\n**Chapter 73**\nTo **act without acting** (無為),\nTo **do without doing** (事無事),\nTo **taste without tasting** (味無味).\nGreat or small, many or few—\n**Repay resentment with virtue** (報怨以德).\n**Difficult tasks** (難) are **easier than easy ones** (易),\n**Great affairs** (大) are **smaller than small ones** (細).\nUnder heaven, **difficult tasks** (難) must begin with what is **easy** (易);\nUnder heaven, **great affairs** (大) must begin with what is **small** (細).\nThus, the **sage** (聖人) never **acts as great** (為大),\nHence they can **complete their greatness** (成其大).\nHe who **makes light of promises** (輕諾) will **lack trustworthiness** (寡信),\nHe who **multiplies cleverness** (多易) will **encounter many difficulties** (多難).\nThus, the **sage** (聖人) **avoids what is difficult** (犹難之),\nHence they **never encounter difficulties** (終無難).\n\n**Chapter 74**\nIts **tranquility** (安) is **easy to maintain** (易持),\nIts **latent signs** (未兆) are **easy to plan against** (易谋),\nIts **fragility** (脆) is **easy to break** (易破),\nIts **subtlety** (微) is **easy to disperse** (易散).\nTo **act before its existence** (未有),\nTo **govern before its chaos** (未乱).\nA tree as thick as **two arms embracing** (合抱之木),\nGrows from a **tiny sprout** (毫末);\nA **nine-tiered terrace** (九层之台),\nRises from a **heap of earth** (累土);\nA **thousand-li journey** (千里之行),\nBegins with a **single step** (足下).\nTo **act is to court defeat** (為者敗之),\nTo **cling is to lose it** (执者失之).\nThus, the **sage** (聖人) **does not act** (無為), hence **no defeat** (故無敗);\n**Does not cling** (無执), hence **no loss** (故無失).\nThe people’s **endeavors** (從事),\nOften **fail just as completion nears** (常于几成而敗之).\nTo **be cautious at the end as at the beginning** (慎终如始),\nThen there will be **no failed affairs** (敗事).\nThus, the **sage** (聖人) **desires yet does not desire** (欲不欲),\nDoes not **value difficult-to-obtain wealth** (貴難得之货);\n**Learns yet does not learn** (學不學),\n**Repeats what others have already passed over** (復眾人之所過).\nTo **aid the
