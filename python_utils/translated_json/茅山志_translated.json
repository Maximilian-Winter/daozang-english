in youth, unbound by convention.\nOn Northern Mountain, the heart stilled; in forests and marshes, thoughts accumulated.\nSeeking the divine, he ascended perilous heights; treading valleys, he pursued the arduous path.\nAt the master’s gate, he cast off form; severing worldly ties, he offered his body.\nWith unwavering sincerity, he followed the natural course, unrestrained.\nThus he approached the radiant craftsman and received the sacred scripture.\nWith disheveled hair, he knelt in prayer; he severed his head and mutilated his body.\nGirded with rope, he rejoiced alone, unashamed of hunger and cold.\nHis path was the Dao; his refuge, the True.\nHis devotion moved the Supreme Thearch, stirring the Great Mystery.\n\nNow, with reverence, We confer upon him the exalted rank of *Taiyuan Zhenren*, Lord of the Eastern Marchmount, Supreme Minister, and Director of Destinies.\nHis heart is upright, his conduct firm as metal and stone.\nHis cinnabar resolve outshines the multitude; his spirit dwells in lofty clarity.\n\nThus, first, We bestow upon him the Jade-Iron Banner of the Eight Mighties, that he may subdue the roots of evil and vanquish the myriad spirits.\n\nHe endured frost in forests and valleys, savoring the mysterious and gazing upon the True.\nHis thoughts stirred the secluded peaks; his heart’s sincerity was revealed.\nThus, second, We bestow upon him the Purple-Tasseled Staff, the Lotus-Bloom Crown, that he may summon the thousand numina, seal the mountains, and command the clouds.\n\nHe forsook his home and journeyed alone, parting from kin to delight in immortality.\nThrough trials and hardships, he bared his breast to the mountains and rivers in winter.\nThus, third, We bestow upon him the Embroidered Plumage Robe and the Vermilion Skirt of Flying Clouds, that he may ascend the celestial steps with ease and bear the commands of the Jade Perfected.\n\nHe traversed forests and marshes, treading perilous heights.\nHis heart was devoted, his will steadfast, undaunted by hardship.\nThus, fourth, We bestow upon him the Chariot of Spotted Dragons and the Plow of White Tigers, that he may float through the great void and wheel his carriage in the imperial court.\n\nHe pushed through brambles, merging with the light, enduring frost and snow.\nHis heart sought the radiant Perfected, unwavering and unafraid.\nThus, fifth, We bestow upon him the Curved Dawn Canopy and the Jade Chamber of Green Radiance, that he may roam the Nine Palaces and still his spirit in warmth and secrecy.\n\nHe withdrew to secluded peaks, his heart untiring.\nConcealing his form in hidden mountains, his thoughts pervaded the myriad groves.\nThus, sixth, We bestow upon him the Divine Firebrand and the Moon-Bright Spirit Pearl, that he may ascend to the Great Ultimate and convey his voice to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nHis steadfast heart was lofty and serene; no excess or defilement touched him.\nPure and luminous as white jade, his inner and outer walls stood firm.\nThus, seventh, We bestow upon him the Brocade Banner and Embroidered Banner-Staff, that he may summon the Six Yin Forces and the Jade Maidens to attend his chariot.\n\nHis compassion extended to all beings; his hidden virtue nurtured the myriad lives.\nEven the tiniest creatures were the objects of his care.\nThus, eighth, We bestow upon him the Phoenix and Luan-Bird Cries, the Golden Bell and Jade Chime, that he may harmonize the spirits in the empty halls and delight in the joy of the Perfected and the numina.\n\nHe endured hunger and thirst to nourish his spirit, seeking the True through hardship.\nThe myriad things could not sway him; the thousand evils could not corrupt his purity.\nThus, ninth, We bestow upon him the Purple Nectar of the Forest and the Jade Elixir in a Golden Vessel, that he may attain a lifespan equal to the Three Luminaries and inscribe his name on the Cinnabar Tablet.\n\nHis bearing leads the pure and mysterious; his purple weft adorns the Eight Radiant Ones.\nHis heart shines with the double sun; his spirit leaps in the great rosy clouds—truly the foremost of the Perfected.\nThus We grant him the title *Taiyuan*, for his nine virtues are complete. The accumulation of his merits has moved the Grand Tenuity; heaven and humanity, without prior accord, have converged in harmony.\nNow We recompense these nine deeds to requite his past devotion.\n\nHis heart and spirit are bright and upright, the abode of the Four Numinous Beasts.\nHis cinnabar truth shines forth; his integrity is unwavering.\nHis charge is whole and steadfast; his mirror reflects even the subtlest things.\nNow We appoint him Supreme Minister, to govern the Eastern Marchmount.\nWe further entrust him with the Directorship of Destinies, to oversee the celestial registers.\nWe assign him forty Jade Boys and forty Jade Maidens, to attend him in the Grand Tenuity and serve in the Great Ultimate.\n\nHis administrative palace is the Red City, the Jade Cavern Repository.\nLet him govern it with diligence, reporting all activities without fail.\n\nThe Supreme Thearch dispatches this decree, written in purple and white script, to the Central Lord.\n*In the third year of Yongshi, the year Dingwei, the Supreme Thearch issued this command, as recorded by the Celestial Perfected.*\n\nMaogu of Xianyang, whose family resided at the Southern Pass, styled Jivei, was destined for transcendence from birth. His rank was that of Registrar of Destinies, and he concurrently oversaw the terrestrial perfected. He was charged with recommending those of the Dao, whose lifespans were intertwined with their virtue. Wherever his diligence and reverence took root, the laws of the Four Poles were fully realized. His administrative palace was the Terrace of Winding Clouds, and his domain the Juqu Mountains of Danyang. Let him govern it with vigilance, reporting all activities without fail.\n\nThe decree in purple and white script to Junior Lord states:\nMaogu’s younger brother, Zhong, embodies purity and clarity from birth. Though his return to rectitude came late, his thoughts were subtle and his sincerity profound. He severed ties with the Six Heavens of Delusion, his talent and intelligence shining brightly. Now We appoint him Director of the Three Offices, to safeguard life and establish names. He shall oversee Mount Tai, presiding over the records of death and birth. His rank is that of Earthbound Transcendent, the finest among the Nine Palaces. He shall instruct the young and uninitiated, guiding them to completion. He shall educate the female officials, imparting the wondrous arts of the numinous. He shall govern the hundred spirits, overseeing the exorcism of malevolent forces. He shall inspect the sources of rivers, ensuring the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River. He shall seal and guard the Golden Valley, storing the jade elixir within. He shall supervise the cultivation of dragon mushrooms and luminous herbs that glow at night. His domain is the Mountain of Eternal Constancy, girded by the mouth of the Northern Grotto, where he shall guard the gate of the Yin Palace. Let him strive with diligence, reporting all activities without fail.\n\nThis inscription was carved in stone in the third year of Putong under the Liang dynasty. It appears in the *Hua Yang Nan Dong Jiu Xi Bei* and is recorded in the *Jian Wen Jin Shi Pian*.\n\n---\n\n**Appendix: Memorials and Edicts of the Qi and Liang Dynasties**\n\n**Edict of Emperor Wu of Qi in Response to Tao Yinju’s Retreat to the Mountains**\nYou have relinquished worldly burdens and grain, longing for the clarity and emptiness of the mountains. In tranquility, you find your nature, and your joy is well-placed—We commend your resolve. Should you require anything, you need only report it. We hereby grant you ten bolts of silk and twenty torches. Additionally, We decree a monthly provision of five *jin* of superior *fuling* and two *dou* of white honey for your alchemical practices.\n\n**Memorial of Yinju Requesting Resignation from Office**\nYour servant has heard that the wind of Yao soared to the heavens, and the discourse of Yingyang stirred the Yellow River. The virtue of Han encompassed the earth, and the aura of Shangyin nurtured the mushrooms of immortality. Your servant has lingered in the world for many years, bound by cap and sash. Service was never for glory, nor study for salary. I have long yearned to cast off my official cords and plow the fields alone, to dwell in the moonlit ravines and play the zither amidst the clouds. By the grace of Your Majesty’s favor, I have been permitted to retire to the hills and vales. Now, I shall vanish like a shadow in the cassia courtyard, my spirit communing with the pines. Once I pass through the Eastern Pass, my homeland will be in sight. The mere thought stirs my heart, and I weep by the waterside. My boat is already lost to the currents, and I cannot present myself in person. Unable to bear the weight of my longing, I humbly submit this memorial.\n\n**Emperor Wu of Liang’s Response to Yinju’s Treatise on Calligraphy**\nThe two scrolls you wished to retain briefly are not unusual in their paper. Since they are part of your traveling library, I had them sent to you earlier. There is nothing particularly noteworthy here, but if you require more finely written texts, I shall provide them. For instance, in the style of *lun* and *zhen*, Wang Xizhi’s calligraphy is not excessively fine. His *Yue Yi Lun* is somewhat robust, but I suspect it is not an authentic work. The *Tai Shi Zhen* is slightly more refined and charming, yet the brushwork is too delicate, and the style deviates—both have already been examined by the keenest eyes. Beyond these, there is nothing else to send.\n\n**Memorial of Yinju to Emperor Wu on Calligraphy**\n\n**Memorial of Yinju to Emperor Wu on Calligraphy (Continued)**\n\nBy Your Majesty’s decree, I have reviewed the works held by the Central Secretariat, and among those with some ability, only Zhou Xizan stands out. For the yellow of the heart’s core truly awaits the exhalation of *jiazhong*’s qi. Now that Your Majesty’s own calligraphy embodies the sublime, it perfects both principle and application below. Whenever I reflect on Your Majesty’s discussions of Zhong [You] and Wang [Xizhi] as models for the realm, the advancement of this art is only just beginning. What grieves me is my own dullness—I cannot fathom such heights, and my admiration verges on self-deception.\n\nPreviously, I received three sheets of Your Majesty’s divine brushwork, and with these, the total now reaches five. Not only does each character command my gaze, but every stroke pierces my heart. Day by day, their vigor and charm grow beyond description. Compared to those of past years, they are no longer of the same order. If these alone serve as models, why seek further among Zhong and Wang?\n\nMy reverence has always been profound, but now my admiration deepens still. Joy and delight fill me, and I cannot but report this. I prostrate myself in gratitude for the two scrolls, having examined their inscribed slips. All accords with Your Majesty’s decree. Though I dared not presume to retain them long, I could not bear to part with them at once. The tracing I had begun remains unfinished. Since the courier must depart now, and the paper lanes are already prepared, and as there are many other miscellaneous texts without further use, I shall await their completion and return them all together.\n\nThese writings are of the *pianzhang* style. Though I have not yet distinguished their forms, I may yet study and practice them. I only wish for finely written texts, such as the *Yue Yi Lun* or *Tai Shi Zhen*, to copy and preserve for posterity—recording only their essentials.\n\n**Further Response to Your Majesty’s Edict**\nI have also reviewed Your Majesty’s separate note, which states that such matters should be subtly recorded, for this appreciation is a noble pursuit, and oral instruction is not to be dismissed. Though this is not my usual practice, I venture a brief attempt.\n\nWhen the brush is held askew, the strokes lack sharpness. When the grip is too loose, the writing becomes weak. Short dots and strokes produce a bloated form; long ones, a torn and scattered effect. If horizontal strokes are too compressed, the character tilts; if too sparse, the shape slackens. Constraint yields stiffness, while excess freedom lacks structure—pure bone without charm, pure flesh without strength. Too little ink makes the brush float and hesitate; too much, the strokes grow dull and sluggish. All these arise naturally from the hand’s movement.\n\nYet when modulation is apt and intent unerring, when the brush connects and severs with purpose, when it surges like waves and bends like joints, conforming to compass and square—when strokes descend in measured weight, their thickness and thinness balanced, their plumpness and leanness harmonized, their strength proportioned—then the writing appears gentle yet radiant, endlessly pleasing to the eye. Its edges sharp and its presence imposing, it seems alive. When it delights both eye and heart, it ranks among the finest. Even if one recognizes the styles of many masters, one must still grasp their underlying principles.\n\nThe Six Scripts may be mastered, but this too comes only through practice. Some can retain what they hear once; others, what they see once. Such people exist in every age. In the end, all discussion returns to practice. Cheng Miao reformed the script through long use; Zhang Zhi perfected his calligraphy through accumulated study. Only after long use and deep study can one discourse freely.\n\nIn my youth, I never even traced the *tian gan di zhi* on my palm, let alone on paper. To speak of it now is meaningless—it only invites ridicule from my contemporaries and mockery from future generations. Yet I have made bold claims, and reading them now makes my back burn with shame. In this, I have truly piled falsehood upon falsehood. This is but mastery of a single art, not what I would call a noble pursuit. It is but dust upon the heart’s Dao, not what I would call desirelessness.\n\nRegarding the *Yue Yi Lun*, I have long suspected it to be a copy, though I dared not speak lightly. Now that Your Majesty deems it inauthentic, I trust my own judgment has gained some insight. The *Zhen Zan* is overly delicate and weak. That Xu Jingsu’s works were granted permanent provision fills me with awe at Your Majesty’s gracious praise, beyond words.\n\nThough these writings do not follow standard models, their practical application and principle are sound. The fine regular script on the reverse invites repeated admiration. Earlier, in the capital, I obtained a scroll of *feibai* calligraphy, said to be Wang Xizhi’s prized work. Having never seen other examples, I could not verify it, but its power and force struck me as extraordinary. I humbly present it to Your Majesty. Though it serves no use to me, if it might grace Your Majesty’s collection, I would gladly offer it.\n\nOnce, at Ma Cheng’s residence, I saw a volume of Wang Xizhi’s *Zhengshu Catalogue*. Ma said that Wang had transcribed over ten works, including the *Luoshen Fu*, all in the modern style, except for two *Jijiu Zhang* pieces, which retained the tight, fine, and nearly archaic ancient method. Recalling this, I fear they have long since scattered and no longer survive. Ma also said that the inscribed slips from his traveling library were all imitations for the imperial princes and court officials. Recently, I saw three volumes. The first slip was said to be quite old, but I dared not presume to identify it. Such rarities are scarce. If even one or two slips from these three volumes could be included among the traveling library’s examples, it would be most fortunate.\n\nYour Majesty’s decree has now granted the earlier volumes, filling me with awe and trepidation. When I first saw the volumes, they were numbered twenty-three or twenty-four. Delighted by their abundance, I now find the gifted texts have reached two hundred seventy. My astonishment knows no end. The imperial treasury is vast as the sea, not to be drawn by a single ladle. I can only still my heart in gratitude. Altogether, I have now received five volumes, large and small, far beyond what my crude talents deserve. Without Your Majesty’s extraordinary favor, how could I dare hope for such bounty?\n\nBy nature, I am broadly learned but lack precision. Once, I found my own calligraphy unworthy of viewing and aspired to become a scribe or historian. Later, I grew fond of clerical script and envied those who held official posts. I have often said that in the span of a human life, one’s understanding cannot encompass all things. The world is vast, yet we indulge only the five desires—this is truly shameful. I would rather become a talented ghost than a dull immortal, and this remains my conviction.\n\nAt first, I wished to abandon such pursuits, but since the *wuyi* year, state affairs have pressed heavily. My mountain heart grows weary and silent, and I dare not trouble Your Majesty with idle matters. Yet this topic has led me to importune Your Majesty excessively. I prostrate myself, praying that Your Majesty’s sagely compassion will forgive my presumption.\n\nHaving reviewed and distinguished the various manuscripts, I find your discernment truly refined. Whether they differ or align remains uncertain—all hinges on their merits. Two sheets are to be given to the *jishizhong* and *huangmen*: one for Ren Jing’s calligraphy.\n\nExamining the characters sent under Jing’s name, they closely resemble the two sheets in question, yet Jing’s style is eclectic and fluid—this cannot be his work. One must further assess the nuances of brushstrokes, waves, and flourishes to grasp the essence of each master’s art. Such judgment cannot be rushed in the handling of brush and paper; for now, I shall guard my clumsiness and adhere to moderation. Both the copies of Xu Ren’s and Ren Jing’s works, along with the traced versions, are hereby returned. The first scroll (#7) contains miscellaneous pieces, which I have meticulously annotated in a separate note (#8). Fearing my assessment may not be just, I also submit the copies I privately made for Your Majesty’s review.\n\nFor over ten days, my thoughts have been fraught with anxiety, leaving no peace for other matters. Thus, this delay is unseemly, and I await the completion of the remaining tasks. The other entries are of no use, save for the two pieces, *Shuye* and *Weibi*, which adhere to the standard script style. I regret that they are presented as single volumes. Upon examining the scroll numbers, I find them far from few. Your earlier decree mentioned only four volumes, yet this collection appears to have been compiled during the *Yuanjia* era of the Liu-Song. Likely, many were later gathered and lost. Of Wang Xizhi’s renowned works, scarcely a handful survive—*Huangting*, *Exhortation to Advance*, *Portrait Eulogies*, and *The Goddess of the Luo River*—I cannot confirm whether these remain extant.\n\nThe twenty-third fascicle now contains twelve entries on a separate sheet. Of these, only eight are attributed to Wang Xizhi’s hand. The first, *Yue Yi Lun*, is executed with exceptional vigor yet lacks deliberate intent, resulting in several flawed characters. *The Grand Preceptor’s Admonition* and *The Great Odes* are painstakingly rendered but overly constrained, making them suitable only for fans or screens. The remaining five pieces offer little of note.\n\nOne sheet bears Minister Tao’s inscription, but this work is neither graceful nor by Wang Xizhi’s hand. Its provenance is unknown, and it appears to be a tracing. The two sheets for the *jishizhong* and *huangmen*, along with one sheet of *Zhikang Li*, are in Wang Xianzhi’s hand, though they too seem traced. Another sheet, *Ligu Fang*, is also by Wang Xianzhi and likewise a tracing. These four entries are not by Wang Xizhi.\n\nThe twenty-fourth fascicle now contains twenty-one entries, of which only eleven are attributed to Wang Xizhi. None are particularly fitting: many are careless, their strokes lacking refinement, and their elegance diminished, making detailed critique difficult. The first, from the second year of *Huangchu*, is a later imitation of Wang Xizhi’s style. One sheet, *Epitaph for a Tomb*, is by Master Xu; another, *Embracing Hidden Sorrow*, by Zhang Cheng; one dated the eleventh of the fifth month by a traced copy of Wang Min’s work; another, *Still Yearning for the Yellow and Qi*, also traced; one sheet of *Stagnation*; and a full piece, all imitations by others, clumsily executed. One sheet, undated, is by Wang Xianzhi but with altered months; another, dated the fifteenth of the fifth month, by Sun Bai; one sheet of *Zhiqin Fang* by Wang Min; and one by Xie An. These ten entries are not by Wang Xizhi.\n\nFearing Your Majesty may not yet deign to distinguish them, I now submit the calligraphy of Master Xu and Ren Jing for comparison, as outlined separately. From this, one may discern the hands of Wang Min, Zhang Cheng, Zhang Yi, and Xie An—works Your Majesty’s court should possess. Of the Zhong [Yao] and Wang [Xizhi] scrolls, one volume is traditionally deemed authentic, but I suspect all are traced copies, most unworthy of discussion. Only two or three lines faintly capture Zhong’s style. Wang Xizhi’s study of Zhong is evident in nearly twenty pieces. The rest, with their fine strokes and short lines, largely follow Zhong’s method.\n\nI wish to have them mounted, but it is not yet convenient to deliver them. By next month, when the task is complete, I shall send them. Upon reviewing Your Majesty’s instructions, though the initial intent was limited to twelve pieces, the standards and judgments are comprehensive. Even if later works do not exceed two hundred, their praise and censure are fully encompassed—a single word suffices to capture the essence of calligraphy. This would instantly bestow new honor upon the aged bones of Zhong [Yao], while Wang Xianzhi’s delicate flesh would pale beside the night’s darkness. Only Wang Xizhi’s work allows for measured critique, revealing the jade-like purity of his art. Without Your Majesty’s sagely discernment in appraisal, the trend of favoring recent imitations may lead to eternal confusion.\n\nZhang Zhi is hailed as the sage of cursive script, and Zhong [Yao] himself is unmatched in clerical script. As the saying goes, their art shares a single mechanism—a divine treasure unmatched across ages. With this principle clarified, those who merely mimic the tiger should lay down their brushes at once. Returning to antiquity and restoring authenticity will truly herald a flourishing era.\n\nMy humble insights, though presumptuous, have been shared with joy and admiration beyond measure. The world now esteems Wang Xianzhi, while Zhong [Yao]’s legacy, though equal in the Qi and Liang dynasties, has faded in reputation. Not only is Zhong no longer recognized, but Wang Xizhi’s standing has also suffered. This is not a matter of rejection or dismissal but of being stained without purification—scarcely a few lineages remain. Now, upon receiving this discourse, I leap and dance with excitement, though it scarcely vents my fervor. I wish to privately show the traced copies to Hong Yuan and Si Kuang. These two are men of balanced judgment; they would surely leap with admiration, gaining more than half the benefit.\n\nThough I do not know Hong Yuan personally, through my nephew Xu, we have corresponded and met. However, as he serves in the palace, he may have already heard of this. The size of the characters in the traced copies is unsuitable, but if Guo Jun were to adjust them, they might still suffice—though the brushwork’s intent may differ greatly. This work will be transmitted for a thousand generations, so the traces should follow accordingly.\n\nOf the three sheets I present, upon examining the brushwork, I find them remarkably vigorous and precise. I fear that once words express intent, intent must align with words, and the heart must guide the hand and brush in harmony—only then can true accord be achieved. I humbly rejoice in this.\n\nAdmiration for the treasured gifts grows ever deeper. As the world universally declares, the traces of Zhong [You] no longer exist in Jiangdong. I have long regretted this, cherishing only the distant hope that when the Central Plains are pacified, the stele of Taiqiu might be traced and studied. Now, however, the imperial decree states that though authentic traces are few, they may yet be inferred. This suggests some still remain—though I know not how many characters survive. Since I cannot view them in person, I dare presume to request that skilled artisans trace and fill several lines. Should I be so fortunate as to receive them, it would be an undeserved blessing.\n\nMoreover, when [Wang] Yishao studied under Zhong [You], his technique—subtle in movement, dense in form—surpassed his own spontaneous brushwork. I wonder how many sheets of such examples remain. The decree further mentions that works like the *Huangting Xiang Zan* may yet be provided. As for his spontaneous brushwork, I no longer dare hope. I only beg to study Zhong’s marvels, humbly awaiting this singular grace.\n\nAdditionally, before Yishao assumed office in Wuxing, his calligraphy had yet to earn acclaim. All his finest works—those he cherished and advanced—date to his time in Kuaiji, roughly the decade of Yonghe. After resigning his post and withdrawing from service upon the death of his elder, he scarcely wrote again himself, entrusting all to a single scribe. Yet the world could not distinguish their hands—how strange! In his later years, after Yishao’s death, his son Zijing, then seventeen or eighteen, imitated this scribe’s style so perfectly that their scripts became indistinguishable. Now, by the imperial decree’s illumination, all may suddenly recognize Yishao’s late work.\n\nAs for the criticism of Ruan Yan’s calligraphy in his later years, I recently heard of someone who studied Yan’s script so closely that their hands could no longer be told apart. Among the works I obtained through Guo’s tracing, though the character forms are roughly rendered, the brushwork’s intent and momentum are lost. I wonder if among the previous scrolls, one or two meticulously executed examples might be included in the set to be mounted.\n\nAgain, I am deeply moved by the imperial grace extended to the end of the year. This favor descends from heaven; I merely report what I have ascertained, without presumption or desire. *Emperor Wu’s Rescript in Reply to the Presentation of the* Xuantong Ji:\n\nHaving reviewed the memorial and examined the authentic words of Zhou’s relics, their evident verification of earlier prophecies is all the more wondrous. The four scrolls are now retained. The profound texts are fully recorded in part, with only added praise and admiration. Twentieth day of the twelfth month.\n\n*Memorial Presenting Zhou’s* Xuantong Ji *by the Recluse:*\n\nYour servant respectfully reports: In the final days of the tenth month, Zhou’s affair suddenly arose. As I was then observing purification rites, I could not immediately memorialize it. Now, I have meticulously compiled the events into four scrolls, which I present separately. Yet I, having lingered in doubt like a fish in a net, failed to believe and awaken sooner. In remorse and sorrow, I deserve severe censure. The profound texts are orally recounted in full. I humbly pray for leniency toward my negligence. I prostrate myself in submission.\n\n*End of the First Scroll of the* Maoshan Annals.\n\n---\n\n*Preface to the* Maoshan Annals:\n\nIn the first year of Huangqing, an imperial edict bestowed upon Liu Dabin, the forty-fifth patriarch of Maoshan, the title *True Man of Subtle and Mysterious Responses in the Grotto’s Observation*. Five years later, the Three Mao Lords were honored with additional two-character epithets: *True Response*, *Marvelous Response*, and *Divine Response*. The three peaks were consecrated as abbeys: *Sacred Protection*, *Virtue’s Protection*, and *Benevolent Protection*. The following year, the jade seal of the altar, long lost, resurfaced. The authorities reported the matter, and an imperial decree elevated the mountain’s status.\n\nThereupon, imperial favor deepened, auspicious omens flourished, and harmony prevailed between gods and men. All recorded structures—every dilapidated hall or pavilion in need of repair—were entrusted to the patriarch’s care. Yet I lamented that the mountain’s annals, though begun, remained unfinished. Thus, I charged my disciples to gather materials and compile a complete record, later inviting me to compose a preface. Reviewing its contents, I find the imperial decrees’ grandeur, the immortals’ marvels, the grottoes’ profundity, the altar records’ transmission, the figures’ greatness, the towers’ splendor, the mountains and waters’ purity, the flora’s elegance, the steles’ inscriptions, and the verses’ artistry—all meticulously categorized and fully presented.\n\nMaoshan, originally called Juqu Mountain, is the eighth of the *Cave Heavens of Huayang* and the foremost of the *Earthly Blessings’ Lungs*. The Mao brothers of Han retired here to cultivate the Dao, and the mountain took their name. By the Jin and Wei dynasties, the Yuan Lady greatly expanded its legacy. The immortal winds and numinous traces flowed unbroken, making it a renowned mountain and sacred realm under heaven.\n\nThe imperial Yuan dynasty esteems clarity and stillness. Since the land was submitted to the Bureau of Geography, the masters of its altars have been summoned to court, honored with imperial rescripts and golden charters. The teachings flourished under the patriarch, who received grace surpassing all predecessors. Ah, how splendid! For the mountain’s *qi* unfolds in times of peace, and after long ages, the patriarch’s Dao likewise ascends to imperial notice. Herein lies the marvel of silent communion.\n\nThus, the mountain’s annals must be compiled, and this work cannot lack a preface. Formerly, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang inquired of Li Xuanjing about governance and transformation. Xuanjing replied: *The* Daodejing *is the sovereign’s teacher.* Emperor Wen of Han practiced its teachings, bringing benevolence and longevity to the realm. He later consulted on the golden tripod, saying: *The* Daode *is public; light ascension is private.* May later generations embody Xuanjing’s noble words and follow the patriarch’s sincere devotion.\n\nMay this then bring forth auspicious responses, and thus the annals may be perpetuated alongside this mountain for endless ages.\n\nComposed on the Winter Solstice of the *jiazi* year in the Taiding era by Grand Academician of the Jixian Institute and Grand Master for Glorious Happiness Zhao Shiyan of Western Qin.\n\nWhen the august Yuan first took the realm, it first honored the Dao of clarity and quiescence to lay the foundation of great peace. Thus, those beyond the world—court servants of the sacred altars—were specially favored with imperial appointment, their grace and radiance illuminating the mountains and forests. If these were not recorded in a completed work, how could later generations examine and witness them? Reflecting on my own words, I realize this famous mountain truly deserves to be heard.\n\nIn the *gengxu* year of the Zhida era, I came to Mount Mao for sacrificial rites. There, I perused the mountain’s old annals and found many omissions and gaps. I once mentioned this to the forty-fourth-generation patriarch, Master Wang of Muchen, but before long, the master transmitted his truth, and the mountain’s annals remained unheard. Five years later, I returned to the mountain for rites and again spoke of this to the succeeding patriarch, Master Liu. Thirteen years passed, and in the *bingyin* year of the Taiding era, the Son of Heaven, following ancient precedent, performed a jiao ritual for the mountain. I was appointed to officiate the rites and at last beheld the completed work. In fifteen scrolls, it gathered writings from the Han and Jin down through the Qi, Liang, Tang, and Song without omission. Ah, how thorough it is!\n\nIts first chapter, \"Edicts and Inscriptions,\" contains the imperial decrees conferring titles upon the Three Perfected Lords of our dynasty, along with the calligraphic plaques bestowed upon Three Peaks Abbey—all documents I had memorialized and requested. Its final chapter, \"Miscellaneous Writings,\" records the full account of Benevolent Emperor Renzong’s restoration of the jade seal, as originally memorialized by the late Grand Master Zhang. Alas! This work took twenty years to complete—did the immortals truly await something? If not, then the dynasty’s extraordinary favors—bestowals of titles, plaques, and the return of the jade seal—would have been left to fill gaps after the work’s completion, and its authors would have no regrets.\n\nMinister Zhao having already composed a preface, I commend this work for its transmission’s benefit to the Dao. My words, which urged its completion, were not in vain, and so I write this afterword.\n\nComposed in the first month of spring in the *dingmao* year of the Taiding era by Grand Master of the Mysterious Teachings and Supreme Minister Wu Quanjie.\n\n**Preface to the Annals of Mount Mao**\n\nThe records of Mount Gouqu are ancient indeed.\n\nIn the twentieth year of the Shaoxing era of the Song, Zeng Xun of Nanfeng, styled Zhongzhao, and the Daoist Fu Xiaozian of Taidao Abbey compiled a four-fascicle *Record of Mount Mao*. Their work merely listed the names of mountains, waters, temples, and shrines, with scant attention to historical inquiry or narrative. Only after a full twelve-year cycle since Dabin’s ascent to the altar did he finally complete the compilation and verification of the lineage’s scriptures and records, taking another five years to bring the work to fruition.\n\nThis book, titled *Annals of Mount Mao*, comprises twelve sections in fifteen fascicles. It chronicles the numinous efficacy of this mountain, which from the dawn of creation has stood apart, responding to emperors from beyond the void. Yu the Great of Xia once visited; the First Emperor of Qin ascended its heights. In the second year of Yuanshou of the Han, the Supreme Thearch bestowed the Nine Gifts upon Lord Mao, who ascended as an immortal in broad daylight—his name thus resounded throughout the realm. By the Jin and Song dynasties, the flourishing of the Dao saw the Liang and Tang courts hold it in profound reverence. Perfected Ones and Daoists generation after generation served as teachers to emperors, their dragon-script and phoenix-characters accumulating like clouds and mist. Yet alas, the ages have grown distant, and imperial seals are rarely preserved. What remains is but a fraction of what was once seen and heard.\n\nUnder our August Yuan, the realm was unified. Through the sagely virtue and divine merit of Emperor Shizu, the Martial Emperor first issued the *Mingzhao* edict. He summoned the lineage’s successor, Master Jiang Zongying, to the court. Thus, successive dynasties have greatly protected this teaching. In the third year of the Yanyou era, the Three Lords were granted honorific titles, and the Three Peaks were renamed, their glory outshining all antiquity. That the sage employs the divine Dao to establish teaching has ever been thus.\n\nThe first section, *Decrees and Inscriptions*, records the imperial edicts of investiture, which proclaim: “The numen of this mountain takes its name from its surname. The true heirs of the Mao Lords—let their transmission be recorded first.” Following the example of *The Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection and the True Transmission*, the sagely Dao Lords are titled “Records,” while other Perfected Ones are titled “Transmissions.” How could the Three Mao Lords of Qin and Han, whose sagely traces are revered by scholars today, be merely called “Transmissions”? Thus, the second section is titled *Records of the Three Divinities*.\n\nJintan’s Huayang Grotto-Heaven, the Earthly Lung of Jinling, and the Blessed Land of Tongxiang—these are the “blessed realms for nurturing perfection” and “numinous ruins for attaining divinity” spoken of by the Perfected One of Tongxiang. Their legacy endures for a hundred generations. Collecting the mountains, waters, and grottoes, the third section is titled *Compendium of the Numinous Realm*.\n\nFrom Lord Wang’s admonition about “dust rising from the sea” to Lord Hua’s words on “the marker post leaving home,” we know that immortals and sages traversing the mortal world have often marveled at the changes between ancient and modern. Yet the traces of the mysterious Dao, unlike the shifting hills and valleys, are few indeed. Thus, the fourth section is titled *Traces of Antiquity Verified*.\n\nThe teachings of the Shangqing scriptures were first transmitted to the world in the second year of Xingning of the Jin, when the Purple Void’s Lady Wei descended to the residence of Yang Jun, a clerk in the household of Wang Fangzhi of Langye. She transcribed them in clerical script and passed them to Xu Jun, the Chief Clerk of the Protectorate, and his son. Their charts and records were secret, transmitted only after oaths and prostration. Here, their chapter titles are outlined so that students of the true may glimpse their essence. Treatises and discussions are appended to the left. Thus, the fifth section is titled *Register of the Daoist Mountain*.\n\nFrom the Primordial Beginning, seven transmissions reached the Purple Void. From the Purple Void to the present spans forty-five generations. If the recipient is unworthy, the Dao does not flow in vain. As Liu Zhi of Hedong once said: “The Huayang of the Daoist gate is like the Ruist streams of the Yi and Si.” Thus, the sixth section is titled *Lineages of the Shangqing*.\n\nLiu Xiang said: “Heaven has its divine overseers; immortals fill its ranks.”\n\nThe celestial bureaucracy of the Grotto Palaces derives from the *True Reports* and *Records of Mystic Communication*. As the cycles of time shift, appointments and promotions must follow. Like the rites of Zhou and the institutions of Han, they no longer remain the same. The divine Dao is profound and distant, beyond the ken of the worldly. Thus, the seventh section is titled *Register of the Immortal Offices*.\n\nThe mountain’s sources wind deep and hold space; reclusive scholars of lofty aspiration dwell in their recesses, their traces too scattered to chronicle. Here are gathered the most luminous exemplars of transcendent conduct from antiquity and the present. As for those who vanish in stillness, ascending unseen with the dawn’s light—how could their names be recorded? Thus, the eighth section is titled *Wanderings in the Harvest of Truth*.\n\nFrom the Wei and Jin through the Six Dynasties, they wove the realm’s fabric, dwelling dispersed among forests and foothills. Only in the Tang and Song did the flourishing of temples and monasteries begin, where rites of offering and blessing were observed—this is their ground. Thus, the ninth section is titled *Records of the Louguan Lineage*.\n\nCinnabar and treasured qi, gold and jade’s radiant essence: those who ingest them extend their years and transform their substance. Their nurturing moisture, accumulated over time, emerges in mushrooms, herbs, and trees—wondrous, numinous, and enduring in truth, for such is the inherent principle of things. Thus, the tenth section is titled *Catalogue of Numinous Flora*.\n\nSteles, inscriptions, and carved texts are the vessels and chariots of the Dao. The brushstrokes of perfected beings remain as models for emulation. For those who establish virtue, merit, or words, is not their legacy preserved herein? Thus, the eleventh section is titled *Record of Metal and Stone*.\n\nThe ancients collected poems to uphold the teachings of names and propriety. Verses composed in the mountains, though scattered and lost in great number, are all exquisite and fine phrases, worthy to adorn the end of soaring celestial hymns. Thus, the twelfth section is titled *Golden Lotus Anthology*.\n\nHere ends the compilation. In crafting this record, no distinction is made between past and present; every deed and every word is included for its utmost excellence. If accounts are distorted or compositions coarse and flawed—like the finger pointing at Huan—such entries are entirely omitted, not by oversight.\n\nAlas! The Grand Historian extolled the famous mountains of the world; the *Nanhua* lauded the vast and true perfected ones. Yet Mount Gouqu combines both virtues, its illustrious radiance compiled over a thousand and hundreds of years—never has there been such splendor. May later scholars not disparage their dwelling, nor weary of their origins, whether great or small. Let all take purity and stillness as their foundation; surely this text bears witness to such principles.\n\nIn the first year of the Tianli era of the Great Yuan, the year *wuchen* of the sexagenary cycle, the second day of the twelfth month. By the forty-fifth generational lineage-holder of the *Shangqing* scriptural transmission, the Perfected of Subtle Mystery and Wondrous Response of the Grotto Vision, Liu Dabin.\n\n*Records of Mount Mao*, Scroll Two. Composed by Liu Dabin, lineage-holder of the *Shangqing* tradition.\n\nDecree to Vice-Scribe\nTang Emperor Shao’s Decree to Master of the Dharma Wang\nMaster, your conduct is unadorned and simple, your virtue and practice pure and profound. You have cast aside worldly distractions, dwelling your mind in emptiness and mystery. Exhaling the old and inhaling the new, you feed on fungi and herbs. You gather the myriad wonders beyond the Three Clarities, restoring youthful radiance beyond a hundred years. Your Dao surpasses the achievements of the ancients, your renown resounds through the ages. Had you not received secret instructions upon the Golden Altar and received hidden texts upon the Jade Summit, how could you have attained such heights?\n\nWhen I was still a prince, I early heard of your Way, and your long-held model has never faded from my waking or dreaming thoughts. Recently, upon reading your memorial requesting return to your native mountains, I have issued a separate edict honoring your lofty aspirations. I have also granted permission to establish an abbey and erect a stele, though your long-cherished wish remains unfulfilled. When, Master, will you arrive? The buildings you have commissioned beyond the Yangzi—when will they be completed? I await word in eager anticipation, longing to hear the details that will fulfill this yearning. I have already dispatched the Grand Astrologer Yin Yi to convey my intentions.\n\nIn the ninth year of the Zhenguan era, this matter is recorded in the *Old Tang History* biography.\n\nDecree from Gaozong to Master of the Dharma Wang\nThe late Daoist Wang Yuanzhi of the Jade Purity Abbey, by nature subtle in his traces, pursued the profound and mysterious. Embodying this liberation from worldly bonds, he was hailed as a forerunner of enlightenment. From the earliest foundations of his cultivation to the dawn of his radiant glory...\n\nThe gracious favor bestowed was resplendent in imperial decrees. Though his immortal transformation cannot be recalled, his radiant spirit grows ever more distant. In cherishing memory of the departed crow, fitting honors must be conferred. Let him be posthumously appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, with the posthumous title \"Master Ascended to Perfection.\" Let the relevant authorities carry this out.\n\nOn the seventh day of the second month in the second year of the Tiaolu era.\n\nBy imperial edict, the Daoist priests of Taiping Abbey in Runzhou shall follow the precedent of the Seven Temples, with a full ordination quota of forty-nine. Should vacancies arise thereafter, they shall be promptly filled through selection and reported accordingly.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the second month in the second year of the Tiaolu era.\n\nDecree from Empress Wu on the Posthumous Honors for Master of the Dharma Wang\n\nAlas! When Wang Qiao ascended as an immortal, he lingered at his old shrine; when Zheng Kangcheng’s Dao endured, it still extended within his former abode. How much more so for one whose traces were recorded in the immortal registers, whose name graced the sagely court—when we recall his departed dust, our distant longing deepens.\n\nThe late Daoist of Jade Purity Abbey, posthumously appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness and Master Ascended to Perfection, Wang Yuanzhi, was by nature in harmony with the Dao, his spirit roaming through transformations. From the outset, he plumbed the subtleties of the imperial apocrypha, attaining the principle of Heaven’s spontaneity. Across three reigns, he concealed his esoteric arts to conceal his brilliance; surpassing a century, he witnessed the unfolding of the sagely enterprise. Concealing the past and knowing the future, he discerned the obscure and perceived the distant. Repeatedly, he received the profound grace of former emperors, and the favor of posthumous honors. Now, to extend the mandate of later generations, it is fitting to elevate the rites of commemoration. Let him be posthumously appointed Grand Master of the Palace with Gold and Purple, with the posthumous title \"Master Ascended to Mystery.\" All else remains as before. Let the relevant authorities carry this out.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of the first month in the first year of the Sisheng era.\n\nTwenty-four Edicts from Emperor Xuanzong to Master Li Xuanjing\n\nEdict to Lin Yang, Governor of Danyang Commandery, and to the Daoist and lay elders and common people:\n\nWe have long revered the profound and wondrous, ever contemplating the numinous immortals. In cherishing this Mount Mao, we recognize it as a celestial cavern. The jade altars of its ancient abbeys remain in vestige, yet the essential scriptures of the Dao lie scattered, nearly lost. Reflecting on these sacred treasures, We are deeply moved. Now, for the sake of the people, We greatly exalt the root of the Dao. Thus, We have commanded the pure and cultivated to establish true rites, to seek the nearby numinous mountain, and to renew the abbey’s halls. May this allow the profound teachings to flourish anew, that all may know where to turn in reverence. May blessings descend upon the realm, bringing benevolence and longevity.\n\nMoreover, in recent years, We have consistently appointed officials of purity and tranquility, who have governed with excellence, while agriculture and sericulture have coincided with seasons of abundance. Among the people, none have suffered want.\n\nWe trust that you, the governor, along with the Daoist and lay elders and common people, are all in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of Our thoughts.\n\nEdict to Dong Gui, Inspector of Jiangdong Circuit and Governor of Jinling Commandery:\n\nThe mountains and peaks above divide the heavens, while below they stabilize the regions. They bestow blessings upon the people and dispense the grace of clouds and rain. Moreover, Mount Mao, with its divine splendor, is the Huayang Grotto-Heaven, the source of the Dharma’s teachings and the dwelling of perfected immortals. Though the rites of reverence are established, the heart of devotion should ever deepen in purity. Henceforth, within Mount Mao, let all logging, hunting, and fishing be prohibited. Let those from afar who consume meat and blood not be permitted entry. Should there be occasions for rituals, petitions, or prayers, let them be conducted with incense, herbs, and precious offerings—never with sacrificial animals. You and your subordinates must attend to this with care.\n\nWe trust you are in good health.\n\nEdict to the Perfected of Guangling, Li the Master of Refinement:\n\nYou are a person of the Upper Clarity rank, your aspirations soaring with the clouds and mist, harmonizing with the world while transcending it. For Our sake, you cultivate blessings, soon to ascend the Golden Altar. Thus, We compose a poem to honor your journey and praise your resolve:\n\nA scholar of the Purple Palace’s mist and haze,\nA master of the Dao’s profound Way.\nYour heart unites with the myriad sounds,\nYour will aligns with the Nine Immortals’ vow.\nBeyond the world, you leave the dust behind,\nWith kindred spirits, you delight in aiding the age.\nSeeking scriptures, you wander jade grottoes,\nExpounding teachings, you enter the jeweled steps.\nAt Mao Ridge, you follow the traces of the ancients,\nAt the Golden Altar, you fulfill distant thoughts.\nIn the Yin Palace, you peruse old records,\nIn the Yang Abbey, you adorn the new shrine.\nFrom afar, We recall the buried twin jades,\nEver cherishing the gathering of the five sacred herbs.\nIf the true immortals may be encountered,\nWe await the startling crane’s arrival here.\n\nHonored Master, you embrace the One and guard the center, exploring the subtle and illuminating the distant. Your purity and integrity have unfolded the gates of the Dao, uniting with the Great Harmony. As a patriarch of the immortal lineage, you have inspired Our reverence, adorning the numinous precincts and broadly seeking the true scriptures. Thus, We compose this poem to honor your journey, conveying Our profound regard. May it console you on the road and manifest Our esteem for the worthy.\n\nYou are aware of Our intent.\n\nEdict to Master of Refinement Li Hanguang:\n\nYour Dao is lofty as the Purple Palace, your learning encompasses the Yellow Court. Nobly, you have come at Our summons, unfolding the most wondrous teachings. Now, you turn your thoughts to Mao Ridge, seeking the true scriptures. Recently, you journeyed from the capital of Qin, venturing far beyond the world. We have long cherished the immortal realms, eagerly awaiting your diligent cultivation. May this allow the people of the Nine Provinces to together return to the profound teachings, and the hosts of the Three Clarities to look down and witness their observance. This is not merely dreaming of the land of Huaxu or directing Our sincerity toward the azure heavens. We imagine you, Honored Master, establishing the true rites, constructing the altar halls—from your first arrival to the completion of the structures—expending great effort. We trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of Our thoughts.\n\nEdict to Master of Refinement Li Hanguang:\n\nYesterday, Cheng Yuanxian arrived and presented the plans you submitted, which clearly outline the regulations. However, in adorning the immortal abbey and invoking the presence of the perfected, if the site is not secluded and tranquil, how could the rainbow robes and feathered canopies descend? Moreover, in the rituals, there are distinctions in rank. As for the perfected immortals and Daoist assembly, they must not reside together within the same precincts as the Purple Yang Abbey’s grand courtyard. No one should be permitted to dwell there. Instead, construct an open colonnade enclosing a purified hall to maintain the incense offerings and await the cloud-borne chariots. The Daoist assembly shall be accommodated in separate quarters.\n\nWe have now provided a detailed diagram, which should guide any necessary additions, and the requisite materials have been allocated. Honored Master, your embodiment of the true and your far-reaching insight, your harmonious nature inwardly refined, must surely align with the hearts of the numinous immortals above and fulfill the reverent intentions below. We trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of Our thoughts.\n\nEdict to Master of Refinement Li Hanguang:\n\nHonored Master, you have traveled far to renowned mountains, diligently seeking the supreme teachings. You have established altars and halls, transcribing the true scriptures.\n\nMay your diligent efforts in all matters bring you weariness indeed. My aspiration to seek the essentials of the Dao and my distant longing for the true immortals shall rely upon your pure sincerity to cultivate the profound and wondrous. On the eighteenth day of this month, I shall purify myself in fasting and sanctify the altar to receive the scriptural decrees, praying for the descent of the numinous immortals’ blessings and their attestation.\n\nI now send the prayer texts and incense offerings with this letter. Honored Master, you must proclaim the ritual observances, present the prayers, and offer thanks, that they may ascend to the immortal palaces above and bring forth manifest responses below. The weather grows warm. I trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\nAdmonition to Refiner Li:\nThe Dao is the origin of all existence, and the Dharma is the covenant of the Nine Perfected. The Great Sage bequeathed these teachings to later disciples, that those who cultivate themselves might advance. I have long wished to reverently receive the scriptural Dharma but have not yet fully grasped its solemn mysteries. Moreover, many of the true scriptures have scattered and fallen into error. Recently, I sought out the vestiges left by the Heavenly Perfected, and in their rituals and observances, nothing was lacking. I have had them transcribed in strict accordance with the precepts. My long-held aspiration is now fulfilled, and I am grateful for the descent of the true numinous ones’ grace.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of this month, I shall reverently invoke the Three Pure Ones, the Grand Master, the Mystic Master, and the True Master, purifying myself in fasting to receive the sacred texts. Bearing the true scriptures, I shall reverently unfold the phoenix-script, directing my heart toward the realm of the Great Void to nurture the longevity of the Valley Spirit. The fragrant offerings have been prepared in full accordance with the scriptural traditions. I now enclose the prayer texts and seal them for dispatch. Honored Master, your mastery of the Dao’s essentials and your harmonious radiance, your purity and effortless virtue, align with my own aspirations. I entreat you, as my master, to present these prayer texts and fragrant offerings at the Golden Altar of the Numinous Treasury in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven of Mount Mao, as a token of sincerity to attest to my diligent devotion.\n\nThose of virtue are honored with noble titles. Thus, Ge Hong bore the appellation \"Master of Embracing Simplicity,\" and Tao Hongjing was known as \"Master of Integrity and Purity.\" The deeds of those who came before are not distant. Henceforth, I bestow upon you the title \"Master of Mystic Stillness,\" to illuminate your illustrious virtue and exalt your lofty conduct. I now dispatch an emissary for this purpose. The weather grows warm. I trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\nHonored Master, your harmonious virtue and your exploration of its essentials have led you to personally safeguard the fragrant offerings and invoke the true numinous ones. Moreover, the bestowal of this title serves to honor your diligent cultivation. The robes are a means to express reverence and devotion, a form to manifest veneration and to praise the beauty of the immortal ranks. I am grateful for your understanding.\n\nThe lingzhi you presented is indeed an auspicious sign. Like multicolored clouds spreading abundantly, its fragrance rivals that of orchids, flourishing in the blessed land of Ziyang. It is a propitious omen of the ascent of cinnabar sincerity, distantly resonating with the great jade lingzhi of Datong, forming a harmonious correspondence. The true immortals above have bestowed this felicitous sign in response to your pure sincerity. I am deeply gratified.\n\nI now command that prayer texts and incense be offered at the Heavenly Grotto, entrusting your lofty virtue to convey my devout heart. The lingzhi arises from harmonious qi and is overseen by the true immortals. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor’s attainment of the Dao was marked by the repeated blossoming of the Three Wonders. I have long pondered these auspicious omens. Today, the golden radiance and vermilion hues of eighty-one stalks, their colors resonant with the golden square and their number aligned with the yang auspices, some with conjoined stems and paired calyxes, others with twin roots sharing a single branch, emerge from the Heavenly Grotto to flourish, adorning the medicinal altar with their splendor. This is a rare and wondrous occurrence, evoking profound gratitude for such extraordinary auspices.\n\nHonored Master, having presented your prayers and conveyed your sincerity, you have sent these true gifts from afar. I receive them with reverence. May great fortune attend, and may I partake of them. The weather is hot. I trust you are well.\n\nEdict:\nLonging for antiquity, I reflect upon the immortal precincts adjoining the grotto-palaces, the ancient abodes of the blue altars, and the numinous borders. The new halls of the Purple Terrace now gleam, revealing the true lineage. To manifest my reverent devotion, I have established households for repair and maintenance. Honored Masters, you have fulfilled my intentions with your pure and precious observances.\n\nEdict:\nThe weight of your virtue, Honored Master, is esteemed by the immortal perfected. Thus, the purification rites must be met with profound sincerity. Moreover, this mountain is the lung of the earth, where the blessings of the Controller of Destinies converge. Its courtyard altars lie near the heavenly palaces, the former abodes of the true persons. I, your disciple, am diligent in my aspirations to extend the realm of longevity to all living beings. Gazing eastward from afar, I yearn for you day and night. With the arrival of spring, I await the return of your wind-borne chariot to ease my longing for your wisdom and to receive the profound teachings of the Dao.\n\nThe autumn heat lingers. I trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\nEdict:\nThe alchemical furnace opens the immortal elixir, transmitted by the Nine Perfected. The courtyard yields lingzhi, overseen by the Three Maos. Such omens, recorded in the mysterious annals, have never before been heard. Only Wei Boyang foretold them in the past. Now, Li Yue has brought them to fruition here. I shall purify my heart and await the arrival of a special emissary to welcome you, that we may together receive the Dao’s blessings. I am grateful for your understanding.\n\nEdict:\nI have always revered purity and truth, personally seeking those of the Dao. My sincere request is difficult to refuse, so I have allowed you to fulfill your wishes and seek medical treatment. Now that your recovery is well underway, you should return soon.\n\n*Poem to Send Off Master of Mystic Stillness on His Temporary Return to Guangling, with Preface*\n\nMaster of Mystic Stillness embodies harmonious purity and delights in the Dao’s emptiness. Recently, he came to the capital, bringing blessings to all. Now, he yearns for the forests and springs, to cleanse his heart of worldly dust. I admire and esteem him, and to fulfill his wishes, I compose this poem to honor his departure, reflecting on his journey:\n\nYang and Xu opened the true records,\nWhile you, sir, secretly transmitted the covenant.\nNine stars linked beneath the purple canopy,\nTwin radiance merged in the cinnabar field.\nHolding the jade tablet, you serve at the Tortoise Terrace,\nA golden altar immortal of the grotto-palace.\nI still await the ease of riding the wind,\nMorning and evening, to welcome your cool return.\n\nRespectfully inquiring of Master of Mystic Stillness:\nMaster, you uphold the purity of unsullied integrity and possess the inner harmony that penetrates all principles. Your learning encompasses the nine schools, yet you transcend them in profound silence. Your heart roams the Eight Effulgences, ever blending with the light of the world. Your secret conduct and lofty virtue are truly admirable. Yet you have humbled your solitary resolve to broadly propagate the Way of salvation. Following the true blessings, you have deeply nurtured the pure source. I am aware that your past and present meritorious deeds have all evoked responses. Gazing southeast, my heart races toward you day and night.\n\nI now send offerings and fragrant jujubes. Honored Master, I entreat you to perform the ninefold meritorious rites.\n\nMay it thus enable all living beings to receive the blessings of daily sustenance, and may those beyond the realm turn their hearts toward submission. May the world know peace, sheltered only by the Dao. Once the meritorious rites are completed, you shall momentarily ascend upon the wind’s chariot. I have learned that upon your arrival in the capital, the cold was severe. Since Master Qingchang’s return from Master Tang, I have sent letters, though they have not conveyed much.\n\nThe rituals of fasting and offering possess established models; to ensure sincerest devotion, they must rely on meticulous practice. Thus, I humbly entreat Your Reverence to undertake this sacred task. Knowing that your affairs will soon conclude, I am deeply grateful. I acknowledge your understanding.\n\nMay Your Reverence’s thoughts grow ever more refined, your heart ever more reverent in fasting and purity. In bestowing blessings and benefiting all things, your merit is truly vast. Moreover, in selecting the most eminent among the virtuous to join in diligent pursuit of the supreme Dao—persisting in refinement without cease—your praise deepens.\n\nThese fragrant offerings serve to manifest my sincerity. Through the wondrous efficacy of the supreme Dao and the purity of your devotion, you have summoned the response of the true. You have extended blessings to my person, bringing tranquility to the realm. As the winter solstice approaches, may auspicious omens arrive. The felicity of the new year’s beginning shall be shared by all.\n\nI await your arrival next spring at [omitted character], where we shall meet again. I respectfully inquire of Master of Mystic Stillness: recently, your disciple Tang Ruoqian arrived and informed me that on the eleventh day of last month, the meritorious rites were completed. With a heart of utmost sincerity and the resonance of refined practice, the altar stood in a realm of immortals, duly following the esoteric canons. Below, it sheltered all living beings; above, it aided the ancestral temples. In perpetually seeking blessed responses, the profound resonance was manifest. I have also learned that heaven and earth are in perfect harmony, and gods and humans alike rejoice. Sweet dew descended, marking the auspicious sign. Thus, in observing the omens of your steps, all returns to primordial felicity.\n\nThis year’s celestial cycles proclaim: *\"The turning of the jade celestial sphere proceeds without flaw; twice have the people been wearied by affairs.\"* I now send fragrant offerings and request that, by year’s end, Your Reverence perform meritorious rites at your residence to assist in welcoming the new year. When spring returns next year, I shall again invite Your Reverence to Mount Mao to conduct the grand *Hetu* fast for the ancestral temples above and the common people below. The offerings for these karmic merits shall renew and recreate. Though the labor is not slight, the benefits are vast.\n\nMoreover, as the Dao and virtue draw close, our qi and dispositions align in perfect resonance. The sacred traces across these mountains abound with transcendent beings. Should any seek to visit them, Your Reverence must summon them for your disciples.\n\nThe cold is severe; may Your Reverence’s Dao-body remain peaceful and harmonious. When Tang Ruoqian returns, I send this letter with but brief words.\n\nYour Reverence upholds the true cultivation of the Highest Clarity above and propagates the teachings of immortality below, securing blessings for me and sheltering the common people. The esoteric scriptures of the Three Sovereigns have already borne auspicious responses. The inner records of the *Hetu* entreat the prolongation of fortune and felicity. My reverent heart reaches afar toward Mount Mao.\n\nThe modest gifts I send can hardly repay your diligent labors. As spring’s warmth gradually returns, may Your Reverence’s well-being flourish accordingly.\n\n**Poem Presented to Master Xuanjing upon His Return to Guangling, with Preface**\n\nThe Master’s qi traverses rivers and mountains; his spirit is pure and serene.\nHis Dao soars to the Eight Effulgences, his learning encompasses the Nine Streams.\nWhenever he expounds the Mystic Origin or enlightens the registers of immortality,\nHe extends the jade august mandate for me and preserves me until the golden elixir’s fruition.\nSuch reverence, such weight!\nDeeply do I regret our parting; thus, I compose this poem to bid him farewell:\n\nSilently receiving the Dao of Wang Ni,\nDeeper than the teachings of Yin Xi.\nRejoicing in the assembly of the Eight Effulgences,\nYet sighing for the time of the Nine Elixirs.\nPhoenixes and cranes drift through misty realms;\nRivers and mountains stretch with parting thoughts.\nWhen you ascend to your grotto-palace,\nDo not forget the days in the imperial capital.\n\nYour Reverence, with the pivot of the Dao, brings salvation; with the true origin, you enlighten. Coming to convey the profound and wondrous, departing to return to cloud-wreathed mountains—this poem expresses my sentiments and marks our sorrowful farewell.\n\nWith gratitude for your understanding.\n\n**Emperor Suzong’s Letter of Encouragement to Master Xuanjing**\n\nDecree to Master Li Hanguang:\nLong have you grasped the essentials of the true, deeply penetrated the subtleties of the Mystic. Roaming the boundless realms, you have attained the Dao of luminous clarity. In the days of the Supreme Emperor, you were known by his favor.\n\nNow, refining your being in the famous mountains, I hold you in profound admiration. Moreover, the grottoes of the Mao Lords, as the scriptures proclaim, are places of numinous transformations and secret divine medicines. You must peruse the esoteric formulas of the Golden Registers and cultivate purity in the Dark Palace. Verify the methods for dispelling calamities and demonstrate the arts of longevity—it is especially fitting that you redouble your efforts and manifest the merits of fasting.\n\nThe summer heat is intense; may you remain in peace and good health. This letter conveys but a few words.\n\n**Decree to Master Li Hanguang**\n\nMaster, you have deeply penetrated the wonders of the Dao and long been renowned. The mountains of the Mao Lords of old are now the profound mysteries of the Grotto Realms. Given your virtue and conduct, I hold you in deep admiration.\n\nRecently, I have quelled the weapons of war and swept away the lurking evils, preserving the myriad people and securing the two capitals. The Supreme Emperor’s sacred carriage has been welcomed back to the palace. In this act of filial piety, joy and comfort descend from heaven. I look up in gratitude for the protection of the Mystic Origin, which has twice established the enterprise of the ancestral temples. Your precise cultivation and vows have also assisted in this.\n\nYou must devote greater care to the altar precincts, purify the incense and flames, and broadly extend the Supreme Emperor’s fortune and longevity, ensuring the well-being of all under heaven. The rectification of the Daoist gate rests with you.\n\nWith gratitude for your understanding.\n\n**Decree for the Construction of Ziyang Abbey**\n\nTo the Right Minister, the Merit-Offering Commissioner, Master Xuanjing Li Hanguang, and the Palace Attendant Supervisor Cheng Yuanxian, et al., jointly inspecting the construction of Ziyang Abbey on Mount Mao:\n\nThe aforementioned abbey has been completed, and the ritual offerings of thanksgiving to the above have concluded.\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the ninth month last year, upon submission of the report, it was decreed that the relevant authorities proceed with the construction of the abbey. A remainder of 104 strings and 285 cash was returned. Beyond the construction, this remainder exists.\n\nAs the abbey’s construction is now complete, upon submission of the report, it was decreed that the remainder be granted to the abbey’s household as permanent property. The local authorities have already allocated this sum to the Three Principles.\n\nI have consulted with the abbey’s director, Daoist Liu Xingju, and others, proposing that a nearby county establish a repository for pledges. Each month, the interest shall be collected to sustain the permanent property, with the principal remaining intact.\n\nI humbly hope that the abbey’s name be preserved, and that the land previously allotted to its disciples—measured in *qing* and *mu*—be made sufficient. This year’s grain tax shall be allocated, and next year’s provisions shall also be supplied to the abbey.\n\nPreviously, there were four slaves, six oxen (one small), and one carriage, all presently accounted for.\n\nI have now questioned the local county officials and the Three Principles regarding the abbey’s prior properties. Upon verification, the quantities are consistent. The grain provisions are already sufficient for annual use. Next spring, I request that cultivation of the abbey’s furnishings, the Five Phases, and other necessities be undertaken.\n\nThe abbey’s household was formerly impoverished, with few furnishings. During the recent merit-offering, Commissioner Cheng Yuanxian, by decree, supplied the Yellow Thread Fast. Beyond this, a remainder of one hundred taels of silver was returned. I have instructed that this be distributed to the abbey’s disciples to purchase the lacking furnishings, ensuring all are made complete.\n\nRegarding the abbey’s pines, bamboos, fruit trees, and other flora:\nI humbly note that the abbey lies on Mount Mao, where immortals gather. Though its halls are splendid, pines and bamboos are scarce. As the season is inopportune, planting has not been possible. I request that, come spring, planting be undertaken with care. Additionally, lotuses shall be sown in the southern pond, that the grounds may be fully adorned.\n\nRespectfully submitted as above.\nLin Yang, Governor of Danyang Commandery, presents this secondary report.\n\n**Memorandum from the Chancellery:**\nThe Danyang Commandery’s memorandum, in accordance with the decree, is approved. The memorandum is hereby issued in compliance with the decree.\n\nOn the eighth day of the first month, the eighth year of Tianbao (749), by the Left Chancellor, Minister of War, Chen Xilie, and the Left Vice Director, concurrently Right Chancellor, Lin Fu.\n\n**Memorial from Master Xuanjing et al. appended.**\n\nThe Daoist minister Han Guang respectfully states: On the eighteenth day of this month, the official Wang Youxian conveyed an oral decree, bestowing upon your minister six sets of ritual robes. Furthermore, today, General Gao Lishi announced an imperial edict, presenting your minister with a poem composed by His Majesty, two hundred bolts of fine silk, and an incense burner among other items. Though your minister dwells among the Daoist clergy, possessing no profound insight, I have encountered this sagely era and remain laden with the state’s grace. The rainbow-hued feathered robes issue from the celestial treasury, while the divine brush’s luminous verses suddenly alight upon this humble frame. That your minister—□—should receive such bounty truly exceeds all bounds of propriety. For over a decade, your minister has been afflicted with a wind-borne malady, body enfeebled and strength depleted, rendering all endeavors neglected. I can but pray that the incense burner may bring blessings, repaying in some small measure the sagely person of His Majesty. For the remainder of my days, I shall harbor no other aspiration, overwhelmed as I am by awe and trepidation.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, the sixth year of Tianbao (747).\n\nThe Daoist minister Han Guang further states: On the twenty-fourth day of this month, the palace messenger Dan Tingyao, along with the Daoist Tang Ruoqian, delivered fragile items and an imperial rescript to the mountain. On the twenty-fifth day, I, together with Tingyao and Ruoqian, burned incense and recited the rescript at the gate of Huayang Grotto, thereafter interring the fragile missive. By dusk, the rites were complete. Your minister has also received an edict conferring a honorific title and bestowing ritual robes. Suddenly bearing such sagely favor, I am struck with dismay, uncertain how to proceed.\n\nThe minister, by sheer fortune, has repeatedly been graced with the nation’s benevolence. Yet my merits are meager, my virtue slight, and my heart finds no proper resting place—overwhelmed, I am struck with profound awe and gratitude.\n\nNow that the interment of the fragile missive is complete, I humbly dispatch Yang Shenshe to present this memorial, offering my confusion and expressing my thanks. The twenty-sixth day of the third month, the seventh year of Tianbao (748).\n\nYour minister Han Guang reports: I have witnessed at the eastern hall of Ziyang Abbey, where Master Yinjū and others compounded the elixir, the sudden sprouting of eighty-one stalks of *zhi* grass. Their forms are wondrously circular, their radiance elegant and resplendent; their roots cling to pines and stones, their *qi* dense as orchids and angelicas. Truly, this is a rarity unseen in ages, a marvel scarcely witnessed in our time.\n\nI prostrate myself in reverence before Your Majesty, whose sincerity fills the grotto-palaces and whose devotion remains unwavering. Your edict has revived Ziyang, and thus divine beings have flourished, manifesting auspicious omens. When this news reaches the ears of all, none will fail to rejoice, knowing it is the response to Your Sagely virtue. Overcome with boundless joy, I humbly dispatch Yang Shenshe to first present this memorial. Once the detailed depiction of the *zhi*’s forms is complete, I shall separately send an emissary to report. The twentieth day of the fifth month, the seventh year of Tianbao (748).\n\nYour minister Han Guang reports: On the eighteenth day of this month, the palace messenger Dan Tingyao arrived at the mountain bearing an imperial rescript and incense. On the nineteenth day, I, together with Tingyao and fellow Daoists Liu Xingju and others, proceeded to the right of Daheng Mountain at the eastern hall of Ziyang Abbey, where we burned incense, invoked the Perfected Ones in secrecy, and proclaimed the imperial decree. Today, in accordance with the Dao, we gathered the *zhi* grass—eighty-one stalks in all, their luxuriance arrayed like dragons. Overcome with joy and trepidation, I now entrust this memorial to Tingyao for presentation. The twentieth day of the sixth month, the seventh year of Tianbao (748).\n\nThe Daoist ministers Li Su and others report: Humbly receiving the gracious imperial decree of the thirteenth day of the fifth month, we are commanded that two hundred households from the vicinity of Ziyang Abbey, and one hundred households each from Taiping and Chongyuan Abbeys, be exempted from taxes and corvée labor in perpetuity, to serve as those who repair, maintain, and sweep the abbeys.\n\nThis truly illuminates the grotto-heavens and eternally establishes the gates of the Mystery, adorning and purifying the realm of clarity and stillness, while bestowing strength to augment the blessings of the households. We humbly reflect that His Majesty, the Sacred and Civil, Divine and Martial, Dao-Responsive Emperor of Kaiyuan and Tianbao, broadly exalts the transformative power of the Dao, perfectly manifests the true ancestral teaching, and profoundly promulgates the august Way, upholding the essential principles of cosmic order. Thus, the sacred mountains’ temples and halls are restored from their dilapidation, and the immortal dwellings of Mao and Xu alike all receive renewal and advancement.\n\nWe, your ministers, dull and ignorant, undeservedly dwell within the currents of the Dao, wantonly bathing in extraordinary favor and receiving the full measure of nurturing grace. Therefore, we hasten from afar to the vermilion gates of the palace, prostrating ourselves before the celestial court, overwhelmed with gratitude, reverence, and joy. With exultant hearts, we ascend the Dragon Gate and present this memorial in humble thanksgiving.\n\nThe eleventh day of the eighth month, the seventh year of Tianbao (748).\n\nThe Daoist priests of Ziyang Abbey in Danyang Prefecture, Yang Lisu and Ge Chongxu, along with Daoist priest Xu Yuanzhao of Taiping Abbey, respectfully submit this memorial.\n\nYour servant Hanguang humbly states: Your servant’s disciple Tang Ruoqian, together with former magistrate of Jurong County Li Yuecheng, have previously memorialized on the presentation of lingzhi mushrooms and now report that, as of today, we have received word of thousands of stalks of lingzhi sprouting in the Medicinal Garden, their elixirs refined in the divine crucible, their radiance perfected through ninefold transmutation. Were it not for the sovereign’s virtue—peerless in this age—such numinous manifestations could never have arisen so swiftly.\n\nAccording to the *Cantong Qi* and corroborating scriptures, this elixir is said to ensure that the emperor’s reign endures eternally, his years spanning a thousand autumns. Though unheard of in former ages, this portent is now manifestly attested in our sagely era. Overwhelmed with boundless joy and exultation, we respectfully present this memorial in celebration.\n\nThe twenty-seventh day of the eighth month, the tenth year of Tianbao (751).\n\nYour servant Hanguang further states: Though I have long devoted myself to the Daoist teachings, I am inept in cultivating my own body. For years, I have suffered from wind afflictions, my legs and knees devoid of strength. Since the onset of autumn, my debility has only worsened. As the nature of things dictates, what suits the north may not suit the south. Humbly beseeching Your Majesty’s grace, I implore permission to return to my native land, where I may gradually seek medical treatment and prolong the brief span of my days.\n\nUnbearably overwhelmed with humble devotion.\n\nThe tenth day of the ninth month, the tenth year of Tianbao (751).\n\nYour servant Hanguang further states: On the fourteenth day of last month, the palace attendant Yuan Siyi conveyed Your Majesty’s oral decree, bestowing upon me a poem composed by Your Majesty for my return to Guangling. With reverence, I reflect upon Your Majesty’s emptying of the self to respond to all things, leaving nothing—great or small—unattended. In this gracious condescension, You have entrusted me with Your sagely thoughts, bestowing this divine brushwork, its strokes embodying the marvel of cloud-script and seal-characters, its words resounding with the celestial tones of the Jade Dawn. Overwhelmed by such boundless favor, I receive it with unwearied devotion. My journey’s preparations are now complete, and I shall set forth this very day. To part from Your Majesty’s august court fills me with nothing but shame and longing.\n\nThe fifteenth day of the ninth month, the tenth year of Tianbao (751).\n\nYour servant Hanguang further states: As the late summer’s noxious heat lingishes, I humbly pray for Your Majesty’s well-being in all matters. On the eighth day of last month, the imperial messenger Dan Tingyao arrived at the mountain to convey Your Majesty’s oral decree, granting two hundred bolts of silk and three boxes of incense for use in the purification rites and offerings at Maoshan, along with two sets of robes bestowed upon me. In dutiful observance of Your Majesty’s sacred command, I have established a separate retreat on the eastern slope of Yugang Mountain, to the right of the Ziyang Abbey. The fast shall commence at the hour of *rending* on the twenty-seventh day of this month, with the formal rites beginning at the *yin* hour of the twenty-eighth day. Thereafter, I shall proceed in gradual accordance with the prescribed observances. The ritual proceedings are expected to conclude during the winter lull, and I shall exert every effort to seek spiritual communion.\n\nYet I, your humble servant, have rendered no meritorious service, yet repeatedly receive such generous bestowals—prostrate, I tremble with awe. The preparations for the offerings are now complete. I have dispatched my disciple Tang Ruoqian to accompany the imperial messenger Qi Lingshuo, bearing this memorial to Your Majesty.\n\n---\n\nOn the nineteenth day of the sixth month, the eleventh year of Tianbao:\nYour humble servant Han Guang respectfully submits: As the sun’s arc completes its circuit and daylight reaches its southernmost extent, I reverently pray that Your Majesty, who receives the celestial mandate and embraces the blessings of Heaven, may know boundless prosperity. At present, we are conducting rites of fasting and offerings at Maoshan for the welfare of the state, and our joy is beyond measure. I have sent the imperial messenger Dan Tingyao to inquire after Your Majesty’s well-being and now humbly present this memorial.\n\n---\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month, the eleventh year of Tianbao:\nYour humble servant Han Guang respectfully submits: Regarding the rites of fasting and offerings previously petitioned for at the eastern slope of Yugang Mountain, to the right of the Ziyang Abbey, we commenced on the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month and have continued the Daoist observances until the seventh day of this month, at the first light of the winter solstice. On that occasion, both the participants in the fast and the imperial messenger Qi Lingshuo witnessed sweet dew descending upon the pine trees in all directions around the altar. The dew was white in color, fragrant in scent, sweet in taste, and its abundance diminished with the distance of the pines from the altar. To date, we estimate that sweet dew has descended upon two hundred and thirty pine trees. As the *Daodejing* states, “When Heaven and Earth unite, sweet dew descends—no one commands it, yet it falls evenly.” The sages of old recorded this in their scriptures as an auspicious omen. That our rites of fasting and offerings should coincide with such a sign is most propitious. How could I dare withhold this news? I have dispatched my disciple Tang Ruoqian to accompany the imperial messenger Qi Lingshuo, bearing this memorial and presenting two measures of the sweet dew.\n\n---\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the first month, the twelfth year of Tianbao:\nYour humble servant Han Guang respectfully submits: Though the first month of spring still brings chill, I reverently pray that Your Majesty’s well-being may be ever blessed. On the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the previous year, the imperial messenger Dan Tingyao and my disciples, including Tang Ruoqian, arrived, bearing Your Majesty’s gracious decree of inquiry and consolation. I have received one hundred bolts of silk, while the Daoist practitioners conducting the rites were bestowed two hundred bolts. Furthermore, I was honored by Your Majesty’s command to perform rites of purification, thanksgiving, and additional meritorious observances in accordance with the *He Tu Nei Pian*, for which I received seventy bolts of purple-woven silk for my life-cord, twenty bolts each of five-directional patterned silk, and five hundred taels of silver. Accordingly, on the last day of the twelfth month of the previous year and the first day of the new year, I first conducted the auspicious New Year’s fast at the Great Dragon Prosperity Abbey of the Great Tang in Guangling Prefecture, to enhance the blessings of the season’s renewal. Now, at the Ziyang Abbey on Maoshan, I have assembled fellow practitioners of the Dao who uphold the precepts, jointly preparing the ritual implements and rehearsing the ceremonies to ensure strict adherence to the proper forms before their use. Once the summer fast concludes, I shall report the proceedings in full. Yet I, who am of no talent, have been mistakenly entrusted with the Daoist teachings and, despite my unworthiness, have repeatedly received the state’s favor. Though I strive with utmost sincerity, how could I ever repay even a fraction? My awe and trepidation are beyond measure.\n\n---\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month, the twelfth year of Tianbao:\nYour humble servant Han Guang respectfully submits: As the heat of midsummer intensifies, I reverently pray that Your Majesty’s well-being may be ever blessed. Previously, I received Your Majesty’s decree commanding the performance of the *He Tu* rites of purification and thanksgiving at Maoshan. Due to incessant rains, the observances were delayed, and it was not until the night of the eighth day of this month that we established the fasting quarters. On the nights of the ninth and tenth days, we conducted the formal fast in accordance with the proper forms, proceeding through the rites of obeisance and offerings. On the twelfth day, we cast jade into the river, and on the full moon, we prepared a fast to honor the worthy. From beginning to end, the proceedings were carried out with meticulous care. Yet my learning has not been transmitted by a master, and my abilities fall short of wisdom. Though I have followed the established regulations, my doubts remain unresolved, and my apprehension is beyond measure.\n\nRespectfully dispatching Tang Ruoqian to present this memorial for Your Majesty’s attention.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the fifth month, the thirteenth year of the Tianbao era,\n\nYour servant Han Guang respectfully reports: On the tenth day of this month, the imperial envoy Meng Youxian arrived at Maoshan with a sacred edict to conduct meritorious deeds at the ritual site. Overwhelmed by the imperial grace, I am filled with awe and trepidation. Previously, on this mountain, I and those Daoist priests of strict discipline have together maintained the duties of incense and lamp offerings, humbly seeking to aid the state, uphold the teachings, dispel calamities, and invoke blessings. Though we have been entrusted with these ritual duties, we are ashamed of our lack of spiritual efficacy, and our single-minded devotion remains unwavering. Now, as the imperial envoy Meng Youxian returns, I respectfully present this memorial in gratitude for Your Majesty’s favor.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the sixth month, the second year of the Zhide era, the memorial and accompanying documents were recorded. This inscription was carved in stone in the fourteenth year of the Zhenyuan era of the Tang.\n\n---\n\n**Imperial Edict on the Prohibited Mountains of Maoshan, Runzhou**\n\n**Damao Mountain:** To the west, within three *li* of level ground, lies Taiping Abbey. To the south, within three *li* of level ground, stands Chongyuan Abbey and the Daoist Ancestral Hall at the southern gate of Huayang Grotto. To the east, within four *li*, and to the northeast, along the unbroken ridge of Lǜ Ridge, the boundary follows the level path. To the north, it connects to Jijin Ridge, encompassing the western gate of Huayang Grotto and its shrines.\n\n**Zhongmao Mountain:** To the west, within three *li* of level ground, lie Sanmao Temple and its shrines. To the east, within three *li* of level ground, to the south, adjoining Jijin Ridge, and to the north, connected to Xiaomao Mountain.\n\n**Xiaomao Mountain:** To the west, within three *li* of level ground, extending northwest to the Dragon Pond at Leiping, Master Guo’s Pond, and Ziyang Abbey. To the south, it adjoins Zhongmao Mountain; to the east, within three *li* of level ground; and to the north, it connects to Daheng Mountain, encompassing Yankou Grotto and its shrines, as well as Liandan Abbey, three *li* northward.\n\nThe above account is submitted by Sun Zhiqing and other ceremonial Daoist priests of the Three Abbeys of Maoshan. The sacred precincts of the Perfected Ones of Huayang Grotto-Heaven, having previously received the imperial decree prohibiting hunting, logging, and the burning of vegetation in autumn and winter, as well as the cessation of all sacrificial offerings involving animals, have since endured hardship. The original edict has been lost, and the people, disregarding the former command, have increasingly encroached upon these lands, recklessly felling the mountain forests and falsely claiming long-standing rights.\n\nHumbly we beseech that the prohibition be reissued in accordance with the law, and that officials be appointed to oversee and strictly enforce its observance. Thus may the sacred precincts be kept in solemn order, the abbeys and temples enjoy peace, and the original boundaries of the forbidden lands be restored as before.\n\nMemorandum from the Chancellery and Secretariat: The Three Abbeys of Maoshan, by imperial decree, have petitioned regarding the sacred precincts of the Grotto-Palace of Mount Juqu, a site revered by successive sagely rulers of old. It is fitting that the prohibition on logging and burning be enforced to uphold its sanctity and reverence. Within the boundaries of Maoshan, the people shall not be permitted to hunt, fell trees, or set fire to the mountain forests. The prefectures and counties are hereby charged with strict enforcement of this prohibition. This memorandum is issued in accordance with the imperial decree.\n\nThe 4th day of the 10th month, the 7th year of the Taihe era.\nLi Deyu, Vice Director of the Chancellery and Participant in the Deliberations of State Affairs;\nNiu Sengru, Acting Minister of Works and Participant in the Deliberations of State Affairs.\n\nEnd of *Maoshan Zhi*, Scroll Two.\n\n---\n*Maoshan Zhi*, Scroll Three\nComposed by Liu Dabin, Successor Master of the Shangqing Tradition\n\nDeputy Copyist of Imperial Edicts, Song Shao, *Edict Prohibiting Logging in the Mountains*\n\nIt has come to our attention that within the boundaries of Maoshan, near the temples, abbeys, and oratories, many disregard the regulations of cultivation and arbitrarily engage in logging or set wildfires to burn the mountain forests. This matter requires deliberation and specific directives.\n\nThe state now extends its blessings to nurture the people. These renowned mountains, recorded in the local gazetteers, are either governed by benevolence or serve as the abode of perfected beings. They are places where blessings descend and are rightfully deemed sanctuaries for the spirit. How, then, can axes and hatchets compete to fell them, or firewood-gathering proceed without restraint, causing the finest growth to wither and the numinous traces to fade from view? Thus, we issue this prohibition to manifest our reverence and solemnity.\n\nHereby, we command Runzhou and Shengzhou that, upon receipt of this imperial proclamation, they shall demarcate the boundaries on all four sides of Maoshan. Strict orders shall be enforced to sever all such activities. Henceforth, no person—including the officials, abbots, and custodians of the mountain’s temples, abbeys, and oratories—shall be permitted to engage in logging, felling, or setting wildfires to burn the forests.\n\nLocal patrol officers, officials, elders, and strongmen shall be charged with surveillance and inspection. Should any violations occur, the offenders shall be immediately apprehended and sent to the relevant prefectures and counties for interrogation. After a public display of fifteen days, they shall be released. If the scale of logging is extensive and the circumstances unforgivable, the offenders shall be detained and a report submitted for further instructions, after which they shall be sentenced and exiled accordingly.\n\nFor areas outside the temples, abbeys, and oratories where firewood is needed and the trees are not part of ancient sites or long-preserved growth, the county officials and the custodians of the abbeys shall jointly demarcate the boundaries and erect clear markers before any logging may proceed. Where trees have already been felled or burned, leaving gaps in the rows, the local prefectures and counties shall mandate the replanting of trees in those areas to ensure no barren spaces remain. No disturbances shall be tolerated.\n\nThis imperial proclamation shall be inscribed on stone and displayed at the gates of the abbeys and along major thoroughfares for all to know.\n\nThe 2nd year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era, by imperial decree as above.\n\nThe August Empress Liu bestows upon Master Zhu of the Dao a red imperial letter, along with a gold water vessel weighing thirty taels in total. This vessel was used by the Emperor in his youth and is now granted to the Daoist to purchase land for the sustenance of the Daoist community, providing for their daily meals and rituals. These rituals shall be conducted daily to pray for the Emperor’s longevity, perpetual peace, and eternal freedom from calamity. The recipient shall consult with the local prefect to acquire fertile land and fine estates. Ren Wenqing and the prefect shall jointly oversee the purchase, and upon completion, a map shall be drawn and submitted.\n\n*Imperial Edict Conferring Additional Titles upon the Three Lords of Maoshan*\n\nThe Chancellery is hereby decreed: Within the Grotto-Heaven of Juqu, there dwell perfected beings whose transformations are boundless and whose numinous wonders are unfathomable. Since the Qin and Han dynasties, over a thousand years have passed, during which their blessings have manifested and their grace extended to the people. Yet their exalted names and titles remain incomplete, which does not suffice to express the utmost sincerity of our veneration.\n\nThe Great Lord of Maoshan, currently titled *Taiyuan Zhenren, Eastern Marchmount Supreme Minister, and Director of Destinies*, shall henceforth be advanced to *Taiyuan Miaodao Zhenren, Eastern Marchmount Supreme Minister, and Director of Destinies*.\n\nThe Middle Lord of Maoshan, currently titled *Dinglu Right Prohibitions Zhenren*, shall henceforth be advanced to *Dinglu Right Prohibitions Chongjing Zhenren*.\n\nThe Lesser Lord of Maoshan, currently titled *Sanguan Baoming Zhenren*, shall henceforth be advanced to *Sanguan Baoming Chonghui Zhenren*.\n\nMay this harmonize the qi, elicit auspicious responses, and assist our state in securing boundless peace and prosperity.\n\nThus is this edict decreed.\n\nHerein is the decree for your awareness.\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the fourth month in the first year of *Chongning*,\n\nA rescript and poem bestowed by Emperor Huizong upon Master Liu.\n\n*Chongning* comprised forty-one such decrees; *Daguan*, thirty-one.\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nSince our parting, you must have maintained tranquility.\nYou nurture harmony to cultivate qi, attaining the wondrous Dao;\nYour learning is profound, your mastery of abstruse principles vast.\nYou accumulate goodness by rescuing those in peril,\nAnd cultivate loftiness by observing virtue and achievement.\nIn matters great and small, you are ever consulted;\nExpending utmost counsel and thought, you demonstrate steadfast loyalty.\nIn aiding others and benefiting all things, your merit is unparalleled.\n\nUpon reviewing your recent memorial, all therein is deemed fitting.\nI have dispatched Hao Sui to oversee the matter in person,\nAnd the remaining lands and other requests shall likewise be granted in full.\nShould further needs arise, memorialize as before.\n\nIssued on the sixth day of the seventh month in the fifth year of *Chongning*.\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nThose who cultivate the Dao focus on fundamentals—such are the steadfast among the lofty;\nThose who devote themselves to learning hold it in their hearts—such is the virtue of relinquishing attachment and forsaking greed.\nYou particularly uphold the art of dispelling illness,\nAnd universally apply methods to succor others.\n\nSince your departure from the capital, nearly a year has passed.\nUpon reviewing your recent memorial, I rejoice to learn of your tranquility.\n\nThe request to erect timber has been approved, and an order issued for the construction of the abbey. Select an auspicious date to commence work with haste. Should any deficiencies arise in the course of progress, memorialize each in turn.\n\nAs the spring qi gradually harmonizes, attend well to your own regulation, reverently aligning with the celestial seasons to nurture the wondrous Dao.\n\n*Issued on the ninth day of the first month in the second year of Chongning.*\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nSince your departure from the capital, the seasons have swiftly turned. The completion and repair of the shrine halls bespeak your diligent toil. Upon reviewing your recent memorial, I am pleased to learn of your peace and prosperity.\n\nAs for the name of the hall, *Heavenly Tranquility and Myriad Blessings* shall suffice. The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* shall proceed as memorialized.\n\nYou, in solemn reverence, conduct the rites, reaching the celestial realms. Why have you not memorialized in full the portents and omens you have witnessed?\n\nAt this time of barley and wheat sprouting, we rely solely on the grace of timely rains. Yet since the onset of spring, the seasonal rains have been wanting, leaving the fields of the four directions unwatered and the hopes of a thousand granaries in dire straits. My heart is heavy with concern, and day and night I find no respite.\n\nYou must wholeheartedly grasp my deepest sentiments. With this earnest sincerity, redouble your prayers with utmost devotion. Though my title is not that of a lofty Daoist, how could I fail to reach the Pure Capital? The rest may be cherished as before; delve ever deeper into the wondrous principles.\n\nIn the seclusion of the mountains and forests, guard well your true constancy.\n\n*Issued on the twenty-first day of the third month in the second year of Chongning.*\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nSince your departure from the capital, many seasons have passed. My thoughts of comfort and inquiry have been repeatedly conveyed.\n\nNow in midsummer, the scorching sun lingers long. I imagine your mountain dwelling, cool and lofty, where in the tranquility of Daoist practice, your movements and repose remain in harmony. The renovation of the sacred halls must surely be complete.\n\nIn reverent devotion to the Supreme Perfection, entrust the task to one of virtue. Should any rites or matters be lacking, memorialize them in detail. As for any portents or omens you witness, report each without omission.\n\nThe season is now one of intense heat; attend well to your cultivation and refinement, and in your diligence in the Dao, embody my deepest care.\n\n*Issued on the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the second year of Chongning.*\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nWhen you once resided near the capital and were summoned to the imperial court, you frequently expressed your sincere devotion to the Dao, broadening my own aspirations. With an open heart, I embraced your counsel—how could such fine words be forgotten?\n\nTo honor and make manifest your distinction, I bestowed upon you the title *Transcending the Common*. The accompanying decree, now dispatched to you, is to be received accordingly.\n\nAs the autumn air turns crisp and solemn, in the leisure of your refined cultivation, take care to preserve your well-being.\n\nHold the bestowed decree of *Mysterious Master of the Abbey of Preserving the True*.\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang, Daoist Master of Penetrating Mystery and Great Perfection of Mao Mountain in Jurong County, Jiangning Prefecture:\nI govern the present with the Dao of antiquity, esteeming those who, like you, embrace the obscure and guard the One, rectifying the decadent customs of the age. You concentrate your qi to attain suppleness and nurture simplicity. Though the Dao is exalted and virtue esteemed, beyond the reach of rank, how can the correspondence of name and reality be set aside?\n\nThus, I renew the bestowal of this decree, that it may inspire later scholars. Continue to extend your innate goodness to aid the people. You are hereby specially granted the title *Mysterious Master of the Abbey of Preserving the True*.\n\n*Issued on the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month in the second year of Chongning, by Secretary of the Secretariat Bai Shizhong.*\n\nI, considering your profound Dao and towering virtue, your sincere devotion to the state, have specially conferred this exceptional title to manifest your lofty benevolence. If you feel your merits in aiding the world fall short of such a distinguished appellation, the imperial command must still be reverently accepted. Do not persist in refusal; you should understand this well.\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nSince the founding of the capital, the years have turned many times. I have cherished the singular virtue you possess, and through three autumns, I have not forgotten.\n\nUpon receiving your recent memorial, I rejoice to learn of your tranquility. Your chapters continue the former plans, the sacred halls are completed, and the precious records bring blessings—all now adorn the towering pavilions, awaiting the descent of the Supreme Perfection.\n\nYou have long guarded emptiness and transcendence, your loftiness surpassing the common. In maintaining the sacred halls, you harmonize the extremes of heat and cold with serene joy. On Mao Peak, you find contentment among the springs and rocks.\n\nYour memorial has been reviewed in full. An order has been issued to dispatch the Imperial Physician Su Gui to oversee and manage all necessary provisions. Memorialize whatever you require, and it shall be granted without deficiency.\n\nAs autumn’s frost arrives and the seasonal qi turns cold, may you further attain the wondrous Dao. Words are not needed to convey more.\n\nShould you witness any further calamities or omens, memorialize each in turn. As for the prayers previously offered, to this day no response has been received. What is to be done this time?\n\n*Issued on the fifteenth day of the ninth month in the third year of Chongning.*\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nSince your departure from the capital region, many years have passed. Dwelling on the Three Mao Peaks, your aspirations remain vast; purifying yourself, you preserve your true nature. Residing in the border mountains, your heart dwells beyond the mundane.\n\nI recall your wondrous Dao, serene and tranquil, your nature planted in purity and peace. You align with heaven and earth to nurture your loftiness, shedding the dust of the world to awaken to principle.\n\nUpon reviewing your recent memorial, I am pleased to learn of your thoughts.\n\nAs winter approaches, how do your movements and repose fare? I understand that in mid-spring you will journey to the capital. An emissary, Zhang Xu, has been dispatched to arrange your travel, and all relevant officials have been instructed to provide for your needs. Should anything still be lacking, memorialize in detail, that I may anticipate your arrival with joy.\n\nNow in the depths of winter, as the year draws to a close, in your broad dissemination of the true teachings and your aid to the sprouting grasses, redouble your efforts in cultivation to embody my deepest care.\n\nThis letter conveys my intent; further words are unnecessary.\n\n*Issued on the twenty-third day of the eleventh month in the third year of Chongning.*\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nYour memorial has been reviewed in full, and your earnest sincerity is understood. As the year ends in bitter cold, I rejoice in your well-being.\n\nThe construction of the Abbey of Preserving the True still lacks decorative painting. An order has been issued to the relevant officials to enforce a strict deadline and complete the work with all haste. The matters of raising the ridgepole and the like are the responsibility of the respective offices—why must you report their completion?\n\nThe arrangements for your departure from the deep chamber and the planning of the canal transport have all been carried out.\n\nAs the early spring air warms, you should first journey to the capital without delay. Do not allow even slight hesitation, lest it cause me further concern. Prepare your boat and oars, and hasten to the imperial court.\n\nOfficials from the various bureaus have been dispatched to oversee your journey along the way.\n\nIn principle, it is indeed difficult to rest easy, and you should fully understand my deep regard for you.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the first month, the fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang: Having reviewed your memorial, I have fully grasped your sincere sentiments. Though early spring brings biting cold, I am pleased to learn of your peace and tranquility. Your mind is vast and penetrating, transcending worldly concerns to preserve your true and constant nature; your understanding reaches the subtlest depths, nurturing the spirit-terrace to attain the wondrous Dao. Since the founding of the Three Mao Abbey, it has wholly occupied your heart. Now that the work of repair and completion is done, the task of applying cinnabar and pigments has been entrusted to the relevant offices, and they will surely see it finished without delay. Maintain your serenity and stillness, and do not overtax your spirit.\n\nMy regard for you has only grown, and I wish to summon you for an audience to express my thoughts. Your resolve is firm, and your request for completion should be granted. You may proceed as memorialized: as soon as the work is finished, hasten to the imperial court.\n\nZhang Lan has already been issued orders to supervise the project exclusively and ensure all preparations are made. The sacred images commissioned for you are to be moved into the Dharma Hall and provisionally enshrined. If anything remains lacking, report it to me at once. As spring’s cold lingers, take care to preserve your health, that my profound favor may be made manifest. You should fully understand my deepest concerns.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the first month, the fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn exhortation to Liu Hun Kang: Having reviewed your memorial, I have fully grasped your sincere sentiments. As spring deepens, I am gladdened to hear of your continued well-being. Your earlier letter expressing readiness to journey here has been followed by a pledge of completion. I have considered that a gentleman cannot be compelled by force, nor can a master of the Dao be bound by constraints. Having carefully weighed your intentions, I shall grant your request, allowing you to follow the carefree path of the enlightened and fulfilling the wishes of one of lofty virtue. This is no slight refusal, so do not entertain deep doubts.\n\nMoreover, your insight penetrates the true origin, silently bestowing the blessings of the Dao. Your nature is rooted in profound and abyssal tranquility, and your endowment abounds with steadfast benevolence. Your spiritual efficacy brings aid, aligning with the creative and sustaining forces of Heaven and Earth; your dharmic power is boundless, aiding the transformative nurturance of yin and yang. Your purity and nobility are to be esteemed, and worldly ties cannot restrain you. With unwavering resolve, you dwell in forests and springs, maintaining purity to ensure longevity. The abbey’s halls are repaired, and all preparations should be complete. I have ordered the work to be expedited, and there must be no delay. As soon as you memorialize the completion of the project, make haste to the imperial court. Though I have not yet met with you in person, I urge you to take even greater care. Let these words serve as instruction, and I trust you will understand.\n\nOn the third day of the intercalary second month, the fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn exhortation to Liu Hun Kang: Your heart abides in the wondrous Dao, and your spiritual efficacy is renowned near and far. You harmonize with the four seasons to cultivate harmony, dwelling in your body to ensure lasting fortune. Your sacred talismans and dharma-water have long been praised for their benevolence in aiding others; preserving qi and nurturing spirit, you naturally attain mastery of life’s cultivation. As this season of scorching heat approaches, I trust extraordinary blessings will gather upon you. I have inquired about your scheduled audience, and you have earnestly requested completion of the work.\n\nThe completion of the work is near, and solemn promises must not be broken. You should hasten your preparations, for now is the time when favorable winds fill the sails, and the painted magpie may soon ascend—when the river’s waters flow smooth and swift. The scorching heat is upon us; take even greater care to preserve your well-being. Thus I write to inform you, and shall say no more.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the fifth month, the fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang: Having reviewed your recent memorial, I fully comprehend your sentiments. Through the height of summer, you have maintained your person and increased your fortune. I have learned that the construction is nearly complete, and you will soon arrive by boat in the capital’s vicinity. In serving diligently at your post, you have gathered merit and demonstrated your ability, embodying the spirit of encouragement. Your sincere request shall be granted. Set a date for your audience and hasten your departure. Spread good fortune like sprouting grass, and enjoy modest renown along the great Dao. Fulfill this utmost courtesy and honor my deep regard.\n\nThe summer heat is intense; I trust you remain well. This letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\nOn the seventeenth day of the sixth month, the fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang: You embody the naturalness of the great Dao, studying the canonical principles of true doctrine. Accord with the seasons and delight in your nature, rectifying the steadfast heart within yourself. Expound the teachings to aid others, preserving a lifespan of a thousand years. Our separation has grown long, and my thoughts of you are many. Though I have repeatedly summoned you, the year has turned anew. There remains your memorial of hardship, and your words of persistent avoidance. Moreover, I have repeatedly ordered the officials to ensure completion, supervising the work’s assembly. Do not harbor further concerns; the rest of the repairs shall follow the established plan. Gradual progress will bring full success—why offer excessive modesty? Prepare swiftly for your voyage, and I shall await the sound of your oars. With the immortal’s sail stilled by gentle winds and autumn waters calm, seize this clear season and do not decline to come for an audience. I issue this edict to demonstrate my profound regard, and shall soon witness your words in person.\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the seventh month, fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nSince your departure from the imperial capital, many months and years have passed. Dwelling upon the renowned mountains and revering the sacred halls, you have devoted your utmost sincerity to serve the exalted immortals. You have expounded the origins of the Great Dao, illuminating the responses of the celestial spirits above. You have restored and expanded the temple precincts, gathering auspicious omens, magnifying the grand design of this single endeavor, and extending the radiant blessings of ten thousand years. All that you have presented has been marked by utmost loyalty. I eagerly await your audience; you may travel by boat at your convenience. As for your modest reluctance, I have already issued instructions accordingly. Now that the initial phase of the work is complete and the project nears its joyous conclusion, seize this autumn season and hasten your oars upon the tranquil currents. With the heavens high and clouds stilled, the clear light bathes a thousand miles of calm waves; waters emerald and mists verdant, a single sail billows in the gentle breeze. Still, I gauge your strength and encourage you to nurture your purity and loftiness.\n\nThis edict is issued to demonstrate my profound regard; may you fully grasp its intent. I shall soon witness your words in person.\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nOn the twentieth day of the eighth month, fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nI have reviewed your memorial reporting the completion of the repairs and your intention to embark by boat in the ninth month to attend court and offer thanks. I rejoice at the prospect of your leisurely journey along the Qinhuai, your luminous presence soaring like an immortal toward the imperial gates. I await the profound teachings of your subtle wisdom and revere the pure winds of your compassionate frugality. Your thoughts are ever fixed on governance and the preparation of fresh offerings, ever tending toward the true Dao. As autumn’s frost approaches, your travels must have been arduous. I have dispatched an emissary to convey my comfort and esteem. May this exceptional regard further strengthen your serenity. Prepare swiftly for your voyage to ease my longing. Autumn lingers—how fare you of late?\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nOn the twelfth day of the ninth month, fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nYour heart holds fast to the essence of the Dao, long attuned to the true origin. For years, you have dwelled in the realm of carefree ease, mastering the subtleties of harmony. Recently, your cloud-borne canopy arrived at the vermilion gates, and you graciously revealed the secrets of your renowned teachings. You petitioned to return to your former retreat on Maofeng, your resolve steadfast and earnest. I have reluctantly acceded to your request. Since your departure, a month has swiftly passed, and with each thought of you, I remain wakeful and forgetful of sleep. Though you recline in your secluded boat, I trust you have reached the borders of Huaichu, where the threefold auspicious herbs nurture your true nature beyond the dust of the world. Your lofty winds and distant ascent are truly admirable.\n\nAs the season battles the lingering heat, how fare you of late?\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nSince your departure from the capital, a month has quickly elapsed. I imagine your movements and stillness remain attuned to the Dao’s subtleties. With each glance southward, my longing and admiration only deepen. Regarding the matters you entrusted in your memorial, await the celestial will and present them swiftly. Additionally, I request several dozen talismans for wind ailments to be sealed and forwarded. As the season remains oppressively hot, tend to your clarity and emptiness. I trust you have arrived at the palace—how fare the repairs? Have you completed the work on the meditation hermitage? Report each detail in your memorial.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the fifth month, fifth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nI have reviewed your memorial regarding the presentation of the sacred writ. Truly, utmost sincerity must reach the heavens, and diligent cultivation will evoke response. The details are preserved in the true canons, and the rites are clearly set forth in the sacred codes. Your reverent heart has prayed with purity, your spirit soaring in devotion, silently communing with the exalted immortals to receive their secret decrees. Were it not for the fullness of your public loyalty, how could your sincerity ascend so purely? Your swift arrival brings profound admiration.\n\nRecently, you earnestly sought to decline the journey to the capital and petitioned to return to your former abode. The three peaks of Maoshan are indeed a fitting retreat for one of your loftiness, a sanctuary where past sages have dwelled, fulfilling your aspiration to withdraw and cultivate the spirit. You must further refine yourself to match my earnest hopes. As the season turns to scorching heat, how fare you of late?\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nSince your departure from the capital, months have again passed. With the days growing hotter, I imagine your mastery of the Dao keeps you serene. Your memorial of auspicious omens fills me with admiration—were it not for your profound understanding of the lofty Dao, how could such blessings be attained? If you have further insights, send them with Huang Xisou; do not conceal anything. Also, itemize any deficiencies in the palace and report them in detail. The work on the meditation hermitage has yet to be announced as complete—are the repairs to your satisfaction?\n\nAs before.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nYour disciple Fu Xilie has presented a memorial, from which I understand your dedication to emptiness and your dwelling in purity, attaining the wondrous principles of non-action and plumbing the depths of the Great Dao. Since arriving at Wanning Palace, you have enjoyed abundant leisure. The three peaks of Maoshan and the Purple Mansion, the blessed courts of past sages, the abodes of true immortals—all respond to your presence like an echo. You treasure the Golden Registers to refine your qi and guard the Jade Tablets in your pure cultivation. I trust you find ease and leisure, sustaining the incense and flames to pray for the tranquility of the imperial house above and the well-being of the people below. Your earnest devotion is duly noted.\n\nYour sealed memorial has arrived, deeply moving me with its distant sincerity and further demonstrating your diligence. Though our separation has been brief, I thirst for your wisdom. As the scorching heat persists, take care to protect yourself.\n\nHow fare you of late?\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nFu Xilie and others have presented a memorial, informing me of your arrival at Yuanfu Wanning Palace and your successful presentation of the sacred writ, for which you have received the compassionate favor of Heaven and the bestowal of auspicious signs. Your Dao emulates the three peaks of Maoshan, your conduct follows the two masters Xu, briefly visiting the imperial court before returning to your native mountains—how could the crane-borne chariot be detained? Though I deeply cherish our bond, your recent kindness has weighed heavily on my thoughts. Your presentation of the sacred writ has borne the august gaze of Heaven, and I humbly receive its profound instructions, ever mindful of its warnings, day and night revering and striving to fulfill its radiant decrees.\n\nAs the scorching heat intensifies, take care to preserve your well-being. The rest is as conveyed in the edict. All matters in your memorial have been addressed accordingly. If further needs arise, report them in detail.\n\nThe Supervisory Official has been appointed as Yang Lu, and the inscribed plaque has been written. Cai Bian, who is informed of this, has also composed the text. Since your arrival in Ganzhou, should you witness any omens of fortune or misfortune, report them in meticulous detail. The *ruixiang* flowers have been gathered, which is most auspicious.\n\nUpon Fu Xilie’s return, deliver the imperial edicts and the gifts from the Ministry of Rites. The rest are granted purple robes and master’s titles, along with personally inscribed fans to summon cooling breezes in the heat. The *Zhenxin* talismans—request several copies.\n\nUpon Fu Xilie’s return, the following items are to be conveyed:\nTwenty catties each of *chenxiang* and *tanxiang* incense,\nFive catties of raw and prepared *longnao*,\nTen catties of *jiangzhen* incense,\nTwenty baskets of four kinds of preserved fruits,\nTen imperial fans with painted heads,\nAnd two portions of medicinal incense.\n\nOn the fourth day of the seventh month, the fifth year of Chongning.\n\nEdict to Liu Hun Kang:\nYour mastery of the profound and esoteric has long been attained, your aspirations rooted in purity and emptiness. I constantly reflect upon your lofty conduct, never forgetting it day or night. Having reviewed your diligent memorials, I am further assured of your loyalty to the imperial house. Such thoughts fill me with deep admiration. All matters you have submitted shall be promptly enacted.\n\nThe eternal resting place of Yongsheng shall permit the assembly of devotees for rites of incense and prayer; the officials of the Hidden Spirit Abbey shall be rewarded according to their ranks and grades. The decree has already been issued—you may rest assured.\n\nI revere and honor the Great Dao, gazing with admiration upon the sacred traces of the immortals. To manifest my aspirations and glorify their merits, I have opened the mountains and erected halls. Now that the construction is complete and the work presented, my joy and gratitude overflow as hoped. May the true wind be widely proclaimed, bestowing abundant blessings upon the people; may the refined cultivation of the dharma records forever harmonize with and support the grand foundation. Though my earnest instructions remain distant, guard well your pure heart.\n\nThe autumn chill approaches—how fares your health of late? This letter conveys but a few words.\n\n**Edict to Liu Hun Kang:**\nI have reviewed your memorial requesting the appointment of an official to compose the record of the abbey. All details are understood.\n\nMao Ridge, a secluded retreat, stands upon an ancient site of golden repute. Mindful of its sacred proximity, adjoining the cavern palaces, I have expanded the new sanctuary of jade towers to grandly inaugurate the flourishing of the true wind. With the abbey’s completion, the monumental stele awaits its inscription. I have commanded a learned scholar to compose the text and personally inscribed the stele’s title. This is not merely a splendid occasion of the present but also a means to extol the virtuous renown of those who came before. You must carefully select eminent Daoist masters to diligently cultivate the supreme Way with unwavering devotion. Such is the aspiration I hold for you, ever mindful of its essence, and ever recalling your exemplary conduct.\n\nGiven the long and arduous journey, I imagine our meeting remains distant. The stele’s title I have personally inscribed, along with the record composed and written by Cai Bian, are now dispatched under the escort of an imperial envoy—you may receive them accordingly.\n\nThe autumn chill approaches—how fares your health of late? This letter conveys but a few words.\n\nYou have long dwelled in purity upon Golden Mount, your name recorded in the Purple Bureau. Since your departure by immortal boat, I have daily pondered and missed you. Now that the autumn air has suddenly turned crisp, I reflect from afar upon the harmony of your Daoist body. Though our meeting remains beyond reach, my longing for your Way is profound. Preserve your hidden spirit in cultivation, fulfilling my earnest gaze.\n\nThe stele’s title and other items have now been completed and are sent to you. Any further matters you wish to convey are fully set forth in the memorial.\n\n**Edict to Liu Hun Kang:**\nYou have long resided in the truth, unwavering in your adherence to the Dao. Your merits and conduct grow ever more illustrious, your reputation long established. Dwelling in the peace of Wanning, you serve the Great Record with diligence; your broad salvation of the living draws all toward virtuous transformation. Expanding the wonders of your effortless mastery, you bring forth the auspicious signs I may attain. For fame is made manifest by reality, and rites are measured by virtue—thus, it is fitting to bestow honors of praise and esteem, extending far-reaching blessings. The elevation of your dharma title is most fitting. Receive this with reverence and do not decline.\n\nThe edict of appointment is now dispatched to you—you may receive it accordingly.\n\nThe season of white autumn is upon us—how fares your health of late? This letter conveys but a few words.\n\nI reflect upon your dwelling in truth upon Sentence Mountain, nurturing purity and concealing your spirit. Your healing waters have brought relief near and far; you have summoned crane chariots to discourse upon the Dao and proclaim harmony, guiding with effortless wisdom to aid the people’s tranquil governance. I revere your subtle mysteries, ever mindful of them waking and sleeping. Recently, with the completion of the abbey, I have added the title \"Master of Serene Harmony\" to your name. The edict has already been sent to you—may you appreciate this favor.\n\nThough your tribute of wise counsel has arrived, your audience remains beyond reach. Take especial care of yourself.\n\nRegarding the memorial from Master Yi on matters of the abbey gates, walls, and other structures, requesting repairs—I have ordered the relevant authorities to act with utmost urgency. Materials, timber, and the like shall be procured within a strict deadline, swiftly assembled without delay or negligence. If you have any further needs, submit them without reservation.\n\nI also request several dozen talismans for dispelling wind afflictions and calming the heart against fright—this would be most welcome.\n\n**Edict Conferring the Title of Master of Serene Harmony**\n\n**Edict to Liu Hun Kang, Mysterious Master of the Baozhen Abbey at Yuanfu Wanning Palace, Mount Mao, Jiangning Prefecture:**\n\nThe sacred realm of the Three Maos is where immortals and sages dwell. Now that the new abbey has been built to honor and revere them, and as your heart wanders in serene detachment, your Dao harmonizes with the primordial and subtle, you are entrusted with its governance to propagate the supreme transformation. It is fitting to bestow upon you a noble title to express my esteem. You are hereby specially appointed **Mysterious Master of Serene Harmony of the Baozhen Abbey**.\n\n**Twenty-third day of the eighth month, fifth year of Chongning.**\n*Executed by Li Tunan, Vice Director of the Secretariat.*\n\n---\n\n**Edict to Liu Hun Kang:**\n\nYou, sir, have devoted yourself to the teachings of the Mysterious Origin, your heart dwelling in purity and stillness. You have delved into the profound mysteries of the Cavern of Truth and concealed yourself upon the peaks of Mount Mao. Now, you have returned to your former abode, where wondrous marvels abound, and erected a grand new sanctuary, greatly magnifying the ancestral tradition. The cinnabar terraces gleam resplendent, expounding the pivotal Dao of Mount Kongtong; the purple palaces are renewed, emulating the lofty footsteps of the vast and boundless. As the illustrated plans reveal its splendor, the emperor’s true journey is proclaimed. Your diligence in reverence is thus further manifested, and the beauty of its completion is celebrated. My joy overflows, and it should inspire songs of praise.\n\nA scroll of the **Imperially Composed Ode on the Abbey’s Completion** is now sent to you by courier—you should receive it with gratitude.\n\nAs the high autumn air turns crisp, I trust you remain in good health. This missive conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\n---\n\n**Imperially Composed Ode on the Completion of Yuanfu Wanning Abbey**\n\nAt the foot of Mount Mao, during the Yuanfu era, an abbey was built upon the hermitage of Liu Hun Kang, named the Yuanfu Abbey. Construction began in the autumn of the first year and was completed in the autumn of the fifth year of Chongning. Its plaque was inscribed in grand script, and it was renamed **Yuanfu Wanning Abbey**, to fulfill the will of Emperor Zhezong, pacify the luminous spirits, revere the wondrous Dao, and enlighten posterity. Thus, I compose this ode:\n\nUpon the peaks of Mount Juqu,\nThere stands a dwelling.\nWho is this man?\nHe embodies the primordial before the Emperor.\nHe enlightens those who come after,\nRefining his person.\nAbiding in stillness with sincerity,\nHe preserves the true.\n\nIn the Yuanfu era of old,\nA chamber was built beneath.\nIts construction was unhurried,\nLeft for those to come.\nI have received this legacy,\nContinuing its thread.\nI have followed its design,\nRestoring these halls.\nSurveying this abbey,\nIt befriends the heart,\nCompleted without delay.\nTo aid those who follow,\nI augment its name,\nCalling it **Wanning**,\nInscribing it upon the plaque,\nTo pacify the luminous spirits.\n\nThe Dao is vast and without bounds,\nIts essence and function constant.\nIn virtue, it is imperial;\nIn deeds, it is kingly.\nAdvancing in this Dao,\nOne becomes one with it without end.\nMay the spirits heed this,\nAnd bring harmony to all under heaven.\n\n*Written in the bingxu year of Chongning, inscribed in the Xuanhe Hall.*\n\n---\n\nSince our parting in early summer, nearly half a year has passed. Though separated by distance, my longing for your presence weighs heavily upon me. Each time I raise my gaze, I am moved to sigh at the length of the journey. Since your return to the mountain, my admiration has only deepened. I have composed a poem to express my sentiments, which is now sent to you along with this missive—please acknowledge its receipt.\n\nI yearn for our conversation, yet the time for meeting remains distant. As the golden winds approach, may the harmony of heaven preserve your well-being. The talismans have been received; I now request several more for wearing.\n\nThe bestowal of grace has already been enacted—may you be aware of this.\n\n---\n\n**Imperially Composed and Inscribed Poem on the Return of Mysterious Master of Serene Harmony to the Mountain**\n\nIn those years, you sought the Dao from a lofty master,\nOnce donning the rosy clouds to reach the purple court.\nYour body is a minstrel beyond the three mountains,\nYour heart untouched by a speck of worldly dust.\nThe migrating geese gaze into the distance, your secluded dwelling far,\nThe swallows of congratulation return to the newly built grotto abode.\nI thank you for transmitting the wonders of the heart’s method—\nBeyond this truth, there is no other truth.\n\n*First day of the ninth month, fifth year of Chongning. Composed and inscribed by imperial hand.*\n\n---\n\n**Edict to Liu Hun Kang:**\n\nYour repeated memorials have been received in full. Your Dao is as lofty as the two Xus, your virtue spans the three Maos. As the patriarch of the teachings and a master who propagates the true wind to aid all beings, you humbly decline the imperial carriage and dwell in the renowned mountains. Though our meetings are rare, I long for the profound words of your pure and refined character.\n\nEach time you present your memorials, your earnest devotion is deeply appreciated. All the matters you have requested have been enacted. Your disciples have been bestowed the fine title of **Ninghe**. The grand stele has been permitted for carving, with the transport bureau overseeing its completion.\n\nNow, in the realm beyond the world, all is at peace; wind and rain arrive in due season. The grace bestowed by the August Emperor brings well-being, aided by your devout cultivation. As the frosty autumn arrives, though our meeting remains distant, I urge you to take care of yourself to ease my longing.\n\nThe **Preface to the Edict** is now sent to you by courier—please receive it with gratitude.\n\nI trust you remain in good health. This missive conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\n*Twelfth day of the tenth month, fifth year of Chongning.*\n\n---\n\nSince our separation, autumn has deepened. I crane my neck toward the south, my thoughts racing. Each time I receive your letters, my longing is greatly soothed. In the emptiness and stillness of the mountains and forests, I imagine your spirit roaming in serene detachment, finding peace.\n\nThe **Poem on Your Return to the Mountain**, the **Ode on the Abbey’s Completion**, and permission to carve them, along with other imperial decrees, are beyond precious. Beyond preserving them in the abbey’s records, guard them as if they were ten thousand times more valuable.\n\n---\n\n**Edict to Liu Hun Kang:**\n\nYour memorial on the merits and virtues for the **Tianning Festival** has been received in full. You nurture your vastness in the mountains and forests, dwelling in truth beyond the world, yet your loyalty is devoted to the state, your aspiration to cherish the sovereign. As the month of his birth approached, you widely partook in the pure rites to offer blessings. Your memorial was presented, and my admiration runs deep. Thus, this edict is issued to inform you. As winter’s chill sets in, I trust you remain in good health. This missive conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\n*Twenty-fourth day of the tenth month, fifth year of Chongning.*\n\n**Edict to Liu Hun Kang:**\n\nYour memorial presenting your petition has been received in full. You dwell in profound stillness, your cultivation of the Dao pure and complete. As winter’s rhythm unfolds, you preserve the harmony of Heaven’s principle. Upon reviewing the tribute and offerings you presented, I have fully understood your earnest pleas.\n\nThat the completion of these meritorious works has not yet received due imperial recognition is a matter for which your detailed account is fitting. Your deliberations are measured and just, and thus your petition is approved in its entirety and shall be put into effect. The **Xuan Yi** agricultural fields are hereby granted as you requested: the **Danyang** embankments and dams shall not be seized or withheld by other offices. All affairs are to be conducted with impartiality, nothing reserved for private gain. Your diligence and devotion move me deeply, and I commend your loyalty.\n\nMay you delight in the constancy of truth and expand the practice of the **Upper Clarity** teachings, that you may extend your blessings to me and forever shelter the realm. This depends on the sincerity of your heart—understand my intent.\n\nThe early cold has set in; I trust you remain in good health. This missive conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\nSince we parted, time has flown like the swift passage of days and months—how could my longing ever be satisfied? Amid the towering white clouds, I imagine you find much that is fine. You recently requested that the poems and eulogies bestowed upon you be inscribed in stone, along with the carved models and the distributed authentic copies—all are to be kept by you personally. If you have further petitions, submit them through the postal relay.\n\nOur next meeting remains uncertain, and my yearning only grows deeper. As winter’s season deepens, guard your health in the Way.\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang: Upon reviewing your memorial regarding the establishment of the Qingcheng Abbey and the manifestation of immortal lamps, I have fully understood the matter. Your heart roams Penglai Isle, and in seated reverence you greet Kongtong; you guard the mysteries of cultivating truth and embracing the One, penetrating to the root and returning to the source of life—thus, at the auspicious Qingcheng retreat, immortal lamps appeared as auspicious signs. This arises from the ascent of pure devotion, filled within by utmost sincerity, and thus felicitous omens gather while the numinous responds in kind. All living beings share in this blessing, and its splendid benefit is beyond words. Since reading your memorial, I have been deeply moved and full of praise.\n\nI have also learned that on a chosen day in mid-winter, you personally journeyed to Yongsheng to perform the burning of yellow talismans. The season is bitterly cold, and the labor cannot have been light. I imagine the crane-borne carriage has now returned you to the mountains, where you draw near to welcome the *Scripture of Longevity* and its virtuous protection.\n\nThe fifth year of Chongning, the eighteenth day of the twelfth month.\n\nSince we parted, winter has swiftly passed. Each time I think of our pure friendship, I can only crane my neck in longing. I have heard that at the abbey, sacred lamps appeared upon Sou Lun Peak—truly a marvel. Had it not been for your profound sincerity moving the unseen, how could such a thing have come to pass? Putting brush to paper only deepens my admiration, though our reunion remains uncertain. My yearning only grows, and I urge you to care for yourself, truly fulfilling my hopes.\n\nI hear that in past years, when you performed the burning of yellow talismans, the cold was severe. Guard your health upon the road. On the day you return to your hermitage, seek out several dozen more [talismans/rites]. As before.\n\nAdmonition to Liu Hun Kang: You steadfastly uphold the true teaching, carefully preserving the celestial mandate. Dwelling in mountain caves, you wander freely; revering the dharma records, you abide in tranquility. Given your profound virtue, it is fitting that you receive praise and honor. Already I have bestowed poems in proclamation, and further expressed my admiration in eulogies. You have submitted a memorial requesting their inscription in stone, and I approve. Your cinnabar sincerity, diligent in jade-like refinement, has moved me to command that the imperial barge convey them to your abbey’s walls. Passed down through disciples, they will shine unfading; through this favor and ritual, my regard will be shown without end. Understand my intent and further exalt the dharma’s teachings.\n\nAs the year wanes and spring approaches, the qi shifts with the turning seasons—redouble your efforts in refining practice and frequently impart the secrets of profound emptiness. I have already dispatched an emissary to personally oversee the stone inscription’s carving; you may receive it accordingly.\n\nIn the depths of winter’s chill, I trust you remain in good health. This brief missive conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\n*Da Guan* 1st year, first month, twenty-seventh day.\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang: You hold fast to the unerring heart, unwavering in the Dao, upholding the dharma’s wellspring upon which all living beings depend. Your meritorious deeds shine resplendent as the sun and stars, and it is through your efforts that the teachings of Supreme Clarity flourish without decline. Herein lies the throne’s contribution.\n\nYet of late, Daoist and Buddhist teachings have become entangled, and right principle demands their distinction. This decree issues from my own resolve to rectify such errors. Consider how the Three Clarities now share space with water-and-land rites, or how the *Yuanming* scriptures are venerated within Buddhist halls—such chaotic depictions and carvings defy enumeration. I am now ordering the restoration of proper ritual norms and the clarification of teachings. By examining the principles of past and present, tracing the origins of entrenched customs, and instructing officials to enforce distinctions in reverence, may all beings receive boundless blessings and protection.\n\nI trust your profound equanimity will align with this judgment. As the new year begins, I hope you remain secure and serene. Let this decree inform you accordingly.\n\nAmidst the cold, I trust you remain well. This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\n*Da Guan* 1st year, second month, ninth day.\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang: Your person embodies purity and depth, your Dao profound, your resolve unshaken, your heart steadfast in goodness. Upon reviewing your memorial, I have fully grasped your sincerest intentions. I further hear that since the new year, your dharma conduct has been peaceful and steadfast.\n\nThe elixir formula you presented, long transmitted as an immortal’s sustenance, though now preserved in the divine crucible’s golden cinnabar, cannot surpass the principles of longevity. Such is its essence—having pondered it carefully, I find my heart gratified. Hold fast to this wondrous art without deviation.\n\nI have sent this decree by courier, accompanied by glad tidings. As spring’s sequence begins, may celestial harmony guard you well. Though parted in speech, the new year has swiftly arrived. I yearn for your exemplary presence, which remains constant morning and night.\n\nIn a recent decree, I addressed the confusion between Daoist and Buddhist teachings, and it has already been enacted. Fearing the details may not have been exhaustive, I now enclose the original text for your review.\n\nAs a leader of your teaching, you are observed and emulated by all. In all transmissions you oversee, preserve and uphold them without negligence.\n\nRegarding the construction of the stone bridge and roads, I have entrusted Commissioner of Transport Zeng Xiaoyun to oversee its completion.\n\nWhen next we meet, take utmost care. As for the talismans of the *Zhenxin Shenfu*, request several dozen more.\n\nShould you observe any omens of fortune or calamity, report them to Master without delay.\n\nDirect Master Zhi to arrive at the beginning of spring.\n\nHave the supplies previously sent to that Daoist sanctuary arrived?\n\nHe who rules all under heaven honors and serves the Supreme Emperor. My decrees are issued with utmost reverence—how dare any treat them with irreverence? Yet the followers of Śākya construct Buddhist rituals, recklessly ranking the Heavenly Emperor among ghosts and spirits. Such blasphemy against the divine order is unparalleled. How can this reflect due reverence for the Supreme Emperor? Command the relevant authorities to investigate and expunge such errors, that it may accord with my solemn awe and veneration.\n\n*Dated the fifteenth day of the second month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\n**Decree to Liu Hun Kang:**\n\nI reverently serve the Three Primordials and honor the Supreme Dao. Ever mindful of the weight of spiritual inheritance, I strive to attain auspicious blessings. Throughout the realm, Daoist temples flourish, gathering eminent masters from distant lands beneath the banner of the Three Mao Peaks. Relying on your teachings, we summon prosperity and rectify disorder.\n\nYou, long steeped in profound and wondrous practice, have repeatedly received felicitous responses. Though the crane-borne carriage has twice conveyed you to my court, your profound discourse on the Dao and inquiry into the essentials of the heart-mind have preserved your spirit in purity and tranquility. Yet your sojourn as a guest, storing up auspiciousness, is hardly fitting. I have already ordered the supervision of artisans to construct a sanctuary at the eastern edge of the Supreme Clarity precincts, establishing a separate retreat named \"Myriad Peace.\" Here, you may dwell in secluded quietude, extending your cloud-plowing cultivation. Select disciples in advance to reside here and take charge. This is hereby decreed; I trust you will take note.\n\nRegarding the matters you memorialized concerning the inconveniences in Daoist teachings and your petitions, as the patriarch of your tradition and the leader of its teachings, all your proposals align with my intentions. Though parted from your lofty counsel, my thoughts turn southward daily. I imagine you amidst incense and flame, dwelling high above the clouds, preserving your spirit and refining your qi—your attainments are surely abundant.\n\nWhen Master Zhu arrives to await the arrival of Huang Mian at the mountain, have them proceed together to the court.\n\nAs spring warms, take care in your Daoist practice.\n\n*Dated the twenty-ninth day of the second month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\n**Decree to Liu Hun Kang:**\n\nI have reviewed your memorial declining the summons to court and understand your circumstances.\n\nI revere the True Primordial and have long honored the Supreme Dao. My regard for those who dwell in truth is ever present, even in dreams. I yearn for your exemplary presence, yet our separation has swiftly passed another year’s end. To converse again would surely yield profound insights. Thus, I dispatched envoys with all haste to urge your arrival. Yet your sealed memorial suddenly arrived, pleading illness and seeking to decline. How could I not be moved? Yet propriety cannot be compelled. For now, I shall suspend the summons and await a more auspicious time. Take care in your rest and recovery, that it may reflect my deep regard.\n\nThe season warms—how is your health of late? This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\nA year has passed since we parted, and my longing has only grown. Having reviewed your two memorials, in which you pleaded illness to decline the summons, I have issued a separate decree granting your request. You should understand this clearly. Remain in seclusion, nurturing your spirit, to preserve your longevity and well-being—your reserves are surely abundant.\n\nRegarding the Daoist sanctuary, I have already responded. Master Chi Yi’s petitions have all been reviewed and implemented. Once further instructions arrive, suspend them, and have Master Zhu proceed to court for an audience. Take care in your travels.\n\nFor the talismans to cure all ailments and ward off wind, request several dozen more.\n\nIn the quiet of night, by lamplight, my thoughts turn to you, Master, and my heart is uneasy.\n\n*Dated the seventh day of the fourth month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\n**Decree to Liu Hun Kang:**\n\nHaving reviewed your repeated memorials, I understand your resolve to abandon worldly affairs and retreat far from the dusty realm. Given your earnest and pressing sincerity, I reluctantly accede to your request for convenience and ease.\n\nI imagine of late your spirit is serene and expansive, your practice lofty and exalted. Dwelling in stillness, you shun worldly distractions; preserving your inner light, you do not display it. Gazing toward you in the wind, I am filled with longing—my yearning is unceasing.\n\nMaster Zhu may set out to proceed to court. If you have any memorials to submit, present them in full without concealment.\n\nEarly summer grows warm—how is your health of late? This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\n*Dated the twenty-seventh day of the fifth month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\nA year has passed since we parted, and my longing has only deepened. Our conversations have never ceased.\n\nYour aspirations are noble, and you shun the clamor of the world, allowing your spirit to settle and your thoughts to quiet, wandering in the vast emptiness. This brings me great comfort, though the distance from your lofty counsel only deepens my admiration.\n\nEarly summer is mild and harmonious—take care in nurturing your Dao.\n\nAt the end of the month, my eyes suddenly grew dim. I promptly sent a letter to Master Chi Yi, ordering him to arrive swiftly. There are several scrolls of scriptures to be sent with him upon his arrival—all written in my own hand.\n\n*End of Scroll Three of the Maoshan Annals*\n\n---\n\n*Scroll Four of the Maoshan Annals*\n*Composed by Liu Dabin, Successor of the Supreme Clarity Tradition*\n\nDeputy Scribal Edict to Song Shao’s Edict, Imperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nOur separation has grown long, and the summer’s glare weighs heavy—yet my thoughts of you have only deepened. I imagine you reclining among the towering clouds and mountains, nurturing your lofty spirit beyond the mundane, moving with ease through the realm of self-attainment. My admiration for you knows no bounds.\n\nIf there are matters you wish to convey, do not hesitate to speak them aloud. Await the swift arrival of my messenger from the west, that I may hear your full intent in person. Whatever you have witnessed there, spare no detail, however trivial, and send it by post. Let no suffering of the people in that region remain unknown to me—this is my earnest hope.\n\nThe summer’s heat rages fiercely; guard well your inner harmony.\n\nMaster Huang has arrived and reported all matters as you instructed. With reverent purification, I have written a sealed memorial and entrusted it to you, Master, to present upon your audience. This would be most fortunate. Once the Celestial Response is received, hasten to report it in full.\n\nI have also instructed Master Chi Yi to deliver to you the memorial from the Noble Consort, which shall accompany him on his return to the mountain.\n\nI send two scrolls of imperial brush paintings—one of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the other of the Most High Dao Lord—along with last year’s painting of the Most High Lord Lao, to form a triad of the Three Pure Ones for your silent veneration. Five volumes of the *Scriptures of the Northern Dipper*, twenty folding fans, ten kinds of fruit, and offerings of incense, flowers, dragon-brain incense, tea, and candles—all have been counted and entrusted to Master Chi Yi. Additionally, fifty blank ordination certificates from the Bureau of Sacrifices, and thirty purple robes. Should you require ordination for disciples, those under Master Chi Yi’s guidance shall be granted purple robes and the title of Master.\n\nFifteen attendants accompanying you shall all receive ordination and gifts of silk, each according to rank.\n\n*Dated the twenty-ninth day of the seventh month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\nThe talismans you have repeatedly bestowed upon me, I dare not keep for myself. If anyone falls ill, I shall administer them, that I may fulfill your intent to heal and save.\n\nI request several dozen more talismans to be sent by post.\n\n---\n\nImperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nI have reviewed your memorial and its appended records, and all is clear to me. I am further informed that your memorial of prayer has reached the celestial realm, and that you have received the profound and secret responses. My admiration runs deep.\n\nHad you not awakened to the wondrous subtleties of the inner vision, aligning with the Dao to nurture the true, and devoted your thoughts to the welfare of the people with such sincere and silent devotion, how could such attainment have been possible? My joy is beyond measure.\n\nAs summer turns to autumn, your blessings only grow. In the intervals between my myriad duties, I often turn to the essentials of the Dao, and my longing to hear your words is as urgent as thirst for sweet water.\n\nSpring is not far off; I expect your arrival from the west. Do not let modesty keep you from fulfilling my deepest wishes.\n\nThe autumn air is crisp and solemn. I trust you are well. My words here are few, but my thoughts of you are constant.\n\nLong have I been deprived of your virtuous presence; I can only strive to draw nearer to it.\n\nYour recent memorials, received by post, speak of your serene and abundant cultivation in seclusion. All matters you have reported through Master Jing shall be examined and acted upon.\n\nNext spring, you shall come to court. Further instructions will be sent; I shall not elaborate here.\n\nWhen spring waters rise, take a small boat west. Do not resist my will.\n\nAs autumn wanes and frost descends, guard your health above all else.\n\n*Dated the fifth day of the ninth month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\nImperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nI have reviewed your memorial offering prayers for the Celestial Tranquility Festival. All is understood.\n\nAs the early winter season approaches the imperial birthday, you shall conduct solemn rites upon the jade altar, invoking boundless blessings for the empire. That one beyond the world should not forget his devotion to the throne is a loyalty most commendable. My admiration only grows.\n\nThus, I issue this decree, that you may know my thoughts.\n\nEarly winter finds you well, I trust. My words here are few.\n\n*Dated the fourteenth day of the tenth month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\nOur separation has been long, and my longing for you is constant. I rejoice to hear that your Dao is pure and your conduct untroubled.\n\nRegarding your memorial declining the summons to court at the year’s beginning, I have not yet granted your request. I truly wish to see you again, to receive your guidance. Our parting has been too long, and your repeated refusals, though earnest, seem almost a rejection. Yet the waters flow gently—what hardship would there be in coming?\n\nAfter the New Year, another decree shall be issued. For now, tend well to your celestial harmony.\n\nNext spring, I shall send an envoy to summon you. Do not refuse or resist my command.\n\n---\n\nImperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nI have reviewed your recent memorials. All is understood.\n\nYou dwell in the seclusion of Mount Mao, nurturing the true beyond the mundane, moving with ease and contentment. Your every action is blessed. Your offerings and words have reached me, and my admiration for your devotion is profound.\n\nThough the subtleties of your discourse remain distant, my thoughts ever turn to you.\n\nI have repeatedly issued edicts summoning you to court next spring. Yet you delay, reluctant to engage with worldly affairs, preferring to nurture your lofty spirit. I urge you to set aside your resolve and grace me with your presence, rather than persist in defiance of my wishes.\n\nConsider well my regard for you, and do not disregard my words.\n\nAs winter begins, guard your inner harmony.\n\nThe cold has set in; I trust you are well. My words here are few.\n\n*Dated the ninth day of the tenth month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\nYour memorial regarding the elevation of the titles of the Three Mao Lords has been reviewed and approved according to ritual precedent. You shall be informed of the details.\n\nAt the year’s beginning, you must come to court. Do not refuse my command.\n\nWhat I seek is only your intimate and profound presence.\n\nAs winter’s severity grows, take utmost care of yourself.\n\nI request several dozen more talismans; your kindness would be deeply felt.\n\nThe affairs of the palace gates are ever on my mind—how could I not be concerned?\n\n---\n\nImperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nYour keen insight into the true mechanism of the Dao shines with the radiance of the highest Way. Every memorial you submit resonates deeply with my heart.\n\nYour earnest petition for the ennoblement of the Three Mao Lords, in reverence for the Dao, is most fitting. I shall instruct the relevant offices to bestow upon them the most illustrious titles.\n\nYou are hereby granted these honors; receive them accordingly.\n\n*[Missing character] month: may you preserve your well-being.*\n\nHow I long for the day when the rivers swell and your journey is unhindered! My thoughts of you are unceasing.\n\nAs spring approaches, I eagerly await your arrival. Travel by boat without hesitation.\n\nWhen the season of growth arrives, refine your spirit with utmost clarity.\n\nThe winter is cold; I trust you are well. My words here are few.\n\nSince we parted, how have your days been? When your divine canopy travels east, I think of you often, and cannot help but sigh.\n\nThe life of clouds and waters brings boundless joy in carefree detachment, truly the endless bliss of transcending the world. I long to discuss the subtleties with you, and eagerly await your arrival next spring. Until then, take care to preserve your well-being and nurture your spirit. May all be well.\n\n*Great Observation, first year, intercalary tenth month, twenty-first day.*\n\nDecree to Liu Hunkang:\nYour repeated memorials have been received in full. Your diligence is unceasing—it is as if I were conversing with you in person. How fare your meals and rest as the seasons turn? When next spring comes and you sail westward by boat, our profound discourse may at last be realized. The talismans requested by the Noble Consort shall be provided. Until then, tend well to your health.\n\nThe portraits of the Three Mao Lords are complete; they await only your arrival at court to be presented to you in person. You have requested dozens of talismans for healing and wearing—these shall be granted.\n\n*Great Observation, first year, eleventh month, sixth day.*\n\nDecree to Liu Hunkang:\nYour memorial regarding your journey to court next spring has been reviewed in full. Though you have frequently graced the imperial palace, you now hasten to return to the mountains. Yet across two years, your devotion has never waned. I hear you will sail westward at the onset of spring, and this deeply resonates with my heart. I long to discuss the profound and expound the subtle; prepare yourself by purifying your mind and fasting in anticipation. I have dispatched envoys to arrange your travel by boat, permitting you to take the most convenient route for a safe and swift journey. Make haste with your preparations to ease this longing. Our meeting draws near—take care to safeguard your well-being.\n\nI have appointed the *Inner Western Capital Left Storehouse Commissioner*, *Director of the Palace Chariot Service under the Court of Imperial Regalia*, and *Drafter of the Dragon Diagram, Celestial Chapters, Treasure Texts, and Illustrious Model Pavilion*, Huang Xisou, to deliver this decree and summon you to court.\n\nThe spring is cold; I trust you are well. My words here are few.\n\nWith the new year ushering in spring, may you follow the seasons in harmony and peace. Your requests have all been granted and will be implemented one by one as desired. If you come from Jingkou, it would be most convenient, and I long to see you even in my dreams. When Huang Xisou arrives, do not delay in the slightest—take advantage of the spring waters. May your journey be free of obstruction. If anything is needed or lacking, report it without hesitation.\n\nI have already prepared an exhortation; little more need be said here. Once Huang Xisou arrives, hasten your departure.\n\n*Decree to Liu Hunkang, the fifth day of the first month of the second year of Daguan.*\n\nYou have recently recovered from a minor illness, and I trust your convalescence has been skillful, sparing you the need for medicine. Upon reading your recent memorial, I see you exerted yourself to attend court despite your condition—your diligence and unwavering loyalty are deeply commendable. Since reviewing your words, I have been filled with admiration.\n\nWhen Huang Xisou arrives, prepare swiftly to embark, riding the spring currents westward. Pass through the commanderies and counties without delay. I have arranged the Crane Pavilion to welcome you and engage in pure discourse. As the season warms, take care to nurture yourself well.\n\n*Mid-spring, I trust you are well. My words here are few.*\n\n*The fifteenth day of the second month of the second year of Daguan.*\n\nThe spring skies are clear and bright, your immortal boat at rest—do not neglect to cultivate your vast and serene qi, for it is truly fulfilling. If you require anything, coordinate with Huang Xisou upon his arrival; I have already made arrangements for our meeting. Until then, prioritize your recovery above all.\n\n*Decree to Liu Hunkang:*\n\nYour heart remains profound and still, your virtue nurtured in harmony. Each time you approach the imperial palace, your counsel is abundant and enlightening. Yet, without hearing your discourse on the Dao, years of my own rustic ignorance have resurfaced.\n\nI have dispatched envoys to hasten your journey—set aside your wanderings among the white clouds and come attend the purple halls of court. All instructions have been conveyed in prior decrees. Understand my earnest longing and do not delay further.\n\nI have appointed *Inner Court Artisan of Literary Thought*, *Director of the Palace Chariot Service under the Court of Imperial Regalia*, and *Drafter of the Dragon Diagram, Celestial Chapters, Treasure Texts, and Illustrious Model Pavilion*, Huang Xisou, to oversee the boats and summon you from Maoshan to court.\n\nLet this be known to you.\n\n*The spring is warm; I trust you are well. My words here are few.*\n\nHow fervently I long for our meeting—what could be more pressing? By my calculations, you will surely arrive at the capital in the first ten days of the fourth month. The spring waters flow smoothly; I expect no obstacles. Along the way, distance yourself from worldly affairs. Each day, turn your thoughts eastward in anticipation. When you near Bian, report your arrival at once.\n\nUntil we meet, take the utmost care.\n\n*Conferred the posthumous title of Grand Master for Thorough Counsel.*\n\nIn Our consideration of the age of utmost virtue, the myriad things transform in the profound without action, and the hundred clans are settled in stillness. Following this Dao, We guide the people into great harmony. Sincere intent moves in resonance, and extraordinary persons arrive from afar. The rites of Our regard have been extended to their fullest from beginning to end.\n\nTo Master Liu Hun Kang of Baozhen Abbey, Observer of the Subtle and Preserver of Primal Harmony: you embrace the One and guard the Real, pure and unblemished in self-attainment. Foreseeing fortune and misfortune, you awaken the deluded masses; at times manifesting in talismanic breath, you cure the multitudes of their ailments. Though your body dwells in the forests and valleys, your name resounds in the capital. We have admired and marveled at you, summoning you to court for leisurely audiences, where We have repeatedly heard your profound discourses, deeply resonating with Our heart. Recently, you again came to court, residing in the Jade Pavilion, where you effortlessly submitted to transformation, in unspoken accord with Us. Reflecting on your steadfast devotion, it is fitting to bestow honor upon you. Thus, We confer the rank of Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, equivalent to that of a Remonstrating Censor. This exceptional grace is granted in anticipation of further offerings. We posthumously confer upon you the title of Grand Master for Thorough Counsel.\n\n**Epithet \"Jingyi\" (Tranquil Unity) Decree:**\nWe reflect upon the cavern by the winding stream, which lies north of Mount Tai and south of Mount Luofu. It bears witness to the scriptural registers of the River Chart and is renowned as the \"Lung of the Earth.\" Embracing the Dao within its sacred precincts, it was once the refuge of lofty recluses. The true wind has not been forgotten, and the traces of the past remain evident.\n\nTo the late Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Liu Hun Kang: you stood beyond the dust of worldly entanglements, taking emptiness and stillness as your foundation. You observed the subtle upon the altar of metal and jade, preserving your radiance in the earth where jade is buried. You admired the true wind of the Southern Marchmount and glimpsed the profound mysteries of the Western City. Though the multitudes sought you, you departed as if shedding a cicada’s husk. We now bestow a laudable epithet to honor your memory.\n\nMay this serve to illuminate the merit of the Orthodox Unity, and may it inspire the flourishing of the teachings of Primal Emptiness in times to come. We hereby posthumously bestow the epithet \"Jingyi\" (Tranquil Unity).\n\n---\n\n**Decree Granting the Name \"Yuanfu Wanning Abbey\":**\n**Memorandum from the Ministry of Rites:**\nTo the Maoshan Yuanfu Abbey of Jiangning Prefecture and the Maoshan Yuanfu Temple: By imperial decree, you are to be renamed \"Yuanfu Wanning Abbey.\" Upon receipt of this memorandum, comply with the decree accordingly.\n\nMemorandum issued on the __ day of the first month of the fifth year of the Chongning era.\n*Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Acting Minister of the Right, Deng; Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Acting Minister of the Left, He; Minister of Works, Right Grand Councilor.*\n\n---\n\n**Decree for Rewards to Officials Overseeing the Construction of Yuanfu Wanning Abbey:**\nObserving the blessed lands, We have established this abbey to guide the people in welcoming the radiant essence. The Hanlin Academician and Left Court Gentleman for Discussion, Hu Shiwen, and others have diligently fulfilled their duties, bringing this project to completion. In recognition of your meritorious efforts, We promote you in rank. As a timely reward, We hereby appoint you as Grand Master for Palace Leisure, retaining your current post and duties.\n\nTo Jiangdong Circuit Transport Commissioner, Gentleman for Announcement of Righteousness, Qiao: you are hereby promoted to Gentleman for Propagation of Virtue, retaining your current post and duties.\n\nTo Gentleman for Service, Magistrate of Jurong County, Bao Shen Ci: you are hereby promoted to Gentleman for Announcement of Righteousness, retaining your current post and duties.\n\nTo Right Attendant-in-Ordinary, Supervisor of Jiangning Prefecture’s Embankments, Gao Shi Qian: you are hereby promoted to Left Attendant-in-Ordinary.\n\nTo West Head Attendant-in-Ordinary, Gao Gong Ding: you are hereby promoted to East Head Attendant-in-Ordinary.\n\nTo Probationary Official, Zhang He: you are hereby promoted to Attendant-in-Ordinary.\n\nTo Commissioner, Ye Cheng: you are hereby promoted to Probationary Official.\n\nTo Three Divisions Commissioner, Meng Zhong: you are hereby promoted within the Three Divisions.\n\nTo Probationary Official and Magistrate, Bao Shen: you are exempted from the triennial evaluation for three years.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Decree:**\nThe construction of the Hidden Spirit Hermitage and other structures at the Yuanfu Wanning Abbey of Jiangning Prefecture’s Maoshan, as well as the installation of the imperial calligraphy plaques, are matters of no small importance. The following officials overseeing the project are to be rewarded accordingly:\n\nVice Commissioner Liu He: promoted one rank.\nJiangning Prefecture Administrator Fan Xi Yi: granted exemption from the triennial evaluation for three years. Upon completion of your current term, you are to be reappointed.\n\nAmong the project supervisors, Palace Attendant of the Inner Chambers, Sun Ming Yi: promoted one rank.\n\n---\n\n**Decree Granting the Name \"Zangzhen Abbey\":**\n**Memorandum from the Ministry of Rites:**\nTo the Jiangning Prefecture Zangzhen Abbey, the former residence and burial site of the late Liu Hun Kang, now a Daoist abbey: By imperial decree, you are hereby granted the name \"Zangzhen Abbey.\" Upon receipt of this memorandum, comply with the decree accordingly.\n\nMemorandum issued on the __ day of the __ month of the second year of the Daguan era.\n*Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Acting Minister of the Left, Yu; Grand Preceptor, Left Grand Councilor.*\n\n---\n\n**Decree for the Posthumous Enfeoffment of Lu Xiujing as \"True Man\":**\nWe reflect upon the lofty recluses of antiquity, whose names have not faded, yet whose titles were not commensurate with their virtue. It is fitting to posthumously honor them.\n\nThe Master of Simplicity, Lu Xiujing, attained true essence within and bequeathed scriptures as a model for posterity, transcending the world with effortless grace. His former hermitage on Mount Lu remains, and upon verification, We now bestow upon him the title of \"True Man.\" This is not merely to honor his past footsteps but also to inspire those who hear of him to recognize the path of the Dao and strive accordingly.\n\nWe hereby posthumously enfeoff him as \"True Man of Cinnabar Prime.\"\n\n---\n\n**Decrees for the Enfeoffment of Five True Men:**\n**Decree:**\nWe reside in the celestial palace, gazing upon the Terrace of the Azure Dragon, beholding the divine realm of the Three Blossoms and aspiring to the wondrous teachings of the Nine Flowers. Revering the footsteps of the assembled immortals, We illuminate their transformative merit.\n\nTo Yang, True Man and Upper Assistant of the Eastern Flower and Director of Destinies: you have delved deeply into learning, exploring the subtle, and aligning your heart with the vast. You have received the hidden instructions of the Central Yellow and the secret transmissions of the Southern Perfected. Governing the lands of Wu and Yue, you oversee the essentials of the divine spirits. As you propagate the supreme Dao, it is fitting to bestow upon you a lofty title. May this reflect Our profound regard and perpetuate the blessings of Our favor.\n\nWe hereby enfeoff you as \"True Man of Penetrating Spirit and Manifest Transformation.\"\n\n**Decree:**\nThe Three Blacks conceal the numinous, defying the measure of names and words; the myriad spirits coalesce in transformation, beyond the reach of analogy. In bestowing honors upon the perfected, We indeed expand the supreme Dao.\n\nTo Guo, True Man and Attendant Gentleman of the Jade Terrace: your merit spans the Ten Poles, and your rank resides among the Nine Palaces. Holding the Jade Token of Radiance, you soar through the Great Ultimate; supporting the Morning Canopy of the Eastern Flower, you attend the August Emperor of the Void. As you greatly propagate the fundamental principles, it is fitting to confer upon you a distinguished title. May this reflect Our profound regard and eternally protect Our flourishing enterprise.\n\nWe hereby enfeoff you as \"True Man of the Great Tenuity and Preserved Radiance.\"\n\n**Decree:**\nWe descend to the Jade Realm of the Assembled Perfected, ascending the Dragon Terrace of the Azure Radiance. Here, We examine the records of the primordial shoulder and aid the living in the mortal realm.\n\nThose who have rendered service to the Dao’s virtues shall all advance in rank within the lineage of immortals. The Shangqing True Man and Senior Archivist Xu: outwardly refined and pure, inwardly attaining numinous clarity. His spirit-voice flows in elegant harmony, secretly accompanying the wanderings of the host of sages; his reverent carriage soars beyond the distant, loftily aiding the governance of the Shangqing. As he spreads the Net of Brahmā across the Great Vastness, it is fitting to exalt him with a title of virtue and power. May this manifest the presence of abundant protection and further expand the transformation of non-action.\n\nWe hereby enfeoff you as \"True Man of the Great Primordial and Vast Virtue.\"\n\n**Decree:**\nThough the Purple Ultimate embraces the Primordial, it suddenly emerges from a single darkness; though the Cinnabar Terrace arrays its registers, it truly encompasses the myriad perfected. Those whom We honor with rank in the immortal lineage do so to magnify their merit in the Dao’s beginning. The Attendant Gentleman of the Eastern Flower and Shangqing Immortal Duke Xu True Man: he delves into the Three Spirits to contemplate the wondrous, coalesces the Nine Wefts to bring forth life. When the Northern Grotto announced his end, he naturally followed the portion of the hidden man; when the Eastern Flower ascended in radiance, he alone transcended the wanderings of the supreme ministers. Though he has loftily withdrawn from worldly renown, how could he dare forget the shelter of benevolence?\n\nMay he ever await the profound protection and further unfold the fundamental principles.\n\nWe hereby enfeoff you as \"True Man of the Blended Transformation and Primordial Unity.\"\n\n**Decree:**\nWe, bearing the radiant mandate of the Jade Firmament and grasping the precious tally of the Dragon Han, shall broadly propagate the numinous voice, exalt and expand the Dao’s transformation, elucidate the subtle words of the supreme teaching, and offer felicitous destiny to the host of perfected. The Director of Waters for Penglai, Tao the Recluse: he stirs the near and gathers the distant, cleanses his essence in the Flowery Gate; his spirit communes without encumbrance, though dwelling in the mountains, he is ever close to the edge; his sincerity moves with long-standing resonance, and his poetic gifts have already immortalized him upon the sea. Considering the unparalleled nature of his virtue and power, how could he dare forget the wondrous shelter?\n\nMay he ever enjoy the glory of this distinguished title and forever receive the blessings of nurtured life.\n\nWe hereby enfeoff you as \"True Man of the Lineage-Founding and Resplendent Teaching.\"\n\nOn the third day of the eighth month in the sixth year of the Xuanhe era, the Grand Preceptor and Duke of Ye, Minister Jie Xuan, and the Vice Director of the Right, Palace Attendant and Minister of the Secretariat Zhang Bangchang. Minister of the Secretariat Zhang Zhixing.\n\nBy imperial decree as above, upon receipt of this document, let it be implemented accordingly.\n\nA petition to enfeoff the Five True Ones:\nYour servant, in all humility, lays bare his earnest plea, though it may offend the august dignity of the throne. Upon reflection, I recognize my own lowly inadequacy, yet willingly submit to the court’s statutes.\n\nI venture to observe that since antiquity, those who attained the Dao and ascended to True Being have succeeded one another as objects of the age’s reverence, each taking the support of the world and the establishment of the Teaching as their personal duty. After the Three Mao True Lords ascended in flight, there followed Yang, Guo, and the Two Xus. All these Perfected Ones cultivated the Supreme Dao in concentrated refinement at Juqu, where the Heavenly Perfected descended to bestow their regard and personally transmit secret instructions, and the teachings of the Shangqing scriptures gradually spread among humankind. By the time of the Liang and Song dynasties, the True Wind had grown faint and sluggish, yet the sagely Dao remained unbroken, like a sash. Only Master Tao the Recluse strove to uphold the Teaching with subtle words, elucidating the profound purport of the Dao’s essentials, to the fortune of all under heaven in later ages. Yet while the Three Mao brothers were recently honored and ennobled by the court with sacred titles, the remaining Perfected Ones have not, to my knowledge, received any such distinction.\n\nIn my foolishness, I humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to confer upon the Perfected Ones Yang, Guo, Xu, and Tao—following the precedent of the Three Mao True Lords—augmented and exalted titles in their present immortal offices. A separate memorial will set forth the ranks of the various immortals for Your Majesty’s consideration. Should this petition meet with Your gracious assent, I beg that a sagely edict be issued, directing the relevant authorities to carry it out.\n\nI presumptuously trespass upon Your Celestial Majesty’s awe-inspiring dignity; I await Your command.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Xuanhe reign, on the ___ day of the seventh month, Ding Anxing, Registrar of the Azure Firmament Bureau, Concurrent Supervisor of the Right Section of the Daoist Registry, and Administrator of the Jade Dawn Abbey in Jiangning Prefecture, respectfully submits this memorial.\n\n**Imperial Grant of Honorific Title to Wang Jingsi**\nWang Jingsi has trodden the Dao with purity and reverence, his conduct lofty and unsullied. Favored across three reigns, We too have extended him due courtesy. Let him be granted the title *True Man of Empty Serenity*.\n\n**Imperial Edict for Master Yi Rugang**\n*Memorial from the Ministry of Rites:*\nYi Rugang, Left and Right Street Supervisor of the Daoist Registry, Director of Religious Affairs, Superintendent of the Supreme Unity Palace, and Senior Master, petitions as follows: This humble rustic, once dwelling on Mount Mao, was graciously summoned in the first year of the Qingyuan reign to serve as Senior Master and Superintendent of the Supreme Unity Palace, charged with leading prayers. Through the intercession of lords and ministers, his petitions for state and people have never failed to move the divine, spanning over thirty years—yet his Daoist rank remains unadvanced. In the sixth year of the Jiading reign, he was specially granted the title *Master of Penetrating Mystery*. Later, in the fourteenth year of the same reign, he received an imperial mandate to offer incense and conduct rites on Mount Mao. Upon completion, he memorialized to retire and return to the mountain. We issued an imperial rescript: \"Senior Master Yi Rugang has rendered meritorious service in prayer; he shall not retire yet. To honor his devotion, let him be granted the augmented title *Master of Penetrating Mystery and Preserving the True*.\" Now, he respectfully presents two scrolls of imperial calligraphy bestowed by Emperor Ningzong, beseeching the Ministry of Rites to issue an edict in recognition, thereby ennobling the sacred mountain and enhancing its role in prayer. Awaiting your decree.\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of the Baoqing reign, by imperial command, the Ministry of Rites is ordered to issue the edict.\n*Edict:* Let Yi Rugang be granted the title *Master of Penetrating Mystery and Preserving the True*. Memorial received and approved. Edict hereby issued on the ___ day of the seventh month in the first year of the Baoqing reign.\n\n**Jade Tablet Inscription for the Golden Register Dragon Offering**\nIn the first year of the Jiaxi reign, cyclical year *dingyou*, on the twenty-sixth day of the ninth month (the first day being *jiyou*), the filial imperial heir, Your subject Yun, humbly prays for the perpetuation of the state’s destiny and the blessing of an heir. With reverent devotion, he presents incense and conducts the *Chongke* rites. Twenty-one Daoist masters are commanded to perform the *Lingbao* Daoist ritual at the Yuanfu Wanning Abbey in Jiankang Prefecture for one day and two nights, concluding with a grand offering to the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions. Thereby, he petitions Heaven and Earth, invoking auspicious omens. Following ancient precedent, he respectfully deposits a golden dragon and jade tablet at the Hua Yang Grotto-Heaven of the Supreme Clarity Altar. May the Most Sacred and True perceive this sincere offering and deign to transmit it to the Nine Heavens.\n\nYour subject Yun, reflecting that the crown prince’s position remains vacant, with no propitious dream yet manifest, and that border defenses are strained, troops still deployed—within, he seeks to strengthen the state’s foundation; without, he yearns to pacify the scourge of war. Mindful of the arduous accumulation of our ancestral legacy and the pressing fear of succession, he now offers this grand sacrifice to the Supreme Emperor and beseeches the sacred mountains. May they bestow their encompassing benevolence and mighty sustaining power: grant a son to fulfill the *Zhen* and *Suo* omens, extending the dynasty’s line for a hundred generations; still the weapons of war to achieve great peace, securing governance in all four quarters; fortify the foundations of the state and bring tranquility to the people. May we forever draw near to this divine favor and rely upon the great creation.\n\nYour subject Yun, with utmost sincerity, prostrates himself in prayer.\n\n**Edict for the Ennoblement of the Dragon Spirit of the Guangji Temple**\n*Edict to the Marquis of Broad Blessings and Responsive Aid:*\nThe dragon’s essence is formless, its spirit boundless—yet even the humble earthworms of Mount Mao, dwelling place of perfected beings, possess the power to inhale and exhale. How much more, then, should one who has basked in the sun and moon of cinnabar favor become a vessel of numinous efficacy? The authorities have attested to its merits: timely rains and sunshine, the nurturing of crops. Truly, it fulfills the principles of sacrifice. Let its title be expanded and ennobled to enhance its glory. As Jinling is Our auxiliary capital, its duties are profound, its service extending to the domains of the marquis and the royal domain. Let it be specially enfeoffed as the *Marquis of Broad Blessings, Responsive Aid, and Beneficent Salvation*.\n\nBy edict as above. Upon receipt, comply accordingly.\nIssued on the ___ day of the ___ month in the fourth year of the Chunyou reign.\n\n**Imperial Edict on the Ennoblement of the Three Mao Perfected Lords**\n\n**Edict:** We have heard that perfected beings ride the wind and mount the qi, their spirits roaming beyond the eight limits. Yet when their thoughts turn to the living, they remain ever-present. The *Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery, Wondrous Dao, and Serene Emptiness; Upper Minister of Mount Tai; Divine Lord of Life and Destiny*—having attained the Dao on Mount Mao and ascended the registers of the immortal courts—stands foremost among the Three Lords. Their miraculous efficacy has been manifest through the ages, and near and far, they are revered as the Divine Lord of Life and Destiny. Moved by Our ceaseless admiration for the common folk, We have commanded the authorities to expand their honorific titles, that their veneration may be made manifest. Let him be specially enfeoffed as the *Perfected Lord of Supreme Mystery, Wondrous Dao, Serene Emptiness, and Sagely Protection; Upper Minister of Mount Tai; Divine Lord of Life and Destiny*.\n\n**Edict:** We have heard that the three peaks of Mount Mao, where the divine lords reveal themselves in such splendor, have earned the name *Golden Altar Grotto-Heaven*, a site of reverence through the ages—how could this be true only in Our time? The *Perfected Lord of the Right Register of Destinies, Supreme Dao, and Tranquil Emptiness*, having cultivated the Dao and attained perfection, is known as the Middle Mao. Timely rains and sunshine respond to prayers, and near and far, his virtue is extolled. We command the expansion of his title to reciprocate this great favor. Let him embody Our intent and evermore conceal his blessings among the people. Let him be specially enfeoffed as the *Perfected Lord of the Right Register of Destinies, Supreme Dao, Tranquil Emptiness, and Virtuous Protection*.\n\n**Edict:** We have heard that Emperor Wu of Han once worshipped the Divine Lord within the palace precincts, his invocations kept most secret, that blessings might be fully bestowed. We do not follow such ways. The *Perfected Lord of the Three Offices, Preserver of Life, Subtle Mystery, and Serene Grace*, whose true wind and Dao-qi are known as the Lesser Mao Lord, has long been revered in prayers and sacrifices, his titles exalted through the ages. Now, We command the expansion of his title to manifest Our earnest admiration and to further extend his benevolence among the living. Let him be specially enfeoffed as the *Perfected Lord of the Three Offices, Preserver of Life, Subtle Mystery, Serene Grace, and Benevolent Protection*.\n\nBy edict as above. Upon receipt, comply accordingly.\nIssued on the ___ day of the third month in the ninth year of the Chunyou reign.\n\n**Signatories:**\nGrand Tutor, Left Chancellor, Duke of Wei, Qingzhi;\nRight Chancellor, Kui;\nParticipant in Government Affairs, Xian;\nParticipant in Government Affairs, Fangshu;\nMinister of Personnel, [vacant];\nActing Minister of War, Qingsou.\n\n**Imperial Gifts:**\nOne gold-traced sandalwood *ruyi* scepter, presented to the Great Mao Lord.\nTwo white jade tablets, presented to the Middle and Lesser Mao Lords.\nTwelve sacred images bearing standards, canopies, and other regalia;\nFifty taels of sandalwood;\nFive taels of borneol;\nOne hundred taels of silver;\nTwo bolts of green brocade, each twenty feet in length;\nFifty cakes of new tea;\nOne hundred thousand strings of official currency—\nall bestowed upon Chongxi Abbey on Mount Mao.\n\n**Memorial on the Ennoblement of the Three Mao Lords**\n*Xie Zhong*, Grand Master for Palace Attendance, Bearer of the Golden Seal, Military Commissioner of Baokang Prefecture, Supervisor of the Palace Eunuchs, Director of the Bureau of Imperial Sacrifices, and Overseer of Yousheng Abbey; *Zhang*, Daoist Master of the Left Street, Perfected Master of Mystic Response, and Master of the Void and White Studio at Yousheng Abbey; *Gao*, Administrator of the Daoist Teachings; *Situ Shitan*, respectfully memorializes: Having prayed for three years and witnessed the subtle responses of divine favor, he petitions that the imperial grace be bestowed in the form of ennobled titles for the Three Mao Perfected Lords. The memorial is approved.\n\n**Edict of Yuanzhao**\nThe August Emperor Shizu summoned Daoist Master Jiang Zhao:\nBy the Mandate of Heaven, the Emperor’s sacred decree is issued to Jiang Zongying, the thirty-eighth-generation lineage master of Mount Mao in Jiankang Prefecture: We have heard of your advanced years, your virtue, and the precision of your ritual observances, and We desire to receive your discourse on the Dao. We now dispatch an envoy by post-horse to summon you to the imperial court. The authorities are commanded to provide escort in accordance with the rites. Proceed without delay, and let no hardship befall you.\n\nHereby this edict is proclaimed for due observance and understanding. Dated the second month of the eighteenth year of Zhiyuan.\n\n**Golden Register Ritual Text**\nOn the third day of the fifth month in the gengxu year of the third Zhida era, Wang Daomeng, the Perfected Lord Yuanjing of Supreme Clarity, Grand Cavern Sutra-Lineage Master of the Three Caverns, and Unsurpassed Dharma Master, reverently received the sacred edict of the Emperor. Reflecting that in the governance of state and family, one bears the weight of Heaven’s creative power—how vast, how profound—how could one dare forget the sincerity of prayer and gratitude? Thus, with sealed words, he knocks in reverence upon the famed mountains, that blessings may forever extend through the radiant destiny of the realm.\n\nHe respectfully dispatches Hao Quanjie, Perfected Lord of Mysterious Virtue and Vast Dao, Successor Master of the Mysterious Teachings and Overseer of Daoist Affairs in Jianghuai, Jingxiang, and other regions, to proceed with incense and offerings to the Supreme Clarity Ancestral Altar of the Yuanfu Wanning Palace on Mount Mao. There, he shall conduct the Golden Register Precious Retreat for three days and nights, concluding with the grand dispersal of a Pure Offering to the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions of the Three Realms.\n\nMay the Emperor’s nurturing care remain impartial, his divine gaze ever luminous; may Heaven endure and Earth abide, with the Three Palaces sharing the harmony of longevity; may winds be gentle and rains timely, so that the Four Seas rejoice in the governance of concord and prosperity.\n\nMoreover...\n\nOn the twenty-sixth day of the fifth month in the first year of the Yanyou reign, Jiayin cycle, with the ritual rank as before, your servant Wang Daomeng reverently received the Emperor’s sacred decree. Reflecting on the blessings bestowed by Heaven and the Ancestors, and the weight of state and family upon one’s person, how could one cease in vigilant self-examination or falter in gratitude and prayer? Thus, we invoke the Primordial Rites upon Mount Mao and present luminous invocations upon the sacred charts of Luo. Surely, our sincerest desires shall be fulfilled, and no distance shall hinder their reach. Therefore, with reverence, we seal the incense and offerings and dispatch the Successor Master of the Mysterious Teachings, Overseer of Daoist Affairs in Jianghuai, Jingxiang, and other regions, the Perfected Lord of Mysterious Virtue and Vast Dao, Hao Quanjie, to proceed to the Supreme Clarity Ancestral Altar of the Yuanfu Wanning Palace on Mount Mao. There, by command of the Ancestral Master Wang Daomeng, we assemble a retinue of ritual masters and Daoist priests to conduct the Golden Sickle Precious Retreat for the Prosperity of the State and the Well-being of the People for three days and nights, concluding with the grand dispersal of a Pure Offering to the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions of the Three Realms.\n\nMay the One Man be blessed, and myriad fortunes shared in unison; may diligent governance know no lapse, and all offices attain fulfillment. May the august administration inspire awe and reverence, bringing joy to the Empress Dowager; may the boundless spring of eternal felicity endure, with winds gentle and rains timely, so that the people and all living things thrive in peace.\n\n---\n\nMoreover, on the fifth day of the first month in the fifth year of the Yanyou reign, Wuwu cycle, the disciple of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Three Luminants Scripture Register, the forty-fifth-generation Successor Master of the Mysterious Teachings, the Perfected Lord of Primordial Luminance, your servant Liu Dabin, reverently received the Emperor’s sacred decree. As the governance of state and family has now endured eight years, and the veneration of the Heavenly Dao has led to the presentation of incense upon the Three Sacred Mountains, at the outset of spring’s generative awakening, we pray for the vast unfolding of great virtue and the nurturing of all life. Humbly, we present our plain offerings below and aspire to attain boundless felicity above. Therefore, we dispatch the Perfected Lord of Primordial Completion, Literary Flourishing, and Central Harmony, Jianghuai, Jingxiang, and other regions’ Overseer of Daoist Affairs, Xia Wenyong, to proceed to the Supreme Clarity Ancestral Altar of the Yuanfu Wanning Palace on Mount Mao. There, by your servant’s command, we assemble a retinue of ritual masters and Daoist priests to conduct the Golden Register Precious Retreat for the Prosperity of the State and the Well-being of the People for three days and nights, concluding with the grand dispersal of a Pure Offering to the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions of the Three Realms.\n\nMay August Heaven cherish its mandate, bestowing the great norms and blessings; may the nine clans live in harmony and the myriad states in peace, with weapons stilled and punishments set aside. May the Six Treasuries be well-ordered and the Three Affairs governed, so that Earth endures and Heaven abides. May the Empress Dowager’s court share in the harmony of longevity, and the central realm enjoy the blessings of peace.\n\nMay the heir’s position be celebrated and prolonged, with blessings extending throughout the realm.\n\nFurthermore, on the twelfth day of the tenth month in the bingyin year of the third Taiding reign (1326), your servant Liu Dabin, holding the same ritual office as before, reverently received the Emperor’s sacred edict. In profound reverence for the grand mandate, we humbly continue the great enterprise, safeguarding the people without limit, seeking eternal stability for the ancestral altars, responding to Heaven with sincerity, and dutifully offering sacrifices to the mountains and rivers. Thus, we establish this pure shrine, hoping to manifest vast blessings. With reverence, we present incense and silk, dispatching the Grand Master of the Mysterious Teaching of the Upper Village, the Perfected of Vast Virtue and Transformative Power Who Propagates the Dao and Elevates Culture, Supreme Commander of Daoist Affairs in Jianghuai, Jingxiang, and other regions, and Director of the Academy of Scholarly Worthies, Wu Quanjie, to the Supreme Clarity Ancestral Altar at the Yuanfu Wanning Palace on Mount Mao in Jiankang Circuit, where he shall conduct the Golden Register Precious Retreat to pray for Heaven’s eternal mandate and bring prosperity to the state and well-being to the people. We humbly beseech the celestial vault to extend its oversight, that the precious throne may endure, the foundations of great peace be laid for the nation, and the Three Palaces share in the celebration; that the seas and lands rejoice in harmonious governance, and the myriad states attain tranquility.\n\nFurthermore, on the ninth day of the first month in the gengwu year of the third Tianli reign (1330), your servant Liu Dabin, Disciple of the Most High, Successor of the Supreme Clarity Tradition, Grand Master of the Highest Mystery and Great Cavern Scriptures and Registers, Forty-Fifth-Generation Patriarch, and Celestial Master of the Three Heavens, bearing the title of Perfected Who Embodies the Supreme Radiance and the office of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Capital, reverently received the Emperor’s sacred edict. In solemn reception of the luminous mandate, we faithfully continue the great enterprise, revering August Heaven and bearing its favor, governing the land with reverence, and hoping that all within the realm may once more attain peace. Thus, we unfold the subtle rites to manifest vast blessings. With reverence, we present incense and silk, dispatching the ritual master Shu Zhixiang to the Supreme Clarity Ancestral Altar at the Yuanfu Wanning Palace on Mount Mao, where he shall conduct the Golden Register Precious Retreat for three days and nights, concluding with the grand dispersal of a Pure Offering to the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions of the Three Realms. We humbly pray that Heaven and Earth unite in virtue, the sun and moon shine with equal brilliance, the seas be calm and the rivers clear, opening the realm of longevity to the eight wilds; that the seasons be harmonious and the years abundant, winning the reverent hearts of the myriad states. May the extended blessings and honorific titles be bestowed upon the Three Lords, and the Three Peaks be established as an abbey by imperial decree.\n\nBy the Emperor’s sacred edict, in accordance with Heaven’s cherished mandate: may the mysterious Dao be serenely venerated, and the events of the past be clearly observed.\n\nThe Dao of non-action is not achieved without deliberate cultivation of one’s nature; true self-cultivation is not attained without the accumulation of deeds and the piling of merits. The Great Lord of Mount Mao, Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, Director of Destinies, and Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Dao of Primordial Emptiness and Divine Protection—his extraordinary conduct transcended the mundane, his concentrated thought gathered the void, and with undivided virtue he purified his heart. Receiving the secret decree from the Western Flower of the Tortoise Terrace, he was invested by the myriad spirits and established the ancestral altar of Golden Mound at Jurong. His cinnabar radiance has remained ever-new for a thousand years, the precious qi of the Three Peaks ever-firm. Auspicious omens arose, and the people to this day extol him; he summoned rain and calmed winds, for Heaven aids those who act in accord with the Dao. Truly, his sagely virtue aligns with divine protection. No rites are more solemn than those for the Director of Destinies, where jade texts and medicinal writs are offered in due order. Granting him this wisdom, may he assist me in governance.\n\nBy imperial decree, let one peak of Mount Mao be bestowed as the Abbey of Sagely Protection, and let the Great Lord of Mount Mao, Supreme Minister of the Eastern Marchmount, be specially enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Dao of Primordial Emptiness, Divine Protection, and Sagely Response. Let the responsible officials carry this out.\n\nBy the Emperor’s sacred edict, in accordance with Heaven’s cherished mandate: harmonizing the hearts of the people and ordering the myriad things, rites must accord with the spirits; establishing the imperial standard and bestowing blessings upon the common folk, we seek confirmation in timely rains. East of the Great River, Jurong stands as the ancestral seat of reverence. The land rejoices in peace, and the years are marked by abundance.\n\nThe Second Lord of Mount Mao, Perfected Lord of the Right Register of Destinies, the Wondrous Dao of Emptiness and Tranquility, and Divine Protection—overseeing the Central Peak as Director of Destinies and refining his form at the Western Flower—discerned the falsity of worldly cares and grasped the essence of serenity in self-cultivation. His feathered banners and simurgh-drawn retinue ascend in solemn procession through the clouds; his transformed crane returns, and the city walls often behold him upon the ornate pillars. As I extend benevolence to aid all spirits, so too should wondrous beings protect the people. Those who study the Dao receive it through the numinous, and none have surpassed Laozi as their ancestral master. Though the Han Emperor Wen did not seek blessings through sacrifices, his sincere reverence was profound. Now, in praise and for the benefit of all living things, I bestow this grand mandate.\n\nBy imperial decree, let the second peak of Mount Mao be bestowed as the Abbey of Virtue and Protection, and let the Second Lord of Mount Mao be specially enfeoffed as the Perfected Lord of the Wondrous Dao of Emptiness, Tranquility, Virtue, and Sagely Response. Let the responsible officials carry this out.\n\nBy the Emperor’s sacred edict, in accordance with Heaven’s cherished mandate: qi transforms into spirits, grasping the essentials of yin and yang; things respond as they arise, achieving success in times of flood and drought. The numen of this mountain takes its name from its lineage. The Third Lord of Mount Mao, Perfected Lord of the Three Offices, Protector of Life, the Subtle and Wondrous Dao of Primordial Emptiness, and Benevolent Protection—without guiding and pulling, his body attained longevity, for purity alone is true. Secretly following the Azure Dragon, he attends left and right without question; at times he rides the White Magpie, accompanying his elder and younger brothers on distant journeys. Bearing Heaven’s favor, he pleads for the lives of the people.\n\nWandering carefree and at ease, he wears the radiance of light as if ever new; roaming and lingering in ceaseless flow, he receives boundless blessings and felicity. Thus, we bestow further honors and gifts, grandly responding to this age of great peace. Burying the cauldron upon the lofty peak, he emulates the Dao of the Yellow Emperor; offering gold in the empty valley, he humbly refrains from matching Emperor Guangwu’s deeds. With his majestic numen, he unites with the realm in governance.\n\nBy the Emperor’s sacred edict, in accordance with Heaven’s cherished mandate: the Third Lord of Mount Mao, Perfected Lord of the Three Offices, Protector of Life, the Subtle and Wondrous Dao of Primordial Emptiness, and Benevolent Protection—Divinely Responsive Perfected Lord—is hereby granted the title for the Three Peaks’ Benevolent Protection Abbey. Let the responsible officials carry this out.\n\n*Seventh month, third year of Yanyou*\n*Drafted by Hanlin Academician Biaotong, supervising the composition*\n*Seal of Hanlin Academician and Grand Preceptor Zhao Mengfu*\n\n*Edict granting the title \"Abbey of Venerable Felicity and Longevity\"*\n\nBy the Emperor’s sacred edict, in accordance with Heaven’s cherished mandate: as We peruse the mountain charts and examine the traces of immortals, the old hermitage amidst the winding forests proves to be the former dwelling of [Tao] Hongjing. Tracing back to its founding, it was established to house his eminent disciples; even now, a thousand years later, their legacy remains vivid. We shall further exalt the divine and manifest their lofty virtue.\n\nThe Abbey of Venerable Felicity on Three Mao Mountain in Jiankang Circuit shall, in accordance with the petition of Master Hao Quanjie, Successor of the Mysterious Teachings and Perfected Master of Doctrine, be granted the title \"Abbey of Venerable Felicity and Longevity.\" Let the responsible officials carry this out.\n\n*Third month, sixth year of Yanyou*\n\n**Volume Four of the Mao Shan Gazetteer concludes**\n\n**Volume Five of the Mao Shan Gazetteer**\n*Composed by Liu Dabin, Hereditary Master of the Supreme Clarity Tradition*\n\n**Records of the Three Divine Ones**\n**The True Lineage of the Mao Lords**\n\nThe Great Lord of the Controller of Destinies bore the surname Mao, personal name Ying, and style Shushen. He was a native of Nanguan in Xianyang.\n\nThe Mao clan traced its roots to the Ji lineage, its virtue and benevolence accumulating across generations, its blessings flowing through a hundred families. His great-grandfather, named Meng, styled Chucheng and also Benchu, possessed profound insight into the mysterious and distant. Discerning the rise and fall of dynasties, he foresaw the decline of Zhou and refused office under the feudal lords. Instead, he became a disciple of Master Guigu of Beiguo and Bei’e, retiring to Mount Hua. There, he attained the Dao and ascended to heaven in broad daylight, riding a dragon, in the thirtieth year of the First Emperor of Qin, on the gengzi day of the ninth month.\n\nAt the time, a children’s rhyme in the village sang:\n*\"The immortal attained is Mao Chucheng,*\n*Riding a dragon to ascend into the Great Clarity.*\n*Now on the Dark Continent, he sports in Crimson City,*\n*And in succession, one after me, shall be Ying.*\n*Should the Emperor learn this, let the twelfth month be renamed Jiaoping.\"*\n\nUpon hearing this, the First Emperor inquired of the village elders, who explained: \"This is the song of immortals, exhorting the Emperor to seek the safeguard of longevity.\" Thereupon, the First Emperor, stirred to action, resolved to seek immortals and renamed the twelfth month *Jiaoping*.\n\nHis great-grandfather, Yan, styled Taineng, was the fourth son of Meng. He served King Zhao of Qin as a retainer and was later promoted to Colonel of Chariots and Cavalry, enfeoffed as the Reverent Marquis of Changping. His grandfather, named Xian, styled Shilun, served King Zhuangxiang of Qin as the Marquis of Guangxin. When the First Emperor ascended the throne, he was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Dexin. He fathered six sons, all renowned in their time. His sixth son, named Zuo, styled Yanying, neither served in office nor pursued scholarship, but aspired to farming and sericulture. He had three sons: the eldest was the Great Lord of the Controller of Destinies; the second, named Gu, styled Jiwei; and the third, named Zhong, styled Sihe.\n\nThe Lord of the Controller of Destinies was born in the fifth year of the *zhongyuan* era of Emperor Jing of Han, a *bingshen* year, while his two younger brothers were born in *wuxu* and *gengzi* years, respectively. From youth, the three brothers were endowed with extraordinary conduct, their natural talents keen and perceptive. They held themselves aloof from worldly affairs, delighting solely in purity and emptiness. Once, the Lord of the Controller of Destinies said to his brothers: \"Worldly affairs are tangled and perilous, like treading on thin ice. We should emulate the lofty retreat of the High Ancestor, aspiring only to the steadfast integrity of reclusion.\"\n\nAt the age of eighteen, he left home and bid farewell to his parents, entering the mountains of Heng. There, he studied the *Dao De Jing* and the *Commentaries on the Zhouyi*, gathered herbs, and consumed elixirs. He concealed his radiance in the cliffs, practicing for six years. His concentrated devotion moved the divine, and in a dream, he saw the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery holding a jade tablet, leading him and saying: \"In the Western City dwells Lord Wang, who has attained the true Dao. Why not seek him out and receive his teachings?\"\n\nAwakening at dawn, he journeyed directly to the Western City. After three months of fasting and purification, he suddenly beheld Lord Wang, riding a divine tiger and guiding its reins along the sacred ridge, soaring above the embroidered crags. Thereupon, he cast himself over obstacles, surrendering his life to the true Dao. Unaware, he arrived at Lord Wang’s abode. Lord Wang silently dispatched his attendants to escort him, bringing him to the Jade Terrace within the Tower of Flowing Efflorescence. After a long while, he was led forward. Kneeling and knocking his head to the ground, he begged for the gift of longevity, prostrating himself and repeating his entreaties without cease.\n\nLord Wang glanced at his attendants and said: \"His form and spirit have endured hardship; it seems he is truly resolved.\" Thereupon, he was guided and instructed, warned never to slacken, and was retained in the Grotto Palace. For seventeen years, he served as an attendant, handling robes and sandals. Seeing his diligence and discretion, Lord Wang gradually entrusted him with managing the records of garments and scriptures. After another three years, Lord Wang commanded his carriage and traveled to White Jade Turtle Mountain, taking the Lord of the Controller of Destinies with him to visit the Queen Mother in the Azure Forest Palace.\n\nThe Queen Mother said: \"To bring a mortal clad in flesh to the Numinous Terrace—is this not laborious?\" Lord Wang smiled but did not answer. The Queen Mother turned to the Lord of the Controller of Destinies, who bowed twice and begged for esoteric essentials. Knocking his head to the ground, he pleaded: \"I, Ying, am a lowly and base creature, born of withered bones. How dare I, with this unworthy body, aspire to the years of dragons and phoenixes? With the substance of a morning mushroom, I seek the span of accumulated moons. Though I gaze toward the distant stream, none can aid me. I constantly fear that one day I shall perish in the trials of seeking, becoming a laughingstock to the vulgar. Having encountered Lord Wang, my bitter cinnabar has been transformed, and I have roughly received the arts of refining the body. Who could have imagined that today I would behold your sacred countenance? In a daze, I see the great image, as if submerged in a divine dream. To save the living and protect the dead, I come as a beggar, beseeching the gift of the essentials of longevity, to briefly awaken this walking corpse.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother said: \"Your heart is truly sincere. Long ago, I studied under the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning and the Great Emperor of Fusang. He bequeathed to me essential teachings: the *Dao of Jade Pendants and Golden Perfection*, the *Scripture of the Supreme Mystery and the Dark Truth*—truly the rare treasures of heaven and humanity, the wondrous secrets of the Celestial Thearch. Do you wish to hear them today?\"\n\nHaving spoken, she urged Lord Wang to expound the *Scripture of the Dark Truth* and personally recited the *Text of Jade Pendants and Golden Perfection*. Then, she spoke of the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning and the Great Emperor Lord, saying: \"This is the *Hidden Book of the Two Radiant Ones of the Grand Empyrean*. There are also the *Two Radiant Ones of Yin and Yang*, the *Inner True Talismans*, and the original texts that accompany them. By the law of the Most High, only those appointed as Controllers of Destinies may receive them. You, with your jade tablet and dark potency, inscribed with the script of the Supreme Clarity, are destined to become a Lord of the Upper Ministers and assume the office of Controller of Destinies. This Dao shall later be separately transmitted to you. However, without first learning the *Dao of the Dark Truth of the Hall of Light*, you cannot obtain the *Hidden Book of the Grand Empyrean*. The *Dao of the Dark Truth* is the method of consuming the sun and moon, the safeguard of refining the five spirits. It is not taught to disciples of the Total Perfection, nor is the potency of the Controller of Destinies transmitted to those without a mandate.\"\n\nHaving spoken thus, the Perfected King and the Master returned to the Western City, where they followed the true instructions and practiced accordingly. After three years, the Master’s eyes gleamed with divine radiance, and his face took on the luster of jade. The Perfected King then bestowed upon him a dose of the Nine-Turned Returning Elixir and a sacred formula, setting up an altar to swear an oath of secrecy. Forbidding any disclosure, he sent the Master away, saying: \"Your Dao is now accomplished. A hundred years hence, seek me at the Southern Marchmount, where I shall confer upon you an immortal office in the realm of Haoyue.\"\n\nAfter taking leave of his teacher, the Master wandered the world in humble guise, unadorned by worldly pretensions. He claimed to have entered the northern valley of Mount Da to study the arts of the Confucian and common schools. At the time, he was forty-nine years old, and his parents were still living. His father, enraged upon seeing him, said: \"As a son, you are unfilial—abandoning your duty to care for us while roaming far and wide. I shall disown you as if you were never born.\" He sought to punish him with a staff, but the Master knelt and pleaded: \"I have received a mandate to attain the Dao, and the Dao’s way is to withdraw from the world. One cannot serve both paths at once. Though I am far from your daily care, I bring peace to our household and longevity to my parents. I have already received the talismans and registers of a sacred teacher, and the soldiers of the Heavenly Cadets cannot strike me. Should you harm me, the Three Offices will investigate—this is no trifling matter.\"\n\nHis father’s anger remained unappeased, and he wished to test the Master’s claims before others to dispel doubt. Raising his staff to strike, the staff shattered into fragments, which flew about, piercing pillars and embedding in walls. His father, realizing the Master was no ordinary man, ceased and said: \"What you say is true, but if you had struck an ordinary person, they would have been injured.\" He then asked: \"If you have attained the Dao, can you revive the dead?\" The Master replied: \"Those whose heavenly allotment is exhausted or whose sins are grave cannot be restored. Only those who died untimely may be revived.\"\n\nThe Master then summoned the Earth God. His father, standing in the central courtyard, asked the Earth God: \"Among the dead in this village, who can be called back?\" The Earth God replied: \"So-and-so Li Yi.\" The Master said: \"Hasten to command the relevant authorities to dispatch him. Once the matter is settled, report back.\" After sunset, the Earth God returned and announced: \"The matter of So-and-so Li Yi has been resolved; he may now be released.\" The Master then instructed the deceased’s family to dig up the grave and open the coffin. The dead man showed signs of breath but could not speak. Lifted from the coffin, he sat up and spoke clearly after three days. Several graves were opened, and all the dead revived, living for decades more before dying again. Near and far, people hailed the Master as a divine sage.\n\nLater, powerful nobles and feudal lords sought his favors, but the Master sealed his spiritual gates and blocked his wondrous powers, telling them: \"When I first studied the Dao, I meditated deeply in the mountains, and the mountain spirits aided me, enabling me to command them. It is not that I myself have attained such divine mastery as to control life and death over all things.\" When pressed relentlessly, he feigned severe illness, even to the point of near-death.\n\nHe concealed his depths, adapting to circumstances without constraint. Though people marveled at his attainment of the Dao, none could fathom his true actions. More than ten years later, his parents lived to a ripe old age before passing away. The Master observed mourning rites in full, remaining at home for fifty-three years in all.\n\nThe second brother was known as the Lord of Fixed Record. During the reign of Emperor Jing of Han, he was recommended as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate, and in the first year of the Yuanshuo era, he was nominated as a Worthy and Good man. He was appointed Gentleman of the Five Offices, and in the second year of the Zhenghe era, he was promoted to Grand Tutor to the Crown Prince. In the first year of the Yuanfeng era, he was appointed Commandant Breaker of the Hu and Governor of Wuwei.\n\nThe youngest brother was known as the Lord of Preserving Life. From youth, he was renowned for his integrity and conduct. He withdrew to Mount Huayin, and in the third year of the Jianyuan era of Emperor Wu, he was recommended as a Square and Upright candidate but declined. He moved to Liang State and became an honored guest of the Filial King. In the second year of the Dijie era of Emperor Xuan, he was appointed Magistrate of Luoyang, then promoted to Commandant of the Western Regions and Governor of Shangjun.\n\nWhen Emperor Yuan ascended the throne, the youngest brother was appointed Grand Master of the Five Elders and later transferred to serve as Governor of Xihe. At that time, the second brother was serving as Commandant of the Capital. As they both prepared to assume their posts, elders and youths from their hometown—several hundred in all—gathered to see them off. The Master was also present, addressing the guests: \"Though I have not served as a high minister with a salary of two thousand *shi*, I shall hold a divine office. The Heavenly Emperor has chosen me to fill the position of Supreme Minister of the Eastern Peak, Lord of the Forest of Thunder, and Controller of Life and Death, overseeing the registers of life and death in the realms of Wu and Yue. I shall also supervise the selection of those who study the Dao, testing and verifying those who attain early transcendence. This is indeed a key position among the highest immortals and the divine palace’s ancestral masters.\"\n\n\"On the third day of the fourth month next year, I shall ascend. Will any of you be able to visit me as you do today? If you come, there will be no need for any expense—I shall provide for you myself.\" The guests all agreed.\n\nWhen the appointed day arrived, several *qing* of land before the Master’s gate suddenly leveled themselves. A canopy of green silk was erected, beneath which layers of white felt were spread, enough to seat hundreds. Word spread far and near that this family’s master had attained the Dao and was about to depart. Young and old gathered in throngs, filling the roads, their numbers far exceeding those who had come to see off his brothers. Golden platters and jade cups, rare delicacies and precious fruits appeared before the guests of their own accord. The radiance was dazzling, beyond description. Strings and winds, bells and chimes resounded through heaven and earth, while fragrant aromas carried for miles. As the feast flowed on, all six hundred guests drank and ate their fill.\n\nThe next day, when the welcoming officials arrived, the Master bid farewell to his family, then addressed his clansmen and disciples: \"The true path of immortality is hidden, prizing obscurity over ostentation. One should not seek to display brilliance or adorn oneself with false embellishments to dazzle the eyes and ears. The reason I could not silently withdraw, conceal my light, and ascend unseen from the empty peaks was to use this path to inspire and encourage my brothers’ pursuit of the Dao. How could I alone have been so deluded as to turn back? All under heaven with a seeking heart should turn their gaze toward the hope of attaining divine transcendence. Though Jiwei and Sihe have seen this, they will surely repent in time, resign their offices, abandon their salaries, and come to seek me.\"\n\n\"For now, I shall pause at the eastern banks of the Jiang River, on Mount Juqu. Within this mountain lies a numinous abode, where countless caverns interconnect, their grottoes stretching endlessly—a true immortal’s sanctuary. Long ago, I made a vow with my sacred teacher to first purify and discipline myself here, reverently awaiting heaven’s decree. Only afterward shall I ascend to the great Huo Peak and dwell upon the Red City.\"\n\nHaving spoken, he bid farewell to all, then mounted a feathered carriage, drawn by dragons and tigers. Rising into the void, he departed. After traveling eastward for over ten *li*, he suddenly vanished from sight.\n\nIn the fifth year of Emperor Yuan’s *Chuyuan* reign, the *ding-chou* year, the Master was one hundred and two years of age. He crossed the Jiang River and temporarily settled on Mount Juqu, where he explored the grotto-palaces within, selecting true immortals for advancement. On the mountain’s northern slope, he built a thatched hut—now known as the Lower Lodge. There, he took charge of the earthly registers, determining life and death. Black tigers served as his guardians, white cranes came and went, and his numinous presence shone across the lands east of the Jiang. His Dao and virtue spread through a hundred towns, and the people of Wu and Yue vied to become his servants. Thus, the mountain was renamed Mount Maojun in his honor.\n\nHis two younger brothers, still in office, heard the people speak of their elder brother ascending to immortality in broad daylight. Only then did they believe that transcendence could be learned and the divine attained, realizing that the legends of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao were no empty tales, and that the cauldron at Mount Dinghu held truth. They resigned their posts, returned home, and in their twilight years, sought to follow the Master’s abandoned practices—but to no avail. They said to one another: \"Our elder brother has attained the Dao; he is no stranger. Why not seek him out, receive his oral instructions in person, and follow the methods in the esoteric texts to guide the world? Even if we fail to reach the end, at least we will not die in vain.\"\n\nIn the fifth year of Emperor Yuan’s *Yongyuan* reign, the *ren-wu* year, on the sixth day of the third month, they crossed the Jiang River to find their brother on the eastern mountain. Overcome with sorrow, they wept as they listened. The Master said to them: \"Why have you awakened so late?\" His brothers replied: \"We were foolish and dull, blind to the Dao and virtue, lost in the dust of the world, chasing its fleeting pleasures, and serving the Han court. Our families remained intact, our ranks reached governor and minister, and our long lives were all due to your divine protection. Sheltered under your grace, we lived without awareness—until you left, and it was as if heaven and earth had vanished. We are not made of metal or stone; our lives must end. Now, in our decaying years, we fear death may come at any moment, our breath lingering but a morning or evening away. When we returned home, we tried to follow your abandoned practices but received no true instructions and saw no results. Now we have crossed the river to serve you, hoping to receive your teachings. Grant us long life and deliver us from death.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"You are already old; it will be difficult to restore you. Even if you receive the true instructions, you may only become earthbound immortals. The great arts of ascending to the Upper Clarity and soaring through the heavens are not what I have studied.\" Thus, he taught them the Way of swallowing the first sprouts of green herbs and the fluid of *qi*—a method to prolong life without death. Later, he told Jiwei: \"You should take the *Four-Fan Powder of the Yellow Emperor*, which I once received from Master Gaoqiu and now pass on to you.\" To Sihe, he said: \"You should take the *Queen Mother’s Rejuvenation Powder*. Your constitution is less depleted than Jiwei’s, so this will replenish your essence and nourish your brain.\" Both formulas were wondrous methods.\n\nThe two brothers diligently followed his teachings, taking the medicines, swallowing *qi*, and cultivating stillness and concentration. They also practiced all the precepts for preserving life. After eighteen years, their complexions became like those of youths. The Master said: \"The medicines have taken effect.\" He then transmitted the higher Dao, teaching them to visualize the *qi* of the Mysterious True within the Hall of Light, to refine and circulate their generative essence, and to harmonize their souls and spirits. After three years, their divine radiance began to manifest. The Master then bestowed upon each a dose of *Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir* and a sacred formula. Thus, their immortal Way was accomplished.\n\nThe Master then petitioned Lord Wang, stating that his two brothers had received heavenly grace and deliverance, becoming earthbound immortals. According to immortal law, they were to receive registers, talismans, and official appointments, taking charge of their respective domains. He requested that their protection be extended. Lord Wang replied: \"You have studied the Dao from a young age and never wavered in diligence. I pity your steadfast resolve and have thus aided you. Having firmly submitted your petition, I will serve as your guarantor before the Supreme. The Most High has granted permission, bestowing upon them the mandate of divine immortals. Your brothers, sheltered under your grace, enjoyed wealth and nobility, but their indulgence and dissipation depleted their *qi*. They linger only in breath, now over a hundred years old—no longer the time to learn the Dao. Receiving divine powders and sacred formulas, they may transform and prolong their lives; is this not enough? Should they not simply accept their positions as earthbound immortals? Moreover, since ancient times, brothers attaining immortality together has been rare. Yet your great-grandfather attained the Dao, his benevolence extending to all things. The virtue he accumulated has now manifested in you. Your compassion and kindness, your constant practice of hidden merits—these are truly pitiable. You have repeatedly petitioned for your brothers’ immortal offices. Now, I bestow upon them the *Elixir of Jade Fluid from Mystic Water*. Let them fast and take it. Be cautious not to reveal it to others. You must separately petition the Supreme Emperor and vouch for their efficacy. You shall bring them yourself.\"\n\nAt that time, though the two brothers had inwardly connected with the divine and outwardly commanded the Six *Ding* spirits, they had not yet been deemed worthy of an audience with the great celestial perfected, such as Lord Wang, for their status was unequal. The Master instructed his brothers to purify themselves, take the elixir, and consume the sacred fungus, then together perform a three-month fast of the heart. They journeyed to the Palace of the Azure Lad and the Square Cauldron, inscribing their names on golden tablets. Next, they went to the Grotto-Palace of the Western City to pay homage to the Prime Minister of the Assembly of Perfected. Traveling south to the Vermilion Terrace on Mount Heng, they visited the Perfected of the Great Void and the Red One, then returned to the Palace of the Square Cauldron to request the registers of the Three Perfected of Earthly Immortality. They proceeded to the Red City to receive the talismans of true transformation and spirit, then to Mount Luohuo to seek embroidered banners. Finally, they ascended to the Nine Palaces, journeyed to the Golden Portal, and received the scriptures of the Sacred Lord, prostrating themselves at the portal for three months.\n\nThe Sacred Lord then commanded the Supreme Minister of the Nine Radiant Perfected, Lord Wang the Grand Director of Destinies, and the Azure Lad, Master of the Lofty Dawn, to ascend to the Palace of the Great Dao of the Supreme and the Hall of Harmonious Dawn. There, they petitioned the Vermilion Palace Envoys to descend and bow before the Golden Portal, presenting their petitions. In an instant, two envoys arrived with thousands of attendants. The envoys handed over the purple silk scriptures to Gu and Zhong. The purple silk registers contained two imperial edicts and supplementary documents. After receiving the scriptures, the Master urged his brothers to take their leave and return to their domains. Thus, Jiwei was granted the title *Perfected of the Earthly True and Divine Lord of the Register of Destinies*, while Sihe was appointed *Immortal Lord of the Three Offices, Preserver of Life*.\n\nEach proceeded to their domains in accordance with the commands inscribed on the purple silk. The divine palaces and upper bureaus also allocated resources to the two lords as required.\n\nThe Director of Destinies resided on Mount Gouqu for forty-three years. In the second year of Emperor Ai’s *Yuanshou* reign, the *gengshen* year, he reached the age of one hundred and forty-five. On the eighteenth day of the eighth month of that year, the *jiyou* day, the Vermilion Perfected of the Southern Marchmount, the Lord of Western City, the Queen Mother of Mount Gui, and the Azure Lad of Fangzhu together visited him in the mountains.\n\nAt that time, the Celestial August Emperor dispatched envoys from the Brocade Garment Court of the Unbounded Realm to bestow upon him a divine seal and jade tablets. The Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuous Heaven sent the Left Palace Attendants of the Three Heavens to present him with an eight-dragon brocade palanquin and a robe of purple feathers adorned with floral patterns. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao sent the Grand Master of Harmonious Dawn to confer upon him the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger and a bell of flowing gold. The Sage Lord of the Golden Portal commanded the Perfected of the Grand Ultimate to dispatch the Jade Gentleman of the Supreme Mystery of the Orthodox Unity, gifting him the Four Nodes, Swallow’s Embryo, Luminous Flowing Gold Essence, the Radiant Divine Mushroom of Everlasting Brilliance, and the Night-Glowing Cave Herb. He was instructed to bow and consume them.\n\nAfter fastening the seal, donning the robe, straightening his cap to face north, and securing the talisman and bell, the envoys addressed him, saying: \"He who consumes the Four Nodes and the Hidden Mushroom of the Grand Ultimate shall be ranked as a True Minister. He who consumes the Jade Mushroom of the Swallow’s Embryo from the Golden Portal shall be ranked as a Director of Destinies. He who consumes the Luminous Golden Essence of the Eastern Palace shall hold the office of Registrar. He who consumes the Night-Glowing Cave Herb of Everlasting Brilliance shall become a True Earl, concurrently assuming the duties of Chief Inspector of the Left and Right.\"\n\n\"You have today consumed all of these. Your lifespan shall be as enduring as heaven and earth, and your rank shall be that of *Supreme Perfected of the Eastern Marchmount, Director of Destinies, and Minister of the East*, overseeing the divine spirits of Wu and Yue and commanding the mountain origins of the lands east of the Jiang.\"\n\nUpon concluding their words, the envoys departed. In an instant, the Lords of the Five Thearchs each arrived in chariots of directional hues, accompanied by their retinues, bearing the mandate of the Great Emperor to present him with the Nine Bestowments and their supplementary documents. The Nine Bestowments were inscribed on tablets of purple jade, engraved with yellow gold, appointing him as *Supreme Perfected of the Eastern Minister, Director of Destinies*. He prostrated himself to receive the documents, bowed twice, and the divine officials and Perfected of the Five Thearchs departed. Only the Master Lord Wang and the Queen Mother of the West remained to host a grand celestial banquet for him. The Queen Mother commanded her attendants to perform music and sing the *Song of the Mystic Clouds*:\n\n*\"Though the Great Image seems vast and void,\nI grasp the gates of the Nine Heavens.\nParting the clouds, I drift through the Eight Sceneries,\nSwiftly descending to the lower earth.\nThe hollow echo of the Mystic Sound,\nThe Supreme Spirit brooks no chill.\nThe Great Emperor...*\n*...awakens to the toils of wind and dust,\nNurturing the spirit within the Three Origins,\nAbsorbing essence beneath the Jade Portal.\nThen riding the myriad-dragon post,\nDescending with the phoenix’s gaze upon the Nine Wilds.\"*\n\nAnother verse followed:\n*\"The Mystic Garden bars the Northern Terrace,\nFive Cities gleam in towering splendor.\nUnlocking the boundless ford,\nFloating upon the Weaving Maid’s River.\nAbove, ascending the Crimson Court,\nBelow, roaming the sun’s hidden vale.\nGazing beyond the Eight Desolations,\nPointing toward the Nine Voids afar.\nSuddenly, weariness is unfelt,\nHow could one know little or much?\nSummoning the maidens with a touch,\nThe distant voids harmonize in an instant.\nExquisitely attuned to nature’s accord,\nThis is the Song of the Mystic Clouds.\nThe divine melody unfolds in celestial rhythm,\nThe true sound, free of all deviation.\"*\n\nAfter the song concluded for some time, they all proceeded to the palaces of the two lords. The two lords prostrated themselves in welcome, facing north and declaring their reverence as humble servants. The Queen Mother addressed them, saying: \"Though your Dao is accomplished, your knowledge remains insufficient. I shall arrange for you both to receive something here.\"\n\nPresently, she dispatched her attendant Guo Mixiang to convey a message to the Supreme Primordial Lady. The two lords did not know who the Supreme Primordial Lady was. The message read: \"The True King of the Nine Numinous Powers of the Western Tortoise Mountain.\" They respectfully acknowledged her but had not met her for over a thousand years, as celestial duties had kept her occupied, preventing their reunion. \"Teaogu and Zhong have attained the Dao and have come to visit. Long have I refrained from inquiring after mortals. As host and guests sit facing each other, melancholy lingers. Could you grace us with your presence, even briefly?\"\n\nShe replied that she would deign to come and would await them. The attendant departed and soon returned. The Supreme Primordial Lady also sent an attendant to convey her response: \"Ahuan bows twice and inquires after your well-being. Though separated by the Crimson River and burdened by official duties, my longing for your radiance remains undiminished. Upon Mixiang’s arrival and your summons, I shall prepare my carriage. However, the Celestial August Emperor has just commanded me to attend to the records of the Three Origins in the Grove of Rarities. I shall go briefly and return promptly. I shall don my sash and hope you will tarry a while.\"\n\nThe two lords then asked the Queen Mother who the Supreme Primordial Lady truly was. The Queen Mother replied: \"She is the mother of the True August Ones of the Three Heavens, the Supreme Perfected of the Upper Primordial, and the registrar of the names of the jade maidens of the ten directions.\"\n\nAfter about two hours, the Supreme Primordial Lady arrived, heralded by the sounds of flutes and drums and the neighing of dragon-horses in the empty sky. Upon her arrival, she was accompanied by thousands of attendants, all women, around sixteen or seventeen years of age, their forms and countenances luminous and graceful. Many wore robes of green damask, their brilliance dazzling the eye. The Lady appeared to be eighteen or nineteen, her divine bearing impeccable. She wore a robe of crimson frost, draped with a fur-lined brocade cloak of azure feathers. Her hair was styled in a triple chignon, the rest cascading to her waist. She wore a crown of the Nine Dawns’ Radiant Sun, a girdle of six-faceted fire-jade pendants, a sash of phoenix-patterned lin-hua jade, and a sword of flowing yellow luminous essence.\n\nShe entered the chamber and bowed to the Queen Mother, who stopped her and invited her to sit beside her. A banquet was prepared for the Supreme Primordial Lady, facing north, no different from that of the Queen Mother. Lord Wang urged the two lords to bow twice and declare: \"Gu and Zhong, of dull and base nature, were born and raised in the turbid and chaotic world. Like those who face a wall, we have never glimpsed the true Dao. Yet, fearing death and cherishing life, we have followed our master’s guidance. Today, our deliverance is by heaven’s grace. We humbly beseech your instruction.\"\n\nThe Lady, moved by the two lords’ yearning for the true Dao and seeing that their numinous subtleties remained unopened, commanded her attendant Song Bifei to bring forth *The Three Primordials’ Flowing Pearl and Cinnabar Scenery*, *The Essence of the Dao*, *The Hidden Earth*, and *The Eight Arts of the Great Ultimate and Green Radiance*—four scriptures in all—to transmit to the two lords. The Queen Mother then commanded her attendant Li Fangming to present *The Jade Girdle and Golden Chime*, *The Concealed Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, and *The Transmission of the Two Internal Talismans of Cavernous Flight and Luminous Scenery*.\n\nThe Director of Destinies, the Supreme Primordial Lady, addressed the Queen Mother, saying: \"O Mother, the wonders of the concealed writs—the inner scriptures of the Supreme Perfected—are sealed within golden terraces. When worn, they enter the Grand Tenuity, advancing directly to the fore of the guards. With civil might, they repel the martial; prostrate, they embrace the gatekeepers’ posts. Ascending the Upper Clarity, they shake their forms in the jasper chambers. To the left, they roam the Grove of Rare Delights, ever summoning the Lords of Immortals; to the right, they nest upon White Mountain, gazing down upon the Grand Void. Crossing the Celestial Ford, they ride clouds and mount dragons; wandering these sacred peaks, perfected beings attend their chambers. Ten thousand spirits offer protection; mountain sprites oversee their welcome. In motion, they possess the eight-scenery jade chariot; in stillness, they repose in the golden hall. This writ is wondrous indeed—what is called the *Jade Girdle and Golden Chime*.\n\nSurrounding it are *The Three Primordials’ Flowing Pearl and Cinnabar Scenery*, *The Essence of the Dao*, *The Hidden Earth*, and *The Eight Arts of the Great Ultimate and Green Radiance*. These can reverse aging and restore youth, turn white hair back to infancy, shatter a thousand demons, and command a hundred spirits. They summon the yellow essence of the bright moon and obtain the crimson radiance of the white sun. Concealing the body and veiling its light, they transform the myriad things. Emerging from water and entering fire, they rebuke the dark netherworld. They bind tigers and leopards, summon the Six Dings, conceal themselves in the eight earths, and invert the five stars. With prolonged vision abiding in the body, they incline the ear to heaven.\n\nHow much more so with *The Concealed Writ of the Grand Empyrean*—the marvelous script of the Eight Assemblies? Its use is subtle and boundless; one may ascend the palaces of Jade Capital, drifting and floating into the halls of streaming rosy clouds. One becomes lord of the Five Peaks, sits upon the Director of Destinies’ couch, embraces the rich wine of phoenix marrow, and rinses the goblet of elixir and cinnabar. Mounting eight dragons to soar through the void, one rides the purple clouds of the empty vastness, soaring high and far.\n\nThereupon, the Supreme Primordial Lady rose from her seat, in her left hand holding the four scriptures, and in her right the covenant of transmission. Facing heaven, she intoned a blessing to the two lords: 'The vastness of the Nine Heavens, the radiance of the Supreme Luminary, the divine illumination of the mysterious and subtle, the clarity and emptiness of pure brightness—those who ascend the rare attain the wondrous; those who guard their qi live. With utmost sincerity, the Dao is attained; in stillness, the true is perfected.'\"\n\nTo command the spirit and humiliate the form is to pacify the essence and flourish the years. The stone’s essence and golden radiance conceal the luminous and record the form. Summoning spirits to left and right, one wields the celestial tally to activate the numinous. Thus may one pace the void or dissolve the form. To live long and endure, one’s brightness equals heaven’s. To violate the covenant or leak its secrets invites calamity that topples the clan. Each must guard against disaster—I dare admonish you, Master Mao.\n\nWith the blessing complete, the two lords bowed to receive the sacred scriptures, clasping them beneath their arms. The Queen Mother of the West also rose from her seat, holding the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean* in hand. She commanded the attendant maiden Zhang Lingzi to present the covenant of mutual trust. Facing the Director of Destinies, she extended her hands to deliver the book and intoned toward heaven: “Heaven is high, earth is low; the Five Peaks anchor the form. The primordial essence stirs the qi, and the vast expanse is darkly pure. Heaven revolves through the nine paths; the six harmonies endure in peace. The *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, jade pendants and golden seals, the *Jade Luminance* and the *Eight Assemblies*—treasured scriptures of the highest chapters. Ascend and traverse the Grand Ultimate; enter the Jade Chamber of the Supreme Clarity. To leak it is to invite trial; the body incurs heavenly misfortune. He who receives it must be vigilant—I dare admonish you, Mao Ying.”\n\nThe lord prostrated himself to receive the hidden writ. Once the feast and transmission were roughly concluded, the Queen Mother of the West and the Supreme Primordial Lady departed, leaving only Lord Wang behind. Thereupon, the lord took leave of his two younger brothers and accompanied Lord Wang to the Jade Cavern Estate of Red City. Along the way, the administrators of mountains and rivers who came forth to welcome and guide them numbered in the thousands. As they prepared to depart, he addressed his two brothers: “Now that I go, I shall have fixed duties and cannot visit often—no longer will we meet day and night. Yet I shall return to this mountain once a year. On the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month, my master and the Supreme Void Red Perfected of the Southern Peak will visit you here. Take note of those who are devoted to the Dao; await me on these days, and I shall attend to them, offering instruction to those yet unenlightened.”\n\nThus, the two lords remained to govern the mountain. Within the cavern, they established offices; without, they built structures. They expounded the Dao to all things, nourishing the multitude with its flow. Their virtue extended to birds and beasts, each attaining its nature. Divine portents revealed fortune and misfortune; transgressions were made manifest. With inner teachings harmonized and outer doctrines made level, wind and rain came in season, the five grains ripened, pestilence did not arise, and violence did not spread. The land knew no disasters; the villages knew no bandits. The elders of the time sang:\n\n*Maoshan joins Jinling,\nThe rivers and lakes lie below.\nThree divinities ride white cranes,\nEach governing a mountain’s brow.\nThey summon rain to drench parched rice,\nAnd dry fields too grow soft and nice.\nWives and children dwell secure,\nA hundred cares I need not endure.\nWhite cranes soar in azure skies—\nWhen will they return to grace our eyes?*\n\nWhen the three lords departed, each rode a white crane to alight upon one of the mountain’s three peaks. Many witnessed this, inspiring the song. Thereafter, the peaks of Juqu Mountain were divided into the mountains of the Great Lord Mao, the Middle Lord Mao, and the Lesser Lord Mao. Taken as a whole, they remained a single mountain—Juqu—without other names.\n\nThough the elders outwardly received the divine protection of the Mao Lords’ perfected spirits, they had never beheld their gracious presence in person. The Mao Lords, dwelling in leisure within their cavern palace, nurtured their spirits and preserved their truth. Disdaining the clamor of worldly exchanges, they distanced themselves from the vulgar to maintain stillness. Thus, they no longer met with the common folk, save for those of exceptional destiny and devotion to the Dao, whom they occasionally summoned to see.\n\nYet in nourishing the myriad things and extending virtue to the multitudes, they worked unseen. The people, sensing the overflow of their numinous power—equal to that of heaven and earth’s great spirits—perceived the effortless manifestation of the sacred Dao, moved by the people’s devotion. Thus, they came in throngs, supporting the old and carrying the young, bearing provisions and libations. Together, they raised altars and laid foundations, erecting temples and halls upon the mountain. Craftsmen exhausted their skill to construct towering edifices. They painted the likenesses of the three lords in vermilion and azure, inscribing their divine virtues with eloquent brushstrokes. They planted a hundred fruits; bamboo and parasol trees grew into forests. They channeled the clear currents of Piling’s source. Tigers and leopards warded off calamity; great beasts guarded the passes. White swans and dark crows soared to the heavens. The brave were awed by their might; the benevolent cherished their culture. Farmers revered their boundless grace; all things sought refuge in their divine trust. The dying were restored to life; seekers of the Dao yearned for their guidance.\n\nEmperor Ming of the Han, in the second year of the *Yongping* era, decreed that counties and commanderies repair the temples of sacred mountains, great marshes, and sites capable of summoning clouds and rain for the people’s benefit—such as the temple of Laozi in Chen, the temple of Yu the Great in Kuaiji, the temple of the Mao Perfected in Juqu of Danyang, the temple of the Two Consorts of the Xiang River and Qu Yuan in Changsha, and others of their kind. All had bequeathed virtue to the people and crafted the Dao for the myriad things. Some marked the lofty path of the Holy Mother; others modeled the divine traces of sages and worthies. Thus, images were cast in bronze to commemorate them; temples were built to invoke their spirits. All were to be maintained and protected, their guardians charged with their upkeep.\n\nThe villagers commonly called this temple the White Crane Temple, unaware that the Director of Destinies had long since departed eastward for Red City. In the past, those who entered the temple with sincere devotion to the Dao and prayed for guidance sometimes heard the two lords conversing within the curtains or saw white cranes perched there. These white cranes were transformations wrought by the elixir of ninefold cyclical refinement, enabling them to divide their forms. They could become dozens of white cranes or be ridden in flight, while their original forms remained where they had alighted.\n\nThe two lords delighted in music. Whenever devotees entered the temple with earnest intent, the lords would summon celestial courtesans from the Palace of Square Vessels and the Western City. As the courtesans descended, music sounded from the empty sky, drawing nearer. Upon arrival, their pipes, strings, and songs produced melodies beyond mortal hearing—pure, resonant, and indescribably profound. At day’s end, the courtesans were sent away. Their departure was marked by a chorus of music that gradually faded into the distance, until at last it could no longer be heard.\n\nThese divine beings possess the power to transform and manifest illusory scenes in accordance with the hearts of the common folk, thereby aligning with their emotions. Yet their true essence remains fixed in form, dwelling in leisure upon the Terrace of Repose, their radiant virtue concealed and their luminous power hidden within the Registers of Stability.\n\nThe Lord remarked: \"Mount Gouqu is but a detached palace of the Director of Destinies. We are not the rightful masters of the Terrace of Repose. The Eastern Minister, the Director of Destinies, oversees the multitude of perfected beings on Mount Tai, governing the myriad spirits of the Wu and Yue regions. Truly, he may be called one whose Dao runs deep and whose virtue stands lofty, whose authority subdues even the earliest of spirits.\"\n\nJia Xuandao, Li Shusheng, Yan Chengsheng, and Fu Daoliu all received the essential teachings of the Lord Director of Destinies. Xuandao, a native of Hedong, was born in the final years of King Weilie of Zhou. Shusheng, from Zhuo Commandery, was born during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han. Daoliu, from Beidi, served as a palace general under Emperor Ling of Han. Chengsheng, a man of Wu, was the commandant of Wudang Commandery during the reign of Emperor Gengshi of Later Han. Through diligent study, all attained the true Dao and later entered the Friend-of-the-Young Cave on Mount Xiaobaiyang in Tai, known as the Earthly Perfected.\n\nLi Yi, styled Zhongfu, was a native of Jingzhao. He and the Lord Director of Destinies both studied under the Western City Lord Wang. Zhongfu was an inner-chamber disciple, while the Director of Destinies was a northern-window disciple. However, Zhongfu’s received teachings differed: he constantly ingested *shuiyu* (water jade) and achieved efficacy, enabling him to pace the Dipper and conceal his form. By day and night, he practiced the methods of the Three Principles and Six Regulations, and performed the Seven Transformations of the White Tiger. After over a hundred years, he grew ever more youthful and vigorous. Together with the Lord Director of Destinies, he received a dose of the cyclically refined elixir, consumed it, and returned home. Zhongfu could recognize acquaintances from five hundred *li* away. He often made his living by setting nets. One morning, as he spread his nets, he caught a great crow. Upon inspection, it was Zhongfu himself. After speaking, they parted, and on that very day, he returned home, having lived among the people for two hundred and fifty years. During the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, he entered the Western Marchmount and was received with the same ceremonial honors as when the Lord Director of Destinies first departed. He was appointed Vice-Director of Destinies of the Western Marchmount. He often lamented: \"In my studies, I fell short of Mao Shushen—this too is my destiny.\"\n\nZhongfu once transmitted the Sevenfold Divine Transformation method to Zuo Yuanfang. After cultivating it, Yuanfang too achieved myriad transformations.\n\n*Record of Mount Mao, Scroll Five* concludes.\n*Record of Mount Mao, Scroll Six* begins.\n\nThe *Comprehensive Record of Divine Realms*, compiled by Liu Dabin, Successor Master of the Supreme Clarity lineage, states:\n\nThe *Inner Transmission of the Perfected of Great Primordiality* of Mount Juru records: East of the Yangtze, near Jinling, there lies a small marsh. To its east rises Mount Juru. This mountain’s cavernous interior harbors a numinous precinct, its grotto-heavens opening on all four sides, its caves and peaks stretching endlessly. Ancient texts call it the \"Vacuous Terrace of the Golden Altar,\" the \"Convenient Postern of the Heavenly Empress,\" the \"Eastern Window of Clarity and Emptiness,\" and the \"Secluded Screen of the Forest Chamber.\" Its myriad caverns interconnect, forming hidden paths that lead to seven thoroughfares and nine springs, with routes extending in all directions—truly a divine grotto and immortal sanctuary.\n\nThe mountain’s shape resembles the character *ju* (句), hence its name, Juru. It lies concealed among six small marshes, the present-day Chishan Lake, which faces the mountain directly as one arrives from the Yangtze. It is also called Mount Juru. Its winding sources cradle hidden depths, thus the surrounding settlement is named Jurongli. In the Zhou dynasty, its marshy springs were called the \"Caverns of Winding Waters\"; in the Qin, they were named the \"Altar of Jujin,\" after the hundred-zhang Golden Altar within its grotto-heaven, from which it derived its name. Nearby stands Mount Jijin, likewise named for its accumulated golden altars.\n\nDuring the Han, the Three Mao Lords came to govern this mountain. Local elders then renamed it the \"Mountain of the Mao Lords.\" The Three Lords departed riding white cranes, each alighting upon one of the mountain’s three peaks. Witnesses at the time gave rise to folk songs, and the crane-alighting sites were later distinguished as the mountains of the Great, Middle, and Lesser Mao Lords. Yet in their entirety, they remain but a single mountain, Mount Juru.\n\nThe *Record of the Recluse* states: Mount Juru’s ridges demarcate its boundaries—west and north belonging to Jurong, east and south to Yanling. The mountain lies one hundred fifty to sixty *li* by foot from the Yangtze at Stone Citadel. Jurong and Yanling were both under Runzhou during the Tang; in the Song, Jurong was assigned to Jiangning Prefecture before being abolished during the Xining reign. The eastern and southern portions of Yanling now belong to Jintan County in Qianjiang.\n\nThe *Inner Transmission of Great Primordiality* in the *Grotto-Heavens of Flourishing Yang* records: Within the great heavens lie thirty-six earthly grotto-heavens, of which the eighth is the cavern of Mount Juru. Spanning one hundred fifty *li* in circumference, it is called the \"Grotto-Heaven of the Golden Altar of Flourishing Yang.\" Its four walls are hollow, their upper and lower reaches entirely of stone. The level ground lies beneath the earth, emerging only after thirteen or fourteen *li*. It measures forty-five *li* east to west and thirty-five *li* north to south, perfectly square and flat. Its hollow interior extends one hundred seventy *zhang*, its lower reaches still bearing hills and mounds, while its upper vault is perfectly level.\n\nWithin, the \"Yin Radiance\" and \"Root of Solar Essence\" illuminate the void, their brilliance rivaling sun and moon. The Yin Radiance governs night, the Solar Essence day; both are round like sun and moon, floating in the boundless dark. The grotto-palace of Juru has five gates, each approached by winding stone steps within the void, serving as thoroughfares for immortals and adepts. The light of sun and moon differs not from the world outside, nor do its grasses, trees, waters, or marshes. Birds soar through the air, winds and clouds gather thickly—yet none can fathom its mysteries.\n\nSuch is the divine grotto-palace, its numinous wonders beyond measure, beyond conjecture, beyond deception. The grotto-heaven of Juru connects eastward to the Forest Chamber, northward to Mount Tai, westward to Mount Emei, and southward to Mount Luofu. Its lesser paths and intersecting trails are too numerous to count.\n\nDuring the Jianyuan era of the Han, Zuo Yuanfang, having attained the Dao, heard of this sacred mountain and came to dwell upon it, devoting himself to reverent practice. After five years, he found its gate and entered the hollow grotto, reaching the Yin Palace. The Three Lords bestowed upon him three kinds of divine mushrooms. Yuanfang wandered the grotto-palace for a year, marveling at its chambers and halls, their structures square and round, meticulously ordered, and fully furnished. He sighed: \"I never imagined the world held such marvels—where spirits come and go, adjudicating life and death as if it were an earthly court!\"\n\nJinling is the \"Earthly Lung\" among the blessed lands. According to the *Record of Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands*, there are seventy-two blessed lands, of which the Earthly Lung ranks first—this is the land of Jinling. As the *Inner Transmission* notes, its earth floats upon water, hence the comparison to a lung. The *Inner Chapters of Embracing Simplicity* mentions another \"Earthly Lung Mountain,\" Jade Flow Isle, while Mount Shang is also called the Earthly Lung. Here, we follow the *Inner Transmission* as authoritative.\n\nThe Lord of Life-Preservation received the teaching that Jinling is the fertile marrow of the hollow grotto, the Earthly Lung of Juru. Countless tread its soil, yet none comprehend it. It is also said of Jinling: \"Neither war nor flood may assail it; no calamity or plague shall befall it.\"\n\nThe forty-fourth scroll of the *River Chart’s Essential Primordiality* states: \"Within the Altar of Jujin lies a mound. The sick do not go there; floodwaters do not rise there—truly a blessed land.\" The *Inner Transmission of Great Primordiality* adds: \"Within Mount Juru lies the land of Jinling, spanning thirty-seven or thirty-eight *qing*. This is the Earthly Lung of Jinling. Its soil is rich, its well water sweet and fine; those who dwell here are destined for transcendence.\"\n\nThe *Essential Primordiality* also says: \"There is an Earthly Lung, where soil is fertile and water clear. The mountains of Juru and the mounds of the Golden Altar enable transcendence and ascension.\" The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that Jinling’s earth resembles that of Beiyu and the Northern Valley Pass—firm and solid, ideal for growing grains. Digging a well there yields water akin to that outside Feng Gate in Chang’an, its pure source a distant subterranean spring. The water is white, and even those who do not cultivate the Dao will live long lives if they dwell upon this land and drink its waters.\n\nThe *Inner Transmission* further states: To the left of Jinling’s ridges lies the Valley of Decision, while to the left of its marshy springs rises a mountain, with fertile sources to its right, called Willow Valley. To the west of the ridges lies the Source of Relief, called Yang Valley.\n\nThe *Inner Classic of Sacred Mountains and Blessed Lands* further states: The land of Hidden Dragons lies west of Willow Valley and to the right of the Golden Altar, where one may dwell in lofty seclusion.\n\nThe *Record of Blessed Lands by Confucius* says: Between the ridges of Gang Mountain lies the homeland of Hidden Dragons, where one may evade floods, avert illness, and attain longevity. The very name \"Gang\" derives from the essence of Jinling itself. Yet over a hundred generations and countless changes, its original name has been lost—how lamentable!\n\nThe Perfected Right Assistant Wang received the teaching that beyond the Golden Court of Tongwu and the Golden Mound of Wujuru lies a blessed realm for nurturing the true and a numinous dwelling for attaining transcendence:\n\n*\"Five times the waters of Yao would pour eastward into the sea,\nAll men would sicken and die beneath the weapons of Wu’an.\nWhat use are spears when I bear them not?\nNear the secluded gates of the Terrace of Immortals, I wander at ease.\"*\n\nThe Great Mount Mao lies south of Yuanfu Abbey, its solitary peak the gathering place of the Lord of Destiny, the White Crane. The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that atop Great Mount Mao rests a bronze tripod from the era of the Dark Emperor, large enough to hold four or five *hu* of grain. Its casting is exquisitely refined, buried eight *chi* deep in the earth at the mountain’s highest point, sealed beneath a slab of stone. The Dark Emperor commanded the Spirit of the Eastern Sea to conceal it there.\n\nIt is further said that the Dark Emperor was Gaoyang, son of Changyi, who was in turn the son of the Yellow Emperor’s son, Xuanxiao. Born to a woman of Mount Shu, Gaoyang was titled Zhuanxu. His father dwelled in the land of Ruo Waters, while Zhuanxu himself molded the banks of the Seven Rivers—thus was he called the Dark Emperor.\n\nAt the mountain’s summit, divine radiance often appears, known as the Cinnabar Light or the Heavenly Lamp. In ancient times, there stood a stone altar and stone chamber; today, halls and pavilions have been erected, where the ancient stone statues of the Three Mao Lords are venerated. Each year on the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month, the Lord of Destiny holds his wandering assembly, and people from all directions come to the mountain to pay homage. Grand *Lingbao* purification rites are conducted, a tradition unbroken from antiquity to the present.\n\nCentral Mount Mao lies north of Mount Jijin, its solitary ridge towering above all. The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that atop the Dark Ridge of Central Mao, the Lord of Destiny buried cinnabar from the Jade Gate of the Western Hu, buried two *zhang* deep and sealed on all four sides by slabs of stone. The streams flowing down the mountain’s flanks are tinged a faint red, and those who drink from them are strengthened. On either side of the mountain’s base lie small level areas, well-suited for quiet retreats.\n\nThe villages where the people of the Three Yangs are said to attain longevity are known as Zhuyang, Taiyang, and Beiyang.\n\nLesser Mount Mao lies north of Central Mount Mao. The *Inner Transmission of the Great Prime* states: In the third year of the Dihuang era of Wang Mang’s reign, on the *wushen* day of the seventh month, an emissary named Zhang Yong was dispatched to present five bronze bells, yellow gold, and white jade to the Three Immortal Lords of Juqu. In the seventh year of Emperor Guangwu’s Jianwu era, on the *dingsi* day of the third month, an emissary named Wu Lun offered yellow gold and jade silks to the Three Immortal Lords.\n\nMount Jijin stands to the north of Yuanfu Palace. The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that behind Greater Mount Mao and before Central Mount Mao stretches a long ridge, where a continuous outcrop of stone was known in ancient times as Mount Jijin. The location is well-suited for human habitation; one may seek out watered places to build quiet dwellings, which are most excellent. Here, one may compound the elixir to cultivate the Supreme Dao. The hermit said: \"This is indeed a hermitage.\" The present dwelling site has to its east a transverse ridge of pure stone, its forms most strange and perforated with many cavities. To the southwest rises a great stone cliff, split open to reveal a cavern within. Entering several *zhang*, the passage narrows until it no longer admits a person, yet a rushing wind issues forth.\n\nMount Jinjun is a small, solitary hill in the eastern hollow of Mount Jijin. The Lord of Fixed Records called it a branch of the Juqu range, known as Junshan. This mountain is most excellent. The hermit said: \"People today no longer know of Junshan. Its shape resembles a mushroom standing alone—or perhaps it is the character *kun* (困), shaped like a granary.\" According to the records, behind Greater Mount Mao’s long ridge and east of Mount Jijin, in a hollow, stands a solitary hill like a *boshan* censer, close to Mount Jijin—this is surely it.\n\nMount Hualao lies south of Chongxi Palace. In ancient times, the female immortal Sun Hanhua cultivated the Dao here, and a temple once stood but has long since fallen into ruin. This mountain often emits luminous phenomena at night, which some attribute to the *qi* of cinnabar mushrooms or numinous essences; local residents frequently observe it.\n\nMount Dinggong stands to the north of Chongxi Palace. Tradition holds that at the beginning of the Han, Ding Lingwei ascended to immortality here. How could one from distant Liaodong come to this mountain? Perhaps, having attained the Dao, he could manifest himself anywhere at will. Mount Ding lies east of Gongchen Valley.\n\nTiger Claw Mountain stands west of Mount Ding.\n\nMount Leiping rises above Leiping Pond, as the Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching. The residence now built by Director Xu faces east toward a small hill named Mount Leiping. In the Zhou era, the Lei clan came here to raise dragons.\n\nMount Yugang lies northeast of Lesser Mount Mao, also called Great Transverse Mountain. Its forests are dense and lush, appearing darkly luxuriant from afar, hence its name. The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that east of Mount Leiping, common folk call it Great Transverse Mountain, though its true name is Mount Yugang. This is the \"Gangshan\" mentioned in the *Record of Famous Mountains*. In ancient times, Li Ming compounded the divine elixir here and ascended to the mysterious. By the waterside, the site remains, known in antiquity as the Elixir-Refining Cloister.\n\nMount Fangyu, as the *True Instructions* states, lies northeast of Mount Leiping and southeast of Mount Liangchang, where three small hills stand in proximity like the beaks of swallows, named Mount Fangyu. Ancient adepts once compounded the Nine-Cauldron Elixir here. The Recluse delighted in dwelling here during his lifetime and often roams this place still. The *Hermit’s Record* says: \"The aforementioned Li Ming compounded the elixir here.\" The Recluse was Xu Yuan after his passing; unwilling to reveal his name, he styled himself the Recluse.\n\nMount Sangong lies southeast of Yan’kou Cave.\n\nGreen Mountain stands east of Mount Yugang; the hill to its west is named West Green Mountain.\n\nMount Magu lies west of Mount Yugang.\n\nMount Xianzhu lies south of Mount Leiping. The *Jade Cabinet Record* states that it is commonly called Solitary Woman Mountain.\n\nMount Dugong lies north of Lesser Mount Mao.\n\nLesser Bamboo Mountain lies east of Lesser Mount Mao.\n\nMount Liangchang: The *Inner Transmission of the Great Prime* states that at the northern extremity of Mount Mao, at the mouth of a cave, stands a mountain named Mount Liangchang, also connected to Juqu—essentially the same name. In the thirty-seventh year of the First Emperor of Qin, on the *guichou* day of the tenth month, he set out on his tour. In the eleventh month, he arrived at Yunmeng, where he sacrificed to Yu Shun at Mount Jiuyi. Floating down the Yangtze, he passed through Jiexi, crossed Meizhu, traversed Danyang, and reached Qiantang, where he approached the Zhe River. The waves being perilous, he turned west for one hundred and twenty *li*, crossing the strait to ascend Mount Kuaiji. There, he sacrificed to Yu the Great, gazed toward the Southern Sea, and erected a stone stele to extol the virtue of Qin at Mount Kuaiji. Li Si requested to inscribe it, and the emperor then visited the mountains and rivers. He ascended the northern extremity of Mount Juqu and buried a pair of white jades. There, he assembled his ministers, feasted his attendants, and sighed: \"The joy of imperial tours is unmatched by mountains and seas. From now on, let this be a constant practice.\" His ministers all raised toasts, hailing it as \"good and constant.\" Then, with great drums and bells resounding, ten thousand voices joined in song, startling the mountains and marshes. The rites of praise and augury being complete, all acclaimed the occasion. Thus, the northern extremity of Mount Juqu was renamed Mount Liangchang, its meaning derived from this event. It is also said that on the southwestern slope of Mount Liangchang lies a place fit for habitation, where the Lord of Destiny once had a separate residence—also suitable for elixir compounding. Further, to the southeast of Mount Liangchang is another habitable place, where piled stones resemble a censer. Occasionally, *hujisheng* trees grow there, their forms like curved canopies. This site is most excellent, though regrettably shallow. Still, it is sufficient. To the northwest of the cave mouth lies a slightly precarious spot, requiring an outer dwelling for stability.\n\nMount Taiwang lies northeast of Dingjiao Road and Liangchang, a small, pointed hill where paths run both above and below.\n\nThe First Emperor also halted here, surveying the hills and mounds.\n\nDragon Tail Mountain is a ridge extending from Greater Mount Mao to the eastern border of Jintan, resembling an external dragon.\n\nThree-Cornered Mountain lies north of Huagai Peak.\n\nHaijiang Mountain lies above Qingyun Cave. Yundui Mountain stands south of Huangfu Valley. Xianfei Mountain—*The Declarations of the Perfected* records that Jiang Shumao planted the five pungent vegetables to trade for cinnabar. *The Recluse* states: \"Now called Jiu Mountain, it lies west of Greater Mount Mao, thick with great leeks, and is commonly known as Stone Dragon Mountain.\" Aozu Mountain is west of Xianjiu Mountain. Greater Spirit Mountain and Lesser Spirit Mountain both lie west of Aozu Mountain. Bamboo Mountain is south of Dieyu Peak.\n\nWu Mountain—*The Recluse* states: \"From the south of Greater Mount Mao, past Leek Mountain, Bamboo Mountain, Wu Mountain, and Square Mountain, the ridges continue in succession, extending to the mountains of Huxing and Tianmu.\" Square Mountain—*The Declarations of the Perfected* records: \"Southwest of Greater Mount Mao is a level four-peaked mountain, commonly called Square Mountain.\" *The Recluse* adds: \"This mountain lies some twenty *li* from Greater Mount Mao, and beneath it is a cave grotto.\"\n\nFeng:\nSoulun Peak is the eastern ridge of Greater Mount Mao, as documented in *Traces of Antiquity*. Five Clouds Peak faces the southeast of Jijin Mountain. Long ago, the Three Mao Lords each appeared atop the peak riding flying clouds, witnessed by the people and reported to the regional governor. An imperial edict proclaimed: \"Thus do your resplendent clouds shine, your immortal forms distinct, able to blend the radiance of five hues and spread their canopy over the summits of the Three Maos.\" At the time, Prefect Xu was in the capital and often performed distant rites in that direction, saying: \"Gazing afar at the three peaks, I move my heart in silent accord—thus do I attain resonance, for the lofty perfected ones heed my intent.\"\n\nDaozu Peak lies on the northern side of Jijin Mountain.\n\nJade-Stacked Peak stands east of Greater Mount Mao. Canopy Peak lies east of Jade-Stacked Peak. White Cloud Peak is west of Central Mount Mao. Embracing Simplicity Peak is the northern ridge of Greater Mount Mao.\n\nLong Seclusion Ridge, also called Crouching Dragon Ridge, is described in *The Recluse*: \"The ridge lies on the southern bank of Master Guo’s Pool, a long and gently sloping mound that conceals serpents—hence its name.\" The ridge is entirely composed of fine gravel, unsuitable for dwelling. Only near its southeastern end, from Prefect Xu’s residence to the vicinity of Thunder Flat, are there habitable places. In Yixing, Jiang Fuchu and others established daily abodes at the ridge’s base, four or five *li* from Prefect Xu’s residence.\n\nWuzhi Mound lies in the Southern Grotto of Huayang. Peach Blossom Slope is north of Lesser Mount Mao, its forests and ravines secluded and profound. In spring, flowers and plants flourish in abundance, no different from the Wuling Source.\n\nArched-to-Heaven Valley, also called Arched-to-Heaven Stronghold, is northeast of Central Mount Mao. Master Liu’s encounter led to the construction of Yuanfu Palace, with an imperial decree assigning two hundred soldiers from Jiangning to patrol and sweep the area. A stronghold was thus established in the valley, as detailed in the *History of the Song*.\n\nHuangfu Valley lies on Three-Cornered Mountain. Seedling-Planting Valley is north of Three-Cornered Mountain.\n\nBlack Tiger Gully is west of the long ridge between Central and Lesser Mount Mao.\n\nThe Perfected One says: \"Heaven without name is called ‘void’; mountains without name are called ‘grottoes’; people without name are called ‘chambers.’ The hollow within a mountain is called a ‘grotto-court,’ and the hollow within a person’s head is called a ‘grotto-chamber.’ Thus do the Perfected dwell in heaven, in mountains, and in people—entering and exiting without obstruction. For just as the earth has mountains and grottoes, so too does the human body have facial cavities, through which the spirit and *qi* flow.\"\n\n*The Inner Transmission of the Great Primordial* states: \"The Grotto-Palace of Mount Gouqu has five gates: the southern two side gates, the eastern and western side gates, and the northern great side gate—together forming the five gates.\"\n\n*The Recluse* records: \"The great southern grotto of the mountain is the western side gate of the southern face. The eastern gate appears to lie within Wuzhi Mound. The Northern Eternal Grotto is the northern great side gate, while the eastern and western gates remain undiscovered.\"\n\nLord Dinglu received this teaching: \"The eastern side gate lies at the mouth of the small ridge east of Central Mount Mao, so the western side gate should also exist—now called the Stone Tomb site.\"\n\nThe Southern Grotto of Huayang is within Xiangzhi Mound at the foot of Greater Mount Mao. Pei Su, courtesy name Zhongming, prefect of Yuezhou during the Tang, crafted a pine-seed stone table for his audience with the Perfected.\n\nMao Grotto lies beneath the stone steps of Yuanyang Abbey—this is the western side gate of the southern face. Lord Dinglu received this teaching: \"Greater Mount Mao has a small cave in the south called the Southern Side Gate. By purifying oneself and fasting, directing one’s heart toward the Lord of Life, and regularly offering prayers on the second and fifteenth days to welcome and invoke the mountain, one may naturally behold me. If sincerity reaches such depth, how could the Dark Palace not be revealed? What manner of man was Zuo Ci?\"\n\nThe Huayang Grotto is the eastern side gate. Lord Dinglu received this teaching: \"East of Central Mount Mao is a small cave, barely large enough for a dog to pass—scarcely wide enough for a person to enter. Yet the deeper one goes, the more spacious it becomes. A flat stone seals the entrance, leaving only a small opening the size of a cup, guarded by the mountain spirits. This stone door occasionally opens—it is called the Hidden Gate of the Dark Palace. After purifying himself and fasting, Ziqin sought it out and entered here, finding it easier than the entrance to Eternal Grotto. Eternal Grotto has sandy paths, winding and treacherous where water flows, making passage difficult. Moreover, the road is long, not as convenient as the Small Ridge. Descending straight down from the entrance for three or four *li*, one reaches the Eastern Dark Gate of the Dark Palace. Unless one has already attained immortality, one cannot find the gate to enter.\"\n\nThe Western Grotto of Huayang lies at the eastern foot of Jijin Mountain—this is the \"wind-whistling grotto of Jijin Mountain\" mentioned in *The Recluse*. Successive dynasties deposited golden records and dragon tablets here—this is the western side gate.\n\nEternal Grotto is the northern great side gate of Huayang, governed by the Lord of Life-Preservation. Lord Dinglu received this teaching: \"At the northern edge of Eternal Grotto’s entrance, walking two hundred paces south along the mountain ridge, one finds a pair of white jade tablets buried by the First Emperor of Qin. A small flat stone on the ridge covers the burial site. Li Si inscribed the tablets with these words: ‘The sagely virtue of the First Emperor brings order to mountains and rivers. In his imperial tour of the azure streams, he engraved his inscription on pure jade.’ Wherever the First Emperor trod upon mountains and rivers, he honored them with jade tablets—not only at Gouqu.\"\n\nThe stone altar north of the grotto is where Master Xu burned incense, bowed in worship, and attained transcendence—this is the \"northern grotto’s end\" referred to in *True Reports*.\n\nLuo Gu Grotto lies west of Jinjun Mountain, named after Luo Yu, the female immortal of Mount Jiuyi. High Dwelling Grotto shares a stone boundary with Luo Gu Grotto.\n\nJade Pillar Grotto is south of the Western Grotto of Huayang, its interior filled with stalactites, leaving only narrow passages on all sides for human passage.\n\nHua Lao Grotto is on Hua Lao Mountain, named after Sun Hanhua.\n\nDengdu Grotto is at Purple Yang Abbey, as recorded in the section on Louguan.\n\nSmall Green Dragon Grotto lies above the Cinnabar Spring west of Lesser Mount Mao.\n\nHeaven’s Window Grotto is on Jijin Mountain.\n\nAzure Cliff Grotto is behind Chongshou Abbey. At its summit stands the Qinqi Pavilion, where ancient trees and perilous foundations remain.\n\nThe Female Immortal’s Grotto is thirty paces east of Azure Cliff Grotto. Its entrance, viewed from above, resembles a deep well. Tradition holds that the daughter of Master Ren attained the Dao and vanished here.\n\nWuzhi Grotto is south of the Golden Ox Cavern. Those who ventured inside once heard the sounds of wind, waves, and oars from Lake Tai.\n\nAuspicious Cloud Grotto lies at the foot of Haijiang Mountain.\n\nBlack Tiger Grotto is to the left of the Nine Bestowments Stele in the Southern Grotto of Huayang.\n\nYellow Dragon Grotto is to the right of the Nine Bestowments Stele.\n\nSouthern Dipper Grotto is at the Female Palace’s Wondrous Dharma Convent on Three-Cornered Mountain.\n\nSea Spring Grotto is in Huangfu Valley, its source deep and unfathomable.\n\nThe Water Dragon Grotto lies at the foot of White Cloud Peak.\n\nThe Swallow’s Mouth Grotto is south of Square Corner Mountain, containing cavern chambers. The Female Immortal Qian Miaozhen vanished and transformed within it. In the fifth year of the Chunyou era, Inspector Xiahou Jiazhen and the Daoist priest of Jianlong Abbey visited the grotto to present dragon tablets. That very night, thunder shook the earth, the grotto’s entrance opened, and a court clerk ventured deep inside. There he encountered a Daoist priest and a bird of paradise; after consuming it, he ceased taking grain.\n\nThe Square Corner Grotto is atop Square Corner Mountain. The *True Records* states that the Square Corner Grotto has two entrances, one of which is the Swallow’s Mouth Grotto. The grotto is named the Square Origin Lodge, and its southern passage connects to Square Mountain south of Great Mao Peak, where two additional entrances are visible from the outside.\n\nThe Master’s Grotto lies on the mountain opposite Liangchang. Confucius never entered the realm of Wu; it is unknown how it came to bear this name.\n\nThe Square Terrace Grotto is at the base of Square Mountain, containing cavern chambers with two entrances visible from the outside. It is connected to Huayang and designated as a separate secluded lodge, where those who attain the Dao reside. The common people call it the White Stone Grotto.\n\nThe Azure Dragon Grotto is on Giving Seal Mountain, over ten *li* from Square Mountain. Giving Seal Mountain is now called Ya Tou Mountain and lies within the borders of Liyang Prefecture. The *Recluse’s Record* states: “A large entrance is visible from the outside. In ancient times, someone ventured deep inside and saw a great azure serpent, hence the name Azure Dragon Grotto.” The grotto is vast and profound, accessible to those who draw near.\n\nThe Flower Canopy Crag stands above the Inkstone Pool. At the end of the Song dynasty, the imperial court summoned the county magistrate Zhang Yun to select a residence before it.\n\nThe Waiting Immortal Crag is several paces east of Azure Cliff Grotto.\n\nThe Misty Leopard Crag lies below Azure Cliff Grotto.\n\nThe Jasper Crag stands above Cinnabar Valley Spring.\n\nThe Assembly of Perfected Crag is beside Mao Grotto.\n\nThe Grotto Where Perfected Qian Recited Scriptures is above Swallow’s Mouth Grotto.\n\nThe Golden Ox Cavern is east of Wuzhi Grotto. During the Qin dynasty, gold was mined here, and a golden ox was unearthed. When a woman touched it, the ox was cast aside and could not be retrieved. Pursuing it to Dingjiao, the place was henceforth named Upper and Lower Barrier. Another account speaks of the “Thundering Ox,” which plunged into the sea and was never seen again. The *Gazetteer of Geography* also mentions a stone here.\n\nThe Winding Water Cavern lies below Azure Cliff.\n\n*Record of Mount Mao*, Scroll Six—concluded.\n*Record of Mount Mao*, Scroll Seven.\n\nMaster Liu Dabin, Successor of the Supreme Clarity Lineage, composed *The Boundaries of the Divine Realm*:\n\n**Waterways**\n\nThe Eastern and Western Streams of King Chu converge at the former site of Chongxi Abbey—these, along with the three waters of Huayang’s Western Grotto, merge and flow directly before Chongxi Abbey. In ancient times, King Wei of Chu once rested here, hence the name.\n\n*The Recluse’s Record* states: To the east of the Recluse’s present dwelling lies a transverse ridge. To the southwest stands a great stone cliff, within which is a grotto. A few paces outside, a spring gushes forth, its waters clear in both winter and summer—this is the source for the lower abbey’s needs. Near the outer grotto’s mouth, another spring surges upward, its flow swift, warm in winter and cool in summer, directly facing the small path ahead. Below, yet another cavernous spring wells forth, most extraordinary. Neither great floods nor severe droughts alter its volume; its waters are slightly white, sweet, and soft, flowing endlessly. The only regret is that it lies entirely on the mountain’s western side, unable to flow eastward. Note: The transverse ridge is Grotto Ridge, the lower abbey is Chongxi Abbey, and this waterway is the Stream of King Chu.\n\n**Crane Terrace Stream**—*The Recluse’s Record* states: Crossing Accumulated Gold Ridge to the southeast, a stone cavern appears, its waters flowing eastward most beautifully. The site is secluded and well-suited for compounding the elixir, directly before Mushroom Mountain and Peach Pond Stream.\n\n**Spring of Renewed Joy** lies east of Central Mao Peak. Master Ren once used its eastward-flowing waters to compound the elixir, directly before the ancient Grotto-Heaven’s Pass.\n\n**Nine-Bend Stream**—a tributary descending from the left flank of Great Mao Peak, emptying into Ten-Thousand Reeds Pool.\n\n**Great Stream** lies east of Golden Mushroom Mountain.\n\n**Flowing Goblet Bend** is west of Thunder Flat Mountain.\n\n**Jade Standard Stream** lies two *li* west of Great Mao Peak. Master Guo Sichao once cultivated *Kerria* there.\n\n**White Plum Creek** lies north of Lesser Mao Peak, where Lord Zhan planted white plums.\n\n**Azure Dragon Creek** is west of Constant Virtue Mountain, commonly called Tinkling Water Stream.\n\n**Guest-Welcoming Spring** lies north of Great Mao Peak, beside a square pond several *chi* deep. When guests arrive, the spring leaps and bubbles; if one approaches with noise or commotion, it stills and does not stir—another marvel. A hut here is tended by Sun Hanhua for incense offerings.\n\n**Beneficial Spring** lies on the eastern ridge of Great Mao Peak. *The Hidden Decisions on Ascending to Perfection* states: To the left and right of the Celestial Market Altar are springs, all golden and jade-like essences. Drinking them benefits one, hence the name.\n\n**Jade Butterfly Spring** lies on the western slope of Soughing Pinnacle. Two mouths hold the spring, one freezing and one warm in winter, also called the Yin-Yang Well.\n\n**White Jade Spring**\n**Numinous Spring** is atop Accumulated Gold Mountain.\n\n**Grotto Spring** is the pool beneath Immortal-Bridging Bridge.\n\n**Jade Sand Spring** lies west of Central Mao Peak. Lord Director of Destinies buried Western Hu jade-gate cinnabar on Central Mao’s Dark Ridge, and the spring’s waters, when drunk, benefit one.\n\n**Cinnabar Spring** lies west of Lesser Mao Peak.\n\n**Deer-Trod Spring** is to the left of Great Luo Source. Ancient adepts cultivated here, and a transcendent deer caused this spring to emerge.\n\n**Hundred-Fathom Spring** lies in Arching Dawn Valley.\n\n**Lock-and-Drink Spring** is on the southern slope of Great Mao Peak, its waters milky in hue.\n\n**Sea-Eye Springs**—two in number. One, according to old records, lies at Yang the Academician’s mountain lodge. Its waters surge in response to the tides, located between Accumulated Gold and Central Mao to the west; the present spring in Western Garden is it. The other lies west of Inkstone Pool.\n\n**Cinnabar Valley Spring** is east of Auspicious Cloud Grotto. Once, a Daoist drew its waters to compound the elixir, but a youth substituted other water. The Daoist detected this, and thus the name.\n\n**Lord Tian’s Spring**\n**Lord Tao’s Spring** is in Huangfu Valley.\n\n**Jade Fluid Springs**—two in number. One lies north of the Immortal’s Stone-Cradling Peak. Its waters are sweet and fragrant, faintly milky, curing all abdominal ailments. Today, its waters appear pure white, also called White Spring. The other lies at Jade Fluid Hut on Three-Cornered Mountain.\n\n**Hand-Clapping Spring**, also called Winter-Warm Spring, is below the Terrace Where Xiao Zhaoming Read. Upon hearing the sound of clapping, the spring surges like boiling water, its square pond always brimming.\n\n**Single-Scoop Spring** is on the cliff behind the Terrace Where Xiao Zhaoming Read.\n\n**Celestial Pool** lies atop Great Mao Peak, the abode of divine dragons, never drying even in great drought.\n\n**Dragon-Rearing Pool** is at Celestial Sage Abbey. During the *Dazhong Xiangfu* era, an imperial edict urged the retrieval of a dragon’s offspring, and an imperial ode was composed to send it back to the mountain.\n\n**Jade Pool** is before the Jade Emperor Hall at Celestial Sage Abbey.\n\n**Life-Release Pool** is east of Changning Town.\n\n**Inkstone Pool**, also called Sweetflag Pool. Fei Zhangfang of the Han studied the Dao here. When he inscribed talismans and rinsed his inkstone, the stream’s stones all turned black. Even today, using its waters to compound medicines yields extraordinary efficacy.\n\n**Jade Nectar Pool** is before Longevity Abbey.\n\n**Master Zhou’s Pool**—the pool of Zhou Ziliang, disciple of the Recluse, is at Numinous Treasure Cloister.\n\n**Thunder Flat Pool**\n**Guo’s Pond** lies several *li* east of Long-Hidden Mountain. The village is named Guo’s Pond after Master Guo Sichao’s external alchemy. Its waters remain perpetually full; when villagers drain it, thunder and lightning strike. Even now, prayers for rain here prove efficacious. On days when the Perfected are honored, rare fragrances assail one.\n\n**Lord Recorder of Destinies received the mandate.**\n\nThe Four Perfected Ones once dispatched followers to cultivate this land. Year after year, whenever the Four Perfected traveled, they would pass through this mountain to compose their thoughts and survey the plains and hills.\n\n**Crimson Stone Pond**\n**Plum Family Pond** lies west of the Sea-Eye Spring.\n**Tao’s Pond** is west of Thunder Flat Mountain.\n**Protector-General Pool**, where Xu the Chief Clerk of the Outer Guard practiced external alchemy, stands beside Dingjiao Road. Each time he returned from abroad, he would first bathe here, purify himself, and only then enter the mountain—such was his reverence.\n\n**White Tortoise Pool** lies before String-of-Pearls Mountain. During the Liang Tianjian era, Zhou Ziliang, disciple of the Recluse, built the Vermilion Yang Lodge as a quiet chamber. After thatching the roof with reeds, he gathered the leftover stalks and discovered a white tortoise, about six or seven *cun* long. Its body, scales, and shell were smooth and white as talc, save for black markings on its cheeks resembling talismanic script—though indecipherable. He caught it, played with it, then released it into the pool. After swimming several hundred paces away, it returned to the pile of reeds, a manifest auspicious sign. For details, see *Zhou’s Records of Mystic Communication*.\n\n**Great Luo Source** lies west of Central Mao.\n**Paulownia Blossom Source** is above Crane Terrace Gorge.\n**Rosy Canopy Sea** lies above Paulownia Blossom Source.\n**Cinnabar Pool** is east of Swallow Mouth Cave.\n**Yang Valley Yi**—as *The Inner Transmission of the Great Primordial* and the *Golden Mound Grotto-Heaven* of Jinling record in detail.\n\nThe *Recluse’s Records* state: Yang Valley Yi rises before Central Mao, behind Great Mao, where several streams converge to form a single confluence. For accounts of other unrecorded waters, see the *Traces of Antiquity* chapter.\n\n**Altar-Stone Bridge Pavilion**\n**Nine-Tiered Altar**—there are two. One stands at Qianyuan Abbey, built by Zhu Guanmiao. The other is the Supreme Clarity Lineage Altar.\n**Preceptor-Worship Altar** stands atop Thunder Flat Peak, erected by Wang Zhensu of the Southern Tang.\n**Fire Court Altar** is at Mystic Continent Hermitage.\n**Eight Trigrams Terrace** lies east of Mao Grotto.\n**Fairy Maiden’s Terrace** is on Piled Jade Peak.\n**Angler’s Terrace** is the sheer rock south of Central Mao Ridge.\n**Crane Terrace** lies behind Golden Mushroom Mountain.\n**Crane Temple Peak** is west of Central Mao.\n**Phoenix Slope** is before Crane Terrace.\n**Golden Star Ridge** lies south of Piled Jade Peak, where golden sand covers the ground.\n**Green Jade Gorge** is east of Dinggong Mountain, a landscape of strange stones and wooded hills—the former site of Deep Secluded Pavilion.\n**Climb-the-Clouds Steps** are below Azure Cliff, inscribed with Xu Kai’s great seal script on stone.\n**Master Tao’s Drunken Stone** is on Central Mao Ridge.\n**Immortals’ Offering Stone** appears as if borne by figures in the mountain hollow, at the western slope of Great Mao.\n**Cloud-Root Stone** lies below White Cloud Peak.\n**Go Board** is atop White Cloud Peak.\n**Moving Stone** stands on Central Mao’s summit—one person can shift it, but many cannot budge it.\n\n**Descending Perfection Bridge** is thirty *li* west of Lesser Mao on the Jurong Road.\n**Communing Immortals Bridge** lies below the ridge of Yuanfu Palace, built when Master Liu founded the palace during the Chongning era.\n**Perpetual Peace Bridge** is at Perpetual Peace Town.\n**Swallow Cave Stone**—a bridge spans the chasm between two cliffs, its shape like a sword unsheathed.\n\n**Embroidered Robe Pavilion**, traditionally said to be where the Great Lord of Destiny received the Nine Bestowals. Today, it is identified as the western ridge of Great Mao, where two or three towering stones stand facing west, with a small level area beneath the southern cliff marking the former foundation.\n\n**Nine Bestowals Pavilion** is in the Southern Grotto, sheltering the stone pillar inscribed with the Nine Bestowals in seal script. The inscription reads: *\"Xu Kai, Natural Disciple, respectfully visits Huayang Grotto-Heaven.\"* Tang and Song inscriptions remain, though most are broken.\n\n**Azure Cliff Pavilion** stands below Azure Cliff Grotto, preserving the inscribed plaque of Song Chancellor Shi Hao [character missing].\n**Qinchi Pavilion** is above Azure Cliff Grotto.\n**Embroidered Feather Pavilion** is at Blessed Well, sheltering the well’s inscribed stele.\n**Facing the Perfected Pavilion** is at the western gate of Huayang Grotto.\n**Facing the Mountain Pavilion** is at the northern slope of Great Mao.\n**Mid-Mountain Pavilion** is halfway up Great Mao.\n**Spring Welcome Pavilion** is in Gongzhan Valley.\n**Rosy Cloud Pavilion** is before Central Mao.\n**White Cloud Pavilion** is north of Central Mao.\n**Western Tortoise Pavilion** is above Willow Bend.\n**Greeting Grace Pavilion** is north of Perpetual Peace Town.\n\n**Perpetual Peace Town** lies fifty *li* southeast of Jurong County and sixty-five *li* west of Jintan County. During the Tiansheng era of the Song, Zhu Guanmiao petitioned the court to establish it as a resting place for travelers and merchants.\n\n**Northern Town** is west of Jade Dawn Abbey.\n**Western Garden** is on level ground west of Accumulated Gold Mountain.\n**Deer Grave** lies beside the main road south of the mountain—see *The Transmission of Master Liu*.\n\n*Record of Mount Mao, Scroll Seven* concludes.\n*Record of Mount Mao, Scroll Eight* begins.\n\n**The \"Investigation of Antiquity\" by Liu Dabin, Successive Master of Highest Clarity**\n\n**Heavenly Market Altar**, as recorded by Lord Ya Yan of the Register of Destiny: Beneath the stone of Heavenly Market Altar lies the very center of the Grotto-Heaven, above the Mystic Window. This stone originates from the Heavenly Market Mountain of Anxi, whence its name. During the reign of the Dark Emperor, the gods of the Four Seas were summoned to transport this massive stone to the summit of the Grotto-Heaven. Ancient records place it atop Accumulated Gold Mountain.\n\n*The Recluse* states: The location of the Heavenly Market Altar stone remains uncertain. Judging by the *Swift Wheel’s* proximity, it likely lies near Great Mao. Yet it seems improbable that the center of the Grotto-Heaven would be so close to the southern gate—perhaps it is near Central Mao. Even the village elders no longer know its whereabouts.\n\nAnother account: The **Immortal’s Market Altar**. In *True Reports*, Zhao Weibo, the Life-Preserving Minister, was skilled in whistling—his calls resembled a chorus of a hundred birds, or the wind rushing through forests, or the sound of drums. At times, he would ascend the Heavenly Market Altar, shake his beard toward the north, and whistle to summon the wind. Soon, clouds would gather above him, *qi* would stir the woods, and dark mists would descend, bringing gentle rain.\n\n**Swift Wheel’s Edge**, as recorded in *True Reports*: Once, the Green Lad of the Eastern Sea rode a flying chariot drawn by a single swift wheel, traversing the mountains of You Terrace. *The Recluse* notes: Today, on the ridge of Great Mao, a road runs eastward—its sides leveled as if by human labor, wide enough for carts. Tradition holds this to be the Swift Wheel’s Edge. The Perfected often ride nine dragons, the left named *Swift*, the right named *Reverent*. Having ascended the mountain’s summit, they are said to mount the left dragon.\n\n**Jiangba Road**, as recorded by Lord Ya Yan of the Register of Destiny: During the Qin, the Daoist Zhou Taibin and Jiang Shumao, the Marquis of Baling, came to dwell at the mountain’s foot. They planted the five fruits and the five pungent vegetables. Shumao was enfeoffed as marquis during the reign of King Xiao of Qin, hence the name of this place. *The Recluse* states: The main road from Little Mao leads to Yanling and is called Jiangba Road. However, during the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin, the state of Chu had not yet been annexed and divided into commanderies, and Baling County was first established in the early Jin. It is unclear how there could have been a marquisate of Baling—likely it refers to Ba of Shu.\n\n**Thunder Level Pond** lies before Thunder Level Mountain. *True Reports* records that during the Zhou, the Lei clan raised dragons here. Lord Wei Yan of the Register of Destiny states: The pond before the abode was constructed by Guo Sichao. Its embankments were raised to deepen the water, but over the ages, the walls have crumbled.\n\nSichao often rowed a small boat upon the pond, striking the sides as he sang:\n\n*I.*\nA clear pond girds the numinous peak,\nLong woods lush with verdant green.\nDark birds hide in secluded wilds,\nWords of ease flow unconstrained.\nRowing oars upon the spirit waves,\nI bow, yearning for the morning breeze.\nYet the hour of liberation eludes,\nAnd I wander amid the forest of blades.\n\n*II.*\nBeyond the Nine Abysses, the Wave Spirit,\nI refine the Dao to attain golden perfection.\nI sheathe these spirit-phoenix wings,\nConceal my radiant dragon scales.\nLifting high this inch of heart,\nTen thousand gusts are but dust and grime.\nPity the mayfly born at dawn—\nWho can exhaust your turning wheel?\n\n*III.*\nRoaming the void, the flying swift descends,\nA spirit’s step leaves no trace.\nThe round sun gleams with bright rosy clouds,\nNine phoenixes sing at dawn.\nBeating wings, they fan the River of Heaven,\nEvening mists and auspicious clouds soar.\nAt last I reach the Palace of Grand Tenuity,\nEmbracing this golden pear nectar.\nWandering beyond the dark abyss,\nNeither existing nor ceasing to be.\n\n*IV.*\nRiding the swift, I pity the divine clouds,\nDonning rosy hues beneath nine suns.\nThe High Emperor’s dragon chariot aligns,\nAt last I reach the Northern Flower Chamber.\nSpirit tigers dwell in the agate grove,\nWind and clouds merge as one.\nOpening and closing the gates of dark mystery,\nThe numinous transformations vanish without trace.\n\nThe villagers below the mountain still call it a level marsh.\n\nThe \"Guo Gan of the Earth\" remains a surname from the Four Dynasties still spoken of among the people. Regarding Red Stone Pond, in a letter dated the first day of the third month from Lord Dinglu to Prefect Xu, it is written: \"Now we must reclaim the fields at Red Stone to serve as a path for comings and goings, yet the task was never completed.\" Prefect Xu replied: \"Long ago, we surveyed the Red Stone fields, finding them advantageous near the mountain’s base for travel, a matter of sincere devotion. But then came drought, the tenants reaped no harvest, and the pond’s collapse required immediate labor—this was a matter of strength unfulfilled, not of waning resolve. Now, dwelling at the mountain’s foot, we ought to restore the fields, though their distance from the cave’s entrance makes us reluctant to settle there.\"\n\n*The Recluse* states: \"These fields lie west of Great Mao and Central Mao, close to the great mountain, offering an excellent vantage for reverence and worship. Yet when it speaks of their distance from the cave’s entrance, it must refer to the northern cave’s entrance. Though the fields are fed by mountain streams, water dwindles in drought. The pond is also difficult to establish—who knows if they will ever reclaim them? The embankment still lacks repairs; with several hundred laborers, it could irrigate ten or so *qing* of land. The disciples at the Recluse’s lodge also sow crops here with the flowing water, ever wishing to restore this pond to benefit both near and far, and to bestow kindness upon the common folk.\"\n\nTian Gong Spring, also called Liu Fen Spring or Liu Valley Spring, lies one *li* southeast of Thunder Flat Pond. Lord Dinglu, mute of speech, said that on Huayang’s Thunder Flat Mountain there is a Tian Gong Spring whose waters expel the three worms from the abdomen, matching the flavor of the Recluse’s Spring. It is said to be a flow of jade sand, and when used to launder clothes, no ash is needed—this sets it apart. Long ago, a man named Tian Shu lived on Thunder Flat Mountain; after attaining the Dao, the spring was named in his honor.\n\nThe Cinnabar Well of Lord Mao lies within the Lower Resting Palace. The well of Perfected Li, where Perfected Li Ming of the Dark Continent refined cinnabar, is located east of the Yugang Square Grotto. The well of Prefect Xu is at Jade Dawn Abbey. *The Recluse* records: \"In the seventh year of the Great Brightness era, an elder from Xu Village named Xu Ou said his ancestors had served Prefect Xu, passing down that this residence once stood where the present-day thicket lies. The former site of the scholar’s hall should be where the wutong trees now grow, and the old well still existed at the time, though overgrown with weeds. Clearing the brush, they found it—a brick well nearly filled with earth. They dug it out, reinforced its walls, and now it yields fine water, slightly white in hue, said to resemble the taste of the water outside Phoenix Gate in Chang’an. Two mouths share one source; in winter, one is cold, the other warm—hence its name, the Yin-Yang Well.\"\n\nThe well of Ge Hong lies at Embracing Simplicity Mountain Hut in Zhichuan. Xu Huangmin of Danyang in Jurong, a grandson of Prefect Xu, married the granddaughter of Zhichuan and lived on this mountain, as handed down through generations. The cinnabar well of Perfected Tao is located east of the stone bridge before the Upper Lodge of Huayang. Its water is sweet and clear, never failing even in drought. At the beginning of the Zhenghe era, the Daoist Zhuang Shenzi sought and restored it. After removing three *chi* of earth, they uncovered a stone well with a broken railing, which they reassembled, leaving it mostly intact. Carved around it in large characters were the words: \"The Master, Tao Shiqí, Gentleman in Attendance of the Southern Qi court, came to this mountain in the *renshen* year. Dwelling in lofty seclusion, he styled himself *The Recluse*. His disciples who accompanied him included Lu Jingyou of Wu Commandery, and others named Yang, Wang, Wu, Dai, Chen, and Xu. Those who offered provisions—Pan Luo of Husu in the Palace Service, and disciples from near and far—are too numerous to record. Through the long ages, let none forget.\"\n\nIn the eighth month and fifteenth day of the third year of the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, Chen Maoxuan of Qiantang inscribed and unearthed a brick bearing Sanskrit characters. After excavating several *zhang* deeper, they recovered a round inkstone, approximately nine *cun* in diameter, with eleven toes arranged around its edge. When washed, its vermilion hue remained vivid. They also found a bronze incense burner with a magpie-tail design, and amidst the sand and stones, a single grain of cinnabar, as large as a lotus seed, its radiance dazzling the eye. Eager to retrieve it, they reached for it, only for it to slip and fall into the well.\n\nThe burner and inkstone were stored at Huayang, but were lost during the ravages of war. Another well lies beside the pond of Master Zhou at Lingbao Abbey—this too was the Recluse’s cinnabar well.\n\nThe *Zhen’gao* of Zhaozhen Terrace, annotated by Jian Shu in *Wings of the True Canon*, often speaks of \"returning the seal to Zhaotai.\" This refers to the Recluse’s lineage, which practiced the supreme methods of the Three Perfected Ones—Yang and Xu.\n\nThis was the chamber for storing scriptures. After prolonged pillaging in the mountains, the sacred texts and authentic traces have scattered without a trace. Though scholars may be earnest in their pursuit, how could they ever again behold the handiwork of the Perfected? One can only sigh in lament.\n\nYuchen Abbey and Lingbao Abbey occupy this site. The Azure Altar and the Plain Pagoda—according to the old altar stele of the abbey—stood with the Azure Altar to the east and the Plain Pagoda to the west. Today, the pagoda has fallen into ruin, and the altar is no longer as it once was. Both were built by the Recluse to symbolize the dual cultivation of the Two Teachings, and should be located at Yuchen Abbey.\n\nThe Well of Prince Zhaoming’s Blessed Village lies east of the Reading Terrace in the Southern Grotto. The Reading Terrace of Prince Zhaoming stands above the Well of Blessed Village. The Altar of the Ming Emperor’s Register is beside the Jade Pillar Grotto.\n\nThe tomb of King Yue Yi lies at the foot of Great Horizontal Mountain. The Mute Lord of the Register, on the eastern face of Yugang Mountain, speaks of an ancient tomb of King Yue Yi. The *Records of the Recluse* state: King Yue Yi was the fourth-generation descendant of Goujian. Initially refusing to ascend the throne, he fled into a cave on Mount Xu, but the people of the state smoked him out. Later, during the reign of King Wu of Yue, he was relocated back to Kuaiji, only to be slain by Sun Zhujiu in the eleventh year of King Xuan of Zhou. How he came to be buried so far away remains unknown—perhaps there was something numinous about this place.\n\nUpon present inspection, no definitive tomb mound is found, yet there appears to be a site marked for burial. Further examination reveals that the virtuous and retiring King Wu Taibo initially fled into the Zhong Mountains of Juqu. Thus, it is evident that this mountain has been a refuge for sages and worthies since antiquity.\n\nThe Recluse’s Secluded Lodge stands southwest of Mount Leiping. In the early Yuanyou era of the Song, the court eunuch Luo Chunyi studied the Dao in these mountains and once contemplated seclusion here. He possessed rare cinnabar and esoteric texts. One day, he opened a tomb to examine it and found only an empty coffin suspended by an iron chain, containing nothing but a sword and a bowl-mirror. The walls of the tomb were encircled by Sanskrit inscriptions in relief, forming a text that read: *\"The Secluded Lodge of Huayang, where the Bodhisattva of Supreme Strength offered his body, disciple of Śākyamuni Buddha, servant of the Supreme Dao Lord, cultivating the Six Perfections of the Mahāyāna. The Three Perfected Ones of □□, resting in the sacred peaks to guard the frontier, roaming the great void to lodge the spirit.\"* The calligraphy was divinely wondrous, surely inscribed by the recluse himself. After the tomb was opened, the Daoist disciples copied these talismanic characters to show the world. Later, Chunyi also attained the Dao of corpse-liberation. This account was transmitted in the sixth year of Yuanyou by Lin Xizi of Changle.\n\nThe Recluse’s Alchemical Furnace lies beside the Upper Lodge of Huayang. When tested with water from the xun direction, the ground swiftly dries, forming a halo like the moon’s corona.\n\nThe tomb of Master Wang Fa lies east of the northern road in Changning Town. The Tang-era stone pillar of Taiping Abbey still stands there.\n\nThe tomb of Master Tongwu lies to the right of the Recluse’s Secluded Lodge. The tomb of Master Xuanjing lies southwest of Fuling Ridge, twenty paces from Leiping Pond. The tomb of Master Wei the Patriarch lies to the left of Master Xuanjing’s funerary palace.\n\n*Record of Mount Mao, Scroll Eight* (concluded)\n\n*Record of Mount Mao, Scroll Nine*\nComposed by the Lineal Master of the Highest Clarity Tradition, Liu Dabin\n\n**Register of Daoist Mountains**\n*The Five Thousand Character Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue/Power*\nAccording to the *True Register of Ascent* and *The Recluse*, the *Laozi’s Scripture of the Dao and Its Virtue/Power* exists in a hand-copied version by the Perfected Master Yang, transmitted from the ancient text of Zhang Zhennan. Zhennan was the third-generation master in the lineage of the Han Celestial Master, whom Emperor Wu of Wei enfeoffed as General Who Pacifies the South. The so-called *Five Thousand Character Scripture* indeed contains five thousand characters. The *Inner Scripture of the Lineal Masters* records 4,999 characters, with one character traditionally missing. For instance, \"thirty spokes\" was written as \"卅 spokes\" (卅 being a simplified form), which is not the orthodox character. The authentic traces of the lineage are no longer extant; the transmitted *Five Thousand Character Scripture* is now regarded as the standard version, divided into two sections without chapter divisions.\n\n**Catalogue of the *Highest Clarity Great Cavern Precious Scriptures***\n*The Highest Clarity Great Cavern Scripture of the Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Loftiest*\n*The Highest Clarity

To his left, he is girded by the Divine Tiger; to his right, he bears the Golden Perfected. His dragon crown and phoenix skirt are draped with a feathered cloak of brocade. His attendants—Heavenly Perfected, Jade Lads, and Jade Maidens—number thirty thousand each. The term \"Most High\" signifies one who scrutinizes the roots of the Dao and penetrates its origins, hence the Lord of the Highest Clarity is the teacher of Lord Lao and the sovereign of the myriad Dao. There is a transmission record titled *The Eight Simplicities of the Upper Scripture*, also known as *The Hidden Writ of the Most High: The Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of the Seven Origins and Eight Effulgences Flying Scripture*. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* refers to the Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao as the Most High, the true honor of the Most High.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Purple Palace Heavenly Emperor of the Great Dao of the Supreme Subtlety**\nThe Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety is the sovereign of the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, governing within the Purple Palace of the Supreme Subtlety. He is addressed by the Golden Pavilion Emperor Lord with the sixteen characters of the Five Emperors of the Sun’s Center: Solar Essence, Pearl Radiance, Illuminating Veil, Green Summons, Returning Radiance, Crimson Youth, Mystic Flame, and Terrace Image. These are the methods of ingesting flying roots, also called *The Scripture of Cinnabar, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, Water Mother, and Jade Embryo*. The Emperor bestows these upon the Perfected.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Posterior Sagely Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Golden Pavilion Imperial Palace**\nThe Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Upper Dao is of the lineage of the Earthly August. He resides in the Palace of Jasper Terraces, attended by thirty thousand maidens and officials. Ascending to the Highest Clarity, roaming the Great Ultimate, and governing the Ten Heavens below, he rides the Flying Chariot of the Three Simplicities. In secret, he inspects the Dark and Absolute, the Terrace of Luminous Solitude, the various heavens, rivers, and seas, soaring to the Lesser Existence. He halts his carriage at Tortoise Mountain to examine and test the multitude of immortals, conferring ranks according to their talents. Every five years, he descends for a tour; every ten thousand years, he pays homage to the Highest Clarity. There is a transmission record titled *The Purple Writ of the Numinous Book*, also known as *The Precious Scripture of the Five Elders*—today’s *Arrayed Records of the Three Heavens*.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Jade Protector King of the Nine Subtleties of the Highest Clarity, the Grand Minister of Fate of the Golden Pavilion, the Highest Dawn Master, the Jade Radiance Azure Florescence Lad of the Eastern Sea, the Great Dao Lord**\nThe Azure Lad is also called the Azure Canopy Purple Lad and the Perfected within the Dipper. He governs within the Cinnabar Pavilion of the Yellow Chamber of the Eastern Sea’s Great Square Torch Palace on the Eastern Florescence Mountain. He rides the cloud chariot of streaming azure radiance, girded with a flying azure feathered cloak, attended by a thousand Perfected of the Mulberry Grove. He fed the *Scripture of the Three Origins and the True Unity* to Master Juanzi and the *Scripture of Demonic Dispersion* to the Red Perfected of the Great Void. During the Jin dynasty, he descended to the household of Lady Wei. On the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month, he would arrive at Mount Gouqu together with the Minister of Fate of the Mao to examine and assess the learning of the Perfected. There is a transmission record titled *The Scripture of the Jade Protector’s Grotto Vision*, also called *The Upper Mystery of the Cloud Forest*.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Grand Minister of the Golden Pavilion, the Governor of the Western Limits, the Lord of the Western City, the Sovereign of the Myriad Perfected**\nThe Sovereign of the Myriad Perfected, surnamed Wang and named Yuan, styled Fangping, governed the Western City Mountain of Yizhou, the very seat of the Western Limits’ governance of the Myriad Perfected. He oversaw five thousand immortal officials at his abode and was the teacher of the Minister of Fate of the Mao. He once descended to the household of Cai Jing and met with Ma Gu. In the renwu year of the first Han’an era, he descended from Lord Lao to Mount Heming, where he fed the Celestial Master Zhang Daoling a thousand scrolls of scriptures and talismans. He then descended to Mount Yangluo and fed the *Upper Scripture of the Pure Void* in thirty-three scrolls to the Pure Void Perfected. During the Jin dynasty, he again descended to Mount Yangluo, where he fed the Dao to Lady Wei and bestowed the methods of the Three Perfected upon Yang and Xu. Each year on the second day, he would roam and inspect Huayang together with the Minister of Fate of the Mao, examining and assessing the male and female learners of the Perfected to determine who would become immortals. Chengdu, Guacang, and Kunlun all serve as the immortal seats of the Sovereign of the Myriad Perfected. Lord Wang governs the teachings of the Great Peace and the Twenty-Four Perfected, serving as the master of the Three Caverns.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Heavenly King of Lesser Existence, the Pure Void Lord of the Great Simplicity**\nThe Pure Void Perfected, surnamed Wang and named Bao, styled Zideng, was a native of Xiangping in Fanyang. He was the seventh-generation descendant of the Marquis of An’guo, born on the twenty-seventh day of the ninth month in the third year of the Jianzhao era of Emperor Yuan of Han. His father was the Literary Marquis Mi, and his mother was the granddaughter of Sima Qian. The Perfected studied the Dao on Mount Huayin, where he was moved by the descent of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, who fed him the upper methods. The Sovereign of the Myriad Perfected bestowed upon him *The Upper Scripture* in thirty-one scrolls, and he became a master of covenant transmission. Together, they journeyed to the Dark Continent, where he petitioned for his true name to be recorded. He then returned to the Western City and proceeded to the Three Origins Lord of the Great Simplicity, where he received the *Flying Dawn Divine Staff and Jade Seal of the Flowing Gold, the Seven Origins, and the Eight Effulgences*. The Most High sent gifts: a feathered canopy of dawn plumes, a pair of pearls of moon-bright plain feathers, a jasper shaft, a cinnabar cord, and a brocade banner. He also dispatched a decree of investiture. His rank was established as the Pure Void Perfected of the Great Simplicity, the Left Protector and Upper Duke of the Three Origins and Four Offices of the Heavenly King of Lesser Existence. He governed Mount Wangwu, attended by three hundred Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, and oversaw the precious scriptures. He rode a chariot drawn by tigers and dragons, with a golden canopy and a jasper wheel, the Flying Chariot of the Eight Effulgences, wielding the staff of nine hues. He entered and exited the Highest Clarity, served the Great Simplicity, and reposed in the Great Ultimate.\n\nThe *Shangqing Scriptures* record that by this time, the sacred transmissions from the Seven Heavens had descended to the world seven times.\n\nThe first lineage-holder of the Shangqing tradition, the Grand Preceptor and Daoist Sovereign of the Shangqing, the Perfected of the Southern Culmen and Purple Authenticity, the Sagely Protector of the Supreme Microcosm and Jade Dawn, the Sagely Empress—who governed the Southern Marchmount’s Perfected of the Upper Realms and oversaw the life-destinies of the lofty and numinous, the Illuminator of the Purple Void and Primal Dao, the Perfected Sovereign of the Highest Origin—was surnamed Wei, named Huacun, styled Xian’an, a native of Rencheng. She was the daughter of Wei Shu, Minister of Works in the Jin dynasty, and was born in the third year of the Jiaping reign of King Jia of the Wei kingdom, the xinwei year. Gifted with extraordinary talent and a transcendent spirit, she stood apart from the common. From childhood, she studied the books of Laozi and Zhuangzi, ingested sesame and poria powders, and longed for seclusion. At twenty-four, her parents compelled her to marry Liu Youyan of Nanyang, bearing two sons, Pu and Xia. When Youyan served as magistrate of Xiwu County in Jijun, and their sons had grown to maturity, she withdrew to a separate chamber, resumed her original garb, and devoted herself to cultivation.\n\nIn the twelfth month of the ninth year of the Taikang reign, the wushen year, on the sixteenth day, at midnight, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Lord of the Azure Lads, the Perfected Wang Jinglin of Fusang and the Yang Valley, and the Perfected of the Pure Void descended, addressing the Perfected Sovereign: “We have heard that you have secretly woven the true qi. The Supreme Thearch has commanded us to transmit to you the Way of the divine perfected.” Thereupon, they presented thirty-one scrolls of the Most High’s treasured texts, including the *Hidden Writ of the Eight Simplicities*, the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, and the *Mysterious Wings of the Lofty Transcendents*, personally bestowing them upon the Perfected Sovereign with the words: “These scriptures were once entrusted to the Master of All Perfected in the Western City. Now we pass them to you.” They also instructed her in the oral secrets of visualization, meditation, and practice before departing. The Perfected Sovereign was then thirty-seven.\n\nLater, Youyan passed away. Her eldest son, Pu, rose to Minister of Works and Marshal of Qi; her younger son, Xia, served as Attendant to the Grand Commandant Tao and later as Administrator of Ancheng and Gentleman of the Palace. The Perfected Sovereign lived eighty-three years in the world. In the ninth year of the Xianhe reign, the jiawu year, the Lord of the Pure Void and Azure Lads descended again, bestowing two doses of divine elixir and commanding her to consume them at once, setting a date to meet at the Yangluo Palace. On the seventh day at midnight, the Great Unity dispatched a whirlwind chariot to welcome her. Employing the Way of Concealed Radiance, the Perfected Sovereign transformed her form and spirit, ascending to Mount Yangluo.\n\nThe following day, the Lord of the Azure Lads, the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Lord of the Pure Void, and forty-seven other perfected descended to instruct the Perfected Sovereign in the Cloud Terrace of the Hidden Grotto. Each perfected imparted their supreme teachings for three days before departing. The Perfected Sovereign studied and recited the jade scriptures for sixteen years, her countenance becoming like that of a maiden.\n\nThereafter, the Queen Mother of the West and the Perfected Sovereign of the Southern Culmen came to welcome her ascent. At dawn, she arrived at the Shangqing Palace. The Lord of the Great Dao of the Jade Dawn and Jade Clarity, the Heavenly Thearch of the Supreme Microcosm, and the Sagely Empress of the Golden Portal each sent envoys to confer investiture, bestowing upon her jade tablets and golden texts. Her rank was established as the Perfected Sovereign of the Purple Void, governing the Perfected of the Upper Realms and life-destinies of the Southern Marchmount, her position equivalent to that of a Transcendent Duke. She was charged with overseeing the teaching of aspiring transcendents at the Great Huo Mountain within the Terrace of Heavenly Platform. She also held banquets in the Palace of the Pure Void.\n\nSubsequently, the life-destiny spirits and transcendents of the Southern Marchmount requested to be placed under her authority. As her welcoming procession arrived, the various perfected accompanied the Perfected Sovereign to the Terrace of Heavenly Platform on Mount Huo in Tiantai. En route, they passed through Jinqu’s Golden Altar, where they were hosted by Mao Shushen for two days and nights before proceeding together to Mount Huo.\n\nLater, Pu rose to the position of Palace Attendant and was tasked with transmitting the teachings to Yang Jun, a Gentleman of the Palace in the household of the Prince of Langye, Minister of Works. In the third year of the Xingning reign, the yichou year, on the twenty-third day of the sixth month, the Perfected Sovereign descended with a host of perfected to the home of Yang Jun. From then on, she frequently descended to Jinqu, often accompanied by the Three Mao Lords of the Azure Lads and Pure Void. The transmission of the teachings beyond the single lineage of Huayang began here.\n\nDuring the Yuanyou reign of the Song dynasty, she was enfeoffed as the Perfected Sovereign of the Lofty and Numinous, Illuminator of the Purple Void and Primal Dao. In the Taiding reign of the Great Yuan, Yu Ji, Director of the National University, composed eulogies for the forty-five ancestral masters. Her eulogy reads:\n\nWe gaze upon the Purple Void,\nMajestic as the sacred peak of Zhurong.\nHer soaring rosy clouds form verses,\nHer flowing echoes shake the heavens.\nRadiant as the sun and moon,\nHer jade essence and golden visage.\nShe upholds the myriad heavens,\nInaugurating our lineage of transcendents.\n\nThe second lineage-holder of the Shangqing tradition, the Perfected Master of the Mysteries, the Perfected of the Shangqing, the Upper Protector of the Golden Portal, the Inspector of Transcendent Affairs and Life-Destinies, the Lord of the Eastern Florescence and Dao of the Cavernous Numinosity, the Perfected of Manifest Transformation and Supreme Virtue—surnamed Yang, named Xi, styled Xihe—was originally from Wu Commandery but later relocated to Jurong. He was born in the fifth year of the Xianhe reign, the gengyin year, in the ninth month. From childhood, he was spiritually attuned, possessed of a handsome appearance, eloquent and joyful, skilled in calligraphy and painting. His fame in these arts equaled that of Wang Xizhi throughout the land. Though his years differed greatly from those of Master Xu Mai (Changshi Mu), they early formed a bond of spiritual communion.\n\nWhen Emperor Jianwen held the title of Prince of Langye and later ascended to the position of Chancellor, he appointed Lord Yang as Attendant Clerk of the Chancellery upon the recommendation of the Chief Administrator. Yet upon the Emperor’s enthronement, Lord Yang sought no promotion. His uncle, Gao, renounced worldly honors, and Lord Yang devoted himself to profound meditation, thereby attaining spiritual resonance.\n\nIn the fifth year of the Yonghe reign, he received the *Tiger and Leopard Method* from the Master of the Central Yellow. The following year, at the age of twenty-one, he studied the *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* under Liu Pu, the eldest son of Lady Wei. In the third year of the Xingning reign, in the sixth month, the Primordial Lady of Purple Emptiness, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, and the Perfected Consort of Ninefold Splendor descended to his home to expound the essential Dao. Thereafter, forty-seven Perfected Ones of the Clear Void and Numinous Purity descended in succession, some manifesting at Mount Changshi in response to his devotion. The scriptures and revelations he transmitted were often conveyed through spirit-writing to Master Xu and his sons. Thus, he became the master who transmitted the scriptures to Master Xu.\n\nThe Perfected Consort of Ninefold Peace, responding to the mandate of the age, became his celestial consort. She once declared to him: “Your luminous nature is serene and unadorned, your inner radiance as resplendent as jade, your virtue as profound as an orchid’s abyss, your pure resonance echoing through the golden palace—truly, you are a treasure concealed within, a hidden Perfected One whose brilliance shines inwardly. You shall become one of the Three Excellencies, attending the Emperor at dawn, a lofty assistant to the Four Counsellors, bearing the mandate of the Sagely Lord. You shall govern life and judge death, reward and punish spirits, command the myriad numina, seal mountains and summon clouds, discern the qi of yin and yang, and serve as the Lord of Life-Destinies over Wu and Yue. You shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight, riding dragons and driving clouds. If you cannot endure the smoke of wind and fire, and wish to preserve your true form in the secluded groves, might you not seek the Way of the Sword and Liberation, or the safeguards of a declared end?”\n\nLater, the Lord of the Western City further instructed him in the method of absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. Emperor Jianwen became his disciple. In the eleventh year of the Taiyuan reign, the bingxu year, Lord Yang shed his mortal form at the age of fifty-seven.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nSerene and unadorned in nature,\nHis spirit companioned with the profound and mysterious.\n\nThe resonance of golden offices flows like melody,\nJade trees drift in mist and smoke.\nThe assembled perfected ones convene in counsel,\nThe Supreme Emperor bestows his summons.\nBy hand he transmitted the scriptures of the Dao,\nHis brush refined, his ink wondrous in skill.\n\nSuccessor as the Third Perfected Master of the Highest Clarity,\nHighest Clarity Immortal Marquis,\nLeft Minister of the Golden Watchtower,\nAttendant of the Dawn,\nLord of Life-Destinies,\nGreatly Virtuous and Perfectly Benevolent Perfected Lord of the Grand Prime—\nhis surname was Xu, his given name Mu, his courtesy name Siguan, and his other name Mi.\nA native of Pingyu in Runan,\nhis sixth-generation ancestor Guang had relocated to Danyang.\n\nBorn in the second year of the Yongxing reign of Emperor Huai of Jin, the yichou year,\nhe began his career as an erudite of the Imperial Academy,\nthen served as magistrate of Yuyao,\nlater summoned as Gentleman of the Masters of Writing,\npromoted to Regional Rectifier,\nProtector-General’s Chief Clerk,\nGentleman Cavalier Attendant,\nand Regular Cavalier Attendant.\n\nOutwardly, he blended with worldly affairs;\ninwardly, he cultivated the study of the true.\nOnce admiring his elder brother’s lofty path of distant wandering,\nhe encountered the passing of Emperor Jianwen,\ndevoting himself to stillness in his mountain retreat,\nwhere he forged a pact of numinous clarity with Lord Yang.\n\nDuring the Xingning era,\nthe host of perfected ones descended,\nand Yang diligently transmitted the scriptures and decrees.\nThe Perfected Lord of Fixed Will imparted especially abundant teachings.\nIn the first year of the Taiyuan reign, he shed his mortal form at the age of seventy-two.\nHis sons and nephews observed the rites of interment,\nentombing an empty coffin in the great tomb west of the county.\n\nThe *True Declarations* states:\nHis mandate was rooted in destiny,\nhis karmic conditions long established.\nIn a former life, he was the younger brother of Xue, the Duke of Changli,\nninth minister of King Wu of Zhou.\nInheriting the legacy of Xu Zhao’s meritorious deeds,\nhe was again destined to receive blessings as a later descendant.\nThus, borne by the turning of the times, he took rebirth,\nand by virtue of his endowments, attained the Dao.\n\nAs a Perfected One of the Highest Clarity, conferred by jade tablets,\nhe was enfeoffed as a marquis,\nhis rank inscribed among the ministers and directors,\ngoverning immortals and soothing the realm,\nassisting the sagely in shepherding the people.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHis wind and verdure answered the turning of the times,\nhis noble lineage inherited the blessings of destiny.\n\nThe subtle unfolding of culture refines the mysteries of the divine,\nwhile worldly honors brush the surface—what need for inner cultivation?\nIn the emptiness of the Jade Dawn, my heart wanders in true communion.\n\nFourth-generation lineage master of the Highest Clarity, Celestial Lord of the Golden Portals, Right Minister of Destiny, Attendant of the Eastern Radiance, Perfected of Primordial Unity and Vast Transformation—third son of the Immortal Marquis—his name was Liu, styled Daoxiang, with the childhood name Jade Axe. Pure and luminous, his brilliance surpassed all peers. Born in the seventh year of Chengkang of the Jin, the xin-chou year, in the first month.\n\nRecommended for the imperial accounts and summoned as Registrar to the Minister of Education’s office, he declined both. He built his dwelling before Mount Leiping and secretly cultivated the supreme Dao. In the third year of Xingning, in the seventh month, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity descended with teachings. From then on, he exchanged written correspondence with the host of Perfected, diligently practicing the rites of Returning to the Origin, Flying Steps, and the Two Radiant Canopies. He longed to journey early to the Grotto Chambers and had no wish to linger in the mortal world. In the fifth year of Taihe, the geng-wu year, he journeyed to the Northern Grotto to announce his end, aged thirty.\n\nElders passed down this account: while burning incense and prostrating upon the stone altar of the Northern Grotto, he bowed and did not rise. At dawn the next day, his form appeared as if still living. The Lord of Preserving Life remained silent, permitting him to relinquish his form in hidden transformation, following the nocturnal release of Zhang Zhennan. Zhennan was the third-generation lineage master of the Celestial Master, Lu. Thereafter, he dwelled in the grotto-palaces of the four directions, often coming and going from the Square Terrace of the Four Directions.\n\n*The Declarations of the Perfected* states: Sixteen years later, he shall ascend to the Eastern Florescence to receive the scriptures and be enfeoffed as the Celestial Lord of the Highest Clarity. His wife, daughter of Huang Yan, Prefect of Jiankang, was named Jingyi. She bore a son, Huang Min, whom he sent back to her family. Huang Min, styled Xuanwen, at seventeen entered official service, rising to the rank of Vice Minister of Agriculture. In the third year of Yuanxing, to escape the chaos in the capital region, he carried his father’s legacy of scriptures into the mountains of Ke.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nReceiving the scriptures from the Purple Tenuity,\nhe pursued the flight of the Two Modes.\n\nWhy linger as in a treasury, long abiding in vain?\nYielding form to the empty altar, merging with the Great Beginning.\nThe legacy of scriptures not forgotten, preserved by a worthy son.\n\n**Fifth-Generation Lineage Master:**\nThe Perfected Lord of Preserving the True of the Highest Clarity, surnamed Ma, personal name Lang, also called Wengong, styled Ziming, was a native of Dongguan in Kexian, eastern Zhe. His family had long been wealthy, walking in trust and practicing righteousness, revered by his village. Hearing of Yang and Xu of Mount Mao who had attained the Dao, and the widespread transmission of the Southern Perfected’s Highest Clarity scriptures and methods, he grew ever more devoted in admiration, for his dwelling lay near the Golden Court and Heavenly Terrace, a mere handspan from the immortal realms.\n\nIn the third year of Yuanxing, when Vice Minister Huang Min of Agriculture carried the scriptures to escape the chaos, Lord Ma personally welcomed him at the roadside, inviting him to stay in his home, where he honored and supported him with reverence. In the sixth year of Yuangjia, when Vice Minister Huang returned to Qiantang, he sealed a chest of his ancestral Perfected scriptures and left it in Lord Ma’s quiet chamber, saying, “These scriptures are all traces of the divine immortals. Only I may retrieve them. Even if there are written instructions, do not give them to anyone.” He took only a dozen or so scrolls with him. Upon reaching Qiantang, he fell ill and, fearing he might not recover, sent someone to fetch the scriptures. Lord Ma, having received the books, firmly upheld the original injunction, thinking, “How could I dare lightly hand them over, having personally received this teaching?” Thus, he did not return the scriptures, and Xu soon passed away.\n\nLord Ma and his younger brother Han revered the scriptural treasures even more than their own father. They always kept two servant boys—one named Whitehead, the other Flathead—to tend the incense and fire, sweep, and dust. Often, divine radiance and numinous qi manifested in their chambers. Lord Ma’s wife could also perceive them, saying, “There are often azure-clad maidens and jade women coming and going in the air, swift as flying birds.” Thereafter, the Ma family grew ever more prosperous, their wealth vast, and they enjoyed long lives across generations.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHeaven does not begrudge the Dao,\nEarth does not begrudge its treasures.\nYet those who transcribe carelessly\ncannot preserve them.\nHanded down by the Perfected of Wei,\njade pendants and golden tablets—\nfew know them,\nthose who see them flourish.\n\n**Sixth-Generation Lineage Master:**\nThe Perfected Lord of Assisting the True of the Highest Clarity, personal name Han, styled Ziyan, was the younger cousin of Lord Preserving the True. Together with his elder brother, he revered and upheld the scriptural treasures. A layman named Lou Huiming, who had earlier resided in Ke, was deeply enamored of the scriptures and methods, but his karmic obstacles were severe, and he had no means to study them. In the first year of Jinghe, he went to the capital and, at the urging of the Perfected of Pure Brilliance, sought an audience with the Song sovereign to request the scriptures from the Ma family. By the time the scriptures reached the capital and were presented to Jinghe in the Hua Forest, they were briefly opened, and he urged that they be entrusted to the Daoist of the Rear Hall—Master Lu.\n\n*The Record of Numinous Verifications* states: For their merit in preserving the scriptures, upon their passing, the Celestial Thearch commanded divine officials to summon them with jade tablets into the Grotto-Heaven of Golden Court, where both were appointed as Perfected Lords.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nOf old, the Lords of Mao—\nelder ascended, younger followed.\nContinuing this noble path,\ntogether they preserved the numinous garden.\nWhere the jade scriptures reside,\nten thousand spirits guard and uphold.\nThe Dao flourishes in its time—\nit is not for men to claim as private.\n\nThe Seven Generations of Patriarchs: The Grand Master of the Upper Clarity, Supervisor of Immortals, Celestial Custodian of Registers, and National Preceptor of Song—Master Lu, posthumously styled the Serene Master, the Perfected of Cinnabar Prime. His surname was Lu, personal name Xiujing, courtesy name Jianji, a native of Wu Xing who had relocated eastward. His father, Lin, declined nine imperial summonses and was posthumously styled the Reclusive Master of Lofty Dao.\n\nThe Perfected bore extraordinary marks: his eyebrows were thickly layered, his feet had double ankles, his palms bore large characters, and his back displayed the pattern of the Dipper. From youth, he was deeply devoted to texts and broadly studied astronomy and cosmology. In adulthood, he delighted in wandering beyond the mundane world, journeying south to Mount Heng, the Xiang River, and the Nine Doubts to seek the vestiges of the Southern Perfected. He traveled west to Mount Emei and Western Citadel, tracing the lofty footsteps of the Pure and Void.\n\nAt the close of the Yuanjia era of the Song, while purchasing medicine in the capital, Emperor Wen summoned him, but he did not go. Instead, he befriended Tao Yuanming and the monk Huiyuan on Mount Lu. In the third year of Taishi of Emperor Ming, the emperor ordered Wang Jingzong, the governor of Jiangzhou, to extend a ceremonial invitation to court. He was forcibly lodged in the Rear Hall, but the Perfected found no joy in it and was granted quarters outside. Later, he was compelled to attend an assembly at the Hall of Extended Worth in Hua Lin, where all the princes and nobles gathered.\n\nThe Perfected One, donning a deer-hide cap, approached the emperor and ascended the hall. The emperor rose in solemn reverence, whereupon he entrusted the Perfected with the *Shangqing* scriptures and methods received from Ji Zhen, appointing him the master of the Three Caverns and the preceptor of the age. He was then compelled to establish the Hall of Revered Emptiness on Mount Tianyin north of the capital and to erect an altar for transmitting the scriptures. Thus, the teachings reached their full perfection.\n\nThe following year, the emperor fell ill. The Perfected performed the *Golden Register* rites in his hall for a single night, whereupon a yellow qi, like a jeweled canopy, enveloped the altar and halls. The emperor, moved by a strange vision in his dreams, found his illness somewhat alleviated.\n\nHe composed over a hundred scrolls on the rituals and protocols of the fasts. In the fifth year of the Yuanhui era, on the first day of the first month, he suddenly prepared his belongings as if to return to his old mountain. His disciples were astonished, and on the second day of the third month, he serenely shed his mortal form.\n\nAt that time, the disciples on Mount Lu all witnessed a rainbow banner descending gently over his quiet chamber. From the void came these words: \"The Grand Overseer of the *Shangqing* Immortals descends.\" Soon after, his cap and shoes were sent back to the mountain by imperial decree, and his dwelling was named the Abbey of Simplicity and Tranquility.\n\nIn praise it is said:\nFar roaming the sacred peaks,\nbefriending souls on Mount Lu.\nGathering the essence of golden blossoms,\nbathing the pure white leaves.\nIn hand, wondrous texts;\nhis feet trod the wheel’s spokes.\nAmid the empty halls and silent groves,\nhis lofty footsteps linger still.\n\nThe Eight Generations’ Patriarch: The Perfected Lord of the Purple Tenuity, Master Xingshi Mingde, surnamed Sun with the personal name Youyue and courtesy name Ying[J]da, was a native of Shuyang. His nature was profound and pure, and he was broadly learned in the classics and their commentaries. He paid homage to the Abbey of Simplicity and Tranquility on Mount Xiandu, where he ingested the Elixir of Millet Essence. Dwelling on Mount Xiandu for forty-seven years, he had no contact with the world. Later, he came to Mount Mao, where the Abbot of Simplicity and Tranquility, upon seeing him, rejoiced and said: “I have long awaited your arrival; now I may rest easy on Mount Lu.” He transmitted to him the true methods of Yang and Xu.\n\nBefore long, the Abbot of Simplicity and Tranquility passed away, and an imperial decree appointed Master Sun to preside over the Abbey of Ascendant Generation, succeeding him as the patriarch. At that time, renowned scholars such as Shen [□], Lu Jingzhen, and Chen Baoshi all studied under him. His disciples numbered over a hundred.\n\nThe Master once dreamed that Lord Mao said: “The Lesser Lad of Azure Splendor will descend again upon Mount Juqu; among your disciples, one will be skilled in safeguarding him.” During the Yongming era, when Tao Hongjing entered the mountains, the Master, struck by his extraordinary bearing and transcendent spirit—and hearing that his body bore the pattern of the Dipper—recalled his dream and said: “The Lesser Lad of Azure Splendor—could this not be the Perfected One within the Dipper?” He then fully transmitted his teachings to him. Repeatedly submitting memorials, he begged to return to the mountains, but the imperial decree did not permit it. On the fifteenth day of the fifth month in the seventh year of Yongming, he bathed and relinquished his spirit, aged ninety-one.\n\nA Eulogy:\n\nThe essence of a hundred grains,\ncongeals as blossoms in the central court.\nOthers fill their bellies with substance;\nI find tranquility in emptiness.\nGolden perfection, jade radiance—\ndivine patterns manifest in the world.\nThe Azure Lad returns once more,\nand I find my entrusted charge.\nNinth-generation Master of the Lineage:\nGolden Portal’s Right Minister of Destiny,\nDirector of the Penglai Waters,\nState Preceptor of Liang,\nCavalier Attendant-in-Ordinary,\nLord Yiyin of Unyielding Purity,\nPerfected One Zong Yuanlan of the Teaching—\nby family name Tao, personal name Hongjing, style Tongming,\nseventh-generation descendant of Tao Jun, Prefect of Wu and Jing,\na native of Danyang Moling.\n\nBorn on the thirtieth day of the fourth month, the day *jiaxu*, in the third year of Xiaojian of the Song, the year *bingshen*.\nAt ten, he read of the Eight Lords of Huainan and became enamored of the teachings of nurturing life.\nUpon reaching capping age, he refused marriage, and as his family’s resources were not yet established, he briefly served in a minor post.\nHe entered officialdom under the Qi, serving as attendant reader to various princes.\nAt twenty-some years, he studied scriptures and methods under Master Sun of Xingshi Hall, receiving the handwritten texts of the former Perfected Yang Xu.\nThereupon, he requested leave to travel, visiting Lou Huiming at Mount Dahong, encountering Du Jingchan at Mount Taiping, seeking Zhong Yishan at Mount Yaoshan, and paying homage to Monk Zhu Biao at Tiantai.\nHe obtained over ten volumes of Perfected Ones’ handwritten works.\nReturning to the capital, he was appointed Gentleman Consultant with the title General of Vibrant Might.\n\nIn the eleventh year of Yongming, he submitted a memorial to resign his post at the age of thirty-seven and came to the mountains, styling himself the Recluse of Huayang.\nWest of the ridge, he established the Three Halls of Huayang: the upper hall with a storied pavilion where he himself resided, the middle for his disciples, and the lower for receiving guests.\nWhen Emperor Wu of Liang ascended the throne, his esteem grew even greater, and contemporaries called him the Prime Minister of the Mountains.\nIn the fourth year of Tianjian, he moved to the east of the ridge to tend to his furnace and crucible.\nIn the seventh year, deeming Linyan too shallow and proximate, he longed to wander afar.\nHe changed his name to Wang Zheng, assuming the title Outer Arms Officer, and departed the mountains at midnight, arriving at Mount Qingzhang in Nanjiang, Yongjia.\nHe dreamed the Buddha conferred a prophecy, naming him the Bodhisattva Shengli, and dwelled at Dayuruo Rock, where he compiled his *Declarations of the Perfected*.\nHe then sailed across the sea to Mount Huo, returning after a year to Muliu Islet.\nEmperor Wu urged him to return to his former mountain, whereupon he journeyed to Zheng County to pay homage at the stupa of King Ashoka, vowing to receive the Five Great Precepts.\nUpon his return, he took residence in the Eastern Gorge.\nThe following winter, he moved to Zhuyang Hall, then to the studio at Yugang.\nDuring his life in the mountains, he authored over two hundred volumes, and over three thousand disciples received his teachings in scriptures and methods.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the third month in the second year of Datong, he composed his *Farewell Verses* for Huang Fachan and others, and on that very day, his body dissolved in transcendence at the age of eighty-one.\nThe fragrance in his chamber lingered for days without dissipating.\nThe court dispatched a chamberlain and scribe to oversee the funeral rites, and on the fourteenth day, his empty coffin was interred at Mount Leiping.\nThe Master’s spirit and bearing were luminous and refined, his gaze bright with light.\nHis form was slender, his neck long, and his ears finely shaped—clearly distinct from the common crowd.\nHe once said his mind was ever like a bright mirror, encountering forms and objects without the slightest obstruction.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of Purple Yang said: “Lord Tao has long dwelled among the upper ranks of the lower immortals—he is of the same rank as Fan Youchong.”\nZhao Cheng said: “When Gao Guang, Director of the Penglai Waters, was reprimanded for his handling of waterworks, Tao was appointed in his stead. Yet the appointment was soon suspended, and another was to be selected.”\nThis occurred in the year *yiwei*, as recorded in *Zhou’s Records of Mystic Communication*. Twenty-one years later, the Master passed away—his immortal rank must have since ascended.\n\nA Eulogy:\nLofty beyond the white clouds,\nat dawn he feasts on crimson auroras.\n\nDisciples thronged like a forest, his writings filled the household.\nHe cleansed his spirit in the Ninefold Purity, soared in radiance through the Three Luminaries, companion to Heaven, resplendent as the sun.\nTenth-generation patriarch of the lineage:\nMaster of the Upper Clarity, Immortal Lord of Shaoshi, Tang Court Preceptor, Grand Master for Glorious Happiness with Gold and Purple, posthumously titled Master Shengxuan—his surname was Wang, personal name Yuanzhi, style Deguang, a native of Linyi in Langye.\nHis father, Tan, was appointed Prefect of Yangzhou under the Chen; his mother, née Ding, dreamed of a phoenix alighting upon her body.\nThe monk Baozhi told his father: “The child you bear shall become a divine immortal.”\nThe Patriarch was born in the second year of *Datong* under the Liang.\nIn his youth, he took as teacher Master Zongdao; Zang Jin further instructed him in the scriptures and methods of the Reclusive Cultivation tradition. The Chen sovereign summoned him to Chongyang Hall, bestowing special honors, and sent him back to Mount Mao, where he dwelled on the northwest ridge.\nUnder the Sui, Prince Guang of Jin, garrisoning Yangzhou, extended a formal invitation. Upon arrival, the Master’s hair and beard suddenly turned white; the prince, alarmed, sent him home.\nIn the seventh year of *Daye*, Emperor Yang visited Zhuo Commandery and summoned him to the Linduo Palace. Escorting the imperial carriage to Luoyang, he was pressed into service to perform purification rites at Mount Song; later, he was recalled to the capital, where the Jade Clarity Mystic Altar was built to house him.\nWhen the Tang founder was still in obscurity, the Master secretly revealed to him the talismanic mandate.\nDuring *Wude*, when the future Taizong was Prince of Qin, he subdued Wang Shichong. Together with Fang Xuanling, he came in humble guise to visit the Master, who greeted them, saying: “A sage is among you.”\nThe Prince of Qin then examined the matter closely. The Master said: “You shall become the Heavenly Sovereign of Great Peace—take care for yourself.”\nThereafter, he requested leave to return to the mountains.\nIn the ninth year of *Zhenguan*, he was pressed into service to build the Great Peace Abbey; lands were granted, and forty-nine Daoist priests were ordained as his attendants.\nOn the fourteenth day of the eighth month, he awoke from sleep with a joyful countenance and told his disciples: “I have just made a brief journey to the Grotto Palace. The immortal officials have informed me that this worn-out frame is to be appointed Immortal Lord—my rank and title are now fixed, and my departure is near.”\nOn the sixteenth, he bathed, entered his chamber, and burned incense. Turning to his attendants, he asked the hour.\nThey replied: “The hour of *chen*.”\nHe said: “Good.”\nStraightening his robes and cap, he lay down and passed away, aged one hundred and twenty-six.\nIn the second year of *Diaolu*, Gaozong posthumously granted him the title Grand Master of the Palace; his posthumous name was Master Shengzhen. Empress Wu, in *Sisheng*, added to his former titles. At the time, he was known as the Jade Dharma Lord.\n\nA Eulogy:\nGraceful as the soaring phoenix,\nhis virtue perceived without delay.\n\nAt times he withdrew, at times he appeared—his radiant destiny had its appointed season. His substance transformed, his spirit moved freely, unbound by the mysteries of dark and light.\n\nAt twenty-six, he became an Immortal Lord of the Tang. *Records of Mount Mao*, Scroll Ten, concludes here.\n\n---\n*Scroll Eleven of the Records of Mount Mao begins: A Record of the Succeeding Patriarchs, composed by Liu Dabin.*\n\n**Scroll Eleven: A Record of the Succeeding Patriarchs**\n\n**The Eleventh Patriarch:**\nThe Venerable Master of the Upper Records, Inspector of Immortals, Tang State Preceptor, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, posthumously titled Master Tixuan, bore the surname Pan, the personal name Shizheng, and the courtesy name Zizhen. He hailed from Zongcheng in Bei Prefecture.\n\nHis father, Pan Zhen, served as Prefect of Tong Prefecture during the Sui, while his mother, née Lu, was skilled in eloquent discourse on renowned principles. She fed him the *Dao De Jing* from her own mouth. After her death, he built a hut by her grave and was renowned for his filial piety.\n\nDuring the Daye era, a Daoist named Liu Aidao saw him and marveled, saying: *\"A steed of three aspirations—who but you could ride it?\"* At the time, the Dharma Master Wang was held in high esteem by Emperor Yang, often entering the palace to personally offer pine resin and spring water for blessings. Aidao said: *\"I deeply wish for you to follow me, yet to accomplish the work of the Dao, none but the Dharma Master will suffice.\"* Thus, he became a disciple of the Dharma Master and returned with him to Mount Mao.\n\nOne day, the Dharma Master said to him: *\"Songyang is the place for your cultivation of the True—you must hasten there without doubt.\"* The Master then entered the valley between the twin springs of Zhong Ridge, dwelling there for over a decade before venturing deeper into Xiaoyao Valley, where he became utterly secluded from the world.\n\nIn the third year of the Shangyuan era, Emperor Gaozong visited the eastern capital and paid homage at Mount Song. He summoned the Master and requested talismanic writings, but the Master declined, claiming no knowledge of them. The Emperor then asked what he needed in the mountains. The Master replied: *\"Lush pines and pure springs are all I require—these are not lacking here.\"* The Emperor was struck with admiration.\n\nAt the beginning of the Tiaolu era, when the Emperor again performed sacrifices at Mount Song, he visited Xiaoyao Valley. There, he saw a rattan couch overgrown with creeping figs, nearly rotted away, with no utensils for fire or grain—only two gourds holding green-tinged congee. Moved, he ordered the immediate construction of Chongtang Abbey on the spot.\n\nThe following spring, he had the Master conveyed by palanquin to the western palace in Luoyang and urgently renamed Songyang Abbey as Fengtian Palace. Whenever the Emperor composed music, he would present the names of the Master’s disciples for consultation, and from then on, the imperial carriage frequently traversed the mountain passes. While in Luoyang, the Emperor summoned the Master again for an audience. When the Master requested to return, the Emperor composed a poem to see him off.\n\nThe Master once told his disciples: *\"Truly, I have no use for meeting emperors, for it disturbs the sacred mountains. If you study the Dao without wearying of its profound mysteries, you will be free of encumbrances.\"*\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the sixth month in the first year of the Yongchun era, he asked for a bath. Writing a green talisman, he placed it in the water, saying: *\"This will remain cold for a lifetime.\"* At the time, a stone chamber was being built beneath the northern cliff, nearly complete.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, he suddenly declared: *\"I depart, I depart.\"*\n\nThe disciple Han Wenli asked where he was going, and he replied: *\"To Mount Tai to inspect merits and virtues.\"* With these words, clouds of qi enveloped the courtyard, and in an instant, he shed his mortal form at the age of ninety-eight.\n\nIn an imperial edict, the Empress Dowager proclaimed: *\"Last winter’s late season saw the carriage of the Xuanyuan Emperor unsummoned. This autumn’s early days find the abode of Guangcheng once more empty.\"*\n\nIn the second year of the Shengli era, a stele was erected on Mount Song.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nA talent beyond the world,\nAll yearned to befriend him.\nThe path of immortality is fixed—\nWho would dare abandon it for private ends?\nLush p\n\nA phoenix-like crow once descended upon his incense table, its talon marks forming the characters: *\"Perfected One of the Upper Records of the Eastern Flower.\"* Thereafter, his conduct grew ever more numinous. Emperor Xuanzong, struck by wonder, dispatched envoys to summon him, compelling him to reside in the Yang Terrace Abbey built upon Mount Wangwu. One day, moved by the Celestial Emperor’s call, he came to the mountain to pay homage at the Hua Yang Grotto-Heaven. There he composed the *Stele of Purity and Simplicity*, secretly inscribing upon it that Wangwu’s Lesser Existence Heaven was the central precinct of the Assembly of Perfected Ones: *\"Its vital qi is secluded and reverent, its spirits gather in splendor. If our Dao is to flourish, what could be impossible? Soaring and alighting at will, I resolve to make this my final abode.\"*\n\nLater, at the abbey’s northern ridge, where the heights reached their utmost and the boundaries grew most remote, he discovered the Central Rock Terrace—directly aligned with the Heavenly Altar above, encircled by long mounds below, embraced by colossal trees, with murmuring streams flowing through its midst. Here, for days uncounted, he nurtured dragons in the great valleys, kept cranes upon the central peaks, burned myriad incenses in the Golden Grotto, and inhaled the pure qi from the Stone Window. He composed the *Discourse on Sitting in Forgetfulness* and compiled the *Twelve Secret Essentials of Cultivating Perfection*, which became the companion text to the *Secrets of the Reclusive Perfected*. Yet fearing the emperor’s favor might endure too long, he relocated to Jade Cloud Peak on Mount Tiantai, there to await his ascension.\n\nThe court then compelled the construction of Tongwu Abbey, where the master inscribed the *Dao De Jing* in full with his five limbs. On the eighteenth day of the sixth month in the *yihai* year of the Kaiyuan era, he suddenly told his attendants: *\"I have received an appointment in the Mystic Capital and may no longer remain.\"* He then arranged his seals and fastenings as if preparing for a distant journey. By dusk, a crimson cloud swirled down to earth, bearing the clear strains of celestial pipes. All who witnessed this were awestruck, certain he would ascend. Rushing to his chamber, they found only his discarded form.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong’s imperial stele stands atop the Tongwu summit.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nUtterly numinous, merging with the Void,\nResponding to all things without bound.\nForcibly named *Sitting in Forgetfulness*—\nIt dissolves the dust of mortal form.\nLofty winds in the Flowery Grove,\nDawn’s light on the Cinnabar Terrace.\nNo teacher beyond Penglai’s seas—\nReturning, he sought Mount Tiantai.\n\n**Thirteenth Patriarch:**\nPerfected One of the Upper Records, Tang State Preceptor, Grand Master for Proper Consultation, Master of Mystic Serenity—his surname was Li, personal name Han’guang, a native of Jiangdu in Guangling. His original surname was Hong, changed to avoid the taboo of Empress Wu Zetian. His family had long followed the Confucian path. His father, Xiaowei, was styled Master of Purity and Reclusion and was deeply versed in the arts of the Yellow Emperor and Laozi.\n\nAt the beginning of the Shenlong era, the Master was ordained as a Daoist on account of his aspiration and conduct, residing at Longxing Abbey. In the seventeenth year of the Kaiyuan reign, he followed Master Sima to Mount Wangwu. At first sight, Sima declared, “A true guest of jade-like aspiration!” He dwelt in Songyang for over twenty years. When Sima Zhen traveled, Emperor Xuanzong summoned the Master to court for an audience. Sighing, the emperor said, “In seeing Han’guang, I know that Perfected One Sima yet remains in the world.” One day, the emperor inquired about the golden crucible. The Master replied, “The Dao and virtue are public; light ascent is but a private matter within the public. If one neglects the Dao and virtue to pursue life and indulge desires, it is like striking the wind.” Xuanzong was deeply moved and marveled at this. He issued an edict for the Master to reside at Yangtai Abbey. After more than a year, the Master claimed illness and begged to return to Mount Juqu to compile scriptures and methods. In the twelfth month of the fourth year of the Tianbao reign, the emperor dispatched an imperial envoy bearing a jade-sealed edict to summon him. Upon arrival, the Master was lodged within the palace precincts. Whenever the emperor wished to consult him, he would first purify himself through fasting and bathing. When the emperor requested transmission of the Daoist methods, the Master declined on account of illness, and the emperor did not press him further. He again sought to return to the mountains. Thereupon, the emperor specially bestowed the former residence of Yang and Xu—Ziyang Abbey—for his dwelling. The emperor composed a poem to see him off, and further prohibited hunting, fishing, and the gathering of plants within the mountain, while those who consumed meat or blood were barred from entry. At the time, many authentic scriptures and sacred traces had already scattered and been lost. The Master, in accordance with imperial decree, searched and collected them, presenting the recovered treasures to the throne. The emperor further ordered the mountain recluse Wang Ai to request the Master’s standard script for thirteen pages of the *Upper Scripture*, to supplement what was missing. On the eighteenth day of the third month in the seventh year, Xuanzong received the catalog of the Three Caverns’ scriptures in the Datong Hall, paying distant reverence to the Master as his preceptor. He bestowed upon him the title *Master of Mystic Serenity* and a set of ritual robes, fulfilling the rites of master and disciple. An edict was issued to carve a stele at Huayang Grotto Abbey to commemorate the event. The emperor twice summoned the Master to court, but each time he requested retirement and returned. When he performed rituals for the state, auspicious signs such as sweet dew and sacred fungi repeatedly appeared.\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the eleventh month in the fourth year of the Dali reign (769), the year *jiyou*, he shed his mortal form at the Ziyang Retreat, aged eighty-seven. He was posthumously enfeoffed as *Grand Master of the Left Mystic* and conferred the title *Grand Master for Proper Consultation*.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe distinction between public and private,\nThe words and names of the Supreme Dao—\nThough spoken, none heeded;\nRepeatedly, the sovereign’s grace was bestowed.\nThirteen pages of the *Upper Scripture*,\nExquisitely mending what was lost.\nInscribed in stele and record,\nHis merit stands peerless.\n\n**Fourteenth Patriarch of the Lineage:**\nThe *Master of the Upper Realm, Immortal Lord, and Perfected One of the Great Cavern in the Zhengyuan Era*, surnamed Wei, personal name Jingzhao, was a native of Yanling in Danyang and a sixteenth-generation descendant of Wu, the Minister of Works Shen. Though he mastered Confucian learning, he refused to pursue official rank, instead devoting himself to the study of immortals and transcendents. In his early years, he was ordained at the Xunzhen Abbey in Yanling, taking Master Bao Shirong as his teacher. Shirong’s master was Bao Fazheng of Chongxuan Abbey; Fazheng’s master was Bao Fangguang; Fangguang’s master was Wang Gui; and Gui’s master was Wang Fazhu, the *Master of Ascending Perfection*. He specialized in the scriptures and methods of the *Lingbao* tradition and later resided at the Suming Abbey in Chang’an. During the Tianbao era, he was ordered to attend Master Xuanjing and returned to Mount Mao. After the upheaval, he established the Ziyang Abbey and took up residence there. At the beginning of the Dali reign, he received the orthodox transmission of the *Xuanjing* scriptures and talismans. From the reigns of Suzong and Daizong onward, as the realm fell into chaos, he alone took the Dao as his duty. In the first year of the Zhenyuan era (785), on the day *guimao* of the eleventh month, he summoned his disciples and said: *\"Yesterday, I saw an immortal official bearing a summons, appointing me* Master of the Upper Realm*. I shall no longer remain in this world. Why rejoice at coming? Why grieve at going? You must embody this truth—do not mourn.\"*\n\nAt the age of ninety-two, he passed away.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe spirit rides the void and is born,\nThe utmost numinous is its treasure.\nAs worldly dust swirls in chaos,\nHe alone preserved stillness.\nWhen the time came to return to emptiness,\nI knew where his归宿 lay.\nNo joy in coming,\nNo sorrow in going.\n\n**The Fifteenth Patriarch:**\nMaster of Cavernous Truth, surnamed Huang, personal name Dongyuan, was a native of Mount Nanyue. In his early years, he traveled to Huayang, where he became a fellow student and friend of Master Xuanjing. He once received the method of ingesting the solar essence of the Central Yellow while wearing yellow robes. Later, he entered Wuling and resided at the Peach Blossom Abbey. There was a youth named Xiang Ting from Chenxi who came to serve him with great reverence. One day, after wandering alone, the youth returned and told the master: *\"Within the Peach Blossom Spring, there is a watery cavern where flowers and trees exude fragrance. The cavern chambers wind around the stream, and many five-colored stones lie within. I found one shaped like a tortoise—when I pulled its head, its tail moved in response.\"* The master stored it in his scripture case, but after ten days, it vanished. Another day, they agreed to go together, but the waters had risen, and the stream and cavern were lost, their whereabouts unknown.\n\nIn the summer of the eighth year of the Dali era (773), on the last day of the fifth month, the youth took leave of the master, saying: *\"We shall meet again at Juqu.\"* The following year, the master moved to Purple Cloud Peak on Mount Lu, where he dwelt for ten years. He then returned to the mountain and resided at the Lower Ji Palace, reciting the *Scripture of the Great Cavern* daily. He inherited the teachings of Patriarch Wei and spent another eight years there. One day, the youth Xiang Ting arrived, but the master had just gone out with his staff. Xiang Ting did not wait. When the master returned and heard his name, he was greatly startled. He changed his robes, lit incense, and prostrated toward the void. After standing motionless for a long while, he passed away—only his empty garments remained. Emperor Dezong marveled at this and posthumously bestowed a title upon the master. He lived to ninety-five.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nGazing at the sun, he attained the Dao,\nHis knowledge was most true.\nWith Xiang Ting’s arrival,\nThe Peach Blossom Spring began its spring.\nThe five-colored stone tortoise,\nHead moving, tail responding—\nSuddenly it vanished,\nA wondrous sign of the profound mystery.\n\n**The Sixteenth Patriarch:**\nMaster of Luminous Mystery, surnamed Sun, personal name Zhizhi, was of unknown origin. In infancy, he recoiled at the scent of meat and fish. When he grew older, he accepted only wine. He left his family and entered the mountains, becoming a disciple of Master of Cavernous Truth.\n\nIn the sixth year of the Dahe era, he served as the master of ceremonies for the mountain monastery. In the seventh year, he memorialized the throne to strictly prohibit the hunting and fishing of creatures in all four seasons and to abolish the use of sacrificial animals in rituals, presenting apocryphal scriptures and erecting stone steles. The Duke of Weiguo at Ziyang Abbey, Li Deyu, revered the master and once composed a poem in his honor.\n\nIn the first year of the Huichang era under Emperor Wuzong, he was summoned to conduct the *Shengshen* Fast, where he constructed a nine-tiered precious altar to perform the Daoist rites, and was consequently bestowed a title. At the time of his liberation, the assembly witnessed amidst wind and rain a great fish with golden scales and jade mane; the master mounted it and ascended beyond the Great Peak, though the exact date remains unknown.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nTo consume flavors is to nourish the form,\nTo consume qi is to nourish the spirit.\nThe cauldron and chopping block harm life,\nEnduring this injures benevolence.\nI esteem the Mother of Nourishment,\nNo need to borrow from without.\nGazing upon his demeanor, who felt it—\nCould they grasp its meeting?\n\n**The Seventeenth Patriarch:**\nNational Master of Tang, Master of Rare Subtlety, surnamed Hao, personal name Fatong, was a native of Danyang in Runzhou. Possessing literary talent, he sat for the imperial examinations but met with no success, and so came to the mountain. Master of Luminous Mystery ordained him as a Daoist and transmitted to him all the scriptures and methods.\n\nIn his youth, when Luminous Mystery transformed amidst wind and rain, the master attained profound enlightenment. In the second year of Qianfu during the reign of Emperor Xizong, he was dispatched as an emissary to receive the Great Cavern Register, and was honored from afar with the title of \"Initiating Master,\" bestowed with the honorific \"Master.\" In the fourth year of Tianyou, at the age of eighty-three, foreseeing the turmoil of the world, he concealed himself in a mountain cavern and vanished without a trace.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWhen the world teeters on peril,\nThe wise depart from it.\nYet that Perfected One,\nMoved to profound sorrow,\nDwelt deep in the cavern,\nHis influence flowing a thousand *li*.\nAll things, moving and still, flourished,\nAnd timely rains arrived.\n\n**The Eighteenth Patriarch:**\nMaster of Cavernous Subtlety and Primordial Stillness, surnamed Liu, personal name Dechang, was a native of Jinling. At seventeen, he composed the *Song of the Great Dao* and presented it to Patriarch Hao. Observing his bearing and essence—ethereal, transcending the mundane—the master remarked, \"A worthy one who drinks the springs of Maoshan will, in a month, be tenfold wiser than today; in a year, radiate luminous wisdom; and in a decade, hear the Dao of immortals.\" Thereupon, the disciple composed the *Chant of Tinkling Springs*. The master further said, \"I possess the esoteric essence of the Jade Canon. If you refine your blossoms into fruit, you may harmonize heaven and humanity, transcending emotion and reason.\" Thus, bowing twice, he took the disciple’s vow and received the Dao. He dwelt at Ziyang Abbey for twenty years, never stepping beyond its gates. One evening at Huaniang Mountain, a youth sang: *\"The sacred fungi grow long, the golden blade rings.\"* The mountain’s inhabitants, hearing it repeatedly, feared an army’s approach. That year, yellow *zhi* mushrooms flourished, yet withered within a month—just as the master attained true liberation.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nDragon-script and phoenix-writ,\nCan temper the kalpa’s fate.\nTo conceal them, value emptiness;\nTo preserve them, value stillness.\nThe whole body is the vessel—\nWho clings to its form?\nTo fathom its destination,\nEven disciples lose the Way.\n\n**The Nineteenth Patriarch:**\nMaster of Purity, surnamed Wang, personal name Qixia, also named Jingzhen, styled Xuanyin, was born in Qi and raised in Lu. At seven, he passed the child prodigy examination, his immortal talent and numinous *qi* discerned as innate. In the *dingmao* year of Tianyou, fleeing chaos, he crossed south to Shouchun, where he received the Dao and its methods from Master Wen Zheng of Asking Governance.\n\nUpon arriving at Huayang, he further received the *Dadong Jingjue* from Master Deng Qi of Dignified Conduct. When the Founding Emperor of Southern Tang was still a guest at court, the emperor came to assume his post, summoning the master to Jinling and lodging him at Xuanzhen Abbey. During the sacred reign of restoration, imperial favor and ritual esteem were exceptionally profound, and he was bestowed a golden seal with purple sash, styled Grand Master of Mystic Erudition. He submitted a memorial requesting return to the mountains, but the edict did not permit it. He was further honored as Master of Purity, posthumously granted the title Master of Recondite Stillness in the Grotto-Mysteries.\n\nIn the first year of Baoda, the *renzi* year, on the *jiayin* day of the fourth lunar month, he concealed his transformation at Xuanzhen. Having lived sixty-two springs and autumns, he was presented with two hundred thousand coins for funeral expenses, and his cap and sword were returned for burial at Leiping Mountain. Xu Xuan composed the stele inscription, with this eulogy:\n\nBefore the rising sun,\nThe stars gleam bright.\nIn the southern capital,\nThey lean on our immortal ruins.\nGolden seal and purple sash—\nWhat are these to me?\nThose who deem them noble\nCome and accept them in due course.\n\n**The Twentieth Patriarch:**\nMaster of Purple Yang and Lofty Emptiness, surnamed Cheng, personal name Yanzhao, styled Huaiyu, was a native of Jintan in Runzhou. His *qi* was pure and unsullied, unstained by worldly dust. He first journeyed to Purple Yang Abbey, where he prostrated himself before Master Wang and became his disciple.\n\n「In the eighth year of Song’s *Kāibǎo* era (975 CE), after the pacification of the Southern Jiangnan, **Yang Kelan**, a *Lingzhong* of the Ministry of Punishments and magistrate of Shengzhou, invited the Master to serve as the **Weyi** of Maoshan and the Daoist preceptor of Shengzhou. Not long after, he declined and returned to his former abode at Purple Yang.\n\nHis disciples were numerous. In the first year of the *Chunhua* era (990 CE), on the fourteenth day of the fourth month, he passed away peacefully. He was seventy-nine years old.\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n   The vastness of the realm,\n   Only the King and the Dao.\n   I, with my empty spirit,\n   He, with his honored station.\n   The teachings of Huayang,\n   Their scriptures are vast indeed.\n   To aid the age’s work,\n   He harmonized the *yin* and *yang*.\n\n**The Twenty-First Patriarch:**\n□ **Dongxu Master**, surnamed Jiang, given name Yuangji, styled Jipu, with the sobriquet **Bixu Zi**, was from Yixing in Changzhou. His grandfather was **Lin**, and his father, **Qizhi**, sold medicine without ever marking up its price, being a refined scholar revered in his village.\n\nThe Master’s bearing was lofty and untouched by the mundane; he scorned worldly affairs and labor, excelling particularly in poetry. Often, he would summon cranes in broad daylight, drifting with an air of celestial ascent. He followed **Chongxu Master** in response to imperial summons, residing in the capital for some time before returning to Purple Yang together. There, they engaged in profound discussions on the lofty studies of the Dao, and the Master said: *\"The Three Caverns’ jade scriptures—none but you can entrust them to me for transmission.\"*\n\nThe Master replied: *\"I transmit the scriptures, not the secrets. I have no expectations from you, Master.\"*\n\n**Chongxu** said: *\"I transmit the person, not the scriptures. My hope rests solely with you.\"*\n\nAfter receiving transmission, people remarked: *\"The Jiang clan’s virtuous lineage is now rewarded!\"*\nHe upheld and propagated the great teachings, and wondrous omens appeared time and again.\n\nIn the third year of the *Xianping* era (1000 CE), on the fifteenth day of the third month, he passed the Daoist canon to his disciple **Wan Baochong**, and then ascended to the Dao.\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n   Morning soars through the jade groves,\n   Evening rests beside the moonlit pool.\n\nThe faint sighs of the **Dao** stir, and the resonant breath of **Zhuangxu** rises like frost and mist.\nA sage from the **Xuanpu** grove, his plumage pure and bright.\nI soar to the **Taizhi** heights, and lend you my flight and grace.\n\nThe twenty-second generation Patriarch:\n**Chongxu Master**, surname **Wan**, given name **Baochong**, courtesy name **Yongxuan**, of Changzhou Wujin.\nAs a child, he served as an apprentice to his elder brother, who nurtured and guided him.\nWhen he grew older, he reflected upon his **business teacher** and said:\n*\"Had I not my elder brother, I would not have this day.\nThe division of my **craft’s lineage** was not what I wished to inherit—\nTo dwell near the **yellow crown** is enough for me.\"*\n\nThus, he went to **Tengxian Guan** and took the **out-family** path,\nLater paying respects at **Dongxu Cave** beneath the **Dongxu** master.\n\nIn the first year of the *Xianping* era (998 CE),\nHe began transmitting the **Upper Dao**, excelling in the methods of gathering and refining the **celestial radiance**.\n\nBy the age of ninety-two, his **spiritual transformation** complete,\nHis visage remained youthful as a child’s.\n\nDuring the *Jingde* era (1004–1007 CE),\nHe received imperial summons and was granted the **seal of office**,\nRetiring thereafter to **Heihu Valley** in seclusion.\n\nThe eulogy reads:\n   **Hesyang** radiates its brilliance,\n   **Chishui** leaps with sacred light.\n   Drawn by the **Divine Tripod**,\n   Immersed in the **Numinous Elixir**.\n   A thousand days of Dao’s fulfillment,\n   The **Dragon’s Gate** surges with boundless freedom.\n   Lingering as a **jade boy**,\n   In **white robes and black sashes**.\n\nThe twenty-third patriarch: **Master Guànmiào of Sòng**, surnamed Zhū, given name **Zìyīng**, courtesy name **Yǐnzhī**, a native of **Jùqū’s Zhūyáng Village**. Born in the first year of **Tàipíng Xīngguó** (976 CE).\n\nAt eight or nine, he followed a shepherd boy, **Guō Qiāncūn**, who could summon cranes by playing the flute. His parents deemed this ominous and abandoned him.\n\nHe then joined **Zhū Yuánjí**, donning Daoist robes at age twelve—at the start of the **Duānróng** era (984 CE). Later, he studied under **Míngzhēn Zhāng**, the Alchemical Master, atop **Jījīn Mountain**, testing the method of abstaining from grain. People began to gather around him, and he sought distant travels.\n\nArriving in **Xiàngyáng**, he met the eccentric **Chén Tiějiǎo**, who took him to **Qīngchéng Mountain**. He then passed through **Jīxiàng**, where he examined ancient scriptures in the **Gǔcáng** of **Wěidà Zhìguān**. There, he encountered the **Water Star Boy**, **Wǔ Bàoyī**, who wandered through **Hézhōng Prefecture**, his movements divine and inexplicable.\n\nIn the first year of **Jìngdé** (1004 CE), he succeeded the **Second Teaching** at age twenty-nine. In the fourth year, Emperor **Zhēnzōng** sent envoys to pray for an heir, and the next year, **Rénzōng** was born—details recorded in the *Sòng Shǐ*.\n\nBy imperial decree, he presided over **Yùzhì Zhāoyìng Gōng**. Within the mountains, he constructed **Jièyàn** and **Qián Yuán Tiānshèng** halls, receiving the title **Guóshī**. The **Empress Dowager Míngsù** transmitted the **Great Cavern’s Complete Method**, and he was further honored as **Guànmiào Zhēnsheng**.\n\nReturning to the mountains, he received a letter from **Wǔ Bàoyī** sent from **Shǔ**, reproaching him for revealing his name and fame, exposing celestial secrets. The Master wept, tears streaming, leaving his disciples bewildered.\n\nOn the eleventh month of the seventh year of **Tiānshèng** (1029 CE), he ascended in seated meditation, holding the **auspicious jade *rúyì*** bestowed by the **Confucius Temple**, his body drenched in sweat, a pearl-like bead forming on his brow. His **corporeal dissolution** was a supreme attainment—his lifespan, fifty-three years.\n\nEulogy:\n   **Red child’s pristine innocence**,\n   **Innate wisdom, darkly realized.**\n\nThe **Master of the Void and Clarity** was born when the **Dao** resounded above the clouds and left no trace upon the waters.\nAt his **auspicious dawn**, warmth spread like the heart of spring.\nHe wielded the jade and struck the golden bell—\na **temporal sage** for the age.\n\nThe **Twenty-fourth Patriarch of the **Way of Transcendence and Illumination**: **Master Máo Fèngróu**, of the **Máo** clan, born **Fèngróu**,\na man from **Jiànkāng’s Jùróng** district.\nOnce, while attending his father at the **Celestial Market Altar** in **Máo Shān**,\nhe encountered a **black tiger**—his father saw nothing,\nbut the Master gazed intently, and the tiger bowed before him.\n\n**Master Guànmiào Zhēnsheng** heard of this and marveled,\ntelling his father: *\"The **Dao** of **Huáyáng** rests in your son.\"*\n\nThus, he remained in the mountains,\nstudying under **Master Guànmiào Zhēnsheng**.\nModest and upright, with the bearing of a sage,\nhe built his hermitage at **Jīyín Shān**,\nadmiring the **hidden, pure, and tranquil** lands of **Dàozhēng**,\nand devoted himself to **effortless ascension**.\n\nIn the twelfth month of **Jiāyòu**’s eighth year (1063 CE),\namid a great snowfall, the **wood jasmine** bloomed suddenly before his abode—\nthe Master found this strange.\nAfter a short while,\na **Daoist** named **Liú Hùnkāng** arrived from **Tāihé Guān** in **Chángzhōu**,\nhis sincerity moving the Master,\nand the auspicious sign confirming his **virtue/power**—\nthus, he imparted the **scriptures and methods** in that moment.\n\nNot long after, he attained **corporeal dissolution**.\nIn **Chóngníng**’s first year (1102 CE),\nhe was posthumously honored with a title.\n\nThe **eulogy** proclaims:\nAt the shadowed peak of **Jīyín Shān**, its spirit’s might is profound.\nThe **Portals of the Numinous** respond with sacred signs—\nopening the **Daoist gate** to the immortal way.\nTwo doors swing wide, and the **Celestial Image** takes form.\n**Cinnabar light** glows in the forest—\nmortals recognize the **Cauldron’s** lingering essence.\n\n---\n**The Twenty-Fifth Generation Master:**\n**Bo-Zhen Guan-Miao Chong-He Master**, **Grand Secretary of the Middle Court**,\n**Suffused with Stillness, One**—\nSurname **Liú**, given name **Hùnkāng**, also called **Zhìtōng**,\nof **Jìnlíng** lineage. Born on the **twelfth day of the twelfth month, Yǐhài**, in **Jǐngyòu’s second year** (1055 CE).\n\nAt **thirteen**, he studied under **Tāng Hánxiàng** at **Tāihé Guān**.\nIn **Jiāyòu’s fifth year** (1060 CE), he passed the **scriptural examination** and became a **Daoist**.\nOne night, a **divine figure** appeared in his dream and said:\n*\"If you seek the **Way of the Immortals**, choose a sacred mountain.\"*\n\nOften lamenting the lack of a true teacher,\nhe would, in quiet nights, ascend the **altar**,\nloose his hair, burn incense,\nand take the **Heavenly Dao** as his master.\n\nLater, hearing of **Huàyáng Máo Zōngshī’s** virtue,\nhe went to serve under him.\n\nResiding in **Jīyín Shān’s** hermitage,\nhe often saw **five-colored clouds** forming palaces—\nmortals marveled at this.\nOne day, **three羽士** arrived at his dwelling,\npointing to the **eastern corner of his hut** and saying:\n*\"Dwell here, embrace the **Spirit**, and guard the **Center**—\nyour **virtue/power** will bless others,\nand you shall have no cause to shame your predecessors.\"*\n\nThey then gazed at his brow and asked:\n*\"This is a place of **non-doing**—\nthe **Dao** holds it sacred.\nNo blemish may remain.\"*\nWith their hands, they touched the mark—\nand by morning, the scar vanished.\n\nIn **Yuán’yòu’s first year** (1086 CE),\nEmpress **Mèng** of the **Philosopher’s Son** (Zhèzōng) accidentally swallowed a needle,\nand physicians could not remove it.\nThe officials, hearing of his **high virtue/power**, summoned him.\nThe Master administered a **talisman**—\nshe vomited up the needle, and the **inscription** appeared on the paper.\n\nThe court marveled at this, bestowing the title\n**\"Dòngyuán Tōngmiào Fashi\" (Master of Penetrating Originality and Mysterious Perfection)**\nand appointing him **Head of the Zhǐcáng Chúxiáng Palace**.\n\nIn **Shàoshèng’s fourth year** (1097 CE),\nthe **Jiāngníng Prefecture** was renamed **Yuánsú Guān**,\nwith his **Qiánshén Ān** as its center.\nHe also established **Sān Máo Shān** in **Jùróng Xiàn**,\n**Jīngpēng Zōngtán** in **Xìnzhōu’s Lónghǔ Shān**,\nand **Hézào Shān** in **Línjiāng Jūn**—\n**three peaks standing firm**, aiding the **imperial transformation**.\n\nThe **Huizōng Emperor** further honored him with:\nthe title **\"Yuánsú Wànníng Gōng\" (Palace of Originality and Universal Peace)**,\nthe **jade seal \"Jiǔlǎo Xiāndū Jūn\"** (Lord of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Realm),\nthe **jewel-encrusted \"Jǐngzhèn Yángjù Dāo\"** (Sword of Resounding Thunder),\nand imperial **poetry, calligraphy, and paintings**.\n\nThough he repeatedly submitted petitions on calamities,\nthe emperor, though moved, did not act upon them.\nHe was summoned to the capital repeatedly.\n\nIn **Dàguān’s second year** (1108 CE),\nwhen called to court, he managed the **Lùzhē Dao** (Deer-Barrier Road).\nThe Master explained its meaning—\na deer struck the carriage and died at the road’s side.\nBefore this, his **tamed crane**, hearing the summons, flew away.\nHe said:\n*\"The crane departs, the deer dies—\nI have no return.\"*\n\nIn the **fourth month**, he arrived in the capital,\nwhere the **Zhǐcáng Chúxiáng Palace** had newly built the **Yuánsú** branch temple.\nThat night, he dreamed of the **Celestial Sovereign’s** summons.\n\nAt dawn, the emperor visited the **Zhǐcáng Chúxiáng Palace** to see him,\nand the Master presented the **ten volumes of the *Dàdòng Jīng*** he had recited.\nOn the **seventh day**, at noon,\nhe **ascended in transformation**, aged **seventy-two**.\n\nThe court dispatched officials to escort his remains back to the mountain,\nwhere he was buried at **Diéyù Fēng**.\nBy imperial decree, the **Cángzhēn Guān** was built as his shrine.\n\n---\nThe **eulogy** proclaims:\n**Jade blossoms** drift on the void,\n**golden flowers** scatter fragrant qi.\nThe **host of immortals** opens the **Celestial Gate**—\nreceiving the **Purple Sovereign’s** sacred contract.\n\nIn the **divine realm’s domain**, the **Way** is perfected.\n**Inheriting truth**, **transmitting the Dao**—\n**Heaven and Earth grow old together**.\n\n---\n**The Twenty-Sixth Generation Master:**\n**Níngshén Diànshì Chéngjìng Chong-Hé Master**,\n**Suffused with Concealment**—\nSurname **Zhú**, given name **Mózhī**, also called **Zhìyuǎn**,\nof **Jīnlíng** lineage.\nHis father, **Déyī**, loved the **Dao** and guarded its teachings,\nand the villagers called him **\"Dáfáng\"** (the **Vessel of the Way**).\n\nThere was a **Du Daoist** from **Yúháng**,\nwho concealed his name,\nand once studied under him.\n\nThe **Sixth Year of Xīníng**, the Master was about to be born, when his father dreamed that the **Du Daoist** from **Yúháng** came to their home, and he took note of this wonder.\n\nAs a child, the Master often played with the Daoist’s young attendant, and whenever they did, he would draw patterns on the ground depicting **Daoist figures**. His father then took him to the mountain, where **Sīliú Mr.** saw him and marveled, saying: *\"This child will one day become a **Human-Heaven Master**.\"* The Master leapt with joy, vowing never to return home again, and his father rejoiced as well. He followed the Daoist.\n\nDuring the **Yuán-Yòu** period, the Master and his teacher together entered the imperial court, where **Mr.** was granted an edict to oversee the **Upper Residence of Auspicious Retention** (*Shàngzhǐ Chúxiáng Gōng*), and the Master was sent back to his home, to manage the affairs of the **Upper Residence of Original Symbols** (*Yuánfú Gōng*).\n\nIn the **Fourth Year of Chóngníng**, the Master was bestowed with the title of **Law Master**, and he was also entrusted with the **Chóngxì Guān**. For all matters of imperial favor—whether the construction of earthen and wooden structures or petitions for the **mountain gate’s** affairs—he diligently attended to them. He composed and gathered **ritual texts and procedures**, rescued the needy and impoverished, and especially devoted himself to such deeds.\n\nOn the **Third Day of the Seventh Month in the Third Year of Zhènghé**, he summoned his disciples and said: *\"I am now forty-six years old. In the past, **Mr.** had instructed me that my lifespan would not exceed this age, and yet by the grace of the court, I have been granted such longevity. Thus, I have reached my limit.\"* He then took up his brush to write a farewell memorial, bathed and changed into fresh robes, and passed away peacefully.\n\nWhen the memorial was heard, the **Son of Heaven** sighed and mourned, bestowing the title of **Suffused Concealment** (*Chónghé*) **Mr.** upon him, and conferring rank upon his parents. The Master was buried in the **mountain of the Concealed Truth** (*Cángzhēn Guān*).\n\nHis disciples included **Yú Xīyǐn** and **Xú Xīhé**. **Xú Xīhé**, upon receiving the imperial decree, succeeded him in holding the **seal and sword**. **Yú Xīyǐn** entered **Qīngchéng Mountain**, and today in **Shǔ** there are those who speak of the **Cavern Method** (*Dòngfǎ*) ascending the **Way**, for it is the **public transformation** (*xínghuà*) of **Yú Mr.**\n\nThe Master had a fine beard and a tall, sturdy frame, with a robust and uncommonly graceful build. Whenever he entered to pay his respects, the **Sovereign** would bestow special favors upon him.\n\n「Praise thus:\n\nThe autumn sky clears, dust gone;\nThe spring pool’s ice, vast and deep.\nAh, noble the Daoist bearing,\nBrightly praised by all.\n\nYet praise alone his bearing,\nWithout delving into his Way.\nThe final words he spoke—\nThe essence of imperial rule.\n\n#1 *Yáo lǐ* Mr. as the **Degree Master** (*Dùshī*): Original reads *\"Yáo lǐ Dùshī\"*, amended according to the *Dì* edition.\n#2 *Kǔ*: *Dì* edition reads *\"Dù\"*.\n#3 *Xī*: Original reads *\"Kù\"*, amended according to the *Dì* edition.\n#4 *Shí*: *Dì* edition reads *\"Yuè\"*.\n\n**Scripture Title**: *Máo Shān Zhì* (Records of Mount Mao).\nCompiled by **Sū Dàbīn** (Liu Dabing) of the **Yuan Dynasty**.\nThirty-three volumes.\nSource of the base text: *Zhèngtǒng Dàozāng* (Orthodox Daoist Canon), **Jìngzhēn** (Verdant Truth) section, **Records of Masters and Biographies** (*Jìchuán* class).\nCollation reference: *Máo Shān Zhì*, edited by **Zhìwàng Chán Guāng** (simplified as *Wàng* edition).\n\n**Volume XII**: *Shàngzhì* (Ascending the Way) **Sū** (Successor) **Zōngshī** (Master of the Tradition) **Sū Dàbīn** (Liu Dabing) composed.」\n\n**Volume XII: *Shàngzhì* (Ascending the Way) – Successor Master of the Tradition**\n\n**The Twenty-Seventh Generation Master of the Tradition:**\n**Revered Master of Mysterious Perfection and Concentrated Essence, the Honorable *Xiū Xīhé* (Surname Xu, given name Xīhé), courtesy name Zhònghé**, a native of Lìshuǐ, Jīnlíng (modern-day Nanjing). He held the title *Tàizhōng Dàfū* (Grand Minister of the Central Palace) and served as an attendant in the *Níngshén Diàn* (Hall of Concentrated Essence), nurturing the Celestial and refining the Marvelous.\n\nHis grandfather, *Lèshī Yǔ*, was a whip-bearer to a nobleman whom Master Xu held in profound reverence. Once, he accompanied his grandfather to court, where the emperor admired his Daoist talent and virtue. The emperor then granted him the title of *Dàoshì* (Daoist Immortal) and, upon his request, bestowed the *Zōngtán* (Altar of the Tradition) succession. In the fourth year of *Zhènghé* (1114), he was summoned to the capital but returned to the mountains in autumn, receiving the honorific *Dāntái Láng* (Officer of the Celestial Terrace) and promotion to *Tàisù Dàfū* (Grand Minister of Supreme Purity), overseeing the *Níngshén Diàn* registers.\n\nIn the third year of *Xuānhé* (1121), he was again summoned to the inner palace, where a separate residence was established for him. In the fourth year (1122), he was reinstated in his former rank and requested permission to return to his mountain retreat, where officials escorted him with ceremonial honors. On the eighteenth day of the third month of the fifth year (1123), the emperor bestowed a sacred seal upon him as he ascended the mountain, accompanied by the omen of a white crane and celestial lanterns.\n\nOften, while seated in profound stillness, he would receive descending immortals. Attendants who spied upon him heard only his voice. The Master, foreseeing the world’s fate, often seemed burdened with hidden sorrow. At the onset of *Jìngkāng* (1126), he sealed himself in seclusion, refusing food. One day, he gathered his disciples and declared:\n*\"My term among the immortals is near—I shall not witness the Sage’s governance of the world.\"*\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month of the first year of *Jiàn’án* (1127), he departed in the state of *zuòwàng* (sitting-forgetfulness), ascending beyond.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nAncient sages and true immortals,\nRefine essence, return to origin.\nComing and going without bounds,\nGathering and dispersing without form.\nMy spirit is most true—\nThus I met with them.\nWho stands at the outer gate?\nDesires to hear their words.\n\nThe Twenty-Eighth Patriarch: Master Yuanguān, surnamed Jiang with the given name Jǐngchè, styled Tōnglǎo, of Jùróng in Jīnníng.\n\nHis brow and eyes were strikingly refined, his face marked with a celestial pattern. At eleven, he served Master Chōngyǐn Gōng. When he heard that Master Yú of the Three Caverns had entered Shu, he journeyed to see him at Éméi Mountain. Master Yú admired his devotion and deepened his teachings.\n\nAt parting, he told the Master: *\"At the thirty-fifth generation, I shall return to the peaks of Fùjí Mountain and succeed as the grand master of the Dao.\"*\n\nWhen the *Jiàn’án* rebellions arose, the *Yuánfú* Palace was destroyed, yet the Master alone preserved the sacred scrolls, the ritual seal, and the sword. Left Street Grand Coordinator Fú Xīliè reported this to the court, and Emperor Gāozōng granted gold to rebuild the temple. The Master then traveled north to the capital.\n\nThe night before his arrival, Prince Wáng Yáng Chúnzhōng and his wife, Lady Zhào, dreamed of the Celestial Worthy descending to their home. The next day, the Master visited the prince’s gate, who held him in great reverence and faith. The present temple’s mountain gate was built by the prince.\n\nThe Master often sighed: *\"Because of my involvement in mundane construction, I have diminished my Daoist merit and cannot ascend in broad daylight.\"*\n\nHe possessed a secret white jade statue of the Celestial Worthy, which vanished at the moment of his dissolution. This occurred on the twenty-ninth day of the fourth month of the sixteenth year of *Shàoxīng* (1146).\n\n**Eulogy:**\n\nThe grandeur of earthen and wooden structures rises and falls with the times.\nMy practice is effortless, yet his dreams foretold a divine omen.\n\nLofty as the Celestial Sovereign, pure as the essence of heaven—\nAt dissolution, all returned together: who could hold

youth, he studied under Master Yuánguān,\nmastering the scriptures with thorough precision.\nAfter the Southern Migration, ritual platforms and ceremonial norms had decayed—\nHis refinements restored them.\n\nOne day, wandering **Léipíng Shān**, he found an ancient sword,\nwhich he presented to Master Yuánguān.\nYuánguān replied: *\"This is from the tomb of Taoist Lord Dàotóng.\nDivine artifacts must not be revealed—return it to its original place.\"*\nHe indeed found the hidden tomb and placed the sword upright upon it.\n\nA moment later, thunder and lightning struck with fierce winds, obscuring the sky.\nThe next day, he went to inspect—\nthe sword had vanished, and instead, two emerald-green **Lǐ** fruits appeared on the tomb.\nYuánguān heard of this and said: *\"The sword departs, the fruits emerge—\nI ought to step aside from the platform.\"*\n\nHe immediately honored the Master, who ascended the altar.\nThat day, tigers roared, deer howled,\nand cranes and phoenix-like birds gathered in harmony.\nThe Master delighted in dispensing medicine—\nwhenever a person’s illness was eased,\nhe would cast a single coin into the **Yàojiàn Píng**.\nThe coins accumulated, filling the well,\nand people named it the **Medicine-Money Well**.\nThe number of lives he saved can be inferred.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the ninth month of the **Shàoxīng** era

said:\n*\"In days past, I found two **Lǐ** fruits beneath Master Táo’s tomb—\nnow you have come to verify them.\"*\n\nThus, he built the **Two Lǐ Fruits Pavilion** by Bái Lǐ Stream.\nThe Master possessed a pure and tranquil nature,\ncherishing **virtue** and frugality.\nOnce he entered **Great Stillness (Dàjìng)**,\nhe remained secluded for a month without emerging.\n\nThe **Emperor Gāozōng** repeatedly summoned him,\nbut he declined due to illness and never appeared.\nThe Emperor then bestowed upon him the title **Jìngzhēn Master** from his mountain retreat.\n\nIn the summer of the **Lóngxīng** era (1163), a drought struck,\nand the **Lǐshǒu** (regional governor) visited the Master to pray for rain—\nwhich fell abundantly, as the Master had foretold.\nThe **Lǐshǒu** heard of this and rejoiced.\n\nImperial envoys came twice more,\nbut the Master, feigning illness with utmost sincerity,\nstill refused to leave.\n\nThe following year, upon receiving a petition from **Qín**

capital,\nserving as **Left Street Daoist Instructor** of **Tàiyī Palace**.\nThat very day, he returned to the mountain,\nand **transmitted the teachings** to his successor.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nThe **Daoist adept’s** learning surpasses mortal skill—\nnot something sought through books.\n\n「What harm in my coarse and humble attire?\nWhy cast me aside?\nMy slight movement stirred by a whisper—\nI felt it with empty **virtue/power**.\nThey say I foresaw it—\nWho could probe the mysteries of the **Dao**?\n\nThe **Patriarch of the Thirty-Third Generation**:\n**True Response Master**, surname **Xíng**, given name **Rǔ Jiā**, courtesy name **Zǐ Jiā**,\na native of **Lìshuǐ**, **Jiànkāng** (present-day Nanjing).\nAt seven years old, he could compose verses,\nand excel in discussing **names and principles**,\nhis stature seven *chǐ* tall,\nhis hands reaching past his knees.\n\nThe **Emperor Xiàozōng** summoned him as **Imperial Daoist Instructor**,\nbut the Master was already bald in his youth,\nunable to bear a cap,\nso he was specially granted a **headcloth** to wrap his head\nand ascend the hall,\nwhile the Emperor composed a poem:\n*\"I myself command the weaving of the Huáyáng headcloth,\nto bestow upon the **Daoist adept** of Máo Mountain.\nWearing this, he need not fear the **imperial court’s** lofty steps,\nno longer must the Five Peaks endure dust and grime.\"*\n\nIn the tenth month of the **Qìngyuán era** (1195),\nhe received a letter from the **Daoist Patriarch Qín**:\n*\"I have recently attained the **True Mandates**,\nand soon shall return to the **Celestial Chariot**—\nthe matter of **religious transmission** is most urgent,\nyou may swiftly request **True Response Master**,\nreturn to receive the **seal and sword**,\nand meet me on the ninth day.\"*\n\nUpon reaching the mountain and delivering the message,\nthe Emperor was deeply astonished.\n**True Response Master** was sent back to the mountain,\nand became the **Patriarch’s successor**.\n\nIn the **Jiādìng era** (1208–1224),\nwhen the **hidden chamber** was rebuilt,\nhe received **gold and silk** worth tens of thousands.\nHe told his disciples:\n*\"I do not covet this.\nNext year, there will be a great famine.\"*\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the third month of the **Jiādìng era** (1210),\nhe passed away without illness.\nThat year, the autumn harvest was poor,\nand the people relied on his provisions to survive.\nThose he aided beyond their need—\nthe number of lives saved was incalculable.\nSuch was his **compassionate heart**.」\n\nAt the **Huángfù Líng** [1], he personally upheld filial principles.\nThus he cherished the **Way of Quietude**, seeking counsel from the **True Masters**.\nWith his own hands, he fashioned the **flowered silk headband** [2],\nto bestow upon **Nà** the **dust-covering crown** [3].\n\nIn his generation, he alone fulfilled this noble calling,\nhis lofty virtue standing like jade—tall and unyielding.\n\nThe **Thirty-Fourth Generation Patriarch**:\n**Master Chōng Xuán Míngyī** [4], surname **Sà** [5], given name **Rǔjī** [6], courtesy name **Défū** [7],\na native of **Jìnlíng, Chángzhōu** [8].\n\nBy nature, he was frugal and unassuming,\nstudying the *Zhōuyì* [9] and *Lǎozhāng* [10],\nhis **Dao/Way** resonating deeply with **True Response Master** [11].\nFor over twenty years, the **True Response Master**—as a **High Sage**—held the **Altar of the Supreme** [12],\nyet their exchanges remained unrecorded.\nLater, they became **Teacher and Friend** [13],\ntransmitting the **Dao lineage** [14].\n\nIn the **Jiādìng era**, year **six (1213)**, on the **Làrì** [15] of **gēyǒu** [16],\nEmpress Yáng of **Níngzōng** [17] followed the precedent of **Empress Míngsù** [18]\nand ordered **Left Street Jianyi** [19] **Guān Déqīn** [20]\nto offer incense and gifts to **Great Cavern** [21] **Graduate Bìfǎ** [22],\nto perform the **Remote Ritual** for **Master Chōng** as **Dao Teacher**,\nand to conduct the **Luótiān Jiào** [23].\n\n**Sweet Dew** descended, **Spirit Kei** grew,\nwhite cranes soared amid **auspicious clouds**—\nthese were but a few of the **joyous omens** [24].\n**High Sage** Liú Xiānjué composed the *\"Chronicle of Transmission\"*.\n\nIn year **seven (1214)**, on the **eighteenth day of the twelfth month**,\nhe attained **True Perfection** [25].\n\nInitially, his name was **Kèzhāo** [26], courtesy name **Míngfū** [27].\nUpon transmitting the **Huáyáng teachings** [28],\nhe reverted to his former name,\nto mark the origin of his **worldly virtue** [29].\n\n**Praise:**\n\n*\"Unveiling the scriptures, illuminating the Dao,*\n*entrusting the *Yì* [30] to clarify the mysteries.\n*Rising with the sun, setting with the moon,*\n*his Way stands upright, never tipping.\n*Sweet Dew descends in secret, Spirit Kei flourishes on its own—*\n*white cranes take flight, ascending beyond the **High Peak** [31].*\"\n\n**Thirty-Fifth Patriarch of the Lineage: Master Tónglíng Zhìdào,**\nsurname **Rén**, given name **Yuánfù**, courtesy name **Shānfǔ**,\na native of **Lìshuǐ**.\n\nFrom youth, he bore an extraordinary nature,\ndiscerning profound principles with penetrating insight,\nhis divine bearing transcending the mundane,\nhis bearing exuding an aura of the immortal.\n\n**Master Xué**, the Patriarch, dreamed of a boy\nraising his seat and declaring:\n*\"Master Yú is coming—you must yield your place.\"*\nYú was none other than **Yuán Guān**, the **Jiāng Lord of Éméi Mountain**,\nwho had spoken of the thirty-fifth Patriarch as **Rùfù**.\nThis was a prophecy from **Shǔ**, where the immortal had departed decades prior,\nand **Xué** had once heard such words.\n\nWhen the Master entered the mountains,\n**Xué** remarked:\n*\"A guest of Huáyáng has returned.\"*\n\nHe was then granted the **Jade Scriptures**,\nand disciples flocked to him in succession.\n\nIn the **sixteenth year of Jiādìng (1223)**,\nduring relentless rains, **Emperor Níngzōng** summoned him to the palace,\nwhere he performed the **Great Ritual of Exorcism**.\n\nThe Master directed the floodwaters to the **Kūn corner**,\nfacing the **Gèn door** with measured steps,\nas if warding off malevolent forces.\nThe Emperor had also foreseen in a dream\nthat this place harbored hidden malevolence,\nunknown to others.\nThus, he was bestowed the title **Tónglíng**.\n\nThe following year, when summoned again to **stop the rains**,\nhe was further honored with the title **Zhìdào**,\ngranted the **xiàngjiǎn crown and cloak**,\nand **Empress Xiànzōng** presented him with a **ceremonial fan**,\nwhile the Emperor personally inscribed:\n*\"Special Imperial Grant to the **Miaoxiàng Zhēnrén**.\"*\n\nAll other gifts he distributed to the indigent,\nearning the Emperor’s even greater reverence.\n\n---\n\n**Cāxiān Three Year, Third Month, Eighteenth Day**, after the fast was completed, he addressed the assembly: *\"I shall now assist the Lord of Fate, fulfilling the duties of loyalty and filial piety—this is a matter to be held in highest regard.\"* Then, with a serene expression, he departed, having lived to sixty-four.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nWho says the Daoist Sage\nabandons the world and flees?\nHe receives his charge from Heaven—\nloyalty and filial piety are his duty.\nEarth’s Way knows no fixed form,\nyet he bears its brilliance as his virtue.\nThus he uplifts the Imperial Way—\ntherefore, I bestow this honor upon you.\n\n**Thirty-sixth Generation Patriarch: Mingwēi Master**, surname Bào, given name Zhìzhēn, courtesy name Chúnfū, of Lìshuǐ.\nHis family practiced Confucian learning but lived in poverty. His father found abandoned gold and, upon questioning, returned it to a weeping official. That night, he dreamed of a feathered immortal who told him: *\"You possess hidden virtue—your son shall become a Daoist Sage.\"* When a plague struck, his parents took him into the mountains to seek the Way; that year, only the Bào household was spared.\n\nWhen Zhào Kuài pacified the rebellious regions, he invited the Master to perform exorcisms and raise the spirits of those who had perished in battle. Feathered youths and cranes appeared in the clouds. Kuài revered him deeply and, through the Móuyì family, obtained the *Nányuè Jǐngzhèn Sword* from Mount Heng.\n\nIn **Chúnyòu Three Year**, he submitted a petition to resign his post and resided in the **Péizhēn Hall**, reciting the *Tàiqiú Yǐnshū* daily.\n\nIn **Chúnyòu Eleven Year, on the Seventeenth Day of the Fourth Month**, the day **Jìngyī Master** departed in transcendence, he burned incense and performed rites, then called the assembly: *\"I shall now follow my ancestral teachers.\"* That evening, he shed his mortal form.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nOne in a thousand preserves pure virtue,\nOne in ten billion reaches its utmost.\nPure to the extreme—he ascends as an immortal,\nHumanity transformed—his passage complete.\nHis father did not take what was lost—\nthe Dao promised his son transcendence.\n\n**Thirty-seventh Generation Patriarch: Língbǎo Master**, surname Tāng, given name Zhìdào, of Dānyáng, Zhenjiang.\nA prodigy in scholarship, his bearing was unconventional—he sat atop **Dàmáoshān** for thirty years, vowing never to descend. When Zhào Shànhuái, governor of Jīnlíng, sought out mountain masters, he was struck by Zhìdào’s singularity. He was then introduced to **Mingwēi Patriarch**, where he first grasped the essentials of the Dao.\n\nIn **Chúnyòu Three Year**, he received the seal and sword.\nIn the **Fifth Year of the era**, a great drought struck, and he was summoned to the capital to **stop the rains**.\n\nThe Master said: *\"The rain need not be conjured.\"*\n\nThe Emperor said: *\"The drought is severe—what shall we do?\"*\nThe Master replied: *\"Your Majesty, I have heard that the people are the Emperor’s children. If Your Majesty cares for them thus, the rain will soon return. Though my conduct does not equal Heaven’s expectations, my heart knows Heaven’s will.\"*\n\nThat very night, the rain fell. The Emperor rejoiced greatly, and the people raised their hands in praise, calling him *\"Tang the Daoist who summoned the rain.\"* He was summoned to reside in **Tàiyī Palace**, but he firmly declined, insisting on returning to the mountains. The Emperor granted him a generous parting gift.\n\nIn the **Eleventh Year**, he submitted a petition to resign.\n\nIn **Bǎoyòu Six Year**, on the **third day of the first month**, he said to his disciples: *\"Laughing into the boundless void—one*—thus I depart from the world with a single laugh.\"*\n\nThe disciples praised him:\n\n*\"The cap, sash, and robes—\nthese are the adornments of the outer self.\nI measure my life by wandering,\nreturning to my true nature is no strange thing.\nThe worries of the **Sānglín** life\nare cast aside with sweet simplicity.\nYet I do not deify myself—\nthe rain that nourishes is Heaven’s gift.\"*\n\n**Thirty-eighth Generation Patriarch: Chōngmiào Master**, surname Jiāng, given name Zōngyīng, style **Dàyù**, of **Pílíng**.\nFrom his youth, he studied the **scholarly arts**, and as he grew, he wandered the four quarters. He dwelled in **Yuè**’s **Jīntíngshān** for two years.\nOnce, he questioned a stone wall and obtained the book *The Secret of Ascending the True*—he found it most singular, so he brought it to **Huáyáng** and studied under **Tang Master**.\n\n「One night, he dreamed of the Celestial Gate opening,\nand saw a Daoist immortal from the Jade Sea with a five-character name.\nThe next day, he ascended the platform to transmit the Dao,\nand thus took that name as his title.\n\nWhen the imperial court performed the rites of worship in the suburbs,\na long rain fell, and they summoned him to the palace to pray for its cessation—\nwhereupon the skies cleared grandly.\n\nUnder Emperor **Lízōng**’s decree, he was granted imperial calligraphy:\n*\"The Hall of Auspicious Virtue and Benevolent Aid\"* (Shèngdé Rényòu),\n*\"The Hall of Everlasting Prosperity\"* (Jǐngfú Wànyán),\nand *\"The Hall of Eternal Blessing\"* (Zhēnghé Wànnián)—\nthree halls in total—along with ten thousand strings of cash,\nto repair and beautify the palatial halls.\n\nUpon returning to the mountains, he repeatedly petitioned to decline official duties,\nbut his requests were not granted.\n\nIn the year of **Kāixìng**’s reign change,\nhe feigned illness and wandered to **Lúshān**,\nbut upon encountering the **Èzú** Rebellion,\nhe crossed **Tiānmùshān** and traveled between **Yǒngjiā**’s mountains and waters,\ncommenting on and annotating *The Jade Canon of Great Cavern* in sixteen volumes.\nThe emperor, hearing of his lofty virtue beyond recall,\nand that his duty to the land could not be neglected,\ntherefore appointed him as the **Jìngyuán** High Daoist of the Realm.\n\nIn the **18th year of Zhìyuán** under the **Great Yuan**,\nthe **World Ancestor Emperor** descended a special edict,\nand he accepted the appointment, unable to decline.\nWhen he arrived at **Yāndū**,\non the **27th day of the 6th month**, he ascended without illness,\nand his disciples returned his cap and sandals to be buried at **Zàngzhēnshān**.\n\nIn praise, they said:\n\n*\"From the stone chamber, the ancient Daoists’ book was obtained,\nits hidden words fully explained, to govern the elixir fields.\nThe Celestial Gate opens wide—\nthe True Ones gather in full.\nNo dream, but the truth itself—\nthe ten thousand lands renew their brilliance.\n\n**Thirty-ninth Generation Patriarch: Jiàyán Master**,\nsurname **Jǐng**, given name **Yuánfàn**, style **Zhòngmó**,\nof **Jùqū**.\nIn his youth, he served under **Rèn Master**,\nas his attendant.\n\nHis beard and brow were broad and refined,\nlike the ancient Daoist worthies,\nand throughout his life, he knew no taste for wine or meat.»\n\nIn the **Jiāxī** era, he followed **Rèn Master** to the capital, residing at **Tiānxìng Guàn** in **Jiànkāng**. When the **Kāiqìng** reign began, he was summoned as a **High Sage of Lóngxiáng Palace**, serving successively in the **Left and Right Street Offices of Jiànyì**. Soon after, he was appointed **Master of Supreme Aspiration**.\n\nEmpress **Xiè** of the **Lízōng** era, following the precedents of earlier courts, honored him with the rites due a master, receiving the **Great Cavern’s Complete Transmission**. His written response was brief:\n\n*\"As the Mother of the World, I hold the **Kūn-shaman’s** symbol of submission,\nAs the Central Teacher of the Dao, I accept the **True Ones’** record.\"*\n\nAt the time, the Master took **Yuányáng Guàn** as his **Wàijìng Residence**. On the **25th day of the 12th month of the 12th year of the Jǐndìng era (1270)**, he ascended without illness.\n\nIn praise, they said:\n\n*\"Great is **Jiàyán**—\nhe swore to leave the dust of the world,\neating earth to preserve his form,\nascending to transcend stagnation.\nTo dwell high is not perilous,\nto guard purity is not rigid.\nWith steps in the Celestial Capital,\nhe bridged the **Yùhǎi** [Daoist scriptures].\nThe **40th Generation Patriarch, Yuánjìng Master**,\nsurname **Liú**, given name **Zōnghé**, of **Lìshuǐ**.\nHe served **Master Jiǎng of Yùhǎi**, whose disciples numbered tens of generations.\nThe Master alone was the youngest,\nhumble and obedient, tending his heart to the Dao’s domain.\n\nDuring the **Bǎoyòu** era, he followed **Master Jiǎng** to the court,\nthen wandered **Lúshān**, lodging at **Zǐjí Guàn**.\nOne night, he heard a voice call for the **Máoshān Daoists**:\n*The Heavenly King records in the Cavern—‘Sìzǐ of the Liú clan may return.’*\nThe Master wondered at this.\n\nThe next day, he parted from **Master Jiǎng** and went to **Jīnlíng**.\nHis father died, and after completing mourning, he returned to **Jùqū**.\nOne evening, mushrooms sprouted across the mountain,\nluminous and joyous. When asked, he never spoke of it.\nThe following year, the northern armies breached **Sìchuān**,\nand though the court repeatedly summoned him, he declined,\nhiding his Dao deeply until his natural end.\n\nIn praise, they said:\n\n*The world’s fortunes decline—\nthe **Yùhǎi**’s two sages rise like dust.\nThe Immortal knows the omens,\ntemporarily lost, now returns.\nThe mountain spirit calls at night,\nthe mushroom’s glow shines by day.\nI preserve the **Jade Scriptures**,\nto answer the people’s fate.*\n\nThe **41st Generation Patriarch, Yīkōng Zhēnmiào Master**,\nsurname **Wáng**, given name **Zhìxīn**, of **Jīntán**.\nHe abandoned home to study the Dao,\nserving **Master Yuánfú** (Táng **Yuánzài**).\nOnly those who inherited the **Supreme Aspiration’s** platform\nwere ranked by **jiǎ-yǐ** succession—\na system beginning with **Jìngyī Master**.\n\nAt that time, the **Kāiqìng** eunuch **Dǒng Sòngchén** secretly conspired with the **Pútú** Daoist **Zhū Zhīcháng**, seizing seals and swords at **Chìsōng Guàn**.\nThe Master went to the capital and reported his crimes to the throne.\n\nThe **Way** flows as before,\nthe **Kāiqìng** eunuch seizes the seals and swords and returns to the mountain—\nthe assembly acclaims and invites him to ascend the platform,\na gesture of dismissal with a wave of the hand.\nWinter and summer are but a single breath.\n\nOften, after sitting in meditation, he would rise,\nhis sleeves forever brushing the flames of **Daoist fire**.\n\nOn the second day of the ninth month, **Caixiān** era, **Jǐngyī Master** departed,\nand the great assembly pursued him in reverence,\nrestoring him as the **orthodox Patriarch**,\nto rectify the **jiǎ-yǐ** succession’s oversight.\n\nThey praised him:\n*\"Where the **Dao** is passed down,\neven Heaven does not defy it.\nWho dares to scoff,\nasking what man can do?\nIf it can be asked of,\nthen it is not the true **Dao**.\nI instruct the true **adepts**,\nto guard their **spirit** and preserve their **virtue**.\"*\n\nThe **42nd Generation Patriarch, Guānyī Zhēnmiào Master**,\nsurname **Zhái**, given name **Zhìyǐng**, courtesy name **Tóngshū**,\nof **Dānyáng**.\nAt age thirteen,\nhe entered the **West Gate of Huáyáng Cave**,\nwhere he encountered a **Daoist** sitting atop a stone,\npointing to a stone wall and inscribing a name, saying to him:\n*\"Your name stands among the honored teachers.\"*\nHe looked back at the stone wall,\nbut the man had vanished.\n\nWhen he grew older,\nhe indeed succeeded the **Daoist Master’s** lineage.\nHis bearing was gentle and his virtue frugal,\nyet he followed the **Dao** alone.\nFrom **Yǒngjiā**, he welcomed **Yùhǎi** to escort the **Master** back to the mountain.\n\nIn the year **Yǐhài** of the **Northern Expedition**,\nthe following year, **Bǐngzǐ**, he ascended to **transcendence**.\nThe time was the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month,\n**Yuán** era, the thirteenth year.\n\nThey praised him:\n\n**Hua yang’s cave** boasts walls of dark jade.\nA thousand years it opens once,\nrevealing names of immortals in line.\n\nThe immortals’ **Dao** is such—\ntransformation, not advancement.\nHumans bear fire’s legacy,\nwhile I return to the **True Extremity**.\n\nThe **43rd-generation Master of the Dao**:\n**Master Zhenghe Xuanjing Zhenying**,\nsurname Xu, given name Daoji,\nstyle name Zuyu, of Jùróng.\nHe was a descendant of **Master Shangzhi Xianhou**,\nborn in the **Song Ending Peace** era,\nthird year, **Bingshen** month, twenty-seventh day.\n\nAs a child, he served **Master Jiang Du**.\nHis teacher’s conduct was upright and resolute,\nnever lightly giving his word.\n\nAt the dawn of the **reign**,\nafter the wars had ceased,\na year of drought, famine, and plague struck,\nworse in the Huai region than anywhere else.\nAt that time, the **Metropolitan Inspector’s office** was in **Weiyang**,\nand officials gathered in the **Hall of Avoidance**,\nbegging the **Master** to come to **Tao**—\nand when he did, the rains came,\nthe sickness abated.\nThus, they were granted **post stations and provisions**,\nand escorted to the **court**.\n\nThe **Emperor Shizu**,\nsuffering from an arm ailment,\nsummoned him to the **Fragrant Hall of Dadu**,\ncommanding him to apply his **method**—\nand he was cured.\nAgain, he was ordered to pray for snow and still the winds,\nboth requests met with **wondrous efficacy**.\nThe emperor bestowed a **jewel-encrusted crown** and **Daoist robes**,\nand issued a **decree** to **greatly protect his teaching**.\nWith **insignia in hand**, he returned south,\nand all **Sanmao Mountains** came under his governance.\n\nIn the **year twenty-eight of the Yuan era**,\non the third day of the second month,\nhe **subtly showed signs of

him:\n---\nThe **lineage of Shangzhi**’s **Master**,\nthe world receives as **worthy**.\n\nThe **era of Jingyun** began anew,\nand the **Daoist lineage** was restored.\n\nWith **breaths of harmony and precision**,\nhe safeguarded the **sacred body** of the **Emperor**.\n\nGuided by **celestial omens and constellations**,\nhe was led by **thunderous winds**.\n\nThe **forty-fourth generation Master**:\n**Master Yangsu Tongzhen of the Bright Teaching** (真人),\nsurname **Wang**, given name **Daomeng**,\ncourtesy name **Muzhai**,\na native of **Jurong**.\n\nHis **appearance was dignified and

received **imperial favor**,\njust as **Master Xu** had before.\n\nIn the **year of the Great Virtue Stewed-Hai** (大德戊戌岁),\nwhen famine struck, he **twice went to Weiyang**,\n**dispelling locusts and praying for rain**,\nwith **miraculous results**.\n\nHe was **specially granted the title True Person** (真人),\nand his **practices and merits** were recorded in the **inscription of the Huayang Daoist Academy**,\ncomposed by **Jinshi Yuan Mingshan**.\n\nIn the **year of the Great Beginning Xinhai** (至大辛亥),\nhe **requested retirement** and **transferred the lineage**,\nso the **Emperor commanded his inner-chamber disciple Liu Dabing**\nto **inherit his teaching**,\nat the age of **seventy-three**.\nHe **ascended in Huayang**,\nborn in fact in the **year of the Song-era Baoliao Renyin** (宝佑壬寅).\n\nThey praised him:\n**\"Master Yangsu** was **simple in cultivation**,\n**sincere in attaining the Dao.\"**\n\nThe inner teachings harmonized with the Mysterious Unity,\nwhile externally aiding the Peaceful Age.\nLocusts and pests lay dormant in hiding,\nand the harvests flourished in abundance.\n\nIn his youth, his subtle virtues were already renowned in the world.\nAt forty-five, he succeeded as the **Dongguan Master of Micro-Mysteries and Responsive Truth** (洞观微妙玄应真人), surnamed Liu, given name Dabing, with the sobriquet **Wang Xuzi**, a native of **Hao Commandery’s Qiantang**.\n\nIn the **year of the Royal Grace Renaming, the Fourth Year of Yanyou** (皇庆改元赐号延佑四年), he received the **jade seal of the Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis**, and the officials reported this to the throne. The **Emperor Ren宗** issued a special decree, returning it to the **Sacred Altar**, to perpetuate the Daoist lineage.\n\nThey praised him:\n*\"Mountains and peaks rise in majesty,\nLakes and seas stretch in boundless depth.\nThe Mysterious Omen is complete,\nRooting the lineage in Huayang.\nInheriting the radiance of the Purple Palace,\nExpanding the teachings of the Vermilion Chamber.\nThe Nine Elders of the Metropolis,\nBestow upon you this sacred seal.\"*\n\n**Teachings of the Upper Clarity Successor Master Liu Dabing**—\n*Volume Twelve of the Teachings of Mount Mao* (now completed)\n*Volume Thirteen of the Upper Clarity Lineage*—\n*Recorded by the Successor Master Liu Dabing.*\n\nThe **Record of the Celestial Registrar’s Bureau**—\nThe **Three Palaces and Five Offices of the Metropolis of Upper Clarity (Huayang Dongtian)** are: the **Palace of Easy Relocation (Yiqian Gong)**, the **Palace of Embracing Truth (HanZhen Gong)**, and the **Palace of Serene Leisure (Xiaoxian Gong**; the **Office of the Grand Primordial (Taiyuan Fu)**, the **Office of Recorded Decrees (Dinglu Fu)**, the **Office of Preserved Life (Baoming Fu)**, the **Office of Pure Beginnings (Tongchu Fu)**, and the **Office of Ethereal Emptiness (Lingxu Fu)**.\n\nAmong these, the **Offices of the Grand Primordial, Recorded Decrees, and Preserved Life** are governed by the **Three Elders of the Teachings (San Mao Jun)**. The **Palaces of Easy Relocation and Embracing Truth** are inhabited by **female disciples who have attained the Dao**. The remaining palaces and offices are staffed by **male Daoists**. The **Office of Preserved Life** sometimes employs a **female palace**.\n\nThe **Celestial Elder of the Azure Boy Who Binds the Seas (Shu Hai Qing Tong Jun)** visits the realm twice yearly, inspecting these palaces and observatories. Among the Daoist officials, the **Three Elders of the Teachings (San Mao Jun)** and **Elder of the Four Pure Ones (Gu Si Chao Jun)**, a native of **Yan State**, stand foremost. Four brothers, dwelling in **Fuyong** during the **Qin Dynasty**, all attained the Dao. **Si Chao** was the eldest. His **Daoist virtue** was such that he governed the **Three Elders of the Teachings** for **six hundred years**, never failing in his duties or being **transferred beyond rank**#1.\n\nWhen his term concluded, he was **replaced in the Nine Palaces by the Left Celestial Lord of the Immortal Metropolis (Zi Xian Gong)**, who led the **Jade Platform Bureau**. It was said that the **Lingzhong (郎中)** had long been vacant, and later **Si Chao** was replaced by the **Junior Elder of the Teachings (Mao Xiao Jun)**.\n\nThe **Offices of Recorded Decrees** have **Left and Right Celestial Registrars (Zi You Li Zhong Jian)**, whose ranks correspond to those of **Worldly Longshis (Shichang Shi)** and **Celestial Masters (Sima)**. There is also the **Water Officer of the Northern River (Bei He Si Ming)**, who oversees aquatic affairs. These two offices **traditionally hold the rank of the Nine Palaces’ Celestial Guardians (Jin Bao Hou)**, and their duties are to **supervise those who should be nurtured as kindred souls**. Below the **Celestial Palaces**, these three ranks are the most exalted.\n\nThe **Left Celestial Registrar (Zi Li Zhong Jian)** corresponds to the **Longshi of the Grand Office (Da Fu Chang Shi)**. Formerly, **Han Chong** held this post, whose given name was **Buzhi Changwei**, a native of **Piling in Gaoyou**. In his youth, he took delight in the Dao. The **Forest Dwelling Immortal (Linwu Xianren)** **Wang Zhang** once **bestowed upon him the method of the Flowing Pearl Elixir (Liu Zhu Dan)**, which he reverently practiced, with great efficacy. **Zhang** spoke to him: *\"If you follow this Dao, you may also attain secular office, without hindrance to your **Daoist election**#3.\"* Chong thus **accumulated merit and rose to the rank of Prefect of Ruanling**, later **transferred to the Governor of Runan**, with a salary of **two thousand bushels**. For **fourteen years**#4 in his office, his **administrative virtue** was profound and renowned, making him the **best under heaven**. At age **seventy-four**, **Zhang** then **bestowed upon him the method of the Hidden Resolution (Yin Jie Fa)**, enabling him to depart and enter **Mount Huo**. He further received **Zhang’s method of the Elusive Transformation (Dun Hua) Mud Pill (Ni Wan) and Purple House (Zi Hu) technique**, thus **crossing the mortal world and dwelling in the Metropolis**. (*His biography appears in the **Han Records***.)\n\nThe **Right Celestial Registrar (You Li Zhong Jian)** holds duties equivalent to those of a **Celestial Master (Sima)**.\n\n「There was Liu Lan, whose courtesy name was **Zixiang** (later recorded in the *Han Records* as **Zixiang**#1). Lan was originally from **Yingchuan**, but in his youth he took delight in **Dao/Way and virtue**, often providing assistance without expecting gratitude, and saving the destitute—he was not a solitary figure in this. He was recommended for the **Upper Calculations** (Shang Ji) office and appointed as **Lan Zhong**, later transferred to **Governor of Chenliu**.\n\nWhen he met **Master Ma Huang**, the latter told Lan: *\"Your benevolence moves Heaven and Earth, and your hidden virtue is revered by gods and spirits. The **Most High** will surely commend your sincere devotion.* He has sent me to bestow upon you the **method of Longevity**. Lan knelt and struck his head in supplication, earnestly requesting to serve as an attendant. He then entered the **Tongwu Mountains** and was taught the **Eight Hidden Arts of the Earth** and the **Method of the Five Stars’ Splendor**, thus attaining the **degree of Eastern Hua**. He was then granted an office within the **Metropolis** (Dongzhong).#\n\nThe **North River Celestial Registrar (Bei He Sì Mìng)** had no incumbent, and in the past, **Yao Jun** was temporarily entrusted with the position. Jun was from **Qiantang**, having studied at the **Imperial Academy** (Taixue) and mastered the **Classics of Wei**. When calamities and omens occurred, he held the office of **Governor of Jiao**, but at the end of the **Han Dynasty**, he abandoned worldly affairs and entered **Zengcheng Mountain** to study the **Dao/Way**. He encountered **Shu Guo Youping**, a man from the **Qin era** who had long concealed himself in **Zengcheng Mountain**, a **Daoist adept** who taught Jun the **Nine Refining Qi Methods** and the **technique of aligning the stars within the heart**. After perfecting these methods, Jun came to the **Metropolis** and took charge of the **North River Celestial Registrar’s duties**, overseeing the **appraisal and punishment of water officials**. Though this position is officially registered in the **Fixed Records** (Ding Lu), in reality, it falls under the **command of the Bureau of the Purple Master (Zi Hua Guan)** in the **Celestial Metropolis** (Dongzhong). Yao Jun’s courtesy name was **Fang Zhong**.#\n\nThe *Records of the Hidden Residence* state: *\"There is a tomb in Qiantang, near the **Linping** mound and altar, where the descendants of the **Miao** clan still linger in the vicinity. At times, the sound of drums and horns is heard, and outsiders dare not disturb it. It is commonly called the **Tomb of Registrar Yao**.\"*\n\nZhang Ji’s son, **Zhang Feng**, originally named **Ji Zi**, whose courtesy name was **Gongxian**, was from **Henan**. In his youth, he was called **Ji Zi**. He abandoned worldly affairs and entered **Ke Mountain**, where he met **Master Shantou**, who taught him the **Lian Yu Method**. After practicing it, he attained **Dao**. He then advanced to the **Purple Master’s Bureau**, where he was to serve as the **Celestial Marshal of the Supreme Pole (Tai Ji Xian Hou)**.»#\n\n---\n#1: *Note: The original text appears to have a typographical error (\"作字子相\" likely means \"recorded as Zixiang\" rather than \"Zixiang\" again).*\n#2: *The term \"Metropolis\" (洞中) here refers to the Daoist Celestial Metropolis (Dongzhong), a realm of immortals.*\n#3: *The term \"Upper Calculations\" (上计) refers to a Han-era office for assessing local officials' performance.*\n#4: *The term \"North River Celestial Registrar\" (北河司命) is a Daoist office overseeing water-related affairs.*\n#5: *The term \"Nine Refining Qi Methods\" (九炼精气) refers to a Daoist practice of refining vital essence (jing) and qi.*\n#6: *The \"Bureau of the Purple Master\" (紫华官) is a Daoist administrative division, and \"Celestial Marshal of the Supreme Pole\" (太极仙侯) is a high-ranking immortal official.*\n\nAt times, he also held the office of **Nine Palaces Chancellor**, mirroring the **North River Marquis** in overseeing water governance. The *Record of the North River Celestial Registrar* states that he was also known as **Forbidden Preservation Marquis**, sharing the same duties by tradition. His governance was conducted within the **Celestial Metropolis**.\n\nThe **Record-Keeper’s Bureau** had its **Law Enforcer** **Chunyu Zhen**, styled **Shuxian**, who oversaw examinations of those who had attained the Dao. Zhen hailed from Shangyu in **Willow Grove**, having served as a county magistrate in **Xu Province** during Emperor Huan of Han. In his youth, he cultivated the Dao, mastered numerology and divination, and consumed **hempseed and rehmannia qi** elixirs. Later, he retreated into the **Hao Wu Target Mountain**, where he encountered the immortal **Huichezi**, who transmitted the *Rainbow Landscape Elixir Canon*. Through practice, he attained the Dao and took up his duties within the Metropolis.\n\nThe **Preservation of Life Bureau** had its **Bright Dawn Attendants**, with the **Office of Divine Mandate** overseeing the **Three Officials**—its staff numbered seven: four women and three men. The seven **Bright Dawn Attendants** held roles akin to modern **Censors-in-Chief**, all subordinate to the **Purple Master’s Domain**, with the **Preservation of Life Lord** overseeing them collectively.\n\n**Zhou Yuanzhi** was the daughter of **Zhou Chang** (styled **Bochi**), the **River South Administrator** of Han. Chang, from **Ancheng in Ru South**, practiced hidden virtue, his deeds unnoticed yet profound. During the second year of **Yongchu**, a severe drought struck, and he collected and buried over ten thousand corpses of travelers who had died near Luoyang, erecting a righteous tomb and conducting funeral rites. The rains returned, and the harvests flourished—his deeds were many such. His hidden virtue reached the **Highest Sovereign**, who commanded Yuanzhi to receive transformation in the **Southern Palace** and ascend to the Metropolis. In her youth, Yuanzhi also cultivated the Dao, consuming **reed rhizome** for thirty years before encountering **Stone Longevity**, who taught her the **Method of Transformation and Evasion**—a form of **upper body ascension**. The *Hidden Residences* notes that Chang was Zhou Jia’s younger cousin, serving as **River South Administrator** during Emperor Chao’s reign and later as **Grand Officer of Light**. **Zhang Taozhi** was the mother of **Zhu Yu**, the **Secretary of the Capital Region** in Han. Zhu’s mother practiced hidden virtue, and though long rumored to have ascended, she was later appointed as an attendant. The *Hidden Residences* states that Zhu, from **Pei**, was among the **Eight Virtuous Ones** of the **Huan-Ling era**.\n\n**Xia Fu**, styled **Zizhi**, of **Chenliu**, in his youth cultivated the Dao, consuming **wood-based elixirs** and mixing **mica**. Later, he entered **Hao Mountain**, where he studied the **Soul-Refining Method** under **Red-Bearded Master**, and later received the **Yellow Water Cloud Nectar Method** from **Tongxiang True Person**, attaining the Dao and ascending to the Metropolis. In his youth, Fu was summoned by a government office but departed by inscribing his resignation on a wall and hanging it from a mulberry tree—his lofty ambition thus displayed. The *Hidden Residences* and *Records of Later Han and High Virtue* state that Fu was a **Yù official** of **Chenliu**, recommended for his **upright speech** during Emperor Huan’s reign but declining the post. The *True Revelations* states that such attendants were selected based on **equanimity, rectitude, hidden virtue, and clarity of spirit**, without gender restriction. The remaining individuals cannot be enumerated here.\n\nThe **Preservation of Life Bureau** also had its **Forbidden Prohibitions Overseer**.\n\nZhang Xuanbin, a native of Dingyi in Shanyang. During the reign of Emperor Wu of Wei, he was recommended as a **Teacher of Virtue** (茂才). Returning to his hometown, he became a disciple of Ji Gong of Xīhé, learning to take **wooden decoctions** (服木饵) and practicing the **Dao of the Primordial Void** (洞房元白) within the **Cavern of the Mysterious** (元白之事).\n\nLater, he encountered the **True Person** Fan Ziming at Shàoshì Mountain and was taught the **Dao of Evasion and Transformation** (遁变隐景之道). Once he resided at Tiānzhù Mountain, then moved to Huáyáng’s inner chambers, becoming the **Overseer of Forbidden Prohibitions** (理禁伯).\n\nThe **Overseer of Forbidden Prohibitions** was the official in charge of **meteorological rites** (主雨水官), also serving as the **Supervisor of the Preservation of Life Bureau** (保命之监国). Xuanbin excelled in discussing **emptiness and non-existence** (空无), being a **Daoist adept** (谈士), often expounding:\n\n*\"Non-existence* (无) *is the dwelling of the Great Existence* (大有), *and the lesser existence* (小有) *is where it arises. By accumulating lesser existence to nourish lesser non-existence* (积小有以养小无), *one perceives the Great Existence as the root of the Great Non-existence* (见大有以本大无). *Existence is also non-existence, and non-existence is also existence* (有有亦无焉，无无亦有焉). *Thus, my eyes see nothing, yet nothing hides from me. Non-existence depends on existence to achieve non-existence* (无寄有以成无), *and depends on non-existence to attain non-existence* (寄无以得无). *In this way, non-existence has no dwelling* (於是无则无宅也), *yet the Absolute Void also dwells in non-existence* (太空亦宅无矣).\n\n*Before my birth, the world knew no non-existence* (我未生时，天下皆无无也). *I once visited* **Left Lord of Penglai**, **Song Chengsheng** (蓬莱左公宋晨生), *and discussed non-existence with him. His understanding surpassed others, and even the* **True Persons of Tongwu** (桐梧诸真) *could not refute him. Beyond this, I have yet to grasp the root of existence* (过此以去，尚未能本有)， *how could I grasp non-existence?* (安能本无耶) *Such was his lofty* **qi** (高气) *and profound Daoist principles* (秉理如此).\n\nThe **Deputy of the Preservation of Life Bureau** (保命府丞).\n\nZhào Wēibó, a native of Shù Commandery, in his youth studied under Master Zhāng of Nàzōu. He carried the luminosity of the sun and moon and wore the radiant petals of the Nine Spirits’ Mirror. Later, at Zhōngyuè, he received the *Yùpèi Jīndāng Jīng* from Fàn Qiūlín. Qiūlín was the wife of Wèi Xíngdào, the Han *Lóuchuán* General. The *Hétú* states: *\"Hàochǔ has many who have glimpsed the Great Peace.\"* He often told others: *\"These words are not false—this proof will soon manifest.\"* The luminous mirror he preserved was not of the ordinary world’s craft. After attaining the Dao, he dwelled within Huáyáng, serving as Deputy of the Preservation of Life.\n\nThe Preservation of Life Bureau has four deputies: Zhào oversees the *xiānjiè* (仙籍, celestial registers) and violent storms, commanding the Five Sacred Herbs of gold and jade. Those seeking torrential rains may present petitions to him.\n\nOne deputy is Lè Chángzhì of Xiányáng, a native of Dōngqīng, where the Lord of *Sìmìng* resides. He was recommended by the *Máoxiǎo* Lady and appointed as Imperial Secretary during Emperor Huán’s reign. Later, he studied the *Bùqī Yuānfǎ* from Master Lǐ of Zhōngyuè and ascended as an immortal. Chángzhì oversees calamities.\n\nAnother deputy is Zhèng Zhìzhèng, a disciple of the Inner Chamber of Master Méng. Méng recommended him, and he oversees examinations and registries.\n\nThe fourth deputy is Master Táng of Xīshān, a native of Fáng Shǔ. He served Lǐ Bābó. Táng oversees life and death.\n\nThe *Zhōu Shì Xuántōng Jì* records: Huáng Yuánpíng, of Dōnghǎi, was about thirty years old, dressed in white linen robes. Yuánpíng carried a black tablet, which he presented to Deputy Zhào of the Preservation of Life, though he held no official rank. Lǐ Zhěng of Héjiǔ once received the *Shǒuyī Fǎ*, practiced in a cavernous chamber, and attained the Dao. Initially at Yángluò Shān, he later entered Huáyáng, where he also oversaw examinations and rituals for the people. Zhěng had once served as a tutor for the Lord of Chángdào, receiving the Dao and entering the mountains at age sixty. The *Yǐnjū* states: *\"Zhěng resided at Sìpíng Shān and Dàmáo’s eastern peak, where he gathered victory stones, consuming them to attain the Dao. The gathering site remains.\"*\n\nZhōu Zǐliáng, styled Yuánsù, with the inner taboo *Tàixuān* and the style *Xūlíng*, was a native of Yǒngjiā. As a hidden recluse, he was a disciple of Gāojì. On the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month in the fourteenth year of Liáng Tiānjiàn (515 CE), he underwent *báirì shījiě* (白日尸解, daytime dissolution of the corpse) at age twenty. The recluse compiled his daily records of true transformations, categorizing them into four volumes, which he presented to Emperor Wǔ of the Liang—this became the *Zhōu Shì Xuántōng Jì*. The text records two officials appointed as deputies of the Preservation Bureau, a position newly established to assist in managing celestial registers. Though their duties were minor, their virtue and purity were esteemed. Later, they would ascend to *Bǎochén Sī* (保晨司), overseeing the Daoist practices of immortals across the world and the methods of instruction.\n\nThe ghostly marshals of the Preservation of Life Bureau—Wáng Yán, Fù Huǎng, Fàn Qiáng, and Xú Wèi—were originally Daoist *sàijiào* (祭酒, ritual toasts). Having mastered the *xiàjiě fǎ* (下解法, method of descending dissolution), they were appointed as ghostly marshals.\n\n**Huáyáng’s Celestial Child of Jade**—The *Zhōu Shì Xuántōng Jì* records: In the heavens of Huáyáng, the Marshal of Dawn, Jade Child, surnames Jǐng, named Shàngqī.\n\n**The Recluse of Xiāoxián Palace**—The *Zhōu Shì Xuántōng Jì* records: The Daoist official Zhāng Zǐ’ān of Xiāoxián, wearing a *fúróng guān* (芙蓉冠, hibiscus crown) and crimson embroidered robes, with three attendants. Zǐ’ān’s given name was Xiào, a native of Jiàjǐng in Róngyáng.\n\n**Initial Marshal of the Bureau, Liú Wénráo**—Liú Kuān of Hóngnóng.\n\nAt seventy-three, one day he encountered Master Qīnggǔ in his chamber, who taught him the *zhàngjiě fǎ* (杖解法, staff dissolution method) and, as he prepared to depart for Huàshān, instructed him in the *jiǔxī fúqì* (九息服气, nine-breaths qi cultivation). He was also given the elixir furnace-fire formula. Having perfected his Dao, he later returned to the grotto, where he oversaw those who first sought the Way.\n\nKuān served the Han, rising to the rank of *Sītú Tàiyuè* (司徒太尉, Grand Tutor and Grand Marshal). He delighted in practicing *yīndé* (阴德, hidden virtue), rescuing the cold and destitute, and the common people rejoiced and clung to him as to parents. His biography appears in the *Hànshū*.\n\n**Superintendent of the Bureau, Fàn Yòuchōng**—A native of Liáoxī.\n\nHe received the *Tàisù tāihuà yìxíng* (太素胎化易形, Supreme Primordial Embryonic Transformation and Metamorphosis) Dao. Daily, he would preserve the three *qì*—green, white, and red—each as a boat, drawing them from the *shùfāng* (束方, bound direction) as the sun descended, guiding them straight into his mouth. He would then embrace them ninety times before stopping once sated. Practicing this for ten years, he attained the Dao.\n\nHis method was concise, and its efficacy was proven—a secret transmission of the Supreme Primordial Dao. The \"Superintendent Fàn\" refers to this man, who once served as Superintendent of the Bureau and now resides in Huáyáng.\n\n**Daoists of the Bureau:**\nThe Bureau of Jǔngchū includes Wáng Shàodào, Fàn Shūshèng, and Lǐ Bóshān—all its foremost figures.\n\n**Wáng Shàodào**—A man of the Han era, surnamed Wáng, originally named Zhú’ér (逐儿). **Yùn**—a Han-era governor of Shānyáng.\n\n**Fàn Shūshèng**—A native of Běidì, who served as *Huángmén Làng* (黄门郎, Imperial Attendant) under Wèi Wéndì.\n\n**Lǐ Bóshān**—Father of Lǐ Chōng, who, in the Han, held the office of *Báimǎ Lìng* (白马令, White Horse Prefect). Chōng practiced *yīndé*, and it is said that either through accumulated merit over generations or innate virtue, his benevolence was profound. These Daoists all advanced step by step, gaining entry to this Bureau—not necessarily having come directly here.\n\n**Grand Justiciar of the Three Officials:**\nFàn Shuài said: The Three Officials have a judicial officer, not called *Tíngwèi* (廷尉, Censorate), but *Dàlǐ* (大理, Grand Justiciar). Lǐ Fēng now serves as the *Shǒuhuò* (守缺, acting) Grand Justiciar of Dūyú, having been compared to Wáng Fùzǐ (王附子) but not to Xǔ Hǔ (许虎).\n\n*The Hidden Residence* records: Lǐ Fēng, courtesy name Ānguó (安国), later changed to Xuānguó (宣国), was from Féngyàn. Lǐ Yì’s adopted son, originally of humble birth, possessed talent and ambition, and thus entered service under Wèi as *Shàngshū Fúshè* (尚书仆射, Minister of War).\n\nThe Grand Justiciar is the ancient judicial officer; during the Former Han and Wèi, the *Tíngwèi* was also called *Dàlǐ*. This is a Daoist office. Wáng Fùzǐ was the childhood name of Wáng Huò, and Xǔ Hǔ refers to *Hǔyá* (虎牙, Tiger Claw).\n\n**Earthly Overseer:**\nBào Shuō, courtesy name Tàixuān (太玄), a native of Chénliú.\n\nHe served the Jìn, repeatedly summoned to the post of *Huángmén Shìlàng* (黄门侍郎, Imperial Attendant), later appointed Governor of Nánhǎi. Proficient in the mysteries of the grotto and well-versed in the *jīngwéi* (经纬, classics and divination), none could fathom his depth.\n\nBào Shuō’s master, **Zǔ Yuànfàng**, transmitted to him the *Zhōngbù Fǎ* (中部法, Central Sect Teachings) and the *Sān Huáng Nèi Wén* (三皇内文, Inner Scriptures of the Three Sovereigns), enabling him to command and subdue spirits and demons, and to seal mountains and pacify malevolent forces. Later, upon **Jiǎngshān**, he encountered the True Person **Yīn Chángshēng**, who instructed him in the *Dāojiě* (刀解, Blade-Severance) technique for protection.\n\nAccording to the *Zhēnxù* (《真诰》), both Bào Shuō and his sister were descendants of a seventh-generation ancestor who had accumulated profound *yīndé* (阴德, hidden virtue), thus granting their lineage enduring blessings—hence their roles as **Earthly Overseers**. Within the grotto palaces, Bào Shuō’s studies were initially shallow and his nature unrefined, so he did not attain greater mastery.\n\nThe *Yǐnjū* (《隐居》) states: Bào Shuō employed the *Tàiqīng Shījiě* (泰清尸解, Embalmed Dissolution of the Mortal Frame) technique, suggesting that his rank among the Overseers was not the highest.\n\nBào Shuō’s daughter, **Bào Gū**, became the wife of **Gě Hóng**, the *Sànqí Chángshì* (散骑常侍, Standing Attendant of the Scattered Cavalry). Both Bào Gū and **Zhìchuān** (稚川) ascended to immortality in succession. There is also a separate account of **Bào Gū’s** use of *ài* (艾, mugwort) and *zhú* (灼, cauterization) to subdue a dragon maiden.\n\n---\n*Teammountain Records, Volume 13* concludes here.\n---\n*Teammountain Records, Volume 14* begins with the **Shàngqīng Sìzōng Shī** (上清嗣宗师, Successor Master of the High Clarity Dao) **Liù Dàbīn**.\n\n**Records of the Celestial Bureaucracy**\n\n**Yì Qiān’s Immortal of the Transferred Palace**\nThe *Yìqiān Guǎn* (易迁馆) and the *Hántián Tái* (含真台) are both official titles. Within the *Yìqiān Zhōngdū* (易迁中都), there were eighty-three immortals.\n\nThere was also **Xié Chén Fūrén** (协辰夫人), the true maiden of the Nine Palaces. The *Tàishàng* (太上) once dispatched her to instruct this group in Dao, granting them the *Bǎomìng* (保命, Longevity Prescriptions) and scriptures. **Xié Chén Fūrén** oversaw their teachings.\n\nThe lady was **Huáng Jǐnghuá** (黄景华), daughter of the Han *Sīkōng* (司空, Grand Tutor) **Huáng Jūn**. She studied under **Hán Zhōng**, who taught her the *Mínshān Dān* (岷山丹, Mineral Elixir of Mount Mín). Upon ingesting it, she attained immortality.\n\n**Zhào Sùtái** (赵素台), the *Tái* (台, Pavilion), had resided in *Yìqiān Zhōngdū* for four hundred years and refused to depart, claiming no place on Earth surpassed its joy. She was the daughter of **Zhào Xī** (赵熙).\n\nDuring the Han, **Zhào Xī** served as *Yōuzhōu Cìshǐ* (幽州刺史, Prefect of Yōuzhōu) and performed deeds of mercy for the destitute. He rescued **Wáng Huì** (王惠) and others from execution in the **Hézhōng** (河中) region, accumulating over ten acts of hidden virtue. Thus, his spirit was summoned to **Zhūlíng** (朱陵), while his sons dwelled in the *Dòngtiān* (洞天, Cavernous Heavens).\n\n**Zhào Xī** frequently entered the *Dìnglù Fǔ* (定录府, Bureau of Recorded Destiny), while **Sùtái** often wandered the Daoist paths in plain attire, content with the mountains and marshes.\n\nThe *Xuántōng Jì* (《玄通记》) states: Among the *Yìqiān* were the Daoist consorts, including **Zhào Fūrén** (赵夫人), styled **Sùtái**, aged over thirty, clad in emerald brocade.\n\nWithin *Yìqiān Zhōngdū*, there were those of high attainment yet humble demeanor: **Bǎo Qióngyīng** (宝琼英), **Hán Tàihuá** (韩太华), **Liú Chūnlóng** (刘春龙), **Wáng Jìnxián** (王进贤), **Lǐ Xīzǐ** (李奚子), and **Guō Shūxiāng** (郭叔香). These six possessed innate brilliance, serene and distant in bearing, surpassing in talent and eloquence, their presence striking all who beheld them—truly the elite among the Celestial Overseers and prodigies of the Dao. Below them stood figures like **Zhāng Jiāngzǐ** (张姜子) and his ilk.\n\n**Dòu Qióngyīng** (窦琼英) was the sister of **Dòu Wǔ** (窦武). Her seventh-generation ancestor, **Dòu Zhì** (窦峙), practiced the art of reviving the dead through the preservation of skeletal remains, and thus his lineage’s virtue extended to **Qióngyīng**.\n\n**Hán Tàihuá** was the daughter of **Hán Ānguó** (韩安国) and the wife of **Lǐ Guǎnglì** (李广利), the Han *Èrshī Jiāngjūn* (二师将军, General of the Two Armies). **Lǐ Guǎnglì** had accumulated merit in past lives and now resides in the *Nángōng* (南宫, Southern Celestial Bureau) receiving transformation.\n\n**Liú Chūnlóng** was the daughter of **Liú Fèngxiān** (刘奉先), the Han *Zōngzhèng* (宗正, Minister of Ceremonial Rites).\n\n**Lǐ Xīzǐ** was the grandmother of **Lǐ Zhōng** (李忠). **Lǐ Zhōng**, the Eastern Píng *Tàishǒu* (东平太守) of the early Jin, was once a humble *Tiánshèrén* (田舍人, rural commoner). Yet he harbored profound hidden virtue—during a severe winter, he refused to cover his stored grain, even exposing it in his courtyard for fear that sparrows might starve. Such was his compassion.\n\n**Wáng Jìnxián** was the daughter of **Wáng Yǎn** (王衍).\n\n「Guō Shūxiāng was the mother of **Yì Qiān** (王修).\n\nFurthermore, **Yì Qiān**’s maid, known as **Liùchū** (六出), bore the surname **Tián** (田), hailed from **Yúyáng** (渔阳), and was the granddaughter of **Tián Fěng** (田讽), the Prefect of **Jùnyí** (浚仪). At around twenty-two or three, she possessed a graceful appearance and a noble character, demonstrating great virtue—she was also destined to attain transformation alongside **Yì Qiān**.\n\n**Yì Qiān**’s left consort, **Wáng Fūren** (王夫人), adopted the courtesy name **Tàiyīng** (太英), was about twenty years old, and clad in crimson attire.\n\n**Yì Qiān**’s right consort, **Liú Fūren** (刘夫人), with the courtesy name **Xuánwēi** (玄微), was also around twenty, dressed in emerald-green robes.\n\n**Yì Qiān**’s *Dūshǐ* (都司学) **Táo Fūren** (陶夫人), renamed herself **Zhì’ān** (智安), was approximately forty years old, wearing garments of green above and purple below.\n\n**Xǔyuán**’s mother, originally named **Kēdòu** (科斗), underwent a change of name—perhaps this refers to her transformation.\n\n**Yì Qiān** studied under **Lǐ Fēihuá** (李飞华), a native of **Huáiyín** (淮阴), who had resided in **Yì Qiān**’s abode for ninety-four years. At around twenty years of age, he was skilled in the **Qīngyī** (青衣) Dao/Way.\n\nIn **Yì Qiān**’s abode, there were also **Liǔ Miàojī**’s grandson **Fāng Huá** (芳华) and **Ruǎn Huìxiāng** (阮惠香). These three individuals had cultivated profound Daoist/Wayist attainments and were granted passage into the **Bāzhōu Jūtái** (八洲朱台) of the eighth rank, where they received scriptures and became *Xiānfēi* (仙妃, Celestial Consorts).\n\n**Zhāng Jiāngzǐ** (张姜子) was from **Xīzhōu** (西州), the younger sister of **Zhāng Jì** (张济).\n\n**Lǐ Huìgū** (李惠姑) was from **Qí** (齐), the wife of **Xiàhòu Xuán** (夏侯玄).\n\n**Shī Shūnǚ** (施淑女) was from **Shānyáng** (山阳), the daughter of **Shī Jì** (施绩).\n\n**Zhèng Tiānshēng** (郑天生) was the mother of **Dèng Zhī** (邓芝).\n\nThese several women, in their past lives, had practiced benevolent conduct of great renown. They were all granted residence in the *Dòng* (洞, Caverns).\n\n**Hánzhēntái’s** *Xiānrén* (仙人, Immortal)\n\nThe **Hánzhēntái** (含真台), where these women who have attained the Dao/Way reside, is under the jurisdiction of the **Tàiyuán Shùgōng** (太元束宫, Celestial Bureau of Grand Unity), housing nearly two hundred individuals.\n\n**Dìnglùjūn** (定录君) remarked: The **Hánzhēntái** (含真台) exists within all *Dòngtiān* (洞天, Caverns of Heaven), not exclusively here. This particular **Hánzhēntái** (含真台) is uniquely affiliated with the **Tàiyuán Fǔ** (太元府, Grand Unity Bureau), and falls under the administration of the *Sīmìng* (司命, Bureau of Fate).\n\nWithin it, two **Nǚzhēn** (女真, True Women) oversee the affairs: One is **Zhāng Wēizǐ** (张微子), the daughter of **Zhāng Qìng** (张庆), the Han *Zhāngdì* (昭帝, Emperor)’s *Jiāngzuò Dàjiàng* (将作大匠, Grand Master of Construction). **Zhāng Wēizǐ** (张微子) was devoted to the Dao/Way, attaining the *Shījiěfǎ* (尸解法, Method of Corporeal Dissolution), and habitually ingested *Wùqì* (雾气, Mist Qi), receiving her teachings from **Shùhǎi Shùhuá Yùfēi Chúnwénqī** (束海束华玉妃淳文期), the younger sister of **Qīngtóng** (青童, Azure Boy).\n\nThe *Wùqì* (雾气) refers to the refined essences of mountains, marshes, rivers, lakes, and the five elements—metal and stone *Yíngqì* (盈气, Qi of Abundance). By consuming it, one can disperse one’s corporeal form into the void and merge with clouds and mist.\n\nThe other is **Chuányǐ Hé** (传礼和), the daughter of **Fù Jiàn** (傅建), the *Shìzhōng* (侍中, Attendant-in-Ordinary) and distant cousin of the Han *Huándì* (桓帝, Emperor). Her family ardently practiced the **Fó** (佛, Buddha) and made diligent progress. She would often sweep and clean before the **Fó** (佛) at dawn and dusk, fervently vowing and praying, her heart’s desire being to transform into a celestial being. The divine spirits recognized her sincerity, and she was thus granted passage to this place. After spending a long time in **Yì Qiān**’s abode, she eventually became the overseer of **Hánzhēntái** (含真台). She habitually consumed the *qì* (气) of the Five Stars to attain the Dao/Way, and **Hé** (和) was skilled in song, such that birds and beasts would fly and gather to listen to her voice.\n\n**Máoshān’s** *Xiānrén* (仙人, Immortals)\n\n**Zhǎnshànggōng** (展上公), a figure from the time of **Gāoxīn** (高辛, Emperor Gao Xin).」\n\n「The *Dìnglù* (定录) recorded the words of **Zhǎnshànggōng** (展上公): **Zhǎnshànggōng** (展先生) once studied the Dao/Way under **Fùlóng** (伏龙, Master Fu Long), where the mountain was planted with peach trees, filling every corner of his dwelling.\n\n**Zhǎnshànggōng** (展先生) now serves as the **Yòubǎoshī** (右保司, Right Protector) of the Nine Palaces. He once said to the other Immortals: *\"Long ago, in Huáyáng (华阳), I ate white peaches, whose flavor was extraordinary. I barely remembered the taste when suddenly—three thousand years had passed!\"*\n\n**Jiāngshūmǎo** (姜叔茂), the **Bālíng** (巴陵) Marquis of **Qín** (秦), attained the Dao/Way at **Jùqū Shān** (句曲山). He cultivated the Five Fruits and Five Pungent Herbs, selling them in exchange for cinnabar.\n\nShūmǎo (叔茂) once wrote to the officials of **Tàijí** (太极, the Supreme Ultimate): *\"I once studied the Dao/Way in Guǐgǔ (鬼谷), attained it on Shàoshì (少室), nourished my wings in Huáyáng (华阳), and awaited my ascent in Yìyù (逸域). At that time, I rode in a gusting carriage and feasted at Jùqū (句曲).\"* Reflecting on these words, he sighed deeply, lamenting the swift passage of time, the survival of things while people perish, and his own futile labor.\n\n**Zhōu Tàibīn** (周太宾), endowed with talent and skill, excelled in playing the *qín* (琴, zither). Once, he taught **Mí Chángshēng** (麋长生) and **Sūn Guǎngdiàn** (孙广田, i.e., **Sūn Dēng** 孙登) the art of longevity. With a single string, he could play all eight tones—a truly remarkable feat.\n\n**Dù Qì** (杜契), courtesy name **Guǎngpíng** (广平), was from **Dùlíng** (杜陵) in **Jīngzhào** (京兆). At the beginning of the **Jiàn’ān** (建安) era, he crossed the **Jiāng** (江, Yangtze River) and relied on **Sūn Cè** (孙策). Later, **Sūn Quán** (孙权) appointed him as the **Lìxìn Xiàowèi** (立信校尉). In the second year of **Huángwǔ** (黄武), he gradually began studying the Dao/Way. He encountered **Jièmiè** (介玫) Master, who taught him the **Xuánbái Wèi** (玄白卫, Mysterious White Protection) method, allowing him to eventually vanish his form.\n\nHe resided in **Zhōng Máo** (中茅), then departed and came to **Liángcháng Shān** (良常山). **Dù Qì** (杜契) and **Xú Zōngdù** (徐宗度), along with **Yàn Xiāngshēng** (晏贤生), were all in the **Máoshān** (茅山) region. At times, they could enter the **Dòng’ěr** (洞耳, Cave of Ears). Some would secretly gather and trade their clothing and food in the **Chóuqū** (墟曲) marketplace, yet no one would know of their presence.\n\n**Xú Zōngdù** (徐宗度) was from **Jìnlíng** (晋陵), serving as **Sūn Huò** (孙皓)'s **Zuǒ Diǎnjūn** (左典军) and **Lǚ Dì** (吕悌)'s **Shìmǎ** (司马). He received the **Fēnggǔ** (风谷) Master's **Qì Jìn Wèi** (气禁卫, Qi-Protection) method.\n\n**Yàn Xiāngshēng** (晏贤生) was the nephew of **Bùjīng** (步惊), the disciple of **Zōngdù** (宗度). The text *\"Yǐnjū\"* (隐居) states: *\"Qì (契) sounds like 'Xuē' (薛), Qì (契) with four strokes is 'Guǎngpíng' (广平), and Qì (契) with three strokes is 'Zōngdù' (宗度). The distinction in strokes marks their difference in rank.\"* **Dù Qì** (杜契) had two disciples.\n\nOne was **Sūn Fèn** (孙贲)'s daughter, **Hánhuá** (寒华). **Sūn Fèn** (孙贲) was the younger brother of **Hàodà** (昊大) Emperor's **Quán** (权), serving as the **Yùzhāng Tàishǒu** (豫章太守). His father was posthumously named **Shānyīn Wáng** (山阴王), with the given name **Xí** (讳奚). **Hánhuá** (寒华) first entered **Jiàn’ān** (建安). Later, she came to **Máoshān** (茅山), practicing the **Xuánbái Fǎ** (玄白法, Mysterious White Method), and had a youthful appearance.\n\nHis other disciple was **Chén Shìjīng** (陈世京). **Shìjīng** (世京) was an official under **Sūn Xiū** (孙休) during his time as **Shìláng** (侍郎). Young, he took to the Dao/Way and frequently entered **Fó sì** (佛寺, Buddhist temples). Since he was from the same region as **Dù Qì** (杜契), he later received his teachings as well.\n\nThese disciples dwelled outside **Máoshān** (茅山), not as permanent residents within the caves. Yet, they too could sometimes enter the **Dòng’ěr** (洞耳).」\n\nZhèngyīng (左慈), courtesy name Yuànfàng (元放), during the **Jiàn’ān** (建安) era of the **Hàn** (汉), observed strict fasting and ascetic practices before ascending **Máoshān** (茅山). He entered the **Dòngxū** (洞虚) to craft an **yīnguān** (阴官, shadowy official), where the **Sānmáo Jūn** (三茅君) bestowed upon him divine **shénzhī** (神芝, sacred fungi). He then sought **Yùmén Dānshā** (玉门丹砂, cinnabar) from the **Sīmìng Jūn** (司命君), obtaining twelve *jīn* (斤).\n\nThe *Yǐnjū* (《隐居》) states: Yuànfàng was likely driven by **Wèiwǔ** (魏武) before returning, and the cinnabar he requested was used to forge the **Lúhuǒ Jiǔhuá Dān** (炉火九华丹, Nine-Petal Furnace Elixir).\n\nThe **Dìnglù Jūn** (定录君) spoke in silence: *\"Zhèngyīng now resides at Xiǎokuò Shān (小括山), frequently appearing here. He often comes below, soon to be granted an official post.\"* His countenance remained youthful, a testament to the benefits of the **Lúhuǒ Jiǔhuá** (炉火九华).\n\nIt was also said that Zhèngyīng initially devoted five years to fervent worship of the **Língshān** (灵山, Sacred Mountain) before gaining deeper access to the **Dōngxī Gōng** (东西宫, Eastern and Western Palaces).\n\nHe was the master of **Lǐ Zhòngfǔ** (李仲甫) and the teacher of **Gě Xuán** (葛玄).\n\n**Pú Xiānsheng** (蒲先生), whose name is lost, often rode a white deer to gather **zhīcǎo** (芝草, fungi) on **Máoshān**.\n\n**Xǔ Xiānsheng** (许先生), named **Mài** (迈) and **Yīng** (瑛), with the courtesy name **Shū Xuán** (叔玄), hailed from **Dānyáng Jùróng** (丹阳句容). As a youth, he took to the Dao/Way, consulting **Guō Pú** (郭璞) on divination. The *Tài* (泰) hexagram’s sixth line revealed: *\"You shall attain supreme fortune from Heaven; it is fitting to study the Dao.\"*\n\nInitially, he followed **Bào Shuō** (鲍说) but hesitated to abandon his parents. He settled near **Xuánliù Shān** (悬溜山) in **Yánháng**, close to **Yánlíng’s** (延陵) **Máoshān**, which he regarded as the western gate of **Dòngtíng** (洞庭). Its channels connected to the **Wǔyuè** (五岳), a place once frequented by **Chén Ānshì** (陈安世) and **Máo Jìwěi** (茅季伟). He established a **jīngshè** (精舍, hall of refinement) at Xuánliù, traveling between the **Máolíng** (茅岭) caves, returning home only on the **suòwàng** (朔望, new and full moons) to pay respects.\n\nAfter his parents’ passing, he sent his wife, **Sūn Shì** (孙氏), back to her family, renaming himself **Xuán** (玄) with the courtesy name **Yuǎnyóu** (远游).\n\nIn **Yǒnghé Èrnián** (永和二年), he settled at **Lín’ān Xīshān** (临安西山), associating with **Wáng Yòujūn** (王右军) and his son. Later, he moved to **Línhǎi Chìshān** (临海赤山), where he encountered **Wáng Shìlóng** (王世龙), **Zhào Dàoxuán** (赵道玄), and **Fù Tàichū** (傅太初). He then became **Shìlóng’s** disciple, receiving the **jiěshù fǎnxíng** (解束反行, Unbinding and Reversal Technique) and the method of ingesting **yùyè cháo nǎojīng** (玉液朝脑精, Elixir of Jade Dew and Morning Brain Essence), achieving transcendence through timely responses.\n\nThe **Sānguān Dūjìn** (三官都禁) dispatched **Zuǒ Láng** (左郎) **Zhōu Fǎng** (周纺), bearing the **Dānjiǎn** (丹简, Elixir Register) and **Zuìbù** (罪簿, Crime Ledger), alongside **Zhǔfēi Shǐzhě** (主非使者) **Yán Báihǔ** (严白虎). They demanded an accounting of **Yīng’s** (瑛) transgressions, threatening arrest if unanswered.\n\nTerrified, **Xuānsheng** (先生) forcefully exhaled and retorted:\n*\"The Dao/Way knows no favoritism—only virtue is embraced.\nHeaven and Earth hold no bias—they reward virtue alone.\nThus, even if **Jīquán** (圾泉) flows with blood, it cannot hinder the **Lóngrán** (龙髯, Dragon-Beard) ascension.\nThe **Sānmiao** (三苗) of **Dānyě** (丹野), **Zhúlù** (涿鹿), and **Jiàngcǎo** (绛草)—how could they obstruct the **Dàshèng** (大圣) from attaining supreme enlightenment and transcendent reach?\n\nMy seventh-generation ancestor, **Xǔ Zǐ’ē** (许子阿), amassed virtue and power, his deeds unseen yet profound.\nIn years of famine and plague, when people barely survived, **Zǐ’ē** distributed wealth to rescue them, personally concocting remedies—reviving **sìbǎi bāshí** (四百八十) near-death individuals.\nHis virtue descended upon us, granting three ascensions and five salvations of the world, with names recorded by the **Tàishàng** (太上). How could such glory be yours to anticipate?\"\n\nAs he spoke, **Dìnglù Jūn** (定录君) sent **Zhōnghòu Lǐ Zūn** (中候李遵), who arrived clutching a **huǒlíng** (火铃, fire bell). **Zhōu Fǎng** and his companions laughed and fled. **Xuānsheng** was then enrolled in **Dōnghuá** (东华), becoming a **Dìxiān** (地仙) of the middle rank.\n\nLater, he relocated to **Gàizhú Shān** (盖竹山), lamenting in a letter to his **Chángshì** (长史):\n*\"I regret encountering my master too late, delaying my nature’s refinement. The arduous path to transcendence is fraught with hardship.\"*\n\nThe **Dìnglù Zhēn Jūn** (定录真君) had already revealed this.\n\n*\"The debt of gratitude to the **Chónglài Chéngfù Jiùjì** (崇赖成覆救济) is beyond what Heaven and Earth can repay.\"*\n\n**Rèn Zhēnrén** (任真人), named **Dūn** (敦) with the courtesy name **Shàngpǔ** (尚朴), hailed from **Lè’ān Bóchāng** (乐安博昌). As a youth, he studied the Dao/Way on **Luófú Shān** (罗浮山). During the early **Yǒngjiā** (永嘉) era of the **Jìn** (晋), he traveled to **Dàizōng** (岱宗, Mount Tai), later residing in **Huáyáng Nándòng** (华阳南洞). He mastered the **Bùdǒu Dào** (步斗道, Step-and-Fight Technique) and **Dòngxuān Wǔfú** (洞玄五符, Five Talismans of the Mysterious Void), capable of summoning ghosts and gods, hiding his form, and splitting his shape.\n\nHe consumed alcohol and **mùhuángjīng** (木黄精, yellow horny goat weed) elixirs. Digging seven *chǐ* (尺) into the earth, he extracted **chítán tǔ** (赤坛土, red furnace soil), resembling **chìshízhī** (赤石脂, red stone fat). He ingested nine pills daily, entering and exiting the earth.\n\nHolding **jīngkē** (经科, scriptural formulas), he taught the unenlightened, drawing followers from afar.\n\nIn **Yǒngchāng Yīnián** (永昌元年), during the **Rénwǔ** (壬午) year, a snowfall of over *zhǎng* (丈) killed half the **wūshòu** (乌兽, dark beasts). He fed them in the mountains, and **hǔlù** (虎鹿, tigers and deer) numbering in the tens gathered to eat from his hands.\n\nEach time he ventured out, a tiger with drooping ears and curled tail followed him.\n\nOne day, a man of towering stature—over *zhǎng* (丈) tall—clad in **wǔcǎi xuánhuáng yī** (五彩玄黄衣, five-colored dark-yellow robes) approached, bowing and asking:\n*\"Who are you, ghost or god? What brings you here?\"*\n\nThe man identified himself as a messenger of **Hénà Lǎojūn** (和那老君), inquiring about his credentials. The **Zhēnrén** replied that his name had already been recorded in the **Dānjiǎn**.\n\nThe **Zhēnrén** had once served as the **Dòngtiān Jiǎnzhǔ** (洞天绾主, Master of the Cavernous Heaven), refining the **Dàdān** (大丹, Great Elixir). To his disciples, he declared:\n*\"I shall soon depart for **Kuòchāng** (括苍) and **Gàizhú** (盖竹) Mountains.\"*\n\nHis former residence became the **Chóngshòu Guàn** (崇寿观).\n\nThe *Yúnjì Qīqiān* (《云岌七签_) and *Chìchéng Zhì* (《赤城志_) both record his biography.\n\n**Táoyuán Huáng Zūnshī** (桃源黄尊师), with lofty **fǎlù** (法录, spiritual records), constructed the **Tiānzūn Diàn** (天尊殿) on **Máoshān**, delivering sermons that drew thousands daily.\n\nAs the lecture platform was being assembled, a man burst in, his face dark, his speech vulgar, a **luóbiān** (骡鞭, donkey whip) at his waist—like a merchant’s attendant. He sneered:\n*\"Daoists! Gathering crowds while the world burns—what foolishness! You dare speak idly instead of secluding yourselves in the mountains to cultivate?\"*\n\n**Huáng Zūnshī** (黄尊师), unperturbed, descended from the platform without reply. The crowd, terrified, dared not protest.\n\nAfter some time, the man’s demeanor softened:\n*\"Aren’t you building a hall? How much will it cost?\"*\n**Huáng** replied: *\"Five thousand *guàn* (贯).\"*\n*\"Bring every broken pot, pan, and scrap of iron—eight or nine *jīn* (斤) worth. Dig a furnace, melt them down, then stir in two pills from my gourd.\"*\n\nHe reached into his robes and poured out the elixirs.\n\nAfter a short while, the fire had fully melted the silver. The man said:\n*\"This yields over ten thousand *guàn*—more than enough for the observatory’s construction. The lecture hall’s needs are modest; let it be abandoned.\"*\n\n**Huáng** and his disciples bowed deeply in gratitude, asking what he desired. The man laughed and left through the gate, his destination unknown.\n\nTen years later, when **Huáng** was summoned to the capital, he suddenly encountered the man with the donkey whip on a street in Chang’an. The stranger carried a bundle over his shoulder, riding a donkey beside an elderly figure—no trace of his former Te Mountain aura remained. **Huáng** moved to kneel in reverence, but the man raised his hand and pointed at the donkey rider, who then bowed repeatedly. **Huáng** merely returned a distant obeisance from afar.\n\nThe old man’s hair was now entirely white, and his appearance resembled that of a fourteen- or fifteen-year-old girl. The account appears in the *Lost Histories*. The *Te Mountain Records* concludes here—originally incomplete, supplemented from the *Pí* edition.\n\n**Admonitions on the Perfected Way**\n\n**Hàochuò** was gathering the *Zhen* when, in the early years of the divine *Fèng* era, he came to Huáyáng Cave and saw a young boy playing with three large pearls beneath a pine. Chuò approached and asked whose son he was. The boy fled into the cave, and fearing he might be harmed by a tiger, Chuò followed, calling out for help. After no more than thirty paces, the boy transformed into a dragon, clutching the three pearls to fill its left ear. Bold by nature, Chuò struck the dragon’s ear with his alchemical axe, causing the pearls to fall and vanish, and the dragon itself to disappear. Before he had taken ten more steps, the cave entrance sealed shut. During the Song dynasty’s *Xuānhé* era, Chuò was ennobled as *Yǎngsù* Master. The account appears in *The Dragon City Records*.\n\n**Xuè Biāozhī**, a native of Jìnlíng, from youth shunned worldly affairs and held no desire for rank or wealth. In the second year of the *Jiànwǔ* era of the Qi dynasty, he suspended his worldly duties to seek the hidden and mysterious. After three years, he returned and reported to the *Shùlǐng* Hall of the Great Te Mountain, where he practiced the Dao, subsisting on pine shoots and spring water, passing the years in seclusion. The hall was where the *Rèn Zhēnrén* of Jin had once attained perfection, and the tortoise-shell tablet remained, its spiritual efficacy undiminished. Thus, the master sought the ancient and true, dwelling right there.\n\n**Féng Fǎxiān**, styled *Fǎyuǎn*, was from Qǔ’ē in Jìnlíng. In the first year of the *Tiānjiā* era of the Chen emperor, the court dispatched the middle official *Yú Lì* to summon Fǎxiān, who was then conducting a three-day grand ritual. At each bow in the ceremony, the bell chimed on its own, and when he recited the *Bùxū* scripture, the same phenomenon occurred—all marveled at it.\n\n**Mǎ Shū**, styled *Yàolǐ*, hailed from *Nà* in Fúfēng. He was well-versed in the classics and histories, particularly skilled in Buddhist texts, the *Zhōuyì*, and the *Lǎozǐ Yì*. When the Prince of Shàolíng, *Lún*, served as Prefect of Nánxú, he appointed Shū as his scholar-official. When Lún raised troops to aid the capital, he entrusted Shū with twenty thousand volumes of books. Shū devoted himself to their study, then sighed deeply, saying: *\"I have heard that those who prize noble rank and office regard Confucius and Yan Hui as the highest treasures. Those who cherish mountains and forests revere Yi Yin and Lü Shang as their greatest wealth. To bind oneself to name and gain is like the lofty grass beneath the pillars of a hall, while to despise purity and emptiness is to speak of the worthless husks on a mat. Examining profound teachings, each follows their own inclination. Yet why do those who seek the Way gaze longingly at the path, as if Heaven does not favor the lofty and virtuous? Why is there no fame in the mountains and forests?\"* He then retired to Te Mountain, resolved to remain there. In the first year of the *Tiānjiā* era of the Chen dynasty, the emperor summoned him to the post of *Dùzhī Shàngshū*, but he declined. His vision was keen, able to discern objects at a distance. Swallows nested in his courtyard trees, tame and familiar, perching on his desk and coming and going for nearly thirty years. He passed away in the thirteenth year of the *Dàjiàn* era, leaving behind his *Dao Jué Lùn*, which circulated in the world.\n\n**Dài Shèng**, styled *Shìróng*, was from Qǔ’ē in Jìnlíng. At a young age, he left home, his family’s wealth exhausted, and became a laborer for the village elder *Liú Biǎo*, who was a military officer and fond of hunting. Shèng abandoned him and came to Te Mountain instead.\n\n**Chǔ Yǎ**, styled *Xuántōng*, was from Jiānyún in Hào Commandery. In the late Liang dynasty, he lived in seclusion among the mountains, generously giving away wealth and aiding the needy without measure. When his fields were ready for harvest, he would share the produce with the poor, allowing them to dwell with him. He would rise early each morning to sweep and water, and when fetching water, he would ensure that those gathering firewood and begging for alms were also provided for. In summer, he would plant melons, offering them to those who came to take them.\n\n**Huán Fǎwén**, styled *Yànshū*, was from Dāntú in Shùhǎi, a disciple of the *Táo Yǐnjū* Ertóu. He served as the *Guǎnzhǔ* for the Prince of Nánpíng, *Qīngyuǎn*, but finding his duties too burdensome and hindering his cultivation, he built a *Xuánzhōu Jīngshè* on the right side of *Yùgāng* Mountain. The recluse *Zhōu Chǔshì* inscribed on the wall of the hall:\n*\"Li Jī’s ancient tripod remains,\nZhào Xiào’s winds and clouds depart.\nLofty and boundless, ascending and descending,\nNow entrusted to you, O Master.\"*\n\nThe Prince of Wáng Sēngbiàn commissioned *Lù Huáng* to paint portraits of himself and the recluse on a screen, and also had *Fēibái* script the inscription by Sēngbiàn on the reverse. There exists a *Zhǐ Huán Jì* stating that Huán was the recluse’s attendant. The Daoist *Jiā Shànxiáng* of the Song dynasty compiled the *Transmissions of High Masters*, mistakenly adopting this claim. The *Yǐnjū* book contains his poems upon entering the mountains and his tomb inscription, which suffice to clarify the matter.\n\n**Sūn Wéntáo**, also named *Wéi*, styled *Wénzàng*, was from Kè County in Kuàijì. He entered the mountains to study under the recluse, receiving true teachings, and later saw the *Shàngjīng* handwritten by the Three True Ones, *Yáng* and *Xǔ*. He practiced copying them, becoming highly skilled. He then studied the script of the Great King, achieving profound mastery, and was praised by contemporaries. The *Jiǔxì* inscription of the Nán Dòng and the old *Guǎn* stele of *Xǔ Zhàngshì* were both his work. The reverse of the Nán Dòng stele reads:\n*\"Wéntáo’s heart was gentle yet resolute,\nHis wisdom vast and his insight profound.\nHaving mastered the arts, he left no trace—\nThus, his name was carved in stone.\"*\n\n**Qián Miàozhēn**, a woman of Jìnlíng, left her family to study the Dao under the recluse. During the *Tōngguāng* era, she lived alone in a secluded cave, reciting the *Huángtíng Jīng* at age nineteen. Her dwelling, *Yànkǒu Dòng*, remained for thirty years before she ascended. As she departed, she left a handwritten letter and seven poems to bid farewell to the recluse. One day, she donned white silk, vanished into the cave, and seized the land to establish the *Yàn Dòng Palace*. To this day, female officials tend her shrine.\n\n**The Lineage of the Upper Clarity Daoist Gě Jǐngxuān of Dānyáng:**\n\n**Shuò Shìxiǎn** of Lánlíng, having severed ties with the imperial house, devoted himself to the Dao in the mountains. His diligence in cultivation was unmatched, earning praise from ancient masters.\n\n**Shào Yuàntài** of Lánlíng, whose Daoist influence was vast and far-reaching.\n\n**Xú Bóqiān** of Shùhǎi, whose virtue and teachings were profound and harmonious.\n\n**The Venerable *Bìqí* Huìzhī** of Kuàijì, a monk who practiced *Pútí* meditation, mastering the Five Vehicles and encompassing both teachings.\n\n**Jiǎng Fùchú**, the *Guǎnzhǔ* of Yìxìng, who frequently visited Te Mountain with the resolve to entrust his fate to it.\n\nIn the second year of the *Yuán* era of the Qi dynasty, he was invited to the *Zōngyáng Guǎn* to practice and refine his cultivation.\n\n**Daoist Masters of Distinctive Spirit and Virtue:**\n\nUnmatched in cultivation, surpassing the age of *méishòu* (a traditional measure of longevity, often 120 years), and refining their *qi* through ascetic practice, they were:\n\nThe *Huàyáng* **Guànzhǔ** (Master of the *Huàyáng* Hall), **Lù Yìzhòng** of Hào Commandery.\n\nThe *Huàyáng* Hall **Guànzhǔ**, **Wáng Fǎmíng** of Tàiyuān.\n\nThese two masters, both of lofty resolve, dwelled in seclusion, never settling among the common halls.\n\nThe *Chóngyuán* Hall **Guànzhǔ**, **Zhāng Yuánzhī** of Jiāxīng, who was appointed in the *Jiànwǔ* era. He also built a pavilion atop *Jūn* Mountain, where white cranes would alight, and thus named it **Hètái** (Crane Pavilion).\n\nThe **Jūyáng Hall Guànzhǔ**, the Daoist **Pān Yuánwén** of Shàngqīng, who lived in seclusion and revered the *Sānmáo Èrxǔ Jīngbǎo* (Scriptures of the Three Teachings of Máo and the Two Teachings of Xǔ). The hall was established in the 12th year of the *Tiānjiàn* era by his invitation.\n\nThe **Sìzhēn Hall Guànzhǔ**, **Xǔ Língzhēn** of Jǔróng in Dānyáng, the sixth-generation descendant of the *Xǔ Zhēnrén* (True Person of Xǔ) lineage of the Jìn dynasty. The hall was founded in the 3rd year of the *Tiānjiàn* era by his invitation.\n\nThe **Chóngxū Hall Guànzhǔ**, Daoist **Zhāng Yì** of Hào Commandery, originally the Daoist hall established by Sòng Míngdì in the *Cháogōu* (Tidal Gorge) to honor the great *Dàfǎshī* (Grand Master) **Lù Xiūjìng**. In the *Qi Yǒngmíng* era, it was relocated to **Jiānglíng** by **Yì** (Effort), and **Táo** (the Master) revived it once more.\n\nThe **Zōngzhēn Hall Guànzhǔ**, **Wú Xiànzé** of **Qū’ē** (Curve and Ease), whose Daoist practice was profound and whose virtue was esteemed.\n\nThe **Zōngyuán Hall Guànzhǔ**, **Zhāng Xuánzōng** of Hào Commandery.\n\nThe **Chóngzhēn Hall Guànzhǔ**, **Táng Fǎyí** of

**Dǒng Dàogài** of Shānyīn.\n\n**Tóngwú Xiānshēng Wáng Guǐ**, courtesy name **Hóngfàn**, also called **Dàomó**, a native of Língyè Línshí.\n\nHis great-grandfather was **Jūn**, a **Sànqí Chángshì** of the Liang.\nHis grandfather was **Kòu**, a **Jiǎnwén Tàizǐ Xǐmǎ** of the Liang.\nHis father was **Yú**, an **Chén Zhùzuò Zuǒláng**.\n\nAt twenty, the Master served **Fǎzhǔ**, becoming a **jīnpíng dìzǐ** (disciple of the brocade bag), and remained so for sixteen years.\nHe followed **Fǎzhǔ** through the transitions of the **Suí** and **Táng** dynasties.\n\nInitially, in the **Dàyè** era’s eleventh year (615 CE), he received imperial decree to survey the twenty-four commanderies of **Hénán** for extraordinary individuals.\nDuring the **Zhēnguān** era, he was commissioned to rebuild the **Huáyáng Guàn**.\nIn the second year of **Qiánfēng** (667 CE), on the first day of the eleventh month, he told his disciples:\n*\"Yesterday, I dreamed three winged beings bore a tablet, declaring: ‘The Celestial Palace of Huáyáng requires you as its Daoist Master for ten thousand immortals, and you shall also oversee the celestial bureaucracy.’ I must now depart. Long ago, when I dwelled on Tóngwú Mountain, I already sensed this dream—now its time has come.\"*\n\nOn the eighth day, he bathed, changed into ceremonial robes, and on the ninth day, he ascended in solemn stillness.\n\nIn his eighty-eighth year, he was buried beside the tomb of the Daoist Master Táozhēn on Léipíng Mountain.\n\nWáng Yù possessed Daoist arts and resided on Qīngluó Mountain in Luòyáng. The villagers, seeing him, already took him for several hundred years old, yet he always maintained a youthful appearance. During the **Kāiyuán** era, he was summoned to the capital, where Emperor Xuánzōng observed his childlike face and flowing hair, greatly honoring him.\n\nAt that time, Xuánzōng had obtained from **Máoshān** the many Daoist masters Yáng and Xǔ, as well as the original scriptures of the *Shàngqīng* Daoist canon and true writings by Táozhēn. Among these scriptures, thirteen sheets were missing, so he dispatched Wáng Yù with imperial seals, letters, and coins to visit **Zǐyáng Guàn**, where Xuánjìng Master (Xuánjìng xiānsheng) completed the missing text.\n\nThe emperor said: *\"I do not wish to command my subjects to presume upon the Master’s favor. I entrust you alone to go—certainly, I hope for the hand of a Daoist immortal, to ensure the scriptures continue from antiquity to the present.\"*\n\nOn the day Wáng Yù arrived at the mountain, a spirit crane soared and cried. When Xuánjìng was writing the scriptures, a celestial being descended into his chamber. These were all responses to his sincere devotion. The details are recorded in *The Gathered Remnants of Daoist Transmissions*.\n\nHào Jūn was a Confucian scholar from **Lǔzhōng**, who entered **Sōngshān** and followed his teacher Pān Shìzhèng as a Daoist. He transmitted the **Shàngqīng** Dao, studying it with great diligence until he mastered its techniques. During the **Kāiyuán** era, he traveled south to **Jīnlíng**, sought Dao in **Máoshān**, and later journeyed east to **Tiāntái**. He was particularly skilled in writing, and Emperor Xuánzōng, upon hearing his name, summoned him. The emperor found his conversation delightful and appointed him as a *dàizhào* (imperial attendant) in the **Hánlín** Academy.\n\nSoon after, he requested to return to **Máoshān**, and permission was granted. Later, when chaos spread across the central plains and bandits plagued **Jiānghuái**, he withdrew to **Kuàijī Tiāntái**, where he exchanged poems with Lǐ Bái and Kǒng Cháo Fǔ. He wandered freely among springs and rocks, ultimately dying in **Yuèzhōng**.\n\nThe account is found in *The Biography of the Tang Book*.\n\nCuī Xīzhēn, a guest of **Zhōnglíng**, dwelled in the western suburbs of the prefecture. He excelled in playing the *qín* (zither) and was skilled in painting, while also cultivating Daoist practices with fervor.\n\nOn the first day of the tenth month in the second year of the **Dàlì** era, a heavy snow fell at night. At dawn, **Xīzhēn** opened his door and saw an elderly man in a **suō** (straw raincoat) and **lì** (bamboo hat) taking shelter from the snow beneath his gate. **Xīzhēn** was struck by his unusual appearance and invited him in, whereupon the old man removed his raincoat and hat. His **shénsè** (divine countenance) and **máogǔ** (frame of bones and flesh) were extraordinary, and **Xīzhēn** revered him even more, asking:\n\n\"At home, I have some **dàmài miǎn** (large barley grains). I can offer them to ease your hunger. Would you care to eat?\"\n\nThe old man replied:\n\n\"Barley absorbs the **qi** of all four seasons, making it the finest of grains. If it is seasoned with **zhǐ** (fermented soybean paste) broth, it would be even better.\"\n\n**Xīzhēn** then ordered his household to prepare the barley, and when they did, they also presented **sōnghuā jiǔ** (pine-flower wine). The old man said:\n\n\"The flowers are too astringent—no. But the common folk have something that can refine it and make it truly **chún měi** (pure and exquisite).\"\n\nHe reached into his bosom and withdrew a yellow, hard pill, striking it with a stone. After placing a small portion in the wine, its sweet fragrance became instantly distinct. He then gave the remaining pill to **Xīzhēn** as a parting gift.\n\n**Xīzhēn** returned to his home and, peering through a crack in the window, saw the old man before a **wéi** (screen) drawing on white silk. He sketched as if guided by unseen visions, then paused in an instant. When **Xīzhēn** stepped outside, the old man had vanished. He followed the snow tracks and soon reached the river, where he entered a **lúzhōu** (reed marsh). There, he saw a grand **fǎng** (boat), inside which several men of strange and striking appearances were gathered.\n\nOne of them turned and laughed:\n\n\"Bo **Gěsān**—now you are pressed by this man!\"\n\nHe then addressed **Xīzhēn**:\n\n\"Follow the **Dao** with strict discipline, and such encounters need not occur.\"\n\n**Xīzhēn** bowed in gratitude and departed. Upon returning home, he found the silk drawing. It depicted three figures, two trees, one white deer, and one **yàojí** (medicinal plant). The two figures seemed to be **fāngwài** (those beyond worldly affairs), each holding **xuánzhī** (a type of immortal herb), as if they were gathering medicine. The two trees resembled pines but bore the appearance of ancient, decayed trunks ravaged by wind and rain, their roots intertwined in an unnatural way—beyond ordinary comprehension.\n\nLater, **Xīzhēn** brought the drawing and the pill to **Shān** (Mountain) **Máoshān**, presenting them to **Lǐ Shèguāng**, the **Tiāntái** (Celestial Master). The master said:\n\n\"This is the work of the **Zhēnrén** (True Person) **Gē Hóng**, the third son of **Gěsān**.\"\n\n**Lǐ Shèguāng** further remarked:\n\n\"To depict a **Shénrén** (Divine Person) beneath withered wood suggests that those who attain the **Dao** may live longer than pines and willows. And this pill is made from the **gāo** (resin) of a thousand-year-old pine.\"\n\nThe account is recorded in *The Original Transformation Record*.\n\n**Cuī Xīzhēn**, the **Chǔshì** (Master of Retirement), lived in seclusion at **Máoshān**. In the twelfth year of the **Zhēnyuán** era, the **Yòu Jiànyì Dàfū** (Right Advisor of the Imperial Censorate) **Wéi Qúmóu** recommended him. Emperor **Dézōng** summoned him to the capital, as recorded in the **Tángshǐ** (Tang History).\n\n**Gē**, the **Daoist practitioner** (whose full name is unknown), resided at the **Pénglái Guān** (Pénglái Observatory) in the **East Sea**. He practiced **fúshí** (nourishment and abstinence) for over a decade. During the **Xiàntōng** era of the **Táng**, he attained entry into the **Huáyáng Dòng** (Cave of the Flowered Sun), where many extraordinary **língyì** (supernatural phenomena) occurred.\n\nThis is recorded in the fifteenth volume of *The Records of Máoshān*. #1: \"於\" was originally absent; added according to the **Dì** (variant) text.\n\n「#2Twelve: The variant text reads *„Three“*. #3Originally, after *„person“* there was *„clouds“*; deleted according to the variant text.\n\n**Records of Máoshān, Volume Sixteen: The *Shàngqīng Sìzōng* Master Liu Dàbīn’s *Cāizhēn Yóupiàn* (Essays on the Refined and True)*\n\n**Xiàhóu**, the recluse (whose origins remain unknown), arrived at Máoshān during the late **Dàzhōng** era of the **Táng**. He habitually carried only a coarse linen sack and a bamboo staff, consuming food like any common man, yet dwelling alone in a single chamber—or sometimes sleeping exposed beneath the altar, in grassy thickets, or at the foot of trees. When others observed him, they saw only dense **qi** clouds, not his form.\n\nEach time he wandered thirty or fifty *lǐ*, ascending mountains or crossing waters while keeping his eyes closed in blissful slumber, his companions heard his breathing and snoring, yet never stumbled in their steps. His feet #1 encountered no obstruction, and upon reaching his destination, he would awaken—earning the name *Sleeping Immortal* at the time.\n\nLater, his fate remains unknown; as recorded in *The Collected Lost Accounts of Immortals*.\n\n**Zhōu**, the recluse (whose surname was *Yóuyáo*), with the courtesy name *Xīyuán*, dwelled in the **Nándòng** (Southern Cave) of the **Chóngyuán Shèngzǔ Yuàn** (Sacred Ancestor Hall) in **Zhēnyuán** during the **Táng Bǎolì** era—this being the site where **Lǐ Gōng Déyù** of **Zànhuáng** sustained him. He also once resided on **Báoshān** (Enwrapped Mountain) in **Dòngtíng**, unmoved by day or night, unaffected by cold or heat, requiring no food yet possessing great strength, and though he drank, nothing leaked.\n\n**Lìnghú Chǔ** wrote of him. *The Collected Lost Accounts of Immortals* also contains his biography.»\n\n---\n\n**Zhāng Shào Yīng**, a native of Dānyáng, became a Daoist recluse and never entered the city gates. Emperor Rénzōng, seeking the wisdom of those outside the court, summoned him along with his friend **Zhū Zì Yīng** to meet the wondrous **Miào Zōng Shī**. They were both called to serve **Yìng Shào**, but **Zhū** declined due to illness. The following year, **Chéngxiàng Dīng Wèi** and **Wáng Qīn Ruò** jointly petitioned the throne, and **Zhāng Shào Yīng** was summoned again. Two years later, when an imperial carriage was sent a second time, both declined, citing illness.\n\nThe court dispatched a eunuch, **Rèn Guì**, to deliver a formal reprimand at the mountain. **Zhāng Shào Yīng** was granted the title *Míng Zhēn Xiānshēng*, and his dwelling was renamed **Tiān Shèng Guàn**. At seventy-five, one morning after bathing and changing his clothes, he ascended the altar, bowed to the four directions, and sat with his shoulders facing above and below. His disciples, astonished, opened the door and found him already transformed. **Wáng Qǎn**, courtesy name *Zǐ Zhēn*, from **Qíxià Píngyáng**, was a descendant of the **Sìdiàn Zhèngxiàng** and his mother was of the **Sīmǎ** clan. His brothers all pursued official careers through the imperial examinations, but he alone studied the Dao.\n\nWhile traveling in the countryside, he rested beneath a melon patch and encountered a Daoist woman begging for melons. Observing her milk-like *qi* concentrated in her abdomen, he was struck by her presence and gave her melons. She ate them and offered the remainder to him. **Wáng Qǎn** consumed it, and the woman rejoiced, saying: \"You may be taught! I am **Xiāo Sān Niáng**, and the Immortal **Hǎichán Zǐ** resides here. When you open your door at dawn, you will see him together with me.\" She then instructed him in the elixir's secrets. From that day on, he revered the statues of the **Sān Qīng** and paid homage morning and evening, reciting the *Huángtíng Jīng* for months without stepping outside.\n\nLater, he journeyed to distant sacred mountains, reaching **Chéngdū** in the west. **Fù Zhèng Gōng**, admiring his virtues, hosted him for eight years. **Chéngxiàng Lǚ Gōng** held him in even greater esteem, and officials wished to elevate him by recommending him for office as a **Guānyì Dàfū**. However, the ministers deemed him unsuited to human affairs and the proposal was abandoned. During the **Yuánfēng** era, he was again summoned to court and granted the title *Chōng Zhào Chǔshì*.\n\nHis nephew **Bìng**, who governed **Táizhōu**, wished to invite him there, but **Bìng** died before the journey could be made. Instead, **Wáng Qǎn** came to the mountain and received the **Shàng Qīng Jīng** from **Liú Xiānshēng**. On the night of his transmission, thunder rolled over **Zhōngmáo Shān**, and the door suddenly opened, revealing celestial music in the air. One day, while napping, he dreamed of two heavenly beings leading him through the door to a cave, where he met **Máo Jūn**, who declared: \"You have been assigned to oversee the **Sīmìng Fǔ** in the Northern Quarter. I grant you a golden ruler.\" Upon waking, he predicted his own death and, seated in the home of a mountain Daoist named **Gě Chōng**, ascended in transformation at age sixty-one.\n\n**Wáng Qǎn** practiced austere refinement, consuming only enough food to sustain an infant. He remained seated through the night, never removing his cap and sash, and even in old age moved with ease. **Zhāng Shùn Mín** composed an epitaph for him, which was engraved at **Fèng Xiāng**.\n\n**Tāng Yòng Míng**, courtesy name *Huì Zhī*, was a Daoist from **Zhōng Líng**. His spiritual prowess was extraordinary, and he mastered the classics while exploring profound knowledge. He specialized in the inner alchemy of the *Zuòwàng* method. At the beginning of the **Yuán Yòu** era, though still in his prime, he heard of **Liú Xiānshēng**’s teachings and traveled thousands of miles to receive them in person, befriending **Lú Bì Qiáng**, **Tāng Dào Yuán**, **Féng Yuè Dào**, **Bào Liàn Shī**, and **Wáng Jǐng Shān**.\n\nWhen **Liú Xiānshēng** was summoned to court, **Tāng Yòng Míng** and **Tāng Dào Yuán** wished to accompany him, but both declined, refusing to go. They built a hermitage on **Jīn Jūn Shān**, dwelling in seclusion beside a cave, with no contact with the outside world. Their rags and worn sandals betrayed no shame. In the early **Dàguān** era, **Tāng Yòng Míng** departed without illness.\n\n**Féng Tàishēn**, courtesy name *Yuè Dào*, of **Chízhōu**, became a Daoist and gathered ten companions to reside on the mountain. When famine struck for consecutive years, nine of them left, but only **Féng Tàishēn** remained, his *qi* refined and unyielding. He stayed long in the temple halls, revered by both Daoists and laymen. There was a **Lú Xiānshēng** who built a Daoist observatory on **Càn Shān**, but it was unfinished when he heard of the summons and abandoned the project. His disciples, numbering thousands, dared not return, so they begged **Féng Tàishēn** to lead them. He used all his offerings to repay them and returned to the temple, soon ascending in transformation at his mountain dwelling. His disciples, **Shào Cì Shān** and **Gě Zhēn Yī**, were both serene and self-disciplined, held in respect by all.\n\n**Chén Xī Wēi**, courtesy name *Yàn Zhēn*, originally named **Bó Xióng**, was from **Gūsū**. His father, **Zhī Cái**, served as a **Cháofèng Láng** overseeing the grain supplies of **Jiāngníng Fǔ**. During the **Yuán Yòu** era, **Bó Xióng** fell gravely ill, and his wife, the younger sister of **Ménxià Shìláng Xuē Áng**, begged **Liú Xiānshēng** for a talisman and sacred water to cure him. His illness was swiftly healed. After his father’s death, he took up mountain life as a Daoist, changed his name to **Xī Wēi**, and built a dwelling above **Liǔ Jì Quán**.\n\nEmperor **Huìzōng** heard his name and repeatedly summoned him, but **Chén Xī Wēi** declined each time. The court then encouraged him to establish a Daoist observatory, naming it **Bàoyuán Guàn**, and granted him the title *Dòngwēi Fǎshī*. During the **Xuānhé** era, he was invited to write petitions for others, but he resigned after just one day. **Huáng Chéng**, a native of **Pílíng**, was affiliated with **Dānyáng Xiāntái Guàn**. In the early **Chóngníng** era, he was persuaded to change the name of **Yùchén Guàn** to **Chóngníng Wànshòu Gōng**, and **Chéng** was appointed as its abbot.\n\nSoon after, **Huìzōng** issued an imperial seal summoning him to the capital. When **Chéng** arrived, he was instead assigned to oversee **Shénxiāo Wànshòu Gōng** on **Jīn Shān**. He was repeatedly granted the titles *Tàisù Dàfū*, *Chōngsù Jìngyī Xiānshēng*, and *Lǐng Yùtáng Gāoshì Zuǒyòu Jiē Dōulù Jìngyī Gōngshì*, with a stipend of 1,200 households and a purple-gold talisman. He requested retirement and returned to the mountain, departing in his hermitage built at **Yùchén**. Initially, the **Sānyuán Jīnglù**—including **Lónghǔ**, **Zhèngyī**, **Gézào**, **Língbǎo**, and **Máoshān Dàdòng**—each followed their own traditions. **Chéng** petitioned to unify them, and from this point, the lineages of **Lónghǔ Gézào** and **Shàngqīng Bìfǎ** began.\n\n**Yáng Xī Zhēn**, courtesy name *Yuán Dào*, was a descendant of the **Yízhēn Mǐshāng** family, accumulating hidden virtue. **Yuán Dào** was born in the first year of **Jiànzhōng Jìngguó** (1101), and at six he could speak. As he grew older, he knew to honor the statues of the **Sìshèng Zhēnjūn**. One night, he dreamed of a divine being who said: \"I am the Northern Quarter’s **Tiānfú Shàngshuài**. Pitying your sincere devotion, I will reverse your impure physical form and meet you at the **Huáyáng Xiānfǔ**. I will grant you a new body and bestow upon you sacred scriptures.\"\n\n「Later, the Master often communicated with the unseen and divine, and if he suffered from any physical ailment, he would rush about in a frenzy, losing all sense of direction. In the second year of **Xuānhé** (1120), in the year of **Gēngzǐ**, he entered the **Huáyáng Dòng** and did not return.\n\nThe following year, he emerged from the cave, and upon his return, his neighbors were astonished. The Master said: \"I was not truly mad before; I sought only the Dao. Now I have obtained **Tóngchū**’s initial great method, which can save the world.\"\n\nThe **Huīzōng** Emperor sought out this extraordinary man and requested the **Jiǔ Líng Yùyīng Shénbiàn** scriptures, along with the **Língxū Mìzhǐ** and other sacred texts. He was ordered to refine and compile them into the **Jiéhuáng Jiàodìng Lù**, to be included in the **Dàozàng** (Daoist Canon). The Emperor specially bestowed upon him the titles **Dāntái Láng**, **Chōnghé Miào-Yī Fǎshī**, and **Shìcháo Qǐng Dàfū**.\n\nAt the age of twenty-four, his physical form dissolved (**shísèjiě**), but after three days, he revived. He wrote a farewell note to his disciples, placed it on the door, and then sat down and passed away—on the seventeenth day of the third month, in the year of **Jiǎchén**.\n\nThus, **Tóngchū**’s method became renowned in the world, and his disciple, **Ménrén** the **Wèiláng** (Assistant Minister) **Shěn Yù**, composed the *Biography of Master Yáng Zhēn*.\n\n**Shěn Yù**, courtesy name *Zǐzhōu*, hailed from a distant lineage that, during the time of **Hàoyuè**’s **Qián Shì**, served as a strategist. They became **Qián Táng** (Hangzhou) people, and their clan flourished in grandeur. As a young man of about ten years, he took no pleasure in mundane affairs but sought out the **Yuánzhēn Guàn** in his native district and became an ascetic. In the year **Yuán Yòu Gēngwǔ** (1090), he passed the **shìjīng** (scripture examination) and became a Daoist priest at the age of thirteen.\n\nHe studied the **Dàozàng** meticulously and supplemented his learning with external texts, comparing and harmonizing them with his fellow scholars. His understanding was comprehensive and profound, especially in the art of medicine. While traveling in the mountains, he visited the **Chóngxī Guàn** and lodged there. In the latter years of **Zhènghé**, he was invited to the **Yánkāng Dìng** as a **Xuéshì** (scholar-official). **Wáng Gōng Hànzhī** sought his counsel on inner and outer alchemy (**nèidān wàidān**), and they found mutual accord. When **Wáng Gōng** led the retreat to **Jiànkāng**, he settled in the **Dòngyáng Guǎn** within the mountains, and the Master was tasked with refining the great elixir (**dàyào**) while also widely dispensing medicine to cure the sick from all directions.\n\nThe **Huīzōng** Emperor summoned him again, compelling him to take up residence in the **Lóngdé Gōng**. After several months, the Emperor granted him the title **Dòngyuán Dàshī** and appointed him to a Daoist office. He declined due to illness, and the Emperor bestowed upon him a **jīnfāng fú** (golden prescription talisman) before sending him back to the mountains.\n\nAt the beginning of the **Shàoxīng** era (1131), he consumed the elixir and his physical form dissolved (**shísèjiě**) at the age of sixty-two.\n\n**Tāng Yǒuchéng**, courtesy name *Dàoyuán*, was from **Tóngchuān** (Tongchuan). His elder brother **Tāng Jǐngrén** passed the **Jìnshì** examination. In the year **Xīníng Bǐngchén** (1066), he and his younger brother **Yǒuzhí** both took the **shìjīng** examination and became Daoist priests together.\n\n**Yǒuchéng** served under **Xú Shénwēng** in **Tàizhōu**. The Master’s understanding of the **Tiān jī** (heavenly mechanism) was profound and subtle; he rarely interacted with others, only speaking with **Yǒuchéng** at times. After residing there for over a year, he once caught two mice, sealed them in a jar, and intended to release them. But upon opening the jar, the mice were already dead. The Master scolded him sharply (**duōduō yǒu suǒ yóu**), then ignored him entirely, and **Yǒuchéng** thus left his service.\n\nThe Master then instructed him to go to **Liú Zhēnshī** to receive the scriptures and methods (**jīngfǎ**), and together they cultivated in the **Hèmiào** (Hall of Cranes). **Wáng Gōng** invited him to oversee the **dànlú** (elixir furnace), and he also followed **Wáng Gōng** into exile at **Háoliáng**. When **Wáng Gōng** returned, they once again retreated to the **Hèmiào**.\n\nDuring the **Xuānhé** Emperor’s summons for extraordinary men (**yìrén**), **Yǒuchéng** and his brother hid in secluded mountain huts, always fearing discovery. In the **Jiàn Yán** era (1127), when bandits rose in rebellion, **Yǒuzhí** fled into a deep ravine and never returned, while **Yǒuchéng** lived in the mountains for over fifty years. Upon returning from **Háoliáng** to **Jiànzhōu**, he never left his home again.\n\nIn the year **Shàoxīng Guǐhài** (1143), he foretold his passing. On the fifth day of the sixth month of that year, he drank cold water and bathed, asking when the day would end. At noon, he departed (**shì**), at the age of eighty-four.\n\n**Lǐ Jué**, a native of **Guǎnglíng Jiāngyáng** (Yangzhou), engaged in the trade of **yào** (medicinal herbs). If anyone sought his help, he would give them a measure of herbs (**shēngdǒu**) to weigh themselves, and he did not change his profession even at over eighty years of age.\n\nWhen **Li Gong**#2 **Jué** governed the **Huái Nán** region, **Jué**—sharing the same name as **Li Jué**—changed his name to **Kuān**.\n\nWithin months of **Li Jué**’s arrival, he established Daoist observances and fasts. One night, he dreamed of entering a **Dòngfǔ** (cave palace), where he saw a stone wall inscribed in gold with the name **Li Jué**, the characters spanning over a foot in length. **Jué**#3 gazed upon it with great delight, believing himself destined for the **Míng** dynasty, even to rise as a high minister. Now, he thought, his name was recorded in the **Dòngfǔ**, and he was surely a **xiānrén** (immortal).\n\nAs he rejoiced, two **qīngyī** (attendants in green robes) emerged from either side of the stone wall. **Jué**#4 asked: *\"Where is this place?\"*\nThey replied: *\"Huáyáng Dòngtiān* (a celestial cave realm). This name does not belong to you, honored sir.\"\n\n**Jué**#5 was startled and asked again: *\"If not mine, then whose?\"*\nThe attendants said: *\"It belongs to a commoner named Li from your Jiangyáng district.\"*\n\n**Jué**#6 awoke in shock, marveled, and ordered his officials to investigate for someone with the same surname and name. They found **Li Kuān**, whose former name was **Jué**, and brought him to a secluded chamber, bowing to him as a Daoist elder brother.\n\n**Kuān** was naturally serene and possessed an extraordinary Daoist bearing, with a beard over a foot long, pure and radiant. At sixty years old, a Daoist instructed him in **tāixī** (embryonic breathing) and **xī** (suspended animation), and he abstained from food for long periods. **Jué** revered him even more, inquiring about his Daoist practices, but **Kuān** humbly declined, claiming he was merely a commoner who sold medicinal herbs. **Jué**#7 sighed: *\"This is beyond the reach of ordinary mortals—his hidden virtue is unmatched.\"*\n\n**Kuān** lived over a hundred years, remaining agile and vigorous until one night he suddenly passed away. After three days, his coffin split open, revealing his body as withered as a **chántuì** (cicada’s shed skin). The account appears in the *Xù Xiān Zhuàn* (Continuation of the Immortal Records).\n\n**Fù Xiāo**, styled **Zǐ’áng**, hailed from **Jìnlíng**. Well-versed in antiquity and the classics, he excelled in calligraphy, particularly in **lì** and **gǔ** scripts. Entering Daoism from Confucianism, he resided at **Chángzhōu Tiānjìng Guàn**. Emperor **Gāozōng** summoned him to oversee the **Tàiyī** shrine, but he begged to return to **Máoshān**, receiving the title **Míngzhēn Tōngwēi Xiānsheng** and serving as **Shānmén Dùdàozhèng** at **Yùchén Guàn**, where he established the **Léipíng Yùan**. For forty years, he wandered the mountains, seeking hidden truths, rescuing the destitute, and benefiting many. He recompiled the *Yǐnjū Jí* and revised the *Máoshān Jiùjì*, though much of his work is now lost.\n\nOn the **Jìchǔ** day of the **Shàoxīng** era’s **29th year** (1159), on the first day of spring, he ascended.\n\n**Yáng Rèn Dīng**, styled **Zhíjiǎ**, was from **Xiāngzhōu** in **Héběi**, with a commanding presence and imposing **qi**.\n\nIn the **30th year of Shàoxīng** (1160), he resigned his post and entered the mountains, building a hermitage beneath **Sōngshū Fēng**. **Wáng Yáng Gōng Cúnzhōng** dispatched five hundred soldiers to assist in constructing its foundation.\n\nWhen the hermitage was complete, the master declared: *\"I have never sought faith in mortals, only in Heaven.\"* Thus, he named it **Tiānxìn** (Heaven’s Faith). The master was adept in the **biàn dùn** (transformation and evasion) arts—truly a **zhēn yǐnzhě** (true recluse).\n\nBorn in the **Chúnhuà** era of **Tàizōng** (921), he passed away on the **15th day of the 2nd month of Chúnxī** (1178), at the age of **184**.\n\n**Liú Dàohuái**, a native of **Ēnzhōu**, was known as the **Suōyī Xiānsheng** (Straw-Cape Master), residing at **Qíyún Yùan**. Emperor **Gāozōng**, in his own hand, summoned the master to serve as **Liúshǒu**, but **Cháo Gōng Qiānzhī** conveyed the imperial intent, urging him to accept. The master was forcibly escorted to the capital.\n\nAt the time, **Wán Yán Líng Yángwáng** **Wán Yán Líng** of **Jīn** (Emperor Yáng of Hǎiliáng), **Guānyán Ráng**, threatened **Guāzhōu**. The emperor, fearful, consulted him on state affairs. The master replied bluntly: *\"No matter—no matter. The north and south will simply exchange rulers.\"*\n\nSoon after, **Hǎiliáng** was assassinated, and **Gāozōng** abdicated in favor of **Xiàozōng**.\n\nThe master, aged **84**, died seated in **Qíyún**.\n\n**Táo Yuánjìng**, from **Cáozhōu**, resided in the southern mountains. Like the **Suōyī Xiānsheng**, he was summoned, but he submitted a petition declining and returned to the mountains in the **18th year of Shàoxīng** (1148). At the time, they were known as the **Táo-Liú Érgōng** (Masters Táo and Liú).\n\n**Chén Huái**, of **Jīngkǒu**, was styled **Jìngzhēn Xiānsheng**. During the **Shàoxīng** era, he served as **Dàizhì**, but declined office and retreated into the woods, constructing an **Bāguà Tái** in the east of **Máodòng**. A **shíshì** (stone chamber) with his likeness remains.\n\n**Liú Zhìxiào**, whose given name is lost, was a native of **Xiántōng Lǐ**. At the age of majority, he lost both parents and vowed to wear coarse hempen garments for life, earning the name *Zhìxiào* (\"Most Filial\"). He dwelled at the **Báiè Miào** for several years, devoting himself tirelessly to its upkeep.\n\nOne day, while repairing a hall by the sea, beneath a pomegranate tree he found an object resembling a peach. Though it was winter and out of season, he and others peeled and tasted it—it had no pit, and all discarded it. Only Zhìxiào kept some, finding its flavor exquisite. That evening, he returned to the same spot and found another object, the size of a fist, green within and red without. The next day, he discovered one the size of a palm, its color and taste like that of a peach, yet even more refined and precious. From then on, Zhìxiào abstained from all cooked food, wandering the sacred mountains until his fate was unknown. Was this not the reward of pure filial virtue? Or did he encounter only rare elixirs of the Dao? This account appears in the *Dàozàng Língyàn Jì*.\n\n**Liú Shāng**, a man of **Péngchéng** who resided in **Cháng’ān**, rose through the imperial examinations and served in the central bureaucracy as a *láng* (official). By nature, he was devoted to Daoist cultivation, often sighing at the fleeting glories of worldly office—what use were they to him? The ancient sages had all abandoned officialdom to seek the Way, and many attained transcendence to save the world.\n\nFortunate that his marriage was complete and he was free from worldly entanglements, how could he be inferior to Xu Yuan’s wandering? Thus, he resigned from office on the pretext of illness, donned Daoist robes, and set out to travel. Arriving in Guangling, he encountered a Daoist selling medicines. Among the crowd, the man noticed Liu Shang’s unusual bearing and, abandoning his wares, took his hand and led him up to a winehouse pavilion. There, he conversed on the affairs of Qin and Han as if witnessing them firsthand.\n\nLiu Shang revered him as a master. As evening fell, the man descended the stairs and vanished without a trace.\n\nThe next day, Liu Shang searched the city streets, engaging in lively discourse and drinking deeply. He then produced a small medicine pouch and presented it to Liu Shang, jesting with the verse:\n\n*\"Without purpose to Yangzhou I came,\nTogether we climbed the winehouse’s frame.\nThis pouch of medicine is my parting gift—\nWhat more could one seek across the ages?\"*\n\nAfter their separation, Liu Shang repeatedly sought him in vain, but found nine pills within the pouch. Following the instructions, he ingested them and instantly felt his spirit brightened, his hunger vanished, and his body lightened with clarity.\n\nHe then crossed the river and secluded himself in the mountains, occasionally visiting the Hu Fu Zhu docks. Woodcutters who encountered him would say, *\"There goes Master Liu the Official,\"* yet none knew his dwelling place.\n\nWen Decheng, styled Shaoshou, who called himself Shumengzi, was a native of Changle in the Three Mountains. He associated with scholars like Huì’ān Xiàngshān, and for thirty years oversaw the Yùchén Guan, compiling the Daoist Canon. Initially, he received his ordination at the Shēngyuán Guan on Jìzhōu Mountain in Hào Xīng.\n\nHe delighted in the *Tàiqíng* and the *Guīzhǔ* sutras.\n\nThe *jì* of the *jìchuán* continues:\n\nIn the fourth month of the *jiǎdìng* year *bǐngzǐ* (1216), Master Wen Decheng entered *shìhuà*, having lived to seventy-two. He was interred west of the *Jiāochí* in Wǔkāng County.\n\nFifteen years later, in the year *gēngyín*, as he rode in a shoulder-litter through the mountains near the *Bāguà Tái*, the guardian of the hermitage saw him and was astonished, saying, *\"I was sent to inspect the Daoist ritual texts of Jiangdong at Shùyùe, and now I pass through my old mountain.\"* At that moment, a pair of cranes flew with a mournful cry, as if guiding and welcoming him. He took up a brush to leave a poem before departing.\n\nThe next day, the guardian brought the poem to *Bāo Shǒumíng*, the magistrate under *Chóngxǐ* jurisdiction. Bāo recognized it as the genuine hand of his old friend, Master Wen the Lecturer, and marveled greatly. The preface to the *Dōngméng Jí* records that the poem was later published in its final volume.\n\nAs for *Jīnyuán Fàn*, a Daoist of the *Níngshén’ān*, his nature was simple and rustic, yet he had never studied Daoist teachings. In the first year of *Bǎoyòu* (1253), when the tides of Zhèjiāng surged against Jiāntáng, the officials were powerless to stop them. Fàn dreamed that the Immortal of the Teahouse gave him a talisman and incantation, commanding him to subdue the tide. The next morning, he forgot it, but that evening, he dreamed of it again—three nights in total. Finally, he went to the imperial court to confess, and the authorities tested his method. When the tide raged, Fàn hurled the talisman and shouted, and the tide immediately retreated. From then on, the waters caused no more harm. The court appointed him to the Daoist bureaucracy, bestowed gold and silk, which he refused, asking only for exemption from taxes on his hermitage’s fields. At the time, Chancellor Xiè Fāngzú composed the lines *\"With a shout, the river tides retreat—taxes forgiven, returned to the mountain.\"* His return was indeed recorded in the *Shìlù*, and he was widely praised as the *Jīn Zhēnrén*.\n\nYang Zhìyǐn, styled *Kōngjìng*, was a native of Èzhōu. As a child of mere years, he left his family without warning and drifted downriver on a raft to Jiangdong. As he grew older, he became a Daoist at the *Yuánsù Gōng*. He delighted in reading, though his appearance was most unusual. He encountered a strange man who taught him the art of summoning thunder and rain. In the early years of the *Dàyuán*, he used his methods to serve the *Shìzǔ* Emperor. Whenever the emperor inquired of him, his responses were direct and unadorned, never avoiding taboos, and the emperor treated him with favor.\n\nYang Zhìyǐn soon requested leave to return to the mountains, where he was entrusted with a imperial decree to oversee the Daoist teachings of the Sān Máoshān and took up residence at the Guānyuán Guàn. Throughout his life, he would not sleep until he had recited the *Huángtíng Jīng* once through at the stroke of midnight. His white hair, sometimes adorned with multicolored threads tied into small topknots, hung down to his crown. He wandered the mountains and marshes as if no one else were present.\n\nOne night, he ordered those who associated with him to hold a *Língbǎo* fast, then took out all his secret writings and burned them. The next day, he lay down and died.\n\nLín Dàfū, styled *Zǐ Xuān*, who called himself *Mùtōng*, was born in Yǒngjiā, a native of Píngyáng. The *Yùhǎi* Master Jiāng Zōngshī traveled through Jiangdong, and Lín followed him into the mountains. In the *Tizǐ* year of the *Dàyuán* era, Master Jiāng initiated him as a disciple. Lín was fond of wine and unrestrained in his ways, yet though he walked slowly, he moved swiftly. He traveled extensively across the Five Sacred Peaks and other famous mountains, and in his later years, he settled at the *Xuánzhōu* Precious Studio, building an altar and dwelling in a thatched hut.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the second month in the *Wùxū* year of the *Dàdé* era, he bade farewell to all his acquaintances, saying he would depart for the mountains. The next day, seated in his thatched hut, he burned incense and recited the *Dòng Jīng* when suddenly he gave a loud shout and vanished.\n\nThe attendant, startled, looked on and saw him sitting upright in the flames, his voice still reciting the scripture. Soon, there was no trace of his remains—only auspicious clouds remained. This was what is called *huǒjiě* [fire resolution]. The onlookers marveled, and just then, a man named Xuē Dàomín returned from Yángzhōu, claiming to have encountered the master at Guāzhōu. He said the master had appeared and disappeared among people several times before sending a message to the mountains, departing at the age of sixty-one.\n\n(*End of Volume 16 of the Máo Shān Zhì*)\n(*Note: Original text had \"之\" for #1, corrected to \"之\" per the *Dí* edition. #2 was missing \"公\" in the original, added per the *Dí* edition. #3-7 all originally read \"珏,\" corrected to \"公\" per the *Dí* edition.*)\n\n(*Volume 17 of the Máo Shān Zhì*)\n(*The Upper Clarity Lineage Master Liú Dàbīn composed this*)\n\n**Volume 17 of the *Máo Shān Zhì***\n\n**The Upper Clarity Lineage Master Liú Dàbīn composed this**\n\n---\n\n**The Lóuguān Sect’s Scriptures**\n\nThe **Yuánsì Wànníng Gōng** [Palace of Primordial Peace and Universal Tranquility], located at **Jījīn Shān** [Accumulated Gold Mountain], was originally the site of **Táo Yǐnjū** [Master Tao of Seclusion], whose Daoist name was **Dàozhēng**. Above this foundation, **Liú Míngshēng** [Master Liu], with the Daoist name **Hùnkāng**, established his residence.\n\nWhen the master encountered **Zhézōng** [Emperor Philosopher], he was granted favor, and his dwelling was named **Yuánsì Guān** [Primordial Peace Hall]. Its construction was completed in the **Chóngníng** [Venerable Peace] 5th year [1106]. **Huízōng** [Emperor Gaozong] personally inscribed the plaque, which read: **\"Yuánsì Wànníng Gōng\"** [Palace of Primordial Peace and Universal Tranquility]. Additionally, a **Yuánsì Bié Guān** [Separate Hall of Primordial Peace] was built beside the **Shùqīng Chǔxiáng Guān** [Palace of Upper Clarity’s Auspicious Treasures], serving as the master’s residence when he entered the imperial court and took up duties.\n\nToday, the palace retains its original layout: The first ascent to the mountain is marked by the **Tōngxiān Qiáo** [Bridge of Ascending Perfection], which leads directly to the gate of the **Yuánsì Wànníng Guān**. To the left is the **Guān Tīng** [Palace Hall], and to the right, the **Yùshì** [Bathing Chamber]. The second gate is called the **Yùhuá Mén** [Gate of Jade Flower].\n\nThe main hall enshrines the **Sānmáo Zhēnjūn** [Three Teachings of Perfection, i.e., the Three Pure Ones], named **Tiānníng Wànfú Diàn** [Hall of Heavenly Tranquility and Universal Blessings]. To its left is the **Yùcè Diàn** [Hall of Jade Registers], and to its right, the **Jiǔshì Diàn** [Hall of the Nine Auspicious Offerings]. Behind the **Jǐngfú Diàn** [Hall of Auspicious Scenery and Longevity] is the **Mǎjīngfú Wànnián Diàn** [Hall of Auspicious Scenery and Longevity, named \"Sage’s Everlasting Auspiciousness\"]. To the west is the **Yìngfēitiān Fǎshū Diàn** [Hall of the Responsive Celestial Law Transmission], flanked by a **Zhōnglóu** [Bell Tower] to the left and a **Jīnggé** [Scripture Pavilion] to the right.\n\nBehind the **Tiānníng Diàn** [Hall of Heavenly Tranquility] lies the **Dàyǒu Táng** [Hall of Great Possession], followed by the **Bùkù Táng** [Hall of the Treasury] and the **Xīyún Táng** [Hall of Western Clouds]. Beyond the **Xīyún Táng** is the **Bǎolù Diàn** [Hall of Precious Records].\n\nBehind the **Jǐngfú Diàn** [Hall of Auspicious Scenery] is the **Yún Chú** [Cloud Kitchen], and behind the **Dàyǒu Táng** is the **Zhòngmiào Táng** [Hall of Supreme Marvels]. To the left of the **Zhī Guān Wèi** [Office of the Palace Administrator] is the **Sān Sù Táng** [Hall of the Three Unadorned Ones], and to the right, the **Fùzhī Guān Wèi** [Office of the Deputy Palace Administrator] is the **Jiǔzhēn Táng** [Hall of the Nine Perfect Ones].\n\nThe **Běijí Gé** [Pavilion of the Northern Pole] stands behind the **Bǎolù Diàn** [Hall of Precious Records], while the **Zhònglíng Táng** [Hall of Trembling Spirits] is located behind the **Zhòngmiào Táng** [Hall of Supreme Marvels]. There is also the **Gǎngshén Ān** [Hermitage of the Harbor Spirit], situated behind the halls, which was burned by bandits in the **Jiàn’ān** [Rebuilding and Peace] 4th year [1130]. In the **Shàoxīng** [Glory to the Song] year **Wùyín** [1138], **Gāozōng** [Emperor Xiaozong] granted gold for its reconstruction and personally inscribed the palace plaque.\n\nDuring **Lǐzōng**’s reign [1224–1264], the halls underwent repairs, and the emperor inscribed two plaques: **\"Shùqīng Zōngtán\"** [Altar of the Upper Clarity Sect] and **\"Shèngdé Rényòu Diàn\"** [Hall of Sacred Virtue and Benevolent Assistance].\n\nThe **Chóngxǐ Wànshòu Gōng** [Palace of Venerable Longevity and Universal Auspiciousness], located at the **Dīnggōng Shān** [Dinggong Mountain]’s forefront, was originally the site of **Yǐnjū Huáyáng Xiàwǎn** [Master Tao’s Secluded Dwelling in Mount Hua’s Lower Reaches]. In the **Táng Zhēnguān** [Tang Zhenguan] 9th year [635], **Emperor Taizong** [of Tang] built it for **Wáng Fǎzhǔ** [Master Wang, the Law Sovereign], naming it **Tàipíng Guān** [Hall of Great Peace]. In the **Tiānbǎo** [Heavenly Treasure] 7th year [748], **Emperor Xuánzong** [of Tang] forcibly took it from **Lǐ Xuánjìng** [Master Li of Mysterious Tranquility], relocating a hundred households of commoners nearby, exempting them from rent, taxes, and corvée labor, and perpetually assigning them to maintain the hall’s upkeep and cleanliness. During the **Zhōnghé** [Intermediate Harmony] period [881–885], bandits set it ablaze.\n\n「During the **Tiānyòu** [Heavenly Assistance] period, **Dèng Qǐxiá** [Master Deng] rebuilt it. In the **Song** [Song Dynasty], it was renamed **Chóngxǐ Guān** [Hall of Venerable Auspiciousness], but was again destroyed by fire in the **Jiàn’án** [Rebuilt Peace] era.\n\n**Qín Xī** [Master Qin] reconstructed it once more, and **Emperor Ningzong** [of Song] bestowed upon it the names **Gāoshì Yìrú Gāngzhǐ Táng** [Hall of the High Virtue of Just Repose, named after Master Yang] and **Fāngzhàng** [Square Measure], both inscribed by imperial decree. **Emperor Lizong** [of Song] later inscribed the characters **Yùqì Níngrùn** [Jade Qi Congealing] and **Hèqíng Chāoliáo** [Crane Emotion Ascending the Liao], and also bestowed the **Bǎozhū Lín** [Jewel Bamboo Grove] inscription upon **Sìtú Shī Tǎn** [Master Shi Tan of the Temple].\n\nIn the **Dà Yuán** [Great Yuan] [Mongol] period:\nIn the **Yányòu** [延佑] 6th year [1319], it was decreed to change its name to an official title.\n\n**Yùchén Guān** [Jade Dawn Hall], located north of **Léipíng Shān** [Leiping Mountain], was where **Zhǎnshàng Gōng** [Lord of the Upper Court], **Zhōu Yǒu** [Master Zhou], **Guō Sì** [Master Guo of the Four Dynasties], **Jiāng Shūmào** [Lord Jiang, Master Maie of the Chángshāo River], **Yáng Zhēnrén** [Master Yang], **Xǔ Zhǎngshǐ** [Master Xu, the Chief Clerk] and his son attained the **Dao** [Way]. During the **Song Tàishǐ** [Song Taishi] period, the Daoist **Wáng Jǔ** [Master Wang] was highly regarded by **Jǐngwáng Yǎ** [Prince Jing of Chángshā, the Wise], and thus established the **Chángshāo** [Long Shao] retreat in the residence of the Chief Clerk.\n\nIn the **Liáng Tiānjiàn** [Liang Tianjian] 13th year [514], it was decreed to move it to **Júyáng** [Juyang] and name it **Júyáng** [Juyang] retreat, where **Táo Zhēnrén** [Master Tao] resided. A **Zhāozhēn Tái** [Platform of Illustrious Virtue] was erected to enshrine the true traces, scriptures, and edicts of **Yáng, Xǔ** [Masters Yang and Xu], and the three **Zhēnrén** [True Persons].\n\nIn the **Táng** [Tang Dynasty], **Emperor Taizong** [of Tang] built the **Huáyáng Guān** [Hua yang Hall] for **Tóngwú Xiansheng** [Master Mr. Tong of the Willow Grove]. In the **Tiānbǎo** [Heavenly Treasure] 7th year [748], **Emperor Xuánzong** [of Tang] decreed to change it into **Zǐyáng Guān** [Purple Yang Hall] for **Xuánjìng Xiansheng** [Master Mr. Xuán of Mysterious Tranquility]. It was then decreed to take two hundred households of nearby commoners, exempting them from rent and corvée labor, and permanently assigning them to maintain the hall’s upkeep and protection. **Wáng Zhēnshù** [Master Wang of the Pure and Substantial] of **Nán Táng** [Southern Tang] later resided there.\n\nIn the **Song Dàzhōng Xiángfú** [Song Dazhong Xiangfu] 1st year [1008], it was renamed **Yùchén Guān** [Jade Dawn Hall]. **Dìnglù Jūn** [Lord Dinglu] said: \"This is the land marked for a tranquil retreat, the very site where the **Xuánjìng** [Mysterious Tranquility] retreat once stood. If it were not for the **Xuánjìng Xiansheng** [Master Xu of Mysterious Tranquility] and his son, how could this place have been preserved?\" He added, \"Future generations will have virtuous descendants who will reside here—this is indeed a blessed land.\" He further declared, \"This is the very auspicious land of **Jīnlíng** [Jinling].\"\n\n**Chóngshòu Guān** [Hall of Venerable Longevity], located beneath **Dà Máocāng Shān** [Great Teased Mountain], south of **Huáyáng Dòng** [Hua yang Cave], and before the **Biànmén** [Convenient Gate], was the former residence of **Jìn Zhēnrén Rén Dūn** [Master Ren Dun of the Jin Dynasty]. In the **Song Yuánjiā** [Song Yuanjia] 11th year [434], **Lù Tàihòu** [Lady Lu] began constructing the hall. During the **Tàishǐ** [Taishi] period, **Kǒng Suìzhī** [Master Kong of the Lu country], the governor of **Lúlíng** [Luling], rebuilt it, and provided sustenance for the Daoist **Huà Wénxián** [Master Hua of the Wen clan, the Virtuous and Exalted] from **Qǔ’ē** [Master Qu of the E clan].\n\nIn the **Qí Jiànyuán** [Qi Jianyuan] 2nd year [478], it was decreed to establish the **Chóngyuán** [Venerable Source] retreat, with the **Tàizǐ** [Crown Prince] and **Emperor Wǔdì** [of Qi] visiting in person. **Wáng Wénqīng** [Master Wang of the Pure and Clear], the host, arranged the halls and chambers, which were most fitting and harmonious.\n\nIn the early years of the **Táng** [Tang Dynasty], **Zhēnguān** [Zhenguan], it was renamed **Chóngyuán Guān** [Hall of Venerable Source]. In the **Tiānbǎo** [Heavenly Treasure] 7th year [748], **Xuánjìng Xiansheng** [Master Xuán of Mysterious Tranquility] urged its reconstruction, and again took one hundred households of nearby commoners, exempting them from rent and corvée labor, and permanently assigning them to maintain and protect the hall. In the **Song Dàzhōng Xiángfú** [Song Dazhong Xiangfu] 7th year [1014], it was decreed to bestow its current name.\n\n**Dìnglù Jūn** [Lord Dinglu] said: \"Even beneath **Dà Máocāng Shān** [Great Teased Mountain], there is a spring, and beneath it, one may establish a tranquil retreat. Near the spring’s mouth is where one should reside.\" **Yǐnjū** [Master Tao] noted, \"In the present age, there are those who reside near the southern entrance of **Dàdòng** [Great Cave], where the water flows well but is rocky. The terrain quickly becomes level, and this has been the case for generations.\"\n\nIn the early years of the **Qí** [Qi Dynasty], **Wáng Wénqīng** [Master Wang of the Pure and Clear], a man from **Jùróng** [Master Ju of the Rong clan], established a retreat here, naming it **Chóngyuán** [Venerable Source], which is this very hall. There is a stele from the **Táng Tàijí** [Tang Taiji] 1st year [617], inscribed by **Zhuōyú Sūn Chǔxuán** [Mr. Sun of the Zhuo clan, the Left Censor], with **Yáng Yōu** [Master Yang] writing the **Jīng** [Scripture] and the remaining characters indistinct and unrecognizable. In the **Yuán Táidìng** [Yuan Taiding] 1st year [1324], **Yùjí** [Master Yu], the director of the **Guózǐ** [National Students], rewrote the inscription, which was carved in regular script on the reverse side of the **Tàijí** [Taiji] stele.\n\n**Xiàpō Guōng** [Retreat of the Lower Bank], located west of **Zhōng Máocāng** [Middle Teased Mountain], was where **Dà Sīmìng Jūn** [Lord of the Great Command] ascended from **Xiànyáng** [Xianyang] during the **Hàn Dì Jiē** [Han Di Jie] 3rd year [230] to meet his two younger brothers, **Chǔ** [Master Chu] and **Yǔ** [Master Yu]. **Yǐnjū** [Master Tao] noted, \"The elders of the region passed down the tale that in the northwest level ground of **Dà Máocāng Shān** [Great Teased Mountain], among the **tánglǐ** [Tangli] trees, there was a place named **Xiàpō Chù** [Lower Bank Dwelling], which was said to be the former residence of the **Sīmìng Jūn** [Lord of the Command].\"\n\nIn the **Táng Zhēnguān** [Tang Zhenguan] 11th year [637], a stele was rebuilt there, inscribed by **Huáng Xiansheng** [Master Huang] of **Táoyuán** [Peach Grove] and calligraphied by **Lú Shǐjūn** [Master Lu, the Official] of **Hézhōu** [Hezhou]. The current inscription is not the original; it was written by **Wáng Gōng Wěi** [Master Wang, the Duke], who once served as the **Táng Yùshì Dàfū** [Tang Grand Master of the Palace], and this is the record of his work.»\n\nThe **Huáyáng Gōng** [Huayang Palace] stands on the western slope of **Jījīn Shān** [Accumulated Gold Mountain]. The **Yǐnjū Shàngguǎn** [Secluded Upper Hall] was where, in the seventh month of the **Tiānbǎo** [Sky Treasure] 7th year [748], Emperor Xuánzōng received the *Shàngqīng Jīnglù* [Upper Clarity Scripture Record] from Master Xuánjìng and encouraged Daoist priests to burn incense in devotion. The hall was later destroyed by war. During the **Sòng Zhènghé** [Song Zhenghe] era, Daoist **Zhuāngshènzhì** [Solemn and Reverent] rebuilt it. The **Yǐnjū Dānjǐng** [Secluded Dan Well] and **lóujī** [pavilion foundations] remain there.\n\nThe **Quányuán Guàn** [Complete Record Hall] bears this inscription from **Dìnglù Jūn** [Lord of the Record], who said: Beneath **Dàhéng Shān** [Great Horizontal Mountain] lies a spring. Long ago, **Lǐ Míng** [Master Li] refined immortal elixir here and ascended to **Xuánzhōu** [Mysterious Isle]. In the **Tiānjiàn** [Heavenly Governance] 14th year [423], the recluse **Bìyù Gāng** [Obsidian Jade Ridge] built a retreat to follow the traces of Xuánzhou. During the **Tiānbǎo** era, Master Xuánjìng resided there, erecting the **Qízhen Táng** [Abiding-in-Truth Hall] and five pavilions: **Huìzhēn** [Gathering Truth], **Hòuxiān** [Awaiting Immortality], **Dàodé** [Dao Virtue], **Yíng’ēn** [Receiving Grace], and **Bàibiǎo** [Kneeling in Reverence]. In the **Dàzhōng Xiángfú** [Great Harmony Auspicious] 2nd year [1014], Master Guànmiào constructed a nine-tiered platform for Dao practice. In the **Tiānsèng** [Heavenly Veneration] 3rd year [1025], it was renamed **Jíxū’ān** [Gathering Void Hermitage], later restored to its current name.\n\nThe **Yàn Dòng Gōng** [Swallow Cave Palace] is at **Yànkǒu Dòng** [Swallow Mouth Cave]. A female immortal, **Qián Miàozhēn** [Money Miao True], vanished here, and a shrine was erected in her honor. A stele by **Liáng Shàolíng Wáng** [Liang Prince of Shaoling] no longer exists. In **Tiānbǎo** 7th year [748], the palace was granted its name, and three female Daoists were ordained to tend the incense. In **Yuányòu Jiǎchén** [Elemental Revival, Year of the Dragon] [1084], it was burned by wildfires and relocated to **Jùróng Xiàn** [Jurong County]. In **Shàoxīng** [Sovereign Peace] 20th year [1150], it was rebuilt on its original site in the west of **Zhōngmáo** [Central Teased], adjacent to the **Hèmiào** [Crane Temple].\n\nIn **Tiānbǎo** 7th year [748], a **jìngshè** [pure dwelling] was established beneath the temple, where Daoists were ordained and incense burned in honor of the **Sānmáo Jūn** [Three Teased Lords] and the Daoist patriarchs. A stele by **Túntián Yuànwàiláng Liù Shí** [Grain Field Outer Official Liu Shi] is now lost.\n\nThe **Huáyáng Guàn** [Huayang Hall] was the former residence of the **Liáng Zhāomíng Tàizǐ** [Liang Prince of Illuminating Clarity], once called **Hóngxǐ Yuàn** [Auspicious Felicity Hall] and **Fúxiāng Guǎn** [Felicity Village Lodge], located west of **Chóngshòu Guàn** [Longevity Nurturing Hall]. In the **Bǎolì** [Treasure History] 2nd year [826], it was granted imperial patronage and renamed **Bǎolì Chóngyuán Shèngzǔ Yuàn** [Treasure History Nurturing Origin Sacred Ancestor Hall]. At the time, **Zànhuáng Lǐ Déyù** [Li Deyu of Zhanhuang] enshrined statues of **Lǎozǐ** [Old Master], **Kǒngzǐ** [Confucius], and **Yín Zhēnrén** [Immortal Yin], and venerated **Tàixuān Zhōu Shī** [Master Zhou of Supreme Mystery] here. During the **Zhìpíng** [Political Peace] era, it was renamed **Hóngxǐ Guàn** [Auspicious Felicity Hall]. In **Xuānhé** [Extended Harmony], it received its current name.\n\nThe **Tiānsèng Guàn** [Heavenly Veneration Hall] is atop **Jījīn Shān** [Accumulated Gold Mountain]. In the early **Tiānjiàn** [Heavenly Governance] era, the recluse **Bì** [Obsidian] cultivated at **Xiǎozhǎo** [Small Marsh], nurturing a dragon child in the **Léipíng Chí** [Thunder Calm Pool]. During the **Zhēnguān** [Zhenguan] era, **Wáng Fǎzhǔ** [Master Wang, the Law Holder] resided here and encountered the immortal **Fǎběn Xiānrén** [Master Faben]. In the **Sùzōng Zhìdé** [Suzong Rectified Virtue] era, it was granted the name **Huǒyuàn Gōng** [Fire Hall Palace]. By the end of the Tang, it fell into ruin. In **Jìngdé** [Jingde] 3rd year [1006], Master **Míngzhēn Zhāng Shàoyīng** [Illuminating Truth Zhang Shaoying] rebuilt it. Mingzhen, along with **Zhū Guànmiào** [Master Zhu of Illuminating Mystery], were the two transmitters of the **Míngsù Tàihòu** [Illuminating Lineage Grand Empress]. In the 9th month of **Tiānsèng** 3rd year [1025], his residence was granted the name **Yánzhēn’ān** [Extending Truth Hermitage], and in the 5th year [1027], it was renamed **Qízhen Guàn** [Abiding-in-Truth Hall], located west of **Huáyáng Gōng** [Huayang Palace].\n\nThe **Yǐnjū Zhōngguǎn** [Secluded Middle Hall] was the residence of **Huáyuán Huáng Zūnshī** [Revered Master Huang of Peach Grove], with a stele inscribed by **Hézhōu Lú Shìmóu** [Lu Simou of Hezhou], now lost. During the **Xuānhé** era, it was granted its name.\n\nThe **Wǔyún Guàn** [Five Clouds Hall] is beneath **Wǔyún Fēng** [Five Cloud Peak]. Built during the **Tiānsèng** era, it was later granted its name after **Chéngxiàng Wáng Gōng Qǐnrú** [Chancellor Wang Qinru] passed away. **Xǔ Guó Fūrén** [Lady Xu of the State] petitioned the court to establish it as his resting place, and **Yàn Yuánxiàn Gōng** [Yan Yuanxian, Duke of Yuan] inscribed the stele.\n\nThe **Qīngzhēn Guàn** [Pure Truth Hall] is at **Dàluó Yuán** [Great Luo Spring]. During the **Zhènghé** era, the Daoist **Hàodé Qīng** [Virtuous Virtue Qing] built a hermitage to welcome wandering Daoists. Emperor **Huízōng** granted it the name **Guàn** [Hall]. Every year on the 18th day of the 3rd month, Daoists from afar gather to pay homage to the **Máo Jūn** [Teased Lord]. During the rituals, white cranes often soar overhead, giving rise to the legend of the **Hèhuì** [Crane Assembly].\n\nThe **Bái’yún Chóngfú Guàn** [White Cloud Nurturing Virtue Hall] is beneath **Bái’yún Fēng** [White Cloud Peak]. **Bìyáng Gōng Zhīgōng Wáng Jǐngwēn** [Palace Official Wang Jingwen of Biyang] retired here. Jingwen gained renown at the **Déshòu Gōng** [Longevity Nurturing Palace], and the hall was granted its name. He was later promoted through Daoist ranks, serving four successive courts. During the reign of **Níngzōng’s** [Ningzong] grandson, he received ordination and, upon ascending the throne, was granted the title **Xūjìng Zhēnrén** [Void Stillness Immortal]. **Dài Xī Xuéshì** [Scholar Dai of Dai Stream] composed the hall’s record.\n\nThe **Níngshén’ān** [Concentrated Spirit Hermitage] is in **Hēihǔ Gǔ** [Black Tiger Valley]. In **Shàoxīng Gēngwǔ** [Sovereign Peace, Year of the Monkey] [1140], the shrine and Daoist priests were rebuilt by **Zhāng Zhànglíng** [Zhang Zhangling], formerly named **Féngdào** [Encountering Dao]. Emperor **Gāozōng** annually sent envoys to offer incense in the mountains. In the **Yǐhài** year [1149], Zhang’s Daoist name reached the emperor, and he was repeatedly summoned to the **Déshòu Diàn** [Longevity Nurturing Hall], receiving gifts of a **móxiù bèi** [embroidered robe], **shuǐjīng huán** [jade ring], **zǐshí chá** [purple stone mortar], imperial calligraphy of the **Yīnfú** [Dark Secret] and **Qīngjìng** [Pure Stillness] scriptures, and an order to have his likeness painted in the **Shénxiān Gé** [Immortal Gallery].\n\nThe **Shēngyuán Guàn** [Ascending Source Hall], formerly the **Báiè Miào** [White Crane Temple], is a dedicated shrine to **Sīmìng Zhēnjūn** [True Lord of Command], located west of **Zhōngmáo** [Central Teased]. During the **Tiānbǎo** era, its halls were repaired, Daoists were ordained, and incense burned in accordance with the **Qǐdiǎn** [Sacrificial Rites]. In **Zhènghé** 8th year [1118], the governor of **Jiànkāng** [Jiankang], **Yú Zhuō** [Yu Zhuo], petitioned for its current name. In **Jiànyán** 3rd year [1129], it was burned by bandits. In **Shàoxīng** 14th year [1144], the Daoist **Máo Zōngbái** [Mao Zongbai] rebuilt it south of its original site.\n\n「Liu Zhìxiào [Liu Zhi Xiao] three times encountered the spirit peach tree at its place, the events recorded in the *Cǎizhēn Yóu* [Adventures of the Transcendent Sage]. The **Bàoyuán Guàn** [Embracing the Source Hall], located above the **Liǔjì Quán** [Willow Rescue Spring], was in the **Zhènghé** 8th year [1118] when **Chén Xīwēi** [Chen Xiwei] of **Gūsū** [Gusu] followed **Liu Xiānsheng** [Master Liu] in Daoist practice and resided there. Later, the **Liǔgǔ Àn** [Willow Valley Hermitage] urged its transformation into a hall.\n\nThe **Yuányáng Guàn** [Primordial Sun Hall], an ancient hall, appears in **Gù Kuàng** [Gu Kuang]'s poetry:\n*\"For ten years I’ve wandered this hall,\nFor a thousand miles I’ve lodged in this room.\nReturning to the old window below,\nI take your verse again to read.\"*\n\nThe current hall stands above **Máo Dòng** [Mao Cave]. At the beginning of the **Lóngxīng** era [1163], the Daoist **Hàoxīng Dàorén** [Shen Shen of Bright Dawn], **Shěn Shànzhì** [Shen Shanzhi], dwelled in a cave, calling himself the **Dòngzhǔ** [Cave Master]. He met **Xīn Wáng** [Fire King] **Hán Fūrén** [Lady Han], who commissioned him to construct the hall’s buildings. Initially named **Chōngxū Àn** [Piercing the Void Hermitage], its name was later changed to **Guàn** [Hall] during the **Qìngyuán** era [1195–1200].\n\nThe **Cángzhēn Guàn** [Treasure of the True Hall], a serene shrine to **Jìngyī Liú Zōngshī** [Master Liu of Pure Unity], is located at **Diéyù Fēng** [Stacked Jade Peak]. In the **Dàguān** [Great Hall] era, its construction was completed.\n\nThe **Zǐyáng Guàn** [Purple Yang Hall], formerly known as **Dòngyún Àn** [Cave Cloud Hermitage], was during the **Jiànyán** era [1127–1130] when a Daoist from **Bó Zhōu** [Bo Prefecture] in **Héběi** [Northern Rivers], **Wáng Ruòníng** [Wang Ruoning], came to the mountains and lived alone beneath the **Dīnggōng Shān** [Ding Gong Mountain] **Shùyán** [Bundle Rock]. One night, he dreamed of a divine person pointing to a cave and saying: *\"This is the place where the spirits of Dengzhou [a netherworldly region] interrogate the dead. You may dwell here, a hundred paces from the cave.\"* Upon **Qín Qiè** [Qin Qie]'s demise, **Fūrén Wáng Shì** [Lady Wang], a woman of pure virtue, visited **Jìngzhēn** [Settled Sage] **Liú Zōngshī** [Master Liu] and begged for a written petition, learning that **Qín Qiè** was imprisoned within **Dēngshān** [Deng Mountain]. **Wáng** [Wang] then ordered his son to build a **Tàiyǐ Diàn** [Great Unity Hall] at the cave’s entrance to seek a posthumous pardon. The **mò** [incense burner] and **shí** [stone tablet] he offered remain preserved there.\n\nIn the **Dà Yuán** [Great Yuan] **Tìyuán** era [1264–1294], specifically the **Gǔwǔ** year [1273], an imperial decree established it as a **Guàn** [Hall], retaining its ancient name.»\n\n「The **Chóngyuán Guàn** [Hall of Exalted Benevolence], at the end of the **Shàoxīng** era [1131–1162], was founded by **Shí Xiānsheng** [Master Shi] of **Tóngchuān** [Tongchuan], named **Yuánpǔ** [Original Simplicity], who studied the **Dao** from **Yáng Yíjiǎ** [Yang Yijia]. He resided at the **Chángníng** [Constant Peace] **Yǎn** [Hermitage] on the southern slope of **Nánzhèn** [Southern Garrison], practicing medicine to benefit others. Daily, he would recognize one **cǎo lǚ** [straw sandal] and ten coins from passersby, hanging them on a tree outside his door so that travelers might take them freely, regardless of season. He lived to eighty-eight years old and departed without illness.\n\n**Liú Zhài** [Master Liu] of **Màntáng** [Mantang] composed a eulogy for him.\n\nIn the **Dà Yuán** [Great Yuan] **Yuanfù** era [1294–1307], specifically the **Bīngzǐ** year [1306], an imperial decree granted the hall its ancient name, and his disciples thereafter maintained the **yàoshì** [pharmacy hall].\n\nThe **Shèngyòu Guàn** [Hall of Sacred Benevolence] stands atop **Dàmáo Shān** [Great Mao Mountain]. In the **Yányòu** era [1201–1208], particularly the **Sānnián** [Third Year, 1205], an imperial edict bestowed its name and elevated its seal to **Dàjūn Zhēnyìng Zhēnjūn** [Great Lord, Manifest Response, True Lord].\n\nThe **Déyòu Guàn** [Hall of Virtuous Benevolence] is atop **Zhōngmáo Shān** [Middle Mao Mountain]. As above, an imperial edict granted its name and elevated its seal to **Zhōngjūn Miàoyìng Zhēnjūn** [Middle Lord, Marvelous Response, True Lord].\n\nThe **Rényòu Guàn** [Hall of Benevolent Grace] is atop **Xiǎomáo Shān** [Lesser Mao Mountain]. As above, an imperial edict granted its name and elevated its seal to **Xiǎojūn Shényìng Zhēnjūn** [Lesser Lord, Divine Response, True Lord].\n\nThe *Tàiyuān Nèichuán* [Inner Transmission of the Great Yuan] records that in the **Yǒngmíng** era [58–75] of the **Hàn** [Han] **Míngdì** [Emperor Ming], the **Jìng** [Effort] **Jùn** [District] **Xiàn** [County] constructed a temple for the **Jūqū** [Jucur] **Zhēnrén** [True Person] of **Dānyáng** [Danyang]. *Yǐnjū* [Hidden Residence] states: \"This temple still exists today.\" The villages of **Shūmóu** [Shumou] and **Liúxī** [Liuxi], along with others, each built their own temples. The **Hàoxū** [Hao Xu] Temple was located on the western side of **Dàmáo** [Great Mao], and the **Shùxū** [Shu Xu] Temple stood below the rear mountain of **Zhōngmáo** [Middle Mao]; both are now abandoned.\n\nOnly the **Shēngyuán Guàn** [Hall of Ascended Benevolence], originally named **Hèmiào** [Crane Temple], resides above the **cíyǔ** [ancestral hall], at **Shàoxīng** [Shaoxing] **Wèn** [Question], when it was rebuilt by imperial decree. A radiant **Dān** [Dan] light appeared at its foundation.\n\nThe **Dàoshì** [Daoist] **Lǚ Yún** [Lu Yun] inscribed its records, though they are now lost.\n\nThe **Guǎngjì** [Broad Benevolence] Temple, also known as **Tiānshèng Guàn** [Hall of Heavenly Saint] and **Lóngcí** [Dragon Shrine], was renamed in the **Shàoxīng** era [1131–1162] with the titles **Chúnxī** [Pure Heir] and **Chúnyòu** [Pure Benevolence], and three times elevated the **Shénlóng** [Divine Dragon] to **Fūzé Guǎngyìng Lìjì Zhēnjūn** [Benevolent Sower, Broad Response, Graceful Aid, True Lord].\n\nThe **Yuánfú** [Yuanfu] Temple and **Yuánfú Gōng** [Yuanfu Palace] were established in the **Yuánfú** era [1098–1100], with the **Shén** [Divine] **Yuánfú** [Yuanfu] enshrined as **Hùshèng Zhēnjūn** [True Lord, Protective Benevolence], and the **Yuánfú Gōng** [Yuanfu Palace] **Èrshǐzhě** [Two Envoys] enshrined as **Língyòu Línghù Zhēnjūn** [True Lord, Spiritual Aid, Soul Protector]. The records are detailed in the *Sòngshǐ* [History of Song].\n\nThe **Máo Shìtú Mìào** [Temple of Mao, the Grand Marshal] is located within the **Qiányuán Guàn** [Hall of Primordial Benevolence]. It faces the **Jiāngbā Lù** [Jiangba Road] to the south. In ancient times, a man suffering from illness lay at the roadside. In the dead of night, a guide arrived on horseback, demanding his name. The man confessed his ailment, and the horseman gave him a pill, saying: \"I am **Máo Shìtú** [Mao, the Grand Marshal].\" By dawn, his illness was cured, and he built a temple at the site. The account is found in *Qǐshén Lù* [Records of Divine Inquiry].\n\nThere is also a shrine one *lǐ* [li] outside the **Shūmén** [Shumen] gate of **Jiànkāng** [Jiankang, modern Nanjing].\n\nThe *Máoshān Zhì* [Gazetteer of Maoshan], **Juàn** [Volume] **Shíqī** [Seventeenth], concludes with the note: \"The previous text has 『Féng』 [Encounter] instead of 『Dá』 [Reach].\"\n\nThe *Máoshān Zhì*, **Juàn** [Volume] **Shíbā** [Eighteenth], records the **Shòuqīng** [Successive Sage] **Zhēnjūnshī** [Master of the True Lord] **Liú Dàbīn** [Liu Dabin] constructing the **Shàngqīng** [Upper Clarity] Temple.»\n\nThe **Lóuguān** [Louguan] section—**Mountain Lodges and Hermitages**\n\nThe **Xù Chángshǐ** [Xu Changshi’s] residence, now **Yùchén Guān** [Yuchen Observatory]. The *Yǐnjū* [Hidden Residence] states: *\"After Xu Changshi’s residence fell into ruin, no one knew its location.\"* During the reign of **Jìngwáng** [King Jing] of **Chángshā** [Changsha], **Tántàifēi** [Tan Taifei, the dowager] sponsored the Daoist **Chén** [Chen], who established a response at **Léipíng** [Leiping]’s northwest—this was also where **Běichá** [North察] was located. Later, **Wénqīng** [Wenqing] **Wáng** [Wang] of **Jùróng** [Jurong] became the patron of those afflicted with **xiàn** [癣, ringworm], as recorded in his biography. It was known that Xu Changshi had settled here, and through inquiries among the elders, by the **Dàmíng** [Daming] era of the seventh year (1423), an old villager named **Xúǒu** [Xu Ou] recalled that his ancestors had served Xu Changshi and knew of this residence. I have also seen the **Chángshǐ jǐng** [Changshi’s well] within.\n\nThe **Língbǎo Yuàn** [Lingbao Abbey], located at the former site of **Yǐnjū Zhāozhēn Tái** [Hidden Residence’s Zhaozhen Terrace] beneath **Yùchén Guān** [Yuchen Observatory]. During the **Táng** [Tang], the masters **Sūn Zhìqīng** [Sun Zhiqing] and **Wáng Qíxiá** [Wang Qixia] rebuilt it, enshrining the image of the **Língbǎo Tiānzūn** [Lingbao Heavenly Venerable]. The plaque reads *\"Língbǎo\"* [Lingbao]. Within, there is also an ancient **Lǎojūn** [Laojun, Laozi] image of divine auspice. Originally erected by **Xuánjìng Xiānshēng** [Xuanjing Master], during the **Gāozǔ** [High Ancestor, Emperor Taizong of Song]’s reign, **Lǎojūn** [Laojun] repeatedly descended upon **Yángjiǎo Shān** [Yangjiao Mountain] in **Jìnzhōu** [Jinzhou]. A request was made to enshrine his image, and in the **Dàguān** [Daguan] era, fourth month of the third year (1109), **Liáng Wùzhēn** [Liang Wuzhen], a Daoist of **Yùchén** [Yuchen], drew water from the **Zhōuzhēn rén chí** [Zhouzhen Person’s Pond] before the hall—this was the **Zhōu Zhēnrén** [Zhou Zhenren’s] pond. Suddenly, a **zǐyīn** [紫姻, purple mist] enveloped him, and within it, he saw **Lǎojūn** [Laojun] riding a white horse, bestowing upon him the *Tiāndóng Jīng* [Tiantong Scripture]. Liang, though simple and unlearned, thereafter neither ate nor recited scriptures, and his words on others’ fortunes and misfortunes proved accurate. The *Tiāndóng Jīng* [Tiantong Scripture] was later inscribed on stone and transmitted.\n\nThe **Ruòshān Àn** [Ruoshan Hermitage], located east of **Guō Gāntáng** [Guo Gantang]. **Ruòshān** [Ruoshan] was, during the **Kāiyuán** [Kaiyuan] era of the **Táng** [Tang], the **Rùnzhōu** [Runzhou] prefect, who abandoned office and came to the mountain, later residing at **Tàihú Bāoshān** [Taihu Baoshan]. Today, a ruined stele remains in the forest.\n\nThe **Yóuzūn Shī Àn** [Youzun Master’s Hermitage], located south of **Bāguà Tái** [Bagua Terrace], a few dozen steps away. The master’s name is unknown, nor is it known when he resided here. Layered tiles formed its walls, and a stone mortar was carved from rock—its space barely exceeding a *zhàng* [丈, ~3 meters] in length and width. The remnants of his **áo** [鳌, turtle] still linger, long obscured by overgrowth. During the **Shàoxīng** [Shaoxing] era of **Chén Shàngshū** [Chen Shangshu], the hermitage was rebuilt, revealing it once more.\n\n**Gù Zhùzuò Shānfáng** [Gu Zuzuo’s Mountain Lodge], situated atop **Jǔpú Tán** [Jupu Pond]’s **Shímò Chí** [Stone Ink Pool]. **Gù Qiào** [Gu Qiao], who styled himself **Huàyáng Zhēnyì** [Huayang True Hermit], was the author of the *Jiāoshān Zuòhè Míng* [Seat Crane Inscription of Jiaoshan]. Qiao served as **Kànqiú Guān** [Kanqiu Official] under **Hán Qiào** [Han Qiao], later holding posts as **Jiāngnán Jùnshèng** [Jiangnan Circuit Inspector], **Jiàoshū Láng** [Jiaoshu Clerk], and **Zhuózùo Láng** [Zhuozuo Clerk]. After years of neglect, he abandoned worldly affairs and built a dwelling in the mountains. His son, **Fēixióng** [Feixiong], passed the **Jìnshì** [Jinshi, advanced scholar] examination and successively served in various prefectural offices. During the **Dàzhōng** [Dazhong] era, he held the post of **Yùyí Bùmù** [Yuyi Bureau Clerk].\n\nThe **Qín Xì Shānfáng** [Qin Xi’s Mountain Lodge], located beside **Shímò Chí** [Stone Ink Pool]. According to the *Yúdì Xún* [Yudi Seeking], **Qín Xì** [Qin Xi], a **Táng** [Tang] scholar, carved a **yàn** [研, inkstone] from stone to annotate the *Dàodé Jīng* [Dao De Jing]. The *Yǐnyì Zhuàn* [Hidden Retirees’ Biography] also records him as a native of **Kuàijī** [Kuaiji, modern Shaoxing], skilled in poetry. **Quán Déyǔ** [Quan Deyu] remarked: *\"Liú Zhǎngqīng* [Liu Zhangqing] called himself the ‘long wall of *wǔyán* [五言, quintain verse],’ and I, with my inferior forces, though aged, still press onward.\"* During the **Sòng** [Song], **Qíqiū Shānfáng** [Qiqiu Mountain Lodge] was built atop **Hǎiyǎn Quán** [Haiyan Spring]. The lodges of **Zhèng Shàngshū** [Zheng Shangshu], **Péi Tàishī** [Pei Taishi], and **Yáng Shàngshū** [Yang Shangshu] were also near **Hǎiyǎn Quán** [Haiyan Spring]. The lodges of **Zhào Shūjì** [Zhao Shuji], **Yáng Shìláng** [Yang Shilang], and **Zhōu Shìláng** [Zhou Shilang] were all in the southwest of **Zhōng Máo** [Zhong Mao]. The lodges of **Lǐ Shìláng** [Li Shilang] and **Gāo Jiàoshū** [Gao Jiaoshu] were at **Wúzhī Lǒng** [Wuzhi Ridge]. The lodges of **Liú Shìláng** [Liu Shilang] and **Péi Shìláng** [Pei Shilang] were before **Zhōng Máo** [Zhong Mao]. The lodges of **Léi Lángzhōng** [Lei Langzhong], **Zhāng Shíyú** [Zhang Shiyu], and **Hé Xiānshēng** [He Xiansheng] were on **Lóngwěi Shān** [Longwei Mountain]. The lodges of **Cuī Zhēngjūn** [Cui Zhengjun], **Yuàn Liànshī** [Yuan Lianshi], and **Wáng Liànshī** [Wang Lianshi] were on **Léipíng Shān** [Leiping Mountain]. **Cuī Dìngyán** [Cui Dingyan] composed emotional verse. The lodges of **Dòu Liànshī** [Dou Lianshi], **Hóu Xiāngū** [Hou Xiangu], **Yán Liànshī** [Yan Lianshi], **Táng Liànshī** [Tang Lianshi], and **Jīnshān Rén** [Jinshan Person] were in **Nán Dòng** [Nan Dong].\n\nThe **Sòng Zhāng Wénjiǎn Gōng Shānfáng** [Zhang Wenjian Gong’s Mountain Lodge], located in the **Shēnxiù Xuān** [Shenxiu Pavilion] of **Huàyáng Gōng** [Huayang Palace]. The master’s name was **Gāng** [Gang], who served as **Cánzhī Zhèngshì** [Chanzhi Chancellor] during the **Shàoxīng** [Shaoxing] era. He read in the mountains and compiled the *Huàyáng Lǎorén Jí* [Huayang Laoren Collection] in forty volumes.\n\nThe **Qíyún Àn** [Qiyun Hermitage], located in **Zhōng Máo** [Zhong Mao], west of **Xiǎo Máo** [Xiao Mao] and above **Yùshā Quán** [Yusha Spring], was the residence of **Liú Shāyī Xiānshēng** [Liu Shayi Master].\n\nThe **Tiānxìn Àn** [Tianxin Hermitage], located beneath **Sōulún Fēng** [Soulun Peak], was the residence of **Yáng Zhíjiǎ Xiānshēng** [Yang Zhiya Master].\n\nThe **Dòngyáng Guàn** [Dongyang Pavilion], located west of **Huàyáng Guān** [Huayang Observatory] in **Nán Dòng** [Nan Dong]. During the **Zhènghé** [Zhenghe] era, it was rebuilt by **Yánkāng Dàxiànshì Wáng Gōng Hàn** [Yankang Grand Academy Master Wang Gong Han], who sponsored the recluse **Shěn Zǐzhōu** [Shen Zizhou] and refined elixirs there.\n\nThe **Yuánxǐ Àn** [Yuanxi Hermitage], established during the **Shàoxīng** [Shaoxing] era by the **Pílíng** [Piling] Daoist **Yú Huìcōng** [Yu Huicong]. Huicong practiced **péngtóu kǔxíng** [蓬头苦行, ascetic austerity], first dwelling at **Dàluó Yuán** [Daluo Spring], weaving two **cǎoxié** [草屦, straw sandals] daily to exchange for grain. Each evening, he knelt in prayer to the **Dòu** [斗, Big Dipper].\n\nA certain night, he was moved by a black tiger lying at his side. Emperor Gaozong, hearing of his fame, summoned him to the De Shou Palace, bestowing upon him abstinence rice and saying, *\"This rustic has no use—let him remain for military provisions.\"* The emperor smiled and released him back to the mountains, whereupon he relocated to the front of Longwei Mountain.\n\n**East Tianning Temple**, located in Danyang County, Zhenjiang.\n**West Tianning Temple**, located in Jurong County, Jiankang—both part of the Yuanfu Estate, granted the name by imperial decree in the fifth year of Chongning.\n\n**Qi Bai An**, built by the scholar-official Qin Qiao of Huawen Ge, overseen by Zhang Dongyuan during the Yuanfu era, situated on Dinggong Mountain, where the cliffs are exquisitely steep.\n\n**Xuanzhou Jing She**, atop Hetai Ravine. In the Zhiyuan era of the Great Yuan, established by Master Jiang Zongshi of Yuhai. The hall still stands on Yugang Ridge, an ancient name.\n\nIn the **Rénshù** year of **Zhìzhèng** (1323), Master Liu Zongshi requested permission to establish a retreat and built **Wàijìng** at the site where the Purple Pavilion Immortal’s fire was extinguished.\n\n**Huayang Dao Yuan**, on the bundle of Jijin Mountain. Built by Master Wang Zongshi of Mu Chai during the Dade era.

The two lords (二君) once saw a Daoist who had achieved union with the immortals (合仙者), and they also gave these herbs to him.\n\nThe method for obtaining the herbs requires ascending the mountain on the **opening days** (开日) of the **third** or **ninth month**, carrying **two golden rings** (金环), and offering them with a solemn oath. The two lords did this three times as a pledge of sincerity, casting the rings onto the stones and not looking back. The immortals value **green rings** (青环) as tokens of trust.\n\nThe **first herb, Lóngxiān Zhī** (Dragon Immortal Herb), resembles the intertwined form of two dragons, with its leaves as scales and its roots coiled like a dragon.\n\nThe **second herb, Cānhéng Zhī** (Dragon’s Back Herb), is vermilion in color, with a radiant luster. When struck, its trunk and leaves emit a sound like metal or stone, and if broken, it can be rejoined seamlessly.\n\nThe **third herb, Yàntāi Zhī** (Swallow’s Egg Herb), resembles **kǎi leaves** (葵叶) but is purple, with a swallow-like shape poised as if ready to take flight. It shines brightly and penetrates with clarity.\n\nThe **fourth herb, Yèguāng Dòngcǎo** (Moonlight Piercing Grass), is green in color, with leaves resembling **xiàngshí** (a type of grass), and its fruit is white like a **plum** (李), standing three to four feet tall. Its fruit emits moonlight-like radiance at night, illuminating a room like a lantern. A single stalk bears nine fruits, which, upon falling to the ground, quickly expand to the size of a seven-inch diameter **mirror** (镜盘), pressing into the earth one to two inches deep. When viewed at night, the fruit’s glow resembles the **eyes of a cow** (牛目) gazing and blinking.\n\nThe **fifth herb, Báijiāng Kǔguò Qièyù Zhī** (White Jiang Bitter-Exceeding Cut Jade Herb), surpasses even the **Yùzhī** (Jade Herb) in bitterness.\n\nThe **Yínghuǒ Zhī** (Glowing Fire Herb), as *Zhēnkuò* (True Edicts) states: On **Liángcháng Shān** (Good Constant Mountain), there exists a herb resembling a **glowing firefly** (荧火), whose fruit appears grass-like but is not. Its **purple flowers** (紫华) are as large as beans, and when viewed at night, they emit light. Consuming this herb clarifies the mind (心孔明), enabling one to read by moonlight.\n\nThe **Jiǔjīng Zǐgē Zhī** (Nine-Stem Purple Mushroom), **Dānzhū** (Crimson Pearl), and **Yùjiāng** (Jade Nectar), along with the **Lánggě Zhī** (Lánggě Herb), are all recorded in *Zhōushì Xuántōng Jì* (Master Zhou’s Secret Transmission of Daoist Penetration).\n\nThe **Dānzhī** (Crimson Herb) mentioned above, according to Daoist transmissions, is not something ordinary mortals can easily obtain.\n\n**Shí Nǎo** (Stone Brain) is recorded by the lords as coming from the northern cave of **Fāngshān** (Square Mountain). **Máo Yangzi Jiāng Bózhēn** (Master Máo of the Sentient Sun, Jiang Bózhēn) once took and consumed it. There is also this substance in the center of **Běikūn** (Northern Kun).\n\n**Shí Shèng** (Stone Victory) resembles stone but is smaller, spotted, and softer. It is found everywhere.\n\nConsuming this causes one to feel **warmth** (身热) intermittently and also prevents **thirst** (不渴). According to *Zhēnzhǐ* (True Edicts), it cures **wind-related numbness and paralysis** (疗风痹).\n\n**Shí Zhōng Rǔ** (Stone Bell Milk) is recorded in the *Běncǎo* (Classic of Herbs) as follows: In **Máoshān** (Mao Mountain), the soil and stones are mixed, and the milk-like substance is slightly black and smooth. It is called **Máoshān Rǔ** (Mao Mountain Milk), with a **slightly cold nature** (微寒).\n\n**Yǔyú Liáng** (Yǔyú Grain), as the *Běncǎo* states: **Máoshān** has excellent specimens, resembling **niúhuáng** (ox gallstone), with layered, armored scales. The finest parts are purple, resembling **miǎn** (a type of cloth), and when blown upon, they leave no residue. However, it should be finely ground and then decocted with water to extract the juice, which must be clarified—**no sand or soil should remain** (勿令有沙土也). As *Yǐnjū* (Hidden Dwelling) notes: This substance is obtained by digging into the earth of **Máoshān**, and the finest specimens bear **purple flowers** (紫华). It is **delicate and refined** (靡靡), suitable for consumption and medicinal use.\n\n**Nánzhù** (Southern Candle), according to *Qīngxū Zhēnrén Nèichuán* (Inner Transmission of the Pure Void Immortal), is a plant whose **trunk resembles wood** (木本), but its **leaves resemble grass** (似草), hence its name **Nánzhù Cǎo** (Southern Candle Grass). It is also known as **Hóushú Cǎo** (Hóushú Grass), **Nánxù** (Southern Continuation), and **Wéinà Mù** (King of the Wéinà Trees).\n\n**Xiǎoxǔ Zhēnrén** (Master Xiao of the Tiny Allowance) states: **Fāngshān** (Square Mountain) has an exceptional variety of **Hóushú Cǎo**, with large leaves. The **Hàoyuè** (Broad Valley) region also calls it **Rǎnshú** (Stained Grass).\n\nAs *Dēngzhēn Yǐnjiào* (Hidden Precepts of Ascending the Dao) records: The **Sān Máo** (Three Mao Mountains) and **Sì Píng** (Four Flat Mountains) have fewer of these plants, but their trunks are large. Their **fruits resemble tea berries** (茱萸), ripening in the **eighth** or **ninth month**, with a **sour yet sweet taste** (酸美可食). The leaves do not grow opposite each other, resembling **míng leaves** (茗) but rounded. Their flavor is **heavy and intoxicating** (厚味小醉), and they remain evergreen in both **winter and summer** (冬夏常青). Their **branches and stems are slightly purple** (枝茎微紫), and the large trees reach heights of four to five **zhang** (丈), though they are **brittle** (甚脆) and easily broken.\n\nThe **good prescription** (良方) attributed to **Shěn Cúnzhōng** (Shěn the Hidden Middle) is not the **Nántiān Zhù** (Southern Heaven Candle), as previously stated.\n\n**Mùběncǎo** (Wood-Born Grass), as *Yǐnjū* states: The finest specimens come from **Báishān** (White Mountain), **Jiāngshān** (Jiāng Mountain), and **Máoshān**. According to *Zhēnkuò*, the **Zǐwēi Fūrén Mù** (Wood of the Purple Darkness Lady) is praised for its benefits, and several prescriptions for its consumption are transmitted.\n\n**Páoyào** (Peony), as *Yǐnjū* states: The finest specimens come from **Báishān**, **Jiāngshān**, and **Máoshān**, being **white and large** (白而长大). Other regions have it, but it is often **red** (赤). There are also three varieties recorded in the **Páoyào Cōng** (Peony Canon): **Máoshān Guànzǐ** (Mao Mountain Crown), **Zǐlóuzǐ** (Purple Tower), and **Máoshān Hóng** (Mao Mountain Red).\n\n**Huángjīng**, when **nine-steamed and nine-baked** (九蒸九曝), preserves youthful appearance (驻颜). As *Yǐnjū* states: It is highly regarded in Daoist scriptures, and its **roots, leaves, flowers, and fruits** (根叶华实) can all be consumed or used in medicines. It is best taken in **alcohol dispersions** (酒散随宜), and the **Máoshān** variety is the finest.\n\n**Hé Shǒuwū**, as the *Běncǎo* states: It was transmitted by **Zǔnéng Sū** (the Sage who inherited the Ancestor’s ability). Consuming it is beneficial. In **Táng Yùnhé** (Tang Yuanhe, 812 CE), **Monk Wénxiàng** (文象) encountered an **old man of Máoshān** (茅山老人), who then passed down its cultivation. **Lǐ Yì** (李翱) later recorded this in his **Fānglù** (Square Records).\n\n**Fùzǐ**, known in the mountains as **Máofù** (Mao Attachment), is smaller than the **Shǔ** (Sichuan) variety but has **weaker efficacy** (气劣) and **stronger ability to dispel dampness** (大去湿).\n\n**Wūtóu** (Monk’s Head) has the same properties as **Fùzǐ**.\n\n**Jǔpú** (Galingale), sourced from **Jǔpú Tán** (Galingale Pond), grows to one **inch** (寸) with twelve **nodes** (节).\n\n**Suìlíng** (Dried Poria), **Báishú** (White Atractylodes), **Gǒuqǐ** (Lycium Fruit), **Zéxiè** (Alisma), **Huánglián** (Coptis), **Juémíng** (Spiegel’s Ironweed), **Máosháo** (Mao Peony), **Jiégēng** (Platycodon), **Xìxīn** (Asarum), **Qiánhú** (Peucedanum), **Jùmǔ** (Curculigo), **Fángfēng** (Ligusticum), **Yīngsù** (Poppy), **Xuán Húsǔo** (Black Cohosh), **Tiānnánxīng** (Arisaema), **Huángdú** (Solomon’s Seal), **Shānyào** (Dioscorea), **Yùjùn** (Jade Fungus), **Zǐyú** (Purple Colocasia), and **Jīn Yīngzǐ** (Golden Poppy Seed) are all refined into **medicinal pastes** (炼为膏) or **decocted as alcohol tinctures** (煎酒和服), with a taste like **honey** (饴).\n\nThese are **remarkable trees and rare plants** (名木异卉).\n\nThe **Left-Nu Cypress** was planted by the hand of **Xù Chángshǐ** of **Jìn**, standing in **Yùchén Guān**. The **Crane-Top Pine**, also called the **Nine-Branched Pine**, is found atop the **Crane Temple**; it is said that when **Máo Jūn** governed **Yìchéng**, he ascended here, and its twin trunks suggest it may not be the original tree. The **Nine-Sun Pine** stands on the northern slope of **Jīnjūn Shān**, its rainbow-hued branches arching to the earth, its ancient majesty unmatched.\n\nThe **Recluse’s Pine** grows atop the **Fāngtán** of **Xuánzhōu’s** hermitage. The **Coiled-Dragon Pine** is beside **Qīngzhēn Guān**. The **Scripture Platform Pine** was planted before the **Tàiyuán Hall** of **Chóngshòu Guān**—in the late **Sòng**, a Daoist from **Xiányáng’s** **Lǎojūn Scripture Platform** transplanted its roots here; its fragrant wood, verdant and rare, surpasses common trees.\n\nThe **Loquat-Plum Tree** stood in the **Xiàbó Palace**; when **Dà Sīmìng Jūn** first entered the mountains, he dwelled beneath it, building a hut to await his two younger brothers. The **Residual Vermilion Well** remains, though the tree is now gone. The **discarded drum** hidden in **Xiàbó** was carved from a single block of wood, over three *chǐ* in diameter—it is said to have been made from an ancient tree’s trunk.\n\nThe **Ancient Trees of Fúxiāng** were planted by **Liáng Zhāomíng Tàizǐ** above the **Fúxiāng Well**; though half its heartwood has rotted, its vitality thrives anew. The **Wild Peach** and **Slanting-Li Tree** are recorded in **Wèi Gōng’s** *Píngquán Records of Plants*, both native to **Máoshān**. The **White Li Tree** bears seeds left by **Zhǎn Xiānrén**. The **Fúxiāng Nai** resembles a **Lì bird** but is smaller, said to dispel pestilence.\n\nThe **Mandarin Duck Tree** in **Gǔniú Cáo** has two trunks fused at their crowns, with no visible joints. The **Stream Reeds**—recorded as *fāngsuì* in **Píngquán’s** *Fragrant Reeds*—grow in **Máoshān’s** eastern streams; the *Yǐnjū* calls them *suìhuā*, purple-blossomed and thriving in shallow waters, said to have been planted by the **female immortal** **Qián Miàozhēn**.\n\nThe **Jade Orchid’s** buds exhale a subtle essence—another variant of the **Zhīyīng** (mushroom). The **Orchid**, **Osmanthus**, **Tea**, and **Lucky Fragrance** complete the account.\n\n(*Máoshān Zhì*, Volume 19 concludes.)\n\n---\n\n**Volume 20 of the *Records of Máoshān***, compiled by the **Succeeding Master of the Upper Clarity Daoist Lineage**, **Liù Dàbīn**, records the **Gold and Stone** section.\n\nThe **Inscription of the Nine Sacrificial Offerings to the True Person of the Three Teáos**—its **Jade Tablet Text of the Nine Sacrificial Offerings** appears in the **Decree and Supplementary Ink** section.\n\nIn the **third year of the Common Era** (under the **Liáng** dynasty), the year **Rén Yín**, on the **first day of the fifth month**, **Rén Chén**, and the **fifteenth day**, **Bǐng Wǔ**, the **disciple of the Three Caverns**, **Zhènghào** of **Zhāng Jùn’s** district, and the **Daoist of Máoshān**, **Sūn Wéntāo**, inscribed it, while **Yuàn Dàoshù** engraved the characters.\n\nThe **True Person of Great Origin, Sīmìng Jūn**, whose given name was **Yíng**, with the courtesy name **Shūshēn**, hailed from **Nán Guān** of **Xiànyáng**. He was born in the **fifth year of the Middle Element** (under the **Hàn** dynasty), the year **Bǐng Shēn**, when the **Great Year** (太歲) coincided with the **Hàn Scène Emperor’s** reign. At **eighteen**, he abandoned his family to study the **Dao**, entering **Héngshān** for six years. By then, he was **twenty-five**.\n\nMoved by the **Dao’s** divine penetration, he then followed **Wáng Jūn** of **Xīchéng** for **seventeen years**. At **forty**, he and **Wáng Jūn** together ascended in their **spirit vehicles** to **Guīshān**, where the **Queen Mother of the West** (王母) bestowed scriptures upon them. He then returned with **Wáng Jūn** to **Xīchéng**.\n\nAfter three more years of refining his methods, at **forty-seven**, his **appearance became as radiant as jade**, his **body emitting a luminous glow**. **Wáng Jūn** further granted him a **single dose of the Nine-Circulation Elixir of Return**, completing his mastery of the **Dao**. At **forty-nine**, in the **fourth year of the Tiān Hàn** (under **Wǔdì**), he returned home to attend to his parents, while also commanding **ghosts and spirits**.\n\nThose who died violently and lay buried for long were all restored to life by his will. He remained at home for **fifty-three years**. After his parents’ passing, in the **fifth year of the Initial Element** (under **Yuán Dì**), the year **Dīng Chǒu**, on the **third day of the fourth month**, he manifested himself, ascending on **cloud vehicles** to **Jùqū** Mountain in **Jiāngzuǒ**, at the age of **one hundred and two**.\n\nHe stayed there for **forty-three years**. In the **second year of the Yán Shòu** (under **Āi Dì**), the year **Gēng Shēn**, on the **eighteenth day of the eighth month**, **Jǐ Yǒu**, after receiving the **sacrificial offerings**, departed with the **officials**, ascending on **cloud vehicles** to the **palace of the Jade Caverns** in **Hòshān’s** **Chìchéng**.\n\nAs he left, he instructed his two disciples: *\"I depart now with a fixed mission; I cannot often return. I shall come back to this mountain once every year, on the **eighteenth day of the third month** and the **second day of the twelfth month**, to meet with my teachers and the **True Person of the Great Void** from **Nán Yuè**. If there are those who earnestly seek the **Dao**, I will personally attend to them. Those with sincere hearts, I will guide and instruct before they attain enlightenment.\"*\n\nThe **True Lord of Fixed Records**, whose given name was **Gù**, with the courtesy name **Jìwěi**, was the second brother of **Taiyuan Lord**. In the first year of **Xīngdì’s** *Hòuyuán*, during the year **Wùxū**, he was born into the world, distinguished by his **bright virtue and sagely wisdom**, his **loyal and filial nature**, and his **ascetic demeanor**. He was recommended as a **filial and virtuous scholar**, selected as an **accomplished and worthy talent**, and appointed as **Five Offices Clerk** and **Governor of Wǔwēi**.\n\nIn the fourth year of **Xiàoyuán**, during the year **Bǐngzǐ**, in the fourth month, he was transferred to the position of **Commander of the Golden Halberd**. On the day of his **meeting with the Lord of Fate and the Guest**, he was **one hundred years old**.\n\nThe **Lord Who Preserves Life**, whose given name was **Zhōng**, with the courtesy name **Sīhé**, was the youngest brother of **Taiyuan Lord**. He was born in the year **Gēngzǐ** of *Hòuyuán*’s third year. From his youth, he was renowned for his **moral integrity and upright conduct**, earning high praise for his **virtuous and refined character**. He secluded himself on **Huayue Mountain** for over fifty years. Due to his **superior learning and fitness for office**, in the second year of **Xuāndì’s** *Dìjié*, he was appointed as **Magistrate of Wéiyáng**, later transferred to **Western City Military Commander**. In the fourth year, fourth month, he was appointed **Governor of Shàngjùn** and **Grandee of the Five Departments**, departing on the same day as **Dìnglù Lord**. On the day of his **meeting with the Lord of Fate and the Guest**, he was **ninety-eight years old**.\n\nBoth lords, in the year **Dīngchǒu**, resigned their posts and returned home, dedicating themselves to cultivation for five years. In the fifth year of **Yuándì’s** *Yǒngyuán*, during the year **Rénwǔ**, they crossed the river to seek their elder brother. At that time, the **Middle Lord** was **one hundred and fifty years old**, and the **Younger Lord** was **one hundred and thirty years old**. After **twenty-four years of arduous cultivation**, they were granted **one dose of the Nine-Cycle Refined Elixir**. Upon ingestion, they attained **Dao**.\n\n**Inscription:**\nAs for the **indiscernible distinction between existence and nonexistence**, the **unfathomable interplay of yin and yang**, these transcend all naming—yet now we speak of their **traces** and **abodes**, recounting their **whereabouts**.\n\nThe **Lord** was originally a man of **Xiānyáng’s** southern pass.\n\nWhen **Zhuānzhǐ** first arose, he descended from **Ji** of the Yellow Emperor, the second son of the Duke of Zhou, who divided his duties to establish the lineage, taking the surname **Máo** and the clan **Zú**. The **High Ancestor** **Mēng** possessed profound insight and divine vision, transcending the mundane at **Huáyùe**; when the **Lord** entered the mountains, he rode upon clouds and controlled the **Dragon** of **Nányuè**.\n\nThe **Ancestor** **Xiàn** was endowed with talents both square and round, his wisdom encompassing both **Dao** and martial arts. He pacified the lands of **Kè** and **Yáng**, and the **First Emperor of Qin** praised and lamented him, bestowing the honors of a **Chancellor**.\n\nThe **Father**, **Zhuó**, harbored the **qi** of ancient purity, embracing the **True Essence** of the **Highest Sovereign**. Unwilling to seek office or worldly affairs, he remained steadfast and unyielding.\n\nThe **Lord** received the **Elemental Spirit** at **Miàoshǐ**, standing firm in **Dao** at **Xuánfú**. His natural understanding was singular and refined, his innate disposition lofty and detached. Deeply moved by the brevity of mortal life, he awakened to the possibility of eternal **Dao**—thus he abandoned the **ribbons and official robes** of the **Ministerial Gate**, donning **hemp-cloth garments** in the **mountains and valleys**.\n\nAt **eighteen years old**, he retired to **Héngshān**, there to follow the **Way**. His **inner cultivation** was profound, his **oral teachings** vast; he sustained himself on **cultivated herbs and wood**, and wore **broom and bramble** as his attire.\n\nAfter **six years** of rigorous asceticism on the mountain, he ascended in spirit to the **Western City Lord**, serving him with devotion for **sixteen years**. He was granted **nearness to the divine robes and scriptures**, and shared in the **procession of the celestial carriage**. Then he crossed the **White Water** to reach **Guīshān**, ascending **Qīnglín** to visit the **Queen Mother**. There he received the **inscriptions of the jade pendant and golden talisman**, the **hidden teachings of the Great Dao**, and thus attained the **returned form of jade-like purity** and the **restored appearance of the Minor Sovereign**.\n\nThe **Lord** then returned to the **Celestial Lord**, who said to him: *\"Your Dao has now been perfected; you may now depart.\"* He sought me again at **Nányuè** after **one hundred years**, and then entrusted you with the **Divine Mandate of the Immortal** in the lands of **Wúyuè**.\n\nThe **Lord** then halted his **cloud-carriage** at the **Celestial Crossroads**, and stopped his **feathered carriage** on the **Han Path**. In humble **hemp-cloth and coarse garments**, he returned to pay respects to his parents. His father, wishing to punish him with a rod, saw the **Lord** smiling as he knelt in gratitude, his warmth and reverence complete. The rod shattered into pieces, scattering like lightning—**as though struck by thunder**. The father then commanded the **Lord** to revive the dead, and he summoned the **spirits and deities** with a word, severing the **false bonds of the Underworld**.\n\nThose he revived could not be counted. The **Lord’s** two younger brothers both served the **Han Dynasty**, and at that time, they were all summoned by imperial decree, departing together on the same day. Hundreds of guests, near and far, came to see them off. The **Lord** personally hosted them, initially not differing from common custom, but then said: *\"Though I do not hold the rank of a **Grand Minister** or **Chancellor**, I must fulfill a **Divine Office**. The **Celestial Emperor** has now selected me to serve as the **Superintendent of the Southern Peak** and **Chief of the Records of Life and Death**, a position of great celestial importance. Next year, on the **third day of the fourth month**, I will assume this office—will your esteemed guests still be able to visit me as they do today?\"*\n\nThe assembled guests, filled with delight, all wished to prolong the farewell rites, but the **Lord** forbade them.\n\nWhen the appointed time arrived, the **Divine Office** manifested naturally in a single day: **guest pavilions** lined the gates, **banquet halls** filled the roads, the earth moistened like **fat and oil**, the ground level as a **mirror’s surface**, **celestial officials** arrayed like stars, **heavenly steeds** gathered in clouds, **dragon chariots** from the sea, and **wind-canopied carriages** from the mountains—all arrived in **mist and rain**, their presence overflowing without measure.\n\nWhen receiving guests, the **Lord** offered them **delicacies and fine wine**, **rare fruits and exquisite dishes**, all of which were not recognized by the ordinary guests. **Gold-trimmed tables**, **jewel-encrusted cups**, **celestial maidens** of the **Han**—these were beyond the scope of mere words and symbols.\n\nAt that time, the **Three Sovereigns** invited him to ascend, and the **Nine Tributes** urged him to depart. The **Lord** then gazed upon the **feathered canopy** and composed his **divine appearance**, reflecting upon his imminent departure and gathering his **jade-like brilliance**. Raising his hands in farewell, he addressed all with perfect clarity, saying: *\"The **True Dao** is hidden nearby; it does not demand outward display or dazzling deeds to be seen or heard. I now speak to you not to remain silent, but to encourage my two brothers to follow in my footsteps—though they need not wait for them to abandon their delusions. All who have **Dao** should direct their attentions to the **Divine Immortals**. Now I depart, and I will halt at the **confluence of the Jiang River** and **Jǔqū Mountain**, there to purify and refine myself, before receiving my duties.\"*\n\nThen he ascended upon the **cloud-plow**, his movements serene; he advanced with the **feathered carriage**, his return measured. **Luan** and **Fèng** cried in lament, **tigers leapt** and **dragons soared**, the **purple canopy** transformed into **radiant clouds**, the **scarlet retinue** into **flashing lightning**. Having attained the **unfathomable divine carriage**, he **easily departed** in the **wheels of the Immortal**.\n\nAt this, the people looked at each other and sang in celebration without restraint.\n\nThe **Lord** then **urged the dragon reins** and **soared aloft**, pointing toward **Jǔqū Mountain** to rest. **Scarlet officials** hung in procession, **purple banners** fluttered in the void, overseeing the **celestial tasks** and managing the **records of the Minor Sovereign**. Those who traveled **thousands of li** could not be counted.\n\nWhen the two brothers heard that the **Lord** had attained **Dao**, they each resigned their posts and returned home, ceasing their families’ affairs to cultivate, accumulating **five years** of practice. Crossing the **river**, they sought their elder brother.\n\nThe **Lord** then instructed them in the **Four-Leaf Divine Scatter** of the Yellow Emperor and the **Green Sprout Method** of **changing the withered and nourishing the bones**. With diligent effort, they refined their **elixir** to perfection, their accumulated **qi** sensing the **mysterious spirits**.\n\nThe **Lord** further recommended them to the **Celestial Lord**, urging them to persevere through **hardship** and **bitterness**, and to strive with **great effort**. Thus, the **Lord** was granted the **Divine Appointment of High Holiness**, and they both **rested in the fields of the Peach Blossom Spring**.\n\nThe **Lord** then rode the **Nine Tributes’ carriage**, his **wheels guided by the Three Sovereigns**, drifting upon the **floating clouds** of **Nányuè**. Yet he still **pitying the suffering of the people**, lamented the **plight of the common folk**, and thus promised to descend again to **Jīnlíng** within **one year**, recording their **meritorious deeds** in the **Jade Register**.\n\nThe **Lord’s** depth of **Dao**, **virtue**, and **wisdom**, his **filial piety** and **fraternal devotion** reaching the **Divine**, his **sincerity** in sensing the **mysterious** and **piercing the numinous**, his **earth-shaking and heaven-moving deeds**—from ancient times to the present, none can compare to him.\n\nAs for those who **chase the moon’s reflection** or **control the dragon’s reins**, they still cannot adequately describe his **grandeur**—how much less can they convey the **Lord’s** majesty with such comparisons as **the hidden Yang** or **the submerged Yin**, those who **traverse water and transform into fire**?\n\nThere was a **Daoist** named **Zhāng Yì**, who, hearing of the **Lord’s** near holiness, lamented that he could not see his **true visage**, and feared that the **Lord’s** **supreme virtue** would fade with time, that his **transmitted glory** would dwindle. Thus, he respectfully gathered those of like mind, carefully carving this **transmission** for posterity.\n\n「Though his **Daoist robes** were often brushed aside, hoping the great stone might not crumble,\nHe faced the ages with unyielding sincerity, gazing upon eternity with an open heart.\nYet he lamented that words could not fully express his meaning,\nAnd wished the unseen might not judge him unfairly.\n\nThus he reverently inscribed this ode:\n**Mysterious Mystery, the Origin of Marvels**,\n**Treasure of the Celestial, the Spirit’s End**—\n**Illuminated Wisdom** does not manifest in form,\n**Enlightened Stillness**—how can it be spoken?\n\nHis mind sought paths beyond mortal reach,\nHis finger traced sources none could fathom.\nOnce he encountered this **common folk**,\nThen he pondered the **ascended and the tumultuous**.\nLingering in the endless night,\nHis waves surged through the eternal gloom.\nSwift as lightning, brief as the sun’s shadow,\nFleeting as stars in their course.\nBoth **transient and eternal lives** alike\nAre but wandering spirits of the dark.\nSince their **delusion** has passed,\nThere is no way to return.\n\nWho mourns whom? Only the **Sage** and the **Worthy**—\nThey follow the **rules of harmony**,\nRespond to the **assigned tasks of the square and round**.\nAs **Teacher** and **Friend**,\nThey serve as **Supreme Minister** and **Heavenly Guide**.\n\nThe **True Person** of **Huayang**,\nHis birthplace in the **Maoist** realm—\nSolitary and pure, standing alone in brilliance,\nLofty as the **Celestial Phoenix’s** abode,\nLike the **Jade Capital** beyond the sky,\nLike the **Yellow River’s clarity**—once in a thousand years.\n\nYour **Sage’s Virtue** stands alone and pure,\nDelighting in the **Dao’s profound essence**,\nAbandoning rank and renouncing glory—\nOnce in a thousand years, like the **Yellow River’s clarity**,\nLofty beyond the sky, like the **Jade Capital**.\n\nYour **autumnal majesty** and **springtime benevolence**,\nYour **sunlike warmth** and **moonlike luminosity**,\nYour **golden firmness** and **jade-like refinement**,\nYour **water’s purity** and **ice’s clarity**—\nEnduring through the ages, revered in silence,\nYour **transmitted glory** echoes, though distant.\n\nThis **spirit-inscribed tablet** stands as if **hosted by the Dark Star**,\nWith four remarkable features:\nFirst, the craftsmen **carved the mountain**,\nYet found only this single stone—**preformed as if by fate**.\nSecond, all other stones could not bear as **footstones**,\nBut the one beneath the tablet’s base **resembled a crouching dragon**.\nThird, the **hidden stones** formed a natural ring,\nYet only the **pillar’s resting place** bore a **spontaneous flame**.\nFourth, when the work was done,\nA **flying spring** suddenly surged from the cavern.\n\nOn the tablet’s shadow and its narrow sides,\nThe names of **high Daoists** from the **Qi and Liang dynasties** were inscribed,\nA faint glimpse of **adopted purity** and **wandering verses** on the stone pillars.\nThe **Natural Disciple** Xu Kai respectfully paid homage to **Huayang’s Celestial Abode**.\n\nMany **Tang and Song-era inscriptions** have since faded or been lost.\nThe **Upper Clarity True Person** Xu Changshih’s former **shrine and altar tablet**—\nHis **Natural Disciple**, the **Huayang Hermit** Tao Hongjing, now reverently constructs this.\n\nHow vast and boundless it is—\nThe **Spirit of the Universe**!\nIt cannot be conveyed by **words or symbols**,\nNor recorded in **script or borders**.\nYet how else would later generations hear of it?\n\nIt **embraces and exhales all things**,\n**Transforming and nurturing** both **dry and living**—\nIts **origin** is **mysterious**,\nIts **meaning** returns to **dim obscurity**.\n\nAs for **formal distinctions** and **divided natures**,\nOr **matters limited by perception** and **principles exhausted by calculation**—\nEven if one could speak of **mountains’ heights** or **seas’ breadths**,\nWhy should they be constrained by such **finite measures**?\n\nWithin the **Great Heaven** there are **thirty-six lesser heavens**,\nAll **expanding into the void**, **spanning the waters’ currents**,\n**Opening gates to winds and valleys**, **connecting the qi of clouds and pathways**.\n\nThis mountain was originally called **Jùqū**,\nIts eighth **cavernous palace** beneath it—\nNamed **Huayang’s Golden Furnace Heaven**,\nIt encircles **150 li**, divided into **three palaces**.\nDuring the **Western Han Emperor Yuan’s reign**,\nThe **Three Mao Lords of Xianyang** attained the **Dao**,\nAnd came to oversee this duty,\nHence it is called **Mao Mountain**—details are in the **transmission records**.\n\nBy **Jin Taihe Year 1**,\n**Xu Changshih** built his residence here,\nIts nearby remains still exist.\nIn the **early Song dynasty**,\nThe **Jingwang of Changsha** established a **Daoist retreat** on this site.\nIn **Year 13 of Tianjian**,\nThe **retreat was purchased** and renamed **Zhuyang Pavilion**,\nTo **respond to distant omens** and **establish the auspicious fire’s chronicle**.\nIn the **west of the mountain’s embrace**,\nA **hermitage** was built for dwelling.\nIn **Year 14**,\nA **retreat hall** was separately constructed on **Yùgāng Peak**,\nFollowing the **tracing of Xuanzhou’s** footsteps.\nIn **Year 17**,\nThe **shrine and altar tablet** were then polished and inscribed,\nTo **reverently record the True Person’s path**.\n\nThe **True Person** bore the surname **Xu**, given name **Mù**,\nKnown in the world as **Xu Mi**,\nWith the courtesy name **Sī Xuán**.\nOriginally from **Píngyù, Rùnán**,\nDuring the **Middle Plains Era of Emperor Ling of the Later Han**,\nHis **sixth-generation ancestor Xu Guang**,\nCourtesy name **Shào Zhāng**,\nAvoided the **Xu Chancellor’s** flattery and arrogance,\nAnd came to **cross the Yangtze**,\nResiding in **Jíyáng, Jùróng County’s** **Jìyáng Village**.\nLater he served the **Han court** as **Light Glory General**,\nRecognized by **Yu Xubao** for his talent,\nWith **descendants renowned for their brilliance**.\n\n**Xu Shang**, courtesy name **Yuán Fǔ**,\nHad **literary insight and foresight**,\nAnd served as **Han’s Palace Attendant**.\n**Xu Fù**, courtesy name **Zhòng Xiān**,\nWas **broad and profound in bearing**,\nWith a **refined and simple style**,\nHolding titles of **Jin’s Inspector of Yùe**, **Pacifying General**, **Governor of Xiànuò**, and **Western City Marquis**.\n\n**Xu Changshih** was the **fifth son of Xu Fù**.\nThough his **early life was obscure**,\nHe became a **model of esteem** while **Duke Jing of Jin** was in exile,\nStarting as a **Master of the Imperial University**,\nHis **courtly conduct and scholarly discussions** revered in **Confucian circles**.\nHe was appointed **Magistrate of Yúmiáo County**,\nWhere he **diligently cared for the people’s hidden sufferings**,\nAnd **benefited neighboring districts**.\nWhen **called to the capital**, he **entered the imperial gate with triumph**,\nAnd **offered counsel at the emperor’s side**.\nBy the **end of Emperor Cheng’s reign**,\nHe was promoted to **Protector of the Military** and **Supervisor of the Native County**,\n**Commanding armies externally**, **interpreting sacred texts internally**,\n**Distant lands obeying his laws**, **local customs refined by his governance**.\nDuring the **Taihe Era**,\nHe was transferred to **Attendant of the Imperial Household** and **Constant Companion of the Imperial Guard**,\nHis **eloquence and brilliance** resounding,\nHis **affairs** returning to **upholding virtue**.\n\nWhen **Duke Jing ascended the throne**,\nHe was **still honored as an elder of the state**,\nBut when **Duke Jing died**, he **withdrew in retirement**,\nDevoting himself to **mountain seclusion** and **the highest Dao**.\n\nThough you **dressed in official robes** and **discussed affairs in the halls of learning**,\nYour **heart aspired beyond the world’s symbols**,\nYour **resolve bound to the **Daoist** gates**.\nYour **fourth elder brother** **Wanyou**,\nIn **Year 4 of Yonghe**,\n**Happily departed**, never returning.\nYou still **yearned for the mysterious and strange**,\nWith each passing year, your **aspirations grew loftier**,\nAlways **deeply connected** with **Yang Shen** in **spiritual clarity**.\nDuring the **Xīngníng Era**,\nThe **Daoist Immortals descended upon Yang Shen**,\nCommanding him to **proclaim their decrees**,\nWith **dragon-script writings** and **divine seals**,\nTheir **words profound and encompassing**,\nTheir **mysterious meanings** now **fully explored**.\nAt **seventy-two**, you **abandoned your carriage**,\nYour **pursuit of the Dao** ever more steadfast.\n\nIn **Year 1 of Taiyuan**,\nYou **passed away**, aged **72**.\nYour **descendants** followed **proper rites**,\nAnd placed your **empty coffin** in the **great tomb west of the county**.\nThough the **capital’s traces** have faded,\nThe **flying sword’s** resting place remains.»\n\nIn accordance with the *True Revelations* (*Zhēn Yì*), your noble lineage was rooted in the **Mandate of Heaven**, its green virtue enduring for ages. In the era of King Wu of Zhou, you were the younger brother of Lord Changli of Xuegong, the Ninth Palace’s high minister, and also bore the legacy of Xu Zhao’s meritorious deeds. Thus, you were destined to inherit blessings for future generations, ascending through fortune and birth to fulfill the Dao. By the decree of the Jade Tablets, you were ordained as **Upper Clarity True Person**, ennobled as a **Marquis**, and ranked among the **Ministers of State**, governing the Dao and nurturing the people alongside the Sage.\n\nThough your **True Transmission** remained unseen in the world, none could fully recount it. You, **Master Yang**, named **Yì**, are documented in the *True Revelations*. As the third son of **Changshi**, you were named **Yùfǔ**, with the worldly name **Dū**, and the courtesy name **Dàoxiáng**. Your true mother, Lady Tao Wei, had already ascended to the **Cavern Palaces** and was later reincarnated in the imperial household. You were of **pure and luminous refinement**, surpassing all in your generation. Though recommended for the **Imperial Censorate**, you declined. Rejecting the dust of mundane affairs, you devoted yourself to the **Highest Path**, becoming the **True Master** of **Hongjing’s** esoteric teachings. Dwelling in this residence, you repaired and transmitted the **Sacred Scriptures and Methods**. Often, **Master Yang** would join you, and through repeated communion, you attained **True Sensation**.\n\nIn **Taihe Year 5**, you departed this life at thirty. The *True Revelations* proclaim: *\"Sixteen years hence, you shall ascend to the **Bundle of Flowers** as the **Upper Minister**, serving the **Green Boy Lord**.\"* At dawn, you received the **Scriptures**, becoming **Upper Clarity Immortal Lord**, sharing duties with **Gǔ Xīzǐ**. Your station compared to that of a **Worldly Attendant**. Your elder brother, **Kuì**, with the worldly name **Zhèn**, and your second brother, **Hǔfāng**, with the worldly name **Lián**, also attained the Dao. **Kuì** now has a **Celestial Descendant**, **Língzhēn**, in the mountains, urging the establishment of a **Hall for True Succession** to honor the distant ancestors.\n\nBy the **Sovereign’s solemn vow**, you were summoned to this land, where you **nurtured the myriads** and **molded the virtuous**. You **propagated the Law** and **opened the common folk** to its teachings, drawing upon your **hidden reserves** of the **Three True Ones**. Having long dwelled in **Huayang**, it was fitting to restore your ancestral home, tending to its upkeep. Thus, the craftsmen were summoned to erect this **Hall of Tranquility**, aligning with the **Celestial Sovereign’s decrees** and elucidating the **Great Plan**.\n\nTo the east, the **Green Altar** stands; to the west, the **White Pagoda** rises. Between them lies this foundation. Buried **jade tokens** and **sacred tiles** were unearthed, their **purple bonds** and **white mists** lingering like protective canopies. To the south of the residence lies a well—dug by **Changshi**—and beyond it, a great pond, a remnant of the **Guo Dynasty’s** design. Its source flows from **Tian Gong’s Spring**, its path following the **Ma-Jia Road**, flanked by **Lei Ping’s ridges** and overlooking **Xia Bo’s expanse**. To the north, the **Long Ridge** stretches, while the **Yang Valley’s** willows bend westward. Within these four boundaries, it is called the **\"Golden Ling’s Lung\"**—and **Changshi’s** dwelling was its most distinguished site.\n\nNow, with **rainbow clouds** and **soaring cranes**, you soar high, gazing upon the **vast tides** and sweeping the **ancient capital** into the distance. As the ancients said, *\"Who would dare not transmit this?\"* Thus, I dare to inscribe this stele, offering it to future worthies.\n\nThe **Cosmic Pivot’s breath** now exhales its **Numinous Essence**. Following **Nature’s divisions**, **Awareness** manifests **Form**. Your **Transformation** permeates the **Eight Quarters**, your **Virtue** saturates the **Four Seas**. Your **Traces** vanish like lightning; your **Substance** rests in the **Abyss**. Suddenly, **Mountains rise**; the **Sea’s clouds** unfold. You **Ride the Wind and Swim the Waters**, **Tread the Real and Soar the Void**. Even the **Hidden Artisans** carved stone to build your halls. Your **Aspirations** soared beyond the body, your **Celestial Treasury** rooted in the earth. The **Coiling Peaks** curve gracefully, the **Painted Fields** float like lungs. The **Five Enclosures** face open, the **Nine Rivers** encircle. The **Longyang Ridges** intersect, their **Lush Valleys** meeting the **Flowing Streams**.\n\nThus, it is called **\"Dragon’s Lair\"**—the **Sovereign’s Golden Hill**. In ancient **Western Han**, the **Three Teachings** came as guests. From **Late Jin onward**, the **Two Xu** embraced the **True**. They **dug the foundations**, **dug the well**, and **dwelled in the Dao**, welcoming the **Divine**. You were **worthy to assist the Sage**, granted this **Celestial Attendance**. Across the ages, **Names and Clans** intertwine like **Twisted Silk**. The **Scriptures and Decrees** are fully proclaimed; their **Essence** has not faded. Yet, **others** have grown distant.\n\nThe **Dharma’s decline** has sunk into ruin. The **Court’s trees** wither under frost; the **Hall’s courtyard** is overgrown with grass. Since **Huayang’s** establishment, two decades have passed. Ever mindful of the past, we follow the **Grand Path**. The **Sovereign decrees**: *\"Here, you shall rest.\"* The **Hall’s construction** is complete, its **Resonances** profound. The **Jade Bottle’s fragrance** ascends; the **Lantern’s glow** shines bright. The **Bamboo and Willow** halls teach dual paths; the **Square and Round** schools coexist. All **attain Pure Mind**, yet **Body’s impurities** remain. **With and Without** intertwine—**Refined yet Unadorned**. You are **Named the Void Sovereign**, your **Law** the **True Awakening**. **Medicinal Proofs** reveal your **Substance’s Luminosity**; **Zen Insight** awakens your **Enlightened Penetration**. Your **Flight** brings **Reverence and Joy**; your **Grasping the Shadow** bears the **Rainbow’s Glow**. You **Dispel Suffering** and **Return Clarity**, **Restore Hearing**. **Things speak of your Power**; **I see no merit in myself**. The **Confusion of Past and Present** swirls boundless—**Yin and Yang** drift without end. The **Three Realms** deceive; the **Boat and Chasm** shift by themselves. **Coming, you respond**; **without deliberation, you act**. The **Tortoise’s Script** records this; **Humans and Celestials** bear witness.\n\n**Inscribed on the stele’s reverse**:\nThis stele was carved in **Liang Wùtóng Year 3 (542 CE)**, the **Year of the Tiger (Rényǒu)**, in **Metal and Stone**. By **Tang Dàlì Year 13 (778 CE)**, the **Year of the Horse (Wùwǔ)**, **266 years** had passed, and the text was fading. **Mountain Surname Liu**, styled **Míngsù**, of **Zhongshān**, re-carved it.\n\n**Huayang Hermit Tao Hongjing**, a native of **Jiānlíng’s Xi Xiāng Xiālǐ in Danyang**, was born on the **Summer Solstice**, just before dawn, in the **Year of the Monkey (Bingshēn)**, **Song Xiàojiàn Year 3 (456 CE)**. He served as **Attendant Reader** to the **Princes of Qi** under **High Emperor Gao** and was **Enfeoffed in Court**. In **Yǒngmíng Year 10 (492 CE)**, the **Year of the Monkey (Rénshēn)**, he resigned, retreated to the mountains, and resided on **Middle Teachings Peak**, establishing himself as **Huayang Master**. By **Liang Tiānjiàn Year 4 (507 CE)**, he moved to **Jījīn’s Eastern Ravine**. In **Year 7**, he traveled to **Lóngjiāng’s Qingcháng Mountain** in **Yǒngjiā**. In **Year 10**, he crossed the sea to **Huòshān**. In **Year 11**, summer, he returned to **Mùliú Isle**. That October, he was **summoned by imperial decree** back to his ancestral mountain. In **Year 13**, January, he arrived at **Maoshan**, residing in the **Eastern Ravine**. In **Year 14**, winter, he relocated to this **Hall**.\n\nIn the **Fifteenth Year**, he moved to the **Yùgāng Retreat Hall**, residing in **Jìngzhài**. Among those present were:\n\n- **Huàyáng**’s former **Guàn** Master, **Hàojùn**’s **Hǎiyán** resident **Lù Yìchōng** (a **Shàngqīng** disciple),\n- **Zōngyuán**’s former **Guàn** Master, **Dōnghǎi**’s **Kè County** resident **Yáng Chāoyuǎn** (a **Shàngqīng** disciple),\n- **Jūyáng**’s **Guàn** Master, **Dānyáng**’s **Húqú** resident **Pán Yuānwén** (a **Shàngqīng** disciple),\n- **Huàyáng**’s former **Guàn** Master, **Jìnlíng**’s **Dīng Jǐngdá** (a **Shàngqīng** disciple),\n- **Huàyáng**’s former **Guàn** Master, **Jìnlíng**’s **Féng Fǎmíng** (a **Shàngqīng** disciple),\n- **Sìzhēn Guàn** Master, **Dānyáng**’s **Jùróng** resident **Xǔ Língzhēn** (a **Shàngqīng** disciple),\n- **Sìmíngshān**’s **Guàn** Master, **Kuàijī**’s **Shānyīn** resident **Pán Wénshèng** (a **Shàngqīng** disciple),\n- **Tàipíngshān**’s **Guàn** Master, **Hàojùn**’s **Qiántáng** resident **Zhuó Zhòngyǎn** (a **Shàngqīng** disciple),\n\nas well as the following **royalty and officials**:\n- **Qí Shìzǔ Wǔ Huángdì**,\n- **Tàizōng Míng Huángdì**,\n- **Héngyáng Wang Xiāo Jūn**,\n- **Yángzhōu Cìshì Shǐ’ān Wang Xiāo Yáoguāng**,\n- **Jīngzhōu Cìshì Wén Xiàn Gōng Xiāo Yáoxīn**,\n- **Shàngshū Lìng Tàizǐ Shàobǎo Dānyáng Yǐn Jiànchāng Hóu Shěn Yuē**,\n- **Kāifú Yídóng Sānshì Píng Gù Zhōngjìng Gōng Lǚ Sēngzhēn**,\n- **Shìzhōng Lìbù Shàngshǒu Hǎoxīng Tàigōng Xiè Lǎn**,\n- **Nánbiāngzhōu Cìshì Yùzhāng Wáng Sīmǎ Jìyán**,\n- **Jiāozhōu Cìshì Shǐxīng Wáng Sīmǎ Ruǎn Yán**,\n- **Línhǎi Tàigōng Fú Mǎnróng**,\n- **Jìn’ān Tàigōng Xiè Dá**,\n- **Jìnxī Tàigōng Jì Sēngméng**,\n- **Liáng Wǔ Huángdì**,\n- **Tàiyè Yángzhōu Cìshì Línchuān Wáng Xiāo**,\n- **Kāifú Yídóng Sānshì Nánpíng Wáng Xiāo Wěi**,\n- **Nánpíng Wáng Shìzǐ Xiāo Ké**,\n- **Shìzhōng Yùzhāng Nèishǐ Tàiyè Chángshǐ Xiè Jǔ**,\n- **Línchuān Zhèngshìzǐ Qián Lóupíng Hóu Xiāo Lìzhèng**,\n- **Tíngwèi Qīng Yú Quán**.\n\nThese were **kings, nobles, court officials, and governors of two thousand**—those who in the past or present received **Dao/Way** teachings and scriptures.\n\nRecorded briefly on the **Fifth Day of the Fifth Month, Tǒngpǔ Year 3 (522 CE)**.\n\nThe **Records of Maoshan** conclude here, **Volume Twenty**.\n\n「#1*Yè* [笪本作『日』]: **Day**\n#2*Jié* [关]: **Rectified** [or *Zhí* [直]]\n#3*Jié* [戒]: **Doubtful, perhaps should be『结』** [Bound/Joined]\n#4*Yáo* [遥]: **Dao/Way** [原作『道』，据笪本改]\n#5*Shì* [正]: **Succeeded** [原作『王』，据笪本改]\n#6*Mó* [谟]: **Model** [笪本作『模』]\n#7*Sǐ* [孙]: **Nephew** [笪本作『侄』]\n\n**Volume Twenty-One of the Records of Maoshan**\nComposed by **Succeeded Master of Shangqing, Liú Dàbīn**\nRecorded in the **Gold and Stone Section**\n**Records of Liang**\n**Inscription for Master Táo of Zhúyáng’s Precious Retreat**\nComposed by **Emperor of Liang**\n\nIn the **Tàihé** era, there was **Xǔ Yuǎn**, a wandering traveler, who was a **cherished friend of Yúnxiāo** and a **refined guest of Tàixū**. The Master’s conduct was as precise as a square and round, his footsteps truly followed the **Dao/Way** of the noble. Before the foundations were laid, he had already raised the structure. Towering heights defied measure, allowing one to gaze upon the **Flying Star** through the windows; lofty arches soared, leaning upon the balustrades to behold the **rising sun**. The cascading waters formed a boundary along the **Dao/Way**, like the **Celestial River**’s horizontal waves; striking the rocks, they rose as clouds, as if **odd peaks** emerged from their **recesses**. The inscription reads:\n\n> *He began in profound silence,*\n> *Yet transformed into harmony and praise.*\n> *Though his body was entrusted to the outer realm,*\n> *His heart aligned with the **Dao/Way** of chaos.*\n> *He adhered to the **Dao/Way** and followed **virtue/power**,*\n> *Thus accumulating sincere devotion.*\n> *He looked back to Fénshè,*\n> *And inquired through distant seals.*\n> *The retreat of Zhúyáng flourished,*\n> *The pavilions of **virtue/power** rose in splendor.*\n> *The quiet terrace crowned the moon,*\n> *The light **#2** pavilion welcomed the wind.*\n> *Gazing at the dawn’s lofty branches,*\n> *Lost in misty heights, his elegance refined.*\n> *His vision spanned the mountains and rivers,*\n> *Surveying the **imperial capital** and lands beyond.*\n> *Emerald ridges stretched a thousand peaks,*\n> *Clear streams flowed through ten thousand valleys.*\n> *Shadows fell upon layered cliffs,*\n> *Grace blossomed in hidden recesses.*\n\n**Inscription for the Longshà Retreat of Máo Mountain**\nComposed by **Táo Yǐnjū of Huáyáng**\n\nThe myriad phenomena of the cosmos, though vast and intricate, do not exceed the realm of **Yīn** and **Yáng**. The hundred teachings, though diverse, do not surpass the boundaries of the **Three Teachings**. Those who adorn their **Dao/Way** with rituals and propriety confine themselves to the **inner chambers** of the court; those of upright character abandon their **flags and banners** in the **mountainous wilderness**. The inscription reads:\n\n> *Great is the **Primordial Dao/Way** of Heaven,*\n> *All things derive their origin from it.*\n> *When the **Sovereign Kings** receive their mandate,*\n> *The **Three Powers** are thereby harmonized.*\n> *Only the **sage** perceives the **spirit**,*\n> *Only the **spirit** bestows blessings.*\n> *His **virtue/power** shines in songs and bells,*\n> *His name is recorded in **maps and histories**.*\n> *He cherished his brothers as friends,*\n> *With reverence for **Xī Xuān**.**\n> *His words followed the **flourishing deeds** of the past,*\n> *His actions honored the **legacy of his ancestors**.*\n> *He dared to follow ancient customs,*\n> *Yet innovated among the **mixed teachings**.*\n> *Engraved on stone, it shall not decay,*\n> *Its fragrance will endure through generations.*\n\n**Inscription for the Qǔlín Retreat of Máo Mountain**\nComposed by **Táo Yǐnjū of Huáyáng**\n\nLayered ridges stood outside,\nDeep halls reflected within,\nSlanted caves connected nearby,\nCoiling springs mirrored afar.\nHe aspired to **virtue/power** and leaned on **ren**,\nPraying for life and **virtue/power**’s command,\nBetween **Heaven** and **Earth**,\nLike the **ordinary** and the **sage**.\nRoofs aligned with lofty branches,\nEach declared their understanding of the **Dao/Way**.\nAscending the **ancient paths** of **Jīngwèi**,\nClimbing the rocks, his words refined.\nWho could rival **Qǔlín**?\nOnly it stood as the **most robust and splendid**.\nConcealing his nearness, he **refined his skill**,\nGuarding this place until his **end of life**.\nThe **true handwriting** of **Huáyáng’s recluse** remains.\n\n**Note on the Original Handwriting of Emperor Yuǎndì:**\nWhen **Emperor Yuǎndì** was still a **feudal prince**, he sent the inscription to the mountain, which still remains in the **Zhúyáng’s retreat**.\n\nAdditionally, there was the **Longyuǎn retreat** constructed by **Nánpíng Wáng Xiāo Wěi**, where **Hóngjǐng’s** disciple **Xuān Qīngyuǎn** resided. **Xuān** was the **Master of the Dao/Way** named **Fǎxián**, the **missing two characters** being his teacher. When the **Master of Xuān** first entered the mountain, he composed a poem:\n\n> *In the cold valley as morning approaches,*\n> *I seek both the **scenic beauty** and the **true Dao**.*\n> *The square altar is shaded by dense leaves,*\n> *The water reveals the **scarlet scales** of fish.**\n> *Though the **peach grove** may shelter beasts,*\n> *The **mushroom fields** await the **worthy**.*\n> *Once the **elixir** is refined, the **stones** will transform,*\n> *When the **furnace** changes, the **silver** will melt.*\n> *Know that this **victorious place** is distant,*\n> *Here, one is **free from worldly dust**.*\n\n**Emperor Zhāo Líng Wáng** once entered **Máo Mountain** to seek **Xuān Qīngyuǎn**, and inscribed a poem on the wall:\n\n> *The **Jīngmén** hills and valleys are many,*\n> *The **wine jar**’s window lets in **wind and clouds**.*\n> *Unless one harbors the **recluse’s spirit**,*\n> *Who can endure the **dew and frost**?’\n\nIn the **west of Zhúyáng’s retreat**, there was also the **Longshà retreat** constructed by **Longshà’s Succeeded King**, whose foundations still remain. **Liáng Chāng Hóu** also erected a **stone stele**, with **Hóngjǐng** composing the inscription, now also found in **Zhúyáng’s retreat**.\n\nTwo miles north, there is the residence of the **recluse Zhōu Hóngràng**. On **Léipíng Mountain**, there is a spring named **Liǔgǔ Jì**, also called **Tián Gōng Quán**. According to the *Máo Transmission*, it states: *On the left of the mountain, the spring is named Liǔgǔ; on the west of the ridge, it is called Yánggǔ.* In the past, **Tián Shū** resided here and drew water, thus naming it. This spring is the **Yùjīn Shā** water, which benefits one’s health. Today, its water is so pure that **clothes washed in it do not require ash**.\n\n**Hóngjǐng’s stone ode reads:**\n\n> *To the left, the **Liǔgǔ** spring flows,*\n> *To the right, the **Yánggǔ** spring rises.*\n> *The earth cradles the **north’s dark hues**,\n> *The well yields the **wind’s gate spring**.*\n\nThere was also the **Guō Yú** pool. In the past, the **Yān brothers**—**Guō Cháo** and his three siblings—all claimed to have **attained the Dao**, and they also held **official positions in the cavern**. **Guō Cháo** was the eldest, and when he first arrived at the mountain, he cultivated here, naming the pool **Yú** as an omen of this **auspicious sign**.\n\nA **stone carving** of **Táo Yǐnjū’s** earlier **small portrait** was initially hidden in the **house of Jiàn’ān Xú Hóng**. In the **Xuánhé Year 12 (1120 CE)** of the **Song Dynasty**, the **Daoist** **Fāng Nánhúá** copied and engraved it, passing it down through generations.\n\n**Huáyáng’s recluse taught his disciples, Lù Jìngyóu, with ten responsibilities.**\n**Táo Yǐnjū’s** **Master** dispatched his **senior attendant disciple** **Dài Tǎn**, who carried **a bamboo tablet and a writing brush**, kneeling to impart the ** Dao/Way** to his **junior disciple** **Lù Jìngyóu of Wújùn**, establishing a **settlement of connected stones** as a **place for dwelling in tranquility**. The **inscription on the tablet** reads:\n\n> *O, respectful Jìngyóu!*\n> *In the past, I served in the **imperial court’s** chambers,*\n> *Attending the **sprouts and dishes** of the **Liáng** court.*\n> *Though close to the **mixed teachings**’s path,*\n> *My heart yearned for the **recluse’s realm**,*\n> *Never forgetting the **dawn and night**’s aspiration for **Máo and Jǐng**.*\n>\n> *Years have deepened,*\n> *Yet **virtue/power** remains nearby.*\n> *The **wind and clouds** gather,*\n> *As you arrive, two springs have passed.*\n>\n> *Thus, I remove my **official belt** from the **blue steps**,*\n> *Hang my **hat** at the **red gate**,*\n> *Clasping hands, I drive eastward,*\n> *Founding a residence on these ridges.*\n> *The **veins and moisture** of the land connect with the waters,*\n> *Moving stones to lay the foundations,*\n> *Ascending cliffs to sever the **dry branches**,*\n> *Crossing mounds to bear the **plants**.*\n> *My strength was exhausted in climbing and building,*\n> *My **qi** and blood fatigued from rushing and walking.*\n> *My skin and flesh grew emaciated,*\n> *Yet I did not grieve at the **harsh exposure**.*\n> *My **spirit** and soul were light and empty,*\n> *Would I care about the **hardships of hunger and cold**?*\n>\n> *The halls and dwellings now stand,*\n> *Enduring the **frost and heat** of the seasons.*\n> *Seven years have passed,*\n> *The initial construction has just been completed.*\n\n**For the Ten Gifts:**\n\n> *Today’s tranquility is due to your diligence.*\n> *A gentleman does not hoard his honors alone,*\n> *And a virtuous person must share prosperity with all.*\n> *Thus, I bestow upon you the **Long Alley** in the North Ridge,*\n> *A land of piled gold and linked stone,*\n> *Square in measure, seventy

*And reveal your devotion to the **Heavenly Masters**.*\n\n> *Seventh, you purify your form and store your essence,*\n> *Having set aside **meat and grain**.*\n> *You proclaim the **virtues of

Zhenbai’s** name was **Hongjing**, with the courtesy name **Tongming**, originally from **Pingyang in Ji Province**.\n\nHis ancestors descended from **Emperor Yao’s** **Tao-Tang lineage**,\nFor Yao ruled **Ji Province’s** **Pingyang**,\nAnd thus they settled there.\nWhen the **dragon horse** beheld the **Five-Colored Auspicious Symbols**,\nAnd the **reverent and bright** displayed the **Eight Auspicious Patterns**,\nTheir **radiance** spread across the **lands**,\nTheir **virtue** extended to all **officials**.\nTheir **grand lineage** stretched far and wide,\nTheir **ties** unbroken and long.\nWhen the **Han Dynasty** arose,\nHe served as **Emperor Gaozu’s** **Right General of the Palace**.\nHis son, **Qingzhi**, rose to the rank of **Chancellor**.\nIn the late **Eastern Han**, after migrating south,\nThey first resided in **Danyang**.\nHis seventh-generation ancestor, **Jun**, served under **Emperor Wu of Jin** as **General Pacifying the South** and **Magistrate of Xing Prefecture**.\nHis grandfather, **Long**, was a **Military Advisor to the Southern Commander** in the **Song Dynasty**.\nHis father, **Zhenbao**, held the posts of **Secretary of State** and **Attendant to the Prince of Jian’an**.\nAll bore **clean and upright conduct**,\nAnd were **well-versed in literature and history**.\n\nMaster **Hongjing** possessed the **harmonious breath of primordial essence**,\nAnd bore the **elegant bearing of the lofty winds**.\nHe encompassed the **Seven Virtues**,\nAnd cultivated the **Nine Powers**.\nHe walked the **Dao of Benevolence** and trod the **Path of Righteousness**,\nLike a **mountain standing firm** and a **pool abiding deep**,\nWhose **height** cannot be measured,\nWhose **depth** cannot be fathomed.\nHis **Dao** soared as high as the **Milky Way**,\nHis **noble spirit** extended as far as the **celestial clouds**.\n\nAt **six years old**, he already understood **writing**,\nAnd could compose **prose**.\nBy **seven**, he had read **thousands of words** from the *Scripture on Filial Piety*, the *Analects*, and the *Mao Commentary on the Odes*.\nFrom a young age, he **delighted in** the **classics**,\nAnd as a boy, he **recited** **poetry and prose**.\nCompared to the **ancients**, they would have **much to be ashamed of**,\nThus he **doubted his own worth** and **praised others**.\nBecause of this, he **withdrew from public life** and **composed odes**.\n\nThere was a **villager** who obtained **Ge Hong’s** *Transmission of the Immortals*,\nAnd read of the **Eight Worthies of Huainan** and other **sages’** deeds,\nThen sighed, saying: *\"Reading this book gives one **the spirit of soaring above the clouds**.\"*\nFrom then on, he **studied it night and day**,\nWithout pause from **dawn to dusk**.\n\nAt **twenty-seven**, he became **Attendant Scholar to the Prince of Yi**,\nAnd **supervised the Palace Archives**.\n\nThe Prince sought worthy men, and the imperial gardens summoned scholars—\nthe court found no fault in its selection, for all who came were men of worth.\nObscured though Oblique’s literary skill might be, it could not rival the balance of a scribe,\nNor could Sun Chu’s eloquence suffice to bear the weight of his reputation.\nIn the Qi dynasty, there was a fondness for grand palaces—\nnow the Prince was restoring the old gardens of Qingxi, rebuilding and expanding them,\nand submitting a petition with a commemorative ode.\nThe work was splendid and refined—\nhis poem of joyful service matched the brilliance of the *Jingfu* edicts.\n\nThe Emperor read it for a long time and deemed it excellent,\nthen granted him the title of *Deliberative Attendant at Court*.\nHe took up his post with solemn duty,\never vigilant from dawn to dusk,\nattending the spring and autumn audiences—\nthis was the way of the unadorned and sincere.\n\nThe Master had never sought honor,\nyet often wished to resign.\nHe wrote to his kin and friends:\n*\"In my earlier years, I never wished to be asked by others.\"*\nAt forty, he fulfilled his ambition in the mountains and forests.\nNow thirty-six, time would not wait—\nhow divine was his foresight!\nWhy should he torment himself further?\n\nThe following year, he submitted his resignation,\nbundling his hairpins and departing beyond the city gates,\nuntying his official sash at the northern slopes of the mountains,\njoining the recluses of Jiqiu, emulating Liu Bang’s refusal of grain,\nand preparing his boat for departure.\nThe court sent inquiries, and scholars saw him off with two *cushion essays* and four *hidden verses*—\nhis departure was as effortless as that of the ancients, though from a different age.\n\nHe set out with staff in hand, wandering through famous peaks,\nuntil he reached Jurong and ascended Maoling—\nthis place was the abode of immortals, a sacred refuge of marvels.\nOnce entered, none returned.\nHe settled there and made it his home.\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"The Master said: ‘Retire to seek one’s purpose, act with virtue to fulfill the Way.’\nI have heard these words but never seen such a man.\nNow my virtue is fulfilled—\nthere is no need for further retreat.\nI ask only to join those who seek their purpose,\nthus I call myself a recluse,\nfollowing Zhi Chan’s *Embrace of Simplicity* and Shi An’s *Mystic Tranquility*.\"\n\nLeaning against cliffs, dwelling in shadows,\nnesting among trees, hiding at the forest’s edge,\nweaving branches into a dwelling, carving a path as his gate,\nfacing cascades from sheer precipices, gazing upon mist-laden woods,\ndeep gorges and steep peaks—\nthe mists entwined like silken threads,\nhis pillow a stone, his cup the stream.\nMountain birds did not disturb him,\nand as he gathered herbs, wild beasts did not dare approach.\nHe wandered freely, unbound by the world,\nhis spirit untouched, as if severed from mortal cares.\n\nWhen the Qi dynasty declined and the Mandate of Heaven faltered,\nthe land of water trembled in Jiachen—\nthe Master, pondering omens, foresaw the signs.\nThus, he cut off all correspondence, near and far.\n*\"I have heard of Xia Fu in the past,\nbut now I see it in you, Master.\"*\n\nThe great fortune of Dai Liang was at hand,\nthe Mandate of Heaven clear—\nthe Three Stars shone bright, the Four Seas at peace.\nThe Master submitted a petition in celebration,\nand his letters were once more answered.\n\nSince the *Tianjian* era, he was repeatedly summoned with imperial edicts,\nsupplied with medicines and provisions without end,\nand showered with seasonal favors unmatched by any other.\nFor seven years, he briefly visited Nan Yue.\n\nThis mountain—\nthe pivot of the *Biwei* winds, the celestial support of Kunlun,\noverlooking the Eight Directions, between the Nine Regions—\nits trees bore fangs of jade, its grasses sprouted chariots.\nDetached from the world, he lingered, forgetting to return.\n\nIn the eleventh year, an imperial envoy, the Left Secretary of State Huiming,\nwas sent to summon the Master back to Maoshan,\ngranting him a residence to dwell in.\n*\"Like Xuān Zhong descending to serve the Heavenly Old Man,\nor the Han Emperor honoring the River Master—\nhow could I refuse such an honor today?\"*\n\nNurturing his purpose amid mountains and rivers,\nhe spent many years refining his life,\nhis vitality preserved, divine omens descending—\nno fierce beast dared approach, no demons or spirits encountered him.\nThorns did not grow in his courtyard,\nhis neighbors were as distant as the *Que* enclave,\nhis steps emitted divine springs,\nand distant cedars swayed in response.\nThus, feathered immortals lingered,\ncelestial guests ascended and descended,\ncranes and phoenixes gathered,\nand the *zhi* and *ying* mushrooms flourished in abundance.\n\nIn the second year of *Dà Tóng* (429 CE),\nin the year *Bingchen*, on the first day of the third month,\nthe twelfth day, *Gengchou*,\nhe bade farewell and departed—\naged eighty-one.\n\nThe Emperor mourned his loss, the Crown Prince lamented in verse,\nand an edict praised his virtues,\nposthumously granting him the title *Great Scattered Official*,\nwith the epithet *Zhenbái Master*—\nthis was the proper honor.\n\nOn the fourteenth of that month, his remains were interred at *Leiping Mountain* in Jurong County, Danyang.\n*\"Like Yellow Emperor’s burial in his robes,\nor Zi Qiao’s hidden sword in the crow’s nest—\ntoday, this may be compared.\"*\n\nThe Master’s bearing was profound and reserved,\nhis thoughts precise and far-reaching,\nhis words pure and auspicious,\nyet he never sought to polish his edges.\nThough his years approached mid-life,\nhe was not bound by rigid measures—\nhis brows and eyes were clear and bright,\nhis demeanor fresh and unblemished.\nHe shunned public office, yet his deeds were kind,\ntreasuring light and shadow, loving the classics,\nfirm in resolve, his virtue unyielding to old age.\n\nAs for the *Huainan* secrets of vast treasures,\nthe *Longxi* earthquake divinations,\nthe *Taiyi* elusion charts,\nthe *Nine Chapters* of calendrical omens,\nYòuān’s swift silver-hook calligraphy,\nYǔn’s mastery of the *Fēngjiǎo* divinations,\nthe *Taicang* prescriptions of the *Suwen*,\nand Zhōngsǎn’s *Lüting* music—\nhe had gathered them all,\nmastering each with precision.\n\nMoreover, in *Yìshè* archery, *Qúnqí* chess,\n*Sū* divination, and *Guān* milfoil readings—\nhe understood them instantly, without effort.\n\nLike Zhang Hua’s encyclopedic knowledge,\nMa Jun’s ingenious schemes,\nLiu Xiang’s discernment of subtleties,\nand Ge Hong’s cultivation of nature—\nhe encompassed all these virtues in one.\n\nHis disciples, including Huàn Fǎyuàn,\nadmired his distant reputation at Wéishì,\nand cherished his legacy at Qiáoyáng,\nerecting a black stone stele to inquire of him,\nsoaring to the crimson clouds where his fragrance lingers.\n\nThus, they composed this epitaph:\n\n*\"The crow departs, his transformation remains,\nthe sword is hidden, his spirit congeals.\nHe lingers in the purple mists,\nilluminating the vermilion woods.\nHis presence lingers near,\nhis teachings endure.\nWho shall inherit this?\nAh, the profound and virtuous man!\n\nHis conduct surpasses the lineage,\nhis virtue renews each day.\nBright as a suspended mirror,\nprofound as the upright bamboo.\nHis body fulfilled the Great Way,\nhis actions never strayed from humanity.\n\nOnce he wandered in silk and jade,\nnow his spirit soars divine.\nWeary of salvation’s toil,\nexhausted by the seekers’ quest.\"*\n\n---\n**Epitaph (as inscribed):**\n*\"The crow departs, his transformation remains,\nthe sword is hidden, his spirit congeals.\nHe lingers in the purple mists,\nilluminating the vermilion

valleys,\nhigh he treads the winds and dust.\nHis heart knows no lingering in the world,\nhis retreat hides no truth.\n\nHe builds his dwelling on lofty cliffs,\nchoosing a home where grasses flourish thickly.\nLike ice and jade, his years endure,\nhis essence unaging, pure and bright.\n\nThen came his fame, his virtue renowned,\nhonored in life, his years extended long.\n\nWhite waters flow past his courtyard,\nprecarious peaks loom o’er his grotto.\nDew clings to the lotus steps,\nwhile fragrant blossoms bloom by the bay.\n\nSun slants on the eaves’ shadowed seat,\nflowers drift down past the window’s frame.\nYet peace remains not distant,\nnor does the noble son turn back in vain.\n\nThe sea’s pines shift and change their hue,\nwhile ridges and valleys trade their rise and fall.\nBut steadfast stands his monument,\nhis fragrance eternal, through the ages all.\n\n---\n\n**Epitaph for the Hermit of Huayang**\nComposed by Liang’s Prince of Zhaoming\n\nIn the second year of

*Hóngjǐng*,\nunderwent his final transformation at the *Máoshān* Hall of Zhuyang.\n\nThe Master, surname *Huá*, given name *Yáng*,\naged eighty-one in years,\nyet moved as usual, his countenance unchanged.\n\nBy decree, he was posthumously granted the title of *Zhōngsàn Dàfū*,\nand honored as the *Zhēn Bái* Master.\n\nEnvoys were dispatched to oversee his funeral rites,\nand on the fourteenth day, his remains were interred at *Léipíng*’s mountain.\n\n---\n\nIf one seeks the Way,\ntruth lies in its boundless void.\nHe knew not to rejoice in life,\nfor great virtue is the life itself.\nHe knew not to fear death,\nfor *Gǔshén* abides unvanquished.\n\nWondrous indeed!\nHidden and revealed, his transformations—\nnone can fathom their design.\nThen lo, the cliffs split open,\nheaven sent down a jade coffin,\nsilver script inscribed on the tablets,\npearls strung like beads, the tortoise’s writing ceased.\nHis ninefold *qi* ascended to the celestial midheaven,\nhis thousandfold essence burned beneath the earth.\n\nThe *xiān* officials rejoiced in their gain,\nwhile those who studied him mourned the loss of *Kōnggǔ*.\n\nI once dwelt in the dusty world,\nearly encountering the arts of the *yǐ*’s ruins.\nNow, in this humble hall,\nI’ve often observed the teachings of the floating mounds,\nholding his talismans, my heart aches,\nthinking of his alchemical staff, my sorrow deepens.\n\nThus I compose this epitaph:\n\nThe Dao unnamed, its immortality is *xiān*.\nYet there was *Yuánfàng*,\nalso called *Zhìchuān*.\nHe cast off form, dissolved his *qi*,\nas has been since ancient times.\n\nOh, splendid Master!\nYour records were received, your spirit returned to the void.\n\nThe *Lí* tradition passed to the *Yuàn* clerk,\nthe scrolls entrusted to the *Jiǎ* boatman.\n\nThe tiger chariot glows with spring’s light,\nyour final transformation ascends beyond mortal ties.\n\nHis flowers blaze with radiance,\nhis spring brook murmurs softly.\nLush are the

Stone**\n\n**Tang Dynasty Stele**\n\n**Established by the Tang Master of the Dao, Ascended True Lord, Wang Fǎzhǔ (True Person)**\n\n**Inscription on the Stele of the Observing Hall:**\n\nThe Heavenly Virtue is vast and universal,\nIts nurturing begins without fail.\nHuman nature is rooted in inherent wisdom,\nYet knowledge grows with exposure to the Dao.\n\nThus, when one is diligent in practice, even a hundred [years] are insufficient,\nAnd when one is at ease in practice, all things labor to fulfill their potential.\nNone are more revered than the cauldron of refined gold,\nNor more honored than the dwelling of the Sage.\nThe green robe is humbled by the frost’s touch,\nThe white hair is perfected by the mountain’s embrace.\n\nYet, fearing the swiftness of the path,\nHow could one be content with mere wandering?\nThe wind-swept leaves forget their drifting,\nThe willow’s branches recall their ancient roots.\n\nEven if one hangs a curtain at the tips of the branches,\nOne will still fail to reach the sacred shore.\nThough one rides a lofty chariot and mounts a spirited steed,\nCrossing towering peaks, none surpass this Master’s attainment.\n\nThe Perfect Sage responds to the world,\nActing without remaining in it.\nWith extended hand and wet foot,\nHe rescues the drowning and saves the burning.\nHe purifies the nature stained by defilement,\nAnd restores the path once lost to confusion.\nHe establishes gates and barriers,\nAnd proposes the vessel of compassion for those crossing perilous waters,\nIlluminates the lamp of wisdom in the darkest nights.\n\nWhen he departs in emptiness,\nHe abides in true knowledge.\nClad in hemp and embroidered with orchids,\nHe devours the rainbow and consumes the moon.\nTreading the red steps to expound boundless wonders,\nPushing aside the jade gates to spread the mysterious winds,\nHe follows the old traces of the Pasture Platform,\nAnd treads the ancient paths of the Mountain of Speech.\nHis achievements rival those of the Tortoise Peak,\nHis wisdom flows with the vastness of the Boiling Sea.\nHis principles transcend all names,\nHis deeds forget all titles—\nEnduring, vast, splendid, and magnificent!\n\n**Wang Fǎzhǔ**, surnamed **Wang**, with the given name **Yuǎnzhī**,\nCourtesy name **Guǎngdé**, was a native of **Lángyá Lín’yí** (now Linyi, Shandong).\n\nHis humble origins were in **Zhōukǒu** near the border,\nYet his name was recorded in the registers of the **Upper Guest** (the celestial bureaucracy).\nHis lineage was not the same as the **Xué** clan,\nYet his fame was entrusted to the **Píngyú** gate.\n\nHis words fell like gentle rain,\nHis voice commanded the long wind.\nThe Dao has no fixed vessel,\nYet its principles are ever constant—\nThus he concealed his wisdom in the depths of the mountains,\nAnd his influence spread far beyond the peaks.\nThere were marvels in **Yè Xiàn**,\nAnd echoes in the **Léimén** gate.\n\n[His name] was known in the world,\nAnd the **Earl of the Stage** treasured his singularity.\n[He] was trusted in times of peace,\nAnd the **Lord of the Dao** valued his subtle guidance.\n\nHence, the hundred streams gathered in abundance,\nTheir waters stretching boundless as the **Cāngqí** (Azure River);\nThe piled stones knew no end,\nOnly the mountains reached the heavens’ height.\n\nThe **Master of the Dao**’s grandfather, **Jǐngxián**, was the **Earl of the Northern Expedition** of Liang and the **Prefect of Jiangzhou**.\n\nHis father, **Tánxuǎn**, served as **Attendant of the Coursiers**, **Commandant of the Right Guard of the Prince**, **General of Light Cavalry**, **Earl of Chariots of Chen**, **Prefect of Yangzhou**, and **Marquis of Jiàn’ān**, with a fief of three thousand households and a full complement of **drums and pipes**. He bore twenty **swordsmen**, his **bearing and demeanor** were noble and refined, his **shoulders and chest** adorned with splendor, his **movements** set with propriety—his **awe-inspiring presence** was ever apparent.\n\nThe **Master of the Dao** **calmed five rocks** in his birthplace, **repaid three fields** to the **Ministry of Rites**, and **descended the spirit** to nurture **wondrous qi**. He **underwent alchemy** and bathed in the **Lan Pool**, **sipping** its **fragrant essence**, while the **Two Compendia** bestowed their **pure teachings**. He **gazed at the Gate of Virtue** and **pointed directly**, and **curled in the Hall of Clouds** to **manifest brilliance**. His mother, **Lady Dīng of Jìyāng**, was **gentle in virtue and adorned with beauty**, **long held in divine friendship**, and **forever attuned to auspicious omens**. Once, while resting by day, she **dreamed a phoenix gathered her**, and upon waking, saw **red light piercing her breast**, thus **conceiving in wonder**. In seven days, she **wept in labor**, her cries heard beyond the chamber, and after a brief **selection of auspicious time**, she **gave birth**.\n\nIn ancient times, **Hàolíng** received **divine blessings**, and **her lineage was traced to the Heavenly Phoenix** through **Lady Wěiyīng**. The **Pillar of History** marked the **flowing sands**, and **its essence was entrusted to the Mysterious and Marvelous**. **Omens of joy** soared high, and **sacred glory** ascended near. **Radiant light** shone forth externally, **proclaiming the transmission of fire** in advance; **hopeful sounds** resounded within, **hearing the guidance of customs** first.\n\nThen, **divine decree descended from heaven**, and he **inherited profound knowledge** from **fragile roots**. The **Dao** **was embraced without words**, and he **fulfilled its essence** in **hidden teachings**. His **filial piety and brotherly devotion** were **fathomless**, his **care for the aged** knew no bounds, his **achievements towered** like **dryad pillars**, his **affections surpassed** the **healthful envy** of the virtuous. With **humble submission to the teachings of the learned**, he **mastered the classics**, **reciting threefold the urgent admonitions of the Zhou**, **transmitting the fourfold poetry of the Ru**, **wearing the leather-bound notes of Kāngchéng**, and **listening to the bamboo and silk of Jìzhǎng**. His **age and eloquence** rivaled the **Three Ancients**, his **lyre and zither** harmonized with the **Hundred Schools**, his **jade writings** were **highly esteemed**, his **golden compositions** **won renown**, his **illuminating words** **outshone the mirror**, his **radiant discourse** **surpassed the clarity of flowing streams**.\n\nThus, he **deeply rejected worldly entanglements**, **early cultivated disdain for dust**. He **loved the net of silence**, **held fast to the emptiness of mortal concerns**, and **gazed at the Mysterious Pass** to **draw a single breath**, **ascending to the Azure Expanse** and **soaring far**. At that time, there was the **National Teacher, Master Zōngdào**, who **discerned the profound and subtle**, **delved deeply into the Mysterious and Marvelous**, **proclaimed the winds of the Yellow Path**, and **composed the instructions of the Purple Court**. The **Nine Palaces** paid homage, the **Hundred Craftsmen** **revered him**, and he **fasted and crafted his steps** in **wondrous simplicity**.\n\nThe **Master of the Dao**, with **two washings of his body in the Dao-wind**, **knowing the tenfold mysteries of the Hall**, **held the lamp’s reflection** beneath the **Jīng and Lán forests**, and **embraced the torch’s ascent** along the **shores of Suí and Hé**. His **dwelling became a void of nature**, his **wisdom deepened** with each **passage of time**, his **teachings** **spread without constraint**, and **his few words** **were ever resplendent**. His **reasoning reached the utmost subtlety**, and he **forgot spoken words** to **realize the Dao**; his **affections abandoned the path of the court**, and he **took the sun’s decline** as **virtue’s gain**.\n\nBy the time of his **coming-of-age**, he **devoutly cultivated the Supreme Way**, and **clouds floated in purple**, **dry cranes displayed their white**, **a tranquil drowsiness hung high**, and **his spirit wandered in distant realms**. The **Chief of Zhou’s Court** **divined the air**, and **his curses rivaled the worthy**; the **Wild of Jìn** **plucked the strings**, and **Zēng Hé** **held the reins**. This was **truly the broad and distant operation of the Mysterious Heart**, **divinely ordained** yet **silent in its marvels**, **auspicious omens** **emerging naturally**.\n\nThe **Master of the Dao** **turned his gaze** to **the myriad blossoms** and **pointed to the faithful**, **leaned on the dry spirit** to **embrace the divine**. Within, **struggle ceased**, and the **Dao prevailed**—**abandoning desires of the flesh**, **resting the wisdom of excessive knowledge**. The **Six Classics and Three Histories** **were cast aside** in his **net of abandonment**, and all that he **once studied** **was utterly forsaken**.\n\n**True colors** **responded naturally**, and he **indulged in the Mysterious Void**. He **expelled and inhaled the Six Palaces**, **discarded the Three Lands**, **erected his nest** **according to the Dao’s strictures**, and **strengthened his steps** **in the path of the Pure and Bright**. Thus, he **immediately began abstaining from grains**, **sustaining himself only on pine and water**.\n\n**The Six Dusts** **did not stain him**, and his **illuminated wisdom** **banished their mists**; **the Five Flavors** **were void by nature**, and his **enlightened discernment** **cut off their sweetness**. He **avoided sounds** **in the path of the silent**, and **extinguished his form** **in the domain of utter darkness**.\n\n**Huàshān’s Huáyáng Peak** was the **eighth of the Thirty-Six Palaces of Heaven**, its **peaks adorned with dragon script**, its **waters** **the phoenix’s gate**. He **ascended the Three Mountains** to **unite with the True**, **pondered the Five Conveniences** to **store the Sacred**, and **presented his petition** to the **court**, **requesting return to the rocks and valleys**. The **Yellow Gate’s Attendant, Hè Chè**, **delivered the imperial decree**, and he **continued his mountain retreat**, with all his needs **provided by the court**.\n\nWhen his **refined aspirations** were **granted**, his **secluded heart** **went alone**, **soaring above the vulgar**, **raising his hands to the times**. He **walked the path of the Sage’s ancestors**, **clothed in humble rags**, and **the Master of the Dao** **cast aside his hairpin** **with purpose**, **finally entrusting himself** to it. **Moisture pervaded the grasses and trees**, **light filled the forests and springs**, and he **swept the clouded paths** **with his feet**, **clasped the lofty branches** **to shift his gaze**. Though **golden brocade and drums** **blended in harmony**, his **solo tune** **was fresh and singular**; though **jade pipes** **played in time**, his **melody** **conveyed the refined essence**.\n\nWith the **Dao’s winds** **drifting far**, **his virtues surpassed** the **pine and cypress**; with **victorious joys** **surging forth**, **his solitude mirrored** the **marriage of the clouds**. How could **the vulgar** **disturb his purity**, or **the profane** **match his brilliance**? Thus, the **Sage’s Companion** **praised his lofty bearing**, and the **Cloud Immortal** **spoke of his distant essence**.\n\nYet when the **flags and banners** **sank to the south**, and the **rites and music** **returned to the west**, the **Master of the Dao** **nurtured his essence** **in the mountain’s heart**, **untouched by defilement**.\n\nIn the **twelfth year of the reign of Emperor Guāng of the Sui**, **Jìn Wáng** **divided the command** **of Shǎn and Wéi**, **honoring and elevating the Supreme Teaching**, **revering and savoring ancient models**. He **extended full rites** to **invite and welcome** the **Master of the Dao**.\n\nThe **Master of the Dao** **declined the summons**, **emerging from his mountain retreat**. The **high officials and royal princes** **in turn welcomed his movements**, **consulting his words**, and every time they **presented their questions**, the **Master of the Dao** **unleashed his boundless discourse**, **covering the present and the past**, and his **eloquence and meaning** **left nothing unexpressed**.\n\nHis **secluded aspirations** had their **origin**, and he **insisted on returning to the mountains**. The **Prince of Jìn** **heavily disregarded his resolve**, **dispatching envoys to escort him**. Thus, the **Master of the Dao** **retired to the cliffs of Tiānchuāng**, **hollowing out caves for meditation**, **rolling up his voice** **to the mountain’s edge**, **barely able to practice**.\n\nOn the **seventh night of the first month of the thirteenth year**, he **sat upright in meditation**, and **it seemed as though a man in crimson robes and feathered attire** **held a scepter and approached him**. The man said: *\"Hidden in the valleys, concealed by the rivers—your affairs are **self-cultivation alone**. Dwelling in the world, you **should broaden benefits**.\"*\n\n「Thus, he **valued the prestige of office and the cultivation of talent**, **appointing him as the teacher to enlighten one region**, **able to proclaim the taste of the Dao**, **and guide future disciples in their cultivation**. Having **received this divine decree**, he **first developed the resolve to benefit all beings**.\n\nThen, he **calmed the waters to mirror the myriad forms**, **refined the virtue of pine amidst the humble grass**, **expanded the profound mysteries**, and **elaborated on intricate principles**—**weighty, complex, and profound**—**to illuminate their hidden depths**; **without pride**, he **offered his modest vessels** to the **six incense burners and four censers**. At the **mountain gate**, **his name was recorded for over three thousand followers**, who **all established meditation halls**, **grand and splendid in their magnificence**. In the **nineteenth year**, the **vigorous sovereign** **Zheng** **sent the official Zhèng Zǐtēng** **with a letter to inquire**, **showing great respect and earnestness**, **truly descending from his carriage**.\n\nIn the **seventh year of the Great Business era**, the **Emperor Yáng** **sent the Gentleman-at-Arms and External Attendant Chuī Fèng** **to convey an imperial edict and summon him**, **meeting him at the Línshuò Palace in Zhè County**. The emperor **then sighed and said**: *\"In my earlier days in Yángzhou, the Master had already **manifested his virtue**. Now, seeing him again, he **still retains his youthful vigor**. Truly, it is because the **Dao abides within him**, and his **nurturing aligns with its principles**.\"*\n\nThe **six armies returned in triumph**, **escorting the imperial carriage to Luòyáng**. He **offered counsel on the rituals of sacrifice at Zhōngyuè**. Yet, the **flourishing virtue of the former dynasty declined**, **loyal and virtuous men perished**, **their aspirations distant and scattered**, **their choices straying from the orthodox**. The **divination of thirty black horses was in error**, the **precautions of five reversals were ignored**, and the **people suffered in misery**—**the Mandate of Heaven had its limits**.\n\nNow, the **auspicious era of the Great Tang flourished like the dragon’s rise**, and **the celestial omens took form**. The **August Sovereign succeeded in illuminating the Dao and governing all**, **bringing light to the abode of the Black Primordial**—**spanning heaven and earth**, **his words established the principles of governance**, **his deeds wove the threads of martial might**. His **divine strategies were vast and far-reaching**, his **Dao encompassed the thunderous clouds and radiant lightning**, **reviving the brilliance of the sun when it was obscured**, **restoring the stars of the Big Dipper as they were about to set**. The **cornerstone was laid**, the **foundations secured**, and **once again, the red carpet was spread**, **reverting to the sacred altars of sacrifice**. **Was it not the grandeur of the Tang that was unmatched**, **its grand decrees worthy of song**, **its virtue as lofty as clouds**, **its gates of doctrine through which all praise flowed**? **Who could attain such heights?**\n\nThus, he **made the heavens serene and the earth level**, **his martial achievements were as vast as those**, **his arms laid down, beasts returning to their wild state**—**his cultural virtue was no less**. **He could be compared to the Four Three Kings and Six Five Emperors**, **matching the Eastern Huò in reverence**, **and surpassing the Southern Fēng in solemnity**. **Auspicious signs appeared in the clouds and stars**, **omens of good fortune descended like silk**. The **individual springs offered wine**, the **luxuriant thorns bent in humility**, the **divine feast was attended by sacred guardians**, the **hallways gleamed with fragrant decorations**. **Majestic and awe-inspiring**, such **grandeur had never been seen before**. Yet, **the sovereign still lowered his heart and stirred his thoughts**, **his meals were modest despite his diligence**, **he restrained himself to ponder governance**, **his nightclothes worn with unwavering devotion**. His **benevolence towered like the vault of heaven**, his **favor permeated even the deepest springs**.\n\nThus, **the Master’s teachings flourished anew**. **He aspired to the ultimate mysteries of the Dao**, and in the past, **when he served as a regional official**, he **frequently received imperial inquiries**. The **Master of the Dao** **retired from the world**, **three times returning to the secular realm**, **his words silent among mortals**. **Yet, whenever he encountered one of the Dao**, **he knew the time for his rise had come**—**now, having met the Dragon’s Field**, he **understood the wings of his inevitable ascent**, **and the phoenix feathers he would soon claim**. Thus, he **gauged the momentum of the rising wind**, **his compassion guiding the first to awaken**, **his grace inviting the benevolent gifts of fate**. **Again and again, he submitted his petitions**, **begging to return beyond the rivers**.\n\nThe emperor **then decreed that Yùzhou provide supplies, men, and ships**, **and granted him Daoist robes**. He **urged the prefect of Róngzhou to build a temple on his former mountain**, **bestowing land**, and **ordaining seventy-seven Daoists** **to serve as his attendants**. In the **fourth month of the Zhenguān era’s ninth year**, the **Master of the Dao** **ascended the mountain**. The **Emperor** **sent the Astrologer-in-Chief Xuē Yǐng, the Palace Librarian Zhāng Dàoběn, and the Left Internal Attendant of the Crown Prince, Guàn Fǎsì**, **to deliver fragrant oils, protective talismans, a golden dragon, and a jade tablet** **to the temple**, **praying for the nation’s blessings**. He **again dispatched the Court Gentleman Xuē Wényuǎn** **with an imperial seal to offer consolation**, **along with sleeves of silk and a staff**.\n\nThe **Crown Prince**, in that **same year’s sixth month**, **also sent the Officer-in-Training Zhāng Wàndí** **to deliver fragrant oils and a dragon tablet** **for the Daoist rites within the mountain**. The **vigorous sovereign** **once more sent Guàn Fǎsì** **with fragrant incense**, arriving at the temple on the **thirteenth of the eighth month**. The **Master of the Dao** **paused in contemplation for a long while**, then **reluctantly accepted it**, telling his disciples: *\"How could this incense ever be burned to completion? **Let it be shared with the nearby temples**, **to widely support the rituals and lectures**, **hoping to touch their hearts**.\"*\n\nOn the **fourteenth day, at noon**, **just as he awoke from sleep**, **his face lit with joy**. His attendants at his side **inquired about the reason**, and he replied: *\"I was recently **visiting the Celestial Palace in my dreams**, and the **immortal officials saw my offerings**. They wished to **bestow upon me a position as an Immortal Lord**, **to compensate for my weary form**, and my **name and rank were already set**. My **ascension would not be long**.\"*\n\nOn the **fifteenth day**, he **bathed, donned his ceremonial attire**, **lit incense, and sat upright**. **He gathered his disciples**, **explaining the emperor’s intent in establishing the temple** and **encouraging them to strive with diligence**. On the **sixteenth day, at dawn**, **suddenly, he smelled an unfamiliar fragrance enter the room**, and **the crows and beasts wailed mournfully**. Turning to his attendants, he asked: *\"What hour is it now?\"*\nThey replied: *\"The second watch.\"*\nHe then answered: *\"Good.\"* **Immediately, he turned his body and lay flat**, **adjusted his own clothes and crown**, **and in a single morning, his nine transformations were undone**, **his age reaching one hundred and twenty-six**. His **limbs were soft and supple**, his **complexion unchanged**. **After his passing, his body was kept for over ten days**, **far surpassing the usual duration**.\n\nThe prefect dispatched the traveling military officer, Master Ma Junwei, to #1 Mountain for mourning and sacrifice, and also submitted a report to the court.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day, he used a talisman and bamboo slips to inscribe the name of the mountain of divine records to its right.\n\nAs for the **Dao/Way of the Sword’s Dissolution**, its profound subtleties are difficult to grasp. Yet when it came to **engrave his title as \"Virtue/Power Lord Bozha\"** and **record his deeds in the immortal ranks**, the **Dao/Way’s sacred texts** were composed, invoking the **emperor’s morning decree**. The **purple jade tablets** were inscribed, bestowing the **command of the \"Great Primordial\"**—a grand edifice was erected, its essence refined, its foundations aligned with the **original and unchanging**, its peaks harmonized with the **luxuriant hills** in slanted rows.\n\nThe **flying stairs** ascended beyond the clouds, the **precarious ponds** lined with **Han-style** elegance. The **dark furnaces** were built with **twisted beams**, the **red pillars** raised with **soaring phoenixes**, the **fragrant pavilion** set in the **marriage of voids**, the **luxuriant treasure platform** placed where **scenes invert**.\n\nAt dawn, the **crow’s nest** swept the light, and the **Dao/Way’s path** led through the **towering questions**. The **hare’s hue** split the night, its **shadows** hidden in the **embroidered gaps** of the **sparse woods**. The **dust vanished** while the **jade-tiled halls** stretched far, the **heat and cold isolated** as the **precious halls** deepened in grandeur.\n\nThe **embroidered clouds** and **congealing mists** vied in radiance, the **clear winds** and **lingering chimes** competed in resonance. Gazing from the **unfettered eaves**, one pities the **endless thousand rocks**; peering through the **carved windows**, all **ten thousand valleys** share the same azure hue.\n\nThe **scaled dragons** stir, their **jade-like armor** shimmering in the **green mirror**; the **clouds and mists** cast their **lighting**, their **rays** arrayed upon the **crimson case of the \"Red Phoenix\"**.\n\nThe **nine-colored** tiles speak in **mixed streams**, their **brushwork** swirling as it **returns and coils**; the **hundred-fold** adornments **polish the vaulted ceiling**, their **patterns** slanting and **twisting**.\n\nThe **frosted bells** echo with **the refined tones of the \"Bright Lord\"**, the **celestial covers** display the **wonders of mortal craftsmanship**.\n\nThe **listening monks** gather at the **eastern gallery**, the **feathered guests** rest in the **southern hall of honor**. The **eaves** measure the **dark frost**, the **courtyard** freezes with **crimson snow**.\n\nIn ancient times, the **Han Emperor**’s grand procession stood only the **Mysterious Palace** in **Yuzhang**. The **Qi Duke**’s nine victories saw the **main chamber** heard of in **Gongwu**, yet none compare to the **imperial edicts** now issuing from this **carved and resonant** sacred land.\n\nThe **ten thousand peaks of the \"Dark Metropolis\"** rise, their **heaven-piercing windows** planted in the **questions**. The **nine-tiered \"Xiao\" Platform** shines, its **radiance** brightening the **outer reaches of the \"Void Heaven\"**.\n\nThus, within the **inner halls**, a single statue was enshrined for the **Virtue/Power Lord Wen De** to honor the **Primordial Sovereign of the Beginning**, flanked by the **Two Sages**.\n\nIt mirrored the **wonders of the \"Fragrant Garden\"** and **recorded the rituals of the \"Empty Song\"**—near and far, all **returned in reverence**, and **humans and celestial beings** praised in awe. The **Dharma Wheel** turned eternally, the **great virtue/power** never faded.\n\nThe prefect, **Lord Wu of Lu**, **Master Li**, his name **Houde**, a **true person** of **ancient lineage**, his **clothing and cap** following the **old traditions**, was **divinely appointed** to distant branches, his **imperial garden** refining the **side shoots**. His governance followed the **Dao/Way of transformation**, his path sung in **folk hymns**. He **cherished trust in the Dharma**, his **virtue/power** never forgetting its **roots**.\n\nHis disciple, **Chen Yu**, from **tender years** served the **Dao/Way**, and even in **old age**, he did not tire of **absorbing the divine teachings**, attaining the **subtle essence’s** intent. In times past, he **answered celestial summons**, now entrusted with **divine commissions**. Today, he **oversees the construction**, further **elevating the hall’s grandeur**.\n\nHis disciple, **Wang Gui**, from **early years** stood **upright and resolute**, his **youthful reverence** for the **Dao/Way’s halls** known in **inner chambers**. His **actions** were guided by **principles**, his **words** left **traces of wisdom**. His **eloquent speeches** were **refined and profound**, their **meaning** clear and **resonant**.\n\nYu and the others, along with **near and far** fellow **Dao/Way** adherents and **elderly laymen**, declared: *\"The sun and moon revolve in cycles, their **fullness and waning** bound by fate. The **seasons pass in succession**, their **prosperity and decline** governed by the **Dao/Way**. It is fitting that the **imperial virtue/power** ascends in fragrance, its **luster** enduring, its **reputation** spreading far like **pure dust**.* Yet the **bamboo slips** are now **severed**, the **deep lament** of **Confucius** over the **Dao/Way’s loss** resounds, and the **simple records** have **suddenly fallen**—who else but **the Sage of the \"Bye and Follow\"** could **compose this**?\n\nThus, they **erected those towering walls**, **inscribed those exquisite stones**, **established words to record deeds**, and **transmitted them to the immortal ages**.\n\nThe sovereign **wishes** the **imperial plan** to **secure seven hundred years’ foundation**, its **talismans** to **align with the ten thousand ages’ fate**, equal to the **Jade Capital** in **eternal stability**, and **together with the \"Golden Gate\"** in **boundless remoteness**.\n\nDaring to **recount these sacred designs**, they composed this **inscription**:\n\nThe **living beings** stir in **innocent simplicity**, the **world** stretches in **endless vastness**.\n\n**Fortune and misfortune** chase in **unseen paths**, **love and hate** conspire in **hidden schemes**.\n\nLike the **dancing peach**, their **shadows** vanish in an instant, leaving no **trace**.\n\nLike the **mushroom’s fleeting bloom**, they **abandon the morning** without **autumn’s return**.\n\nThe **perfected sage** reveals his **use**, **early receiving** the **mysterious records**.\n\nHe **exceeds himself in diligence**, guiding and **elevating** his **followers**.\n\nIf he **wanders without purpose in the Dao/Way**, he **speaks no words** to **rectify customs**.\n\nThough **things may be discerned**, why **hesitate to wet one’s feet**?\n\n**Almost** he **explored its mysteries**, his **insight** offering **bright reflections**.\n\n**Refining the subtle**, he **nurtured virtue/power**, his **doubts** about the **mysterious** deepening his **emotions**.\n\nHis **talents** soared like **Chu’s clear waters**, his **worth** weighed like **Qin’s golden city**.\n\nHis **virtue/power** often **soared in argument**, his **path in letters** rivaled the **brightest**.\n\nHis **footsteps** sank into the **green moss**, his **reputation** reached the **red screens**.\n\nWhere **should he tread in rituals**? At the **shores of duty**, where **should he stand in virtue/power**? Amid the **pine peaks**.\n\nHis **master and ministers** belong to this **order**, as **loyal as the \"Lofty and Follow\"** in **summoning**.\n\nThus, they **called upon skilled artisans**, **constructing this solemn structure**.\n\nHow **grand** is its **overlooking expanse**! How **mighty** its **foundations**!\n\nIts **rituals** model the **Dark Garden**, its **glow** reflects the **eight directions**.\n\nThe **eaves** stack in **layered jade**, the **roofs** connect like **strung pearls**.\n\nAt dawn, the **sacred peaks** shine, the **lamps** illuminate the **divine abode**.\n\nThe **twisting paths** lead to the **fragrant stages**, the **converging shadows** meet the **strange trees**.\n\nThe **disturbing sounds** of **mortal craftsmanship** gather in **distant echoes**, the **shedding skins** of **serene transformations** respond in **far reverberations**.\n\nEach **year**, they **summon the nine-colored**, their **guests** drawn like **constellations**.\n\nThey **obscure the sun and moon**, their **depths** lost in **clouds and mists**.\n\n---\n\nThe **Dao/Way** of the Zhou **fades into repose**, the **stillness** reflects the **hidden Sage**.\n\nThe **phoenix** lingers in **graceful flight**, the **elephant** treads in **scaled steps**.\n\nHe **rides the zephyrs** of **Master Shū**, **prays for harmony** with the **mysterious Guest**.\n\nHis **words** endure through **eternal ages**, his **virtue/power** clears **pure dust** without end.\n\n**Pāo Xiāo**, the **Prefect of Hēzhou** and **Count of Bōchēng**, **Fēngchéng**, with **lofty lineage** and **unbroken service**, though **separated by generations**, much more so in **scholarly excellence**, far **above mortal burdens**, his **Dao/Way**-crafted **lines and measures** refined, his **judgment** yet **consulted**, his **labors** already **recorded**—thus it is **proper** to **inscribe** this **account**.\n\n**Jiāng Hào**, a **disciple of the Three Caverns**, composed this **eulogy**. Established on stone in the **second month, twenty-fifth day**, of the **16th year of Zhēnguān (642 CE)**.\n\n**Inscription for the Daoist Sage of Xiāoshì Shān, Master Wáng Jūn**:\n**Wáng Jūn**, the **Sage of Xiāoshì Shān**, **Master of the Celestial Standard**, **emits** his **radiance** to **drench the Luo**, **conceals** his **form** in **divine caverns**, **distinguishes** his **glow** from **sun and moon**—a **true abode** for the **souls of the worthy**.\n\nThus, **Sage** **Liú Běitái** **illuminated** his **forebear**, and **Master Wáng** **inherited** his **legacy**. **Master Wáng**, a **man of Lángyá**, named **Yuǎnzhī**. His **father**, **Sāngyáng**, was **guided by the phoenix** in **conception**; his **mother**, **Dīng**, **transformed** under the **wind’s influence**. At **seven years old**, he **knew ten thousand words**. His **home** was the **Héyuáng** **Master’s**, where **Táo Hóngjǐng** **dwelled**. There, he **held the needle** with **precision**, **mastered the Dao/Way**-craft**, **relaxed the body’s transformations**, **descended the True** to **replace the coarse**—even **summoning the Window sisters**, one **suspected** him to be the **disciple of the Celestial Sovereign** himself.\n\nThrough the **dynasties of Chén, Yuè, and Sūi**, and into our **Táng**, all **revered** him.\nHis **disciple**, **Pān Shīzhèng**, once **declared**: *\"I am **appointed** as the **Sage of Xiāoshì Shān**.\"* After **bathing and donning ritual robes**, he **ascended**, **enjoying life** to **126 years**. The **Emperor Gāozōng** **posthumously conferred** him as **Great Middle Marshal**, **Mr. Zhēn of the True Dao**, **expounding the Way**.\n\nIn **Zhēnyuán’s 10th year (814 CE)**, the **humble one** **arrived from Lúyù**, **lodging** at **Wěnxī**. **Climbing vines**, he **ventured into perilous depths**, **penetrating the crimson chambers**, **rinsing with jade waters**, **echoing the Sage’s wanderings in the Luo**. **Offering sincerity to the void**, he **inscribed** this **eulogy** upon the stone.\n\n**Eulogy**:\nThe **Dao/Way** **binds** the **original qi**, the **divine mechanism** the **true essence**.\n**Jade nectar** and **golden sprouts**, **congealed** in **self-illuminating substance**.\nHis **traces** **dissipate** like **clouds over misty peaks**, his **thoughts** **stir** the **frost-laden zephyrs**.\nThe **floating isle** has **passed**, its **radiance** now **still and remote**.\n\nIn **24th year of Dàyì (819 CE)**, **Wáng Bówén**, **Grand Marshal** and **Censor-in-Chief**, **reinscribed** this **account**.\n\n**Inscription for the Daoist Sage, Mr. Wáng of the Húángshān Tàipíngguān, and his Preface**:\n**Yú Jìngzhī**, **Count of Jiāngníng**, **from Hénán**, composed this; **Wáng Xuánzōng of Lángyá** **inscribed** it.\n\n**Alone**, the **Sovereign of the Yellow Emperor** **possessed the Dao/Way**, **marking the beauty of the顺风**—the **Master of Gūshè** **congealed his spirit**, **setting the example for abdication**—these are **distant reflections** of **ancient texts**, **faint hopes** of **preserved words**.\n\n**How much** does the **Dao/Way** **encompass the ages**, its **virtue/power** **illuminating a hundred kings**! **Before Heaven**, Heaven **does not resist**; **after Heaven**, he **follows Heaven’s timing**. His **transformations** **permeate all**, his **virtue/power** **embraces the utmost**. **Jade waters** of **Qīngxī’s hall**, **purple palaces** of the **Celestial Treasury**—his **summons** **gathered** the **worthy scholars**, who **descended** in **refined robes**, **waiting in ethereal attire**.\n\nHe **ceased his journey** at the **vermilion gates**, **abandoned his pleasures** in the **crimson fields**.\n**Carefully**, he **entrusted** the **Daoist of Zhōngnánshān**, **Wànfúguān**, **Zhōu Yuánjìng**, to **invite the Sage**.

His **pure heart** **refined his essence**, **in harmony** with **Heaven’s decree**. **Rich** in **the Sage’s harmonious virtue**, **flowing** with **the Supreme Void’s fragrance**, **in youth** he **left the world**, **in later years** he **returned to the True**.\n\n**Master Wáng of the Tàipíngguān**, **Sage of the Three Purity**, **traversed the six doctrines’ crossroads**, **elevating his heart** to **crimson secrets**, **reflecting on profound waves**. He **destroyed the net** in **the path of delusion**, **lit the lamp** in **the chamber of darkness**. His **clear rules** and **unadorned theories** made him a **great man of his age**.\n\nThe Master then halted his steed at the Mysterious Gate,\npondering how to expound the wondrous intent.\nHe still followed the Sage as his abode in the thatched valley,\nserving as a disciple of the Fragrant Master for sixteen years,\nrising early and retiring late,\nlaboring without ceasing.\n\nAt dawn, he offered the turbid brew,\nat dusk, he partook the flowing nectar,\nfulfilling his duty without weariness,\nrelying on virtue without instruction.\n\nHe contemplated the Vermilion Palace and sought the Sage,\nheld the Purple Robe in mind to find the True.\nHis emotions wandered with spring waters and stones,\nhis sleeves unfurled for orchids and cassia.\nHe raised the nest of Master You to tame the crows,\nextended the palm of Master Zhuang to observe the fish.\n\nWhen the wind spoke in spring’s mountains,\nwhen moonlight shimmered on autumn’s waters,\nwhen the monkeys cried in perilous heights,\nwhen the tigers roared in secluded streams,\nhe never failed to awaken his thoughts in verdant reverie,\nand dip his brush to record his reflections.\n\nBy the time the Master reached maturity,\nhe devoutly received the scriptures and teachings.\nHe nurtured the Valley Spirit in the Mysterious Feminine,\nand roamed the Boundless Qi in the Yellow Palace.\n\nAt first, he sat beneath the Sage’s seat,\nlistening to *The Laozi*, *The Western Ascension*,\n*The Soul’s Treasure*, and *The True Person of the South’s Discourse*.\nUpon leaving, he immediately expounded them for others,\ncovering all Five Phases without omission,\nevery word preserved—\nhis arguments towered like the Pillars of Heaven,\nhis phrases aligned as sharp as the cleaving of Huo’s blade.\n\nThe Sage sighed and said:\n*\"My Dao has turned eastward—\nwhy single out Kang Cheng alone?\"*\n\nWhen the Sui Dynasty seized the map,\nscouting rocks and caves for omens,\nseeking the gifted and extraordinary,\nthe Sage proclaimed the Three Fragrant Masters and Seven Holy Ones—\nthen descended in silk mist,\nhurrying to the Bundled Capital.\n\nAt this juncture, the Master joined their journey to the Jing-Luo region,\nmorning by morning attending the humble court,\nevening by evening serving the bronze pool,\nentering and exiting the twin palaces,\nhis fame resounding through the Four Departments.\n\nHad he not embodied True Wisdom,\nhad his resolve not been as vast as the Empty Boat,\nhow could he answer the archers’ banners,\nor accept the summons of the silk edict?\n\nAt the time, he was urged to perform\nthe Dao of the Jade Pure and Mysterious Hall,\npreparing thick sacrificial meals,\ncarving jade for the broth and gilding the rice,\ndecorating the altar with fragrant offerings,\nspreading clouds as a quilt and brocade as a bed.\n\nWhen the Sui ruler’s expedition returned victorious,\nthe Master accompanied him in the Yellow Dragon procession,\nthe chariots triumphant in their homeward march to Luoyang.\n\nIn the eleventh year of the Great Business era,\nthere came an edict commissioning the Master\nto the twenty-four counties of Henan,\nto broadly seek out black-robed monks—\nthose with genuine virtue, extraordinary abilities,\ndiverse skills, praiseworthy conduct,\nor who could elucidate teachings with clarity,\nand those who mastered the Dao’s methods—\nand report their names to the imperial court.\n\nWith this imperial command,\nhe returned to his former dwelling.\n\nSoon after, the fiery destiny waned,\nthe Celestial Sovereign lost control,\nas the Yellow Scarves and Red Eyebrows\ngathered in rebellion, their malice rising.\nThe Green Forests and Blue Calves\nfollowed in their disorderly ranks,\ntheir insolence unchecked.\nThe passes were severed, and so he fled to sacred mountains,\ntraversing Tian Tai, Chìchéng, Sìmíng,\nTóngxiāng, Jīntíng, Cài Yōu,\nJǐnyún, and Ruòyě.\n\nRealizing that life is fleeting as a breath,\nknowing that a hundred years pass swiftly,\nhe adapted to the times—\nsometimes resting in stone chambers,\nsometimes lodging in humble inns with crooked branches,\nplucking osmanthus and orchids,\nsipping flowing waters in self-contentment.\n\nThe sun and moon lingered in his presence,\nand he immersed himself for another ten years,\nyet the black-haired folk suffered in flames,\nand the county magistrates had perished.\n\nThen, the Great Tang’s phoenix arose from Jinyang,\nits dragon ascended from Weishui,\nsweeping away the chaotic and rebellious,\nrestoring order to the southern lands,\nremoving the wedge and correcting the northern pole,\nholding the Purple Axis in reverence,\nbearing the Yellow Map in triumph,\ncalmly contemplating Heaven’s vast inundation,\nextinguishing the fiery Kun’s blazing flames,\nenclosing the sun and moon as shoulder windows,\ncultivating the Qí and Bó as a moat and pond,\nranking the jade tablets and bi discs in Chang’an,\nestablishing grand rites to align with Heaven and Earth,\nproclaiming sincerity in the pure temple,\nand composing grand music to harmonize with the sounds of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Master, having witnessed this flourishing civilization,\nwas moved to return by the call of his homeland.\nHe readied his carriage,\nadjusted his worn robes,\nleft Tian Tai behind,\nand entered the Earth’s Lung.\nHe entered the reporting gate to welcome the Sage’s procession,\nand wandered the outer precincts to pay homage to the True Person.\n\nThe Emperor Taizong, the Wénhuáng,\nwandered in spirit through the Boundless Pass,\nopening the Jade Capital in the Verdant Reaches,\nconcentrating his mind in the Faint and Obscure Realm,\nexpanding the Golden Gate in the Crimson Palace.\n\nThe Sage now shone his wisdom,\nthe Most Holy extended his boundless compassion,\nwhile the venom of private teachings spread far.\nYet the Master’s path of welcome was still incomplete,\nand he encountered the favorable wind of Mount Kāng.\nHe ascended to the subtle teachings of the Lìxié Village.\n\nAt that time, the Sage still held the legacy of the Zǐzé Forest,\nhis words as lush as the willow’s shade.\nThus, he dispatched disciples,\nfirst to restore the Master’s abode at the Er Tao’s former site.\n\nThis temple was built in the residence of the Xu Sage,\nwhere the True Person once dwelled,\nand was named □Zhūyáng.\nIn the Ming Dynasty’s reign,\nit was renamed Huáyáng.\nAccording to *The True Announcement*, Huáyáng\nis the name of the eighth of the Celestial Caverns.\n\nIts mountain rises in towering rocks,\nhidden from the sky,\nwith paths ascending into the clouds—\nwhere the refining takes place.\nIts base encircles the earth,\nits winding streams carry the wind,\nand its peaks extend far beyond.\n\n「With his dwelling bound by sacred groves,\nhe soared through the Nine Transformations to wander among the immortals;\nto the south, he controlled the Luo Fu,\nopening Five Passes to receive the Sage.\nTo the west, he connected with E Yao,\nextending far to the Xi Jin.\nTo the north, he shook the Tai Zong,\nflipping his crane-driving carriage to the hidden abode of the Spirit Sovereign.\nTruly, he was one whom the feathered guests lingered to visit.\n\nYet his former foundations lay in ruins,\nhis nearby halls overgrown with weeds,\nso the Master himself cleared the thorny fields and opened the grounds anew,\ncommencing this grand construction.\nWith reverence, he built the main hall,\nthree eaves and two bays,\nincluding lecture halls, ritual platforms, chambers, and gateways.\nHe planted fragrant osmanthus and cassia along the winding paths,\nso that their shadows darkened like clouds,\nand raised plum beams upon the celestial roads,\nso that their splendor blazed like morning mist.\nThe eaves extended like a duck’s flight, their calls ringing clear,\nthe phoenix-tiled roof stood solitary and lofty,\nthe joyful magpies ascended in pairs—\nhow much more than mere butterfly wings stirring the breeze,\nor the mortals’ refined appearances from their alchemy!\n\nYet the sacred light was easily accessible,\nwhy was the fulfillment of blessings so difficult?\nAgain, within the inner hall,\nhe reverently enshrined a statue of the Primordial Sovereign of Heaven,\neight feet in height,\nwith two Celestial Masters flanking him in attendance.\nThe divine bearing was solemn and dignified,\nthe sacred form subtle and refined—\nits countenance mirrored the moon’s luminous purity,\nits spirit captured the sun’s radiant brilliance.\nThe pillars gleamed with double hues,\ndisplaying the *Golden Scripture of Auspiciousness*,\nthe palms emitted tenfold light,\nthe *Jade Tablets of Good Fortune* shone like crystal.\nThus, the celestial nymphs of divine splendor\ncame in procession from the *Hall of the Radiant Fungus*,\nand the *Spiritual Deities of the Clouds*\ngathered at the *Fragrant Tower of the Morning Mist*,\ntheir attendance ceasing only with the day’s end.\n\nThe Master then arranged the emerald throne\nand fanned the mysterious winds,\nwalking the red steps\nto proclaim the myriad wonders.\nHe maneuvered the boat of compassion\nto rescue those in need,\nand raised the torch of wisdom\nto illuminate the unenlightened.\nHis benevolent influence matched the depths of the whale’s abyss,\nhis achievements surpassed the Five Tortoises of the *Kui Peak* in grandeur—\nOh, how vast and beautiful they were!\nIndeed, they were beyond praise.\n\nThe disciples traveled to renowned mountains and blessed lands,\nencountering true scriptures by chance.\nLater, they resided at the Hua Yang Cavern,\nwhere they meticulously copied the sacred diagrams and secret treasures\nof the Supreme Daoist Schools—\nthe *Dongxuan Sacred Patterns* and the *Dongxuan Divine Symbols*—\nand with utmost devotion,\nthey transcribed the *Zhongwei Models* and exhausted the *Ban Chui Regulations*.\nSealed within a quiet chamber,\nthey eternally safeguarded the mountain’s gateways.\n\nFrom youth to old age,\nthe Master always savored the scent of pine and wood.\nIn his lifetime, he conducted lectures and teachings,\nand all his offerings and charities\nwere recorded as merits and virtues.\nHe never failed to rescue the poor.\n\nIn the second year of the Qian Feng era,\nthe year of the Ding Mao,\non the first day of the eleventh month,\nafter completing his morning rites,\nhe turned to his disciples and said:\n*\"Last night, during the fifth watch,\nI seemed to be in a dream,\nand saw three men in feathered robes,\ntheir attire impeccable,\nholding tablets and scrolls,\nentering my chambers.\nThey declared that the Hua Yang Celestial Palace\nhad long evaluated my worth,\nand now appointed me as the Immortal Sovereign for Ten Thousand People,\nalso entrusting me with the oversight of the Celestial Officials.\n\nMoreover, your virtue and talent are pure and lofty,\nfit for this station.\nNow, we bear the heavy command to invite and welcome you—\nyou must depart without delay.\nI once dwelled in the Tong Wu Mountains,\nand already felt this calling in my dreams.\nThough I declined, I could not escape,\nand now must answer this summons.*\nThus, he admonished his disciples,\ninstructing them on the essentials of cultivating the Dao,\nthe scriptures and their practices,\neach receiving his final charge.\n\nOn the eighth day of the month,\nhe repeatedly asked for fragrant baths and purification,\nchanging his headgear and sash,\nand donning new robes.\nAt dawn on the ninth day,\nstrange incense filled the chamber,\nhis body upright and serene,\nthen suddenly dissolved into the void—\nin the age of eighty-eight.\n\nOn the seventeenth day,\nin the hour of Gui You,\nhe entrusted his spirit-tablet to a tree\nat the Hua Yang Temple,\non the western slope of Lei Ping Mountain\nand to the right of the tomb of Tao Zheng.\nAlas!\n\nThe Master’s virtue was as boundless as the Two Principles,\nhis emotions encompassed the Six Qi.\nFrom birth, he was a source of doubt and wonder,\nyet in his growth, he embodied the Rectitude of the Dao.\nHis center was yellow and harmonious,\nhis elixir-fields concentrated in form.\nThe White Phoenix soared in his spirit,\nand his discussions of Daoist texts in the *Hanlin Academy*\nwere as brilliant as the Spotted Bird’s flights in debate.\nHe analyzed profound truths in his lectures.\n\nHis body was one with the divine,\nhis nature aligned with the Dao.\nHe purified his heart along the Pine Path,\nand practiced austerity in the Cloud Roads.\nTruly, he was of the *Pengtiao* and *Qizhou* lineage,\nunited with the *Pengxian* in purpose.\nThe Five-Colored Mountains of the West\nwitnessed only the phantom of a child of the Dao,\nand the Eight Immortals of the Huai Nan\nwere but echoes of his great deeds.\n\nHis disciples—Dai Huigong, Bao Fangguang,\nHao Dewen, Wang Yuanyao—\nand over a thousand others,\nall of extraordinary talent and virtue,\ntheir voices rising above the *Qi Jian*,\ninheriting the teachings from the *Que Li*,\ndevoted to the Dao in the *Zi Wei*,\ngrieved as if their beams were shattered,\nmourned beyond the depths of *Lin Gu*—\nthey gathered the *Golden Hua* to bid farewell,\nand sought the *Jade Shu* to reaffirm their resolve.\nTime has passed like the sun and moon,\nyet his lofty teachings remain.\nWhen they saw his inscribed works,\nthey composed this elegy:\n\n**First Ode:**\nThe Perfect One needs no aid,\nthe Supreme Virtue is nameless.\nHis heart concentrated as the Vermilion Tortoise,\nhis spirit wandering in the Jade Purity.\nHe battled winds with the wings of the Peng,\nand struck water to cross the *Ying*.\nThe Green Stream bore his essence,\nthe Blue Sky echoed his fame.\n\n**Second Ode:**\nThe Mystic Pearl was already attained,\nthe White Clouds could be commanded.\nThe cow-eyed were left unharmed,\nthe *Harmful Moths* departed.\nThe Yellow Court held his #4 virtue,\nthe Purple Court honored his reputation.\nHe then turned the *Huan Xi* seal,\nand soon mourned the *Zhi Xu*’s dissipation.\n\n**Third Ode:**\nHe shone like snow upon the Kāng peaks,\ncongealed like frost at Gu She.\nThe *Peony* was bought with scattered rainbows,\nthe *Lotus* moved with shifting thunder.\nAt first, he seemed to bury his sword—\nthen the *Ling Wu* left its mark.\nHis words spread far and wide,\nyet his teachings were profound and vast.\n\n**Fourth Ode:**\n\n**Fifth Ode:**\nThe fragrant mists were doubled,\nthe beauty of success was renewed.\nCalamity stretched to the Vermilion Gate,\nflames scoured the Azure Palace.\nHe cleared the brambles of the *Luo* grass,\nand his foundation endured forevermore.\nThe Rainbow Disk and the Phoenix’s breath—\ntruly like the workings of the gods.\n\n**Sixth Ode:**\nIn the *Liu* Valley, he sought the potter’s art,\nin the *Zhi* Field, he greeted the sage.\nHe listened in secret to the Four Dynasties,\nand conversed in revelry with the Three *Mao*.\nWild melodies filled the *Xia* Pavilion,\nmountain sentiments rose with the moon’s ascent.\nHis pavilion faced the frost’s delicate charm,\nhis pool linked with the wind’s refined grace.\n\n**Seventh Ode:**\nHe leaned on the *Yi* Law’s teachings,\nhis voice spreading profound and vast.\nThe realm of wisdom was not yet exhausted,\nyet the *Sheng* Cause fell first.\nHe neared the *Lin* Altar’s ambition,\nbut his labor was undone like overturned earth.\nThe *Zhi* Standard marked the True Sovereign,\nwould he ever seek vain adornment?\n\n**Eighth Ode:**\n**Inscription for the Stele of Master Zhenbai of Mount Mao**\n**A Brief Account by Master Dao-yin of the White Cloud Monastery, Recorded and Written by the River-intern Sima Dao-weizi**\n\nGreat indeed was Dao-yuan,\nthe source of ten thousand essences’ birth.\nHis presence was as fleeting as a passing breath,\nyet his creation was as manifest as the mingling of *yin* and *yang*.\nIf one follows the Dao’s teachings,\nrefines the mind through profound insight,\nharmonizes and circulates the elixir’s flow,\nand transmutes both form and spirit—\nto merge with the One and ascend the Three *Qing*,\nto attain the ancient secrets yet few have reached perfection.\n\nOnly Master Zhenbai gathered them all,\ndiscerned them with clarity,\ndwelled in stillness and mastered them,\ndiligently practiced and fulfilled them.\nTruly, he was born of the *Ling* Qi.\nIn his womb, he saw the Dragon’s ascent in dreams,\nhis towering virtue mirrored the *Hé* Sage’s form,\nhis bones recorded the *Bai* Immortal’s bearing.\nHis heart was like a bright mirror,\npenetrating all without remainder,\nhis vessel like a great bell,\nemptiness ensured its response.\n\nThus, the Dao’s true transmission was complete at the *Zhao* Platform,\nits subtle meanings revealed in the *Ling* Treasury.\nHe compiled the scattered texts into coherent records,\nexpanded the *Jin* Script’s phoenix seals,\nadded the *Lang* Case’s dragon chapters,\nunveiling ancient mysteries and guiding later disciples.\nLike the lesser teachings of the Immortals,\nhe became the renowned master of ages.\n\nBeholding Master Zhenbai’s likeness,\none sees the Dao preserved in his gaze.\nReading his writings,\none finds his spirit in the flowing words—\neven after a thousand years, one may grasp his essence in a single morning.\n\nAs for the mysteries of his profound thoughts,\nthe subtleties of his form’s transmuted grace,\nI know not how to fully describe them,\nthough logic strains to explain.\n\nWith reverence, I refine my own virtues and deeds,\nreceive the Dao’s full teachings,\nand follow the *Ke* methods—\nindeed surpassing the True Stages.\nMy fate diverges from his path,\nmy words differ in silence and revelation.\nI follow his enlightenment’s shadow,\nnot his dawn’s ascent.\nIn darkness, I rise to the Upper *Qing*,\nbeyond mortal measure or recognition.\n\nYet though his form dissolved into clouds,\nhis empty chamber still remains,\nhis sword has not yet flown,\nhis grave mound remains unopened.\nThe Dao is honored, virtue esteemed—\neternally unchanged through the ages.\nHis writings reveal his essence,\nyet today none may see it.\n\nDynasties have passed in succession,\nmountain ages have turned cold.\nNone cherish the Immortal’s resolve,\nlong have I felt profound sorrow.\n\nNow that Dao-weizi returns to the *Heng* Mountains,\nresting at Mount Mao’s slopes,\nhe gathers with the *Fa* Masters to carve this stone.\nThe *Shao* Ling composed the text,\nperfect in its time.\nNow I record it with ink,\npreserving his #5 past deeds.\nWith clumsy brush in hand,\nI humbly recount his true teachings,\ninscribing them beneath the stele\nto illuminate the ages.\n\nWritten on the 13th day of the 9th month,\nin the year *Jiazi* of the *Kaiyuan* era,\non the day *Gisi* (己巳).\n\nIn the year *Yihai* of the *Kaiyuan* era,\non the 4th month’s *Renzhi* day (壬子),\nMaster White Cloud was at Mount *Wangwu*,\nwhen his nephew, the *Yanling* County magistrate’s clerk,\nreceived his command to personally oversee the carving.\n\n**End of Volume Twenty-Two of the *Mao* Mountains Records** #1\n#1 *Fù* (赴): Original text had *gù* (讣), corrected according to the *Dān* edition.\n#2 *Dié* (迭):

Yang Observatory, Mao Mountain, in the Tang Dynasty**\n\nInscribed by **Gengshi** (secretary) Liu Shizhi of Hedong (河东柳识), written by **Zhì** (assistant justice) Zhang Congshen of the **Hao** Commandery (昊郡张从申), with the seal script on the preface by Li Yangbing (李阳冰).\n\nThe **Dao** Gate of **Hua**yang (華陽), also the **Confucian** Gate of **Mò**si (沬泗), is where the **Xuan** (玄) transformation resonates. At dawn beneath the golden light, there were the **Mao** brothers of the Western Han; in secluded shadows and hidden **Dao** withdrawal, there was the **Shu** family of the **Jin** dynasty (束晉許氏一門). Following their **Ming** (明) and **Chong** (沖) lineage, to elucidate the **Dao**’s wind, there were **Master Zhengbai** of the Liang (梁貞白先生) and **Master Xuanjing** of the Tang (唐玄靜先生).\n\nDuring the **Kaiyuan** era, the **Xuan**zong (玄宗) honored the **Master** (尊師) and inquired about **li**hua (理化). He replied: *\"The Daodejing* is the **Master**’s guide for rulers. In ancient times, Emperor Wen of Han practiced its teachings, and thus the **Ren**shou (仁壽) era brought prosperity to all under heaven.\"\n\nThe emperor then asked about **Jin**ding (金鼎). He replied: *\"The **Dao**’s virtue/power is like the wind—if one raises it too hastily, it disperses. If one clings to its private aspects, they lose sight of the whole. The **Sage** (聖人) preserves the teachings, yet does not cling to life or indulge in desires, lest it appear as though striking the wind.\"*\n\nThe emperor was pleased and thus bestowed upon him the title **Xuanjing** (玄靜).\n\nNot long after, he declined due to illness and returned eastward to **Jùqū** (句曲).\n\n「The **Master** (先生), whose personal name was **Hán Guāng** (含光), originally bore the surname **Hóng** (弘), but since the **Empress Zétiān** (則天) also bore that surname, he changed it to **Lǐ** (李). His father, **Xiào Wēi** (孝威), was renowned in his locality as **Zhēn#1yǐn** (贞#1隐). The **Master**’s family was one of **chún** **rú** (醇儒) from **Jìnlíng** (晉陵).\n\nFor nature and the **Dao** (道) are subtle, yet true **qi** (元氣) flows without end.\n\nThe ancient scholars sought **li**hua (理化) by discerning the **yǒu** (有) within the **wú** (無), neither straying beyond the sighing of the wind nor the fading of light, nor wandering far in thought of **huà** (化) as gold but staying close to the **Dao** (道) of desires. If one today practices true **li**hua (理化), naturally observes the subtle, first demonstrates upright **xìng** (性), and elucidates the fundamental **zōngyuán** (宗元), then such a one is **Xuanjing** (玄靜).\n\nAt thirteen, he left his home to devote himself to the **Dao** (道), maintaining a serene and pure gaze, offering kindness to even the most base of movements. In his dwelling, he treated others as if they were sovereigns or kin; those who saw him were all moved, their emotions and dispositions subdued.\n\nIn his youth, he mastered **zhuànlì** (篆隶) script, yet when someone praised him as surpassing his father, he never again wrote a single character.\n\nHis compositions, including *The Records of Daoist Learning* (《仙學傳記_), filled in gaps and preserved what was lost. He also discussed the differences and similarities among the *Three Daos* (三玄), compiling *The True Scripture* (《真經》) and *The Phonetic Meanings of the Fundamental Herbs* (《本草音義》), all of which were meticulously detailed, without confusion, and exhausted the principles of learning—like a bell holding its resonance.\n\nLater, he studied under **Sìmǎ Jūn** (司馬君) of **Huágàifēng** (華蓋峰), who possessed **zhuàn** (篆) script treasures and imparted them generously. Afterward, he was addressed as *\"The Guest of the True Pure and Clear\"* (真玉清之客).\n\nThose who embraced **xūwú** (虛無) yet neglected practice were no different from the **Dao** (道) itself; those who relied on secluded mountains yet abandoned their boundaries were shallow in **virtue/power** (德). To receive the **Dao** (道) from afar, one ought to save others first.\n\nThus, he guided his disciples to ascend his hall and receive his profound teachings.\n\nThe **Master**’s **qi** (元氣) was unscattered, his **yáo tú** (瑶圖) empty yet luminous. His **ling** **hun** (靈魂) had long been enlightened, his brilliance ever concealed. His actions did not reveal their purpose, nor did his stillness imply closure; at the assembly of the ten thousand, he was as if at the gathering of the one, and the **Dao** (道) that could be named was not the **Dao** (道) itself. When the grassy **Móng** (蒙) sought him, he did not labor over words. He nurtured the **Dao** (道) of ultimate transformation, blending the **xūróng** (虛融) into a single mind. The mind, once transformed, reaches **learning** (學); learning, once transformed, attains the **Dao** (道). This harmony of virtuous **qi** (氣) has always been present, but only those who seek it truly see it. Therefore, he wore his **shū** **yī** (枢衣) and advanced without distinction of near or far, taking **Yuán Hé** (元和) as his model and cultivating the fullness of his **xìng** (性)—like autumn flowers leaning on layered cliffs or summer floods converging in rivers.\n\nThe **Master** forgot his own body yet showed kindness to all; auspicious omens often appeared, as if he were a common sight. Commoners and scholars alike consulted him, and he conveyed his meaning through expression alone.\n\nHe often ordered the **zhāng tán** (章坛) to close its **bìyuàn** (閉#3院), to select incense wood for ritual offerings, and to perform rites with utmost sincerity—all in this manner.\n\nOnce, celestial scriptures arrived in succession, and he was earnestly requested to honor them. The ministers and officials prayed for his blessings, and indeed, there was no month without their petitions. Eventually, the **Dao** (道) community saw him as the *True Uncarved Jade* (真璞), holding the treasure of benevolent frugality and returning to the **Dao** (道) of the **Xī** (羲) and **Huáng** (黃).\n\nTruly, my teacher’s teachings have reached their peak!\n\nIn the winter of the fourth year of **Dàlì** (大歷), he said to his disciples **Wéi Jǐngzhāo** (韋景昭) and **Mèng Zhǎnrán** (孟湛然): *\"I shall now follow the **Dao** (道) of transformation.\"* His **shén qì** (神氣) was tranquil, as if in the state of **zuòwàng** (坐忘). He was then eighty-seven years old.\n\nAs his **líng yún** (靈雲) descended upon the hall, he held his tablet as if alive. According to *The True Scripture* (《真經》), this was the mark of one who grasped the freedom of transformation and the profound mysteries of the Daoist path.\n\nHis disciples said: *\"The taste of the **Lìquán** (醴泉) is known only to those who drink it; the **Dao** (道) of our teacher is seen only by those who study it long. We wish to uphold the True Doctrine and demonstrate it to future generations.\"*\n\n**Tài** (泰) once wandered in the **Dao** (道), now dares to recount its profound winds.\n\nThis inscription reads:\n\n*\"In ancient times, there were those who bore strong names, their **yuánjīng** (元精) rare and refined. The **Yellow Emperor** (黃帝) left them behind; the **Master** (先生) obtained them. He wandered freely, yet always in harmony with the One. The true **xìng** (性) contained within him followed the same rule as **Tàiwú** (太無).*\n\n「He walked the Daoist path daily, yet spoke not when the time arrived.\nMen say all beings are wondrous, but I see only the common form.\nThe **Emperor Xuānzōng** (玄宗) revered him and summoned him to the capital.\nThe **Purple Peak** (紫极) was but honored in name, while the **White Cloud** (白云) remained unaware.\n\nLater disciples from distant lands came and went in joyful harmony.\nThough many schools of thought existed, his true **qi** (精) was self-sustained.\nHe entrusted himself to the Dao and departed, leaving none to fathom his essence.\nThe secret teachings of the mystic arts had their destined time—he knew it well.\n\nIn the seventh year of **Dàlì** (大历), on the fourth day of the eighth month, this inscription was established.\n\n**Inscription for Master Lǐ Containing-Light of Mount Máo (茅山玄静先生) from Guānglíng (广陵)**\nBy **Jīnzǐ Guānglù Dàfū** (金紫光禄大夫) **Yán Zhēnqìng** (颜真卿), who held the titles of **Lake State Prefect** (行湖州刺史) and **Grandee of the Realm** (上柱国), and was the **Count of Lǔ** (鲁郡) and **First Duke of Kāiguó** (开国公).\n\nThe Master was surnamed **Lǐ** (李), given the name **Hán-Guāng** (含光), and hailed from **Jiāngdū** (江都) in **Guānglíng** (广陵).\nOriginally, his family bore the surname **Hóng** (弘), but it was changed to avoid the taboo of the **Temple Name of the Emperor Xiàojìng** (孝敬皇帝庙讳).\n\nHis **fourth ancestral grandfather** (二十一代祖), **Hóng** (宏), was the **Prefect of Jiāngxià** (江夏太守). To avoid the **usurpation of Wang Máng** (王莽), he relocated to **Jìnlíng** (晋陵), thus becoming a native of the county.\nHis **great-grandfather** (高祖), **Wéndú** (文疑), served as **Attendant Officer of the State of Guì** (陈桂阳王国侍郎).\nHis **great-grandfather** (曾祖), **Róng** (荣), held the post of **Master of Ráizhōu** (皇朝雷州司马).\nHis **grandfather** (祖师), **Chǒng** (宠), retired in seclusion to pursue his aspirations, later settling in **Jiāngdū** (江都).\nHis father, **Xiàowēi** (孝威), was a scholar of ancient lore, refining the **Dao of Páng** (彭) and **Lǐng** (聘). He befriended **Zǐwéi Sīmǎ Liànshī** (天台司马炼师子微) as a layman, and his reputation for earnestness and prudence earned him the title **Mr. Zhèngyǐn** (正隐先生) among the people. His mother, **Wáng from Lángyè** (琅琊王氏), was virtuous and of noble character.\n\nAs a child, the Master exhibited extraordinary traits. His eyes alone sought out the *Classic of Filial Piety* (《孝经》), as if cradling it in his hands.\nFrom a young age, he favored quietude, studying and reciting the *Analects* (坟) and *Classics* (典).\nAt eighteen, he resolved to seek the profound mysteries of the Dao, and thus became a disciple of his fellow-county Daoist Master **Lǐ** (李), devoting years to his arts.\n\nIn the first year of **Shéndòng** (神龙), he was ordained as a Daoist priest for his virtuous conduct, residing at **Lóngxīng Guān** (龙兴观). He mastered the profound essences of the *Laozi* (《老》), *Zhuāngzi* (《庄》), and *Zhōuyǐ* (《周易》).\n\nWhen attending to funeral rites, he did not taste sweet flavors, and his diet consisted solely of accumulated barley.\nThe offerings of food and drink for the deceased were all prepared by his own hands, earning him the epithet *\"Destroying the bones, standing firm\"* (毁骨立). His kin could not help but mourn his asceticism.\n\nIn the seventeenth year of **Kāiyuán** (开元), he accompanied **Sīmǎ Liànshī Zǐwéi** (司马炼师子微) to **Wángwū Shān** (王屋山), where he received the **Sacred Scriptures of the Great Dao** (大法灵文金记), comprehending them in a single glance. He synthesized the keys of antiquity and modernity, elucidating their profound meanings.\n\n**Emperor Xuānzōng** (玄宗) recognized that the Master had uniquely inherited **Zǐwéi’s** Dao, and thus decreed that he reside at **Yángtái Guān** (阳台观) in **Wángwū Shān** (王屋山) to continue its teachings.\n\nAfter a year, the Master requested to return to **Mount Máo** (茅山) to compile and refine the Daoist scriptures.\nRepeated summons were all declined on account of his feigned illness.\n\nIn the winter of the fourth year of **Tiānbǎo** (天宝), the Emperor commanded imperial officials to deliver a sealed decree summoning him.\nUpon arrival, he was granted an audience in the **Forbidden City** (禁中), and whenever the Emperor sought counsel, he first underwent purification rites.\n\nLater, when the Emperor requested transmission of the Daoist teachings, the Master demurred, citing his foot ailment as an impediment to proper ritual observance, many times over. The Emperor, recognizing he could not be compelled, desisted.\n\nThe Master had once observed that the **Sacred Scriptures of Mount Máo** (茅山灵迹) were on the verge of collapse, and their secret records had largely scattered. He thus sought to return and restore them.\n\nThe Emperor specially granted him the former residences of **Yáng** (杨) and **Xǔ** (许) near **Zǐyáng** (紫阳), along with two hundred bolts of silk, two sets of Daoist robes, a censer, and imperial poetry. He also bestowed the title **Chú** (叔) upon him as a farewell gift.\n\nFurthermore, the Emperor prohibited hunting and fishing near the mountain, forbidding those who consumed meat or blood from entering without prior purification. Both public and private sacrificial rites were henceforth conducted without slaughtered offerings.\n\nThe Master arrived at the mountain in the autumn of the sixth year. That year, the **auspicious winds** (韶书) descended three times, bringing abundant moisture and luminous reflections across the cliffs and valleys.\n\nInitially, the mountain housed the **True Person of the Upper Clarity** (上清真人) **Xǔ Chángshǐ** (许长史), **Yáng Jūn** (杨君), and **Táo Yǐnjū** (陶隐居), who had personally inscribed their Daoist teachings. These sacred texts were passed down through generations, but during the chaos of war and upheaval, they were lost and scattered.\n\nThe Master, entrusted with the **auspicious winds** (韶), searched diligently and recovered their traces, presenting them to the Emperor.\n\nPreviously, when the Emperor sought the **Great Dao** (大法), he requested the Master as his teacher. The Master, however, remained modest and declined, citing illness.\n\nIn the spring of the seventh year, the Emperor again desired to receive the *Three Caverns True Scriptures* (《三洞真经》). In the third month of that spring, imperial officials delivered a sealed decree stating:\n*\"On the eighteenth day of this month, I shall humbly accept the scriptures.\"*\n\nOn that day, within the **Great Harmony Hall** (大同殿), he purified himself and prepared for the ritual. He then paid homage to the Master from afar as his **Degree Teacher** (度师), and the Emperor bestowed a single robe upon him to honor their teacher-student relationship. The title **Guāngjìng** (玄静) was bestowed upon the Master as a mark of distinction.\n\nThe Emperor further decreed that the **Scriptures of Mount Huáyáng** (华阳洞宫) be engraved upon stone as a memorial.\n\nThat summer, in the secluded place where he had previously cultivated the **Sacred Fungus** (芝), eighty-one stalks of **Lingzhí** (灵芝) emerged between pine and stone, their growth bountiful and strange. The Master, along with imperial officials, informed the **Immortal Sage** (灵仙) of this marvel, and the report was sealed and presented to the Emperor.\n\nIn the summer of that year, the Emperor also granted the Master two hundred households near **Zǐyáng Guān** (紫阳观), along with one hundred households each for **Tàipíng Guān** (太平观) and **Chóngyuán Guān** (崇元观). All were exempted from taxation to support the Master’s Daoist rites.\n\nIn the seventh month of that autumn, the Master was again summoned.\nUpon arrival, he requested residence in a Daoist temple to tend to his illness.\nIn the spring of the ninth year, he declined the summons and returned to his old mountain.\n\nThat summer, in the sixth month, the place where the **Sacred Fungus** (芝) had previously sprouted again produced over three hundred stalks, resplendent and extraordinary—visible to none but him.\nThe Master documented this phenomenon and reported it to the Emperor.\n\nThat winter, the Master was summoned once more and housed in a separate hall at **Zǐyáng Guān** (紫阳观).\nIn the autumn of the tenth year, the Master again humbly declined, requesting retirement. The Emperor composed a farewell poem to honor him.\n\nIn the eleventh year of **Dàlì** (大历), the Master, at the Emperor’s decree, gathered with his disciples—including **Wéi Jǐngzhāo** (韦景昭)—at the **Zǐyáng Guān** (紫阳观) to establish a **fasting hall** (斋院) on **Gāng Shān** (冈山), a separate mountain. His resolve was sincere and solemn.\n\nThat night, a **sweet dew** (甘露) descended upon the **Daoist altar** (仙坛) and the surrounding forest. The Master reported this to the Emperor, who specially praised the marvel.\n\nInitially, **Mr. Yǐnjū** (隐居先生) transmitted the *Three Caverns True Scriptures* (《三洞真经》) to **Master Shēngxiān** (升玄先生), who in turn passed them to **Master Tǐxiān** (体玄先生). **Master Tǐxiān** then entrusted them to **Master Zhèngyī** (正一先生), who finally transmitted them to the Master.\n\nThe Master was thus five generations removed from **Mr. Yǐnjū** (隐居先生), yet he fully inherited the **Great Dao’s True Teachings** (大正真法). Therefore, **Mount Máo** (茅山) became the ultimate source of Daoist learning for all under heaven.»\n\nAh, how the distinctions of right and wrong may be reconciled! The self and the world are one, and life and death may be forgotten—awake and dreaming are as one.\n\nThus, how could the mind be confined to the realm of change?\n\nIn the winter of the tenth month, on the fourteenth day of the *Jiǎyǒu* year of the *Dàlì* era (775 CE), the Master departed in seclusion at the separate retreat of Zìyáng (紫阳). He was eighty-seven years of age.\n\nOn the eighth day of the twelfth month, thousands of disciples arrived for his funeral, their mourning cries echoing like the *fèngguān* (奉冠乌) birds. His remains were interred at the western edge of Léipíng Shān (雷平山).\n\nBy his final decree, a pine coffin, bamboo staff, wooden table, water bottle, incense box, and incense burner were placed within the tomb. His disciples, revering his noble intentions, faithfully upheld his frugal virtue.\n\nThe Master’s thoughts were pure and sincere, his conduct ancient and refined. He penetrated the essence of life and vitality, his learning surpassing both humanity and the cosmos. Thus, he wandered freely in the Dao, esteemed as a sage by kings, honored with the privilege of riding in a palanquin, and summoned by imperial decree—once as the teacher of the Yellow Emperor, now as the guide of the Emperor Xuánzōng. He also mastered cursive script and excelled in composition, once remarking on the *Běn Cǎo* (本草) that its principles were vital to life and death, too profound for mere tradition, and thus compiled *Yīnyì* (音义) in two volumes.\n\nHe regarded the *Lǎozǐ*, *Zhuāngzǐ*, and *Zhōuyì* (周易) as texts of purity and stillness, writing *Xuéjì* (学记) and *Yìlüè* (义略), each in three sections, and *Nèixuéjì* (内学记) in two, continuing the legacy of the Daoist sages. His words were precise, his meaning vast.\n\nIn his youth, the Master was skilled in seal and clerical scripts, but his cursive was especially exquisite. A guest once praised it, saying, *\"He surpasses his father.\"* Thereupon, he cast aside his brush and wrote no more.\n\nEmperor Xuánzōng commanded the recluse Wáng Yìng to urgently request the Master’s calligraphic rendering of the *Thirteen Classics*, to fill the gaps left by Yáng and Xǔ.\n\nThough the Master was adept in *yīnyáng* (阴阳) divination and alchemy, he did not consider these his greatest achievements. Though he mastered elixir refinement and longevity practices, he did not seek them as ultimate ends. Instead, he embraced the simplicity of the uncarved block (*sùpǔ*), savoring the subtleties of the Dao’s depths. Who but the most boundless sage could fully grasp this?\n\nIn the second year of *Jiānyuán* (760 CE), Zhèng Qīng (真卿), as Prefect of Shèngzhou and Military Governor of Zhejiang’s western circuit, revered the Emperor’s virtue and aspired to the mysteries of the Dao. He sent a special envoy to Máo Shān with a letter expressing his sincerity.\n\nThe Master had Wéi Liànshī (韦炼师) Jǐngzhāo (景昭) reply. Zhèng Qīng’s devotion was profound, inspiring his lofty aspirations. Yet though the Master was his revered teacher, the distance to the Celestial Bureaus was vast, and imperial duties kept him from lingering. He could only entrust his longing to the white clouds.\n\nIn the sixth year of *Dàlì* (771 CE), Zhèng Qīng was transferred from Línchuān to Hào Xīng, his hopes of retiring to Xiǎolǐng and honoring the Master’s legacy thwarted. Wandering through the prefectures, he carried only his reverence for the Dao, gazing at the forests in vain, forever bound by his unfulfilled vow.\n\nThen, Jǐngzhāo and Guō Hóng (郭闳), moved by the Master’s virtuous legacy, sought to inscribe his deeds on stone. They invited the Daoist Liú Míngsù (刘明素) to draft the text.\n\nZhèng Qīng, who had once exchanged visits with the Master’s disciples—Zhōng Lín Zǐyīn (中林子殷淑) and Wéi Qú Móu (韦渠牟)—and heard of his transcendent virtue, dared not presume to rank himself among the common folk, let alone the primordial chaos. His inscription reads:\n\n*\"Embracing the One, boundless and mysterious—\nThe foundation of humanity.\nThe Master wielded *qi* like a king, his spirit unyielding.\nHe unveiled the Dao’s profound truths,\nIlluminating the Gate of Mysteries.\nThus he became the Emperor’s teacher,\nAnd the Dao flourished in peace.\nSweet dew descended as an omen,\nSpiritual mushrooms sprouted as portents.\nThe noble respond in awe,\nHis lofty virtue spreads far.\nThe crane returns to the Celestial Hall,\nThe clouds depart from the Imperial City.\nIn retreat, he grows old,\nHis wisdom in action and stillness.\nVirtue knows no burden,\nThe Dao’s heart is ever constant.\nWhen the sun sets on the body,\nWho compares to seated forgetfulness?\nCarved stones mark his tomb,\nHis name forever fragrant.\nThough valleys shift and mounds decay,\nHis light endures ever brighter.\"*\n\nThis stele was erected in the summer of the fifth month of *Dàlì*’s twelfth year (777 CE), inscribed by the *Bóhǎi* (渤海) master Hào Chóngxiū (昊崇休).\n\nAt its head, the seal inscription reads: *\"Three Caverns of Zìyáng, Grand Master Jǐngzhāo’s Stele.\"* Flanking it are carvings of *Xiāo Shǐ* (萧史) and *Nòng Yù* (弄玉).\n\nThe inscription was composed by Lù Chángyuán (陆长源), then *Dàfū* (大夫), *Jiǎnshā* (检校) *Guózǐ Shìyè* (国子司业), and *Yùshì Zhōngchéng* (御史中丞), an *Kāiguó Nán* (开国男) of Hào Commandery (昊郡).\n\nThe calligraphy and seal were executed by Dòu Zhòng (窦众), then *Cháo Yì Dàfū* (朝议大夫), *Jiǎnshā Shàngshū Bīngbù Lángzhōng* (检校尚书兵部郎中), and *Shì Yù Zhōnggǔn* (侍御史上柱国).\n\n*\"He who governs the cosmos,\nSuspends the sun and moon,\nAnd first guides the myriad transformations—\nThis is none other than the Dao.\n\nHe who unites the sacred and divine,\nEncompasses all categories,\nAnd stands alone among the hundred spirits—\nThis is none other than humanity.\n\nThe Dao encompasses the undifferentiated origin,\nNurturing the myriad transformations.\nHumanity embodies purity and completeness,\nHarmonizing the hundred spirits.\n\nThus, humanity gathers blessings through the Dao,\nAnd the Dao attains fulfillment through humanity.\nThe unspeakable function manifests in creation,\nThe silent virtue permeates all life.\nDissolving in boundless spontaneity,\nTranscending the subtle and mysterious—\nHe blends with the celestial resonance,\nEnduring alongside the valley’s spirit.\"*\n\n**Zìyáng Zhēnrén Dàfāshī** (紫阳真人大法师), named **Jǐngzhāo** (景昭), with the courtesy name **Huáibǎo** (怀宝), was originally from Yánlíng (延陵), Dānyáng (丹阳).\n\nHis lineage traced back to **Zhuānxū Dà Pēng** (颛顼大彭), a descendant of the **Yú** dynasty as **Táotáng Shì** (陶唐氏), of the **Xià** as **Yùlóng Shì** (御龙氏), and of the **Shāng** as **Shǐwéi Shì** (豕韦氏), adopting the clan name from the state.\n\nHis virtuous lineage extended to his descendant **Mèng** (孟), who served as **Chǔ’s Grand Tutor** (楚太傅). His descendant **Xián** (贤) became **Han’s Chancellor** (汉丞相), and **Zhāo** (昭) entered **Wú** as **Shìzhōng** (侍中). His brother **Shèn** (慎) held the office of **Sīkōng** (司空). The Master was the sixteenth descendant of Sīkōng.\n\nWhen Sīkōng passed away, he was buried in Yánlíng, and his descendants settled there. His ancestor **Dàohuì** (道会) and father **Sīxì** (思戏) both cultivated simplicity in seclusion, their virtue and reclusiveness recorded among the immortals.\n\nThe Master’s mother, **Liú Shīfāng** (留师方娠), conceived under auspicious signs. From infancy, he displayed extraordinary talent, embodying the essence of *yuánhé* (元和) and the subtlety of *tàixuān* (太玄). Initially, he gained recognition through his mastery of *sùshū* (素书), aligning with the *Xúnxiān Guàn* (寻仙观) in Yánlíng. Later, he became known as *Dāntái* (丹台), residing at the *Sùmíng Guàn* (肃明观) in Cháng’ān.\n\nThe Master, under the reign of **Xuánzōng** (玄宗) and **Guǎngchéng** (广成), sought the **Dao/Way** (道), savoring the **Divine Vitality** (神) of **Gūshè** (姑射). He let his mind rest in the realm of **congealed stillness** (凝寂), and his body repose beneath the **serene and pure heavens** (穆清). Thus, the Master attained the **feathered insignia and golden records** (羽仪金录), the **jade belt of the Precious Ones** (颉顽玉绳), and was renowned throughout the capital for two decades.\n\nThen, he declined the imperial court, yearning to return to his native lands, and once more affiliated with the **Tàipíng Guàn** (太平观) of **Máoshān** (茅山). During the **Tiān Bǎo** (天宝) era, **Xīng Xuánjìng** (兴玄静) received an imperial decree to perform meritorious deeds, constructing the **Zǐyáng Guàn** (紫阳观), where the Master resided.\n\nThereafter, in the **Alchemy Hall** (炼丹院), he transmitted the **Yellow and White Elixir** (黄素) techniques and perfected the **fasting and sacrificial rites** (斋醮). Divine clouds and auspicious cranes soared above the altar, while **ambrosial dew and sacred fungi** (甘露神芝) descended into his courtyard.\n\nInitially, the Master studied under the **Grand Master** (大法师) **Bāo Shìróng** (包士荣), who in turn had learned from **Bāo Fǎzhěng** (包法整), a **Daoist** (道士) of the **Chónghuán Guàn** (崇玄观). **Bāo Fǎzhěng** had been taught by **Bāo Fǎngguǎng** (包方广), a **Superior Adept** (上士), who had followed **Wáng Guǐ** (王轨), a **Daoist** of the **Huáyáng Guàn** (华阳观). **Wáng Guǐ** had been instructed by **Shēng Xuán** (升玄) **Wáng Yuǎnzhī** (王远知), and **Wáng Yuǎnzhī** in turn by the **Huáyáng Hermit** (华阳隐居) **Táo Hóngjǐng** (陶弘景).\n\nFrom the **Source of the Dao** (道源), descending through successive generations, the **Wayist teachings** (玄教) flourished. Those of the **Jade Chamber** (玉堂) and **Silver Enclosure** (银阙), as well as disciples under **feathered banners and hairy insignia** (羽盖毛旌), left no vacancy in their ranks, each era producing its own successors.\n\nThe Master’s conduct was in harmony with the **transcendent transformations** (玄化), and his wisdom aligned with the **divine creation** (灵造). What he possessed, all things could not fail to possess; what he lacked, all things could not fail to lack. Life and death were measured by the seasons, while fullness and emptiness were observed like the dawn and dusk of the cosmos. His **cloud-pearl belt** (云外虎头之佩) and **snow-lotus crane-feather robe** (雪中鹤氅之裘) marked his refinement, while he nurtured his children with **Daoist simplicity** (玄) even as an infant. His lineage traced back to **Comrade Yú** (仇公) and **Ancestor Huáng Tài** (黄太), his teachings passed down through **transmission and instruction** (传授), and his **elixirs and prescriptions** (服饵) extended his lifespan.\n\nThose who served him with **attendant staff and sandals** (侍杖屦) were drawn from the nearby **secluded regions of the Jiang-Hu** (江湖). Those who recorded his **scriptures and teachings** (经录) were akin to the **sages of the Mò Sì** (沬泗) era.\n\nFor three generations, he dwelled in the mountain halls. His **return to the divine** (还神) coincided with the passage of time, and his **silent spirit** (寂魄) mirrored the **cessation of all phenomena** (物故). In the **Chéngyuán** (贞元) year one, on the **Gǔmào** (癸卯) day, he **shed his mortal form** (委蜕) at the **Zǐyáng Daoist precinct** (紫阳之道场), his visage serene and his movements natural, at the age of ninety-two.\n\nOn the **Jǐyǒu** (己酉) day of that month, his **divine essence** (神) was relocated to the **left of the Mortuary Temple of Xuánjìng** (玄静先生寿宫) on the **western slope of Léipíngshān** (雷平山).\n\nHe transmitted his **Daoist arts** (道术) to **Sūzhōu** (苏州) **Lóngxīng Guàn** (龙兴观) **Daoist** **Gāo Dòngxū** (皋洞虚), who mastered the **marvelous techniques of Chōngxū** (冲虚) and followed the **mystical traces of Shàngzhēn** (上真). Thus, the **Way** spread among the **marketplaces of Liang** (梁市) and the **Huáyáng** (华阳) region.\n\nThe **Daoist** **Wéi Chóngxún** (韦崇询) oversaw the **fasting and sacrificial rites** (斋醮), maintaining strict **postures and rhythms** (俯仰节度).\n\nThe **Daoist** **Zhū Huìmíng** (朱惠明) managed the **scriptures and secret precepts** (法录经书), refining the **Daoist mysteries** (修真秘诀).\n\nThe Master compiled the **Register of the Immortals** (仙录), aligning with the **pivotal Daoist principles** (道枢). His **divine essence encompassed the Primordial Void** (神含混元), and his **virtue/power harmonized with the Pure and Undefiled** (德与纯粹). He **guided the uninitiated and communicated with spirits** (诱进草动，感通众灵), transcending the bounds of the world and rising above the **profane dust of life** (风尘).\n\nYet when he engaged with worldly affairs, his **Daoist essence mingled with the commonplace** (迹混俗尘), he **uphold loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝) to govern himself, and **demonstrated trustworthiness and righteousness** (信义) in his actions. His ways adapted to the times without conforming to any fixed **Daoist vessel** (器), for who could emulate his **constant Dao** (常道)?\n\n**Zhèjiāng** (浙江) **Shùxī** (束西) **Nóngdù** (节度) **Zhǐdù** (支度) **Pàn Guān** (判官), **Chéngxiào** (检校) **Shàngshū** (尚书) **Bīngbù** (兵部) **Lángzhōng** (郎中) and **attendant censor** (兼侍御史) **Fǔfēng Dòu Gōng** (扶风窦公) remarked:\n\n*\"The Master’s **Daoist essence** (道) was vast, his **meritorious deeds** (功) blending with the **boundless void** (混茫). His **Daoist resonance** (声) harmonized with the **Daoist currents** (道濑), and his **principles** (理) aligned with the **Source of Virtue** (德源). We **honor the shrine of Qín Gāo** (琴高) and **preserve the transmission of Wù Guāng** (务光), his **words** like **sagely inscribed calligraphy** (征副墨), his **actions** refining **other mountains’ teachings** (用琢他山).*\n\nHis **words** were thus:\n\n*\"The Dao is supreme, its **meritorious deeds** (功) vast and boundless.\"*\n\nThe Master’s **Dao** is nearly universal, yet he soars in harmony with the **Way**.\n\nHis **subtle resonance** (素韵) congeals in stillness, his **mysterious power** (玄功) eternally refined.\nHe **originates formless** (肇形) beyond all bounds, his **enlightenment** (启迪) surpassing even radiance.\n\nThe **venerable** (娇娇) Master of **Law** (法师), graced with **blessings** (锡羡) from **Huangyang** (华阳).\nHis **clan’s lineage** (本族) commands the age, tracing back to **Yu** (虞) and the **Tang** (唐).\nHe **tamed dragons** (御龙) for the **Xia** (夏), **dwelled among the Boar and the Wei** (豕韦居商).\n\nHis **divine aura** (疑然灵表) shone bright from youth.\nHis **principles** (理) surpassed **Rongcheng** (容成), his **nature** (质) matched **Xi Huang** (夏黄).\n\nIn **pursuit of immortals** (寻仙), his **trace** (发迹) began with **austerity** (肃明), then flourished.\nHe **paid homage at night** (宵礼) to the **Golden Hall** (金殿), **offered morning worship** (晨朝) to the **Jade Emperor** (玉皇).\nHis **Daoist gatherings** (丹台道倡) echoed in the **White Cloud Imperial Domain** (白云帝乡).\n\n**Chu Mountain** (楚山) spans ten thousand **li**, his **native land** (故国) **Danyang** (丹阳).\nThe **temple bells** (醮宫呜磬) and **incense chambers** (斋室焚香) resound with sacred rites.\n**Jade sprouts** (芝) in the courtyard, **cranes dance** (鹤舞) upon the **altars** (坛场).\n\nThe **Tea God’s hidden grotto** (茅君秘洞), **Bo’s authentic prescriptions** (葛氏真方).\nHis **coming and going** (来时去顺) follow **Peng and Zao** (齐彭洎殇).\nHe **transforms scales** (化鳞) in **Yuan’s wind** (风袁), **sheds his husk** (委蜕) in **Yan’s clouds** (云酿).\n\nThe **peaks stretch endlessly** (峰峦逦逦), **pines and cassia** (松桂) stand **ancient and verdant** (苍苍).\n**Dust clings** (尘生) to his **staff and sandals** (杖屦), **moss stains** (苔染) his **hat and box** (巾箱).\n**Dragons bear** (龙衔) his **auspicious banner** (彩咤), **tigers clasp** (虎缀) his **sacred pouch** (盘囊).\n\nHis **secluded halls** (闱风玄圃) and **jade-pillared pavilions** (瑶轩玉堂) hold eternal reverence.\nWe **cherish his memory as if he were still present** (追存如在), **ceaselessly extol his virtue** (颂德不忘).\n\nA **lonely peak returns** (孤石归然), its **millions of layers** (万古连冈) standing firm.\n\nIn the **third year of Zhengyuan** (贞元三年), on the **first day of the first month** (正月上元之辰), its construction began.\n\nThe **Taipingguan Daoists** (太平观道士): **Xu Yuanze** (徐元沼), **Xu Ze** (徐则), and **Xu Changjiu** (许长久),\n**Xu Ze** (许则) particularly renowned for his **public service** (公干),\nall **devotedly upholding the True Dao** (虔奉真宗).\nTheir **words of loyalty** (忠本) were inscribed by **Jia Lianwen** (贾练文) on the **stele of the Saintly Ancestor’s Hall** (元圣祖院碑).\n\nIn the **second year of Baoli** (宝历二年), the **year of Bingwu** (丙午), the **linked commanders of the Zhe Right** (浙右连帅) and **Grand Censor** (御史大夫) **Zanhuang Gong** (赞皇公) rebuilt the **Saintly Ancestor’s Hall** (圣祖院) below **Damao Peak** (大茅峰),\nbefore **Chongyuan Temple** (崇元观), and to the **south of Huangyang’s Celestial Cave** (天华阳洞之南门).\nThey **gathered the spirits of grass immortals** (集草仙之灵庆), **bestowing eternal blessings** (资圣寿於亿万).\n\nThe **foundation’s origin** (本其经始) was truly inspired by **Master Zhou** (周先生), who **responded to Changyun** (昌运) and became **Tang Guangcheng** (唐广成).\nHe **recommended the divine signs** (荐瑞表祥), **permanently honoring the immortal** (式旌不朽).\nThus, the **enlightened decree** (恩锡) bestowed the **hall’s name** (院额), calling it **Baoli Chongyuan Saintly Ancestor’s Hall** (宝历崇元圣祖院).\n\nThe **Daoist gates flourished** (玄门之盛), their **glory illuminating cliffs and valleys** (辉动岩谷).\nAt that time, the **Tang Dynasty** (唐) had **prospered for two hundred and nine years** (兴二百有九载).\nThe **Son of Heaven** (天子), with **divine might** (神圣) and **martial virtue** (武文),\n**bestowed the new title** (新景命) upon him.\nHis **virtue aligned** (德合) with the **mysterious teachings** (玄训) of the **Five Thousand Characters** (五千文),\nhis **enlightenment continued** (明继) the **grand achievements** (丕业) of the **Twelve Saints** (十二圣).\nHe **drew from the Dao’s source** (清静源化理), **bestowed benevolent longevity** (仁寿域生灵),\n**nurturing them in harmony** (陶之以太和), **elevating them to ultimate order** (跻之於至顺).\n\nThus, when he **ascended the throne** (临御大宝), he **commanded all officials** (诏百辟),\n**extending his sincerity to all lands** (旁延万邦), **seeking the Dao of governance** (征访治道).\nDay and night, he **diligently pursued virtue** (寤寐孜孜), as if **afraid of failing** (如恐不及).\n\nFor the **Son of Heaven** (明天子) to **strive for the Dao** (勤求于上),\nthe **worthy feudal lords** (贤邦伯) must **respond in kind** (感致于下).\nWhen **sovereign and ministers share the same virtue** (君臣一德), then **Dao and virtue flourish** (而道德可兴).\n\nThat very year, in the **seventh month** (秋七月), the **Grand Censor** (公), following the **Son of Heaven’s command** (天子之命),\n**fasted and purified himself** (斋戒虔恳), and **succeeded in receiving Master Zhou’s guidance** (果得周先生日):\n*\"The **息元皇** (息元皇) is the **completeness of the True Dao** (元精之全德), the **supreme teacher of the Dao** (大道之宗师).*\nThe **Master** (先生) **preserved his True Nature** (葆真抱一), **contained his radiance** (涵光吹万).\nFor ages, the **world has listened to his Daoist winds** (天下聆其风者久矣).\nYet his **spirit soared far** (遐襟旷边), **hidden in the boundless void** (冥寄希夷),\n**revealing or concealing itself** (显晦自我), **none could truly recognize him** (人莫能识).\n\nThe **Dao’s mysteries** (玄珠) cannot be **grasped by vulgar words** (吃诟可索),\nthe **highest truth** (至道) can only be **attained through sincere devotion** (精诚是致).\nThus, even **successive sages** (累圣) could not **awaken him** (不能起),\nyet in **one moment**, the **Son of Heaven’s harmony** (洪化) **inspired his resonance** (感契),\nand he **came to ponder** (需然来思), saying to the **Grand Censor** (公):\n*\"In the past, **Guangcheng** (广成) **responded to the Dao’s principles** (对理身之问),\n**Hongmeng** (鸿蒙) **opened the teachings of cultivation** (启养心之说).\nBoth are the **Son of Heaven’s supreme origins** (皇上大本).\nNow, **息元** (息元) will also **ascend with this Dao** (以斯道上报吾君).\"*\n\nThe **Grand Censor** (公) then **cleared his heart and refined his spirit** (澄心清神),\n**pondering how to celebrate the **Son of Heaven’s blessings** (皇休) and **promote his prosperity** (赞景福).\nHe **consulted with Master Zhou** (遂与先生图议), **selecting a site for the Daoist hall** (选置玄宇).\nComparing **landscapes**, none surpassed this **peak’s divine essence** (形胜).\nIn **ancient Liang** (梁朝), the **Prince of Fuxiang** (福乡太子) established **two Daoist halls** (道馆二),\nbut the **old altar** (古坛) and **wells** (废井) remain, their **ruins still visible** (遗址犹在).\n\nThus, they **cleared wild growth and leveled rough terrain** (铲荒夷险),\n**constructed tiered halls** (讲起层构),\n**distributed their salaries** (散俸钱) to fund the work,\n**selected capable officials** (择干吏) to oversee the labor,\n**and completed it swiftly** (单飞矢直), **without delay** (不日而成).\n\nThe **images and altars** (像设) were **grand and solemn** (崇严),\nthe **halls and pavilions** (殿宇) **deep and majestic** (沉邃).\n\nThe **Daoist rituals and ceremonial guards** (神仙仪卫) stood in solemn array (左右森列).\nThey followed the **ancient rites of the Historians** (旧史氏),\nretrieving **Confucius’ inquiries on ritual** (仲尼问礼) and the **symbols of Master Guan’s request for scripture** (关尹请着书之象),\nall duly prepared before them (咸备于前).\n\nThey sought to **unify the Dao with the numinous** (会通仙) and **solemnly order the myriad spirits** (肃百灵),\nthus **eternally establishing this site as the finest for state rituals and Daoist observances** (斋醮之胜选).\nMoreover, the **refined qi of the Three Teachings** (三茅精气) and the **fragrant might of the Two Xu** (二许馨烈),\nfrom antiquity to the present, have **yielded their Dao to worthy seekers** (得道者).\nUpon examining the **ancient records and verified maps** (传验图),\none could **ascend to greet them** (攀揖).\n\nWithin the **enclosed courtyards** (缭垣之内),\nthere were **flowing springs and fine trees** (流泉嘉木),\n**nurturing the land’s hidden luster and refined elegance** (滋饰幽润).\nThe **earth’s numinous essence and scenery’s grace** (地灵境秀),\nwhen touched upon, **inspired ever-greater virtues** (触类增益).\nThus, they **labored to perfect this achievement** (懋此成绩),\n**matching the mountain’s boundless splendor** (与山无穷).\n\nIn reverence, they **contemplate the Sage Ancestor** (圣祖),\nwho **nurtured virtue before the Great Ultimate** (育德乎太极之前),\nand **manifested benevolence beyond form** (显仁於未形之表).\nAt that time, **unification and dispersion, concealment and revelation** (合散消息),\nwere **beyond mortal comprehension** (莫可名象).\nYet, **clarity became the sun and moon** (明而为日月),\n**movement the winds and thunder** (动而为风雷).\n**Propagation was limitless** (播育而不测),\n**operation without cessation** (运行而不殆).\nThe **Lord obtained this as the Boar’s hide** (豕韦),\n**to govern the heavens and earth** (挈天地),\nwhile the **subject gained it as the sage Fu’s counsel** (傅说),\n**to aid the King Wu Ding** (相武丁).\nWhat then is my role? (吾何为哉)\n\nThe **Dao is a singular thread** (道本一贯),\nyet when **spiritual transformations rise** (神化挺生),\n**it contains the luminous chapters** (含章炳灵),\n**mirroring the Emperor’s primal essence** (象帝之先).\nThus, they **lend me the name of strength** (资我强名),\n**to proclaim the Dao’s hidden pivot** (寄言以显玄枢),\nand **bestow blessings upon the Imperial lineage** (锡羡以兴皇业).\n\nLike the **dragon appearing first** (龙既见),\n**all things then take form** (万物方睹).\nHence, it is fitting that **rest and blessings descend** (垂休储祉),\n**prolonging auspicious signs** (长发其祥).\n**Ten thousand blessings converge** (亿万斯庆),\n**gathered at this hall of宝历** (集于宝历),\n**so this new hall of崇元 is opened in due time** (所以得时而启也).\n\nInitially, the **Lord sought Daoist masters** (上方) who **revered the Way and its teachings** (崇向道德之士),\n**worthy of this grand selection** (可以当是大选者).\nOnly **Master Zhou** (周先生) was deemed fit.\nThus, the **Lord’s sincerity and devotion** (忠尽) in summoning him,\nand the **meticulous verification** (精实) in seeking the right teacher,\n**compelled Master Zhou to emerge** (则先生不得不出),\nwhile the **Lord’s integrity and solemnity shone forth** (公之诚节不得不伸).\n\nWhen the **Imperial favor was met and satisfied** (圣情感惬),\n**all nations gazed in celebration** (万国瞻贺),\nthe **Lord’s attentive reception** (逢迎之优异) and **grave reverence** (礼貌之严显)\nexceeded even the **ancient traditions of honoring teachers and the Dao** (尊师重道之盛).\nThus, the **True Dao’s profound essence** (真宗玄极) and the **ultimate Way’s refined core** (至道之精)\n**must resonate with the Lord’s highest intentions** (洞契乎上心),\n**and be proclaimed through the most sacred arts** (播宣於至术),\nso that **its influence permeates far and wide** (风流泽浸),\n**benefiting all eight regions** (广被八区).\nThis is why **Master Zhou emerged without hesitation** (先生出而不疑),\n**and why the world must emulate the Lord’s devotion** (亦所以示天下之不可不致如己者).\n\nAt this **juncture of the Lord’s ultimate wisdom** (至理),\n**aligning with the Dao’s practicable path** (可行),\n**a thousand-year opportunity arises** (千载一期),\n**fulfilled in this very moment** (起乃时耳).\n\n**The Lord, with his talents as vast as the Yellow River** (蚓公以济代全材),\n**harmonizing with the bright and auspicious** (合乎休明),\n**established the Way in the southern realm** (树风南藩),\n**his deeds surpassing all under heaven** (绩最天下).\nLast year, when **he undertook the construction of the Confucian school** (兴建儒学),\n**the heavens showered blessings** (天降膏露),\n**manifested in the temple courtyard** (显于庙庭).\n**Customs transformed and winds shifted** (俗变风移),\n**thus leading to the Dao’s flourishing** (遂至於道).\n\nNow, **the hall’s splendor and the Dao’s revelation** (辉崇真馆, 阐奉玄化)\n**resonate with the Lord’s enlightened decrees** (上感睿旨),\n**and win the trust of all people** (下孚元元).\n**Benevolence harmonizes with the flow of qi** (仁声顺气),\n**spreading abundantly across the four boundaries** (流溢四境).\n\nIf **this governance is expanded and upheld** (推是为政),\n**then the Lord’s use of the Dao to rule the land and nation becomes evident** (致君经国之用可见矣).\nAgain, **within the sealed domain** (封部之内) and **beneath the harmonious purges** (融汰之下),\n**those with narrow understanding of the Dao’s origins** (褊识玄元之教)\nare **all mere mortals** (煨场之人).\nWhat then is the difficulty? (顾难乎哉)\n\n**The Lord’s meticulous records of the city’s attributes** (炼谬列属城),\n**gained through careful investigation** (获详事实),\n**and his study of the Dao through the Spring and Autumn Annals’

(八月庚戌),\nthe **three disciples of the Upper Clarity Daoist Hall** (上清玄都大洞三景弟子),\n**the Just and Proper Grand Officer** (正议大夫),\n**the Commissioner with Military Authority over Runzhou**

Duke** (上柱国),\n**the Founding Male of赞皇 County** (赞皇县开国男),\n**with an estate of three hundred households** (食邑三百户),\n**and granted the Purple Gold Fish Bag** (赐紫金鱼袋) **Li Deyu** (李德裕),\n**erected this hall in honor of the Daoist Sage Lao** (於茅山崇元观南敬造老君殿院),\n**and carved statues of Lao, Confucius, and the True Person Master Yin** (及造老君、孔子、尹真人像三躯).\nAll were **modeled after ancient texts and preserved traditions** (皆按史籍遗文),\n**to ensure their enduring legacy** (庶垂不朽).\n**This inscription is recorded in reverence** (谨记).\n\n「Confucius, according to the *Records of the Grand Historian* (《史记》),\nwent to the Zhou capital and intended to ask about rites from Laozi.\nLaozi said: \"What you speak of, its person and bones are both already decayed,\nonly their words remain in the ears.\nMoreover, a gentleman, when his time comes, rides in a carriage;\nwhen his time does not come, he walks in rags.\nI have heard that a skilled merchant conceals his goods as if they were nonexistent,\nand a gentleman of great virtue and noble bearing appears as if he were foolish.\nAbandon your proud *qi* and your licentious spirit—\nthese bring no benefit to your body.\nWhat I have told you is this.\"\n\nConfucius departed and said to his disciples:\n\"Ah, I know the crow can fly;\nthe fish, I know can swim;\nthe beast, I know can run.\nThe running can be ensnared in nets,\nthe swimming can be caught with lines,\nthe flying can be trapped with snares.\nBut as for the dragon,\nI do not know if it rides the wind and clouds to ascend to heaven—\ntoday, I have seen Laozi,\nhis *qi* is like that of a dragon, is it not?\"\n\n**Master Yin the True Person** (尹真人),\naccording to the *Records of the Grand Historian* (《史记》),\nLaozi dwelled long in Zhou,\nand seeing its decline, retreated to the Pass of Guanzhong.\nThe Governor of the Pass, Yin Xi (尹喜),\nsaid: \"Master, you are about to depart in seclusion,\nyet you are strong—please write a book for me.\"\nThus Laozi wrote the *Dao De Jing* (《道德经》),\nits upper and lower chapters,\nwith over five thousand words on the Way and virtue,\nand then departed.\n\nThe *Biographies of Immortals* (《列仙传》) states:\nYin Xi, the Governor of the Pass,\nwas a Zhou Grand Officer (大夫),\nskilled in internal learning (内学).\nHe consumed the essence of the starry hosts,\nconcealed his virtue and practiced benevolence,\nso that people of his time knew nothing of him.\nWhen Laozi journeyed westward,\nYin Xi first perceived his *qi*,\nknew the True Person was passing by,\nand sought him out, meeting him in person.\nLaozi also recognized his singularity,\nand wrote the book for him.\nTogether they went to the west of Liu Sha (流沙),\nwhere Yin Xi consumed the *giant victory fruit* (巨胜实),\nand none knew his ultimate fate.\n\nIn the Tang dynasty, the *Stone Lamp Record* (《石灯记》)\nlists **Acupuncturist and Daoist Sage Hè Sībǎo** (贺思宝)\nas the merit-maker (功德主)\nwho, in reverence, constructed the **Eternal Brightness Lamp Tower** (长明灯台)\nwithin the **Treasure Hall** (宝殿),\nto provide perpetual offerings.\n\nIn the **Baolì Era, Year Dingwù** (宝历三年丁未岁),\non the **15th day of the 2nd month, Dingwù** (二月十五日丁未),\nthe Daoist disciples of the **Upper Clarity Three Caverns** (上清三洞)\n—**Chen Huìméi** (陈惠瑁)—\nrecorded the inscription,\nand the artisans **Lè An** (乐安),\n**Jiǎng Hún** (蒋浑),\nand **Male Qīnglín** (男清磷) carved it.\n\nIn the **Qí Era** (齐建元劫),\nthe **Chóngyuán Pavilion** (崇元馆) was established;\nin the **Zhēnguān Era** (唐贞观劫),\nit was renamed the **Chóngyuán Hall** (崇元观);\nin the **Song Era, Great Zhōngxiángfú** (宋大中祥符劫),\nit was encouraged to change its name to the **Chóngshòu Hall** (崇寿观).\n\nThe **Eternal Brightness Stone Lamp** (长明石灯)\nof the **Tàiyuán Hall** (太元殿)\nwas constructed in the **Baolì Era, Year Dingwù** (宝历三年丁未岁).\nThis corresponds to the **Tàihé Era of Emperor Wénzōng** (文宗太和元年),\na span of **four hundred ninety-eight years**.\n\nIn the **Great Yuan Era, Year Jiǎzǐ** (大元泰定甲子),\nthe **Chóngshòu Hall Master** (崇寿观主),\n**Zhāng Suìzhēn of Hào Commandery** (昊郡张嗣真),\nhad this lamp restored and inscribed.\n\nThe inscription reads:\n\n*\"The Heaven of Huáyáng* (华阳之天),\n*the Court of Flowing Gold* (流金之庭).\"\n\nThe radiance of yin shines bright as the sun’s essence,\nilluminating day and night with boundless clarity.\n\nThe divine lamp gleams resplendent—\ntwo luminous wonders, the law of light.\n\nPlanted here to the south, it stands eternal,\na beacon through the eons of the lesser kalpa.\n\nWith reverence, I bow to the Lord of Destiny,\npiercing the depths of the Supreme Mysteries.\n\nGuiding mortals and immortals alike,\nits flame spreads like fire passed from hand to hand.\n\n---\n*Teachán Zhì* (茅山志), Volume Twenty-Three, concludes.\n\n---\n*Táng* stele recording the **Upper Clarity Successor Sect Master Liú Dàbīn** (上清嗣宗师刘大彬) construction,\nfrom the *Record of Gold and Stone* (录金石篇).\n\nThe **Stele of Master Wáng Jūn Chénsù, the Pure and Virtuous Sage of the Grand Daoist Tradition of the Táng**\n\nComposed and inscribed by **Xú Xiāo** (徐铉), *Chéngyì Láng* (朝议郎), Overseer of the *Shàngshū Yìbù Lángzhōng* (守尚书祠部郎中), Keeper of the *Zhī Zhìguì* (知制诰), *Wǔqí Wèiwèi* (武骑尉), and granted the *Zìyǔ Jīndài* (紫金鱼袋).\n\n---\n\nThe **Supreme Dao** (至道) first emerged—\nhow vast and rare it is! Since the invention of writing,\nits traces may be discerned.\n\nThe **Yellow Emperor**, **Yáo**, and **Shùn** clarified its origins,\nthus they wore simple robes and behaved with reverence,\ngoverning the world in gentle harmony.\n\n**Bóyáng** (伯阳) and **Zhòngní** (仲尼) expounded its applications,\nthus they established teachings and cultivated **virtue/power** (德),\nendless in their statutes and precepts.\n\n**Chìsōng** (赤松) and **Xiànmén** (羡门) divinely illuminated its mysteries,\nthus they ascended lightly as honored guests.\n**Liú Lǐhòu** (留侯) and **Shāng Hào** (商皓) transformed and harmonized its ways,\nthus they dispelled omens and extinguished near calamities.\n\nFollowing this Dao downward through the ages,\nnone fail to adhere to it.\n\nThus there are **scholars and officials** (缙绅) of upright bearing,\nbenefiting all under the **regal halls** (庙堂).\nAnd there are those in **rough hemp garments** (葛巾) and **fragrant sashes** (蕙带),\npreserving **yin virtue/power** (阴功) beyond the dust of mortal life.\n\nThough their aims differ—hidden or revealed—\ntheir aspirations converge in the same end.\n\nWhen their bodies perish,\ntheir **qi-spirits** (魄) remain undying.\nThe **Enclosure of Winds** (闱风) and the **Mysterious Grove** (玄圃)\nare the **secret cities** (密都) of the **Grass Sovereign** (草帝);\n**Red City** (赤城) and **Hua Mountain** (华阳)\nare the abodes of the **Immortal Saints** (仙圣).\n\nThe **radiant soul** (光灵) and **liver-snakes** (肝蛮) appear as if at their side—\n**Noble Persons** (仁人) and **Principled Gentlemen** (君子)\noften arrive there. In **Master Wáng Chénsù** (贞素先生),\nwe see this realized.\n\nHis given name was **Qīxiá** (栖霞), his courtesy name **Xuányǐn** (玄隐).\nHe inherited the **Hua Sect** (华宗), a gift of accumulated **virtue/power** (德).\nBorn in **Qí** (齐), he received its **vast and noble winds** (泱泱之风);\nraised in **Lǔ** (鲁), he learned its **refined and harmonious teachings** (徇徇之教).\n\n「At seven years old, he was a prodigious child who passed the imperial examinations;\nby fifteen, he mastered the breadth of Confucian and historical texts.\nAmong the Min scholars’ disciples and the young of the realm,\nnone dared walk beside him, and all bowed before his wisdom.\nEven the feudal lords of the **Enclosure of Winds** (闱风)\nyielded to his virtue and took their seats behind him.\n\nYet his **Daoist talent** (仙才) and **luminous qi** (灵气)\nwere bestowed by nature itself—\nthe entanglements of worldly affairs and the bonds of mortal existence\ncould not restrain him.\n\nHe often journeyed alone to the sacred mountains,\nwhere his spirit resonated in harmony with the divine.\nStrange and fleeting phenomena unfolded before him—\nnone could fathom their meaning.\n\nIn the year **Dīngmǎo** (丁卯), when Heaven’s favor was upon him,\nhe fled the chaos of war and crossed southward,\nreaching **Shòuchūn** (寿春).\nWitnessing the **fragmentation of the Four Seas** (四海之分崩),\nhe reflected upon the **Legacy of the Eight Immortals** (八公之遗迹),\nand thus removed his scholar’s cap, took the name **Lù** (路),\nand surrendered himself to the **Mysterious Dao** (玄门).\n\n**Master Wénzhèng** (问政先生) **Plěi Jūn** (聂君)\nbeheld him and marveled at his presence,\nbestowing upon him the **Law of the Thread** (法线).\nOn that very day, **rainbow clouds** (彩云) and **radiant cranes** (皓鹤)\nhovered and danced in the sky for a long time.\n\nLater, he explored the **wandering realm of the recluse** (若士之遨游)\nand attained the **victorious domain of the Master of Bundles** (束卿之胜境).\nThe **Dao/Way** (道) is everywhere—\nwho would not seek its guidance?\nHe then followed **Master Wēiyí Dèng Jūn** (威仪邓君),\nwho opened his heart to distant teachings,\nand received the *Great Cavern True Scripture* (《大洞真经》).\nIts **profound and secret principles** (玄科秘旨)\nwere ever his source of consultation.\n\nHe took refuge in the **blessed Daoist land** (福地仙源),\nclearing brush and hacking paths to dwell there,\nresting on stones and washing with streams.\nThough his body was hidden, his name grew ever more renowned;\nthough his **Dao/Way** (道) was silent, his conduct became all the more resolute.\nThe **mulberry fields** (桑田) changed, yet the **cinnamon trees** (桂树) endured.\n\nHis **fierce ancestor**, **Emperor Xiàogāo** (孝高皇帝),\nstill lingered in the **Guest Hall of the Spirits** (宾门),\ntruly arriving to preside over his legacy.\n\nThe **purple-black markings** (紫黑) signified the **True Person’s** (真人) response,\nwhile the **blue-green clouds** (青云) bore the **auspicious omens** (占) of his devotion to the **Dao/Way** (道).\n\nWhen the summons came in **Lù’s** (路) **scroll of jade** (鹄书),\nhe arrived in **humble attire** (褐衣),\ndiscussing the **boundaries between Heaven and Man** (天人之际)\nand expounding the **origins of virtue/power** (道德之源).\nHe rejected the **confusion of the herdsman’s labyrinth** (牧马之迷),\nyet naturally aligned with the **request of the wind** (顺风之请).\n\nHe then followed **Dūnlǐ** (敦礼),\nand settled in **Jiànkāng** (建康).\nThere was the **Play of the Mysterious and True** (玄真观),\nbuilt by **Emperor Xuānyǐn** (宣帝) of the **Chén** (陈) dynasty\nfor **Master Zhēnshèng** (矜先生).\nIts halls stood solemn and still,\nthe waters and woods pure and refined.\nHe wandered there, found rest there,\nand fulfilled his passion.\n\nEach time he visited the **Bamboo Palace** (竹宫),\nhe sought the **secret words of jade** (玉牒秘词),\nknocking at the silent gates to seek truth,\nand always found his reliance in this **Master** (君).\nThe **auspicious signs of good fortune** (嘉祥灵应)\nwere heard by none but him.\n\nDuring the reign of **Emperor Shènglì** (圣历),\nhis favor and respect were uniquely profound.\nHe was granted a **gold seal and purple ribbon** (金印紫绶),\nand named **Grandmaster Xuánbó** (玄博大师).\nThe **fierce ancestor** (烈祖) once spoke to him leisurely,\nsaying: *\"I do not covet the wealth of the Four Seas,\nbut only worry for the common people.\"*\n\nHe replied: *\"The ancient **Saints** (圣人),\nfirst cultivated their own **virtue/power** (德),\nand then extended their care to the world.\nWhen the world finds one **Virtuous Person** (得一人),\nit is then at peace.\n\nToday, the **Son of Heaven** (今天子) toils over myriad affairs,\nforgetting sleep and food,\nyet cannot even govern his own body—\nhow could he govern the common people?\"*\n\nThe **Emperor** (帝) praised his words,\nand offered him a hundred **jīn** (金) as a gift.\nHis wisdom and discernment were as bright and direct as this.\n\nThe present **Emperor** (今上) inherited the foundation of **tranquility and stillness** (清静之基),\nand honored the **transformation of the Mysterious and Silent** (玄默之化).\nHe consulted and revered his guests,\nand **Master Lù** (路) in his **Tea Mountain** (茅岭) heart\ngrew only more steadfast with age.\n\nIn recent years, he submitted petitions,\nrequesting to return to his ancestral mountain.\nThe **Emperor’s** gracious edict lamented his departure,\nand further bestowed upon him the title **Master Zhēnsù** (贞素先生).\n\nYet when his **jade coffin** (玉棺) was decreed,\nand the **purple and white robes** (紫素) announced their time,\n**Master Géhóng** (葛洪) came to bid farewell,\nbut could not prepare the **Great Elixir** (大药).\n**Young Master Shǎo** (少君) left him,\nhaving first dreamed of a **silk-clad figure** (绣衣).\n\nOn the **fourth month**, **jǐnyǐzǐ** (壬子) year,\n**summer’s** **jǐyīn** (甲寅) day,\nhe ascended to **hidden transformation** (隐化) at the **Play of the Mysterious and True** (玄真观),\nhaving lived to the age of sixty-two.\n\nThe **Emperor’s** decrees lamented his loss,\ngranting him **twenty thousand in funeral funds** (赙钱二十万).\nBoth **Daoists** (道) and **laymen** (俗) mourned his passing,\nwith hundreds gathering for his funeral rites.\n\nInitially, when he came to **Tea Mountain** (茅山),\nhe stood before **Goodly Constant Cavern** (良常洞),\nbeneath **Rǎipíng Hill** (雷平山).\nHe cleared the thickets and wild growth,\nfacing the ravines and standing by the streams,\nclearing the ground to build an altar,\nand marking the **position of the Celestial Worthies** (朝真之位).\nHe shaped the hill into a **tunnel** (隧),\nand divined the **chamber for the spirit’s repose** (安神之室).\n\nNow, in his return to burial,\nhis wishes were fulfilled.\n\nOn the **sixth month**, **wǔshēn** (丙申) day,\nhis remains departed from the capital,\nascending along the **Zī and Huái rivers** (沂淮).\nAt that time, the **central lands** (畿内) suffered from prolonged drought,\nthe riverbeds exposed and dry.\nYet on that very day, **great rains poured down** (大雨洪注),\nwaves surging back toward their source.\nThe **long embankments** (长堤) were submerged,\nthe **heavy dams** (重堰) overflowed,\nand he crossed effortlessly,\nas if borne by the wind—\nno one knew of his labor.\n\nIn ancient times, **Zhōu Jūn** (周君) had the **auspicious water of his reign** (乐水之朝),\nand **Prophet Xiān** (宣尼) the **responses of the Sī River** (泗水之应).\nComparing their **spirits** (灵) to his **virtue/power** (德),\ntheir cases were perhaps similar?\n\n**Master Lù** (路) transmitted the **Daoist precepts** (法度) to many,\nnumbering over a hundred.\n\nAmong them was **Jū Huáidé** (朱怀德), the **Master of the Play of the Mysterious and True** (玄真观主),\nwho was the first to enter his **inner chamber** (室),\nhis **Dao/Way** (道) taught with the utmost severity.\n\n**Chief Disciple Sūn Zhòngzhī** (首座孙仲之),\n**Chapter Master Zhāngbiǎo** (章表),\nand **Great Virtue Master Liú Déguāng** (大德刘德光)\nall received the **scriptures and precepts** (经法),\nand participated in the **hearing of profound secrets** (预闻玄秘).\n\nThey cherished the **Threefold Harmony** (三之义),\nand wished to perpetuate his **unfading influence** (垂不朽之风).\n\n**Master Wēiyí** (威仪) **Wáng Kědé** (王可德)\nand **Chief Disciple Chén Xīshēng** (首座陈希声)\nboth looked up to the **high peaks** (高山),\nand together carved the **chaste stone** (贞石).\n\nThough I am unworthy,\nI have long upheld his teachings.\nThough **Daoists** (仙) and **mortals** (凡) differ in their paths,\nand **stillness** (静) and **agitation** (躁) diverge in their ways,\nyet my sincere devotion to what I have witnessed\nand our **lifelong bond** (素交) remain unchanged.\nI linger at his shrine,\nas vast as the mountains and rivers,\nrespectfully recording my sorrow at the **cliff’s edge** (岘首),\nto await the lament of **Liáochéng** (辽城).\n\nMy words declare:\n*\"In the reign of **Zǐjìn** (铄子),\nI was a guest of

Wénlín** (文林郎) **Xú Kuài** (徐楷),\n**Scholar of Lost Treasures** (守拾遗),\n**Senior Scholar at the Palace of Accomplished Worthies** (充集贤院直学士),\nand **Kèguì** (刻字) **Wáng Wénbǐng** (王文秉),\n**Count of the Right Division of the Royal Guards** (行右千牛卫兵曹参军),\n**Censor-in-Chief** (兼监察御史),\n**King of the Upper Pillar** (上柱国王),\nboth inscribed the **stele of Tea Mountain’s Purple Yang Palace** (茅山紫阳观碑铭并序).\n\n**Xú Kuàng** (徐铉),\n**Counselor of State** (朝议郎),\n**Attendant of the Prince’s Right** (守太子右谕),\n**Master of Rites and Archery** (武骑射),\n**Holder of the Purple Fish Bag** (赐紫金鱼袋),\nand

inscribed and engraved the **stele’s title** (并序并篆额).\n\nI have heard that the **primordial qi** (太初之气)\nhas no beginning in its generation;\nthe **gateway to myriad marvels** (众妙之门)\nhas no name in its origin.»\n\n「Amassed, it forms shape; dispersed, it becomes *qi*.\nThe *Heaven* and *Earth* move it, and thus the *Two Principles* take their positions;\nKings and nobles receive it, and thus the world remains steadfast.\n\nTherefore, though the alchemical labors of severing the tortoise and refining the stone,\nor the pursuits of transcending earth to reach heaven,\nmay follow divergent paths and varied methods—\nwhether as a sovereign adorned in robes and cap of office,\nor a ruler who lays down arms and embraces civility—\nall are in harmony with the divine and unified in the source of *Dao* and *virtue*,\nexpanding the *Way of Non-Action*,\nand embodying the *Formless Form*.\n\nAll things depend on it for life yet do not possess it;\nthe common folk use it daily without knowing its origin.\n\nIn its near effects, it aligns with celestial luminosity,\ntransforming humanity into custom and convention.\nIn its fundamental essence, it gathers perception inward,\nreturns hearing to silence,\npreserves the true self,\nand nourishes the body.\n\nWhen it reaches the *Jade Seal of the Enfeoffed* (玉检登封),\nor the *Luo Tu* of the *Divine Mother* (萝图启后),\nthe adept wanders beyond form,\nescapes the mortal realm,\nforges a golden tripod and ascends upon white clouds,\nenters the *Cold Gate* and stands at the *Mysterious Peak* (玄极),\nwhere the palaces and pure halls,\nand the solemn grounds of contemplation,\nare marked by jade grottoes and golden altars,\ndistinctly opening the way to the *Lower Capital* (下都).\n\nThe *sacred talismans* are synthesized#1,\nthe *golden records* diverge and branch,\ntheir texts of the *Three Elements* and *Eight Trigrams*#2\nconcealed yet echoing like the *Buddha*—\nthe sevenfold *Ying* and ninefold *Hua* chambers#3\nclosely imitate their forms and appearances,\nsufficient to bestow blessings upon all living beings,\nand to fulfill filial devotion in temporal affairs.\n\nThe *Sages* succeeded one another,\nand the *divine structures* endured in continuity.»\n\nThus, the **Ziyang Observatory of Maoshan**—now held in reverence by the present sovereign—was solemnly rebuilt by the illustrious **Emperor Jingzong of High Filial Virtue** and the **Empress Yuanjing**, in honor of their sacred legacy.\n\nThen, the **celestial records** stored their essence below, manifesting as the **Lofty Peak**; the **River Diagram** inscribed its decrees, displaying the auspicious omens of fate. Since the **Dao-qi** harmonized and illuminated, the sacred teachings spread and flourished, their governance and transformations expanding across the **Red Land**, their talismans and diagrams extending over the famed mountains.\n\nFor **Huayang’s Celestial Cavern** was indeed the gathering place of the **Grass Immortals**; **Jinling’s Land-Lung** was the blessed homeland of the **Three Tea Immortals**. To the left, leaning on **Liuwo’s lushness**, the misty clouds entwined in radiant splendor; to the right, bordered by **Yanggu’s valley**, the river’s currents concealed their scales. The **Crouching Dragon** stretched in winding grandeur, steadied by the **Thunder-Peace Ridge**; the **Dark Hills** coiled in embrace, steeped in the **Protecting-Army Pool**.\n\nThe **Pool of Master Guo’s** knocks at the boat—its banks never linger; the **Well of Prefect Xu’s** alchemical furnace draws from ever-cold springs, where white mists and purple vapors rise, reflecting above as **celestial chariots** and **crane-drawn carriages** traverse within. Seven **High Immortals** once dwelled in these four quarters.\n\nLater, the **Virtuous-White Immortal** responded to the age with **mysterious virtue**, founding the **Zhuyang Hall**; with **jade scriptures** expounding the arcane, he established the **Zhaozhen Platform**. The **Hall of Tranquility** built its foundations, its traces likened to **Xuanzhou’s**; the **disciples’ studies** flourished, preserving the **White Tortoise’s** proximity.\n\nThe **golden locks of the phoenix** passed in succession; the **dragon-carriages and tiger-drawn teams** marked the ages of ascension. Then, **Master Xuanjing**, with **unfathomable qi** harmonized, embodied the **Gengsang years**; **Emperor Xuan宗**, honoring teachers and the Dao, bent to the **obedient winds of the rear carriage**, thus earning celestial favor and imperial resonance. The old and new halls were renewed, their names freshly inscribed; the **alchemical tripods and cavernous scriptures** were meticulously restored, without ceasing.\n\n「The **Lingzhi in Dragon’s Clay** was reverently presented in succession—commoners and nobles alike, how could they do less than honor the **Count of Bright Clarity**, the **forbidden groves of Firewood and Mulberry**, or the **Tomb of the Willow’s Shadow**? Thus, auspicious clouds and sacred mists announced omens, while **Lingzhi** and **Yingzhi** blossoms displayed celestial favor. Yet, the **King of the Xiao Zhou**’s jade waters were sung in vain, and the **Han Emperor’s** rare orchids remained but a show of empty splendor.\n\nSince then, each age has seen its reverence renewed: eminent scholars and sages, ever casting off their old selves. **Cloud Pavilions and Feathered Canopies** often descended with divine grace, their deeds inscribed on **gold and stone**, their legends passed through song and verse.\n\nAlas! The four ages have cycled, as **Heaven’s Dao** fills and empties. Though the **Nine Breaths of Qi** endure eterniously, spanning **kalpas** to nourish their harmony, the **Three Stages of Manifestation** follow time’s shifts, revealing their brilliance or obscurity—this pattern will rise and fall with the **worldly fortunes**, ascending or descending alongside the **imperial destiny**.\n\nWhen **Red Clarity** had yet to dawn, there lingered still the sorrow of **idle halls**; but now **White Water** flourishes, granting the blessings of **highborn prosperity**. The **Emperor Gaozong**, like a **dragon bearing virtue**, planted his **meritorious shade**—he responded to the **unusual omens of the pivoting realm**, mirroring **Zhongtian’s** wondrous signs.\n\nAt **Ganpan**, he cultivated harmony in the **first year of the sixty-second cycle**; the **cook-officials** were appointed, and their merit shone in the **third month of the ninth year**; the **guest-halls** received counselors, and great transformations arose in his time. His **crimson arrows and Lu bows** were justly revered by all under **Heaven**.\n\nThus, he followed the **Way of Yao’s Mandate**, revived the **Xia’s Middle Prosperity**, and mended the **unfulfilled regions of the West and North**, aligning with the **southern kingly Qi**. He presided over the **Bright Hall**, greeting the **Grass Sovereign**, and gathered the **auspicious jade**, meeting with the **feudal lords**.\n\nHaving achieved stability and success, he grew ever more profound in his concerns. He rode in **chariots of the swift and the decayed**, not deeming the **yellow-roofed halls** as supreme; he ate lightly and wore coarse garments, his thoughts ever for the **people’s welfare**. He knew the **effortless perfection** of the **Dao** without failure, embodying the **highest virtue’s** non-virtue—his spirit focused on **Gushu Island**, upright and serene, his governance flowing naturally, his actions responding as needed. He cherished the people and upheld the law, revering roots and instructing farmers.\n\nHe laid aside arms and disbanded soldiers, heeding the warning that **good defense must guard against the dangers of war**; he kept his palace humble and his meals simple, fearing reproach for indulging in **popular desires**. Thus, he earned the **effects of myriad treasures**, the **three celestial luminaries** offering blessings—his influence reached far, his peace near. His achievements surpassed those of **King Shao Kang’s** radiant might, and his **true vision** outshone **Emperor Kaizong’s** founding deeds.\n\nNow the **current sovereign**, inheriting the **accumulated virtue** of his ancestors, follows the **natural Way**—to embody **effortless transformation** is **sainthood**, to wield **might without slaughter** is **benevolence**. He delves into **profound and subtle teachings**, upholding **modest brilliance** while embracing **unfathomable application**; he reveals the **hidden and obscure**, embodying **great capacity** to encompass the **boundless**.\n\nWhen he acts, he shields the people; he does not boast of deeds but values **wisdom**; in stillness, he refines governance, ever practicing **frugality** to encourage **sharing**. He hears of good as if struck by fear, always scrutinizing the **finest details of autumn hairs**; his **radiant bearing** shines forth, yet he never deviates from the **tiniest of righteous paths**. His **transformations permeate**, as **winds follow**, and his **harmony spreads**, enriching the **customs of the age**.」\n\nThe realm is the **mightiest ancestor’s** domain, its **constitutional model** the **ascendant’s** edicts.\nEnduring blessings stretch without end, boundless reverence forever held—\n**Ancestral halls** and **clan temples** cannot fully express devotion,\n**Sacrificial music** and **ritual song** fall short of true homage.\n\nIn **heavenly splendor**, we trace the **Celestial Chariot’s** path,\nAnd in **severe inquiry**, we seek the **Palace of the Dao**.\nThere we meet the **Immortal of Chang’an’s** lofty grace,\nWhere **Dragon’s Well** stirs sacred inspiration—\nWe chant the **people’s hymns of birth**,\nAnd ponder the **great work of pacifying chaos**,\nThen turn to **Spirit Rock’s** sacred heights,\nAnd issue **radiant decrees** to proclaim:\n*\"Summon the **Pei-Heng officials**,\nGather the **craftsmen of Ban’er**,\nLet **artisans race with swift steeds**,\nAnd **refined materials** reach their peak.\"*\n\nFrom **Su-yuan’s granaries**, let **Gong-duan’s** tribute be supplied,\nAnd from **Northern Yu’s** earth, **Qiu-man’s** labor be drawn.\n\nThen the **Secret Hall** was renewed—\nIts grandeur vast, its **misty vapors** dark,\nIts **domed ceilings** towering, its **mutual beams** interlaced with **crystal brilliance**,\nWhile **pearl nets** weave in **dim recesses**,\n**Thunderous echoes** drip like rain,\nAnd **rainbow hues** glide along the **eaves’ curves**.\nSudden shadows yield to light,\nAnd fleeting **crimson clouds** swirl with **billowing mists**.\n\nMajestic as the **Celestial Sovereign’s** presence,\nSerene as the **Supreme Uncarved’s** bearing—\nIt seems the **Dao-qi ascends** in boundless flight,\nAnd **lofty clouds** dissolve into distant gaze.\n\nThen the **High Gate** was erected—\nIts **gatehouse grand**, its **golden thresholds** gleaming,\n**Dragon motifs** and **wind-inscribed seals** inscribed upon its beams,\n**Rainbow banners** and **crimson flags** marking its comings and goings.\n\nTwo **processional halls** were built, their **layers deep and winding**,\nAnd **tiered pavilions** rose, their **heights vast and open**—\nStretching north to **Guo-Gan’s** paths,\nAnd south to **Jiang-Ba’s** thoroughfares.\n**Resplendent light** illuminates the **earth’s expanse**,\nAnd **vibrant hues** adorn the **wilds**.\n\nSwift as **divine motion**, wondrous as **transformative craft**—\nWhen the sun nears the **stars’ return** and the year draws near its close,\nWhen **paeony blossoms** drift upon the **pond’s surface**,\nAnd **spring’s warmth** begins to rise,\nWhen **Red City’s** cranes take flight at dawn,\nAnd **White Geese** gather for morning court—\nThe **capital’s folk**, men and women alike,\nRaise their sleeves as **curtains of mist**,\nAnd share in the **sacred wind’s** harmony,\nGazing upward at the **cloud-built halls**,\nOnly then do they grasp the **Sovereign’s might**.\n\nHow could it be merely a **century’s awe**?\nOnly **Yellow Emperor’s** terrace compares—\n**Three lifespans** as companions,\nEnduring **Jiang-Suo’s** temple’s silence,\nOh, **grandeur supreme**—words fail to name it!\n\n**Mystery’s root** is **utter void**, yet **renown endures immortal**—\nIt **transcends divine insight**, revealing **hidden, luminous truths**,\nAnd **establishes the Dao’s worth**, restoring **primordial simplicity**.\nIts blessings bring **wealth and longevity** to the people,\nIts **music** becomes **harmonious verse**,\nIts **records** enter the **histories’ annals**,\nIts **inscriptions** grace **monumental stones**—\nIts **radiant virtue** shines eternal, here and now.\n\nThus the **lowly subject** was commanded:\n*\"With reverence, record the **august virtue**.\"*\n\nThe words proclaim:\n*\"Lofty is the **Dao’s path**, vast the **mystic gate**—\nEmpty yet ever-present, like threads without end.\nFrom it arise **clarity and turbidity**,\nAnd **heaven and earth** take form.\nIt gives birth to the **people**, and **kings arise**.\n**Virtue’s splendor** shines as **imperial**,\n**Achievements** soar to **divine** heights.\nAt **Kongtong’s peaks**, the **Dao** is sought,\nAnd from **Red Waters**, the **pearls** are drawn.\nSome say it **exists**, others call it **ultimate truth**.\nThe **Three Calendars** cycle anew,\nAnd **grand designs** begin anew.\nAh, the **foundation’s mandate**—\n**Resplendent is the **Tang’s** glory!\n**Rebirth’s work** is launched, **heaven’s blessings** descend in abundance.\n**Mysterious virtue** ascends to **heaven’s ear**,\nAnd **longevity’s** **radiance** shines eternal.\nRiding **white clouds**, he reaches the **imperial realm**,\nWhere **serene successors** reign,\nAnd **mighty warriors** stand below.\n**Rites match heaven’s grandeur**,\n**Teachings honor the ancestors**.\n**Clarified wisdom** reveals all thoughts,\n**Bright as day**, as if seen.\nWith **reverence**, we await the **Immortal’s** return,\nAnd **solemnly** prepare the **court’s halls**.\n\nWhere lie these **halls**? On **Jiu-Jin’s** ridge—\n**Crimson clouds** glow at dusk,\n**White mists** gather at dawn.\n**Four-tiered roofs** rise in splendor,\n**Nine-layered towers** pierce the sky.\n**Clouds** swirl in **hidden valleys**,\n**Sunlight** gleams on **jagged peaks**.\n**Three peaks** shade the **paths**,\n**Five ridges** divide the **trails**.\n**Cinnabar sands** flow like liquid,\n**Dark isles** stand firm.\n**Willow groves** weave their bonds,\nAnd **Thunder Pools** spill their mirrors.\nLike **Nine Hua’s** phantom peaks,\nOr **Seven Echoes’** faint traces—\n**Sincerity moves mountains**,\nAnd **responses come swift**.\n**True men** ascend in **pure grace**,\n**Leisurely and refined**,\nTheir **wheels** turn in fleeting haste,\nTheir **morning canopies** drift in **wandering flight**.\n**Common folk** gaze upward in awe,\nWhile **scholars** ponder the **lofty halls**.\n\nIn days of old, **sages spoke**,\nAnd **laid down their teachings**—\n**Compassion saved all things**,\n**Filial piety** honored the **ancestors**.\nWith **reverence**, they followed the **True Contract**,\nAnd **heard the Great Dao’s** voice.\nThey **manifested mystery** in **words and symbols**,\nAnd **stirred the pure wind** among the **ten thousand households**.\nThey **offered unadulterated silk** to the **boundless**,\nAnd **looked upward** to the **Sovereign’s** **grand designs**.\n\n**Established in the twelfth month, the year Jiwei (60th year of the cycle).**\n\n**Reinstating the Mountain’s Taboo**\n**Xu Xian’s** inscription:\n\n**Hua-Yang’s** **Cavernous Dao-Heaven**, **Jinling’s** **auspicious earth**—\nWhere **drought-alleviating immortals** gather,\nAnd **auspicious blessings** take root—\nThus its **altars and halls** surpass all,\nIts **offerings** are most **sacred and frequent**,\nAnd its **forbidden groves** shield the **mountain’s purity**—\nAll this has stood since ancient times.\n\nIn the **Sacred History’s** decline,\n**Officials neglected their duties**,\nAnd the **places of worship** fell into **wild disarray**.\nWhen **true spirits** hover and **divine feasts** are held,\n**Restoration** must come through **uncommon men**.\n\nIn the **year Ding-Chou**, **Master Zheng-Su Wang Xi** of **Qing-Xia**\nFirst came to this mountain,\n**Reverently** upholding the **ancestral laws**,\n**Pacing the sacred grounds**,\n**Resting at Zhu-Yang’s** slopes,\n**Ever mindful** of the **old ways**,\n**Determined** to restore them.\n\nThe **Master’s** **hidden virtue** shone within,\nAnd his **auspicious signs** harmonized without—\n**Scholars and sages** aligned with him,\nTheir **Dao-resonance** in **silent accord**.\nAll **white silk offerings** and **sincere tributes**\nWere dedicated to the **mountain’s gate**,\nTo fulfill his **long-held vow**.\n\nThus, from **Liang-Chang’s** **Cave** to **Lei-Ping’s** **Mountain**—\nTen *li* distant—\nAll **common folk** enslaved there were **redeemed**.\n**Firewood and grass** could not be **plucked at will**,\nAnd **graves and villages** were **separated**.\n**Artisans’ trees** shaded the **wilds**,\n**Pine groves** marked the **entrances**,\n**Rivers and bridges** were **cleared**,\nAnd **briers and weeds** were **pruned away**.\n\nA **square altar** was built atop **Lei-Ping’s** peak,\nAnd a **high pavilion** constructed before **Liang-Chang’s** **Cave**—\nFor **morning rites** of **sincere devotion**,\nAnd **leisurely stays** where **chariots** are **taxed**.\n\n**Jiang-Ba’s** **ancient paths** and **Qin-Wang’s** **old seals**\nNow stand **solemn and bright**,\nRestored to the **glory of Kaiyuan and Tianbao’s** days.\n\nThe **Wuzhuang Temple** stood to the right of **Zisun**,\nIts ancient foundations lost beneath thick grass.\nThe Master, though impoverished, gathered his resources,\nAnd built halls and chambers—\nWherever there was need, he reached first,\nNo distance too great to span.\n\nThe **Duke of Wuling**, **Kang Wang**, offered a million coins,\nAnd **Liang Wang** constructed a pavilion block.\nAll who followed the **Dao** contributed their efforts,\nAnd before a year had passed,\nBoth the old and new halls—\nAll were the Master’s work.\n\nIn days of old, **Da Xian** summoned the **Shuangcheng** carriage,\nAnd **Gengsang** transformed the **Weichang** folk—\nThis was because the **Dao** resides in the mind,\nIts response swift as an echo.\n\nThen there was **Daoshi Jing Xu**, who aligned his plans with the Master’s intent,\nAssisting and supporting him in all matters,\nDiligent in his duties, sincere in his responses,\nHis contributions never lacking—\nThis was truly his greatest merit.\n\nIn the summer of the **Baodà** era’s **Renzi year** (fourth month),\nThe Master recorded the number of halls and chambers,\nThe boundaries and paths they traversed,\nAnd petitioned the capital,\nIssuing decrees to the prefectures and counties,\nEntrusting the task to **Deng Qiyong**, the **Du Inspector of Maoshan**.\n\nWhen all was complete,\nHe ascended in just a few days.\nHis **mandate** fulfilled, his **response** divine—\nThe unenlightened knew not of it.\n\nThe path to transcendence is not a single call but many—\nOne who is spiritually refined, his *qi* luminous,\nHis bones and markings divine—\nThis is bestowed by Heaven.\n\nOne whose heart is empty, his nature pure,\nHis virtue profound and vast—\nThis is rooted in his essence.\n\nOne who reveals truth and imparts teachings,\nIlluminating the near and distant—\nThis is achieved through diligence.\n\nThus, though his name be inscribed in purple and white,\nAnd his steps ascend the Yellow Court,\nHis deeds flow on, his blessings stored—\nThese must harmonize in unity.\n\nThen, the Master’s Dao—\nWas it not thus?\n\nThough his carriage departed without pause,\nAnd his ascent vanished with the sun,\nYet his lofty virtue may be recounted,\nHis enduring model remains among men.\nTo record it is the duty of the brush.\n\nDeng Jun, in reverence, now commits this to script.\nIn the eighth month of autumn, the year *Jìwèi*,\nRecorded by Xu Xian, the *Shangqing* True Person,\nChancellor and Calligrapher of Danjing.\n\nThe Chancellor, steeped in Dao,\nDwelling in spirit, ascending to the Nine Heavens—\nThough men may change, the Dan Well endures.\nHere, the valley’s prince is shot,\nCold springs gush forth.\nDividing the sweet nectar,\nThey nourish the fields of immortality.\n\nFrom the west I came,\nSeeking the True of Purple Yang,\nAs if loving the #13 Charm Tree,\nAscending to the Lu Hall.\nWith reverence, I carve the Green Talks,\nForever to remember the Silver Bed.\nAlas, for later scholars,\nTo hold this lingering light.\n\n**Record of the Lingbao Academy**\nComposed by Wang Qixia, the Purple-Garbed Daoist,\nAnd rebuilt by Xu Gong, the Celestial Master,\nVice Commander of the Daoist Army,\nGovernor of the Zhenhai Military Circuit,\nHolding the rank of Inspector-General,\nGuardian of the Secretariat,\nLord of Donghai.\n\nNow, the Lingbao—\nA secret name from the Empty Cavern’s Red Scriptures.\nIt expounds the natural order,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nIts virtue is effortless, yet it nurtures all deeds.\nThus, the Most High establishes virtue,\nThe next establishes deeds.\n\nVirtue is the great origin of Heaven and Earth,\nDeeds bring benefit to the three realms.\nIf virtue nourishes the self,\nAnd deeds aid others,\nThen even slight actions,\nLike returning home,\nTransform the clamor of the world into quiet retreat.\n\nMoreover, the records and traces that remain—\nThere are extraordinary men,\nWho achieve extraordinary deeds,\nThus spanning ancient and modern times,\nTheir noble intentions unbroken.\n\nTeachings bound like brocade,\nWith upright Dao in service,\nKind and gentle in conduct.\nUnderstanding the world is wisdom,\nFinding joy in stillness is benevolence.\nHe once dwelled in Chang’an’s clouds,\nInitially relying on Heng Mountain,\nThen taking refuge here,\nCalmly suppressing agitation,\nDevoted to the Mysterious and Silent,\nSimple as uncarved wood—\nHis virtue moved Heaven itself.\n\nSuddenly, clad in embroidered robes,\nHe received the Nine Tributes,\nGuided by the Three Pure Ones’ path,\nThe phoenix descended in response,\nHis blessings unerring—\nThis was the accumulation of past merit.\n\nNow, those of later ages who follow the same path,\nSurely, it is our Lord.\n\nOur Lord, with his footsteps in virtue,\nSwimming in loyalty and sincerity,\nHis lofty virtue far-reaching,\nHis purity like jade’s chill—\nHis fame resounds like the *Ling* and *Shi*,\nHis halls echoing ancient traces,\nHis authority like the Dragon’s Pool,\nHis honors as vast as the Red Gates.\nHe righted the ruler with one counsel,\nBestowed upon us his path,\nHis judgments stern as iron,\nHis wealth as rich as cinnabar.\nHis wisdom arose before its time,\nHis Dao attained in a single moment—\nWith a bamboo whip, he transformed all,\nAnd with the *Sangfu* hymns, his governance spread far.\n\nHe said:\n*\"I have no desires, yet the people are simple,\nI act without doing, yet the people are transformed.\nFollowing Huang-Lao’s teachings, the Emperor’s reign flourished,\nExamining the origins, the Sacred Instruction was expanded.\nThus, he turned to the named capital,\nAnd planted blessings for the world.\"*\n\nThe Lingbao Academy was established by Tao Hongjing,\nMaster of *Zhenbai*, in the *Tianjian* era of the Liang.\nOriginally, it was called *Zhaozhen*.\n\nThe Purple Yang Observatory,\nOnce the Chancellor’s residence,\nLies between the Small Mao Ridge and Leiping Mountain,\nFacing South Zhong Mountain’s *Zhaochang*,\nAnd extending north to Liangchang.\n\nThe remaining peaks and valleys,\nLike stars encircling the pole,\nCannot be fully described.\n\nBefore this, the towering halls,\nLayered like the Milky Way,\nHoused the Three Caverns’ arcane texts,\nGathering the feathered guests of Danqiu.\nThe disciples—Zhou Xianjun and Zichang—\nDiligently cultivated here,\nCherishing the Dao’s winds,\nRefining their bodies with gold and stone,\nAscending on clouds.\n\nYet time passed, and the halls decayed,\nTheir wooden frames crumbling to dust.\n\nIn the *Taihe* era of the Tang,\nLi Gong, Marquis of Zanhuang and Grandee,\nOften visited, rebuilding the distant greenery.\nThe Daoist Master Sun Zhicheng,\nHis disciple, investigated the old site,\nAnd rebuilt the academy,\nRenaming it *Lingbao* as before.\n\nLater, war’s flames consumed its blessings,\nReducing it to ashes.\nThorns and brambles grew thick,\nLong grass and weeds overran it,\nFoxes and rabbits dwelled there,\nReeds and sedges choked the paths—\nUntrimmed for fifty years.\n\nQixia, though burdened by past merits,\nFrom youth onward, never ceased his devotion.\nThough he gained fame early,\nHe endured repeated wars,\nHis traces scattered,\nHis structures nearly lost—\nThe broken branches vanished into the void,\nFrom north to south.\nFortunate to rely on Dao’s transformation,\nHe revered this sacred ground.\n\nThus, he aligned his path,\nAnd with zeal, he labored—\nForgetting weariness,\nBuilding altars, planting pines,\nWeaving thatch for shelter,\nBinding orchids to wood,\nWishing only to retreat forever.\n\nSoon, he received the decree from the Prince of Qi,\n[Command to reside in] the Imperial Academy,\nServing in the court,\nBathing in imperial favor,\nElevated in rank,\nHis Dao refined,\nWearing the ceremonial robes,\nTwice entrusted with keys—\nBoth honored and refined.\n\nWhen our Lord took governorship here,\nThough afflicted by illness,\nHe humbly resigned.\nLord Guyin then donated a million in salary,\nTo rebuild on the old foundation,\nCreating new blessings.\n\nAt the time of receiving the command,\nHe strove day and night without rest,\nEver diligent, hoping to fulfill his duty.\nAlas, planning is difficult,\nWisdom lacks foresight—\nThough a tiger’s gaze is not for a single sparrow,\nYet the sparrow still chirps.\nThough the moon’s fullness is not for a single cloud,\nYet the cloud may obscure it.\n\nAh, the times!\nLogic does not always prevail—\nUnless the Platform illuminates the hidden,\nNearly all would be lost.\n\nThe county’s governance was measured and meticulous,\nMonths and days marked its progress,\nWisely soliciting judgments,\nMatching talents to tasks—\nMud walls and thatch roofs were reinforced,\nPlans for sprawl were firmly set,\nLeveling earth and stones to equal heights,\nDispelling wolves and cutting wild grass.\nTen thousand laborers toiled endlessly,\nYears passed without respite,\nTheir craft refined to perfection,\nTheir pigments and glazes exquisitely blended.\nThree halls were constructed for the main palace,\nWith the Celestial Venerable of Precious Treasure enshrined within,\nAnd the Sacred Followers arrayed.\nThree-tiered altars were built,\nThree gates and three halls,\nSixteen surrounding corridors,\nAll decaying structures repaired and restored.\nThe Hall of Descending Truth was extended inward,\nThe pond’s foundation was renewed,\nAnd the walls rebuilt.\n\nAt the northern corner,\nBound by the loyal and righteous Duke of Loyalty and Righteousness’ younger brother,\nA hall of auspicious visions was erected on the old platform’s foundation,\nThree halls housing the Three Manifestations of the Venerable Lord of Yangjiao Mountain.\nTo the southwest,\nThe Hall of the Three Officials Facing the Sun was built—\nTwo halls, their statues towering and majestic,\nTheir golden and azure adornments resplendent,\nTheir reflections dazzling.\nTiled roofs stacked like mandarin ducks in flight,\nRidge beams curling like phoenixes’ tails.\nThough the rituals were fragmented as if calcified,\nThe guards who gazed upon them were struck with awe.\nBanners fluttered like clouds,\nWhile cranes and tortoises glided as if plowing fields.\nOpposite stood towering figures,\nAs if miraculously risen—\nDoubtful wonders, as if flown from afar.\nHad it not been for our Lord’s unwavering resolve,\nHad the teachings not been moved by devotion,\nHow could this desolate land witness such splendor?\nEnough to spread eternal virtue,\nTo perpetuate divine influence,\nTo align with Heaven and Earth in longevity,\nTo gather the blessings of mountains and rivers—\nGrand and mighty, enduring and vast.\n\nTomorrow’s Clouds’ wisdom was beyond compare,\nHis talents unmatched in composition.\nYet he received his Dao at its beginning,\nAnd his mandate here.\nWith utmost sincerity and diligence,\nThis work was completed.\nNow recorded in plain prose,\nPresented to the Platform for inspection,\nTo be inscribed for future generations.\n\nIn the year *Dàhé Sānnián* of Rebuilt Unity,\nThe ninth month, on the *yǐyǒu* day of the first,\nThe ninth day, *gǔsǐ*,\nThis was respectfully recorded.\n\nSilver Green Light Honorable Grandee,\nActing Left Scattered Cavalry Attendant,\nSentenced to govern Rùchéng County and oversee the affairs,\nHuáng Huánqián,\nIn fulfillment of the Platform’s decree of virtuous

wholeheartedly.\nMaster Pán Zūnshī’s epitaph was composed by\nRight Assistant Historian Chén Zǐ’áng.\n\nMaster Pán’s teachings were profound and esoteric,\nHis devotion to the *sè* serene and deep,\nHis heart aligned with Heaven, his treasures few.\nAbandoning the Sage’s ways, discarding wisdom,\nHe did not flaunt his light,\nThus the True was moved by hidden destiny,\nHis sacred diagrams and secret arts\nBeyond mortal comprehension.\n\nYet his lofty aspirations stretched to distant horizons,\nHis distant thoughts soaring—\nHis will reaching for the Azure Clouds,\nHis gaze fixed upon the Purple Gates.\nThe High Ancestor often descended in person,\nVisiting his humble abode,\nYet Master Pán never left his hall,\nOnly extending his hands in greeting.\nHe sighed, saying:\n*“A true man’s pursuit of the Dao\nShould cast his body into the heavens,\nErase his shadow in the forests,\nYet here I weary myself in these mountains,\nBothering the sovereign—\nThis is my fault!”*\nHe then wished to seek Penglai,\nSailing the fox-boat into the sea.\nBut the Heavenly Sovereign’s reverence for this Dao was profound,\nHis entreaties ever deeper,\nAnd so he lingered at the mountain’s edge,\nHis journey never undertaken.\n\nThen the celestial decree arrived,\nAnd his reins were bound to this realm.\nAlas! In ancient times,\nThe Immortal of Gūshè existed—\nEmperor Yáo valued the world so lightly;\n\n---\n\nAt **Kōngtóng**, the Dao reached its zenith—\nIts lofty path bent with the wind’s grace,\nIts mysterious traces soaring high,\nIts virtue enduring through ten thousand ages—\nHow magnificent it was!\n\nThe Master had ten disciples,\nAll gems of the Immortal ranks,\nYet those with the bearing of cranes and phoenixes,\nWhose love for clouds and pines was profound—\nOnly **Yǐngchuān’s Hàn Fǎzhāo** and **Héinà’s Sīmǎ Zīwéi**\nHad received their mandates from the Jade Court,\nSecretly instructed in the Pearl Chambers,\nDevoted solely to the **Tàiqīng** arts,\nLeaving behind the company of mortal men.\nThey drew water from the valleys, tilled the fields for elixirs,\nServing me with diligence—\nFor years upon years.\n\nAt first, the Master was recorded at **Máoshān**,\nAscending as **Xuánwáng Jūn**.\n**Xuánwáng Jūn** received the Dao from **Huàyáng’s** recluse, **Táo Gōng**,\nAnd **Táo Gōng** traced his lineage back to **Zīwéi**—\nTwo hundred years had passed,\nYet the Master’s lofty frame and immortal bones\nResembled **Huàyáng** in every way.\n\nThose who tread the True Path, refining essence and transcending form,\nTheir hearts must share a kindred essence.\n\n**Fǎzhāo** and the others forever cherished the Master’s profound and recondite teachings—\nHis virtue soaring beyond the ancients—\nYet he abandoned the world and departed.\nWhat could we do but—\n\nCarve this inscription upon the silent stone of the deep mountain,\nTo proclaim his transcendent virtue.\n\n**Ode:**\n\nBehold the primal transformation,\nSeeking the ancient ranks of the Immortals,\nObtaining the Jade Diagram and Golden Cauldron—\nTruly the natural fulfillment of the primal signs,\nAs the spirit merges with the Dao.\n\nHeaven and man are bound as one—\nIf one guards the essence with unwavering devotion,\nOne shall ride the clouds and ascend the celestial marriage.\n\nAt **Dānqiū**, the **Ménzi** never dies,\nWithin the **Huánggōng**, the world is transcended—\nMy body now embraces the **Xuán**.\n\nRestoring the **Xuán’s** most noble virtue,\nTruly refined and beautiful.\nNurturing harmony within the heart,\nPreserving the primal origin—\nFirst learning at **Máoshān** to cross the **Jiāng**,\nThen entering **Huàyáng’s** **Dòngtiān** enclosure.\nThere met the True Person, **Xuánzǐ**,\nWho gave the **Bǎoshū** of **Qīngtái’s** decree,\nCommanding him to guard **Sōngyáng’s** **Yùnǚ Fēng**,\nWhere now, for five cycles, he dwells in secluded forests.\n\nThe Sage is burdened by ten thousand affairs,\nYet I consider the world a hindrance;\nThe Sage treasures the Great Treasure,\nYet I find the world a distraction—\nThus I dwell in obscurity at **Fèifán**,\nLeaving my legacy to **Xuānyuán**.\n\nOh, **Emperor Gāozōng of Táng**—\nThe radiant Son of Heaven,\nLoving the Dao, delighting in the Immortals,\nYearning for the celestial abodes.\nWith ten thousand banners and a thousand steeds,\nA train of **Cǐfènghuáng**,\nRoving the **Rǔ Sea**, basking in **Jīshān’s** glow.\nMorning visits to the **Báimáo**, evening at the **Zǐfáng**,\nPurifying the heart, refining the will—\nEver in reverent anticipation.\nHe inquired of **Yùzhēn** and the **Yùhuáng**,\nHow to attain the Heaven’s favor.\nWithin the **Huángtíng**, the True Person resides—\nMysterious, profound, his essence most pure,\nBanishing arrogance and lasciviousness,\nDiligently cultivating the Dao, drawing ever closer.\n\nThus he cast off his form and left the world,\nRiding the white clouds to the celestial guests.\nHis disciples knew not his destination,\nAnd so carved this stone in longing for the True.\n\n**Inscription for the Eastern Purple Yang Master

immortality,\nAnd swallowed the **soul of the sun**, practicing in secrecy.\n*[Fragment: six characters missing]*\nHis dwelling was the **Kǔzhú** Grove,\nWhere he built the **Fēixiá** pavilion,\nPlanted twin **guì** trees beneath it,\nAnd rested there, listening to the distant echoes of **Jīnlíng**’s ruins.\nThe **Dao** flourished in the **Sānmiáo** grove,\nAnd rippled through the

found him reclining in meditation,\n*[Fragment: five characters missing]*\nHidden like a crow in flight, approaching without warning,\nHeld in high esteem by the age,\nMany such tales existed.\n\nAt the start of the **Tiān Bǎo** era,\nHe was summoned by **Dānyáng** to the **Liúfèng** halls,\nWith lavish gifts to bend **Qū**’s will,\nAnd to record the transmission at **Sōngshān**’s **Shùjīng**—\nThe **Great Tang** *[Fragment: two characters missing]* Palace.\nThree entreaties were made, yet he firmly declined,\nRefusing to leave his retreat.\nBut soon the imperial edict arrived, commanding his presence—\nReluctantly, he obeyed.\n\nUpon entering the palace, he altered the **ritual norms**,\nGreatly transforming the capital’s customs.\nYet like the **Hǎiwū** feasting on **Zāng Wén**,\nOr the **Yuánzhū** tearing at **Zhōugōng**’s robes,\nHis heart yearned for departure while his body lingered—\nHe feigned illness to bid the Emperor farewell,\nAnd fixed a date to leave the court.\n\nAs he prepared to depart, he composed his own elegy:\n*\"The gods now summon me, yet I am no worldly burden.\"*\n\nHe entrusted his disciple **Hú Qìwù**,\nWho carried him on a **píngjiān** palanquin,\nReturning his remains to the ancestral soil.\nNobles and ministers saw him off to **Lóngmén**,\nAnd into **Yèxiàn**’s precinct #16.\n\nAt **Wáng Qiáo**’s temple,\nHis gaze seemed to

did not concern himself with trifling matters;\nHis writings were never fully exquisite,\nYet his teachings carried the force of **crashing clouds**,\nHis compositions were not the work of long

and Stone: Song Stele #1 *Imperial Composition of the Ode to the Dragon with Preface***\n\nThe *Mao Mountain Records* [茅山志] states:\n*\"The Thunderous Pool of the Fire Hall, the Imperial Pool of the Fire Hall—\nwithin them dwells a small black dragon, now rarely seen.\nThere is also the Pool of Master Guo [郭真人池], where such dragons are always present.\nThese spirit-beings shift and transform, their abodes not fixed—\nmen sometimes capture them and bring them down from the mountain,\nyet even when sealed in vessels, they vanish without trace.\"*\n\nRecently, the court dispatched the imperial envoy **Ren Wencai** [任文庆] to perform **rites of exorcism and prayer** [醮祭] at the sacred peaks,\nseeking blessings for the people.\n\n**Ren Wencai** [文庆] procured one dragon and presented it,\nthen carried two dragons with him as he journeyed.\nMidway, winds and rains arose—\nindeed, one dragon was lost.\n\nHolding the remaining dragon at the imperial gate,\nhe closely examined its form—\ntruly remarkable, so I composed this ode to record it.\n\n**The Ode:**\n\n*The foremost of the Four Spirits is this dragon,\nwhose transformations are fixed and hard to match.\nThe Three Teaches’ blessed land, the abode of the Dry Immortals [旱仙宅],\nwhere spirit-forms gather in this sacred pool.\n\nThe immortals of the pool tamed it with their Dao,\nyet to this day, its hidden and revealed nature remains unmeasured.\n\nRiding the clouds, it moves alone with wondrous grace,\nbringing rain and nurturing life, all through its virtue/power.\nCommon folk seize it, yet it flees their grasp—\nonce out of the mountain, where can it be found?\n\nThe imperial envoy sought it with earnest intent,\nwishing to present it to the court and proclaim its auspicious signs.\n\nAt first, he carried one dragon to the **Wei Gate** [魏阙],\nthen, by chance, held two as he left their cavernous home.\nHuman hearts and dragon hearts, if in harmony, are like matching seals—\none departs, one remains—what spirit is more strange?\n\nI beheld the true dragon and was not alarmed,\nfor sincere devotion pleases the dragon’s ears.\nI only hope winds and rains will follow year after year,\nso that granaries may overflow in every place.\n\nIn the third year of **Great Harmony and Auspicious Symbols** [大中祥符], sixth month.\n\nThe **Empress Dowager of the Song Dynasty, Heavenly Saintly and Pure**, received the *Upper Clarity Record of the Great Cavern Dao Master*, inscribed by the Purple-Granted Subject Zhu Ziying and calligraphed by the Palace Academy Attendant Meng Yingzhi under imperial decree.\n\nIn the fourth generation of the Song Dynasty’s auspicious mandate, during the third year of the Sage’s benevolent reign, the Holy Mother Empress Dowager Liu—refined essence of the Nine Spirits, nurtured by the Three Primordials—ushered in an era of radiant prosperity. With the talisman of sagely virtue in hand, she harmonized the inner realm, reverently ordering the nine clans, and extended her enlightened governance outward, refining the affairs of the people.\n\nIn moments of respite from statecraft, her mind dwelled in the void’s boundless expanse, her spirit soaring in the boundless realm. At the jade-paved hall, she brushed away the golden incense’s smoke; in the chamber of pure whiteness, she scattered fragrant blossoms. She further purified her mind and stilled her thoughts, reciting the *Huangting Erjing Sutra*, her resolve inwardly cultivated, tireless in morning and evening. Was it merely to subdue spirit and soul, aligning with the lofty words of the Sage? Or was it also to return to the roots, to nurture the virtue/power that would shelter all under heaven?\n\nThus, she contemplated the Three Pure Ones, mused upon the Nine Immortals, bowed to the adorned jade scepter, and admired the pendant of the Dao. The Southern Immortal appeared faintly yet with eager anticipation. The Western Mother seemed to manifest in leisurely observation. The responses of the *Pangmi* [膏沐] were revealed day by day, and the accumulated merit progressed year by year. Truly, the Dao can be learned, and the Way is not an empty pursuit.\n\nYet, still mindful of her own incomplete refinement, she had not yet reached the source of the Way. She heard that the **Wuzhu Yuanjun, Wei the Lady of Southern Peak**, in the year *Xingning Jiazi* of the Eastern Jin (349 CE), on the *Xiaoyou* [小有] day of the *Qingxu True Person*’s teaching by the *Xiaohao Tianwang*, received the *Upper Clarity Great Cavern Treasure Scripture* and passed it down to the *Donghua True Person* Yang Jun of Mount Mao, and later to the *Upper Clarity Dao Marshal* Xu Changshi.\n\nSince then, the sacred lineage of the source continued, inheriting the traditions of Huayang, extending the branches of the Dao, and spreading its fragrance across the world. Now, by imperial decree, the *Zhaoying Official of the Jade Clarity* Suong Miao Dasheng Huangfu Xiji and the officials Wang, Wei, and Wen were commissioned to study the margins of Yang and Xu’s teachings. They obtained the *Upper Clarity Three-Grade Divine Scripture*, the *Jade Clarity Hidden Writings*, the *Nine Clarities’ Secrets*, the *Golden God’s Two Tigers and Eight Scenes Jade Record*, the *Imperial Ancestor’s Jade Taboo and Yuan Shi Genealogy*, the *Flowing Gold Fire Bell*, the *Returning Chariot’s Complete Dao*, the *Three Primordials’ Jade Inspection*, the *Nine Phoenix Sacred Scriptures*, the *Purple Text and White Belt*, the *Taixi Yellow Scripture*, the *Guile Palace’s Lingfei Record*—ten volumes in total—and fifteen *Golden Immortal Jade Horse Certificates*.\n\nAccording to the prescribed rites, they prepared the *Golden Dragon*, *Jade Fish*, *Golden Ram*, *Silver Crow*, *Green Silk Golden Button*, *Cloud Brocade Phoenix Pattern*, *Bixia Waving Dust Silk*, *Red Seal Mortuary Silk*, the *Four Rectangular Clear Mirrors*, the *Jingzhen Sacred Sword*, the *Five-Colored Silk Upper Clarity Daoist Robes*, and all ceremonial offerings—none were omitted.\n\nFirst, envoys were dispatched with secret petitions to Southern Peak, conveying the message to the Wuzhu Yuanjun. In silence, she assented to the divine intent.\n\nNext, the **Inner Palace Attendants** Kang Congzheng and Jiang Deyong of the *Western Palace Supply Office*, along with the *Right Street Vice Dao Master* Li Zhishun—who oversaw the *Jade Clarity Zhaoying Temple* and managed the *Left and Right Street Teaching Gates*—the *Suongzhen Dasheng* Shi Zhizhang, the *Left Street Overseer* and *Shouning Guan Abbot* Mingzhen Dasheng, the *Jade Clarity Zhaoying Temple Vice Director* and *Xuanjiao Dasheng* Zhou Suiliang, the *Jade Clarity Zhaoying Temple Abbot* Suongmiao Dasheng Huangfu Xiji, and the *Co-Abbot* Suongmi Dasheng Xue Qinghe—were commissioned to present the *Blue-Worded Petition on Yellow Silk* and perform the rites in person.\n\nAt the **Chongxi Observatory of Mount Mao in Jiangning**, they constructed the *Upper Clarity Yellow Altar*, presided over the *Jade Record Dao Ritual* for seven days and nights, and conducted *360 sessions of the Great Fast* during the day. Following the rites, they held a *Three-Day Thanksgiving Dao Ritual* and a *Grand Fast for All Mountain Daoists and Female Immortals*. They also cast the *Golden Dragon Jade Tablet* and *Golden Ring Jade Fish* into the *Huayang Cave*, *Yan Cave*, and *Jinshan Water Palace*, thereby paying homage to the Seven Saints and expressing sincerity to the Nine Clarities. Thus, the rites of transmission and reception were fulfilled, and the rituals of master and disciple were complete.\n\nOn the day of the ritual’s commencement, the sacred crane descended to greet beneath the feathered canopy. As the altar was erected, the clouds gathered afar in the layered heavens. The morning dew inscribed the true scriptures, and the offerings were presented with reverent sincerity. The orchid incense burned brightly, and the jade moon gathered its light.\n\nThe hundred spirits, ordered and refined, manifested auspicious signs. The Five Peaks’ guardians stood vigilant, offering blessings. At midnight, a sacred wind swept through, and auspicious rain fell. In an instant, the Milky Way shimmered, and the stars blazed like scattered jewels. It was said that the Wind Lord swept the altar, and the Rain Master sprinkled the feast—how could it be otherwise?\n\nWhen the day of transmission arrived, the radiance of the *Nine Xias* flowed like light, dazzling and concentrated. The *Three Pure Ones’* misty qi drifted ethereally in the sky. The wind gathered in awe, the rainbow banners gleamed, and the ritual movements seemed to float. All spirits stood in solemn reverence.\n\nAt the moment of dividing the golden contracts, a white crane circled above the altar, and crimson clouds swirled in the mountains. The osmanthus wind enveloped all, and the sacred fragrance permeated the wilds.\n\nThough the myriad wonders of the Dao have many paths, learning follows an order; though the most sublime mysteries have no fixed method, responses require no delay. This demonstrates the Empress Dowager’s profound sincerity.\n\nThe talismans were reverently received, the spirits and humans aligned in harmony, and the Dao’s mysteries were fulfilled. Without the accumulated virtue of countless eons and the fruit of lifelong aspiration, who could attain this?\n\nIt is known that a good beginning ensures a beautiful end. If one plans with the Dao, what need is there for concern? Thus, the *Eight Scenes of Flying Xias* will gather in celestial feasts, the *Nine-Colored Phoenix’s Brain* and the *Ten Refined Waters* will be offered daily without end.\n\nIn reverence for the Holy Thought, the sacred texts were treated as if they were the most confidential of secrets. This was to glorify the Celestial Sovereign, to safeguard the True Master, to firmly establish the ancestral Dao for ten thousand generations, to bestow triple blessings upon the people, and to forever quell warfare, so that all might share in prosperity and longevity.\n\nThe blessings of later heaven, the boundless lineage, the distant golden lineage, and the grace bestowed upon the common folk—how fitting they are!\n\nObserving the achievements of an age and examining the unrecorded deeds of a hundred kings, I dare to record them in plain words.\n\nIn the third year of the Tian Sheng era (2甲子 year), on the 23rd day of the fourth month (戊午朔), the 23rd day being 庚辰, this was respectfully recorded.\n\nAt the altar, the following were commended and promoted:\n- Upper Clarity Great Cave Master, Minister Zhang Shaoying,\n- Upper Clarity Great Cave Master, Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the Teachings of the\n\n---\n\nIn the realm of the Daoist tradition, there are teachings of purity, tranquility, and boundless void, and doctrines of returning to the True and embracing simplicity. Later generations who took delight in its ways expanded upon these themes, thus arose the dissemination of esoteric scriptures and hidden precepts, the illumination of the Celestial Capital and Sacred Isles, the cultivation of the Three Clouds and Eight Sceneries, and the gatherings of the youthful immortals and the Broad Cold. From the august sovereigns to the humble subjects, all drew upon its transformative power, as recorded in the *Yi Zhuan*. Initially, Emperor **True宗** (Zhenzong), having laid down arms and embraced peace, devoted himself to literary and cultural pursuits, ascending Mount Tai, offering tribute to the Earthly Sovereign, visiting the Celestial Precincts, and erecting the Sacred Hall, striving to unify the imperial rites and emulate the grandeur of former dynasties.\n\nAt this time, the Master held the weighty office of **Grand Marshal and Chancellor**, enjoying the highest favor of the winds and clouds. Alongside a few senior statesmen and eminent scholars, he both adorned the imperial designs within and deliberated on scriptures and rites without. Employing the **elixir of refinement** and the **award of inner nourishment**, he relied on precedent to establish his course and aligned with the humility of the Dao to ensure his decrees were carried out.\n\nWhen it came to inspecting the jade tokens of the sacred mounds, sitting upon the tapestry mats of the **Sui** (Zui) region, patrolling the nearby prefectures, and presiding over the grand altars for ritual offerings, all adhered to the secret records, and his diligence shone forth. He led the **Three Caverns** rites before the Eight Palanquins set out, and also took part in the ceremonial escort.\n\nIn the year of the **Tiger (丙寅)**, he received celestial blessings, revering and honoring ancestral achievements. The Five Sacred Mountains were elevated in title, the numinous springs bore their fruits, and the sacred precincts were expanded in splendor, the hallowed legacy made manifest. The Master was again entrusted with the role of **Imperial Envoy**.\n\nHe gathered the **Sacred Hair** (Hao) attendants and the **abundant scriptures**, selecting the **mirror of ages** from the past and the **rectangular measure** of the future, and was once more commissioned to oversee them.\n\nWith the **mysterious and primordial laws** of Dao, he contributed to the harmonious gatherings, encompassing the essence of lofty peaks and the flow of imperial prosperity. Encountering the flourishing era of the **Sacred Reign**, he obtained the sequence of discussions, and thus selected those scholars who were well-versed in its teachings, examining and rectifying them with meticulous care. The treasures hidden in the **Sacred Mountains and Caverns**, the **golden tablets and jade scriptures**, were all subject to his revisions, concluding without error or discrepancy.\n\nEndowed with innate purity, he furthered the **Sacred Court’s** harmonious assemblies, wandering in the realm of **clustered mists and grand effulgence**, reciting the **melodic verses of Broad Cold**. In dreams, he roamed with **Red Pine**, and in waking moments, he indulged in the **elixir of golden ladle**. Occasionally, he met with the **True Worthies**, engaging in profound discourse on the **wondrous pivots** of the Dao. Thus, he secretly aspired to ascend on clouds, transcending the mundane and departing from the common folk.\n\nWhenever he emerged during moments of rest or on auspicious days, he would screen out worldly affairs and diligently perform the **ritual of exorcism and purification** (挣醮). The altars were solemnly constructed, the **silken banners** fluttered in the breeze, the **dust of the world** did not dare intrude, and the **sacred visions** seemed to resonate in the air. Wrapped in fine wool, he rested for long hours, accumulating his **qi** and forgetting weariness.\n\nIn the year of **Renxi (壬戌)**, he was assigned the **imperial seal** of **Miling** (秣陵), and his heart yearned for this sacred mountain, which lay close to the capital. Soon after, he received an imperial decree, extending his commendation, and was directed to visit the **numinous soil** of the mountain, lingering in its **auspicious domain**. His spirit was at ease, and he drifted in forgetfulness of return.\n\nA recluse named **Juzhi** (朱自英) dwelled in the fertile caves of the mountain, his abode changing with the years. The Master took pleasure in his simple and unadorned ways, as if they were a **kindred spirit of stone**. In the second year of his return to court, the recluse’s reputation had spread.\n\nHe was summoned to the capital, where the Master hosted a grand banquet and engaged him in intimate conversation, far beyond the ordinary. When the recluse returned to the mountain, the Master again made arrangements for a future visit to his **cave-dwelling abode**, their correspondence marked by deep reverence and mystery. **Juzhi** (朱自英) was astonished by this.\n\nA few months later, the Master passed away, leaving behind words that echoed his intent: to build this **sacred structure** here. The total expenditure from his private funds amounted to **150,000**, with no additional contributions from the state.\n\nSubsequent imperial decrees allowed **Juzhi** (朱自英) to come and go as he pleased, all in accordance with the Master’s original intentions.\n\nAccording to the *Zhenzhuang* (《真诰》), the **Sententious** (句曲) land is the **Lung of the Earth**, with fertile soil and pure waters, known as the **Hua Yang Sacred Cavern** (华阳洞天), capable of **transcending the world and nurturing the people**, untouched by the **Three Calamities**. It further states that those of **utter loyalty and filial piety** would first receive **sacred commissions**, then ascend to the ranks of the **Celestial Worthies**, with their **ascensions and descents** recorded in the **registers of the dark and luminous**, akin to the **appraisal of human merit**.\n\nThus, the Master’s devotion to this **lofty peak** and his reverence for its **wondrous symbols** were not in vain.\n\nIndeed, he emerged during the **Age of the Virtuous Sage** (应贤运), ascended to the **highest echelons of power**, and rendered great service to his time. His **virtue and power** were profound, and his **achievements and influence** vast. Without **embracing the numinous qi**, how could he have **aligned with the august worthies** and fulfilled his **grand mission**? Without **harmonizing with the sacred records**, ascending to the **true stages of immortality**, how could he have **manifested the vigor of the Great Peace**?\n\nHis character matched these earlier accounts, and their **mysterious resonance** was confirmed.\n\nAh! To **ride the winds of time**, **striving in both martial and literary pursuits**, **holding the reins of governance**, **revering the sovereign and sheltering the people**, **exhausting his wisdom and virtue**, **upholding the balance of the Dao**, **unshaken by the controversies of the age**, **radiant and awe-inspiring**, and to **end his days in glory**—then, to **shed the mundane and ascend**, joining the **Xianmen** (仙门) and **Yueye** (雇佺) **adepts**, meeting them at the **boundaries of mist and vapor**, was this not a grand and splendid fate?\n\nIndeed, his wife **faithfully upheld the imperial mandate**, never forgetting to **pursue and honor** him. His son, **Yanliang** (寅亮), **Chancellor of the Palace**, **wholeheartedly assisted** in completing the **victorious construction**, ensuring his **exemplary legacy** would endure and forever shine in history.\n\nIt is said that **Chen Fu** (陈辅), a **disciple of the early years** who frequented the Master’s **abode of literary pursuits**, was entrusted with **commissions for writing**, and his works were inscribed upon **gold and stone**. Thus, he accepted the **honor of the imperial appointment**, though he was unworthy of such grandeur.\n\nThe Master bore the surname **Wang**, given name **Qinruo**, and courtesy name **Dingguo**. His wife bore the surname **Li**.\n\nThe lineage and official records of the Master’s **native village and clan**, along with the **sequence of his ancestral offices**, are inscribed in the **historic annals** above and **engraved in stone** below—these details are known and thus omitted here.\n\nThis inscription was made in the **second year of Regency** (庆历二年), the year of the **Tiger and Horse** (壬午), on the **twentieth day of the tenth month** (乙卯).\n\n**Mengzi Xuan** (孟子宣), **Judge of the Daoist Temple** at **Buzheng** (句曲) and **Superintendent of the Observatories**, granted the **purple robe**, and **Leiping Hu** (雷平胡恢), **Superintendent of the Daoist Temple**, inscribed the **stele** with their brushes. **Lugong** (陆绛), a **Junior Official** and **Guardian of the Juren County** (句容县尉), was responsible for **overseeing the construction and erection** of the stone.\n\n**Stele of the 23rd Generation Grand Master of Upper Clarity, Master of the Great Cavern, Miao Xiansheng** (幽光显扬) **of Jianyuan Temple** (乾元观妙先生) **at Mount Mao** (茅山).\n\n**Chen Fu** (陈辅) of **Cloudyang’s Southern Suburbs** (云阳南郭) **crafted** the stele, while **Cai Reng** (蔡仍), **Scholar of the Western Mountains of the Seven Prefectures** (七闽西山), **wrote and inscribed** the epitaph.\n\nThe Master bore the surname **Juzhi** (朱氏), given name **Ziying** (自英), and courtesy name **Yinzhi** (隐芝), hailing from **Juyang** (朱阳里) in **Juqiu** (句曲).\n\nThe Master was eight or nine years old when he tended cattle in the **Goudian Village** (郭干村). The other boys rolled up reeds to make whistles and played with them, cracking their whips and driving the cattle. The Master declined to join, and the herdsmen laughed at him. The Master smiled and said, *\"How is it that you ride oxen, yet cannot ride a crane?\"* Slowly, he drew a flute from his sleeve, split a bamboo stalk, and a crane descended from the sky, dancing in the air. The Master mounted it, but the crane soared and he fell. The herdsmen gasped in alarm.\n\nFrom that time onward, he followed the herdsmen, and often summoned cranes. Some warned that this was an omen of misfortune, so his parents abandoned him to the Dao. He became a disciple of **Master Zhu Wengji** (朱文吉) at **Yuchen Temple** (玉晨观). His studies were diligent, and though he was enrolled in the **literary register**, he would read a text, close the book, and declare, *\"I am familiar with it.\"* His teacher, though unable to match his mastery, marveled at him.\n\nAt eleven, he was ordained as a Daoist. His celestial bearing and refined bones already set him apart from the world. Though born in the countryside, he had never seen Confucian classics or Daoist scriptures, yet when asked about burning incense and reciting the **Six Classics**, the **Hundred Schools**, and the **Three Vehicles and Thirty-Six Divisions**, he spoke fluently without pause. Elders from afar, well-versed in learning, sought his presence, eager to behold his countenance.\n\nThe Master sat alone in a chamber, eyes closed, reciting texts from memory. Those who listened found not a single word omitted. As he grew older, he composed essays with effortless grace, excelling particularly in **elegant verse** (风雅). His words were sharp and profound, like the resonant tones of an empty void.\n\n**Ma Gong** (牧马公), **Bright** (亮), of **Jinling** (金陵), sent an official with a letter, which the Master set aside without reply. His teacher, fearing offense, confessed his inadequacy, but the Master said, *\"No, you have honored me.\"* Thereafter, he traveled with **Master Zhang Shaoying** (张炼师绍英), scaling **Jijin Peak** (积金峰) by clinging to vines, and residing in the **Tian Shi Altar** (天市坛) and **Ronghuo Hall** (宠火院).\n\nThe two withdrew from society, their bodies growing gaunt from fasting on **stardust** (沆尘), and they pursued the **Three Manifestations** (三景). They practiced the **Yili Dangpei Method** (仪璘当佩之法) to hasten their lightness of being. Soon, their outer chambers were filled with visitors, and the Master turned to Zhang, saying, *\"What is this? You have brought so many to my doorstep—do you not fear it is too much?\"*\n\nZhang replied, *\"Do not worry. People will soon tire of you. If you were to seek fame in the world, there would surely be those who would not tolerate it. Why bother traveling?\"*\n\nThe Master said, *\"To stay or to go—each follows its own path. Why must they be the same?\"*\n\nThus, he would ascend the altar by day and cross the river by night, intending to pay homage to the **Primordial Origin** (混元) at **Hao She** (毫社) and to greet the **Celestial Master** (天师) at **Qingcheng**.\n\nAs he passed through the **Sword Gate Pass** (剑门) and journeyed westward, he encountered an old man with a long beard, white hair, and piercing eyes like a calf’s. The old man sat cross-legged and demanded, *\"Young man, whence do you come?\"*\n*\"From Huayang,\"* he replied.\nThe old man asked again, *\"And where are you bound?\"*\n\nThe Master said, *\"From Shu.\"*\n\n*\"In Shu, what do you seek?\"*\n*\"The Great Elixir.\"*\n\nThe old man cast his head back and laughed aloud, *\"Young man, have you not heard of Tao the Hermit of Yinxu? He was a man of worth! After five refinements, his elixir still did not manifest, and only then did he utter his three-day lament over fleeting fame. Thus, he never achieved the White Day’s soaring ascension, but instead followed Gubao and left.\n\nAs for you, your foundational Dao is not yet complete, your Way only partially attained. If you do not **withdraw and conceal your luminous virtue** (潜晦光曜), they will **brandish you with benevolence and righteousness** (桁扬汝以仁义) and **mutilate you with rites and music** (劓刖汝以礼乐), making you a spectacle for both Heaven and the people—truly lamentable!\"*\n\nThe Master said, *\"Cast me into the depths of a cavern, and I shall reveal my fate.\"*\n\nThe old man then pointed and gazed into the distance, *\"The Hermit told me: seven hundred years hence, a child of virtue shall emerge from Maoshan. Surely this is your destiny.\"* He then recited the *Precepts of the Hidden and True Hermit* (登真隐诀) and commanded the Master to close his eyes. *\"Hold my staff firmly.\"* Suddenly, the Master felt a brush against his feet, opened his eyes, and found himself seated beneath Qingcheng Mountain. He then **silently performed** the Nine-Turned Golden Cauldron (金鼎九转) and the Flying Essence Sword Method (飞精剑法).\n\nWhen the matter was concluded, the Master said, *\"My flesh-born body and eyes of mortal sight cannot recognize your venerable self. Another day, I shall come again—like the shadow of a mountain at the foot of the valley—is that acceptable?\"*\n\nThe old man replied, *\"The world knows me as Chen Tiejiao; that is I.\"*\n\n*\"In years past, the late Emperor Taizong sent me to seek the elixir beyond the seas, but there was only Danji Anqi’s lingering delay—thus, I missed the chance.\"* He finished speaking and vanished.\n\nThe Master left the pass, intending to continue his journey eastward. Yet, he reflected that the *Daoist Canon of the Three Maos* (三茅道藏) was incomplete, so he **loaded his supplies and traveled to Lixiang** (濑乡), where he **collated and corrected** the ancient texts of the *Way of Great Clarity* (太清).\n\nAfter a year, a mendicant of the Wu clan often came by day, carrying a patched basket to the **alms hall** (斋堂), where he would **upside-down** the remaining food on the stone plate before departing. The crowd scolded him for not taking it, but when the Master had finished washing the utensils, the mendicant inquired about his affairs.\n\nThe Master was then in his **yellow robes of the first grade** (黄衣初腊). The mendicant raised his hands and exclaimed, *\"Jute Maoshan and others are like this beggar seeking the Five Daoists!* (伍仙#4) Thus, I abandoned my search. I shall meet you tomorrow at the **flag pavilion inn** (旗亭酒家) to discuss the Way with you.\"*\n\nTurning to the Master, he said, *\"You are truly a Daoist vessel! Only, your old habits have not yet been purged—you have not yet been **washed and refined** (洒濯). If you do not, you will only burden yourself further. Can you go?\"*\n\nThe Master replied, *\"How dare I disobey your command? I shall **conceal my eyes** (藏睛).\"*\n\nA short while later, a **rustling sound** (哄然) struck his ears. Suddenly, he beheld a **bounded landscape** (阅阖), and the mendicant turned to him, *\"This is the River Middle Prefecture.\"* Before long, they reached the river, where the **flow was halted** (截流) to allow crossing. The Master **stepped forward** (踵之), as if **treading upon flat land** (平陆).\n\nUpon reaching the shore, the mendicant Wu, **joyful and delighted** (欣欣), exclaimed, *\"A worthy disciple can be instructed! I am your Water Star Disciple.\"* (水星童子)\n\n*\"Your single journey has already brought you to the **Great Transformation of Form at Taiyin** (度形太阴). Yet, you must **retreat into seclusion** (幽屏), and not weary of **deep concealment** (深眇). The great artisan does not reveal the unpolished gem to the world—otherwise, it would not be easily understood.\"*\n\nAt another time, they met again to **delve into the subtle mysteries** (审究夷微). The mendicant then **abruptly departed** (遽背而去), and the Master was **deeply grieved** (怆恨).\n\nWhen he returned to his native mountain, he **examined his heart and refined his resolve**, treasuring the teachings of the two Masters, **preserving the Three Protections and the One** (存三守一), and **emulating the fervor of Yang and Xu** (追杨许之烈).\n\nNot long after, the **Palace of the Celestial Clarity** (玉清昭应宫) was completed. A decree was issued selecting men of **renowned conduct** (名行). The **Minister of Works** (工部侍郎), Xue Ying, submitted the Master’s name, and the court sent an envoy to summon him. The Master declined with a **respectful memorial** (表辞), but the official carriages soon followed in procession. The **Emperor of Virtue** (章圣) ascended to Heaven, and the **Temple of Benevolence** (仁庙) succeeded his **spiritual service** (嗣服).\n\nUnder the **reign of the Illustrious and Austere Empress Dowager** (明肃太后), who ruled from behind the screen, Ding Jinong (晋公) and Wang Jiping (冀公) both recommended the Master to the court. The Master was summoned twice, but again declined. His **decline was expressed with warmth and elegance** (谢表温雅), bearing the **refined character of a Confucian scholar** (儒臣高世之风). The court admired him, and thus the two ministers composed poems:\n\nDing Jinong’s poem:\n*\"Great Concealment—why fear the bustling capital?\nThe Three Heavens’ **pure disputes** (澄诤) to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign.\"* (元君)\n\nWang Jiping’s poem:\n*\"Why did you, a man of worth, break your ancient vow?\n**Carrying your lute and burdening your crane** (负琴担鹤), waiting to follow me.\"*\n\nThe Master responded in kind, his words **exquisitely refined** (词极清妙). The two ministers then **urged the Empress Dowager** to compel the Master to accept office, and the local officials **pressured him with threats of punishment** (敦迫). The Master, **having no choice** (不得已), thus **reluctantly took up the appointment** (受命劫).\n\nBefore he had **formally presented himself to the court** (经朝见), all officials were **prohibited from visiting him** (禁不得通谒), even **梁器、陶景、唐礼、昊筠**—yet these were **not worthy to compare with even a fraction of his merit** (未足方万分).\n\nSoon, by imperial decree, he **ascended the Treasure Symbol Pavilion** (宝符阁) to **inspect the Celestial Scriptures** (观天书). He repeatedly **submitted memorials requesting retirement** (累表乞退), but the **two Sovereigns** (二圣) favored him more than ever, fearing that his **bold defiance of courtly norms** (重违雅尚) would bring shame. Thus, the Master was **granted permission to return to his homeland** (得请束归故乡), where he **resolved to focus his mind and refine his thoughts** (决志精思), his **heart drifting into the boundless expanse** (心驰太空之境).\n\nThe court **bestowed rewards upon his journey** (赐劳), and **processions of carriages** (车盖) stretched endlessly.\n\nBefore this, a **nobleman** (贵人) had **reported to the Empress Dowager** (传上) about the Master’s **request for a mountain retreat** (近山立常宁一镇), saying that he wished to **provide a resting place for travelers and merchants** (为游客行商息肩之所).\n\nThe Master replied, *\"A Daoist must **dwell in rocky retreats and cavernous abodes** (岩居穴处), diligently **cultivate the Supreme Methods** (勤修上法), and **follow the rigorous ascetic practices** of the Great Mao’s **Celestial Command** (保大茅司命之苦行). Only then can I **recompense the imperial favor** (报国恩).*\n\n*\"If I were to **imitate the Western lands’ ornate temples and grand decorations** (效西方土木装严), it would not align with the **Teachings of the Venerable Laozi’s frugality and benevolence** (老氏慈俭之教).\"*\n\nThe court **acceded to his request** (从之).\n\nThe **Daoist Canon of the Three Caverns and Four Stages** (三洞四阶灵文宝岌), containing **sacred texts bound in gold and sealed with jade** (金绳玉检), is the **great secret transmission** (秘传大法) of the Way. From **Wei’s Nan Yue** (魏南岳) onward, down to the Master, it has been **passed through twenty-three generations** (二十有三代).\n\nThe Illustrious and Austere Empress Dowager wished to **follow the precedent of the Purple Void** (紫虚故事), **praying for the transmission of all the Dao’s methods** (祈授毕法). She **distant-revered** (遥尊) Zhu and Zhang as **Guiding Masters** (度保师), bestowing upon the Master the title **Observing Marvels, Illuminating True Perfection** (观妙明真), and constructing the **Heavenly Holy and Primordial Sovereign Observatories** (乾元、天圣两观) to **honor his teacher-student lineage** (旌师资). The Master did not decline this.\n\nAt that time, **the elixir vapors ascended, the divine essence flew** (琅讦飞精), and the **three furnaces’ divine aura** (神景三炉) had reached the **fourth turn of fire** (四转火).\n\nOne day, the **Jiangning Prefecture** (江宁府) received a letter from the **Shu State Governor** (蜀州守), Xiao Guan, regarding a **Daoist named Wu Bao** (道士武抱) who had **a book in hand** (一书者). The Master took the book, and **tears flowed in streams** (泣数行下). His disciples could not **fathom its meaning** (莫测所以).\n\nThe letter **reproached him for his prominent name and exposed virtue** (责姓名显耀), warning him of the **fault of revealing celestial secrets** (天机暴露). It **urged him to avoid worldly affairs and conceal himself** (避俗藏身), and even **suggested he depart in the middle of the night** (中宵引去), saying that **this might yet be salvable** (犹为可救).\n\nThe literary style was elegant and refined, with much to admire. The *jìnshēn* (文致) and *zǎoliàn* (藻练) scholars and officials, wearing their official caps and robes, frequently criticized and opposed the Master, warning against his influence. Their portraits and inscriptions were passed down through the ages—such as the so-called **Wu Xian Tong** (武仙童).\n\nIn the seventh year of **Tian Sheng** (天圣), when the **Great Elixir** (大丹) was completed, the cauldron overturned, and the elixir favored the disciple **Mao Fengrou** (毛奉柔), who secretly informed the Master of its state. The Master sighed and said: *\"The setting sun is near, and the dog’s mouth has passed once—truly so.\"*\n\nBy that year’s eleventh month, he had **laid down his office** (解驾), at the age of fifty-three. That very evening, he **closed the mountain gate** (掩关), forbidding his disciples from entering, which was **unusual** (颇异常时).\n\nAs the night reached its midpoint, the disciples gathered around his furnace altar, awaiting the **Dawn of the Jade Morning** (玉晨), when a **red-robed messenger** (朱衣使者) holding a scroll stood below the courtyard. Though his bearing was **composed and dignified** (甚都), his radiance dazzling like a mirror, the boy questioned him: *\"Who are you?\"* The messenger replied slowly: *\"I am **Zhen Guan Xia Lu Wenxiu** (真官下卢文秀), sent by the **Celestial Emperor** (帝) to welcome the **Jade Master** (朱真人).\"*\n\nThe disciples **stood in stunned silence** (牢肩惕息), not daring to move. Shortly after, the Master inquired about the hour, and was told: *\"The third watch has passed.\"* Then he asked again: *\"Has the **Jade Morning Bell** (玉晨钟) sounded yet?\"* The reply came: *\"Not yet.\"* He asked repeatedly, four times in all. When the bell finally chimed, the Master called his attendants: *\"I depart now.\"* Upon entering, they saw him **seated in solemn stillness** (危坐), holding the **Auspicious Symbol** (祥符) bestowed upon him—a **jade *ruyi*** (玉如意)—**erect and dignified** (俨然).\n\nThat evening, the heavens were bitterly cold, yet the Master’s neck emitted a **circular radiance** (圆光), filling the chamber with warmth. His **jade body** (玉体) glistened with sweat like pearls. As the **final rites** (大敛) were being conducted, a faint sound emerged from his coffin. The **Daoist law** (法固) called this **corpse dissolution** (尸解). When the coffin was lifted, they suspected only an empty robe remained.\n\nThe day before, **Tao Zhenren** (陶真人) had sat in silence, **shaken by tremors** (无故震者) three times. The assembly was **astonished** (咸异), but the Master remarked: *\"Why should this concern you?\"* That very night, his **spirit was transferred** (迁神), and **cranes cried** (鹤唳) as the altar revolved. The **valley winds hummed like flutes** (谷鸣若箫), and this continued for three days.\n\nThe **temporary magistrate of Jùróng** (句容权令), a **harsh official** (酷吏), was later replaced by **Chancellor Lǐ Gōng Dí** (丞相李公迪) during his tenure. When the Chancellor sent his subordinates with **words of invitation** (致词), urging the Master to visit and **bestow Daoist blessings upon the county** (俾县加道修肃), the Master **passed through the town without stopping** (不顾而去), and the magistrate, **harboring resentment** (阴衔之), **did not detain him further** (还又不少留).\n\nHis attendants urged: *\"The magistrate has donned his official robes and awaits you on the left. You should descend from your carriage and pay him a visit.\"* The Master replied: *\"It is not that I refuse, but the **blood-stained air** (血腥) is too hard to bear.\"* Later, when the magistrate’s **misfortunes grew worse** (闻益患), he **accused the Master’s disciples of poisoning him** (中丹毒死) and **drove them away** (尽逐先生徒弟). Many fled without time to spare, and the **strange auspices of Jiāxiáng** (嘉祥异瑞) were **suppressed and slandered** (为其所抑，诬) by him.\n\nEven the **Nine Palaces** (九重) of the imperial court were **vast and distant** (寥廓), offering no recourse. The following year, when the magistrate was removed from office, the disciples were finally able to **return and bury the Master** (葬反真之宅) in **Yùgāng’s western slope** (郁冈西麓), near the **corner of the *Fāngyuán* Cave** (方隅洞之束), a few steps from **Lǐ Zhenren’s Elixir Well** (李真人丹井), at a height of three *chǐ* (尺).\n\nAlas! **Though the Master’s foundation of purity and cultivation was profound** (夙净基修), it was **unfulfilled in some way** (宜无不圆), yet even he met misfortune. **How much more so for the ordinary disciples** (况悠悠之徒)!\n\nThe Master’s successor, Xu Master, with his disciple Stone Zhirou serving as attendant, after fifty-nine years, in the year *Dīngmǎo* (丁卯), when Stone Zhirou had passed eighty, **ascended to the Dao** (得西剑州道客任), and was entrusted with the task of recording the Master’s deeds. Yet his account was **scanty and incomplete**, with more than half **obscured and lost** (漫灭过半矣). Kneeling and weeping, he said:\n\n**\"The Master’s Dao can be grasped in a moment, but how can it be rejected for a thousand years?** (先生之道，可扼於一时，庸拒郁於千载。) Thinking to awaken the **hidden virtue** (潜德) of his **faintly luminous essence** (幽光), who but the Master himself could accomplish this? His intention was that, at **ninety years of age** (仆九十岁), he, as a **partial favorite** (偏亲) of the Master’s Three Scenes disciples, would obtain a **detailed account** (详).\n\nUpon his return, he told his kin: **\"The Stone family’s words are indeed my long-held aspiration** (石氏子之谓，乃吾素志), why not **commission the Great Teacher** (大宗师) to **craft elegant prose** (奉命藻雪) and **inscribe it with meticulous strokes** (涓辰而书)? Thus, he bowed with clasped hands and prostrated himself, offering a **praise in verse**:\n\n*\"Descendant of the House of High Yang* (繁高阳氏之遗裔兮), born in the **numinous precinct** (灵墟) of his name.\nIn youth, he wore the **purple robes of Zǐyáng** (紫阳之羽褐兮), yet **answered the call of the Red Infant’s symbol** (应赤子之识符).\n\nHe crossed the **treacherous peaks of Jiànlǐng** (剑岭之危峨兮), clutching the **long skirts of the Iron-Soled Sage** (执铁脚之长裙).\nHe forded the Yellow River **barefoot** (凭黄河以徒涉兮), following the **dual footprints of Xīngtóng** (蹑星童之双亮).\n\nAt the time of the **threefold imperial blessing** (帝三叶之庆祥兮), his **courtly rank was empty** (属春宫之位虚).\nHe was **honored with the jade bracelets of the High-Sleeved** (祀高襟以诏弓镯兮), yet the **Celestial Cavern ceased its charge of fate** (洞天辍司命之友于).\n\nHe received the **transmission from the Jade Maiden** (膺玉女之受度兮), continuing the **Purple Void of the Primordial Lord** (续元君之紫虚).\nHe sheltered in the **hidden desk of Zāoyìng** (昭应之隐几兮), gazing upon the **Celestial Script** (观天书) while **embracing the Treasure Seal** (阁宝符).\n\nHe first **followed the Dao of the Upper Realm**, ascending *Kōngtóng* (崆峒) and descending with the **favorable wind** (顺下风兮), then **suddenly vanished**, arriving at the **path of return** (俄泠然而及归途).\nClinging to the **imperial favor** (攀帝恩), yet **reluctant** (恋恋兮), how could he **dare to delay the Sage’s appointed term** (奈仙期之敢瑜)?\n\nMorning he left the **vermilion gate** (绛阙), evening he returned to the **embroidered peaks** (绣岭), yet the **True Official had already descended to the courtyard** (真官已降于庭除).\nWith **three vehicles perfected** (三乘圆) and **seven fruits attained** (七果), he **soared his form** (将耸身) to **pierce the void** (凌空).\n\nNo **farewell bows** (揖) were needed as he **rode the flying wheel**, mastering the **Six Qi** (御六气兮), and **ultimately returned to the Dao** (竟归神) in the **Pure Capital** (清都).\nHe **preserved the sun’s essence** (系日保深息兮), and his **dwelling was woven of mist and clouds** (烟霞结庐).\nHis **mysterious wanderings** (玄游) were vast—**Dragon and Tiger** (龙虎) **joined their chariots** (胶舆), yet **he soared beyond** (怅超遥), leaving no trace in the **elixir furnace of Tóngwú** (桐梧之丹炉).\n\nThe **Green Cow Valley** (青牛谷) resounded—**stone altars overgrown with moss** (石坛藓合).\nThe **white willow rustled with solemn wind** (白榆风肃兮), while the **jade coffin and lone sword** (玉棺剑孤) stood.\nAll were **emptied in the Imperial Grace’s embrace** (俱虚皇之在宥), and the **Treasure Record was entrusted to the ancestral diagram** (绵宝录於宗图).\n\nThe **Martial Sage** (武仙) **inscribed the records of the Immortal Attendant** (童书碑), with **the Sage’s small likeness carved** (上刻仙童小像) and **the Daoist’s portrait of Daochéng** (道士戴道成画) beside it.\nHe held a **single scroll** (抱一启), declaring:\n\n*\"He roamed in lofty ease, scornful of wealth and high rank* (啸傲升平，轻欺富贵). He **leaned against the sparse laurels** (扶疏丹桂), yet **could not conceal the bright moon’s light** (难藏明月之光).\n**Steeple and sheer as the green peaks** (峭绝青山), he **did not halt the white clouds’ passage** (莫滞白云之迹).\n**Words are insufficient** (言之不足), yet the **Dao is within** (道在其中).\n**His name and lineage are now revealed** (名姓已彰), yet **his form and spirit remain hidden** (形神别隐) in the **Three Mountains** (三山), across the **four seas** (四海).\"\n\n「The years pass—how fixed is their span?

**be positioned to the left** (而左本命).\"」\n\nThe Three Gates are the pathways of the divine spirits; without ritual offerings and exorcisms, they remain closed. To the east, a Daoist academy was established; to the west, a guest hall was set up. Thus, distinctions of rank are preserved, Daoists and laymen do not intermingle, and mortals and spirits remain separate.\n\nThe official said: \"Your reasoning is excellent. The temples of this mountain have been built and abandoned at different times throughout history. Many Daoist attendants have dwelled here. Yet none has ever used the theories of the Three *Qi*, the Three Heavens, the Three Venerables, and the Three Emperors to correct the order of ascension and descent. Was it perhaps the elevation of the formless and the return to stillness? Or was it a neglect of the proper use of ritual implements, leading to the creation of movement? Or an ignorance of the essence of the Absolute Void?\n\nFollowing your proposal, the county of *Yóuchéng* was reassigned to oversee the rectification. The work was completed accordingly.\n\nThe following spring, in the fifth month, the Hall of Yùhuáng was finished. On the day of its consecration, a pair of white cranes circled and soared above for the entire day, their cries echoing from afar. Then, the Master of the Upper Clarity Great Cavern, **Liú Hùnkāng**, along with his disciple entrusted with recording, remarked: \"At other times, white cranes would gather here on the eighteenth day of the third month, sometimes appearing and sometimes not, never consistently. Now that the hall is complete and the cranes descend, this is not merely the result of the official’s sincere reverence—it is the silent harmony with the True. How else could such an auspicious sign be summoned? We request that a portrait of the official be painted in a separate chamber, so that the people of our land may forever honor his memory.\"\n\nAfter the rites were completed, a request was made of **Shāng Yīng** to compose a record, and he wrote the following ode:\n\nBefore the *Qi* coalesced, it was called *Zìrán* by force of name.\nTo embody the Void was the Dao; to move the Dao gave rise to Heaven.\nThree manifestations, one concealed; one foundation, three perfections complete.\nDivided into Nine *Qi*, arranged into Eight *Xián*.\nLofty and towering, the Teased Peak—southern sentinel of the land.\nThe Emperor resides in the Daoist temple, exalted above the mountain’s base.\nAt first, the rites were mismanaged, their order confused and disordered.\nThe official corrected them, and the spirits responded as if in echo.\nThe cranes, adorned in ceremony, descended from the cloudy heights.\nWho guides them? There, they drift in boundless ease.\nTheir *Qi* converges at the Supreme Void; their spirits wander in profound stillness.\nObserved from below, their virtue shines resplendent.\nThe palaces gleam, the cliffs and valleys radiate brilliance.\nThe winds bear the banners, the officials pause and rest, then depart.\nThis mountain bears auspicious signs; this land has its worthy.\nMay the Son of Heaven reign ten thousand years, his blessings extending to all quarters.\nThe official governs his domain—all affairs are in order.\nThe spirits heed him, for it is his virtue alone.\nGrant him abundant harvests, that his people may prosper.\nBestow upon him many blessings, that he may live long and in peace.\nThe people, moved with reverence, paint his likeness.\nMay his image endure with the mountain, to match the eternal scene.\n\n「In the third year of the *Shàoshèng* era, on the eighth day of the eleventh month, the Daoist master *Sān Jǐng* of the *Shàoshèng* Three Scenes Sect, the abbot of *Jiāngníng*’s *Chóngxǐ* Observatory, and the officials *Dīng Wéi* (the *Jiāngníng* Prefectural Inspectorate’s *Tújiǔ* for temple renovations) and *Hé Zhèngchén* (the *Jiāngníng* Military Prefect, *Jiāngnán* Circuit’s *Bīngmǎ Jiànxiá*, and *Zhùgōng* with a purple sash and golden fish pouch) erected this stele.\n\nEmperor Xuānhe’s Inscription on the *Huàdào* Stele:\n\nThe Dao/Way is boundless, its subtleties unfathomable.\nIt encompasses the transformations of existence, nurturing the heavens and earth.\nThus, the state devoutly reveres the Most High,\nand with awe honors the Dao/Way—\nexpanding the sacred origin of transformation,\nall returning to the true teaching of rectitude.\n\nSince the birth of the people, none have truly known the path to the Dao/Way,\nand this has endured for ages.\n\nWhenever I reflect upon this, my heart aches with sorrow,\nfor the Dao/Way is the embodiment of the Sage’s essence,\nused daily by the common folk without their knowing.\nHence, its principles are kept hidden in reverence,\nand I seek earnest and profound minds\nto establish norms and guide customs,\nso I issue earnest admonitions,\nthat all who come after may find clarity and return to the Dao/Way.\n\nNow, those who are agitated and restless,\nunaware of the Dao/Way’s wondrous nurturing,\nyet instead follow the heterodox customs of ritualistic practices—\naccustomed to their ways, they also teach their methods.\nThey equate stillness with emptiness,\nand extinguishment with true joy,\nleading the ignorant masses to perish in their delusions.\nThis is their natural course—\nhow can one not pity their profound confusion?\n\nMoreover, humans dwell between heaven and earth,\nat the most vital point of existence.\nWhen conceived in the womb,\nthey are nourished by the Three Primordials,\ntheir form shaped by the Nine *Qi* breaths.\nBearing heaven above and earth beneath,\nnone escape the Dao/Way’s foundation.\n\nThose of superior wisdom,\nwho early discern the numinous and refined,\nneed no instruction and naturally incline toward the Dao/Way—\nperhaps three in a thousand.\n\nAs for those of middling or lesser wisdom,\nthey are ensnared by the concerns of names and rituals, wealth and rank.\nThough the Dao/Way’s benevolent nurturing exists,\nthey yield to the burdens of familial affection,\nstill lingering in the pleasures of sound and color,\nthus appearing as if lost or barely present.\n\nThe lowest of the wise,\ncontent with fine food and clothing,\ncomforted by ease and familiar customs,\nremain utterly oblivious to the Dao/Way’s path,\nforsaking truth for falsehood,\nunaware that their very form and *Qi* are born of the Dao/Way itself.\n\nIndeed, humans are to the Dao/Way as fish are to water—\nfish lose the water, they die.\nHumans lose the Dao/Way—what fate awaits them?\n\nAll who govern the people must surely uphold the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way is the summation of the void,\nthe source of all transformations.\nIts vastness knows no beginning,\nits depth no end.\nAll phenomena arise from it,\nthe Five Tones take shape through it—\nthus, though the six directions may seem immense,\nthey are contained within it,\nand though a single hair may seem minuscule,\nit owes its form to its influence.\nIts remoteness cannot be ascended step-by-step,\nits responses are swift yet unseen—\nthis is called *húnlún* (indiscriminate unity).\n\n*Húnlún* is the essence of the *Tàijī* (Supreme Ultimate).\n\nThus, the *Tàijī* generates the Two Polarities—\nheaven and earth.\nThe clear *Qi* ascends to form heaven,\nthe turbid *Qi* descends to form earth,\nand their harmonious mingling creates humanity.\nHence, the Five Celestial Stems radiate their essence,\nthe Three Celestial Lights descend to aid,\nand the Three Talents are perfected.\n\nIn its transformative workings,\nthe Dao/Way manifests the seasons of heat and cold, dryness and moisture,\nthe names of square and round, form and instrument,\nthe degrees of waxing and waning, ebb and flow.\nThus, the sun and moon adorn the sky,\nthe stars follow their appointed courses,\nthunder and lightning strike like drums,\nwinds and rains moisten like waves.\nIt sows the hundred grains in due time,\nto nourish the people,\nand multiplies life and growth,\nto enrich the eternal harvests.\nThen, each person fulfills their potential,\nand all things follow their nature—\nthus, they reap to eat, weave to clothe,\nand rejoice in the world of great peace,\nall because of the Dao/Way’s wondrous creation and nurturing.\n\nObserve the ages from *Fúxī* down to the Three Dynasties—\nthough their titles differed,\ntheir reverence for the Dao/Way and service to heaven remained one.\n\nNow, those who are shrouded in ignorance and inverted in their ways,\nshould investigate its principles and worship them with awe—\nis this not virtuous?\n\nAnd what of those who are clearly enlightened above?\nThey are indeed to be feared and revered.\n\nNow, I clarify and instruct,\nspreading salvation to those steeped in old habits,\nexpanding the blessings of all under heaven,\nso that those who change for the better may cherish life,\nawaken with sudden realization,\nand renew their resolve,\nreturning to the true Dao/Way.\nAbove, this aligns with the Most High’s enjoyment of heaven,\nbelow, it fulfills the mandate of the *Yīn* (dark) and *Shào* (light) to continue the *Bù* (ancient) and *Xù* (future) traditions—\nthus, the beauty of the *Huángjí* (august sovereignty) radiates,\nenduring in the realm of virtue and morality,\npermeating the domain of benevolence and longevity—\nis this not magnificent?\n\nOn the *Xiāntiān* Festival of the *Gēngyín* year of the *Dàguān* era,\ninscribed at the *Xuānhe* Hall.\n\nIn the second year of the *Zhènghé* era, on the twenty-sixth day of the first month,\nthe Daoist master *Shǒujìng Chénghé* of the *Guàndìng* Sect erected this stele,\nfollowed by the Thirty-Third Heavenly Master of the Han lineage, *Zhāng Jìxiān*,\nwho inscribed the text.\nThis concludes Volume Twenty-Five of the *Máoshān Zhì*.\n#1 Song Stele: [original text missing; restored from

records, during the Western Han dynasty, there resided upon **Jīnlíng Jùqū Shān** (金陵句曲山) a **True Person** (真人), who embraced **divine essence** (神) in stillness, transcending the world with **serene detachment** (超然遗物). **Celestial sages** (仙圣) descended to converse with him, enabling his ascent to the **Clouded Heavens** (云天). From his remaining **Dao/Way** (绪余), he transformed the **Latter Han** (二季), who also departed as **transcendents** (仙去)—this was the **Three Teachings Master** (三茅君), and thus the mountain came to be called **Máo Shān** (茅山).\n\nSince that time, **strange luminosities** (光景之异), **auspicious cranes and clouds** (云鹤之祥), and **resonant music** (笙箫之响) have been frequently witnessed upon its slopes. Among those of the **outer realm** (方外), many **seeking the Dao/Way** (慕道) arrived, drawn by its renown—**countless in number** (莫可胜数).\n\nAt the beginning of the **Xīnxīng era** (熙宁), a **Daoist** (道士) from **Chángzhōu**, **Liú Hùnkāng** (刘混康), first constructed a **thatched hut** (茅结庵) upon **Jījīn Fēng** (积金峰) of the mountain. Upon his arrival, he gathered **acorns and chestnuts** (橡栗) for sustenance and burned **bridge-tree seeds** (桥实) as incense. With time, he found their taste **unweariingly sweet** (甘之不厌), and thus people gradually came to regard him as **strange and wondrous** (信异). Many carried **firewood and provisions** (负薪裹粮) to sustain him.\n\nThe Master himself possessed **mysterious conduct** (妙行) and supplemented it with **constant benevolence** (常善), aiding all living beings. He often administered **Upper Clarity Elixir Water** (上清符水) to cure illnesses, and those who ingested it **recovered without fail** (辄愈). Thus, people from near and far **converged in streams** (辐赓), and the Master’s fame grew ever more renowned.\n\n**Philosopher-Emperor Zhèngzōng** (哲宗) summoned him to the capital, where he was received in the **Banquet Hall** (燕见便殿) and granted the title **Dòngyuán Tōngmiào Dàshī** (洞元通妙大师). He was further commanded to renovate and expand his original residence, which, upon the **change of era to Yuánsù** (元符), was renamed **Yuánsù Guàn** (元符观). Though the Master repeatedly declined and sought to return, permission was granted.\n\nYet even through the reign of **Philosopher-Emperor Zhèngzōng**, the **Yuánsù Guàn** remained unfinished. In the **second autumn of Emperor Huìzōng’s reign** (皇帝二年秋), a **court eunuch** (中贵) was dispatched to urgently summon the Master to the capital. The emperor also issued decrees to the **regional governors and inspectors** (守臣监司), instructing them to **persuade him thoroughly** (委曲敦谕), ensuring he made no further excuses.\n\nUpon his arrival from **Máo Shān**, the Master remained in audience for a long time, his words aligning with the emperor’s intentions. Later, when inquired about the **Three Teachings Master**, he recounted all he had heard, prompting the emperor to **bestow an elevated title** (韶加锡号) upon the **Three Teachings Master** and construct a **hall for ritual worship** (构殿以礼祠) upon the mountain in his honor.\n\nThe Master further requested the construction of a **Hall of the Emperor’s Original Command** (本命殿) in the **southern bundle** (束南隅) upon the **Longevity Land** (长生地), which was granted. Thus, **bells were installed in towers**, **scriptures were harmonized**, **annual offerings were made to disciples**, **daily provisions were provided to the assembly**, and all official matters were fully attended to.\n\nAdditionally, a **decree was issued** (降诰), bestowing upon him the title **Bǎozhēn Guàn Miàochōnghé Shìjiān** (葆真观妙冲和先生), and ordaining **over ten of his disciples** as **Daoists** (道士). Among them, the most eminent were granted **purple robes** (紫衣) and **titles of Master** (师名) as honors, demonstrating the **highest reverence** (尊礼之甚至).\n\nAfter the Master’s second farewell and return to his mountain, the emperor personally inscribed **several volumes of the Daoist Canon** (道藏经) and painted a **portrait of Lǎozǐ** (老子), presenting them as gifts to honor his departure.\n\nAs the **palace neared completion**, the emperor inscribed upon its **lintel** (膀) the name **Yuánsù Wànníng Gōng** (元符万宁宫), declaring that **\"the celestial script descends upon the rocky valleys\"** (云汉之章下贲岩谷), signifying that **divine beings would henceforth guard it**, enduring **a hundred million years** (垂之亿年), in **harmony with the boundless Dao/Way** (与道无极).\n\nMoreover, he remarked that since the **construction began in the Yuánsù era** (元符) and was completed in the present, the name was retained and **augmented** (增之) to **manifest the intent of continuing the legacy and documenting deeds** (彰继志述事之意). The **wise and saintly emperors succeeded one another**, perpetuating the **true and flourishing Dao/Way** (绍隆真风). This is what is meant by **\"the completion of one palace, yet two glories arise\"** (一宫之成而二美并焉).\n\nHaving recorded these events, I ensure that **posterity may observe them**, and have further composed a poem in commemoration. The verses are as follows:」\n\n「The Three Teachings of the Jade Sprouts—\nTheir virtue attained from the very first.\n\nTheir **qi** harmonizes with the boundless,\nWith form ascending, together they rise.\n\nWho may emulate their **Dao/Way**?\nMust be serene, must be pure.\n\nLofty and enduring for ages long,\nThen the Master’s **transcendent transformation** (解化) was revealed.\n\nThe Emperor honored him,\nSummoning him to the court with grand ceremony.\n\nHe then met the Master face-to-face,\nFeasting upon his wondrous words.\n\nThe Emperor granted him a sacred decree,\nTo compose hymns for his peers.\n\nWithin the Master’s old humble dwelling,\nThis new abode was opened wide.\n\nImages of the **celestial sages** (仙真),\nReflecting the Emperor’s own reverence.\n\nDivine brushstrokes adorned the beams,\nWhere **dragons and phoenixes** (龙凤) gather in splendor.\n\nThe heavens bestowed upon the Emperor\n**Illustrious wisdom** (聪明), filial piety, and benevolence.\n\nHolding fast to the **central Dao/Way** (抱一用中),\nHe soothed the **Nine Realms** (九有).\n\nNear and far, all followed in unison,\nRevering the **Dao/Way** and flourishing in merit.\n\nIf one seeks to attain this,\nLet it be within this palace.\n\nA fine song was composed,\nTo proclaim its glory without end.\n\nWhen the Emperor finished the new palace,\nHe personally inscribed its record upon the lintel\nAnd granted a stone stele.\n\nHis sacred brush and divine artistry,\nExceeding all ancient masters,\n**Dragon script and phoenix calligraphy** (龙章凤书),\nIlluminating the secret halls.\n\nLater, he issued an imperial command,\nFilling it with gold,\nThus safeguarding the sacred treasures,\nForever as a jewel of this palace,\nAnd also to show that they should not be passed on to the common people.\n\nYour servant, **Jìngzhī** (净之), humbly witnessed\nThe Emperor’s gracious fulfillment of the Master’s earlier intentions,\nAnd the adornment of this grand structure—\nHis favor is most profound, his grace most abundant.\n\nThe **record of governance** (资政之记) is expansive and splendid,\nUnfolding the Emperor’s enlightened will—\nIts elegance is most refined, its brilliance most radiant.\n\nIf this were not celebrated,\nHow could the world behold it?\n\nYour servant, ever inheriting the Master’s teachings,\nRepeatedly granted audiences in response to imperial inquiries,\nJoined in the **Green Regret Festival** (绿庆) upon its completion,\nAnd was bestowed with a singular honor—\nThe Emperor’s kindness is boundless, beyond measure,\nAnd your servant has no way to repay it.\nThus, he separately engraved this fine stone,\nTo spread its fame far and wide,\nSo that all within and beyond the distant realms\nMay thoroughly understand the Emperor’s purpose in building this palace,\nThe Master’s **transcendent transformation** (解化),\nAnd purify their hearts and minds to pursue the **true Dao/Way** (真风)—\nThis is your servant’s earnest hope.\n\nIn the **Year of Great Observation** (大观), second month, fifteenth day,\nThe Emperor specially granted **Master Shòuguìjìnghé** (守静凝和法师),\nThe **Twenty-sixth Generation Successor of the Upper Clarity Scripture** (上清经录二十六代嗣教宗师),\nAnd the **Resident Abbot** (充住持) of the **Yuánsù Wanníng Palace** (元符万宁宫),\nYour servant, **Jìngzhī** (笞一净之), respectfully inscribed.\n\nIn the **Year of Xīnwèi’s Reign** (咸淳), seventh year,\nThe **Year of the Snake** (岁次辛未), second month’s first day,\nThe Emperor granted **Master Guānwénmiàodà** (观妙大师),\nThe **Forty-second Generation Successor of the Upper Clarity Scripture** (劫差茅山上清经录四十二代嗣教宗师),\nAnd the **Supervisor of the Yuánsù Wanníng Palace** (管辖元符万宁官事),\nYour servant, **Zhái Zhìyǐng** (翟志颖), re-erected the stone.\n\n**The Stele of Master Huàyáng’s Transcendent Transformation** (茅山华阳先生解化之碑)\n\n**Cài Bǎn** (蔡卞), a scholar of the **Observation of Literature Hall** (观文殿学士),\nA **Golden Ranked Minister of Light** (金紫光禄大夫),\nThe **Overseer of Bózhōu Tàiqīng Palace** (提举亳州太清宫),\nThe **First Column General of Nányáng County** (上柱国南阳郡开国公),\nWith **fiefdom lands of four thousand three hundred households** (食邑四千三百户),\nAnd **actual封 lands of one thousand one hundred households** (食实封一千一百户),\nRespectfully inscribed this stele on the Emperor’s command.\n\nIn the spring of the **Year of Great Observation** (大观), second year,\nThe Emperor decreed that **Master Huàyáng** (华阳先生) come to court in the capital.\n\nOn the fourth month, **Dīnghài Day** (丁亥), the Master arrived from **Máoshān** (茅山).\nThe Emperor ordered **two hundred Daoist priests** (道士) to prepare solemn rituals for his welcome,\nAnd lodged him in the **Upper Clarity Palace** (上清储祥宫), newly constructed as a **Yuánsù side hall** (新作元符之别观).\n\nThe Master fell ill,\nAnd could not attend court.\nThe Emperor’s envoys for inquiry and care never ceased on the road.\n\nOn the tenth of that month,\nThe imperial carriage visited the **Reserved Auspicious Palace** (储祥宫),\nWhere the Emperor summoned the Master for an audience,\nAnd conversed with him for a long time.\n\nThe two nights prior,\nThe Master dreamed of serving the **Celestial Sovereign** (天帝),\nDiscussing and expounding upon the *Great Cavern True Scripture* (《大洞真经》),\nAnd upon waking, he marveled at it.\n\nWhen he met the Emperor,\nHe presented the *Great Cavern Scripture* (《大洞经》), which he had always treasured.\nThe Emperor, upon viewing it, was moved and exclaimed:\n*\"I have just finished copying this scripture while keeping a strict fast,\nAnd personally painted the images of the Three Jade Sprouts Sages (三茅真君),\nIntending to bestow them upon you, the Master.*\n\nThat very day,\nHe granted both the scripture and the images to him.\n\nAfter the Master received the scripture,\nHis thoughts aligned with the Emperor’s,\nAnd he was filled with joy and relief.\n\nThe Imperial carriage was about to return to the palace,\nYet the Emperor summoned the Master again,\nAnd treated him with extraordinary kindness and care.\n\nSeven days later, on a **Ding-you** (丁酉) day,\nWhen the officials reported that the Master had departed in transcendence,\nThe Emperor was deeply shaken and grieved.\nHe ordered the imperial attendants to grant a **golden funeral tent** (金营丧),\nAnd specially bestowed the title **Grand Minister of the Middle Office** (太中大夫),\nCommanding **officials to escort his coffin back** (使－使护其柩以还).\n\nWhen the burial date was set,\nThe Emperor decreed that the subject **Coen** (臣卞) should compose an epitaph,\nSo that his fame would endure indefinitely.\n\nUpon receiving the command,\nI humbly reflected that the ancients who attained **perfect virtue** (全德),\nRooted themselves in the **Dao/Way** (道),\nAnd though they relied on material means,\nThey never lacked,\nFor their worth lay within themselves.\nThough they followed others,\nThey never lost their true essence.\nThus, their actions were as natural as drinking,\nAnd there was no moment when they were not in perfect harmony.\n\nBut in later times,\nThose who merely bent to **one-sided Daoist practices** (一曲之士)\nKnew only how to serve themselves,\nAnd their flaw led them to **sever ties with the world** (绝物),\nEmbrace emptiness, and guard stillness,\nDying in obscurity within caves and mountain hollows,\nBelieving they had attained the **Dao/Way**,\nYet their **virtue/power** (德) never benefited others,\nAnd their **Dao/Way** never spread in the world.\nThey began with self-cultivation,\nBut the means by which they sought it were truly few,\nHence the criticism of the ancient hermits:\n*\"They went away but never returned.\"*\n\nYet **Master Hua Yang** (华阳先生) was different.\nWhen he dwelled in the **deep mountain valleys of the True** (栖真深峦),\nFew people ventured to his remote borders,\nHe used the **Pure and High Daoist talismans and waters** (上清符水)\nTo heal the illnesses of others,\nAnd the number of those cured was beyond reckoning—\nHis contributions were vast indeed.\n\nThen he encountered the **sage-emperor** (圣上),\nWith his **heaven-endowed great wisdom** (天纵大智),\nHe transformed the **newly enlightened people** (新斯民),\nRooted himself in the **original Dao/Way** (原道真),\nAnd revered the **Dao/Way of benevolence and virtue** (有德),\nSo that year after year,\nHe frequently received imperial commands to construct the **morning court** (造朝),\nWas summoned into the palace halls,\nAnd granted audiences for the entire day.\nThe topics he discussed with the Emperor,\nKneeling close to him,\nOften encompassed the **wondrous principles of the world** (天下妙理).\n\nOnce,\nHe found delight in the **clouds and springs** (云泉),\nBut now,\nHis name is renowned in the imperial court.\nOnce,\nHe lived among **woodcutters and herdsmen** (樵牧),\nBut now,\nHis **Dao/Way** is trusted by **officials and ministers** (官壶).\nAll the **Daoist adepts of the realm** (方士) who hear of his fame,\nTurn to him in harmony,\nHow can he be compared to those **withered, one-sided practitioners** (枯槁一曲之士)!\n\nThe Master’s surname was **Liu** (刘),\nAnd his given name was **Hun Kang** (混康),\nA native of **Jinling, Changzhou** (晋陵人).\n\nHis ancestors never took office,\nBut during the **Chong Ning era** (崇宁中),\nBecause of the Master,\nThe Emperor specially bestowed upon his father the title **Guardian of Virtue and Promoter of Benevolence** (守真宣德郎),\nAnd upon his mother, **Lady Zhu of Penglai County** (蓬莱县太君).\n\nIn his youth,\nThe Master was **ethereal and detached** (虚澹),\nNot inclined to worldly affairs.\nDuring the reign of **Emperor Ren Zong** (仁宗),\nHe took the **Daoist scripture examination** (试经) and became a **Daoist priest** (道士),\nFree from worldly concerns,\nDaily perusing **Daoist texts** (道书),\nYet his **heart alone grasped the profound truths of the *Great Cavern Scripture*** (洞经妙旨).\n\nTroubled by the absence of a **clear Daoist teacher** (明师) in the world,\nHe let his hair grow wild,\nAscended the **lecture platform** (登坛),\nAnd took the **heavenly Dao/Way** (天) as his master.\n\nLater,\nHe heard of **Master Mao, the Three Jade Sprouts Sages’ disciple** (三茅道士毛奉柔),\nWho was renowned for his **Daoist practice** (道行),\nAnd whose fame spread across the age,\nSo he went to seek him out.\n\nMaster Mao,\nUpon seeing him,\nRecognized his extraordinary nature,\nAnd imparted to him all the **records of the *Great Cavern Scripture*** (大洞经录).\n\nAfterward,\nHe built a **hermitage** (结庵) on **Ji Jin Peak** (积金峰).\nOn the day he settled there,\nThree **feathered immortals** (三羽人) appeared,\nNo one knew from where they came,\nAnd they all visited his dwelling.\nThey quickly pointed to the **bounded corner of the hermitage** (束隅) and said:\n*\"You should reside here.\nEmbrace the **Divine** (神) and guard the **center** (中),\nAnd your **virtue/power** (德) and benevolence will extend to others—\nYou will then have no cause to feel shame before the ancients.\"*\n\nThey then looked at the Master’s forehead and said:\n*\"This is a place of **no artificiality** (无作),\nWhere the **Dao/Way** is held in highest esteem.\nIt cannot be marred by defects.\"*\nWith their hands,\nThey touched his brow.\n\nThe next day, the scar vanished and was never seen again.\nYet when he sought the so-called Three Feathered Immortals, he could never find them.\n\nThe Master then devoted himself with earnest diligence,\nAnd in his dealings with others and benefiting people,\nHis efforts never waned—\nNear and far, all revered and followed him.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Zhezong,\nHe was summoned to the capital,\nAnd was granted the title *Dongyuan Tongmiao Dashī* (洞元通妙大师).\nHis hermitage was renamed *Yuanshu Guan* (元符观).\n\nNot long after,\nHe paid a visit to the court and returned to his mountain.\nIn the first year of Emperor Huizong’s reign,\nHe was again summoned to the capital,\nAnd the following year, he was permitted to return,\nReceiving the *Nine Elders’ Xiandu Jun* jade seal.\nThe emperor also ordered the expansion of his halls,\nAnd commanded attendants to oversee the work,\nGranting him full authority in the capital.\n\nSoon after,\nA decree was issued,\nAnd he was granted the title *Baozhen Guanmiao Xiansheng* (葆真观妹先生).\n\nThough dwelling in the mountains,\nHis hands never ceased from labor and inquiry—\nNo month passed without effort.\nWhen the observatory neared completion,\nHe petitioned to visit the imperial court to repay the emperor’s grace.\nThe emperor, in turn, exhorted and encouraged him to come,\nAnd summoned him to the *Xuanhe Hall* for an audience,\nGranting imperial calligraphy and paintings.\nThus, the observatory’s name was expanded to *Yuanshu Wan’ning Gong* (元符万宁宫),\nAnd its main gate, along with the *Jingming Wannian* (景命万年),\n*Tianning Wanfu* (天宁万福) halls,\nAnd the *Taiping Feitian Law Wheel* pavilion,\nWere all inscribed by the emperor’s own hand.\nHis virtuous deeds shone brightly through the ages.\n\nThe solemnity of the Three Teachings’ reverence\nHad never been so grand as in this time.\n\nThe following summer, in the fourth month,\nThe Master again requested leave to return,\nAnd the emperor bestowed the name *Gangshen* (港神) upon his hermitage,\nAdding the characters *Chonghe* (冲和) to his title.\nAfter several months,\nHe composed the *Regong Ode* (庆成颂),\nAnd the emperor granted him a poem of farewell as an honor.\n\nWhen the *Daoguang* era began,\nThe emperor repeatedly summoned him,\nBut the Master firmly declined,\nAnd permission was granted.\n\nThus, an edict was issued,\nCommanding his senior disciple, *Shoujing Ninghe Shifu* (守静凝和法师),\nTo attend in his place,\nTo convey his virtue and intentions.\n\nThe following year,\nThe Master came to the capital.\nThe day before his departure,\nThe crane he had kept in his hermitage suddenly flew away.\nThe Master, upon hearing this, sighed:\n*\"The crane departs—\nPerhaps I shall not return.\"*\n\nAnd indeed, he died in the capital.\n\nThat very year, on the seventh month’s *Renshen* day (壬申),\nHe was buried on *Dieyu Peak* (迭玉峰) to the south of the mountain.\nAn imperial decree posthumously honored him as *Jingyi* (静一),\nAnd his tomb’s shrine was named *Cangzhen Guan* (藏真观).\n\nThe Master refined his *qi* to attain softness,\nAnd did not align with the nature of things.\nHis essence was profound and pure, like clouds in motion—\nHis stillness and activity were both harmonious.\nFrom beginning to end, his reputation and honor were exalted—\nWorthy of inscription.\n\n**Inscription:**\n*Mang!*—the Dao’s origin,\nBefore anything existed.\nSeeking it through *qi*,\nIt already sprouted like seedlings.\nThose who attained it in antiquity\nWere its pioneers.\nLater, in the depths of obscurity,\nIts transmission ceased.\nMuddled and sticky, the path shifted.\nForms appeared chaotic,\nWhile the heart followed in unison.\nHow to transform it?\nAwait stillness, await emptiness.\n\nTruly, the Master,\nWalked with the ancients,\nGuarding pure *qi*,\nWith no schemes or pursuits.\nWhen the emperor summoned him to court,\nHe came with grace,\nDaring to declare what he had heard—\nHis wisdom penetrated *wuwei* (无为).\nHis lofty name was renowned,\nAnd he took joy in mountain seclusion,\nRiding the transformations to their end—\nHis form was thus.\n\nHis talent was vast, his Dao complete—\nA request for posterity.\n\nThe Master, favored by the sage emperor,\nReceived grace and honor from beginning to end—\nAs seen in the founding of *Cangzhen Guan*,\nUnprecedented in history.\n\nThe emperor commanded artisans to depict his transformations,\nAnd personally inscribed the hall’s name as a gift.\n\nThe monumental stele, inscribed with gold leaf, was difficult to replicate,\nSo it was carefully recarved and widely distributed.\n\nOn the seventeenth day of the fourth month, *Zhenghe* era (政和元年),\nA disciple of the *Upper Clarity Three Teachings*,\nThe twenty-sixth-generation *Shoujing Ninghe Shifu* (守静凝和法师),\nZhu Jingzhi (竺净之),\nHumbly inscribed this.\n\n**Holding the Imperial Seal in Changzhou’s Military Affairs**,\n**Governor of Changzhou**,\n**Defender of the State in Changzhou**,\n**Count of Wen Shui** (食邑五百户),\n**With a real fief of one hundred households** (食实封一百户),\n**Upper Pillar King** (上柱国王),\n**Planting the Stele** (植篆额),\n\n**Imperial Uncle, Military Governor of Wuan** (武安军节度),\n**Inspector of Tangzhou’s Internal Affairs** (潭州管内观察处置等使),\n**Holding the rank of Chancellor** (检校司空),\n**Equivalent to the Three Departments** (开府仪同三司),\n**Holding the Imperial Seal in Tangzhou’s Military Affairs** (持节潭州诸军事),\n**Governor of Tangzhou** (潭州刺史),\n**Upper Pillar King of Huayuan** (华原郡王),\n**With a fief of nine thousand households** (食邑九千户),\n**And a real fief of two thousand four hundred households** (食实封二千四百户),\n**Zhongyu Li** (仲御) **erected this stele.**\n\n**Inscription of the Two Memorial Tablets Left by Chongyin Master** (冲隐先生遗表碑二通)\n\nYour subject, Jingzhi, humbly presents a memorial to the Emperor:\n\nSince departing the imperial court,\nI have endured many months and years,\nYearning to behold Your Majesty’s face,\nAnd longing to return to the mountains once more.\nAlas, my fate is limited—\nMy wishes and resolve have failed,\nAnd I have let down the imperial court.\nThis grief is unbearable.\n\nYet though my worldly ties are shallow,\nMy path to immortality is divergent—\nHow dare I forget Your Majesty’s enduring favor?\nI humbly pray that you may\nStrengthen the foundations of the state\nAnd preserve Your Majesty’s health,\nThus repaying the heavens’ blessings in this precious era,\nAnd fulfilling the hopes of the people.\n\nYour subject, with no other desire than to gaze upon Your Majesty,\nHumbly presents this memorial.\n\nOn the second day of the seventh month, *Zhenghe* era (政和三年),\nA disciple of the *Teachings of Maoshan*,\nThe twenty-sixth-generation *Shoujing Ninghe Shifu* (守静凝和法师),\nZhu Jingzhi (竺净之),\nHolding the position of *Head Abbot of Yuanshu Wan’ning Gong* (充住持元符万宁宫),\nHumbly presents this memorial.\n\nYour subject, reflecting on his own insignificance and ignorance,\nSince the Master first encountered Your Majesty,\nHas seen the construction of temples and the propagation of teachings.\nYet my requests have been excessive,\nOverstepping the bounds of propriety,\nAnd my crimes are unforgivable.\n\nI had only hoped to exhaust my service like a dog or horse,\nTo repay even a fraction of the grace bestowed.\nYet I fell ill with a spleen ailment,\nAnd my appetite vanished.\nThough I struggled with medicine,\nThere was no improvement.\nRecently, after performing rituals to pray for divine mercy,\nI received a response—\nAnd now must depart this world.\n\nThe logic of departure and remaining\nI accept without regret,\nBut I grieve that I must forever part from Your Majesty,\nAnd can no longer behold Your face,\nNor bid farewell to the empress and the princes—\nThis sorrow is beyond measure.\n\nYour Majesty’s wisdom and sagacity,\nYour reverence for the Dao and virtue,\nAre unmatched by any ancient emperor.\n\nYet reflecting upon the Dao of emperors and rulers—\nit differs from that of common subjects.\nEvery word and deed, if aligned with Heaven’s will,\nbrings blessings to all under the heavens.\n\nMay Your Majesty not be swayed by superficial splendor,\nlest it undermine the sacred traditions.\nThe *Tai Shang Kan Ying Ping* of five thousand words\nprioritizes frugality, simplicity, and benevolence—\na guiding treasure and the bridge to attaining the Dao.\nI humbly pray Your Majesty may preserve Your sacred person\nby purifying the heart and curbing desires,\nstrengthen the nation’s foundation through moderation in wealth,\nand broaden the path of counsel by heeding loyal ministers.\nThe realm would be most fortunate.\n\nThough my wisdom is meager, I dare not presume to risk my life\nin offering these words.\nYet I recall my master’s solemn charge,\nwho bade me prioritize loyalty and service to the state.\nAt this critical juncture, if I fail to speak even a word\nto aid Your Majesty’s virtue,\nI would betray Heaven, betray my master,\nand carry my regret to the grave.\n\nI have already entrusted the *Zongfa Luju* scrolls,\nthe *True Scripture* seals, and Your Majesty’s\nprevious and later gifts of calligraphy and paintings\nto my disciple, Yu Xiyin, for safekeeping.\nI further pray Your Majesty, in remembrance of my master’s\ndevotion to teaching and propagating the Dao,\nmay extend Your grace and protection to our lineage,\nso that even if I never again behold Your face,\nmy death will be without regret.\n\nAs I pen these words, my sorrow deepens.\nI, a loyal subject, have spoken again—\n**Eulogy for Master Chongyin**\nComposed and inscribed by the humble servant Cai Bian,\n*Jianjia Shaobo, Zhengdong Jun Jiedu Shi, Kaifu Yitong Sansi,\nTaiyi Guan Shi* concurrently serving as *Shiren Xiuguo Shi*.\n\nMaster Chongyin’s given name was Jingzhi,\nwith the courtesy name Qingyuan,\na native of Jining.\n\nHis father, Deyi, was a man of idle youth\nwho later took to Daoist arts,\nearning the nickname *Chi Yi* Old Man among his neighbors.\nA Daoist from Yuhang, who concealed his true name,\noften visited him.\n\nWhen Master Chongyin was still in the womb,\none day, his father rose early and saw the Daoist enter their home,\nonly to vanish moments later—\na strange occurrence that filled him with wonder.\nSoon after, Master Chongyin was born.\n\nFrom birth, he was pure and unadorned,\nwith profound insight and discernment.\nAs a child, he abstained from meat,\nand by age six or seven, recited hundreds of words daily.\nWhile playing with grasshoppers, he would sketch Daoist figures on the ground.\n\nHis father took him to Mount Mao.\nAt the time, Master Jingyi Liu Hunkang had secluded himself on Jijin Peak,\nand upon seeing him, declared:\n*“This child will one day become a Celestial Master.”*\nHe taught him the *Qingju* methods,\nand Master Chongyin leapt with joy, vowing to stay as his disciple\nand never return home—\nhis father, delighted, agreed.\n\nHe served diligently at his master’s side for years.\nWhen Wang Anshi resided in Jining,\nhe heard of Master Jingyi’s virtuous conduct,\nsent a letter with gifts to invite him.\nMaster Chongyin carried his staff and sandals to meet him,\nand in their conversation, his words always struck the essence.\nWang Anshi repeatedly praised him.\n\nDuring the Yuanyou era,\nwhen I governed Xuancheng,\nMaster Jingyi sent Master Chongyin with a letter.\nI lodged him in the western chamber of my rear garden,\nwhere fragrant fruits hung before him.\nThough the garden boasted layered pavilions and towering trees,\noverlooking the city and stretching for a hundred *li*,\nMaster Chongyin sat in silence all day, never leaving his room—\nI marveled at this, and so I initiated him into Daoist ranks.\n\nHis resolve grew ever deeper,\nand Master Jingyi entrusted him with the *San Dong* scriptures.\nHe inscribed talismans to heal ailments and dispel malevolence,\nand his methods were often verified.\n\nOver the years, he mastered his teacher’s entire Dao,\nretiring to the secluded mountains,\nyet his reputation spread swiftly in his time.\n\nWhen Emperor Zhezong ruled with benevolence,\nseeking Daoist sages to protect the realm,\nhe first summoned Master Jingyi to the capital.\nWhen Master Chongyin entered the court with him,\nthe emperor studied his appearance with interest\nand bestowed upon him the title of *Shi* as an honor.\n\nAt the start of the Yuanshu era,\nhe was granted his residence as an observatory,\nnamed *Yuanshu Guan*.\nWhen the present emperor personally embodied the Dao\nto govern the lands,\nhe commanded me to urgently invite Master Jingyi to court,\nforbidding any refusal.\n\nMaster Chongyin accompanied him,\nand the honors bestowed upon him were extraordinary.\nThe officials were ordered to enlarge his nameplate,\nand the emperor himself inscribed his title as a gift,\nfurther bestowing upon him the title *Guardian of the Dao* (*Shoujing Fashi*)\nand appointing him as the abbot.\n\nThe following year, he was summoned again to court,\nand when he presented himself, his disciples who accompanied him\nwere also granted favors.\n\nAfter some time, he requested permission to return to the mountains,\nand was further honored with the title *Ninghe*,\nalong with imperial calligraphy and paintings as parting gifts.\n\nIn the fourth year of the *Daguan* era,\nhe returned from Mount Mao,\nand the emperor commanded that an altar be erected at his lodging,\nso he might expound his teachings to the scholars.\nA court official was dispatched to oversee the matter,\nand many officials and scholars attended to receive his instruction.\nHe again firmly declined and returned to the mountains.\nThe emperor then gave him imperial calligraphy and a painted portrait of Master Jingyi.\n\nPreviously, the *Jiuyou Huanglu* had long been neglected,\nand few practiced the Dao.\nMaster Chongyin revived it,\nand the rituals of the two *Ke* systems flourished in his time.\n\nWhenever disciples resided in remote, inaccessible mountains,\nif heavy rains or snow blocked the paths,\nMaster Chongyin would urgently bring them supplies.\nIn years of famine, he would divert the taxes from his fields\nto feed the hungry with millet gruel.\nIf a captive or prisoner passed by, he would clothe and feed them.\n\nAfter several years, one day he gathered his disciples\nand said:\n*“I am now forty-six years old.\nMy master once recorded that my lifespan would not exceed this.\nI am departing.”*\nThough he bore the nation’s heavy gratitude,\nhe could not face the emperor in person,\nso he took up his brush to draft a farewell memorial.\n\nThe next day, he bathed, donned his robes,\nand passed away—\non the third day of the seventh month, *Zhonghe* era.\n\nWhen the memorial reached the emperor,\nhe mourned deeply and posthumously bestowed upon him\nthe title *Chongyin Master*,\ngranting him official honors.\n\nIn the eleventh month of that year,\nhis remains were interred beneath Huagai Peak,\non the southern slope of the Great Mao Peak.\nHis disciples numbered over forty,\nwith Fu Xilie and Xu Xihe as the foremost.\n\n「Hishuo served as Master Yangsu, succeeding in residence and governance,\nwhile Hilie was summoned to serve as the *Right Street* Chief **□** Overseer.\n\nThree years later, the emperor posthumously bestowed upon the master’s father\nthe title *Attendant Officer*,\nand upon his mother, Lady Zhou, the title *Naipin Lady*.\n\nIndeed, since the master’s youth,\nI had already known him.\nWhen he neared his end,\nhe also sent word to me,\nsaying: *“My farewell memorial is finished,\nand the appointed time has come—\nI cannot write even a few words to bid farewell.”*\n\nSeveral years after his burial,\nthere came an imperial decree,\ncommanding me to compose an epitaph for him.\nThe epitaph reads:\n\n*\"To grasp the truth of the Dao,\none must abandon one’s form.\nAt first, I attained it—\nascending into the Supreme Clarity,\nmy heart sought only the One.\nIn my early years, I cared for nothing,\ndwelling in a hut upon the mountain’s peak,\nuntil I reached Master Cheng.\nWho shall succeed him?\nTruly, it is Master Yang.*\n\n*The emperor praised this,\noffered him a title of merit,\nand summoned me to speak before him.\nMy words flowed freely and clearly.*\n\n*Though his form has passed,\nhis spirit ever ascends—\nthe remaining threads of his teachings,\nare recorded in this very epitaph.\"*\n\n**Recorded at the Doubting-God Hall of Huagai Peak**\n*Mount Jiuqu, the sacred domain of the Three Teachings,*\n*its divine halls and towering structures,*\n*soaring and resplendent,*\n*outshine all of Jiangzuo’s thousands of leagues.*\n\nThe **Fusion-of-Spirit Hall** lies within,\nits groves and caves concealed,\nits **qi** profound and steady—\na fitting abode for lofty recluses and free-spirited sages.\n\nIn the *Genghai* year of the *Shaoxing* era,\nthe temple’s officiant, Daoist Zhang Zhen of the *Mao* Peak,\nwith his disciples, dwelt beneath the central peak,\nbuilt a hermitage on Mount Mao,\ncasting aside worldly distractions,\nnurturing the spirit and preserving its radiance,\nas a wanderer beyond all things.\n\nHis nature was true and inwardly harmonious,\nhis Dao rich and outwardly abundant—\nhis refined essence stood firm as the mountain,\nhis spiritual prowess rose pure as jade.\nGazing upon him,\none saw truly a man from the **Penglai** Immortal Isles or the **Fanghu** Cauldron.\n\nScholars gradually flocked to him.\nHis fame reached the imperial ear,\nand by decree, he was summoned to court.\nYet, though spoken to,\nhe remained silent, unable to reply.»\n\nThe emperor, upon seeing him, bestowed great favor and labored to honor him, removing his own imperial robes to bestow them, and further commanding that his likeness be painted in the **Divine Immortal Hall**. Yet Zhang Zhen firmly requested to return to the mountain.\n\nThe master, rising from obscurity, gained recognition from the sage-emperor. Over six times he came to the imperial court—once in the *Rénwǔ* year to inspect the troops, and again summoned to the traveling palace for an audience, each time receiving ever-greater honors.\n\nInitially, the **Empress Dowager** wished to transform his hermitage into a grand observatory, but Zhang Zhen declined, stating that such a title would bring official burdens, unsuited to his secluded life. Thus, only the current name was bestowed in the sixth month of the *Yǐhài* year.\n\nIn the *Gēngchén* year, the **Three Pure Ones Hall** was constructed, with statues and ritual furnishings all crafted by imperial artisans. Later, a silver-funded **Heavenly Auspicious Pavilion** was granted as a traveling palace, enshrining imperial calligraphy, and a tiered pavilion was built to house a bell from the inner treasury. Its radiance descended like clouds upon the earth, its sacred vessels warding off spirits, and celestial guardians standing watch. Over two decades of imperial bestowals, all funds were devoted to halls and shrines, granaries and kitchens—each in proper order, neither extravagant nor meager, their designs precise and harmonious.\n\nIn the *Buqian* year of the *Jiāndào* era, three hundred and thirty *mǔ* of land were granted, with the tax exemption for the *Hángzhōu* and *Zhè* regions—his virtue was indeed profound.\n\nHis dwellings, high and low, followed the mountain’s contours, fitting yet secluded, neither hidden nor exposed. The **White Cloud Peak** embraced his left, the **Small Peak** bowed to his right, while **Red Mountain** cradled him in front, the **Great Luo Spring** stretching far before him, and the **Ascension Peak** visible in the distance. Purple and emerald hues encircled him, the four mountains like screens, morning light dappled and shifting, while evening breezes carried the pure, round tones of the *qín*—as if severed from the world of dust.\n\nA humble man yet able to move the emperor’s lofty ears, to enjoy the supreme delights of mountain and forest—truly, he must have possessed such virtue!\n\nAh! The teachings of the **Old Sage** and **Buddha** stand alongside Confucius, their doctrines clashing and converging in later ages. The **True Person** harmonizes the Three into One, governing with rectitude and facing south in authority, while Confucian learning spreads across the land, laws refined, music and rites flourishing. The two traditions support it, guiding the people’s hearts toward goodness. Through gradual cultivation, customs grow pure and thick, wars cease, punishments abandoned, and the realm ascends toward the domain of **Ren and Longevity**—how could this not be his contribution?\n\nDuring their audiences, Zhang Zhen spoke little, yet his words on **Daoist adepts’ deceit** and the **principles of governance through stillness**—what choice did the emperor have but to heed them? Heaven itself must have listened.\n\nThat he could move the emperor’s ears and enjoy such bliss—how fitting!\n\nThe master hailed from **Jìnlíng**, **Chángzhōu**. In his youth, he bore the name **Yì** and the virtue-name **Dádào**, later taking the Daoist precept and adopting his present name, though the world still knew him by his virtue-name.\n\nNine years after his passing, the hermitage’s disciple **Máo Jiàn**—who once shared a day’s intimacy with the master and, with his brother **Wáng Jiànzhì**, wandered the **Jīngxī** streams for forty years—entrusted me to record this account. Thus, I have gathered only the hermitage’s latter days, linking them to its founding, and inscribed this.\n\nHis honors from the two palaces, his glory and favor, would warrant a full chronicle—yet to dwell on such singular grace, I omit it here.\n\nRecorded and inscribed by **Lǐ Chǔquán**, *Cháosàn Dàfū*, newly commissioned to oversee **Chǔzhōu Military Prefecture**, on the first day of the ninth month, *Chúnxī* 10.\n\n**Record of the Transmission to Empress Jiādìng**\n\nThe Emperor, of wondrous and divine virtue, pierced the Great Dao and inherited the Mandate. Within the Four Seas, both near and far, all was tranquil and without strife.\n\nThe Empress harmonized with the **Kūn** (Earthly) Principle, her radiance rivaling the sun and moon. She wove the Emperor’s virtue, assisted in the transformation of the world, and as his inner helpmate, she remained in leisure, cherishing the Dao and cultivating stillness, her heart pure and white.\n\nOn the **Jīadìng Rénwǔ** (Regency) year of **Gēngwǔ** (1200), the Emperor commanded **Yìchén Shàngguān Déqīn**, Left Street Overseer, to seal a black jade tablet with imperial edict, solemnly conveying the decree to follow the precedent of **Chángxiàn Míngsù Empress**, and proceed to **Huáyáng Dòngtiān**, the **Shàngqīng Zōngtán** (Supreme Purity Altar), to receive the **Dàdòng Bìfǎ Bǎolù** (Great Cavern’s Secret Law Transmission Scroll), the **Jīnlóng Yùbì** (Golden Dragon Jade Tablet), and the **zhìxìn lǐyí** (sincere ritual observances)—all without omission.\n\nThe **Shàngqīng Jīnglù Zōngshī** (Supreme Purity Scripture Transmission Master), **Xué Rǔjǐ**, presided over the altar and transmitted the precepts.\n\nI, **Rǔjǐ**, reverently obeyed the imperial command, purified my body and mind, and with sincere devotion, journeyed to **Nányuè** (Southern Peak), focusing my thoughts on the **Shànglíng** (Supreme Spirit). I established the **Yùlù Dàochǎng** (Jade Register Ritual Ground) and the **Luótiān Dàjiào** (Celestial Net Great Offering), broadly conducting fasts and sacrifices, summoning the **Yǔyī** (Feathered Robes).\n\nThat night, the **Yùguǒ Jīnbō** (Jade Strings and Golden Waves) shimmered, their luminous traces lingering like the Han dynasty’s celestial apparitions. Auspicious omens and sacred mists filled the palace courts in abundance.\n\nThe following day, **shēnghé** (mythical birds) soared and danced in celestial display, while **língzhī** (sacred mushrooms) and rare grasses sprouted in the bright groves. All who came from afar to witness were moved to reverence and awe—how splendid and resplendent!\n\nI, **Xiānjué** (Prior Awakening), once of humble station, was graced by **Emperor Xiàozōng** with the favor of returning to the mountains. I wandered with **Rǔjǐ**, witnessing these grand events, my joy unbounded.\n\nIn examining the transmission of these scriptures from antiquity, seeking where their lineage persists, their grandeur is sublime and ineffable—truly the bridge to the Dao and the path to transcendence. As for their radiance and propagation, entrusted to emperors and empresses, that they might align with Heaven and embody the Dao, the splendor of our dynasty surpasses even the past.\n\nThe **qi** congealed in the Nine Heavens, forming naturally of its own accord; the **fire** refined the boundless void, and the imperial hand recorded it—thus did this **Bǎolù** (Precious Scroll) originate.\n\nThe **Tàipíng Xiàjiào** (Great Peace Edict) descended, bestowed by the **Xiǎoyǒu Tiānwáng** (Lesser Heavenly Sovereign), the **Zǐxū Yuánjūn** (Purple Void Primordial Lord), spreading among mortals—thus did this **Bǎolù** transmit.\n\nWhen the **Yuánjūn** first descended to **Jùqū** (Sentence Bend), he commanded **Yáng Xí** to inscribe its text in ancient script. The **Shàngqīng Xiānxiū Xù Jiànbǎo** (Supreme Purity Immortal Xu’s Sword Treasure) was passed down in a **Lánghán** (Lantern Case) with **fèngluó jīnniǔ** (phoenix-woven golden buttons), its solemn oaths and covenants weighty. Those who received it inscribed their names on **jīnjiǎn** (golden tablets) from the **Zìzài Dāntái** (Self-Soaring Celestial Terrace). Unless one was destined, they would not belong to this lineage.\n\nAcross the dynasties, emperors and empresses revered and upheld it, using it to prolong the imperial lineage and extend their years. Its blessings were as certain as the drum responding to the rod—yet even this could not fully reveal its grandeur.\n\nFrom the **Yuánjūn**, twenty-two generations passed to **Guānmiào Xiānshēng Zhū Zìyīng**, who became the **Chángxiàn Míngsù Empress’s** altar master.\n\nTwo more generations brought it to **Chōnghé Xiānshēng Liú Húnkāng**, during the **Xuānhé** era. Emperor **Huìzōng** commanded him to compile the **Sāndòng Sìfǔ** (Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries), making him the **Mèngchuán** (Oath Transmission) Master, and bestowed a white jade seal to continue the **Zōngtán** (Altar Lineage).\n\nNine generations later, it reached me, **Rǔjǐ**, who once again was graced by the Holy Empress, humbly accepting her exalted trust. I augmented the **Jīnglù**, and thus the Dao grew ever more luminous, its propagation ever more vast.\n\nThe sacred lineage of imperial descendants, generation upon generation, never forgot the Dao’s transformation, ascending to **Rénshòu** (Human Longevity). This is a fortune encountered once in a thousand ages, unmatched beneath the heavens.\n\nHeaven sent its omens, Earth did not hoard its treasures—yet this scarcely reveals how Heaven favored our Holy Empress, that for ten thousand years she might share the Emperor’s glory, becoming the Mother of All Under Heaven. This was the **Jiāngjīng Sānjìng** (Three Celestial Precincts’ descent), the **Liúguāng Shíjí** (Ten Extremes of Radiance), entrusted to her—was it not so?\n\nIn reverence for the Empress, Your Highness, whose wisdom and benevolence shine like Heaven’s decree, whose divine grace grows ever brighter—when the hundred spirits bestow their blessings and auspicious **qi** fills the sky, the nation’s sacred calendar has passed its term, and its fragrance endures for all generations.\n\nI dare not remain silent and thus humbly record this, merely chronicling the beginning and end without presuming to compose.\n\n**Jiādìng** **Sānnián** (1203), **Gēngwǔ** year, the sixteenth day of the fifth month. **Yòujiē Dàolù Níngshén Zhāi Gāoshì** (Right Street Daoist Registrar of Concentrated Spirit), **Liú Xiānjué**, with hands clasped and head bowed, respectfully records this.\n\n**Líntán Bǎojiù Shī** (Altar Guardian and Recommender), **Tàishàng Língbǎo Wúshàng Dòngxuán Fǎshī** (Supreme Sacred Treasure of the Highest Cavern), **Yuánfú Wànníng Gōng Zhīguān** (Official of the Ten-Thousand-Nurturing Palace), **Chōngmiào Dàshī** (Master of Supreme Harmony), **Rén Yuánfù**, **Jiāndù Shī** (Degree Master), **Máo Shān Jīngqiān Sìshísì Dài Sìjiào Zōngshī** (Thirty-Fourth Generation Successor-Teacher of the Teachings from Máo Mountain Scripture Signet), **Shàngqīng Sāndòng Fǎshī** (Supreme Purity Three Caverns Master), **Guǎnxiá Yuánfú Wànníng Guān Míngyī Dàshī** (Master of the Ten-Thousand-Nurturing Palace), **Cìzǐ** (Purple Robe), **Xué Rǔjǐ**, **Chéngyì Láng** (Attendant of the Imperial Council), **Zhī Jiànkāng Fǔ Jùróng Xiànshì** (Magistrate of Jùróng County, Jiànkāng Prefecture), **Jiānguǎn Nèi Cuànnóng Yíngtián Gōngshì** (Overseeing Internal Encouragement of Agriculture and Farming), **Zhū Gǒng**, together inscribed this.\n\n---\n**Record of the White Cloud Chongfu Observatory**\n\n**Huīyuán Gé Xuéshì** (Scholar of the Splendid Designs Hall), **Zhèngyì Dàfū** (Honorable Official of Correctness), **Tízhǔ Yòushén Guān** (Overseer of the Auspicious Spirit Observatory), concurrently **Tàizǐ Jiànshì** (Grand Tutor to the Heir Apparent), **Jiānguǎn Guóshǐ** (Overseeing National Histories), **Jiānguān Shílù Yuàn Xiūzhuàn** (Concurrent Compiler of the Veritable Records), **Dài Xī** (of the Dai Stream), composed this.\n\n**Jùqū** (Sentence Bend), a renowned mountain on the **Jiāngnán** (Southern River) side, a **Dòngtiān Fúdì** (Celestial Cavern, Auspicious Land), where **Máo Jūn** (Master Máo) hid and ascended—thus it is called **Máoshān**.\n\nThere is the **Jījīnfēng** (Accumulated Gold Peak) facing west, and from its branch, a ridge rising particularly to the right—**BáiYúnfēng** (White Cloud Peak).\n\nFolklore and Daoist tradition recount that its grasses and trees wither later than others, and its mists and clouds are ever visible. Yet between the two western mountains, the **línggōng** (sacred halls) and **yuèwū** (pavilions) stand where they ought—why has this place remained unmarked? Why awaits it still?\n\nDuring the **Shàoxīng** era, the **Huáyáng Dàoshì Wáng Jǐngwēn** (Huáyáng Daoist Wang Jingwen) hacked through brambles, carved into the cliffs, and built a dwelling at the peak’s base.\n\nWhen Jingwen’s reputation for upright conduct and purity spread, he was granted the honor of inscribing the name *Chóngfú Guān* (Honored Blessing Hall) upon his dwelling, along with endowments of white gold and fertile fields to aid its completion. Thus, the altar platforms were erected, sacred images enshrined, and gateways raised like tripods, pavilions soaring like mist—grand and profound, corridors winding in layered embrace, multi-tiered halls and towering pavilions ascending in cloud-like majesty. A broad path was cleared before them, where pine and cypress marched in orderly ranks, like banners and canopies.\n\nThere was the **Chìshān Lake**, its expanse open and commanding, towering ridges and verdant peaks rising to either side—left and right, bowing in reverence, dense and boundless, their shadows weaving through the clear depths. To dwell or wander there was to escape the tumult, to tread upon the realm of the transcendent.\n\nWithin the **Fānghú Zhàngshì** (Square-Inch Chamber), he personally inscribed his brushstrokes, declaring the virtue of emptiness and stillness. Along with the imperial bestowals of the four dynasties since the Shàoxīng era—treasures, seals, and sacred stones bestowed upon mortals—he awaited one of great virtue and power to stir the winds and clouds, to gather the extraordinary, and thus fulfill his legacy.\n\nNow, his disciples reside here, seeking to honor him, yet only by returning to his original intent.\n\nThe great forests and mountains benefit humanity, yet even the divine cannot overcome them. Still, the Daoists take refuge within them. Those who once practiced the Dao abandoned worldly fame, power, wealth, and desire, focusing solely on refining body, heart, nature, and life—ever fearful of not delving deeply enough. When their practice was complete, they shed their mortal forms in an instant. Yet mortals, clamoring after what was abandoned, clinging to what was cast off, plaster over their traces, ring bells at their hidden depths, and echo their pure and modest virtues, hoping to find such men as before—only to be content with this.\n\nThey feed them, shelter them, adorn their clothing, food, and dwellings as the world does, only to be ensnared once more by fame, power, wealth, and desire. Where then is the Dao?\n\nThis mountain is not merely the legacy of **Máo Yǐn, the Two Xǔs, Yáng Xióng, and Táo Yuánmíng**—its land unchanged, where thatched huts and rustic doors once stood, where meals of mist and bamboo shoots were shared in obscurity, beyond mortal notice. Yet within, the **Dāntái Gǒnggōng** (Dan Platform, Vermilion Palace) and those who embrace jade and pearls remain. Those who open the White Clouds do not confine their legacy to external trappings for their descendants.\n\n**Xī Zhī**, a descendant of the same lineage, frequently traveled through these mountains, familiar with both the landscape and its people. The Daoist **Zhōu Guānfù**, a senior disciple of Jingwen, earnestly sought to record his master’s deeds. He thus commissioned Zhī to arrange his observations, appending his own reflections.\n\nGuānfù returned with this account, sharing it with his disciples, hoping it might serve as a warning, a return to the original path.\n\nRecorded on the **wǎn rì** (full moon) of the ninth month, **Jiādìng** **sìnián** (1211 CE).\n**Dòngyáng Guān Jì** (Record of the Cavern of the East).\n\nThe **Xuān Hé Emperor**, inquiring, learned that the Daoist **Shěn Dòngyuán** refined elixirs, and men knew him only as a divine physician.\n\nWhen **Sìláng Wáng Hànzhī** led troops in **Jīnlíng**, he sought suitable land and went to the south of **Huáyáng**, north of **Sìpíng**, building halls and residences, retaining the old name **Dòngyáng**, and also enshrining his ancestors. For the Daoist scriptures speak of **Dòngyáng** as the **Jūlíng Shēngdù’s** retreat, and it takes its name from its position facing the **Dòngfǔ’s** southern aspect.\n\nWhen **Sīlíng** (Emperor Gaozong) reigned, he annually sent envoys to **Qīngzhēn Guàn** to establish the **Wàn Dào Zhāi** (Ten-Thousand Dao Ritual), and during the fast, cranes would gather in flight—it was on the eighteenth day of the third month that the **Hèhuì** (Crane Assembly) first began here.\n\nIn the early **Chúnxī** era, Dòngyuán’s disciples all dispersed far and wide. **Èchē Wáng Guāngguó** alone upheld his master’s legacy, selecting both land and people. The Daoist **Wáng Jièshū**, clad in hemp and eating coarse grains, oversaw the **Tiānshì Tán** (Celestial Market Altar), and was thus invited to come to **Dòngyáng**. Jièshū’s disciple, **Dīng Dàocún**, together with him, inscribed their Daoist aspirations, attracting scholars from all quarters. Yet the splendor of the **Hèhuì**, lacking imperial favor as in past ages, was no longer held at **Qīngzhēn** but at **Dòngyáng**.\n\nThe **34th-generation patriarch, Xué Jūn Rǔjī**, strengthened the ancestral rites and ancestral tablets, preserving their dignity, and the assembly encouraged virtue without ceasing. The **Huánlíng** magistrate **Táng Qiáonián** donated two **#19** *mǔ* of land to ensure annual offerings, intending to augment his posthumous blessings and repay his native soil.\n\nHis descendants, however, proved unworthy of his merit—his land could not endure, and it was eventually transferred to the **Hóng** family.\n\nThe **Hóng** family had a man of renown named **Bǐngjūn**, tall and virtuous, who was chosen from the four surrounding villages. He abandoned his official post to embrace the **Dao/Way** of true recluses, and thus the local scholars came to regard him as a genuine **hermit** (*zhēnyǐn*).\n\n**Bǐngjūn** understood the origin of the land and so gathered his sons and nephews to propose dividing half of it to support the monks of **Yánqìng**, while the remaining **100 mǔ** he donated to **Dòngyáng**, as if to allow **Táng Qiáonián** to fulfill his long-standing aspirations in the underworld.\n\nAh! **Táng Qiáonián**’s generosity stemmed from his earnest intentions, yet **Bǐngjūn** acted without premeditation—could this have been the foresight of **Zhōufáng**?\n\nWhen the land was again returned to **Dòngyáng**, it was in the year **Gēngyín** of the **Shàodìng** era, and together with his nephews, he fulfilled **Cángshén Dào**’s original aspirations, constructing an **altar hall** (*zhāiliáo*) and commissioning grand inscriptions upon the banners. He also recorded the entire history, ensuring its permanence, and thus made it a lesson for future generations—both virtuous and unworthy descendants.\n\nIn the **Jiāxī** era on **Dīngyòu** day, **Zhāng Tí** of **Nányáng** both composed and inscribed the text, while **Dàn’yáng** **Dīng Zōng Wèi** (a **Chief Librarian** of the **Left Treasury**) inscribed the seal.\n\nThe **Ròu** **Tiān’án** \"Responsive to Heaven\" **Stèle Master** (*Shānrén*) revised the lost text.\nIn the **Yuánfú** era, the **Qínkǒu** \"Qin Mouth\" **Scripture Librarian** (*Jīngcángjì*) recorded the inscription.\n\nThe following texts are omitted from the record:\n\n- *Record of the Rebuilt Huayang Palace* (宋重修华阳宫记), authored by Guō Héng.\n- *Record of Yuanyang Observatory* (元阳观记), authored by Zhū Gǒngchén.\n- *Record of Yùyè Ān* (玉液庵记), authored by Liú Zǎi.\n\n---\n\n**Teachings of the Twenty-Sixth Volume of the *Mao Shan Zhi***\n\n1.

This is because **形 (form)** is what **天 (Heaven)** manifests, and what surrounds **形 (form)** is none other than **天 (Heaven)**. Thus, it is said that at the juncture of **Dao/Way and humanity**, there is only **感 (response)** and **應 (correspondence)**.\n\nOnly when a person’s **氣 (qi)** is perverse does it begin to diverge from **天 (Heaven)**. Even a foolish man or woman, with a single resolute thought, can stir movement. How much more so for **高人德士 (noble virtuous ones)**, dwelling in solitary halls, refining their practices with utmost purity, where their will is set—**天 (Heaven)** will never defy them.\n\nIn the time of the **World Ancestor Emperor (世祖皇帝)**, Master Xu of **Jouqu (句曲)** came to court. When he **梼 (invoked)** disaster, it **應 (responded)**. The Emperor was astonished and specially ordered him to oversee the temple rituals and continue the **符錄 (symbolic records)** tradition. As Master Xu was about to ascend, he pressed his seal upon the **待 (awaiting)** hands of the present Lord Wang until he arrived to receive it.\n\nIn the **second year of the Great Virtue (大德二年)**, locusts plagued **Huainan (淮南)**. The **宣慰使 (Commissioner of Pacification)** of this **道 (Daoist region)** respectfully invited Lord Wang to Jiangdu, where he performed **醮 (ritual exorcism)** to avert the calamity. Soon, the locusts that had not yet sprouted wings were choked by the rain, and those that had wings were struck by a sudden wind that darkened the sky. They pecked at the locusts, ate them, then spat them out—pecking and spitting in cycles over several days. The locusts did not become a disaster.\n\nBefore this, when the drought **梼 (invoked)** rain, the people of **Huainan (淮南)** were greatly alarmed and delighted. They competed to offer gold and silk, worshipping and kneading it in reverence, but he refused none, and those who escorted him filled the road. On his return, he said: *“Do I truly need the rain to cease?* My sincerity alone suffices to fulfill my **法 (Daoist method)**.”\n\nWhen he **二 (twice)** achieved swift responses and saved countless lives across several prefectures, it was truly because **三茅君 (San Mao Jun, the Three Venerable Masters of Mao Shan)** had guided him. Moreover, the **宝运 (auspicious era)** was flourishing—how could there be starving people? The gold and silk he received, if stored in his coffers, would be a fortunate gain. I, in my separate dwelling, pray to the Three Venerable Masters on behalf of the nation, and also worship my two parents to repay their private blessings. This, perhaps, is fitting.\n\nThat year, he thus **遂 (completed)** the construction at the **束 (eastern side)** of the **Yuanfu (元符) Hall of Ten Thousand Tranquilities (万宁宫)**, gazing upward at the **枫轮 (crimson wheel, i.e., the sun)**, downward at the **金菌 (golden fungi, i.e., the moon)**. The mountain found its proper place, and the temple was forever established. The **限 (boundaries)** of the sacred site were refined into elegance, perfectly suited to the terrain. Neither frugality led to vulgarity nor excess to disorder. A total of over fifty halls were built, with **San Mao Jun** enshrined in the main hall and their **考妣 (ancestors)** in the side chambers.\n\nFrom the laying of the foundation to the completion of the work, it took six years. The temple was named **Hua Yang Dao Yuan (華陽道院)**.\n\nIn the **third summer of the Great Virtue (至大三年)**, the Emperor commanded the **Upper Clarity Successor Master (上清嗣宗师)**, the **Hao Zhenren (昊真人)**, to perform **醮 (ritual exorcism)** in **Jiangnan (江南)**, beginning at **Jouqu (句曲)**. Lord Wang traveled near **Jingkou (京口)**, and the **Hao Zhenren (昊真人)** said: *“The incense and offerings you have prayed to in court, I will now receive with my hands. I dare not disrespect them.”* As the **暑雨 (summer rains)** were relentless, he requested that the next day’s rites would reach **Yuanfu (元符)**. If the rain persisted, even a drop would be a shame to the **神 (divine)**.\n\nLord Wang replied: *“I dare not fail to respect your words.”* The following day, the rain barely ceased. After the offerings were made, it poured heavily during the rites, then stopped again. The **Hao Zhenren (昊真人)** returned to court and, in detail, recounted Lord Wang’s deeds as above, and thus sought an inscription for **Hua Yang (華陽)**.\n\nI heard that Lord Wang was **简 (modest)** yet **章 (illustrious)**, **庄 (serene)** yet **和 (harmonious)**, **静 (still)** yet **动 (active)** with perfect balance. He was truly a **道君子 (Daoist noble)**. Thus, when he **出言 (uttered words)**, calamities were averted; when he **有梼 (invoked disaster)**, the divine became manifest; when his **功 (deeds)** were complete, he did not claim credit; when his **德 (virtue/power)** was fulfilled, his humility only increased. Therefore, the Emperor granted him the title of **养素通真明教真人 (Nourishing Virtue, Penetrating Truth, Illuminating Daoist Master)**.\n\n**Jouqu (句曲)** has long been a **名山 (famed mountain)**. The **高人德士 (noble virtuous ones)** who dwell there, because of its secluded depths and worldly isolation, its tumultuous distance from the near, halt their **灵光 (spiritual brilliance)** to cultivate enlightenment and appreciation. Having recorded his deeds, I further inscribed these words, echoing the **步虚 (Ascending the Void)** hymns and capturing his **闲远 (tranquil and distant)** thoughts.\n\nLord Wang’s name was **Dao Meng (道孟)**, with the sobriquet **Mu Zhai (牧斋)**. He was from **Juchong (句容)** in **Jiankang (建康)**, the **四十四代宗师 (forty-fourth generation successor master)**.\n\n**Inscription:**\n*The towering and dim Jouqu (句曲) mountain,*\n*Where the gods and immortals dwell beneath clouds,*\n*Its purple banners and feathered canopies unfurled,*\n*The carp vanish suddenly—where do they flee?*\n\n*The **通真真人 (Tong Zhen Zhenren)** refines the **元精 (original essence)**,*\n*Feasting on mist and inhaling **氣 (qi)**—his complexion now clear.*\n*He lingers in **Yanggu (陽谷)**, blowing the jade flute,*\n*His **瑶装 (jade adornments)** and cranes in the **Kunlun (昆仑)** courtyard.*\n\n*When disaster looms, he spreads his wings to transform the world,*\n*When peace is restored, he stores blessings for the **天明 (Heavenly Clarity)**.*\n\n*His distant heart seeks **Penglai (蓬瀛)**,*\n*Handholding **青芝 (bluegrass, i.e., sacred herbs)** before the **丹经 (Cinnabar Scripture)**.*\n\n*At the **琼都 (Jade Capital)**, I gather these words,*\n*Greatly summoning the **真倡 (True Procession)** to touch the **幽灵 (profound spirits)**.*\n\n*Here, clarity and tranquility require no exertion,*\n*No disturbance—your **精 (essence)** can thus attain **長生 (longevity)**.*\n\n*Below, the dusty world is plagued by a hundred woes,*\n*Drunkenness and death in dreams—alas for short-lived suffering.*\n\n*In the **重阴 (dense shadows)**, no altar gazes upon the sun and stars,*\n*Yet those with desire may seek this inscription.*\n\n**Inscription of the Jouqu Mountain Cave and Spring:**\n*In the **泰定甲子 (Tai Ding Jia Zi, 1324)** year, the **玉虚子 (Yu Xu Zi, Jade Void Master)** constructed [this].\n\n**Mao Shan’s Three Mountains and the Luo Luo Peaks.**\n**The Great Dipper and Little Dipper**, mirroring the **七宫 (Seven Mansions)**.\n**Upper Clarity has its altar**, high and central.\nThe mountain bends to contain, the waters flow to pay homage.\n\nI cultivated the **華池 (Hua Pool)**, its inner landscape harmonizing.\nAt the **艮 (Kan, northwest)** it stands still,\nBlocking the **兌 (Dui, southeast)** void.\nThe **丹井 (Cinnabar Well)** flows westward,\nThe **石梁 (Stone Beam)** stretches eastward.\n\nThe **玄師 (Mysterious Master)** had his works,\nOmen of this **灵综 (profound convergence)**.\nStoring the **玉浆 (jade nectar)**, once used by **奚穷 (Qi Qiong, a legendary immortal)**.\nBenefiting all things, **Dao/Way** does not speak of merit.\n\n**Inscription of the Blessing Village Well:**\n*Only the **萧 (Xiao, a surname)** has a **台 (platform)**,*\n*By **曲水 (bending waters)**,*\n*The well’s **梵 (sacred)** essence unchanging,*\n*My thoughts turn to **若人 (such a one)**.*\n\n*Who is **若人 (such a one)**?*\n*His peers are **桐梧 (Tong Wu, legendary immortals)**.*\n\n*He received the **教 (Daoist teachings)** of **Hua Yang (華陽)**,*\n*And spread blessings to the **近 (nearby)** **丹丘 (Dan Qiu, Cinnabar Mound)**.*\n\n*His blessings endure for a hundred generations,*\n*Like **金玉 (gold and jade)**.*\n\n*This is called **正明 (True Clarity)**,*\n*And all receive its blessings.*\n\n**Inscription of the Great Dao Altar:**\nThe **Upper Clarity True Master (上清真人)**, **Pan Zunshen (潘尊师)**, embodied the **玄 (Mysterious)**, and built the **弘道坛 (Great Dao Altar)** at the **嵩 (Song) mountain’s** southern slope.\n\nThe **外史 (Outer Historian, i.e., Lord Wang)** of **Jouqu (句曲)**, with **基石 (foundation stones)** aligned to **Dao/Way**, restored the ancient ways and enshrined the **圣神 (Sacred Spirits)**.

**Dongtian Guan’s** (洞天馆) former overseer, **Ren Dun** (任敦).\nIn the **eleventh year of Song Yuanjia** (宋元嘉), **Lu Taihou** (路太后) first constructed the hall and altar.\n\nDuring the **Taishi era** (太始中), **Luling Taishou Kong Sizi** (庐陵太守孔嗣之) rebuilt it\nto honor **Qu’e’s lofty recluse, Hua Wenxian** (曲阿高士华文贤).\nIn the **second year of Qi Jianyuan** (齐建元), **Juan Jucong Wang Wencheng** (劝句容王文清)\nreestablished and took charge, naming it **Chongyuan Guan** (崇元馆).\nThe **Emperor Wu** (武帝), as **Crown Prince**, often visited it.\nAt the beginning of **Tang Zhenguan** (唐贞观初), it was renamed **Chongyuan Observatory** (崇元观).\n\nThere exists a stele from the **Taiji era** (太极元年), though its stone remains intact while its inscription has faded—\nonly the names of **Zuoxieyi Sun Chuxuan** (左拾遗孙处玄) and **Yang Youjing** (杨幽经) can be discerned.\n\nIn the **seventh year of Tianbao** (天宝七年), **Master Li Xuanjing** (李玄静先生) undertook a grand restoration,\nwith contributions from **a hundred families of commoners** (民百家).\nIn the **third year of Baoli** (宝历三年), the overseer was **He Sibaobao** (贺思宝),\nwhose records were later confirmed through inscriptions on artifacts.\n\nIn the **seventh year of Song Dazhong Xiangfu** (宋大中祥符), the name was bestowed as it is today.\nIn the **second year of Yuan Zhi Zhi** (大元至治二年), **Zhang Jun Sizhen** (句曲外史张君嗣真) first arrived to oversee it.\n\nGazing upon the **square platform facing south** (方台近对南面),\nto the left, **peaks stacked like jade** (左峰迭玉),\nto the right, the **branches of Damao Mountain** (右引大茅之支) curve and converge here.\n\n**Dinglu Jun** (定录君) remarked:\n*\"Beneath Damao Mountain lies a spring, where a quiet retreat may be established near the water’s mouth.\"*\n\n**Tao Yinjü** (陶隐居) noted:\n*\"Near the entrance of the **Southern Great Cave** (南大洞口) flows clear water amid rocks,\nand after a short ascent, the land levels out—here, **Wang Wencheng** once resided.\"*\n\nThus, this observatory is indeed the place.\nHe sighed and said:\n*\"The halls within these mountains, from the **Qi, Liang, Tang, and Song dynasties** down to today,\nhave been successively enlarged and augmented by each generation.\"*\n\n「In tracing the legacy of the Jin people, only this place and the residence of the Master of Xu, Master Yuchen, remain.\n\nYet what I have undertaken here is to restore and expand the neglected and humble structures—is this not my responsibility? Thus, I assessed the materials and gathered the workers, transforming the rear hall into the **Great Primordial Hall** (太元殿) to revive its former grandeur and enshrine the **Three Masters of Mao** (三茅君) within. To the east, I built the **Shrines of the Five Masters: Ren, Hua, Wang, Li, and He** (任、华、王、李、贺五君祠), and to the west, the **Shrine of Tao Yinjü** (陶隐居祠).\n\nI filled the foundation of the front hall to create the **Grand Dao Platform** (弘道坛), and inscribed a eulogy upon it myself.\n\nTo the north of the platform, I established the **Shrine of the Dark Warrior** (玄武祠), to the west, the **Shrine of Broad Benevolence** (广惠祠), and behind it, the **Literary Virtue Lecture Hall** (文贤讲堂), while at the front stands the **Main Gate** (都门).\n\nBeyond the gate, I dredged the ancient **Jade Spring Pool** (古玉津池), collecting all the waters from the southern slopes of Damao Mountain.\n\nFollowing the pool’s southwestern edge, I discovered the **Reading Platform of Master Zhaoming** (昭明太子读书台).\n\nBeside the platform lies a well called the **Well of Fukang** (福乡井)—Fukang, as it derives its name from the **Dao Retreat of Master Zhaoming** (昭明道馆).\n\nClearing the thickets and wild growth, I marked the site with inscriptions and stones, sheltering them under pavilions. All the scenic rock formations, caves, and springs within a hundred paces, I surveyed and recorded them as worthy of observation.\n\nIn the first year of **Taiding** (泰定), the **Master of Shangqing**, the forty-fifth generation **Master Liu Dabian** (刘君大彬), came to the capital, and I reported to him the details of my work, so that he might approve the sequence.\n\n**Zhang Jun** (张君), a native of the **Hao Commandery** (昊郡), was named **Tianyu** (天雨), with his inner name **Zhizhen** (嗣真), courtesy name **Boyu** (伯雨), and alternate sobriquet **Zhengju** (贞居). At twenty, he abandoned his family to embrace the **Dao/Way** (道), wandering through the renowned mountains of **Tiantai** (天台) and **Kechang** (括苍).\n\nA man from Hao, **Zhou Dajing** (周大静), was first a disciple of Master Xu and inherited the teachings of **Yang** (杨) and **Xu** (许). Zhang Jun followed him as a teacher, receiving all his doctrines. Once, he accompanied **Master Wang Shouyan of Kaiyuan** (开元王君寿衍) to the capital, where he was honored with imperial decrees and granted courier privileges. Though elevated by his teacher’s influence and appointed to office, this was not his true aspiration. He then swore never to seek advancement, and in response to the **Three Masters of Mao’s** (三茅) summons, he descended to serve the Five Masters—**Ren, Hua, Wang, Li, and He** (任、华、王、李、贺)—composing a declaration to that effect. He vowed to dedicate his full strength to this sanctuary, and his works include *The Outer Historian’s Mountain World Collection* (《外史山世集》) in three volumes, *The Record of Mystic Gatherings at Biyuan* (《碧岩玄会录》) in two volumes, and *The Chronicle of Mountain Seeking* (《寻山志》) in fifteen volumes, all marked by meticulous research and vast erudition.\n\nAh! Since Master Ren first resided here, spanning nearly five hundred years, only five individuals have succeeded in transmitting the legacy—what profound dedication to the distant future is this! How unlike later generations, who merely entice their disciples and bind them through personal ties, as if they were household servants or father-son relations!\n\nThus, I prefer to wait for those who share my vision of grandeur.\n\nNow, Zhang Jun has no prior imperial assistance to rely upon; clad in coarse robes and subsisting on simple fare, he labors here alone. Yet his heart is vast, and he contemplates aligning with scholars across the land to establish a foundation for the ages—is this not the spirit of a noble and magnanimous man? Therefore, I consider him a **secular friend** (方外友), admiring his foresight in reaching beyond my own.\n\nHence, I composed this poem in his honor:\n\n---\n**Damao’s Southern Slope**, where **Primordial Qi** (元气) gathers,\n**Yin Pass** (阴关) seals its gates, the **Yang Caverns** (阳洞) open wide.\n**Twisting Caverns** (曲穴) hold flowing springs, safeguarding this **Spiritual Retreat** (灵宅).\nMaster **Ren** (任君) comes to taste the **Yellow and Red Stones** (黄赤石).\n\n**Heaven’s Unity** (天一) bestows the **Great Primordial Seal** (太元册),\n**Qu’e** (曲阿) nurtures with discriminating care.\nThe **Hall’s Foundations** (构宫) stand firm, as decreed by Master **Wang** (王伯),\n**Pure Processions** (清跸) pause here, their **Spiritual Echoes** (灵响) resonant and refined.\n\n**Empty Forests** (虚林) flourish with crisp clarity, their splendor transformed,\n**Fukang’s** (福乡) imperial child bestows sweet nectar.\nHow many years without sustenance, yet his **Sacrificial Arms** (遗臂) remain steadfast,\n**White Clouds** (白云) mirror the void, where **Master Yuchen** (玉清客) dwells.\n\nIn **Kaiyuan’s** full vigor, the world was burdened with endless tasks,\nHolding the **Imperial Seal** (持节), he stood at noon’s height, offering incense to the **Dark Warrior** (熏璧).\nSince then, the age has declined, generations have passed in isolation,\n**Stone Mirrors** (石镜) bear inscriptions, while **Earthly Demons** (土漫画) deface them.\n\nWho now revives the ancient customs? Only **Zhang Jun, the Outer Historian of Qu’e** (句曲外史), whose **crown of excellence** (美冠乌) shines brightest.\nHe pored over a thousand volumes, his **innocence** (天真) and **spiritual lineage** (玄系) traced in careful succession.\n\nWithin the **Jade Chamber and Golden Hall** (玉室金堂), there is no lack of instruction.\n---\n**The Chronicle of Mao Mountain, Volume Twenty-Seven** concludes.\n**The Chronicle of Mao Mountain, Volume Twenty-Eight** begins.»\n\nThe **Mao Mountain Chronicle** concludes its **Upper Dao/Way Sect** lineage:\nThe Master Liu Dabian of **Succeeding Upper Clarity** crafted *Golden Carpets* and *Jade Weavings*,\nThe **Poems of the Northern and Southern Dynasties** and the **Fifteen Hundred Lines of Hua Yang Stone Eulogy**,\nAs well as **Tao Qian’s** *River Chapters* and the **Records of Past Renown**—all bearing **Confucius’** mark.\n\nFor three nights, the **Luminous Hosts** adorned the heavens,\nTwo **Golden Ones** stood as earthly emblems.\nThe **Right Pivot**—its dwelling shifts from non-existence to existence,\nIn existence, it returns to emptiness.\nThe **Spiritual Structure** needs no craftsman,\nThe **Void Form** achieves success on its own.\n\nThe **Right Essence and Manifestation**—the divine essence encompasses the **Three Palaces**,\nThe **Five Circuits** intermingle with the **Five Colors**.\nThe **Yin Luster** greets the night’s wisdom,\nThe **Morning Essence** gazes toward the dawn’s suspension.\n\nThe **Right Form and Position**—the **Southern Peak** displays the **Mystic Cauldron**,\nThe **Northern Ridge** spans the **Qin Seal**.\nIts **outer boundaries** embrace the **Jade Sands’** crossing,\nIts **inner wheel** veils the **Hidden Circuits**.\n\nThe **Left Belt** follows the **Grove of Willow and Samphire Waters**,\nThe **Right** clears the **Yang Valley’s** streams.\nThe **soil** cradles the **Northern Darkness’** hue,\nThe **wells** reflect the **Phoenix Gate’s** chill.\n\nThe **Right Traces and Marks**—the **Guo Dry Banks** stand in silent vigil,\nThe **Jiang and Ba Distant Paths** stretch endlessly.\nThe **Crane Temple** sometimes offers feasts,\nThe **Separate Dwelling** remains in constant reverence.\n\nThe **Right Category and Affiliation**—the **Celestial Residence** knows not the earth,\nThe **Yue Tomb** curses the **Hidden Migration**.\nThe **Tree Canopy** bends in vain beneath the shade,\nThe **Stone Tortoise** never tasted incense smoke.\n\nThe **Right Material Paths**—the **Fruit Grove** lingers in **Nai’s** shadow,\nThe **Vegetable Patch** sprawls with **Xin’s** vines.\nThe **Glowing Reishi** can light the night,\nThe **Field Springs** once stirred the dust.\n\nThe **Right Gatherings**—the **Descending Guest** of **Gui Mountain**,\nThe **Unbridled Chariot** of **Qing Hua’s** youth.\nThey dined in the **True Essence Hall**,\nAnd convened in the **Lofty and Serene Palace**.\n\nThe **Right Talents**—their **Pure Songs** soared in the **Feathered Assembly**,\nTheir **Long Whistles** returned with the **Cloud’s** turn.\nA **Single String** held its **Graceful Tune**,\nYet **Empty Talk** found no equal.\n\nThe **Right Learning and Aspiration**—the **Pathway to the Dao** already ascends,\nThe **Flying Flowers** now guide the heart.\n\nThe **Right Divine Aid and Fate**—the **Spirit’s Salvation** exists as it should,\nDeparture or stay follows its natural course.\nWhy seek **Manifestation** when the heart is near?\nThe **Dark Path** knows its own way.\n\nThe **Right Rectitude and Fulfillment**—in the **Four Corners**, the **Jade Blade** wanders,\nIn **Hua Yang**, the **Hidden Dweller** takes root.\nThe **Seven Elements** may yet support the **Buxu**,\nIf **Repeated Separation** should ever resemble.\n\nThe **Right Omen and Promise**—the **Hao Cycle** will soon be complete,\nThe **Hai Count** not yet ended in **Ding**.\nWhen **Tang’s** era arrives, the **Guest** comes to the **Holy Court**.\n\nThe **Right Sincerity and Hope**—engraved on the **Mystic Window**,\nInscribed at the **Bent Stage’s** gate.\nIn **action and repose**, they wish to be recorded,\nNot failing the **recommendation of virtue/power**.\n\nThe **Right Response to Command**—\n\n---\n\n**Mountain Retreat**\nWhat does the mountain hold?\nWhite clouds abound on the ridges.\nOnly for oneself may it bring delight,\nUnfit to send to you, my lord.\n\n**On Departure**\nThe nature of mind was born of old,\nGreen virtue long sustained.\nThough transformed, it does not vanish in obscurity—\nIn the Dao, joy and sorrow are borne.\nCrown and sword cast empty shadows,\nReins and bridle mark the immortal form.\nFrom this bright hall of revelry, I depart,\nTo join the guests of Penglai’s isle.\nIf you can follow in my footsteps,\nI will guide you to the Dao’s hidden ford.\n\n**Seeking Master Huan in the Mountains**\n*By Xiao Yao of Shaoling*\nUnyielding peaks and valleys stretch in Ucing,\nWhere wind and cloud enter the clay-walled cell.\nUnless one harbors the spirit of retreat,\nWho could endure frost and dew’s relentless chill?\n\n**Entering the Mountains**\n*By Dafa He*\nMorning dawns in the cold valley’s embrace,\nSeeking truth after setting down my gifts.\nThe sacred altar droops with dense leaves,\nClear waters teem with crimson scales.\nThough the peach grove hides wild beasts,\nThe immortals’ fields await the worthy.\nWhen the elixir’s craft is perfected,\nThe furnace’s silver begins to fade.\nKnow this place surpasses all others—\nHere, the clamor of the world dissolves.\n\n**In Reply to Master Tao of Huayang**\n*By Shen Yue*\nThe Three Pure Ones are not yet veiled,\nYet one breath remains—still preserved.\nI wish to reclaim the fading light,\nTo rescue souls from peril’s grasp.\nIf granted the Nine Elixirs’ gift,\nWhat fear have I of the Six Dragons’ flight?\n\n**Returning to My Garden in Reply to Master Tao of Huayang**\nLong I wished to seek the sacred peaks,\nWaiting till my marriage rites were done.\nThough these two tasks are now complete,\nOther matters still remain undone.\nNews of the Dragon Chart’s arrival came,\nAnd honor’s glow now fills my hall.\nAs Vice-Premier of the Eight Directions,\nI open lands and grant a thousand homes.\nThough my cap and sash were never shown,\nWind and rain never touched my comb.\nJade chimes resound at the cavern’s gate,\nGolden cicadas gleam in morning’s sun.\nAshamed I lack the humble’s gratitude,\nYet still I bear the Lord’s high rank.\nHow could I forget my lifelong vow—\nTo spare no salt in my care for all?\n\n**Master Huayang Riding the Tower and Not Descending**\nA sage once spoke of humble wood\nAscending to the clouds’ domain.\nThe lotus bud, though bought with coins,\nUnfolds not on the earthly plain.\nThe immortal’s home is rich with towers bright,\nWhere I await the Three Rare Herbs’ bloom,\nAnd watch the hundred deities in court.\nThe black tortoise bears the sacred scroll,\nThe noble guest arrives with dragon reins.\nNot just the spirit peach bears fruit—\nNow the great *zhuang* tree withers too.\n\n**In Farewell to Lady Yi, Master Huayang’s Outer Soldier**\nFeasting on jade prolongs the years,\nSwallowing mist restores the form.\nFaintly I recall the Green Mound’s trees,\nAnd see again the sun at the Mulberry’s gate.\nThe mirage’s slow waves stretch wide,\nMountains rise from the boiling cauldron’s tide.\n\n**In Reply to Master Qu from Jianqu**\nAll day, auspicious mists exhale,\nBy evening, strange vapors brew.\nLofty gorges nurture rare herbs,\nLayered cliffs yield the wine of life.\nWithin dwell men of true refinement,\nIn coarse robes guarding the Dao’s depth.\nStone doors hide ten arcane secrets,\nThe golden altar summons the Nine Immortals.\nRiding the *an* bird, they tread the Han,\nWith crane reins, they soar to heaven’s span.\n\n**In Reply to Master Quan Qi of Maoshan**\n*By Huangfu Yan*\n\n---\n\n**In Farewell to Lady Yi, Master Huayang’s Outer Soldier**\n*(as previously translated)*\n\n---\n\n**To Lu Qianfu on His Journey to Teahill Grotto**\nSouthward I gaze—Jiangnan’s peaks are snowbound,\nThis sorrow lingers, who shall bear its weight?\nIn vain I follow the grass-clad clerk, never idle,\nWhile with the scholars I’ve been long parted.\nHearing you sit in quiet, lost in books,\nPlanting trees and thatching reeds at your old home.\nAll day the white clouds drift by—enough to content,\nNext year’s fragrant grasses, what will they bring?\nLife’s cares press heavy, unfulfilled,\nEven public doors cannot fully spare.\nWhen will the spring wind bear my boat home?\nFirst tell me of Huayang’s cave—deep or shallow?\n\n---\n\n**Sending Zhang Daoist Back to Teahill Mountain**\nAlone toward the mountain, one man walks,\nNear the grotto, a crane greets him alone.\nOnly white letters pass to his disciples,\nAnd white stones earn him the title *Master*.\nEndless peach trees clothe the green hills,\nMoonlit fields await the plow’s return.\nLong he served the Lesser Lord,\nNow he follows Mao’s node to Qingcheng’s peak.\n\n---\n\n**Sending Zheng the Outer Official to Teahill Mountain**\nI see your whole family depart—\nWho knows when you’ll return?\nWhite clouds greet the valley’s mouth,\nFlowing waters ask of those within.\nCrowns and robes cast aside,\nDivine affairs fill the mountain.\nThere must be treasures unseen,\nWhy value just a body’s ease?\n\n---\n\n**Sending Zheng the Second to Teahill Mountain**\nThe stream cuts through the ravine,\nAll day the grass grows long.\nDeep in the mountain at spring’s end,\nDogs bark, cranes cry.\nWhere are the mulberry rows,\nPlanted by whom in vain?\n\n---\n\n**Mountain Residence—Miscellaneous Notes**\n*(by Gu Kuang)*\nThe Teahill Immortal descends from his thatched hall,\nSerene and secluded in the hidden realm.\nYang Jun’s leisurely law ascends,\nThe Lord of Fate halts the flowing years.\nPeach blossoms gather at the water’s edge,\nWindow frames the willow valley’s mist.\nHolding my grandson, I watch the trees grow,\nLeaning on my staff, I ask of the plowed fields.\nLet worldly affairs disturb no more,\nFloating fame may fade to one side.\nFrom old, like Xie Anshi,\nHe never sought the elixir’s spring.\n\n---\n\n**Peach Blossom Ravine**\nAt Peach Blossom Ravine, I meet a maiden’s veil,\nBetween the trees, apricot leaves fall on the altar.\nAn elder hands down the *Upper Purity Register*,\nNight’s step on the Void Mountain—chill as moon.\n*(Note: \"Upper Purity\" refers to Daoist scriptures of high attainment.)*\n\n---\n\n**New Dwelling on Great Teahill Mountain, Remembering My Lost Son Who Followed the Dao**\nThe valley raven still calls for my child,\nThe mountain man weeps at dusk.\nAcross life and death, my heart aches,\nIn vain I climb these heights.\nThe gate is barred with sorrow,\nWest River’s grief runs deep.\nFrom ancient times, the Middle Way was lost,\nOnly in scriptures do we seek it now.\nThe Great Symbol never ceases,\nSwiftly it shapes past and future.\nHis early death was no misfortune,\nHis body refined by the Dark Yin.\nWho would dare climb the Cloud Stairs,\nLike gold forged in fire?\nThe empty hall keeps his old notes,\nThe grotto’s room hides his idle lute.\nSpring’s sources rise at Fangzhu’s peak,\nAbove, the empty green pines.\nAs if dreams and waking merge,\nThe faint, lonely sounds drift.\nSoft grass covers the riverbank,\nFresh clouds hover, light as mist.\nThe sun’s farewell paints the scene anew,\nWaves clasp the shore in rippling cries.\nThe stone cave cradles a cloud’s nest,\nFar off, the southern peak stands lone.\nGrief and regret now sever,\nNo dust can stain this stillness.\nTrue quiet shifts in an instant,\nSitting or rising, all is one.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems on Returning to Peach Blossom Ravine**\nA wasted life, now broken,\nLater years may fade as swiftly.\nPoets lament the wind and rain,\nWhen will the long night end?\nNo ties to the court’s affairs,\nFew dreams of home’s return.\nNo aid in midlife’s struggles,\nI choose stillness, forget the world’s noise.\nFair scenes turn to heavy shade,\nThe grotto’s mountain stands alone.\nIf the spirit tide bears word,\nSend thanks to the west-flying crow.\n\n---\n**The First Poem:**\nMorning, I meet my beloved beneath the green trees,\nSeated where blossoms blush.\nEvening, I wait for my beloved,\nRain flies, drenching the green pavilion.\nWhere is my beloved’s home?\nMidnight’s heart is lonely.\nI recall the flowers just opening,\nNow shocked to see the leaves fall.\nRiding through the deer’s spring stream,\nOutside, the twin seas’ cranes call.\nMy wishes have their source,\nHow can I dwell in such thinness?\n\n---\n**The Second Poem:**\n*(as above)*\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on Lu Daoist’s Chamber**\nAutumn’s pestle echoes on the fallen wood,\nSitting with the Teahill Master.\nOnly two boys stand outside,\nDrawing water where the flowers bloom.\nThe empty altar basks in white daylight,\nThe divine tripod sends phoenix sand aloft.\nDust trails sweep the frost-kissed grass,\nGolden bells chime in the clear, high sky.\nThe chapter above separates from the mundane,\nI watch the chessboard’s shade slant.\nBowing, I ask of the Dao’s essence,\nYellowroot’s flower may be my feast.\n\n---\n\n**Recalling the Mountain**\nSpring returns, yet I cannot return,\nMy home lies deepest in the hills.\nThe orchid garden’s spring is damp,\nMoonlight maps the idle window’s pane.\nMy small fields border the valley’s mouth,\nMy humble duties I ask of others.\nWhere I go, there is no strife,\nHeavy gates lock the secluded path.\n\n---\n\n**Sending Li Daoist Back to Peach Blossom Ravine**\nWasted years in the human realm,\nThe Dao’s source still waits.\nEnvy your bamboo staff,\nAs you leave, hidden in Peach Blossom’s shade.\nThe crow departs—does it know the way?\nClouds fly, as if they remember home.\nDo not fret over changing hair,\nThe Purple River’s elixir remains.\n\n---\n\n**Midnight Gazing at the Immortal’s Observatory**\nAt dusk, the crow returns with flowers in its beak,\nUnder moonlight, the green mountains rise.\nI know the jade maiden’s window trees,\nOnly immortals may climb.\n\n---\n\n**In Reply to Wei Xiaqing on His Return to Teahill Mountain, Also Commemorating Lady Jing’s Name**\nThe Jade Emperor dwells in the Golden Gate,\nTo which sacred peaks does he pay homage?\nHis edicts still strike fear,\nYet divine logic transcends even that.\nThe Crane Temple’s new home is near,\nThe Dragon Gate’s old land lies far.\nMy departing spirit lingers,\nThe grotto’s flute plays on.\n\n---\n**Sending Gu Kun Back to Teahill Mountain**\n*(by Wei Xiaqing)*\nIn this sacred age, you are exiled,\nThe Void Sovereign makes you his minister.\nThe Law

stains to wash the wine cakes.\n\nOn the emerald walls, I chant from morn till night,\nBeside the warm clouds, I drink and wake in delight.\nI lean on my staff, its length measured by my mood,\nAnd borrow a guest’s height to build the thatched pavilion.\n\nI set you as the stern *Cháoběi Dì* of the north,\nAnd ask of the *Shùmiǎn*’s clear depths—\nWho will guard the evening’s retreat?\n\nOften I think of the garden’s near orchards,\nAnd plan to borrow the neighbor’s peak to gather *Lí*.\nI stake half the tree to the half-open door—\nCool and bright in the morning’s haze.\nBehind me, the zither’s strings hum faint,\nBeside the dimming candle, the dawn’s glow glitters.\n\nOnce, I knew *Wángměng* by his flea-picking,\nNow, I sigh like *Guǎnníng*’s dragon’s departure.\nThe *Chánpò*’s glow may yet visit my *Huì*’s curtain,\nBut my fishing rod alone rests on the *Fēngtíng*’s bank.\n\nThe fine grass drinks in the smoke’s breath—\nNo end to its emerald hue.\nThe idle flowers rise with the rain’s intent—\nFragrant as the morning’s dew.\nThe waves strike the shore, startling the *Fěicuì*’s flight,\nThe sunlight slants through the curtains, hindering the *Qīngtíng*’s path.\n\nAt first, I was summoned to the *Hàn*’s mountain passes,\nNow, I await the day to break the *Yànshān*’s seals.\nThe six reins still loose on the thousand-mile steed,\nA single pouch holds but the autumn’s fireflies.\n\nI grieve the *Wángměng*’s true wisdom, left in the sleeves of the world,\nYet others hire the *Zhāngjiànfàn*’s talents—\nHeroic as the court’s grand feast.\nTogether we seek the deep ravine’s scattered woods,\nI ask but a single floating lotus from the *Cānghǎi*’s depths.\n\nOften I cast aside the world’s trivialities,\nMy heart clears, my gaze fades into the mist.\nAlready I’ve bought the flat-bottomed boat,\nTo bind the *Zhēnzhì*’s true precepts.\nWith Daoist texts in hand, I let the winds lift my vessel.\n\n---\n\n**Sent to Hé Wēiyí and Wèiyí of Teag Mountain (Two

lands, the spring bloomed with the cave’s flowers.\n\nLeisurely I stand by the piled mists to seek the waterfall’s eye,\nThe frozen waves and scattered snow yield the *Zhī*’s sprouts.\nThese years, I’ve followed the *Huángtíng*’s teachings,\nEach evening, I refine my spirit, each morn, I drink in the clouds’ glow.\n\nOnce I asked men how to pay homage to the *Jiēní*,\nSuddenly I doubted—\nWas it through dreams that I reached the Daoist ranks?\nMy robes are light, drawn by the crane’s feathers,\nThe clouds’ mist swells my hair—\nHigh as the *Lùshí*’s deer’s antlers.\n\nThe mountain’s warmth spares no meat,\nOnly the peak’s *Jiǔ* is left.\nThe water’s chill lingers,\nStill the cave’s *Táo* falls.\n\nI’ve heard tales of your future quests for wonders,\nNow I feel my spirit fly each night in labor.\n\n---\n\n**Farewell to a Friend Retiring from Office into Teag Mountain**\n\nI call my boy to brush the dawn’s dust from my saddle,\nTo ascend the great *Máoshān*’s heights.\nThough my meager stipend ceases to sustain me,\nThe morning’s *Míngxiá*’s glow is ample feast.\n\nThe dark frost turns the pine’s leaves crimson,\nThe sparse rain chills the hall’s thatched eaves.\nAgain, I carve the *Zhōngfēng*’s stone,\nTo rebuild the altar where the moon is worshipped.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Zhūqū*’s True Words**\n\nIn the twelfth month, on the second day,\nThe *Zhūqū*’s Daoist Master *Zhāozhēn* on the *Dàmáofēng*’s peak,\nWhere disciples from ten thousand miles gather to learn of the immortals.\nI, though distant from the *Huáyáng*’s heavens,\nHave only a single night’s journey by horse—\nA day’s dust—\nAnd cannot fulfill my wish to go.\nThus, I send my spirit each morning,\nAs if I already ascend with you.\nI composed the *Zhāozhēn*’s verses,\nOne for welcoming, one for farewell,\nTo ease my longing heart.\n\n**迎真**\nThe Nine-Hua bell tolls sharp against the chilled spring,\nTen thousand flags sway, damp with emerald mist.\nThe *Sīmìng*’s banner still hangs unlowered—\nIncense burns, I clutch my tablet, standing still in reverence.\n\nA dying star casts light upon my brocade hem,\nA crescent moon divides itself, yielding to the crane’s shadow.\nFrom the hollow cave, a sacred chant rings out—\nAnd spring awakens, awakening the valleys’ smoke and blossoms.\n\n**送真**\nThe coiled clouds loosen the phoenix’s hair,\nJade staff and iron rod held high, advancing first.\nThe *Cháozhēn*’s disciples stand silent, bowing twice—\nA jade cup brims with *hángméi* wine, its vapor rising.\n\nThe fire-bell clatters, the dragon-hair canopy leaps,\nGreen locks tumble, the *bìliàn* sash unfurls.\nIn an instant, all things dissolve—\nOnly the moon’s edge hums with the echo of a jingling belt.\n\n---\n\n**江南秋怀寄华阳山人**\n\nFrost grips my hair at dawn’s first light,\nYet my old land’s spirit still swells within me.\nMy heart longs to return in a single night,\nBut autumn’s sickness weighs me lighter than nine seasons.\n\nI rise to sing beneath the eaves,\nThen weep at the loom’s sad, measured hum.\nMountains invite me to retreat—\nYet what path leads to honor’s hollow gain?\n\nI trace my staff in vain, claiming fate,\nHold my rod but scorn its name.\nIf forgetfulness awaits me,\nThen laziness may yet find its ease.\n\nA narrow path parts the grass,\nA crooked door barely marks the years.\nThe lotus cups the morning dew,\nThe chrysanthemum sleeps in smoke’s embrace.\n\nI tune my strings to listen to the wind,\nSketch the waves to watch the sea’s calm.\nThe heron’s feathers drift white on the isle,\nThe fish’s tail parts the water’s pardon.\n\nThe courtyard orange bows for my scent,\nThe garden melon is plucked for the pot.\nThe crow pecks at my ink-stained table,\nThe field mouse gnaws the bookshelf’s edge.\n\nI plant beans and mourn the *Yáng*’s decline,\nCast melons and recall *Wèi*’s elegance.\nWho binds the neighbors as a recluse?\nThe *Nánguō* master stands alone.\n\nThe stars’ domains grow sparse and cold,\nThe mountains’ *guà* signs bring little luck.\nMy robes are coarse, my learning vast yet scattered—\nThe *Sāo*’s leaves cling to my sleeve,\nThe *Nèishǐ*’s broth warms my bowl.\n\nThough the *Ōuguān*’s hat suits the south,\nThe *Yánglào*’s cheese lacks refinement.\nI lean on my whistle, grief welling,\nDebate the *Dao*, then drain my cup.\n\nI linger, weary, beating the *gǔ* drum,\nA hero’s heart loves gold but scorns its cost.\nI pass the elixir’s furnace,\nTaste the tea, then test the stone’s worth.\n\nThe marsh hides the withered reeds,\nThe window frames the stripped *wú* tree’s glow.\nI mock *Zhāng Hàn*’s return to the south,\nYet lack *Mí Héng*’s talent to be envied.\n\nMy spirit fades with distant longing,\nMy resentment gnaws at my bones.\nA chipped whetstone proves the blade’s edge,\nA flawed mirror reveals the jade’s luster.\n\nThe *Dao*’s source flows thin and clear,\nScholarship thrives on sincerity alone.\nI dare not sigh at wasted years—\nBetter this than chaos’ fleeting rose.\n\n*Xiáng*’s fate was near death’s door,\n*Hàn*’s king still held his counsel tight.\nFeeding and flight are fated,\nPoverty and power are but shifting tides.\n\nThe shackled slave may rise to noble rank,\nThe jesting fool may earn the court’s favor.\nBathing in the sun, who measures its warmth?\nChasing the wind, who counts the miles?\n\nDust clogs my ears, divides my thoughts,\nMy liver and gall blend with the autumn’s chill.\nI urge *Shǔ* to seize the war’s command,\n*Ōu* alone asks for the general’s reins.\n\nA common man may leap in dance,\nTen thousand horsemen march in ranks.\nTo serve the state is lighter than wife and child,\nTo guard the border weighs more than plow and sword.\n\nSuddenly, the high cup is passed,\nI tire of the *Wǔhóu*’s fish too soon.\nSilent, I await the three moves’ decree,\nAt ease, I calculate the board’s end.\n\n*Sīmǎ*’s laws run deep,\n*Èrshī*’s might commands the troops.\nThe northern snow buries the beacon towers,\nThe winter cabbage splits the banner’s silk.\n\nSeizing the moment, I draft my decree,\nThat very day, I sweep the rebels clean.\n*Wǔ*’s old might still shakes the customs,\n*Wén*’s art now strings the eight chords.\n\nThe *Zhēn*’s jade is laid in order,\nThe *Xià*’s teachings take their first root.\nThe sprouts smother the demons’ schemes,\nThe pine and cypress stand firm in virtue.\n\nThe *Lángguān* bows in jade-laced halls,\nThe envoys wear embroidered robes to welcome.\nThe *Dàozǎng*’s path nears its dawn,\nThe *Jiāobō*’s waves grow smooth and still.\n\nThe scholar blushes to speak of conquest,\nThe worthy man scorns the *yǐn*’s deceit.\nWith staff in hand, I sing of the southern fields,\nMy muscles tense for the northern march.\n\nMy talent pales beside *Cáo Dòu*’s timidity,\nMy scrolls fill like *Huì Chē*’s carts.\n*Xiè* pities his brother’s daughter,\n*Hào*’s family treasures nephew and niece.\n\nOnly the *Huāngzhú*’s hall stands empty,\nNo gifts for the *Jǐngshān*’s spear.\nThe worthy’s reputation fades with distance,\nMy thoughts drift on the lake’s endless tide.\n\nThe rudder creaks, the ferry rocks,\nThe wild geese dip and rise in flight.\nThe late trees stand sparse in jade-green,\nThe strange peaks stretch in the clear sky’s light.\n\nThe water roars, the *zǐyīng* flowers twist,\nThe village echoes with the *xiāng*’s incense.\nThe fisherman’s hat seeks ancient traces,\nThe guard dog snarls behind the split fence.\n\nMy coarse linen wraps my shoulders,\nThe tax-grain’s green bags hang high.\nThe land yields its richness in abundance,\nIts people thrive in wealth and years.\n\nWhen friends gather, the wine flows freely,\nAlone, the years loom sharp and cold.\nThe cicadas’ chirp clings to the wall,\nThe balcony’s crane dances on the beam.\n\nThe garrison’s wind howls through the drums,\nThe neighbor’s moon stirs the *áizhēng*’s strings.\nWithout skill in letters, how claim clean pay?\nThe lead melts back to its ore,\nI wield the axe—*dīngdīng* sharp.\n\nI fear the carving’s rot,\nYet toil exceeds the jade’s worth.\nI focus my spirit on the evening’s bloom,\nStrain for the morning’s light.\n\nThe moth-eaten scrolls spill from the basket,\nThe frost-bound orange stands at dawn.\nThe quiet coral feeds the guest’s hunger,\nThe idle official scorns the historian’s pen.\n\nHeaven and earth stretch in silent sorrow,\nMountains and rivers shift unseen.\nWho can divide the *bì*’s blessings?\nWho dares equal *Páng*’s fate?\n\n*Xiàng* was no saint with his double pupils,\n*Kuí*’s single foot brought no shame.\n*Ruàn Yóu* drank deep of the *yáng*’s wine,\n*Zhuāng Yè* laughed at the *shāng*’s sacrifice.\n\nThe *páichǐ*’s teeth need no speech,\nA broad heart holds no grudge.\nBut take the furnace’s silk,\nReject the *wèilúo*’s snare.\n\nA single inkstone scrapes the pond’s roots clean,\nThe boat pushes through the dream’s grain.\nThe short letter’s bamboo is bound in green,\nThe low table holds the *fàn*’s red seal.\n\nThe frost’s message hastens the willows,\nThe smoke curls around the *dùjīng*’s stem.\nThe rafters cradle the swallows’ nest,\nThe screen frames the drunk *xīngxīng*’s sway.\n\nThe knots of the *huáng*’s shadow pile,\nThe flying spring sprays jade’s treasure.\nThe tangled vines seek near and far,\nThe bamboo frame holds the game’s win or loss.\n\nThe railing presses the *pībō*’s gourd,\nThe eaves drip the *yángléi*’s tangerines.\nI forget my sorrow with *Zōng Bǐng*’s gaze,\nMy illness lingers past *Liú Zhēn*’s verse.\n\nThe wild harvest boasts of *jùfàn*’s feast,\nThe *Jiāngshāng* sells the *zhè*’s arrow.\nI send the god’s robe with the clay drum,\nLeave the guest with the porcelain *yóu*.\n\nI raise the *jiān* to wield the green blade,\nBlow the *láng* to guide the distant light.\nThe crow’s flight darkens the sky’s pall,\nThe carp’s scales break the water’s calm.\n\nMy spear is not for battle’s hand,\nMy waist’s forge awaits the whetstone’s grind.\nFrost makes the reeds stand rigid,\nYet I seek the steel’s true ring.\n\nI sigh at the *chóng*’s sweet emptiness,\nThen turn to the *lù*’s bitter lotus.\nGrief stretches long, uncut,\nThe song ends—who will take it up?\n\nThe *Yellow Stone*’s teacher is yet untouched,\nYet I alone can speak of *White Technique*’s art.\n\nBy nature turbulent, my talent is bound—\n*Māng*’s fate must ever be one.\n\nThe *jù*’s growth resumes its sprout,\nIn secluded lands, the lute and cup stand lone.\nThe stream’s chill echoes with staff and sandals’ tread.\n\nWhen things align, my heart dissolves in quiet accord,\nThe halberd falls—our pledge of shared resolve.\nSilken strings pull *Língfēi*’s consort’s *sè*,\nGolden cases hold *Tàizǐ*’s *shēng*’s clear song.\n\nIn hidden dwellings, I cling to bamboo’s embrace,\nMy thoughts drift through *Péngyíng*’s misty expanse.\nI conjure the *Zhū*’s timid phoenix,\nThen chase the waves—\nThe *qīngyīng*’s flight soars.\n\nDeep the mist-shrouded curtains, silent as the grave,\nThe *yúnqìng*’s chimes ring crisp and bright.\n\nMany the titles I’ve inscribed, yet none compare,\nTo *Huáyáng*’s kin—my truest brethren.\nIncense burns, my mind fixed in a single chamber,\nAll day I ponder the *céngchéng*’s layers.\n\nShadows hide in jagged hues,\nVoices echo in the *bòxiè*’s hollow wind.\nI shall cultivate the mighty *jùshǔ*,\nAnd bind the *chángjīng*’s path to strike.\n\n**Journeying to Máo Mountain**\n*Dù Gǒuhè*\nStep by step into Máo’s gate,\nWhere *Dao*’s paths divide like crow-black trails.\nFishermen and woodcutters find no trace,\nWild deer and elk form their own thickets.\nFrom the stone’s face, waters burst forth,\nThrough the pine’s crown, clouds are split asunder.\nUnder the moon’s cold, *Dao*’s folk pay homage,\nOne by one, they bow to Máo’s lord.\n\n**Sending Master Yuán to Return to Máo Mountain**\n*Lǐ Jiànxūn*\nAfter years without grain, my countenance blooms like peach,\nMy cheeks flushed with hues of spring.\nHalf-drunk, I leave the city’s walls,\nA single robe against the snow’s chill.\nThe stream’s voice greets Máo’s cavern at dawn,\nStone halls cast shadows where clouds once were.\nDo not emulate the *Qín*’s wayfarers,\nWhose letters fade with time.\n\n**Sending Scholar Xu Chǔshì to Máo Mountain**\n*Pān Yòu*\nThe *Tiāntán*’s clouds drift like snow,\nJade caves hold waters like a lute’s song.\nWhite clouds and flowing streams,\nA thousand years to cleanse the heart’s weight.\nYou depart with your cloth-bound satchel,\nThe road long, winds calling through the pines.\nOnce you enter *Huáyáng*’s hall,\nWho shall seek you through the ages’ span?\n\n**Lodging at Máo Mountain**\n*Xú Xiàn*\nMáo’s and *Xǔ*’s *qì*’s cold, sharp breath,\nOne household, guests beneath the same roof.\nThe *xiānshān*’s halls stand empty, save the shrine,\nYet none lift wine to honor those within.\nAlone I go, true to my calling’s flight,\nFloating fame a burden to the pure.\nLet each fulfill his year’s longing—strive aright,\nFor *Yún Dòng*’s spring shall evermore endure.\n\n**The Golden *Xiè* Scroll: Poems of the Song Dynasty on a Journey to the Southern Xu Prefecture and Visiting Máo Mountain**\n\n**Fàn Zhòngyán**\nHow does the *Dānyáng* prefect’s resolve compare?\nFirst pay homage to the *Máo* sage, then disembark.\n\nWith three dismissals, your loyalty to the state now spent,\nYet five decades’ worth of heart you’ve lent to the Dao.\nYou seek the numinous herb and chance upon the *Zhī*’s grove,\nDesiring to knock upon the *Zhēn*’s gate and borrow the jade scroll.\nNo need to follow others to ask of the pass’s block,\nThe heavens decree that the officials hide you in the *xiān*’s abode.\n\n**To Zhang the Daoist**\nA guest in life loves white clouds,\nYet half his years still cling to the red dust.\nThe name still lingers on the golden tablets,\nAnd now he meets the jade-rocked sage of the *Máo*’s heights.\n\n**To Daoist Zhang Míngzhēn**\n*Liú Dàbēn*\nDull and serene, your bearing simple yet vast,\nYou dwell in a hut, seeking truth on the *Dà Máo* peak.\nSitting in forgetfulness, worldly cares should fade,\nYet the Dao’s path makes even words seem sluggish.\nA thousand miles’ trust arrives by crane’s flight,\nA single stove’s smoke and fire, the monkeys tend in lieu.\nWhen shall you return to serve the *Xūhuáng*’s carriage,\nWrapped in seven-hued robes, the nine-colored dragon’s kin?\n\n**Visiting Máo Mountain**\n*Téng Zōngliàn*\nWithin *Jǔqū*’s mountain lies an ancient *Dòngtiān*,\nGold halls and jade chambers linked by earthly fate.\nWhen the lotus seeds reveal the day’s falsehood,\nYou’ve already passed the *Máo*’s lord’s years of attainment.\n\n**To Zhang Míngzhēn**\n*Wáng Suí*\nYour *qi* refined, your face like cinnabar’s glow,\nYou hide in the clouds beside the *Dà Máo* peak.\nThe *Zhìrén*’s morning ritual passes on the numinous key,\nThe *Xiān*’s emperor once watched the dragon and bestowed his song.\nThe sacred scriptures lie asleep beneath the path’s grass,\nThe divine forms play in the pool’s waves, serpentine and slow.\nI shame myself—five steeds bring me from the dust’s embrace,\nYet one breath of the *xiān*’s wind is fortune enough.\n\n**Huáyáng Welcomes Guests**\n*Hú Sù*\nA humble guest in *Huáyáng*’s retreat,\nYears pass unmarked in mountain seclusion.\nIn wine, the sage’s presence lingers,\nYet at the board, not a trace of the *xiān*.\nI’ve mastered the *Guǎnglíng*’s scattered notes,\nAnd transcribed the *Qiūshuǐ*’s scroll.\nMy cap still bears no cleansing,\nShame fills the old groves and springs.\n\n**Ascending the Máo Peak (Three Poems)**\n*Wáng Ānshí*\nOne peak rises above all others’ heights,\nAs if the dusty road were thousands of miles apart.\nGazing down, the mists and clouds come not to their end,\nClimbing up, the vines and cranes leave no trace before.\nThey ask who has replaced the *Jiāpíng*’s sovereign,\nWho in the earth now knows of *Jǔqū*’s *Dòngtiān*?\nThe *Chén*’s border’s strife now grows wild with weeds,\nWhile the common crowd still clings to the master’s teachings.\nWith staff and sandals, I escape the clamor’s din,\nNo rooster’s crow, no dog’s bark—only silence remains.\nI seek the five *Zhī*’s stalks, their leaves now aged,\nYet still climb toward the three *Hè*’s distant flight.\nThe *Róngxī*’s shadow turns along the winding path,\nWhen the *xiān*’s wind blows, I fall like a woodcutter’s axe.\nAfter my exhilaration fades, the sun slants low,\nI return with sluggish steps, grinding moss for the past.\n\nI trace the vines until the path reaches midsky’s end,\nBelow, the *Máo*’s state lies lost in mist.\nThe true leisure of the *Wùwài* comes in few moments,\nYet men’s questions of honor I leave to *Língtōng*.\n\nWhere white clouds sit, the dragon’s pool vanishes,\nWhen the bright moon returns, the crane’s carriage is empty.\nLooking back, which of the three sages is truer?\nThe *Zǐfáng*’s lineage holds the highest wind.\n\n**Inscription on Xu’s Drill Marks Found on a Stone in Máo Mountain**\nA hundred years of wind and rain dim the moss,\nYet *Nán Táng*’s hand still lingers here.\nOnly fear that the stone’s fate shall end like its carvings,\nAs autumn’s west wind burns them all away.\n\n**Paying Homage to the Marvelous Daoist Master During His Noonday Sleep**\n*Zhāng Fāngpíng*\nOne pillow of pure wind stirs the quiet hall,\nCourtyard pines and cypresses shade in tangled gloom.\nNow the inner vision eludes all but the few,\nThe moon in the *níhuán*, the sun within the heart.\n\n**The Left-Nuanced *Cuì* Before the Jade Morning Hall**\n*Yáng Jié*\n*Huáyáng*’s mountain enfolds a thousand *guì*,\nYet one stands left-nuanced before the *Yùchén*’s hall.\nIts rainbow branches and dragon-like trunk face the morning glow,\nIts stature rivals the *sāng*’s, enduring through the ages.\n\n**The Golden *Cuì* at Bózhōu’s *Wō* Water: The Tàiqīng Palace**\nOld Master *Lǎozǐ* planted this tree in the ninth year’s spring,\nA single *guì* now shares its kindred root.\nIts stem is firm, its roots run deep—it should not wither.\nI know this blessed land holds sacred wood,\nPlanted once by the *Shàngzhēn*’s own hand.\nHave you not seen the dragon rise from flames,\nThe tiger born in water’s embrace?\nNature favors the left, not the right.\nAnd again—see how the *Tiānlún* turns left without cease,\nThe sun, moon, and five stars grind like ants.\nThe left-nuanced *guì* holds the Dao’s deepest truth,\nAnd those who grasp it shall not die.\n\n**Sending Master Dòngyuán Back to Máo Mountain (Three Poems)**\n*Cài Zhào*\nYour crimson banner flutters down from *Zǐqīng*,\nTo further refine your hidden Dao and mend your failing years.\nIf you meet the *Fāngzhàng* sage, he’ll surely greet you as elder brother,\nAnd from your satchel, the *Chìjiǎ*’s scroll shall emerge.\n\nThe *Chóngníng*’s new pavilion rises, cloud-linked,\nThe *Tiānzhuàn*’s seals float in the sky, their treasure-qi released.\nThe emperor sends the dragon’s host to guard it night and day,\nYet in the deep of the pool’s wind and rain, you return.\n\nOne hut once shared with the savage *Yǐnmán*,\nAncient trees hang with vines through years untold.\nPerhaps this is the *Sānshēng*’s law of dwelling,\nI’ll follow the staff’s twist and seek you again.\n\n**The Three *Máo*’s Wind and Rain (Illustration)**\nThe brush asks of the clouds to birth bold strokes,\nThe paper listens—can the pines’ voices be heard?\nI’ve captured the Three *Máo*’s wind and rain,\nAnd in the high hall, June’s chill is like an icy jar.\n\n**Gift to Wáng Quán (With Preface)**\n*Gōng Yuán*\nQuán, styled *Zǐzhēn*, guest of the *Fùjìng*’s lord.\nIn the *Yuánfēng* era, he was granted the title *Chōngzhào Chùshì*.\nIn the *Yuánsù*’s third year, he followed Master *Liú* to receive the *Shàngqīng Lù*.\n\n**Preface:**\nQuán, styled *Zǐzhēn*, was a guest of the *Fùjìng*’s lord.\nDuring the *Yuánfēng* period, he was honored with the title *Chōngzhào Chùshì*.\nIn the third year of *Yuánsù*, he studied under Master *Liú* and was initiated into the *Shàngqīng Lù*.\n\n**On the Sudden Opening of Huàyáng’s Convenient Gate**\nThe Convenient Gate of Huàyáng’s Cave opened one night—\nSince Left *Zǐ* entered the Palace of the Grotto,\nIt has remained sealed for a thousand years.\n\n**Huàyáng’s New Announcement: The Convenient Gate Opens**\nThe Convenient Gate of Huàyáng now stands revealed—\nSurely the High Ones have come to be recorded.\n\nAsk of the Jade Gate’s sands, near or far,\nYet none surpasses *Yuán Fàng* in Daoist talent.\n\n**To a Daoist Friend on Máo Shān**\n**Qiu Jùn**\nThe phoenix calls me to behold your virtue’s radiance,\nYet the pine and vine resist my heart’s compliance.\n\nA lone peak stands ten thousand *rèn* beneath the moon’s gaze,\nAn ancient hall—no one returns to its questions.\n\nI would aid *Táng* and *Yú* in opening the Way,\nYet deeply ashamed, I forget the Teachings of Máo and Xù.\n\nTomorrow again I’ll raise my light sail,\nWhile the purple wood grows fat year after year in vain.\n\n**On Máo Shān**\n**Chén Fǔ**\nThe *Jījīn* Peak’s summit stands as a screen,\nA treasure pavilion suspended in layered rainbows.\n\nThe crane’s carriage comes and goes to Máo and Xù’s halls,\nWhile the dragon’s feast gathers at Guō Yáng’s estate.\n\nFrom the Celestial Caverns, men appear like jade,\nIn the dusty world, all is but hempen triviality.\n\nI was once a fellow of the *Fāngtái*,\nSo let us seek the path home and plant clouds’ seeds.\n\n**Xiàpò Gōng**\nThe *Lónghǔ* of Xiányáng ascended here,\nAnd my second brother, bound to Shùshān’s Dao, succeeded.\n\nNo trace remains of the *Tánglí* Hall of the *Sìmìng*,\nOnly the *Dānjǐng*’s clear pool lingers.\n\n**Yùlán**\nThe prefect’s northern veranda teems with bamboo,\nYet the recluse’s southern cave lacks flowers.\n\nOn the western path of *Lánqiáo*, green stretches—\nI’ve picked a *jué’ér* child like a tiger’s fang.\n\n**Song of the *Zhīmù* with Preface**\n**Zhōu Bāngyàn**\nThe Daoist *Lú Zhìróu* obtained a *zhī* root growing from wood,\nThe wood itself rising from stone, its roots entwined beyond severing.\nBy the *Báihè* Temple’s side, an axe felled it—\nYet it remained as firm as metal and stone.\n\nI, *Bāngyàn*, begged *Lú* for it and carried it to *Shòuchú Wén*:\nThe heavens of Huàyáng hold countless grotto palaces,\nWhile the *Āxué* Convenient Gate hides in obscure places.\nThe Three *Máo*’s audience with the Emperor never returned,\nLeaving only the *Línglíng* Shrine’s abandoned crane feathers.\n\nThe *Yùjīn*’s precious qi long girds the waist,\nWhile the *Língmù*’s divine *zhī* occasionally emerges from the earth.\nThe sun’s essence secretly illuminates its own clarity,\nYet human effort exhausts itself in vain pursuit of the numinous.\n\nLast year, the *liǎnnuò* was made into a new palace,\nIts hollow cliffs echoing with axe and adze.\nYou came, and the brooding fowl danced in sea-snow,\nYou left, and the mountain clouds mingled with river rain.\n\nThis *zhī* was born from crimson grass to awaken the dusty world,\nSo the woodcutter was sent into the wilds to seek it.\nIts sap is like purple lacquer, its bark as firm as iron,\nBeneath it, the *Tiānsu* winds around the rocky basin.\n\nMortal men fear strange calamities may arise,\nYet the medicine chest worries over divine things being taken.\n\nThe governor of *Lúlíng* harbors Daoist winds,\nHis sturdy bones and pure mien yearn for flight.\nHis hidden virtue has cured the crippled with joy,\nAnd his sacred herbs have prolonged life—heaven grants it.\n\nI wish to take the elixir and sever worldly desires,\nYet I do not yield to *Nánhú*’s Master of Nourishment.\n\n**Huàyáng Cave**\n**Zhāng Shāngyīng**\nThe white tiger treads the rainbow on violet mist,\nHow often I’ve seen the sea turn to mulberry fields.\n\nAfter seeking the *Zhēn* at *Chìchéng*’s jade shoots,\nI’ve reached Huàyáng’s eighth heaven once more.\n\n**On the Southern Cave of Máo Shān**\n**Zhāng Gāng**\nWith a purple sash and gold seal at eighty-three,\nMy decayed frame no longer suits my old official title.\nAsk you to write me as a retired rustic,\nSitting in wild garb upon the green rock.\n\n**Sending the Crane Back to Qíyún**\n**Zhāng Fǔ**\nWho sent the embryo-ascended one to the dusty world?\nAll day, he sings clear verses with my leisure.\n\nHe does not dream of soaring beyond the clouds,\nYet I suspect he carries arrows to aid the *Qīng*—\nTo chase the *Luán*’s carriage on misty peaks,\nWould he linger in the *Jītiān*’s ranks?\n\nTell Qíyún to take this well,\nFor in years to come, I’ll seek *Hàoshān*’s heights.\n\n**To Huàyáng’s Master**\n**Cài Biàn**\nMaster arrives at Huàyáng’s Cave,\nIts flowers bloom again and again.\n\nThe roots must always save the world,\nYet it sends mortals away.\n\n**Parting Bǎoguāng Master for Yùchāng**\n**Zhāng Jiān**\nThe Western Hills call me to join your light ascent,\nAnd the upper hall detains you to nurture your return.\nDo not rise to worldly farewells,\nFor when we meet again, both will be youthful.\n\n**The Crane Temple’s Pine**\nThe idle picker of *wèilíng* harmed its roots,\nAnd half the tree withered.\n\nWho planted the hundred-*zhàng* ladder of the flying immortal?\nThe wind shattered it, the rain broke it—\nYet past men were not to blame.\n\nTo whom shall I convey this to *Yáng* the Prefect?\nPreserve the shoot’s branch for *Lìngwēi*’s return.\n\n**Máo Shān in the Rain**\nSparse mist and rain clear by morning,\nYet the floating clouds refuse to disperse.\nTell the grotto spirits not to halt their journey—\nNow, guests of the cave have returned to plow.\n\n**Huàyáng’s Southern Cave**\n**Zhōu Wénpǔ**\nI bow to the *Língshān*’s numinous peak,\nAnd speak of entering Huàyáng.\n\nThe Southern Cave’s wonders are extreme,\nIts deep pines and fragrant springs.\n\nA curved desk holds exquisite calligraphy,\nAnd giant stones bear inscribed divine texts.\n\nI tilt my head to the cloud gate,\nWhile the *língfēng*’s breeze dissolves my robes.\n\nThe recluse’s hermitage reveres guests,\nAnd warms me with the purple wood’s broth.\n\nHe leaves me *éyǎn* coins,\nSaying they were hidden in the cave.\n\nOnce, seekers of the profound entered,\nAnd saw a golden wall.\nGreed may have already arisen,\nNearly meeting a strange ghost’s assault.\n\nIf my mortal form should meet such fate,\nHow dare I lament like a tumbleweed in frost?\n\nI beg for but a square of land,\nTo build a quiet dwelling.\n\nMorning, I’ll don the *Shénzhī*’s diagram,\nEvening, I’ll test the *Fànfāng*’s elixir.\n\n**The *Jīnnióu* Cave**\nI descend the perilous ladder with caution,\nAnd sit at the deep well’s pivot.\n\nI turn my body to avoid the clouds and mist,\nAnd lie facing the sun and moon.\nThe medicine sprouts astonish with their protection,\nWhile the bamboo roots delight the *Xuān* clan.\n\nWho knew beneath the hidden *dì*’s salt,\nSuch wondrous peaks would rise?\n\nThe *Jīnnióu*’s light gleams,\nAnd the immortal records may yet be read.\n\nThe hill’s spring has passed its halfway mark,\nThe *gǒuqǐ* berries like drops of blood.\nI fear the toppling wind will stir,\nAnd blow the cliffs apart.\n\n**Three Poems to a Daoist Friend of Huàyáng**\nServing the Three *Máo*’s through a lifetime,\nMy foolish heart still hopes for the *Yùchē*’s arrival.\n\nOnce, I planted *Huánglóng*’s children with my hands,\nNow I understand how to carry clouds into the *Tàiqīng*.\n\nThe *Jiǔxì* Stele’s pavilion is sun-drenched,\nWhile the recluse sits slumped before the furnace’s blackness.\n\nWho will thank *Huán* the *Sīmǎ* for me?\nIn *Jùqǔ*’s mountains, only white *lěi* can be bought.\n\n**With a Feather Fan at the Mysterious Orchard**\nThe *Nǐcháng*’s silks ascend the altar,\nWhile the *Líshāng*’s robes dance on the sacrifice platform.\n\n**Nine-Branched Pine Leaves, Thousand-Petaled Plum Blossoms**\nNine-branched pine leaves rustle bright,\nA thousand plum blossoms fade in flight.\n\nAt **Yùchén Guan**, the wind howls—\nThe *Chángshǐ* ascends to Heaven’s court,\nWhile the *Xiānwēng* recluse clutches his sword’s grave.\n\nBefore the **Ruìxiàng Hall**, the lost horse’s tracks remain,\nAnd the **Huànlóng Pool** echoes with the cry of a *áo* [tortoise].\n\n**On the Road, Gazing Back at Máo Mountain**\nA perilous pavilion bears the name *Yǔshān*,\nAs the setting sun leans on the *Fúgōu*’s hook.\nThe white crow waits, poised like a drawn bow.\n\nLast year, I climbed the *Jí*’s heights,\nThrough the *Yuánsù* pass, where day’s call fades.\nThe caves exhale spring’s chill,\nWhile the hollow’s door yawns with quiet.\n\nAh, the venerable master!\nHis house built where clouds and rain converge.\nYet for the moth’s slaughter, he could not rise—\nNo dragon’s phoenix to bear him aloft.\nHis body shed its husk,\nHis old palace burned to ash.\nNow half his *bì* [cinnabar] remains,\nA thousand pillars uphold the *Xuán* altar.\n\nThus, with two paths unborrowed,\nHe delved deeper into *Zhuānruǎn*’s [recluses’] lore.\nEntering the hall, he sought the *Yùfǔ*’s axe,\nAnd plucked the *zhī* [herbs] to cast into the *Jīnhuán* [ring].\nThe inkwell’s waves seal script,\nWhile the *Dāntái*’s *qi* swirls in a spiral.\n\nHe kowtows to the *Dà Sīmìng*,\nHis unbound hair green against the mountain.\nTwo lords command cranes,\nBoth donning *Hàn Xiǎoguān* [Han-style] caps.\n\nWhen shall I join their flight?\nA fleeting vision—Dao’s gaze returns.\nYet worldly bonds still drag me back,\nAs the alchemy cauldron threatens to boil over.\n\n---\n**At Yànkǒu Cave**\n*Yànkǒu*’s dragon’s breath clears the air,\nWhere *Qián Zhēn*’s lingering spirit lingers.\nAfter the immortal brother departed, the master remains,\nAnd when the sister returns, the cave has grown broad.\nThe cloud-leaves still shimmer like white silk,\nWhile the spring’s voice endlessly chants the *Huángtíng* [classic].\n\nThe *bìtáo* blossoms bloom purple at *Jǔpú*,\nLeft for mortals to paint on screens.\n\n---\n**Visiting Yīn Gōng at Yùchén Guan**\n*Máo Yǒu* [Friend Mao]:\nOnce I saw you descend in a flat-bottomed boat,\nThe wind lifting your jade sleeves—\nA mortal turned Daoist.\nYou’ve traversed the *Ruòshuǐ* [Weak Water] thirty thousand *lǐ*,\nYet met *Cháng’ān*’s five hundred years anew.\nGrowing old, you’ve learned to find joy wherever you are,\nThough this life still owes me sleep unpaid.\nMáo Mountain’s wood grows old—\nLet virtue spur your talent.\nDepend on elixirs and herbs,\nLest you linger in emerald shades.\n\n---\n**Following the Rhyme**\n*Wèng Yànshēn*:\nHearing of the Three *Máo*’s Five *Dòng*’s gates,\nThe Daoist comes and goes on wind-borne flight.\nNo mortal steps may tread the *qí*’s [unicorn’s] path,\nNor ask the tortoise’s age in ancient pines.\nBy chance, we meet by the river’s mist,\nAnd by the rocks, we dream by the stream’s side.\nI, a descendant of *Tiānzhù*’s line, grow old,\nWhile *Jùqǔ*’s clear games merge with green.\n\n---\n**A Spontaneous Poem While Traveling Máo Mountain**\n*Zhōu Língdà*:\nA thousand peaks rise from *Lìyáng*,\nTheir force like a southwest charge.\nThey bow to the Three *Máo*’s summit,\nDaring not to press the *Zhūnyún*’s [Sovereign’s] glory.\nThe Three *Máo* hang like a *xuān* [carriage],\nTheir order strict as brothers.\nTo the west, the *Yítú* road splits,\nWhere the grass-immortal’s gate stands.\nEven now, the *Xiàbó Gōng*’s [Lower Palace] echoes,\nWith banners still fluttering in the breeze.\n\n---\n**Sending Zhang Dá Dao Back to the Mountain**\n*Zhào Rú*:\nBorrowing a day from red dust’s toil,\nYour wondrous words pierce the *Yōuguān*’s [Misty Pass] depths.\nWho knew reclining at the desk was like *Nángé*’s [South Gate’s] retreat?\nI, too, am ashamed to draft verses for *Běishān*’s [North Mountain’s] return.\nThe wind favors my stay,\nYet the moon accompanies you back.\nIf the Three *Máo* inquire of my fate,\nTell them I wander *Xiāoyáo*’s [Carefree] skies.\n\n---\n**Dwelling at Báibái An**\n*Lǚ Jiāng*:\nA thousand bamboos frame the gate,\nTwo paths split at the cliff’s edge.\nThe rushing spring scatters moonlight,\nTall trees block the wandering clouds.\nThe traveler grows weary, longs to rest,\nWhile the Daoist speaks little of the world.\nOnly *Qín Xuéshì* [Qin the Scholar] once met *Máo Jūn* here.\n\n---\n**A Year of *Gēngzǐ*’s Eve, Visiting Máo Mountain**\n*Yóu Kuò*:\nBreaking winter’s chill to set out,\nThis eve marks the year’s end.\nA cold wind drives the *liú* [wagon],\nEscorting me to the *Qīngdū*’s [Pure Capital’s] heights.\nThe Eighth Heaven of *Huàyáng*,\nWhere the saints of Dao reside.\n\nThe cave’s mouth is narrow, yet spacious within,\nLike a hall for mortals to dwell.\nBefore it, the great river flows,\nA single *yú* [fish] passage through the dusty world.\nTo the right, the *Wànshí Lín* [Ten-Thousand Stone Forest]\nStands in a jade-green diagram.\nThe *Máo’ān*’s depths are lush and refined,\nWith winding paths of emerald green.\nThe hidden spring greets visitors with joy,\nAs if it, too, seeks to escape the mundane.\n\nThe mountain’s sun soon burns the traveler,\nAs swift paths lead to *Yuánsù*.\nThe *Lín Gōng*’s halls gleam with gold and jade,\nWhile Heaven’s melodies hum through the *shūyù* [tubers].\nGlancing at the *Bái Yún* peak,\nI face the *Chìshā Hú*’s red sands.\nThe *Jīntán* [Golden Platform] towers a hundred *zhàng*,\nWith seven shadowed tunnels beneath.\nGazing down, the world seems a teeming worm’s nest.\nEarlier, my coarse nature was unworthy,\nYet I bore the *Chìchéng*’s [Red City’s] talisman.\nHow could I have known my former green [virtue]?\nNow I stand at the gods’ sacred ground.\nAll my life, I’ve dreamed of this place,\nAs if I’d walked the *Huáxū*’s [Hua Xu’s] path.\nReturning, I bow to the *Lǜ Zhāng* [Green Talisman],\nMy strength still lingering.\nSixteen halls of treasure—\nHow could I wander them all?\nMy exploration ends in regret,\nAs I sigh and hesitate.\n\n---\n**Three Poems to the *Huàyáng Dòng*’s Spirit**\n*Yóu Jiǔyán*:\nThe *Héhàn* [Milky Way] clears,\nThe azure sky brightens.\nThe Nine-*Huá* immortal descends to mortal dust,\nBlowing a jade flute on the frozen mountain,\nAs wispy clouds unroll—\nThe moon stands clear.\nThe dew glistens on the grass,\nCrystalline and bright.\nGazing down, the earth is all *yáomǎ* [jade],\nWhile the lower realm’s thousand gates lie still,\nAnd the empty mountain hums with the sea’s voice.\n\nThe immortal departs,\nHer cloud-path vanishing.\nThe wind’s sighs echo with her jade pendants,\nAs she turns to gaze—\nThe *Zhōujiū*’s mist swirls,\nAnd the white *Qīānshān*’s moon casts long shadows.\n\n---\n**The Great Máo Jūn’s Statue**\n*Zēng Jí*:\nHis face like jade, cold and smooth,\nHis unbound hair cascades like dry leaves.\nHad I not seen him atop *Dà Máo*’s peak,\nMortals would mistake him for *Fúxī* [Fuxi].\n\n---\n**To Master Wēn Zūnshī**\n*Zhào Shīxiù*:\nHow many times have I inscribed letters to the mountain?\nI know not where to find them read.\nThe bramble-moss hums on the autumn stones,\nWhile I kneel in the *Tánzhōng*’s [Altar’s] stars.\nThe crane changes its name—\nYet you have not arrived.\nThe broken stele’s carvings\nAre hard to decipher.\nI recall your desire to seek you out,\nAnd plant the *zhī* [herbs]—\nEnough to feast upon.\n\n---\n**Mountain Travel**\n*Tāng Zhìdào*:\nClimbing vines through the green ravine,\nA wild deer flees the field’s edge.\nA crow drops mountain fruit,\nInto the deer’s resting place.\n\n---\n**To Shùnshān Rén**\n*Liú Zǎi*:\n*(No specific text provided for translation.)*\n\n**To Elder Brother Wēn Zūnshī**\n*Zhào Shīxiù*:\nYour *xīngguān* [celestial crown] gleams with adorned majesty,\nWhile your new acceptance of *guānqián* [official stipend] grants you freedom to return.\nYet I, ashamed before the Three Teachings’ [Sanmao] aged kin,\nHave spent a lifetime eating wood and clad in grass.\n\n---\n\n**Mountain Excursion with My Nephews**\n*Chén Xù*:\nThe southern paths wind half toward azure skies,\nYet our bond was never one of common folk.\nThe jade-like [floating] home of my ancestors startles me—\nA dream of hidden cinnabar [alchemical elixir] recalled in the *zhīcǎo* [herbs] of Teachings’ [Sanmao] peak.\nThe mountain’s summit hosts a Daoist guest who departs like a yellow crane,\nWhile the stone’s surface harbors sacred roots that flee as emerald serpents.\n\nI’ve heard tales of the Western Garden’s wild, unkempt grasses—\nYet the tiny willow you’ve nurtured already surpasses a nest’s embrace.\n\n---\n\n**Teachings’ [Sanmao] Mountain**\n*Yáng Zhìzhí*:\nThe jade lungs float empty, hence my name of *Shān* [Mountain].\nThe Five Gates [of immortality] do not lock—*Dòngtiān* [the Cavernly Heaven] is boundless.\nPurple blossoms may be eaten as autumn’s *xúnmù* [medicine wood] is sought,\nYet red flames cannot be buried—even at night the cinnabar [elixir] is revealed.\n\nA single ox is painted where the water’s grassy plain begins,\nThree cranes alight, each perched on its own peak.\nThe traces of the Daoist are silent, lost in the lofty winds—\nWho will point out the elder’s forehead marks for me?\n\n---\n\n**Sending Book Recorder Liú to Teachings’ [Sanmao] Mountain to Visit the Southern Peak**\n*(Unattributed, likely Liu Zai)*\nI remember our shared dwelling in *Huáyáng* [Flower Fragrance],\nWhere the sky was clear and the purple wood [alchemical cinnabar] fragrant.\nNow you seek the empty mountain’s gates,\nWhile I, too, wander the Daoist path.\n\nGrass-dew soaks your double-layered sandals,\nA scroll of cinnabar script [alchemical texts] tucked in your linen sack.\nYou’ll climb *Zhùróng*’s [Zhurong’s] peak with joy,\nAnd offer red oranges to the *bóshāng* [mulberry] groves.\n\n---\n\n**Sending Master Lín the Daoist to Return to Teachings’ [Sanmao] Mountain**\n*Dèng Dàoshū*:\nMany years have passed since you served as Teachings’ [Sanmao] Mountain’s host,\nIn robes of hemp and coarse cloth.\nYour eyes discern the noble and the base,\nYet your heart refines—both form and spirit.\n\nYou’ve often been dispatched in armor [of ritual office],\nWhile kings and nobles could never claim you as their subject.\nNow you return late to *Huáyáng*’s [Flower Fragrance] cavern,\nAnd the *zhīcǎo* [herbs] have sprouted anew.\n\n---\n\n**Escorting Master Yùhǎi of the Dao to Return to His Mountain**\n*Zhào#5 Bóxiù*:\nThe lake’s muddy Daoist teachings have now ten years passed in quiet study,\nAnd the jade script’s [alchemical] mastery surpasses even the altar’s [Tánzhōng] worth.\nThe dust stirs—heaven’s moon obstructs the dragon’s [alchemical] outer realm,\nWhile in his later years, he gazes toward *Huáyáng* [Flower Fragrance] and the crane’s return.\n\nEntering the chant of *Wǔyì* [Five Exclamations] nears the cinnabar gates,\nMeeting in heart with *Sānyào* [Three Laughs] by the cold painted stream.\nThrough the world’s green, his Daoist connections have been thoroughly explored—\nNow he sits, alone, to guard the *Péizhēn* [Peaceful Perfection] at the Upper Pass.\n\n---\n**Teachings’ [Sanmao] Mountain Gazette, Volume 29 & 30**\n*(Annotations: #1 \"霞\" [mist] as \"cloud\" in the original; #2 \"载\" [years] as \"autumn\" in the original; #3 \"已\" [already] as \"just/right\" in the original; #4 \"迈\" [stride] as \"encounter\" in the original; #5 \"赵\" [Zhao] as \"Chu\" in the original.)*\n\nThe **Pure Clarity** successor of the Daoist Master, **Sū Dàbīn**, crafted the *Golden Safflower* compilation of **Yuan** poetry, with a preface to five poems on visiting **Sanmao** Mountain.\n\n**Lú Jiá** heard that the **Jǔqū** Mountain had long been known, and in the spring of the **Yuan Wù** year (1338), while overseeing the **Xian** district, inspecting **Lìyáng** Commandery, and surveying local customs, he found its ruins just a short distance from the mountain’s slopes. All who climbed its lofty peaks and winding streams—places called *Hanging Palaces* or *Blessed Lands*—were greeted by the prefectural officials, as was proper.\n\nAt that time, I undertook the **Three Teachings** pilgrimage, arriving at the so-called **Chóngxǐ** Observatory. The **Chóngxǐ** host, a man of the **Zou** clan, styled himself *Heart-Distant* and welcomed me into his refined retreat. His halls and chambers were grand as noble estates, their elegance profound and adorned with splendor. Passing through, one found pavilions extending like wings over streams, trees, bamboo, and rocks, making this mountain the most resplendent and unmatched of all.\n\nThe two of us wandered together, unaware of the sun’s descent. My distant teacher, his robes flowing, spoke with such clarity and wit that his discourse was most enchanting. He was also skilled in the arts, able to convey meaning through brushstrokes on plain silk, transforming mere objects into life. His painted cranes were so meticulously crafted that even the finest ancient calligraphers would find no flaw in them—yet his spirit and grace surpassed theirs, for he had learned from those beyond the ordinary. Thus, when we raised our cups, we celebrated his unparalleled talent.\n\nThe **Feathered Ones’** dwelling on the upper peak is called the **Yuanfú Wànníng** Palace, also known as the **Zōngtán**. The **Zōngtán** Master, **Xǔ Yì**, invited me to be the **Divine Clarity** guest, and with cup in hand, he summoned the boundless void, lamenting that those who had once hidden here could not be found, and that the **Danqiu** would no longer join us in our wanderings.\n\nDescending to the **Huáyáng** caves, I saw the **jade grease** pool still, the **stone hair** bristling like pincers, trickling streams rushing into deep ravines, carrying floating blossoms along. Passing the **Jìkè** Spring, its waters clear as a polished mirror, it seemed to hold a great stone pestle above it, as if scooped from a well a few *zhang* wide and half *chǐ* deep, encircled by four ropes and sealed with a stone collar, its opening guarded with utmost care. We piled **dòuxiāo** reeds to mark its sacredness, and when guests arrived, the spring’s joy mirrored theirs—its boiling froth like the **Han** River’s birth, as if leaping from a clam’s shell to pierce the **Dragon’s Beard**—so abundant it could not be counted. We called it the *Spring’s Laughter*; otherwise, it would not be. How strange!\n\nWhy should I be mocked? I returned to rest at my distant teacher’s abode. The mountain’s visitors had already stayed many nights, and the host’s hospitality showed no sign of waning. I, unable to contain my delight, composed poems and wrote this farewell preface to leave behind.\n\n---\n\n**On the Road: A Light Breeze Scatters the Thin Shade,**\nThe **jade flute** calls as we pass through **Huá** Forest.\nWithin the mountain, who is the **prime minister** now?\nAt dusk, the **blue peaks** resound with **chicken and dog** sounds.\n\nBy the ravine’s **jade grasses**, in the cave’s blossoms,\nFine waters flow in spring, bearing **green sands**.\nLast night, the **mountain gourd** wine was just fermented—\nThe **Daoist** had no time to read the *South Hua*.\n\nAt the **bamboo tips**, a **flying pavilion** rests on the **stone spring**,\nWhile on the **pine platform**, **fragrant mists** chase the **tea smoke**.\nThe **crow’s cry** recalls the night’s rain,\nThe **deer’s dream** startles—another realm has opened.\n\nA **far traveler** comes to visit the **bearded dragon**,\nThe **virtuous recluse** paints for those who love such things.\nThe *Laughter Scroll* gathers **cloud and mist** away,\nLong may the **ink-stone** teach beneath the **three peaks**.\n\nThe **mountain lord**, pleased with my visit, thus sends\nThe **clear spring’s laughter** without end.\n\nA **ten-thousand-hu** pearl and a **three-foot jade**,\nI must take them with me when I cross **Xuan** State.\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for Master Zou’s Pine-Crane Painting**\n\nWith **powdered cinnabar** and **aloft brush**, his strokes hold divine spirit—\nThe **Daoist**, dreamless, reaches the **chicken and dog** sounds.\nWhen will the **venerable guest of the village** arrive, his beard ashen?\nThen let him summon **Sanmao**’s ten thousand miles of clouds.\n\n---\n\n**Gazette of Sanmao Mountain and Its Preface**\n\nIn the **Yuan Wù** year (1338), as the old year ended, I returned to **Sanmao** Mountain.\nOn the **first day of the first month**, in the **Year of the Tiger** (1339), I performed the **ritual of purification** and at dawn climbed the **Heavenly Market** Platform. Then, with the **Chóngxǐ** host, I ascended the **Jījīn** Peak, lingered to drink at the **Sōngxī** **Fāngzhāng** Pavilion, and finally returned to my distant teacher’s **jade qi**-infused chamber.\n\nThe **sea breeze** blows at dawn over the **three upper mountains**,\nMy hands grasp the **auspicious season’s** beauty—how satisfying!\nBy chance, I meet the **Daoist** on the **New Year’s** first day,\nUnknowing of the world’s **spring cold**.\n\nAt the **plum’s edge**, my staff and sandals follow its scent,\nIn the **cloud’s realm**, the **pavilions** gleam like **jade railings**.\nA **cup of peppered flowers** from time immemorial,\nWhen drunk, I ride a **crane** to ask of **elixir’s** refinement.\n\n**Four days after New Year’s**, I leave farewell to the **Zōngtán** Master **Xǔ** and **Zou** *Heart-Distant*.\n\n**Frosted robes**, the **pilgrim** returns once more—\nNot only the **green mountains** ease his longing thoughts.\nThe **throat-pass** holds the **yellow-crowned** sage,\nHalf able to sing my **Steps in the Void**.\n\nBeside the **blue stream**, wind and sun veil our questions,\nUrging me to gaze at the **plum blossoms** wrapped in **mirror-like** frost.\nDo not grieve the **morning carriage’s** solitude too deeply,\nFor the **fragrant jade** still lingers to brighten the **spring chill**.\n\nAt the **mountain’s peak**, the **Feathered Ones** gather at dawn,\nTheir strides crushing the **blue clouds**, ascending the **North Dipper’s** ladder.\nBy chance, I lodge with **Sanmao’s** lord at the **rock’s foot**,\nThen follow the **monkeys and cranes** across **Sōngxī**.\n\nIn my **sleeves**, the **cinnabar sand**,\nBeneath my **feet**, the **clouds**—\n**Emperor Yao’s** era, the **first cycle of the Jiazi**,\nThe **Han** dynasty’s spring.\n\nNow, my **wandering dreams** at **Jǔqū**,\nNo longer the **recluse of commerce** who shuns the world.\nI bow to the **clouds** and part with **Xǔ** the guest,\nReturning beneath the **moon** to visit my distant teacher.\n\n**Midnight’s bamboo whispers** drive me away,\nAgain, the **lonely winter branches** labor for my sake.\n\n**Composed for Master Xǔ of Sōngxī’s Zōngtán**\n\n**Chén Jūn**\n\nThe **Jījīn** heights embrace the **bearded sage**,\nBelow, the **deep pure waters** guard the **stone chamber**.\nThe **thirsty tiger** swiftly prowls the **fragrant woods** for **amber**,\nThe **crouching tortoise** follows the **crane** into the **Stagnant Waves**.\n\nThe **startling tides** on both banks become **cold rain**,\nThe **bright moon** over a **single expanse** flows **emerald frost**.\nIt seems like sitting on the **Nine-Tiered Terrace**,\nWhere the **empty green** stretches—tree after tree, the **round light** falls.\n\n**Ascending Great Sanmao Peak**\n\n**Liáng Dòng**\n\nWith **plum staff**, I climb to the **absolute summit**,\nThe **green mountains** vie with the **world’s paths** in ruggedness.\n**Blue clouds** block the **heaven’s eye** beyond the peaks,\nThe **spring wind** ages the **questioning heart**.\n\nThe **Great Lord** ascends to **Heaven**, his **treasured sword** transformed,\nThe **little dragon** plunges into the **sea**, its **bright pearl** lost.\nNo one remains to guard the **Celestial Emperor’s** **cauldron**,\nA guest would ask the **Qin Emperor’s** **golden elixir**.\n\nWho ponders the **precipice’s** toil?\nThe **ancient cave** is still too deep to explore.\n**Divine light** does not break the **darkness’s** vexation,\nThe **mountain spirit** vainly recites the *Separation Sorrows*.\n\nI come, gazing up and down, with a sigh—\nThe **mountains and rivers** were once fine; now, the **people** are the treasure.\n\n「How could one wish for **lofty pines** to prop the **Heavens and Earth**,\nTo gather the **Yánghuà** world beneath their layered shade?\nWith one long sigh, I descend from the mountain—\nLet the grasses and trees keep their **pure resonance** for me.\n\nAscending **Máo Mountain**,\nZhang Qí\nLong have I loathed the **courtly world**,\nMy heart dwelling in the **secluded valleys**.\nWhat day is today’s day but the last?\nHere, beneath this **bleak autumn peak**.\n\nThe **jade vault** is vast and empty,\nThe **wind’s harmonies** cold and crisp.\nIn my lifetime, I’ve seen **grand sights**,\nYet ten thousand miles yield but an inch to my gaze.\n\nAmid the **misty vapors** and **floating clouds**,\nI ask **Qīngyuán** of the **level fields**.\nOh, how **resplendent** are these **palaces**,\nPiercing the **cold cliff’s** rugged edge.\n\n**Máo Lord**, this **immortal** has departed—\nMy distant thoughts yearn for his **former cultivation**.\nWhy does his **dusty trace** linger so long?\nThe **ages and months** pass in vain.\n\nWhen shall I ride the **swift wind** in chaos,\nAnd traverse the **Eight Tablelands** as one?\nLost in contemplation, words cease,\nMy spirit sinks deep into the **mystic void**.\nLike the **luan** and **hè** of cranes and immortals,\nReturning to wander my old mountain home.\n\n**Joyful Guest Spring**\nIn days of old, I heard of the **Joyful Guest Spring**,\nNow come, I rejoice to see it.\nGazing down over the **balustrade** in quiet reverie,\n**Pearls and jade** brush the **clear pool**.\nThe **mountain spirit** harbors **divine elegance**,\nFrom whence this **world’s marvel** flows.\nAh, my time was bound by **forbidden constraints**,\nYet why does this spring bring **joy**?\n\nMy **sincere devotion** the **Heavens** alone know,\nLet this **favor** not be doubted.\n\n**Jìn Jié**\nThe **Jìn Dynasty’s** **august aura** has ended,\nThe **ashes of calamity**—how long till they fade?\nOnly this **lofty cypress** remains,\nIts **resilient spirit** and **virtuous bearing** ever firm.\nIts roots delve deep into the **thick earth**,\nIts branches soar to **Cloud River’s** height.\n**Wind and frost** have long tested its endurance,\n**Rain and dew** shower no **partial favor**.\nWith one smile, it **charms the age’s** splendor,\nYet peaks in the **morning** wane by the **evening**.\n\n「Yīnyáng Jǐng\nThe **Daoist Immortal’s** **refinement grounds** lie here,\nWhere **jade wells** **harbor divine

miles,\nNor must one read through every scroll in the world.\nI’d rather be a guest of Máo Mountain for ten days,\nWhere the mountain monk sits among the ranks of immortals.\n\nThe Great Peak loftily ascends beyond the Celestial Gate,\nThe Lesser Peak draws ten thousand steeds in flight.\nIn an instant, the waves shatter—\nWooden branches soar into the Golden Summit’s heights.\n\nThe Green Pavilion’s scrolls rush past in silent halls,\nJade whips strike the night, their echoes calling.\nLast year, I slept alone beneath the Vermilion Well,\nHeaven-winds swept the earth to greet Mǎgū.\n\nThis year, I’ve sworn to enter the Jade Pillar’s cave,\nWho sends the wayfarer’s meal with the mast’s raven?\nGrief for the past, mourning antiquity in lonely nights—\nThe cold river’s moon sinks as the gibbon howls.\n\nThe First Emperor’s gold lies buried, his *qi* spent,\nThe Liang palace and Jin gardens sink into smoke and weeds.\nI imagine the Cloud Forest basking in morning sun,\nA mountain minister—no fool, no idle man.\n\n**Ascending the Three Peaks**\n**Monk Zhìyuán**\nMáo’s son first took form—\nThe earth’s lungs divided into three.\nCrimson light flickers, hidden and revealed,\nStone paths spiral upward in reverse.\n\nThe Black Tiger howls beneath the clear moon,\nThe Spotted Dragon rides the violet mist.\nIf Master Táo were here, I’d ask of the Ordinary Year.\n\n**Ascending the Great Peak**\n**Monk Wéizé**\nWhite clouds are sheared into jade terrace snow,\nMorning sun steams open the jade cave’s blossoms.\nNorth and south peaks vie in splendor—\nEach wisp of cooking smoke marks an immortal’s home.\n\nThe Celestial Market leans against the emerald sky,\nThe Two Capitals’ mountains and waters fade into mist.\nTen *bèi* of wind and frost lie eastward,\nYet here, in the cold mist’s stroke, they’re but a breath away.\n\n**Visiting Táo Táng’s Pond, Asked by Sān Guàn**\nA single pine grove, another official’s domain,\nOpening doors to face Máo Peak’s heights.\nMy steps drift hazy along Lú Mountain’s path,\nThe monk divides the meal by the upper and lower bells.\n\n**Four Seasons of Cloud Forest’s Loneliness**\n**Féng Zǐzhèn**\nPetals scatter on stone paths like butterfly silk,\nBees vex the sunlit eaves, swallows steep in fragrant rain.\nWild peaches blush in scattered petals—\nWho taught them to lure the crane-immortal’s land?\n\nThe bamboo’s green nodes gleam after the rain’s fall,\nThe plum’s chill yields to the wheat’s light frost.\nThe peaks cut high and low through the trees—\nSuddenly, the second cock’s cry signals return.\n\nThe moon dampens the fireflies’ lazy smoke,\nThe southwest peak’s gap reveals the original field.\nNo need to summon Kūngshān’s waterfall—\nTen thousand *zhàng* of silver pour from the jade sky.\n\nJìapíng’s winter brew thirsts for the tea-kettle’s boil,\nWaiting till the Dragon Sand’s snow-water steeps.\nThe dance ends with the painted crane’s thousand-year wings,\nThe phoenix’s crimson returns to Fàn Zhōngshān’s life.\n\n**Joyful Spring**\n**Ní Tiānkuí**\nWhat god ordains this spring?\nThe guest arrives, and it rejoices.\nWhat has water to do with human affairs?\nIt is *qi*’s mechanism—watch the pearls turn endlessly,\nBirth and death dissolve without end.\n\nThe guest asks whence you come—\nLike thunder, you rise where it does.\n\n**Three Peaks, Three Poems**\n**Wáng Biǎnfú**\nThree peaks, brothers in rank—\nThis one alone stands supreme.\nThe Divine Constellation opens the Yellow Court,\nReceiving the Huái River’s rush.\n\nThe Canopy of Glory drapes the earth’s lungs,\nAzure mists embrace the Heavenly Root.\nI bow to the Great Marshal of Fate,\nBorrowing the cold wind’s swift flight.\n\nThe Great Peak’s shoulders press the sky,\nThe Middle Peak’s chest surges through the clouds.\nNo tree lacks ancient hue,\nEvery blossom bears immortal fragrance.\n\nGazing, I sweep the Huái’s plains,\nMy heart wanders, free of worldly dust.\nI vow to dust the Golden Hall’s table,\nFulfilling my vows with Máo’s Lord.\n\nThree divine lords stand atop the three peaks—\nThe Lesser Lord preserves the people’s lives,\nTen thousand spirits pay homage in rotation.\nThe wind clears the stone altar’s moon,\nThe sky nears the incense burner’s smoke.\nHow I wish to control the crimson crane,\nSoaring to meet the flying immortals.\n\n**Spring Day in the Mountains**\n**Chǔ Huánzhōng**\nSunward pine beneath the snow—dry earth,\nWild shoots urge spring onto the guest’s plate.\nOne sip of red spring’s elixir—\nThe bones renew; don’t let the wind repeat last year’s gaze.\n\n**Two Poems on the Autumn Altar Night**\nThe flowing silk unfurls through the night’s clouds,\nMoonlight reveals the peaks’ pavilions.\nA few lanterns wrap the sky’s sound—\nThe Three Truths return to the Emperor’s court.\n\nThe mountain encircles the Celestial Altar’s frost-bound osmanthus,\nThe Bull and Charioteer hang askew by the curved railing.\nBefore the golden bells’ chant finishes,\nThe incense ascends to the Morning Element at midnight.\n\n**Visiting Jījīn Peak to See the Daoist Liáng**\nFeathers shatter through the trees—\nThe sturdy carriage winds past the tilted stones.\nThe Daoist dwells near Máo Peak’s north,\nA cluster of towers bathed in five-colored clouds.\n\n**Two Poems Sent to Master Liú Zūntī in the Capital**\n**Jùsī**\nThe Celestial Script’s three summons called you from the mountains,\nSouthward, the Three Máo’s days have long passed.\nEach time you speak of fame, your *qi* falters,\nYet fine guests briefly lift your brows.\n\nHalf your days are spent on classics and music,\nYet lingering years only hasten time’s toll.\nLaughing, I ask the mountain’s recluse—\nFour years of wind and snow, mingling with dust.\n\nI know your intent—rarely heard in the world—\nYet fear the mountain gate will soil the white clouds.\nFāng Shù could not abandon the Han sovereign,\nLǚ Lián once turned back the Qin army.\nNo more heroes dream of my lifetime,\nFortunately, immortals grant undying merit.\n\nWhen will imperial favor fulfill your return?\nGreen mountains hold many places to honor Máo’s Lord.\n\n**Sending Master Yùxū Zhōngshī Back to the Mountains from the Capital**\n**Wú Shàn**\nThe Daoist wears wild deer-hide, his crown of leaves,\nOnce sworn to Máo’s Lord on the violet crane.\nEven now, the wind and dew beyond the heavens are fine—\nAsk the guest where the waters and clouds widen.\n\nThe trees’ shadows hide the scripture’s couch,\nThe forest’s blossoms tremble on the stone altar.\nI’d hasten to your return boat beneath the vast sky,\nYet the wind’s flight and jade pendants defy grasp.\n\n**Same Theme**\n**Yuán Míngshàn**\nJùqū’s heights quell the Chu’s mist,\nThe immortal ancestor, Great Máo’s Lord.\nThe distant sky’s crane sings in autumn’s moon,\nThe deep gorge’s dragon draws the night’s clouds.\n\nThe divine furnace’s light glows in the pine and osmanthus hall,\nThe wine cup’s spring color mirrors Xuānxi’s watercress.\nSince waiting for the *sháo* years in the Western Pavilion,\nThe stone’s hair, combed fragrant, dreams of hearing.\n\n**Inscribed on Master Yáng Zhēnrén’s Calligraphic Copy of the *Huángtíng Jīng* on Yellow Silk**\n**Zhào Mèngfǔ**\nA heart of jade and scripture—profound, profound,\nGold buttons, crimson silk—your transmission alone.\n\n「If you can attain it, you may live long years,\nThe yellow silk steadfastly preserves its fruit—unblemished and firm.\nIts horizontal threads like bound hair on both sides,\nFrom the very start, a red path runs like a crimson string.\n\nThe text weaves through questions, the dark moth of *Dao* flies free,\nThe clouds unfurl and roll in endless sequence.\nThe Great Dao is smooth, not forced by strength,\nEffortless, yet naturally profound in its reason.\n\nWho can focus with precision and transform marrow to bone?\nThen the dust of the mind’s window shall not sully or stain.\nEyes that hold the divine essence know the True—\nWhite jade becomes the morning robe, borne by the carriage.\n\nWrapped in celestial emerald weaves, complete,\nThe immortal’s tower abides, solemn in eternal life.\nThe *luán* and *què* birds dance midair, the monkeys frolic with lightness—\nIf you can attain it, take heed and do not startle.\n\nWithin the palace halls, the night itself is bright,\nThe True Persons of Upper Clarity—Yáng and Xǔ.\nBurning incense, keeping fasts to commune with the divine maiden,\nWith their own hands, they inscribed this text for those who dwell below.\n\nFor a thousand years, the scroll shall turn to serve you as master,\nBinding the Azure Dragon and the White Tiger in its frame.\nDo not beg for what is not yours, nor give what is not yours to take.\n\n**On the Daoist Retreat of Master Zhāng Suìzhēn at Jùqū Mountain**\nThe *Jùqū Wàishǐ* (张嗣真) learns the Dao at the Teachings of Lord Máo on Jùqū Mountain,\nWhere his dwelling, the *Xuánzhōu Jīngshè* (玄洲精舍), is surrounded by ancient traces of True Persons and immortals:\nThe *Rúshān* (菌山) with its three peaks, the *Luó Gū Dòng* (罗姑洞), the *Xiájì Hǎi* (霞架海),\nThe *Hètái* (鹤台), the *Xuánzhōu Tónghuá Yuán* (玄洲桐华源), the *Zǐxuān Huǒlù Tán* (紫轩火梡坛), the *Yǐnjū Sōng* (隐居松), and more.\nHe composed a small poem together with Zhào Mèngfǔ,\nTo record the place.\n\nIn the *Zhìzhì* era, the second year of the *Rénxū* cycle, on the twenty-third day of the fourth month,\nAt the Daoist Retreat by the river and the *Xuánzhōu* hall,\nReturning once more to Jùqū Mountain,\nHe dispatched scribes to carve this into stone,\nAs a testament to the mountain’s lore.\n\n**Rúshān**\nA spirit peak, three peaks in form,\nPurple clouds crown its summit.\n\n**Rúshān**\nI exchange my mortal frame for the Dao’s pure essence,\nWhile the great *zhuàng* tree marks the passage of years.\nZhang Sìzhēn builds his thatched hut by the spirit peak,\nBurning incense to await the mushroom’s canopy.\n\nThe True Ones, in mercy, grace me with their presence,\nTheir crowns and sashes appearing in my company.\n\n**Luó Gū Dòng**\nThe tale of this cave is recorded in the *Zhēn Gǔ*—\nA woman from Jiǔyí who attained the Dao,\nHer duties transferred, her home moved with ease.\nShe gifted a poem to Jīntiáo Tuō,\nAnd met a man named È Lǜhuá.\n\nZhang Sìzhēn\nIn the distant reaches of Chángwú’s sky,\nI’ve heard of a green-haired immortal.\nTurning back toward Huáyáng’s path,\nI ask: How long has this one lived—nine hundred years?\n\nZhào Mèngfǔ\n\n**Xiájì Hǎi**\nThe sun’s rays gleam like gold at the boundary,\nRainbow beams arch where phoenixes drink.\nThey seize the sky-child’s sleeve—\nCrows curse the river, filling it with their cries.\n\nZhang Sìzhēn\nAll waters converge in this ravine,\nHeaven’s light shines through the morning mist.\nAfter bathing in the dawn’s fresh glow,\nMy hair dries in the sun’s embrace.\n\nZhào Mèngfǔ\n\n**Hètái**\nIn the still night, the spirit wind stirs,\nThe Divine Lord speaks within my pavilion.\nTo this day, twin white cranes descend\nUpon the Five-Cloud Peak.\n\nZhang Sìzhēn\nAbove, white cranes take flight,\nBelow, a recluse dwells in seclusion.\nThe recluse’s Way will be fulfilled,\nThe cranes’ arrival is no empty sign.\n\nZhào Mèngfǔ\n\n**Tónghuá Yuán**\nThe grove’s pure light scatters like scattered clouds,\nThe crimson waters congeal like jade and fat.\nAutumn leaves fall without end—\nI, of Yúdū, am too lazy to send poems.\n\nZhang Sìzhēn\nWho planted this *tóng* tree here?\nIts verdant growth fills the secluded valley.\nThe phoenix’s cry has long been silent—\nWhen will it return to rest among us?\n\nZhào Mèngfǔ\n\n**Xuánzhōu Jīngshè**\n\n---\n\n**Hètái**\nThe scholar Zhōu Hóngràng of Liang inscribed upon Master Huán’s wall,\nYet his words were not distinct. \nLǐ Jī left behind his ancient tripod,\nZhào Xiào’s spirit vanished like wind and clouds.\nThrough the ages, their fame lingers—\nNow once more, it belongs to you, my Lord.\n\nZhào Mèngfǔ#18 **Zǐ Xuān**\nThe ethereal *qì* of the Purple Pavilion’s window,\nThe crimson script of ancient texts.\nI ask who dwells within this chamber—\nCould it be Lord Zǐyáng?\n\nZhāng Sìzhēn#19\n\nThe Master has ascended to the Dao,\nYet the Purple Pavilion’s name remains.\nAt times, its light shines like vermilion—\nBy night, the elixir’s cauldron ever glows warm.\n\nZhào Mèngfǔ#20\n\n**Máoshān Zhì** (Volume Thirty-One concludes) #1*Original omission; restored from the Pi edition.*\n#2*Diāo: originally „chī,“ corrected from the Pi edition.*\n#3*As seen in

endless, unknown.\n\n**Zhao Mengfu**\n*Sheltered in Pine Groves (Two Poems)*\n\nA dew-drenched altar nestled in divine shade,\nWhere celestial melodies descend, fragrant and pure.\nThree times my robe

flames with sacred might.\n\n**Zhao Mengfu**\n*Plowing Clouds, Hoeing Moon (Two Poems) to Jùqū Shānrén*\n\nI bought fields where the Spirit Mountain stands,\nWhere stones like sheep and grass abound.\nThe Creator plows for me—\nWhat he sows are clouds, all white and bound.\n\nThe surging earth first stirs in tumult,\nThen scatters in mist, a vaporous shroud.\nWhen I gather it into my palm,\nIt bursts as a five-hued scroll.\n\nWith a laugh, I turn to my kin,\nNo need to fret over empty hands.\nStone fields yield no grain—\nHow then shall I feed my clumsy hands?\n\nMidnight, I part the white clouds,\nRise to hoe the moon’s pale glow.\nThe moon has no roots, no stalk—\nIts light scatters frost like snow.\n\nMy hoe does not swing in vain,\nI seek to distinguish reed from thistle’s stain.\nAh, if only the Planting-Old-Man were here,\nWe’d stand together, both pure and clear.\n\n**Dreaming of Jùqū (Two Poems)**\n\nBamboo fences frame white sands,\nWhile the Purple Clearing’s halls rise through mist and flame.\nOne straight path home—my zither’s crimson string—\nThree hundred years, yet I’ve not reached my name.\n\nBeneath the Three Hua trees, I bow to the Blue Boy,\nWho tells me of the nine-fold cinnabar’s art.\nHad I met the King of the Western Ridge,\nOr met Laozi when he came to visit the Sage.\n\n**Responding to Hua Yang Daoist’s Poems (Four Poems)**\n*Sun Lìdào*\n\nThe Flying Spirit ascends to the Hooked Heaven,\nWheels of wind traverse the Purple Enclosure’s wall.\nTwice I kneel to the Three Sovereigns’ Lord,\nThe Emperor’s secret words revealed at last.\n\nTrue Void is silent, unspoken,\nThe Ultimate Way demands no labor.\nThe county knows of ancient men,\nWho grasp the Primordial Qi’s root.\n\nThe Golden Altar stands in Hua Yang’s grandeur,\nVast and open, a path to the Celestial Abode.\nAt dawn, I unfurl the Great Expanse’s scroll,\nAnd hoe the inch-wide field where weeds have grown.\n\nThe clamor of clams and shells gathers,\nYet men still ask why death remains the same.\nThe Old of Heaven speaks in silence,\nNine beams return the phoenix’s car.\n\nBefore Heaven’s birth, divine things existed,\nLong ensnared by desire’s tangled net.\nThrough kalpas, they vanish without trace,\nTheir light now suffuses the boundless sky.\n\nThey enter and leave through my brows and lashes,\nPlayful words in the midst of silent games.\nThe Six Uses merge into One,\nThe Great Demon attacks from within you.\n\nThe Holy Master pays homage to the Southern True One,\nUnrolling the jade scrolls of boundless grace.\nDan scripts trace the blue rafters,\nDragon-serpent characters slant in song.\n\nThe Rainbow Beam surveys the boundless Qi,\nThe Kun Mountain marks the heavens’ edge.\nWest winds lift the crane’s high back,\nThe return path fears no debt unpaid.\n\n**Late Spring Plans in the Mountains (To Jùqū Shānrén)**\n*Huáng Shí Wēng*\n\nPlum blossoms weep on the pines,\nThe mountain recluse sits in spring’s slow dusk.\nIs the stone spring not the Great Shao’s music?\nThe sunlight still holds the Honghuang’s hue.\n\nA bamboo basket, a staff of bamboo,\nWe speak through mist, our voices thin.\nGreen paper holds my cinnabar verses,\nWritten beneath the forest’s shade.\nI should thank the old scholar of Hangzhou,\nFor white clouds call—no return in sight.\n\n**In Harmony with Lǚ Guīméng’s Poems to the True One (Two Poems, with Preface)**\n*Yuàn Nán*\n\nIn years past, while serving in the Hall of Literature,\nI once drafted a decree for the Three Teachings’ Lord.\nRecently, Jùqū’s Outer Historian sent me\nLǚ Rùwàng’s two poems to the True One.\n\nIt is said that each year, on the twelfth of the twelfth month,\nThe Great Teachings’ Lord returns from Tian Tai to Mao Shan,\nAnd on the eighteenth of the third month, he returns again.\nRùwàng’s verses cover the twelfth month alone,\nYet the third month remains unspoken.\nI dare not presume to follow his rhymes,\nBut add my own to complete the pair.\n\n**On Lǚ Rùwàng’s Poems to the True One (Continued)**\n\nLater, the phrase *\"举举\"* was written as *\"摔\"* in the text, with *\"举\"* being the ancient form of *\"率\"* (to lead, guide). Master Lǚ passed through the Three Teachings’ precincts and, in passing, inscribed these verses to send to me, also providing the means for daily worship of the True One. The Outer Historian’s verses are clear and unadorned, yet I fear my words may seem crude in comparison.\n\n**Poem One: Welcoming the True One**\nThe clouds drift in uneven, graceful ranks—\nEmerald banners sway, dew-drenched with morning’s glow.\nThe Divine Lord lingers, hesitant, as if yet to arrive,\nHis fair brow deep in thought, like a mountain standing still.\n\nThe Jade Terrace’s script shines through stars and constellations,\nThe crimson gate glows, its light spilling like crimson streams.\nSpring thunder cracks the valleys—none hear its voice,\nYet the lone crane, asleep on pine, wakes first to its call.\n\n**Poem Two: Sending the True One**\nHis radiant face returns, his treasure robes unbound,\nRiding the dragon’s high hump, his spirit soars beyond.\nThe mountain’s elder greets him, year after year,\nWith a single cup of cold spring, poured over jade.\n\nEmerald qi swirls in mist, a forest canopy,\nWith jingling bells held aloft, their light rising and falling.\nThe Imperial Son sings his return, his voice soaring,\nAs white moons welcome clouds and send flying sashes.\n\n---\n\n**A Gift to the Recluse of Huàyáng Cave**\n\nSeated like a corpse, he drinks the morning sun—\nHis double face flushed with wine, his doorstep filled with incense-clouds at dawn.\nMoss and stone sprawl in tangled purple silk,\nAnd the *xūn* flower blooms shallow in green *nícǎo* grass.\n\nThe northern mountain’s apes and cranes seem bound by some pact,\nWhile the southern cliff’s bells and chimes echo as if in reply.\nHe longs to dwell deeper in the abyss,\nBuilding altars by night to worship the Three Teachings’ Lord.\n\n**Two More Poems in the Same Style**\n*Yuè Jí*\n\nA single oar guides my boat into white reeds,\nSeeking the old hermit’s home where the True One resides.\nMy pouch holds the *Zhǒuhòu*’s alchemical secrets,\nAnd when my letter arrives, men will ask of the Dao’s ways.\n\nBefore the white clouds linger to keep me late,\nI know the blue pines send frequent messages.\nThe crane I raised now perches on the pine’s peak,\nSurely he is the recluse of Huàyáng—how many such men remain?\n\nHis hidden life hears the Dao from none too near,\nAs deer and elk come to nest in snow’s deep embrace.\nEach time he reads the clouds, he finds *zhīmù* and wood,\nWhy marvel at the red light piercing the forest’s gloom?\n\nThe Teachings’ Lord rides a tiger down alone,\nWhile the wooded sage may yet compose verses with the dry ape.\nKnow that now he thinks of me most deeply,\nAs my flying spirit crosses a thousand peaks.\n\n**Two Poems in the Same Rhyme**\n*Zhēng Zūyīng*\n\nI dwell in the eastern seas, far from your Jùqū home—\nHow could I know your true news, so distant and true?\nThe immortals possess the art of shrinking earth,\nYet the Master has no mind to gaze upon the common folk.\n\nI am used to wild grasses filling my meal,\nAnd forget the peaches of *Pántáo* bearing fruit so often.\nWho will send a letter with white soil and *dì* trees?\nBest to feign madness, as the recluse-historian does.\n\nIn a flash, we parted—how much dust has flown since then?\nI’ve seen Penglai’s shallows deepen again.\nWhen I recall fishing for the giant tortoise with Rén Gōng’s son,\nWho will release the crane with me, as Zhī Dàolín once did?\n\nThe elixir, once refined, should make one never age,\nAnd poetry, once written, is often wild and lone.\nNext year, I’ll meet you on the *Xiá Jià*’s misty heights,\nAnd send my flying carriage to await you on distant peaks.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Yáng Zǎi*\n\nI envy you, ascending to Huàyáng’s heights,\nWhere ancient caves coil with stone paths lost to time.\nYour banners blot out the sun, their flags fluttering in dawn’s breeze,\nWhile jingling ornaments chime through the night’s empty sky.\n\nYou’ve tested the *fènxīá*’s elixir, mastering the True One’s way,\nAnd worshipped the tortoise to reverse the years of decay.\nThough Tao Yuanming hid himself in seclusion,\nHe still upheld the Dao to aid the Qi and Liang.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Xuē Xuànyì*\n\nReturning to Huàyáng’s ancient cave-heaven,\nYour lofty spirit soars beyond the world’s green.\nYou carve red leaves on cliffs draped in creeping vines,\nAnd loose your hair where purple mists drift beyond the pines.\n\nWhen will the *Chángshǐ*’s script descend in jade?\nThe recluse’s secrets still pass through the ages.\nI’ll tie my boat to the river’s bend to seek you out,\nAnd wander with the wind, questioning the High Mystic.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Zhāng Shū*\n\nIn Xuánzhōu’s secluded hut, you live in splendor’s embrace,\nWith coiled clouds nurturing ten thousand pines in the valley.\nThe Outer Historian’s scrolls hold the golden keys to the *Jīn Kuì*,\nAnd your hidden dwelling bears the imperial seal in jade.\n\nThe elixir pool reveals a dragon without horns,\nAnd the immortal herbs grow fat, their deer bearing antlers.\nI’d borrow one favor to serve as your cave’s official,\nAnd journey with you to the Great Teachings’ peak.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Liú Wèn*\n\nA single day’s letter spreads across the four seas,\nAnd Huàyáng now believes in scholar-immortals.\nDivine friendship blooms like *Hóngjǐng*’s nighttime zither,\nWhile my heart lingers in *Liú Hóu*’s years of fasting.\n\nI pluck spring’s jade-green gourd to hold the moon,\nAnd press yellow paper to split the spring’s flowing well.\nThe mountain’s hues are boundless in their clarity,\nSo I’ll dredge the clouds to reach your cave-heaven.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Zhèng Yuányòu*\n\nSince building your hut in Xuánzhōu with your own hands,\nThe ink-stone’s spring has moistened my own brush.\nI’ve hooked my name on stone records of the worthy,\nAnd carved the mountain’s script as a chronicle’s proof.\n\nThe elixir’s warmth warms the pine’s nodes at dawn,\nAnd tea leaves sprout where the *jū* seedlings grow.\nIf my mortal frame holds even a spark of the True,\nI’d also seek the West, awaiting the jade carriage’s call.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Ní Qiōng*\n\nThe Daoist returns, riding a white crane,\nHis pavilions of gold and jade locking the empty mountain.\nHalfway up the sky, the rainbow’s rain flies with his banners,\nWhile a valley’s pine wind draws his jingling ornaments near.\n\nThe elixir well’s night chill glows with each passing moment,\nAnd the stone altar’s spring stillness is marked by moss.\nI’d drift away to seek such high seclusion,\nAnd share Xuánzhōu’s half with you—just ask.\n\n**Two More Poems in the Same Style**\n*Lǐ Lín*\n\nHeaven’s immortals dwell behind white jade gates,\nAnd who stitches the six-*zhū* robes from spring clouds?\nMen ask for new verses, passed down from the green heights,\nFor a high monk has arrived at *Cùiwēi*’s peak.\n\nFrom Jùróng’s pass, I gaze upon the three peaks,\nWhere lotus-green mists hide the *fúróng*’s deep shade.\nIf only I could ride two deer with you,\nTo listen to the wind among the blue cliffs’ pines.\n\n**A Gift to the Master of Yùzhū**\n*Wáng Lǐ*\n\nIn Jùqū’s mountain, the aged alchemist refines,\nHis pupils like lacquer, his brows like silk.\nHe rides a dark crane to the golden hall,\nAnd kneels to present the elixir script at the jade steps.\n\nHis name is often asked by the enlightened ruler,\nAnd his verses flow from the inner ministers’ pens.\nWhen the wind and rain return him home at night,\nWhite stones and green moss nurture the purple *zhīchí*.\n\n**A Gift to the Master of Jíxū as He Visits the Capital**\nThe Teachings’ Lord of Máo Shān is unknown to men,\nYet for thirty years he’s cultivated *qi* and spirit.\nToday, his two bright eyes gaze upon the forbidden city,\nAnd in spring, a lone crane descends from the distant sky.\n\n**To the Master of Jíxū on His Daoist Lineage**\nIf you meet a recluse wandering beyond the world’s reach,\nAsk him which generation of the Dao he now inherits.\nThe Dragon-Sword’s scrolls and Jade-Casket treasures open the *Bǎolù*’s secrets—\nWhy speak again of earthly immortals?\n\n**On the First Peak**\n*Wáng Fùyuán*\nFive clouds surge with golden robes of the Celestial Official,\nThe eighteenth twist—first peak of all.\nWood and stone shade dark, the wind sighs sharp,\nFrom the square pool, pluck a tiny dragon’s form.\n\n**On the Second Peak**\nThe Jiang-Zhe lands point west, then turn to ask,\nWhere ancient furnaces once held the *bìgū*’s spotted plover.\nI pity my white hair still clinging to mortal bone,\nA thousand *lǐ* brought me to climb this second mountain.\n\n**On the Third Peak**\nOnce, you gave elixir to the *Èr-Mǎo* Lord,\nAnd still, at spring’s end, the clouds burn like fire.\nMen say you rose afterward into the sky,\nWhile the crane’s cry echoes beneath the moon.\n\n**Same Theme**\n*Sàdū Lā*\nThe jade pendants chime as they descend to earth,\nThe wind of heaven rustles the violet *xiá* skirts.\nLiu Lang rides a crane to the Three Isles,\nThe Prince of Wu plays his *shēng* beneath the Five Clouds.\nThe cave’s night-light passes the jade seal,\nOn the stone altar, the moon’s darkness honors the Teachings’ Lord.\nIf you meet the Celestial Master from on high,\nAsk how much cinnabar he’s refined.\n\n---\n\n**Visiting Máo Shān’s Peaks**\n*Kǎilèibáshí*\nThe bamboo carriage climbs into the jade-green haze,\nTo seek the immortal’s white-jade altar.\nFeathered robes often bring the thousand-year crane,\nThe *luán*’s crimson robes once lingered in the Nine Heavens.\nThe cave hides *zhīchí* grass and mountain-jade,\nMen say the *Lín* Palace’s well holds the elixir.\nBeneath the pines, only the recluse’s hall remains—\nAlmost, it was the Emperor Liang’s moment of crisis.\n\n**At the Joyful Guest Spring**\nSpring waters clear, green pools overflow,\nPearls of jade well up in clustered streams.\nThe River Queen loosed her ornaments in chaos,\nThe deep hermit’s tears spill like cascading silk.\nThe Earth-Mother’s bounty has ever been vast,\nYet Feng Yi now displays wonders anew.\nLean on the railing—do not say joy is absent,\nBut play with the cool, damp notes of this poor verse.\n\n**At Yuánfú’s Mountain Retreat**\nSeated before the thousand cliffs’ emerald,\nThe forest’s trees pierce the *qióng* stone.\nThe sword’s sheath holds ancient blades,\nThe alchemical tripod refines the elixir still.\nThe *lěi* flowers press against the mountain-window, damp,\nThe mist opens—cold trees line the ravine.\nSpring birds know my intent,\nChirping as I linger, hesitant.\n\n**At Quánqīng Pavilion**\nStone embraces the secluded pavilion, explored again and again,\nBamboo before the hall plays its clear, fresh tunes.\nHuáyáng’s mountain wine fills the green cups,\nSeated, the spring’s waters drown my drunkenness.\n\n**To the Master of Jíxū**\nThe path into Huáyáng’s stream flows on,\nThe immortal’s jade pendants, his cloud-colored robe.\nPine shadows and stone tortoises warm with elixir smoke,\nThe cave enfolds peach blossoms, the green trees deep.\nAlas, I return from dust to worldly affairs,\nNo heart for wandering beyond to *Yíngzhōu*.\nWhen shall I borrow the Teachings’ Lord’s crane,\nTo journey once more to the Three Mountains’ depths?\n\n**Visiting Máo Shān**\n*Yuè Hùnán*\nThe Great Máo Peak’s summit holds the immortals’ hall,\nThe stone path twists and turns, steep and winding.\nThe old hare’s illusion shows the jade seal,\nThe dragon’s flight depends on the golden elixir.\nTowering pines and white cranes mark the distant Celestial Altar,\nFlowing waters and green peaches chill the immortal’s cave.\nWhere does the *shēng*’s music drift beneath the bright moon?\nThe *shānshān* jade pendants almost summon the *luán*.\n\n**To the Master of Jíxū**\n*Wáng Qiān*\nThe Third Peak is but a step from heaven,\nA dip from the Dragon Pool mixes with mist.\nThe hermit Maò left for the Cloud-River’s hidden depths,\nYet his pure reputation spreads far and wide.\nLong a guest in the capital, now joyfully returned,\nLong days, fine winds brush my travel-worn robes.\nReturning, we face the green mountains together,\nThe pine’s apex glows with elixir light.\nI parted from Huáyáng years ago—\nIn dreams, I still return to Huáyáng.\nHuáyáng’s cave must remain as it was,\nEven now, its incense fills the air.\n\n**Same Theme**\n*Chǔ Néngxíng*\nThe ancestral seal’s transmission is the One True Dao,\nHow could the crane’s journey long be bound to dust?\nThe Pure Reign’s mirror reveals no private favor,\nThe blessed land returns to those of virtue.\nNew rain showers the *ruìzé* groves,\nThe winter altar’s pines and junipers stand firm.\nI offer incense afar, blessing the mountain’s meeting,\nThe pillars of Huáyáng endure five hundred springs.\n\n**On the Golden Key**\n*The Golden Key*\nThe Great Pivot scatters beings in myriad forms—\nWhy do grasses and trees wither in this scorched *mèngxià*?\nThe heavens hold no clouds, the rain does not fall,\nJīnlíng’s four borders see fields grow barren.\nThe Southern Platform’s御史 is a virtuous official,\nHis heart aches for the people, his loyalty unshaken.\nHe urgently petitioned for the drought’s relief,\nAnd sent the swift steed to Máo Peak’s heights.\nThe御史’s horse was as pure as ice in a jade vessel,\nBareheaded, barefoot, he climbed the rugged path.\nHe personally invoked the Teachings’ Lord—\nAnd lo, the response came swift.\nThe True One, Master Róng, stood on the altar,\nDrew water, and sent the spirit-script aloft.\nThe御史’s horse had barely half the journey back,\nWhen clouds gathered, and rain followed the carriage wheels.\nHuáyáng’s *dòngtiān* is the immortals’ domain,\nThe coiling dragon stirs not—who could rouse it?\nUnless sincerity pierces the heavens like an offering,\nHow could such thunderous response be summoned?\nFirst came the lightning, then the rain—all were drenched,\nNo need for the *shènléi*’s crash to shake the Nine Regions.\nThe *Lántái* clerks galloped to report,\nThis virtue’s blessing nourishes the fertile lands.\nYet one candle’s light, one incense’s smoke,\nSummoned the three cranes to gather in reply.\nWas it necessary to dam the West River’s floodwaters,\nTo save the dried fish as in the *zhé*’s time?\nA single drop from the Heavenly Dipper fell like a dragon’s breath,\nThe waves surged three *zhàng* high across the earth.\nThe divine power’s work cannot be measured—\nSilent, motionless, like the Void itself.\n\n*The Records of Máo Shān, Volume Thirty-Two, ends here.*\n\n---\n\n**#3** Jade: *Penjia* reads *\"Stone.\"*\n\n**#4** *Penjia*’s *Joyous Guest Spring* as a *quatrain*:\n*\"Green

halfway to the Hall—\nA rain would follow, as if riding in its wake.\n*Penjia* reads: *\"The clever steed turned back mid-journey,\nSudden divine rain fell, trailing the carriage.\"*\n\n---\n**Volume

Letter to the Recluse**\n\n*\"You have abandoned the dust of the world,\nAscending alone, beyond all.\nArrayed in rainbow clouds, you ride the mist—\nAt dusk, you dine on the stars;\nAt dawn, you feast on the sun.\nYet profound truths remain veiled,\nDim as twilight’s glow.\nThough I long to seek your wisdom,\nI know not the path.*\n\n*But if you linger in seclusion,\nChewing celestial herbs,\nEntering the Pure Capital,\nAmong divine teachers—\nThen the cliffs will guide you home,\nAnd the mind alone suffices.\"*\n\n---\n**Yù Jiānwú’s Letter to the Recluse, Requesting *Mùjiān* (Wood Ash) Decoction**\n\n*\"The emerald leaves sprout from the peak’s side,\nPurple blossoms bloom beneath Zhèngyán’s rock—\nThe mountain spirits read your words,\nThe flower gods record your name.\nWhen wood flourishes, man thanks you—\nYet gathering it is no small feat.\nFrom dawn to dusk, I strain the essence,\nRefining the elixir drop by drop,\nTill the clouds yield their pearls,\nAnd the waters their jade.\nA hundred evils are repelled,\nThe Six Palaces nourished—\nUnless my hands grow weary from grinding,\nOr my limbs ache from climbing peaches,\nHow could I hope to restore youth,\nOr sprout wings at will?\nAt the *Lín Dān* Spring, I would cast aside my cares,\nAt *Lìxiàn*’s Chrysanthemum Well, I’d need no more to draw.\nPerhaps then I might roam the sea’s shores,\nChasing the dust of *Qiānzǐ*,\nOr gallop through *Huòshān*,\nLeading the *Chén Wáng* in song.\nYet worldly affairs press on—\nDaily, the debt grows harder to repay.\nYour boundless grace transcends this world—\nHow

received an imperial decree to visit the reclusive Daoist of Maoshan,\nSeeking to learn the Master’s humble and restrained Way,\nAnd to embody the beauty of practicality over ostentation.\nIs there

CE),\nLi Deyu, the Circuit Commissioner of Huainan,\nActing Censor of the Department of Household Affairs,\nAnd concurrently the Prefect of Yangzhou,\nSent envoys to the Dragon Simplicity

born,\nHe shall be the fourth emperor of Song.\"*\n\nThe envoy asked: *\"Which True Person of the Wang lineage?\"*\nThe reply came: *\"The Master of Sparking Fire.\"*\nEmpress Zhang’s dream of a thousand robes of feathered attire\nFollowed by a Daoist official descending from the void.\nWhen Emperor Renzong was born, flames in the palace reached the heavens.\nAt five or six years of age, he would often hold a peachwood branch,\nPiercing it with sinew and saying: *\"I am testing the sparking of fire.\"*\nEmperor Zhangsheng said: *\"The so-called Sparking Fire indeed is not false!\"*\n\nThe twenty-seventh generation’s Master of Nurturing Purity spoke:\n*\"During the Xuannu era, when asked by the Emperor,\nDongbin and Lü Gong often accompanied me,\nAnd once instructed me: ‘Those who cultivate the nature must first subdue the heart,\nThose who cultivate the vital essence must first clarify the spirit.\nWhen the spirit is clear and the heart is upright, evil cannot intrude.\nIf the heart cannot be subdued, inner malice kindles like fire—\nJust as cinnabar dust, though inert, flares when exposed to flame.’\"*\n\n---\n**Imperial Decrees:**\nThe *Xuánzōng* (Ming

*cāngyún*.\nLead ascends to the crown, mercury dissolves to dust.*\n\nDuring the *Jiāyòu* era, Chen Qian served as magistrate of Jùróng County and revised the *Jùqū Shān* records. In recent years, scholars have repeatedly annotated them.\n\nAt the entrance to Yùchén Guān stand two altars: the left is the *Chángshǐ* Altar, where *Zhēnbái* Master is enshrined; the right is the *Yǐnyú Bàimíng* Altar of seclusion.\n\nBehind the *Sānqīng* Hall stands an ancient statue of the Celestial Master, his hair and beard unkempt.\n\nThe *Zhōu Zhēnrén* Pool—Master Daoist Wang Yíyán, styled *Zǐyì*, surnamed *Wang Zìzài*, aged seventy, a native of Kaifeng—was repeatedly bestowed Daoist ranks by Emperor Huizong but declined office.\n\nThe *Dānshā* Spring emerges from the bamboo grove, where a dragon coils beneath the pine roots, its branches sheltering like a roof. Once, a Daoist hermit dwelled beneath it.\n\nThe *Xǐkè* Spring—six verses from the *Jiāyòu* era appear in *Zhōu Yìgōng’s* collection.\n\nIn the *Qián’dào* third year, upon visiting the mountain, I recorded the lakeside retreat of Master Su Gāng, with this inscription:\n*'Lotus pearls of eloquence, calligraphy bright as scripture.'*\n\nThe *Yúnmái* Three Halls stand empty—\nTheir occupants have vanished far.\nAs the age decays and the Dao fades,\nFew remain unbroken in integrity.\"*\n\nAt the moment of his passing, he lamented in the *Shìhé* Stele. The Emperor’s decree arrived, granting the **Daoist Master of the Three Teachings** (三茅山掌教真人) a **jade seal and sword** to be returned to the mountain for ancestral rites.\n\nThe imperial edict read:\n\n*\"The Jiang-Zhe and other regions' Central Secretariat, in accordance with the *Zhōngshū* petitions presented to the *Jiéxián Yuàn*, on the twenty-sixth day of the twelfth month of the *Yányòu* era—also the third day of the *Yìxiān Tièmù’ěr* (怯薛) military rotation—at the *Jiāxī* Hall (嘉禧殿) during the midday watch, the *Bǎo’ér Chìjùn* (保儿赤峻) Southern Prefect and the *Nándàqīng* (南大卿) *Zhúchì Sīlǐ* (烛赤刺禾里仄) Military Governor, along with other officials of this institution, received a memorial from the *Qūmù* Grand Protector (曲木太保) *Shūgù* (叔固), Grand Academician (大学士), alongside *Chén* Grand Academician (陈大学士) and *Cáo* Grand Academician (曹大学士).\n\nIt was stated that in the time of the departed Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, a **jade seal** was bestowed upon the mountain’s **Master of the Ancestral Hall** (元符宫宗师), inscribed with the **seal script** (篆文) of the **Nine Elders of the Immortal Metropolis** (九老仙都君), along with a **jade hilted ritual sword** (玉靶法剑), identical in function to the **seal and sword** passed down by the **Dragon-Tiger Mountain Zhang Celestial Master** (龙虎山张天师) for ancestral rites and transmission of the Dao.\n\nDuring the *Yìzhuān* era’s twelfth year (至元十二年), when the military horses crossed the Yangtze, **Master Zhái** (翟宗师) concealed the **jade seal** and **jade hilted sword**. Their whereabouts remained unknown thereafter.\n\nIn the *Yìzhuān* era’s sixteenth year (至元十六年), **Master Xǔ** (许宗师) recovered the **jade hilted sword**.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the seventh month of the *Yányòu* era (延佑四年七月十八日), during the midday watch, a white-faced hare or rat was seen entering the **law hall’s** (法堂) brick cavity behind the altar. Though the creature vanished, a **seal** was found. After cleaning it, it was identified as the ancestral **jade seal**.\n\nThus, it was submitted above, along with this institution’s documents, to the **Superior Secretariat** (都省) of the **Jiankang Road** (建康路), and the **seal and sword** were dispatched to the **Central Secretariat**.\n\nNow, as the officials arrive here, the **seal and sword**—items of ancestral transmission for their rites—remain.\n\nHow can this be pitied?\n\nLet the **seal and sword** be returned to their mountain’s **Celestial Master**, to be kept and used as before in ancestral rites.\n\nHow shall this be memorialized?\n\nIn accordance with the imperial decree.\n\nYesterday, the officials of the Secretariat also spoke thus: the **seal and sword** will be delivered here for safekeeping, and these are the **Celestial Master’s** (先生) ritual implements. They were to be entrusted to **Zhang Shangqing** (张上卿). Since it has been stated as such, now summon **Zhang Shangqing** here, entrust them to him, and instruct him to deliver them to the **Master of the Three Teachings at Dragon-Tiger Mountain** (三茅山宗师) for safekeeping, so that they may continue to be passed down for ancestral rites as before. This is to be reported to the Secretariat’s officials, ensuring they are aware.\n\nThus is the imperial decree.\n\nBy imperial command, all submissions shall be reviewed and forwarded to the Secretariat as requested, and this shall be carried out accordingly.\n\nThe Secretariat, having already dispatched the decree to the Jiankang Circuit for implementation, now commands all subordinates to verify and comply accordingly.\n\n**Matters requiring deliberation and execution:**\n\nIn ancient times, the transmission of Dao was entrusted to the **True Person (真人) of Three Teachings at Dragon-Tiger Mountain**, as decreed.\n\n**Preface to the *True Transmission Diagram of Shangqing***\n\nHe who dwells in lofty forests and peaks must first harbor the resolve to ascend the azure clouds; he who imbibes the profound essence must seek the source of the elixir’s waters.\n\nOf all teachings, none surpasses the **Dao** in its transmission. Thus, those ancient who sought the **Dao** regarded finding a master as their utmost priority, while masters themselves found securing worthy disciples their greatest challenge. Yet the **Immortal** seeks nothing from others, and the **Dao** requires no external aid. One must only cultivate purity and stillness, align heart and sincerity, and await the response of the **True Spirit (真灵)**.\n\nFaith is the mother of merit; doubt, the destroyer of progress. How can one be too cautious?\n\n**Huayang Cave Heaven**, since the **Three Teac Masters of Han** ascended here, has been the domain of **Divine Lords and Immortals** through the Wei and Jin dynasties onward. It is where **cloud-dwelling and mist-garbed sages** gather—truly a **Celestial Palace upon Earth**, a **Paradise of the Dao**. Hence, the ancients likened the **Dao’s Huayang** to the **Confucian Ru’s Shimen**, though such comparisons fall short in their inadequacy.\n\nThe **True Person of Shangqing, Master Liu** (刘君大彬), commissioned artisans to copy the **Ancestral True Images**, spanning from **Zhongxu Yuanjun** (紫虚元君) through forty-five generations. **Master Meng** (孟俯) then composed a brief transmission record, appending it to the scroll, and hid it within the mountain. Thus, future generations might preserve the lineage, keeping the **Dao’s essence** alive through reverence and study.\n\nI humbly reflect: the mountain’s marvels and the **Dao’s radiance** owe much to **Zhenbai True Person Tao** (陶君), who recorded and compiled with unwavering dedication. Thus, even the distant **Mao-Wei** and **Xiazu** regions retain echoes of its teachings, while the **Yangxu old borders** still bear traces of its legacy. The spirit soars beyond mortal reach.\n\nAlas! How I wish to follow **True Person Tao** in his inquiries at **Leiping Liufen**, kneeling as his disciple, and offering my pen in service! Then might I examine the **Panboluo** mirror, contemplate the **Xinghong Pool**, and spend my remaining years in **grass-clothing and wooden bowls**, fulfilling my aspirations.\n\nHow dare I covet the frivolous pursuit of **Immortal longevity**?\n\nWritten on the **seventh year of the Yanyou era (延佑七年, 1320)**, the **gengshen day (庚申)**, the ninth day of the month, by **Zhao Mengfu** (赵孟俯), former **Hanlin Academician**, **Chancellor of Imperial Edicts**, and **Compiler of National Histories**.\n\n**End of Volume Thirty-Three of *Maoshan Records* (茅山志)**.\n\n---\n**Annotations in Original Text:**\n1. 永: *Dubious reading; original text has \"久\" (long).*\n2. 吁: *Dubious reading; original text has \"呵\" (exclamation).*\n3. 窃: *Original text has \"切\" (earnestly); corrected per *Dianben* (笪本).*\n4. 失: *Original text has \"夫\" (this); corrected per *Dianben*.*\n5. 冰: *Original text has \"水\" (water); corrected per *Dianben*.*",

The accumulation of his merits has moved the Grand Tenuity; heaven and humanity, without prior accord, have converged in harmony.\nNow We recompense these nine deeds to requite his past devotion.\n\nHis heart and spirit are bright and upright, the abode of the Four Numinous Beasts.\nHis cinnabar truth shines forth; his integrity is unwavering.\nHis charge is whole and steadfast; his mirror reflects even the subtlest things.\nNow We appoint him Supreme Minister, to govern the Eastern Marchmount.\nWe further entrust him with the Directorship of Destinies, to oversee the celestial registers.\nWe assign him forty Jade Boys and forty Jade Maidens, to attend him in the Grand Tenuity and serve in the Great Ultimate.\n\nHis administrative palace is the Red City, the Jade Cavern Repository.\nLet him govern it with diligence, reporting all activities without fail.\n\nThe Supreme Thearch dispatches this decree, written in purple and white script, to the Central Lord.\n*In the third year of Yongshi, the year Dingwei, the Supreme Thearch issued this command, as recorded by the Celestial Perfected.*",

      "translated_text": "Maogu of Xianyang, whose family resided at the Southern Pass, styled Jivei, was destined for transcendence from birth. His rank was that of Registrar of Destinies, and he concurrently oversaw the terrestrial perfected. He was charged with recommending those of the Dao, whose lifespans were intertwined with their virtue. Wherever his diligence and reverence took root, the laws of the Four Poles were fully realized. His administrative palace was the Terrace of Winding Clouds, and his domain the Juqu Mountains of Danyang. Let him govern it with vigilance, reporting all activities without fail.\n\nThe decree in purple and white script to Junior Lord states:\nMaogu’s younger brother, Zhong, embodies purity and clarity from birth. Though his return to rectitude came late, his thoughts were subtle and his sincerity profound. He severed ties with the Six Heavens of Delusion, his talent and intelligence shining brightly. Now We appoint him Director of the Three Offices, to safeguard life and establish names. He shall oversee Mount Tai, presiding over the records of death and birth. His rank is that of Earthbound Transcendent, the finest among the Nine Palaces. He shall instruct the young and uninitiated, guiding them to completion. He shall educate the female officials, imparting the wondrous arts of the numinous. He shall govern the hundred spirits, overseeing the exorcism of malevolent forces. He shall inspect the sources of rivers, ensuring the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow River. He shall seal and guard the Golden Valley, storing the jade elixir within. He shall supervise the cultivation of dragon mushrooms and luminous herbs that glow at night.

Let him strive with diligence, reporting all activities without fail.\n\nThis inscription was carved in stone in the third year of Putong under the Liang dynasty.

In tranquility, you find your nature, and your joy is well-placed—We commend your resolve. Should you require anything, you need only report it. We hereby grant you ten bolts of silk and twenty torches. Additionally, We decree a monthly provision of five *jin* of superior *fuling* and two *dou* of white honey for your alchemical practices.\n\n**Memorial of Yinju Requesting Resignation from Office**\nYour servant has heard that the wind of Yao soared to the heavens, and the discourse of Yingyang stirred the Yellow River. The virtue of Han encompassed the earth, and the aura of Shangyin nurtured the mushrooms of immortality. Your servant has lingered in the world for many years, bound by cap and sash. Service was never for glory, nor study for salary. I have long yearned to cast off my official cords and plow the fields alone, to dwell in the moonlit ravines and play the zither amidst the clouds. By the grace of Your Majesty’s favor, I have been permitted to retire to the hills and vales. Now, I shall vanish like a shadow in the cassia courtyard, my spirit communing with the pines. Once I pass through the Eastern Pass, my homeland will be in sight. The mere thought stirs my heart, and I weep by the waterside. My boat is already lost to the currents, and I cannot present myself in person. Unable to bear the weight of my longing, I humbly submit this memorial.\n\n**Emperor Wu of Liang’s Response to Yinju’s Treatise on Calligraphy**\nThe two scrolls you wished to retain briefly are not unusual in their paper. Since they are part of your traveling library, I had them sent to you earlier. There is nothing particularly noteworthy here, but if you require more finely written texts, I shall provide them. For instance, in the style of *lun* and *zhen*, Wang Xizhi’s calligraphy is not excessively fine. His *Yue Yi Lun* is somewhat robust, but I suspect it is not an authentic work. The *Tai Shi Zhen* is slightly more refined and charming, yet the brushwork is too delicate, and the style deviates—both have already been examined by the keenest eyes. Beyond these, there is nothing else to send.\n\n**Memorial of Yinju to Emperor Wu on Calligraphy**",

      "translated_text": "**Memorial of Yinju to Emperor Wu on Calligraphy (Continued)**\n\nBy Your Majesty’s decree, I have reviewed the works held by the Central Secretariat, and among those with some ability, only Zhou Xizan stands out. For the yellow of the heart’s core truly awaits the exhalation of *jiazhong*’s qi. Now that Your Majesty’s own calligraphy embodies the sublime, it perfects both principle and application below. Whenever I reflect on Your Majesty’s discussions of Zhong [You] and Wang [Xizhi] as models for the realm, the advancement of this art is only just beginning. What grieves me is my own dullness—I cannot fathom such heights, and my admiration verges on self-deception.\n\nPreviously, I received three sheets of Your Majesty’s divine brushwork, and with these, the total now reaches five. Not only does each character command my gaze, but every stroke pierces my heart. Day by day, their vigor and charm grow beyond description. Compared to those of past years, they are no longer of the same order. If these alone serve as models, why seek further among Zhong and Wang?\n\nMy reverence has always been profound, but now my admiration deepens still. Joy and delight fill me, and I cannot but report this. I prostrate myself in gratitude for the two scrolls, having examined their inscribed slips. All accords with Your Majesty’s decree. Though I dared not presume to retain them long, I could not bear to part with them at once. The tracing I had begun remains unfinished. Since the courier must depart now, and the paper lanes are already prepared, and as there are many other miscellaneous texts without further use, I shall await their completion and return them all together.\n\nThese writings are of the *pianzhang* style. Though I have not yet distinguished their forms, I may yet study and practice them. I only wish for finely written texts, such as the *Yue Yi Lun* or *Tai Shi Zhen*, to copy and preserve for posterity—recording only their essentials.\n\n**Further Response to Your Majesty’s Edict**\nI have also reviewed Your Majesty’s separate note, which states that such matters should be subtly recorded, for this appreciation is a noble pursuit, and oral instruction is not to be dismissed. Though this is not my usual practice, I venture a brief attempt.\n\nWhen the brush is held askew, the strokes lack sharpness. When the grip is too loose, the writing becomes weak. Short dots and strokes produce a bloated form; long ones, a torn and scattered effect. If horizontal strokes are too compressed, the character tilts; if too sparse, the shape slackens. Constraint yields stiffness, while excess freedom lacks structure—pure bone without charm, pure flesh without strength. Too little ink makes the brush float and hesitate; too much, the strokes grow dull and sluggish. All these arise naturally from the hand’s movement.\n\nYet when modulation is apt and intent unerring, when the brush connects and severs with purpose, when it surges like waves and bends like joints, conforming to compass and square—when strokes descend in measured weight, their thickness and thinness balanced, their plumpness and leanness harmonized, their strength proportioned—then the writing appears gentle yet radiant, endlessly pleasing to the eye. Its edges sharp and its presence imposing, it seems alive. When it delights both eye and heart, it ranks among the finest. Even if one recognizes the styles of many masters, one must still grasp their underlying principles.\n\nThe Six Scripts may be mastered, but this too comes only through practice. Some can retain what they hear once; others, what they see once. Such people exist in every age. In the end, all discussion returns to practice. Cheng Miao reformed the script through long use; Zhang Zhi perfected his calligraphy through accumulated study. Only after long use and deep study can one discourse freely.\n\nIn my youth, I never even traced the *tian gan di zhi* on my palm, let alone on paper. To speak of it now is meaningless—it only invites ridicule from my contemporaries and mockery from future generations. Yet I have made bold claims, and reading them now makes my back burn with shame. In this, I have truly piled falsehood upon falsehood. This is but mastery of a single art, not what I would call a noble pursuit. It is but dust upon the heart’s Dao, not what I would call desirelessness.\n\nRegarding the *Yue Yi Lun*, I have long suspected it to be a copy, though I dared not speak lightly. Now that Your Majesty deems it inauthentic, I trust my own judgment has gained some insight. The *Zhen Zan* is overly delicate and weak. That Xu Jingsu’s works were granted permanent provision fills me with awe at Your Majesty’s gracious praise, beyond words.\n\nThough these writings do not follow standard models, their practical application and principle are sound. The fine regular script on the reverse invites repeated admiration. Earlier, in the capital, I obtained a scroll of *feibai* calligraphy, said to be Wang Xizhi’s prized work. Having never seen other examples, I could not verify it, but its power and force struck me as extraordinary. I humbly present it to Your Majesty. Though it serves no use to me, if it might grace Your Majesty’s collection, I would gladly offer it.\n\nOnce, at Ma Cheng’s residence, I saw a volume of Wang Xizhi’s *Zhengshu Catalogue*. Ma said that Wang had transcribed over ten works, including the *Luoshen Fu*, all in the modern style, except for two *Jijiu Zhang* pieces, which retained the tight, fine, and nearly archaic ancient method. Recalling this, I fear they have long since scattered and no longer survive. Ma also said that the inscribed slips from his traveling library were all imitations for the imperial princes and court officials. Recently, I saw three volumes. The first slip was said to be quite old, but I dared not presume to identify it. Such rarities are scarce. If even one or two slips from these three volumes could be included among the traveling library’s examples, it would be most fortunate.\n\nYour Majesty’s decree has now granted the earlier volumes, filling me with awe and trepidation. When I first saw the volumes, they were numbered twenty-three or twenty-four. Delighted by their abundance, I now find the gifted texts have reached two hundred seventy. My astonishment knows no end. The imperial treasury is vast as the sea, not to be drawn by a single ladle. I can only still my heart in gratitude. Altogether, I have now received five volumes, large and small, far beyond what my crude talents deserve. Without Your Majesty’s extraordinary favor, how could I dare hope for such bounty?\n\nBy nature, I am broadly learned but lack precision. Once, I found my own calligraphy unworthy of viewing and aspired to become a scribe or historian. Later, I grew fond of clerical script and envied those who held official posts. I have often said that in the span of a human life, one’s understanding cannot encompass all things. The world is vast, yet we indulge only the five desires—this is truly shameful. I would rather become a talented ghost than a dull immortal, and this remains my conviction.\n\nAt first, I wished to abandon such pursuits, but since the *wuyi* year, state affairs have pressed heavily. My mountain heart grows weary and silent, and I dare not trouble Your Majesty with idle matters. Yet this topic has led me to importune Your Majesty excessively. I prostrate myself, praying that Your Majesty’s sagely compassion will forgive my presumption.",

      "translated_text": "Having reviewed and distinguished the various manuscripts, I find your discernment truly refined. Whether they differ or align remains uncertain—all hinges on their merits. Two sheets are to be given to the *jishizhong* and *huangmen*: one for Ren Jing’s calligraphy.\n\nExamining the characters sent under Jing’s name, they closely resemble the two sheets in question, yet Jing’s style is eclectic and fluid—this cannot be his work. One must further assess the nuances of brushstrokes, waves, and flourishes to grasp the essence of each master’s art. Such judgment cannot be rushed in the handling of brush and paper; for now, I shall guard my clumsiness and adhere to moderation. Both the copies of Xu Ren’s and Ren Jing’s works, along with the traced versions, are hereby returned. The first scroll (#7) contains miscellaneous pieces, which I have meticulously annotated in a separate note (#8). Fearing my assessment may not be just, I also submit the copies I privately made for Your Majesty’s review.\n\nFor over ten days, my thoughts have been fraught with anxiety, leaving no peace for other matters. Thus, this delay is unseemly, and I await the completion of the remaining tasks. The other entries are of no use, save for the two pieces, *Shuye* and *Weibi*, which adhere to the standard script style. I regret that they are presented as single volumes. Upon examining the scroll numbers, I find them far from few. Your earlier decree mentioned only four volumes, yet this collection appears to have been compiled during the *Yuanjia* era of the Liu-Song. Likely, many were later gathered and lost. Of Wang Xizhi’s renowned works, scarcely a handful survive—*Huangting*, *Exhortation to Advance*, *Portrait Eulogies*, and *The Goddess of the Luo River*—I cannot confirm whether these remain extant.\n\nThe twenty-third fascicle now contains twelve entries on a separate sheet. Of these, only eight are attributed to Wang Xizhi’s hand. The first, *Yue Yi Lun*, is executed with exceptional vigor yet lacks deliberate intent, resulting in several flawed characters. *The Grand Preceptor’s Admonition* and *The Great Odes* are painstakingly rendered but overly constrained, making them suitable only for fans or screens. The remaining five pieces offer little of note.\n\nOne sheet bears Minister Tao’s inscription, but this work is neither graceful nor by Wang Xizhi’s hand. Its provenance is unknown, and it appears to be a tracing. The two sheets for the *jishizhong* and *huangmen*, along with one sheet of *Zhikang Li*, are in Wang Xianzhi’s hand, though they too seem traced. Another sheet, *Ligu Fang*, is also by Wang Xianzhi and likewise a tracing. These four entries are not by Wang Xizhi.\n\nThe twenty-fourth fascicle now contains twenty-one entries, of which only eleven are attributed to Wang Xizhi. None are particularly fitting: many are careless, their strokes lacking refinement, and their elegance diminished, making detailed critique difficult. The first, from the second year of *Huangchu*, is a later imitation of Wang Xizhi’s style. One sheet, *Epitaph for a Tomb*, is by Master Xu; another, *Embracing Hidden Sorrow*, by Zhang Cheng; one dated the eleventh of the fifth month by a traced copy of Wang Min’s work; another, *Still Yearning for the Yellow and Qi*, also traced; one sheet of *Stagnation*; and a full piece, all imitations by others, clumsily executed. One sheet, undated, is by Wang Xianzhi but with altered months; another, dated the fifteenth of the fifth month, by Sun Bai; one sheet of *Zhiqin Fang* by Wang Min; and one by Xie An. These ten entries are not by Wang Xizhi.\n\nFearing Your Majesty may not yet deign to distinguish them, I now submit the calligraphy of Master Xu and Ren Jing for comparison, as outlined separately. From this, one may discern the hands of Wang Min, Zhang Cheng, Zhang Yi, and Xie An—works Your Majesty’s court should possess. Of the Zhong [Yao] and Wang [Xizhi] scrolls, one volume is traditionally deemed authentic, but I suspect all are traced copies, most unworthy of discussion. Only two or three lines faintly capture Zhong’s style. Wang Xizhi’s study of Zhong is evident in nearly twenty pieces. The rest, with their fine strokes and short lines, largely follow Zhong’s method.\n\nI wish to have them mounted, but it is not yet convenient to deliver them. By next month, when the task is complete, I shall send them. Upon reviewing Your Majesty’s instructions, though the initial intent was limited to twelve pieces, the standards and judgments are comprehensive. Even if later works do not exceed two hundred, their praise and censure are fully encompassed—a single word suffices to capture the essence of calligraphy. This would instantly bestow new honor upon the aged bones of Zhong [Yao], while Wang Xianzhi’s delicate flesh would pale beside the night’s darkness. Only Wang Xizhi’s work allows for measured critique, revealing the jade-like purity of his art. Without Your Majesty’s sagely discernment in appraisal, the trend of favoring recent imitations may lead to eternal confusion.\n\nZhang Zhi is hailed as the sage of cursive script, and Zhong [Yao] himself is unmatched in clerical script. As the saying goes, their art shares a single mechanism—a divine treasure unmatched across ages. With this principle clarified, those who merely mimic the tiger should lay down their brushes at once. Returning to antiquity and restoring authenticity will truly herald a flourishing era.\n\nMy humble insights, though presumptuous, have been shared with joy and admiration beyond measure. The world now esteems Wang Xianzhi, while Zhong [Yao]’s legacy, though equal in the Qi and Liang dynasties, has faded in reputation. Not only is Zhong no longer recognized, but Wang Xizhi’s standing has also suffered. This is not a matter of rejection or dismissal but of being stained without purification—scarcely a few lineages remain. Now, upon receiving this discourse, I leap and dance with excitement, though it scarcely vents my fervor. I wish to privately show the traced copies to Hong Yuan and Si Kuang. These two are men of balanced judgment; they would surely leap with admiration, gaining more than half the benefit.\n\nThough I do not know Hong Yuan personally, through my nephew Xu, we have corresponded and met. However, as he serves in the palace, he may have already heard of this. The size of the characters in the traced copies is unsuitable, but if Guo Jun were to adjust them, they might still suffice—though the brushwork’s intent may differ greatly.

      "translated_text": "Admiration for the treasured gifts grows ever deeper. As the world universally declares, the traces of Zhong [You] no longer exist in Jiangdong. I have long regretted this, cherishing only the distant hope that when the Central Plains are pacified, the stele of Taiqiu might be traced and studied. Now, however, the imperial decree states that though authentic traces are few, they may yet be inferred. This suggests some still remain—though I know not how many characters survive. Since I cannot view them in person, I dare presume to request that skilled artisans trace and fill several lines. Should I be so fortunate as to receive them, it would be an undeserved blessing.\n\nMoreover, when [Wang] Yishao studied under Zhong [You], his technique—subtle in movement, dense in form—surpassed his own spontaneous brushwork. I wonder how many sheets of such examples remain. The decree further mentions that works like the *Huangting Xiang Zan* may yet be provided. As for his spontaneous brushwork, I no longer dare hope. I only beg to study Zhong’s marvels, humbly awaiting this singular grace.\n\nAdditionally, before Yishao assumed office in Wuxing, his calligraphy had yet to earn acclaim. All his finest works—those he cherished and advanced—date to his time in Kuaiji, roughly the decade of Yonghe. After resigning his post and withdrawing from service upon the death of his elder, he scarcely wrote again himself, entrusting all to a single scribe. Yet the world could not distinguish their hands—how strange! In his later years, after Yishao’s death, his son Zijing, then seventeen or eighteen, imitated this scribe’s style so perfectly that their scripts became indistinguishable. Now, by the imperial decree’s illumination, all may suddenly recognize Yishao’s late work.\n\nAs for the criticism of Ruan Yan’s calligraphy in his later years, I recently heard of someone who studied Yan’s script so closely that their hands could no longer be told apart. Among the works I obtained through Guo’s tracing, though the character forms are roughly rendered, the brushwork’s intent and momentum are lost. I wonder if among the previous scrolls, one or two meticulously executed examples might be included in the set to be mounted.\n\nAgain, I am deeply moved by the imperial grace extended to the end of the year. This favor descends from heaven; I merely report what I have ascertained, without presumption or desire. *Emperor Wu’s Rescript in Reply to the Presentation of the* Xuantong Ji:\n\nHaving reviewed the memorial and examined the authentic words of Zhou’s relics, their evident verification of earlier prophecies is all the more wondrous. The four scrolls are now retained. The profound texts are fully recorded in part, with only added praise and admiration. Twentieth day of the twelfth month.\n\n*Memorial Presenting Zhou’s* Xuantong Ji *by the Recluse:*\n\nYour servant respectfully reports: In the final days of the tenth month, Zhou’s affair suddenly arose. As I was then observing purification rites, I could not immediately memorialize it. Now, I have meticulously compiled the events into four scrolls, which I present separately. Yet I, having lingered in doubt like a fish in a net, failed to believe and awaken sooner. In remorse and sorrow, I deserve severe censure. The profound texts are orally recounted in full. I humbly pray for leniency toward my negligence. I prostrate myself in submission.\n\n*End of the First Scroll of the* Maoshan Annals.\n\n---\n\n*Preface to the* Maoshan Annals:\n\nIn the first year of Huangqing, an imperial edict bestowed upon Liu Dabin, the forty-fifth patriarch of Maoshan, the title *True Man of Subtle and Mysterious Responses in the Grotto’s Observation*. Five years later, the Three Mao Lords were honored with additional two-character epithets: *True Response*, *Marvelous Response*, and *Divine Response*. The three peaks were consecrated as abbeys: *Sacred Protection*, *Virtue’s Protection*, and *Benevolent Protection*. The following year, the jade seal of the altar, long lost, resurfaced. The authorities reported the matter, and an imperial decree elevated the mountain’s status.\n\nThereupon, imperial favor deepened, auspicious omens flourished, and harmony prevailed between gods and men. All recorded structures—every dilapidated hall or pavilion in need of repair—were entrusted to the patriarch’s care. Yet I lamented that the mountain’s annals, though begun, remained unfinished. Thus, I charged my disciples to gather materials and compile a complete record, later inviting me to compose a preface. Reviewing its contents, I find the imperial decrees’ grandeur, the immortals’ marvels, the grottoes’ profundity, the altar records’ transmission, the figures’ greatness, the towers’ splendor, the mountains and waters’ purity, the flora’s elegance, the steles’ inscriptions, and the verses’ artistry—all meticulously categorized and fully presented.\n\nMaoshan, originally called Juqu Mountain, is the eighth of the *Cave Heavens of Huayang* and the foremost of the *Earthly Blessings’ Lungs*. The Mao brothers of Han retired here to cultivate the Dao, and the mountain took their name. By the Jin and Wei dynasties, the Yuan Lady greatly expanded its legacy. The immortal winds and numinous traces flowed unbroken, making it a renowned mountain and sacred realm under heaven.\n\nThe imperial Yuan dynasty esteems clarity and stillness. Since the land was submitted to the Bureau of Geography, the masters of its altars have been summoned to court, honored with imperial rescripts and golden charters. The teachings flourished under the patriarch, who received grace surpassing all predecessors. Ah, how splendid! For the mountain’s *qi* unfolds in times of peace, and after long ages, the patriarch’s Dao likewise ascends to imperial notice. Herein lies the marvel of silent communion.\n\nThus, the mountain’s annals must be compiled, and this work cannot lack a preface. Formerly, Emperor Xuanzong of Tang inquired of Li Xuanjing about governance and transformation. Xuanjing replied: *The* Daodejing *is the sovereign’s teacher.* Emperor Wen of Han practiced its teachings, bringing benevolence and longevity to the realm. He later consulted on the golden tripod, saying: *The* Daode *is public; light ascension is private.* May later generations embody Xuanjing’s noble words and follow the patriarch’s sincere devotion.",

Thus, those beyond the world—court servants of the sacred altars—were specially favored with imperial appointment, their grace and radiance illuminating the mountains and forests.

Reflecting on my own words, I realize this famous mountain truly deserves to be heard.\n\nIn the *gengxu* year of the Zhida era, I came to Mount Mao for sacrificial rites. There, I perused the mountain’s old annals and found many omissions and gaps. I once mentioned this to the forty-fourth-generation patriarch, Master Wang of Muchen, but before long, the master transmitted his truth, and the mountain’s annals remained unheard. Five years later, I returned to the mountain for rites and again spoke of this to the succeeding patriarch, Master Liu. Thirteen years passed, and in the *bingyin* year of the Taiding era, the Son of Heaven, following ancient precedent, performed a jiao ritual for the mountain.

      "translated_text": "In the twentieth year of the Shaoxing era of the Song, Zeng Xun of Nanfeng, styled Zhongzhao, and the Daoist Fu Xiaozian of Taidao Abbey compiled a four-fascicle *Record of Mount Mao*. Their work merely listed the names of mountains, waters, temples, and shrines, with scant attention to historical inquiry or narrative. Only after a full twelve-year cycle since Dabin’s ascent to the altar did he finally complete the compilation and verification of the lineage’s scriptures and records, taking another five years to bring the work to fruition.\n\nThis book, titled *Annals of Mount Mao*, comprises twelve sections in fifteen fascicles. It chronicles the numinous efficacy of this mountain, which from the dawn of creation has stood apart, responding to emperors from beyond the void. Yu the Great of Xia once visited; the First Emperor of Qin ascended its heights. In the second year of Yuanshou of the Han, the Supreme Thearch bestowed the Nine Gifts upon Lord Mao, who ascended as an immortal in broad daylight—his name thus resounded throughout the realm. By the Jin and Song dynasties, the flourishing of the Dao saw the Liang and Tang courts hold it in profound reverence. Perfected Ones and Daoists generation after generation served as teachers to emperors, their dragon-script and phoenix-characters accumulating like clouds and mist. Yet alas, the ages have grown distant, and imperial seals are rarely preserved. What remains is but a fraction of what was once seen and heard.\n\nUnder our August Yuan, the realm was unified. Through the sagely virtue and divine merit of Emperor Shizu, the Martial Emperor first issued the *Mingzhao* edict. He summoned the lineage’s successor, Master Jiang Zongying, to the court. Thus, successive dynasties have greatly protected this teaching. In the third year of the Yanyou era, the Three Lords were granted honorific titles, and the Three Peaks were renamed, their glory outshining all antiquity. That the sage employs the divine Dao to establish teaching has ever been thus.\n\nThe first section, *Decrees and Inscriptions*, records the imperial edicts of investiture, which proclaim: “The numen of this mountain takes its name from its surname. The true heirs of the Mao Lords—let their transmission be recorded first.” Following the example of *The Hidden Instructions on Ascending to Perfection and the True Transmission*, the sagely Dao Lords are titled “Records,” while other Perfected Ones are titled “Transmissions.” How could the Three Mao Lords of Qin and Han, whose sagely traces are revered by scholars today, be merely called “Transmissions”? Thus, the second section is titled *Records of the Three Divinities*.\n\nJintan’s Huayang Grotto-Heaven, the Earthly Lung of Jinling, and the Blessed Land of Tongxiang—these are the “blessed realms for nurturing perfection” and “numinous ruins for attaining divinity” spoken of by the Perfected One of Tongxiang. Their legacy endures for a hundred generations. Collecting the mountains, waters, and grottoes, the third section is titled *Compendium of the Numinous Realm*.\n\nFrom Lord Wang’s admonition about “dust rising from the sea” to Lord Hua’s words on “the marker post leaving home,” we know that immortals and sages traversing the mortal world have often marveled at the changes between ancient and modern. Yet the traces of the mysterious Dao, unlike the shifting hills and valleys, are few indeed. Thus, the fourth section is titled *Traces of Antiquity Verified*.\n\nThe teachings of the Shangqing scriptures were first transmitted to the world in the second year of Xingning of the Jin, when the Purple Void’s Lady Wei descended to the residence of Yang Jun, a clerk in the household of Wang Fangzhi of Langye. She transcribed them in clerical script and passed them to Xu Jun, the Chief Clerk of the Protectorate, and his son. Their charts and records were secret, transmitted only after oaths and prostration. Here, their chapter titles are outlined so that students of the true may glimpse their essence. Treatises and discussions are appended to the left. Thus, the fifth section is titled *Register of the Daoist Mountain*.\n\nFrom the Primordial Beginning, seven transmissions reached the Purple Void. From the Purple Void to the present spans forty-five generations. If the recipient is unworthy, the Dao does not flow in vain. As Liu Zhi of Hedong once said: “The Huayang of the Daoist gate is like the Ruist streams of the Yi and Si.” Thus, the sixth section is titled *Lineages of the Shangqing*.\n\nLiu Xiang said: “Heaven has its divine overseers; immortals fill its ranks.”",

      "translated_text": "The celestial bureaucracy of the Grotto Palaces derives from the *True Reports* and *Records of Mystic Communication*. As the cycles of time shift, appointments and promotions must follow. Like the rites of Zhou and the institutions of Han, they no longer remain the same. The divine Dao is profound and distant, beyond the ken of the worldly. Thus, the seventh section is titled *Register of the Immortal Offices*.\n\nThe mountain’s sources wind deep and hold space; reclusive scholars of lofty aspiration dwell in their recesses, their traces too scattered to chronicle. Here are gathered the most luminous exemplars of transcendent conduct from antiquity and the present. As for those who vanish in stillness, ascending unseen with the dawn’s light—how could their names be recorded? Thus, the eighth section is titled *Wanderings in the Harvest of Truth*.\n\nFrom the Wei and Jin through the Six Dynasties, they wove the realm’s fabric, dwelling dispersed among forests and foothills. Only in the Tang and Song did the flourishing of temples and monasteries begin, where rites of offering and blessing were observed—this is their ground. Thus, the ninth section is titled *Records of the Louguan Lineage*.\n\nCinnabar and treasured qi, gold and jade’s radiant essence: those who ingest them extend their years and transform their substance. Their nurturing moisture, accumulated over time, emerges in mushrooms, herbs, and trees—wondrous, numinous, and enduring in truth, for such is the inherent principle of things. Thus, the tenth section is titled *Catalogue of Numinous Flora*.\n\nSteles, inscriptions, and carved texts are the vessels and chariots of the Dao. The brushstrokes of perfected beings remain as models for emulation. For those who establish virtue, merit, or words, is not their legacy preserved herein? Thus, the eleventh section is titled *Record of Metal and Stone*.\n\nThe ancients collected poems to uphold the teachings of names and propriety. Verses composed in the mountains, though scattered and lost in great number, are all exquisite and fine phrases, worthy to adorn the end of soaring celestial hymns. Thus, the twelfth section is titled *Golden Lotus Anthology*.\n\nHere ends the compilation. In crafting this record, no distinction is made between past and present; every deed and every word is included for its utmost excellence. If accounts are distorted or compositions coarse and flawed—like the finger pointing at Huan—such entries are entirely omitted, not by oversight.\n\nAlas! The Grand Historian extolled the famous mountains of the world; the *Nanhua* lauded the vast and true perfected ones. Yet Mount Gouqu combines both virtues, its illustrious radiance compiled over a thousand and hundreds of years—never has there been such splendor.

      "translated_text": "The gracious favor bestowed was resplendent in imperial decrees. Though his immortal transformation cannot be recalled, his radiant spirit grows ever more distant. In cherishing memory of the departed crow, fitting honors must be conferred. Let him be posthumously appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness, with the posthumous title \"Master Ascended to Perfection.\" Let the relevant authorities carry this out.\n\nOn the seventh day of the second month in the second year of the Tiaolu era.\n\nBy imperial edict, the Daoist priests of Taiping Abbey in Runzhou shall follow the precedent of the Seven Temples, with a full ordination quota of forty-nine. Should vacancies arise thereafter, they shall be promptly filled through selection and reported accordingly.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the second month in the second year of the Tiaolu era.\n\nDecree from Empress Wu on the Posthumous Honors for Master of the Dharma Wang\n\nAlas! When Wang Qiao ascended as an immortal, he lingered at his old shrine; when Zheng Kangcheng’s Dao endured, it still extended within his former abode. How much more so for one whose traces were recorded in the immortal registers, whose name graced the sagely court—when we recall his departed dust, our distant longing deepens.\n\nThe late Daoist of Jade Purity Abbey, posthumously appointed Grand Master for Splendid Happiness and Master Ascended to Perfection, Wang Yuanzhi, was by nature in harmony with the Dao, his spirit roaming through transformations. From the outset, he plumbed the subtleties of the imperial apocrypha, attaining the principle of Heaven’s spontaneity. Across three reigns, he concealed his esoteric arts to conceal his brilliance; surpassing a century, he witnessed the unfolding of the sagely enterprise. Concealing the past and knowing the future, he discerned the obscure and perceived the distant. Repeatedly, he received the profound grace of former emperors, and the favor of posthumous honors. Now, to extend the mandate of later generations, it is fitting to elevate the rites of commemoration. Let him be posthumously appointed Grand Master of the Palace with Gold and Purple, with the posthumous title \"Master Ascended to Mystery.\" All else remains as before. Let the relevant authorities carry this out.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of the first month in the first year of the Sisheng era.\n\nTwenty-four Edicts from Emperor Xuanzong to Master Li Xuanjing\n\nEdict to Lin Yang, Governor of Danyang Commandery, and to the Daoist and lay elders and common people:\n\nWe have long revered the profound and wondrous, ever contemplating the numinous immortals. In cherishing this Mount Mao, we recognize it as a celestial cavern. The jade altars of its ancient abbeys remain in vestige, yet the essential scriptures of the Dao lie scattered, nearly lost. Reflecting on these sacred treasures, We are deeply moved. Now, for the sake of the people, We greatly exalt the root of the Dao. Thus, We have commanded the pure and cultivated to establish true rites, to seek the nearby numinous mountain, and to renew the abbey’s halls. May this allow the profound teachings to flourish anew, that all may know where to turn in reverence. May blessings descend upon the realm, bringing benevolence and longevity.\n\nMoreover, in recent years, We have consistently appointed officials of purity and tranquility, who have governed with excellence, while agriculture and sericulture have coincided with seasons of abundance. Among the people, none have suffered want.\n\nWe trust that you, the governor, along with the Daoist and lay elders and common people, are all in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of Our thoughts.\n\nEdict to Dong Gui, Inspector of Jiangdong Circuit and Governor of Jinling Commandery:\n\nThe mountains and peaks above divide the heavens, while below they stabilize the regions. They bestow blessings upon the people and dispense the grace of clouds and rain. Moreover, Mount Mao, with its divine splendor, is the Huayang Grotto-Heaven, the source of the Dharma’s teachings and the dwelling of perfected immortals. Though the rites of reverence are established, the heart of devotion should ever deepen in purity. Henceforth, within Mount Mao, let all logging, hunting, and fishing be prohibited. Let those from afar who consume meat and blood not be permitted entry. Should there be occasions for rituals, petitions, or prayers, let them be conducted with incense, herbs, and precious offerings—never with sacrificial animals. You and your subordinates must attend to this with care.\n\nWe trust you are in good health.\n\nEdict to the Perfected of Guangling, Li the Master of Refinement:\n\nYou are a person of the Upper Clarity rank, your aspirations soaring with the clouds and mist, harmonizing with the world while transcending it. For Our sake, you cultivate blessings, soon to ascend the Golden Altar. Thus, We compose a poem to honor your journey and praise your resolve:\n\nA scholar of the Purple Palace’s mist and haze,\nA master of the Dao’s profound Way.\nYour heart unites with the myriad sounds,\nYour will aligns with the Nine Immortals’ vow.\nBeyond the world, you leave the dust behind,\nWith kindred spirits, you delight in aiding the age.\nSeeking scriptures, you wander jade grottoes,\nExpounding teachings, you enter the jeweled steps.\nAt Mao Ridge, you follow the traces of the ancients,\nAt the Golden Altar, you fulfill distant thoughts.\nIn the Yin Palace, you peruse old records,\nIn the Yang Abbey, you adorn the new shrine.\nFrom afar, We recall the buried twin jades,\nEver cherishing the gathering of the five sacred herbs.\nIf the true immortals may be encountered,\nWe await the startling crane’s arrival here.\n\nHonored Master, you embrace the One and guard the center, exploring the subtle and illuminating the distant. Your purity and integrity have unfolded the gates of the Dao, uniting with the Great Harmony. As a patriarch of the immortal lineage, you have inspired Our reverence, adorning the numinous precincts and broadly seeking the true scriptures. Thus, We compose this poem to honor your journey, conveying Our profound regard. May it console you on the road and manifest Our esteem for the worthy.\n\nYou are aware of Our intent.\n\nEdict to Master of Refinement Li Hanguang:\n\nYour Dao is lofty as the Purple Palace, your learning encompasses the Yellow Court. Nobly, you have come at Our summons, unfolding the most wondrous teachings. Now, you turn your thoughts to Mao Ridge, seeking the true scriptures. Recently, you journeyed from the capital of Qin, venturing far beyond the world. We have long cherished the immortal realms, eagerly awaiting your diligent cultivation. May this allow the people of the Nine Provinces to together return to the profound teachings, and the hosts of the Three Clarities to look down and witness their observance. This is not merely dreaming of the land of Huaxu or directing Our sincerity toward the azure heavens. We imagine you, Honored Master, establishing the true rites, constructing the altar halls—from your first arrival to the completion of the structures—expending great effort. We trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of Our thoughts.\n\nEdict to Master of Refinement Li Hanguang:\n\nYesterday, Cheng Yuanxian arrived and presented the plans you submitted, which clearly outline the regulations. However, in adorning the immortal abbey and invoking the presence of the perfected, if the site is not secluded and tranquil, how could the rainbow robes and feathered canopies descend? Moreover, in the rituals, there are distinctions in rank. As for the perfected immortals and Daoist assembly, they must not reside together within the same precincts as the Purple Yang Abbey’s grand courtyard. No one should be permitted to dwell there. Instead, construct an open colonnade enclosing a purified hall to maintain the incense offerings and await the cloud-borne chariots. The Daoist assembly shall be accommodated in separate quarters.\n\nWe have now provided a detailed diagram, which should guide any necessary additions, and the requisite materials have been allocated. Honored Master, your embodiment of the true and your far-reaching insight, your harmonious nature inwardly refined, must surely align with the hearts of the numinous immortals above and fulfill the reverent intentions below. We trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of Our thoughts.\n\nEdict to Master of Refinement Li Hanguang:\n\nHonored Master, you have traveled far to renowned mountains, diligently seeking the supreme teachings. You have established altars and halls, transcribing the true scriptures.",

      "translated_text": "May your diligent efforts in all matters bring you weariness indeed. My aspiration to seek the essentials of the Dao and my distant longing for the true immortals shall rely upon your pure sincerity to cultivate the profound and wondrous. On the eighteenth day of this month, I shall purify myself in fasting and sanctify the altar to receive the scriptural decrees, praying for the descent of the numinous immortals’ blessings and their attestation.\n\nI now send the prayer texts and incense offerings with this letter. Honored Master, you must proclaim the ritual observances, present the prayers, and offer thanks, that they may ascend to the immortal palaces above and bring forth manifest responses below. The weather grows warm. I trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\nAdmonition to Refiner Li:\nThe Dao is the origin of all existence, and the Dharma is the covenant of the Nine Perfected. The Great Sage bequeathed these teachings to later disciples, that those who cultivate themselves might advance. I have long wished to reverently receive the scriptural Dharma but have not yet fully grasped its solemn mysteries. Moreover, many of the true scriptures have scattered and fallen into error. Recently, I sought out the vestiges left by the Heavenly Perfected, and in their rituals and observances, nothing was lacking. I have had them transcribed in strict accordance with the precepts. My long-held aspiration is now fulfilled, and I am grateful for the descent of the true numinous ones’ grace.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of this month, I shall reverently invoke the Three Pure Ones, the Grand Master, the Mystic Master, and the True Master, purifying myself in fasting to receive the sacred texts. Bearing the true scriptures, I shall reverently unfold the phoenix-script, directing my heart toward the realm of the Great Void to nurture the longevity of the Valley Spirit. The fragrant offerings have been prepared in full accordance with the scriptural traditions. I now enclose the prayer texts and seal them for dispatch. Honored Master, your mastery of the Dao’s essentials and your harmonious radiance, your purity and effortless virtue, align with my own aspirations. I entreat you, as my master, to present these prayer texts and fragrant offerings at the Golden Altar of the Numinous Treasury in the Huayang Grotto-Heaven of Mount Mao, as a token of sincerity to attest to my diligent devotion.\n\nThose of virtue are honored with noble titles. Thus, Ge Hong bore the appellation \"Master of Embracing Simplicity,\" and Tao Hongjing was known as \"Master of Integrity and Purity.\" The deeds of those who came before are not distant. Henceforth, I bestow upon you the title \"Master of Mystic Stillness,\" to illuminate your illustrious virtue and exalt your lofty conduct. I now dispatch an emissary for this purpose. The weather grows warm. I trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\nHonored Master, your harmonious virtue and your exploration of its essentials have led you to personally safeguard the fragrant offerings and invoke the true numinous ones. Moreover, the bestowal of this title serves to honor your diligent cultivation. The robes are a means to express reverence and devotion, a form to manifest veneration and to praise the beauty of the immortal ranks. I am grateful for your understanding.\n\nThe lingzhi you presented is indeed an auspicious sign. Like multicolored clouds spreading abundantly, its fragrance rivals that of orchids, flourishing in the blessed land of Ziyang. It is a propitious omen of the ascent of cinnabar sincerity, distantly resonating with the great jade lingzhi of Datong, forming a harmonious correspondence. The true immortals above have bestowed this felicitous sign in response to your pure sincerity. I am deeply gratified.\n\nI now command that prayer texts and incense be offered at the Heavenly Grotto, entrusting your lofty virtue to convey my devout heart. The lingzhi arises from harmonious qi and is overseen by the true immortals. In ancient times, the Yellow Emperor’s attainment of the Dao was marked by the repeated blossoming of the Three Wonders. I have long pondered these auspicious omens. Today, the golden radiance and vermilion hues of eighty-one stalks, their colors resonant with the golden square and their number aligned with the yang auspices, some with conjoined stems and paired calyxes, others with twin roots sharing a single branch, emerge from the Heavenly Grotto to flourish, adorning the medicinal altar with their splendor. This is a rare and wondrous occurrence, evoking profound gratitude for such extraordinary auspices.\n\nHonored Master, having presented your prayers and conveyed your sincerity, you have sent these true gifts from afar. I receive them with reverence. May great fortune attend, and may I partake of them. The weather is hot. I trust you are well.\n\nEdict:\nLonging for antiquity, I reflect upon the immortal precincts adjoining the grotto-palaces, the ancient abodes of the blue altars, and the numinous borders. The new halls of the Purple Terrace now gleam, revealing the true lineage. To manifest my reverent devotion, I have established households for repair and maintenance. Honored Masters, you have fulfilled my intentions with your pure and precious observances.\n\nEdict:\nThe weight of your virtue, Honored Master, is esteemed by the immortal perfected. Thus, the purification rites must be met with profound sincerity. Moreover, this mountain is the lung of the earth, where the blessings of the Controller of Destinies converge. Its courtyard altars lie near the heavenly palaces, the former abodes of the true persons. I, your disciple, am diligent in my aspirations to extend the realm of longevity to all living beings. Gazing eastward from afar, I yearn for you day and night. With the arrival of spring, I await the return of your wind-borne chariot to ease my longing for your wisdom and to receive the profound teachings of the Dao.\n\nThe autumn heat lingers. I trust you are in good health. This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\nEdict:\nThe alchemical furnace opens the immortal elixir, transmitted by the Nine Perfected. The courtyard yields lingzhi, overseen by the Three Maos. Such omens, recorded in the mysterious annals, have never before been heard. Only Wei Boyang foretold them in the past. Now, Li Yue has brought them to fruition here. I shall purify my heart and await the arrival of a special emissary to welcome you, that we may together receive the Dao’s blessings. I am grateful for your understanding.\n\nEdict:\nI have always revered purity and truth, personally seeking those of the Dao. My sincere request is difficult to refuse, so I have allowed you to fulfill your wishes and seek medical treatment. Now that your recovery is well underway, you should return soon.\n\n*Poem to Send Off Master of Mystic Stillness on His Temporary Return to Guangling, with Preface*\n\nMaster of Mystic Stillness embodies harmonious purity and delights in the Dao’s emptiness. Recently, he came to the capital, bringing blessings to all. Now, he yearns for the forests and springs, to cleanse his heart of worldly dust. I admire and esteem him, and to fulfill his wishes, I compose this poem to honor his departure, reflecting on his journey:\n\nYang and Xu opened the true records,\nWhile you, sir, secretly transmitted the covenant.\nNine stars linked beneath the purple canopy,\nTwin radiance merged in the cinnabar field.\nHolding the jade tablet, you serve at the Tortoise Terrace,\nA golden altar immortal of the grotto-palace.\nI still await the ease of riding the wind,\nMorning and evening, to welcome your cool return.\n\nRespectfully inquiring of Master of Mystic Stillness:\nMaster, you uphold the purity of unsullied integrity and possess the inner harmony that penetrates all principles. Your learning encompasses the nine schools, yet you transcend them in profound silence. Your heart roams the Eight Effulgences, ever blending with the light of the world. Your secret conduct and lofty virtue are truly admirable. Yet you have humbled your solitary resolve to broadly propagate the Way of salvation.

This letter conveys but a few words.\n\n**Decree to Master Li Hanguang**\n\nMaster, you have deeply penetrated the wonders of the Dao and long been renowned. The mountains of the Mao Lords of old are now the profound mysteries of the Grotto Realms. Given your virtue and conduct, I hold you in deep admiration.\n\nRecently, I have quelled the weapons of war and swept away the lurking evils, preserving the myriad people and securing the two capitals. The Supreme Emperor’s sacred carriage has been welcomed back to the palace. In this act of filial piety, joy and comfort descend from heaven. I look up in gratitude for the protection of the Mystic Origin, which has twice established the enterprise of the ancestral temples. Your precise cultivation and vows have also assisted in this.\n\nYou must devote greater care to the altar precincts, purify the incense and flames, and broadly extend the Supreme Emperor’s fortune and longevity, ensuring the well-being of all under heaven. The rectification of the Daoist gate rests with you.\n\nWith gratitude for your understanding.\n\n**Decree for the Construction of Ziyang Abbey**\n\nTo the Right Minister, the Merit-Offering Commissioner, Master Xuanjing Li Hanguang, and the Palace Attendant Supervisor Cheng Yuanxian, et al., jointly inspecting the construction of Ziyang Abbey on Mount Mao:\n\nThe aforementioned abbey has been completed, and the ritual offerings of thanksgiving to the above have concluded.\n\nOn the twenty-second day of the ninth month last year, upon submission of the report, it was decreed that the relevant authorities proceed with the construction of the abbey. A remainder of 104 strings and 285 cash was returned. Beyond the construction, this remainder exists.\n\nAs the abbey’s construction is now complete, upon submission of the report, it was decreed that the remainder be granted to the abbey’s household as permanent property. The local authorities have already allocated this sum to the Three Principles.\n\nI have consulted with the abbey’s director, Daoist Liu Xingju, and others, proposing that a nearby county establish a repository for pledges. Each month, the interest shall be collected to sustain the permanent property, with the principal remaining intact.\n\nI humbly hope that the abbey’s name be preserved, and that the land previously allotted to its disciples—measured in *qing* and *mu*—be made sufficient. This year’s grain tax shall be allocated, and next year’s provisions shall also be supplied to the abbey.\n\nPreviously, there were four slaves, six oxen (one small), and one carriage, all presently accounted for.\n\nI have now questioned the local county officials and the Three Principles regarding the abbey’s prior properties. Upon verification, the quantities are consistent. The grain provisions are already sufficient for annual use. Next spring, I request that cultivation of the abbey’s furnishings, the Five Phases, and other necessities be undertaken.\n\nThe abbey’s household was formerly impoverished, with few furnishings. During the recent merit-offering, Commissioner Cheng Yuanxian, by decree, supplied the Yellow Thread Fast. Beyond this, a remainder of one hundred taels of silver was returned. I have instructed that this be distributed to the abbey’s disciples to purchase the lacking furnishings, ensuring all are made complete.\n\nRegarding the abbey’s pines, bamboos, fruit trees, and other flora:\nI humbly note that the abbey lies on Mount Mao, where immortals gather. Though its halls are splendid, pines and bamboos are scarce. As the season is inopportune, planting has not been possible. I request that, come spring, planting be undertaken with care. Additionally, lotuses shall be sown in the southern pond, that the grounds may be fully adorned.\n\nRespectfully submitted as above.\nLin Yang, Governor of Danyang Commandery, presents this secondary report.\n\n**Memorandum from the Chancellery:**\nThe Danyang Commandery’s memorandum, in accordance with the decree, is approved.

Were it not for the sovereign’s virtue—peerless in this age—such numinous manifestations could never have arisen so swiftly.\n\nAccording to the *Cantong Qi* and corroborating scriptures, this elixir is said to ensure that the emperor’s reign endures eternally, his years spanning a thousand autumns. Though unheard of in former ages, this portent is now manifestly attested in our sagely era. Overwhelmed with boundless joy and exultation, we respectfully present this memorial in celebration.\n\nThe twenty-seventh day of the eighth month, the tenth year of Tianbao (751).\n\nYour servant Hanguang further states: Though I have long devoted myself to the Daoist teachings, I am inept in cultivating my own body.

At present, we are conducting rites of fasting and offerings at Maoshan for the welfare of the state, and our joy is beyond measure. I have sent the imperial messenger Dan Tingyao to inquire after Your Majesty’s well-being and now humbly present this memorial.\n\n---\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the tenth month, the eleventh year of Tianbao:\nYour humble servant Han Guang respectfully submits: Regarding the rites of fasting and offerings previously petitioned for at the eastern slope of Yugang Mountain, to the right of the Ziyang Abbey, we commenced on the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month and have continued the Daoist observances until the seventh day of this month, at the first light of the winter solstice. On that occasion, both the participants in the fast and the imperial messenger Qi Lingshuo witnessed sweet dew descending upon the pine trees in all directions around the altar. The dew was white in color, fragrant in scent, sweet in taste, and its abundance diminished with the distance of the pines from the altar. To date, we estimate that sweet dew has descended upon two hundred and thirty pine trees. As the *Daodejing* states, “When Heaven and Earth unite, sweet dew descends—no one commands it, yet it falls evenly.” The sages of old recorded this in their scriptures as an auspicious omen. That our rites of fasting and offerings should coincide with such a sign is most propitious. How could I dare withhold this news? I have dispatched my disciple Tang Ruoqian to accompany the imperial messenger Qi Lingshuo, bearing this memorial and presenting two measures of the sweet dew.\n\n---\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the first month, the twelfth year of Tianbao:\nYour humble servant Han Guang respectfully submits: Though the first month of spring still brings chill, I reverently pray that Your Majesty’s well-being may be ever blessed.

I have received one hundred bolts of silk, while the Daoist practitioners conducting the rites were bestowed two hundred bolts. Furthermore, I was honored by Your Majesty’s command to perform rites of purification, thanksgiving, and additional meritorious observances in accordance with the *He Tu Nei Pian*, for which I received seventy bolts of purple-woven silk for my life-cord, twenty bolts each of five-directional patterned silk, and five hundred taels of silver. Accordingly, on the last day of the twelfth month of the previous year and the first day of the new year, I first conducted the auspicious New Year’s fast at the Great Dragon Prosperity Abbey of the Great Tang in Guangling Prefecture, to enhance the blessings of the season’s renewal. Now, at the Ziyang Abbey on Maoshan, I have assembled fellow practitioners of the Dao who uphold the precepts, jointly preparing the ritual implements and rehearsing the ceremonies to ensure strict adherence to the proper forms before their use. Once the summer fast concludes, I shall report the proceedings in full. Yet I, who am of no talent, have been mistakenly entrusted with the Daoist teachings and, despite my unworthiness, have repeatedly received the state’s favor. Though I strive with utmost sincerity, how could I ever repay even a fraction?

On the nights of the ninth and tenth days, we conducted the formal fast in accordance with the proper forms, proceeding through the rites of obeisance and offerings.

      "translated_text": "Deputy Copyist of Imperial Edicts, Song Shao, *Edict Prohibiting Logging in the Mountains*\n\nIt has come to our attention that within the boundaries of Maoshan, near the temples, abbeys, and oratories, many disregard the regulations of cultivation and arbitrarily engage in logging or set wildfires to burn the mountain forests. This matter requires deliberation and specific directives.\n\nThe state now extends its blessings to nurture the people. These renowned mountains, recorded in the local gazetteers, are either governed by benevolence or serve as the abode of perfected beings. They are places where blessings descend and are rightfully deemed sanctuaries for the spirit. How, then, can axes and hatchets compete to fell them, or firewood-gathering proceed without restraint, causing the finest growth to wither and the numinous traces to fade from view? Thus, we issue this prohibition to manifest our reverence and solemnity.\n\nHereby, we command Runzhou and Shengzhou that, upon receipt of this imperial proclamation, they shall demarcate the boundaries on all four sides of Maoshan. Strict orders shall be enforced to sever all such activities. Henceforth, no person—including the officials, abbots, and custodians of the mountain’s temples, abbeys, and oratories—shall be permitted to engage in logging, felling, or setting wildfires to burn the forests.\n\nLocal patrol officers, officials, elders, and strongmen shall be charged with surveillance and inspection. Should any violations occur, the offenders shall be immediately apprehended and sent to the relevant prefectures and counties for interrogation. After a public display of fifteen days, they shall be released. If the scale of logging is extensive and the circumstances unforgivable, the offenders shall be detained and a report submitted for further instructions, after which they shall be sentenced and exiled accordingly.\n\nFor areas outside the temples, abbeys, and oratories where firewood is needed and the trees are not part of ancient sites or long-preserved growth, the county officials and the custodians of the abbeys shall jointly demarcate the boundaries and erect clear markers before any logging may proceed. Where trees have already been felled or burned, leaving gaps in the rows, the local prefectures and counties shall mandate the replanting of trees in those areas to ensure no barren spaces remain. No disturbances shall be tolerated.\n\nThis imperial proclamation shall be inscribed on stone and displayed at the gates of the abbeys and along major thoroughfares for all to know.\n\nThe 2nd year of the Dazhong Xiangfu era, by imperial decree as above.\n\nThe August Empress Liu bestows upon Master Zhu of the Dao a red imperial letter, along with a gold water vessel weighing thirty taels in total. This vessel was used by the Emperor in his youth and is now granted to the Daoist to purchase land for the sustenance of the Daoist community, providing for their daily meals and rituals.

The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* shall proceed as memorialized.\n\nYou, in solemn reverence, conduct the rites, reaching the celestial realms. Why have you not memorialized in full the portents and omens you have witnessed?\n\nAt this time of barley and wheat sprouting, we rely solely on the grace of timely rains. Yet since the onset of spring, the seasonal rains have been wanting, leaving the fields of the four directions unwatered and the hopes of a thousand granaries in dire straits. My heart is heavy with concern, and day and night I find no respite.\n\nYou must wholeheartedly grasp my deepest sentiments. With this earnest sincerity, redouble your prayers with utmost devotion.

You concentrate your qi to attain suppleness and nurture simplicity. Though the Dao is exalted and virtue esteemed, beyond the reach of rank, how can the correspondence of name and reality be set aside?\n\nThus, I renew the bestowal of this decree, that it may inspire later scholars.

Do not persist in refusal; you should understand this well.\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nSince the founding of the capital, the years have turned many times. I have cherished the singular virtue you possess, and through three autumns, I have not forgotten.\n\nUpon receiving your recent memorial, I rejoice to learn of your tranquility. Your chapters continue the former plans, the sacred halls are completed, and the precious records bring blessings—all now adorn the towering pavilions, awaiting the descent of the Supreme Perfection.\n\nYou have long guarded emptiness and transcendence, your loftiness surpassing the common. In maintaining the sacred halls, you harmonize the extremes of heat and cold with serene joy. On Mao Peak, you find contentment among the springs and rocks.\n\nYour memorial has been reviewed in full. An order has been issued to dispatch the Imperial Physician Su Gui to oversee and manage all necessary provisions. Memorialize whatever you require, and it shall be granted without deficiency.\n\nAs autumn’s frost arrives and the seasonal qi turns cold, may you further attain the wondrous Dao. Words are not needed to convey more.\n\nShould you witness any further calamities or omens, memorialize each in turn. As for the prayers previously offered, to this day no response has been received.

Dwelling on the Three Mao Peaks, your aspirations remain vast; purifying yourself, you preserve your true nature. Residing in the border mountains, your heart dwells beyond the mundane.\n\nI recall your wondrous Dao, serene and tranquil, your nature planted in purity and peace. You align with heaven and earth to nurture your loftiness, shedding the dust of the world to awaken to principle.\n\nUpon reviewing your recent memorial, I am pleased to learn of your thoughts.\n\nAs winter approaches, how do your movements and repose fare? I understand that in mid-spring you will journey to the capital. An emissary, Zhang Xu, has been dispatched to arrange your travel, and all relevant officials have been instructed to provide for your needs. Should anything still be lacking, memorialize in detail, that I may anticipate your arrival with joy.\n\nNow in the depths of winter, as the year draws to a close, in your broad dissemination of the true teachings and your aid to the sprouting grasses, redouble your efforts in cultivation to embody my deepest care.\n\nThis letter conveys my intent; further words are unnecessary.\n\n*Issued on the twenty-third day of the eleventh month in the third year of Chongning.*\n\nDecree to Liu Hun Kang:\nYour memorial has been reviewed in full, and your earnest sincerity is understood. As the year ends in bitter cold, I rejoice in your well-being.\n\nThe construction of the Abbey of Preserving the True still lacks decorative painting. An order has been issued to the relevant officials to enforce a strict deadline and complete the work with all haste. The matters of raising the ridgepole and the like are the responsibility of the respective offices—why must you report their completion?\n\nThe arrangements for your departure from the deep chamber and the planning of the canal transport have all been carried out.\n\nAs the early spring air warms, you should first journey to the capital without delay.

      "translated_text": "On the eighteenth day of the seventh month, fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nSince your departure from the imperial capital, many months and years have passed. Dwelling upon the renowned mountains and revering the sacred halls, you have devoted your utmost sincerity to serve the exalted immortals. You have expounded the origins of the Great Dao, illuminating the responses of the celestial spirits above. You have restored and expanded the temple precincts, gathering auspicious omens, magnifying the grand design of this single endeavor, and extending the radiant blessings of ten thousand years. All that you have presented has been marked by utmost loyalty. I eagerly await your audience; you may travel by boat at your convenience. As for your modest reluctance, I have already issued instructions accordingly. Now that the initial phase of the work is complete and the project nears its joyous conclusion, seize this autumn season and hasten your oars upon the tranquil currents. With the heavens high and clouds stilled, the clear light bathes a thousand miles of calm waves; waters emerald and mists verdant, a single sail billows in the gentle breeze. Still, I gauge your strength and encourage you to nurture your purity and loftiness.\n\nThis edict is issued to demonstrate my profound regard; may you fully grasp its intent. I shall soon witness your words in person.\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nOn the twentieth day of the eighth month, fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nI have reviewed your memorial reporting the completion of the repairs and your intention to embark by boat in the ninth month to attend court and offer thanks. I rejoice at the prospect of your leisurely journey along the Qinhuai, your luminous presence soaring like an immortal toward the imperial gates. I await the profound teachings of your subtle wisdom and revere the pure winds of your compassionate frugality. Your thoughts are ever fixed on governance and the preparation of fresh offerings, ever tending toward the true Dao. As autumn’s frost approaches, your travels must have been arduous. I have dispatched an emissary to convey my comfort and esteem. May this exceptional regard further strengthen your serenity. Prepare swiftly for your voyage to ease my longing. Autumn lingers—how fare you of late?\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nOn the twelfth day of the ninth month, fourth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nYour heart holds fast to the essence of the Dao, long attuned to the true origin. For years, you have dwelled in the realm of carefree ease, mastering the subtleties of harmony. Recently, your cloud-borne canopy arrived at the vermilion gates, and you graciously revealed the secrets of your renowned teachings. You petitioned to return to your former retreat on Maofeng, your resolve steadfast and earnest. I have reluctantly acceded to your request. Since your departure, a month has swiftly passed, and with each thought of you, I remain wakeful and forgetful of sleep. Though you recline in your secluded boat, I trust you have reached the borders of Huaichu, where the threefold auspicious herbs nurture your true nature beyond the dust of the world. Your lofty winds and distant ascent are truly admirable.\n\nAs the season battles the lingering heat, how fare you of late?\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nSince your departure from the capital, a month has quickly elapsed. I imagine your movements and stillness remain attuned to the Dao’s subtleties. With each glance southward, my longing and admiration only deepen. Regarding the matters you entrusted in your memorial, await the celestial will and present them swiftly. Additionally, I request several dozen talismans for wind ailments to be sealed and forwarded. As the season remains oppressively hot, tend to your clarity and emptiness. I trust you have arrived at the palace—how fare the repairs? Have you completed the work on the meditation hermitage? Report each detail in your memorial.\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the fifth month, fifth year of Chongning.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nI have reviewed your memorial regarding the presentation of the sacred writ. Truly, utmost sincerity must reach the heavens, and diligent cultivation will evoke response. The details are preserved in the true canons, and the rites are clearly set forth in the sacred codes. Your reverent heart has prayed with purity, your spirit soaring in devotion, silently communing with the exalted immortals to receive their secret decrees. Were it not for the fullness of your public loyalty, how could your sincerity ascend so purely? Your swift arrival brings profound admiration.\n\nRecently, you earnestly sought to decline the journey to the capital and petitioned to return to your former abode. The three peaks of Maoshan are indeed a fitting retreat for one of your loftiness, a sanctuary where past sages have dwelled, fulfilling your aspiration to withdraw and cultivate the spirit. You must further refine yourself to match my earnest hopes. As the season turns to scorching heat, how fare you of late?\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nSince your departure from the capital, months have again passed. With the days growing hotter, I imagine your mastery of the Dao keeps you serene. Your memorial of auspicious omens fills me with admiration—were it not for your profound understanding of the lofty Dao, how could such blessings be attained? If you have further insights, send them with Huang Xisou; do not conceal anything. Also, itemize any deficiencies in the palace and report them in detail. The work on the meditation hermitage has yet to be announced as complete—are the repairs to your satisfaction?\n\nAs before.\n\nAn edict to Liu Hun Kang:\nYour disciple Fu Xilie has presented a memorial, from which I understand your dedication to emptiness and your dwelling in purity, attaining the wondrous principles of non-action and plumbing the depths of the Great Dao. Since arriving at Wanning Palace, you have enjoyed abundant leisure. The three peaks of Maoshan and the Purple Mansion, the blessed courts of past sages, the abodes of true immortals—all respond to your presence like an echo. You treasure the Golden Registers to refine your qi and guard the Jade Tablets in your pure cultivation. I trust you find ease and leisure, sustaining the incense and flames to pray for the tranquility of the imperial house above and the well-being of the people below. Your earnest devotion is duly noted.\n\nYour sealed memorial has arrived, deeply moving me with its distant sincerity and further demonstrating your diligence. Though our separation has been brief, I thirst for your wisdom. As the scorching heat persists, take care to protect yourself.\n\nHow fare you of late?\n\nThis letter conveys my message, and I shall say no more.\n\n---\n\nFu Xilie and others have presented a memorial, informing me of your arrival at Yuanfu Wanning Palace and your successful presentation of the sacred writ, for which you have received the compassionate favor of Heaven and the bestowal of auspicious signs. Your Dao emulates the three peaks of Maoshan, your conduct follows the two masters Xu, briefly visiting the imperial court before returning to your native mountains—how could the crane-borne chariot be detained? Though I deeply cherish our bond, your recent kindness has weighed heavily on my thoughts. Your presentation of the sacred writ has borne the august gaze of Heaven, and I humbly receive its profound instructions, ever mindful of its warnings, day and night revering and striving to fulfill its radiant decrees.\n\nAs the scorching heat intensifies, take care to preserve your well-being. The rest is as conveyed in the edict. All matters in your memorial have been addressed accordingly. If further needs arise, report them in detail.",

Thus, I compose this ode:\n\nUpon the peaks of Mount Juqu,\nThere stands a dwelling.\nWho is this man?\nHe embodies the primordial before the Emperor.\nHe enlightens those who come after,\nRefining his person.\nAbiding in stillness with sincerity,\nHe preserves the true.\n\nIn the Yuanfu era of old,\nA chamber was built beneath.\nIts construction was unhurried,\nLeft for those to come.\nI have received this legacy,\nContinuing its thread.\nI have followed its design,\nRestoring these halls.\nSurveying this abbey,\nIt befriends the heart,\nCompleted without delay.\nTo aid those who follow,\nI augment its name,\nCalling it **Wanning**,\nInscribing it upon the plaque,\nTo pacify the luminous spirits.\n\nThe Dao is vast and without bounds,\nIts essence and function constant.\nIn virtue, it is imperial;\nIn deeds, it is kingly.\nAdvancing in this Dao,\nOne becomes one with it without end.\nMay the spirits heed this,\nAnd bring harmony to all under heaven.\n\n*Written in the bingxu year of Chongning, inscribed in the Xuanhe Hall.*\n\n---\n\nSince our parting in early summer, nearly half a year has passed. Though separated by distance, my longing for your presence weighs heavily upon me. Each time I raise my gaze, I am moved to sigh at the length of the journey. Since your return to the mountain, my admiration has only deepened. I have composed a poem to express my sentiments, which is now sent to you along with this missive—please acknowledge its receipt.\n\nI yearn for our conversation, yet the time for meeting remains distant. As the golden winds approach, may the harmony of heaven preserve your well-being. The talismans have been received; I now request several more for wearing.\n\nThe bestowal of grace has already been enacted—may you be aware of this.\n\n---\n\n**Imperially Composed and Inscribed Poem on the Return of Mysterious Master of Serene Harmony to the Mountain**\n\nIn those years, you sought the Dao from a lofty master,\nOnce donning the rosy clouds to reach the purple court.\nYour body is a minstrel beyond the three mountains,\nYour heart untouched by a speck of worldly dust.\nThe migrating geese gaze into the distance, your secluded dwelling far,\nThe swallows of congratulation return to the newly built grotto abode.\nI thank you for transmitting the wonders of the heart’s method—\nBeyond this truth, there is no other truth.\n\n*First day of the ninth month, fifth year of Chongning. Composed and inscribed by imperial hand.*\n\n---\n\n**Edict to Liu Hun Kang:**\n\nYour repeated memorials have been received in full. Your Dao is as lofty as the two Xus, your virtue spans the three Maos. As the patriarch of the teachings and a master who propagates the true wind to aid all beings, you humbly decline the imperial carriage and dwell in the renowned mountains. Though our meetings are rare, I long for the profound words of your pure and refined character.\n\nEach time you present your memorials, your earnest devotion is deeply appreciated. All the matters you have requested have been enacted. Your disciples have been bestowed the fine title of **Ninghe**. The grand stele has been permitted for carving, with the transport bureau overseeing its completion.\n\nNow, in the realm beyond the world, all is at peace; wind and rain arrive in due season. The grace bestowed by the August Emperor brings well-being, aided by your devout cultivation. As the frosty autumn arrives, though our meeting remains distant, I urge you to take care of yourself to ease my longing.\n\nThe **Preface to the Edict** is now sent to you by courier—please receive it with gratitude.\n\nI trust you remain in good health. This missive conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\n*Twelfth day of the tenth month, fifth year of Chongning.*\n\n---\n\nSince our separation, autumn has deepened. I crane my neck toward the south, my thoughts racing. Each time I receive your letters, my longing is greatly soothed. In the emptiness and stillness of the mountains and forests, I imagine your spirit roaming in serene detachment, finding peace.\n\nThe **Poem on Your Return to the Mountain**, the **Ode on the Abbey’s Completion**, and permission to carve them, along with other imperial decrees, are beyond precious. Beyond preserving them in the abbey’s records, guard them as if they were ten thousand times more valuable.\n\n---\n\n**Edict to Liu Hun Kang:**\n\nYour memorial on the merits and virtues for the **Tianning Festival** has been received in full. You nurture your vastness in the mountains and forests, dwelling in truth beyond the world, yet your loyalty is devoted to the state, your aspiration to cherish the sovereign. As the month of his birth approached, you widely partook in the pure rites to offer blessings. Your memorial was presented, and my admiration runs deep. Thus, this edict is issued to inform you. As winter’s chill sets in, I trust you remain in good health. This missive conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\n*Twenty-fourth day of the tenth month, fifth year of Chongning.*",

Your heart roams Penglai Isle, and in seated reverence you greet Kongtong; you guard the mysteries of cultivating truth and embracing the One, penetrating to the root and returning to the source of life—thus, at the auspicious Qingcheng retreat, immortal lamps appeared as auspicious signs. This arises from the ascent of pure devotion, filled within by utmost sincerity, and thus felicitous omens gather while the numinous responds in kind. All living beings share in this blessing, and its splendid benefit is beyond words. Since reading your memorial, I have been deeply moved and full of praise.\n\nI have also learned that on a chosen day in mid-winter, you personally journeyed to Yongsheng to perform the burning of yellow talismans.

Had it not been for your profound sincerity moving the unseen, how could such a thing have come to pass? Putting brush to paper only deepens my admiration, though our reunion remains uncertain. My yearning only grows, and I urge you to care for yourself, truly fulfilling my hopes.\n\nI hear that in past years, when you performed the burning of yellow talismans, the cold was severe. Guard your health upon the road. On the day you return to your hermitage, seek out several dozen more [talismans/rites]. As before.\n\nAdmonition to Liu Hun Kang: You steadfastly uphold the true teaching, carefully preserving the celestial mandate. Dwelling in mountain caves, you wander freely; revering the dharma records, you abide in tranquility. Given your profound virtue, it is fitting that you receive praise and honor. Already I have bestowed poems in proclamation, and further expressed my admiration in eulogies. You have submitted a memorial requesting their inscription in stone, and I approve. Your cinnabar sincerity, diligent in jade-like refinement, has moved me to command that the imperial barge convey them to your abbey’s walls.

My regard for those who dwell in truth is ever present, even in dreams. I yearn for your exemplary presence, yet our separation has swiftly passed another year’s end. To converse again would surely yield profound insights. Thus, I dispatched envoys with all haste to urge your arrival. Yet your sealed memorial suddenly arrived, pleading illness and seeking to decline. How could I not be moved? Yet propriety cannot be compelled. For now, I shall suspend the summons and await a more auspicious time. Take care in your rest and recovery, that it may reflect my deep regard.\n\nThe season warms—how is your health of late? This letter conveys but a fraction of my thoughts.\n\nA year has passed since we parted, and my longing has only grown. Having reviewed your two memorials, in which you pleaded illness to decline the summons, I have issued a separate decree granting your request. You should understand this clearly. Remain in seclusion, nurturing your spirit, to preserve your longevity and well-being—your reserves are surely abundant.\n\nRegarding the Daoist sanctuary, I have already responded. Master Chi Yi’s petitions have all been reviewed and implemented. Once further instructions arrive, suspend them, and have Master Zhu proceed to court for an audience.

Dwelling in stillness, you shun worldly distractions; preserving your inner light, you do not display it.

This brings me great comfort, though the distance from your lofty counsel only deepens my admiration.\n\nEarly summer is mild and harmonious—take care in nurturing your Dao.\n\nAt the end of the month, my eyes suddenly grew dim.

      "translated_text": "Deputy Scribal Edict to Song Shao’s Edict, Imperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nOur separation has grown long, and the summer’s glare weighs heavy—yet my thoughts of you have only deepened. I imagine you reclining among the towering clouds and mountains, nurturing your lofty spirit beyond the mundane, moving with ease through the realm of self-attainment. My admiration for you knows no bounds.\n\nIf there are matters you wish to convey, do not hesitate to speak them aloud. Await the swift arrival of my messenger from the west, that I may hear your full intent in person. Whatever you have witnessed there, spare no detail, however trivial, and send it by post. Let no suffering of the people in that region remain unknown to me—this is my earnest hope.\n\nThe summer’s heat rages fiercely; guard well your inner harmony.\n\nMaster Huang has arrived and reported all matters as you instructed. With reverent purification, I have written a sealed memorial and entrusted it to you, Master, to present upon your audience. This would be most fortunate. Once the Celestial Response is received, hasten to report it in full.\n\nI have also instructed Master Chi Yi to deliver to you the memorial from the Noble Consort, which shall accompany him on his return to the mountain.\n\nI send two scrolls of imperial brush paintings—one of the Primordial Heavenly Worthy, the other of the Most High Dao Lord—along with last year’s painting of the Most High Lord Lao, to form a triad of the Three Pure Ones for your silent veneration. Five volumes of the *Scriptures of the Northern Dipper*, twenty folding fans, ten kinds of fruit, and offerings of incense, flowers, dragon-brain incense, tea, and candles—all have been counted and entrusted to Master Chi Yi. Additionally, fifty blank ordination certificates from the Bureau of Sacrifices, and thirty purple robes. Should you require ordination for disciples, those under Master Chi Yi’s guidance shall be granted purple robes and the title of Master.\n\nFifteen attendants accompanying you shall all receive ordination and gifts of silk, each according to rank.\n\n*Dated the twenty-ninth day of the seventh month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\nThe talismans you have repeatedly bestowed upon me, I dare not keep for myself. If anyone falls ill, I shall administer them, that I may fulfill your intent to heal and save.\n\nI request several dozen more talismans to be sent by post.\n\n---\n\nImperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nI have reviewed your memorial and its appended records, and all is clear to me. I am further informed that your memorial of prayer has reached the celestial realm, and that you have received the profound and secret responses. My admiration runs deep.\n\nHad you not awakened to the wondrous subtleties of the inner vision, aligning with the Dao to nurture the true, and devoted your thoughts to the welfare of the people with such sincere and silent devotion, how could such attainment have been possible? My joy is beyond measure.\n\nAs summer turns to autumn, your blessings only grow. In the intervals between my myriad duties, I often turn to the essentials of the Dao, and my longing to hear your words is as urgent as thirst for sweet water.\n\nSpring is not far off; I expect your arrival from the west. Do not let modesty keep you from fulfilling my deepest wishes.\n\nThe autumn air is crisp and solemn. I trust you are well. My words here are few, but my thoughts of you are constant.\n\nLong have I been deprived of your virtuous presence; I can only strive to draw nearer to it.\n\nYour recent memorials, received by post, speak of your serene and abundant cultivation in seclusion. All matters you have reported through Master Jing shall be examined and acted upon.\n\nNext spring, you shall come to court. Further instructions will be sent; I shall not elaborate here.\n\nWhen spring waters rise, take a small boat west. Do not resist my will.\n\nAs autumn wanes and frost descends, guard your health above all else.\n\n*Dated the fifth day of the ninth month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\nImperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nI have reviewed your memorial offering prayers for the Celestial Tranquility Festival. All is understood.\n\nAs the early winter season approaches the imperial birthday, you shall conduct solemn rites upon the jade altar, invoking boundless blessings for the empire. That one beyond the world should not forget his devotion to the throne is a loyalty most commendable. My admiration only grows.\n\nThus, I issue this decree, that you may know my thoughts.\n\nEarly winter finds you well, I trust. My words here are few.\n\n*Dated the fourteenth day of the tenth month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\nOur separation has been long, and my longing for you is constant. I rejoice to hear that your Dao is pure and your conduct untroubled.\n\nRegarding your memorial declining the summons to court at the year’s beginning, I have not yet granted your request. I truly wish to see you again, to receive your guidance. Our parting has been too long, and your repeated refusals, though earnest, seem almost a rejection. Yet the waters flow gently—what hardship would there be in coming?\n\nAfter the New Year, another decree shall be issued. For now, tend well to your celestial harmony.\n\nNext spring, I shall send an envoy to summon you. Do not refuse or resist my command.\n\n---\n\nImperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nI have reviewed your recent memorials. All is understood.\n\nYou dwell in the seclusion of Mount Mao, nurturing the true beyond the mundane, moving with ease and contentment. Your every action is blessed. Your offerings and words have reached me, and my admiration for your devotion is profound.\n\nThough the subtleties of your discourse remain distant, my thoughts ever turn to you.\n\nI have repeatedly issued edicts summoning you to court next spring. Yet you delay, reluctant to engage with worldly affairs, preferring to nurture your lofty spirit. I urge you to set aside your resolve and grace me with your presence, rather than persist in defiance of my wishes.\n\nConsider well my regard for you, and do not disregard my words.\n\nAs winter begins, guard your inner harmony.\n\nThe cold has set in; I trust you are well. My words here are few.\n\n*Dated the ninth day of the tenth month, first year of the Daguan era.*\n\n---\n\nYour memorial regarding the elevation of the titles of the Three Mao Lords has been reviewed and approved according to ritual precedent. You shall be informed of the details.\n\nAt the year’s beginning, you must come to court. Do not refuse my command.\n\nWhat I seek is only your intimate and profound presence.\n\nAs winter’s severity grows, take utmost care of yourself.\n\nI request several dozen more talismans; your kindness would be deeply felt.\n\nThe affairs of the palace gates are ever on my mind—how could I not be concerned?\n\n---\n\nImperial Decree to Liu Hun Kang:\n\nYour keen insight into the true mechanism of the Dao shines with the radiance of the highest Way. Every memorial you submit resonates deeply with my heart.\n\nYour earnest petition for the ennoblement of the Three Mao Lords, in reverence for the Dao, is most fitting. I shall instruct the relevant offices to bestow upon them the most illustrious titles.\n\nYou are hereby granted these honors; receive them accordingly.\n\n*[Missing character] month: may you preserve your well-being.*\n\nHow I long for the day when the rivers swell and your journey is unhindered! My thoughts of you are unceasing.\n\nAs spring approaches, I eagerly await your arrival. Travel by boat without hesitation.\n\nWhen the season of growth arrives, refine your spirit with utmost clarity.\n\nThe winter is cold; I trust you are well. My words here are few.\n\nSince we parted, how have your days been? When your divine canopy travels east, I think of you often, and cannot help but sigh.",

Foreseeing fortune and misfortune, you awaken the deluded masses; at times manifesting in talismanic breath, you cure the multitudes of their ailments. Though your body dwells in the forests and valleys, your name resounds in the capital. We have admired and marveled at you, summoning you to court for leisurely audiences, where We have repeatedly heard your profound discourses, deeply resonating with Our heart. Recently, you again came to court, residing in the Jade Pavilion, where you effortlessly submitted to transformation, in unspoken accord with Us. Reflecting on your steadfast devotion, it is fitting to bestow honor upon you. Thus, We confer the rank of Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, equivalent to that of a Remonstrating Censor. This exceptional grace is granted in anticipation of further offerings. We posthumously confer upon you the title of Grand Master for Thorough Counsel.\n\n**Epithet \"Jingyi\" (Tranquil Unity) Decree:**\nWe reflect upon the cavern by the winding stream, which lies north of Mount Tai and south of Mount Luofu. It bears witness to the scriptural registers of the River Chart and is renowned as the \"Lung of the Earth.\" Embracing the Dao within its sacred precincts, it was once the refuge of lofty recluses. The true wind has not been forgotten, and the traces of the past remain evident.\n\nTo the late Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Liu Hun Kang: you stood beyond the dust of worldly entanglements, taking emptiness and stillness as your foundation. You observed the subtle upon the altar of metal and jade, preserving your radiance in the earth where jade is buried. You admired the true wind of the Southern Marchmount and glimpsed the profound mysteries of the Western City. Though the multitudes sought you, you departed as if shedding a cicada’s husk. We now bestow a laudable epithet to honor your memory.\n\nMay this serve to illuminate the merit of the Orthodox Unity, and may it inspire the flourishing of the teachings of Primal Emptiness in times to come. We hereby posthumously bestow the epithet \"Jingyi\" (Tranquil Unity).\n\n---\n\n**Decree Granting the Name \"Yuanfu Wanning Abbey\":**\n**Memorandum from the Ministry of Rites:**\nTo the Maoshan Yuanfu Abbey of Jiangning Prefecture and the Maoshan Yuanfu Temple: By imperial decree, you are to be renamed \"Yuanfu Wanning Abbey.\" Upon receipt of this memorandum, comply with the decree accordingly.\n\nMemorandum issued on the __ day of the first month of the fifth year of the Chongning era.\n*Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Acting Minister of the Right, Deng; Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Acting Minister of the Left, He; Minister of Works, Right Grand Councilor.*\n\n---\n\n**Decree for Rewards to Officials Overseeing the Construction of Yuanfu Wanning Abbey:**\nObserving the blessed lands, We have established this abbey to guide the people in welcoming the radiant essence. The Hanlin Academician and Left Court Gentleman for Discussion, Hu Shiwen, and others have diligently fulfilled their duties, bringing this project to completion. In recognition of your meritorious efforts, We promote you in rank. As a timely reward, We hereby appoint you as Grand Master for Palace Leisure, retaining your current post and duties.\n\nTo Jiangdong Circuit Transport Commissioner, Gentleman for Announcement of Righteousness, Qiao: you are hereby promoted to Gentleman for Propagation of Virtue, retaining your current post and duties.\n\nTo Gentleman for Service, Magistrate of Jurong County, Bao Shen Ci: you are hereby promoted to Gentleman for Announcement of Righteousness, retaining your current post and duties.\n\nTo Right Attendant-in-Ordinary, Supervisor of Jiangning Prefecture’s Embankments, Gao Shi Qian: you are hereby promoted to Left Attendant-in-Ordinary.\n\nTo West Head Attendant-in-Ordinary, Gao Gong Ding: you are hereby promoted to East Head Attendant-in-Ordinary.\n\nTo Probationary Official, Zhang He: you are hereby promoted to Attendant-in-Ordinary.\n\nTo Commissioner, Ye Cheng: you are hereby promoted to Probationary Official.\n\nTo Three Divisions Commissioner, Meng Zhong: you are hereby promoted within the Three Divisions.\n\nTo Probationary Official and Magistrate, Bao Shen: you are exempted from the triennial evaluation for three years.\n\n---\n\n**Additional Decree:**\nThe construction of the Hidden Spirit Hermitage and other structures at the Yuanfu Wanning Abbey of Jiangning Prefecture’s Maoshan, as well as the installation of the imperial calligraphy plaques, are matters of no small importance. The following officials overseeing the project are to be rewarded accordingly:\n\nVice Commissioner Liu He: promoted one rank.\nJiangning Prefecture Administrator Fan Xi Yi: granted exemption from the triennial evaluation for three years. Upon completion of your current term, you are to be reappointed.\n\nAmong the project supervisors, Palace Attendant of the Inner Chambers, Sun Ming Yi: promoted one rank.\n\n---\n\n**Decree Granting the Name \"Zangzhen Abbey\":**\n**Memorandum from the Ministry of Rites:**\nTo the Jiangning Prefecture Zangzhen Abbey, the former residence and burial site of the late Liu Hun Kang, now a Daoist abbey: By imperial decree, you are hereby granted the name \"Zangzhen Abbey.\" Upon receipt of this memorandum, comply with the decree accordingly.\n\nMemorandum issued on the __ day of the __ month of the second year of the Daguan era.\n*Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, Acting Minister of the Left, Yu; Grand Preceptor, Left Grand Councilor.*\n\n---\n\n**Decree for the Posthumous Enfeoffment of Lu Xiujing as \"True Man\":**\nWe reflect upon the lofty recluses of antiquity, whose names have not faded, yet whose titles were not commensurate with their virtue. It is fitting to posthumously honor them.\n\nThe Master of Simplicity, Lu Xiujing, attained true essence within and bequeathed scriptures as a model for posterity, transcending the world with effortless grace. His former hermitage on Mount Lu remains, and upon verification, We now bestow upon him the title of \"True Man.\" This is not merely to honor his past footsteps but also to inspire those who hear of him to recognize the path of the Dao and strive accordingly.\n\nWe hereby posthumously enfeoff him as \"True Man of Cinnabar Prime.\"\n\n---\n\n**Decrees for the Enfeoffment of Five True Men:**\n**Decree:**\nWe reside in the celestial palace, gazing upon the Terrace of the Azure Dragon, beholding the divine realm of the Three Blossoms and aspiring to the wondrous teachings of the Nine Flowers. Revering the footsteps of the assembled immortals, We illuminate their transformative merit.\n\nTo Yang, True Man and Upper Assistant of the Eastern Flower and Director of Destinies: you have delved deeply into learning, exploring the subtle, and aligning your heart with the vast. You have received the hidden instructions of the Central Yellow and the secret transmissions of the Southern Perfected. Governing the lands of Wu and Yue, you oversee the essentials of the divine spirits. As you propagate the supreme Dao, it is fitting to bestow upon you a lofty title. May this reflect Our profound regard and perpetuate the blessings of Our favor.\n\nWe hereby enfeoff you as \"True Man of Penetrating Spirit and Manifest Transformation.\"\n\n**Decree:**\nThe Three Blacks conceal the numinous, defying the measure of names and words; the myriad spirits coalesce in transformation, beyond the reach of analogy. In bestowing honors upon the perfected, We indeed expand the supreme Dao.\n\nTo Guo, True Man and Attendant Gentleman of the Jade Terrace: your merit spans the Ten Poles, and your rank resides among the Nine Palaces. Holding the Jade Token of Radiance, you soar through the Great Ultimate; supporting the Morning Canopy of the Eastern Flower, you attend the August Emperor of the Void. As you greatly propagate the fundamental principles, it is fitting to confer upon you a distinguished title. May this reflect Our profound regard and eternally protect Our flourishing enterprise.\n\nWe hereby enfeoff you as \"True Man of the Great Tenuity and Preserved Radiance.\"\n\n**Decree:**\nWe descend to the Jade Realm of the Assembled Perfected, ascending the Dragon Terrace of the Azure Radiance. Here, We examine the records of the primordial shoulder and aid the living in the mortal realm.",

Upon reflection, I recognize my own lowly inadequacy, yet willingly submit to the court’s statutes.\n\nI venture to observe that since antiquity, those who attained the Dao and ascended to True Being have succeeded one another as objects of the age’s reverence, each taking the support of the world and the establishment of the Teaching as their personal duty. After the Three Mao True Lords ascended in flight, there followed Yang, Guo, and the Two Xus. All these Perfected Ones cultivated the Supreme Dao in concentrated refinement at Juqu, where the Heavenly Perfected descended to bestow their regard and personally transmit secret instructions, and the teachings of the Shangqing scriptures gradually spread among humankind. By the time of the Liang and Song dynasties, the True Wind had grown faint and sluggish, yet the sagely Dao remained unbroken, like a sash. Only Master Tao the Recluse strove to uphold the Teaching with subtle words, elucidating the profound purport of the Dao’s essentials, to the fortune of all under heaven in later ages. Yet while the Three Mao brothers were recently honored and ennobled by the court with sacred titles, the remaining Perfected Ones have not, to my knowledge, received any such distinction.\n\nIn my foolishness, I humbly beseech Your Sagely Compassion to confer upon the Perfected Ones Yang, Guo, Xu, and Tao—following the precedent of the Three Mao True Lords—augmented and exalted titles in their present immortal offices. A separate memorial will set forth the ranks of the various immortals for Your Majesty’s consideration.

Favored across three reigns, We too have extended him due courtesy.

Through the intercession of lords and ministers, his petitions for state and people have never failed to move the divine, spanning over thirty years—yet his Daoist rank remains unadvanced. In the sixth year of the Jiading reign, he was specially granted the title *Master of Penetrating Mystery*. Later, in the fourteenth year of the same reign, he received an imperial mandate to offer incense and conduct rites on Mount Mao. Upon completion, he memorialized to retire and return to the mountain. We issued an imperial rescript: \"Senior Master Yi Rugang has rendered meritorious service in prayer; he shall not retire yet. To honor his devotion, let him be granted the augmented title *Master of Penetrating Mystery and Preserving the True*.\" Now, he respectfully presents two scrolls of imperial calligraphy bestowed by Emperor Ningzong, beseeching the Ministry of Rites to issue an edict in recognition, thereby ennobling the sacred mountain and enhancing its role in prayer. Awaiting your decree.\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the seventh month in the first year of the Baoqing reign, by imperial command, the Ministry of Rites is ordered to issue the edict.\n*Edict:* Let Yi Rugang be granted the title *Master of Penetrating Mystery and Preserving the True*. Memorial received and approved. Edict hereby issued on the ___ day of the seventh month in the first year of the Baoqing reign.\n\n**Jade Tablet Inscription for the Golden Register Dragon Offering**\nIn the first year of the Jiaxi reign, cyclical year *dingyou*, on the twenty-sixth day of the ninth month (the first day being *jiyou*), the filial imperial heir, Your subject Yun, humbly prays for the perpetuation of the state’s destiny and the blessing of an heir. With reverent devotion, he presents incense and conducts the *Chongke* rites. Twenty-one Daoist masters are commanded to perform the *Lingbao* Daoist ritual at the Yuanfu Wanning Abbey in Jiankang Prefecture for one day and two nights, concluding with a grand offering to the Three Hundred and Sixty Divine Positions. Thereby, he petitions Heaven and Earth, invoking auspicious omens. Following ancient precedent, he respectfully deposits a golden dragon and jade tablet at the Hua Yang Grotto-Heaven of the Supreme Clarity Altar. May the Most Sacred and True perceive this sincere offering and deign to transmit it to the Nine Heavens.\n\nYour subject Yun, reflecting that the crown prince’s position remains vacant, with no propitious dream yet manifest, and that border defenses are strained, troops still deployed—within, he seeks to strengthen the state’s foundation; without, he yearns to pacify the scourge of war. Mindful of the arduous accumulation of our ancestral legacy and the pressing fear of succession, he now offers this grand sacrifice to the Supreme Emperor and beseeches the sacred mountains. May they bestow their encompassing benevolence and mighty sustaining power: grant a son to fulfill the *Zhen* and *Suo* omens, extending the dynasty’s line for a hundred generations; still the weapons of war to achieve great peace, securing governance in all four quarters; fortify the foundations of the state and bring tranquility to the people. May we forever draw near to this divine favor and rely upon the great creation.\n\nYour subject Yun, with utmost sincerity, prostrates himself in prayer.\n\n**Edict for the Ennoblement of the Dragon Spirit of the Guangji Temple**\n*Edict to the Marquis of Broad Blessings and Responsive Aid:*\nThe dragon’s essence is formless, its spirit boundless—yet even the humble earthworms of Mount Mao, dwelling place of perfected beings, possess the power to inhale and exhale. How much more, then, should one who has basked in the sun and moon of cinnabar favor become a vessel of numinous efficacy? The authorities have attested to its merits: timely rains and sunshine, the nurturing of crops. Truly, it fulfills the principles of sacrifice. Let its title be expanded and ennobled to enhance its glory. As Jinling is Our auxiliary capital, its duties are profound, its service extending to the domains of the marquis and the royal domain. Let it be specially enfeoffed as the *Marquis of Broad Blessings, Responsive Aid, and Beneficent Salvation*.\n\nBy edict as above.

Receiving the secret decree from the Western Flower of the Tortoise Terrace, he was invested by the myriad spirits and established the ancestral altar of Golden Mound at Jurong. His cinnabar radiance has remained ever-new for a thousand years, the precious qi of the Three Peaks ever-firm. Auspicious omens arose, and the people to this day extol him; he summoned rain and calmed winds, for Heaven aids those who act in accord with the Dao.

      "translated_text": "**Volume Four of the Mao Shan Gazetteer concludes**\n\n**Volume Five of the Mao Shan Gazetteer**\n*Composed by Liu Dabin, Hereditary Master of the Supreme Clarity Tradition*\n\n**Records of the Three Divine Ones**\n**The True Lineage of the Mao Lords**\n\nThe Great Lord of the Controller of Destinies bore the surname Mao, personal name Ying, and style Shushen. He was a native of Nanguan in Xianyang.\n\nThe Mao clan traced its roots to the Ji lineage, its virtue and benevolence accumulating across generations, its blessings flowing through a hundred families. His great-grandfather, named Meng, styled Chucheng and also Benchu, possessed profound insight into the mysterious and distant. Discerning the rise and fall of dynasties, he foresaw the decline of Zhou and refused office under the feudal lords. Instead, he became a disciple of Master Guigu of Beiguo and Bei’e, retiring to Mount Hua. There, he attained the Dao and ascended to heaven in broad daylight, riding a dragon, in the thirtieth year of the First Emperor of Qin, on the gengzi day of the ninth month.\n\nAt the time, a children’s rhyme in the village sang:\n*\"The immortal attained is Mao Chucheng,*\n*Riding a dragon to ascend into the Great Clarity.*\n*Now on the Dark Continent, he sports in Crimson City,*\n*And in succession, one after me, shall be Ying.*\n*Should the Emperor learn this, let the twelfth month be renamed Jiaoping.\"*\n\nUpon hearing this, the First Emperor inquired of the village elders, who explained: \"This is the song of immortals, exhorting the Emperor to seek the safeguard of longevity.\" Thereupon, the First Emperor, stirred to action, resolved to seek immortals and renamed the twelfth month *Jiaoping*.\n\nHis great-grandfather, Yan, styled Taineng, was the fourth son of Meng. He served King Zhao of Qin as a retainer and was later promoted to Colonel of Chariots and Cavalry, enfeoffed as the Reverent Marquis of Changping. His grandfather, named Xian, styled Shilun, served King Zhuangxiang of Qin as the Marquis of Guangxin. When the First Emperor ascended the throne, he was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Dexin. He fathered six sons, all renowned in their time. His sixth son, named Zuo, styled Yanying, neither served in office nor pursued scholarship, but aspired to farming and sericulture. He had three sons: the eldest was the Great Lord of the Controller of Destinies; the second, named Gu, styled Jiwei; and the third, named Zhong, styled Sihe.\n\nThe Lord of the Controller of Destinies was born in the fifth year of the *zhongyuan* era of Emperor Jing of Han, a *bingshen* year, while his two younger brothers were born in *wuxu* and *gengzi* years, respectively. From youth, the three brothers were endowed with extraordinary conduct, their natural talents keen and perceptive. They held themselves aloof from worldly affairs, delighting solely in purity and emptiness. Once, the Lord of the Controller of Destinies said to his brothers: \"Worldly affairs are tangled and perilous, like treading on thin ice. We should emulate the lofty retreat of the High Ancestor, aspiring only to the steadfast integrity of reclusion.\"\n\nAt the age of eighteen, he left home and bid farewell to his parents, entering the mountains of Heng. There, he studied the *Dao De Jing* and the *Commentaries on the Zhouyi*, gathered herbs, and consumed elixirs. He concealed his radiance in the cliffs, practicing for six years. His concentrated devotion moved the divine, and in a dream, he saw the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery holding a jade tablet, leading him and saying: \"In the Western City dwells Lord Wang, who has attained the true Dao. Why not seek him out and receive his teachings?\"\n\nAwakening at dawn, he journeyed directly to the Western City. After three months of fasting and purification, he suddenly beheld Lord Wang, riding a divine tiger and guiding its reins along the sacred ridge, soaring above the embroidered crags. Thereupon, he cast himself over obstacles, surrendering his life to the true Dao. Unaware, he arrived at Lord Wang’s abode. Lord Wang silently dispatched his attendants to escort him, bringing him to the Jade Terrace within the Tower of Flowing Efflorescence. After a long while, he was led forward. Kneeling and knocking his head to the ground, he begged for the gift of longevity, prostrating himself and repeating his entreaties without cease.\n\nLord Wang glanced at his attendants and said: \"His form and spirit have endured hardship; it seems he is truly resolved.\" Thereupon, he was guided and instructed, warned never to slacken, and was retained in the Grotto Palace. For seventeen years, he served as an attendant, handling robes and sandals. Seeing his diligence and discretion, Lord Wang gradually entrusted him with managing the records of garments and scriptures. After another three years, Lord Wang commanded his carriage and traveled to White Jade Turtle Mountain, taking the Lord of the Controller of Destinies with him to visit the Queen Mother in the Azure Forest Palace.\n\nThe Queen Mother said: \"To bring a mortal clad in flesh to the Numinous Terrace—is this not laborious?\" Lord Wang smiled but did not answer. The Queen Mother turned to the Lord of the Controller of Destinies, who bowed twice and begged for esoteric essentials. Knocking his head to the ground, he pleaded: \"I, Ying, am a lowly and base creature, born of withered bones. How dare I, with this unworthy body, aspire to the years of dragons and phoenixes? With the substance of a morning mushroom, I seek the span of accumulated moons. Though I gaze toward the distant stream, none can aid me. I constantly fear that one day I shall perish in the trials of seeking, becoming a laughingstock to the vulgar. Having encountered Lord Wang, my bitter cinnabar has been transformed, and I have roughly received the arts of refining the body. Who could have imagined that today I would behold your sacred countenance? In a daze, I see the great image, as if submerged in a divine dream. To save the living and protect the dead, I come as a beggar, beseeching the gift of the essentials of longevity, to briefly awaken this walking corpse.\"\n\nThe Queen Mother said: \"Your heart is truly sincere. Long ago, I studied under the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning and the Great Emperor of Fusang. He bequeathed to me essential teachings: the *Dao of Jade Pendants and Golden Perfection*, the *Scripture of the Supreme Mystery and the Dark Truth*—truly the rare treasures of heaven and humanity, the wondrous secrets of the Celestial Thearch. Do you wish to hear them today?\"\n\nHaving spoken, she urged Lord Wang to expound the *Scripture of the Dark Truth* and personally recited the *Text of Jade Pendants and Golden Perfection*. Then, she spoke of the Celestial King of Primordial Beginning and the Great Emperor Lord, saying: \"This is the *Hidden Book of the Two Radiant Ones of the Grand Empyrean*. There are also the *Two Radiant Ones of Yin and Yang*, the *Inner True Talismans*, and the original texts that accompany them. By the law of the Most High, only those appointed as Controllers of Destinies may receive them. You, with your jade tablet and dark potency, inscribed with the script of the Supreme Clarity, are destined to become a Lord of the Upper Ministers and assume the office of Controller of Destinies. This Dao shall later be separately transmitted to you. However, without first learning the *Dao of the Dark Truth of the Hall of Light*, you cannot obtain the *Hidden Book of the Grand Empyrean*. The *Dao of the Dark Truth* is the method of consuming the sun and moon, the safeguard of refining the five spirits. It is not taught to disciples of the Total Perfection, nor is the potency of the Controller of Destinies transmitted to those without a mandate.\"",

      "translated_text": "Having spoken thus, the Perfected King and the Master returned to the Western City, where they followed the true instructions and practiced accordingly. After three years, the Master’s eyes gleamed with divine radiance, and his face took on the luster of jade. The Perfected King then bestowed upon him a dose of the Nine-Turned Returning Elixir and a sacred formula, setting up an altar to swear an oath of secrecy. Forbidding any disclosure, he sent the Master away, saying: \"Your Dao is now accomplished. A hundred years hence, seek me at the Southern Marchmount, where I shall confer upon you an immortal office in the realm of Haoyue.\"\n\nAfter taking leave of his teacher, the Master wandered the world in humble guise, unadorned by worldly pretensions. He claimed to have entered the northern valley of Mount Da to study the arts of the Confucian and common schools. At the time, he was forty-nine years old, and his parents were still living. His father, enraged upon seeing him, said: \"As a son, you are unfilial—abandoning your duty to care for us while roaming far and wide. I shall disown you as if you were never born.\" He sought to punish him with a staff, but the Master knelt and pleaded: \"I have received a mandate to attain the Dao, and the Dao’s way is to withdraw from the world. One cannot serve both paths at once. Though I am far from your daily care, I bring peace to our household and longevity to my parents. I have already received the talismans and registers of a sacred teacher, and the soldiers of the Heavenly Cadets cannot strike me. Should you harm me, the Three Offices will investigate—this is no trifling matter.\"\n\nHis father’s anger remained unappeased, and he wished to test the Master’s claims before others to dispel doubt. Raising his staff to strike, the staff shattered into fragments, which flew about, piercing pillars and embedding in walls. His father, realizing the Master was no ordinary man, ceased and said: \"What you say is true, but if you had struck an ordinary person, they would have been injured.\" He then asked: \"If you have attained the Dao, can you revive the dead?\" The Master replied: \"Those whose heavenly allotment is exhausted or whose sins are grave cannot be restored. Only those who died untimely may be revived.\"\n\nThe Master then summoned the Earth God. His father, standing in the central courtyard, asked the Earth God: \"Among the dead in this village, who can be called back?\" The Earth God replied: \"So-and-so Li Yi.\" The Master said: \"Hasten to command the relevant authorities to dispatch him. Once the matter is settled, report back.\" After sunset, the Earth God returned and announced: \"The matter of So-and-so Li Yi has been resolved; he may now be released.\" The Master then instructed the deceased’s family to dig up the grave and open the coffin. The dead man showed signs of breath but could not speak. Lifted from the coffin, he sat up and spoke clearly after three days. Several graves were opened, and all the dead revived, living for decades more before dying again. Near and far, people hailed the Master as a divine sage.\n\nLater, powerful nobles and feudal lords sought his favors, but the Master sealed his spiritual gates and blocked his wondrous powers, telling them: \"When I first studied the Dao, I meditated deeply in the mountains, and the mountain spirits aided me, enabling me to command them. It is not that I myself have attained such divine mastery as to control life and death over all things.\" When pressed relentlessly, he feigned severe illness, even to the point of near-death.\n\nHe concealed his depths, adapting to circumstances without constraint. Though people marveled at his attainment of the Dao, none could fathom his true actions. More than ten years later, his parents lived to a ripe old age before passing away. The Master observed mourning rites in full, remaining at home for fifty-three years in all.",

During the reign of Emperor Jing of Han, he was recommended as a Filial and Incorrupt candidate, and in the first year of the Yuanshuo era, he was nominated as a Worthy and Good man. He was appointed Gentleman of the Five Offices, and in the second year of the Zhenghe era, he was promoted to Grand Tutor to the Crown Prince. In the first year of the Yuanfeng era, he was appointed Commandant Breaker of the Hu and Governor of Wuwei.\n\nThe youngest brother was known as the Lord of Preserving Life. From youth, he was renowned for his integrity and conduct. He withdrew to Mount Huayin, and in the third year of the Jianyuan era of Emperor Wu, he was recommended as a Square and Upright candidate but declined. He moved to Liang State and became an honored guest of the Filial King. In the second year of the Dijie era of Emperor Xuan, he was appointed Magistrate of Luoyang, then promoted to Commandant of the Western Regions and Governor of Shangjun.\n\nWhen Emperor Yuan ascended the throne, the youngest brother was appointed Grand Master of the Five Elders and later transferred to serve as Governor of Xihe. At that time, the second brother was serving as Commandant of the Capital. As they both prepared to assume their posts, elders and youths from their hometown—several hundred in all—gathered to see them off. The Master was also present, addressing the guests: \"Though I have not served as a high minister with a salary of two thousand *shi*, I shall hold a divine office. The Heavenly Emperor has chosen me to fill the position of Supreme Minister of the Eastern Peak, Lord of the Forest of Thunder, and Controller of Life and Death, overseeing the registers of life and death in the realms of Wu and Yue. I shall also supervise the selection of those who study the Dao, testing and verifying those who attain early transcendence. This is indeed a key position among the highest immortals and the divine palace’s ancestral masters.\"\n\n\"On the third day of the fourth month next year, I shall ascend. Will any of you be able to visit me as you do today? If you come, there will be no need for any expense—I shall provide for you myself.\" The guests all agreed.\n\nWhen the appointed day arrived, several *qing* of land before the Master’s gate suddenly leveled themselves. A canopy of green silk was erected, beneath which layers of white felt were spread, enough to seat hundreds. Word spread far and near that this family’s master had attained the Dao and was about to depart. Young and old gathered in throngs, filling the roads, their numbers far exceeding those who had come to see off his brothers. Golden platters and jade cups, rare delicacies and precious fruits appeared before the guests of their own accord. The radiance was dazzling, beyond description. Strings and winds, bells and chimes resounded through heaven and earth, while fragrant aromas carried for miles. As the feast flowed on, all six hundred guests drank and ate their fill.\n\nThe next day, when the welcoming officials arrived, the Master bid farewell to his family, then addressed his clansmen and disciples: \"The true path of immortality is hidden, prizing obscurity over ostentation. One should not seek to display brilliance or adorn oneself with false embellishments to dazzle the eyes and ears. The reason I could not silently withdraw, conceal my light, and ascend unseen from the empty peaks was to use this path to inspire and encourage my brothers’ pursuit of the Dao. How could I alone have been so deluded as to turn back? All under heaven with a seeking heart should turn their gaze toward the hope of attaining divine transcendence. Though Jiwei and Sihe have seen this, they will surely repent in time, resign their offices, abandon their salaries, and come to seek me.\"\n\n\"For now, I shall pause at the eastern banks of the Jiang River, on Mount Juqu. Within this mountain lies a numinous abode, where countless caverns interconnect, their grottoes stretching endlessly—a true immortal’s sanctuary. Long ago, I made a vow with my sacred teacher to first purify and discipline myself here, reverently awaiting heaven’s decree. Only afterward shall I ascend to the great Huo Peak and dwell upon the Red City.\"\n\nHaving spoken, he bid farewell to all, then mounted a feathered carriage, drawn by dragons and tigers. Rising into the void, he departed. After traveling eastward for over ten *li*, he suddenly vanished from sight.",

      "translated_text": "In the fifth year of Emperor Yuan’s *Chuyuan* reign, the *ding-chou* year, the Master was one hundred and two years of age. He crossed the Jiang River and temporarily settled on Mount Juqu, where he explored the grotto-palaces within, selecting true immortals for advancement. On the mountain’s northern slope, he built a thatched hut—now known as the Lower Lodge. There, he took charge of the earthly registers, determining life and death. Black tigers served as his guardians, white cranes came and went, and his numinous presence shone across the lands east of the Jiang. His Dao and virtue spread through a hundred towns, and the people of Wu and Yue vied to become his servants. Thus, the mountain was renamed Mount Maojun in his honor.\n\nHis two younger brothers, still in office, heard the people speak of their elder brother ascending to immortality in broad daylight. Only then did they believe that transcendence could be learned and the divine attained, realizing that the legends of Master Red Pine and Wang Qiao were no empty tales, and that the cauldron at Mount Dinghu held truth. They resigned their posts, returned home, and in their twilight years, sought to follow the Master’s abandoned practices—but to no avail. They said to one another: \"Our elder brother has attained the Dao; he is no stranger. Why not seek him out, receive his oral instructions in person, and follow the methods in the esoteric texts to guide the world? Even if we fail to reach the end, at least we will not die in vain.\"\n\nIn the fifth year of Emperor Yuan’s *Yongyuan* reign, the *ren-wu* year, on the sixth day of the third month, they crossed the Jiang River to find their brother on the eastern mountain. Overcome with sorrow, they wept as they listened. The Master said to them: \"Why have you awakened so late?\" His brothers replied: \"We were foolish and dull, blind to the Dao and virtue, lost in the dust of the world, chasing its fleeting pleasures, and serving the Han court. Our families remained intact, our ranks reached governor and minister, and our long lives were all due to your divine protection. Sheltered under your grace, we lived without awareness—until you left, and it was as if heaven and earth had vanished. We are not made of metal or stone; our lives must end. Now, in our decaying years, we fear death may come at any moment, our breath lingering but a morning or evening away. When we returned home, we tried to follow your abandoned practices but received no true instructions and saw no results. Now we have crossed the river to serve you, hoping to receive your teachings. Grant us long life and deliver us from death.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"You are already old; it will be difficult to restore you. Even if you receive the true instructions, you may only become earthbound immortals. The great arts of ascending to the Upper Clarity and soaring through the heavens are not what I have studied.\" Thus, he taught them the Way of swallowing the first sprouts of green herbs and the fluid of *qi*—a method to prolong life without death. Later, he told Jiwei: \"You should take the *Four-Fan Powder of the Yellow Emperor*, which I once received from Master Gaoqiu and now pass on to you.\" To Sihe, he said: \"You should take the *Queen Mother’s Rejuvenation Powder*. Your constitution is less depleted than Jiwei’s, so this will replenish your essence and nourish your brain.\" Both formulas were wondrous methods.\n\nThe two brothers diligently followed his teachings, taking the medicines, swallowing *qi*, and cultivating stillness and concentration. They also practiced all the precepts for preserving life. After eighteen years, their complexions became like those of youths. The Master said: \"The medicines have taken effect.\" He then transmitted the higher Dao, teaching them to visualize the *qi* of the Mysterious True within the Hall of Light, to refine and circulate their generative essence, and to harmonize their souls and spirits. After three years, their divine radiance began to manifest. The Master then bestowed upon each a dose of *Ninefold Cyclically Transformed Elixir* and a sacred formula. Thus, their immortal Way was accomplished.\n\nThe Master then petitioned Lord Wang, stating that his two brothers had received heavenly grace and deliverance, becoming earthbound immortals. According to immortal law, they were to receive registers, talismans, and official appointments, taking charge of their respective domains. He requested that their protection be extended. Lord Wang replied: \"You have studied the Dao from a young age and never wavered in diligence. I pity your steadfast resolve and have thus aided you. Having firmly submitted your petition, I will serve as your guarantor before the Supreme. The Most High has granted permission, bestowing upon them the mandate of divine immortals. Your brothers, sheltered under your grace, enjoyed wealth and nobility, but their indulgence and dissipation depleted their *qi*. They linger only in breath, now over a hundred years old—no longer the time to learn the Dao. Receiving divine powders and sacred formulas, they may transform and prolong their lives; is this not enough? Should they not simply accept their positions as earthbound immortals? Moreover, since ancient times, brothers attaining immortality together has been rare. Yet your great-grandfather attained the Dao, his benevolence extending to all things. The virtue he accumulated has now manifested in you. Your compassion and kindness, your constant practice of hidden merits—these are truly pitiable. You have repeatedly petitioned for your brothers’ immortal offices. Now, I bestow upon them the *Elixir of Jade Fluid from Mystic Water*. Let them fast and take it. Be cautious not to reveal it to others. You must separately petition the Supreme Emperor and vouch for their efficacy. You shall bring them yourself.\"\n\nAt that time, though the two brothers had inwardly connected with the divine and outwardly commanded the Six *Ding* spirits, they had not yet been deemed worthy of an audience with the great celestial perfected, such as Lord Wang, for their status was unequal. The Master instructed his brothers to purify themselves, take the elixir, and consume the sacred fungus, then together perform a three-month fast of the heart. They journeyed to the Palace of the Azure Lad and the Square Cauldron, inscribing their names on golden tablets. Next, they went to the Grotto-Palace of the Western City to pay homage to the Prime Minister of the Assembly of Perfected. Traveling south to the Vermilion Terrace on Mount Heng, they visited the Perfected of the Great Void and the Red One, then returned to the Palace of the Square Cauldron to request the registers of the Three Perfected of Earthly Immortality. They proceeded to the Red City to receive the talismans of true transformation and spirit, then to Mount Luohuo to seek embroidered banners. Finally, they ascended to the Nine Palaces, journeyed to the Golden Portal, and received the scriptures of the Sacred Lord, prostrating themselves at the portal for three months.\n\nThe Sacred Lord then commanded the Supreme Minister of the Nine Radiant Perfected, Lord Wang the Grand Director of Destinies, and the Azure Lad, Master of the Lofty Dawn, to ascend to the Palace of the Great Dao of the Supreme and the Hall of Harmonious Dawn. There, they petitioned the Vermilion Palace Envoys to descend and bow before the Golden Portal, presenting their petitions. In an instant, two envoys arrived with thousands of attendants. The envoys handed over the purple silk scriptures to Gu and Zhong. The purple silk registers contained two imperial edicts and supplementary documents. After receiving the scriptures, the Master urged his brothers to take their leave and return to their domains. Thus, Jiwei was granted the title *Perfected of the Earthly True and Divine Lord of the Register of Destinies*, while Sihe was appointed *Immortal Lord of the Three Offices, Preserver of Life*.",

Long ago, I made a vow with my sacred teacher to first purify and discipline myself here, reverently awaiting heaven’s decree. Only afterward shall I ascend to the great Huo Peak and dwell upon the Red City.\"\n\nHaving spoken, he bid farewell to all, then mounted a feathered carriage, drawn by dragons and tigers. Rising into the void, he departed. After traveling eastward for over ten *li*, he suddenly vanished from sight.",

      "translated_text": "Each proceeded to their domains in accordance with the commands inscribed on the purple silk. The divine palaces and upper bureaus also allocated resources to the two lords as required.\n\nThe Director of Destinies resided on Mount Gouqu for forty-three years. In the second year of Emperor Ai’s *Yuanshou* reign, the *gengshen* year, he reached the age of one hundred and forty-five. On the eighteenth day of the eighth month of that year, the *jiyou* day, the Vermilion Perfected of the Southern Marchmount, the Lord of Western City, the Queen Mother of Mount Gui, and the Azure Lad of Fangzhu together visited him in the mountains.\n\nAt that time, the Celestial August Emperor dispatched envoys from the Brocade Garment Court of the Unbounded Realm to bestow upon him a divine seal and jade tablets. The Lord Emperor of the Grand Tenuous Heaven sent the Left Palace Attendants of the Three Heavens to present him with an eight-dragon brocade palanquin and a robe of purple feathers adorned with floral patterns. The Supreme Lord of the Great Dao sent the Grand Master of Harmonious Dawn to confer upon him the True Talisman of the Golden Tiger and a bell of flowing gold. The Sage Lord of the Golden Portal commanded the Perfected of the Grand Ultimate to dispatch the Jade Gentleman of the Supreme Mystery of the Orthodox Unity, gifting him the Four Nodes, Swallow’s Embryo, Luminous Flowing Gold Essence, the Radiant Divine Mushroom of Everlasting Brilliance, and the Night-Glowing Cave Herb. He was instructed to bow and consume them.\n\nAfter fastening the seal, donning the robe, straightening his cap to face north, and securing the talisman and bell, the envoys addressed him, saying: \"He who consumes the Four Nodes and the Hidden Mushroom of the Grand Ultimate shall be ranked as a True Minister. He who consumes the Jade Mushroom of the Swallow’s Embryo from the Golden Portal shall be ranked as a Director of Destinies. He who consumes the Luminous Golden Essence of the Eastern Palace shall hold the office of Registrar. He who consumes the Night-Glowing Cave Herb of Everlasting Brilliance shall become a True Earl, concurrently assuming the duties of Chief Inspector of the Left and Right.\"\n\n\"You have today consumed all of these. Your lifespan shall be as enduring as heaven and earth, and your rank shall be that of *Supreme Perfected of the Eastern Marchmount, Director of Destinies, and Minister of the East*, overseeing the divine spirits of Wu and Yue and commanding the mountain origins of the lands east of the Jiang.\"\n\nUpon concluding their words, the envoys departed. In an instant, the Lords of the Five Thearchs each arrived in chariots of directional hues, accompanied by their retinues, bearing the mandate of the Great Emperor to present him with the Nine Bestowments and their supplementary documents. The Nine Bestowments were inscribed on tablets of purple jade, engraved with yellow gold, appointing him as *Supreme Perfected of the Eastern Minister, Director of Destinies*. He prostrated himself to receive the documents, bowed twice, and the divine officials and Perfected of the Five Thearchs departed. Only the Master Lord Wang and the Queen Mother of the West remained to host a grand celestial banquet for him. The Queen Mother commanded her attendants to perform music and sing the *Song of the Mystic Clouds*:\n\n*\"Though the Great Image seems vast and void,\nI grasp the gates of the Nine Heavens.\nParting the clouds, I drift through the Eight Sceneries,\nSwiftly descending to the lower earth.\nThe hollow echo of the Mystic Sound,\nThe Supreme Spirit brooks no chill.\nThe Great Emperor...*\n*...awakens to the toils of wind and dust,\nNurturing the spirit within the Three Origins,\nAbsorbing essence beneath the Jade Portal.\nThen riding the myriad-dragon post,\nDescending with the phoenix’s gaze upon the Nine Wilds.\"*\n\nAnother verse followed:\n*\"The Mystic Garden bars the Northern Terrace,\nFive Cities gleam in towering splendor.\nUnlocking the boundless ford,\nFloating upon the Weaving Maid’s River.\nAbove, ascending the Crimson Court,\nBelow, roaming the sun’s hidden vale.\nGazing beyond the Eight Desolations,\nPointing toward the Nine Voids afar.\nSuddenly, weariness is unfelt,\nHow could one know little or much?\nSummoning the maidens with a touch,\nThe distant voids harmonize in an instant.\nExquisitely attuned to nature’s accord,\nThis is the Song of the Mystic Clouds.\nThe divine melody unfolds in celestial rhythm,\nThe true sound, free of all deviation.\"*\n\nAfter the song concluded for some time, they all proceeded to the palaces of the two lords. The two lords prostrated themselves in welcome, facing north and declaring their reverence as humble servants. The Queen Mother addressed them, saying: \"Though your Dao is accomplished, your knowledge remains insufficient. I shall arrange for you both to receive something here.\"\n\nPresently, she dispatched her attendant Guo Mixiang to convey a message to the Supreme Primordial Lady. The two lords did not know who the Supreme Primordial Lady was. The message read: \"The True King of the Nine Numinous Powers of the Western Tortoise Mountain.\" They respectfully acknowledged her but had not met her for over a thousand years, as celestial duties had kept her occupied, preventing their reunion. \"Teaogu and Zhong have attained the Dao and have come to visit. Long have I refrained from inquiring after mortals. As host and guests sit facing each other, melancholy lingers. Could you grace us with your presence, even briefly?\"\n\nShe replied that she would deign to come and would await them. The attendant departed and soon returned. The Supreme Primordial Lady also sent an attendant to convey her response: \"Ahuan bows twice and inquires after your well-being. Though separated by the Crimson River and burdened by official duties, my longing for your radiance remains undiminished. Upon Mixiang’s arrival and your summons, I shall prepare my carriage. However, the Celestial August Emperor has just commanded me to attend to the records of the Three Origins in the Grove of Rarities. I shall go briefly and return promptly. I shall don my sash and hope you will tarry a while.\"\n\nThe two lords then asked the Queen Mother who the Supreme Primordial Lady truly was. The Queen Mother replied: \"She is the mother of the True August Ones of the Three Heavens, the Supreme Perfected of the Upper Primordial, and the registrar of the names of the jade maidens of the ten directions.\"\n\nAfter about two hours, the Supreme Primordial Lady arrived, heralded by the sounds of flutes and drums and the neighing of dragon-horses in the empty sky. Upon her arrival, she was accompanied by thousands of attendants, all women, around sixteen or seventeen years of age, their forms and countenances luminous and graceful. Many wore robes of green damask, their brilliance dazzling the eye. The Lady appeared to be eighteen or nineteen, her divine bearing impeccable. She wore a robe of crimson frost, draped with a fur-lined brocade cloak of azure feathers. Her hair was styled in a triple chignon, the rest cascading to her waist. She wore a crown of the Nine Dawns’ Radiant Sun, a girdle of six-faceted fire-jade pendants, a sash of phoenix-patterned lin-hua jade, and a sword of flowing yellow luminous essence.\n\nShe entered the chamber and bowed to the Queen Mother, who stopped her and invited her to sit beside her. A banquet was prepared for the Supreme Primordial Lady, facing north, no different from that of the Queen Mother. Lord Wang urged the two lords to bow twice and declare: \"Gu and Zhong, of dull and base nature, were born and raised in the turbid and chaotic world. Like those who face a wall, we have never glimpsed the true Dao. Yet, fearing death and cherishing life, we have followed our master’s guidance. Today, our deliverance is by heaven’s grace. We humbly beseech your instruction.\"",

When worn, they enter the Grand Tenuity, advancing directly to the fore of the guards. With civil might, they repel the martial; prostrate, they embrace the gatekeepers’ posts. Ascending the Upper Clarity, they shake their forms in the jasper chambers. To the left, they roam the Grove of Rare Delights, ever summoning the Lords of Immortals; to the right, they nest upon White Mountain, gazing down upon the Grand Void. Crossing the Celestial Ford, they ride clouds and mount dragons; wandering these sacred peaks, perfected beings attend their chambers. Ten thousand spirits offer protection; mountain sprites oversee their welcome. In motion, they possess the eight-scenery jade chariot; in stillness, they repose in the golden hall. This writ is wondrous indeed—what is called the *Jade Girdle and Golden Chime*.\n\nSurrounding it are *The Three Primordials’ Flowing Pearl and Cinnabar Scenery*, *The Essence of the Dao*, *The Hidden Earth*, and *The Eight Arts of the Great Ultimate and Green Radiance*. These can reverse aging and restore youth, turn white hair back to infancy, shatter a thousand demons, and command a hundred spirits. They summon the yellow essence of the bright moon and obtain the crimson radiance of the white sun. Concealing the body and veiling its light, they transform the myriad things. Emerging from water and entering fire, they rebuke the dark netherworld. They bind tigers and leopards, summon the Six Dings, conceal themselves in the eight earths, and invert the five stars. With prolonged vision abiding in the body, they incline the ear to heaven.\n\nHow much more so with *The Concealed Writ of the Grand Empyrean*—the marvelous script of the Eight Assemblies? Its use is subtle and boundless; one may ascend the palaces of Jade Capital, drifting and floating into the halls of streaming rosy clouds. One becomes lord of the Five Peaks, sits upon the Director of Destinies’ couch, embraces the rich wine of phoenix marrow, and rinses the goblet of elixir and cinnabar. Mounting eight dragons to soar through the void, one rides the purple clouds of the empty vastness, soaring high and far.\n\nThereupon, the Supreme Primordial Lady rose from her seat, in her left hand holding the four scriptures, and in her right the covenant of transmission. Facing heaven, she intoned a blessing to the two lords: 'The vastness of the Nine Heavens, the radiance of the Supreme Luminary, the divine illumination of the mysterious and subtle, the clarity and emptiness of pure brightness—those who ascend the rare attain the wondrous; those who guard their qi live. With utmost sincerity, the Dao is attained; in stillness, the true is perfected.'\"",

      "translated_text": "To command the spirit and humiliate the form is to pacify the essence and flourish the years. The stone’s essence and golden radiance conceal the luminous and record the form. Summoning spirits to left and right, one wields the celestial tally to activate the numinous. Thus may one pace the void or dissolve the form. To live long and endure, one’s brightness equals heaven’s. To violate the covenant or leak its secrets invites calamity that topples the clan. Each must guard against disaster—I dare admonish you, Master Mao.\n\nWith the blessing complete, the two lords bowed to receive the sacred scriptures, clasping them beneath their arms. The Queen Mother of the West also rose from her seat, holding the *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean* in hand. She commanded the attendant maiden Zhang Lingzi to present the covenant of mutual trust. Facing the Director of Destinies, she extended her hands to deliver the book and intoned toward heaven: “Heaven is high, earth is low; the Five Peaks anchor the form. The primordial essence stirs the qi, and the vast expanse is darkly pure. Heaven revolves through the nine paths; the six harmonies endure in peace. The *Hidden Writ of the Grand Empyrean*, jade pendants and golden seals, the *Jade Luminance* and the *Eight Assemblies*—treasured scriptures of the highest chapters. Ascend and traverse the Grand Ultimate; enter the Jade Chamber of the Supreme Clarity. To leak it is to invite trial; the body incurs heavenly misfortune. He who receives it must be vigilant—I dare admonish you, Mao Ying.”\n\nThe lord prostrated himself to receive the hidden writ. Once the feast and transmission were roughly concluded, the Queen Mother of the West and the Supreme Primordial Lady departed, leaving only Lord Wang behind. Thereupon, the lord took leave of his two younger brothers and accompanied Lord Wang to the Jade Cavern Estate of Red City. Along the way, the administrators of mountains and rivers who came forth to welcome and guide them numbered in the thousands. As they prepared to depart, he addressed his two brothers: “Now that I go, I shall have fixed duties and cannot visit often—no longer will we meet day and night. Yet I shall return to this mountain once a year. On the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month, my master and the Supreme Void Red Perfected of the Southern Peak will visit you here. Take note of those who are devoted to the Dao; await me on these days, and I shall attend to them, offering instruction to those yet unenlightened.”\n\nThus, the two lords remained to govern the mountain. Within the cavern, they established offices; without, they built structures. They expounded the Dao to all things, nourishing the multitude with its flow. Their virtue extended to birds and beasts, each attaining its nature. Divine portents revealed fortune and misfortune; transgressions were made manifest. With inner teachings harmonized and outer doctrines made level, wind and rain came in season, the five grains ripened, pestilence did not arise, and violence did not spread. The land knew no disasters; the villages knew no bandits. The elders of the time sang:\n\n*Maoshan joins Jinling,\nThe rivers and lakes lie below.\nThree divinities ride white cranes,\nEach governing a mountain’s brow.\nThey summon rain to drench parched rice,\nAnd dry fields too grow soft and nice.\nWives and children dwell secure,\nA hundred cares I need not endure.\nWhite cranes soar in azure skies—\nWhen will they return to grace our eyes?*\n\nWhen the three lords departed, each rode a white crane to alight upon one of the mountain’s three peaks. Many witnessed this, inspiring the song. Thereafter, the peaks of Juqu Mountain were divided into the mountains of the Great Lord Mao, the Middle Lord Mao, and the Lesser Lord Mao. Taken as a whole, they remained a single mountain—Juqu—without other names.\n\nThough the elders outwardly received the divine protection of the Mao Lords’ perfected spirits, they had never beheld their gracious presence in person. The Mao Lords, dwelling in leisure within their cavern palace, nurtured their spirits and preserved their truth. Disdaining the clamor of worldly exchanges, they distanced themselves from the vulgar to maintain stillness. Thus, they no longer met with the common folk, save for those of exceptional destiny and devotion to the Dao, whom they occasionally summoned to see.\n\nYet in nourishing the myriad things and extending virtue to the multitudes, they worked unseen. The people, sensing the overflow of their numinous power—equal to that of heaven and earth’s great spirits—perceived the effortless manifestation of the sacred Dao, moved by the people’s devotion. Thus, they came in throngs, supporting the old and carrying the young, bearing provisions and libations. Together, they raised altars and laid foundations, erecting temples and halls upon the mountain. Craftsmen exhausted their skill to construct towering edifices. They painted the likenesses of the three lords in vermilion and azure, inscribing their divine virtues with eloquent brushstrokes. They planted a hundred fruits; bamboo and parasol trees grew into forests. They channeled the clear currents of Piling’s source. Tigers and leopards warded off calamity; great beasts guarded the passes. White swans and dark crows soared to the heavens. The brave were awed by their might; the benevolent cherished their culture. Farmers revered their boundless grace; all things sought refuge in their divine trust. The dying were restored to life; seekers of the Dao yearned for their guidance.\n\nEmperor Ming of the Han, in the second year of the *Yongping* era, decreed that counties and commanderies repair the temples of sacred mountains, great marshes, and sites capable of summoning clouds and rain for the people’s benefit—such as the temple of Laozi in Chen, the temple of Yu the Great in Kuaiji, the temple of the Mao Perfected in Juqu of Danyang, the temple of the Two Consorts of the Xiang River and Qu Yuan in Changsha, and others of their kind. All had bequeathed virtue to the people and crafted the Dao for the myriad things. Some marked the lofty path of the Holy Mother; others modeled the divine traces of sages and worthies. Thus, images were cast in bronze to commemorate them; temples were built to invoke their spirits. All were to be maintained and protected, their guardians charged with their upkeep.\n\nThe villagers commonly called this temple the White Crane Temple, unaware that the Director of Destinies had long since departed eastward for Red City. In the past, those who entered the temple with sincere devotion to the Dao and prayed for guidance sometimes heard the two lords conversing within the curtains or saw white cranes perched there. These white cranes were transformations wrought by the elixir of ninefold cyclical refinement, enabling them to divide their forms. They could become dozens of white cranes or be ridden in flight, while their original forms remained where they had alighted.\n\nThe two lords delighted in music. Whenever devotees entered the temple with earnest intent, the lords would summon celestial courtesans from the Palace of Square Vessels and the Western City. As the courtesans descended, music sounded from the empty sky, drawing nearer. Upon arrival, their pipes, strings, and songs produced melodies beyond mortal hearing—pure, resonant, and indescribably profound. At day’s end, the courtesans were sent away. Their departure was marked by a chorus of music that gradually faded into the distance, until at last it could no longer be heard.",

With utmost sincerity, the Dao is attained; in stillness, the true is perfected.'\"",

Yet their true essence remains fixed in form, dwelling in leisure upon the Terrace of Repose, their radiant virtue concealed and their luminous power hidden within the Registers of Stability.\n\nThe Lord remarked: \"Mount Gouqu is but a detached palace of the Director of Destinies. We are not the rightful masters of the Terrace of Repose. The Eastern Minister, the Director of Destinies, oversees the multitude of perfected beings on Mount Tai, governing the myriad spirits of the Wu and Yue regions. Truly, he may be called one whose Dao runs deep and whose virtue stands lofty, whose authority subdues even the earliest of spirits.\"\n\nJia Xuandao, Li Shusheng, Yan Chengsheng, and Fu Daoliu all received the essential teachings of the Lord Director of Destinies. Xuandao, a native of Hedong, was born in the final years of King Weilie of Zhou. Shusheng, from Zhuo Commandery, was born during the reign of Emperor Yuan of Han. Daoliu, from Beidi, served as a palace general under Emperor Ling of Han. Chengsheng, a man of Wu, was the commandant of Wudang Commandery during the reign of Emperor Gengshi of Later Han. Through diligent study, all attained the true Dao and later entered the Friend-of-the-Young Cave on Mount Xiaobaiyang in Tai, known as the Earthly Perfected.\n\nLi Yi, styled Zhongfu, was a native of Jingzhao. He and the Lord Director of Destinies both studied under the Western City Lord Wang. Zhongfu was an inner-chamber disciple, while the Director of Destinies was a northern-window disciple. However, Zhongfu’s received teachings differed: he constantly ingested *shuiyu* (water jade) and achieved efficacy, enabling him to pace the Dipper and conceal his form. By day and night, he practiced the methods of the Three Principles and Six Regulations, and performed the Seven Transformations of the White Tiger. After over a hundred years, he grew ever more youthful and vigorous. Together with the Lord Director of Destinies, he received a dose of the cyclically refined elixir, consumed it, and returned home. Zhongfu could recognize acquaintances from five hundred *li* away. He often made his living by setting nets. One morning, as he spread his nets, he caught a great crow. Upon inspection, it was Zhongfu himself. After speaking, they parted, and on that very day, he returned home, having lived among the people for two hundred and fifty years. During the reign of Emperor Ling of Han, he entered the Western Marchmount and was received with the same ceremonial honors as when the Lord Director of Destinies first departed.

      "translated_text": "The *Comprehensive Record of Divine Realms*, compiled by Liu Dabin, Successor Master of the Supreme Clarity lineage, states:\n\nThe *Inner Transmission of the Perfected of Great Primordiality* of Mount Juru records: East of the Yangtze, near Jinling, there lies a small marsh. To its east rises Mount Juru. This mountain’s cavernous interior harbors a numinous precinct, its grotto-heavens opening on all four sides, its caves and peaks stretching endlessly. Ancient texts call it the \"Vacuous Terrace of the Golden Altar,\" the \"Convenient Postern of the Heavenly Empress,\" the \"Eastern Window of Clarity and Emptiness,\" and the \"Secluded Screen of the Forest Chamber.\" Its myriad caverns interconnect, forming hidden paths that lead to seven thoroughfares and nine springs, with routes extending in all directions—truly a divine grotto and immortal sanctuary.\n\nThe mountain’s shape resembles the character *ju* (句), hence its name, Juru. It lies concealed among six small marshes, the present-day Chishan Lake, which faces the mountain directly as one arrives from the Yangtze. It is also called Mount Juru. Its winding sources cradle hidden depths, thus the surrounding settlement is named Jurongli. In the Zhou dynasty, its marshy springs were called the \"Caverns of Winding Waters\"; in the Qin, they were named the \"Altar of Jujin,\" after the hundred-zhang Golden Altar within its grotto-heaven, from which it derived its name. Nearby stands Mount Jijin, likewise named for its accumulated golden altars.\n\nDuring the Han, the Three Mao Lords came to govern this mountain. Local elders then renamed it the \"Mountain of the Mao Lords.\" The Three Lords departed riding white cranes, each alighting upon one of the mountain’s three peaks. Witnesses at the time gave rise to folk songs, and the crane-alighting sites were later distinguished as the mountains of the Great, Middle, and Lesser Mao Lords. Yet in their entirety, they remain but a single mountain, Mount Juru.\n\nThe *Record of the Recluse* states: Mount Juru’s ridges demarcate its boundaries—west and north belonging to Jurong, east and south to Yanling. The mountain lies one hundred fifty to sixty *li* by foot from the Yangtze at Stone Citadel. Jurong and Yanling were both under Runzhou during the Tang; in the Song, Jurong was assigned to Jiangning Prefecture before being abolished during the Xining reign. The eastern and southern portions of Yanling now belong to Jintan County in Qianjiang.\n\nThe *Inner Transmission of Great Primordiality* in the *Grotto-Heavens of Flourishing Yang* records: Within the great heavens lie thirty-six earthly grotto-heavens, of which the eighth is the cavern of Mount Juru. Spanning one hundred fifty *li* in circumference, it is called the \"Grotto-Heaven of the Golden Altar of Flourishing Yang.\" Its four walls are hollow, their upper and lower reaches entirely of stone. The level ground lies beneath the earth, emerging only after thirteen or fourteen *li*. It measures forty-five *li* east to west and thirty-five *li* north to south, perfectly square and flat. Its hollow interior extends one hundred seventy *zhang*, its lower reaches still bearing hills and mounds, while its upper vault is perfectly level.\n\nWithin, the \"Yin Radiance\" and \"Root of Solar Essence\" illuminate the void, their brilliance rivaling sun and moon. The Yin Radiance governs night, the Solar Essence day; both are round like sun and moon, floating in the boundless dark. The grotto-palace of Juru has five gates, each approached by winding stone steps within the void, serving as thoroughfares for immortals and adepts. The light of sun and moon differs not from the world outside, nor do its grasses, trees, waters, or marshes. Birds soar through the air, winds and clouds gather thickly—yet none can fathom its mysteries.\n\nSuch is the divine grotto-palace, its numinous wonders beyond measure, beyond conjecture, beyond deception. The grotto-heaven of Juru connects eastward to the Forest Chamber, northward to Mount Tai, westward to Mount Emei, and southward to Mount Luofu. Its lesser paths and intersecting trails are too numerous to count.\n\nDuring the Jianyuan era of the Han, Zuo Yuanfang, having attained the Dao, heard of this sacred mountain and came to dwell upon it, devoting himself to reverent practice. After five years, he found its gate and entered the hollow grotto, reaching the Yin Palace. The Three Lords bestowed upon him three kinds of divine mushrooms. Yuanfang wandered the grotto-palace for a year, marveling at its chambers and halls, their structures square and round, meticulously ordered, and fully furnished. He sighed: \"I never imagined the world held such marvels—where spirits come and go, adjudicating life and death as if it were an earthly court!\"\n\nJinling is the \"Earthly Lung\" among the blessed lands. According to the *Record of Grotto-Heavens and Blessed Lands*, there are seventy-two blessed lands, of which the Earthly Lung ranks first—this is the land of Jinling. As the *Inner Transmission* notes, its earth floats upon water, hence the comparison to a lung. The *Inner Chapters of Embracing Simplicity* mentions another \"Earthly Lung Mountain,\" Jade Flow Isle, while Mount Shang is also called the Earthly Lung. Here, we follow the *Inner Transmission* as authoritative.\n\nThe Lord of Life-Preservation received the teaching that Jinling is the fertile marrow of the hollow grotto, the Earthly Lung of Juru. Countless tread its soil, yet none comprehend it. It is also said of Jinling: \"Neither war nor flood may assail it; no calamity or plague shall befall it.\"\n\nThe forty-fourth scroll of the *River Chart’s Essential Primordiality* states: \"Within the Altar of Jujin lies a mound. The sick do not go there; floodwaters do not rise there—truly a blessed land.\" The *Inner Transmission of Great Primordiality* adds: \"Within Mount Juru lies the land of Jinling, spanning thirty-seven or thirty-eight *qing*. This is the Earthly Lung of Jinling. Its soil is rich, its well water sweet and fine; those who dwell here are destined for transcendence.\"\n\nThe *Essential Primordiality* also says: \"There is an Earthly Lung, where soil is fertile and water clear. The mountains of Juru and the mounds of the Golden Altar enable transcendence and ascension.\" The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that Jinling’s earth resembles that of Beiyu and the Northern Valley Pass—firm and solid, ideal for growing grains. Digging a well there yields water akin to that outside Feng Gate in Chang’an, its pure source a distant subterranean spring. The water is white, and even those who do not cultivate the Dao will live long lives if they dwell upon this land and drink its waters.\n\nThe *Inner Transmission* further states: To the left of Jinling’s ridges lies the Valley of Decision, while to the left of its marshy springs rises a mountain, with fertile sources to its right, called Willow Valley. To the west of the ridges lies the Source of Relief, called Yang Valley.",

The very name \"Gang\" derives from the essence of Jinling itself. Yet over a hundred generations and countless changes, its original name has been lost—how lamentable!\n\nThe Perfected Right Assistant Wang received the teaching that beyond the Golden Court of Tongwu and the Golden Mound of Wujuru lies a blessed realm for nurturing the true and a numinous dwelling for attaining transcendence:\n\n*\"Five times the waters of Yao would pour eastward into the sea,\nAll men would sicken and die beneath the weapons of Wu’an.\nWhat use are spears when I bear them not?\nNear the secluded gates of the Terrace of Immortals, I wander at ease.\"*\n\nThe Great Mount Mao lies south of Yuanfu Abbey, its solitary peak the gathering place of the Lord of Destiny, the White Crane. The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that atop Great Mount Mao rests a bronze tripod from the era of the Dark Emperor, large enough to hold four or five *hu* of grain. Its casting is exquisitely refined, buried eight *chi* deep in the earth at the mountain’s highest point, sealed beneath a slab of stone. The Dark Emperor commanded the Spirit of the Eastern Sea to conceal it there.\n\nIt is further said that the Dark Emperor was Gaoyang, son of Changyi, who was in turn the son of the Yellow Emperor’s son, Xuanxiao. Born to a woman of Mount Shu, Gaoyang was titled Zhuanxu. His father dwelled in the land of Ruo Waters, while Zhuanxu himself molded the banks of the Seven Rivers—thus was he called the Dark Emperor.\n\nAt the mountain’s summit, divine radiance often appears, known as the Cinnabar Light or the Heavenly Lamp. In ancient times, there stood a stone altar and stone chamber; today, halls and pavilions have been erected, where the ancient stone statues of the Three Mao Lords are venerated. Each year on the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month, the Lord of Destiny holds his wandering assembly, and people from all directions come to the mountain to pay homage. Grand *Lingbao* purification rites are conducted, a tradition unbroken from antiquity to the present.\n\nCentral Mount Mao lies north of Mount Jijin, its solitary ridge towering above all. The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that atop the Dark Ridge of Central Mao, the Lord of Destiny buried cinnabar from the Jade Gate of the Western Hu, buried two *zhang* deep and sealed on all four sides by slabs of stone.

      "translated_text": "The villages where the people of the Three Yangs are said to attain longevity are known as Zhuyang, Taiyang, and Beiyang.\n\nLesser Mount Mao lies north of Central Mount Mao. The *Inner Transmission of the Great Prime* states: In the third year of the Dihuang era of Wang Mang’s reign, on the *wushen* day of the seventh month, an emissary named Zhang Yong was dispatched to present five bronze bells, yellow gold, and white jade to the Three Immortal Lords of Juqu. In the seventh year of Emperor Guangwu’s Jianwu era, on the *dingsi* day of the third month, an emissary named Wu Lun offered yellow gold and jade silks to the Three Immortal Lords.\n\nMount Jijin stands to the north of Yuanfu Palace. The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that behind Greater Mount Mao and before Central Mount Mao stretches a long ridge, where a continuous outcrop of stone was known in ancient times as Mount Jijin. The location is well-suited for human habitation; one may seek out watered places to build quiet dwellings, which are most excellent. Here, one may compound the elixir to cultivate the Supreme Dao. The hermit said: \"This is indeed a hermitage.\" The present dwelling site has to its east a transverse ridge of pure stone, its forms most strange and perforated with many cavities. To the southwest rises a great stone cliff, split open to reveal a cavern within. Entering several *zhang*, the passage narrows until it no longer admits a person, yet a rushing wind issues forth.\n\nMount Jinjun is a small, solitary hill in the eastern hollow of Mount Jijin. The Lord of Fixed Records called it a branch of the Juqu range, known as Junshan. This mountain is most excellent. The hermit said: \"People today no longer know of Junshan. Its shape resembles a mushroom standing alone—or perhaps it is the character *kun* (困), shaped like a granary.\" According to the records, behind Greater Mount Mao’s long ridge and east of Mount Jijin, in a hollow, stands a solitary hill like a *boshan* censer, close to Mount Jijin—this is surely it.\n\nMount Hualao lies south of Chongxi Palace. In ancient times, the female immortal Sun Hanhua cultivated the Dao here, and a temple once stood but has long since fallen into ruin. This mountain often emits luminous phenomena at night, which some attribute to the *qi* of cinnabar mushrooms or numinous essences; local residents frequently observe it.\n\nMount Dinggong stands to the north of Chongxi Palace. Tradition holds that at the beginning of the Han, Ding Lingwei ascended to immortality here. How could one from distant Liaodong come to this mountain? Perhaps, having attained the Dao, he could manifest himself anywhere at will. Mount Ding lies east of Gongchen Valley.\n\nTiger Claw Mountain stands west of Mount Ding.\n\nMount Leiping rises above Leiping Pond, as the Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching. The residence now built by Director Xu faces east toward a small hill named Mount Leiping. In the Zhou era, the Lei clan came here to raise dragons.\n\nMount Yugang lies northeast of Lesser Mount Mao, also called Great Transverse Mountain. Its forests are dense and lush, appearing darkly luxuriant from afar, hence its name. The Lord of Fixed Records received the teaching that east of Mount Leiping, common folk call it Great Transverse Mountain, though its true name is Mount Yugang. This is the \"Gangshan\" mentioned in the *Record of Famous Mountains*. In ancient times, Li Ming compounded the divine elixir here and ascended to the mysterious. By the waterside, the site remains, known in antiquity as the Elixir-Refining Cloister.\n\nMount Fangyu, as the *True Instructions* states, lies northeast of Mount Leiping and southeast of Mount Liangchang, where three small hills stand in proximity like the beaks of swallows, named Mount Fangyu. Ancient adepts once compounded the Nine-Cauldron Elixir here. The Recluse delighted in dwelling here during his lifetime and often roams this place still. The *Hermit’s Record* says: \"The aforementioned Li Ming compounded the elixir here.\" The Recluse was Xu Yuan after his passing; unwilling to reveal his name, he styled himself the Recluse.\n\nMount Sangong lies southeast of Yan’kou Cave.\n\nGreen Mountain stands east of Mount Yugang; the hill to its west is named West Green Mountain.\n\nMount Magu lies west of Mount Yugang.\n\nMount Xianzhu lies south of Mount Leiping. The *Jade Cabinet Record* states that it is commonly called Solitary Woman Mountain.\n\nMount Dugong lies north of Lesser Mount Mao.\n\nLesser Bamboo Mountain lies east of Lesser Mount Mao.\n\nMount Liangchang: The *Inner Transmission of the Great Prime* states that at the northern extremity of Mount Mao, at the mouth of a cave, stands a mountain named Mount Liangchang, also connected to Juqu—essentially the same name. In the thirty-seventh year of the First Emperor of Qin, on the *guichou* day of the tenth month, he set out on his tour. In the eleventh month, he arrived at Yunmeng, where he sacrificed to Yu Shun at Mount Jiuyi. Floating down the Yangtze, he passed through Jiexi, crossed Meizhu, traversed Danyang, and reached Qiantang, where he approached the Zhe River. The waves being perilous, he turned west for one hundred and twenty *li*, crossing the strait to ascend Mount Kuaiji. There, he sacrificed to Yu the Great, gazed toward the Southern Sea, and erected a stone stele to extol the virtue of Qin at Mount Kuaiji. Li Si requested to inscribe it, and the emperor then visited the mountains and rivers. He ascended the northern extremity of Mount Juqu and buried a pair of white jades. There, he assembled his ministers, feasted his attendants, and sighed: \"The joy of imperial tours is unmatched by mountains and seas. From now on, let this be a constant practice.\" His ministers all raised toasts, hailing it as \"good and constant.\" Then, with great drums and bells resounding, ten thousand voices joined in song, startling the mountains and marshes. The rites of praise and augury being complete, all acclaimed the occasion. Thus, the northern extremity of Mount Juqu was renamed Mount Liangchang, its meaning derived from this event. It is also said that on the southwestern slope of Mount Liangchang lies a place fit for habitation, where the Lord of Destiny once had a separate residence—also suitable for elixir compounding. Further, to the southeast of Mount Liangchang is another habitable place, where piled stones resemble a censer. Occasionally, *hujisheng* trees grow there, their forms like curved canopies. This site is most excellent, though regrettably shallow. Still, it is sufficient. To the northwest of the cave mouth lies a slightly precarious spot, requiring an outer dwelling for stability.\n\nMount Taiwang lies northeast of Dingjiao Road and Liangchang, a small, pointed hill where paths run both above and below.\n\nThe First Emperor also halted here, surveying the hills and mounds.\n\nDragon Tail Mountain is a ridge extending from Greater Mount Mao to the eastern border of Jintan, resembling an external dragon.\n\nThree-Cornered Mountain lies north of Huagai Peak.",

Embracing Simplicity Peak is the northern ridge of Greater Mount Mao.\n\nLong Seclusion Ridge, also called Crouching Dragon Ridge, is described in *The Recluse*: \"The ridge lies on the southern bank of Master Guo’s Pool, a long and gently sloping mound that conceals serpents—hence its name.\" The ridge is entirely composed of fine gravel, unsuitable for dwelling. Only near its southeastern end, from Prefect Xu’s residence to the vicinity of Thunder Flat, are there habitable places. In Yixing, Jiang Fuchu and others established daily abodes at the ridge’s base, four or five *li* from Prefect Xu’s residence.\n\nWuzhi Mound lies in the Southern Grotto of Huayang. Peach Blossom Slope is north of Lesser Mount Mao, its forests and ravines secluded and profound. In spring, flowers and plants flourish in abundance, no different from the Wuling Source.\n\nArched-to-Heaven Valley, also called Arched-to-Heaven Stronghold, is northeast of Central Mount Mao. Master Liu’s encounter led to the construction of Yuanfu Palace, with an imperial decree assigning two hundred soldiers from Jiangning to patrol and sweep the area. A stronghold was thus established in the valley, as detailed in the *History of the Song*.\n\nHuangfu Valley lies on Three-Cornered Mountain. Seedling-Planting Valley is north of Three-Cornered Mountain.\n\nBlack Tiger Gully is west of the long ridge between Central and Lesser Mount Mao.\n\nThe Perfected One says: \"Heaven without name is called ‘void’; mountains without name are called ‘grottoes’; people without name are called ‘chambers.’ The hollow within a mountain is called a ‘grotto-court,’ and the hollow within a person’s head is called a ‘grotto-chamber.’ Thus do the Perfected dwell in heaven, in mountains, and in people—entering and exiting without obstruction. For just as the earth has mountains and grottoes, so too does the human body have facial cavities, through which the spirit and *qi* flow.\"\n\n*The Inner Transmission of the Great Primordial* states: \"The Grotto-Palace of Mount Gouqu has five gates: the southern two side gates, the eastern and western side gates, and the northern great side gate—together forming the five gates.\"\n\n*The Recluse* records: \"The great southern grotto of the mountain is the western side gate of the southern face. The eastern gate appears to lie within Wuzhi Mound. The Northern Eternal Grotto is the northern great side gate, while the eastern and western gates remain undiscovered.\"\n\nLord Dinglu received this teaching: \"The eastern side gate lies at the mouth of the small ridge east of Central Mount Mao, so the western side gate should also exist—now called the Stone Tomb site.\"\n\nThe Southern Grotto of Huayang is within Xiangzhi Mound at the foot of Greater Mount Mao. Pei Su, courtesy name Zhongming, prefect of Yuezhou during the Tang, crafted a pine-seed stone table for his audience with the Perfected.\n\nMao Grotto lies beneath the stone steps of Yuanyang Abbey—this is the western side gate of the southern face. Lord Dinglu received this teaching: \"Greater Mount Mao has a small cave in the south called the Southern Side Gate. By purifying oneself and fasting, directing one’s heart toward the Lord of Life, and regularly offering prayers on the second and fifteenth days to welcome and invoke the mountain, one may naturally behold me. If sincerity reaches such depth, how could the Dark Palace not be revealed? What manner of man was Zuo Ci?\"\n\nThe Huayang Grotto is the eastern side gate. Lord Dinglu received this teaching: \"East of Central Mount Mao is a small cave, barely large enough for a dog to pass—scarcely wide enough for a person to enter. Yet the deeper one goes, the more spacious it becomes. A flat stone seals the entrance, leaving only a small opening the size of a cup, guarded by the mountain spirits. This stone door occasionally opens—it is called the Hidden Gate of the Dark Palace. After purifying himself and fasting, Ziqin sought it out and entered here, finding it easier than the entrance to Eternal Grotto. Eternal Grotto has sandy paths, winding and treacherous where water flows, making passage difficult. Moreover, the road is long, not as convenient as the Small Ridge. Descending straight down from the entrance for three or four *li*, one reaches the Eastern Dark Gate of the Dark Palace. Unless one has already attained immortality, one cannot find the gate to enter.\"\n\nThe Western Grotto of Huayang lies at the eastern foot of Jijin Mountain—this is the \"wind-whistling grotto of Jijin Mountain\" mentioned in *The Recluse*. Successive dynasties deposited golden records and dragon tablets here—this is the western side gate.\n\nEternal Grotto is the northern great side gate of Huayang, governed by the Lord of Life-Preservation. Lord Dinglu received this teaching: \"At the northern edge of Eternal Grotto’s entrance, walking two hundred paces south along the mountain ridge, one finds a pair of white jade tablets buried by the First Emperor of Qin. A small flat stone on the ridge covers the burial site. Li Si inscribed the tablets with these words: ‘The sagely virtue of the First Emperor brings order to mountains and rivers. In his imperial tour of the azure streams, he engraved his inscription on pure jade.’ Wherever the First Emperor trod upon mountains and rivers, he honored them with jade tablets—not only at Gouqu.\"\n\nThe stone altar north of the grotto is where Master Xu burned incense, bowed in worship, and attained transcendence—this is the \"northern grotto’s end\" referred to in *True Reports*.\n\nLuo Gu Grotto lies west of Jinjun Mountain, named after Luo Yu, the female immortal of Mount Jiuyi. High Dwelling Grotto shares a stone boundary with Luo Gu Grotto.\n\nJade Pillar Grotto is south of the Western Grotto of Huayang, its interior filled with stalactites, leaving only narrow passages on all sides for human passage.\n\nHua Lao Grotto is on Hua Lao Mountain, named after Sun Hanhua.\n\nDengdu Grotto is at Purple Yang Abbey, as recorded in the section on Louguan.\n\nSmall Green Dragon Grotto lies above the Cinnabar Spring west of Lesser Mount Mao.\n\nHeaven’s Window Grotto is on Jijin Mountain.\n\nAzure Cliff Grotto is behind Chongshou Abbey. At its summit stands the Qinqi Pavilion, where ancient trees and perilous foundations remain.\n\nThe Female Immortal’s Grotto is thirty paces east of Azure Cliff Grotto. Its entrance, viewed from above, resembles a deep well. Tradition holds that the daughter of Master Ren attained the Dao and vanished here.\n\nWuzhi Grotto is south of the Golden Ox Cavern.

      "translated_text": "Master Liu Dabin, Successor of the Supreme Clarity Lineage, composed *The Boundaries of the Divine Realm*:\n\n**Waterways**\n\nThe Eastern and Western Streams of King Chu converge at the former site of Chongxi Abbey—these, along with the three waters of Huayang’s Western Grotto, merge and flow directly before Chongxi Abbey. In ancient times, King Wei of Chu once rested here, hence the name.\n\n*The Recluse’s Record* states: To the east of the Recluse’s present dwelling lies a transverse ridge. To the southwest stands a great stone cliff, within which is a grotto. A few paces outside, a spring gushes forth, its waters clear in both winter and summer—this is the source for the lower abbey’s needs. Near the outer grotto’s mouth, another spring surges upward, its flow swift, warm in winter and cool in summer, directly facing the small path ahead. Below, yet another cavernous spring wells forth, most extraordinary. Neither great floods nor severe droughts alter its volume; its waters are slightly white, sweet, and soft, flowing endlessly. The only regret is that it lies entirely on the mountain’s western side, unable to flow eastward. Note: The transverse ridge is Grotto Ridge, the lower abbey is Chongxi Abbey, and this waterway is the Stream of King Chu.\n\n**Crane Terrace Stream**—*The Recluse’s Record* states: Crossing Accumulated Gold Ridge to the southeast, a stone cavern appears, its waters flowing eastward most beautifully. The site is secluded and well-suited for compounding the elixir, directly before Mushroom Mountain and Peach Pond Stream.\n\n**Spring of Renewed Joy** lies east of Central Mao Peak. Master Ren once used its eastward-flowing waters to compound the elixir, directly before the ancient Grotto-Heaven’s Pass.\n\n**Nine-Bend Stream**—a tributary descending from the left flank of Great Mao Peak, emptying into Ten-Thousand Reeds Pool.\n\n**Great Stream** lies east of Golden Mushroom Mountain.\n\n**Flowing Goblet Bend** is west of Thunder Flat Mountain.\n\n**Jade Standard Stream** lies two *li* west of Great Mao Peak. Master Guo Sichao once cultivated *Kerria* there.\n\n**White Plum Creek** lies north of Lesser Mao Peak, where Lord Zhan planted white plums.\n\n**Azure Dragon Creek** is west of Constant Virtue Mountain, commonly called Tinkling Water Stream.\n\n**Guest-Welcoming Spring** lies north of Great Mao Peak, beside a square pond several *chi* deep. When guests arrive, the spring leaps and bubbles; if one approaches with noise or commotion, it stills and does not stir—another marvel. A hut here is tended by Sun Hanhua for incense offerings.\n\n**Beneficial Spring** lies on the eastern ridge of Great Mao Peak. *The Hidden Decisions on Ascending to Perfection* states: To the left and right of the Celestial Market Altar are springs, all golden and jade-like essences. Drinking them benefits one, hence the name.\n\n**Jade Butterfly Spring** lies on the western slope of Soughing Pinnacle. Two mouths hold the spring, one freezing and one warm in winter, also called the Yin-Yang Well.\n\n**White Jade Spring**\n**Numinous Spring** is atop Accumulated Gold Mountain.\n\n**Grotto Spring** is the pool beneath Immortal-Bridging Bridge.\n\n**Jade Sand Spring** lies west of Central Mao Peak. Lord Director of Destinies buried Western Hu jade-gate cinnabar on Central Mao’s Dark Ridge, and the spring’s waters, when drunk, benefit one.\n\n**Cinnabar Spring** lies west of Lesser Mao Peak.\n\n**Deer-Trod Spring** is to the left of Great Luo Source. Ancient adepts cultivated here, and a transcendent deer caused this spring to emerge.\n\n**Hundred-Fathom Spring** lies in Arching Dawn Valley.\n\n**Lock-and-Drink Spring** is on the southern slope of Great Mao Peak, its waters milky in hue.\n\n**Sea-Eye Springs**—two in number. One, according to old records, lies at Yang the Academician’s mountain lodge. Its waters surge in response to the tides, located between Accumulated Gold and Central Mao to the west; the present spring in Western Garden is it. The other lies west of Inkstone Pool.\n\n**Cinnabar Valley Spring** is east of Auspicious Cloud Grotto. Once, a Daoist drew its waters to compound the elixir, but a youth substituted other water. The Daoist detected this, and thus the name.\n\n**Lord Tian’s Spring**\n**Lord Tao’s Spring** is in Huangfu Valley.\n\n**Jade Fluid Springs**—two in number. One lies north of the Immortal’s Stone-Cradling Peak. Its waters are sweet and fragrant, faintly milky, curing all abdominal ailments. Today, its waters appear pure white, also called White Spring. The other lies at Jade Fluid Hut on Three-Cornered Mountain.\n\n**Hand-Clapping Spring**, also called Winter-Warm Spring, is below the Terrace Where Xiao Zhaoming Read. Upon hearing the sound of clapping, the spring surges like boiling water, its square pond always brimming.\n\n**Single-Scoop Spring** is on the cliff behind the Terrace Where Xiao Zhaoming Read.\n\n**Celestial Pool** lies atop Great Mao Peak, the abode of divine dragons, never drying even in great drought.\n\n**Dragon-Rearing Pool** is at Celestial Sage Abbey. During the *Dazhong Xiangfu* era, an imperial edict urged the retrieval of a dragon’s offspring, and an imperial ode was composed to send it back to the mountain.\n\n**Jade Pool** is before the Jade Emperor Hall at Celestial Sage Abbey.\n\n**Life-Release Pool** is east of Changning Town.\n\n**Inkstone Pool**, also called Sweetflag Pool. Fei Zhangfang of the Han studied the Dao here. When he inscribed talismans and rinsed his inkstone, the stream’s stones all turned black. Even today, using its waters to compound medicines yields extraordinary efficacy.\n\n**Jade Nectar Pool** is before Longevity Abbey.\n\n**Master Zhou’s Pool**—the pool of Zhou Ziliang, disciple of the Recluse, is at Numinous Treasure Cloister.\n\n**Thunder Flat Pool**\n**Guo’s Pond** lies several *li* east of Long-Hidden Mountain. The village is named Guo’s Pond after Master Guo Sichao’s external alchemy. Its waters remain perpetually full; when villagers drain it, thunder and lightning strike.

      "translated_text": "**The \"Investigation of Antiquity\" by Liu Dabin, Successive Master of Highest Clarity**\n\n**Heavenly Market Altar**, as recorded by Lord Ya Yan of the Register of Destiny: Beneath the stone of Heavenly Market Altar lies the very center of the Grotto-Heaven, above the Mystic Window. This stone originates from the Heavenly Market Mountain of Anxi, whence its name. During the reign of the Dark Emperor, the gods of the Four Seas were summoned to transport this massive stone to the summit of the Grotto-Heaven. Ancient records place it atop Accumulated Gold Mountain.\n\n*The Recluse* states: The location of the Heavenly Market Altar stone remains uncertain. Judging by the *Swift Wheel’s* proximity, it likely lies near Great Mao. Yet it seems improbable that the center of the Grotto-Heaven would be so close to the southern gate—perhaps it is near Central Mao. Even the village elders no longer know its whereabouts.\n\nAnother account: The **Immortal’s Market Altar**. In *True Reports*, Zhao Weibo, the Life-Preserving Minister, was skilled in whistling—his calls resembled a chorus of a hundred birds, or the wind rushing through forests, or the sound of drums. At times, he would ascend the Heavenly Market Altar, shake his beard toward the north, and whistle to summon the wind. Soon, clouds would gather above him, *qi* would stir the woods, and dark mists would descend, bringing gentle rain.\n\n**Swift Wheel’s Edge**, as recorded in *True Reports*: Once, the Green Lad of the Eastern Sea rode a flying chariot drawn by a single swift wheel, traversing the mountains of You Terrace. *The Recluse* notes: Today, on the ridge of Great Mao, a road runs eastward—its sides leveled as if by human labor, wide enough for carts. Tradition holds this to be the Swift Wheel’s Edge. The Perfected often ride nine dragons, the left named *Swift*, the right named *Reverent*. Having ascended the mountain’s summit, they are said to mount the left dragon.\n\n**Jiangba Road**, as recorded by Lord Ya Yan of the Register of Destiny: During the Qin, the Daoist Zhou Taibin and Jiang Shumao, the Marquis of Baling, came to dwell at the mountain’s foot. They planted the five fruits and the five pungent vegetables. Shumao was enfeoffed as marquis during the reign of King Xiao of Qin, hence the name of this place. *The Recluse* states: The main road from Little Mao leads to Yanling and is called Jiangba Road. However, during the reign of Duke Xiao of Qin, the state of Chu had not yet been annexed and divided into commanderies, and Baling County was first established in the early Jin. It is unclear how there could have been a marquisate of Baling—likely it refers to Ba of Shu.\n\n**Thunder Level Pond** lies before Thunder Level Mountain. *True Reports* records that during the Zhou, the Lei clan raised dragons here. Lord Wei Yan of the Register of Destiny states: The pond before the abode was constructed by Guo Sichao. Its embankments were raised to deepen the water, but over the ages, the walls have crumbled.\n\nSichao often rowed a small boat upon the pond, striking the sides as he sang:\n\n*I.*\nA clear pond girds the numinous peak,\nLong woods lush with verdant green.\nDark birds hide in secluded wilds,\nWords of ease flow unconstrained.\nRowing oars upon the spirit waves,\nI bow, yearning for the morning breeze.\nYet the hour of liberation eludes,\nAnd I wander amid the forest of blades.\n\n*II.*\nBeyond the Nine Abysses, the Wave Spirit,\nI refine the Dao to attain golden perfection.\nI sheathe these spirit-phoenix wings,\nConceal my radiant dragon scales.\nLifting high this inch of heart,\nTen thousand gusts are but dust and grime.\nPity the mayfly born at dawn—\nWho can exhaust your turning wheel?\n\n*III.*\nRoaming the void, the flying swift descends,\nA spirit’s step leaves no trace.\nThe round sun gleams with bright rosy clouds,\nNine phoenixes sing at dawn.\nBeating wings, they fan the River of Heaven,\nEvening mists and auspicious clouds soar.\nAt last I reach the Palace of Grand Tenuity,\nEmbracing this golden pear nectar.\nWandering beyond the dark abyss,\nNeither existing nor ceasing to be.\n\n*IV.*\nRiding the swift, I pity the divine clouds,\nDonning rosy hues beneath nine suns.\nThe High Emperor’s dragon chariot aligns,\nAt last I reach the Northern Flower Chamber.\nSpirit tigers dwell in the agate grove,\nWind and clouds merge as one.\nOpening and closing the gates of dark mystery,\nThe numinous transformations vanish without trace.\n\nThe villagers below the mountain still call it a level marsh.",

      "translated_text": "The \"Guo Gan of the Earth\" remains a surname from the Four Dynasties still spoken of among the people. Regarding Red Stone Pond, in a letter dated the first day of the third month from Lord Dinglu to Prefect Xu, it is written: \"Now we must reclaim the fields at Red Stone to serve as a path for comings and goings, yet the task was never completed.\" Prefect Xu replied: \"Long ago, we surveyed the Red Stone fields, finding them advantageous near the mountain’s base for travel, a matter of sincere devotion. But then came drought, the tenants reaped no harvest, and the pond’s collapse required immediate labor—this was a matter of strength unfulfilled, not of waning resolve. Now, dwelling at the mountain’s foot, we ought to restore the fields, though their distance from the cave’s entrance makes us reluctant to settle there.\"\n\n*The Recluse* states: \"These fields lie west of Great Mao and Central Mao, close to the great mountain, offering an excellent vantage for reverence and worship. Yet when it speaks of their distance from the cave’s entrance, it must refer to the northern cave’s entrance. Though the fields are fed by mountain streams, water dwindles in drought. The pond is also difficult to establish—who knows if they will ever reclaim them? The embankment still lacks repairs; with several hundred laborers, it could irrigate ten or so *qing* of land. The disciples at the Recluse’s lodge also sow crops here with the flowing water, ever wishing to restore this pond to benefit both near and far, and to bestow kindness upon the common folk.\"\n\nTian Gong Spring, also called Liu Fen Spring or Liu Valley Spring, lies one *li* southeast of Thunder Flat Pond. Lord Dinglu, mute of speech, said that on Huayang’s Thunder Flat Mountain there is a Tian Gong Spring whose waters expel the three worms from the abdomen, matching the flavor of the Recluse’s Spring. It is said to be a flow of jade sand, and when used to launder clothes, no ash is needed—this sets it apart. Long ago, a man named Tian Shu lived on Thunder Flat Mountain; after attaining the Dao, the spring was named in his honor.\n\nThe Cinnabar Well of Lord Mao lies within the Lower Resting Palace. The well of Perfected Li, where Perfected Li Ming of the Dark Continent refined cinnabar, is located east of the Yugang Square Grotto. The well of Prefect Xu is at Jade Dawn Abbey. *The Recluse* records: \"In the seventh year of the Great Brightness era, an elder from Xu Village named Xu Ou said his ancestors had served Prefect Xu, passing down that this residence once stood where the present-day thicket lies. The former site of the scholar’s hall should be where the wutong trees now grow, and the old well still existed at the time, though overgrown with weeds. Clearing the brush, they found it—a brick well nearly filled with earth. They dug it out, reinforced its walls, and now it yields fine water, slightly white in hue, said to resemble the taste of the water outside Phoenix Gate in Chang’an. Two mouths share one source; in winter, one is cold, the other warm—hence its name, the Yin-Yang Well.\"\n\nThe well of Ge Hong lies at Embracing Simplicity Mountain Hut in Zhichuan. Xu Huangmin of Danyang in Jurong, a grandson of Prefect Xu, married the granddaughter of Zhichuan and lived on this mountain, as handed down through generations. The cinnabar well of Perfected Tao is located east of the stone bridge before the Upper Lodge of Huayang. Its water is sweet and clear, never failing even in drought. At the beginning of the Zhenghe era, the Daoist Zhuang Shenzi sought and restored it. After removing three *chi* of earth, they uncovered a stone well with a broken railing, which they reassembled, leaving it mostly intact. Carved around it in large characters were the words: \"The Master, Tao Shiqí, Gentleman in Attendance of the Southern Qi court, came to this mountain in the *renshen* year. Dwelling in lofty seclusion, he styled himself *The Recluse*. His disciples who accompanied him included Lu Jingyou of Wu Commandery, and others named Yang, Wang, Wu, Dai, Chen, and Xu.

      "translated_text": "In the eighth month and fifteenth day of the third year of the Tianjian era of the Liang dynasty, Chen Maoxuan of Qiantang inscribed and unearthed a brick bearing Sanskrit characters. After excavating several *zhang* deeper, they recovered a round inkstone, approximately nine *cun* in diameter, with eleven toes arranged around its edge. When washed, its vermilion hue remained vivid. They also found a bronze incense burner with a magpie-tail design, and amidst the sand and stones, a single grain of cinnabar, as large as a lotus seed, its radiance dazzling the eye. Eager to retrieve it, they reached for it, only for it to slip and fall into the well.\n\nThe burner and inkstone were stored at Huayang, but were lost during the ravages of war. Another well lies beside the pond of Master Zhou at Lingbao Abbey—this too was the Recluse’s cinnabar well.\n\nThe *Zhen’gao* of Zhaozhen Terrace, annotated by Jian Shu in *Wings of the True Canon*, often speaks of \"returning the seal to Zhaotai.\" This refers to the Recluse’s lineage, which practiced the supreme methods of the Three Perfected Ones—Yang and Xu.\n\nThis was the chamber for storing scriptures. After prolonged pillaging in the mountains, the sacred texts and authentic traces have scattered without a trace. Though scholars may be earnest in their pursuit, how could they ever again behold the handiwork of the Perfected? One can only sigh in lament.\n\nYuchen Abbey and Lingbao Abbey occupy this site. The Azure Altar and the Plain Pagoda—according to the old altar stele of the abbey—stood with the Azure Altar to the east and the Plain Pagoda to the west. Today, the pagoda has fallen into ruin, and the altar is no longer as it once was. Both were built by the Recluse to symbolize the dual cultivation of the Two Teachings, and should be located at Yuchen Abbey.\n\nThe Well of Prince Zhaoming’s Blessed Village lies east of the Reading Terrace in the Southern Grotto.

Further examination reveals that the virtuous and retiring King Wu Taibo initially fled into the Zhong Mountains of Juqu. Thus, it is evident that this mountain has been a refuge for sages and worthies since antiquity.\n\nThe Recluse’s Secluded Lodge stands southwest of Mount Leiping. In the early Yuanyou era of the Song, the court eunuch Luo Chunyi studied the Dao in these mountains and once contemplated seclusion here. He possessed rare cinnabar and esoteric texts. One day, he opened a tomb to examine it and found only an empty coffin suspended by an iron chain, containing nothing but a sword and a bowl-mirror. The walls of the tomb were encircled by Sanskrit inscriptions in relief, forming a text that read: *\"The Secluded Lodge of Huayang, where the Bodhisattva of Supreme Strength offered his body, disciple of Śākyamuni Buddha, servant of the Supreme Dao Lord, cultivating the Six Perfections of the Mahāyāna. The Three Perfected Ones of □□, resting in the sacred peaks to guard the frontier, roaming the great void to lodge the spirit.\"* The calligraphy was divinely wondrous, surely inscribed by the recluse himself. After the tomb was opened, the Daoist disciples copied these talismanic characters to show the world. Later, Chunyi also attained the Dao of corpse-liberation. This account was transmitted in the sixth year of Yuanyou by Lin Xizi of Changle.\n\nThe Recluse’s Alchemical Furnace lies beside the Upper Lodge of Huayang.

To his left, he is girded by the Divine Tiger; to his right, he bears the Golden Perfected. His dragon crown and phoenix skirt are draped with a feathered cloak of brocade. His attendants—Heavenly Perfected, Jade Lads, and Jade Maidens—number thirty thousand each. The term \"Most High\" signifies one who scrutinizes the roots of the Dao and penetrates its origins, hence the Lord of the Highest Clarity is the teacher of Lord Lao and the sovereign of the myriad Dao. There is a transmission record titled *The Eight Simplicities of the Upper Scripture*, also known as *The Hidden Writ of the Most High: The Golden Perfection and Jade Radiance of the Seven Origins and Eight Effulgences Flying Scripture*. The *Scripture of the Yellow Court* refers to the Jade Dawn Lord of the Great Dao as the Most High, the true honor of the Most High.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Purple Palace Heavenly Emperor of the Great Dao of the Supreme Subtlety**\nThe Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Subtlety is the sovereign of the thirty-six Heavenly Emperors, governing within the Purple Palace of the Supreme Subtlety. He is addressed by the Golden Pavilion Emperor Lord with the sixteen characters of the Five Emperors of the Sun’s Center: Solar Essence, Pearl Radiance, Illuminating Veil, Green Summons, Returning Radiance, Crimson Youth, Mystic Flame, and Terrace Image. These are the methods of ingesting flying roots, also called *The Scripture of Cinnabar, Golden Essence, Stone Radiance, Water Mother, and Jade Embryo*. The Emperor bestows these upon the Perfected.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Posterior Sagely Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Golden Pavilion Imperial Palace**\nThe Mysterious Primordial Lord of the Upper Dao is of the lineage of the Earthly August. He resides in the Palace of Jasper Terraces, attended by thirty thousand maidens and officials. Ascending to the Highest Clarity, roaming the Great Ultimate, and governing the Ten Heavens below, he rides the Flying Chariot of the Three Simplicities. In secret, he inspects the Dark and Absolute, the Terrace of Luminous Solitude, the various heavens, rivers, and seas, soaring to the Lesser Existence. He halts his carriage at Tortoise Mountain to examine and test the multitude of immortals, conferring ranks according to their talents. Every five years, he descends for a tour; every ten thousand years, he pays homage to the Highest Clarity. There is a transmission record titled *The Purple Writ of the Numinous Book*, also known as *The Precious Scripture of the Five Elders*—today’s *Arrayed Records of the Three Heavens*.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Jade Protector King of the Nine Subtleties of the Highest Clarity, the Grand Minister of Fate of the Golden Pavilion, the Highest Dawn Master, the Jade Radiance Azure Florescence Lad of the Eastern Sea, the Great Dao Lord**\nThe Azure Lad is also called the Azure Canopy Purple Lad and the Perfected within the Dipper. He governs within the Cinnabar Pavilion of the Yellow Chamber of the Eastern Sea’s Great Square Torch Palace on the Eastern Florescence Mountain. He rides the cloud chariot of streaming azure radiance, girded with a flying azure feathered cloak, attended by a thousand Perfected of the Mulberry Grove. He fed the *Scripture of the Three Origins and the True Unity* to Master Juanzi and the *Scripture of Demonic Dispersion* to the Red Perfected of the Great Void. During the Jin dynasty, he descended to the household of Lady Wei. On the eighteenth day of the third month and the second day of the twelfth month, he would arrive at Mount Gouqu together with the Minister of Fate of the Mao to examine and assess the learning of the Perfected. There is a transmission record titled *The Scripture of the Jade Protector’s Grotto Vision*, also called *The Upper Mystery of the Cloud Forest*.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Grand Minister of the Golden Pavilion, the Governor of the Western Limits, the Lord of the Western City, the Sovereign of the Myriad Perfected**\nThe Sovereign of the Myriad Perfected, surnamed Wang and named Yuan, styled Fangping, governed the Western City Mountain of Yizhou, the very seat of the Western Limits’ governance of the Myriad Perfected. He oversaw five thousand immortal officials at his abode and was the teacher of the Minister of Fate of the Mao. He once descended to the household of Cai Jing and met with Ma Gu. In the renwu year of the first Han’an era, he descended from Lord Lao to Mount Heming, where he fed the Celestial Master Zhang Daoling a thousand scrolls of scriptures and talismans. He then descended to Mount Yangluo and fed the *Upper Scripture of the Pure Void* in thirty-three scrolls to the Pure Void Perfected. During the Jin dynasty, he again descended to Mount Yangluo, where he fed the Dao to Lady Wei and bestowed the methods of the Three Perfected upon Yang and Xu. Each year on the second day, he would roam and inspect Huayang together with the Minister of Fate of the Mao, examining and assessing the male and female learners of the Perfected to determine who would become immortals. Chengdu, Guacang, and Kunlun all serve as the immortal seats of the Sovereign of the Myriad Perfected. Lord Wang governs the teachings of the Great Peace and the Twenty-Four Perfected, serving as the master of the Three Caverns.\n\n**The Sacred Master, the Heavenly King of Lesser Existence, the Pure Void Lord of the Great Simplicity**\nThe Pure Void Perfected, surnamed Wang and named Bao, styled Zideng, was a native of Xiangping in Fanyang. He was the seventh-generation descendant of the Marquis of An’guo, born on the twenty-seventh day of the ninth month in the third year of the Jianzhao era of Emperor Yuan of Han. His father was the Literary Marquis Mi, and his mother was the granddaughter of Sima Qian. The Perfected studied the Dao on Mount Huayin, where he was moved by the descent of the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, who fed him the upper methods. The Sovereign of the Myriad Perfected bestowed upon him *The Upper Scripture* in thirty-one scrolls, and he became a master of covenant transmission. Together, they journeyed to the Dark Continent, where he petitioned for his true name to be recorded. He then returned to the Western City and proceeded to the Three Origins Lord of the Great Simplicity, where he received the *Flying Dawn Divine Staff and Jade Seal of the Flowing Gold, the Seven Origins, and the Eight Effulgences*. The Most High sent gifts: a feathered canopy of dawn plumes, a pair of pearls of moon-bright plain feathers, a jasper shaft, a cinnabar cord, and a brocade banner. He also dispatched a decree of investiture. His rank was established as the Pure Void Perfected of the Great Simplicity, the Left Protector and Upper Duke of the Three Origins and Four Offices of the Heavenly King of Lesser Existence. He governed Mount Wangwu, attended by three hundred Jade Lads and Jade Maidens, and oversaw the precious scriptures. He rode a chariot drawn by tigers and dragons, with a golden canopy and a jasper wheel, the Flying Chariot of the Eight Effulgences, wielding the staff of nine hues. He entered and exited the Highest Clarity, served the Great Simplicity, and reposed in the Great Ultimate.",

      "translated_text": "The *Shangqing Scriptures* record that by this time, the sacred transmissions from the Seven Heavens had descended to the world seven times.\n\nThe first lineage-holder of the Shangqing tradition, the Grand Preceptor and Daoist Sovereign of the Shangqing, the Perfected of the Southern Culmen and Purple Authenticity, the Sagely Protector of the Supreme Microcosm and Jade Dawn, the Sagely Empress—who governed the Southern Marchmount’s Perfected of the Upper Realms and oversaw the life-destinies of the lofty and numinous, the Illuminator of the Purple Void and Primal Dao, the Perfected Sovereign of the Highest Origin—was surnamed Wei, named Huacun, styled Xian’an, a native of Rencheng. She was the daughter of Wei Shu, Minister of Works in the Jin dynasty, and was born in the third year of the Jiaping reign of King Jia of the Wei kingdom, the xinwei year. Gifted with extraordinary talent and a transcendent spirit, she stood apart from the common. From childhood, she studied the books of Laozi and Zhuangzi, ingested sesame and poria powders, and longed for seclusion. At twenty-four, her parents compelled her to marry Liu Youyan of Nanyang, bearing two sons, Pu and Xia. When Youyan served as magistrate of Xiwu County in Jijun, and their sons had grown to maturity, she withdrew to a separate chamber, resumed her original garb, and devoted herself to cultivation.\n\nIn the twelfth month of the ninth year of the Taikang reign, the wushen year, on the sixteenth day, at midnight, the Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Lord of the Azure Lads, the Perfected Wang Jinglin of Fusang and the Yang Valley, and the Perfected of the Pure Void descended, addressing the Perfected Sovereign: “We have heard that you have secretly woven the true qi. The Supreme Thearch has commanded us to transmit to you the Way of the divine perfected.” Thereupon, they presented thirty-one scrolls of the Most High’s treasured texts, including the *Hidden Writ of the Eight Simplicities*, the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, and the *Mysterious Wings of the Lofty Transcendents*, personally bestowing them upon the Perfected Sovereign with the words: “These scriptures were once entrusted to the Master of All Perfected in the Western City. Now we pass them to you.” They also instructed her in the oral secrets of visualization, meditation, and practice before departing. The Perfected Sovereign was then thirty-seven.\n\nLater, Youyan passed away. Her eldest son, Pu, rose to Minister of Works and Marshal of Qi; her younger son, Xia, served as Attendant to the Grand Commandant Tao and later as Administrator of Ancheng and Gentleman of the Palace. The Perfected Sovereign lived eighty-three years in the world. In the ninth year of the Xianhe reign, the jiawu year, the Lord of the Pure Void and Azure Lads descended again, bestowing two doses of divine elixir and commanding her to consume them at once, setting a date to meet at the Yangluo Palace. On the seventh day at midnight, the Great Unity dispatched a whirlwind chariot to welcome her. Employing the Way of Concealed Radiance, the Perfected Sovereign transformed her form and spirit, ascending to Mount Yangluo.\n\nThe following day, the Lord of the Azure Lads, the Four Perfected of the Great Ultimate, the Lord of the Pure Void, and forty-seven other perfected descended to instruct the Perfected Sovereign in the Cloud Terrace of the Hidden Grotto. Each perfected imparted their supreme teachings for three days before departing. The Perfected Sovereign studied and recited the jade scriptures for sixteen years, her countenance becoming like that of a maiden.\n\nThereafter, the Queen Mother of the West and the Perfected Sovereign of the Southern Culmen came to welcome her ascent. At dawn, she arrived at the Shangqing Palace. The Lord of the Great Dao of the Jade Dawn and Jade Clarity, the Heavenly Thearch of the Supreme Microcosm, and the Sagely Empress of the Golden Portal each sent envoys to confer investiture, bestowing upon her jade tablets and golden texts. Her rank was established as the Perfected Sovereign of the Purple Void, governing the Perfected of the Upper Realms and life-destinies of the Southern Marchmount, her position equivalent to that of a Transcendent Duke. She was charged with overseeing the teaching of aspiring transcendents at the Great Huo Mountain within the Terrace of Heavenly Platform. She also held banquets in the Palace of the Pure Void.\n\nSubsequently, the life-destiny spirits and transcendents of the Southern Marchmount requested to be placed under her authority. As her welcoming procession arrived, the various perfected accompanied the Perfected Sovereign to the Terrace of Heavenly Platform on Mount Huo in Tiantai. En route, they passed through Jinqu’s Golden Altar, where they were hosted by Mao Shushen for two days and nights before proceeding together to Mount Huo.\n\nLater, Pu rose to the position of Palace Attendant and was tasked with transmitting the teachings to Yang Jun, a Gentleman of the Palace in the household of the Prince of Langye, Minister of Works. In the third year of the Xingning reign, the yichou year, on the twenty-third day of the sixth month, the Perfected Sovereign descended with a host of perfected to the home of Yang Jun. From then on, she frequently descended to Jinqu, often accompanied by the Three Mao Lords of the Azure Lads and Pure Void. The transmission of the teachings beyond the single lineage of Huayang began here.\n\nDuring the Yuanyou reign of the Song dynasty, she was enfeoffed as the Perfected Sovereign of the Lofty and Numinous, Illuminator of the Purple Void and Primal Dao. In the Taiding reign of the Great Yuan, Yu Ji, Director of the National University, composed eulogies for the forty-five ancestral masters. Her eulogy reads:\n\nWe gaze upon the Purple Void,\nMajestic as the sacred peak of Zhurong.\nHer soaring rosy clouds form verses,\nHer flowing echoes shake the heavens.\nRadiant as the sun and moon,\nHer jade essence and golden visage.\nShe upholds the myriad heavens,\nInaugurating our lineage of transcendents.\n\nThe second lineage-holder of the Shangqing tradition, the Perfected Master of the Mysteries, the Perfected of the Shangqing, the Upper Protector of the Golden Portal, the Inspector of Transcendent Affairs and Life-Destinies, the Lord of the Eastern Florescence and Dao of the Cavernous Numinosity, the Perfected of Manifest Transformation and Supreme Virtue—surnamed Yang, named Xi, styled Xihe—was originally from Wu Commandery but later relocated to Jurong. He was born in the fifth year of the Xianhe reign, the gengyin year, in the ninth month. From childhood, he was spiritually attuned, possessed of a handsome appearance, eloquent and joyful, skilled in calligraphy and painting. His fame in these arts equaled that of Wang Xizhi throughout the land. Though his years differed greatly from those of Master Xu Mai (Changshi Mu), they early formed a bond of spiritual communion.",

      "translated_text": "When Emperor Jianwen held the title of Prince of Langye and later ascended to the position of Chancellor, he appointed Lord Yang as Attendant Clerk of the Chancellery upon the recommendation of the Chief Administrator. Yet upon the Emperor’s enthronement, Lord Yang sought no promotion. His uncle, Gao, renounced worldly honors, and Lord Yang devoted himself to profound meditation, thereby attaining spiritual resonance.\n\nIn the fifth year of the Yonghe reign, he received the *Tiger and Leopard Method* from the Master of the Central Yellow. The following year, at the age of twenty-one, he studied the *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* under Liu Pu, the eldest son of Lady Wei. In the third year of the Xingning reign, in the sixth month, the Primordial Lady of Purple Emptiness, the Lady of the Purple Tenuity, and the Perfected Consort of Ninefold Splendor descended to his home to expound the essential Dao. Thereafter, forty-seven Perfected Ones of the Clear Void and Numinous Purity descended in succession, some manifesting at Mount Changshi in response to his devotion. The scriptures and revelations he transmitted were often conveyed through spirit-writing to Master Xu and his sons. Thus, he became the master who transmitted the scriptures to Master Xu.\n\nThe Perfected Consort of Ninefold Peace, responding to the mandate of the age, became his celestial consort. She once declared to him: “Your luminous nature is serene and unadorned, your inner radiance as resplendent as jade, your virtue as profound as an orchid’s abyss, your pure resonance echoing through the golden palace—truly, you are a treasure concealed within, a hidden Perfected One whose brilliance shines inwardly. You shall become one of the Three Excellencies, attending the Emperor at dawn, a lofty assistant to the Four Counsellors, bearing the mandate of the Sagely Lord. You shall govern life and judge death, reward and punish spirits, command the myriad numina, seal mountains and summon clouds, discern the qi of yin and yang, and serve as the Lord of Life-Destinies over Wu and Yue. You shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight, riding dragons and driving clouds. If you cannot endure the smoke of wind and fire, and wish to preserve your true form in the secluded groves, might you not seek the Way of the Sword and Liberation, or the safeguards of a declared end?”\n\nLater, the Lord of the Western City further instructed him in the method of absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. Emperor Jianwen became his disciple. In the eleventh year of the Taiyuan reign, the bingxu year, Lord Yang shed his mortal form at the age of fifty-seven.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nSerene and unadorned in nature,\nHis spirit companioned with the profound and mysterious.",

His family had long been wealthy, walking in trust and practicing righteousness, revered by his village. Hearing of Yang and Xu of Mount Mao who had attained the Dao, and the widespread transmission of the Southern Perfected’s Highest Clarity scriptures and methods, he grew ever more devoted in admiration, for his dwelling lay near the Golden Court and Heavenly Terrace, a mere handspan from the immortal realms.\n\nIn the third year of Yuanxing, when Vice Minister Huang Min of Agriculture carried the scriptures to escape the chaos, Lord Ma personally welcomed him at the roadside, inviting him to stay in his home, where he honored and supported him with reverence. In the sixth year of Yuangjia, when Vice Minister Huang returned to Qiantang, he sealed a chest of his ancestral Perfected scriptures and left it in Lord Ma’s quiet chamber, saying, “These scriptures are all traces of the divine immortals. Only I may retrieve them. Even if there are written instructions, do not give them to anyone.” He took only a dozen or so scrolls with him. Upon reaching Qiantang, he fell ill and, fearing he might not recover, sent someone to fetch the scriptures. Lord Ma, having received the books, firmly upheld the original injunction, thinking, “How could I dare lightly hand them over, having personally received this teaching?” Thus, he did not return the scriptures, and Xu soon passed away.\n\nLord Ma and his younger brother Han revered the scriptural treasures even more than their own father. They always kept two servant boys—one named Whitehead, the other Flathead—to tend the incense and fire, sweep, and dust. Often, divine radiance and numinous qi manifested in their chambers. Lord Ma’s wife could also perceive them, saying, “There are often azure-clad maidens and jade women coming and going in the air, swift as flying birds.” Thereafter, the Ma family grew ever more prosperous, their wealth vast, and they enjoyed long lives across generations.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nHeaven does not begrudge the Dao,\nEarth does not begrudge its treasures.\nYet those who transcribe carelessly\ncannot preserve them.\nHanded down by the Perfected of Wei,\njade pendants and golden tablets—\nfew know them,\nthose who see them flourish.\n\n**Sixth-Generation Lineage Master:**\nThe Perfected Lord of Assisting the True of the Highest Clarity, personal name Han, styled Ziyan, was the younger cousin of Lord Preserving the True. Together with his elder brother, he revered and upheld the scriptural treasures. A layman named Lou Huiming, who had earlier resided in Ke, was deeply enamored of the scriptures and methods, but his karmic obstacles were severe, and he had no means to study them. In the first year of Jinghe, he went to the capital and, at the urging of the Perfected of Pure Brilliance, sought an audience with the Song sovereign to request the scriptures from the Ma family. By the time the scriptures reached the capital and were presented to Jinghe in the Hua Forest, they were briefly opened, and he urged that they be entrusted to the Daoist of the Rear Hall—Master Lu.\n\n*The Record of Numinous Verifications* states: For their merit in preserving the scriptures, upon their passing, the Celestial Thearch commanded divine officials to summon them with jade tablets into the Grotto-Heaven of Golden Court, where both were appointed as Perfected Lords.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nOf old, the Lords of Mao—\nelder ascended, younger followed.\nContinuing this noble path,\ntogether they preserved the numinous garden.\nWhere the jade scriptures reside,\nten thousand spirits guard and uphold.\nThe Dao flourishes in its time—\nit is not for men to claim as private.",

At that time, renowned scholars such as Shen [□], Lu Jingzhen, and Chen Baoshi all studied under him. His disciples numbered over a hundred.\n\nThe Master once dreamed that Lord Mao said: “The Lesser Lad of Azure Splendor will descend again upon Mount Juqu; among your disciples, one will be skilled in safeguarding him.” During the Yongming era, when Tao Hongjing entered the mountains, the Master, struck by his extraordinary bearing and transcendent spirit—and hearing that his body bore the pattern of the Dipper—recalled his dream and said: “The Lesser Lad of Azure Splendor—could this not be the Perfected One within the Dipper?” He then fully transmitted his teachings to him.

      "translated_text": "**Scroll Eleven: A Record of the Succeeding Patriarchs**\n\n**The Eleventh Patriarch:**\nThe Venerable Master of the Upper Records, Inspector of Immortals, Tang State Preceptor, Grand Master for Thorough Counsel, posthumously titled Master Tixuan, bore the surname Pan, the personal name Shizheng, and the courtesy name Zizhen. He hailed from Zongcheng in Bei Prefecture.\n\nHis father, Pan Zhen, served as Prefect of Tong Prefecture during the Sui, while his mother, née Lu, was skilled in eloquent discourse on renowned principles. She fed him the *Dao De Jing* from her own mouth. After her death, he built a hut by her grave and was renowned for his filial piety.\n\nDuring the Daye era, a Daoist named Liu Aidao saw him and marveled, saying: *\"A steed of three aspirations—who but you could ride it?\"* At the time, the Dharma Master Wang was held in high esteem by Emperor Yang, often entering the palace to personally offer pine resin and spring water for blessings. Aidao said: *\"I deeply wish for you to follow me, yet to accomplish the work of the Dao, none but the Dharma Master will suffice.\"* Thus, he became a disciple of the Dharma Master and returned with him to Mount Mao.\n\nOne day, the Dharma Master said to him: *\"Songyang is the place for your cultivation of the True—you must hasten there without doubt.\"* The Master then entered the valley between the twin springs of Zhong Ridge, dwelling there for over a decade before venturing deeper into Xiaoyao Valley, where he became utterly secluded from the world.\n\nIn the third year of the Shangyuan era, Emperor Gaozong visited the eastern capital and paid homage at Mount Song. He summoned the Master and requested talismanic writings, but the Master declined, claiming no knowledge of them. The Emperor then asked what he needed in the mountains. The Master replied: *\"Lush pines and pure springs are all I require—these are not lacking here.\"* The Emperor was struck with admiration.\n\nAt the beginning of the Tiaolu era, when the Emperor again performed sacrifices at Mount Song, he visited Xiaoyao Valley. There, he saw a rattan couch overgrown with creeping figs, nearly rotted away, with no utensils for fire or grain—only two gourds holding green-tinged congee. Moved, he ordered the immediate construction of Chongtang Abbey on the spot.\n\nThe following spring, he had the Master conveyed by palanquin to the western palace in Luoyang and urgently renamed Songyang Abbey as Fengtian Palace. Whenever the Emperor composed music, he would present the names of the Master’s disciples for consultation, and from then on, the imperial carriage frequently traversed the mountain passes. While in Luoyang, the Emperor summoned the Master again for an audience. When the Master requested to return, the Emperor composed a poem to see him off.\n\nThe Master once told his disciples: *\"Truly, I have no use for meeting emperors, for it disturbs the sacred mountains. If you study the Dao without wearying of its profound mysteries, you will be free of encumbrances.\"*\n\nOn the fourteenth day of the sixth month in the first year of the Yongchun era, he asked for a bath. Writing a green talisman, he placed it in the water, saying: *\"This will remain cold for a lifetime.\"* At the time, a stone chamber was being built beneath the northern cliff, nearly complete.\n\nOn the sixteenth day, he suddenly declared: *\"I depart, I depart.\"*",

      "translated_text": "A phoenix-like crow once descended upon his incense table, its talon marks forming the characters: *\"Perfected One of the Upper Records of the Eastern Flower.\"* Thereafter, his conduct grew ever more numinous. Emperor Xuanzong, struck by wonder, dispatched envoys to summon him, compelling him to reside in the Yang Terrace Abbey built upon Mount Wangwu. One day, moved by the Celestial Emperor’s call, he came to the mountain to pay homage at the Hua Yang Grotto-Heaven. There he composed the *Stele of Purity and Simplicity*, secretly inscribing upon it that Wangwu’s Lesser Existence Heaven was the central precinct of the Assembly of Perfected Ones: *\"Its vital qi is secluded and reverent, its spirits gather in splendor. If our Dao is to flourish, what could be impossible? Soaring and alighting at will, I resolve to make this my final abode.\"*\n\nLater, at the abbey’s northern ridge, where the heights reached their utmost and the boundaries grew most remote, he discovered the Central Rock Terrace—directly aligned with the Heavenly Altar above, encircled by long mounds below, embraced by colossal trees, with murmuring streams flowing through its midst. Here, for days uncounted, he nurtured dragons in the great valleys, kept cranes upon the central peaks, burned myriad incenses in the Golden Grotto, and inhaled the pure qi from the Stone Window. He composed the *Discourse on Sitting in Forgetfulness* and compiled the *Twelve Secret Essentials of Cultivating Perfection*, which became the companion text to the *Secrets of the Reclusive Perfected*. Yet fearing the emperor’s favor might endure too long, he relocated to Jade Cloud Peak on Mount Tiantai, there to await his ascension.\n\nThe court then compelled the construction of Tongwu Abbey, where the master inscribed the *Dao De Jing* in full with his five limbs. On the eighteenth day of the sixth month in the *yihai* year of the Kaiyuan era, he suddenly told his attendants: *\"I have received an appointment in the Mystic Capital and may no longer remain.\"* He then arranged his seals and fastenings as if preparing for a distant journey. By dusk, a crimson cloud swirled down to earth, bearing the clear strains of celestial pipes. All who witnessed this were awestruck, certain he would ascend. Rushing to his chamber, they found only his discarded form.\n\nEmperor Xuanzong’s imperial stele stands atop the Tongwu summit.\n\n**Eulogy:**\nUtterly numinous, merging with the Void,\nResponding to all things without bound.\nForcibly named *Sitting in Forgetfulness*—\nIt dissolves the dust of mortal form.\nLofty winds in the Flowery Grove,\nDawn’s light on the Cinnabar Terrace.\nNo teacher beyond Penglai’s seas—\nReturning, he sought Mount Tiantai.\n\n**Thirteenth Patriarch:**\nPerfected One of the Upper Records, Tang State Preceptor, Grand Master for Proper Consultation, Master of Mystic Serenity—his surname was Li, personal name Han’guang, a native of Jiangdu in Guangling.

      "translated_text": "At the beginning of the Shenlong era, the Master was ordained as a Daoist on account of his aspiration and conduct, residing at Longxing Abbey. In the seventeenth year of the Kaiyuan reign, he followed Master Sima to Mount Wangwu. At first sight, Sima declared, “A true guest of jade-like aspiration!” He dwelt in Songyang for over twenty years. When Sima Zhen traveled, Emperor Xuanzong summoned the Master to court for an audience. Sighing, the emperor said, “In seeing Han’guang, I know that Perfected One Sima yet remains in the world.” One day, the emperor inquired about the golden crucible. The Master replied, “The Dao and virtue are public; light ascent is but a private matter within the public. If one neglects the Dao and virtue to pursue life and indulge desires, it is like striking the wind.” Xuanzong was deeply moved and marveled at this. He issued an edict for the Master to reside at Yangtai Abbey. After more than a year, the Master claimed illness and begged to return to Mount Juqu to compile scriptures and methods. In the twelfth month of the fourth year of the Tianbao reign, the emperor dispatched an imperial envoy bearing a jade-sealed edict to summon him. Upon arrival, the Master was lodged within the palace precincts. Whenever the emperor wished to consult him, he would first purify himself through fasting and bathing. When the emperor requested transmission of the Daoist methods, the Master declined on account of illness, and the emperor did not press him further. He again sought to return to the mountains. Thereupon, the emperor specially bestowed the former residence of Yang and Xu—Ziyang Abbey—for his dwelling. The emperor composed a poem to see him off, and further prohibited hunting, fishing, and the gathering of plants within the mountain, while those who consumed meat or blood were barred from entry. At the time, many authentic scriptures and sacred traces had already scattered and been lost. The Master, in accordance with imperial decree, searched and collected them, presenting the recovered treasures to the throne. The emperor further ordered the mountain recluse Wang Ai to request the Master’s standard script for thirteen pages of the *Upper Scripture*, to supplement what was missing. On the eighteenth day of the third month in the seventh year, Xuanzong received the catalog of the Three Caverns’ scriptures in the Datong Hall, paying distant reverence to the Master as his preceptor. He bestowed upon him the title *Master of Mystic Serenity* and a set of ritual robes, fulfilling the rites of master and disciple. An edict was issued to carve a stele at Huayang Grotto Abbey to commemorate the event. The emperor twice summoned the Master to court, but each time he requested retirement and returned.

Thus, I have reached my limit.\"* He then took up his brush to write a farewell memorial, bathed and changed into fresh robes, and passed away peacefully.\n\nWhen the memorial was heard, the **Son of Heaven** sighed and mourned, bestowing the title of **Suffused Concealment** (*Chónghé*) **Mr.** upon him, and conferring rank upon his parents. The Master was buried in the **mountain of the Concealed Truth** (*Cángzhēn Guān*).\n\nHis disciples included **Yú Xīyǐn** and **Xú Xīhé**. **Xú Xīhé**, upon receiving the imperial decree, succeeded him in holding the **seal and sword**. **Yú Xīyǐn** entered **Qīngchéng Mountain**, and today in **Shǔ** there are those who speak of the **Cavern Method** (*Dòngfǎ*) ascending the **Way**, for it is the **public transformation** (*xínghuà*) of **Yú Mr.**\n\nThe Master had a fine beard and a tall, sturdy frame, with a robust and uncommonly graceful build.

Qiūlín was the wife of Wèi Xíngdào, the Han *Lóuchuán* General. The *Hétú* states: *\"Hàochǔ has many who have glimpsed the Great Peace.\"* He often told others: *\"These words are not false—this proof will soon manifest.\"* The luminous mirror he preserved was not of the ordinary world’s craft.

Méng recommended him, and he oversees examinations and registries.\n\nThe fourth deputy is Master Táng of Xīshān, a native of Fáng Shǔ. He served Lǐ Bābó. Táng oversees life and death.\n\nThe *Zhōu Shì Xuántōng Jì* records: Huáng Yuánpíng, of Dōnghǎi, was about thirty years old, dressed in white linen robes. Yuánpíng carried a black tablet, which he presented to Deputy Zhào of the Preservation of Life, though he held no official rank. Lǐ Zhěng of Héjiǔ once received the *Shǒuyī Fǎ*, practiced in a cavernous chamber, and attained the Dao. Initially at Yángluò Shān, he later entered Huáyáng, where he also oversaw examinations and rituals for the people. Zhěng had once served as a tutor for the Lord of Chángdào, receiving the Dao and entering the mountains at age sixty.

The recluse compiled his daily records of true transformations, categorizing them into four volumes, which he presented to Emperor Wǔ of the Liang—this became the *Zhōu Shì Xuántōng Jì*. The text records two officials appointed as deputies of the Preservation Bureau, a position newly established to assist in managing celestial registers.

At around twenty-two or three, she possessed a graceful appearance and a noble character, demonstrating great virtue—she was also destined to attain transformation alongside **Yì Qiān**.\n\n**Yì Qiān**’s left consort, **Wáng Fūren** (王夫人), adopted the courtesy name **Tàiyīng** (太英), was about twenty years old, and clad in crimson attire.\n\n**Yì Qiān**’s right consort, **Liú Fūren** (刘夫人), with the courtesy name **Xuánwēi** (玄微), was also around twenty, dressed in emerald-green robes.\n\n**Yì Qiān**’s *Dūshǐ* (都司学) **Táo Fūren** (陶夫人), renamed herself **Zhì’ān** (智安), was approximately forty years old, wearing garments of green above and purple below.\n\n**Xǔyuán**’s mother, originally named **Kēdòu** (科斗), underwent a change of name—perhaps this refers to her transformation.\n\n**Yì Qiān** studied under **Lǐ Fēihuá** (李飞华), a native of **Huáiyín** (淮阴), who had resided in **Yì Qiān**’s abode for ninety-four years. At around twenty years of age, he was skilled in the **Qīngyī** (青衣) Dao/Way.\n\nIn **Yì Qiān**’s abode, there were also **Liǔ Miàojī**’s grandson **Fāng Huá** (芳华) and **Ruǎn Huìxiāng** (阮惠香). These three individuals had cultivated profound Daoist/Wayist attainments and were granted passage into the **Bāzhōu Jūtái** (八洲朱台) of the eighth rank, where they received scriptures and became *Xiānfēi* (仙妃, Celestial Consorts).\n\n**Zhāng Jiāngzǐ** (张姜子) was from **Xīzhōu** (西州), the younger sister of **Zhāng Jì** (张济).\n\n**Lǐ Huìgū** (李惠姑) was from **Qí** (齐), the wife of **Xiàhòu Xuán** (夏侯玄).\n\n**Shī Shūnǚ** (施淑女) was from **Shānyáng** (山阳), the daughter of **Shī Jì** (施绩).\n\n**Zhèng Tiānshēng** (郑天生) was the mother of **Dèng Zhī** (邓芝).\n\nThese several women, in their past lives, had practiced benevolent conduct of great renown.

By consuming it, one can disperse one’s corporeal form into the void and merge with clouds and mist.\n\nThe other is **Chuányǐ Hé** (传礼和), the daughter of **Fù Jiàn** (傅建), the *Shìzhōng* (侍中, Attendant-in-Ordinary) and distant cousin of the Han *Huándì* (桓帝, Emperor). Her family ardently practiced the **Fó** (佛, Buddha) and made diligent progress. She would often sweep and clean before the **Fó** (佛) at dawn and dusk, fervently vowing and praying, her heart’s desire being to transform into a celestial being. The divine spirits recognized her sincerity, and she was thus granted passage to this place. After spending a long time in **Yì Qiān**’s abode, she eventually became the overseer of **Hánzhēntái** (含真台). She habitually consumed the *qì* (气) of the Five Stars to attain the Dao/Way, and **Hé** (和) was skilled in song, such that birds and beasts would fly and gather to listen to her voice.\n\n**Máoshān’s** *Xiānrén* (仙人, Immortals)\n\n**Zhǎnshànggōng** (展上公), a figure from the time of **Gāoxīn** (高辛, Emperor Gao Xin).」",

Once, he taught **Mí Chángshēng** (麋长生) and **Sūn Guǎngdiàn** (孙广田, i.e., **Sūn Dēng** 孙登) the art of longevity.

In the second year of **Huángwǔ** (黄武), he gradually began studying the Dao/Way. He encountered **Jièmiè** (介玫) Master, who taught him the **Xuánbái Wèi** (玄白卫, Mysterious White Protection) method, allowing him to eventually vanish his form.\n\nHe resided in **Zhōng Máo** (中茅), then departed and came to **Liángcháng Shān** (良常山). **Dù Qì** (杜契) and **Xú Zōngdù** (徐宗度), along with **Yàn Xiāngshēng** (晏贤生), were all in the **Máoshān** (茅山) region.

He then sought **Yùmén Dānshā** (玉门丹砂, cinnabar) from the **Sīmìng Jūn** (司命君), obtaining twelve *jīn* (斤).\n\nThe *Yǐnjū* (《隐居》) states: Yuànfàng was likely driven by **Wèiwǔ** (魏武) before returning, and the cinnabar he requested was used to forge the **Lúhuǒ Jiǔhuá Dān** (炉火九华丹, Nine-Petal Furnace Elixir).\n\nThe **Dìnglù Jūn** (定录君) spoke in silence: *\"Zhèngyīng now resides at Xiǎokuò Shān (小括山), frequently appearing here.

The *Tài* (泰) hexagram’s sixth line revealed: *\"You shall attain supreme fortune from Heaven; it is fitting to study the Dao.\"*\n\nInitially, he followed **Bào Shuō** (鲍说) but hesitated to abandon his parents. He settled near **Xuánliù Shān** (悬溜山) in **Yánháng**, close to **Yánlíng’s** (延陵) **Máoshān**, which he regarded as the western gate of **Dòngtíng** (洞庭).

They demanded an accounting of **Yīng’s** (瑛) transgressions, threatening arrest if unanswered.\n\nTerrified, **Xuānsheng** (先生) forcefully exhaled and retorted:\n*\"The Dao/Way knows no favoritism—only virtue is embraced.\nHeaven and Earth hold no bias—they reward virtue alone.\nThus, even if **Jīquán** (圾泉) flows with blood, it cannot hinder the **Lóngrán** (龙髯, Dragon-Beard) ascension.\nThe **Sānmiao** (三苗) of **Dānyě** (丹野), **Zhúlù** (涿鹿), and **Jiàngcǎo** (绛草)—how could they obstruct the **Dàshèng** (大圣) from attaining supreme enlightenment and transcendent reach?\n\nMy seventh-generation ancestor, **Xǔ Zǐ’ē** (许子阿), amassed virtue and power, his deeds unseen yet profound.\nIn years of famine and plague, when people barely survived, **Zǐ’ē** distributed wealth to rescue them, personally concocting remedies—reviving **sìbǎi bāshí** (四百八十) near-death individuals.\nHis virtue descended upon us, granting three ascensions and five salvations of the world, with names recorded by the **Tàishàng** (太上).

He fed them in the mountains, and **hǔlù** (虎鹿, tigers and deer) numbering in the tens gathered to eat from his hands.\n\nEach time he ventured out, a tiger with drooping ears and curled tail followed him.\n\nOne day, a man of towering stature—over *zhǎng* (丈) tall—clad in **wǔcǎi xuánhuáng yī** (五彩玄黄衣, five-colored dark-yellow robes) approached, bowing and asking:\n*\"Who are you, ghost or god? What brings you here?\"*\n\nThe man identified himself as a messenger of **Hénà Lǎojūn** (和那老君), inquiring about his credentials. The **Zhēnrén** replied that his name had already been recorded in the **Dānjiǎn**.\n\nThe **Zhēnrén** had once served as the **Dòngtiān Jiǎnzhǔ** (洞天绾主, Master of the Cavernous Heaven), refining the **Dàdān** (大丹, Great Elixir). To his disciples, he declared:\n*\"I shall soon depart for **Kuòchāng** (括苍) and **Gàizhú** (盖竹) Mountains.\"*\n\nHis former residence became the **Chóngshòu Guàn** (崇寿观).\n\nThe *Yúnjì Qīqiān* (《云岌七签_) and *Chìchéng Zhì* (《赤城志_) both record his biography.\n\n**Táoyuán Huáng Zūnshī** (桃源黄尊师), with lofty **fǎlù** (法录, spiritual records), constructed the **Tiānzūn Diàn** (天尊殿) on **Máoshān**, delivering sermons that drew thousands daily.\n\nAs the lecture platform was being assembled, a man burst in, his face dark, his speech vulgar, a **luóbiān** (骡鞭, donkey whip) at his waist—like a merchant’s attendant. He sneered:\n*\"Daoists! Gathering crowds while the world burns—what foolishness! You dare speak idly instead of secluding yourselves in the mountains to cultivate?\"*\n\n**Huáng Zūnshī** (黄尊师), unperturbed, descended from the platform without reply. The crowd, terrified, dared not protest.\n\nAfter some time, the man’s demeanor softened:\n*\"Aren’t you building a hall?

      "translated_text": "**Admonitions on the Perfected Way**\n\n**Hàochuò** was gathering the *Zhen* when, in the early years of the divine *Fèng* era, he came to Huáyáng Cave and saw a young boy playing with three large pearls beneath a pine. Chuò approached and asked whose son he was. The boy fled into the cave, and fearing he might be harmed by a tiger, Chuò followed, calling out for help. After no more than thirty paces, the boy transformed into a dragon, clutching the three pearls to fill its left ear. Bold by nature, Chuò struck the dragon’s ear with his alchemical axe, causing the pearls to fall and vanish, and the dragon itself to disappear. Before he had taken ten more steps, the cave entrance sealed shut. During the Song dynasty’s *Xuānhé* era, Chuò was ennobled as *Yǎngsù* Master. The account appears in *The Dragon City Records*.\n\n**Xuè Biāozhī**, a native of Jìnlíng, from youth shunned worldly affairs and held no desire for rank or wealth. In the second year of the *Jiànwǔ* era of the Qi dynasty, he suspended his worldly duties to seek the hidden and mysterious. After three years, he returned and reported to the *Shùlǐng* Hall of the Great Te Mountain, where he practiced the Dao, subsisting on pine shoots and spring water, passing the years in seclusion. The hall was where the *Rèn Zhēnrén* of Jin had once attained perfection, and the tortoise-shell tablet remained, its spiritual efficacy undiminished. Thus, the master sought the ancient and true, dwelling right there.\n\n**Féng Fǎxiān**, styled *Fǎyuǎn*, was from Qǔ’ē in Jìnlíng. In the first year of the *Tiānjiā* era of the Chen emperor, the court dispatched the middle official *Yú Lì* to summon Fǎxiān, who was then conducting a three-day grand ritual. At each bow in the ceremony, the bell chimed on its own, and when he recited the *Bùxū* scripture, the same phenomenon occurred—all marveled at it.\n\n**Mǎ Shū**, styled *Yàolǐ*, hailed from *Nà* in Fúfēng. He was well-versed in the classics and histories, particularly skilled in Buddhist texts, the *Zhōuyì*, and the *Lǎozǐ Yì*. When the Prince of Shàolíng, *Lún*, served as Prefect of Nánxú, he appointed Shū as his scholar-official. When Lún raised troops to aid the capital, he entrusted Shū with twenty thousand volumes of books. Shū devoted himself to their study, then sighed deeply, saying: *\"I have heard that those who prize noble rank and office regard Confucius and Yan Hui as the highest treasures. Those who cherish mountains and forests revere Yi Yin and Lü Shang as their greatest wealth. To bind oneself to name and gain is like the lofty grass beneath the pillars of a hall, while to despise purity and emptiness is to speak of the worthless husks on a mat. Examining profound teachings, each follows their own inclination. Yet why do those who seek the Way gaze longingly at the path, as if Heaven does not favor the lofty and virtuous? Why is there no fame in the mountains and forests?\"* He then retired to Te Mountain, resolved to remain there. In the first year of the *Tiānjiā* era of the Chen dynasty, the emperor summoned him to the post of *Dùzhī Shàngshū*, but he declined. His vision was keen, able to discern objects at a distance. Swallows nested in his courtyard trees, tame and familiar, perching on his desk and coming and going for nearly thirty years. He passed away in the thirteenth year of the *Dàjiàn* era, leaving behind his *Dao Jué Lùn*, which circulated in the world.\n\n**Dài Shèng**, styled *Shìróng*, was from Qǔ’ē in Jìnlíng. At a young age, he left home, his family’s wealth exhausted, and became a laborer for the village elder *Liú Biǎo*, who was a military officer and fond of hunting. Shèng abandoned him and came to Te Mountain instead.\n\n**Chǔ Yǎ**, styled *Xuántōng*, was from Jiānyún in Hào Commandery. In the late Liang dynasty, he lived in seclusion among the mountains, generously giving away wealth and aiding the needy without measure. When his fields were ready for harvest, he would share the produce with the poor, allowing them to dwell with him. He would rise early each morning to sweep and water, and when fetching water, he would ensure that those gathering firewood and begging for alms were also provided for. In summer, he would plant melons, offering them to those who came to take them.\n\n**Huán Fǎwén**, styled *Yànshū*, was from Dāntú in Shùhǎi, a disciple of the *Táo Yǐnjū* Ertóu. He served as the *Guǎnzhǔ* for the Prince of Nánpíng, *Qīngyuǎn*, but finding his duties too burdensome and hindering his cultivation, he built a *Xuánzhōu Jīngshè* on the right side of *Yùgāng* Mountain. The recluse *Zhōu Chǔshì* inscribed on the wall of the hall:\n*\"Li Jī’s ancient tripod remains,\nZhào Xiào’s winds and clouds depart.\nLofty and boundless, ascending and descending,\nNow entrusted to you, O Master.\"*\n\nThe Prince of Wáng Sēngbiàn commissioned *Lù Huáng* to paint portraits of himself and the recluse on a screen, and also had *Fēibái* script the inscription by Sēngbiàn on the reverse. There exists a *Zhǐ Huán Jì* stating that Huán was the recluse’s attendant. The Daoist *Jiā Shànxiáng* of the Song dynasty compiled the *Transmissions of High Masters*, mistakenly adopting this claim. The *Yǐnjū* book contains his poems upon entering the mountains and his tomb inscription, which suffice to clarify the matter.\n\n**Sūn Wéntáo**, also named *Wéi*, styled *Wénzàng*, was from Kè County in Kuàijì. He entered the mountains to study under the recluse, receiving true teachings, and later saw the *Shàngjīng* handwritten by the Three True Ones, *Yáng* and *Xǔ*. He practiced copying them, becoming highly skilled. He then studied the script of the Great King, achieving profound mastery, and was praised by contemporaries. The *Jiǔxì* inscription of the Nán Dòng and the old *Guǎn* stele of *Xǔ Zhàngshì* were both his work. The reverse of the Nán Dòng stele reads:\n*\"Wéntáo’s heart was gentle yet resolute,\nHis wisdom vast and his insight profound.\nHaving mastered the arts, he left no trace—\nThus, his name was carved in stone.\"*\n\n**Qián Miàozhēn**, a woman of Jìnlíng, left her family to study the Dao under the recluse. During the *Tōngguāng* era, she lived alone in a secluded cave, reciting the *Huángtíng Jīng* at age nineteen. Her dwelling, *Yànkǒu Dòng*, remained for thirty years before she ascended. As she departed, she left a handwritten letter and seven poems to bid farewell to the recluse. One day, she donned white silk, vanished into the cave, and seized the land to establish the *Yàn Dòng Palace*. To this day, female officials tend her shrine.\n\n**The Lineage of the Upper Clarity Daoist Gě Jǐngxuān of Dānyáng:**\n\n**Shuò Shìxiǎn** of Lánlíng, having severed ties with the imperial house, devoted himself to the Dao in the mountains. His diligence in cultivation was unmatched, earning praise from ancient masters.\n\n**Shào Yuàntài** of Lánlíng, whose Daoist influence was vast and far-reaching.\n\n**Xú Bóqiān** of Shùhǎi, whose virtue and teachings were profound and harmonious.\n\n**The Venerable *Bìqí* Huìzhī** of Kuàijì, a monk who practiced *Pútí* meditation, mastering the Five Vehicles and encompassing both teachings.\n\n**Jiǎng Fùchú**, the *Guǎnzhǔ* of Yìxìng, who frequently visited Te Mountain with the resolve to entrust his fate to it.\n\nIn the second year of the *Yuán* era of the Qi dynasty, he was invited to the *Zōngyáng Guǎn* to practice and refine his cultivation.",

The villagers, seeing him, already took him for several hundred years old, yet he always maintained a youthful appearance. During the **Kāiyuán** era, he was summoned to the capital, where Emperor Xuánzōng observed his childlike face and flowing hair, greatly honoring him.\n\nAt that time, Xuánzōng had obtained from **Máoshān** the many Daoist masters Yáng and Xǔ, as well as the original scriptures of the *Shàngqīng* Daoist canon and true writings by Táozhēn. Among these scriptures, thirteen sheets were missing, so he dispatched Wáng Yù with imperial seals, letters, and coins to visit **Zǐyáng Guàn**, where Xuánjìng Master (Xuánjìng xiānsheng) completed the missing text.\n\nThe emperor said: *\"I do not wish to command my subjects to presume upon the Master’s favor. I entrust you alone to go—certainly, I hope for the hand of a Daoist immortal, to ensure the scriptures continue from antiquity to the present.\"*\n\nOn the day Wáng Yù arrived at the mountain, a spirit crane soared and cried.

      "translated_text": "On the first day of the tenth month in the second year of the **Dàlì** era, a heavy snow fell at night. At dawn, **Xīzhēn** opened his door and saw an elderly man in a **suō** (straw raincoat) and **lì** (bamboo hat) taking shelter from the snow beneath his gate. **Xīzhēn** was struck by his unusual appearance and invited him in, whereupon the old man removed his raincoat and hat. His **shénsè** (divine countenance) and **máogǔ** (frame of bones and flesh) were extraordinary, and **Xīzhēn** revered him even more, asking:\n\n\"At home, I have some **dàmài miǎn** (large barley grains). I can offer them to ease your hunger. Would you care to eat?\"\n\nThe old man replied:\n\n\"Barley absorbs the **qi** of all four seasons, making it the finest of grains. If it is seasoned with **zhǐ** (fermented soybean paste) broth, it would be even better.\"\n\n**Xīzhēn** then ordered his household to prepare the barley, and when they did, they also presented **sōnghuā jiǔ** (pine-flower wine). The old man said:\n\n\"The flowers are too astringent—no. But the common folk have something that can refine it and make it truly **chún měi** (pure and exquisite).\"\n\nHe reached into his bosom and withdrew a yellow, hard pill, striking it with a stone. After placing a small portion in the wine, its sweet fragrance became instantly distinct. He then gave the remaining pill to **Xīzhēn** as a parting gift.\n\n**Xīzhēn** returned to his home and, peering through a crack in the window, saw the old man before a **wéi** (screen) drawing on white silk. He sketched as if guided by unseen visions, then paused in an instant. When **Xīzhēn** stepped outside, the old man had vanished. He followed the snow tracks and soon reached the river, where he entered a **lúzhōu** (reed marsh). There, he saw a grand **fǎng** (boat), inside which several men of strange and striking appearances were gathered.\n\nOne of them turned and laughed:\n\n\"Bo **Gěsān**—now you are pressed by this man!\"\n\nHe then addressed **Xīzhēn**:\n\n\"Follow the **Dao** with strict discipline, and such encounters need not occur.\"\n\n**Xīzhēn** bowed in gratitude and departed. Upon returning home, he found the silk drawing. It depicted three figures, two trees, one white deer, and one **yàojí** (medicinal plant). The two figures seemed to be **fāngwài** (those beyond worldly affairs), each holding **xuánzhī** (a type of immortal herb), as if they were gathering medicine. The two trees resembled pines but bore the appearance of ancient, decayed trunks ravaged by wind and rain, their roots intertwined in an unnatural way—beyond ordinary comprehension.\n\nLater, **Xīzhēn** brought the drawing and the pill to **Shān** (Mountain) **Máoshān**, presenting them to **Lǐ Shèguāng**, the **Tiāntái** (Celestial Master). The master said:\n\n\"This is the work of the **Zhēnrén** (True Person) **Gē Hóng**, the third son of **Gěsān**.\"\n\n**Lǐ Shèguāng** further remarked:\n\n\"To depict a **Shénrén** (Divine Person) beneath withered wood suggests that those who attain the **Dao** may live longer than pines and willows. And this pill is made from the **gāo** (resin) of a thousand-year-old pine.\"\n\nThe account is recorded in *The Original Transformation Record*.\n\n**Cuī Xīzhēn**, the **Chǔshì** (Master of Retirement), lived in seclusion at **Máoshān**.

      "translated_text": "---\n\n**Zhāng Shào Yīng**, a native of Dānyáng, became a Daoist recluse and never entered the city gates. Emperor Rénzōng, seeking the wisdom of those outside the court, summoned him along with his friend **Zhū Zì Yīng** to meet the wondrous **Miào Zōng Shī**. They were both called to serve **Yìng Shào**, but **Zhū** declined due to illness. The following year, **Chéngxiàng Dīng Wèi** and **Wáng Qīn Ruò** jointly petitioned the throne, and **Zhāng Shào Yīng** was summoned again. Two years later, when an imperial carriage was sent a second time, both declined, citing illness.\n\nThe court dispatched a eunuch, **Rèn Guì**, to deliver a formal reprimand at the mountain. **Zhāng Shào Yīng** was granted the title *Míng Zhēn Xiānshēng*, and his dwelling was renamed **Tiān Shèng Guàn**. At seventy-five, one morning after bathing and changing his clothes, he ascended the altar, bowed to the four directions, and sat with his shoulders facing above and below. His disciples, astonished, opened the door and found him already transformed. **Wáng Qǎn**, courtesy name *Zǐ Zhēn*, from **Qíxià Píngyáng**, was a descendant of the **Sìdiàn Zhèngxiàng** and his mother was of the **Sīmǎ** clan. His brothers all pursued official careers through the imperial examinations, but he alone studied the Dao.\n\nWhile traveling in the countryside, he rested beneath a melon patch and encountered a Daoist woman begging for melons. Observing her milk-like *qi* concentrated in her abdomen, he was struck by her presence and gave her melons. She ate them and offered the remainder to him. **Wáng Qǎn** consumed it, and the woman rejoiced, saying: \"You may be taught! I am **Xiāo Sān Niáng**, and the Immortal **Hǎichán Zǐ** resides here. When you open your door at dawn, you will see him together with me.\" She then instructed him in the elixir's secrets. From that day on, he revered the statues of the **Sān Qīng** and paid homage morning and evening, reciting the *Huángtíng Jīng* for months without stepping outside.\n\nLater, he journeyed to distant sacred mountains, reaching **Chéngdū** in the west. **Fù Zhèng Gōng**, admiring his virtues, hosted him for eight years. **Chéngxiàng Lǚ Gōng** held him in even greater esteem, and officials wished to elevate him by recommending him for office as a **Guānyì Dàfū**. However, the ministers deemed him unsuited to human affairs and the proposal was abandoned. During the **Yuánfēng** era, he was again summoned to court and granted the title *Chōng Zhào Chǔshì*.\n\nHis nephew **Bìng**, who governed **Táizhōu**, wished to invite him there, but **Bìng** died before the journey could be made. Instead, **Wáng Qǎn** came to the mountain and received the **Shàng Qīng Jīng** from **Liú Xiānshēng**. On the night of his transmission, thunder rolled over **Zhōngmáo Shān**, and the door suddenly opened, revealing celestial music in the air. One day, while napping, he dreamed of two heavenly beings leading him through the door to a cave, where he met **Máo Jūn**, who declared: \"You have been assigned to oversee the **Sīmìng Fǔ** in the Northern Quarter. I grant you a golden ruler.\" Upon waking, he predicted his own death and, seated in the home of a mountain Daoist named **Gě Chōng**, ascended in transformation at age sixty-one.\n\n**Wáng Qǎn** practiced austere refinement, consuming only enough food to sustain an infant. He remained seated through the night, never removing his cap and sash, and even in old age moved with ease. **Zhāng Shùn Mín** composed an epitaph for him, which was engraved at **Fèng Xiāng**.\n\n**Tāng Yòng Míng**, courtesy name *Huì Zhī*, was a Daoist from **Zhōng Líng**. His spiritual prowess was extraordinary, and he mastered the classics while exploring profound knowledge. He specialized in the inner alchemy of the *Zuòwàng* method. At the beginning of the **Yuán Yòu** era, though still in his prime, he heard of **Liú Xiānshēng**’s teachings and traveled thousands of miles to receive them in person, befriending **Lú Bì Qiáng**, **Tāng Dào Yuán**, **Féng Yuè Dào**, **Bào Liàn Shī**, and **Wáng Jǐng Shān**.\n\nWhen **Liú Xiānshēng** was summoned to court, **Tāng Yòng Míng** and **Tāng Dào Yuán** wished to accompany him, but both declined, refusing to go. They built a hermitage on **Jīn Jūn Shān**, dwelling in seclusion beside a cave, with no contact with the outside world. Their rags and worn sandals betrayed no shame. In the early **Dàguān** era, **Tāng Yòng Míng** departed without illness.\n\n**Féng Tàishēn**, courtesy name *Yuè Dào*, of **Chízhōu**, became a Daoist and gathered ten companions to reside on the mountain. When famine struck for consecutive years, nine of them left, but only **Féng Tàishēn** remained, his *qi* refined and unyielding. He stayed long in the temple halls, revered by both Daoists and laymen. There was a **Lú Xiānshēng** who built a Daoist observatory on **Càn Shān**, but it was unfinished when he heard of the summons and abandoned the project. His disciples, numbering thousands, dared not return, so they begged **Féng Tàishēn** to lead them. He used all his offerings to repay them and returned to the temple, soon ascending in transformation at his mountain dwelling. His disciples, **Shào Cì Shān** and **Gě Zhēn Yī**, were both serene and self-disciplined, held in respect by all.\n\n**Chén Xī Wēi**, courtesy name *Yàn Zhēn*, originally named **Bó Xióng**, was from **Gūsū**. His father, **Zhī Cái**, served as a **Cháofèng Láng** overseeing the grain supplies of **Jiāngníng Fǔ**. During the **Yuán Yòu** era, **Bó Xióng** fell gravely ill, and his wife, the younger sister of **Ménxià Shìláng Xuē Áng**, begged **Liú Xiānshēng** for a talisman and sacred water to cure him. His illness was swiftly healed. After his father’s death, he took up mountain life as a Daoist, changed his name to **Xī Wēi**, and built a dwelling above **Liǔ Jì Quán**.\n\nEmperor **Huìzōng** heard his name and repeatedly summoned him, but **Chén Xī Wēi** declined each time. The court then encouraged him to establish a Daoist observatory, naming it **Bàoyuán Guàn**, and granted him the title *Dòngwēi Fǎshī*. During the **Xuānhé** era, he was invited to write petitions for others, but he resigned after just one day. **Huáng Chéng**, a native of **Pílíng**, was affiliated with **Dānyáng Xiāntái Guàn**. In the early **Chóngníng** era, he was persuaded to change the name of **Yùchén Guàn** to **Chóngníng Wànshòu Gōng**, and **Chéng** was appointed as its abbot.\n\nSoon after, **Huìzōng** issued an imperial seal summoning him to the capital. When **Chéng** arrived, he was instead assigned to oversee **Shénxiāo Wànshòu Gōng** on **Jīn Shān**. He was repeatedly granted the titles *Tàisù Dàfū*, *Chōngsù Jìngyī Xiānshēng*, and *Lǐng Yùtáng Gāoshì Zuǒyòu Jiē Dōulù Jìngyī Gōngshì*, with a stipend of 1,200 households and a purple-gold talisman. He requested retirement and returned to the mountain, departing in his hermitage built at **Yùchén**. Initially, the **Sānyuán Jīnglù**—including **Lónghǔ**, **Zhèngyī**, **Gézào**, **Língbǎo**, and **Máoshān Dàdòng**—each followed their own traditions. **Chéng** petitioned to unify them, and from this point, the lineages of **Lónghǔ Gézào** and **Shàngqīng Bìfǎ** began.\n\n**Yáng Xī Zhēn**, courtesy name *Yuán Dào*, was a descendant of the **Yízhēn Mǐshāng** family, accumulating hidden virtue. **Yuán Dào** was born in the first year of **Jiànzhōng Jìngguó** (1101), and at six he could speak. As he grew older, he knew to honor the statues of the **Sìshèng Zhēnjūn**. One night, he dreamed of a divine being who said: \"I am the Northern Quarter’s **Tiānfú Shàngshuài**. Pitying your sincere devotion, I will reverse your impure physical form and meet you at the **Huáyáng Xiānfǔ**. I will grant you a new body and bestow upon you sacred scriptures.\"",

      "translated_text": "「Later, the Master often communicated with the unseen and divine, and if he suffered from any physical ailment, he would rush about in a frenzy, losing all sense of direction. In the second year of **Xuānhé** (1120), in the year of **Gēngzǐ**, he entered the **Huáyáng Dòng** and did not return.\n\nThe following year, he emerged from the cave, and upon his return, his neighbors were astonished. The Master said: \"I was not truly mad before; I sought only the Dao. Now I have obtained **Tóngchū**’s initial great method, which can save the world.\"\n\nThe **Huīzōng** Emperor sought out this extraordinary man and requested the **Jiǔ Líng Yùyīng Shénbiàn** scriptures, along with the **Língxū Mìzhǐ** and other sacred texts. He was ordered to refine and compile them into the **Jiéhuáng Jiàodìng Lù**, to be included in the **Dàozàng** (Daoist Canon). The Emperor specially bestowed upon him the titles **Dāntái Láng**, **Chōnghé Miào-Yī Fǎshī**, and **Shìcháo Qǐng Dàfū**.\n\nAt the age of twenty-four, his physical form dissolved (**shísèjiě**), but after three days, he revived. He wrote a farewell note to his disciples, placed it on the door, and then sat down and passed away—on the seventeenth day of the third month, in the year of **Jiǎchén**.\n\nThus, **Tóngchū**’s method became renowned in the world, and his disciple, **Ménrén** the **Wèiláng** (Assistant Minister) **Shěn Yù**, composed the *Biography of Master Yáng Zhēn*.\n\n**Shěn Yù**, courtesy name *Zǐzhōu*, hailed from a distant lineage that, during the time of **Hàoyuè**’s **Qián Shì**, served as a strategist. They became **Qián Táng** (Hangzhou) people, and their clan flourished in grandeur. As a young man of about ten years, he took no pleasure in mundane affairs but sought out the **Yuánzhēn Guàn** in his native district and became an ascetic. In the year **Yuán Yòu Gēngwǔ** (1090), he passed the **shìjīng** (scripture examination) and became a Daoist priest at the age of thirteen.\n\nHe studied the **Dàozàng** meticulously and supplemented his learning with external texts, comparing and harmonizing them with his fellow scholars. His understanding was comprehensive and profound, especially in the art of medicine. While traveling in the mountains, he visited the **Chóngxī Guàn** and lodged there. In the latter years of **Zhènghé**, he was invited to the **Yánkāng Dìng** as a **Xuéshì** (scholar-official). **Wáng Gōng Hànzhī** sought his counsel on inner and outer alchemy (**nèidān wàidān**), and they found mutual accord. When **Wáng Gōng** led the retreat to **Jiànkāng**, he settled in the **Dòngyáng Guǎn** within the mountains, and the Master was tasked with refining the great elixir (**dàyào**) while also widely dispensing medicine to cure the sick from all directions.\n\nThe **Huīzōng** Emperor summoned him again, compelling him to take up residence in the **Lóngdé Gōng**. After several months, the Emperor granted him the title **Dòngyuán Dàshī** and appointed him to a Daoist office. He declined due to illness, and the Emperor bestowed upon him a **jīnfāng fú** (golden prescription talisman) before sending him back to the mountains.\n\nAt the beginning of the **Shàoxīng** era (1131), he consumed the elixir and his physical form dissolved (**shísèjiě**) at the age of sixty-two.\n\n**Tāng Yǒuchéng**, courtesy name *Dàoyuán*, was from **Tóngchuān** (Tongchuan). His elder brother **Tāng Jǐngrén** passed the **Jìnshì** examination. In the year **Xīníng Bǐngchén** (1066), he and his younger brother **Yǒuzhí** both took the **shìjīng** examination and became Daoist priests together.\n\n**Yǒuchéng** served under **Xú Shénwēng** in **Tàizhōu**. The Master’s understanding of the **Tiān jī** (heavenly mechanism) was profound and subtle; he rarely interacted with others, only speaking with **Yǒuchéng** at times. After residing there for over a year, he once caught two mice, sealed them in a jar, and intended to release them. But upon opening the jar, the mice were already dead. The Master scolded him sharply (**duōduō yǒu suǒ yóu**), then ignored him entirely, and **Yǒuchéng** thus left his service.\n\nThe Master then instructed him to go to **Liú Zhēnshī** to receive the scriptures and methods (**jīngfǎ**), and together they cultivated in the **Hèmiào** (Hall of Cranes). **Wáng Gōng** invited him to oversee the **dànlú** (elixir furnace), and he also followed **Wáng Gōng** into exile at **Háoliáng**. When **Wáng Gōng** returned, they once again retreated to the **Hèmiào**.\n\nDuring the **Xuānhé** Emperor’s summons for extraordinary men (**yìrén**), **Yǒuchéng** and his brother hid in secluded mountain huts, always fearing discovery. In the **Jiàn Yán** era (1127), when bandits rose in rebellion, **Yǒuzhí** fled into a deep ravine and never returned, while **Yǒuchéng** lived in the mountains for over fifty years. Upon returning from **Háoliáng** to **Jiànzhōu**, he never left his home again.\n\nIn the year **Shàoxīng Guǐhài** (1143), he foretold his passing. On the fifth day of the sixth month of that year, he drank cold water and bathed, asking when the day would end. At noon, he departed (**shì**), at the age of eighty-four.\n\n**Lǐ Jué**, a native of **Guǎnglíng Jiāngyáng** (Yangzhou), engaged in the trade of **yào** (medicinal herbs).

At sixty years old, a Daoist instructed him in **tāixī** (embryonic breathing) and **xī** (suspended animation), and he abstained from food for long periods. **Jué** revered him even more, inquiring about his Daoist practices, but **Kuān** humbly declined, claiming he was merely a commoner who sold medicinal herbs. **Jué**#7 sighed: *\"This is beyond the reach of ordinary mortals—his hidden virtue is unmatched.\"*\n\n**Kuān** lived over a hundred years, remaining agile and vigorous until one night he suddenly passed away. After three days, his coffin split open, revealing his body as withered as a **chántuì** (cicada’s shed skin). The account appears in the *Xù Xiān Zhuàn* (Continuation of the Immortal Records).\n\n**Fù Xiāo**, styled **Zǐ’áng**, hailed from **Jìnlíng**. Well-versed in antiquity and the classics, he excelled in calligraphy, particularly in **lì** and **gǔ** scripts. Entering Daoism from Confucianism, he resided at **Chángzhōu Tiānjìng Guàn**. Emperor **Gāozōng** summoned him to oversee the **Tàiyī** shrine, but he begged to return to **Máoshān**, receiving the title **Míngzhēn Tōngwēi Xiānsheng** and serving as **Shānmén Dùdàozhèng** at **Yùchén Guàn**, where he established the **Léipíng Yùan**. For forty years, he wandered the mountains, seeking hidden truths, rescuing the destitute, and benefiting many. He recompiled the *Yǐnjū Jí* and revised the *Máoshān Jiùjì*, though much of his work is now lost.\n\nOn the **Jìchǔ** day of the **Shàoxīng** era’s **29th year** (1159), on the first day of spring, he ascended.\n\n**Yáng Rèn Dīng**, styled **Zhíjiǎ**, was from **Xiāngzhōu** in **Héběi**, with a commanding presence and imposing **qi**.\n\nIn the **30th year of Shàoxīng** (1160), he resigned his post and entered the mountains, building a hermitage beneath **Sōngshū Fēng**. **Wáng Yáng Gōng Cúnzhōng** dispatched five hundred soldiers to assist in constructing its foundation.\n\nWhen the hermitage was complete, the master declared: *\"I have never sought faith in mortals, only in Heaven.\"* Thus, he named it **Tiānxìn** (Heaven’s Faith). The master was adept in the **biàn dùn** (transformation and evasion) arts—truly a **zhēn yǐnzhě** (true recluse).\n\nBorn in the **Chúnhuà** era of **Tàizōng** (921), he passed away on the **15th day of the 2nd month of Chúnxī** (1178), at the age of **184**.\n\n**Liú Dàohuái**, a native of **Ēnzhōu**, was known as the **Suōyī Xiānsheng** (Straw-Cape Master), residing at **Qíyún Yùan**. Emperor **Gāozōng**, in his own hand, summoned the master to serve as **Liúshǒu**, but **Cháo Gōng Qiānzhī** conveyed the imperial intent, urging him to accept. The master was forcibly escorted to the capital.\n\nAt the time, **Wán Yán Líng Yángwáng** **Wán Yán Líng** of **Jīn** (Emperor Yáng of Hǎiliáng), **Guānyán Ráng**, threatened **Guāzhōu**. The emperor, fearful, consulted him on state affairs. The master replied bluntly: *\"No matter—no matter. The north and south will simply exchange rulers.\"*\n\nSoon after, **Hǎiliáng** was assassinated, and **Gāozōng** abdicated in favor of **Xiàozōng**.\n\nThe master, aged **84**, died seated in **Qíyún**.\n\n**Táo Yuánjìng**, from **Cáozhōu**, resided in the southern mountains. Like the **Suōyī Xiānsheng**, he was summoned, but he submitted a petition declining and returned to the mountains in the **18th year of Shàoxīng** (1148). At the time, they were known as the **Táo-Liú Érgōng** (Masters Táo and Liú).\n\n**Chén Huái**, of **Jīngkǒu**, was styled **Jìngzhēn Xiānsheng**. During the **Shàoxīng** era, he served as **Dàizhì**, but declined office and retreated into the woods, constructing an **Bāguà Tái** in the east of **Máodòng**.

He took up a brush to leave a poem before departing.\n\nThe next day, the guardian brought the poem to *Bāo Shǒumíng*, the magistrate under *Chóngxǐ* jurisdiction.

Fàn dreamed that the Immortal of the Teahouse gave him a talisman and incantation, commanding him to subdue the tide. The next morning, he forgot it, but that evening, he dreamed of it again—three nights in total. Finally, he went to the imperial court to confess, and the authorities tested his method. When the tide raged, Fàn hurled the talisman and shouted, and the tide immediately retreated. From then on, the waters caused no more harm. The court appointed him to the Daoist bureaucracy, bestowed gold and silk, which he refused, asking only for exemption from taxes on his hermitage’s fields.

There is also the **Gǎngshén Ān** [Hermitage of the Harbor Spirit], situated behind the halls, which was burned by bandits in the **Jiàn’ān** [Rebuilding and Peace] 4th year [1130]. In the **Shàoxīng** [Glory to the Song] year **Wùyín** [1138], **Gāozōng** [Emperor Xiaozong] granted gold for its reconstruction and personally inscribed the palace plaque.\n\nDuring **Lǐzōng**’s reign [1224–1264], the halls underwent repairs, and the emperor inscribed two plaques: **\"Shùqīng Zōngtán\"** [Altar of the Upper Clarity Sect] and **\"Shèngdé Rényòu Diàn\"** [Hall of Sacred Virtue and Benevolent Assistance].\n\nThe **Chóngxǐ Wànshòu Gōng** [Palace of Venerable Longevity and Universal Auspiciousness], located at the **Dīnggōng Shān** [Dinggong Mountain]’s forefront, was originally the site of **Yǐnjū Huáyáng Xiàwǎn** [Master Tao’s Secluded Dwelling in Mount Hua’s Lower Reaches]. In the **Táng Zhēnguān** [Tang Zhenguan] 9th year [635], **Emperor Taizong** [of Tang] built it for **Wáng Fǎzhǔ** [Master Wang, the Law Sovereign], naming it **Tàipíng Guān** [Hall of Great Peace]. In the **Tiānbǎo** [Heavenly Treasure] 7th year [748], **Emperor Xuánzong** [of Tang] forcibly took it from **Lǐ Xuánjìng** [Master Li of Mysterious Tranquility], relocating a hundred households of commoners nearby, exempting them from rent, taxes, and corvée labor, and perpetually assigning them to maintain the hall’s upkeep and cleanliness. During the **Zhōnghé** [Intermediate Harmony] period [881–885], bandits set it ablaze.",

During the **Song Tàishǐ** [Song Taishi] period, the Daoist **Wáng Jǔ** [Master Wang] was highly regarded by **Jǐngwáng Yǎ** [Prince Jing of Chángshā, the Wise], and thus established the **Chángshāo** [Long Shao] retreat in the residence of the Chief Clerk.\n\nIn the **Liáng Tiānjiàn** [Liang Tianjian] 13th year [514], it was decreed to move it to **Júyáng** [Juyang] and name it **Júyáng** [Juyang] retreat, where **Táo Zhēnrén** [Master Tao] resided. A **Zhāozhēn Tái** [Platform of Illustrious Virtue] was erected to enshrine the true traces, scriptures, and edicts of **Yáng, Xǔ** [Masters Yang and Xu], and the three **Zhēnrén** [True Persons].\n\nIn the **Táng** [Tang Dynasty], **Emperor Taizong** [of Tang] built the **Huáyáng Guān** [Hua yang Hall] for **Tóngwú Xiansheng** [Master Mr. Tong of the Willow Grove].

It was then decreed to take two hundred households of nearby commoners, exempting them from rent and corvée labor, and permanently assigning them to maintain the hall’s upkeep and protection. **Wáng Zhēnshù** [Master Wang of the Pure and Substantial] of **Nán Táng** [Southern Tang] later resided there.\n\nIn the **Song Dàzhōng Xiángfú** [Song Dazhong Xiangfu] 1st year [1008], it was renamed **Yùchén Guān** [Jade Dawn Hall]. **Dìnglù Jūn** [Lord Dinglu] said: \"This is the land marked for a tranquil retreat, the very site where the **Xuánjìng** [Mysterious Tranquility] retreat once stood. If it were not for the **Xuánjìng Xiansheng** [Master Xu of Mysterious Tranquility] and his son, how could this place have been preserved?\" He added, \"Future generations will have virtuous descendants who will reside here—this is indeed a blessed land.\" He further declared, \"This is the very auspicious land of **Jīnlíng** [Jinling].\"\n\n**Chóngshòu Guān** [Hall of Venerable Longevity], located beneath **Dà Máocāng Shān** [Great Teased Mountain], south of **Huáyáng Dòng** [Hua yang Cave], and before the **Biànmén** [Convenient Gate], was the former residence of **Jìn Zhēnrén Rén Dūn** [Master Ren Dun of the Jin Dynasty]. In the **Song Yuánjiā** [Song Yuanjia] 11th year [434], **Lù Tàihòu** [Lady Lu] began constructing the hall. During the **Tàishǐ** [Taishi] period, **Kǒng Suìzhī** [Master Kong of the Lu country], the governor of **Lúlíng** [Luling], rebuilt it, and provided sustenance for the Daoist **Huà Wénxián** [Master Hua of the Wen clan, the Virtuous and Exalted] from **Qǔ’ē** [Master Qu of the E clan].\n\nIn the **Qí Jiànyuán** [Qi Jianyuan] 2nd year [478], it was decreed to establish the **Chóngyuán** [Venerable Source] retreat, with the **Tàizǐ** [Crown Prince] and **Emperor Wǔdì** [of Qi] visiting in person. **Wáng Wénqīng** [Master Wang of the Pure and Clear], the host, arranged the halls and chambers, which were most fitting and harmonious.\n\nIn the early years of the **Táng** [Tang Dynasty], **Zhēnguān** [Zhenguan], it was renamed **Chóngyuán Guān** [Hall of Venerable Source].

In the **Song Dàzhōng Xiángfú** [Song Dazhong Xiangfu] 7th year [1014], it was decreed to bestow its current name.\n\n**Dìnglù Jūn** [Lord Dinglu] said: \"Even beneath **Dà Máocāng Shān** [Great Teased Mountain], there is a spring, and beneath it, one may establish a tranquil retreat. Near the spring’s mouth is where one should reside.\" **Yǐnjū** [Master Tao] noted, \"In the present age, there are those who reside near the southern entrance of **Dàdòng** [Great Cave], where the water flows well but is rocky.

The hall was later destroyed by war. During the **Sòng Zhènghé** [Song Zhenghe] era, Daoist **Zhuāngshènzhì** [Solemn and Reverent] rebuilt it. The **Yǐnjū Dānjǐng** [Secluded Dan Well] and **lóujī** [pavilion foundations] remain there.\n\nThe **Quányuán Guàn** [Complete Record Hall] bears this inscription from **Dìnglù Jūn** [Lord of the Record], who said: Beneath **Dàhéng Shān** [Great Horizontal Mountain] lies a spring. Long ago, **Lǐ Míng** [Master Li] refined immortal elixir here and ascended to **Xuánzhōu** [Mysterious Isle]. In the **Tiānjiàn** [Heavenly Governance] 14th year [423], the recluse **Bìyù Gāng** [Obsidian Jade Ridge] built a retreat to follow the traces of Xuánzhou. During the **Tiānbǎo** era, Master Xuánjìng resided there, erecting the **Qízhen Táng** [Abiding-in-Truth Hall] and five pavilions: **Huìzhēn** [Gathering Truth], **Hòuxiān** [Awaiting Immortality], **Dàodé** [Dao Virtue], **Yíng’ēn** [Receiving Grace], and **Bàibiǎo** [Kneeling in Reverence]. In the **Dàzhōng Xiángfú** [Great Harmony Auspicious] 2nd year [1014], Master Guànmiào constructed a nine-tiered platform for Dao practice. In the **Tiānsèng** [Heavenly Veneration] 3rd year [1025], it was renamed **Jíxū’ān** [Gathering Void Hermitage], later restored to its current name.\n\nThe **Yàn Dòng Gōng** [Swallow Cave Palace] is at **Yànkǒu Dòng** [Swallow Mouth Cave]. A female immortal, **Qián Miàozhēn** [Money Miao True], vanished here, and a shrine was erected in her honor. A stele by **Liáng Shàolíng Wáng** [Liang Prince of Shaoling] no longer exists. In **Tiānbǎo** 7th year [748], the palace was granted its name, and three female Daoists were ordained to tend the incense. In **Yuányòu Jiǎchén** [Elemental Revival, Year of the Dragon] [1084], it was burned by wildfires and relocated to **Jùróng Xiàn** [Jurong County]. In **Shàoxīng** [Sovereign Peace] 20th year [1150], it was rebuilt on its original site in the west of **Zhōngmáo** [Central Teased], adjacent to the **Hèmiào** [Crane Temple].\n\nIn **Tiānbǎo** 7th year [748], a **jìngshè** [pure dwelling] was established beneath the temple, where Daoists were ordained and incense burned in honor of the **Sānmáo Jūn** [Three Teased Lords] and the Daoist patriarchs.

In the **Bǎolì** [Treasure History] 2nd year [826], it was granted imperial patronage and renamed **Bǎolì Chóngyuán Shèngzǔ Yuàn** [Treasure History Nurturing Origin Sacred Ancestor Hall]. At the time, **Zànhuáng Lǐ Déyù** [Li Deyu of Zhanhuang] enshrined statues of **Lǎozǐ** [Old Master], **Kǒngzǐ** [Confucius], and **Yín Zhēnrén** [Immortal Yin], and venerated **Tàixuān Zhōu Shī** [Master Zhou of Supreme Mystery] here. During the **Zhìpíng** [Political Peace] era, it was renamed **Hóngxǐ Guàn** [Auspicious Felicity Hall]. In **Xuānhé** [Extended Harmony], it received its current name.\n\nThe **Tiānsèng Guàn** [Heavenly Veneration Hall] is atop **Jījīn Shān** [Accumulated Gold Mountain]. In the early **Tiānjiàn** [Heavenly Governance] era, the recluse **Bì** [Obsidian] cultivated at **Xiǎozhǎo** [Small Marsh], nurturing a dragon child in the **Léipíng Chí** [Thunder Calm Pool]. During the **Zhēnguān** [Zhenguan] era, **Wáng Fǎzhǔ** [Master Wang, the Law Holder] resided here and encountered the immortal **Fǎběn Xiānrén** [Master Faben]. In the **Sùzōng Zhìdé** [Suzong Rectified Virtue] era, it was granted the name **Huǒyuàn Gōng** [Fire Hall Palace]. By the end of the Tang, it fell into ruin. In **Jìngdé** [Jingde] 3rd year [1006], Master **Míngzhēn Zhāng Shàoyīng** [Illuminating Truth Zhang Shaoying] rebuilt it. Mingzhen, along with **Zhū Guànmiào** [Master Zhu of Illuminating Mystery], were the two transmitters of the **Míngsù Tàihòu** [Illuminating Lineage Grand Empress]. In the 9th month of **Tiānsèng** 3rd year [1025], his residence was granted the name **Yánzhēn’ān** [Extending Truth Hermitage], and in the 5th year [1027], it was renamed **Qízhen Guàn** [Abiding-in-Truth Hall], located west of **Huáyáng Gōng** [Huayang Palace].\n\nThe **Yǐnjū Zhōngguǎn** [Secluded Middle Hall] was the residence of **Huáyuán Huáng Zūnshī** [Revered Master Huang of Peach Grove], with a stele inscribed by **Hézhōu Lú Shìmóu** [Lu Simou of Hezhou], now lost. During the **Xuānhé** era, it was granted its name.\n\nThe **Wǔyún Guàn** [Five Clouds Hall] is beneath **Wǔyún Fēng** [Five Cloud Peak]. Built during the **Tiānsèng** era, it was later granted its name after **Chéngxiàng Wáng Gōng Qǐnrú** [Chancellor Wang Qinru] passed away. **Xǔ Guó Fūrén** [Lady Xu of the State] petitioned the court to establish it as his resting place, and **Yàn Yuánxiàn Gōng** [Yan Yuanxian, Duke of Yuan] inscribed the stele.\n\nThe **Qīngzhēn Guàn** [Pure Truth Hall] is at **Dàluó Yuán** [Great Luo Spring]. During the **Zhènghé** era, the Daoist **Hàodé Qīng** [Virtuous Virtue Qing] built a hermitage to welcome wandering Daoists. Emperor **Huízōng** granted it the name **Guàn** [Hall]. Every year on the 18th day of the 3rd month, Daoists from afar gather to pay homage to the **Máo Jūn** [Teased Lord]. During the rituals, white cranes often soar overhead, giving rise to the legend of the **Hèhuì** [Crane Assembly].\n\nThe **Bái’yún Chóngfú Guàn** [White Cloud Nurturing Virtue Hall] is beneath **Bái’yún Fēng** [White Cloud Peak]. **Bìyáng Gōng Zhīgōng Wáng Jǐngwēn** [Palace Official Wang Jingwen of Biyang] retired here. Jingwen gained renown at the **Déshòu Gōng** [Longevity Nurturing Palace], and the hall was granted its name. He was later promoted through Daoist ranks, serving four successive courts. During the reign of **Níngzōng’s** [Ningzong] grandson, he received ordination and, upon ascending the throne, was granted the title **Xūjìng Zhēnrén** [Void Stillness Immortal]. **Dài Xī Xuéshì** [Scholar Dai of Dai Stream] composed the hall’s record.\n\nThe **Níngshén’ān** [Concentrated Spirit Hermitage] is in **Hēihǔ Gǔ** [Black Tiger Valley].

Later, **Wénqīng** [Wenqing] **Wáng** [Wang] of **Jùróng** [Jurong] became the patron of those afflicted with **xiàn** [癣, ringworm], as recorded in his biography. It was known that Xu Changshi had settled here, and through inquiries among the elders, by the **Dàmíng** [Daming] era of the seventh year (1423), an old villager named **Xúǒu** [Xu Ou] recalled that his ancestors had served Xu Changshi and knew of this residence. I have also seen the **Chángshǐ jǐng** [Changshi’s well] within.\n\nThe **Língbǎo Yuàn** [Lingbao Abbey], located at the former site of **Yǐnjū Zhāozhēn Tái** [Hidden Residence’s Zhaozhen Terrace] beneath **Yùchén Guān** [Yuchen Observatory]. During the **Táng** [Tang], the masters **Sūn Zhìqīng** [Sun Zhiqing] and **Wáng Qíxiá** [Wang Qixia] rebuilt it, enshrining the image of the **Língbǎo Tiānzūn** [Lingbao Heavenly Venerable]. The plaque reads *\"Língbǎo\"* [Lingbao]. Within, there is also an ancient **Lǎojūn** [Laojun, Laozi] image of divine auspice. Originally erected by **Xuánjìng Xiānshēng** [Xuanjing Master], during the **Gāozǔ** [High Ancestor, Emperor Taizong of Song]’s reign, **Lǎojūn** [Laojun] repeatedly descended upon **Yángjiǎo Shān** [Yangjiao Mountain] in **Jìnzhōu** [Jinzhou]. A request was made to enshrine his image, and in the **Dàguān** [Daguan] era, fourth month of the third year (1109), **Liáng Wùzhēn** [Liang Wuzhen], a Daoist of **Yùchén** [Yuchen], drew water from the **Zhōuzhēn rén chí** [Zhouzhen Person’s Pond] before the hall—this was the **Zhōu Zhēnrén** [Zhou Zhenren’s] pond. Suddenly, a **zǐyīn** [紫姻, purple mist] enveloped him, and within it, he saw **Lǎojūn** [Laojun] riding a white horse, bestowing upon him the *Tiāndóng Jīng* [Tiantong Scripture]. Liang, though simple and unlearned, thereafter neither ate nor recited scriptures, and his words on others’ fortunes and misfortunes proved accurate. The *Tiāndóng Jīng* [Tiantong Scripture] was later inscribed on stone and transmitted.\n\nThe **Ruòshān Àn** [Ruoshan Hermitage], located east of **Guō Gāntáng** [Guo Gantang]. **Ruòshān** [Ruoshan] was, during the **Kāiyuán** [Kaiyuan] era of the **Táng** [Tang], the **Rùnzhōu** [Runzhou] prefect, who abandoned office and came to the mountain, later residing at **Tàihú Bāoshān** [Taihu Baoshan]. Today, a ruined stele remains in the forest.\n\nThe **Yóuzūn Shī Àn** [Youzun Master’s Hermitage], located south of **Bāguà Tái** [Bagua Terrace], a few dozen steps away. The master’s name is unknown, nor is it known when he resided here. Layered tiles formed its walls, and a stone mortar was carved from rock—its space barely exceeding a *zhàng* [丈, ~3 meters] in length and width. The remnants of his **áo** [鳌, turtle] still linger, long obscured by overgrowth. During the **Shàoxīng** [Shaoxing] era of **Chén Shàngshū** [Chen Shangshu], the hermitage was rebuilt, revealing it once more.\n\n**Gù Zhùzuò Shānfáng** [Gu Zuzuo’s Mountain Lodge], situated atop **Jǔpú Tán** [Jupu Pond]’s **Shímò Chí** [Stone Ink Pool]. **Gù Qiào** [Gu Qiao], who styled himself **Huàyáng Zhēnyì** [Huayang True Hermit], was the author of the *Jiāoshān Zuòhè Míng* [Seat Crane Inscription of Jiaoshan]. Qiao served as **Kànqiú Guān** [Kanqiu Official] under **Hán Qiào** [Han Qiao], later holding posts as **Jiāngnán Jùnshèng** [Jiangnan Circuit Inspector], **Jiàoshū Láng** [Jiaoshu Clerk], and **Zhuózùo Láng** [Zhuozuo Clerk]. After years of neglect, he abandoned worldly affairs and built a dwelling in the mountains. His son, **Fēixióng** [Feixiong], passed the **Jìnshì** [Jinshi, advanced scholar] examination and successively served in various prefectural offices. During the **Dàzhōng** [Dazhong] era, he held the post of **Yùyí Bùmù** [Yuyi Bureau Clerk].\n\nThe **Qín Xì Shānfáng** [Qin Xi’s Mountain Lodge], located beside **Shímò Chí** [Stone Ink Pool]. According to the *Yúdì Xún* [Yudi Seeking], **Qín Xì** [Qin Xi], a **Táng** [Tang] scholar, carved a **yàn** [研, inkstone] from stone to annotate the *Dàodé Jīng* [Dao De Jing]. The *Yǐnyì Zhuàn* [Hidden Retirees’ Biography] also records him as a native of **Kuàijī** [Kuaiji, modern Shaoxing], skilled in poetry. **Quán Déyǔ** [Quan Deyu] remarked: *\"Liú Zhǎngqīng* [Liu Zhangqing] called himself the ‘long wall of *wǔyán* [五言, quintain verse],’ and I, with my inferior forces, though aged, still press onward.\"* During the **Sòng** [Song], **Qíqiū Shānfáng** [Qiqiu Mountain Lodge] was built atop **Hǎiyǎn Quán** [Haiyan Spring]. The lodges of **Zhèng Shàngshū** [Zheng Shangshu], **Péi Tàishī** [Pei Taishi], and **Yáng Shàngshū** [Yang Shangshu] were also near **Hǎiyǎn Quán** [Haiyan Spring]. The lodges of **Zhào Shūjì** [Zhao Shuji], **Yáng Shìláng** [Yang Shilang], and **Zhōu Shìláng** [Zhou Shilang] were all in the southwest of **Zhōng Máo** [Zhong Mao]. The lodges of **Lǐ Shìláng** [Li Shilang] and **Gāo Jiàoshū** [Gao Jiaoshu] were at **Wúzhī Lǒng** [Wuzhi Ridge]. The lodges of **Liú Shìláng** [Liu Shilang] and **Péi Shìláng** [Pei Shilang] were before **Zhōng Máo** [Zhong Mao].

The two lords (二君) once saw a Daoist who had achieved union with the immortals (合仙者), and they also gave these herbs to him.\n\nThe method for obtaining the herbs requires ascending the mountain on the **opening days** (开日) of the **third** or **ninth month**, carrying **two golden rings** (金环), and offering them with a solemn oath. The two lords did this three times as a pledge of sincerity, casting the rings onto the stones and not looking back. The immortals value **green rings** (青环) as tokens of trust.\n\nThe **first herb, Lóngxiān Zhī** (Dragon Immortal Herb), resembles the intertwined form of two dragons, with its leaves as scales and its roots coiled like a dragon.\n\nThe **second herb, Cānhéng Zhī** (Dragon’s Back Herb), is vermilion in color, with a radiant luster. When struck, its trunk and leaves emit a sound like metal or stone, and if broken, it can be rejoined seamlessly.\n\nThe **third herb, Yàntāi Zhī** (Swallow’s Egg Herb), resembles **kǎi leaves** (葵叶) but is purple, with a swallow-like shape poised as if ready to take flight. It shines brightly and penetrates with clarity.\n\nThe **fourth herb, Yèguāng Dòngcǎo** (Moonlight Piercing Grass), is green in color, with leaves resembling **xiàngshí** (a type of grass), and its fruit is white like a **plum** (李), standing three to four feet tall. Its fruit emits moonlight-like radiance at night, illuminating a room like a lantern. A single stalk bears nine fruits, which, upon falling to the ground, quickly expand to the size of a seven-inch diameter **mirror** (镜盘), pressing into the earth one to two inches deep. When viewed at night, the fruit’s glow resembles the **eyes of a cow** (牛目) gazing and blinking.\n\nThe **fifth herb, Báijiāng Kǔguò Qièyù Zhī** (White Jiang Bitter-Exceeding Cut Jade Herb), surpasses even the **Yùzhī** (Jade Herb) in bitterness.\n\nThe **Yínghuǒ Zhī** (Glowing Fire Herb), as *Zhēnkuò* (True Edicts) states: On **Liángcháng Shān** (Good Constant Mountain), there exists a herb resembling a **glowing firefly** (荧火), whose fruit appears grass-like but is not. Its **purple flowers** (紫华) are as large as beans, and when viewed at night, they emit light. Consuming this herb clarifies the mind (心孔明), enabling one to read by moonlight.\n\nThe **Jiǔjīng Zǐgē Zhī** (Nine-Stem Purple Mushroom), **Dānzhū** (Crimson Pearl), and **Yùjiāng** (Jade Nectar), along with the **Lánggě Zhī** (Lánggě Herb), are all recorded in *Zhōushì Xuántōng Jì* (Master Zhou’s Secret Transmission of Daoist Penetration).\n\nThe **Dānzhī** (Crimson Herb) mentioned above, according to Daoist transmissions, is not something ordinary mortals can easily obtain.\n\n**Shí Nǎo** (Stone Brain) is recorded by the lords as coming from the northern cave of **Fāngshān** (Square Mountain). **Máo Yangzi Jiāng Bózhēn** (Master Máo of the Sentient Sun, Jiang Bózhēn) once took and consumed it. There is also this substance in the center of **Běikūn** (Northern Kun).\n\n**Shí Shèng** (Stone Victory) resembles stone but is smaller, spotted, and softer. It is found everywhere.\n\nConsuming this causes one to feel **warmth** (身热) intermittently and also prevents **thirst** (不渴). According to *Zhēnzhǐ* (True Edicts), it cures **wind-related numbness and paralysis** (疗风痹).\n\n**Shí Zhōng Rǔ** (Stone Bell Milk) is recorded in the *Běncǎo* (Classic of Herbs) as follows: In **Máoshān** (Mao Mountain), the soil and stones are mixed, and the milk-like substance is slightly black and smooth. It is called **Máoshān Rǔ** (Mao Mountain Milk), with a **slightly cold nature** (微寒).\n\n**Yǔyú Liáng** (Yǔyú Grain), as the *Běncǎo* states: **Máoshān** has excellent specimens, resembling **niúhuáng** (ox gallstone), with layered, armored scales. The finest parts are purple, resembling **miǎn** (a type of cloth), and when blown upon, they leave no residue. However, it should be finely ground and then decocted with water to extract the juice, which must be clarified—**no sand or soil should remain** (勿令有沙土也). As *Yǐnjū* (Hidden Dwelling) notes: This substance is obtained by digging into the earth of **Máoshān**, and the finest specimens bear **purple flowers** (紫华). It is **delicate and refined** (靡靡), suitable for consumption and medicinal use.\n\n**Nánzhù** (Southern Candle), according to *Qīngxū Zhēnrén Nèichuán* (Inner Transmission of the Pure Void Immortal), is a plant whose **trunk resembles wood** (木本), but its **leaves resemble grass** (似草), hence its name **Nánzhù Cǎo** (Southern Candle Grass). It is also known as **Hóushú Cǎo** (Hóushú Grass), **Nánxù** (Southern Continuation), and **Wéinà Mù** (King of the Wéinà Trees).\n\n**Xiǎoxǔ Zhēnrén** (Master Xiao of the Tiny Allowance) states: **Fāngshān** (Square Mountain) has an exceptional variety of **Hóushú Cǎo**, with large leaves. The **Hàoyuè** (Broad Valley) region also calls it **Rǎnshú** (Stained Grass).\n\nAs *Dēngzhēn Yǐnjiào* (Hidden Precepts of Ascending the Dao) records: The **Sān Máo** (Three Mao Mountains) and **Sì Píng** (Four Flat Mountains) have fewer of these plants, but their trunks are large. Their **fruits resemble tea berries** (茱萸), ripening in the **eighth** or **ninth month**, with a **sour yet sweet taste** (酸美可食). The leaves do not grow opposite each other, resembling **míng leaves** (茗) but rounded. Their flavor is **heavy and intoxicating** (厚味小醉), and they remain evergreen in both **winter and summer** (冬夏常青). Their **branches and stems are slightly purple** (枝茎微紫), and the large trees reach heights of four to five **zhang** (丈), though they are **brittle** (甚脆) and easily broken.\n\nThe **good prescription** (良方) attributed to **Shěn Cúnzhōng** (Shěn the Hidden Middle) is not the **Nántiān Zhù** (Southern Heaven Candle), as previously stated.\n\n**Mùběncǎo** (Wood-Born Grass), as *Yǐnjū* states: The finest specimens come from **Báishān** (White Mountain), **Jiāngshān** (Jiāng Mountain), and **Máoshān**. According to *Zhēnkuò*, the **Zǐwēi Fūrén Mù** (Wood of the Purple Darkness Lady) is praised for its benefits, and several prescriptions for its consumption are transmitted.\n\n**Páoyào** (Peony), as *Yǐnjū* states: The finest specimens come from **Báishān**, **Jiāngshān**, and **Máoshān**, being **white and large** (白而长大). Other regions have it, but it is often **red** (赤). There are also three varieties recorded in the **Páoyào Cōng** (Peony Canon): **Máoshān Guànzǐ** (Mao Mountain Crown), **Zǐlóuzǐ** (Purple Tower), and **Máoshān Hóng** (Mao Mountain Red).\n\n**Huángjīng**, when **nine-steamed and nine-baked** (九蒸九曝), preserves youthful appearance (驻颜). As *Yǐnjū* states: It is highly regarded in Daoist scriptures, and its **roots, leaves, flowers, and fruits** (根叶华实) can all be consumed or used in medicines.

The **High Ancestor** **Mēng** possessed profound insight and divine vision, transcending the mundane at **Huáyùe**; when the **Lord** entered the mountains, he rode upon clouds and controlled the **Dragon** of **Nányuè**.\n\nThe **Ancestor** **Xiàn** was endowed with talents both square and round, his wisdom encompassing both **Dao** and martial arts. He pacified the lands of **Kè** and **Yáng**, and the **First Emperor of Qin** praised and lamented him, bestowing the honors of a **Chancellor**.\n\nThe **Father**, **Zhuó**, harbored the **qi** of ancient purity, embracing the **True Essence** of the **Highest Sovereign**. Unwilling to seek office or worldly affairs, he remained steadfast and unyielding.\n\nThe **Lord** received the **Elemental Spirit** at **Miàoshǐ**, standing firm in **Dao** at **Xuánfú**. His natural understanding was singular and refined, his innate disposition lofty and detached. Deeply moved by the brevity of mortal life, he awakened to the possibility of eternal **Dao**—thus he abandoned the **ribbons and official robes** of the **Ministerial Gate**, donning **hemp-cloth garments** in the **mountains and valleys**.\n\nAt **eighteen years old**, he retired to **Héngshān**, there to follow the **Way**. His **inner cultivation** was profound, his **oral teachings** vast; he sustained himself on **cultivated herbs and wood**, and wore **broom and bramble** as his attire.\n\nAfter **six years** of rigorous asceticism on the mountain, he ascended in spirit to the **Western City Lord**, serving him with devotion for **sixteen years**. He was granted **nearness to the divine robes and scriptures**, and shared in the **procession of the celestial carriage**. Then he crossed the **White Water** to reach **Guīshān**, ascending **Qīnglín** to visit the **Queen Mother**. There he received the **inscriptions of the jade pendant and golden talisman**, the **hidden teachings of the Great Dao**, and thus attained the **returned form of jade-like purity** and the **restored appearance of the Minor Sovereign**.\n\nThe **Lord** then returned to the **Celestial Lord**, who said to him: *\"Your Dao has now been perfected; you may now depart.\"* He sought me again at **Nányuè** after **one hundred years**, and then entrusted you with the **Divine Mandate of the Immortal** in the lands of **Wúyuè**.\n\nThe **Lord** then halted his **cloud-carriage** at the **Celestial Crossroads**, and stopped his **feathered carriage** on the **Han Path**. In humble **hemp-cloth and coarse garments**, he returned to pay respects to his parents. His father, wishing to punish him with a rod, saw the **Lord** smiling as he knelt in gratitude, his warmth and reverence complete. The rod shattered into pieces, scattering like lightning—**as though struck by thunder**. The father then commanded the **Lord** to revive the dead, and he summoned the **spirits and deities** with a word, severing the **false bonds of the Underworld**.\n\nThose he revived could not be counted. The **Lord’s** two younger brothers both served the **Han Dynasty**, and at that time, they were all summoned by imperial decree, departing together on the same day. Hundreds of guests, near and far, came to see them off. The **Lord** personally hosted them, initially not differing from common custom, but then said: *\"Though I do not hold the rank of a **Grand Minister** or **Chancellor**, I must fulfill a **Divine Office**. The **Celestial Emperor** has now selected me to serve as the **Superintendent of the Southern Peak** and **Chief of the Records of Life and Death**, a position of great celestial importance. Next year, on the **third day of the fourth month**, I will assume this office—will your esteemed guests still be able to visit me as they do today?\"*\n\nThe assembled guests, filled with delight, all wished to prolong the farewell rites, but the **Lord** forbade them.\n\nWhen the appointed time arrived, the **Divine Office** manifested naturally in a single day: **guest pavilions** lined the gates, **banquet halls** filled the roads, the earth moistened like **fat and oil**, the ground level as a **mirror’s surface**, **celestial officials** arrayed like stars, **heavenly steeds** gathered in clouds, **dragon chariots** from the sea, and **wind-canopied carriages** from the mountains—all arrived in **mist and rain**, their presence overflowing without measure.\n\nWhen receiving guests, the **Lord** offered them **delicacies and fine wine**, **rare fruits and exquisite dishes**, all of which were not recognized by the ordinary guests. **Gold-trimmed tables**, **jewel-encrusted cups**, **celestial maidens** of the **Han**—these were beyond the scope of mere words and symbols.\n\nAt that time, the **Three Sovereigns** invited him to ascend, and the **Nine Tributes** urged him to depart. The **Lord** then gazed upon the **feathered canopy** and composed his **divine appearance**, reflecting upon his imminent departure and gathering his **jade-like brilliance**. Raising his hands in farewell, he addressed all with perfect clarity, saying: *\"The **True Dao** is hidden nearby; it does not demand outward display or dazzling deeds to be seen or heard. I now speak to you not to remain silent, but to encourage my two brothers to follow in my footsteps—though they need not wait for them to abandon their delusions. All who have **Dao** should direct their attentions to the **Divine Immortals**. Now I depart, and I will halt at the **confluence of the Jiang River** and **Jǔqū Mountain**, there to purify and refine myself, before receiving my duties.\"*\n\nThen he ascended upon the **cloud-plow**, his movements serene; he advanced with the **feathered carriage**, his return measured. **Luan** and **Fèng** cried in lament, **tigers leapt** and **dragons soared**, the **purple canopy** transformed into **radiant clouds**, the **scarlet retinue** into **flashing lightning**. Having attained the **unfathomable divine carriage**, he **easily departed** in the **wheels of the Immortal**.\n\nAt this, the people looked at each other and sang in celebration without restraint.\n\nThe **Lord** then **urged the dragon reins** and **soared aloft**, pointing toward **Jǔqū Mountain** to rest. **Scarlet officials** hung in procession, **purple banners** fluttered in the void, overseeing the **celestial tasks** and managing the **records of the Minor Sovereign**. Those who traveled **thousands of li** could not be counted.\n\nWhen the two brothers heard that the **Lord** had attained **Dao**, they each resigned their posts and returned home, ceasing their families’ affairs to cultivate, accumulating **five years** of practice. Crossing the **river**, they sought their elder brother.\n\nThe **Lord** then instructed them in the **Four-Leaf Divine Scatter** of the Yellow Emperor and the **Green Sprout Method** of **changing the withered and nourishing the bones**. With diligent effort, they refined their **elixir** to perfection, their accumulated **qi** sensing the **mysterious spirits**.\n\nThe **Lord** further recommended them to the **Celestial Lord**, urging them to persevere through **hardship** and **bitterness**, and to strive with **great effort**. Thus, the **Lord** was granted the **Divine Appointment of High Holiness**, and they both **rested in the fields of the Peach Blossom Spring**.\n\nThe **Lord** then rode the **Nine Tributes’ carriage**, his **wheels guided by the Three Sovereigns**, drifting upon the **floating clouds** of **Nányuè**. Yet he still **pitying the suffering of the people**, lamented the **plight of the common folk**, and thus promised to descend again to **Jīnlíng** within **one year**, recording their **meritorious deeds** in the **Jade Register**.\n\nThe **Lord’s** depth of **Dao**, **virtue**, and **wisdom**, his **filial piety** and **fraternal devotion** reaching the **Divine**, his **sincerity** in sensing the **mysterious** and **piercing the numinous**, his **earth-shaking and heaven-moving deeds**—from ancient times to the present, none can compare to him.\n\nAs for those who **chase the moon’s reflection** or **control the dragon’s reins**, they still cannot adequately describe his **grandeur**—how much less can they convey the **Lord’s** majesty with such comparisons as **the hidden Yang** or **the submerged Yin**, those who **traverse water and transform into fire**?\n\nThere was a **Daoist** named **Zhāng Yì**, who, hearing of the **Lord’s** near holiness, lamented that he could not see his **true visage**, and feared that the **Lord’s** **supreme virtue** would fade with time, that his **transmitted glory** would dwindle. Thus, he respectfully gathered those of like mind, carefully carving this **transmission** for posterity.",

      "translated_text": "In accordance with the *True Revelations* (*Zhēn Yì*), your noble lineage was rooted in the **Mandate of Heaven**, its green virtue enduring for ages. In the era of King Wu of Zhou, you were the younger brother of Lord Changli of Xuegong, the Ninth Palace’s high minister, and also bore the legacy of Xu Zhao’s meritorious deeds. Thus, you were destined to inherit blessings for future generations, ascending through fortune and birth to fulfill the Dao. By the decree of the Jade Tablets, you were ordained as **Upper Clarity True Person**, ennobled as a **Marquis**, and ranked among the **Ministers of State**, governing the Dao and nurturing the people alongside the Sage.\n\nThough your **True Transmission** remained unseen in the world, none could fully recount it. You, **Master Yang**, named **Yì**, are documented in the *True Revelations*. As the third son of **Changshi**, you were named **Yùfǔ**, with the worldly name **Dū**, and the courtesy name **Dàoxiáng**. Your true mother, Lady Tao Wei, had already ascended to the **Cavern Palaces** and was later reincarnated in the imperial household. You were of **pure and luminous refinement**, surpassing all in your generation. Though recommended for the **Imperial Censorate**, you declined. Rejecting the dust of mundane affairs, you devoted yourself to the **Highest Path**, becoming the **True Master** of **Hongjing’s** esoteric teachings. Dwelling in this residence, you repaired and transmitted the **Sacred Scriptures and Methods**. Often, **Master Yang** would join you, and through repeated communion, you attained **True Sensation**.\n\nIn **Taihe Year 5**, you departed this life at thirty. The *True Revelations* proclaim: *\"Sixteen years hence, you shall ascend to the **Bundle of Flowers** as the **Upper Minister**, serving the **Green Boy Lord**.\"* At dawn, you received the **Scriptures**, becoming **Upper Clarity Immortal Lord**, sharing duties with **Gǔ Xīzǐ**. Your station compared to that of a **Worldly Attendant**. Your elder brother, **Kuì**, with the worldly name **Zhèn**, and your second brother, **Hǔfāng**, with the worldly name **Lián**, also attained the Dao. **Kuì** now has a **Celestial Descendant**, **Língzhēn**, in the mountains, urging the establishment of a **Hall for True Succession** to honor the distant ancestors.\n\nBy the **Sovereign’s solemn vow**, you were summoned to this land, where you **nurtured the myriads** and **molded the virtuous**. You **propagated the Law** and **opened the common folk** to its teachings, drawing upon your **hidden reserves** of the **Three True Ones**. Having long dwelled in **Huayang**, it was fitting to restore your ancestral home, tending to its upkeep. Thus, the craftsmen were summoned to erect this **Hall of Tranquility**, aligning with the **Celestial Sovereign’s decrees** and elucidating the **Great Plan**.\n\nTo the east, the **Green Altar** stands; to the west, the **White Pagoda** rises. Between them lies this foundation. Buried **jade tokens** and **sacred tiles** were unearthed, their **purple bonds** and **white mists** lingering like protective canopies. To the south of the residence lies a well—dug by **Changshi**—and beyond it, a great pond, a remnant of the **Guo Dynasty’s** design. Its source flows from **Tian Gong’s Spring**, its path following the **Ma-Jia Road**, flanked by **Lei Ping’s ridges** and overlooking **Xia Bo’s expanse**. To the north, the **Long Ridge** stretches, while the **Yang Valley’s** willows bend westward. Within these four boundaries, it is called the **\"Golden Ling’s Lung\"**—and **Changshi’s** dwelling was its most distinguished site.\n\nNow, with **rainbow clouds** and **soaring cranes**, you soar high, gazing upon the **vast tides** and sweeping the **ancient capital** into the distance. As the ancients said, *\"Who would dare not transmit this?\"* Thus, I dare to inscribe this stele, offering it to future worthies.\n\nThe **Cosmic Pivot’s breath** now exhales its **Numinous Essence**. Following **Nature’s divisions**, **Awareness** manifests **Form**. Your **Transformation** permeates the **Eight Quarters**, your **Virtue** saturates the **Four Seas**. Your **Traces** vanish like lightning; your **Substance** rests in the **Abyss**. Suddenly, **Mountains rise**; the **Sea’s clouds** unfold. You **Ride the Wind and Swim the Waters**, **Tread the Real and Soar the Void**. Even the **Hidden Artisans** carved stone to build your halls. Your **Aspirations** soared beyond the body, your **Celestial Treasury** rooted in the earth. The **Coiling Peaks** curve gracefully, the **Painted Fields** float like lungs. The **Five Enclosures** face open, the **Nine Rivers** encircle. The **Longyang Ridges** intersect, their **Lush Valleys** meeting the **Flowing Streams**.\n\nThus, it is called **\"Dragon’s Lair\"**—the **Sovereign’s Golden Hill**.

You are **Named the Void Sovereign**, your **Law** the **True Awakening**. **Medicinal Proofs** reveal your **Substance’s Luminosity**; **Zen Insight** awakens your **Enlightened Penetration**. Your **Flight** brings **Reverence and Joy**; your **Grasping the Shadow** bears the **Rainbow’s Glow**. You **Dispel Suffering** and **Return Clarity**, **Restore Hearing**. **Things speak of your Power**; **I see no merit in myself**. The **Confusion of Past and Present** swirls boundless—**Yin and Yang** drift without end. The **Three Realms** deceive; the **Boat and Chasm** shift by themselves. **Coming, you respond**; **without deliberation, you act**.

When the **Master of Xuān** first entered the mountain, he composed a poem:\n\n> *In the cold valley as morning approaches,*\n> *I seek both the **scenic beauty** and the **true Dao**.*\n> *The square altar is shaded by dense leaves,*\n> *The water reveals the **scarlet scales** of fish.**\n> *Though the **peach grove** may shelter beasts,*\n> *The **mushroom fields** await the **worthy**.*\n> *Once the **elixir** is refined, the **stones** will transform,*\n> *When the **furnace** changes, the **silver** will melt.*\n> *Know that this **victorious place** is distant,*\n> *Here, one is **free from worldly dust**.*\n\n**Emperor Zhāo Líng Wáng** once entered **Máo Mountain** to seek **Xuān Qīngyuǎn**, and inscribed a poem on the wall:\n\n> *The **Jīngmén** hills and valleys are many,*\n> *The **wine jar**’s window lets in **wind and clouds**.*\n> *Unless one harbors the **recluse’s spirit**,*\n> *Who can endure the **dew and frost**?’\n\nIn the **west of Zhúyáng’s retreat**, there was also the **Longshà retreat** constructed by **Longshà’s Succeeded King**, whose foundations still remain. **Liáng Chāng Hóu** also erected a **stone stele**, with **Hóngjǐng** composing the inscription, now also found in **Zhúyáng’s retreat**.\n\nTwo miles north, there is the residence of the **recluse Zhōu Hóngràng**. On **Léipíng Mountain**, there is a spring named **Liǔgǔ Jì**, also called **Tián Gōng Quán**. According to the *Máo Transmission*, it states: *On the left of the mountain, the spring is named Liǔgǔ; on the west of the ridge, it is called Yánggǔ.* In the past, **Tián Shū** resided here and drew water, thus naming it. This spring is the **Yùjīn Shā** water, which benefits one’s health. Today, its water is so pure that **clothes washed in it do not require ash**.\n\n**Hóngjǐng’s stone ode reads:**\n\n> *To the left, the **Liǔgǔ** spring flows,*\n> *To the right, the **Yánggǔ** spring rises.*\n> *The earth cradles the **north’s dark hues**,\n> *The well yields the **wind’s gate spring**.*\n\nThere was also the **Guō Yú** pool. In the past, the **Yān brothers**—**Guō Cháo** and his three siblings—all claimed to have **attained the Dao**, and they also held **official positions in the cavern**. **Guō Cháo** was the eldest, and when he first arrived at the mountain, he cultivated here, naming the pool **Yú** as an omen of this **auspicious sign**.\n\nA **stone carving** of **Táo Yǐnjū’s** earlier **small portrait** was initially hidden in the **house of Jiàn’ān Xú Hóng**. In the **Xuánhé Year 12 (1120 CE)** of the **Song Dynasty**, the **Daoist** **Fāng Nánhúá** copied and engraved it, passing it down through generations.\n\n**Huáyáng’s recluse taught his disciples, Lù Jìngyóu, with ten responsibilities.**\n**Táo Yǐnjū’s** **Master** dispatched his **senior attendant disciple** **Dài Tǎn**, who carried **a bamboo tablet and a writing brush**, kneeling to impart the ** Dao/Way** to his **junior disciple** **Lù Jìngyóu of Wújùn**, establishing a **settlement of connected stones** as a **place for dwelling in tranquility**. The **inscription on the tablet** reads:\n\n> *O, respectful Jìngyóu!*\n> *In the past, I served in the **imperial court’s** chambers,*\n> *Attending the **sprouts and dishes** of the **Liáng** court.*\n> *Though close to the **mixed teachings**’s path,*\n> *My heart yearned for the **recluse’s realm**,*\n> *Never forgetting the **dawn and night**’s aspiration for **Máo and Jǐng**.*\n>\n> *Years have deepened,*\n> *Yet **virtue/power** remains nearby.*\n> *The **wind and clouds** gather,*\n> *As you arrive, two springs have passed.*\n>\n> *Thus, I remove my **official belt** from the **blue steps**,*\n> *Hang my **hat** at the **red gate**,*\n> *Clasping hands, I drive eastward,*\n> *Founding a residence on these ridges.*\n> *The **veins and moisture** of the land connect with the waters,*\n> *Moving stones to lay the foundations,*\n> *Ascending cliffs to sever the **dry branches**,*\n> *Crossing mounds to bear the **plants**.*\n> *My strength was exhausted in climbing and building,*\n> *My **qi** and blood fatigued from rushing and walking.*\n> *My skin and flesh grew emaciated,*\n> *Yet I did not grieve at the **harsh exposure**.*\n> *My **spirit** and soul were light and empty,*\n> *Would I care about the **hardships of hunger and cold**?*\n>\n> *The halls and dwellings now stand,*\n> *Enduring the **frost and heat** of the seasons.*\n> *Seven years have passed,*\n> *The initial construction has just been completed.*",

      "translated_text": "The Prince sought worthy men, and the imperial gardens summoned scholars—\nthe court found no fault in its selection, for all who came were men of worth.\nObscured though Oblique’s literary skill might be, it could not rival the balance of a scribe,\nNor could Sun Chu’s eloquence suffice to bear the weight of his reputation.\nIn the Qi dynasty, there was a fondness for grand palaces—\nnow the Prince was restoring the old gardens of Qingxi, rebuilding and expanding them,\nand submitting a petition with a commemorative ode.\nThe work was splendid and refined—\nhis poem of joyful service matched the brilliance of the *Jingfu* edicts.\n\nThe Emperor read it for a long time and deemed it excellent,\nthen granted him the title of *Deliberative Attendant at Court*.\nHe took up his post with solemn duty,\never vigilant from dawn to dusk,\nattending the spring and autumn audiences—\nthis was the way of the unadorned and sincere.\n\nThe Master had never sought honor,\nyet often wished to resign.\nHe wrote to his kin and friends:\n*\"In my earlier years, I never wished to be asked by others.\"*\nAt forty, he fulfilled his ambition in the mountains and forests.\nNow thirty-six, time would not wait—\nhow divine was his foresight!\nWhy should he torment himself further?\n\nThe following year, he submitted his resignation,\nbundling his hairpins and departing beyond the city gates,\nuntying his official sash at the northern slopes of the mountains,\njoining the recluses of Jiqiu, emulating Liu Bang’s refusal of grain,\nand preparing his boat for departure.\nThe court sent inquiries, and scholars saw him off with two *cushion essays* and four *hidden verses*—\nhis departure was as effortless as that of the ancients, though from a different age.\n\nHe set out with staff in hand, wandering through famous peaks,\nuntil he reached Jurong and ascended Maoling—\nthis place was the abode of immortals, a sacred refuge of marvels.\nOnce entered, none returned.\nHe settled there and made it his home.\n\nThe Master said:\n*\"The Master said: ‘Retire to seek one’s purpose, act with virtue to fulfill the Way.’\nI have heard these words but never seen such a man.\nNow my virtue is fulfilled—\nthere is no need for further retreat.\nI ask only to join those who seek their purpose,\nthus I call myself a recluse,\nfollowing Zhi Chan’s *Embrace of Simplicity* and Shi An’s *Mystic Tranquility*.\"\n\nLeaning against cliffs, dwelling in shadows,\nnesting among trees, hiding at the forest’s edge,\nweaving branches into a dwelling, carving a path as his gate,\nfacing cascades from sheer precipices, gazing upon mist-laden woods,\ndeep gorges and steep peaks—\nthe mists entwined like silken threads,\nhis pillow a stone, his cup the stream.\nMountain birds did not disturb him,\nand as he gathered herbs, wild beasts did not dare approach.\nHe wandered freely, unbound by the world,\nhis spirit untouched, as if severed from mortal cares.\n\nWhen the Qi dynasty declined and the Mandate of Heaven faltered,\nthe land of water trembled in Jiachen—\nthe Master, pondering omens, foresaw the signs.\nThus, he cut off all correspondence, near and far.\n*\"I have heard of Xia Fu in the past,\nbut now I see it in you, Master.\"*\n\nThe great fortune of Dai Liang was at hand,\nthe Mandate of Heaven clear—\nthe Three Stars shone bright, the Four Seas at peace.\nThe Master submitted a petition in celebration,\nand his letters were once more answered.\n\nSince the *Tianjian* era, he was repeatedly summoned with imperial edicts,\nsupplied with medicines and provisions without end,\nand showered with seasonal favors unmatched by any other.\nFor seven years, he briefly visited Nan Yue.\n\nThis mountain—\nthe pivot of the *Biwei* winds, the celestial support of Kunlun,\noverlooking the Eight Directions, between the Nine Regions—\nits trees bore fangs of jade, its grasses sprouted chariots.\nDetached from the world, he lingered, forgetting to return.\n\nIn the eleventh year, an imperial envoy, the Left Secretary of State Huiming,\nwas sent to summon the Master back to Maoshan,\ngranting him a residence to dwell in.\n*\"Like Xuān Zhong descending to serve the Heavenly Old Man,\nor the Han Emperor honoring the River Master—\nhow could I refuse such an honor today?\"*\n\nNurturing his purpose amid mountains and rivers,\nhe spent many years refining his life,\nhis vitality preserved, divine omens descending—\nno fierce beast dared approach, no demons or spirits encountered him.\nThorns did not grow in his courtyard,\nhis neighbors were as distant as the *Que* enclave,\nhis steps emitted divine springs,\nand distant cedars swayed in response.\nThus, feathered immortals lingered,\ncelestial guests ascended and descended,\ncranes and phoenixes gathered,\nand the *zhi* and *ying* mushrooms flourished in abundance.\n\nIn the second year of *Dà Tóng* (429 CE),\nin the year *Bingchen*, on the first day of the third month,\nthe twelfth day, *Gengchou*,\nhe bade farewell and departed—\naged eighty-one.\n\nThe Emperor mourned his loss, the Crown Prince lamented in verse,\nand an edict praised his virtues,\nposthumously granting him the title *Great Scattered Official*,\nwith the epithet *Zhenbái Master*—\nthis was the proper honor.\n\nOn the fourteenth of that month, his remains were interred at *Leiping Mountain* in Jurong County, Danyang.\n*\"Like Yellow Emperor’s burial in his robes,\nor Zi Qiao’s hidden sword in the crow’s nest—\ntoday, this may be compared.\"*\n\nThe Master’s bearing was profound and reserved,\nhis thoughts precise and far-reaching,\nhis words pure and auspicious,\nyet he never sought to polish his edges.\nThough his years approached mid-life,\nhe was not bound by rigid measures—\nhis brows and eyes were clear and bright,\nhis demeanor fresh and unblemished.\nHe shunned public office, yet his deeds were kind,\ntreasuring light and shadow, loving the classics,\nfirm in resolve, his virtue unyielding to old age.\n\nAs for the *Huainan* secrets of vast treasures,\nthe *Longxi* earthquake divinations,\nthe *Taiyi* elusion charts,\nthe *Nine Chapters* of calendrical omens,\nYòuān’s swift silver-hook calligraphy,\nYǔn’s mastery of the *Fēngjiǎo* divinations,\nthe *Taicang* prescriptions of the *Suwen*,\nand Zhōngsǎn’s *Lüting* music—\nhe had gathered them all,\nmastering each with precision.\n\nMoreover, in *Yìshè* archery, *Qúnqí* chess,\n*Sū* divination, and *Guān* milfoil readings—\nhe understood them instantly, without effort.\n\nLike Zhang Hua’s encyclopedic knowledge,\nMa Jun’s ingenious schemes,\nLiu Xiang’s discernment of subtleties,\nand Ge Hong’s cultivation of nature—\nhe encompassed all these virtues in one.\n\nHis disciples, including Huàn Fǎyuàn,\nadmired his distant reputation at Wéishì,\nand cherished his legacy at Qiáoyáng,\nerecting a black stone stele to inquire of him,\nsoaring to the crimson clouds where his fragrance lingers.\n\nThus, they composed this epitaph:\n\n*\"The crow departs, his transformation remains,\nthe sword is hidden, his spirit congeals.\nHe lingers in the purple mists,\nilluminating the vermilion woods.\nHis presence lingers near,\nhis teachings endure.\nWho shall inherit this?\nAh, the profound and virtuous man!\n\nHis conduct surpasses the lineage,\nhis virtue renews each day.\nBright as a suspended mirror,\nprofound as the upright bamboo.\nHis body fulfilled the Great Way,\nhis actions never strayed from humanity.\n\nOnce he wandered in silk and jade,\nnow his spirit soars divine.\nWeary of salvation’s toil,\nexhausted by the seekers’ quest.\"*\n\n---\n**Epitaph (as inscribed):**\n*\"The crow departs, his transformation remains,\nthe sword is

Once, while resting by day, she **dreamed a phoenix gathered her**, and upon waking, saw **red light piercing her breast**, thus **conceiving in wonder**. In seven days, she **wept in labor**, her cries heard beyond the chamber, and after a brief **selection of auspicious time**, she **gave birth**.\n\nIn ancient times, **Hàolíng** received **divine blessings**, and **her lineage was traced to the Heavenly Phoenix** through **Lady Wěiyīng**. The **Pillar of History** marked the **flowing sands**, and **its essence was entrusted to the Mysterious and Marvelous**. **Omens of joy** soared high, and **sacred glory** ascended near. **Radiant light** shone forth externally, **proclaiming the transmission of fire** in advance; **hopeful sounds** resounded within, **hearing the guidance of customs** first.\n\nThen, **divine decree descended from heaven**, and he **inherited profound knowledge** from **fragile roots**. The **Dao** **was embraced without words**, and he **fulfilled its essence** in **hidden teachings**. His **filial piety and brotherly devotion** were **fathomless**, his **care for the aged** knew no bounds, his **achievements towered** like **dryad pillars**, his **affections surpassed** the **healthful envy** of the virtuous. With **humble submission to the teachings of the learned**, he **mastered the classics**, **reciting threefold the urgent admonitions of the Zhou**, **transmitting the fourfold poetry of the Ru**, **wearing the leather-bound notes of Kāngchéng**, and **listening to the bamboo and silk of Jìzhǎng**. His **age and eloquence** rivaled the **Three Ancients**, his **lyre and zither** harmonized with the **Hundred Schools**, his **jade writings** were **highly esteemed**, his **golden compositions** **won renown**, his **illuminating words** **outshone the mirror**, his **radiant discourse** **surpassed the clarity of flowing streams**.\n\nThus, he **deeply rejected worldly entanglements**, **early cultivated disdain for dust**. He **loved the net of silence**, **held fast to the emptiness of mortal concerns**, and **gazed at the Mysterious Pass** to **draw a single breath**, **ascending to the Azure Expanse** and **soaring far**. At that time, there was the **National Teacher, Master Zōngdào**, who **discerned the profound and subtle**, **delved deeply into the Mysterious and Marvelous**, **proclaimed the winds of the Yellow Path**, and **composed the instructions of the Purple Court**. The **Nine Palaces** paid homage, the **Hundred Craftsmen** **revered him**, and he **fasted and crafted his steps** in **wondrous simplicity**.\n\nThe **Master of the Dao**, with **two washings of his body in the Dao-wind**, **knowing the tenfold mysteries of the Hall**, **held the lamp’s reflection** beneath the **Jīng and Lán forests**, and **embraced the torch’s ascent** along the **shores of Suí and Hé**. His **dwelling became a void of nature**, his **wisdom deepened** with each **passage of time**, his **teachings** **spread without constraint**, and **his few words** **were ever resplendent**. His **reasoning reached the utmost subtlety**, and he **forgot spoken words** to **realize the Dao**; his **affections abandoned the path of the court**, and he **took the sun’s decline** as **virtue’s gain**.\n\nBy the time of his **coming-of-age**, he **devoutly cultivated the Supreme Way**, and **clouds floated in purple**, **dry cranes displayed their white**, **a tranquil drowsiness hung high**, and **his spirit wandered in distant realms**. The **Chief of Zhou’s Court** **divined the air**, and **his curses rivaled the worthy**; the **Wild of Jìn** **plucked the strings**, and **Zēng Hé** **held the reins**. This was **truly the broad and distant operation of the Mysterious Heart**, **divinely ordained** yet **silent in its marvels**, **auspicious omens** **emerging naturally**.\n\nThe **Master of the Dao** **turned his gaze** to **the myriad blossoms** and **pointed to the faithful**, **leaned on the dry spirit** to **embrace the divine**. Within, **struggle ceased**, and the **Dao prevailed**—**abandoning desires of the flesh**, **resting the wisdom of excessive knowledge**. The **Six Classics and Three Histories** **were cast aside** in his **net of abandonment**, and all that he **once studied** **was utterly forsaken**.\n\n**True colors** **responded naturally**, and he **indulged in the Mysterious Void**. He **expelled and inhaled the Six Palaces**, **discarded the Three Lands**, **erected his nest** **according to the Dao’s strictures**, and **strengthened his steps** **in the path of the Pure and Bright**. Thus, he **immediately began abstaining from grains**, **sustaining himself only on pine and water**.\n\n**The Six Dusts** **did not stain him**, and his **illuminated wisdom** **banished their mists**; **the Five Flavors** **were void by nature**, and his **enlightened discernment** **cut off their sweetness**. He **avoided sounds** **in the path of the silent**, and **extinguished his form** **in the domain of utter darkness**.\n\n**Huàshān’s Huáyáng Peak** was the **eighth of the Thirty-Six Palaces of Heaven**, its **peaks adorned with dragon script**, its **waters** **the phoenix’s gate**. He **ascended the Three Mountains** to **unite with the True**, **pondered the Five Conveniences** to **store the Sacred**, and **presented his petition** to the **court**, **requesting return to the rocks and valleys**. The **Yellow Gate’s Attendant, Hè Chè**, **delivered the imperial decree**, and he **continued his mountain retreat**, with all his needs **provided by the court**.\n\nWhen his **refined aspirations** were **granted**, his **secluded heart** **went alone**, **soaring above the vulgar**, **raising his hands to the times**. He **walked the path of the Sage’s ancestors**, **clothed in humble rags**, and **the Master of the Dao** **cast aside his hairpin** **with purpose**, **finally entrusting himself** to it. **Moisture pervaded the grasses and trees**, **light filled the forests and springs**, and he **swept the clouded paths** **with his feet**, **clasped the lofty branches** **to shift his gaze**. Though **golden brocade and drums** **blended in harmony**, his **solo tune** **was fresh and singular**; though **jade pipes** **played in time**, his **melody** **conveyed the refined essence**.\n\nWith the **Dao’s winds** **drifting far**, **his virtues surpassed** the **pine and cypress**; with **victorious joys** **surging forth**, **his solitude mirrored** the **marriage of the clouds**. How could **the vulgar** **disturb his purity**, or **the profane** **match his brilliance**? Thus, the **Sage’s Companion** **praised his lofty bearing**, and the **Cloud Immortal** **spoke of his distant essence**.\n\nYet when the **flags and banners** **sank to the south**, and the **rites and music** **returned to the west**, the **Master of the Dao** **nurtured his essence** **in the mountain’s heart**, **untouched by defilement**.\n\nIn the **twelfth year of the reign of Emperor Guāng of the Sui**, **Jìn Wáng** **divided the command** **of Shǎn and Wéi**, **honoring and elevating the Supreme Teaching**, **revering and savoring ancient models**. He **extended full rites** to **invite and welcome** the **Master of the Dao**.\n\nThe **Master of the Dao** **declined the summons**, **emerging from his mountain retreat**. The **high officials and royal princes** **in turn welcomed his movements**, **consulting his words**, and every time they **presented their questions**, the **Master of the Dao** **unleashed his boundless discourse**, **covering the present and the past**, and his **eloquence and meaning** **left nothing unexpressed**.\n\nHis **secluded aspirations** had their **origin**, and he **insisted on returning to the mountains**. The **Prince of Jìn** **heavily disregarded his resolve**, **dispatching envoys to escort him**. Thus, the **Master of the Dao** **retired to the cliffs of Tiānchuāng**, **hollowing out caves for meditation**, **rolling up his voice** **to the mountain’s edge**, **barely able to practice**.\n\nOn the **seventh night of the first month of the thirteenth year**, he **sat upright in meditation**, and **it seemed as though a man in crimson robes and feathered attire** **held a scepter and approached him**.

      "translated_text": "「Thus, he **valued the prestige of office and the cultivation of talent**, **appointing him as the teacher to enlighten one region**, **able to proclaim the taste of the Dao**, **and guide future disciples in their cultivation**. Having **received this divine decree**, he **first developed the resolve to benefit all beings**.\n\nThen, he **calmed the waters to mirror the myriad forms**, **refined the virtue of pine amidst the humble grass**, **expanded the profound mysteries**, and **elaborated on intricate principles**—**weighty, complex, and profound**—**to illuminate their hidden depths**; **without pride**, he **offered his modest vessels** to the **six incense burners and four censers**. At the **mountain gate**, **his name was recorded for over three thousand followers**, who **all established meditation halls**, **grand and splendid in their magnificence**. In the **nineteenth year**, the **vigorous sovereign** **Zheng** **sent the official Zhèng Zǐtēng** **with a letter to inquire**, **showing great respect and earnestness**, **truly descending from his carriage**.\n\nIn the **seventh year of the Great Business era**, the **Emperor Yáng** **sent the Gentleman-at-Arms and External Attendant Chuī Fèng** **to convey an imperial edict and summon him**, **meeting him at the Línshuò Palace in Zhè County**. The emperor **then sighed and said**: *\"In my earlier days in Yángzhou, the Master had already **manifested his virtue**. Now, seeing him again, he **still retains his youthful vigor**. Truly, it is because the **Dao abides within him**, and his **nurturing aligns with its principles**.\"*\n\nThe **six armies returned in triumph**, **escorting the imperial carriage to Luòyáng**. He **offered counsel on the rituals of sacrifice at Zhōngyuè**. Yet, the **flourishing virtue of the former dynasty declined**, **loyal and virtuous men perished**, **their aspirations distant and scattered**, **their choices straying from the orthodox**. The **divination of thirty black horses was in error**, the **precautions of five reversals were ignored**, and the **people suffered in misery**—**the Mandate of Heaven had its limits**.\n\nNow, the **auspicious era of the Great Tang flourished like the dragon’s rise**, and **the celestial omens took form**. The **August Sovereign succeeded in illuminating the Dao and governing all**, **bringing light to the abode of the Black Primordial**—**spanning heaven and earth**, **his words established the principles of governance**, **his deeds wove the threads of martial might**. His **divine strategies were vast and far-reaching**, his **Dao encompassed the thunderous clouds and radiant lightning**, **reviving the brilliance of the sun when it was obscured**, **restoring the stars of the Big Dipper as they were about to set**. The **cornerstone was laid**, the **foundations secured**, and **once again, the red carpet was spread**, **reverting to the sacred altars of sacrifice**. **Was it not the grandeur of the Tang that was unmatched**, **its grand decrees worthy of song**, **its virtue as lofty as clouds**, **its gates of doctrine through which all praise flowed**? **Who could attain such heights?**\n\nThus, he **made the heavens serene and the earth level**, **his martial achievements were as vast as those**, **his arms laid down, beasts returning to their wild state**—**his cultural virtue was no less**. **He could be compared to the Four Three Kings and Six Five Emperors**, **matching the Eastern Huò in reverence**, **and surpassing the Southern Fēng in solemnity**. **Auspicious signs appeared in the clouds and stars**, **omens of good fortune descended like silk**. The **individual springs offered wine**, the **luxuriant thorns bent in humility**, the **divine feast was attended by sacred guardians**, the **hallways gleamed with fragrant decorations**. **Majestic and awe-inspiring**, such **grandeur had never been seen before**. Yet, **the sovereign still lowered his heart and stirred his thoughts**, **his meals were modest despite his diligence**, **he restrained himself to ponder governance**, **his nightclothes worn with unwavering devotion**. His **benevolence towered like the vault of heaven**, his **favor permeated even the deepest springs**.\n\nThus, **the Master’s teachings flourished anew**. **He aspired to the ultimate mysteries of the Dao**, and in the past, **when he served as a regional official**, he **frequently received imperial inquiries**. The **Master of the Dao** **retired from the world**, **three times returning to the secular realm**, **his words silent among mortals**. **Yet, whenever he encountered one of the Dao**, **he knew the time for his rise had come**—**now, having met the Dragon’s Field**, he **understood the wings of his inevitable ascent**, **and the phoenix feathers he would soon claim**. Thus, he **gauged the momentum of the rising wind**, **his compassion guiding the first to awaken**, **his grace inviting the benevolent gifts of fate**. **Again and again, he submitted his petitions**, **begging to return beyond the rivers**.\n\nThe emperor **then decreed that Yùzhou provide supplies, men, and ships**, **and granted him Daoist robes**. He **urged the prefect of Róngzhou to build a temple on his former mountain**, **bestowing land**, and **ordaining seventy-seven Daoists** **to serve as his attendants**. In the **fourth month of the Zhenguān era’s ninth year**, the **Master of the Dao** **ascended the mountain**. The **Emperor** **sent the Astrologer-in-Chief Xuē Yǐng, the Palace Librarian Zhāng Dàoběn, and the Left Internal Attendant of the Crown Prince, Guàn Fǎsì**, **to deliver fragrant oils, protective talismans, a golden dragon, and a jade tablet** **to the temple**, **praying for the nation’s blessings**. He **again dispatched the Court Gentleman Xuē Wényuǎn** **with an imperial seal to offer consolation**, **along with sleeves of silk and a staff**.\n\nThe **Crown Prince**, in that **same year’s sixth month**, **also sent the Officer-in-Training Zhāng Wàndí** **to deliver fragrant oils and a dragon tablet** **for the Daoist rites within the mountain**. The **vigorous sovereign** **once more sent Guàn Fǎsì** **with fragrant incense**, arriving at the temple on the **thirteenth of the eighth month**. The **Master of the Dao** **paused in contemplation for a long while**, then **reluctantly accepted it**, telling his disciples: *\"How could this incense ever be burned to completion? **Let it be shared with the nearby temples**, **to widely support the rituals and lectures**, **hoping to touch their hearts**.\"*\n\nOn the **fourteenth day, at noon**, **just as he awoke from sleep**, **his face lit with joy**. His attendants at his side **inquired about the reason**, and he replied: *\"I was recently **visiting the Celestial Palace in my dreams**, and the **immortal officials saw my offerings**. They wished to **bestow upon me a position as an Immortal Lord**, **to compensate for my weary form**, and my **name and rank were already set**. My **ascension would not be long**.\"*\n\nOn the **fifteenth day**, he **bathed, donned his ceremonial attire**, **lit incense, and sat upright**. **He gathered his disciples**, **explaining the emperor’s intent in establishing the temple** and **encouraging them to strive with diligence**. On the **sixteenth day, at dawn**, **suddenly, he smelled an unfamiliar fragrance enter the room**, and **the crows and beasts wailed mournfully**. Turning to his attendants, he asked: *\"What hour is it now?\"*\nThey replied: *\"The second watch.\"*\nHe then answered: *\"Good.\"* **Immediately, he turned his body and lay flat**, **adjusted his own clothes and crown**, **and in a single morning, his nine transformations were undone**, **his age reaching one hundred and twenty-six**. His **limbs were soft and supple**, his **complexion unchanged**. **After his passing, his body was kept for over ten days**, **far surpassing the usual duration**.",
      "overlap_context": "*hollowing out caves for meditation**, **rolling up his voice** **to the mountain’s edge**, **barely able to practice**.\n\nOn the **seventh night of the first month of the thirteenth year**, he **sat upright in meditation**, and **it seemed as though a man in crimson robes and feathered attire** **held a scepter and approached him**. The man said: *\"Hidden in the valleys, concealed by the rivers—your affairs are **self-cultivation alone**. Dwelling in the world, you **should broaden benefits**.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The prefect dispatched the traveling military officer, Master Ma Junwei, to #1 Mountain for mourning and sacrifice, and also submitted a report to the court.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day, he used a talisman and bamboo slips to inscribe the name of the mountain of divine records to its right.\n\nAs for the **Dao/Way of the Sword’s Dissolution**, its profound subtleties are difficult to grasp. Yet when it came to **engrave his title as \"Virtue/Power Lord Bozha\"** and **record his deeds in the immortal ranks**, the **Dao/Way’s sacred texts** were composed, invoking the **emperor’s morning decree**. The **purple jade tablets** were inscribed, bestowing the **command of the \"Great Primordial\"**—a grand edifice was erected, its essence refined, its foundations aligned with the **original and unchanging**, its peaks harmonized with the **luxuriant hills** in slanted rows.\n\nThe **flying stairs** ascended beyond the clouds, the **precarious ponds** lined with **Han-style** elegance. The **dark furnaces** were built with **twisted beams**, the **red pillars** raised with **soaring phoenixes**, the **fragrant pavilion** set in the **marriage of voids**, the **luxuriant treasure platform** placed where **scenes invert**.\n\nAt dawn, the **crow’s nest** swept the light, and the **Dao/Way’s path** led through the **towering questions**. The **hare’s hue** split the night, its **shadows** hidden in the **embroidered gaps** of the **sparse woods**. The **dust vanished** while the **jade-tiled halls** stretched far, the **heat and cold isolated** as the **precious halls** deepened in grandeur.\n\nThe **embroidered clouds** and **congealing mists** vied in radiance, the **clear winds** and **lingering chimes** competed in resonance. Gazing from the **unfettered eaves**, one pities the **endless thousand rocks**; peering through the **carved windows**, all **ten thousand valleys** share the same azure hue.\n\nThe **scaled dragons** stir, their **jade-like armor** shimmering in the **green mirror**; the **clouds and mists** cast their **lighting**, their **rays** arrayed upon the **crimson case of the \"Red Phoenix\"**.\n\nThe **nine-colored** tiles speak in **mixed streams**, their **brushwork** swirling as it **returns and coils**; the **hundred-fold** adornments **polish the vaulted ceiling**, their **patterns** slanting and **twisting**.\n\nThe **frosted bells** echo with **the refined tones of the \"Bright Lord\"**, the **celestial covers** display the **wonders of mortal craftsmanship**.\n\nThe **listening monks** gather at the **eastern gallery**, the **feathered guests** rest in the **southern hall of honor**. The **eaves** measure the **dark frost**, the **courtyard** freezes with **crimson snow**.\n\nIn ancient times, the **Han Emperor**’s grand procession stood only the **Mysterious Palace** in **Yuzhang**. The **Qi Duke**’s nine victories saw the **main chamber** heard of in **Gongwu**, yet none compare to the **imperial edicts** now issuing from this **carved and resonant** sacred land.\n\nThe **ten thousand peaks of the \"Dark Metropolis\"** rise, their **heaven-piercing windows** planted in the **questions**. The **nine-tiered \"Xiao\" Platform** shines, its **radiance** brightening the **outer reaches of the \"Void Heaven\"**.\n\nThus, within the **inner halls**, a single statue was enshrined for the **Virtue/Power Lord Wen De** to honor the **Primordial Sovereign of the Beginning**, flanked by the **Two Sages**.\n\nIt mirrored the **wonders of the \"Fragrant Garden\"** and **recorded the rituals of the \"Empty Song\"**—near and far, all **returned in reverence**, and **humans and celestial beings** praised in awe. The **Dharma Wheel** turned eternally, the **great virtue/power** never faded.\n\nThe prefect, **Lord Wu of Lu**, **Master Li**, his name **Houde**, a **true person** of **ancient lineage**, his **clothing and cap** following the **old traditions**, was **divinely appointed** to distant branches, his **imperial garden** refining the **side shoots**. His governance followed the **Dao/Way of transformation**, his path sung in **folk hymns**. He **cherished trust in the Dharma**, his **virtue/power** never forgetting its **roots**.\n\nHis disciple, **Chen Yu**, from **tender years** served the **Dao/Way**, and even in **old age**, he did not tire of **absorbing the divine teachings**, attaining the **subtle essence’s** intent. In times past, he **answered celestial summons**, now entrusted with **divine commissions**. Today, he **oversees the construction**, further **elevating the hall’s grandeur**.\n\nHis disciple, **Wang Gui**, from **early years** stood **upright and resolute**, his **youthful reverence** for the **Dao/Way’s halls** known in **inner chambers**. His **actions** were guided by **principles**, his **words** left **traces of wisdom**. His **eloquent speeches** were **refined and profound**, their **meaning** clear and **resonant**.\n\nYu and the others, along with **near and far** fellow **Dao/Way** adherents and **elderly laymen**, declared: *\"The sun and moon revolve in cycles, their **fullness and waning** bound by fate. The **seasons pass in succession**, their **prosperity and decline** governed by the **Dao/Way**.

How **mighty** its **foundations**!\n\nIts **rituals** model the **Dark Garden**, its **glow** reflects the **eight directions**.\n\nThe **eaves** stack in **layered jade**, the **roofs** connect like **strung pearls**.\n\nAt dawn, the **sacred peaks** shine, the **lamps** illuminate the **divine abode**.\n\nThe **twisting paths** lead to the **fragrant stages**, the **converging shadows** meet the **strange trees**.\n\nThe **disturbing sounds** of **mortal craftsmanship** gather in **distant echoes**, the **shedding skins** of **serene transformations** respond in **far reverberations**.\n\nEach **year**, they **summon the nine-colored**, their **guests** drawn like **constellations**.\n\nThey **obscure the sun and moon**, their **depths** lost in **clouds and mists**.",

      "translated_text": "The Master then halted his steed at the Mysterious Gate,\npondering how to expound the wondrous intent.\nHe still followed the Sage as his abode in the thatched valley,\nserving as a disciple of the Fragrant Master for sixteen years,\nrising early and retiring late,\nlaboring without ceasing.\n\nAt dawn, he offered the turbid brew,\nat dusk, he partook the flowing nectar,\nfulfilling his duty without weariness,\nrelying on virtue without instruction.\n\nHe contemplated the Vermilion Palace and sought the Sage,\nheld the Purple Robe in mind to find the True.\nHis emotions wandered with spring waters and stones,\nhis sleeves unfurled for orchids and cassia.\nHe raised the nest of Master You to tame the crows,\nextended the palm of Master Zhuang to observe the fish.\n\nWhen the wind spoke in spring’s mountains,\nwhen moonlight shimmered on autumn’s waters,\nwhen the monkeys cried in perilous heights,\nwhen the tigers roared in secluded streams,\nhe never failed to awaken his thoughts in verdant reverie,\nand dip his brush to record his reflections.\n\nBy the time the Master reached maturity,\nhe devoutly received the scriptures and teachings.\nHe nurtured the Valley Spirit in the Mysterious Feminine,\nand roamed the Boundless Qi in the Yellow Palace.\n\nAt first, he sat beneath the Sage’s seat,\nlistening to *The Laozi*, *The Western Ascension*,\n*The Soul’s Treasure*, and *The True Person of the South’s Discourse*.\nUpon leaving, he immediately expounded them for others,\ncovering all Five Phases without omission,\nevery word preserved—\nhis arguments towered like the Pillars of Heaven,\nhis phrases aligned as sharp as the cleaving of Huo’s blade.\n\nThe Sage sighed and said:\n*\"My Dao has turned eastward—\nwhy single out Kang Cheng alone?\"*\n\nWhen the Sui Dynasty seized the map,\nscouting rocks and caves for omens,\nseeking the gifted and extraordinary,\nthe Sage proclaimed the Three Fragrant Masters and Seven Holy Ones—\nthen descended in silk mist,\nhurrying to the Bundled Capital.\n\nAt this juncture, the Master joined their journey to the Jing-Luo region,\nmorning by morning attending the humble court,\nevening by evening serving the bronze pool,\nentering and exiting the twin palaces,\nhis fame resounding through the Four Departments.\n\nHad he not embodied True Wisdom,\nhad his resolve not been as vast as the Empty Boat,\nhow could he answer the archers’ banners,\nor accept the summons of the silk edict?\n\nAt the time, he was urged to perform\nthe Dao of the Jade Pure and Mysterious Hall,\npreparing thick sacrificial meals,\ncarving jade for the broth and gilding the rice,\ndecorating the altar with fragrant offerings,\nspreading clouds as a quilt and brocade as a bed.\n\nWhen the Sui ruler’s expedition returned victorious,\nthe Master accompanied him in the Yellow Dragon procession,\nthe chariots triumphant in their homeward march to Luoyang.\n\nIn the eleventh year of the Great Business era,\nthere came an edict commissioning the Master\nto the twenty-four counties of Henan,\nto broadly seek out black-robed monks—\nthose with genuine virtue, extraordinary abilities,\ndiverse skills, praiseworthy conduct,\nor who could elucidate teachings with clarity,\nand those who mastered the Dao’s methods—\nand report their names to the imperial court.\n\nWith this imperial command,\nhe returned to his former dwelling.\n\nSoon after, the fiery destiny waned,\nthe Celestial Sovereign lost control,\nas the Yellow Scarves and Red Eyebrows\ngathered in rebellion, their malice rising.\nThe Green Forests and Blue Calves\nfollowed in their disorderly ranks,\ntheir insolence unchecked.\nThe passes were severed, and so he fled to sacred mountains,\ntraversing Tian Tai, Chìchéng, Sìmíng,\nTóngxiāng, Jīntíng, Cài Yōu,\nJǐnyún, and Ruòyě.\n\nRealizing that life is fleeting as a breath,\nknowing that a hundred years pass swiftly,\nhe adapted to the times—\nsometimes resting in stone chambers,\nsometimes lodging in humble inns with crooked branches,\nplucking osmanthus and orchids,\nsipping flowing waters in self-contentment.\n\nThe sun and moon lingered in his presence,\nand he immersed himself for another ten years,\nyet the black-haired folk suffered in flames,\nand the county magistrates had perished.\n\nThen, the Great Tang’s phoenix arose from Jinyang,\nits dragon ascended from Weishui,\nsweeping away the chaotic and rebellious,\nrestoring order to the southern lands,\nremoving the wedge and correcting the northern pole,\nholding the Purple Axis in reverence,\nbearing the Yellow Map in triumph,\ncalmly contemplating Heaven’s vast inundation,\nextinguishing the fiery Kun’s blazing flames,\nenclosing the sun and moon as shoulder windows,\ncultivating the Qí and Bó as a moat and pond,\nranking the jade tablets and bi discs in Chang’an,\nestablishing grand rites to align with Heaven and Earth,\nproclaiming sincerity in the pure temple,\nand composing grand music to harmonize with the sounds of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Master, having witnessed this flourishing civilization,\nwas moved to return by the call of his homeland.\nHe readied his carriage,\nadjusted his worn robes,\nleft Tian Tai behind,\nand entered the Earth’s Lung.\nHe entered the reporting gate to welcome the Sage’s procession,\nand wandered the outer precincts to pay homage to the True Person.\n\nThe Emperor Taizong, the Wénhuáng,\nwandered in spirit through the Boundless Pass,\nopening the Jade Capital in the Verdant Reaches,\nconcentrating his mind in the Faint and Obscure Realm,\nexpanding the Golden Gate in the Crimson Palace.\n\nThe Sage now shone his wisdom,\nthe Most Holy extended his boundless compassion,\nwhile the venom of private teachings spread far.\nYet the Master’s path of welcome was still incomplete,\nand he encountered the favorable wind of Mount Kāng.\nHe ascended to the subtle teachings of the Lìxié Village.\n\nAt that time, the Sage still held the legacy of the Zǐzé Forest,\nhis words as lush as the willow’s shade.\nThus, he dispatched disciples,\nfirst to restore the Master’s abode at the Er Tao’s former site.\n\nThis temple was built in the residence of the Xu Sage,\nwhere the True Person once dwelled,\nand was named □Zhūyáng.\nIn the Ming Dynasty’s reign,\nit was renamed Huáyáng.\nAccording to *The True Announcement*, Huáyáng\nis the name of the eighth of the Celestial Caverns.\n\nIts mountain rises in towering rocks,\nhidden from the sky,\nwith paths ascending into the clouds—\nwhere the refining takes place.\nIts base encircles the earth,\nits winding streams carry the wind,\nand its peaks extend far beyond.",

      "translated_text": "「With his dwelling bound by sacred groves,\nhe soared through the Nine Transformations to wander among the immortals;\nto the south, he controlled the Luo Fu,\nopening Five Passes to receive the Sage.\nTo the west, he connected with E Yao,\nextending far to the Xi Jin.\nTo the north, he shook the Tai Zong,\nflipping his crane-driving carriage to the hidden abode of the Spirit Sovereign.\nTruly, he was one whom the feathered guests lingered to visit.\n\nYet his former foundations lay in ruins,\nhis nearby halls overgrown with weeds,\nso the Master himself cleared the thorny fields and opened the grounds anew,\ncommencing this grand construction.\nWith reverence, he built the main hall,\nthree eaves and two bays,\nincluding lecture halls, ritual platforms, chambers, and gateways.\nHe planted fragrant osmanthus and cassia along the winding paths,\nso that their shadows darkened like clouds,\nand raised plum beams upon the celestial roads,\nso that their splendor blazed like morning mist.\nThe eaves extended like a duck’s flight, their calls ringing clear,\nthe phoenix-tiled roof stood solitary and lofty,\nthe joyful magpies ascended in pairs—\nhow much more than mere butterfly wings stirring the breeze,\nor the mortals’ refined appearances from their alchemy!\n\nYet the sacred light was easily accessible,\nwhy was the fulfillment of blessings so difficult?\nAgain, within the inner hall,\nhe reverently enshrined a statue of the Primordial Sovereign of Heaven,\neight feet in height,\nwith two Celestial Masters flanking him in attendance.\nThe divine bearing was solemn and dignified,\nthe sacred form subtle and refined—\nits countenance mirrored the moon’s luminous purity,\nits spirit captured the sun’s radiant brilliance.\nThe pillars gleamed with double hues,\ndisplaying the *Golden Scripture of Auspiciousness*,\nthe palms emitted tenfold light,\nthe *Jade Tablets of Good Fortune* shone like crystal.\nThus, the celestial nymphs of divine splendor\ncame in procession from the *Hall of the Radiant Fungus*,\nand the *Spiritual Deities of the Clouds*\ngathered at the *Fragrant Tower of the Morning Mist*,\ntheir attendance ceasing only with the day’s end.\n\nThe Master then arranged the emerald throne\nand fanned the mysterious winds,\nwalking the red steps\nto proclaim the myriad wonders.\nHe maneuvered the boat of compassion\nto rescue those in need,\nand raised the torch of wisdom\nto illuminate the unenlightened.\nHis benevolent influence matched the depths of the whale’s abyss,\nhis achievements surpassed the Five Tortoises of the *Kui Peak* in grandeur—\nOh, how vast and beautiful they were!\nIndeed, they were beyond praise.\n\nThe disciples traveled to renowned mountains and blessed lands,\nencountering true scriptures by chance.\nLater, they resided at the Hua Yang Cavern,\nwhere they meticulously copied the sacred diagrams and secret treasures\nof the Supreme Daoist Schools—\nthe *Dongxuan Sacred Patterns* and the *Dongxuan Divine Symbols*—\nand with utmost devotion,\nthey transcribed the *Zhongwei Models* and exhausted the *Ban Chui Regulations*.\nSealed within a quiet chamber,\nthey eternally safeguarded the mountain’s gateways.\n\nFrom youth to old age,\nthe Master always savored the scent of pine and wood.\nIn his lifetime, he conducted lectures and teachings,\nand all his offerings and charities\nwere recorded as merits and virtues.\nHe never failed to rescue the poor.\n\nIn the second year of the Qian Feng era,\nthe year of the Ding Mao,\non the first day of the eleventh month,\nafter completing his morning rites,\nhe turned to his disciples and said:\n*\"Last night, during the fifth watch,\nI seemed to be in a dream,\nand saw three men in feathered robes,\ntheir attire impeccable,\nholding tablets and scrolls,\nentering my chambers.\nThey declared that the Hua Yang Celestial Palace\nhad long evaluated my worth,\nand now appointed me as the Immortal Sovereign for Ten Thousand People,\nalso entrusting me with the oversight of the Celestial Officials.\n\nMoreover, your virtue and talent are pure and lofty,\nfit for this station.\nNow, we bear the heavy command to invite and welcome you—\nyou must depart without delay.\nI once dwelled in the Tong Wu Mountains,\nand already felt this calling in my dreams.\nThough I declined, I could not escape,\nand now must answer this summons.*\nThus, he admonished his disciples,\ninstructing them on the essentials of cultivating the Dao,\nthe scriptures and their practices,\neach receiving his final charge.\n\nOn the eighth day of the month,\nhe repeatedly asked for fragrant baths and purification,\nchanging his headgear and sash,\nand donning new robes.\nAt dawn on the ninth day,\nstrange incense filled the chamber,\nhis body upright and serene,\nthen suddenly dissolved into the void—\nin the age of eighty-eight.\n\nOn the seventeenth day,\nin the hour of Gui You,\nhe entrusted his spirit-tablet to a tree\nat the Hua Yang Temple,\non the western slope of Lei Ping Mountain\nand to the right of the tomb of Tao Zheng.\nAlas!\n\nThe Master’s virtue was as boundless as the Two Principles,\nhis emotions encompassed the Six Qi.\nFrom birth, he was a source of doubt and wonder,\nyet in his growth, he embodied the Rectitude of the Dao.\nHis center was yellow and harmonious,\nhis elixir-fields concentrated in form.\nThe White Phoenix soared in his spirit,\nand his discussions of Daoist texts in the *Hanlin Academy*\nwere as brilliant as the Spotted Bird’s flights in debate.\nHe analyzed profound truths in his lectures.\n\nHis body was one with the divine,\nhis nature aligned with the Dao.\nHe purified his heart along the Pine Path,\nand practiced austerity in the Cloud Roads.\nTruly, he was of the *Pengtiao* and *Qizhou* lineage,\nunited with the *Pengxian* in purpose.\nThe Five-Colored Mountains of the West\nwitnessed only the phantom of a child of the Dao,\nand the Eight Immortals of the Huai Nan\nwere but echoes of his great deeds.\n\nHis disciples—Dai Huigong, Bao Fangguang,\nHao Dewen, Wang Yuanyao—\nand over a thousand others,\nall of extraordinary talent and virtue,\ntheir voices rising above the *Qi Jian*,\ninheriting the teachings from the *Que Li*,\ndevoted to the Dao in the *Zi Wei*,\ngrieved as if their beams were shattered,\nmourned beyond the depths of *Lin Gu*—\nthey gathered the *Golden Hua* to bid farewell,\nand sought the *Jade Shu* to reaffirm their resolve.\nTime has passed like the sun and moon,\nyet his lofty teachings remain.\nWhen they saw his inscribed works,\nthey composed this elegy:\n\n**First Ode:**\nThe Perfect One needs no aid,\nthe Supreme Virtue is nameless.\nHis heart concentrated as the Vermilion Tortoise,\nhis spirit wandering in the Jade Purity.\nHe battled winds with the wings of the Peng,\nand struck water to cross the *Ying*.\nThe Green Stream bore his essence,\nthe Blue Sky echoed his fame.\n\n**Second Ode:**\nThe Mystic Pearl was already attained,\nthe White Clouds could be commanded.\nThe cow-eyed were left unharmed,\nthe *Harmful Moths* departed.\nThe Yellow Court held his #4 virtue,\nthe Purple Court honored his reputation.\nHe then turned the *Huan Xi* seal,\nand soon mourned the *Zhi Xu*’s dissipation.\n\n**Third Ode:**\nHe shone like snow upon the Kāng peaks,\ncongealed like frost at Gu She.\nThe *Peony* was bought with scattered rainbows,\nthe *Lotus* moved with shifting thunder.\nAt first, he seemed to bury his sword—\nthen the *Ling Wu* left its mark.\nHis words spread far and wide,\nyet his teachings were profound and vast.\n\n**Fourth Ode:**",

In his dwelling, he treated others as if they were sovereigns or kin; those who saw him were all moved, their emotions and dispositions subdued.\n\nIn his youth, he mastered **zhuànlì** (篆隶) script, yet when someone praised him as surpassing his father, he never again wrote a single character.\n\nHis compositions, including *The Records of Daoist Learning* (《仙學傳記_), filled in gaps and preserved what was lost. He also discussed the differences and similarities among the *Three Daos* (三玄), compiling *The True Scripture* (《真經》) and *The Phonetic Meanings of the Fundamental Herbs* (《本草音義》), all of which were meticulously detailed, without confusion, and exhausted the principles of learning—like a bell holding its resonance.\n\nLater, he studied under **Sìmǎ Jūn** (司馬君) of **Huágàifēng** (華蓋峰), who possessed **zhuàn** (篆) script treasures and imparted them generously. Afterward, he was addressed as *\"The Guest of the True Pure and Clear\"* (真玉清之客).\n\nThose who embraced **xūwú** (虛無) yet neglected practice were no different from the **Dao** (道) itself; those who relied on secluded mountains yet abandoned their boundaries were shallow in **virtue/power** (德). To receive the **Dao** (道) from afar, one ought to save others first.\n\nThus, he guided his disciples to ascend his hall and receive his profound teachings.\n\nThe **Master**’s **qi** (元氣) was unscattered, his **yáo tú** (瑶圖) empty yet luminous. His **ling** **hun** (靈魂) had long been enlightened, his brilliance ever concealed. His actions did not reveal their purpose, nor did his stillness imply closure; at the assembly of the ten thousand, he was as if at the gathering of the one, and the **Dao** (道) that could be named was not the **Dao** (道) itself. When the grassy **Móng** (蒙) sought him, he did not labor over words. He nurtured the **Dao** (道) of ultimate transformation, blending the **xūróng** (虛融) into a single mind. The mind, once transformed, reaches **learning** (學); learning, once transformed, attains the **Dao** (道). This harmony of virtuous **qi** (氣) has always been present, but only those who seek it truly see it. Therefore, he wore his **shū** **yī** (枢衣) and advanced without distinction of near or far, taking **Yuán Hé** (元和) as his model and cultivating the fullness of his **xìng** (性)—like autumn flowers leaning on layered cliffs or summer floods converging in rivers.\n\nThe **Master** forgot his own body yet showed kindness to all; auspicious omens often appeared, as if he were a common sight. Commoners and scholars alike consulted him, and he conveyed his meaning through expression alone.\n\nHe often ordered the **zhāng tán** (章坛) to close its **bìyuàn** (閉#3院), to select incense wood for ritual offerings, and to perform rites with utmost sincerity—all in this manner.\n\nOnce, celestial scriptures arrived in succession, and he was earnestly requested to honor them. The ministers and officials prayed for his blessings, and indeed, there was no month without their petitions. Eventually, the **Dao** (道) community saw him as the *True Uncarved Jade* (真璞), holding the treasure of benevolent frugality and returning to the **Dao** (道) of the **Xī** (羲) and **Huáng** (黃).\n\nTruly, my teacher’s teachings have reached their peak!\n\nIn the winter of the fourth year of **Dàlì** (大歷), he said to his disciples **Wéi Jǐngzhāo** (韋景昭) and **Mèng Zhǎnrán** (孟湛然): *\"I shall now follow the **Dao** (道) of transformation.\"* His **shén qì** (神氣) was tranquil, as if in the state of **zuòwàng** (坐忘). He was then eighty-seven years old.\n\nAs his **líng yún** (靈雲) descended upon the hall, he held his tablet as if alive. According to *The True Scripture* (《真經》), this was the mark of one who grasped the freedom of transformation and the profound mysteries of the Daoist path.\n\nHis disciples said: *\"The taste of the **Lìquán** (醴泉) is known only to those who drink it; the **Dao** (道) of our teacher is seen only by those who study it long. We wish to uphold the True Doctrine and demonstrate it to future generations.\"*\n\n**Tài** (泰) once wandered in the **Dao** (道), now dares to recount its profound winds.\n\nThis inscription reads:\n\n*\"In ancient times, there were those who bore strong names, their **yuánjīng** (元精) rare and refined. The **Yellow Emperor** (黃帝) left them behind; the **Master** (先生) obtained them. He wandered freely, yet always in harmony with the One. The true **xìng** (性) contained within him followed the same rule as **Tàiwú** (太無).*",
      "overlap_context": "ed about **Jin**ding (金鼎). He replied: *\"The **Dao**’s virtue/power is like the wind—if one raises it too hastily, it disperses. If one clings to its private aspects, they lose sight of the whole. The **Sage** (聖人) preserves the teachings, yet does not cling to life or indulge in desires, lest it appear as though striking the wind.\"*\n\nThe emperor was pleased and thus bestowed upon him the title **Xuanjing** (玄靜).\n\nNot long after, he declined due to illness and returned eastward to **Jùqū** (句曲).",

To avoid the **usurpation of Wang Máng** (王莽), he relocated to **Jìnlíng** (晋陵), thus becoming a native of the county.\nHis **great-grandfather** (高祖), **Wéndú** (文疑), served as **Attendant Officer of the State of Guì** (陈桂阳王国侍郎).\nHis **great-grandfather** (曾祖), **Róng** (荣), held the post of **Master of Ráizhōu** (皇朝雷州司马).\nHis **grandfather** (祖师), **Chǒng** (宠), retired in seclusion to pursue his aspirations, later settling in **Jiāngdū** (江都).\nHis father, **Xiàowēi** (孝威), was a scholar of ancient lore, refining the **Dao of Páng** (彭) and **Lǐng** (聘). He befriended **Zǐwéi Sīmǎ Liànshī** (天台司马炼师子微) as a layman, and his reputation for earnestness and prudence earned him the title **Mr. Zhèngyǐn** (正隐先生) among the people. His mother, **Wáng from Lángyè** (琅琊王氏), was virtuous and of noble character.\n\nAs a child, the Master exhibited extraordinary traits. His eyes alone sought out the *Classic of Filial Piety* (《孝经》), as if cradling it in his hands.\nFrom a young age, he favored quietude, studying and reciting the *Analects* (坟) and *Classics* (典).\nAt eighteen, he resolved to seek the profound mysteries of the Dao, and thus became a disciple of his fellow-county Daoist Master **Lǐ** (李), devoting years to his arts.\n\nIn the first year of **Shéndòng** (神龙), he was ordained as a Daoist priest for his virtuous conduct, residing at **Lóngxīng Guān** (龙兴观). He mastered the profound essences of the *Laozi* (《老》), *Zhuāngzi* (《庄》), and *Zhōuyǐ* (《周易》).\n\nWhen attending to funeral rites, he did not taste sweet flavors, and his diet consisted solely of accumulated barley.\nThe offerings of food and drink for the deceased were all prepared by his own hands, earning him the epithet *\"Destroying the bones, standing firm\"* (毁骨立). His kin could not help but mourn his asceticism.\n\nIn the seventeenth year of **Kāiyuán** (开元), he accompanied **Sīmǎ Liànshī Zǐwéi** (司马炼师子微) to **Wángwū Shān** (王屋山), where he received the **Sacred Scriptures of the Great Dao** (大法灵文金记), comprehending them in a single glance. He synthesized the keys of antiquity and modernity, elucidating their profound meanings.\n\n**Emperor Xuānzōng** (玄宗) recognized that the Master had uniquely inherited **Zǐwéi’s** Dao, and thus decreed that he reside at **Yángtái Guān** (阳台观) in **Wángwū Shān** (王屋山) to continue its teachings.\n\nAfter a year, the Master requested to return to **Mount Máo** (茅山) to compile and refine the Daoist scriptures.\nRepeated summons were all declined on account of his feigned illness.\n\nIn the winter of the fourth year of **Tiānbǎo** (天宝), the Emperor commanded imperial officials to deliver a sealed decree summoning him.\nUpon arrival, he was granted an audience in the **Forbidden City** (禁中), and whenever the Emperor sought counsel, he first underwent purification rites.\n\nLater, when the Emperor requested transmission of the Daoist teachings, the Master demurred, citing his foot ailment as an impediment to proper ritual observance, many times over. The Emperor, recognizing he could not be compelled, desisted.\n\nThe Master had once observed that the **Sacred Scriptures of Mount Máo** (茅山灵迹) were on the verge of collapse, and their secret records had largely scattered. He thus sought to return and restore them.\n\nThe Emperor specially granted him the former residences of **Yáng** (杨) and **Xǔ** (许) near **Zǐyáng** (紫阳), along with two hundred bolts of silk, two sets of Daoist robes, a censer, and imperial poetry. He also bestowed the title **Chú** (叔) upon him as a farewell gift.\n\nFurthermore, the Emperor prohibited hunting and fishing near the mountain, forbidding those who consumed meat or blood from entering without prior purification. Both public and private sacrificial rites were henceforth conducted without slaughtered offerings.\n\nThe Master arrived at the mountain in the autumn of the sixth year. That year, the **auspicious winds** (韶书) descended three times, bringing abundant moisture and luminous reflections across the cliffs and valleys.\n\nInitially, the mountain housed the **True Person of the Upper Clarity** (上清真人) **Xǔ Chángshǐ** (许长史), **Yáng Jūn** (杨君), and **Táo Yǐnjū** (陶隐居), who had personally inscribed their Daoist teachings. These sacred texts were passed down through generations, but during the chaos of war and upheaval, they were lost and scattered.\n\nThe Master, entrusted with the **auspicious winds** (韶), searched diligently and recovered their traces, presenting them to the Emperor.\n\nPreviously, when the Emperor sought the **Great Dao** (大法), he requested the Master as his teacher. The Master, however, remained modest and declined, citing illness.\n\nIn the spring of the seventh year, the Emperor again desired to receive the *Three Caverns True Scriptures* (《三洞真经》). In the third month of that spring, imperial officials delivered a sealed decree stating:\n*\"On the eighteenth day of this month, I shall humbly accept the scriptures.\"*\n\nOn that day, within the **Great Harmony Hall** (大同殿), he purified himself and prepared for the ritual. He then paid homage to the Master from afar as his **Degree Teacher** (度师), and the Emperor bestowed a single robe upon him to honor their teacher-student relationship. The title **Guāngjìng** (玄静) was bestowed upon the Master as a mark of distinction.\n\nThe Emperor further decreed that the **Scriptures of Mount Huáyáng** (华阳洞宫) be engraved upon stone as a memorial.\n\nThat summer, in the secluded place where he had previously cultivated the **Sacred Fungus** (芝), eighty-one stalks of **Lingzhí** (灵芝) emerged between pine and stone, their growth bountiful and strange. The Master, along with imperial officials, informed the **Immortal Sage** (灵仙) of this marvel, and the report was sealed and presented to the Emperor.\n\nIn the summer of that year, the Emperor also granted the Master two hundred households near **Zǐyáng Guān** (紫阳观), along with one hundred households each for **Tàipíng Guān** (太平观) and **Chóngyuán Guān** (崇元观). All were exempted from taxation to support the Master’s Daoist rites.\n\nIn the seventh month of that autumn, the Master was again summoned.\nUpon arrival, he requested residence in a Daoist temple to tend to his illness.\nIn the spring of the ninth year, he declined the summons and returned to his old mountain.\n\nThat summer, in the sixth month, the place where the **Sacred Fungus** (芝) had previously sprouted again produced over three hundred stalks, resplendent and extraordinary—visible to none but him.\nThe Master documented this phenomenon and reported it to the Emperor.\n\nThat winter, the Master was summoned once more and housed in a separate hall at **Zǐyáng Guān** (紫阳观).\nIn the autumn of the tenth year, the Master again humbly declined, requesting retirement. The Emperor composed a farewell poem to honor him.\n\nIn the eleventh year of **Dàlì** (大历), the Master, at the Emperor’s decree, gathered with his disciples—including **Wéi Jǐngzhāo** (韦景昭)—at the **Zǐyáng Guān** (紫阳观) to establish a **fasting hall** (斋院) on **Gāng Shān** (冈山), a separate mountain. His resolve was sincere and solemn.\n\nThat night, a **sweet dew** (甘露) descended upon the **Daoist altar** (仙坛) and the surrounding forest. The Master reported this to the Emperor, who specially praised the marvel.\n\nInitially, **Mr. Yǐnjū** (隐居先生) transmitted the *Three Caverns True Scriptures* (《三洞真经》) to **Master Shēngxiān** (升玄先生), who in turn passed them to **Master Tǐxiān** (体玄先生). **Master Tǐxiān** then entrusted them to **Master Zhèngyī** (正一先生), who finally transmitted them to the Master.\n\nThe Master was thus five generations removed from **Mr. Yǐnjū** (隐居先生), yet he fully inherited the **Great Dao’s True Teachings** (大正真法). Therefore, **Mount Máo** (茅山) became the ultimate source of Daoist learning for all under heaven.»",

      "translated_text": "Ah, how the distinctions of right and wrong may be reconciled! The self and the world are one, and life and death may be forgotten—awake and dreaming are as one.\n\nThus, how could the mind be confined to the realm of change?\n\nIn the winter of the tenth month, on the fourteenth day of the *Jiǎyǒu* year of the *Dàlì* era (775 CE), the Master departed in seclusion at the separate retreat of Zìyáng (紫阳). He was eighty-seven years of age.\n\nOn the eighth day of the twelfth month, thousands of disciples arrived for his funeral, their mourning cries echoing like the *fèngguān* (奉冠乌) birds. His remains were interred at the western edge of Léipíng Shān (雷平山).\n\nBy his final decree, a pine coffin, bamboo staff, wooden table, water bottle, incense box, and incense burner were placed within the tomb. His disciples, revering his noble intentions, faithfully upheld his frugal virtue.\n\nThe Master’s thoughts were pure and sincere, his conduct ancient and refined. He penetrated the essence of life and vitality, his learning surpassing both humanity and the cosmos. Thus, he wandered freely in the Dao, esteemed as a sage by kings, honored with the privilege of riding in a palanquin, and summoned by imperial decree—once as the teacher of the Yellow Emperor, now as the guide of the Emperor Xuánzōng. He also mastered cursive script and excelled in composition, once remarking on the *Běn Cǎo* (本草) that its principles were vital to life and death, too profound for mere tradition, and thus compiled *Yīnyì* (音义) in two volumes.\n\nHe regarded the *Lǎozǐ*, *Zhuāngzǐ*, and *Zhōuyì* (周易) as texts of purity and stillness, writing *Xuéjì* (学记) and *Yìlüè* (义略), each in three sections, and *Nèixuéjì* (内学记) in two, continuing the legacy of the Daoist sages. His words were precise, his meaning vast.\n\nIn his youth, the Master was skilled in seal and clerical scripts, but his cursive was especially exquisite. A guest once praised it, saying, *\"He surpasses his father.\"* Thereupon, he cast aside his brush and wrote no more.\n\nEmperor Xuánzōng commanded the recluse Wáng Yìng to urgently request the Master’s calligraphic rendering of the *Thirteen Classics*, to fill the gaps left by Yáng and Xǔ.\n\nThough the Master was adept in *yīnyáng* (阴阳) divination and alchemy, he did not consider these his greatest achievements. Though he mastered elixir refinement and longevity practices, he did not seek them as ultimate ends. Instead, he embraced the simplicity of the uncarved block (*sùpǔ*), savoring the subtleties of the Dao’s depths. Who but the most boundless sage could fully grasp this?\n\nIn the second year of *Jiānyuán* (760 CE), Zhèng Qīng (真卿), as Prefect of Shèngzhou and Military Governor of Zhejiang’s western circuit, revered the Emperor’s virtue and aspired to the mysteries of the Dao. He sent a special envoy to Máo Shān with a letter expressing his sincerity.\n\nThe Master had Wéi Liànshī (韦炼师) Jǐngzhāo (景昭) reply. Zhèng Qīng’s devotion was profound, inspiring his lofty aspirations. Yet though the Master was his revered teacher, the distance to the Celestial Bureaus was vast, and imperial duties kept him from lingering. He could only entrust his longing to the white clouds.\n\nIn the sixth year of *Dàlì* (771 CE), Zhèng Qīng was transferred from Línchuān to Hào Xīng, his hopes of retiring to Xiǎolǐng and honoring the Master’s legacy thwarted. Wandering through the prefectures, he carried only his reverence for the Dao, gazing at the forests in vain, forever bound by his unfulfilled vow.\n\nThen, Jǐngzhāo and Guō Hóng (郭闳), moved by the Master’s virtuous legacy, sought to inscribe his deeds on stone. They invited the Daoist Liú Míngsù (刘明素) to draft the text.\n\nZhèng Qīng, who had once exchanged visits with the Master’s disciples—Zhōng Lín Zǐyīn (中林子殷淑) and Wéi Qú Móu (韦渠牟)—and heard of his transcendent virtue, dared not presume to rank himself among the common folk, let alone the primordial chaos. His inscription reads:\n\n*\"Embracing the One, boundless and mysterious—\nThe foundation of humanity.\nThe Master wielded *qi* like a king, his spirit unyielding.\nHe unveiled the Dao’s profound truths,\nIlluminating the Gate of Mysteries.\nThus he became the Emperor’s teacher,\nAnd the Dao flourished in peace.\nSweet dew descended as an omen,\nSpiritual mushrooms sprouted as portents.\nThe noble respond in awe,\nHis lofty virtue spreads far.\nThe crane returns to the Celestial Hall,\nThe clouds depart from the Imperial City.\nIn retreat, he grows old,\nHis wisdom in action and stillness.\nVirtue knows no burden,\nThe Dao’s heart is ever constant.\nWhen the sun sets on the body,\nWho compares to seated forgetfulness?\nCarved stones mark his tomb,\nHis name forever fragrant.\nThough valleys shift and mounds decay,\nHis light endures ever brighter.\"*\n\nThis stele was erected in the summer of the fifth month of *Dàlì*’s twelfth year (777 CE), inscribed by the *Bóhǎi* (渤海) master Hào Chóngxiū (昊崇休).\n\nAt its head, the seal inscription reads: *\"Three Caverns of Zìyáng, Grand Master Jǐngzhāo’s Stele.\"* Flanking it are carvings of *Xiāo Shǐ* (萧史) and *Nòng Yù* (弄玉).\n\nThe inscription was composed by Lù Chángyuán (陆长源), then *Dàfū* (大夫), *Jiǎnshā* (检校) *Guózǐ Shìyè* (国子司业), and *Yùshì Zhōngchéng* (御史中丞), an *Kāiguó Nán* (开国男) of Hào Commandery (昊郡).\n\nThe calligraphy and seal were executed by Dòu Zhòng (窦众), then *Cháo Yì Dàfū* (朝议大夫), *Jiǎnshā Shàngshū Bīngbù Lángzhōng* (检校尚书兵部郎中), and *Shì Yù Zhōnggǔn* (侍御史上柱国).\n\n*\"He who governs the cosmos,\nSuspends the sun and moon,\nAnd first guides the myriad transformations—\nThis is none other than the Dao.\n\nHe who unites the sacred and divine,\nEncompasses all categories,\nAnd stands alone among the hundred spirits—\nThis is none other than humanity.\n\nThe Dao encompasses the undifferentiated origin,\nNurturing the myriad transformations.\nHumanity embodies purity and completeness,\nHarmonizing the hundred spirits.\n\nThus, humanity gathers blessings through the Dao,\nAnd the Dao attains fulfillment through humanity.\nThe unspeakable function manifests in creation,\nThe silent virtue permeates all life.\nDissolving in boundless spontaneity,\nTranscending the subtle and mysterious—\nHe blends with the celestial resonance,\nEnduring alongside the valley’s spirit.\"*\n\n**Zìyáng Zhēnrén Dàfāshī** (紫阳真人大法师), named **Jǐngzhāo** (景昭), with the courtesy name **Huáibǎo** (怀宝), was originally from Yánlíng (延陵), Dānyáng (丹阳).\n\nHis lineage traced back to **Zhuānxū Dà Pēng** (颛顼大彭), a descendant of the **Yú** dynasty as **Táotáng Shì** (陶唐氏), of the **Xià** as **Yùlóng Shì** (御龙氏), and of the **Shāng** as **Shǐwéi Shì** (豕韦氏), adopting the clan name from the state.\n\nHis virtuous lineage extended to his descendant **Mèng** (孟), who served as **Chǔ’s Grand Tutor** (楚太傅). His descendant **Xián** (贤) became **Han’s Chancellor** (汉丞相), and **Zhāo** (昭) entered **Wú** as **Shìzhōng** (侍中). His brother **Shèn** (慎) held the office of **Sīkōng** (司空). The Master was the sixteenth descendant of Sīkōng.\n\nWhen Sīkōng passed away, he was buried in Yánlíng, and his descendants settled there. His ancestor **Dàohuì** (道会) and father **Sīxì** (思戏) both cultivated simplicity in seclusion, their virtue and reclusiveness recorded among the immortals.\n\nThe Master’s mother, **Liú Shīfāng** (留师方娠), conceived under auspicious signs. From infancy, he displayed extraordinary talent, embodying the essence of *yuánhé* (元和) and the subtlety of *tàixuān* (太玄). Initially, he gained recognition through his mastery of *sùshū* (素书), aligning with the *Xúnxiān Guàn* (寻仙观) in Yánlíng. Later, he became known as *Dāntái* (丹台), residing at the *Sùmíng Guàn* (肃明观) in Cháng’ān.",

Therefore, **Mount Máo** (茅山) became the ultimate source of Daoist learning for all under heaven.»",

      "translated_text": "The Master, under the reign of **Xuánzōng** (玄宗) and **Guǎngchéng** (广成), sought the **Dao/Way** (道), savoring the **Divine Vitality** (神) of **Gūshè** (姑射). He let his mind rest in the realm of **congealed stillness** (凝寂), and his body repose beneath the **serene and pure heavens** (穆清). Thus, the Master attained the **feathered insignia and golden records** (羽仪金录), the **jade belt of the Precious Ones** (颉顽玉绳), and was renowned throughout the capital for two decades.\n\nThen, he declined the imperial court, yearning to return to his native lands, and once more affiliated with the **Tàipíng Guàn** (太平观) of **Máoshān** (茅山). During the **Tiān Bǎo** (天宝) era, **Xīng Xuánjìng** (兴玄静) received an imperial decree to perform meritorious deeds, constructing the **Zǐyáng Guàn** (紫阳观), where the Master resided.\n\nThereafter, in the **Alchemy Hall** (炼丹院), he transmitted the **Yellow and White Elixir** (黄素) techniques and perfected the **fasting and sacrificial rites** (斋醮). Divine clouds and auspicious cranes soared above the altar, while **ambrosial dew and sacred fungi** (甘露神芝) descended into his courtyard.\n\nInitially, the Master studied under the **Grand Master** (大法师) **Bāo Shìróng** (包士荣), who in turn had learned from **Bāo Fǎzhěng** (包法整), a **Daoist** (道士) of the **Chónghuán Guàn** (崇玄观). **Bāo Fǎzhěng** had been taught by **Bāo Fǎngguǎng** (包方广), a **Superior Adept** (上士), who had followed **Wáng Guǐ** (王轨), a **Daoist** of the **Huáyáng Guàn** (华阳观). **Wáng Guǐ** had been instructed by **Shēng Xuán** (升玄) **Wáng Yuǎnzhī** (王远知), and **Wáng Yuǎnzhī** in turn by the **Huáyáng Hermit** (华阳隐居) **Táo Hóngjǐng** (陶弘景).\n\nFrom the **Source of the Dao** (道源), descending through successive generations, the **Wayist teachings** (玄教) flourished. Those of the **Jade Chamber** (玉堂) and **Silver Enclosure** (银阙), as well as disciples under **feathered banners and hairy insignia** (羽盖毛旌), left no vacancy in their ranks, each era producing its own successors.\n\nThe Master’s conduct was in harmony with the **transcendent transformations** (玄化), and his wisdom aligned with the **divine creation** (灵造). What he possessed, all things could not fail to possess; what he lacked, all things could not fail to lack. Life and death were measured by the seasons, while fullness and emptiness were observed like the dawn and dusk of the cosmos. His **cloud-pearl belt** (云外虎头之佩) and **snow-lotus crane-feather robe** (雪中鹤氅之裘) marked his refinement, while he nurtured his children with **Daoist simplicity** (玄) even as an infant. His lineage traced back to **Comrade Yú** (仇公) and **Ancestor Huáng Tài** (黄太), his teachings passed down through **transmission and instruction** (传授), and his **elixirs and prescriptions** (服饵) extended his lifespan.\n\nThose who served him with **attendant staff and sandals** (侍杖屦) were drawn from the nearby **secluded regions of the Jiang-Hu** (江湖). Those who recorded his **scriptures and teachings** (经录) were akin to the **sages of the Mò Sì** (沬泗) era.\n\nFor three generations, he dwelled in the mountain halls. His **return to the divine** (还神) coincided with the passage of time, and his **silent spirit** (寂魄) mirrored the **cessation of all phenomena** (物故). In the **Chéngyuán** (贞元) year one, on the **Gǔmào** (癸卯) day, he **shed his mortal form** (委蜕) at the **Zǐyáng Daoist precinct** (紫阳之道场), his visage serene and his movements natural, at the age of ninety-two.\n\nOn the **Jǐyǒu** (己酉) day of that month, his **divine essence** (神) was relocated to the **left of the Mortuary Temple of Xuánjìng** (玄静先生寿宫) on the **western slope of Léipíngshān** (雷平山).\n\nHe transmitted his **Daoist arts** (道术) to **Sūzhōu** (苏州) **Lóngxīng Guàn** (龙兴观) **Daoist** **Gāo Dòngxū** (皋洞虚), who mastered the **marvelous techniques of Chōngxū** (冲虚) and followed the **mystical traces of Shàngzhēn** (上真). Thus, the **Way** spread among the **marketplaces of Liang** (梁市) and the **Huáyáng** (华阳) region.\n\nThe **Daoist** **Wéi Chóngxún** (韦崇询) oversaw the **fasting and sacrificial rites** (斋醮), maintaining strict **postures and rhythms** (俯仰节度).\n\nThe **Daoist** **Zhū Huìmíng** (朱惠明) managed the **scriptures and secret precepts** (法录经书), refining the **Daoist mysteries** (修真秘诀).\n\nThe Master compiled the **Register of the Immortals** (仙录), aligning with the **pivotal Daoist principles** (道枢). His **divine essence encompassed the Primordial Void** (神含混元), and his **virtue/power harmonized with the Pure and Undefiled** (德与纯粹). He **guided the uninitiated and communicated with spirits** (诱进草动，感通众灵), transcending the bounds of the world and rising above the **profane dust of life** (风尘).\n\nYet when he engaged with worldly affairs, his **Daoist essence mingled with the commonplace** (迹混俗尘), he **uphold loyalty and filial piety** (忠孝) to govern himself, and **demonstrated trustworthiness and righteousness** (信义) in his actions. His ways adapted to the times without conforming to any fixed **Daoist vessel** (器), for who could emulate his **constant Dao** (常道)?\n\n**Zhèjiāng** (浙江) **Shùxī** (束西) **Nóngdù** (节度) **Zhǐdù** (支度) **Pàn Guān** (判官), **Chéngxiào** (检校) **Shàngshū** (尚书) **Bīngbù** (兵部) **Lángzhōng** (郎中) and **attendant censor** (兼侍御史) **Fǔfēng Dòu Gōng** (扶风窦公) remarked:\n\n*\"The Master’s **Daoist essence** (道) was vast, his **meritorious deeds** (功) blending with the **boundless void** (混茫).

      "translated_text": "「The **Lingzhi in Dragon’s Clay** was reverently presented in succession—commoners and nobles alike, how could they do less than honor the **Count of Bright Clarity**, the **forbidden groves of Firewood and Mulberry**, or the **Tomb of the Willow’s Shadow**? Thus, auspicious clouds and sacred mists announced omens, while **Lingzhi** and **Yingzhi** blossoms displayed celestial favor. Yet, the **King of the Xiao Zhou**’s jade waters were sung in vain, and the **Han Emperor’s** rare orchids remained but a show of empty splendor.\n\nSince then, each age has seen its reverence renewed: eminent scholars and sages, ever casting off their old selves. **Cloud Pavilions and Feathered Canopies** often descended with divine grace, their deeds inscribed on **gold and stone**, their legends passed through song and verse.\n\nAlas! The four ages have cycled, as **Heaven’s Dao** fills and empties. Though the **Nine Breaths of Qi** endure eterniously, spanning **kalpas** to nourish their harmony, the **Three Stages of Manifestation** follow time’s shifts, revealing their brilliance or obscurity—this pattern will rise and fall with the **worldly fortunes**, ascending or descending alongside the **imperial destiny**.\n\nWhen **Red Clarity** had yet to dawn, there lingered still the sorrow of **idle halls**; but now **White Water** flourishes, granting the blessings of **highborn prosperity**. The **Emperor Gaozong**, like a **dragon bearing virtue**, planted his **meritorious shade**—he responded to the **unusual omens of the pivoting realm**, mirroring **Zhongtian’s** wondrous signs.\n\nAt **Ganpan**, he cultivated harmony in the **first year of the sixty-second cycle**; the **cook-officials** were appointed, and their merit shone in the **third month of the ninth year**; the **guest-halls** received counselors, and great transformations arose in his time. His **crimson arrows and Lu bows** were justly revered by all under **Heaven**.\n\nThus, he followed the **Way of Yao’s Mandate**, revived the **Xia’s Middle Prosperity**, and mended the **unfulfilled regions of the West and North**, aligning with the **southern kingly Qi**. He presided over the **Bright Hall**, greeting the **Grass Sovereign**, and gathered the **auspicious jade**, meeting with the **feudal lords**.\n\nHaving achieved stability and success, he grew ever more profound in his concerns. He rode in **chariots of the swift and the decayed**, not deeming the **yellow-roofed halls** as supreme; he ate lightly and wore coarse garments, his thoughts ever for the **people’s welfare**. He knew the **effortless perfection** of the **Dao** without failure, embodying the **highest virtue’s** non-virtue—his spirit focused on **Gushu Island**, upright and serene, his governance flowing naturally, his actions responding as needed. He cherished the people and upheld the law, revering roots and instructing farmers.\n\nHe laid aside arms and disbanded soldiers, heeding the warning that **good defense must guard against the dangers of war**; he kept his palace humble and his meals simple, fearing reproach for indulging in **popular desires**. Thus, he earned the **effects of myriad treasures**, the **three celestial luminaries** offering blessings—his influence reached far, his peace near. His achievements surpassed those of **King Shao Kang’s** radiant might, and his **true vision** outshone **Emperor Kaizong’s** founding deeds.\n\nNow the **current sovereign**, inheriting the **accumulated virtue** of his ancestors, follows the **natural Way**—to embody **effortless transformation** is **sainthood**, to wield **might without slaughter** is **benevolence**. He delves into **profound and subtle teachings**, upholding **modest brilliance** while embracing **unfathomable application**; he reveals the **hidden and obscure**, embodying **great capacity** to encompass the **boundless**.\n\nWhen he acts, he shields the people; he does not boast of deeds but values **wisdom**; in stillness, he refines governance, ever practicing **frugality** to encourage **sharing**. He hears of good as if struck by fear, always scrutinizing the **finest details of autumn hairs**; his **radiant bearing** shines forth, yet he never deviates from the **tiniest of righteous paths**.

      "translated_text": "The path to transcendence is not a single call but many—\nOne who is spiritually refined, his *qi* luminous,\nHis bones and markings divine—\nThis is bestowed by Heaven.\n\nOne whose heart is empty, his nature pure,\nHis virtue profound and vast—\nThis is rooted in his essence.\n\nOne who reveals truth and imparts teachings,\nIlluminating the near and distant—\nThis is achieved through diligence.\n\nThus, though his name be inscribed in purple and white,\nAnd his steps ascend the Yellow Court,\nHis deeds flow on, his blessings stored—\nThese must harmonize in unity.\n\nThen, the Master’s Dao—\nWas it not thus?\n\nThough his carriage departed without pause,\nAnd his ascent vanished with the sun,\nYet his lofty virtue may be recounted,\nHis enduring model remains among men.\nTo record it is the duty of the brush.\n\nDeng Jun, in reverence, now commits this to script.\nIn the eighth month of autumn, the year *Jìwèi*,\nRecorded by Xu Xian, the *Shangqing* True Person,\nChancellor and Calligrapher of Danjing.\n\nThe Chancellor, steeped in Dao,\nDwelling in spirit, ascending to the Nine Heavens—\nThough men may change, the Dan Well endures.\nHere, the valley’s prince is shot,\nCold springs gush forth.\nDividing the sweet nectar,\nThey nourish the fields of immortality.\n\nFrom the west I came,\nSeeking the True of Purple Yang,\nAs if loving the #13 Charm Tree,\nAscending to the Lu Hall.\nWith reverence, I carve the Green Talks,\nForever to remember the Silver Bed.\nAlas, for later scholars,\nTo hold this lingering light.\n\n**Record of the Lingbao Academy**\nComposed by Wang Qixia, the Purple-Garbed Daoist,\nAnd rebuilt by Xu Gong, the Celestial Master,\nVice Commander of the Daoist Army,\nGovernor of the Zhenhai Military Circuit,\nHolding the rank of Inspector-General,\nGuardian of the Secretariat,\nLord of Donghai.\n\nNow, the Lingbao—\nA secret name from the Empty Cavern’s Red Scriptures.\nIt expounds the natural order,\nBorn before Heaven and Earth.\nIts virtue is effortless, yet it nurtures all deeds.\nThus, the Most High establishes virtue,\nThe next establishes deeds.\n\nVirtue is the great origin of Heaven and Earth,\nDeeds bring benefit to the three realms.\nIf virtue nourishes the self,\nAnd deeds aid others,\nThen even slight actions,\nLike returning home,\nTransform the clamor of the world into quiet retreat.\n\nMoreover, the records and traces that remain—\nThere are extraordinary men,\nWho achieve extraordinary deeds,\nThus spanning ancient and modern times,\nTheir noble intentions unbroken.\n\nTeachings bound like brocade,\nWith upright Dao in service,\nKind and gentle in conduct.\nUnderstanding the world is wisdom,\nFinding joy in stillness is benevolence.\nHe once dwelled in Chang’an’s clouds,\nInitially relying on Heng Mountain,\nThen taking refuge here,\nCalmly suppressing agitation,\nDevoted to the Mysterious and Silent,\nSimple as uncarved wood—\nHis virtue moved Heaven itself.\n\nSuddenly, clad in embroidered robes,\nHe received the Nine Tributes,\nGuided by the Three Pure Ones’ path,\nThe phoenix descended in response,\nHis blessings unerring—\nThis was the accumulation of past merit.\n\nNow, those of later ages who follow the same path,\nSurely, it is our Lord.\n\nOur Lord, with his footsteps in virtue,\nSwimming in loyalty and sincerity,\nHis lofty virtue far-reaching,\nHis purity like jade’s chill—\nHis fame resounds like the *Ling* and *Shi*,\nHis halls echoing ancient traces,\nHis authority like the Dragon’s Pool,\nHis honors as vast as the Red Gates.\nHe righted the ruler with one counsel,\nBestowed upon us his path,\nHis judgments stern as iron,\nHis wealth as rich as cinnabar.\nHis wisdom arose before its time,\nHis Dao attained in a single moment—\nWith a bamboo whip, he transformed all,\nAnd with the *Sangfu* hymns, his governance spread far.\n\nHe said:\n*\"I have no desires, yet the people are simple,\nI act without doing, yet the people are transformed.\nFollowing Huang-Lao’s teachings, the Emperor’s reign flourished,\nExamining the origins, the Sacred Instruction was expanded.\nThus, he turned to the named capital,\nAnd planted blessings for the world.\"*\n\nThe Lingbao Academy was established by Tao Hongjing,\nMaster of *Zhenbai*, in the *Tianjian* era of the Liang.\nOriginally, it was called *Zhaozhen*.\n\nThe Purple Yang Observatory,\nOnce the Chancellor’s residence,\nLies between the Small Mao Ridge and Leiping Mountain,\nFacing South Zhong Mountain’s *Zhaochang*,\nAnd extending north to Liangchang.\n\nThe remaining peaks and valleys,\nLike stars encircling the pole,\nCannot be fully described.\n\nBefore this, the towering halls,\nLayered like the Milky Way,\nHoused the Three Caverns’ arcane texts,\nGathering the feathered guests of Danqiu.\nThe disciples—Zhou Xianjun and Zichang—\nDiligently cultivated here,\nCherishing the Dao’s winds,\nRefining their bodies with gold and stone,\nAscending on clouds.\n\nYet time passed, and the halls decayed,\nTheir wooden frames crumbling to dust.\n\nIn the *Taihe* era of the Tang,\nLi Gong, Marquis of Zanhuang and Grandee,\nOften visited, rebuilding the distant greenery.\nThe Daoist Master Sun Zhicheng,\nHis disciple, investigated the old site,\nAnd rebuilt the academy,\nRenaming it *Lingbao* as before.\n\nLater, war’s flames consumed its blessings,\nReducing it to ashes.\nThorns and brambles grew thick,\nLong grass and weeds overran it,\nFoxes and rabbits dwelled there,\nReeds and sedges choked the paths—\nUntrimmed for fifty years.\n\nQixia, though burdened by past merits,\nFrom youth onward, never ceased his devotion.\nThough he gained fame early,\nHe endured repeated wars,\nHis traces scattered,\nHis structures nearly lost—\nThe broken branches vanished into the void,\nFrom north to south.\nFortunate to rely on Dao’s transformation,\nHe revered this sacred ground.\n\nThus, he aligned his path,\nAnd with zeal, he labored—\nForgetting weariness,\nBuilding altars, planting pines,\nWeaving thatch for shelter,\nBinding orchids to wood,\nWishing only to retreat forever.\n\nSoon, he received the decree from the Prince of Qi,\n[Command to reside in] the Imperial Academy,\nServing in the court,\nBathing in imperial favor,\nElevated in rank,\nHis Dao refined,\nWearing the ceremonial robes,\nTwice entrusted with keys—\nBoth honored and refined.\n\nWhen our Lord took governorship here,\nThough afflicted by illness,\nHe humbly resigned.\nLord Guyin then donated a million in salary,\nTo rebuild on the old foundation,\nCreating new blessings.\n\nAt the time of receiving the command,\nHe strove day and night without rest,\nEver diligent, hoping to fulfill his duty.\nAlas, planning is difficult,\nWisdom lacks foresight—\nThough a tiger’s gaze is not for a single sparrow,\nYet the sparrow still chirps.\nThough the moon’s fullness is not for a single cloud,\nYet the cloud may obscure it.\n\nAh, the times!\nLogic does not always prevail—\nUnless the Platform illuminates the hidden,\nNearly all would be lost.",

traced back to **Huánglǎo**’s teachings,\nHis household upheld **Rú**’s refined traditions,\nBoth transcending worldly bonds like dragons shedding their nets,\nSoaring beyond mortal clouds—\nYet they prized only the **Heavenly Merit**,\nWhy seek earthly fame or official rank?\n\nFrom age eight, he wandered the **Xiancheng** mountain,\n*[Fragment: eleven characters missing]*\nHis thoughts already stretched toward the **Qingdu** and **Zǐwēi**’s distant splendor.\nAt nine, he left the home,\nAt twelve, he ceased taking grain.\nAt twenty, he visited **Héngshān**, seeking the hidden halls,\nWading through waters where darkness swallows the valleys.\n\nThe **Divine Sovereign** *[Fragment: eight characters missing]*\nSummoned him to serve as **威仪** and to gather scriptures across the land.\nEncountering the **True Ones**, he absorbed **Dānyáng**’s elixir essence,\nAnd **Shíjǐng**’s water-mother secret—\nThus he constantly drew upon the **flying roots** of immortality,\nAnd swallowed the **soul of the sun**, practicing in secrecy.\n*[Fragment: six characters missing]*\nHis dwelling was the **Kǔzhú** Grove,\nWhere he built the **Fēixiá** pavilion,\nPlanted twin **guì** trees beneath it,\nAnd rested there, listening to the distant echoes of **Jīnlíng**’s ruins.\nThe **Dao** flourished in the **Sānmiáo** grove,\nAnd rippled through the **Sìxǔ** regions.\n\nFrom **Huáyáng** *[Fragment: seven characters missing]*\n**Táo Yǐnjī** passed the **Shēngxiān** tradition,\n**Shēngxiān** transmitted to **Tǐxiān**,\n**Tǐxiān** passed to **Zhēnyī** Master,\n**Zhēnyī** Master taught **Liánhuáng**,\nAnd **Liánhuáng** finally merged with **Zǐyáng**—\n*[Fragment: five characters missing]*\nReaching from **Shénnóng**’s village,\nSouth to **Zhūlíng**, north beyond **Báishuǐ**,\nInstructing over three thousand souls in his halls.\n\nNearby officials and governors,\nTransformed by his teachings, sought his counsel—\nYet suddenly they found him reclining in meditation,\n*[Fragment: five characters missing]*\nHidden like a crow in flight, approaching without warning,\nHeld in high esteem by the age,\nMany such tales existed.\n\nAt the start of the **Tiān Bǎo** era,\nHe was summoned by **Dānyáng** to the **Liúfèng** halls,\nWith lavish gifts to bend **Qū**’s will,\nAnd to record the transmission at **Sōngshān**’s **Shùjīng**—\nThe **Great Tang** *[Fragment: two characters missing]* Palace.\nThree entreaties were made, yet he firmly declined,\nRefusing to leave his retreat.\nBut soon the imperial edict arrived, commanding his presence—\nReluctantly, he obeyed.\n\nUpon entering the palace, he altered the **ritual norms**,\nGreatly transforming the capital’s customs.\nYet like the **Hǎiwū** feasting on **Zāng Wén**,\nOr the **Yuánzhū** tearing at **Zhōugōng**’s robes,\nHis heart yearned for departure while his body lingered—\nHe feigned illness to bid the Emperor farewell,\nAnd fixed a date to leave the court.\n\nAs he prepared to depart, he composed his own elegy:\n*\"The gods now summon me, yet I am no worldly burden.\"*\n\nHe entrusted his disciple **Hú Qìwù**,\nWho carried him on a **píngjiān** palanquin,\nReturning his remains to the ancestral soil.\nNobles and ministers saw him off to **Lóngmén**,\nAnd into **Yèxiàn**’s precinct #16.\n\nAt **Wáng Qiáo**’s temple,\nHis gaze seemed to linger—\nThen peacefully, he ascended.\n\nThe **heavenly fragrance** guided his **Dao**,\nHis body light as air, his robes empty.\nWhen the **Tàishōu** of this prefecture,\n**Kāi** by the **fānhuá** at the suburban shrine,\nThe heavens trembled, the earth roared—\n*[Fragment: four characters missing]*\nHis face radiant as life,\nTen thousand daily witnesses,\nAll stunned by the spectacle.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the tenth month of that year,\nHe was buried at **Xīnsōngshān** within the **Guōshù** walls,\nHis age sixty-two.\n\nThe Master held vast **prong** and brilliant **light**—\nHe did not concern himself with trifling matters;\nHis writings were never fully exquisite,\nYet his teachings carried the force of **crashing clouds**,\nHis compositions were not the work of long practice,\nYet they stirred even **dragon-carved** masterpieces.\n\nIn life, he illuminated the **cosmos** without a trace,\nIn death, he dissolved into the **void** like a cicada’s molt.\nWas it not *[Fragment: eight characters missing]*\n\nThere was a local monk, **Zhēnqiàn**,\nWho admired his talent and **virtue**,\nAnd asked me to compose this **inscription**.\nI, having exchanged **Dao** with **Zǐyáng**,\nFilled with discussions of **substance and emptiness**,\nUnderstood nine-tenths of his essence.\n\nHis disciples, **Yuándānqiū** and others,\nAll longed for his **luanfèng**’s noble bearing,\nAnd imagined his **zhūyù**’s luminous presence—\nSweeping away the dust of mortal months,\nPraising his **Dao**’s immortal winds,\nEngraving this stone to immortalize his **virtue**,\nSo that with this mountain, his name shall endure.\n\nThe words are as follows:\n\n*\"Virtuous was the **Dao**ist Sage,\nSixty years old when he transformed.\nShine, **Zǐyáng**!\nHe knew how to ride the times like a **dragon-snake**,\nAnd regarded life and death as mere **day and night**.\nThe strong may grasp him to hasten toward the **effortless**,\nYet decline and fall must all return to **nothingness**.\nOnly his **original spirit** remains unquenched,\nPure and settled in the **Qingdū**’s celestial expanse.\n**Yánlíng** has passed, **Zhòngní** sighs in lament.\nGreen the **sōng** and **wú**,\nScattered the **shān yú**’s peaks.\nEngrave this stone to praise his **virtue**,\nLet his name resound through the **Eight Regions**.\"*",

Or was it also to return to the roots, to nurture the virtue/power that would shelter all under heaven?\n\nThus, she contemplated the Three Pure Ones, mused upon the Nine Immortals, bowed to the adorned jade scepter, and admired the pendant of the Dao. The Southern Immortal appeared faintly yet with eager anticipation. The Western Mother seemed to manifest in leisurely observation. The responses of the *Pangmi* [膏沐] were revealed day by day, and the accumulated merit progressed year by year. Truly, the Dao can be learned, and the Way is not an empty pursuit.\n\nYet, still mindful of her own incomplete refinement, she had not yet reached the source of the Way. She heard that the **Wuzhu Yuanjun, Wei the Lady of Southern Peak**, in the year *Xingning Jiazi* of the Eastern Jin (349 CE), on the *Xiaoyou* [小有] day of the *Qingxu True Person*’s teaching by the *Xiaohao Tianwang*, received the *Upper Clarity Great Cavern Treasure Scripture* and passed it down to the *Donghua True Person* Yang Jun of Mount Mao, and later to the *Upper Clarity Dao Marshal* Xu Changshi.\n\nSince then, the sacred lineage of the source continued, inheriting the traditions of Huayang, extending the branches of the Dao, and spreading its fragrance across the world. Now, by imperial decree, the *Zhaoying Official of the Jade Clarity* Suong Miao Dasheng Huangfu Xiji and the officials Wang, Wei, and Wen were commissioned to study the margins of Yang and Xu’s teachings. They obtained the *Upper Clarity Three-Grade Divine Scripture*, the *Jade Clarity Hidden Writings*, the *Nine Clarities’ Secrets*, the *Golden God’s Two Tigers and Eight Scenes Jade Record*, the *Imperial Ancestor’s Jade Taboo and Yuan Shi Genealogy*, the *Flowing Gold Fire Bell*, the *Returning Chariot’s Complete Dao*, the *Three Primordials’ Jade Inspection*, the *Nine Phoenix Sacred Scriptures*, the *Purple Text and White Belt*, the *Taixi Yellow Scripture*, the *Guile Palace’s Lingfei Record*—ten volumes in total—and fifteen *Golden Immortal Jade Horse Certificates*.\n\nAccording to the prescribed rites, they prepared the *Golden Dragon*, *Jade Fish*, *Golden Ram*, *Silver Crow*, *Green Silk Golden Button*, *Cloud Brocade Phoenix Pattern*, *Bixia Waving Dust Silk*, *Red Seal Mortuary Silk*, the *Four Rectangular Clear Mirrors*, the *Jingzhen Sacred Sword*, the *Five-Colored Silk Upper Clarity Daoist Robes*, and all ceremonial offerings—none were omitted.\n\nFirst, envoys were dispatched with secret petitions to Southern Peak, conveying the message to the Wuzhu Yuanjun. In silence, she assented to the divine intent.\n\nNext, the **Inner Palace Attendants** Kang Congzheng and Jiang Deyong of the *Western Palace Supply Office*, along with the *Right Street Vice Dao Master* Li Zhishun—who oversaw the *Jade Clarity Zhaoying Temple* and managed the *Left and Right Street Teaching Gates*—the *Suongzhen Dasheng* Shi Zhizhang, the *Left Street Overseer* and *Shouning Guan Abbot* Mingzhen Dasheng, the *Jade Clarity Zhaoying Temple Vice Director* and *Xuanjiao Dasheng* Zhou Suiliang, the *Jade Clarity Zhaoying Temple Abbot* Suongmiao Dasheng Huangfu Xiji, and the *Co-Abbot* Suongmi Dasheng Xue Qinghe—were commissioned to present the *Blue-Worded Petition on Yellow Silk* and perform the rites in person.\n\nAt the **Chongxi Observatory of Mount Mao in Jiangning**, they constructed the *Upper Clarity Yellow Altar*, presided over the *Jade Record Dao Ritual* for seven days and nights, and conducted *360 sessions of the Great Fast* during the day. Following the rites, they held a *Three-Day Thanksgiving Dao Ritual* and a *Grand Fast for All Mountain Daoists and Female Immortals*. They also cast the *Golden Dragon Jade Tablet* and *Golden Ring Jade Fish* into the *Huayang Cave*, *Yan Cave*, and *Jinshan Water Palace*, thereby paying homage to the Seven Saints and expressing sincerity to the Nine Clarities. Thus, the rites of transmission and reception were fulfilled, and the rituals of master and disciple were complete.\n\nOn the day of the ritual’s commencement, the sacred crane descended to greet beneath the feathered canopy. As the altar was erected, the clouds gathered afar in the layered heavens. The morning dew inscribed the true scriptures, and the offerings were presented with reverent sincerity. The orchid incense burned brightly, and the jade moon gathered its light.\n\nThe hundred spirits, ordered and refined, manifested auspicious signs. The Five Peaks’ guardians stood vigilant, offering blessings. At midnight, a sacred wind swept through, and auspicious rain fell. In an instant, the Milky Way shimmered, and the stars blazed like scattered jewels. It was said that the Wind Lord swept the altar, and the Rain Master sprinkled the feast—how could it be otherwise?\n\nWhen the day of transmission arrived, the radiance of the *Nine Xias* flowed like light, dazzling and concentrated. The *Three Pure Ones’* misty qi drifted ethereally in the sky. The wind gathered in awe, the rainbow banners gleamed, and the ritual movements seemed to float. All spirits stood in solemn reverence.\n\nAt the moment of dividing the golden contracts, a white crane circled above the altar, and crimson clouds swirled in the mountains. The osmanthus wind enveloped all, and the sacred fragrance permeated the wilds.\n\nThough the myriad wonders of the Dao have many paths, learning follows an order; though the most sublime mysteries have no fixed method, responses require no delay. This demonstrates the Empress Dowager’s profound sincerity.\n\nThe talismans were reverently received, the spirits and humans aligned in harmony, and the Dao’s mysteries were fulfilled. Without the accumulated virtue of countless eons and the fruit of lifelong aspiration, who could attain this?\n\nIt is known that a good beginning ensures a beautiful end. If one plans with the Dao, what need is there for concern? Thus, the *Eight Scenes of Flying Xias* will gather in celestial feasts, the *Nine-Colored Phoenix’s Brain* and the *Ten Refined Waters* will be offered daily without end.\n\nIn reverence for the Holy Thought, the sacred texts were treated as if they were the most confidential of secrets. This was to glorify the Celestial Sovereign, to safeguard the True Master, to firmly establish the ancestral Dao for ten thousand generations, to bestow triple blessings upon the people, and to forever quell warfare, so that all might share in prosperity and longevity.",

      "translated_text": "---\n\nIn the realm of the Daoist tradition, there are teachings of purity, tranquility, and boundless void, and doctrines of returning to the True and embracing simplicity. Later generations who took delight in its ways expanded upon these themes, thus arose the dissemination of esoteric scriptures and hidden precepts, the illumination of the Celestial Capital and Sacred Isles, the cultivation of the Three Clouds and Eight Sceneries, and the gatherings of the youthful immortals and the Broad Cold. From the august sovereigns to the humble subjects, all drew upon its transformative power, as recorded in the *Yi Zhuan*. Initially, Emperor **True宗** (Zhenzong), having laid down arms and embraced peace, devoted himself to literary and cultural pursuits, ascending Mount Tai, offering tribute to the Earthly Sovereign, visiting the Celestial Precincts, and erecting the Sacred Hall, striving to unify the imperial rites and emulate the grandeur of former dynasties.\n\nAt this time, the Master held the weighty office of **Grand Marshal and Chancellor**, enjoying the highest favor of the winds and clouds. Alongside a few senior statesmen and eminent scholars, he both adorned the imperial designs within and deliberated on scriptures and rites without. Employing the **elixir of refinement** and the **award of inner nourishment**, he relied on precedent to establish his course and aligned with the humility of the Dao to ensure his decrees were carried out.\n\nWhen it came to inspecting the jade tokens of the sacred mounds, sitting upon the tapestry mats of the **Sui** (Zui) region, patrolling the nearby prefectures, and presiding over the grand altars for ritual offerings, all adhered to the secret records, and his diligence shone forth. He led the **Three Caverns** rites before the Eight Palanquins set out, and also took part in the ceremonial escort.\n\nIn the year of the **Tiger (丙寅)**, he received celestial blessings, revering and honoring ancestral achievements. The Five Sacred Mountains were elevated in title, the numinous springs bore their fruits, and the sacred precincts were expanded in splendor, the hallowed legacy made manifest. The Master was again entrusted with the role of **Imperial Envoy**.\n\nHe gathered the **Sacred Hair** (Hao) attendants and the **abundant scriptures**, selecting the **mirror of ages** from the past and the **rectangular measure** of the future, and was once more commissioned to oversee them.\n\nWith the **mysterious and primordial laws** of Dao, he contributed to the harmonious gatherings, encompassing the essence of lofty peaks and the flow of imperial prosperity. Encountering the flourishing era of the **Sacred Reign**, he obtained the sequence of discussions, and thus selected those scholars who were well-versed in its teachings, examining and rectifying them with meticulous care. The treasures hidden in the **Sacred Mountains and Caverns**, the **golden tablets and jade scriptures**, were all subject to his revisions, concluding without error or discrepancy.\n\nEndowed with innate purity, he furthered the **Sacred Court’s** harmonious assemblies, wandering in the realm of **clustered mists and grand effulgence**, reciting the **melodic verses of Broad Cold**. In dreams, he roamed with **Red Pine**, and in waking moments, he indulged in the **elixir of golden ladle**. Occasionally, he met with the **True Worthies**, engaging in profound discourse on the **wondrous pivots** of the Dao. Thus, he secretly aspired to ascend on clouds, transcending the mundane and departing from the common folk.\n\nWhenever he emerged during moments of rest or on auspicious days, he would screen out worldly affairs and diligently perform the **ritual of exorcism and purification** (挣醮). The altars were solemnly constructed, the **silken banners** fluttered in the breeze, the **dust of the world** did not dare intrude, and the **sacred visions** seemed to resonate in the air. Wrapped in fine wool, he rested for long hours, accumulating his **qi** and forgetting weariness.\n\nIn the year of **Renxi (壬戌)**, he was assigned the **imperial seal** of **Miling** (秣陵), and his heart yearned for this sacred mountain, which lay close to the capital. Soon after, he received an imperial decree, extending his commendation, and was directed to visit the **numinous soil** of the mountain, lingering in its **auspicious domain**. His spirit was at ease, and he drifted in forgetfulness of return.\n\nA recluse named **Juzhi** (朱自英) dwelled in the fertile caves of the mountain, his abode changing with the years. The Master took pleasure in his simple and unadorned ways, as if they were a **kindred spirit of stone**. In the second year of his return to court, the recluse’s reputation had spread.\n\nHe was summoned to the capital, where the Master hosted a grand banquet and engaged him in intimate conversation, far beyond the ordinary. When the recluse returned to the mountain, the Master again made arrangements for a future visit to his **cave-dwelling abode**, their correspondence marked by deep reverence and mystery. **Juzhi** (朱自英) was astonished by this.\n\nA few months later, the Master passed away, leaving behind words that echoed his intent: to build this **sacred structure** here. The total expenditure from his private funds amounted to **150,000**, with no additional contributions from the state.\n\nSubsequent imperial decrees allowed **Juzhi** (朱自英) to come and go as he pleased, all in accordance with the Master’s original intentions.\n\nAccording to the *Zhenzhuang* (《真诰》), the **Sententious** (句曲) land is the **Lung of the Earth**, with fertile soil and pure waters, known as the **Hua Yang Sacred Cavern** (华阳洞天), capable of **transcending the world and nurturing the people**, untouched by the **Three Calamities**. It further states that those of **utter loyalty and filial piety** would first receive **sacred commissions**, then ascend to the ranks of the **Celestial Worthies**, with their **ascensions and descents** recorded in the **registers of the dark and luminous**, akin to the **appraisal of human merit**.\n\nThus, the Master’s devotion to this **lofty peak** and his reverence for its **wondrous symbols** were not in vain.\n\nIndeed, he emerged during the **Age of the Virtuous Sage** (应贤运), ascended to the **highest echelons of power**, and rendered great service to his time. His **virtue and power** were profound, and his **achievements and influence** vast. Without **embracing the numinous qi**, how could he have **aligned with the august worthies** and fulfilled his **grand mission**? Without **harmonizing with the sacred records**, ascending to the **true stages of immortality**, how could he have **manifested the vigor of the Great Peace**?\n\nHis character matched these earlier accounts, and their **mysterious resonance** was confirmed.\n\nAh! To **ride the winds of time**, **striving in both martial and literary pursuits**, **holding the reins of governance**, **revering the sovereign and sheltering the people**, **exhausting his wisdom and virtue**, **upholding the balance of the Dao**, **unshaken by the controversies of the age**, **radiant and awe-inspiring**, and to **end his days in glory**—then, to **shed the mundane and ascend**, joining the **Xianmen** (仙门) and **Yueye** (雇佺) **adepts**, meeting them at the **boundaries of mist and vapor**, was this not a grand and splendid fate?\n\nIndeed, his wife **faithfully upheld the imperial mandate**, never forgetting to **pursue and honor** him. His son, **Yanliang** (寅亮), **Chancellor of the Palace**, **wholeheartedly assisted** in completing the **victorious construction**, ensuring his **exemplary legacy** would endure and forever shine in history.\n\nIt is said that **Chen Fu** (陈辅), a **disciple of the early years** who frequented the Master’s **abode of literary pursuits**, was entrusted with **commissions for writing**, and his works were inscribed upon **gold and stone**. Thus, he accepted the **honor of the imperial appointment**, though he was unworthy of such grandeur.\n\nThe Master bore the surname **Wang**, given name **Qinruo**, and courtesy name **Dingguo**. His wife bore the surname **Li**.\n\nThe lineage and official records of the Master’s **native village and clan**, along with the **sequence of his ancestral offices**, are inscribed in the **historic annals** above and **engraved in stone** below—these details are known and thus omitted here.\n\nThis inscription was made in the **second year of Regency** (庆历二年), the year of the **Tiger and Horse** (壬午), on the **twentieth day of the tenth month** (乙卯).\n\n**Mengzi Xuan** (孟子宣), **Judge of the Daoist Temple** at **Buzheng** (句曲) and **Superintendent of the Observatories**, granted the **purple robe**, and **Leiping Hu** (雷平胡恢), **Superintendent of the Daoist Temple**, inscribed the **stele** with their brushes. **Lugong** (陆绛), a **Junior Official** and **Guardian of the Juren County** (句容县尉), was responsible for **overseeing the construction and erection** of the stone.\n\n**Stele of the 23rd Generation Grand Master of Upper Clarity, Master of the Great Cavern, Miao Xiansheng** (幽光显扬) **of Jianyuan Temple** (乾元观妙先生) **at Mount Mao** (茅山).\n\n**Chen Fu** (陈辅) of **Cloudyang’s Southern Suburbs** (云阳南郭) **crafted** the stele, while **Cai Reng** (蔡仍), **Scholar of the Western Mountains of the Seven Prefectures** (七闽西山), **wrote and inscribed** the epitaph.\n\nThe Master bore the surname **Juzhi** (朱氏), given name **Ziying** (自英), and courtesy name **Yinzhi** (隐芝), hailing from **Juyang** (朱阳里) in **Juqiu** (句曲).",

      "translated_text": "The Master was eight or nine years old when he tended cattle in the **Goudian Village** (郭干村). The other boys rolled up reeds to make whistles and played with them, cracking their whips and driving the cattle. The Master declined to join, and the herdsmen laughed at him. The Master smiled and said, *\"How is it that you ride oxen, yet cannot ride a crane?\"* Slowly, he drew a flute from his sleeve, split a bamboo stalk, and a crane descended from the sky, dancing in the air. The Master mounted it, but the crane soared and he fell. The herdsmen gasped in alarm.\n\nFrom that time onward, he followed the herdsmen, and often summoned cranes. Some warned that this was an omen of misfortune, so his parents abandoned him to the Dao. He became a disciple of **Master Zhu Wengji** (朱文吉) at **Yuchen Temple** (玉晨观). His studies were diligent, and though he was enrolled in the **literary register**, he would read a text, close the book, and declare, *\"I am familiar with it.\"* His teacher, though unable to match his mastery, marveled at him.\n\nAt eleven, he was ordained as a Daoist. His celestial bearing and refined bones already set him apart from the world. Though born in the countryside, he had never seen Confucian classics or Daoist scriptures, yet when asked about burning incense and reciting the **Six Classics**, the **Hundred Schools**, and the **Three Vehicles and Thirty-Six Divisions**, he spoke fluently without pause. Elders from afar, well-versed in learning, sought his presence, eager to behold his countenance.\n\nThe Master sat alone in a chamber, eyes closed, reciting texts from memory. Those who listened found not a single word omitted. As he grew older, he composed essays with effortless grace, excelling particularly in **elegant verse** (风雅). His words were sharp and profound, like the resonant tones of an empty void.\n\n**Ma Gong** (牧马公), **Bright** (亮), of **Jinling** (金陵), sent an official with a letter, which the Master set aside without reply. His teacher, fearing offense, confessed his inadequacy, but the Master said, *\"No, you have honored me.\"* Thereafter, he traveled with **Master Zhang Shaoying** (张炼师绍英), scaling **Jijin Peak** (积金峰) by clinging to vines, and residing in the **Tian Shi Altar** (天市坛) and **Ronghuo Hall** (宠火院).\n\nThe two withdrew from society, their bodies growing gaunt from fasting on **stardust** (沆尘), and they pursued the **Three Manifestations** (三景). They practiced the **Yili Dangpei Method** (仪璘当佩之法) to hasten their lightness of being. Soon, their outer chambers were filled with visitors, and the Master turned to Zhang, saying, *\"What is this? You have brought so many to my doorstep—do you not fear it is too much?\"*\n\nZhang replied, *\"Do not worry. People will soon tire of you. If you were to seek fame in the world, there would surely be those who would not tolerate it. Why bother traveling?\"*\n\nThe Master said, *\"To stay or to go—each follows its own path. Why must they be the same?\"*\n\nThus, he would ascend the altar by day and cross the river by night, intending to pay homage to the **Primordial Origin** (混元) at **Hao She** (毫社) and to greet the **Celestial Master** (天师) at **Qingcheng**.\n\nAs he passed through the **Sword Gate Pass** (剑门) and journeyed westward, he encountered an old man with a long beard, white hair, and piercing eyes like a calf’s. The old man sat cross-legged and demanded, *\"Young man, whence do you come?\"*\n*\"From Huayang,\"* he replied.\nThe old man asked again, *\"And where are you bound?\"*",

      "translated_text": "The Master said, *\"From Shu.\"*\n\n*\"In Shu, what do you seek?\"*\n*\"The Great Elixir.\"*\n\nThe old man cast his head back and laughed aloud, *\"Young man, have you not heard of Tao the Hermit of Yinxu? He was a man of worth! After five refinements, his elixir still did not manifest, and only then did he utter his three-day lament over fleeting fame. Thus, he never achieved the White Day’s soaring ascension, but instead followed Gubao and left.\n\nAs for you, your foundational Dao is not yet complete, your Way only partially attained. If you do not **withdraw and conceal your luminous virtue** (潜晦光曜), they will **brandish you with benevolence and righteousness** (桁扬汝以仁义) and **mutilate you with rites and music** (劓刖汝以礼乐), making you a spectacle for both Heaven and the people—truly lamentable!\"*\n\nThe Master said, *\"Cast me into the depths of a cavern, and I shall reveal my fate.\"*\n\nThe old man then pointed and gazed into the distance, *\"The Hermit told me: seven hundred years hence, a child of virtue shall emerge from Maoshan. Surely this is your destiny.\"* He then recited the *Precepts of the Hidden and True Hermit* (登真隐诀) and commanded the Master to close his eyes. *\"Hold my staff firmly.\"* Suddenly, the Master felt a brush against his feet, opened his eyes, and found himself seated beneath Qingcheng Mountain. He then **silently performed** the Nine-Turned Golden Cauldron (金鼎九转) and the Flying Essence Sword Method (飞精剑法).\n\nWhen the matter was concluded, the Master said, *\"My flesh-born body and eyes of mortal sight cannot recognize your venerable self. Another day, I shall come again—like the shadow of a mountain at the foot of the valley—is that acceptable?\"*\n\nThe old man replied, *\"The world knows me as Chen Tiejiao; that is I.\"*\n\n*\"In years past, the late Emperor Taizong sent me to seek the elixir beyond the seas, but there was only Danji Anqi’s lingering delay—thus, I missed the chance.\"* He finished speaking and vanished.\n\nThe Master left the pass, intending to continue his journey eastward. Yet, he reflected that the *Daoist Canon of the Three Maos* (三茅道藏) was incomplete, so he **loaded his supplies and traveled to Lixiang** (濑乡), where he **collated and corrected** the ancient texts of the *Way of Great Clarity* (太清).\n\nAfter a year, a mendicant of the Wu clan often came by day, carrying a patched basket to the **alms hall** (斋堂), where he would **upside-down** the remaining food on the stone plate before departing. The crowd scolded him for not taking it, but when the Master had finished washing the utensils, the mendicant inquired about his affairs.\n\nThe Master was then in his **yellow robes of the first grade** (黄衣初腊). The mendicant raised his hands and exclaimed, *\"Jute Maoshan and others are like this beggar seeking the Five Daoists!* (伍仙#4) Thus, I abandoned my search. I shall meet you tomorrow at the **flag pavilion inn** (旗亭酒家) to discuss the Way with you.\"*\n\nTurning to the Master, he said, *\"You are truly a Daoist vessel! Only, your old habits have not yet been purged—you have not yet been **washed and refined** (洒濯). If you do not, you will only burden yourself further. Can you go?\"*\n\nThe Master replied, *\"How dare I disobey your command? I shall **conceal my eyes** (藏睛).\"*\n\nA short while later, a **rustling sound** (哄然) struck his ears. Suddenly, he beheld a **bounded landscape** (阅阖), and the mendicant turned to him, *\"This is the River Middle Prefecture.\"* Before long, they reached the river, where the **flow was halted** (截流) to allow crossing. The Master **stepped forward** (踵之), as if **treading upon flat land** (平陆).\n\nUpon reaching the shore, the mendicant Wu, **joyful and delighted** (欣欣), exclaimed, *\"A worthy disciple can be instructed! I am your Water Star Disciple.\"* (水星童子)\n\n*\"Your single journey has already brought you to the **Great Transformation of Form at Taiyin** (度形太阴). Yet, you must **retreat into seclusion** (幽屏), and not weary of **deep concealment** (深眇). The great artisan does not reveal the unpolished gem to the world—otherwise, it would not be easily understood.\"*\n\nAt another time, they met again to **delve into the subtle mysteries** (审究夷微). The mendicant then **abruptly departed** (遽背而去), and the Master was **deeply grieved** (怆恨).\n\nWhen he returned to his native mountain, he **examined his heart and refined his resolve**, treasuring the teachings of the two Masters, **preserving the Three Protections and the One** (存三守一), and **emulating the fervor of Yang and Xu** (追杨许之烈).\n\nNot long after, the **Palace of the Celestial Clarity** (玉清昭应宫) was completed. A decree was issued selecting men of **renowned conduct** (名行). The **Minister of Works** (工部侍郎), Xue Ying, submitted the Master’s name, and the court sent an envoy to summon him. The Master declined with a **respectful memorial** (表辞), but the official carriages soon followed in procession. The **Emperor of Virtue** (章圣) ascended to Heaven, and the **Temple of Benevolence** (仁庙) succeeded his **spiritual service** (嗣服).\n\nUnder the **reign of the Illustrious and Austere Empress Dowager** (明肃太后), who ruled from behind the screen, Ding Jinong (晋公) and Wang Jiping (冀公) both recommended the Master to the court. The Master was summoned twice, but again declined. His **decline was expressed with warmth and elegance** (谢表温雅), bearing the **refined character of a Confucian scholar** (儒臣高世之风). The court admired him, and thus the two ministers composed poems:\n\nDing Jinong’s poem:\n*\"Great Concealment—why fear the bustling capital?\nThe Three Heavens’ **pure disputes** (澄诤) to pay homage to the Primordial Sovereign.\"* (元君)\n\nWang Jiping’s poem:\n*\"Why did you, a man of worth, break your ancient vow?\n**Carrying your lute and burdening your crane** (负琴担鹤), waiting to follow me.\"*\n\nThe Master responded in kind, his words **exquisitely refined** (词极清妙). The two ministers then **urged the Empress Dowager** to compel the Master to accept office, and the local officials **pressured him with threats of punishment** (敦迫). The Master, **having no choice** (不得已), thus **reluctantly took up the appointment** (受命劫).\n\nBefore he had **formally presented himself to the court** (经朝见), all officials were **prohibited from visiting him** (禁不得通谒), even **梁器、陶景、唐礼、昊筠**—yet these were **not worthy to compare with even a fraction of his merit** (未足方万分).\n\nSoon, by imperial decree, he **ascended the Treasure Symbol Pavilion** (宝符阁) to **inspect the Celestial Scriptures** (观天书). He repeatedly **submitted memorials requesting retirement** (累表乞退), but the **two Sovereigns** (二圣) favored him more than ever, fearing that his **bold defiance of courtly norms** (重违雅尚) would bring shame. Thus, the Master was **granted permission to return to his homeland** (得请束归故乡), where he **resolved to focus his mind and refine his thoughts** (决志精思), his **heart drifting into the boundless expanse** (心驰太空之境).\n\nThe court **bestowed rewards upon his journey** (赐劳), and **processions of carriages** (车盖) stretched endlessly.\n\nBefore this, a **nobleman** (贵人) had **reported to the Empress Dowager** (传上) about the Master’s **request for a mountain retreat** (近山立常宁一镇), saying that he wished to **provide a resting place for travelers and merchants** (为游客行商息肩之所).\n\nThe Master replied, *\"A Daoist must **dwell in rocky retreats and cavernous abodes** (岩居穴处), diligently **cultivate the Supreme Methods** (勤修上法), and **follow the rigorous ascetic practices** of the Great Mao’s **Celestial Command** (保大茅司命之苦行). Only then can I **recompense the imperial favor** (报国恩).*\n\n*\"If I were to **imitate the Western lands’ ornate temples and grand decorations** (效西方土木装严), it would not align with the **Teachings of the Venerable Laozi’s frugality and benevolence** (老氏慈俭之教).\"*\n\nThe court **acceded to his request** (从之).\n\nThe **Daoist Canon of the Three Caverns and Four Stages** (三洞四阶灵文宝岌), containing **sacred texts bound in gold and sealed with jade** (金绳玉检), is the **great secret transmission** (秘传大法) of the Way. From **Wei’s Nan Yue** (魏南岳) onward, down to the Master, it has been **passed through twenty-three generations** (二十有三代).\n\nThe Illustrious and Austere Empress Dowager wished to **follow the precedent of the Purple Void** (紫虚故事), **praying for the transmission of all the Dao’s methods** (祈授毕法). She **distant-revered** (遥尊) Zhu and Zhang as **Guiding Masters** (度保师), bestowing upon the Master the title **Observing Marvels, Illuminating True Perfection** (观妙明真), and constructing the **Heavenly Holy and Primordial Sovereign Observatories** (乾元、天圣两观) to **honor his teacher-student lineage** (旌师资). The Master did not decline this.\n\nAt that time, **the elixir vapors ascended, the divine essence flew** (琅讦飞精), and the **three furnaces’ divine aura** (神景三炉) had reached the **fourth turn of fire** (四转火).\n\nOne day, the **Jiangning Prefecture** (江宁府) received a letter from the **Shu State Governor** (蜀州守), Xiao Guan, regarding a **Daoist named Wu Bao** (道士武抱) who had **a book in hand** (一书者).

His disciples could not **fathom its meaning** (莫测所以).\n\nThe letter **reproached him for his prominent name and exposed virtue** (责姓名显耀), warning him of the **fault of revealing celestial secrets** (天机暴露).

      "translated_text": "The literary style was elegant and refined, with much to admire. The *jìnshēn* (文致) and *zǎoliàn* (藻练) scholars and officials, wearing their official caps and robes, frequently criticized and opposed the Master, warning against his influence. Their portraits and inscriptions were passed down through the ages—such as the so-called **Wu Xian Tong** (武仙童).\n\nIn the seventh year of **Tian Sheng** (天圣), when the **Great Elixir** (大丹) was completed, the cauldron overturned, and the elixir favored the disciple **Mao Fengrou** (毛奉柔), who secretly informed the Master of its state. The Master sighed and said: *\"The setting sun is near, and the dog’s mouth has passed once—truly so.\"*\n\nBy that year’s eleventh month, he had **laid down his office** (解驾), at the age of fifty-three. That very evening, he **closed the mountain gate** (掩关), forbidding his disciples from entering, which was **unusual** (颇异常时).\n\nAs the night reached its midpoint, the disciples gathered around his furnace altar, awaiting the **Dawn of the Jade Morning** (玉晨), when a **red-robed messenger** (朱衣使者) holding a scroll stood below the courtyard. Though his bearing was **composed and dignified** (甚都), his radiance dazzling like a mirror, the boy questioned him: *\"Who are you?\"* The messenger replied slowly: *\"I am **Zhen Guan Xia Lu Wenxiu** (真官下卢文秀), sent by the **Celestial Emperor** (帝) to welcome the **Jade Master** (朱真人).\"*\n\nThe disciples **stood in stunned silence** (牢肩惕息), not daring to move. Shortly after, the Master inquired about the hour, and was told: *\"The third watch has passed.\"* Then he asked again: *\"Has the **Jade Morning Bell** (玉晨钟) sounded yet?\"* The reply came: *\"Not yet.\"* He asked repeatedly, four times in all. When the bell finally chimed, the Master called his attendants: *\"I depart now.\"* Upon entering, they saw him **seated in solemn stillness** (危坐), holding the **Auspicious Symbol** (祥符) bestowed upon him—a **jade *ruyi*** (玉如意)—**erect and dignified** (俨然).\n\nThat evening, the heavens were bitterly cold, yet the Master’s neck emitted a **circular radiance** (圆光), filling the chamber with warmth. His **jade body** (玉体) glistened with sweat like pearls. As the **final rites** (大敛) were being conducted, a faint sound emerged from his coffin. The **Daoist law** (法固) called this **corpse dissolution** (尸解). When the coffin was lifted, they suspected only an empty robe remained.\n\nThe day before, **Tao Zhenren** (陶真人) had sat in silence, **shaken by tremors** (无故震者) three times. The assembly was **astonished** (咸异), but the Master remarked: *\"Why should this concern you?\"* That very night, his **spirit was transferred** (迁神), and **cranes cried** (鹤唳) as the altar revolved. The **valley winds hummed like flutes** (谷鸣若箫), and this continued for three days.\n\nThe **temporary magistrate of Jùróng** (句容权令), a **harsh official** (酷吏), was later replaced by **Chancellor Lǐ Gōng Dí** (丞相李公迪) during his tenure. When the Chancellor sent his subordinates with **words of invitation** (致词), urging the Master to visit and **bestow Daoist blessings upon the county** (俾县加道修肃), the Master **passed through the town without stopping** (不顾而去), and the magistrate, **harboring resentment** (阴衔之), **did not detain him further** (还又不少留).\n\nHis attendants urged: *\"The magistrate has donned his official robes and awaits you on the left. You should descend from your carriage and pay him a visit.\"* The Master replied: *\"It is not that I refuse, but the **blood-stained air** (血腥) is too hard to bear.\"* Later, when the magistrate’s **misfortunes grew worse** (闻益患), he **accused the Master’s disciples of poisoning him** (中丹毒死) and **drove them away** (尽逐先生徒弟). Many fled without time to spare, and the **strange auspices of Jiāxiáng** (嘉祥异瑞) were **suppressed and slandered** (为其所抑，诬) by him.\n\nEven the **Nine Palaces** (九重) of the imperial court were **vast and distant** (寥廓), offering no recourse. The following year, when the magistrate was removed from office, the disciples were finally able to **return and bury the Master** (葬反真之宅) in **Yùgāng’s western slope** (郁冈西麓), near the **corner of the *Fāngyuán* Cave** (方隅洞之束), a few steps from **Lǐ Zhenren’s Elixir Well** (李真人丹井), at a height of three *chǐ* (尺).\n\nAlas! **Though the Master’s foundation of purity and cultivation was profound** (夙净基修), it was **unfulfilled in some way** (宜无不圆), yet even he met misfortune. **How much more so for the ordinary disciples** (况悠悠之徒)!",

      "translated_text": "The Three Gates are the pathways of the divine spirits; without ritual offerings and exorcisms, they remain closed. To the east, a Daoist academy was established; to the west, a guest hall was set up. Thus, distinctions of rank are preserved, Daoists and laymen do not intermingle, and mortals and spirits remain separate.\n\nThe official said: \"Your reasoning is excellent. The temples of this mountain have been built and abandoned at different times throughout history. Many Daoist attendants have dwelled here. Yet none has ever used the theories of the Three *Qi*, the Three Heavens, the Three Venerables, and the Three Emperors to correct the order of ascension and descent. Was it perhaps the elevation of the formless and the return to stillness? Or was it a neglect of the proper use of ritual implements, leading to the creation of movement? Or an ignorance of the essence of the Absolute Void?\n\nFollowing your proposal, the county of *Yóuchéng* was reassigned to oversee the rectification. The work was completed accordingly.\n\nThe following spring, in the fifth month, the Hall of Yùhuáng was finished. On the day of its consecration, a pair of white cranes circled and soared above for the entire day, their cries echoing from afar. Then, the Master of the Upper Clarity Great Cavern, **Liú Hùnkāng**, along with his disciple entrusted with recording, remarked: \"At other times, white cranes would gather here on the eighteenth day of the third month, sometimes appearing and sometimes not, never consistently. Now that the hall is complete and the cranes descend, this is not merely the result of the official’s sincere reverence—it is the silent harmony with the True. How else could such an auspicious sign be summoned?

*Jiāngníng*’s *Chóngxǐ* Observatory, and the officials *Dīng Wéi* (the *Jiāngníng* Prefectural Inspectorate’s *Tújiǔ* for temple renovations) and *Hé Zhèngchén* (the *Jiāngníng* Military Prefect, *Jiāngnán* Circuit’s *Bīngmǎ Jiànxiá*, and *Zhùgōng* with a purple sash and golden fish pouch) erected this stele.\n\nEmperor Xuānhe’s Inscription on the *Huàdào* Stele:\n\nThe Dao/Way is boundless, its subtleties unfathomable.\nIt encompasses the transformations of existence, nurturing the heavens and earth.\nThus, the state devoutly reveres the Most High,\nand with awe honors the Dao/Way—\nexpanding the sacred origin of transformation,\nall returning to the true teaching of rectitude.\n\nSince the birth of the people, none have truly known the path to the Dao/Way,\nand this has endured for ages.\n\nWhenever I reflect upon this, my heart aches with sorrow,\nfor the Dao/Way is the embodiment of the Sage’s essence,\nused daily by the common folk without their knowing.\nHence, its principles are kept hidden in reverence,\nand I seek earnest and profound minds\nto establish norms and guide customs,\nso I issue earnest admonitions,\nthat all who come after may find clarity and return to the Dao/Way.\n\nNow, those who are agitated and restless,\nunaware of the Dao/Way’s wondrous nurturing,\nyet instead follow the heterodox customs of ritualistic practices—\naccustomed to their ways, they also teach their methods.\nThey equate stillness with emptiness,\nand extinguishment with true joy,\nleading the ignorant masses to perish in their delusions.\nThis is their natural course—\nhow can one not pity their profound confusion?\n\nMoreover, humans dwell between heaven and earth,\nat the most vital point of existence.\nWhen conceived in the womb,\nthey are nourished by the Three Primordials,\ntheir form shaped by the Nine *Qi* breaths.\nBearing heaven above and earth beneath,\nnone escape the Dao/Way’s foundation.\n\nThose of superior wisdom,\nwho early discern the numinous and refined,\nneed no instruction and naturally incline toward the Dao/Way—\nperhaps three in a thousand.\n\nAs for those of middling or lesser wisdom,\nthey are ensnared by the concerns of names and rituals, wealth and rank.\nThough the Dao/Way’s benevolent nurturing exists,\nthey yield to the burdens of familial affection,\nstill lingering in the pleasures of sound and color,\nthus appearing as if lost or barely present.\n\nThe lowest of the wise,\ncontent with fine food and clothing,\ncomforted by ease and familiar customs,\nremain utterly oblivious to the Dao/Way’s path,\nforsaking truth for falsehood,\nunaware that their very form and *Qi* are born of the Dao/Way itself.\n\nIndeed, humans are to the Dao/Way as fish are to water—\nfish lose the water, they die.\nHumans lose the Dao/Way—what fate awaits them?\n\nAll who govern the people must surely uphold the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way is the summation of the void,\nthe source of all transformations.\nIts vastness knows no beginning,\nits depth no end.\nAll phenomena arise from it,\nthe Five Tones take shape through it—\nthus, though the six directions may seem immense,\nthey are contained within it,\nand though a single hair may seem minuscule,\nit owes its form to its influence.\nIts remoteness cannot be ascended step-by-step,\nits responses are swift yet unseen—\nthis is called *húnlún* (indiscriminate unity).\n\n*Húnlún* is the essence of the *Tàijī* (Supreme Ultimate).\n\nThus, the *Tàijī* generates the Two Polarities—\nheaven and earth.\nThe clear *Qi* ascends to form heaven,\nthe turbid *Qi* descends to form earth,\nand their harmonious mingling creates humanity.\nHence, the Five Celestial Stems radiate their essence,\nthe Three Celestial Lights descend to aid,\nand the Three Talents are perfected.\n\nIn its transformative workings,\nthe Dao/Way manifests the seasons of heat and cold, dryness and moisture,\nthe names of square and round, form and instrument,\nthe degrees of waxing and waning, ebb and flow.\nThus, the sun and moon adorn the sky,\nthe stars follow their appointed courses,\nthunder and lightning strike like drums,\nwinds and rains moisten like waves.\nIt sows the hundred grains in due time,\nto nourish the people,\nand multiplies life and growth,\nto enrich the eternal harvests.\nThen, each person fulfills their potential,\nand all things follow their nature—\nthus, they reap to eat, weave to clothe,\nand rejoice in the world of great peace,\nall because of the Dao/Way’s wondrous creation and nurturing.\n\nObserve the ages from *Fúxī* down to the Three Dynasties—\nthough their titles differed,\ntheir reverence for the Dao/Way and service to heaven remained one.\n\nNow, those who are shrouded in ignorance and inverted in their ways,\nshould investigate its principles and worship them with awe—\nis this not virtuous?\n\nAnd what of those who are clearly enlightened above?\nThey are indeed to be feared and revered.\n\nNow, I clarify and instruct,\nspreading salvation to those steeped in old habits,\nexpanding the blessings of all under heaven,\nso that those who change for the better may cherish life,\nawaken with sudden realization,\nand renew their resolve,\nreturning to the true Dao/Way.\nAbove, this aligns with the Most High’s enjoyment of heaven,\nbelow, it fulfills the mandate of the *Yīn* (dark) and *Shào* (light) to continue the *Bù* (ancient) and *Xù* (future) traditions—\nthus, the beauty of the *Huángjí* (august sovereignty) radiates,\nenduring in the realm of virtue and morality,\npermeating the domain of benevolence and longevity—\nis this not magnificent?\n\nOn the *Xiāntiān* Festival of the *Gēngyín* year of the *Dàguān* era,\ninscribed at the *Xuānhe* Hall.\n\nIn the second year of the *Zhènghé* era, on the twenty-sixth day of the first month,\nthe Daoist master *Shǒujìng Chénghé* of the *Guàndìng* Sect erected this stele,\nfollowed by the Thirty-Third Heavenly Master of the Han lineage, *Zhāng Jìxiān*,\nwho inscribed the text.\nThis concludes Volume Twenty-Five of the *Máoshān Zhì*.\n#1 Song Stele: [original text missing; restored from

      "translated_text": "「In accordance with the records, during the Western Han dynasty, there resided upon **Jīnlíng Jùqū Shān** (金陵句曲山) a **True Person** (真人), who embraced **divine essence** (神) in stillness, transcending the world with **serene detachment** (超然遗物). **Celestial sages** (仙圣) descended to converse with him, enabling his ascent to the **Clouded Heavens** (云天). From his remaining **Dao/Way** (绪余), he transformed the **Latter Han** (二季), who also departed as **transcendents** (仙去)—this was the **Three Teachings Master** (三茅君), and thus the mountain came to be called **Máo Shān** (茅山).\n\nSince that time, **strange luminosities** (光景之异), **auspicious cranes and clouds** (云鹤之祥), and **resonant music** (笙箫之响) have been frequently witnessed upon its slopes. Among those of the **outer realm** (方外), many **seeking the Dao/Way** (慕道) arrived, drawn by its renown—**countless in number** (莫可胜数).\n\nAt the beginning of the **Xīnxīng era** (熙宁), a **Daoist** (道士) from **Chángzhōu**, **Liú Hùnkāng** (刘混康), first constructed a **thatched hut** (茅结庵) upon **Jījīn Fēng** (积金峰) of the mountain. Upon his arrival, he gathered **acorns and chestnuts** (橡栗) for sustenance and burned **bridge-tree seeds** (桥实) as incense. With time, he found their taste **unweariingly sweet** (甘之不厌), and thus people gradually came to regard him as **strange and wondrous** (信异). Many carried **firewood and provisions** (负薪裹粮) to sustain him.\n\nThe Master himself possessed **mysterious conduct** (妙行) and supplemented it with **constant benevolence** (常善), aiding all living beings. He often administered **Upper Clarity Elixir Water** (上清符水) to cure illnesses, and those who ingested it **recovered without fail** (辄愈). Thus, people from near and far **converged in streams** (辐赓), and the Master’s fame grew ever more renowned.\n\n**Philosopher-Emperor Zhèngzōng** (哲宗) summoned him to the capital, where he was received in the **Banquet Hall** (燕见便殿) and granted the title **Dòngyuán Tōngmiào Dàshī** (洞元通妙大师). He was further commanded to renovate and expand his original residence, which, upon the **change of era to Yuánsù** (元符), was renamed **Yuánsù Guàn** (元符观). Though the Master repeatedly declined and sought to return, permission was granted.\n\nYet even through the reign of **Philosopher-Emperor Zhèngzōng**, the **Yuánsù Guàn** remained unfinished. In the **second autumn of Emperor Huìzōng’s reign** (皇帝二年秋), a **court eunuch** (中贵) was dispatched to urgently summon the Master to the capital. The emperor also issued decrees to the **regional governors and inspectors** (守臣监司), instructing them to **persuade him thoroughly** (委曲敦谕), ensuring he made no further excuses.\n\nUpon his arrival from **Máo Shān**, the Master remained in audience for a long time, his words aligning with the emperor’s intentions. Later, when inquired about the **Three Teachings Master**, he recounted all he had heard, prompting the emperor to **bestow an elevated title** (韶加锡号) upon the **Three Teachings Master** and construct a **hall for ritual worship** (构殿以礼祠) upon the mountain in his honor.\n\nThe Master further requested the construction of a **Hall of the Emperor’s Original Command** (本命殿) in the **southern bundle** (束南隅) upon the **Longevity Land** (长生地), which was granted. Thus, **bells were installed in towers**, **scriptures were harmonized**, **annual offerings were made to disciples**, **daily provisions were provided to the assembly**, and all official matters were fully attended to.\n\nAdditionally, a **decree was issued** (降诰), bestowing upon him the title **Bǎozhēn Guàn Miàochōnghé Shìjiān** (葆真观妙冲和先生), and ordaining **over ten of his disciples** as **Daoists** (道士). Among them, the most eminent were granted **purple robes** (紫衣) and **titles of Master** (师名) as honors, demonstrating the **highest reverence** (尊礼之甚至).\n\nAfter the Master’s second farewell and return to his mountain, the emperor personally inscribed **several volumes of the Daoist Canon** (道藏经) and painted a **portrait of Lǎozǐ** (老子), presenting them as gifts to honor his departure.\n\nAs the **palace neared completion**, the emperor inscribed upon its **lintel** (膀) the name **Yuánsù Wànníng Gōng** (元符万宁宫), declaring that **\"the celestial script descends upon the rocky valleys\"** (云汉之章下贲岩谷), signifying that **divine beings would henceforth guard it**, enduring **a hundred million years** (垂之亿年), in **harmony with the boundless Dao/Way** (与道无极).\n\nMoreover, he remarked that since the **construction began in the Yuánsù era** (元符) and was completed in the present, the name was retained and **augmented** (增之) to **manifest the intent of continuing the legacy and documenting deeds** (彰继志述事之意). The **wise and saintly emperors succeeded one another**, perpetuating the **true and flourishing Dao/Way** (绍隆真风). This is what is meant by **\"the completion of one palace, yet two glories arise\"** (一宫之成而二美并焉).\n\nHaving recorded these events, I ensure that **posterity may observe them**, and have further composed a poem in commemoration.

imperial command,\nFilling it with gold,\nThus safeguarding the sacred treasures,\nForever as a jewel of this palace,\nAnd also to show that they should not be passed on to the common people.\n\nYour servant, **Jìngzhī** (净之), humbly witnessed\nThe Emperor’s gracious fulfillment of the Master’s earlier intentions,\nAnd the adornment of this grand structure—\nHis favor is most profound, his grace most abundant.\n\nThe **record of governance** (资政之记) is expansive and splendid,\nUnfolding the Emperor’s enlightened will—\nIts elegance is most refined, its brilliance most radiant.\n\nIf this were not celebrated,\nHow could the world behold it?\n\nYour servant, ever inheriting the Master’s teachings,\nRepeatedly granted audiences in response to imperial inquiries,\nJoined in the **Green Regret Festival** (绿庆) upon its completion,\nAnd was bestowed with a singular honor—\nThe Emperor’s kindness is boundless, beyond measure,\nAnd your servant has no way to repay it.\nThus, he separately engraved this fine stone,\nTo spread its fame far and wide,\nSo that all within and beyond the distant realms\nMay thoroughly understand the Emperor’s purpose in building this palace,\nThe Master’s **transcendent transformation** (解化),\nAnd purify their hearts and minds to pursue the **true Dao/Way** (真风)—\nThis is your servant’s earnest hope.\n\nIn the **Year of Great Observation** (大观), second month, fifteenth day,\nThe Emperor specially granted **Master Shòuguìjìnghé** (守静凝和法师),\nThe **Twenty-sixth Generation Successor of the Upper Clarity Scripture** (上清经录二十六代嗣教宗师),\nAnd the **Resident Abbot** (充住持) of the **Yuánsù Wanníng Palace** (元符万宁宫),\nYour servant, **Jìngzhī** (笞一净之), respectfully inscribed.\n\nIn the **Year of Xīnwèi’s Reign** (咸淳), seventh year,\nThe **Year of the Snake** (岁次辛未), second month’s first day,\nThe Emperor granted **Master Guānwénmiàodà** (观妙大师),\nThe **Forty-second Generation Successor of the Upper Clarity Scripture** (劫差茅山上清经录四十二代嗣教宗师),\nAnd the **Supervisor of the Yuánsù Wanníng Palace** (管辖元符万宁官事),\nYour servant, **Zhái Zhìyǐng** (翟志颖), re-erected the stone.\n\n**The Stele of Master Huàyáng’s Transcendent Transformation**

households** (食实封一千一百户),\nRespectfully inscribed this stele on the Emperor’s command.\n\nIn the spring of the **Year of Great Observation** (大观), second year,\nThe Emperor decreed that **Master Huàyáng** (华阳先生) come to court in the capital.\n\nOn the fourth month, **Dīnghài Day** (丁亥), the Master arrived from **Máoshān** (茅山).\nThe Emperor ordered **two hundred Daoist priests** (道士) to prepare solemn rituals for his welcome,\nAnd lodged him in the **Upper Clarity Palace** (上清储祥宫), newly constructed as a **Yuánsù side hall** (新作元符之别观).\n\nThe Master fell ill,\nAnd could not attend court.\nThe Emperor’s envoys for inquiry and care never ceased on the road.\n\nOn the tenth of that month,\nThe imperial carriage visited the **Reserved Auspicious Palace** (储祥宫),\nWhere the Emperor summoned the Master for an audience,\nAnd conversed with him for a long time.\n\nThe two nights prior,\nThe Master dreamed of serving the **Celestial Sovereign** (天帝),\nDiscussing and expounding upon the *Great Cavern True Scripture* (《大洞真经》),\nAnd upon waking, he marveled at it.\n\nWhen he met the Emperor,\nHe presented the *Great Cavern Scripture* (《大洞经》), which he had always treasured.\nThe Emperor, upon viewing it, was moved and exclaimed:\n*\"I have just finished copying this scripture while keeping a strict fast,\nAnd personally painted the images of the Three Jade Sprouts Sages (三茅真君),\nIntending to bestow them upon you, the Master.*\n\nThat very day,\nHe granted both the scripture and the images to him.\n\nAfter the Master received the scripture,\nHis thoughts aligned with

later, on a **Ding-you** (丁酉) day,\nWhen the officials reported that the Master had departed in transcendence,\nThe Emperor was deeply shaken and grieved.\nHe ordered the imperial attendants to grant a **golden funeral tent** (金营丧),\nAnd specially bestowed the title **Grand Minister of the Middle Office** (太中大夫),\nCommanding **officials to escort his coffin back** (使－使护其柩以还).\n\nWhen the burial

ancients who attained **perfect virtue** (全德),\nRooted themselves in the **Dao/Way** (道),\nAnd though they relied on material means,\nThey never lacked,\nFor their worth lay within themselves.\nThough they followed others,\nThey never lost their true essence.\nThus, their actions were as natural as drinking,\nAnd there was no moment when they were not in perfect harmony.\n\nBut in later times,\nThose who merely bent to **one-sided Daoist practices** (一曲之士)\nKnew only how to serve themselves,\nAnd their flaw led them to **sever ties with the world** (绝物),\nEmbrace emptiness, and guard

himself with earnest diligence,\nAnd in his dealings with others and benefiting people,\nHis efforts never waned—\nNear and far, all revered and followed him.\n\nDuring the reign of Emperor Zhezong,\nHe was summoned to the capital,\nAnd was granted the title *Dongyuan Tongmiao Dashī* (洞元通妙大师).\nHis hermitage was renamed *Yuanshu Guan* (元符观).\n\nNot long after,\nHe paid a visit to the court and returned to his mountain.\nIn the first year of Emperor Huizong’s reign,\nHe was again summoned to the capital,\nAnd the following year, he was permitted to return,\nReceiving the *Nine Elders’ Xiandu Jun* jade seal.\nThe emperor also ordered the expansion of his halls,\nAnd commanded attendants to oversee the work,\nGranting him full authority in the capital.\n\nSoon after,\nA decree was issued,\nAnd he was granted the title *Baozhen Guanmiao Xiansheng* (葆真观妹先生).\n\nThough dwelling in the mountains,\nHis hands never ceased from labor and inquiry—\nNo month passed without effort.\nWhen the observatory neared completion,\nHe petitioned to visit the imperial court to repay the emperor’s grace.\nThe emperor, in turn, exhorted and encouraged him to come,\nAnd summoned him to the *Xuanhe Hall* for an audience,\nGranting imperial calligraphy and paintings.\nThus, the observatory’s name was expanded to *Yuanshu Wan’ning Gong* (元符万宁宫),\nAnd its main gate, along with the *Jingming Wannian* (景命万年),\n*Tianning Wanfu* (天宁万福) halls,\nAnd the *Taiping Feitian Law Wheel* pavilion,\nWere all inscribed by the emperor’s own hand.\nHis virtuous deeds shone brightly through the ages.\n\nThe solemnity of the Three Teachings’ reverence\nHad never been so grand as in this time.\n\nThe following summer, in the fourth month,\nThe Master again requested leave to return,\nAnd the emperor bestowed the name *Gangshen* (港神) upon his hermitage,\nAdding the characters *Chonghe* (冲和) to his title.\nAfter several months,\nHe composed the *Regong Ode* (庆成颂),\nAnd the emperor granted him a poem of farewell as an honor.\n\nWhen the *Daoguang* era began,\nThe emperor repeatedly summoned him,\nBut the Master firmly declined,\nAnd permission was granted.\n\nThus, an edict was issued,\nCommanding his senior disciple, *Shoujing Ninghe Shifu* (守静凝和法师),\nTo attend in his place,\nTo convey his virtue and intentions.\n\nThe following year,\nThe Master came to the capital.\nThe day before his departure,\nThe crane he had kept in his hermitage suddenly flew away.\nThe Master, upon hearing this, sighed:\n*\"The crane departs—\nPerhaps I shall not return.\"*\n\nAnd indeed, he died in the capital.\n\nThat very year, on the seventh month’s *Renshen* day (壬申),\nHe was buried on *Dieyu Peak* (迭玉峰) to the south of the mountain.\nAn imperial decree posthumously honored him as *Jingyi* (静一),\nAnd his tomb’s shrine was named *Cangzhen Guan* (藏真观).\n\nThe Master refined his *qi* to attain softness,\nAnd did not align with the nature of things.\nHis essence was profound and pure, like clouds in motion—\nHis stillness and activity were both harmonious.\nFrom beginning to end, his reputation and honor were exalted—\nWorthy of inscription.\n\n**Inscription:**\n*Mang!*—the Dao’s origin,\nBefore anything existed.\nSeeking it through *qi*,\nIt already sprouted like seedlings.\nThose who attained it in antiquity\nWere its pioneers.\nLater, in the depths of obscurity,\nIts

Master,\nWalked with the ancients,\nGuarding pure *qi*,\nWith no schemes or pursuits.\nWhen the emperor summoned him to court,\nHe came with grace,\nDaring to declare what he had heard—\nHis wisdom penetrated *wuwei* (无为).\nHis lofty name was renowned,\nAnd he took joy in mountain seclusion,\nRiding the transformations to their end—\nHis form was thus.\n\nHis talent was vast, his Dao complete—\nA request for posterity.\n\nThe Master, favored by the sage emperor,\nReceived grace and honor from beginning to end—\nAs seen in the founding of *Cangzhen Guan*,\nUnprecedented in history.\n\nThe emperor commanded artisans to depict his transformations,\nAnd personally inscribed the hall’s name as a gift.\n\nThe monumental stele, inscribed with gold leaf, was difficult to

I fell ill with a spleen ailment,\nAnd my appetite vanished.\nThough I struggled with medicine,\nThere was no improvement.\nRecently, after performing rituals to pray for divine mercy,\nI received a response—\nAnd now must depart this world.\n\nThe logic of departure and remaining\nI accept without regret,\nBut I grieve that I must forever part from Your Majesty,\nAnd can no longer behold Your

meager, I dare not presume to risk my life\nin offering these words.\nYet I recall my master’s solemn charge,\nwho bade me prioritize loyalty and service to the state.\nAt this critical juncture, if I fail to speak even a word\nto aid Your Majesty’s virtue,\nI would betray Heaven, betray my master,\nand carry my regret to the grave.\n\nI have already entrusted the *Zongfa Luju* scrolls,\nthe *True Scripture* seals, and Your Majesty’s\nprevious and later gifts of calligraphy and paintings\nto my disciple, Yu Xiyin, for safekeeping.\nI further pray Your Majesty, in remembrance of my master’s\ndevotion to teaching and propagating the Dao,\nmay extend Your grace and protection to our lineage,\nso that even if I never again behold Your face,\nmy death will be without regret.\n\nAs I pen these words, my sorrow deepens.\nI, a loyal subject, have spoken again—\n**Eulogy for Master Chongyin**\nComposed and inscribed by the humble servant Cai Bian,\n*Jianjia Shaobo, Zhengdong Jun Jiedu Shi, Kaifu Yitong Sansi,\nTaiyi Guan Shi* concurrently serving as *Shiren Xiuguo Shi*.\n\nMaster Chongyin’s given name was Jingzhi,\nwith the courtesy name Qingyuan,\na native of Jining.\n\nHis father, Deyi, was a man of idle youth\nwho later took to Daoist arts,\nearning the nickname *Chi Yi* Old Man among his neighbors.\nA Daoist from Yuhang, who concealed his true name,\noften visited him.\n\nWhen Master Chongyin was still in the womb,\none day, his father rose early and saw the Daoist enter their home,\nonly to vanish moments later—\na strange occurrence that filled him with wonder.\nSoon after, Master Chongyin was born.\n\nFrom birth, he was pure and unadorned,\nwith profound insight and discernment.\nAs a child, he abstained from meat,\nand by age six or seven, recited hundreds of words daily.\nWhile playing with grasshoppers, he would sketch Daoist figures on the ground.\n\nHis father took him to Mount Mao.\nAt the time, Master Jingyi Liu Hunkang had secluded himself on Jijin Peak,\nand upon seeing him, declared:\n*“This child will one day become a Celestial Master.”*\nHe taught him the *Qingju* methods,\nand Master Chongyin leapt with joy, vowing to stay as his disciple\nand never return home—\nhis father, delighted, agreed.\n\nHe served diligently at his master’s side for years.\nWhen Wang Anshi resided in Jining,\nhe heard of Master Jingyi’s virtuous conduct,\nsent a letter with gifts to invite him.\nMaster Chongyin carried his staff and sandals to meet him,\nand in their conversation, his words always struck the essence.\nWang Anshi repeatedly praised him.\n\nDuring the Yuanyou era,\nwhen I governed Xuancheng,\nMaster Jingyi sent Master Chongyin with a letter.\nI lodged him in the western chamber of my rear garden,\nwhere fragrant fruits hung before him.\nThough the garden boasted layered pavilions and towering trees,\noverlooking the city and stretching for a hundred *li*,\nMaster Chongyin sat in silence all day, never leaving his room—\nI marveled at this, and so I initiated him into Daoist ranks.\n\nHis resolve grew ever deeper,\nand Master Jingyi entrusted him with the *San Dong* scriptures.\nHe inscribed talismans to heal ailments and dispel malevolence,\nand his methods were often verified.\n\nOver the years, he mastered his teacher’s entire Dao,\nretiring to the secluded mountains,\nyet his reputation spread swiftly in his time.\n\nWhen Emperor Zhezong ruled with benevolence,\nseeking Daoist sages to protect the realm,\nhe first summoned Master Jingyi to the capital.\nWhen Master Chongyin entered the court with him,\nthe emperor studied his appearance with interest\nand bestowed upon him the title of *Shi* as an honor.\n\nAt the start of the Yuanshu era,\nhe was granted his residence as an observatory,\nnamed *Yuanshu Guan*.\nWhen the present emperor personally embodied the Dao\nto govern the lands,\nhe commanded me to urgently invite Master Jingyi to court,\nforbidding any refusal.\n\nMaster Chongyin accompanied him,\nand the honors bestowed upon him were extraordinary.\nThe officials were ordered to enlarge his nameplate,\nand the emperor himself inscribed his title as a gift,\nfurther bestowing upon him the title *Guardian of the Dao* (*Shoujing Fashi*)\nand appointing him as the abbot.\n\nThe following year, he was summoned again to court,\nand when he presented himself, his disciples who accompanied him\nwere also granted favors.\n\nAfter some time, he requested permission to return to the mountains,\nand was further honored with the title *Ninghe*,\nalong with imperial calligraphy and paintings as parting gifts.\n\nIn the fourth year of the *Daguan* era,\nhe returned from Mount Mao,\nand the emperor commanded that an altar be erected at his lodging,\nso he might expound his teachings to the scholars.\nA court official was dispatched to oversee the matter,\nand many officials and scholars attended to receive his instruction.\nHe again firmly declined and returned to the mountains.\nThe emperor then gave him imperial calligraphy and a painted portrait of Master Jingyi.\n\nPreviously, the *Jiuyou Huanglu* had long been neglected,\nand few practiced the Dao.\nMaster Chongyin revived it,\nand the rituals of the two *Ke* systems flourished in his time.\n\nWhenever disciples resided in remote, inaccessible mountains,\nif heavy rains or snow blocked the paths,\nMaster Chongyin would urgently bring them supplies.\nIn years of famine, he would divert the taxes from his fields\nto feed the hungry with millet gruel.\nIf a captive or prisoner passed by, he would clothe and feed them.\n\nAfter several years, one day he gathered his disciples\nand said:\n*“I am now forty-six years old.\nMy master once recorded that my lifespan would not exceed this.\nI am departing.”*\nThough he bore the nation’s heavy gratitude,\nhe could not face the emperor in person,\nso he took up his brush to draft a farewell memorial.\n\nThe next day, he bathed, donned his robes,\nand passed away—\non the third day of the seventh month, *Zhonghe* era.\n\nWhen the memorial reached the emperor,\nhe mourned deeply and posthumously bestowed upon him\nthe title *Chongyin Master*,\ngranting him official honors.\n\nIn the eleventh month of that year,\nhis remains were interred beneath Huagai Peak,\non the southern slope of the Great Mao Peak.\nHis disciples numbered over forty,\nwith Fu Xilie and Xu Xihe as the foremost.",

      "translated_text": "The emperor, upon seeing him, bestowed great favor and labored to honor him, removing his own imperial robes to bestow them, and further commanding that his likeness be painted in the **Divine Immortal Hall**. Yet Zhang Zhen firmly requested to return to the mountain.\n\nThe master, rising from obscurity, gained recognition from the sage-emperor. Over six times he came to the imperial court—once in the *Rénwǔ* year to inspect the troops, and again summoned to the traveling palace for an audience, each time receiving ever-greater honors.\n\nInitially, the **Empress Dowager** wished to transform his hermitage into a grand observatory, but Zhang Zhen declined, stating that such a title would bring official burdens, unsuited to his secluded life. Thus, only the current name was bestowed in the sixth month of the *Yǐhài* year.\n\nIn the *Gēngchén* year, the **Three Pure Ones Hall** was constructed, with statues and ritual furnishings all crafted by imperial artisans. Later, a silver-funded **Heavenly Auspicious Pavilion** was granted as a traveling palace, enshrining imperial calligraphy, and a tiered pavilion was built to house a bell from the inner treasury. Its radiance descended like clouds upon the earth, its sacred vessels warding off spirits, and celestial guardians standing watch. Over two decades of imperial bestowals, all funds were devoted to halls and shrines, granaries and kitchens—each in proper order, neither extravagant nor meager, their designs precise and harmonious.\n\nIn the *Buqian* year of the *Jiāndào* era, three hundred and thirty *mǔ* of land were granted, with the tax exemption for the *Hángzhōu* and *Zhè* regions—his virtue was indeed profound.\n\nHis dwellings, high and low, followed the mountain’s contours, fitting yet secluded, neither hidden nor exposed. The **White Cloud Peak** embraced his left, the **Small Peak** bowed to his right, while **Red Mountain** cradled him in front, the **Great Luo Spring** stretching far before him, and the **Ascension Peak** visible in the distance. Purple and emerald hues encircled him, the four mountains like screens, morning light dappled and shifting, while evening breezes carried the pure, round tones of the *qín*—as if severed from the world of dust.\n\nA humble man yet able to move the emperor’s lofty ears, to enjoy the supreme delights of mountain and forest—truly, he must have possessed such virtue!\n\nAh! The teachings of the **Old Sage** and **Buddha** stand alongside Confucius, their doctrines clashing and converging in later ages. The **True Person** harmonizes the Three into One, governing with rectitude and facing south in authority, while Confucian learning spreads across the land, laws refined, music and rites flourishing. The two traditions support it, guiding the people’s hearts toward goodness. Through gradual cultivation, customs grow pure and thick, wars cease, punishments abandoned, and the realm ascends toward the domain of **Ren and Longevity**—how could this not be his contribution?\n\nDuring their audiences, Zhang Zhen spoke little, yet his words on **Daoist adepts’ deceit** and the **principles of governance through stillness**—what choice did the emperor have but to heed them? Heaven itself must have listened.\n\nThat he could move the emperor’s ears and enjoy such bliss—how fitting!\n\nThe master hailed from **Jìnlíng**, **Chángzhōu**. In his youth, he bore the name **Yì** and the virtue-name **Dádào**, later taking the Daoist precept and adopting his present name, though the world still knew him by his virtue-name.\n\nNine years after his passing, the hermitage’s disciple **Máo Jiàn**—who once shared a day’s intimacy with the master and, with his brother **Wáng Jiànzhì**, wandered the **Jīngxī** streams for forty years—entrusted me to record this account. Thus, I have gathered only the hermitage’s latter days, linking them to its founding, and inscribed this.\n\nHis honors from the two palaces, his glory and favor, would warrant a full chronicle—yet to dwell on such singular grace, I omit it here.\n\nRecorded and inscribed by **Lǐ Chǔquán**, *Cháosàn Dàfū*, newly commissioned to oversee **Chǔzhōu Military Prefecture**, on the first day of the ninth month, *Chúnxī* 10.",

She wove the Emperor’s virtue, assisted in the transformation of the world, and as his inner helpmate, she remained in leisure, cherishing the Dao and cultivating stillness, her heart pure and white.\n\nOn the **Jīadìng Rénwǔ** (Regency) year of **Gēngwǔ** (1200), the Emperor commanded **Yìchén Shàngguān Déqīn**, Left Street Overseer, to seal a black jade tablet with imperial edict, solemnly conveying the decree to follow the precedent of **Chángxiàn Míngsù Empress**, and proceed to **Huáyáng Dòngtiān**, the **Shàngqīng Zōngtán** (Supreme Purity Altar), to receive the **Dàdòng Bìfǎ Bǎolù** (Great Cavern’s Secret Law Transmission Scroll), the **Jīnlóng Yùbì** (Golden Dragon Jade Tablet), and the **zhìxìn lǐyí** (sincere ritual observances)—all without omission.\n\nThe **Shàngqīng Jīnglù Zōngshī** (Supreme Purity Scripture Transmission Master), **Xué Rǔjǐ**, presided over the altar and transmitted the precepts.\n\nI, **Rǔjǐ**, reverently obeyed the imperial command, purified my body and mind, and with sincere devotion, journeyed to **Nányuè** (Southern Peak), focusing my thoughts on the **Shànglíng** (Supreme Spirit). I established the **Yùlù Dàochǎng** (Jade Register Ritual Ground) and the **Luótiān Dàjiào** (Celestial Net Great Offering), broadly conducting fasts and sacrifices, summoning the **Yǔyī** (Feathered Robes).\n\nThat night, the **Yùguǒ Jīnbō** (Jade Strings and Golden Waves) shimmered, their luminous traces lingering like the Han dynasty’s celestial apparitions. Auspicious omens and sacred mists filled the palace courts in abundance.\n\nThe following day, **shēnghé** (mythical birds) soared and danced in celestial display, while **língzhī** (sacred mushrooms) and rare grasses sprouted in the bright groves. All who came from afar to witness were moved to reverence and awe—how splendid and resplendent!\n\nI, **Xiānjué** (Prior Awakening), once of humble station, was graced by **Emperor Xiàozōng** with the favor of returning to the mountains. I wandered with **Rǔjǐ**, witnessing these grand events, my joy unbounded.\n\nIn examining the transmission of these scriptures from antiquity, seeking where their lineage persists, their grandeur is sublime and ineffable—truly the bridge to the Dao and the path to transcendence. As for their radiance and propagation, entrusted to emperors and empresses, that they might align with Heaven and embody the Dao, the splendor of our dynasty surpasses even the past.\n\nThe **qi** congealed in the Nine Heavens, forming naturally of its own accord; the **fire** refined the boundless void, and the imperial hand recorded it—thus did this **Bǎolù** (Precious Scroll) originate.\n\nThe **Tàipíng Xiàjiào** (Great Peace Edict) descended, bestowed by the **Xiǎoyǒu Tiānwáng** (Lesser Heavenly Sovereign), the **Zǐxū Yuánjūn** (Purple Void Primordial Lord), spreading among mortals—thus did this **Bǎolù** transmit.\n\nWhen the **Yuánjūn** first descended to **Jùqū** (Sentence Bend), he commanded **Yáng Xí** to inscribe its text in ancient script. The **Shàngqīng Xiānxiū Xù Jiànbǎo** (Supreme Purity Immortal Xu’s Sword Treasure) was passed down in a **Lánghán** (Lantern Case) with **fèngluó jīnniǔ** (phoenix-woven golden buttons), its solemn oaths and covenants weighty. Those who received it inscribed their names on **jīnjiǎn** (golden tablets) from the **Zìzài Dāntái** (Self-Soaring Celestial Terrace). Unless one was destined, they would not belong to this lineage.\n\nAcross the dynasties, emperors and empresses revered and upheld it, using it to prolong the imperial lineage and extend their years. Its blessings were as certain as the drum responding to the rod—yet even this could not fully reveal its grandeur.\n\nFrom the **Yuánjūn**, twenty-two generations passed to **Guānmiào Xiānshēng Zhū Zìyīng**, who became the **Chángxiàn Míngsù Empress’s** altar master.\n\nTwo more generations brought it to **Chōnghé Xiānshēng Liú Húnkāng**, during the **Xuānhé** era. Emperor **Huìzōng** commanded him to compile the **Sāndòng Sìfǔ** (Three Caverns and Four Auxiliaries), making him the **Mèngchuán** (Oath Transmission) Master, and bestowed a white jade seal to continue the **Zōngtán** (Altar Lineage).\n\nNine generations later, it reached me, **Rǔjǐ**, who once again was graced by the Holy Empress, humbly accepting her exalted trust. I augmented the **Jīnglù**, and thus the Dao grew ever more luminous, its propagation ever more vast.\n\nThe sacred lineage of imperial descendants, generation upon generation, never forgot the Dao’s transformation, ascending to **Rénshòu** (Human Longevity). This is a fortune encountered once in a thousand ages, unmatched beneath the heavens.\n\nHeaven sent its omens, Earth did not hoard its treasures—yet this scarcely reveals how Heaven favored our Holy Empress, that for ten thousand years she might share the Emperor’s glory, becoming the Mother of All Under Heaven. This was the **Jiāngjīng Sānjìng** (Three Celestial Precincts’ descent), the **Liúguāng Shíjí** (Ten Extremes of Radiance), entrusted to her—was it not so?\n\nIn reverence for the Empress, Your Highness, whose wisdom and benevolence shine like Heaven’s decree, whose divine grace grows ever brighter—when the hundred spirits bestow their blessings and auspicious **qi** fills the sky, the nation’s sacred calendar has passed its term, and its fragrance endures for all generations.\n\nI dare not remain silent and thus humbly record this, merely chronicling the beginning and end without presuming to compose.\n\n**Jiādìng** **Sānnián** (1203), **Gēngwǔ** year, the sixteenth day of the fifth month. **Yòujiē Dàolù Níngshén Zhāi Gāoshì** (Right Street Daoist Registrar of Concentrated Spirit), **Liú Xiānjué**, with hands clasped and head bowed, respectfully records this.\n\n**Líntán Bǎojiù Shī** (Altar Guardian and Recommender), **Tàishàng Língbǎo Wúshàng Dòngxuán Fǎshī** (Supreme Sacred Treasure of the Highest Cavern), **Yuánfú Wànníng Gōng Zhīguān** (Official of the Ten-Thousand-Nurturing Palace), **Chōngmiào Dàshī** (Master of Supreme Harmony), **Rén Yuánfù**, **Jiāndù Shī** (Degree Master), **Máo Shān Jīngqiān Sìshísì Dài Sìjiào Zōngshī** (Thirty-Fourth Generation Successor-Teacher of the Teachings from Máo Mountain Scripture Signet), **Shàngqīng Sāndòng Fǎshī** (Supreme Purity Three Caverns Master), **Guǎnxiá Yuánfú Wànníng Guān Míngyī Dàshī** (Master of the Ten-Thousand-Nurturing Palace), **Cìzǐ** (Purple Robe), **Xué Rǔjǐ**, **Chéngyì Láng** (Attendant of the Imperial Council), **Zhī Jiànkāng Fǔ Jùróng Xiànshì** (Magistrate of Jùróng County, Jiànkāng Prefecture), **Jiānguǎn Nèi Cuànnóng Yíngtián Gōngshì** (Overseeing Internal Encouragement of Agriculture and Farming), **Zhū Gǒng**, together inscribed this.\n\n---\n**Record of the White Cloud Chongfu Observatory**\n\n**Huīyuán Gé Xuéshì** (Scholar of the Splendid Designs Hall), **Zhèngyì Dàfū** (Honorable Official of Correctness), **Tízhǔ Yòushén Guān** (Overseer of the Auspicious Spirit Observatory), concurrently **Tàizǐ Jiànshì** (Grand Tutor to the Heir Apparent), **Jiānguǎn Guóshǐ** (Overseeing National Histories), **Jiānguān Shílù Yuàn Xiūzhuàn** (Concurrent Compiler of the Veritable Records), **Dài Xī** (of the Dai Stream), composed this.\n\n**Jùqū** (Sentence Bend), a renowned mountain on the **Jiāngnán** (Southern River) side, a **Dòngtiān Fúdì** (Celestial Cavern, Auspicious Land), where **Máo Jūn** (Master Máo) hid and ascended—thus it is called **Máoshān**.\n\nThere is the **Jījīnfēng** (Accumulated Gold Peak) facing west, and from its branch, a ridge rising particularly to the right—**BáiYúnfēng** (White Cloud Peak).\n\nFolklore and Daoist tradition recount that its grasses and trees wither later than others, and its mists and clouds are ever visible.

      "translated_text": "When Jingwen’s reputation for upright conduct and purity spread, he was granted the honor of inscribing the name *Chóngfú Guān* (Honored Blessing Hall) upon his dwelling, along with endowments of white gold and fertile fields to aid its completion. Thus, the altar platforms were erected, sacred images enshrined, and gateways raised like tripods, pavilions soaring like mist—grand and profound, corridors winding in layered embrace, multi-tiered halls and towering pavilions ascending in cloud-like majesty. A broad path was cleared before them, where pine and cypress marched in orderly ranks, like banners and canopies.\n\nThere was the **Chìshān Lake**, its expanse open and commanding, towering ridges and verdant peaks rising to either side—left and right, bowing in reverence, dense and boundless, their shadows weaving through the clear depths. To dwell or wander there was to escape the tumult, to tread upon the realm of the transcendent.\n\nWithin the **Fānghú Zhàngshì** (Square-Inch Chamber), he personally inscribed his brushstrokes, declaring the virtue of emptiness and stillness. Along with the imperial bestowals of the four dynasties since the Shàoxīng era—treasures, seals, and sacred stones bestowed upon mortals—he awaited one of great virtue and power to stir the winds and clouds, to gather the extraordinary, and thus fulfill his legacy.\n\nNow, his disciples reside here, seeking to honor him, yet only by returning to his original intent.\n\nThe great forests and mountains benefit humanity, yet even the divine cannot overcome them. Still, the Daoists take refuge within them. Those who once practiced the Dao abandoned worldly fame, power, wealth, and desire, focusing solely on refining body, heart, nature, and life—ever fearful of not delving deeply enough. When their practice was complete, they shed their mortal forms in an instant. Yet mortals, clamoring after what was abandoned, clinging to what was cast off, plaster over their traces, ring bells at their hidden depths, and echo their pure and modest virtues, hoping to find such men as before—only to be content with this.\n\nThey feed them, shelter them, adorn their clothing, food, and dwellings as the world does, only to be ensnared once more by fame, power, wealth, and desire. Where then is the Dao?\n\nThis mountain is not merely the legacy of **Máo Yǐn, the Two Xǔs, Yáng Xióng, and Táo Yuánmíng**—its land unchanged, where thatched huts and rustic doors once stood, where meals of mist and bamboo shoots were shared in obscurity, beyond mortal notice. Yet within, the **Dāntái Gǒnggōng** (Dan Platform, Vermilion Palace) and those who embrace jade and pearls remain. Those who open the White Clouds do not confine their legacy to external trappings for their descendants.\n\n**Xī Zhī**, a descendant of the same lineage, frequently traveled through these mountains, familiar with both the landscape and its people. The Daoist **Zhōu Guānfù**, a senior disciple of Jingwen, earnestly sought to record his master’s deeds. He thus commissioned Zhī to arrange his observations, appending his own reflections.\n\nGuānfù returned with this account, sharing it with his disciples, hoping it might serve as a warning, a return to the original path.\n\nRecorded on the **wǎn rì** (full moon) of the ninth month, **Jiādìng** **sìnián** (1211 CE).\n**Dòngyáng Guān Jì** (Record of the Cavern of the East).",

      "translated_text": "**Recorded in the *Mao Shan Zhi* (Teachings of the Twenty-Seventh Volume of the *Mao Shan Zhi*)**\n\n**Upper Clarity Successor Master** Liu Dabin constructed [the temple].\n\n---\n\n**Record of the Golden and Stone Inscription**\n*Yuan Dynasty Stele*\n*Inscription of the Hua Yang Dao Yuan (Daoist Temple)*\n\nThe **Hanlin Direct Scholar, Court Official, and Keeper of the Imperial Edicts** Yuan Mingxian composed it, while the **Hanlin Attendant Scholar, Middle Order Official, and Keeper of the Imperial Edicts** Zhao Mengfu inscribed it.\n\nThe **Daoist adepts** follow the tradition of **符錄 (symbolic records)**, claiming they can summon the winds and thunders, command spirits and ghosts, and some may doubt this. **Dao/Way and humanity are one**; when cold, the body shivers; when hot, the body perspires. This is because **形 (form)** is what **天 (Heaven)** manifests, and what surrounds **形 (form)** is none other than **天 (Heaven)**. Thus, it is said that at the juncture of **Dao/Way and humanity**, there is only **感 (response)** and **應 (correspondence)**.\n\nOnly when a person’s **氣 (qi)** is perverse does it begin to diverge from **天 (Heaven)**. Even a foolish man or woman, with a single resolute thought, can stir movement. How much more so for **高人德士 (noble virtuous ones)**, dwelling in solitary halls, refining their practices with utmost purity, where their will is set—**天 (Heaven)** will never defy them.\n\nIn the time of the **World Ancestor Emperor (世祖皇帝)**, Master Xu of **Jouqu (句曲)** came to court. When he **梼 (invoked)** disaster, it **應 (responded)**. The Emperor was astonished and specially ordered him to oversee the temple rituals and continue the **符錄 (symbolic records)** tradition. As Master Xu was about to ascend, he pressed his seal upon the **待 (awaiting)** hands of the present Lord Wang until he arrived to receive it.\n\nIn the **second year of the Great Virtue (大德二年)**, locusts plagued **Huainan (淮南)**. The **宣慰使 (Commissioner of Pacification)** of this **道 (Daoist region)** respectfully invited Lord Wang to Jiangdu, where he performed **醮 (ritual exorcism)** to avert the calamity. Soon, the locusts that had not yet sprouted wings were choked by the rain, and those that had wings were struck by a sudden wind that darkened the sky. They pecked at the locusts, ate them, then spat them out—pecking and spitting in cycles over several days. The locusts did not become a disaster.\n\nBefore this, when the drought **梼 (invoked)** rain, the people of **Huainan (淮南)** were greatly alarmed and delighted. They competed to offer gold and silk, worshipping and kneading it in reverence, but he refused none, and those who escorted him filled the road. On his return, he said: *“Do I truly need the rain to cease?* My sincerity alone suffices to fulfill my **法 (Daoist method)**.”\n\nWhen he **二 (twice)** achieved swift responses and saved countless lives across several prefectures, it was truly because **三茅君 (San Mao Jun, the Three Venerable Masters of Mao Shan)** had guided him. Moreover, the **宝运 (auspicious era)** was flourishing—how could there be starving people? The gold and silk he received, if stored in his coffers, would be a fortunate gain. I, in my separate dwelling, pray to the Three Venerable Masters on behalf of the nation, and also worship my two parents to repay their private blessings. This, perhaps, is fitting.\n\nThat year, he thus **遂 (completed)** the construction at the **束 (eastern side)** of the **Yuanfu (元符) Hall of Ten Thousand Tranquilities (万宁宫)**, gazing upward at the **枫轮 (crimson wheel, i.e., the sun)**, downward at the **金菌 (golden fungi, i.e., the moon)**. The mountain found its proper place, and the temple was forever established. The **限 (boundaries)** of the sacred site were refined into elegance, perfectly suited to the terrain. Neither frugality led to vulgarity nor excess to disorder. A total of over fifty halls were built, with **San Mao Jun** enshrined in the main hall and their **考妣 (ancestors)** in the side chambers.\n\nFrom the laying of the foundation to the completion of the work, it took six years. The temple was named **Hua Yang Dao Yuan (華陽道院)**.\n\nIn the **third summer of the Great Virtue (至大三年)**, the Emperor commanded the **Upper Clarity Successor Master (上清嗣宗师)**, the **Hao Zhenren (昊真人)**, to perform **醮 (ritual exorcism)** in **Jiangnan (江南)**, beginning at **Jouqu (句曲)**. Lord Wang traveled near **Jingkou (京口)**, and the **Hao Zhenren (昊真人)** said: *“The incense and offerings you have prayed to in court, I will now receive with my hands. I dare not disrespect them.”* As the **暑雨 (summer rains)** were relentless, he requested that the next day’s rites would reach **Yuanfu (元符)**. If the rain persisted, even a drop would be a shame to the **神 (divine)**.\n\nLord Wang replied: *“I dare not fail to respect your words.”* The following day, the rain barely ceased. After the offerings were made, it poured heavily during the rites, then stopped again. The **Hao Zhenren (昊真人)** returned to court and, in detail, recounted Lord Wang’s deeds as above, and thus sought an inscription for **Hua Yang (華陽)**.\n\nI heard that Lord Wang was **简 (modest)** yet **章 (illustrious)**, **庄 (serene)** yet **和 (harmonious)**, **静 (still)** yet **动 (active)** with perfect balance. He was truly a **道君子 (Daoist noble)**. Thus, when he **出言 (uttered words)**, calamities were averted; when he **有梼 (invoked disaster)**, the divine became manifest; when his **功 (deeds)** were complete, he did not claim credit; when his **德 (virtue/power)** was fulfilled, his humility only increased. Therefore, the Emperor granted him the title of **养素通真明教真人 (Nourishing Virtue, Penetrating Truth, Illuminating Daoist Master)**.\n\n**Jouqu (句曲)** has long been a **名山 (famed mountain)**. The **高人德士 (noble virtuous ones)** who dwell there, because of its secluded depths and worldly isolation, its tumultuous distance from the near, halt their **灵光 (spiritual brilliance)** to cultivate enlightenment and appreciation. Having recorded his deeds, I further inscribed these words, echoing the **步虚 (Ascending the Void)** hymns and capturing his **闲远 (tranquil and distant)** thoughts.\n\nLord Wang’s name was **Dao Meng (道孟)**, with the sobriquet **Mu Zhai (牧斋)**. He was from **Juchong (句容)** in **Jiankang (建康)**, the **四十四代宗师 (forty-fourth generation successor master)**.\n\n**Inscription:**\n*The towering and dim Jouqu (句曲) mountain,*\n*Where the gods and immortals dwell beneath clouds,*\n*Its purple banners and feathered canopies unfurled,*\n*The carp vanish suddenly—where do they flee?*\n\n*The **通真真人 (Tong Zhen Zhenren)** refines the **元精 (original essence)**,*\n*Feasting on mist and inhaling **氣 (qi)**—his complexion now clear.*\n*He lingers in **Yanggu (陽谷)**, blowing the jade flute,*\n*His **瑶装 (jade adornments)** and cranes in the **Kunlun (昆仑)** courtyard.*\n\n*When disaster looms, he spreads his wings to transform the world,*\n*When peace is restored, he stores blessings for the **天明 (Heavenly Clarity)**.*\n\n*His distant heart seeks **Penglai (蓬瀛)**,*\n*Handholding **青芝 (bluegrass, i.e., sacred herbs)** before the **丹经 (Cinnabar Scripture)**.*\n\n*At the **琼都 (Jade Capital)**, I gather these words,*\n*Greatly summoning the **真倡 (True Procession)** to touch the **幽灵 (profound spirits)**.*\n\n*Here, clarity and tranquility require no exertion,*\n*No disturbance—your **精 (essence)** can thus attain **長生 (longevity)**.*\n\n*Below, the dusty world is plagued by a hundred woes,*\n*Drunkenness and death in dreams—alas for short-lived suffering.*\n\n*In the **重阴 (dense shadows)**, no altar gazes upon the sun and stars,*\n*Yet those with desire may seek this inscription.*\n\n**Inscription of the Jouqu Mountain Cave and Spring:**\n*In the **泰定甲子 (Tai Ding Jia Zi, 1324)** year, the **玉虚子 (Yu Xu Zi, Jade Void Master)** constructed [this].\n\n**Mao Shan’s Three Mountains and the Luo Luo Peaks.**\n**The Great Dipper and Little Dipper**, mirroring the **七宫 (Seven Mansions)**.\n**Upper Clarity has its altar**, high and central.\nThe mountain bends to contain, the waters flow to pay homage.\n\nI cultivated the **華池 (Hua Pool)**, its inner landscape harmonizing.\nAt the **艮 (Kan, northwest)** it stands still,\nBlocking the **兌 (Dui, southeast)** void.\nThe **丹井 (Cinnabar Well)** flows westward,\nThe **石梁 (Stone Beam)** stretches eastward.\n\nThe **玄師 (Mysterious Master)** had his works,\nOmen of this **灵综 (profound convergence)**.\nStoring the **玉浆 (jade nectar)**, once used by **奚穷 (Qi Qiong, a legendary immortal)**.\nBenefiting all things, **Dao/Way** does not speak of merit.\n\n**Inscription of the Blessing Village Well:**\n*Only the **萧 (Xiao, a surname)** has a **台 (platform)**,*\n*By **曲水 (bending waters)**,*\n*The well’s **梵 (sacred)** essence unchanging,*\n*My thoughts turn to **若人 (such a one)**.*\n\n*Who is **若人 (such a one)**?*\n*His peers are **桐梧 (Tong Wu, legendary immortals)**.*\n\n*He received the **教 (Daoist teachings)** of **Hua Yang (華陽)**,*\n*And spread blessings to the **近 (nearby)** **丹丘 (Dan Qiu, Cinnabar Mound)**.*\n\n*His blessings endure for a hundred generations,*\n*Like **金玉 (gold and jade)**.*\n\n*This is called **正明 (True Clarity)**,*\n*And all receive its blessings.*\n\n**Inscription of the Great Dao Altar:**\nThe **Upper Clarity True Master (上清真人)**, **Pan Zunshen (潘尊师)**, embodied the **玄 (Mysterious)**, and built the **弘道坛 (Great Dao Altar)** at the **嵩 (Song) mountain’s** southern slope.\n\nThe **外史 (Outer Historian, i.e., Lord Wang)** of **Jouqu (句曲)**, with **基石 (foundation stones)** aligned to **Dao/Way**, restored the ancient ways and enshrined the **圣神 (Sacred Spirits)**.

      "translated_text": "「In tracing the legacy of the Jin people, only this place and the residence of the Master of Xu, Master Yuchen, remain.\n\nYet what I have undertaken here is to restore and expand the neglected and humble structures—is this not my responsibility? Thus, I assessed the materials and gathered the workers, transforming the rear hall into the **Great Primordial Hall** (太元殿) to revive its former grandeur and enshrine the **Three Masters of Mao** (三茅君) within. To the east, I built the **Shrines of the Five Masters: Ren, Hua, Wang, Li, and He** (任、华、王、李、贺五君祠), and to the west, the **Shrine of Tao Yinjü** (陶隐居祠).\n\nI filled the foundation of the front hall to create the **Grand Dao Platform** (弘道坛), and inscribed a eulogy upon it myself.\n\nTo the north of the platform, I established the **Shrine of the Dark Warrior** (玄武祠), to the west, the **Shrine of Broad Benevolence** (广惠祠), and behind it, the **Literary Virtue Lecture Hall** (文贤讲堂), while at the front stands the **Main Gate** (都门).\n\nBeyond the gate, I dredged the ancient **Jade Spring Pool** (古玉津池), collecting all the waters from the southern slopes of Damao Mountain.\n\nFollowing the pool’s southwestern edge, I discovered the **Reading Platform of Master Zhaoming** (昭明太子读书台).\n\nBeside the platform lies a well called the **Well of Fukang** (福乡井)—Fukang, as it derives its name from the **Dao Retreat of Master Zhaoming** (昭明道馆).\n\nClearing the thickets and wild growth, I marked the site with inscriptions and stones, sheltering them under pavilions. All the scenic rock formations, caves, and springs within a hundred paces, I surveyed and recorded them as worthy of observation.\n\nIn the first year of **Taiding** (泰定), the **Master of Shangqing**, the forty-fifth generation **Master Liu Dabian** (刘君大彬), came to the capital, and I reported to him the details of my work, so that he might approve the sequence.\n\n**Zhang Jun** (张君), a native of the **Hao Commandery** (昊郡), was named **Tianyu** (天雨), with his inner name **Zhizhen** (嗣真), courtesy name **Boyu** (伯雨), and alternate sobriquet **Zhengju** (贞居). At twenty, he abandoned his family to embrace the **Dao/Way** (道), wandering through the renowned mountains of **Tiantai** (天台) and **Kechang** (括苍).\n\nA man from Hao, **Zhou Dajing** (周大静), was first a disciple of Master Xu and inherited the teachings of **Yang** (杨) and **Xu** (许). Zhang Jun followed him as a teacher, receiving all his doctrines. Once, he accompanied **Master Wang Shouyan of Kaiyuan** (开元王君寿衍) to the capital, where he was honored with imperial decrees and granted courier privileges. Though elevated by his teacher’s influence and appointed to office, this was not his true aspiration. He then swore never to seek advancement, and in response to the **Three Masters of Mao’s** (三茅) summons, he descended to serve the Five Masters—**Ren, Hua, Wang, Li, and He** (任、华、王、李、贺)—composing a declaration to that effect. He vowed to dedicate his full strength to this sanctuary, and his works include *The Outer Historian’s Mountain World Collection* (《外史山世集》) in three volumes, *The Record of Mystic Gatherings at Biyuan* (《碧岩玄会录》) in two volumes, and *The Chronicle of Mountain Seeking* (《寻山志》) in fifteen volumes, all marked by meticulous research and vast erudition.\n\nAh! Since Master Ren first resided here, spanning nearly five hundred years, only five individuals have succeeded in transmitting the legacy—what profound dedication to the distant future is this! How unlike later generations, who merely entice their disciples and bind them through personal ties, as if they were household servants or father-son relations!\n\nThus, I prefer to wait for those who share my vision of grandeur.\n\nNow, Zhang Jun has no prior imperial assistance to rely upon; clad in coarse robes and subsisting on simple fare, he labors here alone. Yet his heart is vast, and he contemplates aligning with scholars across the land to establish a foundation for the ages—is this not the spirit of a noble and magnanimous man? Therefore, I consider him a **secular friend** (方外友), admiring his foresight in reaching beyond my own.\n\nHence, I composed this poem in his honor:\n\n---\n**Damao’s Southern Slope**, where **Primordial Qi** (元气) gathers,\n**Yin Pass** (阴关) seals its gates, the **Yang Caverns** (阳洞) open wide.\n**Twisting Caverns** (曲穴) hold flowing springs, safeguarding this **Spiritual Retreat** (灵宅).\nMaster **Ren** (任君) comes to taste the **Yellow and Red Stones** (黄赤石).\n\n**Heaven’s Unity** (天一) bestows the **Great Primordial Seal** (太元册),\n**Qu’e** (曲阿) nurtures with discriminating care.\nThe **Hall’s Foundations** (构宫) stand firm, as decreed by Master **Wang** (王伯),\n**Pure Processions** (清跸) pause here, their **Spiritual Echoes** (灵响) resonant and refined.\n\n**Empty Forests** (虚林) flourish with crisp clarity, their splendor transformed,\n**Fukang’s** (福乡) imperial child bestows sweet nectar.\nHow many years without sustenance, yet his **Sacrificial Arms** (遗臂) remain steadfast,\n**White Clouds** (白云) mirror the void, where **Master Yuchen** (玉清客) dwells.\n\nIn **Kaiyuan’s** full vigor, the world was burdened with endless tasks,\nHolding the **Imperial Seal** (持节), he stood at noon’s height, offering incense to the **Dark Warrior** (熏璧).\nSince then, the age has declined, generations have passed in isolation,\n**Stone Mirrors** (石镜) bear inscriptions, while **Earthly Demons** (土漫画) deface them.\n\nWho now revives the ancient customs? Only **Zhang Jun, the Outer Historian of Qu’e** (句曲外史), whose **crown of excellence** (美冠乌) shines brightest.\nHe pored over a thousand volumes, his **innocence** (天真) and **spiritual lineage** (玄系) traced in careful succession.\n\nWithin the **Jade Chamber and Golden Hall** (玉室金堂), there is no lack of instruction.\n---\n**The Chronicle of Mao Mountain, Volume Twenty-Seven** concludes.\n**The Chronicle of Mao Mountain, Volume Twenty-Eight** begins.»",

gaze—Jiangnan’s peaks are snowbound,\nThis sorrow lingers, who shall bear its weight?\nIn vain I follow the grass-clad clerk, never idle,\nWhile with the scholars I’ve been long parted.\nHearing you sit in quiet, lost in books,\nPlanting trees and thatching reeds at your old home.\nAll day the white clouds drift by—enough to content,\nNext year’s fragrant grasses, what will they bring?\nLife’s cares press heavy, unfulfilled,\nEven public doors cannot fully spare.\nWhen will the spring wind bear my boat home?\nFirst tell me of Huayang’s cave—deep or shallow?\n\n---\n\n**Sending Zhang Daoist Back to Teahill Mountain**\nAlone toward the mountain, one man walks,\nNear the grotto, a crane greets him alone.\nOnly white letters pass to his disciples,\nAnd white stones earn him the title *Master*.\nEndless peach trees clothe the green hills,\nMoonlit fields await the plow’s return.\nLong he served the Lesser Lord,\nNow he follows Mao’s node to Qingcheng’s peak.\n\n---\n\n**Sending Zheng the Outer Official to Teahill Mountain**\nI see your whole family depart—\nWho knows when you’ll return?\nWhite clouds greet the valley’s mouth,\nFlowing waters ask of those within.\nCrowns and robes cast aside,\nDivine affairs fill the mountain.\nThere must be treasures unseen,\nWhy value just a body’s ease?\n\n---\n\n**Sending Zheng the Second to Teahill Mountain**\nThe stream cuts through the ravine,\nAll day the grass grows long.\nDeep in the mountain at spring’s end,\nDogs bark, cranes cry.\nWhere are the mulberry rows,\nPlanted by whom in vain?\n\n---\n\n**Mountain Residence—Miscellaneous Notes**\n*(by Gu Kuang)*\nThe Teahill Immortal descends from his thatched hall,\nSerene and secluded in the hidden realm.\nYang Jun’s leisurely law ascends,\nThe Lord of Fate halts the flowing years.\nPeach blossoms gather at the water’s edge,\nWindow frames the willow valley’s mist.\nHolding my grandson, I watch the trees grow,\nLeaning on my staff, I ask of the plowed fields.\nLet worldly affairs disturb no more,\nFloating fame may fade to one side.\nFrom old, like Xie Anshi,\nHe never sought the elixir’s spring.\n\n---\n\n**Peach Blossom Ravine**\nAt Peach Blossom Ravine, I meet a maiden’s veil,\nBetween the trees, apricot leaves fall on the altar.\nAn elder hands down the *Upper Purity Register*,\nNight’s step on the Void Mountain—chill as moon.\n*(Note: \"Upper Purity\" refers to Daoist scriptures of high attainment.)*\n\n---\n\n**New Dwelling on Great Teahill Mountain, Remembering My Lost Son Who Followed the Dao**\nThe valley raven still calls for my child,\nThe mountain man weeps at dusk.\nAcross life and death, my heart aches,\nIn vain I climb these heights.\nThe gate is barred with sorrow,\nWest River’s grief runs deep.\nFrom ancient times, the Middle Way was lost,\nOnly in scriptures do we seek it now.\nThe Great Symbol never ceases,\nSwiftly it shapes past and future.\nHis early death was no misfortune,\nHis body refined by the Dark Yin.\nWho would dare climb the Cloud Stairs,\nLike gold forged in fire?\nThe empty hall keeps his old notes,\nThe grotto’s room hides his idle lute.\nSpring’s sources rise at Fangzhu’s peak,\nAbove, the empty green pines.\nAs if dreams and waking merge,\nThe faint, lonely sounds drift.\nSoft grass covers the riverbank,\nFresh clouds hover, light as mist.\nThe sun’s farewell paints the scene anew,\nWaves clasp the shore in rippling cries.\nThe stone cave cradles a cloud’s nest,\nFar off, the southern peak stands lone.\nGrief and regret now sever,\nNo dust can stain this stillness.\nTrue quiet shifts in an instant,\nSitting or rising, all is one.\n\n---\n\n**Two Poems on Returning to Peach Blossom Ravine**\nA wasted life, now broken,\nLater years may fade as swiftly.\nPoets lament the wind and rain,\nWhen will the long night end?\nNo ties to the court’s affairs,\nFew dreams of home’s return.\nNo aid in midlife’s struggles,\nI choose stillness, forget the world’s noise.\nFair scenes turn to heavy shade,\nThe grotto’s mountain stands alone.\nIf the spirit tide bears word,\nSend thanks to the west-flying crow.\n\n---\n**The First Poem:**\nMorning, I meet my beloved beneath the green trees,\nSeated where blossoms blush.\nEvening, I wait for my beloved,\nRain flies, drenching the green pavilion.\nWhere is my beloved’s home?\nMidnight’s heart is lonely.\nI recall the flowers just opening,\nNow shocked to see the leaves fall.\nRiding through the deer’s spring stream,\nOutside, the twin seas’ cranes call.\nMy wishes have their source,\nHow can I dwell in such thinness?\n\n---\n**The Second Poem:**\n*(as above)*\n\n---\n\n**Inscribed on Lu Daoist’s Chamber**\nAutumn’s pestle echoes on the fallen wood,\nSitting with the Teahill Master.\nOnly two boys stand outside,\nDrawing water where the flowers bloom.\nThe empty altar basks in white daylight,\nThe divine tripod sends phoenix sand aloft.\nDust trails sweep the frost-kissed grass,\nGolden bells chime in the clear, high sky.\nThe chapter above separates from the mundane,\nI watch the chessboard’s shade slant.\nBowing, I ask of the Dao’s essence,\nYellowroot’s flower may be my feast.\n\n---\n\n**Recalling the Mountain**\nSpring returns, yet I cannot return,\nMy home lies deepest in the hills.\nThe orchid garden’s spring is damp,\nMoonlight maps the idle window’s pane.\nMy small fields border the valley’s mouth,\nMy humble duties I ask of others.\nWhere I go, there is no strife,\nHeavy gates lock the secluded path.\n\n---\n\n**Sending Li Daoist Back to Peach Blossom Ravine**\nWasted years in the human realm,\nThe Dao’s source still waits.\nEnvy your bamboo staff,\nAs you leave, hidden in Peach Blossom’s shade.\nThe crow departs—does it know the way?\nClouds fly, as if they remember home.\nDo not fret over changing hair,\nThe Purple River’s elixir remains.\n\n---\n\n**Midnight Gazing at the Immortal’s Observatory**\nAt dusk, the crow returns with flowers in its beak,\nUnder moonlight, the green mountains rise.\nI know the jade maiden’s window trees,\nOnly immortals may climb.\n\n---\n\n**In Reply to Wei Xiaqing on His Return to Teahill Mountain, Also Commemorating Lady Jing’s Name**\nThe Jade Emperor dwells in the Golden Gate,\nTo which sacred peaks does he pay homage?\nHis edicts still strike fear,\nYet divine logic transcends even that.\nThe Crane Temple’s new home is near,\nThe Dragon Gate’s old land lies far.\nMy departing spirit lingers,\nThe grotto’s flute plays on.\n\n---\n**Sending Gu Kun Back to Teahill Mountain**\n*(by Wei Xiaqing)*\nIn this sacred age, you are exiled,\nThe Void Sovereign makes you his minister.\nThe Law is revered,",

essence is unmatched.**\n**Green essence rice steams as clouds invade the tortoise’s shell,**\n**White hemp cloak shines—snow splashes against the window.**\n**Bamboo-lattice windows reflect sunlight, inked with countless words,**\n**Winter’s *wèijiān* tea simmers in two or three jars.**\n**The mandarin fish is indeed your family’s flavor,**\n**Do not forget the Song Jiang taste when recalling the Han River.**\n\n---\n\n**In Reply to Broad Literature**\n*(by Lu Guimeng)*\n\nI do not know where the hidden Heaven lies,\nYet wish to linger in the twin traces of mist and clouds.\nThe crane’s pavilion cannot yet match the moon’s chariot,\nThe deer’s gate merely hopes to share the cloud-window’s fame.\nMoss clings to the crumbling steps, my mulberry sandals shift,\nSpring wine soaks into the flowers, filling stone jars to the brim.\nDo not pity my carefree hair for fishing companions,\nEven the East Seal’s waters should have more than enough.\n**Sending Rùnqīng’s Regards to Hua Yang**\n\n*(by Pi Ri-xiu)*\n\nSnow beats the boat, leaving the wine banner behind,\nThe Hua Yang recluse returns half-drunk from his journey.\nLeisurely wanderings fear only meeting the Cloud Official,\nSerene tranquility should surely invite the Moon’s Consort.\nThe immortal market’s deer-flesh tender as velvet,\nThe shadow realm’s swallow-meat rich as butter.\nThe public carriage’s grass mats rot from overuse,\nYet none can stop him from flying in broad daylight.\n\n*(Same theme as above)*\n\n*(by Lu Guimeng)*\n\nWhy does the light boat linger near the return of the cold?\nThe brothers of the bamboo grove await your coming.\nThe jade grotto’s seals are hollow—no music resounds,\nThe frost altar’s wine cups are muddy with lingering dregs.\nThe Cloud Lodge’s Master shares the *qì* of harmony,\nThe Mountain Diagram’s Scholar loves words and talent.\nI urge you to recommend me to the Eastern Official,\nThe snow-swept hall’s true treasures are hidden in plain sight.\n**To Rùnqīng of Hua Yang After His Return**\n\n*(by Pi Ri-xiu)*\n\nSpring’s hues melt into the thawing pond,\nSunlight bright—idle swallows perch on the rock’s chamber.\nThe jade box opens in quiet, no one witnesses,\nThe golden nectar first shared with the crane.\nEightfold scriptures’ old texts often copied by the bedside,\nSevenfold precepts’ lost edicts pondered in leisure.\nI do not know where dreams may lead me to,\nRed medicine fills the mountain—moon and clouds perfume the air.\n\n---\n\n**To Rùnqīng, Expressing My Regards**\n\n*(by Lu Guimeng)*\n\nThe crane’s pavilion—when will the immortal descend?\nHis pupils bright as water, his brow serene.\nHe does not pass on Yang’s chariot in dreams,\nNor does he allow mortals to question the Oracle’s whispers.\n\n*(In reply)*\n\n*(by Pi Ri-xiu)*\n\nYang’s chariot has already vanished into the mist,\nThe *Bóshān* incense still lingers in the haze.\nI do not know if he will come tonight,\nSo I first carve the red wax—five divisions.\n\n*(In answer)*\n\n*(by Zhāng Bēn)*\n\nThe immortal’s song has no need to visit Cai’s scriptures,\nTwice the *Shàohuò* wine flows from the crimson court.\nIf mortals gaze upward from the tower’s height,\nShould they not marvel at the *Wénxīng* near the *Kèxīng*?\n\n**Thanks to Rùnqīng for His Kind Letter and Tea**\n\n*(by Pi Ah-xiu)*\n\nThe Three Officials’ tea is passed on by name,\nThe Great Yuezhi hears it said—there are immortals among you.\n\n---\n\n**Again to Rùnqīng**\n\n*(by Pi Ri-xiu)*\n\nHigh sleep may serve as the essential *Xuānxiōng* incense,\nThe magpie-tailed golden censer burns through one’s lifetime.\nThose outside the dust know only the chance of fate,\nThe mountain’s true landlord is the Lord of the Bamboo.\nTo gather mushrooms, one must guard against the snow,\nTo dry books, one cannot bear the clouds.\nIf Hua Yang were to stay forever beyond the world,\nWho would compose the *fēngxiān* texts for the Han dynasty?\n\n**Responding to Xí Měi’s Use of My Earlier Rhyme**\n\n*(by Zhāng Guì)*\n\nI suspect Heaven has not yet lost this refined culture,\nSo I choose the Hua Yang peak to send my regards to the White Cloud.\nAfter drinking, only the Stork Sea’s guest remains,\nBefore the incense, only the Purple Yang’s Lord appears.\nIn recent years, I have abandoned my love of poetry,\nToday, I even burn my brush and inkstone.\nFor this mortal body, suffering still persists,\nI do not know which is the true *Xuānxiōng*.\n\n*(In reply)*\n\n*(by Lu Guimeng)*\n\nSuddenly, you leave the bright Master’s sacred service,\nTaking the Jiang Ba path straight into the clouds.\nWhen bowing to the dragon’s seal, your light command is given,\nAfter donning the rainbow robes, your small *Xuānxiōng* is revealed.\nBefore the peak, the Northern Emperor holds the Three Officials’ gathering,\nOn the stone, the *Shùqīng* is bound with the Nine Sacrificial texts.\nYou laugh at the world’s cravings for fame and gain,\nYet your spirit palace still lingers in plain sight.\n\n**Wénqiáo Invites Rùnqīng, Who Declines with the Excuse That a Daoist Friend Is Coming**\n\n*(by Pi Ri-xiu)*\n\nWhen will the immortal descend from his crane’s feathers?\nHis pupils round like water, his brow pure as jade.\nHe does not pass on Yang’s chariot in dreams,\nNor does he allow mortals to question the Oracle’s whispers.\n\n*(In reply)*\n\n*(by Zhāng Bēn)*\n\nThe immortal’s song has no need to visit Cai’s scriptures,\nTwice the *Shàohuò* wine flows from the crimson court.\nIf mortals gaze upward from the tower’s height,\nShould they not marvel at the *Wénxīng*

Zhāng Bēn’s Offering of *Xùnfàn***\n*(by Pi Ri-xiu)*\n\nThe *Xùnfàn* is made from *Qīnglóng* rice, pure as mist-driven clouds,\nAnd folded with *Zǐzhēng* stalks—\nThe *Nánzhú* wine glows faintly purple, steaming where no double cranes dare tread,\nFor fear that the Five Clouds might rise from its depths.\n\nThe empty hall sits void of hunger’s hue,\nAs I rinse my throat with golden elixir’s flow—\nA single voice.\n\n---\n\n**In Reply to Zhāng Bēn’s Offering of *Xùnfàn***\n*(by Lù Guìmēng)*\n\nI’ve heard of the *Jīnxī*’s fragrant Daoist feast,\nNow see the *Qīngjīng*’s jade-hammered meal.\nI laugh at my reflection, no bones to record,\nYet might ascend the *Zǐxiā* heights on wings.\n\n---\n\n**Sending Minister Zhāng to Game Teag Mountain**\n*(by Pi Ri-xiu)*\n\nYour noble bearing is worthy of a fine ladle’s tilt,\nTo seek the *Ér Xǔ*’s home after the *Yáng’ān*’s meal.\nThe mountain’s shadow late reaches the golden well’s water,\nIts spirit guards the jade gate’s sands.\n\nAfter the empty wine vessel’s rites, the incense mother dissolves,\nWhen the green cave’s glow touches the milky dew.\nWait till you become the *Tíngwèi* of the court,\nThen need not return to the *Fēngxiā* feast.\n\n---\n\n**In Reply to Minister Zhāng’s Journey to Teag Mountain**\n*(by Lù Guìmēng)*\n\nYour lineage’s fame soars high above the world,\nYet still your Daoist descendants serve as ministers.\nYou’ll ride beneath the feathered canopy, bowing at the jade gate,\nOnce wore the fish talisman at the *Chìchéng*’s red peak.\n\nThe frost still clings to the lone stone’s hue,\nThe snow lingers, echoing the ancient pine’s voice.\nKnow that the *Sìshàn*’s scriptures hold their secrets,\nAwaiting your return to bloom the jade grasses.\n\n---\n\n**Sent to My Daoist Friend Hé**\n\nAll my life I’ve upheld the jade precepts,\nYet the red talismans still wait to be passed on.\nHow much more so since we once shared the same lodging,\nAnd now part ways, years drift between.\n\nAsking of your face, I find it even more refined,\nListening to your discourse, my thoughts soar beyond the mist.\nYour ancient texts drip with morning dew,\nYour new verses rise, untainted by smoke’s breath.\n\nBees provide sweet honey in measured servings,\nHumans send coins to buy the mountain’s shade.\nThe purple swallow nests long in the cavern’s depths,\nThe green turtle suddenly ascends the lotus.\n\nThe basket holds the edicts for recluse-seekers,\nThe pouch carries the *Shuòshēng*’s sacred scrolls.\nThe garden warms, the *Zhītái*’s sprouts gleam,\nThe cliffs bloom, the *Rúguǎn*’s dew rounds like pearls.\n\nIn the forest, I dwell like Sunzi’s crane,\nIn the hall, I host brothers of the Dao.\nFortunate if I may peruse the *Língshū*’s pages,\nI yearn for but a single volume’s grace.\n\n---\n\n**Autumn Evening in the Daoist Palace**\n\nThe moon stands at noon, the mountain’s air empty—\nThe *Guìhuá* of the *Guìyáng* falls.\nThe stone altar’s incense drifts as I linger in vain,\nThe *Shānlíng*’s dew drips cold from the pine’s branch—\nA crane’s handle.\n\n---\n\n**Sent to My Daoist Friend, the *Huáyáng* Master**\n\nOutside the *Huáyáng* gate, the Five Herbs grow,\nAfter the meal, I fret your retreat into the distant void.\nAlone in the night, I still dream of you,\nYet when we met before, I forgot your form.\n\n*(Fragment)*\n\nFor the *Kēdòu*’s division, the leaden trench invades,\nYou speak of the *Bènggēng*’s seat at the bamboo’s peak.\nWhen will you return to the *Zǐgé*’s lofty halls?\nSince parting, I’ve spent the day reciting the *Huángtíng*.\n\nI leisurely teach the young apothecary to distinguish herbs,\nIn stillness, I recognize the crane’s return—\nIts surname is *Dīng*.\n\nThe deep ravine’s spring water is thick with the sheen of lamb’s fat,\nBeside the forest, I burn stones to summon wild smoke’s scent.\nThe valley’s echoes hum with the *Shūqìng*’s chime,\nA fleeting glimpse of mist’s light falls on the painted screen.\n\nNo need to seek the ancient texts in *Yǔxué*’s depths,\nNor carve new calendars—\nThe *Yáo*’s realm knows no such folly.\nThe *Zhūgōng*’s palace welcomes *Xiāoshǐ* with phoenix song,\nYet who among men will visit the *Cáijīng*’s scrolls?\n\nThe long black-green robes hang steady on the frame,\nThe small *Dānzhuàn* talismans lie potent on the desk.\nAt the *Níxuān*’s dawn, I enter the cave with the first moon,\nWith the *Yùjié*’s nodes, I ascend the altar to pay homage to the Seven Stars.\n\nOn the path alone, I stride past the *Hǔbào*’s charge,\nFacing the wind, my lone cry stirs the thunder’s might.\nMy spirit condenses in the sealed chamber—\nWhite as the frost, pure as the *Shūshì*’s lore.\nI weave your deeds into linked volumes—\nGreen as the *Jīng*’s ink, yet no trace remains.\n\nThe earth’s contours all darkly mirror your form,\nThe sky’s silence holds your resonant voice.\nI divide the fire’s strength to roast the golden tortoise,\nAnd brush away the moss’s stains to wash the wine cakes.\n\nOn the emerald walls, I chant from morn till night,\nBeside the warm clouds, I drink and wake in delight.\nI lean on my staff, its length measured by my mood,\nAnd borrow a guest’s height to build the thatched pavilion.\n\nI set you as the stern *Cháoběi Dì* of the north,\nAnd ask of the *Shùmiǎn*’s clear depths—\nWho will guard the evening’s retreat?\n\nOften I think of the garden’s near orchards,\nAnd plan to borrow the neighbor’s peak to gather *Lí*.\nI stake half the tree to the half-open door—\nCool and bright in the morning’s haze.\nBehind me, the zither’s strings hum faint,\nBeside the dimming candle, the dawn’s glow glitters.\n\nOnce, I knew *Wángměng* by his flea-picking,\nNow, I sigh like *Guǎnníng*’s dragon’s departure.\nThe *Chánpò*’s glow may yet visit my *Huì*’s curtain,\nBut my fishing rod alone rests on the *Fēngtíng*’s bank.\n\nThe fine grass drinks in the smoke’s breath—\nNo end to its emerald hue.\nThe idle flowers rise with the rain’s intent—\nFragrant as the morning’s dew.\nThe waves strike the shore, startling the *Fěicuì*’s flight,\nThe sunlight slants through the curtains, hindering the *Qīngtíng*’s path.\n\nAt first, I was summoned to the *Hàn*’s mountain passes,\nNow, I await the day to break the *Yànshān*’s seals.\nThe six reins still loose on the thousand-mile steed,\nA single pouch holds but the autumn’s fireflies.\n\nI grieve the *Wángměng*’s true wisdom, left in the sleeves of the world,\nYet others hire the *Zhāngjiànfàn*’s talents—\nHeroic as the court’s grand feast.\nTogether we seek the deep ravine’s scattered woods,\nI ask but a single floating lotus from the *Cānghǎi*’s depths.\n\nOften I cast aside the world’s trivialities,\nMy heart clears, my gaze fades into the mist.\nAlready I’ve bought the flat-bottomed boat,\nTo bind the *Zhēnzhì*’s true precepts.\nWith Daoist texts in hand, I let the winds lift my vessel.\n\n---\n\n**Sent to Hé Wēiyí and Wèiyí of Teag Mountain (Two Poems)**\n\nThe great and small *Sānfēng* stand beside the *Jiǔhuá*,\nThe *Língzōng*’s threads now all belong to the Hé clan.\nIn *Hàn* times, the Daoist ascended with the crane’s clouds,\nIn *Shǔ* lands, the spring bloomed with the cave’s flowers.\n\nLeisurely I stand by the piled mists to seek the waterfall’s eye,\nThe frozen waves and scattered snow yield the *Zhī*’s sprouts.\nThese years, I’ve followed the *Huángtíng*’s teachings,\nEach evening, I refine my spirit, each morn, I drink in the clouds’ glow.\n\nOnce I asked men how to pay homage to the *Jiēní*,\nSuddenly I doubted—\nWas it through dreams that I reached the Daoist ranks?\nMy robes are light, drawn by the crane’s feathers,\nThe clouds’ mist swells my hair—\nHigh as the *Lùshí*’s deer’s antlers.\n\nThe mountain’s warmth spares no meat,\nOnly the peak’s *Jiǔ* is left.\nThe water’s chill lingers,\nStill the cave’s *Táo* falls.\n\nI’ve heard tales of your future quests for wonders,\nNow I feel my spirit fly each night in labor.\n\n---\n\n**Farewell to a Friend Retiring from Office into Teag Mountain**\n\nI call my boy to brush the dawn’s dust from my saddle,\nTo ascend the great *Máoshān*’s heights.\nThough my meager stipend ceases to sustain me,\nThe morning’s *Míngxiá*’s glow is ample feast.\n\nThe dark frost turns the pine’s leaves crimson,\nThe sparse rain chills the hall’s thatched eaves.\nAgain, I carve the *Zhōngfēng*’s stone,\nTo rebuild the altar where the moon is worshipped.\n\n---\n\n**Preface to the *Zhūqū*’s True Words**\n\nIn the twelfth month, on the second day,\nThe *Zhūqū*’s Daoist Master *Zhāozhēn* on the *Dàmáofēng*’s peak,\nWhere disciples from ten thousand miles gather to learn of the immortals.\nI, though distant from the *Huáyáng*’s heavens,\nHave only a single night’s journey by horse—\nA day’s dust—\nAnd cannot fulfill my wish to go.\nThus, I send my spirit each morning,\nAs if I already ascend with you.\nI composed the *Zhāozhēn*’s verses,\nOne for welcoming, one for farewell,\nTo ease my longing heart.",

      "translated_text": "**迎真**\nThe Nine-Hua bell tolls sharp against the chilled spring,\nTen thousand flags sway, damp with emerald mist.\nThe *Sīmìng*’s banner still hangs unlowered—\nIncense burns, I clutch my tablet, standing still in reverence.\n\nA dying star casts light upon my brocade hem,\nA crescent moon divides itself, yielding to the crane’s shadow.\nFrom the hollow cave, a sacred chant rings out—\nAnd spring awakens, awakening the valleys’ smoke and blossoms.\n\n**送真**\nThe coiled clouds loosen the phoenix’s hair,\nJade staff and iron rod held high, advancing first.\nThe *Cháozhēn*’s disciples stand silent, bowing twice—\nA jade cup brims with *hángméi* wine, its vapor rising.\n\nThe fire-bell clatters, the dragon-hair canopy leaps,\nGreen locks tumble, the *bìliàn* sash unfurls.\nIn an instant, all things dissolve—\nOnly the moon’s edge hums with the echo of a jingling belt.\n\n---\n\n**江南秋怀寄华阳山人**\n\nFrost grips my hair at dawn’s first light,\nYet my old land’s spirit still swells within me.\nMy heart longs to return in a single night,\nBut autumn’s sickness weighs me lighter than nine seasons.\n\nI rise to sing beneath the eaves,\nThen weep at the loom’s sad, measured hum.\nMountains invite me to retreat—\nYet what path leads to honor’s hollow gain?\n\nI trace my staff in vain, claiming fate,\nHold my rod but scorn its name.\nIf forgetfulness awaits me,\nThen laziness may yet find its ease.\n\nA narrow path parts the grass,\nA crooked door barely marks the years.\nThe lotus cups the morning dew,\nThe chrysanthemum sleeps in smoke’s embrace.\n\nI tune my strings to listen to the wind,\nSketch the waves to watch the sea’s calm.\nThe heron’s feathers drift white on the isle,\nThe fish’s tail parts the water’s pardon.\n\nThe courtyard orange bows for my scent,\nThe garden melon is plucked for the pot.\nThe crow pecks at my ink-stained table,\nThe field mouse gnaws the bookshelf’s edge.\n\nI plant beans and mourn the *Yáng*’s decline,\nCast melons and recall *Wèi*’s elegance.\nWho binds the neighbors as a recluse?\nThe *Nánguō* master stands alone.\n\nThe stars’ domains grow sparse and cold,\nThe mountains’ *guà* signs bring little luck.\nMy robes are coarse, my learning vast yet scattered—\nThe *Sāo*’s leaves cling to my sleeve,\nThe *Nèishǐ*’s broth warms my bowl.\n\nThough the *Ōuguān*’s hat suits the south,\nThe *Yánglào*’s cheese lacks refinement.\nI lean on my whistle, grief welling,\nDebate the *Dao*, then drain my cup.\n\nI linger, weary, beating the *gǔ* drum,\nA hero’s heart loves gold but scorns its cost.\nI pass the elixir’s furnace,\nTaste the tea, then test the stone’s worth.\n\nThe marsh hides the withered reeds,\nThe window frames the stripped *wú* tree’s glow.\nI mock *Zhāng Hàn*’s return to the south,\nYet lack *Mí Héng*’s talent to be envied.\n\nMy spirit fades with distant longing,\nMy resentment gnaws at my bones.\nA chipped whetstone proves the blade’s edge,\nA flawed mirror reveals the jade’s luster.\n\nThe *Dao*’s source flows thin and clear,\nScholarship thrives on sincerity alone.\nI dare not sigh at wasted years—\nBetter this than chaos’ fleeting rose.\n\n*Xiáng*’s fate was near death’s door,\n*Hàn*’s king still held his counsel tight.\nFeeding and flight are fated,\nPoverty and power are but shifting tides.\n\nThe shackled slave may rise to noble rank,\nThe jesting fool may earn the court’s favor.\nBathing in the sun, who measures its warmth?\nChasing the wind, who counts the miles?\n\nDust clogs my ears, divides my thoughts,\nMy liver and gall blend with the autumn’s chill.\nI urge *Shǔ* to seize the war’s command,\n*Ōu* alone asks for the general’s reins.\n\nA common man may leap in dance,\nTen thousand horsemen march in ranks.\nTo serve the state is lighter than wife and child,\nTo guard the border weighs more than plow and sword.\n\nSuddenly, the high cup is passed,\nI tire of the *Wǔhóu*’s fish too soon.\nSilent, I await the three moves’ decree,\nAt ease, I calculate the board’s end.\n\n*Sīmǎ*’s laws run deep,\n*Èrshī*’s might commands the troops.\nThe northern snow buries the beacon towers,\nThe winter cabbage splits the banner’s silk.\n\nSeizing the moment, I draft my decree,\nThat very day, I sweep the rebels clean.\n*Wǔ*’s old might still shakes the customs,\n*Wén*’s art now strings the eight chords.\n\nThe *Zhēn*’s jade is laid in order,\nThe *Xià*’s teachings take their first root.\nThe sprouts smother the demons’ schemes,\nThe pine and cypress stand firm in virtue.\n\nThe *Lángguān* bows in jade-laced halls,\nThe envoys wear embroidered robes to welcome.\nThe *Dàozǎng*’s path nears its dawn,\nThe *Jiāobō*’s waves grow smooth and still.\n\nThe scholar blushes to speak of conquest,\nThe worthy man scorns the *yǐn*’s deceit.\nWith staff in hand, I sing of the southern fields,\nMy muscles tense for the northern march.\n\nMy talent pales beside *Cáo Dòu*’s timidity,\nMy scrolls fill like *Huì Chē*’s carts.\n*Xiè* pities his brother’s daughter,\n*Hào*’s family treasures nephew and niece.\n\nOnly the *Huāngzhú*’s hall stands empty,\nNo gifts for the *Jǐngshān*’s spear.\nThe worthy’s reputation fades with distance,\nMy thoughts drift on the lake’s endless tide.\n\nThe rudder creaks, the ferry rocks,\nThe wild geese dip and rise in flight.\nThe late trees stand sparse in jade-green,\nThe strange peaks stretch in the clear sky’s light.\n\nThe water roars, the *zǐyīng* flowers twist,\nThe village echoes with the *xiāng*’s incense.\nThe fisherman’s hat seeks ancient traces,\nThe guard dog snarls behind the split fence.\n\nMy coarse linen wraps my shoulders,\nThe tax-grain’s green bags hang high.\nThe land yields its richness in abundance,\nIts people thrive in wealth and years.\n\nWhen friends gather, the wine flows freely,\nAlone, the years loom sharp and cold.\nThe cicadas’ chirp clings to the wall,\nThe balcony’s crane dances on the beam.\n\nThe garrison’s wind howls through the drums,\nThe neighbor’s moon stirs the *áizhēng*’s strings.\nWithout skill in letters, how claim clean pay?\nThe lead melts back to its ore,\nI wield the axe—*dīngdīng* sharp.\n\nI fear the carving’s rot,\nYet toil exceeds the jade’s worth.\nI focus my spirit on the evening’s bloom,\nStrain for the morning’s light.\n\nThe moth-eaten scrolls spill from the basket,\nThe frost-bound orange stands at dawn.\nThe quiet coral feeds the guest’s hunger,\nThe idle official scorns the historian’s pen.\n\nHeaven and earth stretch in silent sorrow,\nMountains and rivers shift unseen.\nWho can divide the *bì*’s blessings?\nWho dares equal *Páng*’s fate?\n\n*Xiàng* was no saint with his double pupils,\n*Kuí*’s single foot brought no shame.\n*Ruàn Yóu* drank deep of the *yáng*’s wine,\n*Zhuāng Yè* laughed at the *shāng*’s sacrifice.\n\nThe *páichǐ*’s teeth need no speech,\nA broad heart holds no grudge.\nBut take the furnace’s silk,\nReject the *wèilúo*’s snare.\n\nA single inkstone scrapes the pond’s roots clean,\nThe boat pushes through the dream’s grain.\nThe short letter’s bamboo is bound in green,\nThe low table holds the *fàn*’s red seal.\n\nThe frost’s message hastens the willows,\nThe smoke curls around the *dùjīng*’s stem.\nThe rafters cradle the swallows’ nest,\nThe screen frames the drunk *xīngxīng*’s sway.\n\nThe knots of the *huáng*’s shadow pile,\nThe flying spring sprays jade’s treasure.\nThe tangled vines seek near and far,\nThe bamboo frame holds the game’s win or loss.\n\nThe railing presses the *pībō*’s gourd,\nThe eaves drip the *yángléi*’s tangerines.\nI forget my sorrow with *Zōng Bǐng*’s gaze,\nMy illness lingers past *Liú Zhēn*’s verse.\n\nThe wild harvest boasts of *jùfàn*’s feast,\nThe *Jiāngshāng* sells the *zhè*’s arrow.\nI send the god’s robe with the clay drum,\nLeave the guest with the porcelain *yóu*.\n\nI raise the *jiān* to wield the green blade,\nBlow the *láng* to guide the distant light.\nThe crow’s flight darkens the sky’s pall,\nThe carp’s scales break the water’s calm.\n\nMy spear is not for battle’s hand,\nMy waist’s forge awaits the whetstone’s grind.\nFrost makes the reeds stand rigid,\nYet I seek the steel’s true ring.\n\nI sigh at the *chóng*’s sweet emptiness,\nThen turn to the *lù*’s bitter lotus.\nGrief stretches long, uncut,\nThe song ends—who will take it up?",

      "translated_text": "**The Golden *Xiè* Scroll: Poems of the Song Dynasty on a Journey to the Southern Xu Prefecture and Visiting Máo Mountain**\n\n**Fàn Zhòngyán**\nHow does the *Dānyáng* prefect’s resolve compare?\nFirst pay homage to the *Máo* sage, then disembark.\n\nWith three dismissals, your loyalty to the state now spent,\nYet five decades’ worth of heart you’ve lent to the Dao.\nYou seek the numinous herb and chance upon the *Zhī*’s grove,\nDesiring to knock upon the *Zhēn*’s gate and borrow the jade scroll.\nNo need to follow others to ask of the pass’s block,\nThe heavens decree that the officials hide you in the *xiān*’s abode.\n\n**To Zhang the Daoist**\nA guest in life loves white clouds,\nYet half his years still cling to the red dust.\nThe name still lingers on the golden tablets,\nAnd now he meets the jade-rocked sage of the *Máo*’s heights.\n\n**To Daoist Zhang Míngzhēn**\n*Liú Dàbēn*\nDull and serene, your bearing simple yet vast,\nYou dwell in a hut, seeking truth on the *Dà Máo* peak.\nSitting in forgetfulness, worldly cares should fade,\nYet the Dao’s path makes even words seem sluggish.\nA thousand miles’ trust arrives by crane’s flight,\nA single stove’s smoke and fire, the monkeys tend in lieu.\nWhen shall you return to serve the *Xūhuáng*’s carriage,\nWrapped in seven-hued robes, the nine-colored dragon’s kin?\n\n**Visiting Máo Mountain**\n*Téng Zōngliàn*\nWithin *Jǔqū*’s mountain lies an ancient *Dòngtiān*,\nGold halls and jade chambers linked by earthly fate.\nWhen the lotus seeds reveal the day’s falsehood,\nYou’ve already passed the *Máo*’s lord’s years of attainment.\n\n**To Zhang Míngzhēn**\n*Wáng Suí*\nYour *qi* refined, your face like cinnabar’s glow,\nYou hide in the clouds beside the *Dà Máo* peak.\nThe *Zhìrén*’s morning ritual passes on the numinous key,\nThe *Xiān*’s emperor once watched the dragon and bestowed his song.\nThe sacred scriptures lie asleep beneath the path’s grass,\nThe divine forms play in the pool’s waves, serpentine and slow.\nI shame myself—five steeds bring me from the dust’s embrace,\nYet one breath of the *xiān*’s wind is fortune enough.\n\n**Huáyáng Welcomes Guests**\n*Hú Sù*\nA humble guest in *Huáyáng*’s retreat,\nYears pass unmarked in mountain seclusion.\nIn wine, the sage’s presence lingers,\nYet at the board, not a trace of the *xiān*.\nI’ve mastered the *Guǎnglíng*’s scattered notes,\nAnd transcribed the *Qiūshuǐ*’s scroll.\nMy cap still bears no cleansing,\nShame fills the old groves and springs.\n\n**Ascending the Máo Peak (Three Poems)**\n*Wáng Ānshí*\nOne peak rises above all others’ heights,\nAs if the dusty road were thousands of miles apart.\nGazing down, the mists and clouds come not to their end,\nClimbing up, the vines and cranes leave no trace before.\nThey ask who has replaced the *Jiāpíng*’s sovereign,\nWho in the earth now knows of *Jǔqū*’s *Dòngtiān*?\nThe *Chén*’s border’s strife now grows wild with weeds,\nWhile the common crowd still clings to the master’s teachings.\nWith staff and sandals, I escape the clamor’s din,\nNo rooster’s crow, no dog’s bark—only silence remains.\nI seek the five *Zhī*’s stalks, their leaves now aged,\nYet still climb toward the three *Hè*’s distant flight.\nThe *Róngxī*’s shadow turns along the winding path,\nWhen the *xiān*’s wind blows, I fall like a woodcutter’s axe.\nAfter my exhilaration fades, the sun slants low,\nI return with sluggish steps, grinding moss for the past.\n\nI trace the vines until the path reaches midsky’s end,\nBelow, the *Máo*’s state lies lost in mist.\nThe true leisure of the *Wùwài* comes in few moments,\nYet men’s questions of honor I leave to *Língtōng*.\n\nWhere white clouds sit, the dragon’s pool vanishes,\nWhen the bright moon returns, the crane’s carriage is empty.\nLooking back, which of the three sages is truer?\nThe *Zǐfáng*’s lineage holds the highest wind.\n\n**Inscription on Xu’s Drill Marks Found on a Stone in Máo Mountain**\nA hundred years of wind and rain dim the moss,\nYet *Nán Táng*’s hand still lingers here.\nOnly fear that the stone’s fate shall end like its carvings,\nAs autumn’s west wind burns them all away.\n\n**Paying Homage to the Marvelous Daoist Master During His Noonday Sleep**\n*Zhāng Fāngpíng*\nOne pillow of pure wind stirs the quiet hall,\nCourtyard pines and cypresses shade in tangled gloom.\nNow the inner vision eludes all but the few,\nThe moon in the *níhuán*, the sun within the heart.\n\n**The Left-Nuanced *Cuì* Before the Jade Morning Hall**\n*Yáng Jié*\n*Huáyáng*’s mountain enfolds a thousand *guì*,\nYet one stands left-nuanced before the *Yùchén*’s hall.\nIts rainbow branches and dragon-like trunk face the morning glow,\nIts stature rivals the *sāng*’s, enduring through the ages.\n\n**The Golden *Cuì* at Bózhōu’s *Wō* Water: The Tàiqīng Palace**\nOld Master *Lǎozǐ* planted this tree in the ninth year’s spring,\nA single *guì* now shares its kindred root.\nIts stem is firm, its roots run deep—it should not wither.\nI know this blessed land holds sacred wood,\nPlanted once by the *Shàngzhēn*’s own hand.\nHave you not seen the dragon rise from flames,\nThe tiger born in water’s embrace?\nNature favors the left, not the right.\nAnd again—see how the *Tiānlún* turns left without cease,\nThe sun, moon, and five stars grind like ants.\nThe left-nuanced *guì* holds the Dao’s deepest truth,\nAnd those who grasp it shall not die.\n\n**Sending Master Dòngyuán Back to Máo Mountain (Three Poems)**\n*Cài Zhào*\nYour crimson banner flutters down from *Zǐqīng*,\nTo further refine your hidden Dao and mend your failing years.\nIf you meet the *Fāngzhàng* sage, he’ll surely greet you as elder brother,\nAnd from your satchel, the *Chìjiǎ*’s scroll shall emerge.\n\nThe *Chóngníng*’s new pavilion rises, cloud-linked,\nThe *Tiānzhuàn*’s seals float in the sky, their treasure-qi released.\nThe emperor sends the dragon’s host to guard it night and day,\nYet in the deep of the pool’s wind and rain, you return.\n\nOne hut once shared with the savage *Yǐnmán*,\nAncient trees hang with vines through years untold.\nPerhaps this is the *Sānshēng*’s law of dwelling,\nI’ll follow the staff’s twist and seek you again.\n\n**The Three *Máo*’s Wind and Rain (Illustration)**\nThe brush asks of the clouds to birth bold strokes,\nThe paper listens—can the pines’ voices be heard?\nI’ve captured the Three *Máo*’s wind and rain,\nAnd in the high hall, June’s chill is like an icy jar.\n\n**Gift to Wáng Quán (With Preface)**\n*Gōng Yuán*\nQuán, styled *Zǐzhēn*, guest of the *Fùjìng*’s lord.\nIn the *Yuánfēng* era, he was granted the title *Chōngzhào Chùshì*.\nIn the *Yuánsù*’s third year, he followed Master *Liú* to receive the *Shàngqīng Lù*.\n\n**Preface:**\nQuán,

remained sealed for a thousand years.\n\n**Huàyáng’s New Announcement: The Convenient Gate Opens**\nThe Convenient Gate of Huàyáng now stands revealed—\nSurely the High Ones have come to be recorded.\n\nAsk of the Jade Gate’s sands, near or far,\nYet none surpasses *Yuán Fàng* in Daoist talent.\n\n**To a Daoist Friend on Máo Shān**\n**Qiu Jùn**\nThe phoenix calls me to behold your virtue’s radiance,\nYet the pine and vine resist my heart’s compliance.\n\nA lone peak stands ten thousand *rèn* beneath the moon’s gaze,\nAn ancient hall—no one returns to its questions.\n\nI would aid *Táng* and *Yú* in opening the Way,\nYet deeply ashamed, I forget the Teachings of Máo and Xù.\n\nTomorrow again I’ll raise my light sail,\nWhile the purple wood grows fat year after year in vain.\n\n**On Máo Shān**\n**Chén Fǔ**\nThe *Jījīn* Peak’s summit stands as a screen,\nA treasure pavilion suspended in layered rainbows.\n\nThe crane’s carriage comes and goes to Máo and Xù’s halls,\nWhile the dragon’s feast gathers at Guō Yáng’s estate.\n\nFrom the Celestial Caverns, men appear like jade,\nIn the dusty world, all is but hempen triviality.\n\nI was once a fellow of the *Fāngtái*,\nSo let us seek the path home and plant clouds’ seeds.\n\n**Xiàpò Gōng**\nThe *Lónghǔ* of Xiányáng ascended here,\nAnd my second brother, bound to Shùshān’s Dao, succeeded.\n\nNo trace remains of the *Tánglí* Hall of the *Sìmìng*,\nOnly the *Dānjǐng*’s clear pool lingers.\n\n**Yùlán**\nThe prefect’s northern veranda teems with bamboo,\nYet the recluse’s southern cave lacks flowers.\n\nOn the western path of *Lánqiáo*, green stretches—\nI’ve picked a *jué’ér* child like a tiger’s fang.\n\n**Song of the *Zhīmù* with Preface**\n**Zhōu Bāngyàn**\nThe Daoist *Lú Zhìróu* obtained a *zhī* root growing from wood,\nThe wood itself rising from stone, its roots entwined beyond severing.\nBy the *Báihè* Temple’s side, an axe felled it—\nYet it remained as firm as metal and stone.\n\nI, *Bāngyàn*, begged *Lú* for it and carried it to *Shòuchú Wén*:\nThe heavens of Huàyáng hold countless grotto palaces,\nWhile the *Āxué* Convenient Gate hides in obscure places.\nThe Three *Máo*’s audience with the Emperor never returned,\nLeaving only the *Línglíng* Shrine’s abandoned crane feathers.\n\nThe *Yùjīn*’s precious qi long girds the waist,\nWhile the *Língmù*’s divine *zhī* occasionally emerges from the earth.\nThe sun’s essence secretly illuminates its own clarity,\nYet human effort exhausts itself in vain pursuit of the numinous.\n\nLast year, the *liǎnnuò* was made into a new palace,\nIts hollow cliffs echoing with axe and adze.\nYou came, and the brooding fowl danced in sea-snow,\nYou left, and the mountain clouds mingled with river rain.\n\nThis *zhī* was born from crimson grass to awaken the dusty world,\nSo the woodcutter was sent into the wilds to seek it.\nIts sap is like purple lacquer, its bark as firm as iron,\nBeneath it, the *Tiānsu* winds around the rocky basin.\n\nMortal men fear strange calamities may arise,\nYet the medicine chest worries over divine things being taken.\n\nThe governor of *Lúlíng* harbors Daoist winds,\nHis sturdy bones and pure mien yearn for flight.\nHis hidden virtue has cured the crippled with joy,\nAnd his sacred herbs have prolonged life—heaven grants it.\n\nI wish to take the elixir and sever worldly desires,\nYet I do not yield to *Nánhú*’s Master of Nourishment.\n\n**Huàyáng Cave**\n**Zhāng Shāngyīng**\nThe white tiger treads the rainbow on violet mist,\nHow often I’ve seen the sea turn to mulberry fields.\n\nAfter seeking the *Zhēn* at *Chìchéng*’s jade shoots,\nI’ve reached Huàyáng’s eighth heaven once more.\n\n**On the Southern Cave of Máo Shān**\n**Zhāng Gāng**\nWith a purple sash and gold seal at eighty-three,\nMy decayed frame no longer suits my old official title.\nAsk you to write me as a retired rustic,\nSitting in wild garb upon the green rock.\n\n**Sending the Crane Back to Qíyún**\n**Zhāng Fǔ**\nWho sent the embryo-ascended one to the dusty world?\nAll day, he sings clear verses with my leisure.\n\nHe does not dream of soaring beyond the clouds,\nYet I suspect he carries arrows to aid the *Qīng*—\nTo chase the *Luán*’s carriage on misty peaks,\nWould he linger in the *Jītiān*’s ranks?\n\nTell Qíyún to take this well,\nFor in years to come, I’ll seek *Hàoshān*’s heights.\n\n**To Huàyáng’s Master**\n**Cài Biàn**\nMaster arrives at Huàyáng’s Cave,\nIts flowers bloom again and again.\n\nThe roots must always save the world,\nYet it sends mortals away.\n\n**Parting Bǎoguāng Master for Yùchāng**\n**Zhāng Jiān**\nThe Western Hills call me to join your light ascent,\nAnd the upper hall detains you to nurture your return.\nDo not rise to worldly farewells,\nFor when we meet again, both will be youthful.\n\n**The Crane Temple’s Pine**\nThe idle picker of *wèilíng* harmed its roots,\nAnd half the tree withered.\n\nWho planted the hundred-*zhàng* ladder of the flying immortal?\nThe wind shattered it, the rain broke it—\nYet past men were not to blame.\n\nTo whom shall I convey this to *Yáng* the Prefect?\nPreserve the shoot’s branch for *Lìngwēi*’s return.\n\n**Máo Shān in the Rain**\nSparse mist and rain clear by morning,\nYet the floating clouds refuse to disperse.\nTell the grotto spirits not to halt their journey—\nNow, guests of the cave have returned to plow.\n\n**Huàyáng’s Southern Cave**\n**Zhōu Wénpǔ**\nI bow to the *Língshān*’s numinous peak,\nAnd speak of entering Huàyáng.\n\nThe Southern Cave’s wonders are extreme,\nIts deep pines and fragrant springs.\n\nA curved desk holds exquisite calligraphy,\nAnd giant stones bear inscribed divine texts.\n\nI tilt my head to the cloud gate,\nWhile the *língfēng*’s breeze dissolves my robes.\n\nThe recluse’s hermitage reveres guests,\nAnd warms me with the purple wood’s broth.\n\nHe leaves me *éyǎn* coins,\nSaying they were hidden in the cave.\n\nOnce, seekers of the profound entered,\nAnd saw a golden wall.\nGreed may have already arisen,\nNearly meeting a strange ghost’s assault.\n\nIf my mortal form should meet such fate,\nHow dare I lament like a tumbleweed in frost?\n\nI beg for but a square of land,\nTo build a quiet dwelling.\n\nMorning, I’ll don the *Shénzhī*’s diagram,\nEvening, I’ll test the *Fànfāng*’s elixir.\n\n**The *Jīnnióu* Cave**\nI descend the perilous ladder with caution,\nAnd sit at the deep well’s pivot.\n\nI turn my body to avoid the clouds and mist,\nAnd lie facing the sun and moon.\nThe medicine sprouts astonish with their protection,\nWhile the bamboo roots delight the *Xuān* clan.\n\nWho knew beneath the hidden *dì*’s salt,\nSuch wondrous peaks would rise?\n\nThe *Jīnnióu*’s light gleams,\nAnd the immortal records may yet be read.\n\nThe hill’s spring has passed its halfway mark,\nThe *gǒuqǐ* berries like drops of blood.\nI fear the toppling wind will stir,\nAnd blow the cliffs apart.\n\n**Three Poems to a Daoist Friend of Huàyáng**\nServing the Three *Máo*’s through a lifetime,\nMy foolish heart still hopes for the *Yùchē*’s arrival.\n\nOnce, I planted *Huánglóng*’s children with my hands,\nNow I understand how to carry clouds into the *Tàiqīng*.\n\nThe *Jiǔxì* Stele’s pavilion is sun-drenched,\nWhile the recluse sits slumped before the furnace’s blackness.\n\nWho will thank *Huán* the *Sīmǎ* for me?\nIn *Jùqǔ*’s mountains, only white *lěi* can be bought.\n\n**With a Feather Fan at the Mysterious Orchard**\nThe *Nǐcháng*’s silks ascend the altar,\nWhile the *Líshāng*’s robes dance on the sacrifice platform.",

wind howls—\nThe *Chángshǐ* ascends to Heaven’s court,\nWhile the *Xiānwēng* recluse clutches his sword’s grave.\n\nBefore the **Ruìxiàng Hall**, the lost horse’s tracks remain,\nAnd the **Huànlóng Pool** echoes with the cry of a *áo* [tortoise].\n\n**On the Road, Gazing Back at Máo Mountain**\nA perilous pavilion bears the name *Yǔshān*,\nAs the setting sun leans on the *Fúgōu*’s hook.\nThe white crow waits, poised like a drawn bow.\n\nLast year, I climbed the *Jí*’s heights,\nThrough the *Yuánsù* pass, where day’s call fades.\nThe caves exhale spring’s chill,\nWhile the hollow’s door yawns with quiet.\n\nAh, the venerable master!\nHis house built where clouds and rain converge.\nYet for the moth’s slaughter, he could not rise—\nNo dragon’s phoenix to bear him aloft.\nHis body shed its husk,\nHis old palace burned to ash.\nNow half his *bì* [cinnabar] remains,\nA thousand pillars uphold the *Xuán* altar.\n\nThus, with two paths unborrowed,\nHe delved deeper into *Zhuānruǎn*’s [recluses’] lore.\nEntering the hall, he sought the *Yùfǔ*’s axe,\nAnd plucked the *zhī* [herbs] to cast into the *Jīnhuán* [ring].\nThe inkwell’s waves seal script,\nWhile the *Dāntái*’s *qi* swirls in a spiral.\n\nHe kowtows to the *Dà Sīmìng*,\nHis unbound hair green against the mountain.\nTwo lords command cranes,\nBoth donning *Hàn Xiǎoguān* [Han-style] caps.\n\nWhen shall I join their flight?\nA fleeting vision—Dao’s gaze returns.\nYet worldly bonds still drag me back,\nAs the alchemy cauldron threatens to boil over.\n\n---\n**At Yànkǒu Cave**\n*Yànkǒu*’s dragon’s breath clears the air,\nWhere *Qián Zhēn*’s lingering spirit lingers.\nAfter the immortal brother departed, the master remains,\nAnd when the sister returns, the cave has grown broad.\nThe cloud-leaves still shimmer like white silk,\nWhile the spring’s voice endlessly chants the *Huángtíng* [classic].\n\nThe *bìtáo* blossoms bloom purple at *Jǔpú*,\nLeft for mortals to paint on screens.\n\n---\n**Visiting Yīn Gōng at Yùchén Guan**\n*Máo Yǒu* [Friend Mao]:\nOnce I saw you descend in a flat-bottomed boat,\nThe wind lifting your jade sleeves—\nA mortal turned Daoist.\nYou’ve traversed the *Ruòshuǐ* [Weak Water] thirty thousand *lǐ*,\nYet met *Cháng’ān*’s five hundred years anew.\nGrowing old, you’ve learned to find joy wherever you are,\nThough this life still owes me sleep unpaid.\nMáo Mountain’s wood grows old—\nLet virtue spur your talent.\nDepend on elixirs and herbs,\nLest you linger in emerald shades.\n\n---\n**Following the Rhyme**\n*Wèng Yànshēn*:\nHearing of the Three *Máo*’s Five *Dòng*’s gates,\nThe Daoist comes and goes on wind-borne flight.\nNo mortal steps may tread the *qí*’s [unicorn’s] path,\nNor ask the tortoise’s age in ancient pines.\nBy chance, we meet by the river’s mist,\nAnd by the rocks, we dream by the stream’s side.\nI, a descendant of *Tiānzhù*’s line, grow old,\nWhile *Jùqǔ*’s clear games merge with green.\n\n---\n**A Spontaneous Poem While Traveling Máo Mountain**\n*Zhōu Língdà*:\nA thousand peaks rise from *Lìyáng*,\nTheir force like a southwest charge.\nThey bow to the Three *Máo*’s summit,\nDaring not to press the *Zhūnyún*’s [Sovereign’s] glory.\nThe Three *Máo* hang like a *xuān* [carriage],\nTheir order strict as brothers.\nTo the west, the *Yítú* road splits,\nWhere the grass-immortal’s gate stands.\nEven now, the *Xiàbó Gōng*’s [Lower Palace] echoes,\nWith banners still fluttering in the breeze.\n\n---\n**Sending Zhang Dá Dao Back to the Mountain**\n*Zhào Rú*:\nBorrowing a day from red dust’s toil,\nYour

      "translated_text": "The **Pure Clarity** successor of the Daoist Master, **Sū Dàbīn**, crafted the *Golden Safflower* compilation of **Yuan** poetry, with a preface to five poems on visiting **Sanmao** Mountain.\n\n**Lú Jiá** heard that the **Jǔqū** Mountain had long been known, and in the spring of the **Yuan Wù** year (1338), while overseeing the **Xian** district, inspecting **Lìyáng** Commandery, and surveying local customs, he found its ruins just a short distance from the mountain’s slopes. All who climbed its lofty peaks and winding streams—places called *Hanging Palaces* or *Blessed Lands*—were greeted by the prefectural officials, as was proper.\n\nAt that time, I undertook the **Three Teachings** pilgrimage, arriving at the so-called **Chóngxǐ** Observatory. The **Chóngxǐ** host, a man of the **Zou** clan, styled himself *Heart-Distant* and welcomed me into his refined retreat. His halls and chambers were grand as noble estates, their elegance profound and adorned with splendor. Passing through, one found pavilions extending like wings over streams, trees, bamboo, and rocks, making this mountain the most resplendent and unmatched of all.\n\nThe two of us wandered together, unaware of the sun’s descent. My distant teacher, his robes flowing, spoke with such clarity and wit that his discourse was most enchanting. He was also skilled in the arts, able to convey meaning through brushstrokes on plain silk, transforming mere objects into life. His painted cranes were so meticulously crafted that even the finest ancient calligraphers would find no flaw in them—yet his spirit and grace surpassed theirs, for he had learned from those beyond the ordinary. Thus, when we raised our cups, we celebrated his unparalleled talent.\n\nThe **Feathered Ones’** dwelling on the upper peak is called the **Yuanfú Wànníng** Palace, also known as the **Zōngtán**. The **Zōngtán** Master, **Xǔ Yì**, invited me to be the **Divine Clarity** guest, and with cup in hand, he summoned the boundless void, lamenting that those who had once hidden here could not be found, and that the **Danqiu** would no longer join us in our wanderings.\n\nDescending to the **Huáyáng** caves, I saw the **jade grease** pool still, the **stone hair** bristling like pincers, trickling streams rushing into deep ravines, carrying floating blossoms along. Passing the **Jìkè** Spring, its waters clear as a polished mirror, it seemed to hold a great stone pestle above it, as if scooped from a well a few *zhang* wide and half *chǐ* deep, encircled by four ropes and sealed with a stone collar, its opening guarded with utmost care. We piled **dòuxiāo** reeds to mark its sacredness, and when guests arrived, the spring’s joy mirrored theirs—its boiling froth like the **Han** River’s birth, as if leaping from a clam’s shell to pierce the **Dragon’s Beard**—so abundant it could not be counted. We called it the *Spring’s Laughter*; otherwise, it would not be. How strange!\n\nWhy should I be mocked? I returned to rest at my distant teacher’s abode. The mountain’s visitors had already stayed many nights, and the host’s hospitality showed no sign of waning. I, unable to contain my delight, composed poems and wrote this farewell preface to leave behind.\n\n---\n\n**On the Road: A Light Breeze Scatters the Thin Shade,**\nThe **jade flute** calls as we pass through **Huá** Forest.\nWithin the mountain, who is the **prime minister** now?\nAt dusk, the **blue peaks** resound with **chicken and dog** sounds.\n\nBy the ravine’s **jade grasses**, in the cave’s blossoms,\nFine waters flow in spring, bearing **green sands**.\nLast night, the **mountain gourd** wine was just fermented—\nThe **Daoist** had no time to read the *South Hua*.\n\nAt the **bamboo tips**, a **flying pavilion** rests on the **stone spring**,\nWhile on the **pine platform**, **fragrant mists** chase the **tea smoke**.\nThe **crow’s cry** recalls the night’s rain,\nThe **deer’s dream** startles—another realm has opened.\n\nA **far traveler** comes to visit the **bearded dragon**,\nThe **virtuous recluse** paints for those who love such things.\nThe *Laughter Scroll* gathers **cloud and mist** away,\nLong may the **ink-stone** teach beneath the **three peaks**.\n\nThe **mountain lord**, pleased with my visit, thus sends\nThe **clear spring’s laughter** without end.\n\nA **ten-thousand-hu** pearl and a **three-foot jade**,\nI must take them with me when I cross **Xuan** State.\n\n---\n\n**Inscription for Master Zou’s Pine-Crane Painting**\n\nWith **powdered cinnabar** and **aloft brush**, his strokes hold divine spirit—\nThe **Daoist**, dreamless, reaches the **chicken and dog** sounds.\nWhen will the **venerable guest of the village** arrive, his beard ashen?\nThen let him summon **Sanmao**’s ten thousand miles of clouds.\n\n---\n\n**Gazette of Sanmao Mountain and Its Preface**\n\nIn the **Yuan Wù** year (1338), as the old year ended, I returned to **Sanmao** Mountain.\nOn the **first day of the first month**, in the **Year of the Tiger** (1339), I performed the **ritual of purification** and at dawn climbed the **Heavenly Market** Platform. Then, with the **Chóngxǐ** host, I ascended the **Jījīn** Peak, lingered to drink at the **Sōngxī** **Fāngzhāng** Pavilion, and finally returned to my distant teacher’s **jade qi**-infused chamber.\n\nThe **sea breeze** blows at dawn over the **three upper mountains**,\nMy hands grasp the **auspicious season’s** beauty—how satisfying!\nBy chance, I meet the **Daoist** on the **New Year’s** first day,\nUnknowing of the world’s **spring cold**.\n\nAt the **plum’s edge**, my staff and sandals follow its scent,\nIn the **cloud’s realm**, the **pavilions** gleam like **jade railings**.\nA **cup of peppered flowers** from time immemorial,\nWhen drunk, I ride a **crane** to ask of **elixir’s** refinement.\n\n**Four days after New Year’s**, I leave farewell to the **Zōngtán** Master **Xǔ** and **Zou** *Heart-Distant*.\n\n**Frosted robes**, the **pilgrim** returns once more—\nNot only the **green mountains** ease his longing thoughts.\nThe **throat-pass** holds the **yellow-crowned** sage,\nHalf able to sing my **Steps in the Void**.\n\nBeside the **blue stream**, wind and sun veil our questions,\nUrging me to gaze at the **plum blossoms** wrapped in **mirror-like** frost.\nDo not grieve the **morning carriage’s** solitude too deeply,\nFor the **fragrant jade** still lingers to brighten the **spring chill**.\n\nAt the **mountain’s peak**, the **Feathered Ones** gather at dawn,\nTheir strides crushing the **blue clouds**, ascending the **North Dipper’s** ladder.\nBy chance, I lodge with **Sanmao’s** lord at the **rock’s foot**,\nThen follow the **monkeys and cranes** across **Sōngxī**.\n\nIn my **sleeves**, the **cinnabar sand**,\nBeneath my **feet**, the **clouds**—\n**Emperor Yao’s** era, the **first cycle of the Jiazi**,\nThe **Han** dynasty’s spring.\n\nNow, my **wandering dreams** at **Jǔqū**,\nNo longer the **recluse of commerce** who shuns the world.\nI bow to the **clouds** and part with **Xǔ** the guest,\nReturning beneath the **moon** to visit my distant teacher.\n\n**Midnight’s bamboo whispers** drive me away,\nAgain, the **lonely winter branches** labor for my sake.\n\n**Composed for Master Xǔ of Sōngxī’s Zōngtán**\n\n**Chén Jūn**\n\nThe **Jījīn** heights embrace the **bearded sage**,\nBelow, the **deep pure waters** guard the **stone chamber**.\nThe **thirsty tiger** swiftly prowls the **fragrant woods** for **amber**,\nThe **crouching tortoise** follows the **crane** into the **Stagnant Waves**.\n\nThe **startling tides** on both banks become **cold rain**,\nThe **bright moon** over a **single expanse** flows **emerald frost**.\nIt seems like sitting on the **Nine-Tiered Terrace**,\nWhere the **empty green** stretches—tree after tree, the **round light** falls.\n\n**Ascending Great Sanmao Peak**\n\n**Liáng Dòng**\n\nWith **plum staff**, I climb to the **absolute summit**,\nThe **green mountains** vie with the **world’s paths** in ruggedness.\n**Blue clouds** block the **heaven’s eye** beyond the peaks,\nThe **spring wind** ages the **questioning heart**.\n\nThe **Great Lord** ascends to **Heaven**, his **treasured sword** transformed,\nThe **little dragon** plunges into the **sea**, its **bright pearl** lost.\nNo one remains to guard the **Celestial Emperor’s** **cauldron**,\nA guest would ask the **Qin Emperor’s** **golden elixir**.\n\nWho ponders the **precipice’s** toil?\nThe **ancient cave** is still too deep to explore.\n**Divine light** does not break the **darkness’s** vexation,\nThe **mountain spirit** vainly recites the *Separation Sorrows*.\n\nI come, gazing up and down, with a sigh—\nThe **mountains and rivers** were once fine; now, the **people** are the treasure.",

      "translated_text": "**On Lǚ Rùwàng’s Poems to the True One (Continued)**\n\nLater, the phrase *\"举举\"* was written as *\"摔\"* in the text, with *\"举\"* being the ancient form of *\"率\"* (to lead, guide). Master Lǚ passed through the Three Teachings’ precincts and, in passing, inscribed these verses to send to me, also providing the means for daily worship of the True One. The Outer Historian’s verses are clear and unadorned, yet I fear my words may seem crude in comparison.\n\n**Poem One: Welcoming the True One**\nThe clouds drift in uneven, graceful ranks—\nEmerald banners sway, dew-drenched with morning’s glow.\nThe Divine Lord lingers, hesitant, as if yet to arrive,\nHis fair brow deep in thought, like a mountain standing still.\n\nThe Jade Terrace’s script shines through stars and constellations,\nThe crimson gate glows, its light spilling like crimson streams.\nSpring thunder cracks the valleys—none hear its voice,\nYet the lone crane, asleep on pine, wakes first to its call.\n\n**Poem Two: Sending the True One**\nHis radiant face returns, his treasure robes unbound,\nRiding the dragon’s high hump, his spirit soars beyond.\nThe mountain’s elder greets him, year after year,\nWith a single cup of cold spring, poured over jade.\n\nEmerald qi swirls in mist, a forest canopy,\nWith jingling bells held aloft, their light rising and falling.\nThe Imperial Son sings his return, his voice soaring,\nAs white moons welcome clouds and send flying sashes.\n\n---\n\n**A Gift to the Recluse of Huàyáng Cave**\n\nSeated like a corpse, he drinks the morning sun—\nHis double face flushed with wine, his doorstep filled with incense-clouds at dawn.\nMoss and stone sprawl in tangled purple silk,\nAnd the *xūn* flower blooms shallow in green *nícǎo* grass.\n\nThe northern mountain’s apes and cranes seem bound by some pact,\nWhile the southern cliff’s bells and chimes echo as if in reply.\nHe longs to dwell deeper in the abyss,\nBuilding altars by night to worship the Three Teachings’ Lord.\n\n**Two More Poems in the Same Style**\n*Yuè Jí*\n\nA single oar guides my boat into white reeds,\nSeeking the old hermit’s home where the True One resides.\nMy pouch holds the *Zhǒuhòu*’s alchemical secrets,\nAnd when my letter arrives, men will ask of the Dao’s ways.\n\nBefore the white clouds linger to keep me late,\nI know the blue pines send frequent messages.\nThe crane I raised now perches on the pine’s peak,\nSurely he is the recluse of Huàyáng—how many such men remain?\n\nHis hidden life hears the Dao from none too near,\nAs deer and elk come to nest in snow’s deep embrace.\nEach time he reads the clouds, he finds *zhīmù* and wood,\nWhy marvel at the red light piercing the forest’s gloom?\n\nThe Teachings’ Lord rides a tiger down alone,\nWhile the wooded sage may yet compose verses with the dry ape.\nKnow that now he thinks of me most deeply,\nAs my flying spirit crosses a thousand peaks.\n\n**Two Poems in the Same Rhyme**\n*Zhēng Zūyīng*\n\nI dwell in the eastern seas, far from your Jùqū home—\nHow could I know your true news, so distant and true?\nThe immortals possess the art of shrinking earth,\nYet the Master has no mind to gaze upon the common folk.\n\nI am used to wild grasses filling my meal,\nAnd forget the peaches of *Pántáo* bearing fruit so often.\nWho will send a letter with white soil and *dì* trees?\nBest to feign madness, as the recluse-historian does.\n\nIn a flash, we parted—how much dust has flown since then?\nI’ve seen Penglai’s shallows deepen again.\nWhen I recall fishing for the giant tortoise with Rén Gōng’s son,\nWho will release the crane with me, as Zhī Dàolín once did?\n\nThe elixir, once refined, should make one never age,\nAnd poetry, once written, is often wild and lone.\nNext year, I’ll meet you on the *Xiá Jià*’s misty heights,\nAnd send my flying carriage to await you on distant peaks.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Yáng Zǎi*\n\nI envy you, ascending to Huàyáng’s heights,\nWhere ancient caves coil with stone paths lost to time.\nYour banners blot out the sun, their flags fluttering in dawn’s breeze,\nWhile jingling ornaments chime through the night’s empty sky.\n\nYou’ve tested the *fènxīá*’s elixir, mastering the True One’s way,\nAnd worshipped the tortoise to reverse the years of decay.\nThough Tao Yuanming hid himself in seclusion,\nHe still upheld the Dao to aid the Qi and Liang.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Xuē Xuànyì*\n\nReturning to Huàyáng’s ancient cave-heaven,\nYour lofty spirit soars beyond the world’s green.\nYou carve red leaves on cliffs draped in creeping vines,\nAnd loose your hair where purple mists drift beyond the pines.\n\nWhen will the *Chángshǐ*’s script descend in jade?\nThe recluse’s secrets still pass through the ages.\nI’ll tie my boat to the river’s bend to seek you out,\nAnd wander with the wind, questioning the High Mystic.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Zhāng Shū*\n\nIn Xuánzhōu’s secluded hut, you live in splendor’s embrace,\nWith coiled clouds nurturing ten thousand pines in the valley.\nThe Outer Historian’s scrolls hold the golden keys to the *Jīn Kuì*,\nAnd your hidden dwelling bears the imperial seal in jade.\n\nThe elixir pool reveals a dragon without horns,\nAnd the immortal herbs grow fat, their deer bearing antlers.\nI’d borrow one favor to serve as your cave’s official,\nAnd journey with you to the Great Teachings’ peak.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Liú Wèn*\n\nA single day’s letter spreads across the four seas,\nAnd Huàyáng now believes in scholar-immortals.\nDivine friendship blooms

flowing well.\nThe mountain’s hues are boundless in their clarity,\nSo I’ll dredge the clouds to reach your cave-heaven.\n\n**In the Same Style**\n*Zhèng Yuányòu*\n\nSince building your hut in Xuánzhōu with your own hands,\nThe ink-stone’s spring has moistened my own brush.\nI’ve hooked my name on stone records of the worthy,\nAnd carved the mountain’s script as a chronicle’s proof.\n\nThe elixir’s warmth warms the pine’s nodes at dawn,\nAnd tea leaves sprout where the *jū* seedlings grow.\nIf my mortal frame holds even a spark of the True,\nI’d also seek the West, awaiting the jade

pass, I gaze upon the three peaks,\nWhere lotus-green mists hide the *fúróng*’s deep shade.\nIf only I could ride two deer with you,\nTo listen to the wind among the blue cliffs’ pines.\n\n**A Gift to the Master of Yùzhū**\n*Wáng Lǐ*\n\nIn Jùqū’s mountain, the aged alchemist refines,\nHis pupils like lacquer, his brows like silk.\nHe rides a dark crane to the golden hall,\nAnd kneels to present the elixir script at the jade steps.\n\nHis name is often asked by the enlightened ruler,\nAnd his verses flow from the inner ministers’ pens.\nWhen the wind and rain return him home at night,\nWhite stones and green moss nurture the purple *zhīchí*.\n\n**A Gift to the Master of Jíxū as He Visits the Capital**\nThe Teachings’ Lord of Máo Shān is unknown to men,\nYet for thirty years he’s cultivated *qi* and spirit.\nToday, his two bright eyes gaze upon the forbidden city,\nAnd in spring, a lone crane descends from the distant sky.",

      "translated_text": "**To the Master of Jíxū on His Daoist Lineage**\nIf you meet a recluse wandering beyond the world’s reach,\nAsk him which generation of the Dao he now inherits.\nThe Dragon-Sword’s scrolls and Jade-Casket treasures open the *Bǎolù*’s secrets—\nWhy speak again of earthly immortals?\n\n**On the First Peak**\n*Wáng Fùyuán*\nFive clouds surge with golden robes of the Celestial Official,\nThe eighteenth twist—first peak of all.\nWood and stone shade dark, the wind sighs sharp,\nFrom the square pool, pluck a tiny dragon’s form.\n\n**On the Second Peak**\nThe Jiang-Zhe lands point west, then turn to ask,\nWhere ancient furnaces once held the *bìgū*’s spotted plover.\nI pity my white hair still clinging to mortal bone,\nA thousand *lǐ* brought me to climb this second mountain.\n\n**On the Third Peak**\nOnce, you gave elixir to the *Èr-Mǎo* Lord,\nAnd still, at spring’s end, the clouds burn like fire.\nMen say you rose afterward into the sky,\nWhile the crane’s cry echoes beneath the moon.\n\n**Same Theme**\n*Sàdū Lā*\nThe jade pendants chime as they descend to earth,\nThe wind of heaven rustles the violet *xiá* skirts.\nLiu Lang rides a crane to the Three Isles,\nThe Prince of Wu plays his *shēng* beneath the Five Clouds.\nThe cave’s night-light passes the jade seal,\nOn the stone altar, the moon’s darkness honors the Teachings’ Lord.\nIf you meet the Celestial Master from on high,\nAsk how much cinnabar he’s refined.\n\n---\n\n**Visiting Máo Shān’s Peaks**\n*Kǎilèibáshí*\nThe bamboo carriage climbs into the jade-green haze,\nTo seek the immortal’s white-jade altar.\nFeathered robes often bring the thousand-year crane,\nThe *luán*’s crimson robes once lingered in the Nine Heavens.\nThe cave hides *zhīchí* grass and mountain-jade,\nMen say the *Lín* Palace’s well holds the elixir.\nBeneath the pines, only the recluse’s hall remains—\nAlmost, it was the Emperor Liang’s moment of crisis.\n\n**At the Joyful Guest Spring**\nSpring waters clear, green pools overflow,\nPearls of jade well up in clustered streams.\nThe River Queen loosed her ornaments in chaos,\nThe deep hermit’s tears spill like cascading silk.\nThe Earth-Mother’s bounty has ever been vast,\nYet Feng Yi now displays wonders anew.\nLean on the railing—do not say joy is absent,\nBut play with the cool, damp notes of this poor verse.\n\n**At Yuánfú’s Mountain Retreat**\nSeated before the thousand cliffs’ emerald,\nThe forest’s trees pierce the *qióng* stone.\nThe sword’s sheath holds ancient blades,\nThe alchemical tripod refines the elixir still.\nThe *lěi* flowers press against the mountain-window, damp,\nThe mist opens—cold trees line the ravine.\nSpring birds know my intent,\nChirping as I linger, hesitant.\n\n**At Quánqīng Pavilion**\nStone embraces the secluded pavilion, explored again and again,\nBamboo before the hall plays its clear, fresh tunes.\nHuáyáng’s mountain wine fills the green cups,\nSeated, the spring’s waters drown my drunkenness.\n\n**To the Master of Jíxū**\nThe path into Huáyáng’s stream flows on,\nThe immortal’s jade pendants, his cloud-colored robe.\nPine shadows and stone tortoises warm with elixir smoke,\nThe cave enfolds peach blossoms, the green trees deep.\nAlas, I return from dust to worldly affairs,\nNo heart for wandering beyond to *Yíngzhōu*.\nWhen shall I borrow the Teachings’ Lord’s crane,\nTo journey once more to the Three Mountains’ depths?\n\n**Visiting Máo Shān**\n*Yuè Hùnán*\nThe Great Máo Peak’s summit holds the immortals’ hall,\nThe stone path twists and turns, steep and winding.\nThe old hare’s illusion shows the jade seal,\nThe dragon’s flight depends on the golden elixir.\nTowering pines and white cranes mark the distant Celestial Altar,\nFlowing waters and green peaches chill the immortal’s cave.\nWhere does the *shēng*’s music drift beneath the bright moon?\nThe *shānshān* jade pendants almost summon the *luán*.\n\n**To the Master of Jíxū**\n*Wáng Qiān*\nThe Third Peak is but a step from heaven,\nA dip from the Dragon Pool mixes with mist.\nThe hermit Maò left for the Cloud-River’s hidden depths,\nYet his pure reputation spreads far and wide.\nLong a guest in the capital, now joyfully returned,\nLong days, fine winds brush my travel-worn robes.\nReturning, we face the green mountains together,\nThe pine’s apex glows with elixir light.\nI parted from Huáyáng years ago—\nIn dreams, I still return to Huáyáng.\nHuáyáng’s cave must remain as it was,\nEven now, its incense fills the air.\n\n**Same Theme**\n*Chǔ Néngxíng*\nThe ancestral seal’s transmission is the One True Dao,\nHow could the crane’s journey long be bound to dust?\nThe Pure Reign’s mirror reveals no private favor,\nThe blessed land returns to those of virtue.\nNew rain showers the *ruìzé* groves,\nThe winter altar’s pines and junipers stand firm.\nI offer incense afar, blessing the mountain’s meeting,\nThe pillars of Huáyáng endure five hundred springs.\n\n**On the Golden Key**\n*The Golden Key*\nThe Great Pivot scatters beings in myriad forms—\nWhy do grasses and trees wither in this scorched *mèngxià*?\nThe heavens hold no clouds, the rain does not fall,\nJīnlíng’s four borders see fields grow barren.\nThe Southern Platform’s御史 is a virtuous official,\nHis heart aches for the people, his loyalty unshaken.\nHe urgently petitioned for the drought’s relief,\nAnd sent the swift steed to Máo Peak’s heights.\nThe御史’s horse was as pure as ice in a jade vessel,\nBareheaded, barefoot, he climbed the rugged path.\nHe personally invoked the Teachings’ Lord—\nAnd lo, the response came swift.\nThe True One, Master Róng, stood on the altar,\nDrew water, and sent the spirit-script aloft.\nThe御史’s horse had barely half the journey back,\nWhen clouds gathered, and rain followed the carriage wheels.\nHuáyáng’s *dòngtiān* is the immortals’ domain,\nThe coiling dragon stirs not—who could rouse it?\nUnless sincerity pierces the heavens like an offering,\nHow could such thunderous response be summoned?\nFirst came the lightning, then the rain—all were drenched,\nNo need for the *shènléi*’s crash to shake the Nine Regions.\nThe *Lántái* clerks galloped to report,\nThis virtue’s blessing nourishes the fertile lands.\nYet one candle’s light, one incense’s smoke,\nSummoned the three cranes to gather in reply.\nWas it necessary to dam the West River’s floodwaters,\nTo save the dried fish as in the *zhé*’s time?\nA single drop from the Heavenly Dipper fell like a dragon’s breath,\nThe waves surged three *zhàng* high across the earth.\nThe divine power’s work cannot be measured—\nSilent, motionless, like the Void itself.\n\n*The Records of Máo Shān, Volume Thirty-Two, ends here.*",

      "translated_text": "The Secretariat, having already dispatched the decree to the Jiankang Circuit for implementation, now commands all subordinates to verify and comply accordingly.\n\n**Matters requiring deliberation and execution:**\n\nIn ancient times, the transmission of Dao was entrusted to the **True Person (真人) of Three Teachings at Dragon-Tiger Mountain**, as decreed.\n\n**Preface to the *True Transmission Diagram of Shangqing***\n\nHe who dwells in lofty forests and peaks must first harbor the resolve to ascend the azure clouds; he who imbibes the profound essence must seek the source of the elixir’s waters.\n\nOf all teachings, none surpasses the **Dao** in its transmission. Thus, those ancient who sought the **Dao** regarded finding a master as their utmost priority, while masters themselves found securing worthy disciples their greatest challenge. Yet the **Immortal** seeks nothing from others, and the **Dao** requires no external aid. One must only cultivate purity and stillness, align heart and sincerity, and await the response of the **True Spirit (真灵)**.\n\nFaith is the mother of merit; doubt, the destroyer of progress. How can one be too cautious?\n\n**Huayang Cave Heaven**, since the **Three Teac Masters of Han** ascended here, has been the domain of **Divine Lords and Immortals** through the Wei and Jin dynasties onward. It is where **cloud-dwelling and mist-garbed sages** gather—truly a **Celestial Palace upon Earth**, a **Paradise of the Dao**. Hence, the ancients likened the **Dao’s Huayang** to the **Confucian Ru’s Shimen**, though such comparisons fall short in their inadequacy.\n\nThe **True Person of Shangqing, Master Liu** (刘君大彬), commissioned artisans to copy the **Ancestral True Images**, spanning from **Zhongxu Yuanjun** (紫虚元君) through forty-five generations. **Master Meng** (孟俯) then composed a brief transmission record, appending it to the scroll, and hid it within the mountain. Thus, future generations might preserve the lineage, keeping the **Dao’s essence** alive through reverence and study.\n\nI humbly reflect: the mountain’s marvels and the **Dao’s radiance** owe much to **Zhenbai True Person Tao** (陶君), who recorded and compiled with unwavering dedication. Thus, even the distant **Mao-Wei** and **Xiazu** regions retain echoes of its teachings, while the **Yangxu old borders** still bear traces of its legacy. The spirit soars beyond mortal reach.\n\nAlas! How I wish to follow **True Person Tao** in his inquiries at **Leiping Liufen**, kneeling as his disciple, and offering my pen in service! Then might I examine the **Panboluo** mirror, contemplate the **Xinghong Pool**, and spend my remaining years in **grass-clothing and wooden bowls**, fulfilling my aspirations.\n\nHow dare I covet the frivolous pursuit of **Immortal longevity**?\n\nWritten on the **seventh year of the Yanyou era (延佑七年, 1320)**, the **gengshen day (庚申)**, the ninth day of the month, by **Zhao Mengfu** (赵孟俯), former **Hanlin Academician**, **Chancellor of Imperial Edicts**, and **Compiler of National Histories**.\n\n**End of Volume Thirty-Three of *Maoshan Records* (茅山志)**.\n\n---\n**Annotations in Original Text:**\n1. 永: *Dubious reading; original text has \"久\" (long).*\n2. 吁: *Dubious reading; original text has \"呵\" (exclamation).*\n3. 窃: *Original text has \"切\" (earnestly); corrected per *Dianben* (笪本).*\n4. 失: *Original text has \"夫\" (this); corrected per *Dianben*.*\n5. 冰: *Original text has \"水\" (water); corrected per *Dianben*.*",
