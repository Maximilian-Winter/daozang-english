  "full_translation": "**The Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue: Commentary**\n**Title of the Classic:** *The Authentic Classic of the Dao and Its Virtue: Commentary*\n**Commentator:** Wu Cheng of Yuan-era Linchuan.\n**Four Scrolls.**\n**Base Text Source:** *The Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era* (洞神部 *Yujue* Class).\n**Collated Edition:** The *Yueya Tang* Series (粤雅本) annotated and printed by Wu Chongyao during the Xianfeng era of the Qing (hereafter, *Yueya Edition*).\n\nThis commentary divides the original text of *Laozi* into sixty-eight chapters, with no chapter titles.\n\n---\n**Laozi**\n**Wu Cheng of Linchuan’s Exegesis**\n\nLaozi, of the Li clan, given name Er, styled Dan.\n*The Records of the Historian* [in its *Biographies of Recluses and Hermits*] states: \"Styled Boyang, a native of Lixiang, Quren Village, Kuxian County in Chu, he was the Keeper of the Archives in Zhou.\" He cultivated the Dao and Virtue, taking as his aim the self-effacement of namelessness. Dwelling in Zhou for a long time, upon witnessing its decline, he departed. Arriving at the Pass, the Gatekeeper Yin Xi said: \"Master, you are about to depart—please write a book for me.\" Thus, he composed the *Upper* and *Lower* Scrolls, over five thousand words, and then vanished, his end unknown.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"Taking the root as refined, the branches as coarse, regarding accumulation as insufficiency—serene and solitary, dwelling with the numinous and luminous. Founded upon the ever-non-existent, governed by the Supreme Unity. Displaying frailty, humility, and submission as its exterior, yet within, emptiness and non-destruction of all things as its substance. While others seek fortune, he alone bends to preserve himself whole. Rooted in depth, measured by restraint, ever expansive toward things, never diminished by others—truly the ancient sage of boundless truth!\"\n\n**Note on Pronunciation:**\n*Kǔ* (苦) with a level tone; *hù* (怙) with a departing tone. *Cáng* (藏) with a departing tone; *qù* (去) with a departing tone.\n\nThe *Dao* that can be spoken of is not the eternal *Dao*.\nThe name that can be named is not the eternal name.\n\nThe *Dao* is like a path—what can be traversed is not the eternal *Dao*.\nThe \"name\" refers to *virtue*—what can be designated is not the eternal name.\n\nThe *Dao* itself is nameless; it is called *Dao* alone.\nIf one speaks of it as a path that can be traversed, then it is not the eternal *Dao*.\n*Virtue*, though named, is but a forced designation.\nIf one speaks of it as a name that can be designated, then it is not the eternal *virtue*.\n\nThe nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe named is the mother of ten thousand things.\nThe nameless—this is the *Dao*; Heaven and Earth arise from this *Dao*, hence it is called the origin.\nThe named—this is *virtue*; ten thousand things arise from this *virtue*, hence it is called the mother.\n\nEver without desire, one observes its subtlety;\nEver with desire, one observes its peril.\nThe \"ever\" refers to the constancy of the eternal *Dao* and eternal *virtue*.\nEver without desire—this is the stillness of the sage’s nature, where the *Dao* manifests in its entirety, and from this one observes the subtlety of *virtue*.\nThe \"subtlety\" refers to the utmost excellence, spoken of in terms of the *Dao*.\nEver with desire—this is the sage’s responsiveness to things, where *virtue* acts in its fullest capacity, and from this one observes the peril of the *Dao*.\nThe \"peril\" refers to the threshold, as in Mencius’ \"the beginning.\"\n\nThese two—*Dao* and *virtue*—are the same.\nThese two—*Dao* and *virtue*—though distinct in name when manifested, are called the *Mystic*.\nThe *Mystic*—that which is profound and unfathomable.\n\n*Virtue* emerges from the *Dao* yet differs in name, so it is not called *Dao* but *virtue*.\nThough differing in name, *virtue* and *Dao* are both called the *Mystic*—thus they are not truly different.\n\nThe *Mystic*, again the *Mystic*—\nThe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\n\nAll subtleties refer to *virtue*.\nThe gateway refers to their origin.\n\n*Virtue* and *Dao*, though both called the *Mystic*, are such that the *Dao* is the *Mystic* of *Mystics*—\nThe source from which all subtleties coalesce.\nThe subtlety of subtleties is the *Dao*;\nThe subtlety that unifies is *virtue*—\nThe subtlety that branches into myriad particulars.\n\n---\n**Chapter One**\nThis chapter expounds the essence of *Dao* and *virtue*.\n\nZhang Zai said:\nFrom the Great Emptiness comes the name *Heaven*;\nFrom *qi* transformation comes the name *Dao*.\nLaozi regards the Great Emptiness as that from which Heaven and Earth arise, calling it the *Dao*;\nAnd *qi* transformation as that from which all things derive their being, calling it *virtue*.\nThe *Dao* refers to the principle above form, unmingled with *qi*—as Zhuangzi’s \"ever non-existent.\"\n*Virtue* refers to the principle within form, where this principle inheres in *qi*—as Zhuangzi’s \"Supreme Unity.\"\nThus, its *Dao* and *virtue* take as their substance the natural void,\nAnd as their function the yielding and unfilled.\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, then badness arises.\n\"Beauty\" refers to beauty in contrast to other things, speaking of its substance.\n\"Goodness\" refers to excellence in its function.\nThe names of beauty and ugliness, goodness and badness, arise in relation.\nBecause ugliness exists, beauty exists;\nBecause badness exists, goodness exists.\nWhen all know this as beauty, that becomes ugliness;\nWhen all know this as goodness, that becomes badness.\nIf one were to eliminate both, making none know beauty as beauty or goodness as goodness,\nThen there would also be no ugliness, no badness.\n\nThus, existence and non-existence give rise to each other;\nDifficulty and ease complete each other;\nLength and shortness define each other;\nHigh and low depend on each other;\nSounds and tones harmonize;\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\nThe existence and non-existence of things,\nThe difficulty and ease of matters,\nThe length and shortness of forms,\nThe high and low of circumstances,\nThe opening and closing of sounds,\nThe purity and turbidity of tones,\nThe sequence of positions—\nThese are all paired opposites.\nWhere one exists, the other exists;\nWhere one does not exist, the other does not exist.\nThe arising of beauty and ugliness, goodness and badness, follows this same principle.\n\n\"Define each other\" refers to two forms standing side by side;\n\"Depend on each other\" refers to one ascending, one descending;\n\"Harmonize\" refers to one initiating, one responding;\n\"Follow\" refers to the sequential connection, like the wind following the earth.\n\nOf these five, four explicitly state their pairs,\nBut \"sounds and tones\" are not—\nFor if one merely says \"opening and closing, purity and turbidity,\"\nPeople would not recognize this as referring to sounds and tones.\nBy naming \"sounds and tones,\" their paired opposites—opening/closing, purity/turbidity—are naturally understood.\nThus, only the reality is indicated, not the pair.\n\nTherefore, the sage acts without action,\nAnd teaches without speech.\nIf one acts, then there are things left undone;\nOnly in non-action is there nothing left undone.\nIf one speaks, then there are things left unsaid;\nOnly in non-speech is there nothing left unsaid.\n\nAll things arise without his claiming them,\nAll things are born without his possessing them—\nHeaven and Earth are thus as well.\n\n\"Arise\" refers to the springtime when things begin to form;\n\"Claim\" refers to speech.\n\"Born\" refers to the summertime when things are fully formed;\n\"Possess\" refers to ownership.\nNot claiming, not possessing—\nThis is the silent teaching of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe Master said of Heaven, *\"What speech can there be of it?\"*—\nAll things arise within it, and that is all.\n\nIt acts yet does not rely,\nIt completes yet does not dwell.\n*\"Acts\"* refers to the time when things are forming in autumn—\n*\"Rely\"* refers to relying on one’s ability and acting.\n*\"Completes\"* refers to the time when things are fully formed in winter—\n*\"Dwell\"* refers to taking credit for one’s deeds.\nNot relying, not dwelling—\nThis is the non-action of Heaven and Earth.\n\nOnly because it does not dwell,\nIt does not depart.\nNot departing,\nThis is eternal existence.\n\nHeaven and Earth do not dwell upon the completion of things,\nThus their work endures forever and does not depart.\n\n---\nThe sage governs by doing without doing,\nThus his governance requires no action;\nHe teaches without speaking,\nThus his teaching requires no words.\nWithout doing and without speaking,\nEven if there is beauty and goodness, people do not know of it—\nThus its beauty and goodness are alone, exalted and noble, with none to compare.\n\nIf there is governance through action,\nIf there is teaching through speech,\nThen people all know whether it is beautiful or evil,\nAnd beauty opposes ugliness, goodness opposes badness—\nThis is not the alone-exalted, alone-noble beauty and goodness.\n\nAll the chapters within *Laozi*’s book\nDo not depart from the meaning of this chapter.\n\nDo not exalt the worthy, so the people do not contend;\nDo not treasure hard-to-obtain goods, so the people do not steal;\nDo not display what is desirable, so the people’s hearts do not grow乱.\n*\"Exalt\"* means to honor and elevate,\n*\"Treasure\"* means to value highly,\n*\"Display\"* is akin to *\"show.\"*\n\nThe worthy among people—\nTheir names may be exalted above others,\nBut if exalted, the people will all strive for that name and thus contend.\nHard-to-obtain goods—\nTheir profits may be treasured above others,\nBut if treasured, the people will all seek that profit and thus steal.\n\nFor names and profits are desirable—\nIf they are not exalted, not treasured,\nThis is not showing them as desirable,\nThus the people’s hearts do not contend, do not steal—\nThis is not乱.\n\nTherefore, the sage’s governance:\nEmpties their minds,\nFills their bellies,\nWeakens their ambitions,\nStrengthens their bones.\nThese four phrases all refer to the people.\n\n*\"Empties their minds\"* means to make the people unaware of the value of profit, so they have no thieving hearts.\n*\"Fills their bellies\"* means that though the people may not covet profit, the sage secretly ensures they have enough to eat and are well-fed, never failing to provide for them.\n*\"Weakens their ambitions\"* means to make the people unaware of the exaltation of names, so they have no contentious hearts.\n*\"Strengthens their bones\"* means that though the people may not covet names, the sage secretly encourages them to exert themselves and grow strong, never failing to inspire them toward virtue.\n\nAlways make the people have no knowledge, no desires—\nThat is, make the people have no knowledge of names and profits as desirable, so they have no desire for them.\nMake those who know dare not act—\nThat is, though the people may know of names and profits as desirable, they dare not act in contention or theft.\nYet even if they dare not act, they still retain the heart to do so—\nOnly they do not dare.\n\nTo act in non-action,\nThen there is nothing that is not governed.\n\n---\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao/Way by which the sage governs the world.\nLater generations of nourishment cultivators borrowed these words for their own teachings—\nThough their teachings may be refined, they are not the original intent of *Laozi*.\n\nThe Dao is boundless yet used—\nSometimes it does not fill.\nDeep, it seems the ancestral root of all things.\n*\"Boundless\"* originally refers to the emptiness of a washbasin—\nSome doubt the words, not daring to be certain.\nThe Dao’s essence is empty;\nThose who use this Dao must also be empty and not filled—\nIf filled, it is not the Dao.\n\n*\"Deep\"* means unfathomable.\n*\"Root\"* is like the ancestral root—\nThe root is the lineage’s foundation;\nThe Dao is the foundation of all things,\nThus it is called the ancestral root of all things.\n*\"Seems\"* is also a phrase of not daring to be certain.\n\nThe Dao blunts its sharpness,\nDissolves its entanglements,\nMutes its radiance,\nBlends with the dust.\n\nProfound, it seems as though it may exist.\n\n*\"Blunt\"* means to crush.\n*\"Sharp\"* means keen.\n*\"Entanglements\"* are knots.\n*\"Dissolve\"* means to unravel knots by dulling their sharpness.\n\nAll that is sharp must eventually dull—\nThus, first crush its own sharpness,\nTo dissolve the other’s entanglements,\nNot desiring its sharpness,\nThen there will never be a time when it dulls.\n\n*\"Mute\"* is like leveling.\nIt carries the meaning of suppression.\n*\"Blend\"* means to equalize and not differ.\nA mirror receiving dust loses its brightness—\nAll that is bright must eventually darken,\nThus, first suppress its own radiance to blend with the other’s dust,\nNot desiring its brightness,\nThen there will never be a time when it darkens.\n\nThat which is sharp must dull,\nThat which is bright must darken—\nJust as that which is full must overflow.\nThe Dao does not desire fullness,\nThus, the sharp is crushed and its sharpness is not desired,\nThe bright is muted and its brightness is not desired.\n\nThe two *\"its sharp\"* and *\"its bright\"* belong to the self,\nThe two *\"its entanglements\"* and *\"its dust\"* belong to others.\nOld interpretations reading this as four separate meanings are incorrect—\nThese four lines speak of the Dao’s use not being full.\n\n*\"Profound\"* carries the sense of serene stillness.\nThe Dao’s essence is empty,\nThus its existence here seems as though it may exist,\nYet it is not truly a thing that exists here.\nThis line speaks of the Dao’s emptiness.\n\n○ *Fu* sound: *Fu*.\nI do not know whose child it is—\nIt precedes the Emperor like an image.\n\nI do not know whose child—\nThis is the question.\nLike an image before the Emperor—\nThis is the answer.\n\n*\"Child\"* refers to what is born of father and mother.\n*\"Image\"* is Heaven, *\"Emperor\"* is its sovereign.\nHeaven has form, and *\"Emperor\"* is its ruler.\nSo, who is the Dao’s child?\nHeaven precedes all things,\nYet the Dao precedes Heaven—\nThus Heaven too is born of the Dao,\nAnd there is none before the Dao.\n\n○ *Fu* sound: *Fu*.\n\n---\n\nThe fourth chapter:\n*\"Heaven and Earth are without virtue,\nTreating all things as straw dogs;\nThe Sage is without virtue,\nTreating the people as straw dogs.\"*\n\n*\"Virtue\"* means to hold affection in one’s heart.\nA *\"straw dog\"* is bound grass shaped like a dog,\nUsed in rain prayers—\nOnce the prayer is done, it is cast aside,\nWith no further care.\n\nHeaven and Earth hold no affection for things,\nYet let them grow and complete themselves.\nThe Sage holds no affection for the people,\nYet lets them act and rest on their own.\nThus, the straw dog is the metaphor.\n\nIndeed, the Sage’s heart is empty,\nWith nothing to lean upon—\nIf he held affection for the people,\nHis heart would not be empty.\n\n○ *Fu* sound: *Fu*.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth—\nIs it not like the bellows?\n\nEmpty yet unyielding,\nMoving yet ever producing.\n\nThe bellows is a smith’s tool,\nA vessel to fan flames with breath and fire.\nThe outer casing, enclosing all around—*tu*.\nThe inner handle, stirring within—*kuai*.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, it is like the bellows:\n*Tu* mirrors the Great Void, embracing the boundless form,\n*Kuai* mirrors Original Qi, weaving the ceaseless flow.\nUnyielding means its motion is straight,\nEver producing means its birth knows no end.\n\nOnly because it is *tu*’s emptiness and *kuai*’s transformation—\nTransformation is ever extending,\nThus *kuai*’s motion and *tu*’s birth—\nBirth is ever enriching—\nWithin Heaven and Earth.\n\nIn the human realm, then,\nOnly when the heart is empty, uncluttered,\nAnd qi flows unobstructed along its paths,\nDoes qi move with constancy,\nAnd the abundance of life that emerges grow ever greater.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to guard the center.\n\n*Shu* means swiftness,\n*Qiong* means depletion of qi.\nWhen a person speaks much, their qi is drained,\nExhausting their reserves prematurely.\nBetter to keep the heart empty, steadfast in its place,\nSo that external things do not enter,\nAnd the inner spirit does not stray—\nThen its emptiness is boundless,\nAnd the qi it generates is boundless.\n\nThe *center* is the *tu*’s interior,\nWhere *kuai* performs its work.\n\n○ *Shu* sounds like *shuò*.\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe *Valley* symbolizes emptiness;\nEmptiness preserves the spirit within—\nThus, the *Valley Spirit*.\nThe *Valley* is the center’s dwelling place,\nAnd the spirit that guards it—\nNot dying means Original Qi endures without end.\n\nThe *Female* symbolizes the moist, weak, yielding nature of Original Qi.\nThe prefix *Mysterious* is an honorific.\nThe Mysterious Female—\nThe mother of all things—\nAs Zhuangzi called the *Taiyi*,\nSome name it the *Soul Treasure, Post-Heaven’s Ancestor*.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female—\nThis is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *gate* is the path of emergence,\nThe *root* is the path of birth.\nThe natural emptiness—\nThe source from which Heaven and Earth arise—\nThus, the *Root of Heaven and Earth*.\nThe Root of Heaven and Earth—\nThe beginning of Heaven and Earth—\nAs Zhuangzi called the *Ever-Nonbeing*,\nSome name it the *Primordial Origin, Pre-Heaven’s Ancestor*.\n\nEnduring, as if it exists—\nUsing it does not exhaust.\n\n*Enduring* means unbroken continuity,\n*As if* means *like*—\nThe spirit’s preservation,\n*Exhaust* means labor.\n\nWhen qi is used with ease, it is nourished and grows daily;\nWhen used with strain, it is depleted and wanes.\nThe spirit, if preserved within, ensures qi is not consumed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Five:**\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure and persist\nBecause they do not generate themselves—\nThus they endure and persist.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate all things with their qi,\nYet do not generate their own qi.\n\nThus the Sage places himself last,\nYet is first;\nSets himself aside,\nYet is preserved.\n\nIs it not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\n\n*Last* means humility, not seeking precedence,\n*First* means elevation, standing above.\n*Sets himself aside* means quietude, non-action, not seeking to augment life,\n*Preserved* means enduring, long-lasting in the world.\n*No selfishness* means placing himself last and setting himself aside,\n*Fulfills his selfishness* means being first and preserved.\n\nThe Sage does not *actively* fulfill his selfishness,\nYet naturally achieves being first and preserved.\nIf one assumes others seek to fulfill their selfishness,\nThen speaking of it would mean they *can* fulfill it.\n\n---\n**Chapter Six:**\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nWater benefits all things without striving,\nDwelling where people find repugnant—\nThus it approaches the Dao.\n\n*Highest virtue* means the supreme, ultimate virtue,\nThe virtue of those who embody the Dao.\nWhy is it like water?\nWater’s virtue lies in its ability to irrigate and cleanse,\nBenefiting all things without contention,\nNot seeking purity but dwelling in the low and filthy—\nThus it nears the virtue of the Dao.\n\n*Near* means close.\n\nTo dwell in good land,\nTo have a good heart like a deep well,\nTo associate with good people,\nTo speak with good faith,\nTo govern with good order,\nTo act with good skill,\nTo move at the right time.\n\nThese are the virtues that others deem good—\nTo dwell in good land is to secure a foundation,\nTo have a good heart is to be deep and still,\nTo associate with good people is to be close to the virtuous.\nTo speak with good faith is to be trustworthy,\nTo govern well is to value order,\nTo act with skill is to value competence,\nTo move at the right time is to act when opportunity arises.\n\nThese seven virtues all choose what others favor as good—\nThis may be called *good*, yet it is not the *highest virtue*.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nIs there no blame.\n\nOnly the highest virtue of the Dao—\nNot contending, yet content to dwell below,\nLike water—\nThus no one blames it.\n\n*Blame* means resentment.\nOthers dislike dwelling below but seek to rise,\nThose who desire to surpass others harbor contention,\nAnd contention brings blame.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seven:**\nTo grasp and fill—\nBetter to stop in time—\n\nTo measure and sharpen—\nYet this cannot be long preserved.\n\n*Hold* means to bear,\n*Stop* means to cease.\n*Measure* means to pound.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the Dao not desiring fullness,\nAnd yet compares it to sharpness,\nSaying that one who fills a basin with water cannot do so endlessly—\nWhen full, it easily overflows;\nBetter to cease before it fills.\n\nSimilarly, one who hones a needle’s point\nCannot long preserve its sharpness—\nForced too far, it breaks.\nThus, neither fullness nor sharpness can be long preserved.\n\n○ *Easy* rhymes with *bean* (豉).\n\nGold and jade fill the hall,\nYet none can guard them long;\nRich and noble yet proud,\nThey invite their own ruin.\n\nWhen merit is complete and fame is achieved, withdraw—\nThis is the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhy do some have gold and jade yet cannot guard them?\nBecause they grow proud in wealth and nobility,\nAnd thus invite their own ruin.\n\nTherefore, when merit is complete and fame is achieved,\nTo withdraw is to align with Heaven’s Way—\nThis is the teaching of not overfilling.\n\n*Gold and jade* means wealth.\n*Pride* means fullness.\n*Invite ruin* means self-inflicted fault,\nNot caused by others.\n*Ruined* means unable to guard it.\n*Merit complete and fame achieved* means nobility.\n*Withdraw* means not to overfill.\n\nHeaven’s Way is empty yet never full,\nThus the seasons follow their course,\nAnd what is accomplished departs.\n\nFirst wealth, then nobility—\nYet the two words *wealth* and *nobility* in the middle sentence\nUnify the before and after.\nOnly nobility contains wealth,\nAnd since nobility must bring wealth,\nThe two are interdependent.\nThus, pride and fullness destroy wealth—\nWhich is to say, they destroy nobility as well;\nWhile withdrawal and non-fullness preserve nobility—\nWhich is also to preserve wealth.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eight:**\n\nTo bear the *yīng* and embrace the One—\nCan one remain undivided?\n\nTo focus *qi* and attain softness—\nCan one become like an infant?\n\nTo purify and gaze into the void—\nCan one be without blemish?\n\n*Bear* is like *add*.\nThe *yīng* is the *camp* (of *yīn*), like the *camp* in *military camp*.\nThe *hun* (vital soul) is the *guard*, like *guard* in *bodyguard*.\nThe *yīng* is where soldiers dwell—\nWhen the spirit joins the *yīng* and the *yīng* embraces the *hun*,\nTheir union never separates,\nLike the sun and moon enduring through eternity.\nThis is the way of those beyond the world who preserve their form.\n\nTo focus *qi* within,\nInfusing flesh and bone with its warmth,\nAchieving extreme softness,\nLike an infant in the womb—\nThis is the way of those beyond the world who preserve their *qi*.\n\nThe spirit dwells in the eyes;\nWhen the eyes see, the spirit wanders outward.\nClosing the eyes to hide sight,\nDarkness becomes the void—\nYet even within the void, there remains perception,\nWhich is still a blemish.\nWhen perception within the void is also purified,\nAll illusions vanish,\nAnd only then is there no blemish—\nThis is the way of those beyond the world who preserve their spirit.\n\n○ *Divided* rhymes with *depart* (离).\n\nTo love the people and govern the state—\nCan one act without doing?\n\nThe Heavenly Gate opens and shuts—\nCan one be receptive?\n\nBright and far-reaching—\nCan one be without knowing?\n\nTo love the people and govern the state means\nThe ruler uses benevolence and wisdom for the people,\nYet the spirit remains outward and cannot yet unite within.\nBut though the body labors, it remains naturally serene,\nUnwearied—\nThis is the way of those in the world who nurture their form.\n\nThe Heavenly Gate opening and shutting refers to\nThe breath entering and exiting through the nose—\n*Qi* is divided outward and cannot yet be unified within.\nYet though the breath flows, it is smooth and refined,\nNot harsh—\nThis is the way of those in the world who nurture their *qi*.\n\nBright and far-reaching means\nThe eyes see light and gaze in all directions—\nThe eyes engage outward and cannot yet withdraw perception.\nYet though the eyes see, the mind and surroundings are forgotten,\nAnd nothing is discerned—\nThis is the way of those in the world who nurture their spirit.\n\nTo nurture and tend—\nTo give life yet not possess,\nTo act yet not rely,\nTo lead yet not dominate—\nThis is called *mysterious virtue*.\n\n*Nurture* refers to *qi* before it manifests;\n*Nurture* means to give life with constancy.\n*Tend* refers to *qi* once it has manifested;\n*Tend* means to gather without depletion.\n\n*Nurture* gives life though without intention to do so—\nThus, *not possess*.\n*Tend* acts though without intention to rely—\nThus, *not rely*.\nLike an official who governs though without intention to rule—\nThus, *not dominate*.\nThis is why it is called the *mysterious, unfathomable virtue*.\n\n○ *Tend* rhymes with *chastise* (畜).\n\nThe **sound** sustains.\n\nTo the right, the ninth chapter:\nThirty spokes converge at a single hub—\nYet it is their *emptiness* that gives the chariot its use.\nClay is molded into vessels—\nYet it is their *emptiness* that gives them their function.\nDoors and windows are carved for the dwelling—\nYet it is their *emptiness* that gives it its purpose.\nThus, *having* is for *advantage*,\nWhile *emptiness* is for *use*.\n\nThe spokes are the **rim’s** spokes.\nThe hub is the **wheel’s** core.\nThe *emptiness* is the hollow space within.\n*Clay* is the blended earth.\n*Molded earth* is the sticky, malleable part.\nTo *make vessels* means to mix water with sticky earth to form pottery.\nIn general, for dwellings, the east has doors, the west has windows—\nDoors for entering and exiting,\nWindows for light and ventilation.\nThe chariot carries burdens and travels far,\nThe vessel stores things,\nThe dwelling shelters people—\nThus, having this chariot, this vessel, this dwelling,\nAll serve the world’s *advantage*.\nHence, it is said: *Having* is for *advantage*.\n\nYet the chariot, without the hub’s hollow space to turn the axle,\nCould not traverse the earth;\nThe vessel, without its inner hollow space to hold things,\nCould not store them;\nThe dwelling, without doors and windows’ hollow spaces for entry and light,\nCould not shelter people.\nThe chariot’s use lies in its turning axle,\nThe vessel’s use lies in its capacity,\nThe dwelling’s use lies in its entry and light—\nAll depend on their *emptiness*.\nHence, it is said: *Emptiness* is for *use*.\n\nThe human body’s solid belly holds *qi* to sustain life—\nThis is called *advantage*.\nThe empty heart, free of attachments, nurtures *qi*—\nThis is called *use*.\nThus, these three things are used as analogies.\n\n○ *And* (和) – *Hu-wò* rhyme.\nTo the right, the tenth chapter.\n\nThe five colors blind the eyes,\nThe five tones deafen the ears,\nThe five flavors dull the palate,\nGalloping hunts and wild chases drive the mind to madness,\nRare and coveted goods disrupt one’s conduct.\nAll external desires are harms to the body.\n\n○ *Huàng-xià-mèng* rhyme.\n\nThus, the Sage cultivates the belly, not the eyes,\nAnd so discards the former to embrace the latter.\nThe Sage nourishes *qi* only by filling the belly,\nNot indulging the eyes for fleeting pleasures.\n\nTherefore, he utterly rejects all external falsehoods\nAnd takes only the singular truth within.\nAbove, the five afflictions—blindness, deafness, dulled palate, madness, and disrupted conduct—\nBelow, only the eyes are mentioned,\nFor one example suffices to encompass the rest.\n\nDong Si-Jing says:\nThe previous chapter spoke of the use of emptiness within,\nThis warns against being filled by external evils.\nYet the eyes must see, the ears must hear,\nThe mouth must taste, the body must labor,\nThe mind must respond—\nStill, one cannot be absolutely still.\nOnly when movement never departs from stillness\nDoes even motion not cling to things,\nAnd thus one remains serene and desireless.\n\nChasing after dust and clinging to phenomena all lose their true nature,\nAnd the root lies in the eyes—\nHence, it is spoken of from beginning to end.\nThe Master’s four \"do nots\" first say, \"Do not look.\"\nAmong the six senses and six dusts, the eye and color stand first.\n\n○ *Chéng-rù-xù-lì-mèng* rhyme.\n\nTo the right, the eleventh chapter.\n\nHonor and disgrace are like a startling shock,\nWealth and great calamity are like a burden to the body.\n\n\"Honor\" is like love—\nThe prestige of name and rank,\nWhich people regard as glory,\nYet upon reflection, is disgrace.\nThus, the enlightened do not love it,\nWhile those who love it are startled by it,\nMeaning they cannot forget it and let it disturb the mind.\n\n\"Wealth\" is like burden—\nThe riches of goods and money,\nWhich people regard as great benefit,\nYet upon reflection, is great exhaustion.\nThus, the enlightened do not prize it,\nWhile those who prize it treat it as a body burden,\nMeaning they cannot set it aside and let it weigh upon themselves.\n\nWhat is meant by \"honor and disgrace like a startling shock\"?\nDisgrace is lowly.\nTo obtain it is like a shock,\nTo lose it is like a shock.\nThose called \"disgrace\" are so because they are base and unworthy of exaltation.\nSome covet what they have not yet gained,\nAnd when they finally obtain it, they are startled.\nThey cling to what they have already gained,\nAnd when they lose it, they are startled.\nThus, they are startled by honor as if it were disgrace,\nHence, it is said: *Honor and disgrace are like a startling shock.*\n\nWhat is meant by *\"Wealth and great calamity are like a burden to the body\"*?\nMy great calamity arises because I have a body.\nWhen I have no body, what great calamity do I have?\nHumans in this life fret over countless worries,\nTrembling and preserving, only freed at death.\nThe body is a great calamity, beyond remedy.\nWealth and goods are external calamities—\nAbandoned and not possessed, how can they be a burden?\nSome do not know the lightness of external things,\nTreating them as heavy as their own body,\nFearful of losing what they possess,\nThus, they prize this great calamity as if it were their own body,\nHence, it is said: *Wealth and great calamity are like a burden to the body.*\n\n○ *Sàng-xī-làng* rhyme.\n\nTherefore, if one values the body as the world,\nOne can entrust the world to it;\nIf one loves the body as the world’s chaos,\nOne can commit the world to it.\n\nThe Son of Heaven’s exaltation,\nThe riches of the four seas,\nAll stem from treating the body as the world.\nThe enlightened cherish and honor this body,\nNot willing to use it lightly for the world,\nRather, they would prefer to have no world\nThan to lightly risk their body.\nOnly thus can they entrust the world to it.\n\n\"Entrust\" is like entrusting a hundred-li command,\n\"Commit\" is like committing a six-foot orphan.\nShun and Yu held the world without claiming it,\nThus they could receive the succession of Tang and Yu.\n\nThose who prize honor as disgrace and take it as glory,\nOr prize wealth as great calamity and take it as great benefit,\nAre vulgar indeed—\nHow could one entrust the world to them?\n\nTo value the body as the world,\nTo enrich the body as the world—\nThe Master’s intent is excellent,\nYet Yang Zhu’s \"for myself\" doctrine originates here.\n\n○ *Wéi-yún-wěi* rhyme.\n\nThe sound *fū*...\n\nThe sound *yù*.\n\n**Chapter Twelve:**\nThat which is seen but not seen is called *yí* (level),\nThat which is heard but not heard is called *xī* (rare),\nThat which is grasped but not obtained is called *wēi* (subtle).\nThese three cannot be interrogated or forced,\nThus they merge into one.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the manifestation of virtue’s traces:\nThe eye sees easily what is level—*yí* means even and boundless,\nSo it is not seen.\nThe ear hears easily what is dense—*xī* means sparse and distant,\nSo it is not heard.\nThe hand grasps easily what is vast—*wēi* means faint and indistinct,\nSo it is not obtained.\n*Yí*, *xī*, and *wēi*—though one might seek to exhaust their meaning,\nThey cannot be, thus they merge indistinctly into one.\nCalled *yí*, called *xī*, called *wēi*, called *one*—\nAll point to the constant virtue.\n\nAbove, it does not dazzle;\nBelow, it does not obscure.\n*Shéngshéng*—ineffable, returning to nothingness.\nIts upper reaches are not bright,\nIts lower reaches are not dim.\n\n*Shéngshéng*—continuously flowing without end,\nReturning to the formless.\nThis is called the form of no-form,\nThe image of no-image—*hūhuǎng*.\nIt is also called virtue.\nAbove and below, as the *Yijing* speaks of \"form above form, form below form.\"\n\n*Shéngshéng*—unbroken, flowing past and continuing.\n*Fù*—returning, restoring.\n\"Nothingness\" refers to the Dao.\nAbove virtue is the Dao—Dao is nameless, hence not dazzling.\nBelow virtue is things—things have form, hence not dim.\nVirtue lies between existence and nonexistence,\nThough seemingly named, it cannot be named;\nReturning to its origin, it merges into the Dao of nothingness—\nAs Zhuangzi says: \"When virtue reaches its peak, it returns to its beginning.\"\n\nThe Dao is nothingness, hence without form or image;\nVirtue has a name, hence can be formed and imaged.\nYet its form and image are not like those of things,\nThus: \"form of no-form, image of no-image.\"\nSeeming both present and absent—*hūhuǎng*.\nApproach it, and you see no head;\nFollow it, and you see no tail.\n\nHold fast to the ancient Dao\nTo govern the present.\nKnowing the ancient beginning—\nThis is called the \"memoir of the Dao.\"\n\nOnly because it is *hūhuǎng* and nameless,\nApproaching from before, following from behind—\nYet it is never seen.\nThe \"ancient\" refers to what precedes,\nThe \"present\" to what follows.\n\"Things\" are what the Dao scatters as virtue,\nIts flow pervading all things—\nThus: \"Hold fast to the ancient Dao\nTo govern the present.\"\nThe \"ancient beginning\" is the Dao—\nThat which preceded heaven and earth.\nThe \"memoir of the Dao\" is virtue—\nThe Dao dispersing as virtue,\nLike threads of silk, orderly yet unbroken.\nTo know this Dao is to know this virtue—\nThe record of the Dao.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirteen:**\nThe ancient skilled in being a *shì* (noble) were\nSubtle, mysterious, profound, and penetrating—\nDeep beyond recognition.\nOnly because they were beyond recognition\nDid they forcefully assume outward appearances.\n\nA *shì* is one with the Dao, universally responsive—*tōng*.\nMysterious in all things, penetrating without limit,\nSubtle yet not apparent, their penetration profound—\nLike water’s depth, unfathomable.\nTheir depths being unfathomable,\nThey forcefully modeled outward appearances to show others.\nThe seven descriptions below are these:\n\n*Yù*—like a winter crossing of a river,\n*Yóu*—like fearing four neighbors,\n*Yǎn*—like a guest’s solemnity,\n*Huàn*—like ice about to thaw,\n*Dūn*—like uncarved wood,\n*Kuàng*—like a valley,\n*Hún*—like muddy water.\n\n*Yù*—like the *yù* beast.\n*Yóu*—like a puppy.\nThe *yù* foresees ahead, moving hesitantly;\nThe puppy follows then turns back,\nThus hesitant and retreating—*yóu*.\nCrossing a river in winter, fearing neighbors—\nThus hesitant and retreating.\nOne with the Dao does not dare lead the world,\nTheir bearing such as this.\n\n*Solemn*—dignified and reserved,\nLike a guest—following without welcoming.\n*Huàn*—dissolving,\nLike ice about to release—melting yet not stagnant.\n*Dūn*—sincere and thick,\nLike uncarved wood—unfinished yet potential.\n*Kuàng*—vast and open,\nLike a valley—empty yet responsive.\n*Hún*—muddy and turbid,\nLike turbid water—beauty and flaw merge indistinctly.\n\n○ *Hún* sounds like *hú-gùn*.\n*Huàn* sounds like *xiè*.\n\nWho can make turbid still and gradually clear?\nWho can make settled move and gradually vitalize?\nFollowing the turbid’s question—who can make it turbid?\nTurbid is the time of motion; motion followed by stillness\nGradually clears.\nAgain, following stillness’s question—who can make it settled?\nSettled is the time of stillness; stillness followed by motion\nGradually vitalizes.\n*Settled* means steadfast stillness,\n*Vitalize* means active motion—\nFor only the turbid brings clarity,\nOnly the settled brings motion.\nThus, the vast are not full yet full,\nThe sincere are not tools yet tools,\nThe dissolving are not rigid yet rigid,\nThe solemn are not lords yet lords,\nThe hesitant are not leaders yet leaders—\nThis can be understood.\n\nThe Master’s intent is roughly this;\nLater chapters unfold it fully:\nCrooked becomes straight,\nHollow becomes full,\nDefective becomes new—\nThis is the intent.\n\nThose who preserve this Dao\nDo not desire fullness.\nOnly because they do not desire fullness\nCan they be defective without becoming new.\n*New* means complete.\nAll things, when defective, are incomplete;\nWhen new, they are complete.\nDefective and incomplete are not full,\nNew and complete are full.\nThose who preserve this Dao do not desire fullness,\nThus they remain defective without becoming new.\n\nThe seven appearances within this chapter—\nAll are defective yet not new.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Fourteen:**\nPush emptiness to its utmost,\nHold steadfast to stillness with sincerity.\n*Push*—to reach the extreme of *emptiness*,\n*Hold*—to guard stillness with depth.\n\nThe void is the absence of substance—\nexternal things do not enter within.\n*Extreme* means exhausting its essence.\n*Guard* means fortifying the inner while resisting the outer,\nlike the defense of a walled city.\n*Stillness* means immobility—\nthe inner mind does not stray outward.\n*Sincerity* means unflagging effort.\n\nWhen all things stir in motion,\nI observe their return.\n*Motion* is change—\nthe growth of plants, the awareness of animals,\nall are motion.\n*Return* means reversal—\nthings arise from stillness into motion,\nthus returning to their original stillness is *return*.\n\nPlants store their vital *qi* below,\nanimals settle their minds within.\nAll things, teeming and thriving,\neach return to their root.\n\nReturning to the root is stillness;\nstillness is *returning to the Way of Life*.\nTeeming describes their growth and motion.\n\nTake any plant:\nin spring and summer, vital *qi* rises from the root,\nreaching the branches and leaves—this is motion.\nIn autumn and winter, vital *qi* descends back,\nstoring itself in the root—this is stillness.\n\nThe *qi* of Heaven that generates all things is called *Life*.\nReturning to its original source is *returning to the Way of Life*.\n*Returning to the Way of Life* is constancy;\nknowing constancy is clarity.\n\nTo not know constancy is reckless action—disaster.\nKnowing constancy brings tolerance;\ntolerance brings impartiality;\nimpartiality brings sovereignty;\nsovereignty aligns with Heaven;\nHeaven aligns with the Dao;\nthe Dao endures eternally—\nthrough life’s end, no peril.\n\nConstancy is enduring without change—\nthose who grasp this are called *clear*.\nThe ignorant, unaware, cannot guard stillness\nbut act recklessly, harming their *Life*—\nthus, disaster.\n\n*Tolerance* refers to outward form manifesting externally;\nthose inwardly nourished bear a different appearance.\n*The impartial* are rulers of a realm,\nspeaking of preserving all they possess.\n*The sovereign* are rulers of the world,\nspeaking of encompassing all of Heaven and Earth.\n*Heaven* means unity with Heaven—\nunity with Heaven means the Dao resides within.\nThe Dao within means enduring as the Dao does.\n*End* means completion;\n*peril* means endangering life through depletion.\nThe character *peril* (殆) bears the radical of death (歹),\noften signifying fatality—\ndanger nearing death.\nDeath is the exhaustion of *qi* and its end;\nthus, *no peril through life’s end* means preserving vitality to completion.\n\nThe Great Dao:\nUnknown in its presence,\n\n---\n\nNext, they are cherished and praised;\nnext, they are feared and reviled.\nWhen *virtue/power* is insufficient, there arises distrust.\n\nThe *Great Dao* refers to the highest stage—\nin the age of the Great Dao, rulers and people forget each other in *wuwei*,\nand the people do not know their sovereign exists.\n\nThe next stage is the *transformative ruler*,\nwhere the people hold them in affection like parents;\nas *ren* and *yi* grow more pronounced,\nthey are not only cherished but also praised.\n\nThe next stage is the *wise ruler*,\nwhere the people revere them like deities;\nas wisdom becomes exhausted,\nthey are not only feared but also reviled.\n\n*Virtue/power* is the substance of the Great Dao.\nOnce the substance of the Great Dao becomes insufficient,\nit cannot match the ancient times,\nand so rulers govern the people with less than their full *virtue/power*,\ndrifting toward ornamentation—\nthus, the first decline is the use of *ren* and *yi*,\nthe second decline is the use of wisdom.\n\n○ *Great sound* is tranquil.\n*Yu*! How precious is speech.\nWhen deeds are accomplished and affairs fulfilled,\nthe common people say, *\"This is how things naturally are.\"*\nThis describes the workings of the *Great Dao* being unknown.\n\n*Yu*! As seen in the previous chapter.\n*Guì* means precious and honored.\n*Rán*—thus.\nTo treasure speech, not speaking lightly,\nlike a dog hesitating and retreating.\nThe Sage does not speak of *wuwei*,\nso the people silently receive its blessings,\neach living in peace;\nwhen deeds are done and affairs completed,\nthe people say, *\"This is how things have always been,\"*\nunaware of the sovereign’s grace.\n\nWhen the Great Dao is abandoned, *ren* and *yi* arise;\nwhen wisdom emerges, great deceit appears.\nThe earlier stage of the unknown sovereign is the Great Dao.\nCherishing and praising is *ren* and *yi*.\nFear and reviling is wisdom.\nFrom the Great Dao’s first decline to the second,\nthere are already three stages,\nand wisdom transforming into great deceit makes four stages in total.\nYet, when the Great Dao is abandoned and *ren* and *yi* arise,\nits decline is still gradual,\nbut when wisdom appears, great deceit follows swiftly—\nits change is swift indeed.\n\nThe division of these four stages\nresembles roughly the ranks of Emperor, King, Lord, Sage, and Talent\nas classified by Master Shao.\n\nWhen the six bonds of kinship are discordant, there are filial children;\nwhen the state is in chaos, there are loyal ministers.\n\nThis speaks of the matter of *ren* and *yi* arising when the Great Dao is abandoned, yet its meaning differs subtly from the passage above—merely an extension of the argument.\n\nThe six bonds of kinship: father and son, brothers, husband and wife.\nWhen superiors and inferiors, elders and juniors each follow their proper Way without discord, then filial children are merely fulfilling their natural duty—unknown as *孝 (xiao)*.\nOnly when the blind historian fails to honor his father, and the arrogant and haughty gather in rebellion, does one recognize the Great Yu’s filial son.\n\nThe state refers to the sovereign; the family refers to the minister.\nWhen sovereign and minister, superiors and inferiors each follow their proper Way without chaos, then loyal ministers are merely fulfilling their natural duty—unknown as *忠 (zhong)*.\nOnly when the tyrant Zhou of Shang fails as a sovereign, and wicked cliques assemble, does one recognize the loyal ministers of the Three Dynasties.\n\nTo abandon *ren* and discard *yi*, the people return to filial piety and parental kindness.\nTo abandon wisdom and discard intelligence, the people’s benefits increase a hundredfold.\nTo abandon cleverness and discard profit, thieves and robbers vanish.\n\n*Abandon* means to abandon without action.\n*Discard* means to discard without use.\n*Saintly wisdom* is intelligence.\n*Clever profit* is great deceit.\nTo lead the people with cleverness, to entice them with profit, to govern them through the arts of commerce and industry—like Guan Zhong governing Qi or Shang Yang governing Qin—this is what was spoken of above regarding the decline of the age into trivial pursuits.\n\nThis passage speaks of restoring governance to demonstrate the gradual return to the roots.\nTo abandon the Emperor’s *ren* and *yi* and return to the sovereign’s Great Dao, the people revert to their origins: children are filial to their fathers, fathers are kind to their children, as in the pure antiquity.\nTo abandon the King’s wisdom and return to the Emperor’s *ren* and *yi*, the people’s benefits increase a hundredfold compared to the King’s time.\nTo abandon the Hegemon’s clever profit and return to the King’s wisdom, though not yet reaching the Emperor’s time, their thoughts become profound and far-reaching, their governance and teachings refined, and thieves and robbers vanish.\n\nThese three stages are insufficient in *文 (wen)*, so they must have something attached.\nTo see the unadorned and embrace the uncarved—few private concerns, few desires.\nThese three refer to *ren*, *yi*, wisdom, and clever profit.\n*Attached* is akin to Zhuangzi’s *属 (shu)*—to adhere to the nature of *ren* and *yi*.\n\nThe sovereign’s Great Dao is rich in substance, lacking only in *文 (wen)*, gradually descending from the sovereign to attach to *ren* and *yi*.\nThe Emperor, finding the sovereign’s governance lacking in *文*, descends one rank from the Great Dao and attaches to *ren* and *yi*.\nThe King, finding the Emperor’s governance lacking in *文*, descends one rank from *ren* and *yi* and attaches to wisdom.\nThe Hegemon, finding the King’s governance lacking in *文*, descends one rank from wisdom and attaches to clever profit.\n\nEach of these three governances must have something attached because of their insufficiency in *文*, yet they do not know that the people of the Great Dao, outwardly appearing simple, inwardly guarding their purity.\n*素 (su)* is uncolored silk; *朴 (pu)* is uncarved wood.\nSubstance alone—what need for *文*?\nBecause they are pure and unadorned, the people, though having bodies, seem without bodies; their private concerns are few.\nThe people, though having minds, seem without minds; their desires are scarce.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen: Absolute Learning Brings No Worry**\nTo study daily is to increase, yet to do so in every matter—if one cannot know all, it becomes a source of worry.\nOnly by abandoning it and not doing so is there no worry.\n\nHow far apart are *唯 (wei)* and *阿 (e)*?\nHow different are *善 (shan)* and *恶 (e)*?\n\nBelow, it speaks of the worries that come with study.\n*唯* and *阿* are both responses—*唯* is correct and upright, *阿* is crooked and flattering.\n*几何* means they are not far apart at first.\n*何若* asks how far they are in the end.\nFor those who study responses, *唯* and *阿* are initially not far apart, but *唯* becomes good while *阿* becomes evil—their ultimate difference is vast. Thus, those who study *唯* fear lest they drift into *阿*—this is one of the things that causes worry.\n\nWhat people fear, they must fear.\nIts vastness knows no end.\n*荒 (huang)* means broad; *央 (yang)* means exhausted.\nTo fear *阿* as evil is to dare not flatter, yet this is but one matter.\nAll that people fear and dare not do must be feared—these matters are numerous and cannot be easily exhausted. This is why scholars have so many worries.\n\nThe multitude bustles and rejoices,\nlike feasting on the grandest sacrifice,\nlike ascending the Spring Terrace.\nI alone remain tranquil, as yet unmanifest,\nlike an infant before it smiles.\n\nThe bustling and harmonious—this is the appearance of joy.\n*Dapu*—this is tranquility.\n*Zhao*—like the faintest cracks in a tortoise shell.\n\nThe multitude of scholars pursue external pleasures to delight themselves,\nlike feasting on the grandest sacrifice, where the flavors are most exquisite,\nlike ascending the Spring Terrace, where the sights are most complete.\nBut I remain tranquil and still,\nmy passions yet unaroused,\nno trace of desire visible—\nlike an infant before it knows how to smile,\nunaware of the world’s joys.\n\n*Chéngchéng*—ah, as if without a place to rest.\n*Chéngchéng*—this means to dwell in things.\n*Ru wú suǒ guī*—this means to not cling to things.\n\nThe multitude all have abundance,\nwhile I alone seem bereft.\n*Yí*—this means lost.\nThe multitude rejoices in what they possess,\nbut I, with nothing gained, feel empty as if something were missing.\n\nAh, the heart of a foolish man—*dùndun*—\nlike the original *Hun Dun*, indistinct and undifferentiated,\na murky ignorance that discerns nothing.\n(Read as level tone; also as in Zhuangzi’s *yú fú*—*fú* meaning ignorance.)\n\nThe common folk are bright and clear,\nwhile I alone am dim and confused.\nThe common folk are sharp and discerning,\nwhile I alone am dull and obtuse.\nThe common folk take knowledge for wisdom,\nbut I alone am ignorant and foolish.\n\nDrifting—like the sea,\nwild—like wind with no end.\nLike floating upon the ocean,\ndriven by currents without knowing my course;\nlike the howling gales,\nrising without knowing where they cease.\n\nThe multitude all have purpose,\nwhile I alone seem stubborn and vulgar.\nThe multitude all have purpose—\nthey know their direction and their end.\n*Wán*—this is like a face numb as if paralyzed,\nunaware of pain or pleasure.\n*Bǐ*—this is the vulgar man.\nI alone am dull and ignorant,\nlike the simple folk of distant, remote lands.\nFor those who dwell in crowded cities are learned,\nwhile those in far-off, desolate places are ignorant.\n\nI alone differ from others,\nand cherish the *Mother*.\n\nThis sentence summarizes the eight preceding stanzas.\nFrom *\"What people fear\"* to *\"I alone seem bereft\"*—\nfour stanzas speak of how others strive for many talents,\nwhile I possess none.\nFrom *\"The heart of a foolish man\"* to *\"I alone seem stubborn\"*—\nfour stanzas speak of how others seek knowledge,\nwhile I know nothing.\nThis is why I differ from others,\nand what I cherish is the profound *virtue* of the Dao.\nThis *profound virtue*—\nall things draw nourishment from it, the *Mother* of all things,\nthus it is called *feeding the Mother*.\nThe phrase *\"feeding the Mother\"* appears in the *Rites of Zhou* [□ *Inner Chapter*],\nreferring to a wet nurse.\nMaster Sima says: *\"Nourishing the Original Unity.\"*\n\n(Note: *Shí* sounds like *sì* [successor].)\nEnd of the seventeenth chapter.\n\n---\n\n**Laozi’s Classic of the Way and Its Virtue: Commentary by Wu Cheng of Lingchuan**\n\n**Volume One Complete**\n#1 *Guarding it—guilt*: \"Guilt\" likely a redundant character.\n#2 *Formless form*: Original text omits *\"the form\"*—supplemented from the Yueya edition.\n\n**Volume Two**\n**Wu Cheng’s Commentary on the Lower Scripture of the Dao**\n\n*\"The manifestation of supreme virtue follows the Way alone.\"*\n\n*\"Supreme virtue\"* means abundant virtue. *\"Manifestation\"* refers to what exists and is visible. *\"Follows\"* means \"arises from.\"\n\nAll things originate from virtue. Whatever is visible in form and *qi* is the manifestation of virtue. Yet the reason virtue takes this form is that it arises from the Dao.\n\nThe Dao itself is but vague and indistinct. Virtue emerges from the Dao, yet the Dao itself is nothing. Virtue is what the Dao produces—seemingly both present and absent, unseen—thus it is called vague and indistinct.\n\n*\"Vague and indistinct, yet within it is essence;\nIndistinct and vague, yet within it are forms.\"*\n\nThese lines refer to virtue. *\"Essence\"* means the tangible forms that arise after things take shape. *\"Forms\"* refers to the *qi* that precedes their generation. Though virtue is vague and indistinct—neither fully seen nor unseen—what is visible in form becomes essence, and what is visible in *qi* becomes pattern, both of which belong to virtue.\n\nAncient scholars spoke of the boundless void where all things already exist—this is it.\n\n*\"Deep and dark, yet within it is purity.\"*\n\nThough vague and indistinct seem almost visible, they are still somewhat discernible. But deep and dark is utter obscurity—this is the Dao’s nothingness. These lines refer to the Dao; *\"purity\"* means virtue.\n\nWhat has essence and form is the coarse manifestation of virtue. Virtue itself, the source of essence and form, is its refined core. Zhuangzi said: *\"Take virtue as the root, the root as the essence.\"*\n\nThe earlier passage states that essence and form arise from virtue; this passage says virtue arises from the Dao. Its essence is most true, within it lies authenticity.\n\n*\"Its character is twofold—again referring to virtue. True* means the Dao. *Authentic* means real, synonymous with *true*. Essence and form are coarse, while virtue is refined—this refined aspect is the most true Dao within. Virtue contains the utterly real Dao.\n\nThe earlier passage says the Dao contains virtue; this says virtue contains the Dao—indeed, the Dao is virtue, virtue is the Dao. The first chapter declares: these two are one.\n\n*\"From ancient times to today, its name does not fade,\nTo observe all things in their beauty.\"*\n\n*\"Does not fade\"* means it endures. *\"Observe\"* is akin to *\"pervade.\"* *\"Beauty\"* means all things. Though all things’ beauty may change and perish, supreme virtue arising from the Dao remains unchanging from ancient times to today. Thus it is called *\"does not fade,\"* for it is constant amidst the impermanent beauty of all things.\n\n*\"How do I know all things are thus?\"*\n*By this.*\n\nThus it is. How then do I know that all things’ transformations and perishings are impermanent in this way? By this supreme virtue’s constancy, I know it.\n\n**Chapter Eighteen:**\n*\"Bent, yet whole; crooked, yet straight; hollow, yet full; worn, yet renewed; few, yet gain; many, yet confused.\"*\n\nBent (*qū*) is one principle. The *Yijing*, *Li Ji*, *Zhongyong*, and *Zhuangzi* all use *qū* to mean \"incomplete\" or \"asymmetrical\"—that which is not whole. Yet if one focuses single-mindedly on what is incomplete, refining one’s essence therein, extending laterally to the other, mastering one principle to reverse three, penetrating one to exhaust all ten thousand—over time, one will surely attain wholeness.\n\nIf from the outset one seeks wholeness, ambition swells and the heart labors, divided and undedicated, never achieving wholeness.\n\nCrooked (*wǎng*) is not straight. The inchworm bends and becomes crooked, yet thereby it stretches and becomes straight. Hollow (*wā*) is not full. A ditch or pit sinks and becomes hollow, yet thereby it receives water and becomes full. Worn (*bì*) is not new. Autumn and winter wither and become worn, yet thereby they meet spring and renew. Few (*shǎo*) is not many. Fewness leads to abundance—one sentence split into two: fewness is easier to possess, thus one accumulates and becomes many. Coveting many brings confusion, and in one thing, nothing is gained—how could one then become many?\n\nNot desiring straightness, not desiring fullness, not desiring renewal, not desiring abundance—yet beginning with *\"bent, yet whole\"*, these four are all extensions of *\"not seeking wholeness.\"*\n\nThus the Sage embraces *One* as the model for all under Heaven.\n\nThis sentence is the chapter’s central thesis, unifying the meaning above and below. *One* is the virtue of emptiness and voidness. *Model* (*shì*) is illustrated by a cart: high, one leans on the crossbar; low, one leans on the model. The Sage embraces this virtue of emptiness and voidness, moist and weak yet humble, as the model for all under Heaven—like the five principles above, all are the virtue of emptiness, self-placing in lowliness.\n\n*Jiào* (较) is pronounced *jiǎo* (角).\n\nNot self-displaying, hence enlightened;\nNot self-praising, hence renowned;\nNot self-boasting, hence accomplished;\nNot self-glorifying, hence enduring.\n\nOnly by not contending does one under Heaven find none who can contend with them.\n\nSelf-display is like self-flaunting; *enlightened* refers to the clarity of wisdom—one who does not self-display shines through obscurity. Self-praise is like self-exalting; *renowned* refers to the brilliance of name—one who does not self-praise grows ever more luminous. To boast of one’s deeds is *boasting*; *accomplished* refers to completed achievements. To arrogate one’s superiority is *glorifying*; *superiority* refers to abilities surpassing others. If one does not self-display, self-praise, boast, or glorify—yet concludes with *\"Only by not contending\"*—these four are all the remnants of *\"not contending.\"*\n\nThe ancients’ *\"bent, yet whole\"*—was this mere empty speech? Truly whole, and thus returned to it.\n\nThe three characters *\"bent, yet whole\"* were an ancient saying, which Laozi cited as this chapter’s opening. Within the chapter, *\"embracing One\"* is the guiding thread; *\"bent, yet whole\"* and the five following, *\"only by not contending\"* and the five above—ten matters in total—all are what *\"bent, yet whole\"* can encompass. Hence it is restated at the chapter’s end: *\"The ancients’ ‘bent, yet whole’—was this not sincere, a saying without substance? Rather, it is the genuine attainment of wholeness, and thus the effect of wholeness is returned to it.\"*\n\n**Chapter Nineteen:**\n*\"Rare speech is natural.\"*\n\nListening yet not hearing is *rare* (*xī*); rare speech is no speech. Those who attain the Dao forget speech, following only their natural state.\n\nA gusting wind does not last till morning; a sudden rain does not last till evening. Who does this? Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth cannot endure long, yet how much less so for humans?\n\n*Gusting* (*piāo*) is wild and swift; *sudden* (*zòu*) is abrupt and violent. From dawn till mealtime is *\"till morning\"* (*zhōng zhāo*); from dawn till dusk is *\"till evening\"* (*zhōng rì*). Not following one’s natural state and yet speaking lightly and impulsively—like Heaven and Earth’s gusting winds and sudden rains—all are contrary to nature’s constancy, becoming monstrous anomalies. Heaven and Earth, contrary to nature’s constancy, cannot endure long as monstrous anomalies, not lasting till morning or evening—how much less so for humans, not following nature?\n\nThus those who follow the Dao:\nThose who align with the Dao are in accord with the Dao;\nThose who align with virtue are in accord with virtue;\nThose who align with error are in accord with error.\n\nTrust is insufficient here; distrust is insufficient here.\n\nThose of virtue and Dao regard me as one, verified and harmonized—what separation is there? Those of error regard me as one, yet perhaps through their singular truth they awaken to my universal truth—thus all three kinds of people gain through my observation.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Not speaking is harmony; harmony and speech are not harmonious; speech and harmony are not harmonious—thus there is no speech.\"* Also, this is Laozi’s meaning of rare speech, naturalness, and mysterious unity.\n\nThose who align with the Dao, the Dao also gains from them;\nThose who align with virtue, virtue also gains from them;\nThose who align with error, error also gains from them.\n\nThe Way is only attainable by those of Dao.\n\nIf the substance of Dao is insufficient within oneself, then in relying upon others, one must inevitably depart from the true substance of Dao, and thus forcefully impose distinctions of right and wrong. How could such a one achieve mysterious unity?\n\nThose who stand on tiptoe cannot stand;\nThose who stride cannot walk.\nThose who see themselves are blind;\nThose who insist on being right are not manifest;\nThose who boast of their own merits achieve no true merit;\nThose who pride themselves in their virtues do not endure.\n\nIn the Way, these are called surplus food and superfluous limbs.\nThings may detest them, hence those of Dao do not dwell upon them.\n\nAgain, using human walking as an analogy for prior matters:\nStanding and walking arise naturally, yet some, beyond nature, seek to enhance their stature—\nraising their heels to stand taller,\nspreading their legs to stride wider—\ntemporarily so, yet unable to persist.\nUltimately, they cannot stand, cannot walk, and thus are ruined.\n\nSo too, those who see themselves will never truly see,\nthose who insist on being right will never truly shine,\nthose who boast of their merits will never truly achieve,\nthose who pride themselves in their virtues will never truly endure—\nsuch is their fate.\n\nWhat remains uneaten is called surplus;\nwhat grows as an appendage is called superfluous.\nThis applies to both humans and spirits.\n\nThose who see themselves, insist on being right, boast of their merits, or pride themselves in their virtues—\nif measured against the natural Way,\nare like surplus food that should not be eaten,\nor superfluous limbs that should not be borne.\nExceeding the natural measure, they are useless,\nand though they exist in both hidden and manifest realms,\nthose of Dao refuse to dwell upon them.\n\nSome say *xíng* (行) is read as *xíng* (形), as ancient characters were interchangeable.\nThe Sima family says: \"Discarding surplus food only makes others detest you;\nsuperfluous limbs only make you appear ugly.\"\nThe Su family says: \"Excess in eating and drinking brings illness;\nsuperfluous limbs bring burden.\"\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty**\n\nThe essence of this chapter lies in the two characters *natural*.\n\nSilent speech and mysterious unity—this is naturalness.\n\nThe drifting of wind, the suddenness of rain,\nstanding on tiptoe, striding wide,\nsurplus food, superfluous limbs—\nthese are not natural.\n\nThere exists a thing, indistinctly formed,\nborn before Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of *Dao as a thing*—here, *thing* refers to *virtue*.\nThis chapter speaks of *a thing indistinctly formed*—here, *thing* refers to *Dao*.\n\n*Mixed and complete*—unpartitioned wholeness.\nBorn before Heaven and Earth—\nthe beginning of Heaven and Earth, as in the first chapter,\nand the time before the Sovereign Pattern, as in the fourth chapter.\n\nSilent and boundless,\nit stands alone yet never changes,\nmoves in cycles yet never falters—\nthus it may be called the Mother of all beneath Heaven.\n\n*Silent*—utter stillness.\n*Boundless*—vast emptiness.\nIt speaks of having no sound, no form.\n\nStanding beyond all things, unchanging in opposition,\nit moves through all things, never exhausted—\nthus it is called the Mother of all beneath Heaven.\n\n*Mother* refers to *virtue*, yet virtue is what Dao accomplishes,\nhence it is called the Mother of all beneath Heaven.\n\nI know not its name—\nI call it *Dao*.\nForced to name it, I call it *Great*.\n\nThis thing cannot be named,\nyet as the source from which Heaven, Earth, and all things arise,\nI borrow the character *Dao* (道) to represent it.\n*Dao* is not its true name, but a substitute.\n\nThe substitute is insufficient, yet compelled, I name it *Great*.\nNothing is greater than Heaven, yet Heaven is within Dao—\nthus Heaven is not the greatest.\n\nThis Dao is vast beyond measure, containing all yet bearing none—\nthus the name *Great* is perhaps fitting.\n\n*Great* is called *Passing*;\n*Passing* is called *Distant*;\n*Distant* is called *Returning*.\n\n*Passing*—unending flow.\n*Distant*—boundless duration.\n*Returning*—the nameless void.\n\nFor all things exist, yet Dao exists in none—\nnonexistence and existence are opposites, hence *Returning*.\n\nThe single word *Great* is insufficient to encompass Dao,\nso it is further described as vast yet unceasing.\nUnceasing and enduring, enduring yet void—\nthis is Dao. If it had form, it would not be Dao.\n\nThe following passage states:\n*\"Returning is the movement of Dao;\nall things beneath Heaven arise from existence,\nexistence arises from nonexistence.\"*\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"At the utmost beginning, there was nonexistence;\nnonexistence had no name.\"*\n\nThis refers to the same.\n\nThus, Dao is great,\nHeaven is great,\nEarth is great,\nand the Sage-King is great.\n\nWithin the realm, there are four greats,\nand the Sage-King occupies one of them.\n\n*Sage-King* refers to the positioned Sage.\n\nThough Dao is the greatest throughout past and present,\nwith none to compare, why then speak of Heaven, Earth, the Sage, and Dao as four greats?\n\nHeaven and Earth attain greatness through Dao,\nthe Sage attains greatness through Dao—\ntheir greatness comes from possessing Dao.\n\nThe *King* is followed by *also*,\nand it is specially noted that the King occupies one—\nfor the greatest *qi* is Heaven,\nthe greatest form is Earth,\nwhile the Sage’s body stands slight between them.\nSince his Dao aligns with Heaven and Earth,\nhis greatness also aligns with theirs,\nand is not measured by the size of his *qi*, form, or body.\n\nHumans model Earth,\nEarth models Heaven,\nHeaven models Dao,\nDao models naturalness.\n\n*Humans* refers to the Sage.\n*Model* means to align, as with a level—\nthe Sage’s greatness comes from aligning with Earth,\nEarth’s greatness comes from aligning with Heaven,\nHeaven’s greatness comes from aligning with Dao,\nDao’s greatness comes from being natural.\n\nIt is not that there exists another *naturalness* beyond Dao—\n*naturalness* is the void without name.\n\n**Chapter 21**\nHeavy is the root of light,\nstillness the sovereign of agitation.\nRoot means origin;\nagitation means motion;\nsovereign means master.\nLight takes heavy as its origin,\nmotion takes stillness as its master.\n\nThus, the virtuous one walks all day without leaving his baggage train.\nThe virtuous traveler rides in a fine carriage,\nthe teacher rides in a war chariot—\nboth are light vehicles.\nBehind the light chariot comes the baggage wagon,\nladen with bedding, clothing, food, and necessities—\nthis is the heavy wagon.\nThough riding in a light chariot, the virtuous one is called *shànrén*—\none skilled in affairs.\nThe unvirtuous one is called *bùshànrén*—\none unskilled in affairs.\n\nA teacher is one whom people revere and take as a model.\nResources are like wealth given to others,\nenabling them to rely upon it and thereby achieve something.\nIf one is virtuous and the other is not,\nwhen their virtues and flaws are contrasted,\npeople clearly see that the latter does not measure up to the former—\nthen the virtuous one may serve as teacher to the unvirtuous.\n\nIf one is unvirtuous and the other is virtuous,\nwhen their flaws and virtues are contrasted,\npeople see that the former falls short of the latter—\nthen the unvirtuous one becomes a resource for the virtuous.\nThis is called *zī*—\nto use another’s flaws to establish one’s own virtue.\nYet virtue and vice are opposing names—\nhow could there be a world of the Dao?\n\nThe following text states:\nThe enlightened one makes the world’s people\nneither claim the name of virtue\nnor the name of vice.\nThey neither honor their teacher\nnor cherish their resources.\nThough knowing the great confusion,\nthis is called *yàomiào*—\nthe utmost subtlety.\n\n*Ài* means to take pleasure in.\n*Yào* means the utmost extreme.\n*Miào* means profound and unfathomable.\nThough the unvirtuous encounter the virtuous,\nthey may take them as teachers,\nyet they do not honor them—\nfor they do not wish to name them as virtuous.\nThough the virtuous encounter the unvirtuous,\nthey may use them as resources,\nyet they do not cherish them—\nfor they do not wish to name them as unvirtuous.\nThe names of virtue and vice are both extinguished,\nall uniformly merged in the Mysterious Oneness—\nindiscriminable, even the wise are greatly confused,\nnot knowing which to hold as virtue or vice.\nThis is the utmost subtlety, called *yàomiào*.\n\n**Chapter 23**\nThe first two sections speak of the Sage’s virtue beyond naming,\nthe latter two of ordinary people’s virtue and vice being named.\nThe unnamed, unexalted virtue is called *xímíng*—\nthe concealment of brilliance.\nThe undifferentiated virtue and vice is called *yàomiào*.\n\nKnowing whiteness while guarding blackness\nis the model for all under Heaven.\nTo be the model for all under Heaven\nis to maintain unerring virtue,\nreturning to the Boundless.\n\nKnowing strength while guarding weakness\nis the stream for all under Heaven.\nTo be the stream for all under Heaven\nis to never depart from virtue,\nreturning to the infant.\n\nKnowing honor while guarding humiliation\nis the valley for all under Heaven.\nTo be the valley for all under Heaven\nis to have sufficient virtue,\nreturning to the uncarved block.\n\nThis chapter’s intent is to return from virtue to its origin,\nrestoring the Way of the Primordial.\nVirtue is the unfilled, voided virtue,\nthus preferring black to whiteness,\nweakness to strength,\nhumiliation to honor.\nThough knowing what to guard,\none may admire the other’s excellence,\nyet prefers to hold fast to this and remain lowly.\n\nThe model of the carriage,\nthe stream of flowing water,\nthe valley—\nall mean to remain lowly.\nThus, one’s virtue remains unerring,\nnever departing, and suffices within oneself.\nHaving preserved this voided virtue,\none may return to the Primordial Way—\nas Zhuangzi says, *\"When virtue reaches its peak, it returns to its origin.\"*\n\nThe Boundless,\nthe infant,\nthe uncarved block—\nall illustrate the Primordial Way.\nThe uncarved block, when scattered, becomes vessels;\nthe Sage, when employed, becomes officials.\nThus, the Great Measure does not cut.\nThe uncarved wood retains its full natural essence;\nonce split, it becomes shaped vessels.\nThe Sage, before use, preserves the integrity of inner virtue;\nonce revealed, becomes officials of the realm.\nThe ruler of all under Heaven is the Son of Heaven;\nthe ruler of a state is the feudal lord.\nThe first three sections speak of returning from the branches to the root;\nthese two lines speak of returning from the root to the branches.\n\nYet though the block is already scattered, it still longs to return whole—\nas if it had never scattered.\nThough the Sage is already employed, they still long to return whole—\nas if they had never been used.\nFor what is not scattered is scattering,\nwhat is not used is using.\nWhatever is cut requires a blade to sever its wholeness,\nbut the Great Measure cuts without cutting—\nthus it does not sever.\n\nThe Great Scattering is not scattering,\nthe Great Use is not using—\nalso like the Great Measure that does not cut.\n\n**Chapter 24**\nIf one would take all under Heaven and act upon it,\nI see that it cannot be done.\nTo take all under Heaven means to make it willingly submit to oneself.\nTo act means to force it.\nIf one’s virtue is abundant,\nthe people will submit of their own accord.\nIf one instead uses force,\nhow could they willingly submit?\n\nAll under Heaven is a divine vessel—\nit cannot be acted upon.\nTo act upon it brings ruin,\nto grasp it brings loss.\nThe vessel of all under Heaven is the greatest of instruments,\ngoverned by the divine—\nit cannot be seized by force or scheming.\nRuined means it fails;\nthose who act upon it with force,\ndesiring success, instead fail—\nfor they cannot make all under Heaven submit to them.\nThus, the one who acts upon it brings ruin.\n\n**Chapter 25**\n\nTo take Heaven under Heaven before having it is already impossible to achieve through action, and to retain it after having it is also impossible to preserve through deliberate scheming. It is like a precious vessel—if one constantly clutches it in hand, never letting it go for an instant, fearing it might be lost, one will instead fail to safeguard it from ruin and loss. Hence, it is said: *\"To grasp it brings loss.\"*\n\nAll things either move forward or follow behind, either warm with breath or chill with wind, either grow strong or weaken, either flourish or collapse. Therefore, the Sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes extravagance. This continues the thought from *\"To grasp it brings loss\"* in speaking of the Way of retaining Heaven under Heaven.\n\nThose who hold Heaven under Heaven—how can they ensure it will always remain theirs without perishing? The cycles of gain and loss, survival and ruin, are like the eight opposites—forward and following, breath and wind, strength and weakness, flourishing and collapse—contrasting yet interdependent. The Sage knows this inevitable progression and governs accordingly.\n\nAll things that grow too strong must decline, and decline is the beginning of ruin. Only by preventing excess can one avoid decline—and thus, ruin. Excess, extravagance, and extravagance are the times of utmost fullness. To remove excess is to keep things in a state of moderation. To remove extravagance is to keep things in a state of simplicity. To remove extravagance is to keep things in a state of restraint. If one does not allow things to grow too strong, then Heaven under Heaven can be preserved from ruin.\n\nMaster Zhao said: *\"Drinking wine should only reach a light intoxication, never full drunkenness; admiring flowers should stop at half-bloom, never until they wither.\"* This is the same meaning.\n\nMaster Su said: Some things move forward, others follow behind; some warm with breath, others chill with wind; some grow stronger, others weaken; some flourish, others collapse. These are the natural ways of things, inevitable forces that cannot be avoided. The foolish cling to self-interest and seek gain, attempting to resist or defy them—only to meet disaster, either in ruin or defeat. Only the Sage knows these cannot be reversed, so they follow them naturally, removing excess, removing extravagance, removing extravagance, preventing them from reaching extremes, and thus Heaven under Heaven faces no calamity.\n\nMaster Dong Si said: The Sage knows that the interplay of circumstances is the natural order, so they follow nature without allowing things to overflow and exceed.\n\n---\n\n**On aiding the ruler with the Dao, one does not use force to dominate Heaven under Heaven. Such actions invite retribution.**\n\nMaster Wang said: Even when aiding the ruler with the Dao, one must not use force to dominate Heaven under Heaven—how much less should the ruler themselves, who embody the Dao?\n\nMaster Su said: The Sage uses arms only when absolutely necessary. If one uses force to dominate Heaven under Heaven without necessity, even if they succeed, disaster will return to punish them. The kings of Chu, Qi, Qin, and Han—some perished themselves, others brought ruin to their descendants. These are the things men abhor, the things ghosts detest, and none have escaped.\n\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow. After a great campaign, there will surely be years of famine.\n\nMaster Zheng’s commentary: The army seizes the people’s strength, so thorns and brambles grow; the ruler defies the natural order, so there are years of famine.\n\nMaster Su said: Where the army is, farming is neglected, fields lie fallow. After war, the killing energy prevails, and crops are ruined. This is true of all wars—how much more so when using force to dominate Heaven under Heaven?\n\nThe virtuous act decisively but do not seek to dominate. They act decisively without arrogance, without boasting, without pride, and only when there is no other choice—this is called acting decisively without domination.\n\nThe best use of arms is to resolve chaos in a single decisive moment, not to delay battle for victory and claim it as domination.\n\nMaster Su said: *\"Do not boast, do not glory, do not be proud, act only when there is no other choice\"*—these are the ways of not dominating.\n\nThings that flourish must grow old—this is called *not the Way*. *Not the Way* brings early ruin. Those who follow the Way remain like infants or young children, and thus do not grow old. But those who grow old like the strong must inevitably grow old—this is *not the Way*. *Not the Way* brings early ruin, meaning they cannot endure.\n\nMaster Su said: All things that grow strong must grow old—there is no exception. Only those who follow the Way, though complete, appear incomplete; though full, appear empty; never growing strong, thus never growing old, never dying.\n\nTo dominate Heaven under Heaven with arms is the height of strength—how could it not grow old?\n\nFine arms are an omen of misfortune. Things often resent them, so those who follow the Way do not dwell upon them. *\"Fine\"* here means *\"praised.\"* *\"Misfortune\"* means no blessings, only disaster. *\"Dwell upon\"* means to willingly take up such a path.\n\nThe gentleman, at home, values the left; in war, values the right. This speaks to the reality of not dwelling upon it—preferring the position one does not normally occupy, refusing to place oneself in the role of war.\n\nArms are instruments of misfortune, not the tools of the gentleman. Used only when there is no other choice, they should be approached with calm indifference.\n\nVictory is not a cause for celebration—it is an instrument of killing, a bringer of disaster, not a joyous deed. *\"Calm\"* means without delight; *\"indifference\"* means without attachment—this is not what the heart desires. *\"For the superior\"* means it is praiseworthy not to delight in war. Victory, though achieved, is not a cause for pride. To take pride in victory is to take pleasure in killing. Those who take pleasure in killing cannot achieve their aims in Heaven under Heaven.\n\nThis extends the idea that victory is not a cause for celebration. If one regards victory in war as a praiseworthy deed, then one takes pleasure in killing—and such cannot achieve their aims in Heaven under Heaven. Ultimately, this is a warning.\n\nJoyous matters are honored on the left; ominous matters on the right. The left general is stationed on the left, the supreme general on the right.\n\nThis further elaborates the earlier meaning of not dwelling upon things.\n\nWhen many are killed, one should mourn them with tears of sorrow; when victorious in war, one should conduct the rites as for a funeral. This again expounds the earlier meaning of not finding it beautiful.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Six**\n*The Dao is ever nameless.*\nThis speaks of the Dao.\nThough *pu* is small, none under Heaven dare to submit to it.\nIf lords and kings can uphold it, all things will willingly submit to them.\n*Pu* refers to the Dao—though it pervades the six directions, gathering it cannot fill a single grasp, hence it is called \"small.\"\nThe most exalted is the Dao; thus, those who embody this Dao can rule all under Heaven, and none under Heaven dare submit to them.\n\"Lords\" refers to rulers of a single state; \"kings\" refers to rulers of all under Heaven.\nIf they can uphold this Dao, then all things will honor them as sovereign, and willingly submit.\n*Self* here means not that I desire them to be so, but that they are so of their own accord.\nHeaven and Earth unite, and sweet dew descends.\nNo one commands it, yet it is evenly distributed.\nThe function of the Dao is universal under Heaven, like the qi of Heaven and Earth uniting to descend as sweet dew—though no one directs it, it naturally reaches all things.\nAll things are nourished within this Dao, so those who embody the Dao can be sovereign over all things, and all things willingly submit to them.\nMaster Su said: The sweet dew covers all things without exception.\nThe Sage embodies the Dao to respond to all existence, just as dew reaches everywhere, thus able to make all things submit.\n\n*At first, there was naming.*\nThis speaks of *virtue/power*.\n*At first* refers to the Dao.\n*To make* is to create.\nJust as saying \"to make\" is to do.\nThat which has a name is *virtue/power*.\nThe Dao is nameless; when the Dao acts as *virtue/power*, then it has a name.\nNow that the name exists,\nThen one should also know when to stop.\nKnowing when to stop prevents ruin.\nWhen the Dao, though nameless, acts as *virtue/power*, then the name exists.\nThus, those who use this *virtue/power* should know to stop at *virtue/power*, not descending further.\n*Jiang* is like the *Jiang* people’s *jiang* (general), a term used in speech without urgency.\nLaozi ranks the Dao as the highest *virtue/power*, saying it is above *virtue/power*, and *ren* as the lower *virtue/power*, saying it is below *virtue/power*.\nHe also says: lose the Dao, then there is *virtue/power*; lose *virtue/power*, then there is *ren*; lose *ren*, then there is *yi*; lose *yi*, then there is *li*.\nThus, he emphasizes *Dao* and *virtue/power* while dismissing *ren* and *yi*, for *ren* and *yi* are inferior to *virtue/power*.\nThis chapter speaks of *virtue/power* and says, \"Then one should also know when to stop.\"\nIts meaning is: from non-being to being, one should know to stop at *virtue/power* and not descend further.\nIf *virtue/power* has a name, it is already inferior to the Dao. Can it descend further to *virtue/power*?\nKnowing to stop at *virtue/power* is still not far from the Dao.\n*Not ruin* means not to be exhausted or depleted, meaning it can endure long without decay.\nMaster Su said: Would the Sage pursue fame while forgetting *pu* or chase the superficial while losing the fundamental? Thus, he rides through all transformations without ruin.\nThe Dao’s presence under Heaven is like rivers and valleys converging into the sea.\nThe earlier text spoke of going from non-being to being, stopping at *virtue/power*.\nThis again speaks of returning from being to non-being, returning to the Dao.\nTruly, the Dao’s presence under Heaven is like the sea, where all streams converge.\n*Virtue/power* is like the valleys and streams—when *virtue/power* returns to the Dao, it is like these streams uniting in the sea.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\n*Knowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is enlightenment.*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Eighth**\n\nHe who overcomes others has strength, but he who overcomes himself is strong.\nThe wise know others—this is mere outward wisdom.\nHe who knows himself can fully realize his true nature, and thus is called *enlightened*.\nHe who has strength can overcome others—this is mere outward force.\nHe who overcomes himself can conquer his own self, and thus is called *strong*.\n\nThe contented man is rich; the resolute man has will.\nHe who fully realizes his true nature and aligns with *Dao*’s decree\nlacks nothing to covet and always has abundance—only the *enlightened* can do this.\nHe who conquers himself and courageously pursues goodness\nholds firm to his principles and never falters—only the *strong* can do this.\n\nHe who does not lose his foundation endures long;\nhe who dies yet does not perish attains true *longevity*.\nOnly the *enlightened* and the *strong*\nreveal the true and uphold the firm,\nuntil all dross is purified and functions are perfected,\nthought and action merge, and spirit and transformation coalesce.\n\nIn life, he abides where he is, yet his mind remains unlost, steadfast from beginning to end—thus he is called *enduring*.\nAfter departing this world, though his dwelling is gone, his mind persists, undivided through ages—thus he is called *long-lived*.\n\n---\n**A Questioner Asked:**\nThe *Way* of Laozi holds that obscurity is *enlightenment*, weakness is *strength*—yet this chapter speaks of *enlightenment* and *strength*. How so?\n\n**Response:**\nLaozi’s *enlightenment* is not true obscurity within; outwardly, it appears so.\nHis *strength* is not true weakness within; outwardly, it seems so.\nHis obscurity and weakness are remedies for external concerns.\nHis *enlightenment* and *strength* are prescriptions for the inner self.\nBoth paths proceed without contradiction.\n\nThe Great *Dao* is vast—it can be taken from left or right.\n*Vast* means boundless, like water overflowing.\nThe *Dao*’s breadth pervades all—now left, now right—\nwherever it is, it is there; take it from any side, it is always sufficient.\n\nAll things rely on it to live, yet it does not claim credit.\nWhen its work is done, it does not dwell on it.\nIt clothes and covers all things yet claims no mastery,\never without desire—this may be called *small*.\n\nThis elaborates on how all things rely on it to live, yet it does not claim credit.\nIn spring’s birth, the *Dao* pervades all things,\nclothing them like garments, covering them like blankets—\nthe *Elemental* and *Prosperous* spreads through all classes.\nThe *Elemental* and *Prosperous* is its universal reach,\nyet the *Dao* does not rule as their master.\n*Ever without desire* means it acts without intent.\nThis is the One branching into myriad forms—\nthe *Dao*’s division reaching its smallest extent.\nCan it truly be called *small*?\nIndeed, it cannot.\nIf it could be named, then it would not be the *Dao* of\nnot claiming credit, not ruling, and being without desire.\n\nIt nourishes all things, yet none know its mastery—\nthis may be called *great*.\nThis elaborates on how, when its work is done, it does not dwell on it.\nIn winter’s retreat, all things return to their roots,\nconverging into unity—\nthe *Advantageous* and *Enduring* secures the sacred origin.\nThe *Advantageous* and *Enduring* is its return to unity,\nyet none know who rules them.\nThis is the myriad forms merging into the One—\nthe *Dao*’s totality reaching its greatest extent.\nCan it truly be called *great*?\nIndeed, it cannot.\nIf it could be named, then it would not be the *Dao* of\nnot dwelling on its work, or being unknown as master.\n\nSome may doubt that beneath *unknown master*, the phrase *ever without name* is omitted.\nThe phrases *may be called small* and *may be called great*\nare rhetorical questions, not direct assertions.\nThough the word *hu* (乎) is absent at their ends,\nits implication remains, as in:\n*Can one truly not depart from it?*\n*Can one truly be like an infant?*\n*Can one truly be without blemish?*\n\n能无为乎？\n能为雌乎？\n能无知乎？\nThough the phrase *\"one origin without six characters\"* lacks the *\"hu\"* (乎), interpreters must still infer its interrogative intent—such is its pattern.\n\nAgain, as in the *Great Odes* it says:\n*\"Is the Zhou dynasty not illustrious?\"*\n*\"Are the Emperor’s commands not timely?\"*\nYet the poetry simply states:\n*\"The Zhou is not illustrious,\"*\n*\"The Emperor’s commands are not timely,\"*\n—of the same kind.\n\nThus, the Sage can achieve the *great* precisely because they do not claim it for themselves, and so they achieve the *great*.\n\nThis chapter speaks of the *Dao* of Heaven and Earth, yet concludes with the Sage—for the Sage is one with Heaven and Earth.\nWhen the year’s work is complete, all things return—\nthe *Dao* reaches its greatest extent,\nyet Heaven and Earth do not dwell on their work,\nand all things remain unaware of their master.\nThus, though the *Dao* of Heaven and Earth is great,\nthey do not consider themselves great.\n\nSo too the Sage—\nand thus they can achieve the *great*,\nfor though their *Dao* is great,\nthey do not claim it as their own,\nand so they achieve the *great* indeed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Twenty-Nine**\n*Grasping the Great Image, the world turns toward it.*\n*Turning toward it brings no harm—*\n*peace, stability, and ease.*\n\n*\"Grasping\"* means embodying without defiance.\n*The Great Image* is the *Dao*—\nas the next passage states:\n*\"The Great Image has no form; the *Dao* is hidden, nameless.\"*\n\n*\"Turning\"* means returning.\n*\"No harm\"* means *advantage*.\nIt speaks of the Sage who embodies the *Dao*—\ntoward whom all under Heaven turn.\nOnce the people turn,\nthe Sage governs by not exploiting their advantage.\nFor if one exploits advantage with advantage,\nthere is both advantage and harm.\nBut if one governs by not exploiting advantage,\nthere is constant advantage without harm—\nand so the people may dwell in enduring peace,\nenduring stability,\nenduring ease.\n\n*Political Harmony* comments:\n*\"Peace means no danger; stability means no deceit;*\n*ease means comprehensive governance.\"*\n\n*Music and feasts—*\n*guests depart, leaving only passing delight.*\n*The *Dao* spoken of is bland, without taste.*\n*To see it is insufficient; to hear it is insufficient.*\n*To use it is to exhaust it not.*\n*\"Exhaust\"* means *complete*—\nfor all external advantages cannot endure,\nyet the *Dao*’s advantage to humanity,\nthrough not exploiting advantage,\nendures.\n*Music* refers to songs, dances, and festive appearances;\n*feasts* refer to food and banquets, to hospitality.\nThough music and feasts are set to delight guests,\nonce the guests have passed,\ntheir sounds and flavors cease—\na fleeting pleasure that cannot last the day.\nBut the *Dao* is not like feasts to be consumed,\nnor like music with sounds and forms to be seen or heard—\nyet to use it brings enduring peace,\nenduring stability,\nenduring ease,\nwithout ever being exhausted.\nIt is not mere fleeting delight—\nhence, *\"its use cannot be exhausted.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty**\n*When one seeks to gather,*\n*one must first let it expand;*\n\n**Chapter Thirty-One**\n*When one seeks to weaken it,*\n*one must first make it strong;*\n*when one seeks to discard it,*\n*one must first exalt it;*\n*when one seeks to take it,*\n*one must first give it.*\nThis is called *subtle luminosity*.\n\n*Obscure* means *close*; *expand* means *open*.\nLaozi speaks of *reversal* as the movement of the Dao,\nand says, *\"The profound virtue is deep and distant,\ncontrary to all things.\"*\nThus, what he does is broadly contrary to common perception,\nmaking him inscrutable.\nHence, he uses these eight paired events as analogies,\nculminating in the six characters: *soft overcomes hard, weak overcomes strong*—\njust as the previous chapter first used five analogies—\n*good governance, good speech, good strategy, good closure, good resolution*—\nto illustrate its meaning.\n\nThe strategists of Sunzi and Han Feizi\nemployed their schemes to ensnare others in ruin,\nyet people remained unaware.\nScholars claim this stems from Laozi’s teachings,\nthough their misuse distorts his intent.\nWho would dare accept Laozi’s \"giving\" and still suspect his motives?\nThis is excessive doubt.\n\nThe commentators, seeking to defend him,\nresort to evasion—\nboth failing to grasp the truth.\n\nWhat cannot be seen is called *subtle*;\n*subtle luminosity* means concealing what is visible,\nmaking it unseen—\njust as the previous chapter spoke of *borrowing luminosity*.\nPeople see only the expanding, strengthening, exalting, and giving,\nyet fail to perceive the intended obscuring, weakening, discarding, and taking.\nThus, it is called *subtle luminosity*.\n*Obscure* is pronounced *xī*.\n\n*Soft overcomes hard, weak overcomes strong.*\nIf they are hard and I seek to overcome them with hardness,\nif they are strong and I seek to overcome them with strength—\nis this not difficult?\nBut if I treat myself with softness and weakness,\nthe hard and strong will not resent me,\nand yet I shall ultimately overcome them—\nhow so?\nBecause I act contrary to their expectations,\nmaking them inscrutable.\n\nMaster Su said:\n*When the world’s hard and strong clash,*\n*I alone remain soft and weak in waiting.*\n*When the great are wounded and the small perish,*\n*I, without contention, await their demise—*\n*this is how I overcome them.*\n\nYet the Sage does not deliberately act thus to conquer things.\nHe knows the natural course of affairs\nand abides in their natural order.\n\nFish cannot escape the depths,\nnor should a state’s sharpest tools be displayed.\nIf fish escape the depths,\nthey are easily seized by others.\nIf a state’s sharpest tools are displayed,\npeople see their use and seek to emulate or surpass them—\nthen my advantage is no longer advantageous.\n\nIf fish remain in the depths,\nif sharp tools are not displayed,\nthey become inscrutable—\nthis is *subtle luminosity*.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Two**\nThe Dao acts without action,\nyet nothing remains undone.\nThe Dao’s *non-action* endures without change,\nnot merely for a moment—\nhence, it is called *constant non-action*.\nThough it does nothing,\nit accomplishes all that must be done.\nIf *non-action* leads to neglect,\nwhat use is there in *non-action*?\n\nThis *non-action* is simply being at ease in one’s nature.\nIf lords and kings could uphold it,\nall things would transform of their own accord.\n\nIf lords and kings could uphold this *non-action*,\nthough they had no intention of transforming things,\nthings would transform themselves.\nWhen transformation is about to arise,\nI shall restrain it with the *nameless simplicity*.\nThe *nameless simplicity* will then desire nothing.\n*Desire* means deliberate action.\n*Arise* means *emerge*.\nThose who have not yet fully attained the Dao of *non-action*\nwill, upon seeing things transform, impulsively desire to guide them—\nbut once desire arises, it is no longer *non-action*.\n*I desire what arises from me*—\n*restrain* means to suppress and settle.\n*The nameless simplicity* refers to this Dao of *non-action*.\nWhen desire to act emerges,\nit must be suppressed by this *nameless simplicity*—\nthis is the mindful regulation of desire.\nOnce desire is suppressed by this *nameless simplicity*,\ndesire itself will cease to desire—\nthis is the *non-desire* of quiet resolve.\n\nWith *non-desire* in stillness,\nthe world will align itself.\n*Stillness* is the return to the beginning of action.\nWhen desire to act is suppressed by the Dao,\ndesire ceases, and action becomes still—\nthus, though there is no intent to rectify the world,\nthe world will rectify itself.\nThis is no different from how all things transform of their own accord.\nSome act from ease, some from benefit—\nyet their outcomes are one.\n\n---\n*This chapter’s first two sections speak of non-action while things transform themselves;\nthe latter two speak of preferring stillness while the world aligns itself.*\n\n*The Daoist Classic, Volume Two, ends here.*\n#1: Original text reads *\"能矜\"*—*\"能\"* is a duplication; deleted per the Yueya edition.\n#2: *\"Winter藏之时\"*—*\"时\"* was omitted; added per the Yueya edition.\n\n*The Daoist Classic, Volume Three*\n*Linchuan Wu Cheng’s Exegesis*\n\n**The Daoist Classic, Volume Three**\n\nThe opening lines of the **Upper Section** read: *\"The highest virtue does not claim virtue,\"* hence the chapter is named after *virtue*. The title carries no inherent meaning—commentators mistakenly claim the Upper Section speaks solely of the *Dao*, while the Lower Section speaks solely of *virtue*, a grave error.\n\nSome texts render this as *The Classic of the Dao and Virtue*, but in truth, the *Dao Classic* and the *Virtue Classic* each take their names from the first character of their respective sections. Later scholars conflated the two titles into *The Dao and Virtue Classic*, though the work is not named after the two characters *Dao* and *virtue* themselves.\n\n*\"The highest virtue does not claim virtue,\"* and thus it has virtue.\n*\"The lower virtue does not lose virtue,\"* and thus it lacks virtue.\nHere, *virtue* is contrasted with *benevolence*.\n\nThe highest virtue is above virtue—it is the *Dao*.\nThe lower virtue is below virtue—it is *benevolence*.\nThe *Dao* acts without action, and does not treat virtue as its affair, hence *\"does not claim virtue.\"*\nThose with virtue possess virtue within the *Dao*.\nWarm and nurturing, they fear losing virtue, hence *\"does not lose virtue.\"*\nThose without virtue cannot truly possess virtue.\n\nThe highest virtue acts without action, yet nothing is left undone.\nThe lower virtue acts, yet it is burdened with effort.\nAgain, *virtue* is contrasted with *benevolence*.\n*\"With\"* means *\"to employ.\"* The *Dao* acts without action and requires no effort, while *benevolence* acts and requires effort.\n\nThe highest *benevolence* acts yet leaves nothing undone.\nThe highest *righteousness* acts yet is burdened with effort.\nHere, *virtue* is contrasted with *benevolence*.\nThe highest *benevolence*—#1—is above *benevolence;* it is *virtue*.\nThe highest *righteousness* is above *righteousness;* it is *benevolence*.\nThough *virtue* acts, it still leaves nothing undone, yet it cannot match the *Dao*’s effortless non-action. Still, it surpasses *benevolence*, which acts with burdened effort.\n\nThe highest *rites* act, yet none respond—\nthey roll up their sleeves and press forward.\nThis speaks solely of *righteousness*.\nThe highest *rites* are above *rites;* they are *righteousness*.\n*\"Roll up\"* means *\"to push aside,\"* akin to *\"to brush back.\"*\n*\"Press forward\"* means *\"to approach.\"*\nWhen *righteousness* fails to move others, though one acts, none respond.\nIf people do not come to me, then I shall go to them—\nthus, they brush back their sleeves upon their arms and march forward to approach them,\nvividly depicting their labored and clumsy state.\n\nThus, one loses the *Dao* and only then has *virtue*;\none loses *virtue* and only then has *benevolence*;\none loses *benevolence* and only then has *righteousness*;\none loses *righteousness* and only then has *rites*.\nThis concludes the preceding text and introduces the following.\n\n*Rites*, though thin in loyalty and trust, are the beginning of disorder.\n*Prescience*, though the bloom of the *Dao*, is the start of folly.\nThis speaks of *rites*, wisdom, loyalty, and trust together.\nAs *virtue* grows thin, it gradually transforms:\nonce into *benevolence*, twice into *righteousness*, thrice into *rites*—\nand loyalty and trust, thick in *virtue*, grow thin.\n*Rites* seek order without chaos, yet they found disorder—\nhence, *\"the beginning of disorder.\"*\n*Prescience* is akin to foresight and wisdom.\nThe *Dao* is like the fruit of a tree.\nBefore its birth, its essence lies within—\nthe embryo not yet revealed.\nAfter its birth, *virtue* is its root,\n*benevolence* its trunk,\n*righteousness* its branches,\n*rites* its leaves,\nand wisdom its bloom.\nRoot, trunk, branches, leaves, and bloom all arise from the *Dao*.\nWisdom seeks enlightenment without folly,\nyet it brings folly into being—\nhence, *\"the start of folly.\"*\n\nThus, the noble one dwells in what is thick, not what is thin,\nin what is real, not what is superficial—\nhence, they discard the latter and take the former.\nThis concludes the preceding text:\n*\"Dwelling in what is thick\"* means valuing *virtue* over *rites*;\n*\"in what is real\"* means embodying the *Dao* without relying on wisdom.\n*\"Thin\"* refers to superficiality; *\"thick\"* to substance.\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Three**\n\nThe opening chapter of the Upper Section divides *Dao* and *virtue*,\nwhile the opening chapter of the Lower Section divides *Dao*, *virtue*, *benevolence*, *righteousness*, *rites*, and wisdom.\nMy *Dao*, *virtue*, *benevolence*, *righteousness*, *rites*, and wisdom\nare what all things under heaven share as their origin—*Dao*—\nand what beings receive from heaven and earth—*virtue*.\n*Virtue* is the general term; specifically, it is fourfold.\nTo receive the primal essence of heaven and earth in nurturing life is *virtue*—\nand warm, tender, and loving, it is called *benevolence*.\nTo receive the benefit of heaven and earth in gathering life is *virtue*—\nand decisive and measured, it is called *righteousness*.\nTo receive the flourishing of heaven and earth in sustaining life is *virtue*—\nand radiant and refined, it is called *rites*.\nTo receive the steadfastness of heaven and earth in preserving life is *virtue*—\nand complete and knowing, it is called *wisdom*.\nThe *Dao* is nameless; *virtue* is named.\nFrom *virtue* arise *benevolence*, *righteousness*, *rites*, and wisdom—\neach descent grows lower.\n\nThus, this chapter ranks the *Dao* as first, above *virtue*—\nhence, *\"the highest virtue.\"*\nIt ranks *virtue* as second, above *benevolence*—\nhence, *\"the highest benevolence.\"*\nIt ranks *benevolence* as third, below *virtue* yet above *righteousness*—\nhence, *\"lower virtue, higher righteousness.\"*\nIt ranks *righteousness* as fourth, above *rites*—\nhence, *\"rites.\"*\nAnd collectively, it says:\n*\"One loses the Dao and only then has virtue;\none loses virtue and only then has benevolence;\none loses benevolence and only then has righteousness;\nand again, one loses righteousness and only then has rites,\"*\nmaking *rites* the fifth.\nIt first speaks of *rites*, then of *prescience*—\nmaking wisdom the sixth.\n\nIf compared to the six positions of the *Yijing* hexagrams,\nthen *Dao* is the first, *virtue* the second, *benevolence* the third,\n*righteousness* the fourth, *rites* the fifth, and *wisdom* the sixth.\nThe *Dao* is the substance, wisdom its bloom—\nsubstance is real, bloom is superficial.\nThe first and sixth form the beginning and end.\n*Virtue* is the root, *rites* the leaves—\nroots are thick, leaves are thin.\nThe second and fifth are the world’s response.\n*Benevolence* is the trunk, *righteousness* the branches—\ntrunks are single, branches split.\nThe third and fourth are neighboring positions.\n\nThe *Dao* is like Heaven—\nencompassing and covering all things in their origin.\n*Virtue* is like Earth—\nloyalty and trust as its soil, the foundation for the four virtues.\n*Benevolence* is like Spring—\n*virtue* (Earth) nurtures wood.\n*Righteousness* is like Autumn—\n*benevolence* (wood) nurtures metal.\n*Rites* are like Summer—\n*righteousness* (metal) nurtures fire.\n*Wisdom* is like Winter—\n*rites* (fire) nurtures water.\nEach transmits what it conquers.\n\nThe *Dao* is first, *virtue* second, *benevolence* third, *righteousness* fourth, *rites* fifth, *wisdom* sixth.\nThe highest *virtue* is without *virtue*,\nThe highest *benevolence*—\nThe lowest *virtue* does not lose its way,\nThe highest *righteousness*—\nThe highest *rites*—\nThus, having *virtue* is to have none,\nNone is to act without action,\nAction is to have *virtue*,\n*Virtue* is to act,\n*Virtue* is to act,\nYet thin is the loyalty and trust—\nThis is the bloom of the *Dao*.\nTo have it is to have it,\nTo not have it is to have it,\nTo have it is to have it—\nNo response, the origin of chaos,\nThe beginning of folly.\n\nThose of old who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear,\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil,\nThe Spirit attained the One and became numinous,\nThe Valley attained the One and became full,\nAll things attained the One and came to life,\nThe sovereign attained the One and became the standard for the world.\nThis is how the One was achieved.\n\nThe One is the *virtue* of emptiness and void,\nAs the previous chapter said, \"embracing the One,\"\nAs \"making it One,\" as the later chapter says, \"the *Dao* gives birth to the One\"—\nAll speak of this.\nZhuangzi called it the Great One,\nAnd simply called it the One.\nThis is the natural *Dao* in action—\nIts use is empty yet not filled,\nRetiring yet not leading,\nSoft yet not rigid,\nWeak yet not strong.\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of this repeatedly,\nBut this chapter fully unfolds its depths.\nTo attain it means to take this One as *virtue*,\nAnd thus be as such.\n\nHeaven, Earth, Spirit, and Valley—\nNames differ, reality is the same.\nWhat moves and becomes clear is called Heaven,\nWhat condenses and becomes tranquil is called Earth.\nThe Spirit is the subtle interplay of the two *qi* between things,\nAs Zhang Zai said, \"Two in one, hence unfathomable\"—\nIts use responds without measure, hence numinous.\nThe Valley is the empty space between things,\nAs Zhang Zai said, \"Empty and void is *qi*\"—\nIts *qi* fills without gap, hence full.\n\n*Acquiring* (贞) is like the trunk of a tree—\nTo be the standard for the world is to be the people’s ultimate.\nSaying Heaven is clear, Earth tranquil, Spirit numinous, Valley full,\nAll things perpetually alive—\nThe sovereign stands above the world as the people’s ultimate,\nAnd this is how the One is achieved.\n\nIf Heaven lacks clarity, it would crack,\nIf Earth lacks tranquility, it would tremble,\nIf the Spirit lacks numinosity, it would falter,\nIf the Valley lacks fullness, it would dry up,\nIf all things lack life, they would perish,\nIf the sovereign lacks the standard, his noble height would falter.\n\nTo lack it means to lack this *virtue* yet use it.\nCrack—splitting apart.\nTremble—shaking.\nFalter—unable to respond and thus be numinous.\nDry up—unable to fill and thus be full.\nPerish—extinguished and not alive.\nFalter—toppling and losing its place.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the base as its root,\nThe high relies on the low as its foundation.\nHence the sovereign calls himself \"lonely, bereft, unworthy\"—\nIs this not taking the base as root?\n\nNo?\nThis chapter speaks of the six together,\nBut here, following the words \"noble\" and \"high\" above,\nIt speaks specifically of the sovereign.\nFor the sovereign’s position is noble and high,\nYet the *virtue* of emptiness and void does not seek fullness—\nOnly to place oneself in the lowly.\n\n\"Lonely\" as without father,\n\"Bereft\" as without husband,\n\"Unworthy\" as unvirtuous—\nAll are unflattering names,\nNot what anyone would wish to possess,\nYet the sovereign calls himself thus—\nThis is placing oneself in the lowly.\n\nEarlier it said, \"The base is the root, the low the foundation,\"\nThen only said, \"The base is the root\"—\nOmitting the second to encompass both—\nA condensed style.\n\nThus, the highest praise is without praise,\nNot wanting to gleam like jade,\nOr clatter like stone.\n\n*Jingjing*—the appearance of jade,\n*Luo Luo*—the appearance of stone.\nWhen a person’s reputation is loudly proclaimed,\nIt is but shallow praise—\nIt must efface all reputation.\nWhen no one can be praised,\nThat is the height of praise—\nAlso the intent of placing oneself in the lowly,\nNot wanting to distinguish good and evil\nSo that people see the *jingjing* purity as jade,\nThe *luo luo* coarseness as stone.\n\nBoth passages speak of the *virtue* of emptiness and void—\nThus is the sovereign’s attainment of the One.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nThe contrary is the *Dao*’s motion,\nThe weak is the *Dao*’s use.\nThe *Dao*’s stillness is non-being,\nIts motion must necessarily oppose being—\nThe contrary is non-being yet not non-being.\nThe *Dao*’s essence is emptiness,\nIts use must necessarily be weak—\nThe weak is empty yet not filled.\nThese two sentences are the chapter’s key.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born of being,\nBeing is born of non-being.\nFrom here to the attainment of the utmost goodness—\nAll elaborate on \"the contrary is the *Dao*’s motion.\"\n\nAll things arise from *qi* gathering into form,\nForm from *qi*, *qi* from the *Dao*—\n*Qi* and form are being, yet the *Dao* is non-being.\nNon-being and being differ—\nHence \"contrary,\" speaking of how the *Dao* moves by contradiction.\n\nThe superior person, hearing the *Dao*, strives to practice it;\nThe middle person, hearing the *Dao*, holds it as if it might vanish;\n\nThe inferior person, hearing the *Dao*, laughs at it greatly—\nWithout laughter, it would not be the *Dao*.\nThis speaks of how people’s understanding\nFollows the *Dao*’s motion through contradiction.\n\nThe *Dao* opposes things,\nThus only the superior person, with true insight,\nStrives to practice it.\nThe middle person’s insight is insufficient—\nThey hold it as if it might vanish.\nThe inferior person, lacking insight,\nLaughs at it because it does not conform to worldly expectations.\n\nFew possess this insight—\nHence the *Dao*’s true value.\nIf all could grasp it,\nIt would no longer be the *Dao*.\n\nThus it is said:\nThese words introduce the next two sections,\nSpeaking of those who established the *Dao*’s teachings.\n\nThe *Dao*’s contradictions are as follows:\nThe twelve matters below.\nThe *Dao*’s clarity is like obscurity,\nAdvancing like retreat,\nLeveling like unevenness—\nThese speak of motion through contradiction.\n\nPreserving brightness by dimming,\nRetreating to advance,\nUnevenness as balance—\nThis is how the *Dao* moves.\n\nThe virtue of the sage is like a valley,\nGreat brightness like shame,\nAmple gain like insufficiency,\nEstablishing virtue like laziness,\nAuthenticity like falseness,\nThe greatest square has no corners,\nThe greatest vessel takes long to form,\nThe greatest sound is inaudible,\nThe greatest form is shapeless.\n\nExpanding upon the above contradictions:\nA valley’s depth makes it high,\nBlemished color is true whiteness,\nNarrowness becomes vastness,\nLaziness becomes establishment.\nAuthenticity is true reality—\nYet true reality seems false.\nA square must have corners—\nThe greatest square has none.\nOnly after completion is it a vessel—\nThe greatest vessel forms late.\nSounds blend to make music—\nThe greatest sound is sparse.\nOnly what is visible is form—\nThe greatest form is invisible.\n\nThe *Dao* is hidden, nameless.\nOnly the *Dao* brings ultimate fulfillment.\nThis concludes the meaning of the previous two sections.\n\nThe *Dao* hidden in the nameless\nCan fully bestow upon all things without depletion.\nAll the above speak of motion through contradiction.\n\nThe *Dao* gives birth to One,\nOne to Two,\nTwo to Three,\nThree to all things.\nAll things carry yin while embracing yang,\nTheir *qi* harmonized in balance.\n\nFrom here to what the world rarely attains,\nIt elaborates on how weakness is the *Dao*’s use.\n\nThe *Dao* arises from the void,\nGenerating the pure *qi* of Oneness.\nThis pure *qi* generates yang and yin,\nDividing into Two,\nThen yin and yang merge with the pure *qi* as Three—\nThus it is said to generate Three,\nNot an additional Three beyond One and Two.\n\nAll things arise from these Three,\nThus in their birth, they carry yin behind and embrace yang before,\nWith harmonizing *qi* in between.\nHarmony means yin and yang are balanced, neither dominant.\n\nAll things rely on this harmonizing *qi* for life,\nAnd afterward, to preserve their essence,\nThey must use this same harmonizing *qi*—\nThus they do not lose their origin.\nSince the *qi* of birth is empty yet full,\nIt is called weakness.\nThis explains how the *Dao* moves through weakness.\n\nWhat people despise—\nOrphanhood, widowhood, poverty—\nThe king and duke hold as titles.\nThis speaks of those who understand\nUsing weakness as strength.\n\n\"Orphan, widow, poor\"—\nNone are names of strength,\nYet these are what people despise,\nWhile kings and dukes take them as titles—\nThus weakness is used.\n\nTherefore, sometimes loss brings gain,\nAnd gain brings loss.\nThis introduces the next two sections.\n\nWhat people teach, I also teach:\nThe overbearing meet no good end.\nI will make this my fundamental lesson.\n\nThis speaks of using weakness.\n*\"Overbearing\"* also means \"strong\"—\nBeams that span water, pillars that bear roofs,\nBoth called *liang*, for their strength.\n\"Not meeting a good end\" means dying untimely,\nAs when Zilu rushed ahead—\nThe Master said he would not meet a good end,\nAnd later he died in the chaos of Kong Yue’s rebellion.\n\n*\"Teaching father\"* means fundamental teaching,\nWhere none stands above.\nWhat people teach, I teach them to use weakness.\nThe overbearing, unable to yield,\nCannot preserve themselves.\nTheir strength brings gain but also untimely loss—\nThis is what is meant by \"gain that is loss,\"\nThe most essential lesson for teaching others.\n\nThe world’s ultimate softness\nOvercomes the world’s ultimate hardness.\nNo space enters no space—\nThus I know the benefits of *wuwei*.\n\nAgain expanding on the teaching of weakness:\nUltimate softness and emptiness are both weakness.\n*\"Overcomes\"* means to trample pebbles.\n*\"No space\"* means no gaps for entry.\nWater, the softest, erodes the hardest stone,\n*Qi* without substance penetrates walls without seams—\nThrough the softest, emptiest loss,\nComes the gain of overcoming hardness and entering the unenterable.\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nEmptiness enters fullness—\nAll without effort, naturally.\nThus the benefits of *wuwei*.\n\nUnspoken teaching,\nThe benefits of *wuwei*—\nFew in the world attain them.\nThis concludes the meaning of the previous two sections.\n\n*\"Unspoken teaching\"* means\nThat which should be weak, not strong,\nIs the fundamental lesson needing no words.\n\nThe benefits of *wuwei* lie in the boundless drive of ultimate softness and emptiness—\nIts teaching to benefit others surpasses all human instruction.\n\nThose who rely on spoken teaching and deliberate action\nCannot approach this, hence the saying: *\"Few attain it.\"*\n\nAll that has been spoken of is the application of weakness.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Five**\nThough the previous chapter spoke exclusively of *yongruo* (using weakness),\nThis chapter opposes it with *fan* (contrary), why?\nIt is but one meaning in two words:\n*Fan* traces the origin of weakness,\nWhile *ruo* points to its actual practice.\nTo speak of *fan* is to seek *ruo*,\nTo speak of *ruo* is to oppose all worldly actions—\nThere is no *fan* beyond *ruo*.\n\nWhich is dearer, name or body?\nWhich is more abundant, body or wealth?\nWhich brings greater harm, gain or loss?\n\n*\"Dear\"* means what is loved—\nWhich is more lovable, name or body?\n*\"Abundant\"* means what is valued—\nWhich is more valuable, body or wealth?\n\nName is placed above body,\nWealth below—\nA rhetorical device for rhyme alone.\n\nThe *Shiji* says:\nTo gain name and wealth while losing the body\nIs worse than losing name and wealth while keeping the body—\nWhich is more harmful?\n\nThus, excessive love brings great waste,\nHoarding brings great loss.\n\n*\"Love\"* refers to love of name.\n*\"Great\"* refers to the body.\nComparing name to body, the body surpasses name—\nYet those who covet name love it excessively,\nWhile love for the body falls short,\nDraining spirit and shortening life—\nThis is how love of name consumes the body’s greatness.\n*\"Hoarding\"* refers to wealth.\n*\"Thick\"* refers to the body.\nComparing wealth to body, the body surpasses wealth—\nYet those who crave wealth hoard excessively,\nWhile valuing the body falls short,\nLeading to the loss of life and ruin—\nThis is how wealth consumes the body’s abundance.\n\nKnowing contentment brings no disgrace,\nKnowing restraint brings no peril—\nThus one may endure.\n\nKnowing the inner limits, one is content and not arrogant,\nHence no shame from lost reputation or misconduct.\nKnowing external things bring no benefit, one stops and does not seek,\nHence no peril from shortened life or ruin—\nThus one may endure.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Six**\n\nGreat fullness seems deficient,\nYet its use is inexhaustible.\nGreat excess seems empty,\nYet its use is boundless.\nGreat straightness seems bent,\nGreat skill seems clumsy,\nGreat eloquence seems tongue-tied.\n\nTo be full is to be full,\nTo be excess is to be excess,\nTo be straight is to be straight,\nTo be skillful is to be skillful,\nTo be eloquent is to be eloquent—\nThis is smallness.\n\nBut to be deficient is not to be full,\nTo be empty is not to be excess,\nTo be bent is not to be straight,\nTo be clumsy is not to be skillful,\nTo be tongue-tied is not to be eloquent—\nThis is the greatness of fullness, excess, straightness, skill, and eloquence.\n\nThe entire *Laozi* follows this principle:\nFundamentally, opposites rely upon each other—\nAs seen repeatedly in the previous chapter, needing no further explanation.\n\nAgitation overcomes cold,\nStillness overcomes heat.\nYang’s agitation overcomes yin’s cold,\nYin’s stillness overcomes yang’s heat—\nAgain, opposites rely upon each other.\n\nClarity and stillness are the right way for all under heaven.\n*\"Clarity and stillness\"* is *wuwei*—\nThe mind, free of dust, motionless.\n*\"Right\"* means to rule as sovereign over all under heaven.\n\nTo rule all under heaven is already much—\nYet those who exhaust themselves with action,\nHow could they succeed?\nOnly clarity, stillness, and *wuwei*\nDo nothing yet accomplish all—\nThus they can rule as the right way for all under heaven,\nThis is the meaning of opposites relying upon each other.\n\nSome say stillness overcoming heat and agitation overcoming cold\nAre paired opposites, each leaning toward one extreme—\nBut the stillness of clarity and stillness has no opposite,\nFor stillness contains motion, and motion and stillness align without bias,\nThus it can rule as the right way for all under heaven.\n\nThough the argument is profound,\nIt is not the original intent.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Seven**\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Eight**\nWhen the Dao prevails under heaven, swift steeds are harnessed to dung carts.\nWhen the Dao does not prevail, warhorses breed in the borderlands.\n*\"However\"* (退, *què*), means to withdraw.\n*\"Swift steeds\"* (走马), are steeds of swiftness.\n*\"Dung carts\"* (粪车), are carts laden with dung.\nIn ancient times, every sixty-four *ling* made up a *dian*, each contributing warhorses as tribute. In an age of the Dao, all kept to their allotted lands without encroachment or war, so that common steeds were not yoked to war chariots, but rather withdrawn to serve the humble task of dunging the fields.\n*\"Warhorses\"* (戎马), are steeds trained in unison for battle.\n*\"Borderlands\"* (郊), are the contested frontiers between two states.\nIn an age without the Dao, raiders are called *\"invaders\"* (寇), and skirmishes erupt beyond the borders, so that warhorses cannot return to be bred within the state’s protection, but instead are born and raised in the wilderness.\n\nThe phrase *\"dung carts\"* in lower commentaries omits the character *\"car\"*, though *Zhuzi’s Collected Sayings* includes it—yet none know its source.\nNow examining: Zhang Heng’s *Eastern Capital Eulogy* states:\n*\"Swift steeds are withdrawn to dung carts.\"*\nThis employs Laozi’s full line, proving that in late Han, the character *\"car\"* was not yet omitted. Wang Bi’s annotation, being close to Zhang’s time, still retained it—yet later it was accidentally dropped, and subsequent errors led to its omission.\n*\"Border\"* (郊) rhymes with *\"lack\"* (阙), and omitting *\"car\"* breaks the rhyme.\n\nNo greater crime than desiring what is desirable,\nNo greater fault than striving to obtain it,\nNo greater calamity than failing to know contentment.\nThus, the *\"contentment\"* (足) of knowing contentment is ever content.\n\nCrimes, transgressions, evils, faults, and calamities are all disasters—\nYet calamity surpasses fault.\nThe spark of war arises from coveting land as desirable.\nKnowing it desirable, one schemes to seize it—this is the beginning of disaster.\nObtaining it yet failing to know satiety,\nEver craving more after gaining one ridge, then another—\nThen war knows no end, the ultimate disaster.\n\nIf each were to abide by their allotted lands,\nNot seeking to expand or encroach,\nAnd cultivate the heart’s contentment in self-sufficiency,\nThen there would be no greed, no war, and everlasting contentment.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nNot stepping beyond the door, one knows all under heaven;\nNot peering through the window, one beholds the Dao of Heaven.\nAll things and affairs under heaven are complete within me,\nThus though one does not step beyond the door, one knows them all.\n\nThe *\"Dao of Heaven\"* is the singular source of all principles.\nIt is grasped through inward observation—\nNot like external things, which must be seen through the window before recognition.\n\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nNot knowing that all is contained within oneself,\nOne must travel to a place before knowing a matter—\nThus the farther one goes, the less one knows.\nHow could one not step beyond the door and yet know all under heaven?\n\n*\"Not covering\"* (不覆) *\"to see the Dao\"*—\nNone fail to know the myriad branches while ignorant of the single root.\nThus, no need to repeat.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without moving yet arrives,\nSees without gazing yet names,\nAccomplishes without doing.\nNot waiting to move outward to reach a place,\nThus knowing all under heaven’s affairs.\nNot waiting to observe a thing before naming its principle,\nThus not peering through the window yet seeing the Dao of Heaven.\n*\"Accomplishing without doing\"*—\nThe effect of the two preceding lines:\nOnly by not moving yet knowing all things,\nNot peering yet penetrating the source,\nDoes one, without any action, see all completed.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty**\nStudying brings daily increase;\nPracticing the Dao brings daily decrease.\nThe scholar’s woe is scarcity, thus they strive for breadth—\nThus daily gains are made.\nThe Daoist returns from having to non-being—\nThus daily losses are sustained.\nDecrease again, decrease again,\nUntil reaching *wuwei*.\nWhen *wuwei* is attained, nothing remains undone.\n\nThe Daoist diminishes their deeds,\nDecrease again, decrease again—\nWhen all that can be diminished is exhausted,\nThen *wuwei* is achieved.\nThe doer of deeds does but one thing at a time,\nTen things at most—\nYet the things not yet done number in the thousands and ten-thousands,\nBeyond reckoning—\nHow could they all be done?\nOnly the *wuwei* does nothing,\nThus all things are accomplished without fail.\n\nThose who would take all under heaven\nMust first do nothing.\nOnce action begins,\nIt is insufficient to take all under heaven.\n*\"Doing nothing\"* means doing nothing at all—*wuwei*.\nYet it is said that those who take all under heaven\nMust first be without action,\nFor virtue overflows and draws all to itself.\nIf one relies on cunning and force,\nHow could they take all under heaven?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nThe Sage has no fixed heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as their own.\n*Political Harmony* annotates:\nThe Sage’s heart is empty yet receptive,\nStill yet responsive—\nLike a mirror reflecting forms,\nTaking their beauty or ugliness,\nLike a valley echoing sounds,\nResponding to their loud or soft.\nWhat constancy could there be?\n\nDong Sijing says:\nThe Sage has no self,\nTheir heart not clinging to things,\nYet all things come and are met with ease.\n\nWang [Bi] says:\nAll thought is for responding to things.\nThe *Book of Documents* states:\n*\"From myself, the people are enlightened.\"*\nThe good, I treat as good;\nThe ungood, I also treat as good—thus goodness is attained.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—thus trust is attained.\nThe people’s goodness or ungoodness, trust or distrust—\nThe Sage does not distinguish right or wrong,\nBut treats all as good, all as trustworthy—\nNot only do the good attain goodness,\nThe trustworthy attain trust,\nBut the ungood also attain goodness,\nThe untrustworthy attain trust.\nThis is called the people attaining goodness and trust without loss—\nEven the ungood and untrustworthy are transformed into goodness and trust,\nThus all attain goodness and trust.\n\nThe Sage’s presence under heaven is *\"shrunken\"* (歙歙),\nMuddling the hearts of all.\nThe people fix their ears and eyes upon them,\nThe Sage treats them all as children.\n*\"Shrunken\"* (歙歙) conveys contraction.\nWang [Bi] says: *\"The heart has no fixed attachment.\"*\n*\"Muddling\"* (浑) means the mind has no direction.\nSome manuscripts render *\"shrunken\"* as *\"fearful\"* (惵惵) or *\"dreadful\"* (怵怵),\nBoth conveying terror—\nYet Wang Bi writes *\"shrunken\"* (歙), interpreting it as *\"the heart has no fixed attachment,\"*\nAligned with the context above and below.\n\nBo Dong Si Jing remarked: *\"Muddling\"* (浑) and *\"mingling\"* (混) mean to dissolve differences and merge the same. *\"Treat them all as children\"* (皆孩之) means to refrain from discrimination.\n\nMaster Su said: Beneath heaven, the good and evil, the trustworthy and deceitful each uphold their own positions and condemn one another. Yet the Sage regards them all equally. When the people fix their ears and eyes upon the Sage, observing His bestowals and withdrawals, He meets them all with the simplicity of an infant—neither favoring nor resenting. Thus, the good and trustworthy do not grow arrogant, while the evil and deceitful do not grow indignant. All are released and transformed, and thus the world settles in harmony.\n\n---\n*\"Shrunken\"* (歙) is pronounced *xī*.\n*\"Fearful\"* (惵) is pronounced *dá-yè*.\n\n---\n**Chapter 41: Birth and Death**\n\nBirth is life; death is return.\nTo emerge is to arise from non-being into being;\nTo return is to depart from being into non-being.\n\nZhuangzi said: *\"All things emerge from the Dao/Way, and all return to the Dao/Way.\"*\nHe also said: *\"Their emergence brings no joy, their return no regret.\"*\nAnd again: *\"Some emerge, some return.\"*\nAll take emergence as life and return as death.\n\nThere are thirteen types of those who live,\nAnd thirteen types of those who die.\nTen refers to the total count of high, middle, and low ranks,\nGenerally divided into ten categories.\nThree refers to three categories among those ten.\n\nThose who do not shorten their lifespan through anxiety, indulgence, or desire,\nNor fall ill from wind, cold, heat, or dampness,\nNor suffer from the calamities of punishment, war, drowning, or crushing—\nThese are the thirteen types who live.\n\nTheir opposites:\nThe idle and noble perish from internal harm,\nThe laboring and lowly from external harm,\nThe coarse and fierce fail to complete their natural span—\nThese are the thirteen types who die.\nEach of these three types exists within the ten categories.\n\nAmong the ten categories, there are also thirteen types who move toward death while living.\nWhy so?\nBecause their pursuit of life is excessive.\n*\"The\"* (之) means to direct or hasten.\n*\"Dynamic\"* (动) means action.\n*\"Pursuit of life\"* (生生) means striving to preserve life.\n*\"Excessive\"* (厚) means their intentions are too heavy.\n\nSome prolong life through alchemy but misapply methods,\nOthers overuse medicine to preserve health,\nWhile some, through excessive caution in dwelling and nourishment, become fragile and brittle.\nAmong the ten categories, three types act thus—\nTheir intent is to hasten life, yet their actions instead drive them toward death,\nFor their obsession with life is unnatural.\n\nIt is said that those skilled in nurturing life\nFear neither rhinoceros nor tiger when walking on land,\nNor weapons nor soldiers when entering battle.\nThe rhinoceros finds no place to strike with its horn,\nThe tiger no place to claw with its paw,\nThe blade no place to lodge its edge.\nWhy?\nBecause they have no place of death.\n\nAmong the ten categories, three types belong to those who live,\nThree to those who die,\nAnd three to those who, though living, move toward death—\nTogether, they make nine.\n\nBeyond the nine is the One—\nThe Supreme True Person.\n\n*\"Nurturing\"* (摄) is like governing or officiating—\nNot claiming life as one’s own,\nBut guiding it as if temporarily overseeing,\nWith inner stillness as foundation,\nOuter gentleness as form,\nSolid as wood or stone in ignorance,\nEmpty as an infant in desirelessness.\nEven when facing fierce beasts or cruel men,\nThey do not flee, yet the beasts and men grow tame and do no harm.\nTheir dross is dissolved, their vital essence refined,\nTheir spirit and qi serene as wind or shadow—\nUntouchable, ungraspable.\nWith no substance to die from,\nEven if harmed, how could harm take hold?\n\n---\n**Chapter 42: The Dao/Way and Virtue/Power**\n\nThe Dao/Way gives birth to things,\nVirtue/power nurtures them,\nForm shapes them,\nAnd circumstances complete them.\nThus, all things reverence the Dao/Way and honor virtue/power.\n\n*\"Gives birth\"* refers to the sprouting of life in spring,\nThe origin from which all things begin.\n*\"Nurtures\"* refers to their rest and gathering in autumn,\nPreserving the harmony of the great unity.\n*\"Shapes\"* refers to the growth of spring-born things in summer,\nEnlarging their forms,\nSo that all things flourish in their kinds.\n*\"Completes\"* refers to their storage in winter,\nPerfecting their fruits,\nAnd fulfilling their true nature and destiny.\n\nAll things—birth, growth, harvest, and storage—\nAll arise from the Dao/Way and virtue/power.\nThus, all things honor the Dao/Way as a father,\nAnd virtue/power as a mother.\n\nThe Dao/Way and virtue/power are two yet one:\nSpring’s birth arises from a single source and disperses,\nHence it is said, *\"The Dao/Way gives birth\"*—\nYet the Dao/Way is also virtue/power.\nAutumn’s harvest gathers from myriad differences into unity,\nHence it is said, *\"Virtue/power nurtures\"*—\nYet virtue/power is also the Dao/Way.\n\nThe Dao/Way’s reverence, virtue/power’s honor—\nNo command enforces them; they are ever naturally so.\n\nHuman honor and nobility require designation:\nThe Son of Heaven’s honor comes from the Mandate of Heaven,\nThe nobles’ nobility from the Son of Heaven’s command.\nBut the Dao/Way’s honor and virtue/power’s nobility\nNeed no such designation—\nAll things eternally honor and revere them thus.\n\nThus the Dao/Way gives birth, nurtures, grows, and matures them,\nCompletes and ripens them,\nNourishes and shelters them.\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of *\"The Dao/Way gives birth, virtue/power nurtures\"*—\nHere, only *\"the Dao/Way\"* is mentioned, for virtue/power is the Dao/Way.\n*\"Grows\"* and *\"matures\"* elaborate on *\"form shapes\"* and *\"circumstances complete.\"*\n*\"Nourishes\"* elaborates on *\"grows,\"*\n*\"Shelters\"* on *\"matures\"*—\n*\"Shelters\"* means returning to the origin and fulfilling destiny.\n\nTo give birth without possession,\nTo act without reliance,\nTo grow without domination—\nThis is called the *Mysterious Virtue/Power*.\n\n*\"Give birth\"* means to birth and form.\n*\"Act\"* means to nurture and complete.\n*\"Without possession\"* means no intent to birth.\n*\"Without reliance\"* means no deeds to act with.\nLike a ruler who thinks and acts without scheming,\nThough he governs, he harbors no designs or manipulations.\n\nThis encompasses birth, growth, harvest, and storage—\nAll called *Mysterious Virtue/Power*, yet the Dao/Way is not named,\nFor the Dao/Way is also virtue/power.\n\n---\n**Chapter 43: The Origin of Heaven and Earth**\n\nHeaven and earth have a beginning,\nWhich serves as the mother of all things beneath heaven.\n*\"Beginning\"* is the Dao/Way.\n*\"Mother\"* is virtue/power.\nThis origin of heaven and earth\nIs the mother of all ten thousand things.\n\nHaving obtained its mother,\nOne comes to know its child.\nHaving known its child,\nOne must again guard its mother—\nThen the body labors without exhaustion.\n\nWhen a person is born,\nThey obtain their mother,\nAnd through this know the child within the mother.\nHaving known the child within the mother,\nIf one then guards the mother,\nThe mother abides, and the child does not depart.\n\nDong Sizheng says:\n*\"Humans receive qi to live—\nQi is the mother, the spirit dwelling within qi is the child.\nGuarding the mother makes qi focused and the spirit at ease.\"*\n\nBlock the *duì* (mouth),\nClose the *mén* (nostrils),\nAnd one will never tire in their lifetime.\nOpen the *duì*,\nAnd one’s affairs will prosper—\nYet one will never be saved in their lifetime.\nThis is the method of guarding the mother.\n\nFrom the *Shuowen Jiezi*:\n*\"Duì\"* is composed of *\"bā\"* (eight) and the phonetic *\"shì\"* (though *\"shì\"* is incorrect—it should be *\"rén\"* (person) and *\"kǒu\"* (mouth), with *\"bā\"* symbolizing the breath issuing from above the mouth).\nThus, *\"duì\"* in the *Yijing* takes the mouth as its symbol.\nTo *\"block the duì\"* means to seal the mouth and not speak,\nSo that qi does not escape through the mouth.\nThe *\"mén\"* (nostrils) are the gate through which qi enters and exits.\nOne must first block the *duì* before closing the *mén*—\nBy not speaking and gradually regulating and reducing the breath until it ceases,\nThus the qi becomes concentrated within,\nAnd one will never be exhausted by labor in their lifetime.\n\nAll people must speak to conduct affairs,\nAnd daily opening the mouth to speak\nExhausts the qi until it is depleted—\nIn their lifetime, this cannot be remedied.\n\nSeeing smallness as clarity,\nGuarding softness as strength.\nSmallness refers to the *\"wēi\"* (subtle) of the previous chapter—\nWhat is seen is vague and indistinct,\nYet if one does not desire its clarity,\nThey will not overuse the spirit to harm the clarity,\nBut rather advance toward clarity each day.\nWhat is held firm is fragile and weak,\nYet if one does not desire its strength,\nThey will not forcefully expend qi to harm strength,\nBut rather advance toward strength each day.\n\nSeeing smallness is nurturing the child.\nGuarding softness is guarding the mother.\n*\"Day\"* may be a scribal error for *\"or\"* (as in *\"either\"*).\n\nUsing its light,\nReturning to its clarity—\nNo harm comes to the body.\nThis is called *\"clinging to constancy.\"*\n\nThis speaks of the method of nurturing the child:\nA mirror’s ability to reflect is its light,\nThe essence of that light is its clarity.\nUsing the light that shines outward,\nReturning it inward to illuminate within—\nRestoring and returning it to its hidden essence.\nThe spirit, if overused, will be exhausted;\nSeeing the depths of the fish is an omen of misfortune—\nThis is using light externally to bring harm to the body.\nIf one contains the light and blends with the world,\nThere will be no harm.\nThis is called *\"clinging to constancy\"*—\nThe ability to conceal the ordinary use of light\nAnd return to the ordinary essence of clarity.\n\n---\n**Chapter 44**\nThe previous chapter spoke of *Dao* and *virtue/power* in all things.\nThis chapter speaks of *Dao* and *virtue/power* within a single human body.\n\nIf I—suddenly aware—\nWere to walk the Great Dao,\nI would fear only *excessive display*.\n\n*\"I\"* refers generally to all people, not Laozi himself.\n*\"Suddenly aware\"* (*jièrán*)—same usage as in *Mencius*, meaning a fleeting moment.\nThe word *\"know\"* is abruptly cut off.\n*\"Excessive display\"* (*shī*)—akin to *\"wúshīláo\"* in the *Analects* and *\"shīshī\"* in *Mencius*, meaning boastful arrogance.\nThe Confucian disciple Yan Hui was *\"as if without\"* and *\"as if empty\"*—\nFree from boastful arrogance.\nLaozi’s teachings were likely of this nature,\nFor he most abhorred such display.\n\nThis chapter speaks of those who do not know the Dao,\nWho only seek boastful arrogance.\nIf such a person, in a fleeting moment, were to gain some knowledge\nAnd wish to walk the Great Dao,\nThey would fear only *excessive display* and dare not act.\n\n---\n**Chapter 45**\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nYet people prefer narrow paths.\n\n*Narrow paths* are small roads,\nOpposite to the Great Dao.\nThe humble and retiring are the Great Dao—\nIts way is level and easy to walk.\nThe boastful and arrogant are narrow paths—\nYet people love to tread them.\n\nThe court is excessively adorned,\nThe fields lie fallow,\nThe granaries are empty,\nYet they wear ornate robes and gird fine swords,\nRejecting food and drink,\nHoarding wealth in excess—\nThis is called *robber’s display*,\nNot the Dao.\n\nWithin the hall, there is no wine or sweeping—\nThis is the frugality of the *Tang* and *Yin* winds.\nIf the court is excessively adorned, then the palaces must be extravagant.\nFallow fields and empty granaries mean seizing the people’s time so they cannot till or rest,\nExhausting their strength yet leaving them with no stores.\nWearing fine silks and jade as adornment,\nFeasting on rich foods and meats as nourishment,\nFilling private treasuries as wealth—\nThis is like a thief who, having stolen much,\nDisplays it arrogantly abroad.\nThe tyrants Jia of Xia, Jie of Yin, and Zhou of Shang were such—\nHow could one who knows the Dao do this?\n\n---\nA well-built foundation cannot be uprooted,\nA well-embraced object cannot slip away.\nTheir descendants will never cease in sacrifice.\n\nPlant a single tree upon the level earth,\nThere will surely come a time when it is uprooted and toppled.\nHold an object within both hands,\nThere will surely come a day when it slips and departs.\n\nThe skilled in building regard what is not built as building—\nThen it will never be uprooted.\nThe skilled in embracing regard what is not embraced as embracing—\nThen it will never slip away.\n\nSo too for those skilled in preserving the state and extending its lineage:\nWithout intent to retain the Mandate of Heaven, the Mandate of Heaven remains of itself.\nThus, their descendants offer sacrifices without ceasing,\nAs do those skilled in building and embracing.\n\nWhen cultivated in the self, its virtue becomes true.\nSpeaking to the preceding text,\nOnly by cultivating virtue in the self can one ensure descendants’ unceasing sacrifices.\n\nCultivating virtue in the self is the fulfillment of our true Dao.\nAll beyond the self are transient things—\nWho would act for the sake of acting?\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated in the self,\nThe effects of cause and response unfold naturally, beyond expectation,\nAnd the state is preserved, its lineage extended—\nYet this is not by my own desire.\n\nCultivated in the family, its virtue becomes abundant;\nCultivated in the village, its virtue becomes enduring;\nCultivated in the realm, its virtue becomes plentiful;\nCultivated in the world, its virtue becomes universal.\n\nThe true Dao governs the self,\nIts overflow governs others.\n\nThe family is beyond the self, within the nine clans.\nThe village is beyond the family, within the village boundaries.\nThe realm is beyond the village, within the realm’s borders.\nThe world is beyond the realm, within the four seas.\n\nCultivating in family, village, realm, and world—\nFrom near to far, each person cultivates their own virtue.\n\nYet is this taught to all?\nI act without action, and the people transform of themselves;\nI desire nothing, and the people return to simplicity.\n\nAbundant virtue extends beyond the self’s overflow.\nEnduring virtue extends beyond the family’s length.\nPlentiful virtue extends beyond the village’s breadth.\nUniversal virtue encompasses the realm’s full reach.\n\nThe realm—ancient texts read *guó*—\nAccording to the *Shijing*, \"sequence used in the realm\" places *guó* below.\nMaster Kong Yingda’s commentary cites *Laozi*: \"Cultivate in the realm, virtue becomes plentiful.\"\nThis was changed to *guó* in Han to avoid the taboo of Emperor Gaozu’s name.\nDuring the early Tang, when book compilation was most active,\nsome pre-taboo versions remained.\nThus, observe the self through the self,\nthe family through the family,\nthe village through the village,\nthe realm through the realm,\nthe world through the world.\n\nWhen virtue is cultivated in the self and extends to the world,\nNone are left uncultivated—\nYet this follows their natural course; I have no part in it.\n\nThings return to their own nature,\nUnbound, unattached.\nEach finds their place, rests in their station,\nAll attaining their natural measure—\nThis is the Dao’s effortless governance,\nMind and trace both forgotten,\nUnencumbered transcendence,\nLike the skilled builder who builds nothing,\nThe skilled embrace who embraces nothing.\n\nMaster Shao said:\nObserve the Dao through the Dao,\nNature through nature,\nMind through mind,\nSelf through self,\nThings through things—\nEven if one sought to harm, could it be done?\n\nMaster Shao’s words are indeed the *Laozi*’s intent.\n\nHow do I know the world is thus?\nBy this.\n\nThe five preceding statements are spoken together,\nYet only the last is taken to conclude them.\n\nThis—\nThe world.\nKnow the world through the world,\nAnd so too the realm, village, family, and self—\nIs it not the simplest, the easiest?\n\n---\nThe depth of virtue is like that of an infant.\nThose who harbor boundless virtue within\nAre like a babe.\n\nThe previous chapter says:\n\"Concentrate the qi, achieve softness—\nCan you be like an infant?\"\nConstant virtue never departs,\nReturning to the infant’s state.\n\nMencius said:\n\"The noble person does not lose the heart of an infant.\"\n\nMaster Su said:\nWhen *Laozi* compares virtue to an infant,\nHe speaks of its essence before its function.\n\nPoisonous creatures do not sting,\nFierce beasts do not seize,\nRaptors do not strike.\n\nPoisonous creatures—bees, wasps, and their kind—\nSting with their tail’s venom.\nFierce beasts—tigers, leopards, and their kind—\nGrasp with claw and foot.\nRaptors—hawks and falcons, and their kind—\nSnatch with wing and talon.\n\nMaster Dong Si said:\nThe complete person harms no thing.\n\nMaster Su said:\nThe person without contrivance opposes none—\nhow could they be harmed?\nBones weak, sinews soft yet grip firm,\nunaware of male and female union yet aroused—\nthis is the utmost of *jing*.\nAll day crying yet throat unstrained—\nthis is the utmost of harmony.\n\n*Yin* (赤子阴), the infant’s cry—*hao*—\n*hao*, weeping; *gē*—\n*gē*, voice hoarse.\nForm not yet complete yet *qi* already concentrated,\nemotion not yet stirred yet *qi* already responsive—\nthis is the extreme of pure, unified *jing-qi*.\nVoice long-enduring yet *qi* unharmed—\nthis is the extreme of balanced, moderate *he-qi*.\n\nThe infant, though called \"child,\" is beyond duality.\n*Gē*—what astonishes—\nknowing harmony is constancy,\nknowing constancy is clarity.\nHumans who grasp the infant’s untrammled *qi* as constancy—\nthis is the clarity of Heaven’s true nature.\n\n*Yìshēng* (益生) is *xiáng*—\n*xiáng*, omen—unnatural *qi* of Heaven and Earth is *xiáng*.\nUnable to match the infant’s pure *qi*,\nthey rely on form to bolster *qi*—\nthis is the phantom body of external nourishment,\nnot the true *qi*.\nThey move *qi* by emotion—\nthis is the false strength of contrived desire.\nAll things flourish then decay—\nthis is called *not-Dao*,\nand *not-Dao* perishes early.\nRelying on form to bolster—\nthis is the flourishing of form.\nMoving by emotion—\nthis is the flourishing of emotion.\nAll things flourish then decay—\nthis is failing to attain constancy.\nFailing to attain the Way,\nthey perish early and cannot endure.\nConstant as the infant, how could they flourish?\nHow could they decay?\nIf they do not decay, how could they perish?\n\n---\n**Chapter 47**\nThe wise do not speak;\nspeakers lack wisdom.\nBlock the *dui* (口),\nshut the gate—\nthis is loving life, preserving *self*.\nWasting *qi* through speech—\nthis is ignorance of the Way.\nThose who know the Way do not speak;\nthey first block the source of speech—*dui*—\nthen seal the gate of *qi*.\nDull the sharp,\nresolve the tangled,\nsoften the bright,\nalign with dust—\nthis is called *Xuan-Tong* (玄同).\nThis is interacting with the world.\nFirst dull your own sharpness,\nso as not to sharpen others’ tangles;\nfirst dim your own brightness,\nso as not to contrast with others’ obscurity.\nIn self and others, no distinction between sharp/dull, bright/dark—\nharmonizing with the world, unfathomable—\nthus called *Xuan-Tong*.\nUnapproachable yet not distant,\nunprofitable yet not harmful,\nunexalted yet not lowly—\nthus most noble under Heaven.\nIf I am *Xuan-Tong*,\nnone can draw near or distance me,\nbenefit or harm me,\nelevate or debase me.\nGrace though like kin,\nyet people forget me—\nunapproachable.\nDistant as a passerby,\nyet none dare abandon me—\nnot distant.\nBeyond titles, wealth, or power,\nyet none can aid me—\nunprofitable.\nBeyond life, death, calamity, or fortune,\nyet none can harm me—\nunharmful.\nThough in authority like a sovereign,\npeople treat me familiarly—\nunexalted.\nInsignificant as a commoner,\nyet none dare slight me—\nnot lowly.\nThese six—\nwhat others cannot do,\nI alone achieve—\nthus most noble under Heaven.\n\n---\n**Chapter 48**\nGovern with *zhèng* (正), wage war with *qí* (奇),\nconquer the world with *wu-shì* (无事).\n*Zhèng*—laws and prohibitions rectify the crooked.\nGan Jiang governed with *zhèng*,\nbut the Sage-Kings rooted governance in self-cultivation and familial harmony,\nnot relying on laws and prohibitions for rectitude.\n*Qí*—stratagem, deceit, and guile—unnatural.\nSun Wu waged war with *qí*,\nbut the Sage-Kings’ heart was to comfort the people and punish wrong,\nnot valuing stratagem and deceit as *qí*.\n*Qí* may be used in war,\nbut not to govern;\n*Zhèng* may govern,\nbut not conquer the world.\n*Wu-shì*—the Three Sovereigns’ effortless rule,\nlike Heaven’s silent motion yet seasons proceed,\nall things born—\nwithout demanding compliance,\nyet none fail to comply—\nthus only *wu-shì* can conquer the world.\n\nHow do I know this?\n*[Setting forth the question to introduce the answer below.]*\n*Zhèng* can govern,\n*wu-shì* can conquer—\nhow do I know this is so?\n\nThe more taboos a land has,\nthe poorer its people.\nThe more useful tools a people have,\nthe more the state grows dim.\nThe more skilled artisans there are,\nthe more strange artifacts arise.\nThe more laws are promulgated,\nthe more thieves appear.\n\n*[Answering the prior claim that zhèng can only govern.]*\nTaboos—fear and prohibition, strict controls,\nintended to rectify morals—\nyet at every step or turn,\none risks transgression,\nliving in dread,\nunable to thrive,\nthus impoverished.\nUseful tools—nets, plows, pestles, mortars, boats, carts—\nintended to benefit the people—\nyet without centralized measurement or standardization,\nthe state grows dull and indistinct.\nArtisans—crafting tools, myriad trades competing for profit—\nthus arise those selling false or novel wares.\nLaws—what the people fear,\nflaunted yet easy to break,\ndriving them to despair,\nthus many turn to banditry.\n\nThe eight lines speak of two causes:\nexcessive laws breed taboos,\nexcessive skill breeds tools,\nthieves arise from poverty,\nstrange artifacts from the state’s dimness.\n\nThe Sage governs through clarity of administration,\nso the people know to fear and avoid transgression,\nand the myriad artisans gather,\nensuring the people’s wealth and sustenance—\nthis is what is meant by *zhèng* [rectification].\n\n*Zhèng* rectifies through *zhèng* [rectification],\nfor the hope is a well-ordered state.\nYet when the people below grow impoverished,\nsome become thieves and bandits,\nwhile corrupt governance above breeds strange wares—\nsuch are the consequences.\nThus, even in governing a state,\nthis approach remains insufficient.\n\nTherefore, the Sage proclaims:\n*\"I act without action, yet the people transform themselves;\nI love stillness, yet the people align with virtue;\nI engage in no affairs, yet the people grow wealthy;\nI harbor no desires, yet the people return to simplicity.\"*\n\nThis also answers the prior claim that *\"without action, one can seize the realm.\"*\nFor *wuwei* [non-action], loving stillness, and lacking desire—\nall are forms of *wu shì* [non-affairs].\nSince there is nothing to attend to,\nhow could the people not naturally turn toward loyalty?\nThus, the people spontaneously transform,\nspontaneously align with virtue,\nspontaneously grow wealthy,\nspontaneously return to simplicity—\nsuch are the results.\nTherefore, in seizing the realm,\nthis approach leaves abundance.\n\nWhen governance is obscure and unobtrusive,\nthe people are pure and unspoiled;\nwhen governance is sharp and scrutinizing,\nthe people grow cunning and depleted.\n\nMisfortune, ah! Fortune leans upon it;\nFortune, ah! Misfortune lurks within it.\nWho can know their ultimate end?\n\nSummarizing the two preceding stanzas:\n*Mùn-mùn* [obscure], not pleasing to the eye;\n*Chún-chún* [pure], not tainted.\n*Chá-chá* [sharp], precise and keen;\n*Quē-quē* [depleted], never satisfied.\n\nAt the extreme of governance without affairs—\nthough *mùn-mùn* offers nothing to delight in,\nyet the people spontaneously transform, align with virtue, grow wealthy, and return to simplicity—\nand thus their purity is *chún-chún*.\nOr governance that is *chá-chá*, with much to observe,\nyet the people grow impoverished, the ruler grows benighted,\nthings become false, and the people disordered—\nand thus their depletion is *quē-quē*.\n\nThus, I borrow misfortune and fortune as metaphors:\nWhat men call misfortune—\nthey do not see that fortune leans upon its side,\nlike the *mùn-mùn* governance yielding *chún-chún* people.\nWhat men call fortune—\nthey do not see that misfortune lurks within it,\nlike the *chá-chá* governance yielding *quē-quē* people.\n\nMisfortune does not end in misfortune but ends in fortune;\nfortune does not end in fortune but ends in misfortune.\nWho can know where their end shall lie?\n\nAs for *zhèng* [rectitude],\nI ask: when rectitude turns to its opposite,\nthe good turns to its opposite.\nThe people’s confusion has long been thus.\n\n*Fù* [reverse], *shuò* [not good].\nTo govern with rectitude may be called good,\nyet if the people are *quē-quē*,\nthen what use is rectitude to the ruler?\n\nRectitude opposes irregularity—\nwhen rectitude reverses, it becomes the strange irregularity;\nthe good reverses, it becomes the *shuò* [not good].\nOnly when there is no rectitude to speak of,\nno goodness to speak of,\ndoes it not turn into the strange and the *shuò*.\n\nWho can know this? Only the Sage, perhaps?\nCommon men have long been bewildered, unaware of this truth—\nnot since today, but for ages.\nThey know only that governing with rectitude is good,\nyet they do not know that there is no rectitude to speak of as rectitude.\n\nTo take \"no rectitude\" as rectitude—\nhow does this differ from seizing the realm through non-action?\n\nThus, the Sage is square yet does not cut,\nsharp yet does not harm,\nupright yet does not overreach,\nbright yet does not dazzle.\n\nAgain, an illustration of *wu shì* [non-affairs]:\nSquare as a thing is square, with four sharp edges—\nsharp as a hall’s eaves, with a single edge like a blade—\nthe harm of cutting is worse than that of harming.\nThe square has no flexibility, the sharp no distinction—\nwhen encountering things, they must cause injury.\nThe upright cannot conceal or indulge in speech,\nrevealing others’ faults.\nThe bright cannot conceal themselves, flashing their virtues.\n\nThe Sage’s *wu shì* governance—\nto act without acting is to act.\nThe square must cut, yet to be square without cutting is not to cut;\nthe sharp must harm, yet to be sharp without harming is not to harm;\nthe upright must overreach, yet to be upright without overreaching is not to overreach;\nthe bright must dazzle, yet to be bright without dazzling is not to dazzle.\n\nSquare yet not cutting, sharp yet not harming,\nupright yet not overreaching, bright yet not dazzling—\nall are metaphors for *wu shì*.\n\n**Chapter 50: On Frugality and the Dao of Longevity**\n\nTo govern humanity and harmonize with Heaven,\nnothing surpasses frugality.\n\nThe form shaped by humanity,\nthe qi received from Heaven—\ngovern and cultivate them,\nnourish and preserve them.\n\nFrugality means\nnot lightly expending what is taken in,\nnot excessively consuming what is used—\na vital method to preserve form and spare qi.\n\nOnly through frugality\ndoes one return early.\n\nThis early return is called *heavy accumulation of virtue*.\nHeavy accumulation of virtue means\nnothing cannot be overcome;\nnothing cannot be overcome means\nits limits are unknown;\nits limits unknown means\none can possess a realm.\n\n*Return* means to revert to its origin.\n*Heavy* means abundant.\n*Accumulation* means to store and gather within.\n*Virtue* is the primordial qi received from Heaven.\n*Overcome* means to conquer.\n*Limits* means ultimate exhaustion.\n*Possess* means to safeguard.\nA realm is used to analogize the human body.\n\nTo be frugal in using qi,\nthe damaged become whole,\nthe declining flourish,\nand one early attains the return to origin.\nThe accumulated primordial qi stored within\nincreases without decrease.\n\nWhen qi is full and replete,\nit can conquer external things,\nand none can deplete or harm it.\nQi’s generation and flourishing never cease,\nits ultimate exhaustion unknown—\nunlike the common person’s qi,\nwhich ages, declines, and is exhausted until ultimate exhaustion.\n\nQi without ultimate exhaustion\ncan safeguard the body,\nand the form lingers long in the world.\n\nThe mother of possessing a realm,\nthis is the Dao of deep roots and firm stems,\nlongevity and enduring vision.\n\nThe earlier text spoke of preserving the body’s form through accumulated virtue.\nVirtue is the mother of all things’ forms.\nTo possess the body’s form\nis to possess the mother of the body’s form,\nthus it can endure.\n\nQi is the mother of the body’s form;\nqi can preserve form,\nand form can preserve qi.\n\nQi generated from below,\nlike a tree’s roots—\nnourishing form to cultivate roots makes them deep and unplucked;\nqi flourishing above,\nlike a fruit’s stem—\nnourishing form to nourish the stem makes it firm and unsevered.\n\nRoots unplucked, the tree never withers;\nstems unsevered, the fruit never falls.\nThis is why the body attains longevity,\nthe eyes endure long vision,\nand one transcends the world without dying.\n\nDeep roots and firm stems—\nthe form’s preservation of qi;\nlongevity and enduring vision—\nthe form’s preservation of qi.\n\n**Chapter 51**\nTo govern a great state,\nas one poaches a small fish.\nA small fish—small indeed.\nA great state has many people;\nto govern it, one must be simple and tranquil,\nnever disturbing the people,\nlike poaching a small fish—\nlest it spoil, one dares not stir it.\n\nHe who rules the world by the Dao,\nhis spirits are not numinous.\n*Numinous*—spirits of heaven and earth.\n*Ghosts*—the qi of heaven and earth.\n*Numinous*—the strange and uncanny.\nWhen human qi aligns with heaven and earth’s qi as one,\na sage-ruler governs by the Dao,\nsimple and tranquil, undisturbing the people,\nso the people’s qi harmonizes,\nfilling the space between heaven and earth,\nresponding in kind—\nheaven and earth’s qi never clash or harm.\nThus, ghosts do not become numinous and bring calamity.\n\nIt is not that their spirits are not numinous,\nbut that their numinousness does not harm people.\nIt is not that their numinousness does not harm people,\nbut that the Sage does not harm them either.\nGhosts and spirits are but names for heaven and earth’s qi—\ntwo names, one reality.\nWhen neither harms the other,\nvirtue returns to its source.\n\n*Return*—both.\nHeaven and earth’s qi do not harm people\nbecause the Sage does not harm heaven and earth’s qi.\nThe Sage does not harm heaven and earth’s qi\nbecause he is simple and tranquil, and the people’s qi is harmonious.\nBoth unharmed—\nthis arises from the Sage’s virtue,\nso both return virtue to the Sage.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 52**\nA great state is the confluence of the world,\nthe gathering place of all.\n*Gathering*—meeting.\nA great state is where small states converge,\nlike water’s downward flow,\nthe meeting of all waters beneath heaven.\n\nThe world’s female.\nThe female ever overcomes the male by stillness,\nby taking the low.\nThe female does not move first to seek the male;\nthe male ever moves first to seek the female.\nThe active seeker invites loss;\nthe still awaiter gains benefit—\nthus, *stillness overcomes the male*.\nThe active seeker is above;\nthe still awaiter is below—\nthus, *stillness is the low*.\n\nSome say the *female* may be a redundant character.\n\nThus, when a great state yields to small states,\nit takes from them;\nwhen small states yield to great states,\nthey take from them.\n*Yielding to take*—the great state yields to take the small’s attachment;\n*yielding while taking*—the small state yields to take the great’s favor.\n\nThe great state seeks only to encompass and nourish others;\nthe small state seeks only to serve others.\nBoth obtain what they desire—\nthe greater should thus be the lower.\n\nThe great state yields to the small,\ndesiring only to encompass and nourish them.\nThe small state yields to the great,\ndesiring only to serve them.\nBoth can yield—\nthen great and small each obtain their desire.\nYet the small is already beneath others,\nand fears not its inability to yield;\nthe great is not beneath others,\nand may fear its inability to yield—\nthus, *the greater should be the lower*.\n\nThe metaphor of *downward flow* illustrates the great state,\nthough not beneath others, yet yielding;\nthe metaphor of *female and male* illustrates the small state,\nalready beneath others, yet yielding.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter 53**\nThe Dao is the hidden core of all things,\nthe treasure of the virtuous,\nthe refuge of the unvirtuous.\n*The hidden core*—the most precious of all things.\n*Hidden*—the southwest corner of a hall.\nIn ancestral temple architecture,\nthere is the hall and the inner chamber;\nthe chamber is within, thus most honored.\nWithin the chamber,\nthe southeast corner is *yǎo*,\nthe northeast *yuàn*,\nthe northwest *wūlòu*.\n*The hidden*—where the honored reside,\nthus most precious.\nThe Dao’s nobility is like the hidden chamber of halls and temples.\n\n*A treasure*—what people value.\nThe virtuous advance by the Dao,\ngaining esteem from others.\nThe unvirtuous turn to the Dao,\nrepenting to preserve themselves.\n\n*Yǎo*—pronounced *yǎo* (as in *yǎo* 杳).\n*Yuàn*—pronounced *yuàn* (as in *yuàn* 颐).\n\nBeautiful speech can be sold;\nnoble conduct can elevate others.\nElaborating on the virtuous’ treasure.\nThe virtuous gain esteem by the Dao—\nlovely words are cherished, like fine goods sold in market;\nexalted deeds are revered, surpassing others.\n\nFor the unvirtuous, what cause is there to abandon it?\nElaborating on the unvirtuous’ refuge.\nThe unvirtuous preserve themselves by the Dao—\nfearing punishment, few in guilt,\ntheir bodies whole and secure.\nThus, even the unvirtuous—\nhow could the Dao ever abandon them?\n\nTherefore, when establishing a Son of Heaven and appointing the Three Ministers,\neven with a jade tablet and four horses led first,\nit is not as good as quietly presenting this Dao.\n\nElaborating on the Dao as the profound essence of all things.\nThose who embody the Dao are entrusted by Heaven with the positions of sovereign and teacher—\nthen they are established as the Son of Heaven;\ncommanded by the sovereign with the duties of mentor—\nthen they are appointed as the Three Ministers,\nall because they possess the Dao and are thus honored.\n\n*Scholar’s Note:*\n*Schùnbì*—a jade tablet curved like an embrace.\n*Sìmǎ*—four horses harnessed as one team.\nThe precedence of *schùnbì* over *sìmǎ* is akin to the *Spring and Autumn Annals*’ account of riding in a *wéi* carriage before twelve oxen.\n\n*Sitting*—here, kneeling.\n\nAt ceremonial feasts, four horses are arrayed outside,\nand the bearer of the *schùnbì* leads the mission, declaring, *“First, the morning tribute.”*\n\nThough the *schùnbì* and four horses are deemed the utmost honor,\nthey are not as precious as kneeling to present this Dao.\nThe nobility of the Son of Heaven and the Three Ministers\nlies in this Dao—\nthe *schùnbì* and four horses pale in comparison.\nThus, all things hold it in highest regard as their profound mystery.\n\nWhy, then, is this Dao so revered from antiquity?\nIs it not because one who seeks thereby obtains,\nand one who errs thereby is absolved?\nHence, it is cherished by all under Heaven.\n\n*Summarizing the three preceding sections:*\nThe Dao is the profound essence of all things—\nseeking thereby obtains speaks to the virtuous’ treasure,\nand erring thereby is absolved speaks to the unvirtuous’ refuge.\n\nWhy has this Dao been held in such esteem since ancient times?\nIs it not because the virtuous, through this Dao, are treasured by others and fulfill their desires?\nIs it not because the unvirtuous, through this Dao, preserve themselves and avoid guilt?\nThus, the Dao is the supreme treasure of all under Heaven.\n\n*Chapter 53:*\nTo act without doing,\nto manage without meddling,\nto savor without taste—\nall are the essence of *wuwei*.\nThe core tenets of the Laozi are thus expounded:\nIn conduct, to regard *wu-shì* as *shì*;\nIn sustenance, to regard *wu-wèi* as *wèi*—\nall unfolding the meaning of *wuwei* in a single phrase.\n\nTo plot difficulties in their ease,\nto forge greatness in their smallness.\nGreat undertakings under Heaven must begin in simplicity,\nand mighty deeds must arise from the minute.\n*Zuò*—to initiate.\n\nThus, one attains *wuwei* by planning when things are easy,\nand acting when they are small.\nAll things under Heaven begin easy yet end difficult,\nbegin small yet end vast—\ntheir final difficulty stems from initial ease,\ntheir final grandeur from initial triviality.\nHence, if one acts when they are still easy and small,\ntheir end will not reach difficulty,\nand they will effortlessly attain greatness,\nwithout toil of heart or strength—\nthus achieving *wuwei*.\n\nIf one does not plan early,\nbut instead acts urgently when things are already begun,\nthen what was once easy grows difficult,\nwhat was once small fails to expand—\nheart and strength are exhausted,\nand *wuwei* becomes unattainable.\n\nTo hold steady what is stable,\nto plan before signs appear,\nto mend what is fragile before it shatters,\nto disperse what is subtle before it scatters—\nto act before existence,\nto govern before chaos.\nThis speaks to planning in their ease.\n\nThe tree that bears fruit begins as a tender shoot;\nthe nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;\na thousand-*li* journey starts beneath one’s feet.\nThis speaks to acting in their smallness.\n\nLight promises bring few fulfillments,\nmany easies breed many difficulties.\nThus, even the Sage finds difficulty in them,\nand so remains without difficulty.\n\n*Above:* the ease or difficulty of undertakings.\n*Here:* the ease or difficulty of the heart.\nThose who initially take vows lightly\nwill find it difficult to keep them at the end—\nthus, few fulfillments.\nThose who begin with many easies\nwill inevitably face many difficulties—\nso even before reaching the end’s difficulty,\nthe heart already deems it hard.\nThough the beginning was easy,\nthe heart still resists it—\neasy at the start and hard at the end,\nno vow is ever taken lightly,\nand so there is no difficulty at the end.\n\nGreat or small, many or few—\nrepaying grudges with virtue.\nThus, the Sage never claims greatness,\nand so achieves true greatness.\n\n*Above:* the greatness or smallness of undertakings.\n*Here:* the greatness or smallness of the heart.\nThough one may be great,\nthe heart remains humble;\nthough one may be many,\nthe heart remains few.\nThough there are grudges to repay,\none does not rely on one’s greatness or multitude,\nnor rush to assert justice and retaliate—\ninstead, one humbles oneself as small and few,\nbearing insults and repaying with virtue.\nFor when one is initially small and few,\nthe heart does not dare assume greatness,\nand when one is finally great and many,\nthe heart still does not dare assume greatness—\nconsistently self-effacing,\nthus achieving true greatness.\n\nThe people’s pursuits often falter as they near completion.\nTo guard the end as the beginning,\nthen there will be no failed undertakings.\n\n*Further elaborating on the two instances of “end” above:*\nThough one may have deemed it difficult at the start,\nby the end, it is no longer difficult;\nthough one may have dared not claim greatness at the start,\nby the end, one assumes greatness—\nthen undertakings near completion often fail at the end.\nThus, one must guard the end as the beginning—\ndifficult at the start and difficult at the end,\nnot great at the start and not great at the end—\nthen there will be no failed undertakings.\n\nTo act is to court failure;\nto grasp is to court loss.\nWithout action, there is no failure;\nwithout grasping, there is no loss.\n\n*Further elaborating on the two instances of “failure” above:*\nThose who fix their hearts on doing will sometimes undo their success;\nthose who fix their hearts on holding will sometimes lose what they grasp.\nWithout doing, there is no success or failure;\nwithout grasping, there is no gain or loss.\n\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring,\ndoes not prize hard-to-obtain goods;\nlearns without learning,\nreverses the errors of the common folk,\nassisting the natural unfolding of all things\nwithout daring to act.\n\nThe multitude pursues what I do not pursue;\nthe multitude scorns and passes by, yet I return to their path—\nthis is not learning what others learn,\nhence it is said: *\"learn without learning.\"*\n\nAll these who do not desire learning\ndo so because the Way of all things is *wuwei* and unfolds naturally.\nThus, I too act with *wuwei* and align with the natural unity of all things,\nas spokes depend on the hub to form one.\n\nThe chapter begins with *\"wuwei\"* and ends with *\"natural without daring to act\"*—\nits meaning is consistent from start to finish.\n\n---\n**Chapter 54**\nThe ancients who excelled in the Dao did not enlighten the people;\nthey sought to make them ignorant instead.\nTo have knowledge is enlightenment;\nto lack knowledge is ignorance.\n\nThe ancients cultivated their own virtue to enlighten the people’s virtue,\nyet they also wished that those who were ignorant might progress to enlightenment.\nIt is not that they did not desire enlightenment for the people,\nbut that they could not make them know—\nnot that they wished them to remain ignorant.\n\nLaozi was born in a declining age.\nHe saw that in ancient times, governance was through *wuwei*,\nand the people were pure and simple, yet unknowing.\nIn later times, governance was through action,\nand the people became deceitful and knowing.\n\nThose who excel in the Dao transform the people into purity and simplicity,\nnot to make them knowing,\nbut to make them ignorant.\n\nThis is a critique of the times, correcting perversity—\nyet its excess led to Qin’s burning of the classics\nto keep the common people ignorant.\n\nThe difficulty of governing lies in their intelligence.\nThus, ruling with intelligence is a state’s ruin;\nruling without intelligence is a state’s blessing.\n\nThe reason the people are difficult to govern\nis that their knowledge is excessive—\nlaws are made, yet deceit arises;\norders are given, yet trickery follows.\n\nRuling with intelligence means governing with cunning and wisdom,\nforcing the people to also become intelligent—\nthen they become crafty and difficult to govern.\nRuling with intelligence is the state’s harm.\n\nRuling without intelligence means dimming one’s own brilliance to lead the people,\nso that they also become ignorant and simple—\nthen they are docile and easy to govern.\nRuling without intelligence is the state’s blessing.\n\nTo know these two methods is to grasp the standard.\nThe two methods are: ruling with intelligence and ruling without intelligence.\n*Kai* means to take as a model for imitation;\n*shi* means to place oneself in humility.\n\nFor one who rides in a carriage,\nto straighten the back and lean on the rail is to place oneself in high status,\nbut to bow the head and lean on the crossbar is to place oneself in humility.\n\nNot placing oneself in intelligence but in ignorance—\nthis is to be humble rather than exalted.\n\nTo know the standard and model is called *Xuande* (Mysterious Virtue).\nMysterious Virtue is profound, distant,\ncontrary to all things,\nyet reaches the utmost harmony.\n\nThose who know to imitate the Sage’s humility\npossess a mysterious and wondrous virtue—\nprofound and distant, beyond ordinary measure.\nThus, people cannot fathom it.\n\nAll desire intelligence, yet I alone desire ignorance—\nthis is contrary to all things.\nContrary means opposition;\nnot contrary means conformity.\n\nThough contrary, it is not disorder—\nit is the greatest conformity.\nThus, it is the profound, distant, unfathomable virtue.\n\n---\n**Chapter 55**\nThe reason rivers and seas can be sovereign over all streams\nis that they excel in descending.\nThus, they become sovereign over all streams.\n\nAll streams’ waters converge in rivers and seas,\njust as all under heaven’s people converge to one ruler.\nRivers and seas are low in elevation,\nable to descend to all waters,\nthus they receive all streams and become sovereign.\n\nThe ruler’s ability to encompass all under heaven’s people\nis likewise so.\n\nThus, the Sage desires to be above others\nby speaking humbly;\ndesires to lead others\nby placing himself behind.\n\nTo speak humbly is to lower and bend one’s words without arrogance.\nTo place oneself behind is to retreat without advancing.\n\nThis is the Sage’s supreme virtue of modesty and yielding—\nnot from a deliberate desire to be above or lead others.\nThe reader must not take the words to harm the meaning.\n\nThus, when in a high position, others do not find it burdensome;\nwhen in the forefront, others do not find it harmful.\n*Heavy* means difficult;\n*Harm* means calamity.\n\nThe Sage, after descending and retreating,\nwhen placed above others, is not found burdensome;\nwhen placed before others, is not found harmful.\nThus, all under heaven willingly promote him without exhaustion.\n\nBecause he does not contend,\nnone can contend with him.\nAll under heaven willingly acclaim him,\nyet he does not weary of being placed above or before others—\nfor his humility and retreat,\nno one can contend with him for supremacy or precedence.\nThus, the Sage attains position and timing,\nultimately achieving to be above and lead others.\n\nDong Zhongshu said:\n*\"Virtue descending makes form ascend;\nvirtue retreating makes form advance.\"*\n\nYang Xiong said:\n*\"He who places himself low is exalted by others;\nhe who places himself behind is honored first.\"*\n\n---\n**Chapter 56**\nAll under heaven say my Dao is vast, yet seems unworthy.\nOnly because it is vast does it seem unworthy.\nIf it were worthy, it would have been so for long—\nthen it would be small.\n\nUnworthy means lacking resemblance,\ndoubtful as if possessing no ability at all.\nThe vast Dao seems unworthy,\nlike the commoners of the alleys calling Confucius \"vast yet without a single virtue.\"\n\nOnly because it is vast and beyond naming\ndoes it seem unworthy, with nothing to commend it.\n\nDong Zhongshu said:\n*\"If it resembles something, it is confined to one thing—\nhow can it be vast?\"*\n\nI possess three treasures, which I hold fast:\nFirst, *ci* (compassion);\nSecond, *jian* (frugality);\nThird, *not daring to lead all under heaven.*\n\nTo *hold* means to guard without loss.\n*Ci* is gentle, weak, and merciful, not rigid.\n*Jian* is sparse, modest, and thrifty, not extravagant.\n*Not daring to lead* is yielding and retreating, not aggressive.\n\nBy holding fast to these three treasures,\neven vastness seems unworthy.\n\nFor *ci* (compassion) brings courage;\n*jian* (frugality) brings breadth;\nnot daring to lead all under heaven brings mastery.\n\nNow abandon *ci* for courage,\nabandon *jian* for breadth,\nabandon yielding for leading—\nthen death is certain.\n\nThe compassionate seem cowardly yet are truly courageous;\nthe frugal seem narrow yet are truly expansive.\nA vessel’s form is fixed—its length is its excellence—\nyet one who does not lead is not its master.\nBut by yielding to others’ precedence,\none surpasses all things and becomes the vessel’s master.\n\nTo discard *ci*, *jian*, and retreat for the treasures of rigidity, extravagance, and aggression—\nthis is the path of those who court death.\n\nFor *ci* in battle brings victory,\nin defense brings steadfastness.\nWhen Heaven means to save, it does so with *ci* as its shield.\n*Ci* is the Dao of life,\nthe virtue of the seven generations,\nthe first of the three treasures.\nHere, we speak solely of *ci* as treasure—\nyet the other two are contained within it.\n\nThe compassionate are cherished by all as parents—\nwho would have a child attack their own parents?\nThus, to wage war or defend with *ci* is to ensure none dare oppose or assault,\nfor none can bear to harm what they hold dear.\nEven if enemies come to fight and attack,\nmany will aid as if defending their own kin—\nand victory and steadfastness shall follow.\nShould human strength fail, Heaven itself will aid,\npreventing defeat or rout.\nHeaven aids because they are shielded by *ci*.\n\nCao Cao and Fu Jian devoured without restraint—\ntheir lack of *ci* was extreme.\nThough Wu and Jin were not as saintly in their compassion,\nthey resisted invasion only when forced,\nyet compared to Cao and Fu, their actions were nearer to *ci*.\nAt the Red Cliffs, the wind and fire favored the south, destroying northern ships;\nat Qinggang, the wind and crane’s cry caused the enemy to flee—\nthough weak, Wu and Jin repelled armies of a hundred thousand.\nThis too was Heaven’s salvation.\n\nThe skilled warrior is not martial,\nthe skilled fighter does not rage,\nthe skilled victor does not engage,\nthe skilled leader serves below.\nThis is called the virtue of non-contention,\nthe strength of using others,\nharmonizing with Heaven—\nthe ultimate of antiquity.\n\nNow further expounding the treasure of *ci*:\nFour sentences, four *shàn* (excellences),\nthree on warfare, one on leadership.\n\nIn ancient times, chariot warfare was the norm.\nThree armored soldiers rode each chariot—\none arching left, one spearing right,\nthe driver wielding flag and drum,\nall singing of strength and might.\nSeventy-two foot soldiers served beneath,\nand before battle, they were roused to fury,\nurged to rage and contend for victory.\n\nBut the compassionate do not prize such strength in warriors,\nnor rage in battle,\nnor await confrontation to triumph.\nNo blades are drawn—\nthe enemy yields on its own.\nThough my wisdom surpasses others,\nI appear unwise;\nthough I have ability,\nI appear inept.\nI place myself below,\nusing others’ wisdom as my own,\ntheir strength as my own.\nWithout martial fury, without rage, without confrontation,\nI triumph through non-contention,\nas Heaven triumphs without contending.\n\nTo serve below means\nnot relying on one’s own wisdom and strength,\nbut using others’ power to accomplish one’s ends—\nas Heaven acts without action yet achieves all.\nThus it is said: *harmonizing with Heaven*.\n\nOnly the most ancient sages reached such heights—\nhence, the ultimate of antiquity.\n\nThere is a saying of warfare:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the responder,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"*\nThis is called:\n*having no march yet marching,*\n*having no arm yet warding,*\n*having no weapon yet conquering,*\n*having no enemy yet subduing.*\n\nAgain expounding the treasure of *ci*.\nThe phrase *\"I dare not\"* speaks to warfare.\nThose who wage war have said these words.\n\nTo be the aggressor is to initiate conflict against others.\nTo be the responder is to meet force only when compelled.\nTo advance an inch is difficult;\nto retreat a foot is easy.\n*Rén* (就) means to approach.\n\nThough one may be the aggressor, one is truly a responder;\nthough a responder, one does not wish to fight,\ndaring not to advance, preferring to retreat far.\nThe advancing warrior marshals his ranks and moves forward,\nbends his arm to wield his weapon,\nand presses onward to confront the enemy.\nIf he does not march, though he has ranks, it is as if he has none;\nif he does not bend his arm, though he has arms, it is as if he has none;\nif he does not wield his weapon, though he has weapons, it is as if he has none;\nif he does not confront, though enemies stand before him, it is as if they are none.\n*○* *Wúxíng* (无行) is pronounced *háng*.\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy nearly forfeits our treasure.\nThus, when armies clash,\nthe compassionate prevail.\n\nMarching three armies into perilous battle,\none must tremble with fear,\ndaring not to underestimate the enemy.\nTo underestimate the enemy is to court battle lightly,\nuntil killing becomes inevitable and our *ci* is lost—\nno greater calamity exists.\n\nThough not yet engaged in battle,\nonce the heart harbors underestimation,\nthe seeds of killing and forfeiture are already sown—\nhence, *\"nearly forfeits our treasure.\"*\n\n*Kàng* (抗) means to raise.\nThe *āi* (哀) is the manifestation of compassion.\nSu Shi said:\nWhen two armies raise their forces in confrontation,\nand I act only when compelled,\nthen pity for slaughter arises—\nand with pity, Heaven and humanity aid in victory.\n\nFor the compassionate do not defeat the uncompassionate through battle,\nbut subdue them without fighting—\nthis is true victory.\n\n---\n*Chapter Fifty-Seven concludes here.*\nMy words are very easy to know,\nvery easy to practice.\n\nThe world cannot know, cannot practice.\n\nLaozi teaches people to be soft, weak, humble, and lowly—\nhis words are very easy to know,\nhis deeds very easy to perform.\nYet as the age declines and customs degenerate,\nno one in the world can recognize the worth of his words,\nnor can they practice the softness, weakness, humility, and lowliness.\n\nWords have a *zōng* (宗), deeds have a *jūn* (君).\nFor only the unknowing fail to recognize me.\nThe *zōng* is noble among clans and unites a clan,\nthe *jūn* is noble among states and rules a state.\nSoftness, weakness, humility, and lowliness\ncan be the standard for all words, like a clan’s *zōng*;\ncan be the master of all deeds, like a state’s *jūn*.\n\nLaozi laments that people are foolish and unknowing,\nthus they fail to recognize the worth of my words.\nFew know me—\nand so I am noble.\n\nThus the Sage wears coarse cloth while treasuring jade within.\nHe both laments and seems to rejoice—\nnot that he rejoices, but deeply laments.\nFor those who recognize the worth of my words are few,\nand this is why my words are noble.\nIf all could know my words,\nthen I would be no different from the common crowd—\nno longer noble.\n\n*Pó* (褐) is coarse hemp cloth, worn by the lowly.\nPeople do not recognize the Sage;\nthey see only his outer garment like *pó*, unworthy of honor,\nunaware of the priceless jade within.\n\n*Chapter Fifty-Eight concludes here.*\nTo know the unknowing—\nthis is the highest virtue.\n\nTo not know what one knows—this is sickness.\nTo know yet seem not to know—this is the Sage’s wisdom,\nplunged in clarity and insight,\nyet guarded by simplicity, thus called *supreme*.\nTo not know yet think one knows—this is the fool’s folly,\ndeaf and blind, yet boasting of what they hear and see,\nthus called *sickness*.\n\nOnly by treating sickness as sickness\ndoes one escape sickness.\nTo treat sickness as sickness is to regard one’s affliction as affliction,\nand so to know sickness as sickness.\nIf one recognizes it as sickness and treats it as such,\nthen this sickness will no longer exist.\nThe Sage does not fall ill,\nfor he treats sickness as sickness,\nand thus does not fall ill.\n\nThe Sage is born knowing—\nthough knowing, he seems not to know.\nHow could there be sickness in knowing what one knows?\nHis freedom from sickness is natural and effortless,\nnot achieved by treating sickness as sickness.\n\nThe Sage does not rely on innate knowledge,\nthough he himself has no sickness to treat.\nYet seeing the unvirtuous, he reflects inwardly,\nand among the people’s treatable afflictions,\nhe is vigilant, regarding them as his own sickness,\nfor he treats others’ sickness as his own.\nThus, from beginning to end, he remains free of sickness.\n\n---\n*Chapter Fifty-Nine concludes here.*\n\nWhen the people do not fear *威* (threat),\nthe greatest threat has arrived.\n\n*威* is that which should be feared—\nmatters that shorten life and harm the body.\nThe greatest threat is death itself.\nIf people do not fear what should be feared,\nthey will harm their bodies and shorten their lives,\nhurrying toward death—\nand so the greatest threat has arrived.\n\nZhuangzi said:\nWhat people should fear\nlies in their daily routines, between meals,\nyet they do not take warning.\nDo not grow familiar with where you dwell,\ndo not reject what sustains you.\n\nDo not neglect what is proper—\nrestrain your words.\n\n*狎* (xiá) means to grow accustomed through familiarity.\n*所居* is where the body abides.\n*厌* is to loathe and discard.\n\nIn daily life, whatever harms the body and shortens life—\nif one does not fear it, grows accustomed to it,\nand acts carelessly, this is to not fear *威*.\nTo reject what sustains life is to hasten death—\nthis is to loathe what sustains you,\nand so the greatest threat has arrived.\n\nOnly by not growing familiar\ndoes one not reject.\n*—Old texts read \"not reject\" where \"not grow familiar\" should be.*\nThe scholar Liu of Luling says:\nThe correct reading should be \"not grow familiar\" above.\nI follow this.\n\nOnly by not growing familiar with where you dwell\nand fearing what should be feared\ndoes one not reject what sustains life,\nand so the greatest threat does not arrive.\n\nThus the Sage knows himself without revealing himself,\nloves himself without valuing himself excessively,\nand so discards the former to embrace the latter.\n\n*自知* is knowing the way to cherish life.\n*自见* is displaying one’s knowledge to others.\n*自贵* is the later chapter’s *noble life*—\nthe fault of clinging too desperately to life.\n\nThe Sage, though inwardly knowing the way to love himself,\nconceals his virtue and follows the luminous Way,\nknowing yet seeming not to know,\nand does not parade his knowledge for others to see.\nThough his love for himself is profound,\nhe embodies the Dao naturally,\nas if life were not something to cling to,\nand avoids the error of greedily valuing life.\n\nThe former—what he does not possess—\nis what he discards.\nThe latter—what he does possess—\nis what he takes.\n\n**Chapter Sixty: The Bold and the Cautious**\n\nThe bold in daring bring death,\nthe bold in restraint bring life.\nThese two—one brings benefit, one brings harm.\n\nThis speaks of those whose strength exceeds others in enforcing law.\n*\"Daring\"* means daring to do evil.\n*\"Not daring\"* means not daring to do evil.\n\nSuppose two men are both bound by law:\nThe one bold in daring harbors a heart for evil beyond others—\nhe is one who, relying on finality, transgresses deliberately.\nThus, he must be put to death.\nThe *Yu Dian* calls this *\"the punishment for treachery,\"*\nthe *Zhou Gao* calls it *\"not a mistake,\"*\nfor those who act with finality must indeed be killed. #2\n\nThe one bold in restraint harbors a heart against evil beyond others—\nhe is one who, by misfortune or error, transgresses.\nThus, he must be spared.\nThe *Yu Dian* says *\"mistakes and disasters are pardoned,\"*\nthe *Zhou Gao* says *\"not finality,\"*\nfor those who act in error must not be killed.\n\nPunishment for deliberate crime, pardon for mistakes—\nthese are the twofold laws of the Sage-King.\nBut Laozi’s meaning is otherwise:\nhe says these two—one brings benefit, one brings harm.\nBenefit lies in the bold who restrain and spare life,\nharm lies in the bold who dare and kill—\nlest they err in execution.\nThus, even the daring should not be killed,\nwhile the restrained must surely live.\n\nWho knows the will of Heaven?\nTherefore, even the Sage finds it difficult.\n\nThe one who dares to do evil is indeed what Heaven abhors, yet Heaven’s abhorrence is profound and inscrutable—how can one know for certain that he is truly the one Heaven abhors? Though such a person may be killed, the Sage still hesitates, not daring to kill lightly.\n\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs, does not speak yet responds, does not summon yet comes of its own accord—open and yet ever-conspiring. The heavenly net is vast, wide yet never misses.\n\nThe Sage does not kill lightly, yet evil-doers all escape—yet the net of Heaven is unbroken. Heaven’s judgment of evil men is not like man’s forceful contention, yet Heaven’s decree naturally overcomes them. It does not speak like man’s words, yet its response is swift as echo to sound. Its retribution comes not by summoning but spontaneously—great evil meets great retribution, and even with clever schemes, none can escape. Though Heaven acts without intent, open and simple, its retribution is subtle and beyond mortal contrivance.\n\nThe net of Heaven is vast, broad as if sparse yet not lax—yet it never misses a single one. Evil men cannot slip through, though the Sage does not kill them, Heaven itself does.\n\nIf the people do not fear death, how can you frighten them with death? If you could make the people always fear death, then those who act strangely, I could seize and kill—who would dare? \"Strange\" means unorthodox. If you make the common people always harbor fear of death, then those who act strangely and wickedly, I could seize and kill them—then all would know to fear, and who would dare to do evil?\n\nYet even if you kill evil men, those who dare to do evil will not cease—then it is clear the people are ignorant and do not fear death. Though evil men must face punishment and death, they still fear no one above—how can you frighten them with death and yet kill them lightly? There are always those who execute.\n\nIf one substitutes for the executioner to kill, it is like substituting for the master carpenter to hew. If one substitutes for the master carpenter to hew, few will avoid injury to their hands. If you do not frighten men with death, can evil-doers be left unkilled? It is said: there are those who execute. Those who execute are Heaven. Only Heaven can kill men, only the master carpenter can hew wood. If men seek to substitute for Heaven in killing, it is like substituting for the carpenter in hewing. Those who substitute in hewing will surely injure their hands—so too, those who substitute in killing will surely harm themselves.\n\nWithout human calamity, there must be Heaven’s punishment.\n\n---\n**Chapter 61 (in all, five sections):**\nThe first section speaks of the proper use of punishment, which cannot be fully followed—it reflects excessive pity and leniency.\nThe second section speaks of Heaven’s inscrutability and the caution against killing lightly.\nThe third section shows how Heaven can act as the executioner to teach.\nThe fourth section argues that the people cannot be coerced by fear and thus killing should not be light.\nThe fifth section warns against men presuming to substitute for Heaven in killing—great indeed is Laozi’s compassion.\n\nThe people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation—thus they hunger. \"Food\" refers to what the ruler takes from the people. \"Tax\" refers to what the people give to supply the ruler’s needs. If the ruler takes much from the people, the people will be hungry and poor.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because their rulers act—thus they are difficult to govern. If the ruler acts with schemes and cunning to control the people, the people in turn will deceive the ruler with deceit—thus they are difficult to govern.\n\nMen grow careless of death because they cling too much to life—thus they grow careless of death. Only those who do not cling to life are superior to those who prize it. \"Light\" means easy. \"Clinging to life\" means the heart is too set on living. \"Superior\" means surpassing. \"Prizing life\" is the same as clinging to life. If the heart is too set on living, if one over-preserves life, one may seek not to die yet instead make death easy.\n\nThe Perfect Man does not not love life—he follows its natural course, harbors no scheming heart, as if he does not cling to life. Yet he transcends his body while his body remains, surpassing those who labor their hearts to prize life and instead make death easy.\n\n---\n**Chapter 62:**\nMan’s life is soft and weak, yet his death is hard and strong.\nGrass and trees in life are soft and brittle, yet in death they wither and harden.\nIn life, man’s flesh is soft and pliable, his movements flexible and yielding; in death, he grows cold and rigid, stiff and unyielding. Grass and trees in life are soft and brittle, yet in death they wither and harden—thus speaking of man extends to grass and trees.\n\nTherefore, the hard and strong belong to death, the soft and weak belong to life.\nFrom the earlier text, man and grass and trees are soft in life yet hard in death—by this principle of things, one knows that in virtue and conduct, the hard and strong do not attain death, for they are of death’s kind, while the soft and weak preserve life, for they are of life’s kind.\n\nThus, strong armies do not conquer, strong trees are split.\nIn warfare, the weak demonstrate deep strategy and skill—the enemy, underestimating them, grows careless, and thus they win. Those who rely on strength are shallow in thought and arrogant—the enemy, fearing them, prepares against them, and thus they do not win.\n\nThe art of war begins like a maiden—showing weakness to the enemy by appearing open and vulnerable; later it flees like a hare—the enemy, unable to resist, is overcome. The Qin army passed through Zhou, their chariots leaping three hundred feet high, yet they were defeated at Zhaoyao. The Qi army invaded Jin, their soldiers hurling stones, yet they were defeated at [illegible].\n\nThis proves that relying on strength does not bring victory. \"Split\" means to be grasped by both hands. The weak, swaying branches are the small twigs near the ends, while the strong, unyielding ones are the great trunks near the roots—thus speaking of war extends to trees.\n\nTherefore, the hard and strong are lowly, the soft and weak are exalted. From the earlier text, strong armies are overcome by others—that is to be lowly, unable to rise like those who conquer. Strong trees are the trunks near the roots—that is to be lowly, unable to rise like the small branches.\n\nFrom this principle of nature, one understands that in human virtue and conduct, those who are firm and strong are proud of themselves and domineer over others, yet they will inevitably stumble and lose their exalted status, descending to a position beneath others. Those who are soft and weak, however, are revered and honored by all, thus attaining a position above others.\n\n---\n**Chapter 63: The Way of Heaven**\nIs it not like the drawing of a bow?\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised;\nThe excessive are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented.\nThe first two lines speak of drawing a bow, the latter two of the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhen a bow is slackened, its upper curve droops downward, its lower curve rises upward. When drawn taut, its upper curve lifts upward, its lower curve presses downward. Thus, the high (upper curve) is pressed down to the low, and the low (lower curve) is raised to the high. Heaven’s diminishing of excess is like pressing down the upper curve to lower it, and its supplementing of deficiency is like raising the lower curve to elevate it. The Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency.\n\nBut the Way of humanity is otherwise: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nHeaven’s Way takes from the full to benefit the humble, while humanity takes from the few to benefit the many, devours the small to benefit the great, seizes the poor to benefit the rich—this is how it defies the Way of Heaven.\n\nWho then can use their excess to nourish the world?\nOnly the Daoist.\n\nThe Daoist ruler, though noble as the Son of Heaven and wealthy with the Four Seas, does not claim ownership of his nobility or riches. He eats coarse food, wears rough garments, lives in humble dwellings, and spares no effort to conserve resources for the people, never wasting. He regulates the fields and teaches cultivation, lightens taxes, ensuring that families are well-provided and people are content. Thus, he uses his own excess to nourish the world.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without relying on it, achieves without claiming it. Does he not wish to display his virtue?\nThe Sage’s abilities cover the world—this is excess. Yet he does not rely on his abilities as if they were his own, nor does he claim his accomplishments as if they were his own, nor does he wish to show his virtue as superior to others. All these are ways of diminishing his own excess.\n\n---\n**Chapter 64: The Soft and Weak Overcome the Hard and Strong**\nNothing in the world is as soft and weak as water, yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong. This is because there is nothing to replace it.\nThough gold and stone are the hardest and strongest, grinding them still requires water. Thus, water is the foremost in attacking the hard and strong, and none can surpass it. Even if one wished to substitute another, there is no alternative.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong—all know this, yet none can practice it.\nWater is the most soft and weak, yet it can erode the hardest stone. This is how the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nThough all know this, none can act in accordance with softness and weakness—it is deceptive.\n\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"To bear a state’s filth is to be its guardian;\nTo bear a state’s misfortunes is to be its king.\"*\nFilth refers to impurity.\nMisfortune refers to what is unlucky and unvirtuous.\nImpurity and misfortune are what people despise and hold in contempt, yet the Sage does not shun them. Even if an entire state heaps such shame upon him, he accepts it without complaint. For he is soft and weak, willingly enduring humiliation to avoid domination like the hard and strong who seek to exalt themselves over others. Yet the spirits are pleased and he can be the guardian of the state, while the people turn to him and he can rule the world.\n\nThe hard and strong provoke divine wrath and popular rebellion, losing their state and their world. The soft and weak receive divine favor and popular allegiance, gaining their state and their world.\nThis is the effect of the soft and weak overcoming the hard and strong.\n\n---\n**Chapter 65: Straight Speech Seems Paradoxical**\nLaozi takes \"reversal\" as the movement of the Dao and the mystery of virtue, so even when speaking straightforwardly, it often seems contrary to the straightforward.\n\nStraightforward yet seeming reversed—like being bright yet appearing dim, advancing yet seeming to retreat, being upright yet seeming crooked, being skillful yet seeming clumsy—all follow this pattern. For what appears dim is the means to brightness, what appears to retreat is the means to advance, what appears crooked is the means to straightness, what appears clumsy is the means to skill, and what appears reversed is the means to the straight.\n\nThe following text states: *\"To reconcile deep grudges, one must have excess grudges—how then can it be considered good?\"*\nReconcile means to pacify.\nGrudge refers to resentment toward another.\nDeep grudge means the resentment is profound.\nExcess grudge means the resentment lingers unresolved within, like when the Master acted for the Duke of Wei—this is akin to aiding.\nGood refers to the virtuous person.\n\nWhen two parties hold grudges, they must be reconciled to resolve them. Two virtuous people naturally have no grudges, so why reconcile? Two wicked people, if they hold grudges, will either exhaust their evil and destroy each other, or one will triumph while the other is defeated, or both will be harmed. An outsider may merely observe in silence.\n\nOnly when a virtuous person, through misfortune, holds a grudge against a wicked one does the situation arise. Though the virtuous person is forgiving and has no ill will, the wicked one is vengeful and will surely act against the virtuous. If the wicked one retaliates, the virtuous will suffer.\n\nThus, those who sincerely wish to aid the virtuous must reconcile the grudge, easing the resentment and releasing the hatred, intending to benefit the virtuous. Yet by blocking the wicked one’s vengeful heart, preventing its fulfillment, the unresolved resentment lingers within. Though it may seem reconciled today, it will erupt violently later. How then can such reconciliation truly benefit the virtuous?\n\nThe Sage holds the left contract and does not demand repayment from others. To hold the left contract and not demand repayment is to act without scheming against things.\n\nA *contract* (契) is a wooden tally split in two, each party keeping one half as a pledge of trust. To *demand repayment* (责) means to claim goods or debts from another. The contract has left and right halves: the left is kept by the owner of the goods, while the right is given to the one who comes to claim them. The *Records of the Grand Historian* (《史记》) states that the right contract is used to demand repayment, and the *Book of Rites* (《礼记》) says that those offering land or houses hold the right contract—thus, the left contract is the proof held by the one who receives repayment.\n\nTo hold the left contract means one does not demand repayment from others but waits for others to demand from oneself. If someone comes with the right contract to claim, one gives it without calculating whether the person is virtuous or wicked.\n\nThose who reconcile grudges act with intent to aid the virtuous, whereas the Sage acts without scheming, like one who holds the left contract and does not demand repayment—calmly observing things and letting them unfold naturally.\n\nThe virtuous manage contracts; the unvirtuous manage *simplicity* (彻). The virtuous act without scheming; the unvirtuous act with scheming. *Simplicity* (彻) means *universal harmony* (通).\n\nIn ancient times, the *assistance law* (助法) divided a well-field into nine sections: eight families each received one private section, while one section was public land, farmed collectively by the eight families. Each family’s private yield of a hundred *mu* could feed nine, eight, seven, six, or as few as five, depending on their strength and labor.\n\nThe Zhou dynasty replaced this with the *simplicity law* (彻法), fearing the private yields were uneven. Thus, the eight families’ private fields were also farmed collectively, ensuring equal distribution—no more excess or deficiency. Those who hold the left contract allow others to take without scheming, hence it is said the virtuous manage *simplicity*. Law arises from fear of inequality, scheming over fairness, hence it is said the unvirtuous manage it.\n\nThose who reconcile grudges fear the virtuous will suffer, acting with intent to aid them—like the unvirtuous managing *simplicity* for the weakest family, fearing their share will be meager.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none; it always aids the virtuous. *With* (与) here means *acts for*. The Sage, without scheming for the virtuous, yet Heaven acts for them, ensuring the wicked cannot act with malice.\n\nEarlier, it was said the Sage does not use punishment, yet Heaven slays the wicked. Here, it is said the Sage does not reconcile grudges, yet Heaven aids the virtuous. The Way of Laozi is *wuwei*—natural and entrusted to Heaven.\n\nYet Heaven’s destruction of the wicked and aid to the virtuous—how can it compare to human scheming? The wicked must meet calamity; the virtuous must receive blessing. Such is the natural order.\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\n\nIn small states with few people,\nLet the people have ten- or hundred-fold implements but not use them,\nLet the people value death but not flee far away.\n\n*Ten* (什) is ten people; *hundred* (伯) is a hundred. *Ten- or hundred-fold implements* are heavy, large tools, shared by all. *Not use* means not to labor for them, not to covet them—thus, heavy tools have no purpose.\n\n*Value death* means to regard death as a grave matter and cherish life. *Not flee far away* means to be born here and die here, not wandering elsewhere.\n\nLaozi sought to reverse the decline of the Zhou, restoring the simplicity of antiquity. Large states mean many people, difficult to govern; thus, he advocated small states with few people, ensuring the people do not covet the outside and are self-sufficient within.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages, there is no need to ride them;\nThough there are armor and weapons, there is no need to display them.\n\nBoats and carriages, armor and weapons—these are not things one person can use alone; they are the implements of *ten* and *hundred*. To have no need to ride them, to have no need to display them, is to not use them at all.\n\nIf there is nowhere to go, then boats and carriages are of no use;\nIf there is nothing to contend over, then armor and weapons are of no use.\nLet the people return to using knotted cords for record-keeping.\n\nWhen the people are pure and affairs are simple, the ancient governance of knotted cords can be restored. Though writing and contracts exist, they too may be unused—it is not merely the implements of *ten* and *hundred* that are set aside.\n\nLet them find their food sweet, their garments fine, their dwellings secure, and their customs joyful.\nThis is to value death and not wander far.\nTo call the food one eats sweet, the garments one wears fine—self-sufficient and content, cherishing life—this is to value death.\nTo find this dwelling secure and this land’s customs joyful—this is to not wander far.\nWho would lightly abandon their birthplace to wander elsewhere, when they may grow old and die there?\n\nNeighboring states lie in sight, their roosters and dogs heard in one another’s lands—yet let the people live out their lives without venturing beyond.\n\nThis is to say the people hold their native soil dear.\nThough neighboring states are close enough to see and hear one another’s roosters and dogs, even at such proximity, the people do not travel between them—let alone wander far.\n\n---\n**Chapter 67**\nFaithful words are not ornate; ornate words are not faithful.\nThe virtuous do not argue; those who argue are not virtuous.\nThe wise are not erudite; the erudite are not wise.\nTruthful speech requires no embellishment; embellished speech is surely false and artificial.\nThose truly skilled do not boast of their eloquence; those who boast of their eloquence are not truly skilled.\nThose truly wise do not seek breadth of knowledge; those who seek breadth of knowledge do not truly comprehend its essence.\n\nThus, this book concludes with such words—its language is harmonious, simple, and unadorned, neither argumentative nor overly broad. It is the speech of true virtue and true wisdom, unadorned and unfeigned.\n\nThe Sage does not hoard.\nThe more one gives to others, the more one possesses;\nThe more one shares with others, the more one has.\nNot hoarding means emptiness and lack of accumulation.\nTo act for others with what one knows, to speak for others with what one understands—\nEmpty and without accumulation, thus one’s responses are boundless.\nIf one accumulates and claims possession, then one’s responses are limited—how could one ever have more and more?\n\nZhuangzi said:\n*\"To consider accumulation as insufficient is to have no storehouse, thus there is abundance.\"*\n\nThe Dao of Heaven benefits without harming;\nThe Dao of the Sage acts without contending.\nBenefiting is the opposite of harming—where there is benefit, there must be harm.\nYet the Dao of Heaven, though beneficial, does not harm, for it benefits by not benefiting—thus there is no harm.\nAction is the beginning of contention—where there is action, there must be contention.\nYet the Sage’s Dao, though it acts, does not contend, for it acts by not acting—thus there is no contention.\n\n---\n**Chapter 68**\nThis concludes the two sections, revealing that all five thousand words adhere to this principle.\n\nThe *Laozi*’s text contains many errors. After collating the variations from dozens of editions and verifying their authenticity, the result is as above.\n\nThe *Zhuangzi* transmitted by Master Zhuang Junping contains seventy-two chapters, while other editions transmit eighty-one. However, some chapters were incorrectly divided, so it is standardized here as sixty-eight chapters: the upper section with thirty-two chapters (2,366 characters), the lower section with thirty-six chapters (2,926 characters), totaling 5,292 characters.\n\nPrefaced by Wu Cheng of Linchuan. The *True Classic of the Dao and Virtue* is completed, Volume Four.\n\n「#1 *Its refinement*: The *Yueya* edition reads *„Its refinement, indeed.“*\n#2 *Advancing forward*: The original reads *„not“* (改), corrected from the *Yueya* edition.\n#3 *Cannot but kill*: The original omits *„not“* before *„kill“* (补), restored from the *Yueya* edition.\n#4 *The beauty of speech*: The original omits *„者“* (补), restored from the *Yueya* edition.」",

eternal *Dao*.\nThe \"name\" refers to *virtue*—what can be designated is not the eternal name.\n\nThe *Dao* itself is nameless; it is called *Dao* alone.\nIf one speaks of it as a path that can be traversed, then it is not the eternal *Dao*.\n*Virtue*, though named, is but a forced designation.\nIf one speaks of it as a name that can be designated, then it is not the eternal *virtue*.\n\nThe nameless is the origin of Heaven and Earth;\nThe named is the mother of ten thousand things.\nThe nameless—this is the *Dao*; Heaven and Earth arise from this *Dao*, hence it is called the origin.\nThe named—this is *virtue*; ten thousand things arise from this *virtue*, hence it is called the mother.\n\nEver without desire, one observes its subtlety;\nEver with desire, one observes its peril.\nThe \"ever\" refers to the constancy of the eternal *Dao* and eternal *virtue*.\nEver without desire—this is the stillness of the sage’s nature, where the *Dao* manifests in its entirety, and from this one observes the subtlety of *virtue*.\nThe \"subtlety\" refers to the utmost excellence, spoken of in terms of the *Dao*.\nEver with desire—this is the sage’s responsiveness to things, where *virtue* acts in its fullest capacity, and from this one observes the peril of the *Dao*.\nThe \"peril\" refers to the threshold, as in Mencius’ \"the beginning.\"\n\nThese two—*Dao* and *virtue*—are the same.\nThese two—*Dao* and *virtue*—though distinct in name when manifested, are called the *Mystic*.\nThe *Mystic*—that which is profound and unfathomable.\n\n*Virtue* emerges from the *Dao* yet differs in name, so it is not called *Dao* but *virtue*.\nThough differing in name, *virtue* and *Dao* are both called the *Mystic*—thus they are not truly different.\n\nThe *Mystic*, again the *Mystic*—\nThe gateway through which all subtleties emerge.\n\nAll subtleties refer to *virtue*.\nThe gateway refers to their origin.\n\n*Virtue* and *Dao*, though both called the *Mystic*, are such that the *Dao* is the *Mystic* of *Mystics*—\nThe source from which all subtleties coalesce.\nThe subtlety of subtleties is the *Dao*;\nThe subtlety that unifies is *virtue*—\nThe subtlety that branches into myriad particulars.\n\n---\n**Chapter One**\nThis chapter expounds the essence of *Dao* and *virtue*.\n\nZhang Zai said:\nFrom the Great Emptiness comes the name *Heaven*;\nFrom *qi* transformation comes the name *Dao*.\nLaozi regards the Great Emptiness as that from which Heaven and Earth arise, calling it the *Dao*;\nAnd *qi* transformation as that from which all things derive their being, calling it *virtue*.\nThe *Dao* refers to the principle above form, unmingled with *qi*—as Zhuangzi’s \"ever non-existent.\"\n*Virtue* refers to the principle within form, where this principle inheres in *qi*—as Zhuangzi’s \"Supreme Unity.\"\nThus, its *Dao* and *virtue* take as their substance the natural void,\nAnd as their function the yielding and unfilled.\n\nWhen all under Heaven know beauty as beauty, then ugliness arises;\nWhen all know goodness as goodness, then badness arises.\n\"Beauty\" refers to beauty in contrast to other things, speaking of its substance.\n\"Goodness\" refers to excellence in its function.\nThe names of beauty and ugliness, goodness and badness, arise in relation.\nBecause ugliness exists, beauty exists;\nBecause badness exists, goodness exists.\nWhen all know this as beauty, that becomes ugliness;\nWhen all know this as goodness, that becomes badness.\nIf one were to eliminate both, making none know beauty as beauty or goodness as goodness,\nThen there would also be no ugliness, no badness.\n\nThus, existence and non-existence give rise to each other;\nDifficulty and ease complete each other;\nLength and shortness define each other;\nHigh and low depend on each other;\nSounds and tones harmonize;\nBefore and after follow each other.\n\nThe existence and non-existence of things,\nThe difficulty and ease of matters,\nThe length and shortness of forms,\nThe high and low of circumstances,\nThe opening and closing of sounds,\nThe purity and turbidity of tones,\nThe sequence of positions—\nThese are all paired opposites.\nWhere one exists, the other exists;\nWhere one does not exist, the other does not exist.\nThe arising of beauty and ugliness, goodness and badness, follows this same principle.\n\n\"Define each other\" refers to two forms standing side by side;\n\"Depend on each other\" refers to one ascending, one descending;\n\"Harmonize\" refers to one initiating, one responding;\n\"Follow\" refers to the sequential connection, like the wind following the earth.\n\nOf these five, four explicitly state their pairs,\nBut \"sounds and tones\" are not—\nFor if one merely says \"opening and closing, purity and turbidity,\"\nPeople would not recognize this as referring to sounds and tones.\nBy naming \"sounds and tones,\" their paired opposites—opening/closing, purity/turbidity—are naturally understood.\nThus, only the reality is indicated, not the pair.\n\nTherefore, the sage acts without action,\nAnd teaches without speech.\nIf one acts, then there are things left undone;\nOnly in non-action is there nothing left undone.\nIf one speaks, then there are things left unsaid;\nOnly in non-speech is there nothing left unsaid.\n\nAll things arise without his claiming them,\nAll things are born without his possessing them—\nHeaven and Earth are thus as well.\n\n\"Arise\" refers to the springtime when things begin to form;\n\"Claim\" refers to speech.\n\"Born\" refers to the summertime when things are fully formed;\n\"Possess\" refers to ownership.\nNot claiming, not possessing—\nThis is the silent teaching of Heaven and Earth.",

the boundless form,\n*Kuai* mirrors Original Qi, weaving the ceaseless flow.\nUnyielding means its motion is straight,\nEver producing means its birth knows no end.\n\nOnly because it is *tu*’s emptiness and *kuai*’s transformation—\nTransformation is ever extending,\nThus *kuai*’s motion and *tu*’s birth—\nBirth is ever enriching—\nWithin Heaven and Earth.\n\nIn the human realm, then,\nOnly when the heart is empty, uncluttered,\nAnd qi flows unobstructed along its paths,\nDoes qi move with constancy,\nAnd the abundance of life that emerges grow ever greater.\n\nMuch speech leads to exhaustion,\nBetter to guard the center.\n\n*Shu* means swiftness,\n*Qiong* means depletion of qi.\nWhen a person speaks much, their qi is drained,\nExhausting their reserves prematurely.\nBetter to keep the heart empty, steadfast in its place,\nSo that external things do not enter,\nAnd the inner spirit does not stray—\nThen its emptiness is boundless,\nAnd the qi it generates is boundless.\n\nThe *center* is the *tu*’s interior,\nWhere *kuai* performs its work.\n\n○ *Shu* sounds like *shuò*.\n\nThe Valley Spirit does not die—\nThis is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe *Valley* symbolizes emptiness;\nEmptiness preserves the spirit within—\nThus, the *Valley Spirit*.\nThe *Valley* is the center’s dwelling place,\nAnd the spirit that guards it—\nNot dying means Original Qi endures without end.\n\nThe *Female* symbolizes the moist, weak, yielding nature of Original Qi.\nThe prefix *Mysterious* is an honorific.\nThe Mysterious Female—\nThe mother of all things—\nAs Zhuangzi called the *Taiyi*,\nSome name it the *Soul Treasure, Post-Heaven’s Ancestor*.\n\nThe gate of the Mysterious Female—\nThis is called the Root of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe *gate* is

Earth—\nThe beginning of Heaven and Earth—\nAs Zhuangzi called the *Ever-Nonbeing*,\nSome name it the *Primordial Origin, Pre-Heaven’s Ancestor*.\n\nEnduring, as if it exists—\nUsing it does not exhaust.\n\n*Enduring* means unbroken continuity,\n*As if* means *like*—\nThe spirit’s preservation,\n*Exhaust* means labor.\n\nWhen qi is used with ease, it is nourished and grows daily;\nWhen used with strain, it is depleted and wanes.\nThe spirit, if preserved within, ensures qi is not consumed.\n\n---\n**Chapter Five:**\nHeaven endures, Earth persists.\n\nHeaven and Earth endure and persist\nBecause they do not generate themselves—\nThus they endure and persist.\n\nHeaven and Earth generate all things with their qi,\nYet do not generate their own qi.\n\nThus the Sage places himself last,\nYet is first;\nSets himself aside,\nYet is preserved.\n\nIs it not because he has no selfishness?\nThus he fulfills his selfishness.\n\n*Last* means humility, not seeking precedence,\n*First* means elevation, standing above.\n*Sets himself aside* means quietude, non-action, not seeking to augment life,\n*Preserved* means enduring, long-lasting in the world.\n*No selfishness* means placing himself last and setting himself aside,\n*Fulfills his selfishness* means being first and preserved.\n\nThe Sage does not *actively* fulfill his selfishness,\nYet naturally achieves being first and preserved.\nIf one assumes others seek to fulfill their selfishness,\nThen speaking of it would mean they *can* fulfill it.\n\n---\n**Chapter Six:**\nThe highest virtue is like water.\nWater benefits all things without striving,\nDwelling where people find repugnant—\nThus it approaches the Dao.\n\n*Highest virtue* means the supreme, ultimate virtue,\nThe virtue of those who embody the Dao.\nWhy is it like water?\nWater’s virtue lies in its ability to irrigate and cleanse,\nBenefiting all things without contention,\nNot seeking purity but dwelling in the low and filthy—\nThus it nears the virtue of the Dao.\n\n*Near* means close.\n\nTo dwell in good land,\nTo have a good heart like a deep well,\nTo associate with good people,\nTo speak with good faith,\nTo govern with good order,\nTo act with good skill,\nTo move at the right time.\n\nThese are the virtues that others deem good—\nTo dwell in good land is to secure a foundation,\nTo have a good heart is to be deep and still,\nTo associate with good people is to be close to the virtuous.\nTo speak with good faith is to be trustworthy,\nTo govern well is to value order,\nTo act with skill is to value competence,\nTo move at the right time is to act when opportunity arises.\n\nThese seven virtues all choose what others favor as good—\nThis may be called *good*, yet it is not the *highest virtue*.\n\nOnly because it does not contend,\nIs there no blame.\n\nOnly the highest virtue of the Dao—\nNot contending, yet content to dwell below,\nLike water—\nThus no one blames it.\n\n*Blame* means resentment.\nOthers dislike dwelling below but seek to rise,\nThose who desire to surpass others harbor contention,\nAnd contention brings blame.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seven:**\nTo grasp and

Whatever is visible in form and *qi* is the manifestation of virtue. Yet the reason virtue takes this form is that it arises from the Dao.\n\nThe Dao itself is but vague and indistinct. Virtue emerges from the Dao, yet the Dao itself is nothing. Virtue is what the Dao produces—seemingly both present and absent, unseen—thus it is called vague and indistinct.\n\n*\"Vague and indistinct, yet within it is essence;\nIndistinct and vague, yet within it are forms.\"*\n\nThese lines refer to virtue. *\"Essence\"* means the tangible forms that arise after things take shape. *\"Forms\"* refers to the *qi* that precedes their generation. Though virtue is vague and indistinct—neither fully seen nor unseen—what is visible in form becomes essence, and what is visible in *qi* becomes pattern, both of which belong to virtue.\n\nAncient scholars spoke of the boundless void where all things already exist—this is it.\n\n*\"Deep and dark, yet within it is purity.\"*\n\nThough vague and indistinct seem almost visible, they are still somewhat discernible. But deep and dark is utter obscurity—this is the Dao’s nothingness. These lines refer to the Dao; *\"purity\"* means virtue.\n\nWhat has essence and form is the coarse manifestation of virtue. Virtue itself, the source of essence and form, is its refined core. Zhuangzi said: *\"Take virtue as the root, the root as the essence.\"*\n\nThe earlier passage states that essence and form arise from virtue; this passage says virtue arises from the Dao. Its essence is most true, within it lies authenticity.\n\n*\"Its character is twofold—again referring to virtue. True* means the Dao. *Authentic* means real, synonymous with *true*. Essence and form are coarse, while virtue is refined—this refined aspect is the most true Dao within. Virtue contains the utterly real Dao.\n\nThe earlier passage says the Dao contains virtue; this says virtue contains the Dao—indeed, the Dao is virtue, virtue is the Dao. The first chapter declares: these two are one.\n\n*\"From ancient times to today, its name does not fade,\nTo observe all things in their beauty.\"*\n\n*\"Does not fade\"* means it endures. *\"Observe\"* is akin to *\"pervade.\"* *\"Beauty\"* means all things. Though all things’ beauty may change and perish, supreme virtue arising from the Dao remains unchanging from ancient times to today.

Yet if one focuses single-mindedly on what is incomplete, refining one’s essence therein, extending laterally to the other, mastering one principle to reverse three, penetrating one to exhaust all ten thousand—over time, one will surely attain wholeness.\n\nIf from the outset one seeks wholeness, ambition swells and the heart labors, divided and undedicated, never achieving wholeness.\n\nCrooked (*wǎng*) is not straight. The inchworm bends and becomes crooked, yet thereby it stretches and becomes straight. Hollow (*wā*) is not full. A ditch or pit sinks and becomes hollow, yet thereby it receives water and becomes full. Worn (*bì*) is not new. Autumn and winter wither and become worn, yet thereby they meet spring and renew. Few (*shǎo*) is not many. Fewness leads to abundance—one sentence split into two: fewness is easier to possess, thus one accumulates and becomes many. Coveting many brings confusion, and in one thing, nothing is gained—how could one then become many?\n\nNot desiring straightness, not desiring fullness, not desiring renewal, not desiring abundance—yet beginning with *\"bent, yet whole\"*, these four are all extensions of *\"not seeking wholeness.\"*\n\nThus the Sage embraces *One* as the model for all under Heaven.\n\nThis sentence is the chapter’s central thesis, unifying the meaning above and below. *One* is the virtue of emptiness and voidness. *Model* (*shì*) is illustrated by a cart: high, one leans on the crossbar; low, one leans on the model. The Sage embraces this virtue of emptiness and voidness, moist and weak yet humble, as the model for all under Heaven—like the five principles above, all are the virtue of emptiness, self-placing in lowliness.\n\n*Jiào* (较) is pronounced *jiǎo* (角).\n\nNot self-displaying, hence enlightened;\nNot self-praising, hence renowned;\nNot self-boasting, hence accomplished;\nNot self-glorifying, hence enduring.\n\nOnly by not contending does one under Heaven find none who can contend with them.\n\nSelf-display is like self-flaunting; *enlightened* refers to the clarity of wisdom—one who does not self-display shines through obscurity. Self-praise is like self-exalting; *renowned* refers to the brilliance of name—one who does not self-praise grows ever more luminous. To boast of one’s deeds is *boasting*; *accomplished* refers to completed achievements. To arrogate one’s superiority is *glorifying*; *superiority* refers to abilities surpassing others. If one does not self-display, self-praise, boast, or glorify—yet concludes with *\"Only by not contending\"*—these four are all the remnants of *\"not contending.\"*\n\nThe ancients’ *\"bent, yet whole\"*—was this mere empty speech? Truly whole, and thus returned to it.\n\nThe three characters *\"bent, yet whole\"* were an ancient saying, which Laozi cited as this chapter’s opening. Within the chapter, *\"embracing One\"* is the guiding thread; *\"bent, yet whole\"* and the five following, *\"only by not contending\"* and the five above—ten matters in total—all are what *\"bent, yet whole\"* can encompass. Hence it is restated at the chapter’s end: *\"The ancients’ ‘bent, yet whole’—was this not sincere, a saying without substance? Rather, it is the genuine attainment of wholeness, and thus the effect of wholeness is returned to it.\"*\n\n**Chapter Nineteen:**\n*\"Rare speech is natural.\"*\n\nListening yet not hearing is *rare* (*xī*); rare speech is no speech. Those who attain the Dao forget speech, following only their natural state.\n\nA gusting wind does not last till morning; a sudden rain does not last till evening. Who does this? Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth cannot endure long, yet how much less so for humans?\n\n*Gusting* (*piāo*) is wild and swift; *sudden* (*zòu*) is abrupt and violent. From dawn till mealtime is *\"till morning\"* (*zhōng zhāo*); from dawn till dusk is *\"till evening\"* (*zhōng rì*). Not following one’s natural state and yet speaking lightly and impulsively—like Heaven and Earth’s gusting winds and sudden rains—all are contrary to nature’s constancy, becoming monstrous anomalies. Heaven and Earth, contrary to nature’s constancy, cannot endure long as monstrous anomalies, not lasting till morning or evening—how much less so for humans, not following nature?\n\nThus those who follow the Dao:\nThose who align with the Dao are in accord with the Dao;\nThose who align with virtue are in accord with virtue;\nThose who align with error are in accord with error.\n\nTrust is insufficient here; distrust is insufficient here.\n\nThose of virtue and Dao regard me as one, verified and harmonized—what separation is there? Those of error regard me as one, yet perhaps through their singular truth they awaken to my universal truth—thus all three kinds of people gain through my observation.\n\nLaozi said: *\"Not speaking is harmony; harmony and speech are not harmonious; speech and harmony are not harmonious—thus there is no speech.\"* Also, this is Laozi’s meaning of rare speech, naturalness, and mysterious unity.\n\nThose who align with the Dao, the Dao also gains from them;\nThose who align with virtue, virtue also gains from them;\nThose who align with error, error also gains from them.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 25**\n\nTo take Heaven under Heaven before having it is already impossible to achieve through action, and to retain it after having it is also impossible to preserve through deliberate scheming. It is like a precious vessel—if one constantly clutches it in hand, never letting it go for an instant, fearing it might be lost, one will instead fail to safeguard it from ruin and loss. Hence, it is said: *\"To grasp it brings loss.\"*\n\nAll things either move forward or follow behind, either warm with breath or chill with wind, either grow strong or weaken, either flourish or collapse. Therefore, the Sage removes excess, removes extravagance, removes extravagance. This continues the thought from *\"To grasp it brings loss\"* in speaking of the Way of retaining Heaven under Heaven.\n\nThose who hold Heaven under Heaven—how can they ensure it will always remain theirs without perishing? The cycles of gain and loss, survival and ruin, are like the eight opposites—forward and following, breath and wind, strength and weakness, flourishing and collapse—contrasting yet interdependent. The Sage knows this inevitable progression and governs accordingly.\n\nAll things that grow too strong must decline, and decline is the beginning of ruin. Only by preventing excess can one avoid decline—and thus, ruin. Excess, extravagance, and extravagance are the times of utmost fullness. To remove excess is to keep things in a state of moderation. To remove extravagance is to keep things in a state of simplicity. To remove extravagance is to keep things in a state of restraint. If one does not allow things to grow too strong, then Heaven under Heaven can be preserved from ruin.\n\nMaster Zhao said: *\"Drinking wine should only reach a light intoxication, never full drunkenness; admiring flowers should stop at half-bloom, never until they wither.\"* This is the same meaning.\n\nMaster Su said: Some things move forward, others follow behind; some warm with breath, others chill with wind; some grow stronger, others weaken; some flourish, others collapse. These are the natural ways of things, inevitable forces that cannot be avoided. The foolish cling to self-interest and seek gain, attempting to resist or defy them—only to meet disaster, either in ruin or defeat. Only the Sage knows these cannot be reversed, so they follow them naturally, removing excess, removing extravagance, removing extravagance, preventing them from reaching extremes, and thus Heaven under Heaven faces no calamity.\n\nMaster Dong Si said: The Sage knows that the interplay of circumstances is the natural order, so they follow nature without allowing things to overflow and exceed.\n\n---\n\n**On aiding the ruler with the Dao, one does not use force to dominate Heaven under Heaven. Such actions invite retribution.**\n\nMaster Wang said: Even when aiding the ruler with the Dao, one must not use force to dominate Heaven under Heaven—how much less should the ruler themselves, who embody the Dao?\n\nMaster Su said: The Sage uses arms only when absolutely necessary. If one uses force to dominate Heaven under Heaven without necessity, even if they succeed, disaster will return to punish them. The kings of Chu, Qi, Qin, and Han—some perished themselves, others brought ruin to their descendants. These are the things men abhor, the things ghosts detest, and none have escaped.\n\nWhere the army encamps, thorns and brambles grow. After a great campaign, there will surely be years of famine.\n\nMaster Zheng’s commentary: The army seizes the people’s strength, so thorns and brambles grow; the ruler defies the natural order, so there are years of famine.\n\nMaster Su said: Where the army is, farming is neglected, fields lie fallow. After war, the killing energy prevails, and crops are ruined. This is true of all wars—how much more so when using force to dominate Heaven under Heaven?\n\nThe virtuous act decisively but do not seek to dominate. They act decisively without arrogance, without boasting, without pride, and only when there is no other choice—this is called acting decisively without domination.\n\nThe best use of arms is to resolve chaos in a single decisive moment, not to delay battle for victory and claim it as domination.\n\nMaster Su said: *\"Do not boast, do not glory, do not be proud, act only when there is no other choice\"*—these are the ways of not dominating.\n\nThings that flourish must grow old—this is called *not the Way*. *Not the Way* brings early ruin. Those who follow the Way remain like infants or young children, and thus do not grow old. But those who grow old like the strong must inevitably grow old—this is *not the Way*. *Not the Way* brings early ruin, meaning they cannot endure.\n\nMaster Su said: All things that grow strong must grow old—there is no exception. Only those who follow the Way, though complete, appear incomplete; though full, appear empty; never growing strong, thus never growing old, never dying.\n\nTo dominate Heaven under Heaven with arms is the height of strength—how could it not grow old?\n\nFine arms are an omen of misfortune. Things often resent them, so those who follow the Way do not dwell upon them. *\"Fine\"* here means *\"praised.\"* *\"Misfortune\"* means no blessings, only disaster. *\"Dwell upon\"* means to willingly take up such a path.\n\nThe gentleman, at home, values the left; in war, values the right. This speaks to the reality of not dwelling upon it—preferring the position one does not normally occupy, refusing to place oneself in the role of war.\n\nArms are instruments of misfortune, not the tools of the gentleman. Used only when there is no other choice, they should be approached with calm indifference.\n\nVictory is not a cause for celebration—it is an instrument of killing, a bringer of disaster, not a joyous deed. *\"Calm\"* means without delight; *\"indifference\"* means without attachment—this is not what the heart desires. *\"For the superior\"* means it is praiseworthy not to delight in war. Victory, though achieved, is not a cause for pride. To take pride in victory is to take pleasure in killing. Those who take pleasure in killing cannot achieve their aims in Heaven under Heaven.\n\nThis extends the idea that victory is not a cause for celebration. If one regards victory in war as a praiseworthy deed, then one takes pleasure in killing—and such cannot achieve their aims in Heaven under Heaven. Ultimately, this is a warning.\n\nJoyous matters are honored on the left; ominous matters on the right. The left general is stationed on the left, the supreme general on the right.",

Can it descend further to *virtue/power*?\nKnowing to stop at *virtue/power* is still not far from the Dao.\n*Not ruin* means not to be exhausted or depleted, meaning it can endure long without decay.\nMaster Su said: Would the Sage pursue fame while forgetting *pu* or chase the superficial while losing the fundamental? Thus, he rides through all transformations without ruin.\nThe Dao’s presence under Heaven is like rivers and valleys converging into the sea.\nThe earlier text spoke of going from non-being to being, stopping at *virtue/power*.\nThis again speaks of returning from being to non-being, returning to the Dao.\nTruly, the Dao’s presence under Heaven is like the sea, where all streams converge.\n*Virtue/power* is like the valleys and streams—when *virtue/power* returns to the Dao, it is like these streams uniting in the sea.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Seven**\n*Knowing others is wisdom; knowing oneself is enlightenment.*",

      "translated_text": "The *Dao* is first, *virtue* second, *benevolence* third, *righteousness* fourth, *rites* fifth, *wisdom* sixth.\nThe highest *virtue* is without *virtue*,\nThe highest *benevolence*—\nThe lowest *virtue* does not lose its way,\nThe highest *righteousness*—\nThe highest *rites*—\nThus, having *virtue* is to have none,\nNone is to act without action,\nAction is to have *virtue*,\n*Virtue* is to act,\n*Virtue* is to act,\nYet thin is the loyalty and trust—\nThis is the bloom of the *Dao*.\nTo have it is to have it,\nTo not have it is to have it,\nTo have it is to have it—\nNo response, the origin of chaos,\nThe beginning of folly.\n\nThose of old who attained the One:\nHeaven attained the One and became clear,\nEarth attained the One and became tranquil,\nThe Spirit attained the One and became numinous,\nThe Valley attained the One and became full,\nAll things attained the One and came to life,\nThe sovereign attained the One and became the standard for the world.\nThis is how the One was achieved.\n\nThe One is the *virtue* of emptiness and void,\nAs the previous chapter said, \"embracing the One,\"\nAs \"making it One,\" as the later chapter says, \"the *Dao* gives birth to the One\"—\nAll speak of this.\nZhuangzi called it the Great One,\nAnd simply called it the One.\nThis is the natural *Dao* in action—\nIts use is empty yet not filled,\nRetiring yet not leading,\nSoft yet not rigid,\nWeak yet not strong.\n\nThe previous chapter spoke of this repeatedly,\nBut this chapter fully unfolds its depths.\nTo attain it means to take this One as *virtue*,\nAnd thus be as such.\n\nHeaven, Earth, Spirit, and Valley—\nNames differ, reality is the same.\nWhat moves and becomes clear is called Heaven,\nWhat condenses and becomes tranquil is called Earth.\nThe Spirit is the subtle interplay of the two *qi* between things,\nAs Zhang Zai said, \"Two in one, hence unfathomable\"—\nIts use responds without measure, hence numinous.\nThe Valley is the empty space between things,\nAs Zhang Zai said, \"Empty and void is *qi*\"—\nIts *qi* fills without gap, hence full.\n\n*Acquiring* (贞) is like the trunk of a tree—\nTo be the standard for the world is to be the people’s ultimate.\nSaying Heaven is clear, Earth tranquil, Spirit numinous, Valley full,\nAll things perpetually alive—\nThe sovereign stands above the world as the people’s ultimate,\nAnd this is how the One is achieved.\n\nIf Heaven lacks clarity, it would crack,\nIf Earth lacks tranquility, it would tremble,\nIf the Spirit lacks numinosity, it would falter,\nIf the Valley lacks fullness, it would dry up,\nIf all things lack life, they would perish,\nIf the sovereign lacks the standard, his noble height would falter.\n\nTo lack it means to lack this *virtue* yet use it.\nCrack—splitting apart.\nTremble—shaking.\nFalter—unable to respond and thus be numinous.\nDry up—unable to fill and thus be full.\nPerish—extinguished and not alive.\nFalter—toppling and losing its place.\n\nThus, the noble relies on the base as its root,\nThe high relies on the low as its foundation.\nHence the sovereign calls himself \"lonely, bereft, unworthy\"—\nIs this not taking the base as root?\n\nNo?\nThis chapter speaks of the six together,\nBut here, following the words \"noble\" and \"high\" above,\nIt speaks specifically of the sovereign.\nFor the sovereign’s position is noble and high,\nYet the *virtue* of emptiness and void does not seek fullness—\nOnly to place oneself in the lowly.\n\n\"Lonely\" as without father,\n\"Bereft\" as without husband,\n\"Unworthy\" as unvirtuous—\nAll are unflattering names,\nNot what anyone would wish to possess,\nYet the sovereign calls himself thus—\nThis is placing oneself in the lowly.\n\nEarlier it said, \"The base is the root, the low the foundation,\"\nThen only said, \"The base is the root\"—\nOmitting the second to encompass both—\nA condensed style.\n\nThus, the highest praise is without praise,\nNot wanting to gleam like jade,\nOr clatter like stone.\n\n*Jingjing*—the appearance of jade,\n*Luo Luo*—the appearance of stone.\nWhen a person’s reputation is loudly proclaimed,\nIt is but shallow praise—\nIt must efface all reputation.\nWhen no one can be praised,\nThat is the height of praise—\nAlso the intent of placing oneself in the lowly,\nNot wanting to distinguish good and evil\nSo that people see the *jingjing* purity as jade,\nThe *luo luo* coarseness as stone.\n\nBoth passages speak of the *virtue* of emptiness and void—\nThus is the sovereign’s attainment of the One.\n\n---\n**Chapter Thirty-Four**\nThe contrary is the *Dao*’s motion,\nThe weak is the *Dao*’s use.\nThe *Dao*’s stillness is non-being,\nIts motion must necessarily oppose being—\nThe contrary is non-being yet not non-being.\nThe *Dao*’s essence is emptiness,\nIts use must necessarily be weak—\nThe weak is empty yet not filled.\nThese two sentences are the chapter’s key.\n\nAll things under Heaven are born of being,\nBeing is born of non-being.\nFrom here to the attainment of the utmost goodness—\nAll elaborate on \"the contrary is the *Dao*’s motion.\"\n\nAll things arise from *qi* gathering into form,\nForm from *qi*, *qi* from the *Dao*—\n*Qi* and form are being, yet the *Dao* is non-being.\nNon-being and being differ—\nHence \"contrary,\" speaking of how the *Dao* moves by contradiction.\n\nThe superior person, hearing the *Dao*, strives to practice it;\nThe middle person, hearing the *Dao*, holds it as if it might vanish;",

it might vanish.\nThe inferior person, lacking insight,\nLaughs at it because it does not conform to worldly expectations.\n\nFew possess this insight—\nHence the *Dao*’s true value.\nIf all could grasp it,\nIt would no longer be the *Dao*.\n\nThus it is said:\nThese words introduce the next two sections,\nSpeaking of those who established the *Dao*’s teachings.\n\nThe *Dao*’s contradictions are as follows:\nThe twelve matters below.\nThe *Dao*’s clarity is like obscurity,\nAdvancing like retreat,\nLeveling like unevenness—\nThese speak of motion through contradiction.\n\nPreserving

what the world rarely attains,\nIt elaborates on how weakness is the *Dao*’s use.\n\nThe *Dao* arises from the void,\nGenerating the pure *qi* of Oneness.\nThis pure *qi* generates yang and yin,\nDividing into Two,\nThen yin and yang merge with the pure *qi* as Three—\nThus it is said to generate Three,\nNot an additional Three beyond One and Two.\n\nAll things arise from these Three,\nThus in their birth, they carry yin behind and embrace yang before,\nWith harmonizing *qi* in between.\nHarmony means yin and yang are balanced, neither dominant.\n\nAll things rely on this harmonizing *qi* for life,\nAnd afterward, to preserve their essence,\nThey must use this same harmonizing *qi*—\nThus they do not lose their origin.\nSince the *qi* of birth is empty yet full,\nIt is called weakness.\nThis explains how the *Dao* moves through weakness.\n\nWhat people despise—\nOrphanhood, widowhood, poverty—\nThe king and duke hold as titles.\nThis speaks of those who understand\nUsing weakness as strength.\n\n\"Orphan, widow, poor\"—\nNone are names of strength,\nYet these are what people despise,\nWhile kings and dukes take them as titles—\nThus weakness is used.\n\nTherefore, sometimes loss brings gain,\nAnd gain brings loss.\nThis introduces the next two sections.\n\nWhat people teach, I also teach:\nThe overbearing meet no good end.\nI will make this my fundamental lesson.\n\nThis speaks of using weakness.\n*\"Overbearing\"* also means \"strong\"—\nBeams that span water, pillars that bear roofs,\nBoth called *liang*, for their strength.\n\"Not meeting a good end\" means dying untimely,\nAs when Zilu rushed ahead—\nThe Master said he would not meet a good end,\nAnd later he died in the chaos of Kong Yue’s rebellion.\n\n*\"Teaching father\"* means fundamental teaching,\nWhere none stands above.\nWhat people teach, I teach them to use weakness.\nThe overbearing, unable to yield,\nCannot preserve themselves.\nTheir strength brings gain but also untimely loss—\nThis is what is meant by \"gain that is loss,\"\nThe most essential lesson for teaching others.\n\nThe world’s ultimate softness\nOvercomes the world’s ultimate hardness.\nNo space enters no space—\nThus I know the benefits of *wuwei*.\n\nAgain expanding on the teaching of weakness:\nUltimate softness and emptiness are both weakness.\n*\"Overcomes\"* means to trample pebbles.\n*\"No space\"* means no gaps for entry.\nWater, the softest, erodes the hardest stone,\n*Qi* without substance penetrates walls without seams—\nThrough the softest, emptiest loss,\nComes the gain of overcoming hardness and entering the unenterable.\nSoftness overcomes hardness,\nEmptiness enters fullness—\nAll without effort, naturally.\nThus the benefits of *wuwei*.\n\nUnspoken teaching,\nThe benefits of *wuwei*—\nFew in the world attain them.\nThis concludes the meaning of the previous two sections.\n\n*\"Unspoken teaching\"* means\nThat which should be weak, not

      "translated_text": "**Chapter Thirty-Eight**\nWhen the Dao prevails under heaven, swift steeds are harnessed to dung carts.\nWhen the Dao does not prevail, warhorses breed in the borderlands.\n*\"However\"* (退, *què*), means to withdraw.\n*\"Swift steeds\"* (走马), are steeds of swiftness.\n*\"Dung carts\"* (粪车), are carts laden with dung.\nIn ancient times, every sixty-four *ling* made up a *dian*, each contributing warhorses as tribute. In an age of the Dao, all kept to their allotted lands without encroachment or war, so that common steeds were not yoked to war chariots, but rather withdrawn to serve the humble task of dunging the fields.\n*\"Warhorses\"* (戎马), are steeds trained in unison for battle.\n*\"Borderlands\"* (郊), are the contested frontiers between two states.\nIn an age without the Dao, raiders are called *\"invaders\"* (寇), and skirmishes erupt beyond the borders, so that warhorses cannot return to be bred within the state’s protection, but instead are born and raised in the wilderness.\n\nThe phrase *\"dung carts\"* in lower commentaries omits the character *\"car\"*, though *Zhuzi’s Collected Sayings* includes it—yet none know its source.\nNow examining: Zhang Heng’s *Eastern Capital Eulogy* states:\n*\"Swift steeds are withdrawn to dung carts.\"*\nThis employs Laozi’s full line, proving that in late Han, the character *\"car\"* was not yet omitted. Wang Bi’s annotation, being close to Zhang’s time, still retained it—yet later it was accidentally dropped, and subsequent errors led to its omission.\n*\"Border\"* (郊) rhymes with *\"lack\"* (阙), and omitting *\"car\"* breaks the rhyme.\n\nNo greater crime than desiring what is desirable,\nNo greater fault than striving to obtain it,\nNo greater calamity than failing to know contentment.\nThus, the *\"contentment\"* (足) of knowing contentment is ever content.\n\nCrimes, transgressions, evils, faults, and calamities are all disasters—\nYet calamity surpasses fault.\nThe spark of war arises from coveting land as desirable.\nKnowing it desirable, one schemes to seize it—this is the beginning of disaster.\nObtaining it yet failing to know satiety,\nEver craving more after gaining one ridge, then another—\nThen war knows no end, the ultimate disaster.\n\nIf each were to abide by their allotted lands,\nNot seeking to expand or encroach,\nAnd cultivate the heart’s contentment in self-sufficiency,\nThen there would be no greed, no war, and everlasting contentment.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Thirty-Nine**\nNot stepping beyond the door, one knows all under heaven;\nNot peering through the window, one beholds the Dao of Heaven.\nAll things and affairs under heaven are complete within me,\nThus though one does not step beyond the door, one knows them all.\n\nThe *\"Dao of Heaven\"* is the singular source of all principles.\nIt is grasped through inward observation—\nNot like external things, which must be seen through the window before recognition.\n\nThe farther one goes, the less one knows.\nNot knowing that all is contained within oneself,\nOne must travel to a place before knowing a matter—\nThus the farther one goes, the less one knows.\nHow could one not step beyond the door and yet know all under heaven?\n\n*\"Not covering\"* (不覆) *\"to see the Dao\"*—\nNone fail to know the myriad branches while ignorant of the single root.\nThus, no need to repeat.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without moving yet arrives,\nSees without gazing yet names,\nAccomplishes without doing.\nNot waiting to move outward to reach a place,\nThus knowing all under heaven’s affairs.\nNot waiting to observe a thing before naming its principle,\nThus not peering through the window yet seeing the Dao of Heaven.\n*\"Accomplishing without doing\"*—\nThe effect of the two preceding lines:\nOnly by not moving yet knowing all things,\nNot peering yet penetrating the source,\nDoes one, without any action, see all completed.\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty**\nStudying brings daily increase;\nPracticing the Dao brings daily decrease.\nThe scholar’s woe is scarcity, thus they strive for breadth—\nThus daily gains are made.\nThe Daoist returns from having to non-being—\nThus daily losses are sustained.\nDecrease again, decrease again,\nUntil reaching *wuwei*.\nWhen *wuwei* is attained, nothing remains undone.\n\nThe Daoist diminishes their deeds,\nDecrease again, decrease again—\nWhen all that can be diminished is exhausted,\nThen *wuwei* is achieved.\nThe doer of deeds does but one thing at a time,\nTen things at most—\nYet the things not yet done number in the thousands and ten-thousands,\nBeyond reckoning—\nHow could they all be done?\nOnly the *wuwei* does nothing,\nThus all things are accomplished without fail.\n\nThose who would take all under heaven\nMust first do nothing.\nOnce action begins,\nIt is insufficient to take all under heaven.\n*\"Doing nothing\"* means doing nothing at all—*wuwei*.\nYet it is said that those who take all under heaven\nMust first be without action,\nFor virtue overflows and draws all to itself.\nIf one relies on cunning and force,\nHow could they take all under heaven?\n\n---\n\n**Chapter Forty-One**\nThe Sage has no fixed heart,\nTaking the hearts of the people as their own.\n*Political Harmony* annotates:\nThe Sage’s heart is empty yet receptive,\nStill yet responsive—\nLike a mirror reflecting forms,\nTaking their beauty or ugliness,\nLike a valley echoing sounds,\nResponding to their loud or soft.\nWhat constancy could there be?\n\nDong Sijing says:\nThe Sage has no self,\nTheir heart not clinging to things,\nYet all things come and are met with ease.\n\nWang [Bi] says:\nAll thought is for responding to things.\nThe *Book of Documents* states:\n*\"From myself, the people are enlightened.\"*\nThe good, I treat as good;\nThe ungood, I also treat as good—thus goodness is attained.\nThe trustworthy, I trust;\nThe untrustworthy, I also trust—thus trust is attained.\nThe people’s goodness or ungoodness, trust or distrust—\nThe Sage does not distinguish right or wrong,\nBut treats all as good, all as trustworthy—\nNot only do the good attain goodness,\nThe trustworthy attain trust,\nBut the ungood also attain goodness,\nThe untrustworthy attain trust.\nThis is called the people attaining goodness and trust without loss—\nEven the ungood and untrustworthy are transformed into goodness and trust,\nThus all attain goodness and trust.\n\nThe Sage’s presence under heaven is *\"shrunken\"* (歙歙),\nMuddling the hearts of all.\nThe people fix their ears and eyes upon them,\nThe Sage treats them all as children.\n*\"Shrunken\"* (歙歙) conveys contraction.\nWang [Bi] says: *\"The heart has no fixed attachment.\"*\n*\"Muddling\"* (浑) means the mind has no direction.\nSome manuscripts render *\"shrunken\"* as *\"fearful\"* (惵惵) or *\"dreadful\"* (怵怵),\nBoth conveying terror—\nYet Wang Bi writes *\"shrunken\"* (歙), interpreting it as *\"the heart has no fixed attachment,\"*\nAligned with the context above and below.",

lifetime.\n\nAll people must speak to conduct affairs,\nAnd daily opening the mouth to speak\nExhausts the qi until it is depleted—\nIn their lifetime, this cannot be remedied.\n\nSeeing smallness as clarity,\nGuarding softness as strength.\nSmallness refers to the *\"wēi\"* (subtle) of the previous chapter—\nWhat is seen is vague and indistinct,\nYet if one does not desire its clarity,\nThey will not overuse the spirit to harm the clarity,\nBut rather advance toward clarity each day.\nWhat is held firm is fragile and weak,\nYet if one does not desire its strength,\nThey will not forcefully expend qi to harm strength,\nBut rather advance toward strength each day.\n\nSeeing smallness is nurturing the child.\nGuarding softness is guarding the mother.\n*\"Day\"* may be a scribal error for *\"or\"* (as in *\"either\"*).\n\nUsing its light,\nReturning to its clarity—\nNo harm comes to the body.\nThis is called *\"clinging to constancy.\"*\n\nThis speaks of the method of nurturing the child:\nA mirror’s ability to reflect is its light,\nThe essence of that light is its clarity.\nUsing the light that shines outward,\nReturning it inward to illuminate within—\nRestoring and returning it to its hidden essence.\nThe spirit, if overused, will be exhausted;\nSeeing the depths of the fish is an omen of misfortune—\nThis is using light externally to bring harm to the body.\nIf one contains the light and blends with the world,\nThere will be no harm.\nThis is called *\"clinging to constancy\"*—\nThe ability to conceal the ordinary use of light\nAnd return to the ordinary essence of clarity.\n\n---\n**Chapter 44**\nThe previous chapter spoke of *Dao* and *virtue/power* in all things.\nThis chapter speaks of *Dao* and *virtue/power* within a single human body.\n\nIf I—suddenly aware—\nWere to walk the Great Dao,\nI would fear only *excessive display*.\n\n*\"I\"* refers generally to all people, not Laozi himself.\n*\"Suddenly aware\"* (*jièrán*)—same usage as in *Mencius*, meaning a fleeting moment.\nThe word *\"know\"* is abruptly cut off.\n*\"Excessive display\"* (*shī*)—akin to *\"wúshīláo\"* in the *Analects* and *\"shīshī\"* in *Mencius*, meaning boastful arrogance.\nThe Confucian disciple Yan Hui was *\"as if without\"* and *\"as if empty\"*—\nFree from boastful arrogance.\nLaozi’s teachings were likely of this nature,\nFor he most abhorred such display.\n\nThis chapter speaks of those who do not know the Dao,\nWho only seek boastful arrogance.\nIf such a person, in a fleeting moment, were to gain some knowledge\nAnd wish to walk the Great Dao,\nThey would fear only *excessive display* and dare not act.\n\n---\n**Chapter 45**\nThe Great Dao is most level,\nYet people prefer narrow paths.\n\n*Narrow paths* are small roads,\nOpposite to the Great Dao.\nThe humble and retiring are the Great Dao—\nIts way is level and easy to walk.\nThe boastful and arrogant are narrow paths—\nYet people love to tread them.\n\nThe court is excessively adorned,\nThe fields lie fallow,\nThe granaries are empty,\nYet they wear ornate robes and gird fine swords,\nRejecting food and drink,\nHoarding wealth in excess—\nThis is called *robber’s display*,\nNot the Dao.\n\nWithin the hall, there is no wine or sweeping—\nThis is the frugality of the *Tang* and *Yin* winds.\nIf the court is excessively adorned, then the palaces must be extravagant.\nFallow fields and empty granaries mean seizing the people’s time so they cannot till or rest,\nExhausting their strength yet leaving them with no stores.\nWearing fine silks and jade as adornment,\nFeasting on rich foods and meats as nourishment,\nFilling private treasuries as wealth—\nThis is like a thief who, having stolen much,\nDisplays it arrogantly abroad.\nThe tyrants Jia of Xia, Jie of Yin, and Zhou of Shang were such—\nHow could one who knows the Dao do this?\n\n---\nA well-built foundation cannot be uprooted,\nA well-embraced object cannot slip away.\nTheir descendants will never cease in sacrifice.",

begun,\nthen what was once easy grows difficult,\nwhat was once small fails to expand—\nheart and strength are exhausted,\nand *wuwei* becomes unattainable.\n\nTo hold steady what is stable,\nto plan before signs appear,\nto mend what is fragile before it shatters,\nto disperse what is subtle before it scatters—\nto act before existence,\nto govern before chaos.\nThis speaks to planning in their ease.\n\nThe tree that bears fruit begins as a tender shoot;\nthe nine-tiered tower rises from a pile of earth;\na thousand-*li* journey starts beneath one’s feet.\nThis speaks to acting in their smallness.\n\nLight promises bring few fulfillments,\nmany easies breed many difficulties.\nThus, even the Sage finds difficulty in them,\nand so remains without difficulty.\n\n*Above:* the ease or difficulty of undertakings.\n*Here:* the ease or difficulty of the heart.\nThose who initially take vows lightly\nwill find it difficult to keep them at the end—\nthus, few fulfillments.\nThose who begin with many easies\nwill inevitably face many difficulties—\nso even before reaching the end’s difficulty,\nthe heart already deems it hard.\nThough the beginning was easy,\nthe heart still resists it—\neasy at the start and hard at the end,\nno vow is ever taken lightly,\nand so there is no difficulty at the end.\n\nGreat or small, many or few—\nrepaying grudges with virtue.\nThus, the Sage never claims greatness,\nand so achieves true greatness.\n\n*Above:* the greatness or smallness of undertakings.\n*Here:* the greatness or smallness of the heart.\nThough one may be great,\nthe heart remains humble;\nthough one may be many,\nthe heart remains few.\nThough there are grudges to repay,\none does not rely on one’s greatness or multitude,\nnor rush to assert justice and retaliate—\ninstead, one humbles oneself as small and few,\nbearing insults and repaying with virtue.\nFor when one is initially small and few,\nthe heart does not dare assume greatness,\nand when one is finally great and many,\nthe heart still does not dare assume greatness—\nconsistently self-effacing,\nthus achieving true greatness.\n\nThe people’s pursuits often falter as they near completion.\nTo guard the end as the beginning,\nthen there will be no failed undertakings.\n\n*Further elaborating on the two instances of “end” above:*\nThough one may have deemed it difficult at the start,\nby the end, it is no longer difficult;\nthough one may have dared not claim greatness at the start,\nby the end, one assumes greatness—\nthen undertakings near completion often fail at the end.\nThus, one must guard the end as the beginning—\ndifficult at the start and difficult at the end,\nnot great at the start and not great at the end—\nthen there will be no failed undertakings.\n\nTo act is to court failure;\nto grasp is to court loss.\nWithout action, there is no failure;\nwithout grasping, there is no loss.\n\n*Further elaborating on the two instances of “failure” above:*\nThose who fix their hearts on doing will sometimes undo their success;\nthose who fix their hearts on holding will sometimes lose what they grasp.\nWithout doing, there is no success or failure;\nwithout grasping, there is no gain or loss.\n\nThus, the Sage desires without desiring,\ndoes not prize hard-to-obtain goods;\nlearns without learning,\nreverses the errors of the common folk,\nassisting the natural unfolding of all things\nwithout daring to act.",

*\"learn without learning.\"*\n\nAll these who do not desire learning\ndo so because the Way of all things is *wuwei* and unfolds naturally.\nThus, I too act with *wuwei* and align with the natural unity of all things,\nas spokes depend on the hub to form one.\n\nThe chapter begins with *\"wuwei\"* and ends with *\"natural without daring to act\"*—\nits meaning is consistent from start to finish.\n\n---\n**Chapter 54**\nThe ancients who excelled in the Dao did not enlighten the people;\nthey sought to make them ignorant instead.\nTo have knowledge is enlightenment;\nto lack knowledge is ignorance.\n\nThe ancients cultivated their own virtue to enlighten the people’s virtue,\nyet they also wished that those who were ignorant might progress to enlightenment.\nIt is not that they did not desire enlightenment for the people,\nbut that they could not make them know—\nnot that they wished them to remain ignorant.\n\nLaozi was born in a declining age.\nHe saw that in ancient times, governance was through *wuwei*,\nand the people were pure and simple, yet unknowing.\nIn later times, governance was through action,\nand the people became deceitful and knowing.\n\nThose who excel in the Dao transform the people into purity and simplicity,\nnot to make them knowing,\nbut to make them ignorant.\n\nThis is a critique of the times, correcting perversity—\nyet its excess led to Qin’s burning of the classics\nto keep the common people ignorant.\n\nThe difficulty of governing lies in their intelligence.\nThus, ruling with intelligence is a state’s ruin;\nruling without intelligence is a state’s blessing.\n\nThe reason the people are difficult to govern\nis that their knowledge is excessive—\nlaws are made, yet deceit arises;\norders are given, yet trickery follows.\n\nRuling with intelligence means governing with cunning and wisdom,\nforcing the people to also become intelligent—\nthen they become crafty and difficult to govern.\nRuling with intelligence is the state’s harm.\n\nRuling without intelligence means dimming one’s own brilliance to lead the people,\nso that they also become ignorant and simple—\nthen they are docile and easy to govern.\nRuling without intelligence is the state’s blessing.\n\nTo know these two methods is to grasp the standard.\nThe two methods are: ruling with intelligence and ruling without intelligence.\n*Kai* means to take as a model for imitation;\n*shi* means to place oneself in humility.\n\nFor one who rides in a carriage,\nto straighten the back and lean on the rail is to place oneself in high status,\nbut to bow the head and lean on the crossbar is to place oneself in humility.\n\nNot placing oneself in intelligence but in ignorance—\nthis is to be humble rather than exalted.\n\nTo know the standard and model is called *Xuande* (Mysterious Virtue).\nMysterious Virtue is profound, distant,\ncontrary to all things,\nyet reaches the utmost harmony.\n\nThose who know to imitate the Sage’s humility\npossess a mysterious and wondrous virtue—\nprofound and distant, beyond ordinary measure.\nThus, people cannot fathom it.\n\nAll desire intelligence, yet I alone desire ignorance—\nthis is contrary to all things.\nContrary means opposition;\nnot contrary means conformity.\n\nThough contrary, it is not disorder—\nit is the greatest conformity.\nThus, it is the profound, distant, unfathomable virtue.\n\n---\n**Chapter 55**\nThe reason rivers and seas can be sovereign over all streams\nis that they excel in descending.\nThus, they become sovereign over all streams.\n\nAll streams’ waters converge in rivers and seas,\njust as all under heaven’s people converge to one ruler.\nRivers and seas are low in elevation,\nable to descend to all waters,\nthus they receive all streams and become sovereign.\n\nThe ruler’s ability to encompass all under heaven’s people\nis likewise so.\n\nThus, the Sage desires to be above others\nby speaking humbly;\ndesires to lead others\nby placing himself behind.\n\nTo speak humbly is to lower and bend one’s words without arrogance.\nTo place oneself behind is to retreat without advancing.\n\nThis is the Sage’s supreme virtue of modesty and yielding—\nnot from a deliberate desire to be above or lead others.\nThe reader must not take the words to harm the meaning.\n\nThus, when in a high position, others do not find it burdensome;\nwhen in the forefront, others do not find it harmful.\n*Heavy* means difficult;\n*Harm* means calamity.\n\nThe Sage, after descending and retreating,\nwhen placed above others, is not found burdensome;\nwhen placed before others, is not found harmful.\nThus, all under heaven willingly promote him without exhaustion.\n\nBecause he does not contend,\nnone can contend with him.\nAll under heaven willingly acclaim him,\nyet he does not weary of being placed above or before others—\nfor his humility and retreat,\nno one can contend with him for supremacy or precedence.\nThus, the Sage attains position and timing,\nultimately achieving to be above and lead others.\n\nDong Zhongshu said:\n*\"Virtue descending makes form ascend;\nvirtue retreating makes form advance.\"*\n\nYang Xiong

seven generations,\nthe first of the three treasures.\nHere, we speak solely of *ci* as treasure—\nyet the other two are contained within it.\n\nThe compassionate are cherished by all as parents—\nwho would have a child attack their own parents?\nThus, to wage war or defend with *ci* is to ensure none dare oppose or assault,\nfor none can bear to harm what they hold dear.\nEven if enemies come to fight and attack,\nmany will aid as if defending their own kin—\nand victory and steadfastness shall follow.\nShould human strength fail, Heaven itself will aid,\npreventing defeat or rout.\nHeaven aids because they are shielded by *ci*.\n\nCao Cao and Fu Jian devoured without restraint—\ntheir lack of *ci* was extreme.\nThough Wu and Jin were not as saintly in their compassion,\nthey resisted invasion only when forced,\nyet compared to Cao and Fu, their actions were nearer to *ci*.\nAt the Red Cliffs, the wind and fire favored the south, destroying northern ships;\nat Qinggang, the wind

norm.\nThree armored soldiers rode each chariot—\none arching left, one spearing right,\nthe driver wielding flag and drum,\nall singing of strength and might.\nSeventy-two foot soldiers served beneath,\nand before battle, they were roused to fury,\nurged to rage and contend for victory.\n\nBut the compassionate do not prize such strength in warriors,\nnor rage in battle,\nnor await confrontation to triumph.\nNo blades are drawn—\nthe enemy yields on its own.\nThough my wisdom surpasses others,\nI appear unwise;\nthough I have ability,\nI appear inept.\nI place myself below,\nusing others’ wisdom as my own,\ntheir strength as my own.\nWithout martial fury, without rage, without confrontation,\nI triumph through non-contention,\nas Heaven triumphs without contending.\n\nTo serve below means\nnot relying on one’s own wisdom and strength,\nbut using others’ power to accomplish one’s ends—\nas Heaven acts without action yet achieves all.\nThus it is said: *harmonizing with Heaven*.\n\nOnly the most ancient sages reached such heights—\nhence, the ultimate of antiquity.\n\nThere is a saying of warfare:\n*\"I dare not be the aggressor but only the responder,\nI dare not advance an inch but retreat a foot.\"*\nThis is called:\n*having no march yet marching,*\n*having no arm yet warding,*\n*having no weapon yet conquering,*\n*having no enemy yet subduing.*\n\nAgain expounding the treasure of *ci*.\nThe phrase *\"I dare not\"* speaks to warfare.\nThose who wage war have said these words.\n\nTo be the aggressor is to initiate conflict against others.\nTo be the responder is to meet force only when compelled.\nTo advance an inch is difficult;\nto retreat a foot is easy.\n*Rén* (就) means to approach.\n\nThough one may be the aggressor, one is truly a responder;\nthough a responder, one does not wish to fight,\ndaring not to advance, preferring to retreat far.\nThe advancing warrior marshals his ranks and moves forward,\nbends his arm to wield his weapon,\nand presses onward to confront the enemy.\nIf he does not march, though he has ranks, it is as if he has none;\nif he does not bend his arm, though he has arms, it is as if he has none;\nif he does not wield his weapon, though he has weapons, it is as if he has none;\nif he does not confront, though enemies stand before him, it is as if they are none.\n*○* *Wúxíng* (无行) is pronounced *háng*.\n\nNo greater calamity than underestimating the enemy—\nunderestimating the enemy nearly forfeits our treasure.\nThus, when armies clash,\nthe compassionate prevail.\n\nMarching three armies into perilous battle,\none must tremble with fear,\ndaring not to underestimate the enemy.\nTo underestimate the enemy is to court battle lightly,\nuntil killing becomes inevitable and our *ci* is lost—\nno greater calamity exists.\n\nThough not yet engaged in battle,\nonce the heart harbors underestimation,\nthe seeds of killing and forfeiture are already sown—\nhence, *\"nearly

      "translated_text": "The one who dares to do evil is indeed what Heaven abhors, yet Heaven’s abhorrence is profound and inscrutable—how can one know for certain that he is truly the one Heaven abhors? Though such a person may be killed, the Sage still hesitates, not daring to kill lightly.\n\nThe Way of Heaven does not contend yet triumphs, does not speak yet responds, does not summon yet comes of its own accord—open and yet ever-conspiring. The heavenly net is vast, wide yet never misses.\n\nThe Sage does not kill lightly, yet evil-doers all escape—yet the net of Heaven is unbroken. Heaven’s judgment of evil men is not like man’s forceful contention, yet Heaven’s decree naturally overcomes them. It does not speak like man’s words, yet its response is swift as echo to sound. Its retribution comes not by summoning but spontaneously—great evil meets great retribution, and even with clever schemes, none can escape. Though Heaven acts without intent, open and simple, its retribution is subtle and beyond mortal contrivance.\n\nThe net of Heaven is vast, broad as if sparse yet not lax—yet it never misses a single one. Evil men cannot slip through, though the Sage does not kill them, Heaven itself does.\n\nIf the people do not fear death, how can you frighten them with death? If you could make the people always fear death, then those who act strangely, I could seize and kill—who would dare? \"Strange\" means unorthodox. If you make the common people always harbor fear of death, then those who act strangely and wickedly, I could seize and kill them—then all would know to fear, and who would dare to do evil?\n\nYet even if you kill evil men, those who dare to do evil will not cease—then it is clear the people are ignorant and do not fear death. Though evil men must face punishment and death, they still fear no one above—how can you frighten them with death and yet kill them lightly? There are always those who execute.\n\nIf one substitutes for the executioner to kill, it is like substituting for the master carpenter to hew. If one substitutes for the master carpenter to hew, few will avoid injury to their hands. If you do not frighten men with death, can evil-doers be left unkilled? It is said: there are those who execute. Those who execute are Heaven. Only Heaven can kill men, only the master carpenter can hew wood. If men seek to substitute for Heaven in killing, it is like substituting for the carpenter in hewing. Those who substitute in hewing will surely injure their hands—so too, those who substitute in killing will surely harm themselves.\n\nWithout human calamity, there must be Heaven’s punishment.\n\n---\n**Chapter 61 (in all, five sections):**\nThe first section speaks of the proper use of punishment, which cannot be fully followed—it reflects excessive pity and leniency.\nThe second section speaks of Heaven’s inscrutability and the caution against killing lightly.\nThe third section shows how Heaven can act as the executioner to teach.\nThe fourth section argues that the people cannot be coerced by fear and thus killing should not be light.\nThe fifth section warns against men presuming to substitute for Heaven in killing—great indeed is Laozi’s compassion.\n\nThe people’s hunger comes from their rulers’ excessive taxation—thus they hunger. \"Food\" refers to what the ruler takes from the people. \"Tax\" refers to what the people give to supply the ruler’s needs. If the ruler takes much from the people, the people will be hungry and poor.\n\nThe people are difficult to govern because their rulers act—thus they are difficult to govern. If the ruler acts with schemes and cunning to control the people, the people in turn will deceive the ruler with deceit—thus they are difficult to govern.\n\nMen grow careless of death because they cling too much to life—thus they grow careless of death. Only those who do not cling to life are superior to those who prize it. \"Light\" means easy. \"Clinging to life\" means the heart is too set on living. \"Superior\" means surpassing. \"Prizing life\" is the same as clinging to life. If the heart is too set on living, if one over-preserves life, one may seek not to die yet instead make death easy.\n\nThe Perfect Man does not not love life—he follows its natural course, harbors no scheming heart, as if he does not cling to life. Yet he transcends his body while his body remains, surpassing those who labor their hearts to prize life and instead make death easy.\n\n---\n**Chapter 62:**\nMan’s life is soft and weak, yet his death is hard and strong.\nGrass and trees in life are soft and brittle, yet in death they wither and harden.\nIn life, man’s flesh is soft and pliable, his movements flexible and yielding; in death, he grows cold and rigid, stiff and unyielding. Grass and trees in life are soft and brittle, yet in death they wither and harden—thus speaking of man extends to grass and trees.\n\nTherefore, the hard and strong belong to death, the soft and weak belong to life.\nFrom the earlier text, man and grass and trees are soft in life yet hard in death—by this principle of things, one knows that in virtue and conduct, the hard and strong do not attain death, for they are of death’s kind, while the soft and weak preserve life, for they are of life’s kind.\n\nThus, strong armies do not conquer, strong trees are split.\nIn warfare, the weak demonstrate deep strategy and skill—the enemy, underestimating them, grows careless, and thus they win. Those who rely on strength are shallow in thought and arrogant—the enemy, fearing them, prepares against them, and thus they do not win.\n\nThe art of war begins like a maiden—showing weakness to the enemy by appearing open and vulnerable; later it flees like a hare—the enemy, unable to resist, is overcome. The Qin army passed through Zhou, their chariots leaping three hundred feet high, yet they were defeated at Zhaoyao. The Qi army invaded Jin, their soldiers hurling stones, yet they were defeated at [illegible].\n\nThis proves that relying on strength does not bring victory. \"Split\" means to be grasped by both hands. The weak, swaying branches are the small twigs near the ends, while the strong, unyielding ones are the great trunks near the roots—thus speaking of war extends to trees.\n\nTherefore, the hard and strong are lowly, the soft and weak are exalted. From the earlier text, strong armies are overcome by others—that is to be lowly, unable to rise like those who conquer. Strong trees are the trunks near the roots—that is to be lowly, unable to rise like the small branches.",

      "translated_text": "From this principle of nature, one understands that in human virtue and conduct, those who are firm and strong are proud of themselves and domineer over others, yet they will inevitably stumble and lose their exalted status, descending to a position beneath others. Those who are soft and weak, however, are revered and honored by all, thus attaining a position above others.\n\n---\n**Chapter 63: The Way of Heaven**\nIs it not like the drawing of a bow?\nThe high are lowered, the low are raised;\nThe excessive are diminished, the insufficient are supplemented.\nThe first two lines speak of drawing a bow, the latter two of the Way of Heaven.\n\nWhen a bow is slackened, its upper curve droops downward, its lower curve rises upward. When drawn taut, its upper curve lifts upward, its lower curve presses downward. Thus, the high (upper curve) is pressed down to the low, and the low (lower curve) is raised to the high. Heaven’s diminishing of excess is like pressing down the upper curve to lower it, and its supplementing of deficiency is like raising the lower curve to elevate it. The Way of Heaven diminishes excess and supplements deficiency.\n\nBut the Way of humanity is otherwise: it diminishes the deficient to serve the excessive.\nHeaven’s Way takes from the full to benefit the humble, while humanity takes from the few to benefit the many, devours the small to benefit the great, seizes the poor to benefit the rich—this is how it defies the Way of Heaven.\n\nWho then can use their excess to nourish the world?\nOnly the Daoist.\n\nThe Daoist ruler, though noble as the Son of Heaven and wealthy with the Four Seas, does not claim ownership of his nobility or riches. He eats coarse food, wears rough garments, lives in humble dwellings, and spares no effort to conserve resources for the people, never wasting. He regulates the fields and teaches cultivation, lightens taxes, ensuring that families are well-provided and people are content. Thus, he uses his own excess to nourish the world.\n\nTherefore, the Sage acts without relying on it, achieves without claiming it. Does he not wish to display his virtue?\nThe Sage’s abilities cover the world—this is excess. Yet he does not rely on his abilities as if they were his own, nor does he claim his accomplishments as if they were his own, nor does he wish to show his virtue as superior to others. All these are ways of diminishing his own excess.\n\n---\n**Chapter 64: The Soft and Weak Overcome the Hard and Strong**\nNothing in the world is as soft and weak as water, yet nothing surpasses it in attacking the hard and strong. This is because there is nothing to replace it.\nThough gold and stone are the hardest and strongest, grinding them still requires water. Thus, water is the foremost in attacking the hard and strong, and none can surpass it. Even if one wished to substitute another, there is no alternative.\n\nThe soft overcomes the hard, the weak overcomes the strong—all know this, yet none can practice it.\nWater is the most soft and weak, yet it can erode the hardest stone. This is how the soft and weak overcome the hard and strong.\nThough all know this, none can act in accordance with softness and weakness—it is deceptive.\n\nThus, the Sage says:\n*\"To bear a state’s filth is to be its guardian;\nTo bear a state’s misfortunes is to be its king.\"*\nFilth refers to impurity.\nMisfortune refers to what is unlucky and unvirtuous.\nImpurity and misfortune are what people despise and hold in contempt, yet the Sage does not shun them. Even if an entire state heaps such shame upon him, he accepts it without complaint. For he is soft and weak, willingly enduring humiliation to avoid domination like the hard and strong who seek to exalt themselves over others. Yet the spirits are pleased and he can be the guardian of the state, while the people turn to him and he can rule the world.\n\nThe hard and strong provoke divine wrath and popular rebellion, losing their state and their world. The soft and weak receive divine favor and popular allegiance, gaining their state and their world.\nThis is the effect of the soft and weak overcoming the hard and strong.\n\n---\n**Chapter 65: Straight Speech Seems Paradoxical**\nLaozi takes \"reversal\" as the movement of the Dao and the mystery of virtue, so even when speaking straightforwardly, it often seems contrary to the straightforward.\n\nStraightforward yet seeming reversed—like being bright yet appearing dim, advancing yet seeming to retreat, being upright yet seeming crooked, being skillful yet seeming clumsy—all follow this pattern. For what appears dim is the means to brightness, what appears to retreat is the means to advance, what appears crooked is the means to straightness, what appears clumsy is the means to skill, and what appears reversed is the means to the straight.\n\nThe following text states: *\"To reconcile deep grudges, one must have excess grudges—how then can it be considered good?\"*\nReconcile means to pacify.\nGrudge refers to resentment toward another.\nDeep grudge means the resentment is profound.\nExcess grudge means the resentment lingers unresolved within, like when the Master acted for the Duke of Wei—this is akin to aiding.\nGood refers to the virtuous person.\n\nWhen two parties hold grudges, they must be reconciled to resolve them. Two virtuous people naturally have no grudges, so why reconcile? Two wicked people, if they hold grudges, will either exhaust their evil and destroy each other, or one will triumph while the other is defeated, or both will be harmed. An outsider may merely observe in silence.\n\nOnly when a virtuous person, through misfortune, holds a grudge against a wicked one does the situation arise. Though the virtuous person is forgiving and has no ill will, the wicked one is vengeful and will surely act against the virtuous. If the wicked one retaliates, the virtuous will suffer.\n\nThus, those who sincerely wish to aid the virtuous must reconcile the grudge, easing the resentment and releasing the hatred, intending to benefit the virtuous. Yet by blocking the wicked one’s vengeful heart, preventing its fulfillment, the unresolved resentment lingers within. Though it may seem reconciled today, it will erupt violently later. How then can such reconciliation truly benefit the virtuous?",

The weak, swaying branches are the small twigs near the ends, while the strong, unyielding ones are the great trunks near the roots—thus speaking of war extends to trees.\n\nTherefore, the hard and strong are lowly, the soft and weak are exalted. From the earlier text, strong armies are overcome by others—that is to be lowly, unable to rise like those who conquer. Strong trees are the trunks near the roots—that is to be lowly, unable to rise like the small branches.",

      "translated_text": "The Sage holds the left contract and does not demand repayment from others. To hold the left contract and not demand repayment is to act without scheming against things.\n\nA *contract* (契) is a wooden tally split in two, each party keeping one half as a pledge of trust. To *demand repayment* (责) means to claim goods or debts from another. The contract has left and right halves: the left is kept by the owner of the goods, while the right is given to the one who comes to claim them. The *Records of the Grand Historian* (《史记》) states that the right contract is used to demand repayment, and the *Book of Rites* (《礼记》) says that those offering land or houses hold the right contract—thus, the left contract is the proof held by the one who receives repayment.\n\nTo hold the left contract means one does not demand repayment from others but waits for others to demand from oneself. If someone comes with the right contract to claim, one gives it without calculating whether the person is virtuous or wicked.\n\nThose who reconcile grudges act with intent to aid the virtuous, whereas the Sage acts without scheming, like one who holds the left contract and does not demand repayment—calmly observing things and letting them unfold naturally.\n\nThe virtuous manage contracts; the unvirtuous manage *simplicity* (彻). The virtuous act without scheming; the unvirtuous act with scheming. *Simplicity* (彻) means *universal harmony* (通).\n\nIn ancient times, the *assistance law* (助法) divided a well-field into nine sections: eight families each received one private section, while one section was public land, farmed collectively by the eight families. Each family’s private yield of a hundred *mu* could feed nine, eight, seven, six, or as few as five, depending on their strength and labor.\n\nThe Zhou dynasty replaced this with the *simplicity law* (彻法), fearing the private yields were uneven. Thus, the eight families’ private fields were also farmed collectively, ensuring equal distribution—no more excess or deficiency. Those who hold the left contract allow others to take without scheming, hence it is said the virtuous manage *simplicity*. Law arises from fear of inequality, scheming over fairness, hence it is said the unvirtuous manage it.\n\nThose who reconcile grudges fear the virtuous will suffer, acting with intent to aid them—like the unvirtuous managing *simplicity* for the weakest family, fearing their share will be meager.\n\nThe Dao of Heaven favors none; it always aids the virtuous. *With* (与) here means *acts for*. The Sage, without scheming for the virtuous, yet Heaven acts for them, ensuring the wicked cannot act with malice.\n\nEarlier, it was said the Sage does not use punishment, yet Heaven slays the wicked. Here, it is said the Sage does not reconcile grudges, yet Heaven aids the virtuous. The Way of Laozi is *wuwei*—natural and entrusted to Heaven.\n\nYet Heaven’s destruction of the wicked and aid to the virtuous—how can it compare to human scheming? The wicked must meet calamity; the virtuous must receive blessing. Such is the natural order.\n\n---\n**Chapter Sixty-Six**\n\nIn small states with few people,\nLet the people have ten- or hundred-fold implements but not use them,\nLet the people value death but not flee far away.\n\n*Ten* (什) is ten people; *hundred* (伯) is a hundred. *Ten- or hundred-fold implements* are heavy, large tools, shared by all. *Not use* means not to labor for them, not to covet them—thus, heavy tools have no purpose.\n\n*Value death* means to regard death as a grave matter and cherish life. *Not flee far away* means to be born here and die here, not wandering elsewhere.\n\nLaozi sought to reverse the decline of the Zhou, restoring the simplicity of antiquity. Large states mean many people, difficult to govern; thus, he advocated small states with few people, ensuring the people do not covet the outside and are self-sufficient within.\n\nThough there are boats and carriages, there is no need to ride them;\nThough there are armor and weapons, there is no need to display them.",
