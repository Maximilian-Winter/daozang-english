  "full_translation": "**Yellow Court Inner Vision Jade Classic Commentary**\n*Attributed to the Immortal Liu Changsheng*\n\n**First Chapter: Upper Clarity (Shang Qing)**\n\nBefore the Purple Clouds of the Upper Clarity,\nAbove the Nine Heavens, a scene unlike any other—\nAbove, the Three Pure Ones; within, the Jade Emperor.\nThe Most High Dao’s Jade Dawn Lord,\nAscending beyond measure, entering sainthood,\nA body beyond the body, where seas turn to mulberry fields,\nHis jade visage ever renewed.\n\nIn leisure, he crafts elixir pearls in seven-character verses—\nRich within the elixir pearl, gold flies from the elbow,\nPalace gates reversed, beyond the world, his pure chanting.\nDispersing and transforming the Five Forms, manifesting myriad deities—\n*Jia-Yi-Geng-Xin, Bing-Ding-Ren-Gui*—\nA thousand transformations, divine powers manifest,\nThe Five Forms gathering in assembly.\n\nThis is the *Yellow Court Inner Vision’s* daily scripture.\n\nThe Yellow Court’s Inner Vision gathers all the immortals,\nPenetrating the wondrous sea of laws, chanting ten thousand verses.\nThe heart-strings plucked thrice, the dancing embryo-immortal—\nThe heart’s lute played within, its melody piercing the Azure Expanse,\nThe embryo-immortal dances forth, its radiance resplendent and clear.\n\nThe Nine Qi shine brightly, emerging from the Celestial Gate—\nThe Nine Yangs return and circulate, the Seven Reversals harmonize the spirit,\nNight-brightness manifests, startling gods and spirits.\n\nThe Divine Boy is born beneath a crimson canopy,\nPurple mist and crimson light weave into a flowery canopy,\nDivine powers drift like illusions, yet the form remains unbroken.\nThis is the *Jade Scripture*, worthy of profound study.\n\nWhen all scriptures are exhausted and the Jade Precepts mastered,\nThe natural Dao’s virtue and true power are realized.\nTo chant ten thousand times is to ascend to the Three Heavens—\nFrom the Void emerges chanting, the pivot of ten thousand transformations,\nDrawing the deluded across the Ten Directions and Three Realms.\n\nA thousand calamities dissolve, a hundred ailments heal—\nA single thought without birth, all defilements vanish,\nNature penetrates the boundless, attaining the Void.\nUnafraid of tigers and wolves’ ferocity—\nMeeting the Sage without ghosts or spirits, embracing the Dao and forgetting form,\nTigers and wolves retreat, beasts grow long-lived.\nThus, old age is repelled, and life is eternally prolonged.\nThough the outer form ages and has an end,\nLongevity knows no bounds.\n\n---\n\n**Second Chapter: The Upper Realm**\n\nAbove, the soul’s spirit at the Lower Elbow;\nThe Earth Lock is sealed, the Heavenly Gate ever open,\nThe soul is pure, the qi exhilarated, the spiritual embryo formed.\nTo the left, the Minor Yang; to the right, the Major Yin—\nGazing left at the *Jia*-Dragon, right at the *Geng*-Tiger,\nTheir copulation comes and goes, naturally attaining true delight.\nBehind, the Secret Door; before, the Birth Gate—\nBehind, gold is hidden; before, jade is concealed,\nFrom the Void emerges the One, wondrously harmonizing the Six.\nBreathing in with the sun, exhaling with the moon.\n\nYang descends, Yin ascends—\nFire emerges, water enters,\nReversed and inverted, first attaining the other.\nWhere the Original Qi converges, the starry hosts are divided—\nHeaven and Earth unite, their wondrous use harmonizing,\nHeaven’s clarity shines, ten thousand phenomena manifest.\nPurple mist ascends and descends, the Three Subtle Clouds.\n\nObserving the auspicious clouds, the purple mist covers the crown—\nA realm beyond saints.\nIrrigating the Five Flowers to plant the spiritual root—\nJade dew nourishes jade sprouts, silently gathering white snow,\nThe toad lacks no moon.\nThe Seven Liquids flow through the Cavernous Gate—\nThe Black Tortoise’s golden grain, the Vermilion Bird’s jade nectar,\nOffered to the Heavenly Sovereign.\nReturning to the Purple, embracing the Yellow, entering the Elixir Field—\nPurple mist curls, wondrous wisdom greets it, the spirit refreshed.\nThe Inner Chamber’s light shines upon the Yang Gate.\nTo illuminate the divine chamber, within revealing the Yang Gate,\nThe Western Bundle gathers, beyond the world’s Heaven and Earth.\n\n---\n\n**Third Chapter: The Mouth**\n\nThe mouth is the Jade Pool, the Grand Harmony Official—\nThe jade cup holds elixir, savoring its taste with refined delight,\nSwallowed past the Nine Palaces, only then meeting the True Person.\nRinsing and swallowing the spirit’s essence, disasters cannot touch—\nFrequent draughts of jade nectar, the Nine Nines intertwine,\nEmerging in rainbow hues, beyond Heaven and Earth’s embrace.\nThe body generates light and fragrance like orchids—\nThe spirit’s platform opens wide, the treasure pearl gleams,\nSeeking lead and mercury, attaining sagehood.\nDispelling a hundred evils, the jade glaze brightens the face—\nIn stillness and non-action, the heart like frost and snow,\nRound and radiant in the sky, square and luminous below.\nIf one can truly cultivate, they ascend to Broad Cold—\nOn Kunlun’s peak, only the pure cold remains,\nA single pearl of light, the Dao’s radiance.\nDay and night without sleep, one attains true transformation—\nYin exhausted, Yang pure, no slumber, no dreams,\nThe body like empty space, lead and mercury perfected.\nThunder roars, lightning flashes, the spirit merges—\nA single clap of thunder, Heaven and Earth harmonize,\nThe ultimate spirit manifests, beyond all things.\n\n---\n\n**Fourth Chapter: The Yellow Court**\n\nWithin the Yellow Court, the Inner Person wears brocade robes,\nThe Central Child in scarlet, his body adorned with six *qian* weights,\nAccompanied by wind and moon, neighboring

the clouded waist.\nCrimson and verdant, green vines with spirit branches—\nLotus blossoms wrapped in chrysanthemums, wind swaying golden threads,\nWithin the treasure vase, another branch emerges.\nSeven jade locks close the twin gates—\nWithin the Seven Star Official, the golden doors are always sealed,\nOn the treasure flower platform, no form or bearing remains.\nDouble doors and

essence is refined—\nThe steady bow and wooden ox plow through the Three Fields,\nTimely nourishment flows, jade herbs sprout with spirit.\nA graceful maiden hides beneath the celestial glow—\nThe Moon Maiden embraces the sun, the flying crow wraps in light,\nTheir radiance dazzling, forming the Original Beginning.\nThe Double Hall shines with the Eight Auspicious—\nMoonlight on the tower, the Double Hall’s nature as a torch,\nWithin and without, all is illuminated, the Eight Immortals enjoy blessings.\nThe Heavenly Court and Earthly Locks display fresh axes—\nEmbracing the One, a mighty weapon,\nRepelling outer demons, the protective deities strike,\nThe wise axe ever cleaves.\nThe Spirit Platform’s firm foundation never decays—\nThe Vermilion Official’s child presents the divine pearl,\nLight generates ten thousand rays, dazzling the void.\n\n---\n**Fifth Chapter: The Central Pool**\n\nWithin the Central Pool, the spirit wears crimson pearls,\n\nWithin the Central Pool, the

with flying talismans.\n\nThe Crosscurrent Basin, three *cun* deep, houses the sacred essence—\nIt drains the West River dry, threefold flames of crimson,\nRevealing the true spirit, the boundless void of Heaven.\n\nHidden mushrooms grow luxuriant, supporting one another.\nWithin, the spirit-mushroom is sought,\nGrinding open the treasure-mirror, white lotuses rise from water,\nTheir fragrance pure, their leaves fresh and green.\n\n---\n**Chapter Six: The Celestial Peak**\n\nThe Celestial Peak’s summit, meticulously cultivated,\nA thousand peaks of marvelous splendor,\nTen thousand pines

immortals.\n\nThe divine brow bears the华盖 (*huàgài*) covering the bright pearl—\nAuspicious mists arise, transforming into a treasure-canopy,\nRolling forth divine pearls, the inner sea of law revealed.\n\nThe Nine Abysses: sun and moon pierce the void, no trace remains,\nWithin the Nine Yang Officials, birds and rabbits intermingle their light,\nThe divine mechanism shifts endlessly—\nHeaven and Earth cannot measure its depths.\n\nIn this abode dwells the True Constant, clad in crimson,\nEight domains as neighbors, the True Constant’s nature in the void,\nShedding cloud-garments, its radiance blazes forth.\nThose who discern it suffer no ill fate.\n\nCrimson mists shine bright—\nAll maladies vanish, its nature like autumn’s moon,\nIts form as boundless as the void.\n\nThe crimson pearl’s sacred cluster gathers radiant emotions—\nPearl-light erupts, flames like flying stars,\nEver nourishing mushrooms and grasses, flowers and jade taking shape.\n\nBeneath the tongue lies the *Xuānyīng* (*xuānyīng*), the shore of life and death.\n\nOn the tower, immortal robes—\nMerits soar, the body adorned, transformed through many forms,\nTo refine the infant and the
