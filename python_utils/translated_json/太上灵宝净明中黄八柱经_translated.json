The All-Encompassing\n\n---\n\n### *The Supreme Numinous Treasure Scripture of Clarity and Radiance: The Central Yellow and Eight Pillars*\n\n#### **Chapter One: The Dao of the Central Yellow**\nAt birth, humans receive correctness and are entrusted with harmony to live.\nThey contain the qi of pure unity and preserve the primordial perfection of the original.\nWhen yin and yang harmonize, illness and affliction do not arise.\nWhen the bodily form is firm, the cinnabar elixir’s origin may be guarded.\nNot depleting the original qi, one attains great wholeness.\n\nThus, the Dao of the Central Yellow takes correctness as its root.\nThose who know the root neither deviate nor incline, neither stray nor lean.\nThey govern above and below, grasp the four directions, and comprehend both *where* and *how* it abides.\nKnowing *where* it abides, they do not lose their orientation.\nComprehending *how* it abides, they do not forsake their contemplation.\nDiscerning orientation and knowing contemplation—this is called the correct Dao.\n\nThose deeply versed in the Dao can achieve this; those not deeply versed forget the root and pursue the branches, failing to return to the central correctness, and thus the Dao of the Central Yellow is lost.\n\n\"Central\" denotes its position; \"yellow\" denotes its color.\nKnowing the position without losing it, recognizing the color without fixation.\nNeither position nor color—attaining what is to be attained.\n\nNow, the qi of the Yellow Heaven spans the chest and diaphragm, illuminating its original truth, neither deluded nor erring—this is called *trust*.\nWhat is *utmost trust*? Trust resides within it, in the Palace of the Yellow Bell.\nWhere the central qi manifests, the harvests of the year are abundant.\nHumans who live thus may guard the One.\nHaving cultivated guarding the One, the Eight Pillars are established.\nThe Eight Pillars established, the golden elixir blazes resplendent.\nAfter three thousand merits are perfected, one steps into the void and ascends the earth.\n\n#### **Chapter Two: The Splendor of the Yellow Court**\nWhen the primordial chaos splits open, the principles of the divine continent become clear.\nWhen the bodily form is born, the functions of the five organs become manifest.\nHeaven and Earth stand; Qian and Kun are completed.\nLike the construction of a beehive or the formation of an anthill’s mound,\nBeyond Qian and Kun, there are also Qian and Kun.\nWithin the Six Directions, are there not also Six Directions?\n\nOnly the principles of Qian and Kun, the meanings of the Six Directions—\nSeek them within the body, and within this single body, Heaven and Earth are already positioned.\nThus, the Azure Flower Capital is the true palace of the liver.\nThe Crimson Brilliance Mansion is the true chamber of the heart.\nThe Luminous White Splendor is the true position of the lungs.\nThe Mysterious Black Prefecture is the true tower of the kidneys.\nThe spleen resides at the center, named the Yellow Court.\n\nIts house is of gold, its gates of jade.\nThe jade gates gleam like valleys, their color like steamed millet.\nThere is a true person, clad in golden-threaded robes,\nSeated like a child upon a golden lotus, named *Rui Zhu* (\"Jewel Bud\"), styled *Yao Xian* (\"Jade Immortal\").\nThose who recognize his face may be made coeval with Heaven.\nGuarding his palace and chambers, contemplating him always—thus one enters the profound mystery.\n\n#### **Chapter Three: The Four Hollows Emptied**\nThe eyes are the hollow of spirit-light.\nThe ears are the hollow of harmonious sound.\nThe mouth is the hollow of numinous springs.\nThe nose is the hollow of true fragrance.\n\nThose who know the Dao of the Central Yellow ensure that:\nThe eyes see nothing improper, and spirit-light shines brightly;\nThe ears hear nothing improper, and harmonious sounds resonate deeply;\nThe mouth consumes no reckless food, and the numinous spring remains clear;\nThe nose smells no reckless scents, and true fragrance is naturally fragrant.\n\nWhen evil desires do not arise, the correct qi is luminous—\nThis luminous correct qi is called *emptiness and tranquility*.\nEmptiness and tranquility are like a bellows:\nThey may ascend or descend, and the correct qi intermingles without obstruction within.\nThe central gate is vast and boundless, open and expansive.\nNot flowing into recklessness—this is true action.\nSince it is called *true*, one may attain the Dao.\nThe Dao is not sought elsewhere; it originally resides within one’s own body.\nThe Four Hollows not emptied—this is why the Dao is lost.\nEmptiness as function, the central gate harmoniously merged.\nLight illumines inwardly, emerging in perfect stability.\n\nLike a great chamber with four high, bright windows,\nDwelling within it, one may be called *clear and bright*.\nThus, rectifying the Central Yellow—the Central Yellow is the Four Hollows emptied.\n\n#### **Chapter Four: The Two Portals Sealed**\nThe Two Portals are the gateways through which qi and essence leak.\nThat humans die young or age prematurely is because:\nThe front portal injures essence, the rear portal injures qi.\nEssence injured and not secure leads to reckless indulgence—this is called the *flooding portal*.\nQi lost and easily depleted leads to reckless dissipation—this is called the *thieving portal*.\n\nThose who skillfully nurture essence and qi:\nEssence arises from thought—thought originates in the spleen; thus, cut off thought.\nQi arises from food—food originates in the spleen; thus, cut off food.\nCutting off thought, true essence is internally secure, not swayed by lust.\nCutting off food, true qi is internally whole, not scattered by fine flavors.\n\nComprehending the correct principles of the Two Portals, the Central Field is secure and nourished.\nThe Central Field secure—this is the means to longevity.\nThus, rectifying the Central Yellow necessarily seals the Two Portals.\n\n#### **Chapter Five: The Two Caverns Opened**\nThe Two Caverns are the true positions of the spirit palace,\nThe root-source of immortal medicines, the pathways of qi and fluids.\nThe crown is the Cavern of Heavenly Numen—opening it makes it the gateway for qi’s entry and exit.\nThe upper palate is the Cavern of Jade Spirit—opening it makes it the key to the entry and exit of essence-fluid.\n\nThose who master the Central Yellow:\nHaving emptied the Four Hollows, external perversities do not invade.\nHaving sealed the Two Portals, internal correctness does not dissipate—thus, no thought and fasting.\nRaising qi upward, auspicious clouds enter and exit through the gate of Heavenly Numen—one may fly the spirit.\nDrawing fluid to rinse and swallow, numinous liquid flows from the spring of Jade Spirit—one may irrigate the elixir fields.\n\n**Golden Crucible Here, Auspicious Grain Takes Root**\nHere the Golden Crucible stands, and fine grain plants its goodness.\nAttaining the Central Yellow’s method for opening the caverns—only then is one named among the Great Array of Immortals.\nTo grasp its essentials, to know its essentials, is the root of attaining the Dao.\n\n**Erecting the Eight Pillars, Chapter Six**\nThe body is the dwelling of the spirit.\nSpoken of in terms of form, it is called the “brow-and-forehead abode.”\nSpoken of in terms of qi, it is called the “qi abode.”\nSpoken of in terms of nature, it is called the “abode of Supreme Stability.”\nThus, the body is the dwelling where the spirit resides.\nFor the spirit’s dwelling to endure, nothing surpasses erecting pillars.\nPillars are the masters of a house.\nPrimordial qi is the foundation stone.\nWith primordial qi as the foundation, the Eight Pillars stand.\n\nWhat are the Eight Pillars?\nEmptying the Four Hollows is called the “Pillars of Fivefold Clarity.”\nSealing the Two Portals is called the “Two Poles.”\nOpening the Two Caverns is called the “Supporting Beams.”\nWith primordial qi as the base and spirit-essence as the roof, one may then dwell within.\nTo settle one’s nature, to preserve one’s Dao.\nThe Dao is vast, without limit.\nNeither sinking nor floating, attaining one’s dwelling, knowing one’s arising.\nKnowing one’s stability, fitting one’s ease, rectifying one’s rectitude—thus the Way of Guest and Host is established.\nThe Guest is like lead and mercury; the Host is like heart and kidneys.\nWhen heart and kidneys are rectified, lead and mercury are born—only then can one stabilize the Golden Crucible and perform the Great Simmering.\n\nThus, the adept takes the body as a secure dwelling and sees, hears, feels, and knows as wind and rain.\nErecting the Eight Pillars, stabilizing the walls—then the harm of wind and rain vanishes.\nTherefore, first recognize the Dao, next clarify its signs.\nEstablish the foundation, fix the directions—like a king building a state.\nFacing south, back to the north, responding to clarity and governing—this is the Dao.\n\n**Rectifying Position, Chapter Seven**\nThe Dao accords with the true center.\nAttaining the Dao of the true center, one is simply open and clear.\nWhat is “open and clear”? Like choosing a dwelling:\nEach settles in its place, fitting front hall and rear chamber.\nEach suits its position—Green Dragon to the left, White Tiger to the right, Vermilion Bird in front, Dark Warrior behind—each guards its direction.\nThereupon, arrange the Eight Trigrams, fix the Three Fields, know ascent and descent, examine the seasonal nodes, and clarify the natural.\nYet I, though not enlightened, am enlightened by enlightenment itself.\nThough I do not defile, defilement brings no clarity.\nClarity is supreme—supreme clarity is undefiled.\nDefiled things cannot attain it; defilement comes from it.\nRecognize the true fruit, preserve the true and authentic, transcend the true path, emerge on the true way.\nSupremely harmonious, perfectly round, serene and unmoving.\nThis is called the root of rectifying position, the place of recognizing the crucible.\nHaving recognized the crucible’s place, the Returned Elixir may be obtained.\n\n**Rectifying Nature, Chapter Eight**\nThere is true nature, there is deluded nature—nature is fundamentally one.\nNever were there two; guard the one, cast off the two, and attain true nature.\nWhen nature is true, it does not lose its rectitude.\nRectified yet not rigid—what need is there for rectification?\nRectitude is rectitude.\nRectifying what is not rectified, the unrectified becomes rectified.\nFollowing what is rectified, uniting with the true and authentic—this is called true nature.\nNature is naturally tranquil and harmonious; through harmony it communicates.\nThrough communication it penetrates; through penetration it is clear.\nThe clarity of clear nature—this is called true nature.\n\n**Profound Embrace, Chapter Nine**\nThe Central Yellow is not established by intention—only through profound embrace is it known.\nThe Central Yellow’s Eight Pillars are not the product of refined thought—only through the Central Yellow do the Eight Pillars exist.\nPillars stand and the dwelling is complete; the foundation is firm and the pillars are stable.\nExtending profound embrace, the principle of Heaven and Earth is attained.\nThe principle of Heaven and Earth attained, one stands in the true center.\nThus, without knowing the Central Yellow, one cannot speak of being human.\nThe fat or leanness of a single meal—this too is the Central Yellow.\nThe cutting off of a single entanglement of right and wrong—this too is the Central Yellow.\nKnowing the Central Yellow, the Great Dao is manifest.\n\n**The Supreme Numinous Treasure’s *Pure Clarity Central Yellow Eight Pillars Scripture* concludes.**",
