  "full_translation": "*The Expanded Record of the Yellow Emperor’s Original Conduct*\n\n**Title:** *The Expanded Record of the Yellow Emperor’s Original Conduct*. One scroll. Composed by Wang Quan of the Tang dynasty. Based on the text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, \"Biographies and Records\" section of the *Dongzhen* division.\n\n**Cultivating the Dao and Virtue**\nAfter the world was well-governed and all things were in order, the Yellow Emperor sought the true, visited recluses, inquired into the Dao, and pursued immortality, hoping to attain longevity and enduring vision—what is called \"ascending to transcendence after ordering the age.\"\n\nAt that time, there was Yu Fengzi, who served as the Pottery Master. A divine person passed by and tended the fire for him, able to emerge and enter within five-colored smoke. After a long while, he taught this to Fengzi. Fengzi accumulated fire and burned himself, rising and descending with the smoke and qi. One day, he flew away, journeyed to the Flowing Sands, ate flying fish, and temporarily died. After two hundred years, he revived.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor studied his Dao and traveled with Fengzi to Lantian Sands, with Feng Hou carrying books and Chang Bo bearing a sword. Each day, they went to the Hun River, and by evening returned to Pu and Jin, covering ten thousand *li* in a single breath. The Hun River was like drifting sand; stepping upon it caused one to sink, its depth unfathomable. Great winds blew the sand like mist, and within the mist were many divine dragons, fish, and giant turtles, all capable of flight. There was a stone indigo, blue-green in color, hard yet very light, drifting with the wind and covering the flowing sands. One stem bore a hundred leaves, blooming once every thousand years. Thus, Yu Feng’s *Roaming the Sea* poem says:\n*\"The blue-green indigo glows for a thousand years unfurled,*\n*A hundred lifetimes briefly die to feed on flying fish.\"*\n\nThere was Wuguangzi, eight *chi* and seven *cun* tall, a divine immortal. From the time of the Yellow Emperor to the Xia dynasty, he often wandered among the people, consuming herbs to nurture his nature and delighting in playing the zither for self-amusement. There was Chijiang Ziyu, who did not eat the five grains but fed on the flowers of a hundred plants to prolong his years. By the time of Yao, he served as the Wood Minister, able to ascend and descend with the wind and rain, having lived for two thousand years already.\n\nThere was Master Rongcheng, skilled in the arts of supplementation and guiding, preserving life and nurturing qi, so that the spirit of the valley never died. He could restore white hair to black and regrow fallen teeth. The Emperor admired his Dao and thus constructed the Five Cities and Twelve Towers to await divine persons. He then sought the Dao, traveling to Mount Hua and Mount Shou, and bound them to Mount Tai. At times, he summoned strange creatures to commune with the divine, meeting immortals at Penglai. Returning, he received the myriad spirits at the Bright Court in the capital, at the Cold Gate of Mount Shen in the Gansu Valley, north of Chang’an in Yunyang.\n\nThereupon, the Yellow Emperor performed the suburban sacrifice to Heaven on the Circular Mound, seeking the supreme Dao. He became a disciple of Jiu Yuanzi. In the first year of the Earth Sovereign’s reign, on the first *yin* day of the first month, he fasted at Mount Shou in He Dong’s Puji. He then traveled extensively to seek the Dao. He was about to meet Tai Yuan on Mount Jucí, with Fang Ming as his charioteer, Chang Yu as his outrider, Zhang Ruo and Zhu Xu leading the procession (the pronunciation of *Xu* is like *Xi*, rhyming with *Shu*; some write it as *Peng Kun*), and He Guji following behind. Arriving at the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all became lost.\n\nEncountering a young herdboy tending horses, the Yellow Emperor inquired of him the way: \"Do you know Mount Jucí?\" The boy replied, \"I do.\" (The *Zhuangzi* likens the Great Vastness to the Dao and Jucí to the human body, teaching that the Dao resides within man and need not be sought afar. Mount Jucí lies in Mi County of Rongyang.) \"Do you know where Tai Yuan dwells?\" \"I do,\" the boy answered.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor exclaimed, \"How extraordinary, this young boy! Not only does he know Mount Jucí, but he also knows where Tai Yuan abides?\" (The herdboy tending horses is an allegory for one who embodies the Dao.) \"May I ask how to govern the world?\"\n\nThe young herdboy said, \"Governing the world is no different from this—what more is there to do? When tending horses, one lets them roam freely to water and grass, riding them only as their strength allows. In governing the world, one plows to eat, weaves to clothe, and abides in non-action—what else is there to do? In my youth, I wandered freely within the Six Directions. Then I fell suddenly ill, and an elder taught me: 'Ride the chariot of the sun and wander the wilds of Xiangcheng.' Now my illness has slightly eased, and I shall soon wander beyond the Six Directions again. Governing the world is no different from this—what more is there to do?\" (Beyond the Six Directions lies what is unlike the world; within the Six Directions lies what is of the world.)\n\nThe *piē* illness is a wind affliction. The elder is one who embodies the Dao. The \"chariot of the sun\" signifies daily renewal.\n\nThe herdboy said: Before awakening to the Dao, I did not harmonize with things, distinguishing purity from filth, and thus suffered this wind affliction—my heart and mind grew wild and disordered. Upon encountering one who embodies the Dao, I heard the supreme principle: riding the Way of daily renewal, moving with the times, blending radiance with dust, flowing with the current, free from external burdens, inwardly emptied and forgetful—thus my true heart restored, and the *piē* illness soon healed. How is governing the world different from this? I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.\n\nThe Emperor said: \"Governing the world is truly not your concern. Nevertheless, I ask you about governing the world.\"\n\nThe young herdboy declined. The Yellow Emperor asked again.\n\nThe herdboy said: \"How is governing the world different from herding horses? It is merely removing what harms the horses. Herding horses means not injuring their nature. Governing the world means practicing non-action, and yet nothing is left undone.\"\n\nThe Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and withdrew, calling him \"Heavenly Master.\"\n\nThe Emperor had once studied the *Scripture of the Heavenly Sovereign’s True Unity* but did not grasp the essentials of the Three-in-One True Qi. Thus, he traveled the four directions seeking its explanation. Arriving at Round Mound, he found a land with an immortal tree—those who ate its fruit and leaves never died. At Cinnabar Ridge’s spring, drinking its waters granted longevity. A giant serpent harmed the people, so the Emperor drove it away with realgar, staying for a time before returning. (The *Record of Foreign Lands* says he stayed nine years.) He ordered his three sons to practice its arts, and they all lived three hundred years.\n\nHe journeyed east to Green Mound, where he met the Master of the Purple Palace. Ascending Phoenix Mountain, he received the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the celestial script of the Great Characters, and the *Three Scrolls of Embracing Simplicity*—texts that could summon the ten thousand spirits and command the numinous herbs. Traveling south to the Five Mushrooms’ Dark Gorge, he climbed Dark Ridge, sheltered beneath the Fusang Tree, and observed where the hundred spirits ascended and descended. He gathered the *ruo-qian* mushrooms (or their kind) and drank from Cinnabar Ridge’s waters.\n\nTo the west, he met Master Central Yellow and received the method of the Nine Eggplants. To the north, at Swan Embankment, he ascended Towering Thorns, where he met the Great Courtyard Lord of Hidden County, the Great Array Spirit, and the Yellow Canopy Youth. From them, he received the *Twelve Scrolls of the Divine Mushroom Charts*. Ascending Mount Kuaiji and Mount Wangwu, he opened the stone coffer, uncovered the jade tablet, and obtained the *Scripture of the Golden Crucible’s Nine Elixirs*. He further received the Nine Cycles’ oral instructions from the Mysterious Woman.\n\nTraveling south to the Jiang River, he climbed Bear and Xiang Mountains—Bear Mountain lies in Shaoling, Xiang Mountain in Changsha and Yiyang. He went to Mount Tiantai and received the method of the Divine Golden Liquid Elixir. Hearing that Master Vast Accomplishment possessed the Dao on Empty Same Mountain (thirty *li* east of Yucheng in Liang), he sought him out and said: \"I hear you have attained the supreme Dao. May I ask about its essence? I wish to gather the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to regulate yin and yang to foster the growth of plants. How can this be done?\"\n\nMaster Vast Accomplishment said: \"What you seek to gather is the substance of things. What you seek to regulate is the destruction of things. Since you began governing the world, clouds have rained without gathering, plants have withered before yellowing, and the light of the sun and moon has grown ever dimmer. With such a scheming heart, how can you speak of the supreme Dao?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread white thatch, and secluded himself for three months before returning to seek him again. Master Vast Accomplishment lay with his head to the south, turning away. The Emperor approached from downwind, crawling on his knees, bowing twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and asked: \"I hear you have attained the supreme Dao. May I ask how to cultivate the body so as to attain longevity?\"\n\nMaster Vast Accomplishment rose abruptly and said: \"Excellent question! Come, I will tell you: The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure. Its ultimate reaches are dim and silent. You must be still, you must be pure. Do not weary your body, do not disturb your essence—only then can you live long. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing. Then your spirit will guard your form, and you may live long. Guard your inner self, close off the outer. Excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I have guided you to the source of the Great Brilliance, the origin of utmost yang. I have led you through the gate of profound obscurity, the origin of utmost yin. Heaven and earth have their offices, yin and yang their storehouses. Guard your body carefully, and things will naturally flourish. I preserve the One and abide in harmony. Thus, I have cultivated myself for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and said: \"Master Vast Accomplishment is truly heaven!\"\n\nMaster Vast Accomplishment continued: \"Those things are inexhaustible, yet people all take them as finite. Those things are unfathomable, yet people all take them as limits. Those who attain my Dao become emperors above and kings below. Those who lose it see light above and become dust below. Now, the hundred living things all arise from the earth and return to it. Therefore, I will enter with you through the gate of the inexhaustible and wander the wilds of the boundless. I share the light of the sun and moon, I am constant with heaven and earth. Am I near? Am I distant? Will all people perish while I alone endure?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor grasped the essentials of the Dao and once more traveled the four seas. Traces of his chariot ruts and horse tracks, cinnabar wells and abandoned altars, remain scattered everywhere. On Heavenly Altar Mountain in Shu, there is a cinnabar well. On Prosperity Mountain, Green City Mountain, and Cloud-Adorned Mountain, chariot tracks endure. On Yongjia Mountain, there is a cinnabar spring. On Green City Mountain and Mount Luofu, ancient altars remain.\n\nCrossing the Dark Pass, he met the Central Yellow Elder, ascended Cloud Terrace, and entered the capital of the Heavenly Kingdom of Green City. There he met Master Yu and received the *Scripture of Dragon Training*. He built an altar on the mountain and enfeoffed Master Yu as the Elder of the Five Peaks, commanding the peak spirits to pay court twice a month. The peak spirits sprinkled the six seasonal springs to mark the passage of time.\n\nThe Emperor inquired of the Master about the Dao of True Unity. The Master replied: \"I attained the Dao and became an immortal, yet I am not an official of the Three Sovereigns’ Celestial Perfection. Truly, I do not comprehend this scripture of True Unity. Recently, the August Person was sent by the Lord of Fusang to govern the immortal officials of Mount Emei and has not yet departed. You may go and ask him.\"\n\nThe Emperor then journeyed to Mount Emei, purified himself for three months, and was granted an audience with the August Person. This August Person—no one knew from which age he came—stood nine feet tall, his body covered in dark fur over a foot long, his hair only a few inches in length. His dwelling lay beneath an sheer cliff on the mountain’s northern face, its halls built of azure jade, its groves wrought of gold, ever-perfumed with the fragrance of thousand-harmony incense. His attendants were jade maidens of the immortals, and three guests sat beside him, each styled the Celestial Perfection Immortal Kings.\n\nUpon seeing the August Person, the Emperor was offered the essence of cinnabar blossoms to drink and the nectar of jade wells to rinse his mouth. When the Yellow Emperor prostrated himself, kowtowed twice, and rose, he begged to be taught the Dao of longevity. The August Person said: \"You already govern the Four Seas—do you still covet immortality?\" The Emperor replied: \"Without a ruler, the myriad peoples oppress one another. Now I have established laws to transmit to posterity. Yet my private heart cherishes the Dao. I have traversed the Four Seas and, by fortune, encountered a Dao Lord. I humbly beseech your compassionate instruction.\n\nI have glimpsed the *Scripture of the True Person’s Essence-Feeding*, but though I have perused its words, I have not grasped its meaning; though I have read its phrases, I have not fathomed its practices. I beg to be taught.\" The August Person was greatly astonished and, after a long silence, answered: \"How did you come to hear of this? This is the first chapter of the *Golden Register*, the numinous talisman of High Heaven, the precious scripture of the Most High. It enables one to ascend to heaven in broad daylight, to stride through the void, to generate water and fire within the body, and to transform without end—this is the perfection of celestial immortality, attainable only through the Nine-Transformations Elixir of Dragon Embryo and Golden Liquor.\n\nTo preserve form and abstain from grain, to repel the myriad evils, to command ghosts and spirits, to live long and endure—this is when the blood flows freely, the intestines transmute into sinews, no calamity can harm one, and life extends for billions of years. This is achieved only through the *Scripture of True Unity and the Five Sprouts’ Feeding*. These two matters are overseen by the Lord of the Southern Dipper, who presents them to the Great Emperor’s tally-key. Unless one is bound by the covenant that an immortal emerges once every four thousand years, none may violate the statutes and recklessly divulge them.\n\nMoreover, the Queen Mother of the West has secreted this book within the Five Cities. Its outer defenses are formidable, with twelve immortal towers guarding it. It is stored in a casket of purple jade, inscribed on tablets of yellow gold, sealed with the radiance of cinnabar mushrooms, and stamped with the seal of the Most High’s Central Chapter. Those without immortal registers may not hear of it. You are not yet fit to hear heavenly sounds with earthly ears—you may depart.\"\n\nThe Emperor replied: \"Formerly, I received the divine elixir from the Dark Maiden, yet I have not obtained the *Scripture of the Five Sprouts’ Feeding of True Essence*. Now, by the convergence of fate, I have met a Dao Lord. If you do not bestow the Dao of life upon me, it means I am not destined to transcend the world.\" He knocked his head upon the ground until it bled, pleading for mercy and deliverance.\n\nThe Three Celestial Perfection Immortal Kings took pity and interceded: \"This man’s former lives have accumulated merit even among birds and beasts, and thus his virtuous aura shines upon the imperial throne. Why conceal from him the *Scripture of True Sprouts*? He may be taught and perfected.\" The August Person then commanded the Emperor to sit and instructed him: \"The scripture you mentioned earlier concerns the qi of High Heaven returning to the one body. When the one body is distinctly perceived, it may endure forever.\n\nOf all living things, humans are the most numinous, yet they cannot preserve their spirit and repel the myriad evils. Those who understand this do not seek protection from heaven but find it sufficient within themselves. Moreover, the body is like a state: the chest and abdomen are its palaces, the four limbs its suburbs, the joints its officials, the spirit its ruler, the blood its ministers, and the qi its people. Thus, to know how to govern the body is to know how to govern the state. Cherishing the people secures the state; treasuring the qi preserves the body. When the people scatter, the state perishes; when the qi is exhausted, the body dies. What has perished cannot be restored; what is dead cannot be revived.\n\nTherefore, the perfected person eliminates incipient disasters, cures unformed illnesses, and firmly guards against them before they arise, rather than pursuing them after they have passed. The people are difficult to nurture yet easy to disperse; the qi is difficult to preserve yet easy to lose. Examine your power and virtue to solidify governance; sever desires to perfect your true nature. Then True Unity abides, and the Three Ones are guarded. The Mud Pill Palace, Crimson Palace, and Cinnabar Field are the dwellings of the Three Ones. Diligently guard them, and the myriad poisons will not harm you. Rinse with the Flower Pool and consume the Five Sprouts, and you will become a true immortal.\n\nI received this scripture from the True King of the Nine Heavens and now transmit it to you. Preserve it in your mouth—it is called the Cinnabar Crow Elixir; draw it from your body—it is called True Unity. Be diligent and secretive, for it holds great significance.\" He added: \"The Five Grains are the chisels that carve away life; the Five Sprouts are the roots of longevity.\"\n\nAfter receiving the Dao, the Emperor passed by Mount Lu, where he appointed the Messenger of the Nine Heavens, ranked the Elder of Green City among the officials, and made him comparable to the Censor-in-Chief, overseeing the registers of all immortal officials as the Inspector of the Five Peaks. The Emperor also enfeoffed the Lord of Wan Mountain as the Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens, keeper of the records of life and death.\n\nObserving that the Four Peaks each had auxiliary mountains while the Southern Peak stood solitary, he memorialized the Three Heavens’ Most High Dao Lord, appointing Mount Huo as the Heir Apparent of the Southern Peak and Mount Shan as its Deputy to assist in governance. He then depicted the forms of the mountains, rivers, and myriad things of the Nine Provinces, creating maps of the Five Peaks to transmit to the world.\n\nOn Mount Jinyun, the Emperor refined the elixir stone, where the auspicious signs of Jinyun appeared. He established the Hall of Jinyun, where the Cinnabar Mound endured. The Emperor concealed the *Illustrated Charts of Military Victory and Defeat* and the *Books of the Six Jia and Yin-Yang* on Mount Miao.\n\nNow situated in Yuezhou, it is also called Mount Yubu. It was where Yu assembled his ministers to recount their merits, hence the name Mount Kuaiji. The Emperor also gathered auspicious omens at Mount Fu, serving the Supreme Unity Primordial Lady, receiving the arts of transformation and concealment, which he hid within the cliffs of Kongtong. On Mount Tai, the Emperor examined the methods of celestial reckoning; he studied the techniques of physical diagnosis with Qi Bo and Lei Gong, discussed qi and climatic patterns with Feng Hou, and mastered pitch and measurement with Rong Cheng. He healed the wounded, refined metallurgy, and compiled all essential secrets, thoroughly investigating the true Dao. Transmitting the *Yin Talismans*, he inwardly aligned with the celestial mechanisms and outwardly harmonized with human affairs.\n\nGoverning the realm, his domain extended south to Jiaolu, north to Youling, west to the Flowing Sands, and east to the Pantaos. The Pantaos grow on Mount Duosuo, as recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. The Emperor declared: \"I have heard of letting the world be at ease, not of ruling it. I have wearied the world for too long. I shall rest my chariot at Xuanpu to return to my true nature.\" Xuanpu lies atop Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor’s palace stands.\n\nAfter completing the feng and shan sacrifices, he mined copper from Mount Shou and cast a cauldron to embody the myriad things. When the cauldron was finished, it was enshrined in Yongzhou to represent the Supreme Unity. The place was named Hucheng County, formerly known as Dingzhou. Mount Jing, where Feng Lan cherished virtue, is now called Huangtianyuan. The cauldron could discern fortune and misfortune, life and death; it could be light or heavy, still or moving; it boiled without fire, filled without drawing water, and spontaneously produced the five flavors—truly a divine cauldron. Thereupon, he refined the elixir of the Nine Cauldrons, ingested it according to the methods of cinnabar alchemy, and transmitted it to Xuanzǐ under a solemn covenant. The *Elixir Classic* was concealed on the eastern slopes of Mount Jiuyi at Mount Weiyu, borne upon patterned jade and sealed with a slab of stone, its text inscribed in gold on jade tablets.\n\nYu of Xia obtained the text, compounded the elixir, and attained the Dao, hiding it on Mount Kuaiji. Zhang Daoling later acquired the text, compounded the elixir, and ascended to heaven, concealing it on Mount Yuntai. The Emperor also inscribed one copy of the *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* on gold tablets and concealed it on Mount Zhong, while another was hidden on Mount Wanwei. The swords, mirrors, and cauldrons he cast were all inscribed with celestial patterns and ancient characters, some bearing cryptic prophecies.\n\nWhen the balmy wind arrived, divine beings gathered, fulfilling his resolve to yield his reign. He left his cap, sash, and sword atop the precipitous Kun Terrace at Dinghu, establishing a hall below. There was a man named Ma Shihuang, skilled in veterinary medicine and attuned to the divine. Suddenly, a dragon descended into his courtyard, mouth agape and eyes shut. Shihuang examined it and saw that the dragon was ill; he inserted an acupuncture needle into its mouth and administered a decoction of licorice boiled in cow’s milk. The dragon’s ailment was cured, and Shihuang rode it away.\n\nHearing of this, the Yellow Emperor chose an auspicious day—the wuwu day—to ascend to heaven. Indeed, a yellow dragon with drooping whiskers descended to welcome him. The Emperor mounted the dragon and ascended, accompanied by Wuweizi and seventy-two officials. Those minor attendants who could not follow grasped the dragon’s whiskers, which broke off, and the Emperor’s bow fell; the attendants clung to the bow and wailed, hence the name \"Wailing Bow.\" The people gazed heavenward and cried out, naming the place Huangtianyuan, also called Dinghu (now Hucheng County).\n\nLater, his minister Zuo Zhe carved a wooden likeness of the Yellow Emperor, leading the feudal lords to pay homage. His officials, filled with longing, took his desk and staff to establish a temple and offer sacrifices, and placed his robes and cap in a tomb to guard it—thus arose the mausoleum on Mount Qiao. In Shangjun’s Zhouyang County stands Mount Qiao, and in Fushi County there is a shrine to the Yellow Emperor. In Fangzhou’s Mount Qiao lies the Yellow Emperor’s tomb. Wherever the Yellow Emperor once traveled, shrines were erected.\n\nFive hundred years later, the tomb on Mount Qiao collapsed, its chamber empty save for a sword and a red crow, both of which vanished one day. The *Classic of Mount Jing* and the *Record of Dragon’s Head* contain full accounts.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor ruled over the land of Dai for two hundred and ten years, reigning for a hundred years. Ascending to heaven, he became the Lord Taiyi, also known as the Star of Xuanyuan. His form was that of the Yellow Dragon, residing in the Southern Palace. In grand rituals to honor the celestial deities, Xuanyuan [is the deity worshipped]. Later generations revered him, ranking him among the Five Emperors, where he presided at the center to match Heaven. This is because the Yellow Emperor embodied the virtue of earth, occupying the central position and governing the four directions. The Azure Emperor Taihao ruled the east, the Vermilion Emperor Shennong the south, the White Emperor Shaohao the west, and the Black Emperor Zhuanxu the north—these were the Five Human Emperors of the four quarters. The Star of Saturn was considered their son, corresponding above to the Five Elders and below to the Five Emperors.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s son Changyi dwelled by the Weak Water, while Changyi’s younger brother Shaohao was born to the imperial consort Lady Jie. The Emperor’s daughter drowned in the Eastern Sea and transformed into a bird named Jingwei, which constantly carried wood and stones from the Western Mountains to fill the Eastern Sea.\n\nShaohao, named Zhi and styled Qingyang, ascended the throne as the Metal Sky Clan. He was a son of the Yellow Emperor. Zhuanxu of Gaoyang, a grandson of the Yellow Emperor, possessed sagely virtue. He reigned for seventy-eight years and lived to ninety-eight. His mother was of the Shushan clan, and his capital was at Shangqiu and Puyang.\n\nYuqiong, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor and son of Zhuanxu, attained the Dao alongside Zhuanxu. Zhuanxu became Xuanming, while Yuqiong became the Water God of the North.\n\nFrom Zhuanxu onward, rulers took their names from the lands they developed. Emperor Ku of Gaoxin was a grandson of the Yellow Emperor, born to Jiaoji. Divine from birth, he declared his own name. His capital was at Yanshi (now in Henan). He reigned for seventy years and lived to one hundred and five.\n\nEmperor Yao of Taotang, a great-great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor, bore the surname Yiqi and the given name Fangxun. Rising in Dingtao (with Dingtao in Jiyin and Tang County in Dingzhou), he became emperor as the Marquis of Tang. His capital was at Pingyang (in Jinzhou). He reigned for ninety-eight years and lived to one hundred and eighty-eight.\n\nEmperor Shun of Youyu, surnamed Yao and named Chonghua, was an eight-generation descendant of the Yellow Emperor. The state of Liang had a Yucheng (now Caizhou), and his capital was at Puban. Living to a hundred, he attained the Dao and ascended at Mount Jiuyi.\n\nYu of Xia, styled Xiahou, was a great-great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor, surnamed Si and named Wenming. After eight generations from Shun, Yu succeeded him—yet how could Yu be his great-great-grandson? According to the *Tunji Kaishan Tu*: Yu was an immortal who had attained the Dao. In ancient times, there was a Great Yu, a nineteenth-generation descendant of Nüwa, who lived for three hundred and sixty years before entering Mount Jiuyi. Three thousand six hundred years later, when Yao governed the realm, floods raged, and the people suffered. The Great Yu, moved by compassion, was reborn from a spring on Mount Shiniu. A woman of the Di tribe, drawing water at dusk, found a stone like a pearl, cherished it, and swallowed it. She conceived and, after fourteen months, gave birth to a son. When grown, he knew the spring’s source and was thus named Yu. He succeeded his father Gun to govern the waters for three years. Upon completing his work, Shun appointed him Minister of Works. Later, he abdicated the imperial throne. By this reckoning, he was a great-great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor.\n\nTang of Yin was a seventeenth-generation descendant of the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor’s son Shaohao begot Jiaoji, who begot Gaoxin. Fourteen generations later, Tianyi became the king of Yin.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s descendants received their surnames based on their deeds. The twelve surnames determined by the Emperor through the tuning of pitch pipes are recorded in the middle volume. Shaohao had a son surnamed Man, while Zhuanxu bore the surname Ji. As the Yellow Emperor dwelled by the Ji River, Emperor Ku’s son Houji also took the surname Ji. Yao bore the surname Yiqi, Shun Yao, Yu Si, and Tang Zi.\n\nAdditionally, the clans of Zhang, Deng, Xuan, Lu, Huang, Kou, Song, Li, Bai, Xue, Qian, Zi, Yiqi, Shentu, Huang, Tuoba—Changyi’s son was enfeoffed in the northern lands. Because the Yellow Emperor embodied the earth virtue and northern customs associated earth with \"tuo\" and rulers with \"ba,\" the surname Tuoba was adopted.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor had sons, each enfeoffed in a separate state, as detailed in the middle volume. In total, thirty-three clans descended from the Yellow Emperor. His lineage continued for one thousand two hundred and fifty years. From the year *jiyou* of the Yellow Emperor’s reign to the second year of Guangming in the Great Tang (the year *xinchou*), a span of three thousand four hundred and seventy-two years has passed.\n\nHere ends the *Record of the Yellow Emperor’s Original Conduct*.",

Composed by Wang Quan of the Tang dynasty. Based on the text from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, \"Biographies and Records\" section of the *Dongzhen* division.\n\n**Cultivating the Dao and Virtue**\nAfter the world was well-governed and all things were in order, the Yellow Emperor sought the true, visited recluses, inquired into the Dao, and pursued immortality, hoping to attain longevity and enduring vision—what is called \"ascending to transcendence after ordering the age.\"\n\nAt that time, there was Yu Fengzi, who served as the Pottery Master. A divine person passed by and tended the fire for him, able to emerge and enter within five-colored smoke. After a long while, he taught this to Fengzi. Fengzi accumulated fire and burned himself, rising and descending with the smoke and qi. One day, he flew away, journeyed to the Flowing Sands, ate flying fish, and temporarily died. After two hundred years, he revived.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor studied his Dao and traveled with Fengzi to Lantian Sands, with Feng Hou carrying books and Chang Bo bearing a sword. Each day, they went to the Hun River, and by evening returned to Pu and Jin, covering ten thousand *li* in a single breath. The Hun River was like drifting sand; stepping upon it caused one to sink, its depth unfathomable. Great winds blew the sand like mist, and within the mist were many divine dragons, fish, and giant turtles, all capable of flight. There was a stone indigo, blue-green in color, hard yet very light, drifting with the wind and covering the flowing sands. One stem bore a hundred leaves, blooming once every thousand years. Thus, Yu Feng’s *Roaming the Sea* poem says:\n*\"The blue-green indigo glows for a thousand years unfurled,*\n*A hundred lifetimes briefly die to feed on flying fish.\"*\n\nThere was Wuguangzi, eight *chi* and seven *cun* tall, a divine immortal. From the time of the Yellow Emperor to the Xia dynasty, he often wandered among the people, consuming herbs to nurture his nature and delighting in playing the zither for self-amusement. There was Chijiang Ziyu, who did not eat the five grains but fed on the flowers of a hundred plants to prolong his years. By the time of Yao, he served as the Wood Minister, able to ascend and descend with the wind and rain, having lived for two thousand years already.\n\nThere was Master Rongcheng, skilled in the arts of supplementation and guiding, preserving life and nurturing qi, so that the spirit of the valley never died. He could restore white hair to black and regrow fallen teeth. The Emperor admired his Dao and thus constructed the Five Cities and Twelve Towers to await divine persons. He then sought the Dao, traveling to Mount Hua and Mount Shou, and bound them to Mount Tai. At times, he summoned strange creatures to commune with the divine, meeting immortals at Penglai. Returning, he received the myriad spirits at the Bright Court in the capital, at the Cold Gate of Mount Shen in the Gansu Valley, north of Chang’an in Yunyang.\n\nThereupon, the Yellow Emperor performed the suburban sacrifice to Heaven on the Circular Mound, seeking the supreme Dao. He became a disciple of Jiu Yuanzi. In the first year of the Earth Sovereign’s reign, on the first *yin* day of the first month, he fasted at Mount Shou in He Dong’s Puji. He then traveled extensively to seek the Dao. He was about to meet Tai Yuan on Mount Jucí, with Fang Ming as his charioteer, Chang Yu as his outrider, Zhang Ruo and Zhu Xu leading the procession (the pronunciation of *Xu* is like *Xi*, rhyming with *Shu*; some write it as *Peng Kun*), and He Guji following behind. Arriving at the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all became lost.",

      "translated_text": "The *piē* illness is a wind affliction. The elder is one who embodies the Dao. The \"chariot of the sun\" signifies daily renewal.\n\nThe herdboy said: Before awakening to the Dao, I did not harmonize with things, distinguishing purity from filth, and thus suffered this wind affliction—my heart and mind grew wild and disordered. Upon encountering one who embodies the Dao, I heard the supreme principle: riding the Way of daily renewal, moving with the times, blending radiance with dust, flowing with the current, free from external burdens, inwardly emptied and forgetful—thus my true heart restored, and the *piē* illness soon healed. How is governing the world different from this? I practice non-action, and the people transform themselves.\n\nThe Emperor said: \"Governing the world is truly not your concern. Nevertheless, I ask you about governing the world.\"\n\nThe young herdboy declined. The Yellow Emperor asked again.\n\nThe herdboy said: \"How is governing the world different from herding horses? It is merely removing what harms the horses. Herding horses means not injuring their nature. Governing the world means practicing non-action, and yet nothing is left undone.\"\n\nThe Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and withdrew, calling him \"Heavenly Master.\"\n\nThe Emperor had once studied the *Scripture of the Heavenly Sovereign’s True Unity* but did not grasp the essentials of the Three-in-One True Qi. Thus, he traveled the four directions seeking its explanation. Arriving at Round Mound, he found a land with an immortal tree—those who ate its fruit and leaves never died. At Cinnabar Ridge’s spring, drinking its waters granted longevity. A giant serpent harmed the people, so the Emperor drove it away with realgar, staying for a time before returning. (The *Record of Foreign Lands* says he stayed nine years.) He ordered his three sons to practice its arts, and they all lived three hundred years.\n\nHe journeyed east to Green Mound, where he met the Master of the Purple Palace. Ascending Phoenix Mountain, he received the *Inner Writings of the Three Sovereigns*, the celestial script of the Great Characters, and the *Three Scrolls of Embracing Simplicity*—texts that could summon the ten thousand spirits and command the numinous herbs. Traveling south to the Five Mushrooms’ Dark Gorge, he climbed Dark Ridge, sheltered beneath the Fusang Tree, and observed where the hundred spirits ascended and descended. He gathered the *ruo-qian* mushrooms (or their kind) and drank from Cinnabar Ridge’s waters.\n\nTo the west, he met Master Central Yellow and received the method of the Nine Eggplants. To the north, at Swan Embankment, he ascended Towering Thorns, where he met the Great Courtyard Lord of Hidden County, the Great Array Spirit, and the Yellow Canopy Youth. From them, he received the *Twelve Scrolls of the Divine Mushroom Charts*. Ascending Mount Kuaiji and Mount Wangwu, he opened the stone coffer, uncovered the jade tablet, and obtained the *Scripture of the Golden Crucible’s Nine Elixirs*. He further received the Nine Cycles’ oral instructions from the Mysterious Woman.\n\nTraveling south to the Jiang River, he climbed Bear and Xiang Mountains—Bear Mountain lies in Shaoling, Xiang Mountain in Changsha and Yiyang. He went to Mount Tiantai and received the method of the Divine Golden Liquid Elixir. Hearing that Master Vast Accomplishment possessed the Dao on Empty Same Mountain (thirty *li* east of Yucheng in Liang), he sought him out and said: \"I hear you have attained the supreme Dao. May I ask about its essence? I wish to gather the essence of heaven and earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to regulate yin and yang to foster the growth of plants. How can this be done?\"\n\nMaster Vast Accomplishment said: \"What you seek to gather is the substance of things. What you seek to regulate is the destruction of things. Since you began governing the world, clouds have rained without gathering, plants have withered before yellowing, and the light of the sun and moon has grown ever dimmer. With such a scheming heart, how can you speak of the supreme Dao?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread white thatch, and secluded himself for three months before returning to seek him again. Master Vast Accomplishment lay with his head to the south, turning away. The Emperor approached from downwind, crawling on his knees, bowing twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and asked: \"I hear you have attained the supreme Dao. May I ask how to cultivate the body so as to attain longevity?\"\n\nMaster Vast Accomplishment rose abruptly and said: \"Excellent question! Come, I will tell you: The essence of the supreme Dao is profound and obscure. Its ultimate reaches are dim and silent. You must be still, you must be pure. Do not weary your body, do not disturb your essence—only then can you live long. Let your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, your heart know nothing. Then your spirit will guard your form, and you may live long. Guard your inner self, close off the outer. Excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I have guided you to the source of the Great Brilliance, the origin of utmost yang. I have led you through the gate of profound obscurity, the origin of utmost yin. Heaven and earth have their offices, yin and yang their storehouses. Guard your body carefully, and things will naturally flourish. I preserve the One and abide in harmony. Thus, I have cultivated myself for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined.\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and said: \"Master Vast Accomplishment is truly heaven!\"\n\nMaster Vast Accomplishment continued: \"Those things are inexhaustible, yet people all take them as finite. Those things are unfathomable, yet people all take them as limits. Those who attain my Dao become emperors above and kings below. Those who lose it see light above and become dust below. Now, the hundred living things all arise from the earth and return to it. Therefore, I will enter with you through the gate of the inexhaustible and wander the wilds of the boundless. I share the light of the sun and moon, I am constant with heaven and earth. Am I near? Am I distant? Will all people perish while I alone endure?\"\n\nThe Yellow Emperor grasped the essentials of the Dao and once more traveled the four seas. Traces of his chariot ruts and horse tracks, cinnabar wells and abandoned altars, remain scattered everywhere. On Heavenly Altar Mountain in Shu, there is a cinnabar well. On Prosperity Mountain, Green City Mountain, and Cloud-Adorned Mountain, chariot tracks endure. On Yongjia Mountain, there is a cinnabar spring. On Green City Mountain and Mount Luofu, ancient altars remain.\n\nCrossing the Dark Pass, he met the Central Yellow Elder, ascended Cloud Terrace, and entered the capital of the Heavenly Kingdom of Green City. There he met Master Yu and received the *Scripture of Dragon Training*. He built an altar on the mountain and enfeoffed Master Yu as the Elder of the Five Peaks, commanding the peak spirits to pay court twice a month. The peak spirits sprinkled the six seasonal springs to mark the passage of time.",

      "translated_text": "The Emperor inquired of the Master about the Dao of True Unity. The Master replied: \"I attained the Dao and became an immortal, yet I am not an official of the Three Sovereigns’ Celestial Perfection. Truly, I do not comprehend this scripture of True Unity. Recently, the August Person was sent by the Lord of Fusang to govern the immortal officials of Mount Emei and has not yet departed. You may go and ask him.\"\n\nThe Emperor then journeyed to Mount Emei, purified himself for three months, and was granted an audience with the August Person. This August Person—no one knew from which age he came—stood nine feet tall, his body covered in dark fur over a foot long, his hair only a few inches in length. His dwelling lay beneath an sheer cliff on the mountain’s northern face, its halls built of azure jade, its groves wrought of gold, ever-perfumed with the fragrance of thousand-harmony incense. His attendants were jade maidens of the immortals, and three guests sat beside him, each styled the Celestial Perfection Immortal Kings.\n\nUpon seeing the August Person, the Emperor was offered the essence of cinnabar blossoms to drink and the nectar of jade wells to rinse his mouth. When the Yellow Emperor prostrated himself, kowtowed twice, and rose, he begged to be taught the Dao of longevity. The August Person said: \"You already govern the Four Seas—do you still covet immortality?\" The Emperor replied: \"Without a ruler, the myriad peoples oppress one another. Now I have established laws to transmit to posterity. Yet my private heart cherishes the Dao. I have traversed the Four Seas and, by fortune, encountered a Dao Lord. I humbly beseech your compassionate instruction.\n\nI have glimpsed the *Scripture of the True Person’s Essence-Feeding*, but though I have perused its words, I have not grasped its meaning; though I have read its phrases, I have not fathomed its practices. I beg to be taught.\" The August Person was greatly astonished and, after a long silence, answered: \"How did you come to hear of this? This is the first chapter of the *Golden Register*, the numinous talisman of High Heaven, the precious scripture of the Most High. It enables one to ascend to heaven in broad daylight, to stride through the void, to generate water and fire within the body, and to transform without end—this is the perfection of celestial immortality, attainable only through the Nine-Transformations Elixir of Dragon Embryo and Golden Liquor.\n\nTo preserve form and abstain from grain, to repel the myriad evils, to command ghosts and spirits, to live long and endure—this is when the blood flows freely, the intestines transmute into sinews, no calamity can harm one, and life extends for billions of years. This is achieved only through the *Scripture of True Unity and the Five Sprouts’ Feeding*. These two matters are overseen by the Lord of the Southern Dipper, who presents them to the Great Emperor’s tally-key. Unless one is bound by the covenant that an immortal emerges once every four thousand years, none may violate the statutes and recklessly divulge them.\n\nMoreover, the Queen Mother of the West has secreted this book within the Five Cities. Its outer defenses are formidable, with twelve immortal towers guarding it. It is stored in a casket of purple jade, inscribed on tablets of yellow gold, sealed with the radiance of cinnabar mushrooms, and stamped with the seal of the Most High’s Central Chapter. Those without immortal registers may not hear of it. You are not yet fit to hear heavenly sounds with earthly ears—you may depart.\"\n\nThe Emperor replied: \"Formerly, I received the divine elixir from the Dark Maiden, yet I have not obtained the *Scripture of the Five Sprouts’ Feeding of True Essence*. Now, by the convergence of fate, I have met a Dao Lord. If you do not bestow the Dao of life upon me, it means I am not destined to transcend the world.\" He knocked his head upon the ground until it bled, pleading for mercy and deliverance.\n\nThe Three Celestial Perfection Immortal Kings took pity and interceded: \"This man’s former lives have accumulated merit even among birds and beasts, and thus his virtuous aura shines upon the imperial throne. Why conceal from him the *Scripture of True Sprouts*? He may be taught and perfected.\" The August Person then commanded the Emperor to sit and instructed him: \"The scripture you mentioned earlier concerns the qi of High Heaven returning to the one body. When the one body is distinctly perceived, it may endure forever.\n\nOf all living things, humans are the most numinous, yet they cannot preserve their spirit and repel the myriad evils. Those who understand this do not seek protection from heaven but find it sufficient within themselves. Moreover, the body is like a state: the chest and abdomen are its palaces, the four limbs its suburbs, the joints its officials, the spirit its ruler, the blood its ministers, and the qi its people. Thus, to know how to govern the body is to know how to govern the state. Cherishing the people secures the state; treasuring the qi preserves the body. When the people scatter, the state perishes; when the qi is exhausted, the body dies. What has perished cannot be restored; what is dead cannot be revived.\n\nTherefore, the perfected person eliminates incipient disasters, cures unformed illnesses, and firmly guards against them before they arise, rather than pursuing them after they have passed. The people are difficult to nurture yet easy to disperse; the qi is difficult to preserve yet easy to lose. Examine your power and virtue to solidify governance; sever desires to perfect your true nature. Then True Unity abides, and the Three Ones are guarded. The Mud Pill Palace, Crimson Palace, and Cinnabar Field are the dwellings of the Three Ones. Diligently guard them, and the myriad poisons will not harm you. Rinse with the Flower Pool and consume the Five Sprouts, and you will become a true immortal.\n\nI received this scripture from the True King of the Nine Heavens and now transmit it to you. Preserve it in your mouth—it is called the Cinnabar Crow Elixir; draw it from your body—it is called True Unity. Be diligent and secretive, for it holds great significance.\" He added: \"The Five Grains are the chisels that carve away life; the Five Sprouts are the roots of longevity.\"\n\nAfter receiving the Dao, the Emperor passed by Mount Lu, where he appointed the Messenger of the Nine Heavens, ranked the Elder of Green City among the officials, and made him comparable to the Censor-in-Chief, overseeing the registers of all immortal officials as the Inspector of the Five Peaks. The Emperor also enfeoffed the Lord of Wan Mountain as the Controller of Destinies of the Nine Heavens, keeper of the records of life and death.\n\nObserving that the Four Peaks each had auxiliary mountains while the Southern Peak stood solitary, he memorialized the Three Heavens’ Most High Dao Lord, appointing Mount Huo as the Heir Apparent of the Southern Peak and Mount Shan as its Deputy to assist in governance. He then depicted the forms of the mountains, rivers, and myriad things of the Nine Provinces, creating maps of the Five Peaks to transmit to the world.\n\nOn Mount Jinyun, the Emperor refined the elixir stone, where the auspicious signs of Jinyun appeared. He established the Hall of Jinyun, where the Cinnabar Mound endured. The Emperor concealed the *Illustrated Charts of Military Victory and Defeat* and the *Books of the Six Jia and Yin-Yang* on Mount Miao.",

      "translated_text": "Now situated in Yuezhou, it is also called Mount Yubu. It was where Yu assembled his ministers to recount their merits, hence the name Mount Kuaiji. The Emperor also gathered auspicious omens at Mount Fu, serving the Supreme Unity Primordial Lady, receiving the arts of transformation and concealment, which he hid within the cliffs of Kongtong. On Mount Tai, the Emperor examined the methods of celestial reckoning; he studied the techniques of physical diagnosis with Qi Bo and Lei Gong, discussed qi and climatic patterns with Feng Hou, and mastered pitch and measurement with Rong Cheng. He healed the wounded, refined metallurgy, and compiled all essential secrets, thoroughly investigating the true Dao. Transmitting the *Yin Talismans*, he inwardly aligned with the celestial mechanisms and outwardly harmonized with human affairs.\n\nGoverning the realm, his domain extended south to Jiaolu, north to Youling, west to the Flowing Sands, and east to the Pantaos. The Pantaos grow on Mount Duosuo, as recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. The Emperor declared: \"I have heard of letting the world be at ease, not of ruling it. I have wearied the world for too long. I shall rest my chariot at Xuanpu to return to my true nature.\" Xuanpu lies atop Kunlun, where the Yellow Emperor’s palace stands.\n\nAfter completing the feng and shan sacrifices, he mined copper from Mount Shou and cast a cauldron to embody the myriad things. When the cauldron was finished, it was enshrined in Yongzhou to represent the Supreme Unity. The place was named Hucheng County, formerly known as Dingzhou. Mount Jing, where Feng Lan cherished virtue, is now called Huangtianyuan. The cauldron could discern fortune and misfortune, life and death; it could be light or heavy, still or moving; it boiled without fire, filled without drawing water, and spontaneously produced the five flavors—truly a divine cauldron. Thereupon, he refined the elixir of the Nine Cauldrons, ingested it according to the methods of cinnabar alchemy, and transmitted it to Xuanzǐ under a solemn covenant. The *Elixir Classic* was concealed on the eastern slopes of Mount Jiuyi at Mount Weiyu, borne upon patterned jade and sealed with a slab of stone, its text inscribed in gold on jade tablets.\n\nYu of Xia obtained the text, compounded the elixir, and attained the Dao, hiding it on Mount Kuaiji. Zhang Daoling later acquired the text, compounded the elixir, and ascended to heaven, concealing it on Mount Yuntai. The Emperor also inscribed one copy of the *Five Talismans of the Numinous Treasure* on gold tablets and concealed it on Mount Zhong, while another was hidden on Mount Wanwei. The swords, mirrors, and cauldrons he cast were all inscribed with celestial patterns and ancient characters, some bearing cryptic prophecies.\n\nWhen the balmy wind arrived, divine beings gathered, fulfilling his resolve to yield his reign. He left his cap, sash, and sword atop the precipitous Kun Terrace at Dinghu, establishing a hall below. There was a man named Ma Shihuang, skilled in veterinary medicine and attuned to the divine. Suddenly, a dragon descended into his courtyard, mouth agape and eyes shut. Shihuang examined it and saw that the dragon was ill; he inserted an acupuncture needle into its mouth and administered a decoction of licorice boiled in cow’s milk. The dragon’s ailment was cured, and Shihuang rode it away.\n\nHearing of this, the Yellow Emperor chose an auspicious day—the wuwu day—to ascend to heaven. Indeed, a yellow dragon with drooping whiskers descended to welcome him. The Emperor mounted the dragon and ascended, accompanied by Wuweizi and seventy-two officials. Those minor attendants who could not follow grasped the dragon’s whiskers, which broke off, and the Emperor’s bow fell; the attendants clung to the bow and wailed, hence the name \"Wailing Bow.\" The people gazed heavenward and cried out, naming the place Huangtianyuan, also called Dinghu (now Hucheng County).\n\nLater, his minister Zuo Zhe carved a wooden likeness of the Yellow Emperor, leading the feudal lords to pay homage. His officials, filled with longing, took his desk and staff to establish a temple and offer sacrifices, and placed his robes and cap in a tomb to guard it—thus arose the mausoleum on Mount Qiao. In Shangjun’s Zhouyang County stands Mount Qiao, and in Fushi County there is a shrine to the Yellow Emperor. In Fangzhou’s Mount Qiao lies the Yellow Emperor’s tomb. Wherever the Yellow Emperor once traveled, shrines were erected.\n\nFive hundred years later, the tomb on Mount Qiao collapsed, its chamber empty save for a sword and a red crow, both of which vanished one day. The *Classic of Mount Jing* and the *Record of Dragon’s Head* contain full accounts.",

He established the Hall of Jinyun, where the Cinnabar Mound endured.

      "translated_text": "The Yellow Emperor ruled over the land of Dai for two hundred and ten years, reigning for a hundred years. Ascending to heaven, he became the Lord Taiyi, also known as the Star of Xuanyuan. His form was that of the Yellow Dragon, residing in the Southern Palace. In grand rituals to honor the celestial deities, Xuanyuan [is the deity worshipped]. Later generations revered him, ranking him among the Five Emperors, where he presided at the center to match Heaven. This is because the Yellow Emperor embodied the virtue of earth, occupying the central position and governing the four directions. The Azure Emperor Taihao ruled the east, the Vermilion Emperor Shennong the south, the White Emperor Shaohao the west, and the Black Emperor Zhuanxu the north—these were the Five Human Emperors of the four quarters. The Star of Saturn was considered their son, corresponding above to the Five Elders and below to the Five Emperors.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s son Changyi dwelled by the Weak Water, while Changyi’s younger brother Shaohao was born to the imperial consort Lady Jie. The Emperor’s daughter drowned in the Eastern Sea and transformed into a bird named Jingwei, which constantly carried wood and stones from the Western Mountains to fill the Eastern Sea.\n\nShaohao, named Zhi and styled Qingyang, ascended the throne as the Metal Sky Clan. He was a son of the Yellow Emperor. Zhuanxu of Gaoyang, a grandson of the Yellow Emperor, possessed sagely virtue. He reigned for seventy-eight years and lived to ninety-eight. His mother was of the Shushan clan, and his capital was at Shangqiu and Puyang.\n\nYuqiong, a descendant of the Yellow Emperor and son of Zhuanxu, attained the Dao alongside Zhuanxu. Zhuanxu became Xuanming, while Yuqiong became the Water God of the North.\n\nFrom Zhuanxu onward, rulers took their names from the lands they developed. Emperor Ku of Gaoxin was a grandson of the Yellow Emperor, born to Jiaoji. Divine from birth, he declared his own name. His capital was at Yanshi (now in Henan). He reigned for seventy years and lived to one hundred and five.\n\nEmperor Yao of Taotang, a great-great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor, bore the surname Yiqi and the given name Fangxun. Rising in Dingtao (with Dingtao in Jiyin and Tang County in Dingzhou), he became emperor as the Marquis of Tang. His capital was at Pingyang (in Jinzhou). He reigned for ninety-eight years and lived to one hundred and eighty-eight.\n\nEmperor Shun of Youyu, surnamed Yao and named Chonghua, was an eight-generation descendant of the Yellow Emperor. The state of Liang had a Yucheng (now Caizhou), and his capital was at Puban. Living to a hundred, he attained the Dao and ascended at Mount Jiuyi.\n\nYu of Xia, styled Xiahou, was a great-great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor, surnamed Si and named Wenming. After eight generations from Shun, Yu succeeded him—yet how could Yu be his great-great-grandson? According to the *Tunji Kaishan Tu*: Yu was an immortal who had attained the Dao. In ancient times, there was a Great Yu, a nineteenth-generation descendant of Nüwa, who lived for three hundred and sixty years before entering Mount Jiuyi. Three thousand six hundred years later, when Yao governed the realm, floods raged, and the people suffered. The Great Yu, moved by compassion, was reborn from a spring on Mount Shiniu. A woman of the Di tribe, drawing water at dusk, found a stone like a pearl, cherished it, and swallowed it. She conceived and, after fourteen months, gave birth to a son. When grown, he knew the spring’s source and was thus named Yu. He succeeded his father Gun to govern the waters for three years. Upon completing his work, Shun appointed him Minister of Works. Later, he abdicated the imperial throne. By this reckoning, he was a great-great-grandson of the Yellow Emperor.\n\nTang of Yin was a seventeenth-generation descendant of the Yellow Emperor. The Yellow Emperor’s son Shaohao begot Jiaoji, who begot Gaoxin. Fourteen generations later, Tianyi became the king of Yin.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor’s descendants received their surnames based on their deeds. The twelve surnames determined by the Emperor through the tuning of pitch pipes are recorded in the middle volume. Shaohao had a son surnamed Man, while Zhuanxu bore the surname Ji. As the Yellow Emperor dwelled by the Ji River, Emperor Ku’s son Houji also took the surname Ji. Yao bore the surname Yiqi, Shun Yao, Yu Si, and Tang Zi.\n\nAdditionally, the clans of Zhang, Deng, Xuan, Lu, Huang, Kou, Song, Li, Bai, Xue, Qian, Zi, Yiqi, Shentu, Huang, Tuoba—Changyi’s son was enfeoffed in the northern lands. Because the Yellow Emperor embodied the earth virtue and northern customs associated earth with \"tuo\" and rulers with \"ba,\" the surname Tuoba was adopted.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor had sons, each enfeoffed in a separate state, as detailed in the middle volume. In total, thirty-three clans descended from the Yellow Emperor. His lineage continued for one thousand two hundred and fifty years. From the year *jiyou* of the Yellow Emperor’s reign to the second year of Guangming in the Great Tang (the year *xinchou*), a span of three thousand four hundred and seventy-two years has passed.\n\nHere ends the *Record of the Yellow Emperor’s Original Conduct*.",
