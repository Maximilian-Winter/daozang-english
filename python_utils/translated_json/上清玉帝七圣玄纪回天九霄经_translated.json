  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven Scripture* (abbreviated as *The Seven Sages Mysterious Record*).\nAuthor unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Supreme Clarity tradition. One fascicle.\nBase text from: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, Section Zheng Yi.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven Upper Scripture**\n\nThis is the *Upper Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven*, wherein the Supreme Sage Emperor Lord established the inception of the Nine Mysteries’ primordial *qi*. The Void and Numinous divided, the Two Modes became manifest, the Nine Origins harmonized in resonance, and the Nine Emperors commanded the spirits, all converging in the Radiant Rosy Palace of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThereupon, the Supreme Sage, in accord with the Jade Void and Purple Guest, returned to the Cinnabar Rosy Wheel of the Nine Heavens, ascending the Nine-Tiered, Sevenfold-Luminous Crimson Palace. They wandered above the Bright Clouds, traversing the desolate expanse of the Nine Voids. The Heavenly Origin lay in profound stillness; the Three Luminaries merged their radiance. Flowing essence illuminated the Void; the Eight Assemblies and Four Convergences intermingled in perfect union. They chanted and intoned the Great Nothingness, and the Mysterious Beginning shone forth in clarity. The celestial scenes unfolded in splendor; rivers and seas stilled their waves. The Eight Winds turned their wheels; drifting mists gathered at the Dragon’s Terrace. Floating light spread across the Nine Mysteries; Golden Immortals wielded their halberds, while the Four Directors bore their banners. The Five Thearchs’ spirit-officials, ten billion in number, soared on winged unicorns to guard the Heavenly Perfected.\n\nThe Western Florescence Jade Maidens and Golden Dawn Spirit Lads displayed their cloud-like grace beside the jasper halls, their immortal countenances concealed within the orchid chambers. They scattered numinous incense to dispel impurities and raised refined essence with their dusters. Dragons coursed in pairs through the Purple Palace; venomous beasts brandished their claws at the Jade Gates. Golden-winged birds preened their feathers in the jasper groves; spirit cranes soared and sang amid the clouds.\n\nThe Western Consorts struck the rhythm; Heavenly Maidens arrayed their chimes. Dragons roared and tigers howled; phoenixes danced and simurghs sang. The Four Perfected harmonized their voices; the Eight Sounds rang in unison. Cloud zithers resounded brightly, startling the Three Clarities. Soaring songs and mysterious melodies filled the vast celestial court. Fragrance wafted through the misty clouds; numinous winds dispersed the true essence. Radiant light intertwined; the Three Candles merged their brilliance.\n\nAt this time, the Most High Supreme Lord of the Great Dao donned a robe of nine-colored parted silk, clad in a gown woven with frost-like pearls. His cap transformed in an instant; his sash bore the Morning Light Sun Bell and the Life-Extending Sword. The Falling and Interlacing Sash displayed the Jade Seal and Phoenix Insignia. Flowing gold illuminated the Void; the Seven Essences surged without bound. He rode the Ninefold Numinous, Eightfold Luminous, cloud-borne chariot of azure mist. Following him were three hundred thousand flying immortals beneath feathered canopies of the Mulberry Grove, along with the Purple Void Lads. Their canopies unfurled across the Nine Clouds, turning the heavens and inclining the light. Heavenly Soldiers led the way; the Six Masters brandished their blades. Lightning bolts flashed and essence flared; the Four Illuminations upheld the numinous path. The Five Elders opened the celestial ford; flying banners lined the jasper roads. Their gazes swept the lofty clarity as they ascended to the Nine-Tiered, Sevenfold-Luminous Crimson Palace.\n\nThe Dao Lord took his seat; the Nine Emperors rejoiced in unison. The Three Perfected harmonized their resonance; the Seven Sages shared in delight. Heavenly music rang clear; the Supreme Sage exulted. His mysterious heart filled the Emperor’s tablets; soaring brushstrokes flourished amid the celebratory mists. The spirits thrived in harmony; virtue and emptiness embodied the Mysterious. Dragon patterns gleamed upon the azure abyss; colorful clouds blazed across the Nine Heavens. His lofty visage was bathed in orchid and jade; golden essence emanated from the jasper springs. The Seven Records were inscribed in the Upper Register; the hidden chapters were etched with luminous script. They gathered and bound the submerged brushstrokes, turning the stagnant wheels, weaving together the Five Symbols, and assembling the Supreme Perfected. This was the lofty transmission of the Most High, spreading teachings to all directions.\n\nThereupon, the Seven Sages composed the chapters of the Supreme Mystery, compiling them into numinous texts. The Turtle Mother wielded the brush; the Great One swept the mat. Heavenly Consorts attended with incense; Jade Florescence held the towels. Cinnabar script in purple characters was engraved upon white silver, its hidden numinous resonance bound within the jade chapters. The names of those who attained the Dao were inscribed in green records and entrusted to the Five Elders, the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital. They were stored in the Purple Stamen Jade Case, sealed with the Seal of Command. Three hundred Jade Lads and Maidens each scattered flowers to attend the numinous. The Seven Sages each held a copy; the Western Turtle fixed the records, and the Eastern Florescence verified the names, summoning the immortals of the Five Peaks.\n\nFor later learners who present petitions to the Three Origins and offer records to the Azure Palace, undergoing seven selections in a year, those whose names are listed in the Supreme Clarity shall be inscribed upon the Mysterious Chart and become Perfected Ones of the Great Peace.\n\nThis is the celestial sincerity and mysterious harmony of the Supreme Sages, where luminous virtue unites with the Three Origins. Thus, the Most High issued his decree, recording it in jade script. The Mysterious Accord resounded in hidden song; the radiance of the heavens shone within. The profound and distant resonance of the Cavern Mystery turned in accord with the Mysterious. The lofty model transcended the Three Realms; the cinnabar light soared above the Supreme Perfected. Those who succeeded were inscribed upon the White Tablets and their names bound in the Green Records. The mysterious chart is lofty and wondrous, beyond the expression of brush and ink. This is but a rough sketch of one thousandth part, a brief outline of the distant traces of those who attained the true.\n\nThe *White Tablets and Green Records of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven* were received by the Supreme Sage Emperor Lords from the Nine Voids. They bound the characters of the soaring mysterious purple *qi*, naturally formed, recording the names of later learners who attained the Dao. The numinous sounds harmonized in resonance; jade clarity upheld the true. Some were expressed in written form, others in hidden tones. The Four Convergences above and below all signified the empty birth of the mysterious names, inscribed within the Hall of Vast Numinosity.\n\nThe ancient text contained one hundred thousand jade words, their forms without fixed type, their rhymes without fixed sound. None but the Supreme Sages could fathom their meaning. After seven thousand years, they were inscribed within the northern cavern of the Kunlun Chambers. Each character measured a *zhang* in size; the text blazed with resplendent brilliance. The four directions emitted radiance; empty mists arose, now present, now absent. Flowing light and purple *qi* dispelled impurities; golden essence refined and polished the script. Through countless kalpas, the characters remained fresh and bright.\n\nIn the first year of the Middle August era, on the seventh day of the ninth month, the Seven Sages united their numinous powers. They purified themselves in the Long Palace, swearing oaths to the golden and azure heavens, pledging their reverence. They received the numinous text. The Most High resolved its obstructions; the Seven Sages comprehended its wondrous sounds. They recorded it as the *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven for Attaining the Dao*, inscribed upon white silver tablets, bound with soaring green script. It was stored in a cloud-brocade pouch, sealed with the Seal of Command, and entrusted to the Left Duke of the Five Elders’ Immortal Capital, to be safeguarded in the Jasper Palace.\n\nPursuant to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, this scripture is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. It is examined by the laws of the Four Offices and enforced by the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors. Only those whose names are inscribed upon the Mystic Register may receive this text. Should any recipient recklessly divulge it, calamity shall annihilate nine generations; their sevenfold spirit shall endure eternal torment, their own life forfeit, and they shall be bound in long servitude to the ghostly officials. Though their name may be recorded in the Mystic Register, they shall never ascend as immortals.\n\nThe *Mystic Chronicle of the Seven Sages’ Return to Heaven* is composed in verses that harmonize, its branches and categories interwoven, its characters formed through the convergence of upper and lower elements, or marked by their proper taboo names. Some are single, some compound, all emerging from the primordial caverns of the Mystic Antiquity, compiled by the Most High Sages to elucidate the numinous script. Later scholars whose names are inscribed within its chapters and who receive its precious instructions shall naturally ascend as immortals.\n\nYet there are the Six Harmonies and the Seven Harms: treasure this text, and they align; neglect it, and they vanish. Those destined for this path must exert utmost sincerity, observe prolonged fasts upon sacred mounds, seek out secluded mountains, burn incense and perform rites, recite the scripture morning and evening, cast aside all distracting thoughts, and fix their minds upon the Supreme Perfection. Only then may they attain the descent of the Mystic, ascending in broad daylight to soar through the heavens.\n\nAmong later scholars, some whose names are not inscribed upon the Mystic Register yet obtain the precious scripture—these possess profound virtue from past lives, their boughs casting shade upon their descendants, or they have accrued hidden merit, their aspirations surpassing the multitude. With single-minded devotion and arduous practice, they move the Jade Emperor; the Four Poles bear witness, the Five Peaks record their names, and they encounter a master who bestows the precious text. Should they practice with diligence and avoid the Seven Harms, a Perfected One shall descend to transmit the true scripture, inscribing their name in the Mystic Chronicle. In seven years, they too shall attain immortality.\n\nAll who behold the *Mystic Chronicle of the Most High Sages* possess names destined for immortal flight, their names engraved upon the image of their future lives, inscribed in reverse upon the scrolls of the Mystic Void. Having received the human Dao, their names are selected by the Azure Palace, protected by the Four Offices, expounded by the Five Emperors, concealed within the Jade Void, and rooted in the Purple Web. Their bones bear wondrous radiance, their entire form harmonizing with the immortal realm. The Four Offices descend in secret, bestowing the precious text in darkness. The Supreme Unity fixes their register; the Director of Destinies grants them years. Their souls are steadfast, their spirits at peace, their six viscera congealing the true, and the myriad spirits fully assembled—thus they attain the rank of Supreme Immortal. After seven years of cultivation, the numinous shall descend of itself, and they shall ride the void to ascend in flight.\n\nThe Most High Sage Emperor declares: All who receive the *Mystic Chronicle of the Seven Sages’ Return to the Nine Heavens*, though they have not yet ascended, shall have their names selected by the Azure Palace and reported to the Five Peaks, entrusted to the officials of the sacred mountains, rivers, and seas for their protection. Twelve Jade Lads and twelve Jade Maidens shall attend them, safeguarding the numinous script and serving the scripture in their practice of the true. This Mystic Destiny aligns with the natural order; the Most High Sages inscribe it in reverse upon the True Register, their positions commensurate with those of immortal ministers. When their Dao is complete, the Four Perfected shall visit their chambers, and a cloud chariot shall descend, enabling their ascent in broad daylight. The standards of ascent and the ranks of immortality shall be conferred according to their merit.\n\nThis Dao is profound and subtle, not to be glimpsed or heard through ordinary study. Those who receive it must treasure and conceal it; guard against reckless disclosure.\n\n---\n\n**The Hidden Statutes of the Six Harmonies for Inscribing Names in the Mystic Register and Ascending as Immortals**\nThe Most High Sage Emperor declares: On the first day of the first month, the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the ninth day of the ninth month, and the eleventh day of the eleventh month—these six days of the year are the times when the Celestial Virtue aligns in harmony. The Seven Sages fix the register, the Five Emperors record names, the Western Tortoise inscribes the record, and the Eastern Florescence compiles the scroll.\n\nOn these days, the Primordial Celestial Unity converges in celebration. The Four Offices array their soldiers, the Most High displays their canopy, the Jade Void revolves in paired ranks, the Nine Emperors gird their sashes, the Seven Sages unite their numinous powers, and the myriad Perfected Ones and ten thousand immortals all ascend to the Golden Court. The Three Mornings flank the imperial chariot, the Seven Origins blaze with radiance, heaven and earth are purified, and the Ten Realms stand in solemn clarity. The Nine Heavenly Emperor-Kings dispatch the Inspectors of Perfected Ones; the Most High Seven Sages send the Left Immortal of the Fixed Register; the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise commands the Five Elder Immortal Lords and the Central Perfected of the Western Radiance; the Azure Lad of the Eastern Florescence dispatches the Jade Gentleman of the Leading Immortals. Each division of flying immortals and wheel-borne feathered riders patrols the Ten Heavens and the Five Peaks’ sacred mountains, secretly observing the Cavern Primordials who have already attained the Dao, the wandering immortal officials, and later scholars whose names are inscribed in the register but who have not yet ascended, or whose names are absent from the Mystic Chronicle yet practice with arduous devotion, their sincerity surpassing that of the Jade Void, moving the Jade Emperor.\n\nOn these days, those who study the Dao must purify themselves in fasting, burn incense, cast aside all distracting thoughts, align their wishes with the celestial will, concentrate their minds in earnest contemplation, and cultivate the numinous script. If the Five Emperors commend them, their names shall be inscribed upon the White Register and recorded in the Plain Record. The Four Poles shall then descend to bestow the Supreme Perfection, and in seven years, they shall ride the void and ascend to the dawn heavens.\n\nOn these days, should any treat the celestial treasure with disdain, leak the Mystic Script, or incur the Seven Harms, they shall be seized by the Four Offices. Those whose names are inscribed upon the White Register shall have their names struck from the Azure Record and reassigned to the ghostly officials. Those without prior inscription in the register who encounter the scripture by karmic affinity shall be punished by the Five Emperors with divine soldiers, their seven ancestors seized and condemned to the trials of the River Source’s life-and-death reckoning, as evident as the brightness of the sun.\n\nThus, cultivation depends on the sincerity of the heart, not merely upon having one’s name inscribed in the White Register or the Mystic Chronicle. Only through secrecy and arduous devotion may one attain immortality.\n\nThe Most High Jade Emperor Dao Lord declares: To inscribe one’s name in the White Register and the Mystic Chronicle and ascend to the Jade Clarity’s Upper Palace, one must, at the time of the first day of the first month’s celestial convergence, bathe and purify oneself in fasting. At dawn, enter the chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times to the north, paying homage to the Jade Emperor. After completing the rites, sit facing north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the chamber filled with luxuriant blue clouds enveloping the room. Envision the Five Elder Immortal Lords within the blue clouds, clad in soaring azure feathered robes, crowned with jade diadems that reach the heavens, each holding a register inscribed in blue script. Visualize the Jade Gentleman of the Leading Immortals wearing a cloud-brocade robe, crowned with a seven-jeweled jade coronet, and holding a white silver tablet.\n\nEnvision the Two Perfected Ones inscribing my name upon the tablet, binding my record within the azure-cloud register, and presenting my inscribed tablet to the Overseer of Perfected Beings and the Left Scribe of Destined Records. Let it be submitted to the celestial thrones of the Nine Heavens’ Emperor-Kings and the Seven Sages below, where my name shall be fixed in the register. The Five Elder Immortal Lords and the Jade Gentleman of the Leading Immortals then dissolve into the Hall of Luminosity within my body. Proceed to intone the prayer:\n\n\"On this day of celestial convergence, the Primordial Heaven stands in solemn clarity. The Exalted Canopy of the Highest shines forth as the Jade Emperor descends to the court. The Nine Perfected command the Void; the Seven Sages unite in numinous power. Above, the Mystic Register is examined; my name is inscribed upon the white tablet, engraved into the Primordial Record. The dead are erased; the living are etched. The Western Tortoise binds the scroll; the Azure Florescence of Immortality is preserved. Above, I receive the cap and sash; the Five Forms are radiantly transformed. Feathered robes are bestowed upon me; a green chariot descends. I ascend upon soaring clouds, mounting the Purple Jade. The Three Radiances merge their light; the Seven Origins share their brilliance. I eternally safeguard the Two Modes, Heaven and Earth enduring as one.\"\n\nUpon completion, bow seven times to the Seven Sages and swallow seven breaths of qi to conclude.\n\nThis is the method of the Highest Sacred Scripture for inscribing and submitting one’s name to the Six Harmonies. Practicing it for seven years, even those without a prior name in the Mystic Register shall have their names engraved therein. The Three Origins descend; the Four Poles awaken their numinosity. Naturally, one attains penetrating clarity and ascends in flight to the Grand Clarity.\n\nThe Highest Sacred Emperor-Lord states: The method for inscribing one’s name upon the Mystic Tablet and ascending in body to the Upper Clarity is as follows. At the time of celestial convergence on the third day of the third month, bathe and purify oneself in fasting. At the hour of the meal, enter the chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times to the north, paying homage to the Jade Heaven. After completing the rites, face north, click the teeth twelve times, and visualize the chamber filled with luxuriant purple clouds enveloping the room. Envision the Five Elder Immortal Lords within the purple clouds, clad in soaring azure feathered robes, crowned with jade diadems that reach the heavens, each holding a register inscribed in blue script.

Let it be submitted to the celestial thrones of the Nine Heavens’ Emperor-Kings and the Seven Sages below, where my name shall be fixed in the register. The Five Elder Immortal Lords and the Jade Gentleman of the Leading Immortals then dissolve into the Grotto Chamber within my body. Proceed to recite the incantation:\n\n\"The Primordial Heaven celebrates this auspicious day; the Six Arrays of the Upper Convergence align. The Nine Emperors command their numinosity; the Seven Sages unfold the Perfected. The Register of the Empty Mystery is recorded; the Eastern Florescence binds the scroll. My name is engraved upon the Emperor’s tablet, eternally safeguarding my ascent as an Upper Immortal. Sound and harmony unite; my body becomes natural. The Purple Womb and Jade Essence flourish; the inner brilliance of jade and coral shines forth. My countenance radiates golden splendor; my bones transform like silver. Wondrous hairs of rare hues entwine above and below. The Mystic descends from the Nine Heavens; I turn the Purple Chariot of Heaven. The Six Directions and Five Dragons ascend to the Emperor’s dawn. The Three Origins converge in celebration; may all be as spoken.\"\n\nUpon completion, bow seven times to the Seven Sages and swallow seven breaths of qi to conclude.

The Three Origins descend, enabling one to tread the Void and ascend to the Upper Clarity.\n\nThe Highest Sacred Emperor states: The method for engraving one’s name upon the Mystic Register of Stone and turning the Nine Heavens is as follows. At the time of celestial convergence on the fifth day of the fifth month, bathe and purify oneself in fasting.

Let it be submitted to the celestial thrones of the Nine Heavens’ Emperor-Kings and the Seven Sages below, where my name shall be fixed in the register. The Five Elder Immortal Lords and the Jade Gentleman of the Leading Immortals then dissolve into the Crimson Palace within my body. Proceed to recite the incantation:\n\n\"The Vermilion Brilliance of the Southern Cinnabar converges with the Upper Yang. The Primordial Heaven exchanges its meeting; the Six Aspirations flourish within. The Nine Perfected and Seven Sages unite in numinous splendor within the Jade Hall. Above, the Mystic Tablet is engraved; the Western Tone binds the scroll. The correct sound is inscribed; clarity pervades the Four Directions. The cinnabar clouds turn the Heavens; descending, they enter my chamber. Soaring azure feathered banners gleam with radiant light. To my left, I rein the Vermilion Phoenix; to my right, I guide the roaming dragon. The Six Reins rise as one; I transcend to the Flowery Hall.

The practitioner’s own life shall be forfeit, and they shall never again attain immortality.\n\nThose of aspiration must guard this text with utmost secrecy.\n\nThe Most High Emperor Lord says: Later students who diligently cultivate, embodying benevolence and harmony, magnanimity and softness, whose demeanor is vast and whose conduct is accommodating, shall have their names inscribed in the Emperor’s register, their purple characters bound in the jade chapters. Their primordial qi shall be received and awakened in the Spirit Chart, their virtue and power manifesting in union with the immortals. Internally, they shall resonate with the Supreme Ultimate’s illumination; externally, they shall encompass the Great Artisan’s lineage. When their merit is complete and their Dao perfected, they shall naturally ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe Most High Emperor Lord says: Among later students, some may appear refined yet yearn for immortality, diligent in the morning yet lax by evening, desiring inner ascent while clinging to external glory and profit. Some may maintain a disciplined form yet harbor a dissolute mind, or be diligent in heart yet careless in speech. Some may lack broad learning, attacking their teachers and sects, critiquing the myriad things, slandering the worthy and envying the sagely. They may favor some while resenting others, oppressing the weak and flattering the strong. Some may indulge in wine and lust, dissipating their spirit and losing their essence. Some may encounter scriptures without taking vows, secretly reading hidden texts, carelessly revealing numinous secrets to the unworthy, or transmitting without proper authorization, failing to pledge to the Five Peaks. All such acts constitute divulgence, incurring the punishment of the Four Luminaries.\n\nSuch individuals may bear the semblance of immortals, their names inscribed in the Emperor’s chapters, yet their conduct deviates from the root. They shall incur punishment and retribution, implicating their seven ancestors. Their bodies shall be destroyed, and they shall forever lose the Dao of immortality, eternally consigned to ghostly servitude, cycling through the Five Sufferings. What words can express their sorrow?\n\nThe Most High’s Prohibitions on the Seven Injuries to Immortality\n\nFor those students whose names are recorded in the Mysterious Register and whose bodies bear the signs of immortality, naturally aligning with the Perfected, yet whose hearts lack steadfast integrity, the Seven Injuries shall afflict them.\n\nThe First Injury: Cloaking truth with falsehood, indulging in lust and dissipating the spirit, depleting fluids and leaking essence, drying the radiance of vitality, scattering qi and dispersing the po, hollowing the bones and wasting the form. The spirit weeps in the exhausted palaces, ascending to the Heavenly Pass. The true immortals shall journey far away, while demonic spirits shall approach to harass. The self shall be consigned to the dark yin, the name erased from the Mysterious Register. Causes shall be bound in the Nine Prisons, and the Six Heavens shall become kin. Endlessly mired in suffering, how can one ever attain immortality?\n\nThe Second Injury: Outwardly appearing to follow the Dao, superficially embracing the truth, yet harboring a heart of dark malice, inherently cruel and wicked. Desiring others’ failure, envying the capable and resenting the worthy. Speaking sweetly while harboring deceit, appearing joyful while seething within. Critiquing gains and losses, delighting in sowing the seeds of transgression. Slandering and spying on fellow students, attacking the roots of their sects. Recorded by the Three Offices, they shall be marked as gates of evil. The immortals shall abandon them, and malevolent ghosts shall possess their bodies, compelling them to act as shadows and fly as demons. Thus, they shall suffer unjust calamities, their evil karma reaching its extreme. When their punishment is complete, their forms shall perish, and their souls shall sink into the Nine Springs. Though their names may be recorded in the Mysterious Register, how can they preserve their spontaneity?\n\nThe Third Harm: Indulging in wine and craving drunkenness, damaging qi and losing one’s spirit. The Five Palaces fall into chaos, the myriad spirits tremble in shock. Hun and po scatter and flee, inner and outer decay their numinous essence. The original chamber grows desolate, the Red Child wails in sorrow. The perfected immortals ascend far away, demonic spirits enter the body. Though such a one may accumulate sincerity, though their name be recorded in the Mysterious Register, they shall ultimately lose their jade name. Their spirit shall be confined to the Six Palaces, their body reduced to ashes in the dark underworld. Seeking longevity thus, how can their years endure?\n\nThe Fourth Harm: Conduct lacking in magnanimity and purity, demanding reverence from others while harboring resentment in the heart and curses on the tongue, delighting in contention. Joy and anger lack restraint, the nature remains unsettled. Qi surges wildly, scattering the inner perfected. Po departs, hun wanders, inviting calamity and illness. Years and lifespan decline and perish, all due to one’s nature. The perfected immortals ascend on high, while manifold afflictions assail the body. Though one may study diligently, this misfortune cannot be avoided. The hope of immortality grows ever more distant, while the days in hell lengthen.\n\nThe Fifth Harm: Having one’s name appear in the Mysterious Charts and receiving precious scriptures, or encountering a numinous master who imparts divine texts—yet failing to follow the precepts and covenants, revealing Heaven’s true essence. Before nine years have passed, one submits petitions to famous mountains, causing the Azure Palace to record their name and the Golden Watchtower to compile their deeds. Then, transmitting these teachings to others, scattering them among the world, treating the true lightly and leaking the precious. The consequences of this transgression shall bind one’s own body. Though their name may be recorded in the Mysterious Register, it shall instead burden the Seven Mysteries. The immortal Dao ascends on high, while their body dies and sinks into the dark springs, forever bearing ghostly retribution, never to be absolved for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe Sixth Harm: The body treading in filth and impurity, form and shadow lacking fragrance. Within, there is no purity and emptiness; without, no orchid-like fragrance. The Dao does not descend the true, the spirits do not dwell in their chambers. Qi is disturbed, essence is turbid, the numinous origin loses its radiance. The Five Spirits advance and scatter, the Red Child flees. Demonic evil attacks, bringing calamity within and without. Pursuing the Dao thus, seeking benefit only brings harm. The perfected immortals ascend far away, leaving only the corpse to wander alone. Sinking into irredeemable ruin, how can immortality be achieved?\n\nThe Seventh Harm: Consuming flesh that contains blood, slaughtering creatures to satisfy the mouth. Foul stench fills the viscera, harming life and injuring others. True qi is disturbed at the numinous gate, the wandering hun startles the Red Child. Hun and po depart from their palaces, filth and turbidity cling to the mouth and teeth. The perfected immortals abandon them in the clouds, while their own body sinks and stagnates in the earth. Though their name may be recorded in the Emperor’s jade registers, they shall ultimately not escape the death of the form.\n\nThe Most High Sage Emperor says: The foundation of learning lies in urgently guarding against the Seven Harms. Having gained the opportunity to gaze upon the gates of the Grotto-Heavens and peruse the jade scriptures, if one does not violate the prohibitions of the Seven Harms, one may sit and await the descent of the numinous, ascending at dawn on a white sun.\n\nIf, however, one diligently studies outwardly yet inwardly violates the Seven Harms, this shall lead to seeking immortality but instead meeting defeat, hoping for life but instead facing death, desiring fortune but instead encountering misfortune, aspiring to flight but instead sinking. The numinous immortals wander in the highest purity, while the Five Spirits scatter to the eight wilds. The Red Child wails and weeps in the central chamber, the wandering hun laments in the dark emptiness.\n\nThus, the signs of immortality may succeed or fail, and in the highest learning, there are the Seven Harms. Those who earnestly esteem the Dao must thoroughly refine their true essence.\n\nThe Most High Sage Emperor says: Those with jade bones and cinnabar script, whose names are listed in the Emperor’s charts, may behold the *Mysterious Register of the Seven Sages*. Those with golden marrow and purple treasuries, whose names are inscribed on golden tablets, may behold the hidden texts and inner scriptures. Those with extraordinary and wondrous features, purple wombs and jade networks, whose names are marked in the *Highest Clarity*, may behold the *White Tablet Jade Scriptures*. Those whose flowing essence emits purple radiance, whose inner and outer being is numinous, whose precious treasuries hold golden countenances, whose names are inscribed in the *Jade Void*, may behold the texts of the *Azure Register*. Those who are divinely outstanding and respond to the realm, with jade embryos and purple voids, whose names are inscribed in the *Eastern Florescence*, may behold the *Examination Text of the Seven Harms*.\n\nWithout such outstanding qualities, the numinous scriptures must not be rashly perused, nor the precious texts casually viewed. Those who behold these texts possess a mysterious essence that harmonizes with immortality. After nine years of cultivation, they shall attain flight through the dark void, ascending to the *Jade Clarity*.\n\nWhen receiving the *Mysterious Register of the Seven Sages*, the *Nine Skies White Tablet*, or the *Azure Register*, master and disciple shall face each other in purification for ninety days, or thirty days. The disciple shall present seven taels of gold, seventy bolts of purple silk, and seven taels of cinnabar, approaching the master facing north to report their destiny to the Most High Sage. They shall transmit the texts after swearing an oath to Heaven.\n\nIf the master transmits without an oath, lightly leaking the precious texts, or if the disciple receives them without faith, recklessly perusing the jade scriptures, both shall suffer the judgment of the wind-blade, their seven ancestors burdened with retribution. They shall endure the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, never to be absolved for ten thousand kalpas. The divine soldiers of the Five Emperors shall constantly pursue those who leak the texts. Be clear and cautious in upholding these teachings.\n\nHere ends the *Scripture of the Seven Sages’ Mysterious Register for Returning to the Nine Skies of Highest Clarity and Jade Emperor*.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven Scripture**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven Scripture* (abbreviated as *The Seven Sages Mysterious Record*).\nAuthor unknown, approximately composed during the Eastern Jin dynasty. A foundational scripture of the early Supreme Clarity tradition. One fascicle.\nBase text from: *Daoist Canon of the Orthodox Unity Tradition*, Section Zheng Yi.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Clarity Jade Emperor’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven Upper Scripture**\n\nThis is the *Upper Scripture of the Jade Emperor’s Seven Sages Mysterious Record of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven*, wherein the Supreme Sage Emperor Lord established the inception of the Nine Mysteries’ primordial *qi*. The Void and Numinous divided, the Two Modes became manifest, the Nine Origins harmonized in resonance, and the Nine Emperors commanded the spirits, all converging in the Radiant Rosy Palace of the Nine Heavens.\n\nThereupon, the Supreme Sage, in accord with the Jade Void and Purple Guest, returned to the Cinnabar Rosy Wheel of the Nine Heavens, ascending the Nine-Tiered, Sevenfold-Luminous Crimson Palace. They wandered above the Bright Clouds, traversing the desolate expanse of the Nine Voids. The Heavenly Origin lay in profound stillness; the Three Luminaries merged their radiance. Flowing essence illuminated the Void; the Eight Assemblies and Four Convergences intermingled in perfect union. They chanted and intoned the Great Nothingness, and the Mysterious Beginning shone forth in clarity. The celestial scenes unfolded in splendor; rivers and seas stilled their waves. The Eight Winds turned their wheels; drifting mists gathered at the Dragon’s Terrace. Floating light spread across the Nine Mysteries; Golden Immortals wielded their halberds, while the Four Directors bore their banners. The Five Thearchs’ spirit-officials, ten billion in number, soared on winged unicorns to guard the Heavenly Perfected.\n\nThe Western Florescence Jade Maidens and Golden Dawn Spirit Lads displayed their cloud-like grace beside the jasper halls, their immortal countenances concealed within the orchid chambers. They scattered numinous incense to dispel impurities and raised refined essence with their dusters. Dragons coursed in pairs through the Purple Palace; venomous beasts brandished their claws at the Jade Gates. Golden-winged birds preened their feathers in the jasper groves; spirit cranes soared and sang amid the clouds.\n\nThe Western Consorts struck the rhythm; Heavenly Maidens arrayed their chimes. Dragons roared and tigers howled; phoenixes danced and simurghs sang. The Four Perfected harmonized their voices; the Eight Sounds rang in unison. Cloud zithers resounded brightly, startling the Three Clarities. Soaring songs and mysterious melodies filled the vast celestial court. Fragrance wafted through the misty clouds; numinous winds dispersed the true essence. Radiant light intertwined; the Three Candles merged their brilliance.\n\nAt this time, the Most High Supreme Lord of the Great Dao donned a robe of nine-colored parted silk, clad in a gown woven with frost-like pearls. His cap transformed in an instant; his sash bore the Morning Light Sun Bell and the Life-Extending Sword. The Falling and Interlacing Sash displayed the Jade Seal and Phoenix Insignia. Flowing gold illuminated the Void; the Seven Essences surged without bound. He rode the Ninefold Numinous, Eightfold Luminous, cloud-borne chariot of azure mist. Following him were three hundred thousand flying immortals beneath feathered canopies of the Mulberry Grove, along with the Purple Void Lads. Their canopies unfurled across the Nine Clouds, turning the heavens and inclining the light. Heavenly Soldiers led the way; the Six Masters brandished their blades. Lightning bolts flashed and essence flared; the Four Illuminations upheld the numinous path. The Five Elders opened the celestial ford; flying banners lined the jasper roads. Their gazes swept the lofty clarity as they ascended to the Nine-Tiered, Sevenfold-Luminous Crimson Palace.\n\nThe Dao Lord took his seat; the Nine Emperors rejoiced in unison. The Three Perfected harmonized their resonance; the Seven Sages shared in delight. Heavenly music rang clear; the Supreme Sage exulted. His mysterious heart filled the Emperor’s tablets; soaring brushstrokes flourished amid the celebratory mists. The spirits thrived in harmony; virtue and emptiness embodied the Mysterious. Dragon patterns gleamed upon the azure abyss; colorful clouds blazed across the Nine Heavens. His lofty visage was bathed in orchid and jade; golden essence emanated from the jasper springs. The Seven Records were inscribed in the Upper Register; the hidden chapters were etched with luminous script. They gathered and bound the submerged brushstrokes, turning the stagnant wheels, weaving together the Five Symbols, and assembling the Supreme Perfected. This was the lofty transmission of the Most High, spreading teachings to all directions.\n\nThereupon, the Seven Sages composed the chapters of the Supreme Mystery, compiling them into numinous texts. The Turtle Mother wielded the brush; the Great One swept the mat. Heavenly Consorts attended with incense; Jade Florescence held the towels. Cinnabar script in purple characters was engraved upon white silver, its hidden numinous resonance bound within the jade chapters. The names of those who attained the Dao were inscribed in green records and entrusted to the Five Elders, the Left Duke of the Immortal Capital. They were stored in the Purple Stamen Jade Case, sealed with the Seal of Command. Three hundred Jade Lads and Maidens each scattered flowers to attend the numinous. The Seven Sages each held a copy; the Western Turtle fixed the records, and the Eastern Florescence verified the names, summoning the immortals of the Five Peaks.\n\nFor later learners who present petitions to the Three Origins and offer records to the Azure Palace, undergoing seven selections in a year, those whose names are listed in the Supreme Clarity shall be inscribed upon the Mysterious Chart and become Perfected Ones of the Great Peace.\n\nThis is the celestial sincerity and mysterious harmony of the Supreme Sages, where luminous virtue unites with the Three Origins. Thus, the Most High issued his decree, recording it in jade script. The Mysterious Accord resounded in hidden song; the radiance of the heavens shone within. The profound and distant resonance of the Cavern Mystery turned in accord with the Mysterious. The lofty model transcended the Three Realms; the cinnabar light soared above the Supreme Perfected. Those who succeeded were inscribed upon the White Tablets and their names bound in the Green Records. The mysterious chart is lofty and wondrous, beyond the expression of brush and ink. This is but a rough sketch of one thousandth part, a brief outline of the distant traces of those who attained the true.\n\nThe *White Tablets and Green Records of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven* were received by the Supreme Sage Emperor Lords from the Nine Voids. They bound the characters of the soaring mysterious purple *qi*, naturally formed, recording the names of later learners who attained the Dao. The numinous sounds harmonized in resonance; jade clarity upheld the true. Some were expressed in written form, others in hidden tones. The Four Convergences above and below all signified the empty birth of the mysterious names, inscribed within the Hall of Vast Numinosity.\n\nThe ancient text contained one hundred thousand jade words, their forms without fixed type, their rhymes without fixed sound. None but the Supreme Sages could fathom their meaning. After seven thousand years, they were inscribed within the northern cavern of the Kunlun Chambers. Each character measured a *zhang* in size; the text blazed with resplendent brilliance. The four directions emitted radiance; empty mists arose, now present, now absent. Flowing light and purple *qi* dispelled impurities; golden essence refined and polished the script. Through countless kalpas, the characters remained fresh and bright.\n\nIn the first year of the Middle August era, on the seventh day of the ninth month, the Seven Sages united their numinous powers. They purified themselves in the Long Palace, swearing oaths to the golden and azure heavens, pledging their reverence. They received the numinous text. The Most High resolved its obstructions; the Seven Sages comprehended its wondrous sounds. They recorded it as the *Scripture of the Nine Heavens’ Return to Heaven for Attaining the Dao*, inscribed upon white silver tablets, bound with soaring green script. It was stored in a cloud-brocade pouch, sealed with the Seal of Command, and entrusted to the Left Duke of the Five Elders’ Immortal Capital, to be safeguarded in the Jasper Palace.",

      "translated_text": "Pursuant to the *Luminous Statutes of the Four Poles*, this scripture is transmitted but once in ten thousand kalpas. It is examined by the laws of the Four Offices and enforced by the divine soldiers of the Five Emperors. Only those whose names are inscribed upon the Mystic Register may receive this text. Should any recipient recklessly divulge it, calamity shall annihilate nine generations; their sevenfold spirit shall endure eternal torment, their own life forfeit, and they shall be bound in long servitude to the ghostly officials. Though their name may be recorded in the Mystic Register, they shall never ascend as immortals.\n\nThe *Mystic Chronicle of the Seven Sages’ Return to Heaven* is composed in verses that harmonize, its branches and categories interwoven, its characters formed through the convergence of upper and lower elements, or marked by their proper taboo names. Some are single, some compound, all emerging from the primordial caverns of the Mystic Antiquity, compiled by the Most High Sages to elucidate the numinous script. Later scholars whose names are inscribed within its chapters and who receive its precious instructions shall naturally ascend as immortals.\n\nYet there are the Six Harmonies and the Seven Harms: treasure this text, and they align; neglect it, and they vanish. Those destined for this path must exert utmost sincerity, observe prolonged fasts upon sacred mounds, seek out secluded mountains, burn incense and perform rites, recite the scripture morning and evening, cast aside all distracting thoughts, and fix their minds upon the Supreme Perfection. Only then may they attain the descent of the Mystic, ascending in broad daylight to soar through the heavens.\n\nAmong later scholars, some whose names are not inscribed upon the Mystic Register yet obtain the precious scripture—these possess profound virtue from past lives, their boughs casting shade upon their descendants, or they have accrued hidden merit, their aspirations surpassing the multitude. With single-minded devotion and arduous practice, they move the Jade Emperor; the Four Poles bear witness, the Five Peaks record their names, and they encounter a master who bestows the precious text. Should they practice with diligence and avoid the Seven Harms, a Perfected One shall descend to transmit the true scripture, inscribing their name in the Mystic Chronicle. In seven years, they too shall attain immortality.\n\nAll who behold the *Mystic Chronicle of the Most High Sages* possess names destined for immortal flight, their names engraved upon the image of their future lives, inscribed in reverse upon the scrolls of the Mystic Void. Having received the human Dao, their names are selected by the Azure Palace, protected by the Four Offices, expounded by the Five Emperors, concealed within the Jade Void, and rooted in the Purple Web. Their bones bear wondrous radiance, their entire form harmonizing with the immortal realm. The Four Offices descend in secret, bestowing the precious text in darkness. The Supreme Unity fixes their register; the Director of Destinies grants them years. Their souls are steadfast, their spirits at peace, their six viscera congealing the true, and the myriad spirits fully assembled—thus they attain the rank of Supreme Immortal. After seven years of cultivation, the numinous shall descend of itself, and they shall ride the void to ascend in flight.\n\nThe Most High Sage Emperor declares: All who receive the *Mystic Chronicle of the Seven Sages’ Return to the Nine Heavens*, though they have not yet ascended, shall have their names selected by the Azure Palace and reported to the Five Peaks, entrusted to the officials of the sacred mountains, rivers, and seas for their protection. Twelve Jade Lads and twelve Jade Maidens shall attend them, safeguarding the numinous script and serving the scripture in their practice of the true. This Mystic Destiny aligns with the natural order; the Most High Sages inscribe it in reverse upon the True Register, their positions commensurate with those of immortal ministers. When their Dao is complete, the Four Perfected shall visit their chambers, and a cloud chariot shall descend, enabling their ascent in broad daylight. The standards of ascent and the ranks of immortality shall be conferred according to their merit.\n\nThis Dao is profound and subtle, not to be glimpsed or heard through ordinary study. Those who receive it must treasure and conceal it; guard against reckless disclosure.\n\n---\n\n**The Hidden Statutes of the Six Harmonies for Inscribing Names in the Mystic Register and Ascending as Immortals**\nThe Most High Sage Emperor declares: On the first day of the first month, the third day of the third month, the fifth day of the fifth month, the seventh day of the seventh month, the ninth day of the ninth month, and the eleventh day of the eleventh month—these six days of the year are the times when the Celestial Virtue aligns in harmony. The Seven Sages fix the register, the Five Emperors record names, the Western Tortoise inscribes the record, and the Eastern Florescence compiles the scroll.\n\nOn these days, the Primordial Celestial Unity converges in celebration. The Four Offices array their soldiers, the Most High displays their canopy, the Jade Void revolves in paired ranks, the Nine Emperors gird their sashes, the Seven Sages unite their numinous powers, and the myriad Perfected Ones and ten thousand immortals all ascend to the Golden Court. The Three Mornings flank the imperial chariot, the Seven Origins blaze with radiance, heaven and earth are purified, and the Ten Realms stand in solemn clarity. The Nine Heavenly Emperor-Kings dispatch the Inspectors of Perfected Ones; the Most High Seven Sages send the Left Immortal of the Fixed Register; the Queen Mother of the Western Tortoise commands the Five Elder Immortal Lords and the Central Perfected of the Western Radiance; the Azure Lad of the Eastern Florescence dispatches the Jade Gentleman of the Leading Immortals. Each division of flying immortals and wheel-borne feathered riders patrols the Ten Heavens and the Five Peaks’ sacred mountains, secretly observing the Cavern Primordials who have already attained the Dao, the wandering immortal officials, and later scholars whose names are inscribed in the register but who have not yet ascended, or whose names are absent from the Mystic Chronicle yet practice with arduous devotion, their sincerity surpassing that of the Jade Void, moving the Jade Emperor.\n\nOn these days, those who study the Dao must purify themselves in fasting, burn incense, cast aside all distracting thoughts, align their wishes with the celestial will, concentrate their minds in earnest contemplation, and cultivate the numinous script. If the Five Emperors commend them, their names shall be inscribed upon the White Register and recorded in the Plain Record. The Four Poles shall then descend to bestow the Supreme Perfection, and in seven years, they shall ride the void and ascend to the dawn heavens.\n\nOn these days, should any treat the celestial treasure with disdain, leak the Mystic Script, or incur the Seven Harms, they shall be seized by the Four Offices. Those whose names are inscribed upon the White Register shall have their names struck from the Azure Record and reassigned to the ghostly officials. Those without prior inscription in the register who encounter the scripture by karmic affinity shall be punished by the Five Emperors with divine soldiers, their seven ancestors seized and condemned to the trials of the River Source’s life-and-death reckoning, as evident as the brightness of the sun.\n\nThus, cultivation depends on the sincerity of the heart, not merely upon having one’s name inscribed in the White Register or the Mystic Chronicle. Only through secrecy and arduous devotion may one attain immortality.\n\nThe Most High Jade Emperor Dao Lord declares: To inscribe one’s name in the White Register and the Mystic Chronicle and ascend to the Jade Clarity’s Upper Palace, one must, at the time of the first day of the first month’s celestial convergence, bathe and purify oneself in fasting. At dawn, enter the chamber, burn incense, and bow nine times to the north, paying homage to the Jade Emperor. After completing the rites, sit facing north, click the teeth nine times, and visualize the chamber filled with luxuriant blue clouds enveloping the room. Envision the Five Elder Immortal Lords within the blue clouds, clad in soaring azure feathered robes, crowned with jade diadems that reach the heavens, each holding a register inscribed in blue script. Visualize the Jade Gentleman of the Leading Immortals wearing a cloud-brocade robe, crowned with a seven-jeweled jade coronet, and holding a white silver tablet.",

The Five Thearchs shall support and protect them, and immortal officials shall respectfully welcome them. Their bodies shall emit purple qi, and a halo shall encircle their heads, illuminating even the obscure. Seated, they shall perceive spontaneity. After nine years, the numinous shall descend, and the Three Primordials shall visit their chambers. A numinous chariot with feathered canopy shall welcome their bodies to fly through the Mysterious Void, their rank elevated in the Immortal Realm.\n\nIf kept secret, the numinous shall descend; if divulged, the body shall perish. Practicing falsely or without sincerity shall implicate the seven ancestors in punishment, never to be absolved. The practitioner’s own life shall be forfeit, and they shall never again attain immortality.\n\nThose of aspiration must guard this text with utmost secrecy.\n\nThe Most High Emperor Lord says: Later students who diligently cultivate, embodying benevolence and harmony, magnanimity and softness, whose demeanor is vast and whose conduct is accommodating, shall have their names inscribed in the Emperor’s register, their purple characters bound in the jade chapters. Their primordial qi shall be received and awakened in the Spirit Chart, their virtue and power manifesting in union with the immortals. Internally, they shall resonate with the Supreme Ultimate’s illumination; externally, they shall encompass the Great Artisan’s lineage. When their merit is complete and their Dao perfected, they shall naturally ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\n\nThe Most High Emperor Lord says: Among later students, some may appear refined yet yearn for immortality, diligent in the morning yet lax by evening, desiring inner ascent while clinging to external glory and profit. Some may maintain a disciplined form yet harbor a dissolute mind, or be diligent in heart yet careless in speech. Some may lack broad learning, attacking their teachers and sects, critiquing the myriad things, slandering the worthy and envying the sagely. They may favor some while resenting others, oppressing the weak and flattering the strong. Some may indulge in wine and lust, dissipating their spirit and losing their essence. Some may encounter scriptures without taking vows, secretly reading hidden texts, carelessly revealing numinous secrets to the unworthy, or transmitting without proper authorization, failing to pledge to the Five Peaks. All such acts constitute divulgence, incurring the punishment of the Four Luminaries.\n\nSuch individuals may bear the semblance of immortals, their names inscribed in the Emperor’s chapters, yet their conduct deviates from the root. They shall incur punishment and retribution, implicating their seven ancestors. Their bodies shall be destroyed, and they shall forever lose the Dao of immortality, eternally consigned to ghostly servitude, cycling through the Five Sufferings. What words can express their sorrow?\n\nThe Most High’s Prohibitions on the Seven Injuries to Immortality\n\nFor those students whose names are recorded in the Mysterious Register and whose bodies bear the signs of immortality, naturally aligning with the Perfected, yet whose hearts lack steadfast integrity, the Seven Injuries shall afflict them.\n\nThe First Injury: Cloaking truth with falsehood, indulging in lust and dissipating the spirit, depleting fluids and leaking essence, drying the radiance of vitality, scattering qi and dispersing the po, hollowing the bones and wasting the form. The spirit weeps in the exhausted palaces, ascending to the Heavenly Pass. The true immortals shall journey far away, while demonic spirits shall approach to harass. The self shall be consigned to the dark yin, the name erased from the Mysterious Register. Causes shall be bound in the Nine Prisons, and the Six Heavens shall become kin. Endlessly mired in suffering, how can one ever attain immortality?\n\nThe Second Injury: Outwardly appearing to follow the Dao, superficially embracing the truth, yet harboring a heart of dark malice, inherently cruel and wicked. Desiring others’ failure, envying the capable and resenting the worthy. Speaking sweetly while harboring deceit, appearing joyful while seething within. Critiquing gains and losses, delighting in sowing the seeds of transgression. Slandering and spying on fellow students, attacking the roots of their sects. Recorded by the Three Offices, they shall be marked as gates of evil. The immortals shall abandon them, and malevolent ghosts shall possess their bodies, compelling them to act as shadows and fly as demons. Thus, they shall suffer unjust calamities, their evil karma reaching its extreme. When their punishment is complete, their forms shall perish, and their souls shall sink into the Nine Springs. Though their names may be recorded in the Mysterious Register, how can they preserve their spontaneity?",

      "translated_text": "The Third Harm: Indulging in wine and craving drunkenness, damaging qi and losing one’s spirit. The Five Palaces fall into chaos, the myriad spirits tremble in shock. Hun and po scatter and flee, inner and outer decay their numinous essence. The original chamber grows desolate, the Red Child wails in sorrow. The perfected immortals ascend far away, demonic spirits enter the body. Though such a one may accumulate sincerity, though their name be recorded in the Mysterious Register, they shall ultimately lose their jade name. Their spirit shall be confined to the Six Palaces, their body reduced to ashes in the dark underworld. Seeking longevity thus, how can their years endure?\n\nThe Fourth Harm: Conduct lacking in magnanimity and purity, demanding reverence from others while harboring resentment in the heart and curses on the tongue, delighting in contention. Joy and anger lack restraint, the nature remains unsettled. Qi surges wildly, scattering the inner perfected. Po departs, hun wanders, inviting calamity and illness. Years and lifespan decline and perish, all due to one’s nature. The perfected immortals ascend on high, while manifold afflictions assail the body. Though one may study diligently, this misfortune cannot be avoided. The hope of immortality grows ever more distant, while the days in hell lengthen.\n\nThe Fifth Harm: Having one’s name appear in the Mysterious Charts and receiving precious scriptures, or encountering a numinous master who imparts divine texts—yet failing to follow the precepts and covenants, revealing Heaven’s true essence. Before nine years have passed, one submits petitions to famous mountains, causing the Azure Palace to record their name and the Golden Watchtower to compile their deeds. Then, transmitting these teachings to others, scattering them among the world, treating the true lightly and leaking the precious. The consequences of this transgression shall bind one’s own body. Though their name may be recorded in the Mysterious Register, it shall instead burden the Seven Mysteries. The immortal Dao ascends on high, while their body dies and sinks into the dark springs, forever bearing ghostly retribution, never to be absolved for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThe Sixth Harm: The body treading in filth and impurity, form and shadow lacking fragrance. Within, there is no purity and emptiness; without, no orchid-like fragrance. The Dao does not descend the true, the spirits do not dwell in their chambers. Qi is disturbed, essence is turbid, the numinous origin loses its radiance. The Five Spirits advance and scatter, the Red Child flees. Demonic evil attacks, bringing calamity within and without. Pursuing the Dao thus, seeking benefit only brings harm. The perfected immortals ascend far away, leaving only the corpse to wander alone. Sinking into irredeemable ruin, how can immortality be achieved?\n\nThe Seventh Harm: Consuming flesh that contains blood, slaughtering creatures to satisfy the mouth. Foul stench fills the viscera, harming life and injuring others. True qi is disturbed at the numinous gate, the wandering hun startles the Red Child. Hun and po depart from their palaces, filth and turbidity cling to the mouth and teeth. The perfected immortals abandon them in the clouds, while their own body sinks and stagnates in the earth. Though their name may be recorded in the Emperor’s jade registers, they shall ultimately not escape the death of the form.\n\nThe Most High Sage Emperor says: The foundation of learning lies in urgently guarding against the Seven Harms. Having gained the opportunity to gaze upon the gates of the Grotto-Heavens and peruse the jade scriptures, if one does not violate the prohibitions of the Seven Harms, one may sit and await the descent of the numinous, ascending at dawn on a white sun.\n\nIf, however, one diligently studies outwardly yet inwardly violates the Seven Harms, this shall lead to seeking immortality but instead meeting defeat, hoping for life but instead facing death, desiring fortune but instead encountering misfortune, aspiring to flight but instead sinking. The numinous immortals wander in the highest purity, while the Five Spirits scatter to the eight wilds. The Red Child wails and weeps in the central chamber, the wandering hun laments in the dark emptiness.\n\nThus, the signs of immortality may succeed or fail, and in the highest learning, there are the Seven Harms. Those who earnestly esteem the Dao must thoroughly refine their true essence.\n\nThe Most High Sage Emperor says: Those with jade bones and cinnabar script, whose names are listed in the Emperor’s charts, may behold the *Mysterious Register of the Seven Sages*. Those with golden marrow and purple treasuries, whose names are inscribed on golden tablets, may behold the hidden texts and inner scriptures. Those with extraordinary and wondrous features, purple wombs and jade networks, whose names are marked in the *Highest Clarity*, may behold the *White Tablet Jade Scriptures*. Those whose flowing essence emits purple radiance, whose inner and outer being is numinous, whose precious treasuries hold golden countenances, whose names are inscribed in the *Jade Void*, may behold the texts of the *Azure Register*. Those who are divinely outstanding and respond to the realm, with jade embryos and purple voids, whose names are inscribed in the *Eastern Florescence*, may behold the *Examination Text of the Seven Harms*.\n\nWithout such outstanding qualities, the numinous scriptures must not be rashly perused, nor the precious texts casually viewed. Those who behold these texts possess a mysterious essence that harmonizes with immortality. After nine years of cultivation, they shall attain flight through the dark void, ascending to the *Jade Clarity*.\n\nWhen receiving the *Mysterious Register of the Seven Sages*, the *Nine Skies White Tablet*, or the *Azure Register*, master and disciple shall face each other in purification for ninety days, or thirty days. The disciple shall present seven taels of gold, seventy bolts of purple silk, and seven taels of cinnabar, approaching the master facing north to report their destiny to the Most High Sage. They shall transmit the texts after swearing an oath to Heaven.\n\nIf the master transmits without an oath, lightly leaking the precious texts, or if the disciple receives them without faith, recklessly perusing the jade scriptures, both shall suffer the judgment of the wind-blade, their seven ancestors burdened with retribution. They shall endure the Three Paths and Five Sufferings, never to be absolved for ten thousand kalpas. The divine soldiers of the Five Emperors shall constantly pursue those who leak the texts. Be clear and cautious in upholding these teachings.\n\nHere ends the *Scripture of the Seven Sages’ Mysterious Register for Returning to the Nine Skies of Highest Clarity and Jade Emperor*.",
      "overlap_context": "orded by the Three Offices, they shall be marked as gates of evil. The immortals shall abandon them, and malevolent ghosts shall possess their bodies, compelling them to act as shadows and fly as demons. Thus, they shall suffer unjust calamities, their evil karma reaching its extreme. When their punishment is complete, their forms shall perish, and their souls shall sink into the Nine Springs. Though their names may be recorded in the Mysterious Register, how can they preserve their spontaneity?",
