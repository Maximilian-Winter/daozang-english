  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Lord’s Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal for Deliverance from the Nine Hells**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord’s Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal for Deliverance from the Nine Hells*. Author unknown, approximately composed between the Tang and Song dynasties. Attributed to the Primordial Celestial Worthy, who expounds to the Perfected One of Salvation the method for liberating sentient beings from the roots of sin and purifying body and mind. One fascicle. Base text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, *Dongzhen* Section, *Benwen* Category.\n\n---\n\n**The Supreme Lord’s Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal for Deliverance from the Nine Hells**\n\nAt that time, the Primordial Celestial Worthy sat upon a seven-jeweled dais, radiating great luminosity that illumined the three thousand great thousandfold worlds. Beholding sentient beings enduring manifold sufferings, drowning in the cycle of birth and death, and receiving endless retribution, the Perfected One of Salvation arose from his seat, gazed reverently upon the Celestial Worthy’s countenance, knelt in obeisance, and inquired:\n\n“By what causes and conditions do these sentient beings drift upon the bitter sea, sinking without end?”\n\nThe Celestial Worthy replied: “Such beings suffer all manner of evil karma, all arising from their own minds. Deluded and inverted in thought, they fail to awaken to non-action. All roots of sin arise from the mind; the joys of heaven are born of the mind’s freedom, and the sinking into the Three Realms likewise arises from the mind.\n\nWhen the mind gives rise to perverse views, deluded thoughts and anger arise. When the mind is confused and disordered, false notions take hold. When the mind harbors killing and harm, it receives manifold forms of existence. When the mind is deceitful and crooked, it shares no affinity with the Dao. When the mind is empty and still, it draws near to the Dao.”\n\nReiterating this meaning, he proclaimed a gatha:\n\nThe Great Dao is vast and clear,\nIts primordial principle profound and obscure.\nBorn before heaven, it governs past and present.\nThe Dao has no form or body,\nYet clarifies body and mind.\nNo greed, no desire,\nNo anger, no lust.\nRight and wrong are unrecognized,\nYet within and without, one seeks.\nBody and mind pure and still,\nAfflictions cannot invade.\nNo arising, no ceasing,\nAbstruse and unfathomable.\nSerene, empty, and quiescent,\nThe original mind is realized.\nNaturally in accord with the Dao,\nAll sages come to revere.\nAscending to the Golden Towers,\nRoaming the celestial groves.\nSeven generations of ancestors are liberated,\nForever escaping the dark shades.\nAll align with the Heart Seal,\nAwakening to the Dao and uniting with the Real.\nThought after thought in succession,\nLet no dust-mind arise.\n\nAt that time, the suffering sentient beings who heard this wondrous scripture were all delivered. The assembled perfected beings bowed in reverence, rejoicing greatly, extolling and praising, and vowed to uphold the teachings.\n\n**Thus concludes *The Supreme Lord’s Wondrous Scripture of the Heart Seal for Deliverance from the Nine Hells*.**",
