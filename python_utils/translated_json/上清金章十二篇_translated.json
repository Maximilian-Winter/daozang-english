  "full_translation": "**The Twelve Golden Hymns of Supreme Purity**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Twelve Golden Hymns of Supreme Purity*\nAuthor unknown, likely composed during the Northern and Southern Dynasties or the Sui-Tang period. Contains twelve hymns of Supreme Purity, also found in *The Hymns and Eulogies of the Perfected of Supreme Purity*. Source text: *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*.\n\n---\n\n**The Twelve Golden Hymns of Supreme Purity**\n\nGazing in repose at the Palace of Great Radiance,\nGolden towers gleam in the Purple Clarity.\nThe immortal chambers feast on Primordial Simplicity,\nFour casements all of crimson jasper.\n\nTossing wheels across the Void Crossing,\nReining reins to dance the Green Chariot.\nJade blossoms fly as cloud-canopies,\nThe Western Consort unfurls her brocade banner.\n\nBeyond the dust and filth, in a flash,\nShe arrives at the court of the radiant maiden.\nLong-awaited resonance calls her forth,\nHer attainment already hidden in the unseen.\n\nRiding the wind toward the Nine Empyreans,\nTogether they revel in the peace of cinnabar splendor.\nTurning to renounce the things of the world,\nHow could they know the numinous within the void?\n\nNorthward they ascend the Gate of Dark Mystery,\nHand in hand traversing the Lofty Web.\nIncense smoke scatters across the Eight Sceneries,\nThe Dark Wind stirs the crimson waves.\n\nLooking up, they transcend the Luminous Crossing,\nGazing down upon the winding valleys.\nSinging and chanting above the clouds,\nPhoenixes cry amidst the ninefold rosy mists.\n\nRiding qi, they float through the Great Void—\nWhy tread the mountain slopes?\nWith golden tablets, they summon the feathered spirits,\nTheir armies crushing the myriad demons.\n\nRinsing and drawing from the round morning glow,\nAccumulating spring to nurture the infant’s teeth.\nAmidst the clamor of competition,\nThey remain untroubled, at ease.\n\nThe northern mounds brim with rosy mists,\nCrimson trees bear purple blossoms.\nAzure herbs fall in the Phoenix Grove,\nEmerald [ ] adorns the rocky cliffs.\n\nThe numinous pavilion soars into the Great Void,\nJasper chambers mingle with the Supreme Radiance.\nClouds rise within the winding chambers,\nEight winds fly through the dark sands.\n\nThe nine-stringed zither plays the Emperor’s ramparts,\nDragons roar in harmonious measure.\nFanning the gales across the Five Peaks,\nWielding the tablets, they subdue the ten thousand [demons].\n\nIn a fleeting glance,\nSuddenly, the eon has passed.\nAlas, those born at dawn—\nHow could they know the span of ages?\n\nThe Cornered Radiance dwells in the [Forest] Palace,\nMoving the spirit through the silent and profound.\nThe supreme vision illumines the Six Courts,\nGreat and small all attain carefree wandering.\n\nDragon pipes entwine the canopy of clouds,\nTiger roars startle the myriad branches.\nThe Three Simplicities unveil the lofty chart,\nCinnabar mists flourish in the morning sky.\n\nFeathered banners cross the Numinous Ford,\nPurple chariots soar with flowered plumes.\nReining reins beyond the Nine Heavens,\nLooking up and down, they roam the boundless.\n\nDust and foam congeal into clamor and defilement,\nThe spirit perishes, qi withers away.\nWhy not seek the distant journey?\nEight thousand years are but a single morning.\n\nAt dawn, they ford the azure sea’s waves,\nFlying wheels depart the green chambers.\nSinging the ode to kindred companions,\nThey soar beyond the azure vastness.\n\nThree pacts with the jade-sky guests,\nFive covenants with the Eastern Florescence youths.\nFeathered gales ascend the Emperor’s dawn,\nFeasting in the Palace of Broad Cold.\n\nEight tones plucked in the empty center,\nPurple phoenixes sing the numinous wind.\nCrimson mists veil the bright radiance,\nEight sceneries fly through the Great Void.\n\nChewing the jasper springs,\nVast and luminous, they return to infancy.\nSupreme joy unites the Five Spirits,\nAges accumulate like blades of grass.\n\nShedding the mundane—what difficulty?\nToil and sorrow drain the celestial harmony.\n\nAt dawn, they harness the morning’s brilliance,\nLoosening reins from the Purple Clarity.\nFloating clouds race through the Great Radiance,\nRaising canopies in the Broad Cold’s court.\n\nThe exalted Perfected guard the Emperor’s chambers,\nPalace ponds draw the Western Numinous.\nTen absolutes in the Five Void Caverns,\nFlying mists coil around brocade screens.\n\nTigers fan the divine winds,\nPurple clouds wheel the dragon chariots.\nIn an instant, they traverse the Eight Directions—\nA single glance, and the eon has passed.\n\nThe flute echoes the Mystic Contestant—\nWhy not seek the Great Life?\nThe divine gardens bloom with hidden herbs,\nThe Kun Pool irrigates the fields of vision.\n\nLooking up at the Jade Clarity’s gates,\nTowering above the Crimson Ford.\nPurple mists reflect the winding mats,\nFive clouds gleam upon the Nine Profundities.\n\nEight winds rise in the distant realms,\nMysterious mists linger between the green casements.\nThe Three Origins dwell in the Western Palace,\nThe Eastern Florescence holds fair maidens.\n\nThe Northern Darkness sings the Seven Whistles,\nThe Luminous Consort chants the Southern Perfected.\nStriking the chime, they harmonize with the Vermilion Pitch,\nJade tablets raise the six strings.\n\nIn perfect accord, they rest beyond fate,\nTogether ascending the Broad Phoenix’s peak.\nUnited in purpose, they command the myriad demons,\nDwelling amidst the host of dark thousands.\n\nHow effortless their transcendence—\nThus they unlock boundless years.\n\nRiding qi, they gaze upon the Void Crossing,\nHarnessing the light, they rest in the Nine Heavens.\nVibrant plumes stir the vast radiance,\nThe dark canopy arises in the spaceless.\n\nEight mists swirl through the boundless wheels,\nTheir paths untethered, time unpermitted.\nStriking the chime, the eight voids resound—\nMy steed, too, knows no ford.\n\nWielding the tablet, they enter the Eastern Florescence,\nFeasting at dusk on the Dark Garden’s peak.\nGirding sashes, they lead the Five Numinous,\nLoosening pendants, they soar with the fair ones.\n\nMysterious resonance follows its course,\nFloating freely, they too have their destiny.\nTogether they mount the soaring wings,\nA single flap stirs billions.\n\nDescending light drifts upon the dark radiance,\nPurple chariots ride the clouds in procession.\nLooking up within the Golden Gates,\nGazing down upon the Western Florescence City.\n\nThe Eastern Florescence unfurls the Five Lights,\nDivine radiance illumines the Seven Numinous.\nVeiled reflections of the Three Banks’ torches,\nFlowing freely, they equal the dark and light.\n\nWinds drum the Void Crossing’s halls,\nIncense smoke scatters in the jade courts.\nHand in hand with the Weaving Maiden,\nTwin sashes fall in brocade green.\n\nPrimal cycles entwine the feathered banners,\nFlowered canopies follow the clouds’ tilt.\nFeasting beyond the Nine Cycles,\nRight and wrong no longer concern them.\n\nEmbracing the void within the Mud-Pellet,\nTheir celestial forms grow ever more youthful.\nHow much worse the defilements of the world—\nWithin, sorrow and desolation breed.\n\nThe Fusang’s emerald peaks,\nVermilion clouds bloom faintly bright.\nThe Wave Terrace rests in the empty heights,\nFour vistas mirror the lofty clarity.\n\nFlying light reins the purple wheels,\nThree Simplicities guide the cinnabar chariots.\nReclining in the Supreme Emperor’s halls,\nTowering in the Mother’s courts.\n\nWashing feet in the azure rapids,\nHolding covenants with jasper wine jars.\nAt dawn’s curve, riding the wind’s fan,\nLightly they descend in their descent.\n\nBriefly visiting the earth’s mists,\nTurning their chariots toward the Ford of the Fair Perfected.\nMysterious gatherings follow their own summons,\nWandering freely through the dark and profound.\n\nOnly then do they know the fortune of glory and disgrace,\nOnly then do they awaken to the sorrow of fleeting years.\nThe winding chamber may be pure and still—\nLet the spirit await the sun’s completion.\n\nWhy debate the path ahead?\nA hundred ailments arise from this.\n\nThe Celestial Court births golden blossoms,\nWithin, they manifest the yin’s perversity.\nJade Valleys mingle with the Dark Ministers,\nJasper qi intertwines in mutual support.\n\nHeavenly Perfected stand in distant days,\nFlying medicines spew forth numinous sands.\nAt dawn, they harness the celestial steeds,\nTurning chariots toward the Dark Mystery’s home.\n\nImmortal ones enter the chamber,\nThus extinguishing the hundred perversities.\n\nThe Dao takes fasting as its foremost practice,\nDiligent cultivation ascends the Golden Gates.\nThus is the Great Dharma Bridge established,\nUniversally ferrying all beings across.\n\nRepaying karmic debts of past lives,\nThe Dao-heart arises in transcendent clarity.\nSix fasts honor the Empty Cavern,\nTen vigils move the gods to profound response.\nThe Five Elders inscribe immortal names,\nCloud chariots come forth in welcome.\nThe body soars to the Mystic Capital,\nSeven generations all attain liberation.\n\nThe Twelve Scrolls of the Shangqing Golden Chapters conclude.",
