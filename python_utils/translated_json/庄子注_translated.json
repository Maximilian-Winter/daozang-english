  "full_translation": "Xiang Xiu and Guo Xiang’s *Annotations on the Zhuangzi*\n*Zhuangzi, Inner Chapters, \"Free and Easy Wandering\" (First)*\n\nThough small and great differ, when released into the realm of self-attainment, things follow their nature, affairs match their capacity, each fitting its allotted portion—free and easy wandering is one and the same. How could victory or defeat find place between them?\n\nIn the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun.\nThe greatness of Kun—who knows how many thousand *li* it spans?\nIt transforms into a bird, its name is Peng.\nThe reality of Peng and Kun, I have not yet fathomed.\n\nThe great purport of Zhuangzi lies in free and easy wandering, in non-action and self-attainment. Thus he exhausts the extremes of small and great to illuminate the suitability of inherent nature. Those of far-reaching vision should grasp its convergence and let go of its incidental trappings, not troubling themselves to argue point by point with the living. So long as the grand intent remains unharmed, all may be roughly understood.\n\nThe back of Peng—who knows how many thousand *li* it spans?\nWhen it rouses itself to flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky.\nThis bird, when the seas stir, will journey to the Southern Darkness.\nThe Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.\nOnly the dark sea suffices to bear its body; only ninety thousand *li* suffice to support its wings.\nIs this a fondness for the strange? It is simply that great things must arise from great places, and great places must give rise to such great things—principle is inherently natural, not fearing loss. Why trouble the mind over it?\n\n*Qi Xie* is a record of marvels.\nIts words say: “When Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, then spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*. With wings so vast, lifting is difficult—only by seizing the whirlwind can it ascend; ninety thousand *li* are needed to sustain itself. With such wings, how could it suddenly take flight, only to descend a few *ren*? This is all unavoidable, not a matter of delight. It departs with the six-month breath.”\n\nThe great bird departs for half a year before resting at the Celestial Pond; the small bird flies for half a morning before darting to the elm or sandalwood to alight. Though their capacities differ, in following their nature they are one. The wild horses of the air, the motes of dust—all living things are blown about by one another’s breath. These are but what the Peng relies upon to fly.\n\nThe \"wild horses\" are wandering *qi*. Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it simply so distant that it has no end? From above, the Peng sees the earth as we see the sky—thus it halts and plans its journey south, for it knows not the distance, only that it must go far enough to sustain itself and depart.\n\nIf water is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear a great boat. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor, and a mustard seed becomes a boat; place a cup there, and it sticks fast—too shallow for so large a vessel. This makes clear why the Peng flies so high: its wings are vast. A small creature requires little, so a great one cannot make do with less. Thus principle has its ultimate divisions, and things have their fixed limits; each suffices for its task, and their fulfillment is the same.\n\nIf one forgets the root of life and pursues it beyond what is fitting, undertaking what exceeds one’s strength and acting against one’s nature, then even wings spanning the sky cannot escape exhaustion, and a sudden flight cannot avoid distress. If the wind is not deep, it lacks the power to bear great wings. Only when the wind lies nine thousand *li* below can the Peng now rise upon it; only by shouldering the sky and overcoming all obstacles can it now set its course south. Yet its journey south is not out of love for height or longing for distance—it is simply that without accumulated wind, no path opens before it. Such is the Peng’s freedom.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: *\"We burst forth in flight, dart to the elm or sandalwood, and if we fall short, we simply land on the ground—why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?\"* If one is content in one’s nature, then even the great Peng has no cause to value itself above the small bird, nor does the small bird envy the Celestial Pond, for its desires are already fulfilled. Thus, though great and small differ, their freedom is the same.\n\nThose who journey to the near wilds return in a day with bellies still full; those who travel a hundred *li* must pound grain the night before; those who go a thousand *li* must gather provisions for three months. The farther the destination, the more provisions are needed—just as the greater the wings, the deeper the *qi* must be. What do these two creatures know?\n\nThese two creatures—the Peng and the shrimp—contrast great with small to show how their aims are equal. Why do their aims differ? Not because they knowingly choose difference, but because each follows its nature without contrivance. This is the essence of freedom.\n\nLesser knowledge does not reach greater knowledge; short years do not reach long years. All things have their nature, and each nature has its limit—like years and wisdom, how could mere striving attain what lies beyond? From this point to Liezi, examples of long and short years are given, each true to its kind, none sufficient to surpass the other.\n\nOnly the person free of all dependence, who forgets self and others, who merges with all differences—only such a one, whose freedom bears no name, can unite great and small. For if there is great and small, then even the Peng and the sparrow, the minister and the wind-rider, are equally bound by things. If there is life and death, then even the great *chun* tree and the mayfly, Pengzu and the morning mushroom, are equally cut short.\n\nThus, to wander where there is no great or small is to be boundless; to merge with what is neither life nor death is to be limitless. But if freedom is tied to a fixed direction, then even if set loose to roam, it will reach an end—for it is not yet free of dependence. How do we know this is so?\n\nThe morning mushroom knows not the waxing and waning of the moon; the summer cicada knows not spring and autumn—these are short years. South of Chu there is the *Mingling* tree, for which five hundred years make a spring, five hundred years an autumn; in high antiquity there was the great *zhuang* tree, for which eight thousand years make a spring, eight thousand years an autumn—these are long years. Yet Pengzu alone is famed for his longevity; for common people to compare themselves to him is truly lamentable!\n\nThe disparity in years and wisdom is so vast, yet when measured against what common people find lamentable, it is even more pitiable. But people never lament this, for each nature has its limit. If one knows this limit, then even the slightest difference cannot be bridged—what in the world is there to lament? Things never long for what is small because of its smallness, but always envy what is great because of its greatness. Yet the difference between great and small is fixed by nature, beyond the reach of envy or desire—thus the burden of envy and desire can be cut off.\n\nSorrow arises from bondage; when bondage is severed, sorrow departs. And when sorrow departs, life and destiny are at peace—this has never been otherwise. This is what Tang asked Ji about.\n\nTang’s question to Ji also concerned how all things have their limits, and how following them brings harmony. Thus Zhuangzi affirmed his question as correct.\n\nNorth of the barren lands lies the Dark Sea—the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, thousands of *li* in breadth, whose length no one knows; its name is Kun. There is a bird there, named Peng, whose back is like Mount Tai and whose wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. It spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds and shouldering the blue sky, then sets its course south, bound for the Southern Darkness.\n\nThe marsh sparrow laughed at it, saying: \"Where is it off to now? I leap and bound upward, but descend after only a few *ren*, soaring among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the perfection of flight. And where is it off to now?\" This is the distinction between small and great.\n\nEach attains its nature as perfection, exhausts itself as the limit. Earlier, it was said that the two creatures differ, so their destinations vary—one soars to the Celestial Pond, the other reaches only the elm and sandalwood—each is content with its form and sufficient, unaware of why it is so. Now, speaking of the distinction between small and great, each has its natural endowment. This is not something attainable by striving or admiration. Each rests in its own nature, untroubled by their differences, so the point is reiterated.\n\nThus, those whose knowledge suffices for a single office, whose conduct is matched by a single village, whose virtue aligns with a single lord, or whose merit is recognized by a single state—such men regard themselves as this sparrow does, content within their own bounds, like a bird at ease in its domain. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. Because he has not yet equalized all things, he finds cause for laughter.\n\nMoreover, though the whole world praises him, he is not encouraged; though the whole world blames him, he is not discouraged. He has firmly grasped the division between inner and outer—within, the self; without, things. He distinguishes the boundary between honor and shame—honor for himself, shame for others. This is the limit. He cannot surpass it further. In his dealings with the world, he is not restless. He is sufficient unto himself, thus at ease in the world. Yet even so, he has not yet established the ultimate.\n\nHe can affirm himself, but cannot be without something to affirm. Liezi rode the wind and traveled, lightly and skillfully—*lingran*, the appearance of effortless grace. After fifteen days, he returned. If one relies on something, then even riding the wind is merely that—one cannot circumnavigate in an instant. In his pursuit of fortune, he was not restless. He naturally rode the wind, not seeking knowledge through restless striving. Though he avoided walking, he still depended on something. Without wind, he could not travel—this is necessarily reliance. Only one who accomplishes all without reliance is free from dependence.\n\nAs for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, and harnesses the transformations of the six qi, roaming the boundless—what does he rely on? Heaven and Earth are the collective names for the myriad things. Heaven and Earth take the myriad things as their body, and the myriad things must take spontaneity as their constancy. Spontaneity is that which is not done yet naturally is. Thus, the great Peng’s ability to ascend, the marsh sparrow’s ability to descend, the tree stump’s ability to grow, the morning mushroom’s ability to be short—all these are what spontaneity enables, not what effort enables. Not acting yet naturally able, this is what is meant by constancy.\n\nThus, riding the constancy of Heaven and Earth is to follow the nature of the myriad things; harnessing the transformations of the six qi is to roam the paths of change. Proceeding thus, where is there an end? What is harnessed and ridden—what more is there to rely on? This is the carefree wandering of one of utmost virtue, who merges self and other in profound unity.\n\nIf one relies on something, then even Liezi’s light and skillful flight cannot proceed without wind. He must obtain what he relies on before attaining carefree wandering—how much more so for the great Peng! Only one who merges with things and follows great transformation can be without reliance and always unobstructed. Is this merely self-unobstructed? It also guides those who rely on something, ensuring they do not lose what they depend on. If what is relied on is not lost, then it is equal to great unobstruction.\n\nThus, reliance and non-reliance are not opposed; each rests in its nature, the heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself, received without awareness—then there is nothing that cannot be distinct. Non-reliance is not enough to distinguish reliance, let alone the great and small of those who rely!\n\nTherefore, the Perfected Person has no self—without self, one follows things and reaches the ultimate. The Spirit Man has no merit—things have never thanked spontaneity for their lives, yet must rejoice in reliance on acupuncture and stone. When principle reaches its limit, traces vanish. Now, following without assisting, one becomes one with the ultimate principle—thus, no merit. The Sage has no name. The Sage is merely the name for things attaining their nature; it is not enough to name how they attain it.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, saying: \"The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for its light to compare? The timely rain has fallen, yet one still irrigates—is it not laborious for its moisture to compare? You stand, and the world is ordered, yet I still occupy the throne. I see myself as lacking. I beg to offer the world to you.\"\n\nXu You replied: \"You govern the world, and the world is already ordered. One who can order the world does not govern it. Thus, Yao governs by not governing—he does not order the world and yet it is ordered. Now, Xu You clearly understands that once order is achieved, there is nothing to rely on, and order truly comes from Yao. Thus, his words 'you govern' should be forgotten to seek what they illustrate. Yet some say that one who governs and orders is Yao, while one who does not govern and yet enables Yao to order is Xu You—this is far from the truth.\n\nOrder arises from non-governance; action emerges from non-action. Taking from Yao is sufficient—what need is there for Xu You? If one claims that only by folding one’s hands in silence within the mountains and forests can one be called non-active, this is why the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi are rejected by those in power. Those in power are necessarily bound to the realm of action and do not turn back—this is the reason. Yet if I were to replace you, would I do so for the sake of a name? A name is but the guest of reality.\"\n\nShall I then be but a guest to reality? One who takes on burdens faces things, while one who follows things encounters no opposition—thus Yao had no counterpart in the world, while Xu You and Hou Ji and Qi were his equals.\n\nWhy say it is so? One who merges with things cannot be separated from them. Thus, with no mind, responses arise purely from resonance; drifting like a boat untethered, east or west is not of one’s own doing. Therefore, one who takes no action yet shares all with the people goes nowhere without being the lord of the world. To rule thus is as if the world elevates itself—this is truly the virtue of the lord. But if one stands alone, loftily atop a mountain’s peak, this is not the natural inclination of man. To cling to one corner is but a partial preference—how can one claim it exclusively? Such a one is but a single thing among the common, an outer minister to Yao. To replace the inner lord with an outer minister is to bear the name of ruler without its true responsibility.\n\nThe wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs but a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes only to fill its belly. Each nature has its limit—when that limit is met, the rest of the world’s wealth is superfluous. Return to rest, O lord—I have no use for the world! If you have no use for it, why should Yao alone possess it? Clearly, one who embraces openness has no fixed direction, and so the world delights in elevating him without weariness.\n\nThough the cook does not prepare the meal, the invocator does not step beyond the sacrificial vessels to take his place.\n\nCook and invocator each remain in their proper office; birds and beasts and the myriad things each are content with what they receive; Emperor Yao and Xu You each rest in what they encounter—this is the ultimate reality of the world. When each attains their reality, what more is there to do? It is enough to attain it alone.\n\nThus, though the paths of Yao and Xu You differ, their freedom is one. Jian Wu asked Lian Shu: *\"I heard Jie Yu’s words—they were vast yet without measure, boundless and never returning. I was alarmed by them, like the Milky Way stretching endlessly; so far-reaching, so removed from human feeling.\"*\n\nLian Shu said: *\"What did he say?\"*\n\nJian Wu replied: *\"On the distant Guye Mountain dwells a spirit-man—his skin is as if ice and snow, his grace as if a maiden’s. These are but borrowed words. The spirit-man is what we now call the sage. Though the sage stands in the halls of state, his heart is no different than if he were in the mountains and forests—how could the world recognize this? They see only his imperial canopy and jade seals and think these enough to bind his heart; they see him traverse mountains and rivers, sharing in the people’s affairs, and think these enough to weary his spirit. How could they know the perfection of the most perfect remains unharmed?\n\nNow, to speak of one of royal virtue and lodge him on this mountain is to show that the world has no way to recognize him. Thus, he is placed beyond the farthest reaches, beyond the bounds of sight and hearing. The maiden does not let the outer harm the inner. She does not eat the five grains, but draws in the wind and drinks the dew. Both eat the five grains, yet only she becomes a spirit-man—this makes clear that the spirit-man is not made by the five grains, but is uniquely endowed with the wondrous qi of nature. She rides the clouds, drives flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. Her spirit is concentrated, so that things suffer no blight and the harvests ripen. Yet I deem this mad and do not believe it.\"*\n\nOne who embodies the spirit, dwells in the numinous, and exhausts the subtleties of principle—though abiding in the stillness of a quiet chamber—is mystically one with the farthest reaches beyond the four seas. Thus, they ride the Two Modes and harness the Six Abandonments, moving among the multitudes yet driving the myriad things. If nothing is not compliant, then floating clouds become their mount; if no form is not borne, then flying dragons become their steed. They leave the body behind and attain self-realization, though seemingly indifferent and without reliance. Sitting in forgetfulness, acting in forgetfulness, they forget even the act of forgetting—thus, their movement is like dragging withered wood, their stillness like a heap of dead ashes. This is what is meant by the spirit’s concentration. When the spirit is concentrated, what is not concentrated attains its own realization.\n\nYet the world judges all by what it sees—how could it ever believe this?\n\nLián Shū said: \"Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that suffers blindness and deafness? Knowledge, too, has its own. To dismiss the most profound and wondrous words as madness and refuse to believe them—this is the deafness and blindness of understanding. Such words are like timely rain. To say that what Jiē Yú spoke of is naturally sought by things, while those who are deaf and blind to knowledge deny its truth—this is to misunderstand the person and their virtue. They spread their influence across the ten thousand things, unifying the age and seeking to end its chaos. Who would toil and trouble themselves over the world’s affairs?\n\nThe heart of the sage reaches the ultimate convergence of the Two Modes and exhausts the wondrous numbers of the myriad things. Thus, they embody transformation and harmonize with change. There is nowhere they cannot go, pervading the ten thousand things so that nothing is not so. The world, in its chaos, seeks me, yet I have no mind. If I have no mind, why should I not respond to the world? Yet one who embodies the mysterious and exhausts the wondrous—through this, they harmonize with the natures of the ten thousand things and shape the transformations of the world, thereby attaining the fame of Yao and Shun. But they always act by means of non-action. Who would toil and trouble their spirit, exhausting their thoughts over affairs, and only then achieve it?\n\nSuch a person—nothing harms them. If one is at ease with what harms, then harm cannot harm; if harm cannot harm, then things do not harm them. The great flood may rise to the heavens without drowning them; the great drought may melt metal and stone, scorch earth and mountains without heating them. Wherever they go, they are at ease—every place is fitting. Life and death bring no change to them, much less drowning or scorching! Thus, the perfected one does not entangle themselves in calamity and disaster—not by avoiding it, but by following principle straightforwardly, naturally meeting with good fortune. Their dust and chaff, their husks and refuse, are what would mold Yao and Shun. Who would trouble themselves over things!\n\nYao and Shun are but names for worldly affairs; those who act for the sake of names are not truly named. Thus, Yao and Shun—are they merely Yao and Shun? There must be the reality of the spirit-man within. What the world calls Yao and Shun is but the dust and chaff, the husks and refuse of their names. The people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. Yao governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm’s affairs, yet when he went to see the Four Masters on the distant Gu Ye Mountain, north of the Fen River, he was suddenly bereft of his world.\n\nYao’s non-use of the world is like the Yue people’s non-use of ceremonial caps. Yet one who leaves the world behind is truly revered by the world. Though the world reveres Yao, Yao never possessed the world. Thus, he was suddenly bereft of it, having long roamed his mind in the boundless darkness. Though seated above the ten thousand things, he was never not carefree. The Four Masters are but figures of speech to show that Yao was not confined to being Yao. Yao was truly in the dark; his traces were but Yao. To view the dark from the traces is to see inner and outer as separate realms—no wonder it is strange! The world sees only Yao as Yao—how could it recognize his darkness?\"\n\nHuì Zǐ said to Zhuāng Zǐ: \"The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to hold five *dàn*. When I used it to hold water or broth, its strength was not enough to lift itself. When I split it to make a ladle, it was too large and unwieldy to hold anything. It was not that it wasn’t vast—it was that I deemed it useless and smashed it.\"\n\nZhuāng Zǐ said: \"You are truly unskilled in using the great. There was a man of Song who was good at making a salve that prevented chapped hands. For generations, his family made their living by washing silk floss in water. The salve kept their hands from cracking, so they could always bleach silk in the water. A traveler heard of it and offered a hundred gold pieces for the recipe. The family gathered and deliberated: ‘For generations, we’ve washed silk floss and earned only a few gold pieces. Now, in one morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred gold. Let’s give it to him.’ The traveler obtained it and persuaded the King of Wu. When Yue raised a rebellion, the King of Wu sent him to lead the troops. In winter, they fought a naval battle with Yue, and he utterly defeated the Yue forces, winning a fiefdom. The ability to prevent chapped hands was the same, yet one man gained a fiefdom while another remained washing silk floss—the difference lay in how it was used.\n\nNow you have a gourd that holds five *dàn*—why not consider making a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes, instead of worrying that it is too large and unwieldy to hold anything? Then you still have the heart of a clogged reed!\"\n\nA clogged reed is not one who attains thorough understanding. This passage speaks of how things each have their proper use. If one finds the proper use, where can one not be carefree?\n\nHuì Zǐ said to Zhuāng Zǐ: \"I have a great tree—people call it a *chū*. Its great trunk is gnarled and does not meet the inked line; its small branches are twisted and do not fit the compass or square. It stands by the road, yet carpenters do not glance at it. Now your words are vast but useless—just what everyone rejects.\"\n\nZhuāng Zǐ said: \"Have you never seen a wildcat or weasel? They crouch low to lie in wait, pouncing on their prey. They leap east and west, not avoiding high or low...\"\n\nThey are caught in traps and snares and die in nets. Now consider the yak: its size is like a cloud hanging in the sky. This creature is great indeed, yet it cannot catch mice. You have a great tree and fret that it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the vast and boundless wilds? Wander idly at its side, roam carefree beneath its shade. No axe will fell it prematurely, no thing will harm it. Useless? Where then will you find trouble?\"\n\nFor things great and small, if they miss their proper measure, the principles of benefit and harm are the same. When use finds its proper place, all things are carefree.\n\n---\n\nIn *The Equality of Things*, Book Two of the *Inner Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi*:\n\nNan Guo Ziqi leaned against his armrest, gazed at the sky, and sighed, his response so absent it seemed he had lost his counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, \"What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, the heart like dead ashes? The one who leans here now is not the one who leaned here before.\"\n\nThose who affirm themselves and deny others, who praise themselves and despise others—all things are like this. Yet though right and wrong differ, self and other are equal. To unite with Heaven and humanity, to equalize self and other, is to be outwardly without companions for joy, and in response, the body dissolves as if it has lost its match. Dead ashes and withered wood take their stillness and lack of feeling. Those who follow nature and forget right and wrong—what do their bodies hold but the solitary task of Heaven’s truth? Thus, when still, they stand like withered trees; when moving, they sway like dry branches. When seated, they are like dead ashes; when walking, like drifting dust. In their movements and stillness, I cannot find unity. In their effortless self-possession, I cannot find duality.\n\nZiyou had seen those who leaned on armrests before, but never one like Ziqi. \"I have lost myself,\" he said, \"and in losing myself, I have forgotten all things. If I have forgotten all things, what in the world is worth recognizing? Thus, I forget both inner and outer, and only then do I transcend and attain both.\"\n\nZiqi said, \"Yan, how excellent that you ask! Just now, I lost myself—did you know it? You have heard the *human pipes*, but not the *earthly pipes*; you have heard the *earthly pipes*, but not the *Heavenly pipes*.\"\n\nThe *pipes* are flutes. Flutes and reeds vary in length, their notes differing in pitch, producing myriad sounds of varying heights and depths. Though the sounds are myriad, the measure they receive is one, and thus there is no place for superiority or inferiority to intervene.\n\nConsider the things of wind: different sounds share the same nature, each taking what is its own—thus the *pipes of Heaven* are revealed.\n\nZiyou said, \"May I ask the method?\"\n\nZiqi said, \"The Great Clod exhales its qi, and its name is wind. It does nothing, yet when it acts, the myriad hollows roar in anger. Have you alone not heard its long sighing? The Great Clod is nothing. Does the exhalation of qi require a thing? The qi simply exhales of itself. When things are born, none do not arise of themselves—thus the body of self-arising is vast, and so it is named the Great Clod.\n\nThe towering forests and jagged cliffs, the great trees with hollows as wide as a man’s embrace—some resemble noses, some mouths, some ears, some hairpins, some rings, some mortars, some depressions, some pools. They hiss, they shriek, they scold, they inhale, they cry, they wail, they moan, they howl. Those in front sing *yu*, those behind sing *yong*. A gentle breeze elicits a small harmony; a whirlwind, a great harmony. When the fierce wind ceases, all hollows become empty.\n\nHave you alone not seen their swaying, their quivering?\"\n\nThe wind does nothing, yet when it acts, the myriad hollows all rage and produce sound. The sound of the long wind is what the great wind stirs. Here, the shapes of the hollows are briefly described. Here, the differing sounds of the hollows are briefly described. Though the notes of sound vary endlessly in pitch and harmony, in loudness and softness, none fail to match what they receive and each finds its proper place. *Ji* means to cease. When the fierce wind blows, the hollows are full; when it ceases, they are empty. Though fullness and emptiness differ, in each finding its proper place they are the same. *Tiaotiao* and *daodao* describe the appearance of movement. Though the sounds of things differ, and the movements of their forms differ as well, in attaining equality they are one. Is *tiaotiao* alone right and *daodao* alone wrong?\n\nZiyou said, \"The *earthly pipes* are simply the myriad hollows; the *human pipes* are simply the bamboo flutes. May I ask about the *Heavenly pipes*?\"\n\nZiqi said, \"The *Heavenly pipes* blow through the myriad differences, yet make them return to themselves. All take what is their own—who is it that stirs them to anger?\"\n\nThese are the *Heavenly pipes*. Do the *Heavenly pipes* require some other thing? They are simply the hollows, the bamboo flutes, and all that joins the realm of the living, gathering to form a single Heaven. Nonbeing cannot generate being; being, before it is born, cannot be the source of life.\"\n\nThen who is it that gives life to life? It simply arises of itself, spontaneously. It arises of itself—it is not that I give life to it. Since I cannot give life to things, and things cannot give life to me, then I am self-so. Being self-so, it is called \"Heavenly-so.\" It is Heavenly-so, not something made, and thus we speak of it as Heaven. [Speaking of it as Heaven] is to clarify its spontaneity—how could it refer to the azure vault? Yet some say the *Heavenly pipes* command things to follow them. But if Heaven itself cannot possess itself, how could it possess things? Thus, \"Heaven\" is but the collective name for the myriad things. None is uniquely Heaven; who then masters and commands things? Therefore, things each arise of themselves, with no source from which they emerge—this is the Dao of Heaven. All things attain their own nature—who stirs them to anger, making them so?\n\nThis further clarifies the *Heavenly pipes*.\n\nThe great wisdom is leisurely, the small wisdom is meddlesome.\nThe great words blaze forth, the small words chatter on.\nIn sleep, their spirits intertwine; in waking, their forms open.\nThey engage in contention, daily battling with their hearts.\nSome are vague, some are guarded, some are secretive.\nSmall fears make them tremble; great fears leave them dazed.\nTheir outbursts are like the release of a crossbow—this is what it means to wield judgments.\nTheir restraints are like sworn oaths—this is what it means to cling to victory.\nTheir decline is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily decay.\nTheir immersion in their pursuits cannot be reversed.\nTheir weariness is like a sealed vessel, speaking of their aging and stagnation.\nThe heart near death cannot be revived.\nJoy and anger, sorrow and delight, worry and sighing, change and fear, frivolity and indulgence, coquetry and affectation—\npleasure arises from emptiness, steam gives rise to mushrooms.\nDay and night they alternate before us, yet none knows where they sprout.\nEnough! Enough! Morning and evening, this is how they come to be—this is how life arises!\n\nHere lies the difference in knowledge.\nHere lies the difference in speech.\nHere lies the difference between waking and sleeping.\nHere lies the difference in interaction.\nHere lies the difference in fear and trembling.\nHere lies the difference in movement and stillness.\nTheir decay and daily decline are like this.\nTheir immersion leading to irreversible change is like this.\nTheir drowning in desire, aging and growing ever more stagnant, is like this.\nTheir pursuit of profit and disregard for calamity, secretly plotting to achieve their aims, is like this.\nHere lie the differences in nature and disposition.\nHere lie the differences in the vicissitudes of affairs.\n\nFrom this point onward, we have briefly set forth the boundlessness of the *Heavenly pipes*; from this point downward, we clarify the spontaneity of the boundless.\n\nThings each are self-so, not knowing why they are so yet being so. Thus, though their forms may differ endlessly, their *so-ness* is endlessly the same. Day and night alternate, the old giving way to the new. The myriad things of Heaven and Earth transform and renew daily, advancing with time—what thing gives rise to them? They are simply self-so, spontaneously so. This speaks of their self-arising. It is not that without the other, I would not exist; nor is it that without me, there would be nothing to take. This is close, yet one does not know what compels it. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found. One may act in good faith, yet not see its form—it has essence but no form.\n\nThat is spontaneity. Spontaneity gives life to me; I give life to myself spontaneously. Thus, spontaneity is simply my own spontaneity—how distant could it be? All things, in their multitude, are simply thus of themselves; they are not made to be so by one another. Therefore, if one leaves them be, principle will arrive of itself. The myriad things and their myriad dispositions take different paths and make different choices, as if some true master made them so. Yet when one seeks the traces of this true master, one finds nothing in the end. This makes clear that all things are spontaneous, with nothing making them so.\n\nConsider one who walks: he trusts that he can walk, yet does not see the form that enables him to do so. His disposition matches the thing, so the form is not separately perceived. The face, the nine orifices, the six viscera—all are complete and present. With whom should I be intimate? Do you delight in all of them? Or do you have a preference? Are they all like servants? Are the servants insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns being lord and servant? Or is there a true lord present? Whether one seeks to grasp its essence or not, it neither adds to nor detracts from its reality. Entrust it to spontaneity, and all will be preserved. It simply preserves itself. If one delights in all, then there is partiality. With partiality, one cannot preserve all completely. Thus, it is not by delighting in them that they are preserved, nor by acting that they arise of themselves. If one were partial to all, then intentions would exceed their proper bounds, high and low would encroach upon one another, and none would be servants. If servants’ talents are not content with the role of servants, they are lost. Thus, the principle of lord and servant, high and low, outer and inner, is the natural pattern of Heaven—how could it be the doing of a true person?\n\nServants simply each fulfill their proper role; this is not insufficient for mutual governance. Mutual governance is like the hands, feet, ears, and eyes, the four limbs and hundred parts, each having its function and alternating in their use. Those whom the times deem worthy become lords; those whose talents do not match the age become servants. Just as Heaven is naturally high and Earth naturally low, the head naturally resides above and the feet naturally reside below—how could there be alternation? Though there is no error in their proper places, they are necessarily so of themselves. If one entrusts them to their own nature, then it is not artificial.\n\nAll who attain their true nature and employ their own spontaneity, though they be mere menials, still do not heed slander or praise but rest content in their work. Thus, whether known or unknown, all remain as they are. But if one opens the path of vain hopes, with inferiors encroaching upon superiors, things lose their reality, people forget their roots, and in the space between slander and praise, they lose their bearings.\n\nOnce one receives this completed form, one does not perish until its end. Locked in mutual conflict and wear, one’s conduct rushes forward like a galloping horse, yet none can stop it—is this not lamentable? Toiling one’s whole life without seeing success, wearily exhausted yet not knowing where one is headed—is this not sorrowful?\n\nPeople call it \"not dying,\" but what benefit is there? The form dissolves, and the heart follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow? Is human life inherently so deluded? Am I alone deluded, or are there others who are not?\n\nEach nature has its allotted portion. Thus, the wise guard their knowledge to the end, while the foolish cling to their folly until death—who can alter their nature midway? The myriad beings, in their teeming multitudes, clash in discord and accord, each trusting their own partial views and indulging their own conduct, none able to turn back. This—compared to what the common people deem sorrowful—is indeed sorrowful. Yet the common people never regard it as sorrow, for it is the nature of their nature. Each thing follows its own nature—what in the world is worth grieving over?\n\nThe passions of things know no bounds; those who know contentment are few. Thus, having attained this, they do not stop but pursue that instead. All exhaust themselves their whole lives, never sating their ambitions, ceasing only in death. Therefore, their success is never seen. All things, driven by their preferences, wear out their bodies until they are weary and spent, yet do not know where their loves ultimately lead! In truth, this is no different from death.\n\nWhen heart and form race together, exhausted yet unable to turn back, this surpasses what the common people deem sorrowful—here lies the greatest sorrow. Yet the common people never take this as sorrow, so what they sorrow over is not truly sorrowful.\n\nAll the matters above occur without knowing why they occur—hence, delusion. Now, those who do not know all do not know how they know yet know nonetheless; the living all do not know how they live yet live nonetheless. Though the myriad things differ, in that their living does not arise from knowing, there is no difference—thus, none in the world are not deluded.\n\nIf one follows their completed heart and takes it as teacher, who alone would lack a teacher? Why must one know the succession of ages to possess it? Even the foolish have it! To have affirmations and negations before the heart is complete is like arriving in Yue today when you set out yesterday. Thus, to take what is not as what is.\n\nTo take what is not as what is, even the divine Yu could not comprehend—what can I alone do? The heart’s sufficiency to govern the body’s functions is called the completed heart. If one takes their completed heart as teacher, then each person has their own teacher. Each person having their own teacher, they entrust themselves to it and find it fitting.\n\nTo use the completed to replace the incomplete is not knowledge—it is the heart’s own attainment. Thus, even the foolish take their completed heart as teacher, unwilling to employ what they deem deficient and abandon what they deem sufficient. If you arrive in Yue today, how did you get there yesterday? Before the heart is complete, how do affirmations and negations arise?\n\nThose who clarify affirmations and negations cannot be without them, so the perfected person accords with both. In principle, there is no affirmation or negation, yet the deluded take them as existing—this is taking what is not as what is. Once the deluded heart is formed, even sages cannot dispel it, so one entrusts it to its natural state without forcing knowledge.\n\nWords are not like the wind’s blowing; speakers have their words. Yet what they say is not yet settled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? Do they differ from the chirping of fledglings, or is there discernment? Or is there no discernment? Each has their own say, hence differing from the wind. I deem it right, while another deems it wrong; what another deems right, I deem wrong—thus, it is not settled.\n\nNot settled because of the partiality of their perspectives. Do they have words? Yet these are insufficient to settle anything. Do they have no words? Yet they already have words based on themselves. Words and the chirping of fledglings reach the same end—whether there is discernment or not is truly unsettled.\n\nThe world’s sentiments need not be the same, yet their words cannot differ, so affirmations and negations arise in profusion, with no settled ground. Where is the Dao concealed to have truth and falsity? Where are words concealed to have affirmation and negation? Where does the Dao go yet not abide? Where do words abide yet remain untrustworthy?\n\nThe Dao is concealed in petty accomplishments; words are concealed in florid embellishments. Hence, there are the affirmations and negations of the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other negates and negating what the other affirms. To affirm what they negate and negate what they affirm, nothing surpasses using illumination.\n\nWhere is the Dao not present? How are words concealed to have truth and falsity, giving rise to the names of affirmation and negation? All abide. All are permissible.\n\nPetty accomplishments and florid embellishments naturally conceal the Dao, yet the Dao cannot be concealed. Thus, truth and falsity, affirmation and negation arise in florid embellishments yet cease in proper accord; they appear in petty accomplishments yet vanish in great wholeness.\n\nConfucians and Mohists alternately affirm and negate each other, yet all in the world are Confucians and Mohists. Thus, the hundred schools arise, each prizing their own views, never departing from their own domains.\n\nThose who have affirmations and negations are what the Confucians and Mohists affirm; those who have no affirmations and no negations are what the Confucians and Mohists negate. Now, to affirm what the Confucians and Mohists negate and negate what they affirm is to illuminate the absence of affirmations and negations. To illuminate the absence of affirmations and negations, nothing surpasses using the Confucians and Mohists to mutually clarify each other.\n\nWhen mutually clarifying, what they affirm is not affirmed, and what they negate is not negated. Not negated, there is no negation; not affirmed, there is no affirmation. Nothing is not \"that\"; nothing is not \"this.\" From \"that,\" one does not see; from knowing, one knows. Thus, it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also relies on that.\" This is the theory of \"that\" and \"this\" arising together.\n\nYet even as they arise, they die; even as they die, they arise. Even as they are permissible, they are not; even as they are not, they are permissible. Following affirmation, following negation; following negation, following affirmation. Therefore, the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates it by the heavens—this too is following affirmation.\n\nAll things deem themselves right, hence nothing is not \"this.\"\n\nAll things deem others \"that,\" hence nothing is not \"that.\" Nothing is not \"that,\" then the world has no \"this\"; nothing is not \"this,\" then the world has no \"that.\" Without \"that\" and without \"this,\" this is called the profound unity.\n\nThe partiality of things arises from their failure to see what others see, knowing only what they themselves know. Knowing only what they themselves know, they deem themselves right. Deeming themselves right, they regard others as wrong. Thus it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also relies on that\"—\"that\" and \"this\" arise in mutual dependence.\n\nThe transformations of life and death are like the progression of the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer. Though the states of life and death differ, in each finding peace in what they encounter, they are one. Now, the living insist that life is life, while the dead insist that life is death—thus there is no life. The living insist that death is death, while the dead insist that death is life—thus there is no death. Without life and without death, without affirmation and without negation, the debates of Confucians and Mohists are what I cannot align with. Yet when each abides in its own lot, that is what I cannot oppose.\n\nThe one who embraces openness follows the world’s affirmations and negations yet remains free of them. Thus, not proceeding by the path of affirmation and negation, yet ensuring no error in either, is simply to illuminate their natural state without imposing anything. This is also \"that,\" and \"that\" is also \"this.\" \"That\" has its own affirmations and negations, and \"this\" has its own affirmations and negations. Is there truly a \"that\" and \"this\"? Or is there truly no \"that\" and \"this\"? Where \"that\" and \"this\" find no counterpart, this is called the pivot of the Dao. Once the pivot is grasped at the center of the ring, it can respond endlessly. Affirmation is one endlessness, and negation is another endlessness. Thus it is said: \"Nothing compares to illumination.\"\n\nI, too, am deemed \"that\" by \"that.\" \"That,\" too, deems itself right. \"This,\" too, deems itself right and \"that\" wrong; \"that,\" too, deems itself right and \"this\" wrong. Within each, there is one affirmation and one negation. Now, if one calls \"that\" \"that,\" yet \"that\" still deems itself right; if one calls \"this\" \"this,\" yet \"this\" is still deemed \"that\" by \"that.\" Thus, the presence or absence of \"that\" and \"this\" remains undetermined.\n\nA counterpart is an opposition. \"That\" and \"this\" are opposites, yet the sage harmonizes both. Thus, the one without intent merges with things and never sets up oppositions in the world. The pivot is the essential point. Abiding in this essential point and meeting the profound extremity, one responds to the boundless. Affirmation and negation cycle endlessly, hence they are called a ring. The center of the ring is empty. Now, if one takes affirmation and negation as the ring and attains its center, one attains neither affirmation nor negation. Without affirmation and without negation, one can respond to all affirmations and negations. Since affirmations and negations are endless, the response is also endless.\n\nThe world deems itself right and others wrong, hence one affirmation and one negation proceed endlessly. Only the one who enters emptiness and attains the center remains unbound, riding it in freedom. To illustrate the non-finger with a finger is not as good as illustrating the non-finger with a non-finger. To illustrate the non-horse with a horse is not as good as illustrating the non-horse with a non-horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nTo deem oneself right and others wrong is the common tendency of \"that\" and \"this.\" Thus, if I use my finger to illustrate \"that\" finger, then \"that\" finger alone becomes a non-finger to my finger—this is illustrating the non-finger with a finger. If, in turn, \"that\" finger is used to illustrate my finger, then my finger becomes a non-finger to \"that\" finger—this is illustrating the non-finger with a non-finger. To clarify the absence of affirmation and negation, nothing compares to reciprocal illustration. Through reciprocal illustration, \"that\" and \"this\" are alike in deeming themselves right and alike in deeming each other wrong. Alike in deeming each other wrong, the world has no right; alike in deeming themselves right, the world has no wrong.\n\nHow can this be demonstrated? If affirmation were truly affirmation, the world would have no one to negate it. If negation were truly negation, the world would have no one to affirm it. Now, with no fixed ground for affirmation or negation, they are confused and chaotic. This shows that these petty distinctions are merely each trusting their own partial views and aligning in uniformity. Looking up and looking down, all are like this. Thus, the perfected person knows that heaven and earth are one finger and the myriad things are one horse. Therefore, they abide in vast tranquility, and heaven, earth, and the myriad things each rest in their lot, merging in self-contentment without affirmation or negation.\n\nIs it permissible? Is it not permissible? What is permissible to oneself is called permissible; what is not permissible to oneself is called not permissible. The Dao is completed in its course, and things are so called by others. There is that by which it is permissible, and that by which it is not; there is that by which it is so, and that by which it is not. How is it so? It is so in being so. How is it not so? It is not so in not being so. How is it permissible? It is permissible in being permissible. How is it not permissible? It is not permissible in not being permissible.\n\nThings inherently have that by which they are so, and inherently have that by which they are permissible. Nothing is not so, and nothing is not permissible. Thus, I raise the examples of a stalk and a pillar, of an ugly woman and Xi Shi, of the expansive, the strange, the deceitful, and the bizarre—all are united as one. In their division, they are completed; in their completion, they are destroyed. All things are without completion and destruction, for they are united as one. There is nothing that is not completed, nothing that is not so. Each is so in its own way, each is permissible in its own way.\n\nA stalk lies horizontally, while a pillar stands vertically; an ugly woman is repulsive, while Xi Shi is beautiful. What is meant by equality is not necessarily equal in form or identical in measure! Thus, I raise the examples of vertical and horizontal, beauty and ugliness, the expansive, the strange, the deceitful, and the bizarre—each is so in its own way, each is permissible in its own way. Though their principles are myriad, their natures share the same attainment. Thus it is said: \"The Dao unites all as one.\"\n\nThings may be deemed dissolution by one and completion by another. What I call completion, another may call destruction. Completion and destruction arise from seeing only oneself and not the other. Thus, there is no completion or destruction, just as there is no right or wrong. Only the enlightened know that all is united as one, and though they do not employ such distinctions, they lodge them in the ordinary. Following what is so, affirming it without knowing why—this is called the Dao.\n\nThe enlightened are not confined to one perspective; thus, they suddenly forget themselves and entrust their function to spontaneous use. In spontaneous use, all things flow smoothly and find their own fulfillment. \"Few\" means \"exhaustion.\" The ultimate principle is exhausted in self-fulfillment. The enlightened follow without contrivance. Do they know that following is good and thus follow? They do not know why they follow—they simply follow, and so it is called the Dao.\n\nTo toil the spirit in pursuit of unity while failing to recognize its sameness—this is called \"morning three.\" What is \"morning three\"? The monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" All the monkeys were enraged. He then said, \"Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased. The names and realities remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were put to use—this, too, is following what is so. Therefore, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the balance of heaven, which is called \"walking two paths.\"\n\nDoes the enlightened one labor the spirit to achieve unity? If one labors the spirit to achieve unity, it is not to be relied upon, for it differs not from those who fail to unite. It is no different from the monkeys' delusion, affirming themselves by what they prefer. Without partiality, one entrusts it to spontaneous balance and leaves it at that. Entrusting the world’s right and wrong to this principle:\n\nThe ancients’ knowledge reached its limit. To what limit? Some held that things had never yet begun to exist—this is the limit, the exhaustion, beyond which nothing can be added! Next were those who acknowledged the existence of things but had not yet imposed boundaries. Next were those who acknowledged boundaries but had not yet introduced right and wrong. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao; the diminishment of the Dao is the formation of attachment. Is there truly completion and diminishment? Or is there truly neither completion nor diminishment?\n\nIf there is completion and diminishment, then Master Zhao’s zither playing exists. If there is neither completion nor diminishment, then Master Zhao’s not playing the zither exists. Master Zhao’s zither playing, Shi Kuang’s wielding the baton, and Master Hui’s leaning against the parasol tree—these three were among the most eminent in knowledge, and so their stories are recorded at life’s end. Yet because they were fond of their ways, they differed from others. Their fondness led them to seek clarity, but what they sought to clarify was not truly clarifiable, so they ended in the obscurity of \"hard and white.\" And Master Zhao’s son spent his life weaving the threads of his father’s art, yet achieved nothing. If this can be called completion, then though I have achieved nothing, it too can be called completion. If this cannot be called completion, then neither things nor I have achieved anything.\n\nThus, the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage contemplates. Not employing such distinctions but lodging them in the ordinary—this is called \"illuminating through clarity.\" This is to forget heaven and earth, to leave behind the myriad things, to look outward without examining the cosmos, to look inward without perceiving one’s own body. Thus, one is vast and unburdened, moving with things and responding to all without exception.\n\nThough one may not yet have forgotten everything, one can still forget the distinction between self and other. Though one may not yet have forgotten self and other, one can still forget their right and wrong. Without the Dao’s diminishment, emotions would not be partial, and attachment would not form. Failing to forget attachment and relinquish self-interest, one cannot achieve the profound unity of self and other. This is not perfection.\n\nTo know neither existence nor nonexistence—this is the ultimate limit.\n\nThe myriad sounds cannot all be enumerated. Thus, when blowing pipes or plucking strings, though the fingers may move intricately, many sounds are still lost. Those who grasp the flute or strike the zither seek to manifest sound, yet in manifesting sound, sound is lost; in not manifesting sound, sound remains whole. Thus, to strive for completion and thereby diminish it—this is how Zhaowen plays the zither. Not to strive and thus remain undiminished—this is how Zhaowen does not play the zither. \"Almost\" means \"exhaustion.\" These three masters all sought to clarify what they themselves did not understand, thus exhausting their knowledge and depleting their thoughts, their bodies wearied and their spirits fatigued. Some leaned on their staffs and dozed, others rested against a tree and closed their eyes. They relied on their vigor to endure, for without it, they would have succumbed long ago.\n\nThese three spoke only of what they themselves understood, considering themselves distinct from the multitude. They sought to display their understanding to others, desiring that all align with their own preferences. This is like playing the reed pipes to an ox. Since others ultimately do not understand, their own Dao and techniques end in obscurity. Zhaowen’s son, in continuing his father’s legacy, likewise failed to achieve completion. Though these three sought to enlighten others, those others ultimately did not understand, and so they accomplished nothing in their lifetimes. If these three could be called accomplished, then even my own lack of accomplishment could be called accomplishment. All things illuminate themselves but do not illuminate others. If, because others do not understand, one deems them unaccomplished, then all things would be without accomplishment.\n\nThus, the sage does not display this to dazzle that, nor abandons the self to pursue things. Following and entrusting them to their own natures, each attains its proper capacity in obscurity. Thus, all things achieve completion without omission. Now, these three sought to display their own preferences to others—was this not delusional?\n\nThe sage is without self. Thus, when faced with the dazzling confusion of doubt, they chart and contain it; when confronted with the vast and strange, they unify and harmonize it. They allow all differences to rest in what they naturally find restful, so that the multitude does not lose what they deem right. Thus, the sage is not employed by things, and the use of all things is fully realized. When all things employ themselves, who is right and who is wrong? Therefore, even in the face of unbridled transformations and strange deviations, bending to follow them and entrusting them to their own use, though their uses may differ in ten thousand ways, all becomes clearly self-evident.\n\nNow, suppose I were to speak here—how would I know if it is of the same kind as this? Or not of the same kind? Whether of the same kind or not, all are of the same kind when taken together, and thus no different from that. Nevertheless, let me attempt to speak:\n\nThere is a beginning; there is that which precedes the beginning; there is that which precedes what precedes the beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is that which precedes non-being; there is that which precedes what precedes non-being. Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly so. Now, I have already spoken, yet I do not know if what I have spoken is truly speaking or truly not speaking.\n\nIf I say there is no right or wrong, how do I know if this is of the same kind as those who say there is right and wrong, or not? If I wish to call it the same kind, then I take non-being as right, while they take non-being as wrong—thus, it is not the same kind. Yet though this right and wrong differ, they are still not free from right and wrong, and thus are of the same kind as that. Therefore, whether of the same kind or not, all are of the same kind when taken together, and thus no different from that.\n\nIf one wishes to avoid such great dissimilarity, nothing is better than having no mind. Having already relinquished right and wrong, one must further relinquish the act of relinquishing. Relinquishing the relinquishing again and again until there is no relinquishing left, then there is no relinquishing and nothing not relinquished, and right and wrong vanish of themselves. The ultimate principle is without words; to speak is to fall into categories. Thus, I tentatively entrust these words to this purpose.\n\nIf there is a beginning, there is an end. To speak of no end or beginning and to equalize life and death—those who equalize have not yet equaled as well as those who do not equalize and yet are naturally equal. This is to forget even the act of equalizing.\n\nWhere there is being, beauty and ugliness, right and wrong all arise. Where there is non-being but one does not yet know the absence of absence, right and wrong, love and hate still linger in the heart. Even knowing the absence of absence, one has not yet ceased knowing. To utterly forget this knowing—only then does one suddenly begin to comprehend nothingness. In comprehending nothingness, heaven and earth, the myriad things, self and other, right and wrong—all become clearly resolved.\n\nTo say there is no right or wrong is itself to speak. Yet not knowing whether this speaking is being or non-being—only then is the mind utterly unburdened, without the slightest trace of dust.\n\nIn the world, nothing is smaller than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing lives shorter than an infant who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived. Heaven and earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, can there be speech? Since we have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. From this point onward, even the most skilled mathematician cannot arrive at a number, much less an ordinary person! Thus, from non-being to being, one reaches three—how much more so from being to being! Do not proceed further; rest here!\n\nWhen things are compared by form, Mount Tai is greater than an autumn hair. But if each abides by its own nature and attains its limit, then a large form is not excessive, nor is a small form insufficient. If each is sufficient in its nature, then an autumn hair is not merely small in its smallness, nor is Mount Tai merely great in its greatness. If sufficiency in nature is deemed greatness, then nothing in the world is greater than an autumn hair. If sufficiency in nature is not deemed greatness, then even Mount Tai may be called small. Thus, it is said: \"In the world, nothing is smaller than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small.\" If Mount Tai is small, then nothing in the world is great; if an autumn hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Without small or great, without long life or early death, the cicada does not envy the great Peng tree but rejoices in its own contentment; the sparrow does not prize the heavenly pond but takes pride in its own sufficiency.\n\nIf one is sufficient in Heaven’s natural endowment and at peace with one’s nature and fate, then even heaven and earth are not long-lived enough to surpass me in birth, nor are the myriad things so different as to differ from my own attainment. If heaven and earth are born, why should they not be born alongside me? If the myriad things attain, why should they not attain as one with me?\n\nThe myriad things in their myriad forms all find sufficiency in themselves, and their attainment is one. Once one has attained oneness, there is no principle left to speak of. Names and terms arise from a lack of clarity. Some things cannot clarify their own oneness and thus pursue others through these terms, so they use the term \"one\" to correct them. Once they have termed it \"one,\" they have already resorted to speech. To speak of oneness with speech, when oneness is not speech, is to make oneness and speech two. Oneness is already one, yet speech makes it two; with one and two, how can this not be called three? To speak of oneness with a single word is still to produce three—how much more so when tracing its branches and all things’ distinct names? Even with skilled calculation, none can keep account of them.\n\nThus, those who term oneness do not differ from others, while those who forget oneness remain silent and attain oneness of themselves. Each abiding in what it can do is most fitting. The Dao has never had boundaries, nor has speech ever had constancy; it is for this reason that divisions arise. Let me speak of these divisions: there is left, there is right, there are relationships, there are duties, there are distinctions, there are debates, there is competition, there is contention—these are called the eight virtues.\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate; regarding the *Spring and Autumn* and the records of former kings’ aspirations, the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, where there are divisions, there are also non-divisions; where there is debate, there is also non-debate.\n\nSomeone asks: \"Why is this?\" The answer: \"The sage embraces it, while the multitude debates it to show one another. Thus it is said: debate arises from what is not seen.\" Obscure yet omnipresent, when spoken of in terms of \"this\" and \"that,\" right and wrong have no fixed ground. The Dao is unbounded, so the myriad things freely occupy their own domains, each differing in what suits them. Each thing has its principle, each affair its fittingness. They are grouped by kind and distinguished by category. Pursuing together is called competition; opposing debate is called contention. Briefly distinguishing them, we have these eight virtues.\n\nWhat lies beyond the six directions refers to what is outside the nature and lot of things. Though principle exists even in what lies beyond things’ natures, since it is not within their nature and lot, it does not move the sage, and so the sage does not discuss it. If he were to discuss it, it would be like leading the myriad things to learn what they cannot. Thus, he does not discuss what lies beyond, and the eight divisions are all subsumed in self-sufficiency. He sets forth their natures and lets them rest in them, following their completed traces and congealing at the ultimate of what is fitting, without clinging to what he deems right to condemn others.\n\nEach thing divides itself, each affair distinguishes itself. To desire to divide and distinguish them by oneself is to fail to see their self-distinction. The sage harbors no such intent; he does not see their self-debate, so he debates what he knows to show them. The great Dao is not named; great debate does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage is not aggressive. When the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao; when speech is debating, it does not reach; when benevolence is constant, it is not all-encompassing; when integrity is pure, it is not trustworthy; when courage is aggressive, it does not succeed. These five, though not accomplished, nearly approach the proper direction.\n\nEntrusting it to self-naming, there is nothing to name. It distinguishes itself. Existing without attachment, it preserves itself. The utterly sufficient one is not affected by things’ comings and goings, so there is nowhere to harbor modesty or fullness. Going nowhere without compliance, it can traverse no peril without going. Using this to clarify that, both this and that are lost. It cannot reach their self-division.\n\nThings have no constant attachment, and constant attachment is never all-encompassing. Brightly pure integrity is merely the greed of one who covets fame—it is not true integrity. Aggressive, contrary courage is detested by all under heaven, leaving no ground to stand on. These five all harm what is fitting by acting, unable to rest in their original nature and endlessly seeking what lies beyond. Seeking what cannot be sought is like trying to learn the square from the round or a fish longing to be a bird. Though one may aspire to the phoenix and emulate the sun and moon, the closer one draws to them, the farther one strays from reality; the more one learns, the more one loses one’s nature. Thus, when things are equalized, the burden of partial preferences is gone.\n\nTherefore, to know to stop at what one does not know is perfection. Who knows the debate that does not speak, the Dao that is not the Dao? If there is one who can know this, it is called the Heavenly Storehouse. Pour into it without filling it; draw from it without depleting it; yet one does not know whence it comes—this is called preserving the light. What one does not know lies outside the nature and lot of things. Thus, stopping within what one knows is perfection. Vast and all-embracing, it entrusts everything to its course.\n\nThe mind of the perfected one is like a mirror: it responds but does not store, and so remains open and free from the changes of fullness and emptiness. The coming of the ultimate principle is naturally without trace. Allowing it to clarify itself, its light is never exhausted.\n\nThus, long ago, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I face south, I cannot put it aside. What is the reason?\" Shun said: \"Those three lords dwell among the mugwort and reeds. Why can you not put it aside? Long ago, ten suns appeared together, and the myriad things were all illuminated—how much more so one whose virtue surpasses the sun!\" Yao’s way of peaceful compliance was not yet vast, so he listened to court affairs without joy. He sought to entrust the principle of clarity and equality to the great sage, so he posed this strange question to elicit a response.\n\nWhat things find peaceful has no baseness, so the mugwort and reeds are the wondrous abode of those three lords. When the doubled brightness ascends to heaven, the six directions are all illuminated, and there is no mugwort or reed that is not bathed in light.\n\nThe sun and moon, though impartial in their illumination, still leave some places unreached, but virtue suffers no such lack. Now, to force the aspirations of the mugwort and reeds and compel them to follow one’s own will—how could this expand the supreme Dao? Thus, the mind remains unsettled and the spirit unresolved.\n\nIf all things flourish according to their nature, each content in what it finds contentment, whether distant or near, hidden or deep, left to itself in natural ease—all would attain their utmost. Then, nothing would be amiss for them, and nothing would fail to bring me joy.\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni: “Do you know what all things agree upon as right?”\nWang Ni replied: “How would I know?”\nWhat they agree upon is not necessarily right, and what they differ on is not necessarily wrong. Thus, neither I nor others can correct one another, and so there is no use for such knowledge.\n\n“Do you know what you do not know?”\n“How would I know?”\nIf one knew what one did not know, that would itself be a kind of knowing. And if one knew, one could not entrust things to the self-sufficiency of the myriad talents.\n\n“Then are things without knowledge?”\n“How would I know? Though let me try to speak of it: How do I know that what I call knowing is not ignorance? How do I know that what I call ignorance is not knowing?\n\nMoreover, let me ask you this: When people sleep in dampness, their waists ail and they become half-paralyzed—is that the case for loaches? When they dwell in trees, they tremble with fear—is that the case for monkeys? Of these three, which knows the proper place to dwell?\n\nPeople eat domesticated animals, deer eat grass, centipedes relish snakes, owls and crows crave mice—of these four, which knows the proper taste? Apes and monkeys mate with their own kind, deer couple with elk, loaches swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Xi Shi are considered beauties by humans, yet fish plunge deep at the sight of them, birds take flight, and deer bolt away—of these four, which knows the true standard of beauty in the world?\n\nFrom my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I discern their distinctions?”\n\nThey remain unaware, and thus all things lie open without constraint. Precisely because they do not know, I dare not speak with certainty—only tentatively.\n\nFish swim in water, a capacity shared by all aquatic creatures, and all call this \"knowing.\" Yet from a bird’s perspective, what was just called knowing becomes ignorance. The dung beetle’s knowledge lies in rolling its ball, while those who mock it prize storax instead. Thus, what is commonly called knowing cannot be taken as an absolute standard.\n\nWhat is called \"not knowing\" is simply a matter of difference—it is still a kind of knowing, unique to its own domain. Since I cannot claim certainty, I tentatively ask you this.\n\nHere, I briefly cite three examples to illustrate the differing aptitudes of the myriad things. Here, I briefly cite four examples to show that beauty and ugliness have no fixed standard. Here, I briefly cite four examples to show that the preferences of the world are not the same.\n\nTo condemn what differs is to have no way of knowing whether what is shared is necessarily correct. What benefits one may harm another, and since the \"one\" and \"another\" in the world are endless, the boundaries of right and wrong have no constancy. Therefore, only by refraining from debate and allowing each to follow its own nature can all things attain their full freedom.\n\nNie Que said, \"If you do not know benefit and harm, does the Perfected Person likewise not know benefit and harm?\"\n\nStill unable to fathom the subtlety of not-knowing, he thus suspected that the Perfected Person ought to know.\n\nThis knot remains unresolved.\n\nWang Ni said, \"The Perfected Person is divine! Though great marshes burn, they cannot make him hot; though the Milky Way freezes, they cannot make him cold; though swift thunder splits mountains, it cannot harm him; though whirlwinds shake the seas, they cannot startle him. One such as this rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Death and life bring no change to him—how much less the mere tips of benefit and harm!\"\n\nWithout intent, yet nothing is not accommodated. The one whose spirit is whole and complete, whose body merges with things, though traversing the most extreme changes, has never ceased to be himself. Thus, nothing lingers or clings in his breast. Borrowing things to act, it is not he who moves. Identifying with change as his very body, death and life are as one. Day and night pass without death or life—how much less can benefit and harm disturb his mind?\n\nJu Quezi asked Chang Wuzi, \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao. Where there is no speech, he speaks; where there is speech, he does not speak. And he roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered these wild and reckless words, but I believe they are the practice of the wondrous Dao. How close do you think I am to understanding?\"\n\nChang Wuzi said, \"Even the Yellow Emperor would be dazzled by such words—how could Confucius know them! Moreover, you are far too hasty in your calculations. Seeing an egg, you demand a crowing rooster; seeing a slingshot, you seek a roasted owl. I have spoken to you recklessly—why not listen to them recklessly as well?\n\n\"Stand beside the sun and moon, embrace the cosmos, and let your lips meet in harmony. Why set store by the murky and turbid, or vie for honor? The multitude toil and strive, while the sage appears foolish and dull, blending the myriad ages into a single purity. All things are thus, and with this they are mutually enfolded. Affairs come of themselves, and principle responds of itself—it is not a matter of following and engaging with them. Proceeding straightforwardly without seeking to avoid or approach, not rejoicing in attainment nor angered by direct seizure—this is the solitary perfection.\n\n\"All that bears a name is not what I speak of. Each calls itself by its own name, so there is no 'that' with speech and no 'this' without speech. Whatever is not true nature is but dust and grime. Things have their spontaneity, principles have their ultimate. Following them directly, one merges obscurely of itself—no words are needed. Thus, to speak is reckless, and to hear is dazzled. Even the Yellow Emperor could not prevent all things from harboring attachments and being dazzled to the end. Therefore, the sage entrusts things to the realm beyond dust and grime, mysteriously uniting with what lies beyond sight and hearing. Illumined by Heaven, he does not oppose with calculation; released to spontaneity, he does not force clarity.\n\n\"Now, Ju Quezi, upon hearing reckless words, you immediately take them as the practice of the wondrous Dao. This is no different from seeing an egg and demanding the service of a rooster at dawn, or seeing a slingshot and seeking the reality of a roasted owl. Those who cannot rest in their time and follow the natural order, who probe change and seek transformation, who contemplate death while alive, who cling to 'this' to debate 'that'—all are followers of opposing calculation. To speak of it is reckless, so I have tried speaking recklessly. If you listen to reckless words as though they were correct, you are again too hasty in your calculations. So why not listen recklessly?\n\n\"Taking death and life as day and night—this is the analogy of standing beside the sun and moon. Taking the myriad things as one body—this is the metaphor of embracing the cosmos. Because there is that which is deemed base, honor and lowliness arise, and murkiness and confusion proliferate, none able to set them right. Each asserts its own rightness in its own corner. Thus, for the Dao of effortless harmony, nothing is better than setting it aside without words and entrusting it to spontaneity. Flowing smoothly, without waves or bounds—this is what it means.\n\n\"To gallop through the realm of 'this' and 'that' is to be impure. Purity is to be unadulterated. To survey the myriad ages and blend their changes—this the multitude calls 'mixed.' Thus, they toil in body and startle in mind, shunning 'that' and clinging to 'this.' Only the great sage, free of attachments, proceeds straightforwardly and becomes one with change, ever roaming in solitude. Though blending countless eons, with a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions, when the Dao acts and completes them, past and present are one. When things name them, the myriad things are as one. Nothing is not so, no time is not complete—this may be called purity.\n\n\"Nothing is not so. Enfolded, it accumulates. Accumulating 'this' over the myriad ages, the myriad ages are one 'this.' Accumulating 'so' over the myriad things, the myriad things are all 'so.' Thus, one does not know where death and life, before and after, reside, nor where victory and defeat between self and other lie.\n\n\"How do I know that delighting in life is not delusion? Death and life are one, yet one delights only in life, desiring to oppose change—how can one know this is not delusion? How do I know that hating death is not like one who, having lost his home in youth, is weak and scattered, never knowing to return? How do I know that life is not that weakness and scattering, and death not a return home—why then hate it?\n\n\"Li Ji was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her robe was soaked. Yet once she arrived at the king’s palace, shared his bed, and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret their former seeking of life?\n\n\"Within a single lifetime, emotions change like this. On that day, one does not know the other—how much less can one know the change of death and life! Seeking is desiring. One who dreams of drinking wine may weep at dawn; one who dreams of weeping may go hunting at dawn. While dreaming, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even divine the dream—only upon waking does one know it was a dream.\"\n\nMoreover, only after the great awakening does one know that all this was but a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves already awake, priding themselves on their keen discernment: \"This is a lord! That is a herdsman!\" How rigid! Even you and I, Confucius, are but dreams—when I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called \"perverse and strange.\" Should a great sage arise once in ten thousand generations to comprehend their meaning, it would be as if encountering him at dawn or dusk.\n\nThis is the transformation of waking and dreaming. If circumstances change, emotions differ; thus, the wishes of life and death cannot be the same. Therefore, those who delight in life when alive will delight in death when dead. Though life and death differ, each attains its wish equally—what bondage remains? From this perspective, at the moment of death, one does not know it as death but simply follows one’s inclination. The dreamer who dreams and then interprets the dream within the dream differs not at all from the waking man. In every encounter, nothing is lacking—why then fret over life while fearing death?\n\nThe great awakened are sages. They alone know that those who harbor anxieties and concerns remain unawakened. Fools, lost in their great dream, believe themselves awake, smugly distinguishing lords from herdsmen, joyfully clinging to the biases of their clan—how narrow-minded! Unable to forget words and attain spiritual understanding, they are not truly awakened. Extraordinary discourse is beyond the grasp of ordinary minds, hence called \"perverse and surpassingly strange,\" for they fail to recognize its profound liberation.\n\nThose who can shed all attachments and harmonize life and death are exceedingly rare. Even if you and I were to debate, and you prevailed over me, or I over you—would you truly be right? Would I truly be wrong? If I prevailed over you, and you did not prevail over me, would I truly be right? Would you truly be wrong? Is one of us right? Is one of us wrong? Are we both right? Are we both wrong? You and I cannot know. People are inherently shrouded in darkness—whom could I ask to judge? If I asked one who agrees with you to judge, since they agree with you, how could they judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with me to judge, since they agree with me, how could they judge rightly? If I asked one who differs from both you and me to judge, since they differ from us, how could they judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with both you and me to judge, since they agree with us, how could they judge rightly? Thus, you, I, and others cannot know one another—must we await another?\n\nYou, *er*, and *ru* all mean \"you.\" Without knowing, one speculates; without seeing, one debates. Debating brings no self-assurance, for it opposes things. Debate all day, yet darkness prevails—ultimately, none can be set right. Thus, one must leave it to self-correction. Agreement does not suffice as proof; difference does not suffice as grounds for rejection. If your view were truly right, none in the world could oppose it; if your wrong were truly wrong, none could affirm it. Now, we affirm what we agree on and reject what we differ on—yet with agreement and difference both present, right and wrong have no foundation.\n\nThus, right and wrong arise from contentiousness and rest in the balance of Heaven. Entrust them to the two courses and let self-correction prevail. Each corrects itself. Relying on another cannot set this right, so none in the world can set one another right—thus, one must leave it to self-correction to reach its end.\n\nThe \"Heavenly Boundary\" is the natural division. Right and wrong, affirmation and negation, self and other oppose one another—hence, no debate. Without debate, harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary, abide in one’s natural division, and do not rely on another to set it right. The mutual dependence of changing voices is like their independence. Harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary, follow the boundless transformation, and thus pass the years.\n\n\"What does it mean to harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary?\" It means: \"Is it so? Is it not so? So or not so.\" If \"is\" were truly \"is,\" then its difference from \"is not\" would require no debate; if \"so\" were truly \"so,\" then its difference from \"not so\" would require no debate. Forget years, forget righteousness, rouse yourself in the boundless, and lodge in the limitless. The debate over right and wrong is but a changing voice. The mutual dependence of changing voices cannot set one another right—thus, they are as if independent. Harmonize with the natural division, follow the infinite transformation, and as you proceed, the realm of right and wrong will vanish of itself, and the essence of life and destiny will be fully realized.\n\nForgetting years unites life and death; forgetting righteousness pervades right and wrong. When right and wrong, life and death dissolve into one, this is the ultimate principle. The ultimate principle flows into the infinite—thus, those who lodge in it cannot be exhausted.\n\nShadowy Doubt asked Shadow: \"Earlier you walked, now you stand; earlier you sat, now you rise. Why so lacking in constancy?\" Shadow replied: \"Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on snake scales or cicada wings? How would I know why it is so? How would I know why it is not so?\"\n\nShadowy Doubt is the faint yin beyond the shadow. It speaks of the celestial mechanism moving of itself—sitting and rising without dependence. That which is without dependence and attains singularity—who could know its cause and demand its reason? If one demands its dependence and traces its origin, the tracing and demanding would be endless, ultimately reaching the state of no-dependence, and the principle of spontaneous transformation would become clear. If one were to depend on snake scales or cicada wings, the lack of constancy would not be difficult to understand. The reason it is not understood now is precisely because it does not depend on such things but transforms spontaneously.\n\nSome in the world say that Shadowy Doubt depends on the shadow, the shadow depends on form, and form depends on the Creator. Let us ask: Does the Creator exist or not? If it does not exist, how could it create things? If it does exist, it would be insufficient to account for the multitude of forms. Only by recognizing that the multitude of forms arise of themselves can one begin to speak of creation. Thus, within the realm of existing things, even Shadowy Doubt does not fail to transform spontaneously in the profound obscurity. Therefore, the Creator has no master, and each thing creates itself. Each thing creates itself without dependence—this is the norm of heaven and earth.\n\nThus, self and other are mutually arising, form and shadow emerge together; though profoundly united, they do not depend on one another. Understanding this principle will lead all things to return to their source within themselves without relying on externals. Externally, nothing is to be rejected; internally, nothing is to be prized. Thus, all things emerge in serene spontaneity, unaware of why they are born; all attain harmony, unaware of how they attain it. Now, Shadowy Doubt’s reliance on the shadow is like saying they arise together without dependence. Though myriad things gather and together complete heaven, each distinctly manifests its singularity. Therefore, Shadowy Doubt is not controlled by the shadow, nor is the shadow manipulated by form, nor is form transformed by nothingness. Thus, transformation or non-transformation, being so or not being so, following others or following oneself—all arise of themselves. How could I know their cause?\n\nThus, to follow without aiding is to allow root and branch, inner and outer, to flow harmoniously together, leaving no trace. If one clings to proximate causes and forgets their spontaneous arising, externalizes the source of things, and loses the master within, then attachment and esteem arise. Though one may seek to equalize all things, what is esteemed already resides in the heart—how could there be any leveling?\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering and joyous—a butterfly content with itself, unaware of being Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, solidly Zhou. Did Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things. Delighting in one’s own joy, acting with ease and pleasure—while dreaming of being a butterfly and unaware of Zhou, it was no different from a distinct death. Yet wherever one is, there is no lack of contentment. Thus, those who cling to life while alive will surely cling to death when dying. From this perspective, those who grieve death while alive are mistaken.\n\nSpeaking from Zhou’s perspective, he called it waking—yet it may not have been a dream. Now, not knowing the butterfly is no different from the dream’s not knowing Zhou. Each suits its momentary contentment, so there is no way to prove that the butterfly does not dream of being Zhou. There are those who doze and dream of a hundred years—how can we prove that this hundred years is not a dream in a doze? Time does not pause even briefly, and the present does not endure. Thus, yesterday’s dream has already transformed today. The change between life and death—how is it different from this? Why trouble the heart over it?\n\nTo be absorbed in one is to be unaware of the other—this is like dreaming of being a butterfly. To take it from a human perspective, in a single lifetime, the present does not know the future—this is like Lady Li. Yet fools secretly believe they know that life is joyful and death is bitter, never having heard of the transformation of things.\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Zhuangzi, \"Nourishing Life\" (Chapter Three):*\n\"My life has limits, but knowledge is without limit. To pursue the limitless with the limited is perilous! And to do so while claiming to be knowledgeable is perilous indeed! In doing good, avoid seeking fame; in doing wrong, avoid punishment. Follow the central path as your guiding principle—this can preserve the body, fulfill life, nourish kin, and complete one’s years.\n\nLife exists to be nourished and preserved, so nourishing life is the ultimate principle. Yet if nourishment exceeds its limit and harms life, it is no longer the true nourishment of life. The allotment one receives has its own limit. Lifting heavy weights and carrying light ones while the spirit and qi remain unperturbed—this is the limit of one’s strength. Yet those who crave fame and competition, even if they break their backs, still cannot satisfy their desires—this is the limitlessness of knowledge. Thus, the pursuit of knowledge arises from imbalance and vanishes into profound obscurity. Profound obscurity means following one’s utmost allotment without the slightest excess.\n\nTherefore, though bearing ten thousand jun, if it accords with one’s capacity, one suddenly forgets the weight on one’s body. Though responding to ten thousand affairs, one remains oblivious to their presence. This is the true nourishment of life. To seek limitless knowledge with a limited nature—how could one not be exhausted? Already exhausted by knowledge yet not knowing to stop, and then using knowledge to remedy it—this is nourishing yet harming, truly perilous indeed.\n\nForgetting good and evil and abiding in the center, allowing all things to act of themselves, merging obscurely with what is most fitting—thus, punishments and names stay far away, and the whole principle resides within. Following the center as one’s constant—nourishing kin with appropriateness. If one attains the center and moves in profound obscurity, then nothing is impossible. Nourishing life does not seek to exceed one’s allotment; it is merely to fulfill the principle and complete one’s years.\n\nWhen Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui, his hands touched, his shoulders leaned, his feet stepped, his knees pressed. With a *hua* sound, the blade sang *huo*—all in perfect rhythm, matching the dance of Mulberry Grove, attaining the harmony of Jing Shou’s music.\"\n\nLord Wenhui exclaimed, \"Ah, excellent! How has your skill reached such heights?\" He spoke of how Cook Ding seized every advantage to apply his craft, leaving no joint unloosed, fully exhausting the principle—both perfectly suiting the ox’s structure and harmonizing with the rhythm. Cook Ding set down his blade and replied, \"What your servant delights in is the Dao, which advances beyond mere skill. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the whole ox. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. Now, I encounter it with spirit rather than sight; my senses halt while my spirit moves. I rely on the natural patterns, cleaving great gaps, guiding into great cavities, following what is inherently so. Even the finest knots of sinew and bone have never once impeded me—how much less the great bones! A good cook changes his blade every year, for he cuts; an ordinary cook changes his blade every month, for he hacks. My blade has now endured nineteen years, carving several thousand oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. For where the joints have spaces, and the blade has no thickness—entering with what has no thickness into what has space, how vast is the room for the blade to move! Thus, after nineteen years, my blade’s edge remains as if newly whetted. Yet whenever I come to a complex cluster, I see the difficulty, grow wary with caution, focus my gaze, slow my action, and move the blade with utmost subtlety. Then, with a *huo* sound, the ox falls apart, unaware of its death, like earth crumbling to the ground. I stand holding the blade, look around in all four directions, linger in satisfaction, then wipe the blade clean and put it away.\" Here, the principle is lodged within the skill—yet what he delights in is not the skill itself.\n\nThough he has yet to perceive the spaces within the principle, he merely perceives the spaces within the principle. The office of scrutiny is abandoned, and the mind is left to follow the principle’s course without obstruction. He does not cut across it forcibly. Where there are boundaries, he strikes along them to part the joints; where nodes and hollows lie, he guides the blade to separate them. The knife is never applied recklessly. The marvel of his skill lies in its constant movement through emptiness, never once encountering even the slightest resistance.\n\nThe *gū* is the great bone that turns back on itself, dulling the blade—because it does not meet the spaces within the principle. To strike bone is to break the knife. The *xing* is the whetstone. Where sinews and bones intertwine and cluster, he no longer fixes his gaze on other things. His hand moves slowly, for when he finds the proper point, little force is needed. The principle is divided without trace of the blade, as if earth were merely heaped together.\n\n\"Leisurely steps, ample ease, and self-contentment\"—this is what it means. He wipes the blade clean and sheathes it.\n\nPrince Wenhui said, \"Excellent! From the words of Pao Ding, I have learned how to nourish life.\" Since the knife may be nourished, he knew that life, too, may be nourished.\n\nGongwen Xuan, seeing the Master of the Right, was startled and said, \"Who is this man? Why is he one-legged? Was this given by Heaven?\"\n\n\"Was it man who did this to him?\"\n\"It was Heaven, not man. Heaven’s creation made him solitary; man’s form has companionship. From this we know it was Heaven, not man.\"\n\n*Jie* is the name for partial amputation. What knowledge cannot remedy is Heaven’s doing; to violate what one knows is man’s doing. Partial amputation is called solitude. If a master’s knowledge, confined to one school, cannot preserve both feet, then this is what knowledge cannot remedy. Were the Master of the Right to insist on preserving both with his knowledge, his spirit would be inwardly distressed and his body outwardly ruined—how could it be merely partial amputation? To walk with both feet is to have companionship. One who has companionship in form never doubts it is fate. Since having companionship is fate, we know that solitude is likewise not of one’s own doing.\n\nThus, one who grasps the essence of life does not strive for what life cannot achieve; one who grasps the essence of fate does not strive for what fate cannot remedy. They merely preserve their natural state.\n\nA marsh pheasant takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink, yet it does not seek to be kept in a cage. Though its spirit flourishes, it is not content. *Qi* means to seek; *fan* is what cages the pheasant. To move freely between heaven and earth, to wander in the realm of self-contentment—this is the subtlety of nourishing life. Why seek to enter a cage and be tamed?\n\nWhat begins in comfort and never ceases to be comfortable forgets comfort. The pheasant’s spirit flourishes, its will and qi overflow with ease, and it roams the clear and open land, unaware that it is doing well.\n\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to mourn him. He cried out three times and left. A disciple said, \"Was he not your friend?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then is it proper to mourn him like this?\"\n\"At first I thought he was a man like others, but now I see he was not.\"\n\nWhen others mourn, I mourn; when others wail, I wail. They found it strange that I did not linger at the door to observe the transformations, yet I cried out three times. \"Yes. At first I thought he was a man, but now I know he was not.\"\n\nEarlier, when I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and the young weeping as if for their own mothers. Those who gathered there must have been moved to speak when they had no wish to speak, to weep when they had no wish to weep. This is fleeing from Heaven and betraying one’s nature, forgetting what one has received—what the ancients called \"the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.\" When he came, Master, it was timely; when he departed, it was in accord. To rest content in timeliness and dwell in accord is to be beyond the reach of sorrow and joy—what the ancients called \"the Great Release.\"\n\nThe perfected person has no fixed emotions, merely joining the crowd in lamentation, and thus this was fitting. The nature one receives from Heaven has its own proper measure; it cannot be escaped, nor can it be augmented. To flee from Heaven’s principle and multiply worldly attachments, to let sorrow and joy pass through one’s heart, is to bind the spirit in suffering, no different from torture or punishment. The enlightened of old held such views.\n\nLife arises in its time; principle dictates death. Sorrow and joy arise from loss and gain. But the one who has attained profound communion with change is at peace in every moment, at home in every circumstance, darkly one with the workings of creation. Then nothing is not oneself—what gain or loss, what life or death could there be? Thus, following what one has received, sorrow and joy find no place to settle.\n\nTo take what is bound as \"suspended\" is to see that what is unbound is \"released from suspension.\" Released from suspension, the true nature of life and destiny is attained. This is the essence of nourishing life.\n\nA finger may be exhausted in feeding the flame, but the fire is passed on, never knowing its end. \"Exhausted\" means used up; \"feeding the flame\" is like the earlier fuel. The earlier fuel is consumed by the finger, and when the principle of the earlier fuel is exhausted, the fire is transmitted and does not die. The heart receives nourishment within, so life continues without end. This makes clear that nourishing life is the very means by which life lives.\n\nTime does not come again; the present does not pause even once. Thus human life is but a single breath, a single moment of attainment. The breath just past is not the breath now; thus nourishment is received and life continues. The earlier flame is not the later flame; thus the fuel is consumed and the fire is passed on. The fire is passed on and life continues—this comes from nourishing to its utmost. How could the world know that what is exhausted is reborn?\n\nFrom *Zhuangzi*, \"Inner Chapters,\" \"The Human World\" (Chapter Four):\nYan Hui sought an audience with Confucius to request leave to depart.\n\nConfucius said, \"Where are you going?\"\nYan Hui replied, \"I am going to the state of Wei.\"\nConfucius asked, \"What will you do there?\"\nYan Hui said, \"I have heard that the lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats his state lightly and does not recognize his faults. He treats the lives of his people as of little worth, and the dead are measured by the state as if they were marshland—like reeds, the people have nowhere to turn. I once heard you say, ‘Leave a well-ordered state; go to a disordered one. The gate of a physician sees many illnesses.’ I wish to apply what I have heard and reflect on what I might do, hoping that the state may yet be cured.\"\n\nOne who mingles with others cannot depart from them. Yet the vicissitudes of the human world differ in every age, and only those who are without fixed intent and do not rely on their own judgment can adapt to change without bearing its burdens. They do not share the desires of the people.\n\nNow, one who rules others acts only by riding upon them. In anger, corpses lie strewn and blood flows; in pleasure, carriages and caps fill the roads. Thus the ruler’s use of the state cannot be taken lightly. None dare remonstrate with him. He treats life as if it were of no account, leading the entire state into the realm of death, beyond numbering, regarding them as mere grass or mustard seeds. They have nowhere to turn.\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas! You are likely to go and be punished! The Dao does not tolerate杂乱. When it is杂乱, it becomes多; when it is多, it becomes扰; when it is扰, it brings忧, and忧 cannot be saved. The utmost person of old first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. If what is established within oneself is not yet settled, how can one have leisure to attend to the conduct of a violent man? The Dao is insufficient to save their troubles.\n\nIt is fitting to find the right person. If one does not find the right person, then even if a hundred physicians guard the illness, it will only deepen doubt and fail to bring even a single cure. If one does not respond to things with an empty mind but instead exhausts their thoughts in reckless action, it shows that what is established within themselves is not yet settled.\n\nOnly by setting aside knowledge to nurture the true, entrusting the wondrous to the talents of the multitude, attributing merit and fame to others while keeping worries and concerns far from oneself—only then can one attend to the conduct of a violent man.\n\nMoreover, do you also know whence virtue’s dissipation and knowledge’s emergence arise? Virtue dissipates for the sake of fame; knowledge emerges from contention. Fame is that by which people vie; knowledge is the instrument of contention. Both are inauspicious tools, not the means to fulfill one’s conduct.\n\nThe reason virtue flows away is pride in fame; the reason knowledge spreads recklessly is contention over goodness. Even Jie and Zhi, in what they prized, sought nothing but fame and goodness. Fame and wisdom are what the world employs, yet when fame arises, contention follows; when wisdom is used, strife emerges. Thus only by abandoning fame and knowledge can one’s conduct be fulfilled.\n\nMoreover, thick virtue and steadfast trust do not yet reach others’ *qi*; a reputation for non-contention does not yet reach others’ hearts. To forcibly display the language of benevolence and righteousness, compass and square, before a violent man is to make others resent what is beautiful in oneself—this is called ‘harming others.’ One who harms others will surely be harmed in return. You are likely to be harmed by others.\n\nIf one merely delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, what need is there to seek distinction? If you do not issue commands, the lords and dukes will surely ride upon others to vie in cleverness. Your eyes will be dazzled, your complexion will become placid, your mouth will scheme, your demeanor will take shape, and your heart will be formed. This is like using fire to save fire, water to save water—it is called ‘increasing abundance.’ Following the beginning without end, if you go with insincere grand words, you will surely die before the violent man!\n\nWhen one offers a luminous pearl at night, few do not grasp their sword—because they do not understand. Now, your virtue, trust, and reputation for non-contention are things he does not yet understand. To forcibly apply the standards of benevolence and righteousness to him, he will think you wish to destroy others to establish yourself.\n\nThus the utmost person does not exhaust their will in ordering the world but responds to things with an empty mind. Sincerity and trust are manifest in heaven and earth; non-contention flows freely among the myriad things. Only then do the myriad things return to embrace them, heaven and earth do not oppose them. Thus their virtuous reputation spreads, and the world responds in harmony; their illustrious conduct shines, and the six directions all answer. Only then can one traverse cold and heat, cross order and chaos, without clashing with the scales of the dragon.\n\nIf one’s approach is not trusted, they will think you contend for fame and turn to harm you. If one can delight in the worthy and despise the foolish, hear of righteousness and submit, then they are a enlightened ruler. If they are an enlightened ruler, then they do not苦于 lack worthy ministers—your going would not be extraordinary. If they are not so, going will surely bring harm.\n\nThus, to go with intent is to go without success; to respond without intent is to have response come of itself—then there is no going that is not possible. You need only be silent and speechless. If you speak, the lords and dukes will surely ride upon others with the power of rulership, using their clever eloquence to reject remonstrance and adorn their faults. Their words will be clever and swift, dazzling the eyes. You will not be able to distinguish yourself from them, nor will you have leisure to save yourself—you will only cast yourself aside to follow them. If you cannot save them, you will only strengthen their authority.\n\nThe common and constant cling to the old and are unwilling to change. If one is not trusted and remonstrates, even grand words will bring harm.\n\nMoreover, in ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan. Both were those who cultivated themselves and humbly served the people, yet they offended their superiors—thus their lords used their cultivation to cast them out. They were lovers of fame.\n\nIn ancient times, Yao attacked Cong, Zhi, Xu, and Ao; Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became desolate and ruined, their persons subjected to punishment and execution. Their use of arms did not cease; their pursuit of fame and substance knew no end. These were all seekers of fame and substance—have you alone not heard of this? Fame and substance are things even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can you!\"\n\n\"Even so, if you must have some way, try telling it to me.\"\n\nGuan Longfeng and Prince Bigan, though subordinates, took on the burdens of their superiors—tasks not rightfully theirs. They did not wish to let ministers gain the reputation of surpassing their lords. Tyrannical rulers not only seek to indulge their desires but also pursue fame; it is only that what they seek is not the Dao.\n\nRulers who covet fame and desire, even if they were Yao or Yu, cannot be transformed. Thus, the multitude attacks them—yet you would go empty-handed to transform them with the Dao?\n\nYan Hui said, \"If I maintain integrity while emptying my heart, and strive for unity, would that suffice?\"\n\n\"To rectify one’s form while emptying one’s heart—this is to speak with deference and without duplicity.\" He replied, \"It will not suffice.\"\n\nYan Hui asked, \"Why not? If one’s yang qi is full to overflowing, with shifting colors and an unsteady demeanor—common people dare not oppose it. One seizes upon others’ emotions to seek harmony with their hearts. This is called a virtue that gradually fails to take shape—how much less can great virtue be achieved! Such a one clings rigidly without transformation, outwardly compliant yet inwardly unyielding—how could this ever work?\"\n\nThis describes the Lord of Wei: his overbearing yang nature swells within and flaunts itself without, reaching the height of arrogance. His joy and anger are unpredictable; none dare defy him. Such extreme obstinacy leads him to respond to others’ flattery with indulgence, then crush them to assert his dominance, seeking ease and self-indulgence to satisfy his extravagant desires. His words grow ever more excessive, with no restraint or humility. Thus, he clings to his original intent. Outwardly compliant yet inwardly unyielding—this is merely the earlier \"integrity with an empty heart and striving for unity,\" which is insufficient to transform him.\n\n\"Then let me be inwardly upright and outwardly yielding, achieving through emulation of the ancients. To be inwardly upright is to follow Heaven. One who follows Heaven knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven—why then should one seek others’ approval for one’s words, whether they deem them good or not? Such a one is called a childlike follower of Heaven.\n\nTo be outwardly yielding is to follow others. Raising hands in respect, kneeling in submission, bowing in deference—these are the rites of a minister. If all others do so, how dare I not? To do what others do is to avoid their censure—this is called following others.\n\nTo achieve through emulation of the ancients is to follow the past. Though my words may instruct, their substance is fitting and true, for they belong to the ancients, not to me. Thus, though upright, they bring no harm—this is called following the ancients. Would this suffice?\"\n\nYan Hui further expounded these three principles.\n\nAll things, noble or base, share the same gift of life. Thus, whether good or not, one entrusts it to impartial judgment—seeking nothing from others. Following Heaven’s principle, one extends from one’s nature and trusts destiny, proceeding as straightforwardly as an infant. Outwardly yielding, one adapts to what human affairs demand. Achieving in the present while emulating the past, though this be common instruction, it carries a veiled admonition. By lodging uprightness in antiquity, one avoids bringing harm upon oneself.\n\nConfucius said: “Alas! How can this suffice? Too many policies and laws breed discord. Though firmly held, they incur no blame. Yet this is all there is—how can it bring about transformation? It remains self-willed. Though the principle admits no duality, to govern by these three methods is to fail to merge with affairs. Though not grand, one may yet avoid censure. Blame is absent, but transformation is not. Wielding these three arts to suit circumstances is not to act without intention and entrust all to the world.”\n\nYan Hui said: “I have nothing more to advance. May I ask for your method?”\n\nConfucius said: “Fast, and I will tell you. To act with intention—is this easy? Those who deem it easy do not accord with the vastness of Heaven.”\n\nYan Hui said: “My family is poor. For months now, I have neither drunk wine nor eaten meat. May this be considered fasting?”\n\nConfucius replied: “This is the fast of sacrificial rites, not the fast of the mind.”\n\nYan Hui asked: “May I inquire about the fast of the mind?”\n\nConfucius said: “Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. The ears are limited to hearing, the mind to recognition. Qi, however, is emptiness that awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fast of the mind.”\n\nTo act with intention in the mind is indeed not easy. Those who deem intentional action easy have not seen its propriety. Abandon heterodoxies and entrust yourself to singularity. Forsake the senses, discard the mind’s intentions, and align with the self-attainment of qi and nature—this is emptiness awaiting things. When the mind is emptied, the supreme Dao gathers within.\n\nYan Hui said: “Before I was enabled to practice this, I was truly Yan Hui; once enabled, I was no longer Yan Hui—may this be called emptiness?”\n\nNot yet having practiced the fast of the mind, one remains bound to the self.\n\nThe Master said: “Perfect! I shall tell you: if you can enter and wander within its enclosure without being moved by its name, then when it enters, you will respond; when it does not enter, you will cease. Without gate, without governance, dwelling in a single abode and lodging in inevitability—this is near indeed. Having attained the service of the mind’s fast, you will be without self. The realm where the unmoored mind attains itself is where one halts at the real. It is like the notes of the pentatonic scale: they respond without intention, and thus are called ‘resonance.’ To respond without intention is to follow the other’s ear, not to force a response. Let things be as they are—this is ‘without gate.’ Entrust the world’s natural ease—this is ‘without governance.’ *Du* means ‘to govern.’ Inevitability is what principle necessarily entails, the abode of supreme oneness meeting the tally of necessity. Principle is exhausted in this.\n\n“To sever traces is easy; to walk without treading the earth is difficult. To be employed by man is easy to feign; to be employed by Heaven is difficult to feign. We have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings; we have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. Behold that empty chamber: in a vacant room, whiteness arises, and auspiciousness comes to rest. If it does not come to rest, this is called ‘sitting in motion.’ To follow the ears and eyes, turning inward while the mind’s knowledge remains external—then even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell, let alone men! This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the ultimate course of Fuxi and Jiqu, and how much more so for those who are scattered!\n\n“Not acting is easy; to act without treading the earth is impossible. Non-doing is easy; to act without harming one’s nature is unattainable. What sight and hearing obtain is coarse, and thus easily deceived. But the recompense of the natural is subtle, and thus difficult to feign. The less one loses of the real, the less one is incomplete; the more one loses of the real, the more one is incomplete. The recompense of loss and gain never fails to match its measure. To defy Heaven and act falsely—is this not difficult indeed?\n\n“Words must have their means to accomplish their ends. Now, without the abode of utmost emptiness, how can one have the reality of transforming things? To regard being as non-being is the vacant room. In a vacant room, purity and whiteness arise alone. Where auspiciousness gathers is in utmost emptiness and stillness. If one does not halt at what is fitting, does not meet the ultimate, this is to spend the day sitting in response while galloping without cease. Thus, before external enemies arrive, one is already exhausted within—how can one transform things?\n\n“To close the ears and eyes and yet attain naturally is to have turned the mind’s knowledge outward. Therefore, to follow one’s nature and move directly, going nowhere without darkness—how could one be burdened by the obscure and hidden, let alone the entanglements of the human world? Things have no nobility or baseness; none fails to communicate through the mind’s knowledge and the ears and eyes. Thus, what the world calls ‘knowing’—is it knowing by desiring to know? What it calls ‘seeing’—is it seeing by desiring to see? If knowing and seeing could be obtained by desire, then could one desire worthiness and obtain worthiness, or act as a sage and become a sage? Certainly not. Yet the world does not know that knowing knows itself, and so desires to act as knowing to know; it does not see that seeing sees itself, and so desires to act as seeing to see; it does not know that life lives itself, and so seeks to act as life to live. Thus, seeing the eye, one demands the clarity of Li Zhu; hearing the ear, one demands the acuity of Shi Kuang. The spirit gallops within, the ears and eyes are exhausted without, the body is ill at ease, and one is no longer darkly attuned to things. Not being darkly attuned, how can one harmonize with the changes of the human world or respond to the rhythms of generation after generation? This has never been.\n\nDuke Ye of She, about to be sent on a mission to Qi, asked Confucius: ‘The king’s charge to me is most weighty. Qi’s treatment of envoys is likely to be respectful but not urgent. Even a common man cannot be moved, let alone a feudal lord! I am deeply apprehensive. You once told me: “In all matters, great or small, few fail to achieve joy through the Dao. If the matter does not succeed, there will surely be human calamity; if it succeeds, there will surely be the calamity of yin and yang. Only one of power can succeed or fail without disaster.” I eat coarse food without refinement, and my cook has no desire for coolness. Yet this morning I received my charge and by evening was drinking ice—is this not inner heat? I have not yet reached the truth of the matter, yet I already suffer the calamity of yin and yang! If the matter does not succeed, there will surely be human calamity—this is a double burden. As a minister, I am not equal to this task. Pray, tell me what to do!’\n\nThe weight of the mission stems from the desire for something. One fears that Qi will merely return empty respect without urgently meeting the request. In matters great or small, few fail to achieve joy through speaking of success. This is what Confucius once told me. Those who speak of success as joy will be angered if it does not come. This is something even the King of Chu cannot avoid. Though the human calamity may pass, joy and fear still war in the breast, and ice has already congealed in the five viscera. Only one of power can entrust success or failure to the other without troubling the mind.\n\nFacing the fire without thinking of coolness shows the frugality of his fare. That his fare is frugal yet he drinks ice with inner heat—this is truly due to anxiety over the difficulty of the matter, not the allure of fine food. Before the matter is settled, one only fears it will not succeed. If it truly does not succeed, then fear will congeal within while the net of punishment and the web of law ensnare without.”\n\nConfucius said: “Under Heaven there are two great precepts: one is fate, the other is duty. Your love for your parents is fate, which cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is nowhere he can go that is not his lord, no place in Heaven and Earth he can escape.”\n\nThis is called the great precept. Thus, in serving one’s parents, to be at ease without choosing the place is the utmost of filial piety; in serving one’s lord, to be at ease without choosing the task is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own heart, neither sorrow nor joy alters what lies before it—knowing the inevitable and accepting it as fate is the perfection of virtue. For a minister nearing the throne, there are indeed things he cannot avoid. Acting with the truth of the matter while forgetting himself—how could he have leisure to delight in life and dread death? The Master’s conduct is thus fitting! Naturally bound and firm, it cannot be undone.\n\nWhen a thousand gather, if none is taken as master, disorder will lead to dissolution. Thus, many worthy men cannot have many lords, and without worthies there cannot be no lord—this is the Dao of Heaven and man, the inevitable principle. If a lord could be fled and parents untied, there would be no need for precepts. Knowing the inevitable as fate and accepting it, one has neither sorrow nor joy—how could these be altered? Thus, obscurely taking what one encounters as fate and not applying the mind to it, merging utterly with what is most fitting without joy or sorrow within, even in serving ordinary men, one finds no place that is not fitting—how much more so with lord and parents!\n\nMatters have their inevitabilities, principles are fundamentally constant. Thus, entrusting them brings success, and where matters succeed yet the self is not preserved—this has never been. Why then trouble the mind over the self? Principles are unobstructed, so one should simply proceed with what one encounters. If one’s faith in the Dao is not steadfast and likes and dislikes linger in the heart, unable to proceed with what is most fitting while scheming for life and fearing death—I have never seen such a one succeed.\n\nQiu respectfully repeats what he has heard: In close relations, trust must be mutually confirmed; in distant relations, loyalty must be conveyed through words. Words must sometimes be transmitted. Transmitting words of mutual joy or mutual anger is the most difficult thing under Heaven. For mutual joy invariably brings excessive praise, and mutual anger invariably brings excessive blame. All excess is false, and falsehood cannot be trusted. Where trust is lacking, the transmitter of words brings calamity. Thus, the standard teaching says: *\"Transmit the constant truth, do not transmit excessive words, and you will be nearly whole.\"*\n\nThose nearby can verify, so their trust is confirmed through direct contact. Those afar must convey intent through words. Words of joy and anger, if they exceed reality, should be transmitted so that neither side loses the mean—thus it is not easy. *Excess* means going beyond. Words of joy and anger always exceed what is fitting. Suspecting the words are not his, one may think the transmitter fabricates. Doubt arises. If excessive words are transmitted, it seems like wild falsehood. The receiver doubts, and the transmitter is arbitrarily blamed for exaggeration or understatement. Even if one hears momentary excess, do not transmit it. One must cite the constant truth and grasp the sincere intent—then one is close to wholeness.\n\nMoreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin in openness but often end in secrecy; when taken to excess, they resort to strange tricks. Those who drink with ritual begin in order but often end in chaos; when taken to excess, they indulge in strange pleasures. All things are thus: they begin in sincerity but often end in baseness. Their inception is simple, but their conclusion must be grand.\n\nWords are like wind and waves; actions bring gain or loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred, gain and loss easily endangered. Thus, anger arises without cause, and clever words lead to biased speech. When beasts are cornered and dying, their cries are desperate, their breath disordered—then vicious hearts arise together. If scrutiny is too severe, unworthy intentions will respond, and one does not know why. If one does not know why, who knows where it will end? Thus, the standard teaching says: *\"Do not alter commands, do not urge completion. Going beyond is harmful.\"* Altering commands and urging completion endanger affairs.\n\nTrue excellence takes time; evil, once done, cannot be undone—can one not be cautious? Originally, they played together in good humor. When the desire to win arises, it secretly harms the other, no longer following reason. There are distinctions between high and low, and toasts follow order. Yet they sink into drunkenness, indulging without restraint, reaching every excess. Trouble arises from simplicity, affairs begin in small things—this is the inevitable course.\n\nWords are like wind and waves, so acting on them brings gain or loss. Thus, if one leaves wind and waves unacted upon, gain is not lost. If affairs attain their truth, danger can be stabilized and turmoil settled. The arising of anger has no other cause—it always comes from clever words exceeding reality or biased speech missing the mark. Like wild beasts driven into a corner, their cries are urgent, their breath disordered, their anger violent, and both develop sores to face each other.\n\nOne who is tolerant and accommodates others will surely be sought out. If scrutiny is too precise, a miserly heart arises unnoticed. Thus, the great man lets things drift freely in their own realm, not begrudging others’ abilities, not exhausting others’ joy—thus the bonds of the Four Seas can be preserved. If one does not realize this, how can one know where fortune and misfortune converge?\n\nTransmit the truth of the other. Let it come to fruition on its own. Adding to it is not entrusting the truth. This is how affairs become perilous. Excellence comes from allowing things to transform in their time—like planting, it cannot be rushed. If one urges what the other dislikes to force completion, regret and failure soon follow.\n\nMoreover, riding things to roam the mind, entrusting the unavoidable to nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there to act in return? It is best to deliver one’s mandate—this is the difficult part. Entrusting one’s intent to things, following the inevitable principles, the harmony of the mean is complete—this is the utmost in engaging with others. One should simply accept the truth of what is owed in return—why contrive intentions in the space between?\n\nDelivering one’s mandate directly is easiest, yet applying joy and anger to the mind makes it difficult.\n\nYan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei. He asked Qu Boyu, “There is a man here whose virtue is as harsh as Heaven’s execution. If I deal with him without restraint, I endanger our state; if I deal with him with restraint, I endanger myself. His knowledge suffices only to recognize others’ faults, not to see why they err. What should I do in such a case?”\n\nThe nature of petty men is this: if you guide them by rules, they resent you; if you let them run unchecked, they throw the state into chaos. Unaware that the people’s faults arise from themselves, they blame the people and never reform. Qu Boyu said, “Excellent question! Be on guard, be cautious—first rectify yourself! In form, nothing surpasses compliance; in mind, nothing surpasses harmony. Yet these two have their perils. Compliance must not become submission; harmony must not become display. If form complies and submits, you will be overthrown, destroyed, collapsed, or stumbling. If mind harmonizes and displays itself, you will be reduced to fame, reputation, omen, or calamity.\n\nLet him be an infant, and you be an infant with him. Let him be without boundaries, and you be without boundaries with him. Let him be without limits, and you be without limits with him. Guide him to enter flawlessness. Through repeated encounters and meetings, both will thus rectify themselves. In form, do not oppose; in harmony, do not conform. Compliance in form is yielding; submission is merging completely. Harmony is aided by principle; display is self-promotion. If you merge completely, you will stumble and not support him, perishing together. Therefore, you must model yourself on Heaven and Earth, differing only in small matters.\n\nIf you display harmony, you will gain a reputation for tolerance, yet aiding his fame will make him resent your superiority and recklessly spawn calamity. Thus, you must remain obscure as dusk, blending like dust in radiance. Then you cannot be claimed as close or distant, benefited or harmed. Do not set small edges against his scales.\n\nDo you not know the mantis? It brandishes its arms to block the chariot wheel, unaware it cannot bear the task—such is the beauty of its talent. Beware, be cautious! To accumulate your strengths and beauties to challenge him is perilous! The mantis’s brandished arm is not without beauty, yet blocking the chariot wheel is simply no match. Now, with knowledge insufficient to handle the task, you seek to forcefully bear it—this is the mantis’s brandished arm. To accumulate your talents, boast your beauties, and challenge this man is the path to danger.\n\nDo you not know those who raise tigers? They dare not feed them live animals, for fear of provoking their killing rage; they dare not feed them whole animals, for fear of provoking their tearing rage. They time their hunger and satiety, understanding their angry hearts. Tigers and humans are of different kinds, yet tigers fawn on those who raise them—this is compliance. Thus, those they kill are those who oppose them. They fear that a killing intent will lead to rage. If you make the tiger bite and divide its food, it will use force and grow angry. Know the cause of its anger and comply with it. Compliance with principle makes even different kinds grow affectionate; opposition to rhythm makes even the closest kin turn to arms.\n\nThose who love horses use baskets to collect their dung and clamshells to collect their urine. Yet if a mosquito or fly alights and they strike it untimely, the horse may break its bit or shatter its chest. Love can reach a point where it causes loss. Can one not be cautious?”\n\nThe dung and urine are most base, yet one uses precious vessels to collect them—this is the utmost love for the horse. Servants bustle about the horse, though they remove its troubles, they startle it unawares. Startling it when unprepared thus causes such alarm. The intent to eliminate harm, hastily striking it, leads to destruction—losing the very reason for love. Thus, in dealing with things in the world, one must be cautious at the juncture of compliance and opposition.\n\nWhen Carpenter Shi traveled to Qi, he reached Quyuan and saw an oak that was a spirit tree. Its size could shade thousands of oxen, its girth measured a hundred spans, its height towered over the mountains, and only after rising eighty feet did branches appear. Those that could be made into boats numbered over ten at its side. Onlookers thronged like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter did not glance at it and continued on his way without pause. His disciple, having feasted his eyes, caught up to Carpenter Shi and said, “Since I took up the axe to follow you, master, I have never seen timber so fine as this. Why does my teacher refuse to look and walk on without stopping?” He replied, “Enough! Say no more! It is but a useless tree.”\n\n\"As timber for boats, it would sink; for coffins and outer caskets, it would swiftly rot; for vessels, it would quickly break; for doors and gates, it would ooze sap; for pillars, it would be worm-eaten—this is a tree of no use. Having no use, it has thus attained such longevity.\" Not counted among the useful, it is called a \"scattered tree.\"\n\nCarpenter Shi returned home, and the spirit oak appeared to him in a dream, saying: \"With what will you compare me? Will you compare me to the cultivated trees? Those such as the hawthorn, pear, orange, and pomelo—fruit-bearing kinds—once their fruits ripen, they are stripped, and once stripped, they are shamed. Their great branches are broken, their small branches are torn. This is how their abilities bring suffering to their lives. Thus, they do not fulfill their natural lifespan but die midway, struck down by the common world. All things are like this. Moreover, I have long sought to be of no use! Nearly dead, only now have I attained it—this is my great use. Had I been useful, could I have grown so vast? Furthermore, you and I are both things—why then do you assess me as a thing? And you, a nearly dead scattered man, how could you understand a scattered tree?\"\n\nAll useful trees are called \"cultivated trees.\" All things harm themselves by their own usefulness. Many have glanced askance at me, but only you, Carpenter Shi, have understood. The accumulation of uselessness becomes the great use for preserving life. If useful, it would long since have been felled.\n\nThis was the spirit oak’s jest with Carpenter Shi. Carpenter Shi awoke and interpreted his dream. His disciple said: \"If it delights in being useless, then why does it serve as a spirit tree?\" He replied: \"Hush! Say no more!\"\n\nThat tree merely lodges there by chance! It takes those who do not understand it as its revilers. Had it not become a spirit tree, it would nearly have been felled! Moreover, what it preserves differs from the multitude, yet to explain it through righteousness—how far removed is that!\n\nIt still resents being honored as a spirit tree, rather than simply delighting in its uselessness. The spirit merely comes to lodge there—this tree does not seek to become a spirit. The tree takes being a spirit as a humiliation from those who do not understand it—how could this be an honor!\n\nThe tree itself takes its uselessness as its use; thus, even if it were not a spirit tree, it would still ultimately avoid the harm of being felled. It preserves itself by having nothing to preserve, while the multitude preserves itself by having something to preserve. Benefiting others, fostering growth, and restraining wrongdoing—these are the duties of a spirit tree.\n\nThe useless one, serene and inactive, allows all talents to be used; those who are \"useful\" each attain their proper place without interference. This is how the useless preserves life. You praise it as a spirit tree—how could it not draw near to harm!\n\n---\n\nNanbo Ziqi wandered in the hills of Shang and saw a great tree, one unlike any other: its shade could shelter a thousand chariots, and travelers would take refuge beneath its foliage. Ziqi said: \"What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary timber!\" Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and unfit for beams or rafters; looking down at its massive roots, he saw they were split and unfit for coffins or outer caskets. Licking its leaves, his mouth blistered and burned; smelling it, he became wildly intoxicated, raving for three days without cease. Yet its branches’ shade could shelter a thousand chariots.\n\nZiqi said: \"This is truly a useless tree—how else could it have grown so vast? Alas, the spirit-like person takes this uselessness as their way.\"\n\nThe king who is \"useless\" among his officials allows his ministers to manage their affairs: the clear-sighted to see, the keen-eared to listen, the wise to plan, the brave to defend. What does he do? He remains profoundly still. And when all talents do not overstep their proper place, this \"uselessness\" becomes what all talents ultimately rely upon. Thus, the world delights in exalting him without tiring, and he rides upon the ten thousand things without harm.\n\n---\n\nIn Song there was a region called Jing, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those with trunks the size of an arm-span were felled by those seeking pegs for monkey perches; those three or four spans around were felled by those seeking timber for grand and famous structures; those seven or eight spans around were felled by the households of nobles and wealthy merchants seeking sideboards for their halls. Thus, they did not live out their natural years but were cut down midway by axes—this is the calamity of being useful.\n\nTherefore, when exorcists release a white-foreheaded ox, a snub-nosed pig, or a person with hemorrhoids, they do not allow them to cross the river. The shamans know this—these are considered inauspicious. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like person regards as the greatest auspice.\n\nThose with talent cannot help but cherish it. Shamans perform exorcisms, casting aside these three, and only then do they carefully select unblemished sacrificial animals before daring to use them. The shamans know that the untalented remain whole. To preserve life is what the world calls auspicious, yet shamans regard the untalented as inauspicious and do not use them. They, by being \"inauspicious,\" preserve life—this is the greatest auspice.\n\nThe spirit-like person has no mind of their own and follows things as they are. Thus, what the world calls the greatest auspice, the spirit-like person does not oppose.\n\n---\n\nThere was a man named Zhili Shu, whose chin was hidden in his navel, shoulders higher than his head, the crown of his skull pointing to the sky, his five organs above, his thighs beside his ribs. By mending needles and washing clothes, he earned enough to feed himself; by sifting husks and winnowing grain, he could feed ten people. When the authorities conscripted soldiers, Zhili Shu waved his arms and wandered among them; when there were great labor projects, Zhili Shu, citing his chronic illness, was exempt from service; when the authorities distributed grain to the sick, he received three bushels and ten bundles of firewood.\n\nThough his body was deformed, he could still nourish himself and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is \"deformed\"! Relying on his uselessness, he did not hide himself away. Exempt from corvée labor, he did not participate; when gifts were given, he accepted them.\n\nThe spirit-like person is of no use to things, yet things each attain their own use. They ascribe merit and fame to the multitude, merging with things without a trace. Thus, they avoid the harm of the human realm and dwell in the substance of constant beauty—this is one whose virtue is \"deformed.\"\n\n---\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, Jie Yu, the madman of Chu, wandered by his gate and sang:\n\nPhoenix, phoenix,\nHow your virtue has declined!\nThe future cannot be awaited,\nThe past cannot be retrieved.\nWhen the world has the Dao,\nThe sage achieves;\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nThe sage survives.\nIn this present age,\nOne barely escapes punishment.\nFortune is lighter than a feather,\nYet none know how to bear it.\nDo not look ahead or behind—\nFully grasp the present moment.\nOblivious, merge with the times,\nAnd only then can you be perfectly attuned, avoid punishment and disgrace.\nLeave your feet free to wander,\nYour hands free to act,\nLet your ears hear what they hear,\nYour eyes see what they see.\nKnow to stop where you do not know,\nDo only what you can do.\nUse what is naturally useful,\nAct as is naturally fitting.\nFollow your nature within,\nWithout the slightest concern for what lies beyond—\nThis is the utmost ease of non-action.\n\nNo one who practices non-action fails to preserve their nature and life; and where nature and life are preserved, misfortune is, in principle, unheard of. Thus, what we call fortune is nothing other than this very preservation—it is not borrowed from external things, nor does it bear the weight of a goose feather. To move in accord with one’s nature, never exceeding its bounds, is the utmost ease in the world; to lift what lifts itself, to bear what bears itself, is the utmost lightness in the world. Yet because people harm their nature with boundless knowledge and disturb their true heart with likes and dislikes, they abandon this utmost ease of non-action to pursue the utmost difficulty of action, and discard this utmost lightness of self-lifting to take on the utmost weight of bearing others. This is the common affliction of the world.\n\nDisaster is heavier than the earth,\nYet none know how to avoid it.\nIf one acts from within their nature,\nEven bearing ten thousand jun feels weightless;\nIf one relies on external things,\nEven a weight no heavier than a zhu or a zhi becomes unbearable.\nActing from within brings fortune,\nThus fortune is supremely light;\nActing from without brings disaster,\nThus disaster is supremely heavy.\nThat disaster is supremely heavy yet none know how to avoid it—\nThis is the world’s great delusion.\n\nEnough, enough!\nTo govern others with virtue is perilous indeed!\nDrawing lines on the ground to make others follow—\nPerilous, perilous!\nForcing others to follow a path you have traced leaves tracks that cannot be concealed;\nImposing one’s own standards upon things prevents harmony with them.\nThus, the great person does not dazzle others with their own brilliance but allows others to find their own clarity; they do not impose their virtue upon others but entrust others to discover their own virtue. In this way, they pervade and unite all things, merging self and other in profound unity, dissolving all distinctions to become one with the world, so that inner and outer share the same fortune.\n\nBewildered yang, bewildered yang—\nDo not harm my path.\n\"Bewildered yang\" means lost yang. If one remains true to their solitary nature without being swayed by externals, their path remains whole.\nIf all in the world preserve their own wholeness,\nThen everything called \"I\" is preserved without exception.\n\nCrooked, crooked—\nDo not harm my feet.\nWhen one’s conduct is perfectly curved, it is self-sufficient.\nMountain trees bring ruin upon themselves;\nFat is consumed by its own flame.\nCinnamon is edible, so it is felled;\nLacquer is useful, so it is cut.\nPeople all know the usefulness of what is useful,\nBut none know the usefulness of what is useless.\nWhat is useful serves others’ purposes;\nWhat is useless preserves its own life.\nThose who carve their flesh for the world are known to the world.\nBut those who ensure the people do not lose their self-preservation, so that self and other are both at ease—\nSuch subtlety is so near at hand that none perceive its wonder within themselves.\n\nFrom *Zhuangzi, Inner Chapters, \"Virtue’s Perfect Correspondence\" (Chapter Five)*\nIn Lu there was a man named Wang Tai who had lost a foot, yet those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. His virtue was full within, and things responded to him without; inner and outer merged in profound harmony, so that he trusted his fate as if it were a tally, forgetting his physical form. His disciples were many, rivaling Confucius in number.\nChangji asked Confucius, “Wang Tai is a man who has lost a foot, yet those who follow him divide Lu equally with you. He neither teaches when standing nor discusses when sitting. Those who go to him empty return full.”\n\nHad there not been a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What manner of man is this? Each finds fulfillment in himself. How strange that though his form is maimed, his heart is so full! When the heart is whole, it leaves the body behind, forgets the five viscera, and wanders alone—none under heaven can depart from it.\n\nConfucius said, “This Master is a sage. I am but a latecomer who has yet to follow him! I shall take him as my teacher—how much more should those who are not my equal! Why limit it to Lu? I shall lead all under heaven to follow him.”\n\nWhen spirit is whole and the heart complete, the body merges with things. One who merges with things cannot be distanced by all under heaven—how could it be merely one state?\n\nChangji said, “He is a cripple, yet he surpasses Master Wang—how far he stands above the common! If this is so, how does he employ his heart?”\n\nConfucius said, “Though life and death are great indeed, he does not change with them. Though heaven and earth collapse, he will not be lost with them. He discerns the unborrowed and does not shift with things; he commands the transformations of things while guarding their root.”\n\nThough people change daily, life and death are the greatest of changes. He moves with change, so life and death do not alter him. This is following it. It clarifies the constancy of nature and fate. He takes transformation as fate and does not oppose it, never departing from the ultimate of rightness.\n\nChangji said, “What does this mean?”\n\nConfucius said, “Viewed in their differences, liver and gall are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed in their sameness, the myriad things are all one. One who is thus wanders his heart in the harmony of virtue, unaware of what ears and eyes deem fitting. He sees what is one in things and does not see what is lost—seeing the loss of a foot as discarding dirt.”\n\nWhen the nature of tranquility and suffering differs, the feelings of beauty and ugliness diverge. Though what is deemed beautiful varies, all share in finding something beautiful. Each finds beauty in what they deem beautiful, so the myriad things share one beauty. Each affirms what they affirm, so all under heaven share one affirmation.\n\nIf one distinguishes things by their differences, then all under heaven is different. But one who gazes with vast equanimity governs heaven and earth, contains the myriad things, and knows that differences are not truly different. Thus, following what is shared, all under heaven is the same. Knowing that sameness is not truly possessed, following what is absent, all distinctions of right and wrong, beauty and ugliness dissolve into nothingness.\n\nTo affirm oneself and negate others, to find beauty in oneself and ugliness in others—from those of middling wisdom down to crawling insects, none fail to do this. Yet this is merely clarity about oneself and obscurity about others. As for those of profound penetration and merging unity, they illuminate all under heaven through all under heaven. When none under heaven say “I am not,” it reveals that none are not; when none say “that is right,” it reveals that none are right. Without right or wrong, all blends into one. Thus, they ride change and follow transformation, opposing things without fear. Having forgotten all preferences, nothing is not entrusted. To entrust all and not attain—this has never been; to attain all and not harmonize—this too has never been heard.\n\nThus, the heart roams freely within the bounds of Dao and virtue, drifting without anything amiss, vast and without constraint. Embracing the wondrous heart of ultimate principle, one is the same with all things. Being the same with all things, in life and death, in change, there is nowhere that is not oneself. Thus, life is my time, death is my following; time is my gathering, following is my scattering. Though gathering and scattering differ, I am always myself. Life is merely my moment—there has never been gain; death is also myself—there has never been loss.\n\nViewing the changes of life and death as one, once their oneness is seen, one sheds all attachments, merges self and other in profound unity, treats life and death as waking and dreaming, the body as an inn. Departing life is like shedding sandals, severing a foot like discarding dirt—I have never seen anything that could entangle such a heart.\n\nChangji said, “He cultivates himself. Through his knowledge, he attains his heart; through his heart, he attains his constant heart. Why should things vie to surpass him?”\n\nKing Tai appeared unable to forget knowledge yet preserve himself, unable to relinquish the heart yet attain self-possession. To attain one’s constant heart is to go forth in equanimity. He seemed unable to go forth in equanimity and encounter things, thus always compelling things to come to him.\n\nConfucius said, “No one mirrors themselves in flowing water, but in still water. Only stillness can still the many stillings. Receiving mandate from earth, only the pine and cypress stand upright, ever green through winter and summer. Receiving mandate from heaven, only Yao and Shun stand upright, at the head of all things. Fortunate to rectify life, they rectify the lives of all. The proof of preserving one’s beginning lies in fearlessness—one brave warrior can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and can restrain themselves are yet like this; how much more one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, treats the six senses as a temporary abode, models the ears and eyes, unifies the knowledge of knowledge, and whose heart has never died! He will choose a day to ascend on high, and people will follow him. How would he deign to make things his concern?”\n\nThe stillness of water that enables reflection is not stillness sought for reflection. Thus, when King Tai gathered the multitude, the multitude came to him of their own accord—how could he draw things to follow him? If he acted to make it so, he could not abide in the stillness of the myriad things. The pine and cypress uniquely receive the concentrated qi of nature, thus they stand as the finest of trees—not through effort but by attainment. Those who uniquely receive the upright qi of nature are exceedingly rare: below, only the pine and cypress; above, only the sages. Thus, all that are not upright come seeking rectification. If all things possessed perfect verdancy, the pine and cypress would not be prized; if each person were self-upright, none would admire the great sage and hasten to him. Fortunate to be upright oneself, one does not rectify in order to rectify others. Not striving to renounce fame yet leaving nothing unborne, darkly embodying all—this is what is called a temporary abode.\n\nPeople use their ears and eyes, yet they are not their ears and eyes. When knowledge moves with transformation, there is nowhere it does not darkly pervade—this is the oneness of knowledge. When the heart flows with life and death, there is no time it is not alive—this is the heart that has never died. To choose is to fail to meet; this person makes no choice, following heaven’s course and moving with the times. Thus, those who borrow and lend are surpassed by him. His tranquility preserves his wholeness.\n\nShentu Jia, a man without feet, studied with Zheng Zichan under Bohun Wuren. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, “If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay.” The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, “If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay. Now I am about to leave—can you stay? Or not? Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not yield. Do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?” Ashamed to walk alongside one without feet, he pressed the question, wishing to ensure they would not leave together. Always valuing his own position, he directly said, “You consider yourself equal to the one in power,” implying his lack of deference.\n\nShentu Jia said, “In the Master’s gate, are there truly those in power like this? You delight in your position and belittle others. I have heard: ‘When a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if it settles, it is not bright. Long dwelling with the worthy leaves no faults.’ Now, what you take as greatest is the Master, yet you still speak thus—is this not a fault?” This speaks of virtue’s place, not rank. He mocked his pride in position, wishing to precede others. To serve a clear teacher yet retain a stingy heart is truly a fault.\n\nZichan said, “You are already like this, yet still vie with Yao in goodness. Measuring your virtue, is it not enough to reflect on yourself?” As one with a maimed form, he spoke without self-examination, wishing to slight those in power and stand with the virtuous. Measuring his virtue, it was insufficient to compensate for his maimed form’s transgression.\n\nShentu Jia said, “Those who describe their faults, claiming they should not have lost what they lost, are many; those who do not describe their faults, claiming they should not have kept what they kept, are few. Knowing there is nothing to be done and accepting it as fate—only those with virtue can do this. Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow: the center is the target, yet missing it is fate. Many have laughed at my incomplete feet, and I bristled with anger. But when I came to the Master’s place, I returned in calm. Did the Master wash me with goodness, or did I awaken myself? I have wandered with you for nineteen years and never known I was without feet. Now you wander with me within the form, yet seek me outside the form—is this not a fault?” He often recounted his faults, claiming many believed he should not have lost what he lost.\n\nYi was an archer of old renowned for his skill. The range of his bow and arrows was called the \"drawn bow.\" Where profit and harm contend, the world is all Yi. Those who do not abandon themselves, forget knowledge, and flow with things—all wander within Yi’s drawn bow. Even if one ventures forth like Zhang Yi or dwells in seclusion like Shan Bao, they cannot escape the target’s center. Whether one hits or misses it rests solely with fate. Yet the petty-minded each encounter their own lot and do not realize that fate is thus of itself. Those who escape harm from bow and arrow deem themselves clever, rejoicing in their superiority. But when they cannot escape, they resent their error, their wills wounded and spirits shamed—these have not yet grasped the nature of fate.\n\nOur lives are not of our own making. Within a single lifetime, a hundred years, all our sitting and rising, moving and resting, inclinations and aversions, emotions, nature, knowledge, and abilities—all that we possess, all that we lack, all that we do, all that we encounter—are not of ourselves. The principle is thus of itself. To arbitrarily generate joy and sorrow within it is to go against nature and lose the Way. All this stems from not knowing fate and thus indulging in such laughter.\n\nSeeing the perfected one’s knowledge of fate and abandonment of form, he cast aside his former anger and returned to equilibrium. Did the Master wash me with the goodness of the Dao, or was I able to turn back myself? This was to forget the form and leave burdens behind—forgetting the form indeed. The form lies without, while virtue resides within. Now you wander with me in virtue, not in bodily exchange, yet you seek my external adornments—is this not a fault?\n\nZi Chan, startled, altered his expression and said, “Say no more!” Having awakened, he found the words excessive.\n\nThe heel is the cheek. In Lu there was a toe-less man, Shushan Wuzhi, who came to see Confucius on his heels. Confucius said, “You were not careful, and previously suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?”\n\nMan’s life arises of itself from principle. Simply do nothing and let it arise naturally—this is to value the body and know one’s duty. If one forgets this natural arising, and instead is cautious and self-important, one lightly uses the body without knowing one’s duty. Thus the five organs attack one another within, and hands and feet are maimed without.\n\nWuzhi said, “I only failed to know my duty and lightly used my body, which is why I lost my foot. Now I come, and what remains is still worthy of respect—I thus strive to preserve it whole. Heaven covers all without exception, Earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like Heaven and Earth—how could I have known you would still be like this?”\n\nTo cast aside self-importance and caution, and let life arise naturally—this is to strive for wholeness. To reproach one for lack of care is to fall short of Heaven and Earth.\n\nConfucius said, “I am indeed crude! Sir, why not come in? Please share what you have heard.”\n\nHearing what was to be heard, he departed, preserving his non-action. Wuzhi left.\n\nConfucius said, “Disciples, take heed! Though Wuzhi is maimed, he still strives to study and redress the faults of his past conduct—how much more should one of whole virtue do so!”\n\nOne of whole virtue is born and forgets life. Wuzhi said to Lao Dan, “Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he so assiduously take me as his student? He seeks to be known for marvels, illusions, and strange wonders, unaware that the perfected person regards these as his own fetters.”\n\nHe found it strange that Confucius should again study under Lao Dan. One without preconceptions learns when others learn. Yet the ancients studied for themselves, while those of today study for others—this flaw has led them to act as others act.\n\nOne who teaches others to attain self-realization follows what is constant; one who abandons the self to imitate others and chases externals seeks an extraordinary reputation. Such extraordinary reputation arises from what is constant.\n\nThus, the learner does not pursue illusions and wonders, yet illusions and wonders necessarily arise from learning. Ritual is not for ornate display, yet ornate display necessarily arises from ritual. This is an inevitable principle, something the perfected person cannot help but regard as fetters.\n\nLao Dan said, “Why not simply let him see life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as one continuum, and thus free him from his fetters? Would that be possible?”\n\nHe wished to guide him directly to the obscure truth, hoping he would leave no trace.\n\nWithout Toes said, “Heaven has punished him—how can it be undone!”\n\nNow, Confucius is not without obscurity in his understanding. Yet by the natural principle, where conduct goes, the shadow follows; where words go, echoes attend. One who accords with things establishes a name and trace, though according with things is not for the sake of name. Not acting for name—this is perfection. Yet ultimately one cannot escape name. Who, then, can free himself from it?\n\nThus, name is the shadow and echo; shadow and echo are the fetters of form and sound. When this principle is understood, name and trace may be relinquished. When name and trace are relinquished, attachment to externals may be severed. When attachment to externals is severed, one’s nature and life may be preserved whole.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, “In Wei there was an ugly man named Aitai Tuo. Men who lived with him thought of him and could not leave. Women who saw him pleaded with their parents, saying, ‘Better to be this man’s concubine than another’s wife’—by the tens, without end. He never initiated speech, only harmonized with others. He held no lordly position to save men from death, no store of wealth to fill men’s bellies. Moreover, his ugliness startled all under heaven. He harmonized without initiating, his wisdom did not extend beyond his immediate sphere, yet men and women alike gathered before him. There must have been something extraordinary in him.\n\nI summoned him to observe him, and indeed, his ugliness startled all under heaven. Yet after less than a month in my company, I took notice of his character. Before a year had passed, I trusted him. The state had no chief minister, so I offered him the governance. He responded with reluctance, as if declining. I was ashamed, yet in the end I entrusted him with the state. Before long, he left me and departed.\n\nI grieved as though bereft, as if no one remained to share the joy of ruling this state. What manner of man was he?”\n\nUgliness is but outward deformity. Yet men came to him not by power or influence. They came not seeking sustenance. They came not for his comeliness. He summoned none, yet they gathered. His thoughts did not stray beyond their proper bounds.\n\nThe man of perfect talent harms nothing in the world. Entering the herd, he does not disturb the beasts; entering the flock, he does not scatter the birds. Thus he becomes a refuge for all things. Before a month had passed, his depth was already perceived. Entrusted with the governance of the state, neither favor nor disgrace could unsettle his spirit. When others declined, so too did he.\n\nConfucius said: “I once traveled to Chu and saw young boars nursing from their dead mother. After a moment, they glanced about in alarm and fled. They saw not their own kind, nor found anything familiar. What they loved in their mother was not her form, but that which animated her form. When warriors die in battle, their burials do not include the ceremonial shields of the living. No one cherishes the shoes of the mutilated. In both cases, the root is lost. The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears. Those who take wives remain apart, no longer employed in service. If mere bodily integrity suffices to command such reverence, how much more the man of perfect virtue!\n\nNow, Aitai Tu spoke not, yet was trusted; did nothing, yet was beloved. He was offered a state, yet feared only that he might refuse. Such a man must be one of perfect talent whose virtue remains unmanifest.”\n\nThe living are drawn to those of like talent and virtue. When these depart in death, the living flee, for their kind is lost. Thus, one rich in inner virtue is like a newborn babe: wherever he goes, none harm him, for he is recognized as kin and thus made clear to all. If the heart is of like kind, even dissimilar forms arouse no hostility. But if the heart is not of like kind, even mother and child, though alike in form, cannot secure their bond.\n\nThat which animates form is talent and virtue. The ceremonial shield is the instrument of martial prowess. The fallen warrior has no use for martial prowess—where then would such a shield be placed? We cherish shoes for the sake of the feet. Shields and shoes alike depend on their root. To preserve the body whole is to fear harm to its form.\n\nIn selecting consorts or celebrating new marriage, the mind is set on physical beauty. Thus, bodily integrity alone can soften the passions of the most exalted and turn the resolve of the chastest maiden. How much more, then, should the man of perfect virtue be beloved by all things!\n\nDuke Ai said: “What is meant by *perfect talent*?”\n\nConfucius replied: “Life and death, survival and ruin, success and failure, wealth and poverty, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate before us day and night, yet knowledge cannot trace their beginnings. Thus, they must not be allowed to disturb the harmony within, nor enter the sacred chamber of the mind. Let them bring only ease and openness, never departing from joy. Let day and night be seamless, so that the heart ever abides in springtime, meeting all things with the vitality of the season. This is what is called *perfect talent*.”\n\nThe principle is inherently right—it cannot be escaped. Thus, human life is no mistake; what life possesses is no delusion. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things numerous, what I encounter is precisely this—even the gods of heaven and earth, the sages of the state, exerting utmost strength and wisdom, cannot alter it. Therefore, what one does not encounter cannot be encountered; what one encounters cannot be unencountered. What one does not do cannot be done; what one does cannot be undone. Entrust it to fate, and it naturally fits.\n\nFate moves, affairs change, ceaseless day and night, pressing forward without retreat, lingering without pause. Thus, the man of perfect talent follows what he encounters and entrusts himself to it. Beginnings cannot be traced by knowledge, nor can endings be clung to by emotion. Therefore, those who know that fate must run its course and affairs must change—how could they scheme for endings or cling to beginnings, fixate on the new or yearn for the old? Even with utmost wisdom, they cannot trace it. The past is gone—what can I do about it? If one knows that nature and fate are inherently right, then though life and death, success and failure, undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, one remains serene and at ease, harmony and principle dwelling within.\n\nThe sacred chamber is the dwelling of the spirit. The perfectly content do not let cares and troubles disturb their spirit, passing over them like skin-deep matters. If one keeps harmony unperturbed and the sacred chamber at ease, then though one traverses the greatest changes, one does not lose one’s joy. Calmly entrusting oneself to it, one becomes the reliance of all living things, transforming together with the four seasons.\n\n“What is meant by *virtue not manifesting*?”\n“Stillness is the fullness of water at rest. It can serve as a model: inwardly preserved, outwardly undisturbed. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. *Virtue not manifesting* means things cannot depart from it.”\n\nOf all things in the world, none is more perfectly level than still water. Utterly without bias, it is thus the standard for the world. When affairs are accomplished and things are harmonized, this is called *virtue*. When no affair is unaccomplished and no thing is disharmonious, this is *virtue not manifesting*. Therefore, the world delights in exalting it without tiring.\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Minzi: “At first, I thought that by facing south as ruler of the world, holding the people’s guiding threads and worrying over their deaths, I had attained perfect understanding. Now, hearing the words of the perfected man, I fear I lack their substance, have lightly used my person, and lost my state. I and Kong Qiu are not ruler and minister—we are friends in virtue!”\n\nThose who hear the wind of virtue’s fullness, even Duke Ai, wish to cast off their bodily forms and forget nobility and baseness.\n\nYin Qi, the hunchbacked, lipless man, persuaded Duke Ling of Wei, who was so pleased that he compared whole-bodied men and found their necks too slender. The man with the great goiter persuaded Duke Huan of Qi, who was so pleased that he compared whole-bodied men and found their necks too slender. Thus, virtue has its excellences, and form has its forgettings. People forget what should be forgotten yet forget what should not be forgotten—this is called *true forgetting*.\n\nPartial feelings lead one way, and the ugly become more lovely while the lovely become more ugly. If one’s virtue excels in following things, things forget their ugliness; if it excels in opposing things, things forget their loveliness. In life, they are loved; in death, they are discarded. Thus, virtue is what the world does not forget; form is what principle does not retain. Therefore, those who forget form do not truly forget; those who forget virtue while clinging to form—*they* are the ones who truly forget.\n\nThus, the sage wanders freely, yet knowledge becomes a snare, covenants become glue, virtue becomes a bond, skill becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme—why use knowledge? Does not carve—why use glue? Has no loss—why use virtue? Does not trade—why use commerce? These four are the heavenly nourishment. *Heavenly nourishment* is the food of heaven. Having received sustenance from heaven, why use man?\n\nPossessing the form of a human but lacking human emotions, one has the form of a human and thus mingles with people; lacking human emotions, right and wrong do not adhere to one’s person. How small and insignificant—this is how one belongs to people! How vast and towering—this is how one completes one’s heaven. Roaming in the realm of self-attainment, released and reaching everywhere—this is the fullness of talent and virtue. These four arise naturally from one another; their principle is already complete. Since it is naturally complete, the sage has no use for his own contrivance. Words arise from nature and are endowed by it. Once endowed by nature, the principle is already sufficient. Thus, though one may ponder deeply to avoid calamity or clearly admonish to evade misfortune, nothing happens by delusion—all are the convergence of heaven and earth, the direction of the highest principle. What must be pondered is not my pondering; what must not be pondered is not my not pondering. Some ponder and avoid it; some ponder and do not avoid it; some do not ponder and avoid it; some do not ponder and do not avoid it. None of these are of me—what is there to do? Entrust it, and it comes of itself.\n\nTheir appearance is like that of a human. Like gathers with like, kind separates from kind—this is the Dao of nature. Without emotion, one entrusts oneself to things. Their appearance is like that of a human; without emotion, one is vast and unburdened by anything. Unburdened by anything is what those with emotions cannot attain—thus, without emotion, one alone completes heaven.\n\nThus, virtue has its excellences, and form has its forgettings. People forget what should be forgotten yet forget what should not be forgotten—this is called *true forgetting*.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi: “Do humans truly have no emotions?”\nZhuangzi said: “Yes.”\nHuizi said: “If humans have no emotions, how can they be called human?”\nZhuangzi said: “The Dao gives them appearance, heaven gives them form—how can they not be called human?”\n\nHuman life is not born of emotion.\n\nWhat life knows is not what emotion knows. Thus, those with emotion strive for detachment yet cannot attain it—yet detachment is achieved through being without emotion; those with emotion strive for sagehood yet cannot attain it—yet sagehood is achieved through being without emotion. Is it merely that sagehood is distant and detachment hard to long for? Even the dullest, the deaf, the blind, the crowing of roosters, the barking of dogs—though they have no emotion in doing so, they too ultimately cannot achieve it. Whether far or near, even if separated by but a hair’s breadth, in the space between brow and eye, it remains forever unattainable. Thus, when the myriad things are shut away, one turns to take from oneself: ears and eyes cannot exchange their tasks to succeed, hands and feet cannot substitute for one another to accomplish work.\n\nWhen an infant first comes into the world, it does not seek milk with its eyes, does not turn its ears toward light, does not grasp objects with its feet, does not crawl with its hands. How could the hundred limbs lack fixed offices, the bodily form lack an original master, and be governed solely by emotion?\n\nHuizi said: “If one is called human, how can one be without emotion?”\nHe had not yet understood that bodily form is not emotion.\n\nZhuangzi said: “This is not what I mean by emotion. What I mean by being without emotion is that one does not internally harm one’s body with likes and dislikes, but constantly follows nature without adding to life.”\n\nIf one takes right and wrong as emotion, then one without right or wrong, without likes or dislikes—though possessing bodily form—is merely human in name; where would emotion reside? Acting appropriately and proceeding directly is not emotion. It ceases where appropriateness ceases.\n\nHuizi said: “If one does not augment life, how can one possess a body?”\nHe had not yet understood that life generates itself, and principle suffices of itself.\n\nZhuangzi said: “The Dao bestows its form, Heaven bestows its shape—do not internally harm your body with likes and dislikes. Now you estrange your spirit, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree chanting, or recline on a withered catalpa to sleep. Heaven has selected this form, yet you clamor about ‘hard and white.’”\n\nThe principle of life is already self-sufficient within bodily form; simply follow it, and the body endures. The emotions of likes and dislikes do not augment life but only harm the body, for life has its allotted portion. If the spirit does not rest within the bounds of its nature, it becomes estranged; if essence does not abide at the limit of its self-generation, it becomes exhausted. Thus, when walking, one leans against a tree chanting; when sitting, one reclines on a catalpa to sleep—this is the self-entrapment of those with emotion. All you do—estranging the spirit, exhausting essence, leaning against trees, reclining on catalpas, chanting and sleeping—this is what the world calls emotion. Yet you speak of ‘Heaven’s selection,’ making clear that what arises from emotion (or: what is called emotion) is not born of emotion—how much less anything else! Thus, though the myriad things and myriad forms, their goings and comings, all emerge from the realm of no-emotion, what use is emotion between them?\n\n* * *\n\nIn *The Great and Venerable Master* from the *Inner Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi*:\n\nTo know what Heaven does and what man does—this is perfection!\nTo know what Heaven does is to be born of Heaven; to know what man does is to nourish with what one’s knowledge knows what one’s knowledge does not know, and so complete one’s Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the fullness of knowledge.\n\nThough heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things abundant, what they honor as master is the mindless. To know what Heaven and man do is to know that all is natural. Then one inwardly releases the body and outwardly darkens to things, merging with the multitude of mysteries, following them so that nothing is not attained.\n\n“Heaven” means “the natural.” What acts through acting cannot act, but acts through self-acting; what knows through knowing cannot know, but knows through self-knowing. Self-knowing is not knowing; not knowing, then knowledge arises from not-knowing. Self-acting is not acting; not acting, then action arises from non-action. Action arises from non-action, so non-action is the master; knowledge arises from not-knowing, so not-knowing is the origin. Thus the true person abandons knowledge yet knows, does not act yet acts, is born of the natural, attains through sitting in forgetfulness—hence knowledge is called “cut off” and action “gone.”\n\nMan’s life, though the body is but seven feet, must possess the Five Constants. Thus, though the body is small, it upholds heaven and earth to serve it. Therefore, heaven and earth and the myriad things—all that exists—cannot be without one another for a single day. If one thing is lacking, the living have no means to live; if one principle is absent, the Heaven-appointed years have no way to be completed. Yet what the body possesses, one may or may not know; where principle resides, one may or may not act. Thus, what knowledge knows is little, while what the body possesses is much; what action does is small, while where principle resides is vast. Those above cannot measure it to seek its completeness.\n\nWhat people know need not be the same, nor what they do dare differ. To differ is to become false; once falsehood is complete, the true is never preserved. Some love knowledge and tirelessly exhaust their hundred limbs, yet what they love is but a branch while the root is ruined—this is using what one knows to harm what one does not know.\n\nAs for the fullness of knowledge: one knows that what man does has its portion, so one follows without forcing; one knows that what man knows has its limit, so one employs without excess. Thus, not using boundless knowledge to entrap oneself, within the single body, knowledge and non-knowledge darkly meet and are both preserved—this is using what one knows to nourish what one does not know.\n\nYet there is a danger: knowledge must await something to be fitting, but what it awaits is inherently uncertain. How do we know that what I call Heaven is not man, or what I call man is not Heaven? Even with full knowledge, it is not as good as abandoning knowledge and following Heaven without danger. Knowledge cannot be without approval or disapproval, so it must await something. But one who follows Heaven in life meets things and is fitting. To await is to lack certainty.\n\nMy life has its limit—this is Heaven; the heart desires to augment it—this is man. Yet this is only what man calls it; in things, there is nothing that is not (Heaven). “Heaven” means “the natural.” If all people are natural, then order and chaos, success and failure, encounter and non-encounter are not man-made but all natural.\n\nOnly with the true person is there true knowledge. What is the true person? The true persons of old did not oppose the few, did not boast of success, did not scheme. Such as these, when they erred, did not regret; when they were fitting, did not feel self-satisfied. Such as these, when climbing high, did not tremble; when entering water, did not get wet; when entering fire, did not feel heat—this is the knowledge that can ascend to the Dao in this way.\n\nOnly with the true person do all the world’s knowledges attain their truth and cannot be confused. Not opposing the few means one’s wishes are many; not relying on success and taking the lead among things, the heart roams freely and the multitude of scholars naturally gathers—this is not achieved through scheming. Simply preserving wholeness and fittingness without error, not weighing gain and loss in the mind. To say that knowledge ascends to the Dao is to speak of such distance.\n\nPrinciple is inherently whole—this is not fear of death. Thus, when the true person walks on land, it is not to avoid getting wet; when far from fire, it is not to escape heat; without error, it is not to contrive fittingness.\n\nThus, though they do not regard heat as heat, they never rush into fire; though they do not regard wetness as wetness, they never tread into water; though they do not regard death as death, they never forfeit life. Therefore, is life truly produced by life? Is completion truly achieved by completion? One who entrusts all to the Way and leaves nothing unattained—this is the true person. How could they impose fixed intentions upon what they encounter?\n\nThe true person of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the breath of ordinary people reaches only the throat. Those who are cramped and submissive speak as if choking. The deeper one’s cravings, the shallower one’s heavenly mechanism. They harbor no deliberate thoughts, resting content in whatever they encounter. Eating is simply a matter of principle—it arises from the root. When qi is not balanced and flowing, one must deeply root and settle to the utmost, only then returning to unity and desirelessness.\n\nThe true person of old did not delight in life nor detest death. They did not rejoice at departure nor resist return. They came and went with effortless ease, neither clinging to their origin nor seeking their end. They accepted and rejoiced in what came, forgot and returned to it—this is called not using the heart to harm the Dao, not using human effort to assist heaven. This is the true person, one whose body is the transformation itself. Serene and yielding, they entrust all to the supreme principle, thus coming and going without difficulty. They forget all transformations of beginning and end—how could they merely forget life while still probing the meaning of death? They do not question what they receive, meeting all with perfect accord. Their return is not guided by knowledge—it is the utmost attainment.\n\nAt birth, humans are still—this is heaven’s nature. Moved by things, they stir—this is nature’s desire. When the things that move people are endless and human desires know no bounds, heavenly principle is extinguished. The true person knows that using the heart turns one from the Dao, and assisting heaven harms life, so they do not act thus. In such a state, their heart is forgotten, their countenance still, their brow serene. They are chill as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger flowing with the four seasons, harmonizing with things yet leaving no trace of their depth. Where they dwell, they find contentment in their will. Though they act, they do not disrupt their stillness.\n\nThe character *kuí* (頯) describes the appearance of great simplicity. The killing of things is not for the sake of authority. Those who embody the Dao and harmonize with change share the warmth and severity of cold and heat, yet never do so with intent. Nevertheless, they possess the demeanor of warmth and severity, the rhythm of life and death—thus, their likeness is lent to joy and anger. Without intent toward things, they do not violate what is fitting for them; with nothing unfitting, none can fathom their depth.\n\nTherefore, when the sage employs military force, he may overthrow a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. His beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet he does not act out of love for others. Thus, one who delights in connecting with things is no sage; one who has partiality is not benevolent; one who follows the seasons is not worthy; one who does not penetrate benefit and harm is no gentleman; one who pursues fame at the cost of self is no scholar; one who sacrifices himself without authenticity does not truly serve others.\n\nThose like Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these are servants of others’ service, followers of others’ paths, yet never do they follow their own. They cause the downfall of what people’s hearts already desire to destroy, and thus do not lose the people’s hearts. The bright sun ascends the heavens, illuminating the six directions—not out of love for others that it shines.\n\nThus, when the sage dwells in the world, he is warm like the spring sun’s natural harmony, so those who receive his grace do not feel gratitude. He is chill like the autumn frost’s natural descent, so those who wither do not bear resentment. The sage has no joy—it is simply that nothing obstructs him, and things flow of themselves. Perfect benevolence has no partiality, entrusting principle to preserve itself. One who adheres to the seasons does not compare to one who forgets time and naturally aligns with it. Unable to unify the paths of right and wrong and pursue benefit while avoiding harm, one injures virtue and burdens what is fitting.\n\nA true scholar abandons fame and finds contentment in himself, so his name matches his reality, and fortune responds to his person. One who loses his nature and forces himself to follow things is enslaved by much—how can he enslave others? These all abandon the self to imitate others, sacrificing themselves for external ends.\n\nThe true person of old bore righteousness yet did not form cliques; appeared insufficient yet did not submit. He was angular yet not rigid, expansive yet not florid. His countenance seemed joyful, his actions seemed compelled. His demeanor invited approach, his virtue restrained me. He seemed worldly yet untamable, appeared fond of seclusion yet was not forgetful of speech.\n\nTaking punishment as his body, ritual as his wings, knowledge as his timing, and virtue as his guide: taking punishment as his body, he was lenient in execution; taking ritual as his wings, he moved through the world; taking knowledge as his timing, he acted only when necessary; taking virtue as his guide, he spoke of reaching the heights with those who have feet, yet others truly believed him to be diligent in conduct.\n\nThus, his liking was singular, and his disliking was singular. His singularity was singular, and his non-singularity was singular. In his singularity, he was a companion of heaven; in his non-singularity, a companion of man. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the true person. He harmonized with things without forming factions. Empty and without excess, he seemed insufficient yet did not submit. Lowering himself, he was never not exalted. He wandered alone yet did not cling stubbornly. Vast and without attachment, he attained true substance.\n\nThe perfected person has no joy, yet is harmonious and at ease—thus he seems joyful. In movement and stillness, action and rest, he always dwells in the ultimate of necessity. He does not allow things to harm himself. He has no direction to pursue. The perfected person is not harsh, yet moves with the world—thus he seems harsh. Lofty and self-content, his depth is boundless, and none see his gate. Unknowing and unperceiving, his heavenly mechanism operates of itself—thus he seems forgetful.\n\nRitual is how the world conducts itself—it is not of his making. Knowledge responds to the times—it is not his initiative. Virtue is what others follow—it is not his creation. Entrusting governance to its natural course, though it may kill, it is lenient. Following what the world practices, nothing is left undone.\n\nThe mutual reception of high and low is an irreversible flow; the grouping of small and great is an inevitable tendency. Vast and without emotion, he is the repository of all knowledge. Receiving the convergence of a hundred streams, dwelling at the pinnacle of human guidance—what does he do? He entrusts the world’s knowledge to the times, commits to what is necessary, and leaves it to the world.\n\nThe heights are the root. Speaking in terms of nature, it is the root of nature. Things each have what suffices, and what suffices is the root. Entrusting the self-following of all virtues, he thus reaches the root with those who have feet. When the root is reached, principle is exhausted.\n\nAll this is accomplished by others—its completion does not lie with him. Thus, though he dwells at the pinnacle of ten thousand affairs, he is always at leisure and at ease, suddenly unaware of affairs passing through him, forgetful of words in his mouth. Yet people’s great delusion is to truly believe the perfected person is diligent in conduct.\n\nAlways without intent, he follows others—thus his likes and dislikes, his approvals and disapprovals, are no different from theirs. His singularity is the companion of heaven; his non-singularity, the companion of man. The true person unites heaven and man, equalizes self and other, not allowing his singularity to differ from his non-singularity.\n\nTo be without and yet not singular is heaven. The true person unites heaven and man, equalizes the myriad outcomes. The myriad outcomes do not oppose one another; heaven and man do not overcome one another. Thus, he is vast and without non-singularity, obscure and without non-presence, darkly merging with others.\n\nLife and death are fate; their alternation like night and day is heaven. What humans cannot partake in are all the conditions of things. He regards heaven as his father and loves it as his own body—how much more that which transcends it!\n\nMen deem having a lord superior to themselves, yet still give their lives for him—how much more should they do so for the true! The alternation of day and night is the constant Way of heaven. Thus, to know that life and death are the ultimate of fate, not mere happenstance—like night and day—what is there to cling to? The true person in daylight attains daylight, in night attains night. Taking life and death as day and night, is there anything he does not attain? That men harbor sorrow or joy over what they cannot control is but the sentiment of things, not principle.\n\nThe transcendent is called \"solitary transformation.\" The efficacy of mutual dependence is not as great as the perfection of solitary transformation. What men depend upon is heaven; what heaven engenders is solitary transformation. All men take heaven as their father, thus the changes of day and night, the cycles of cold and heat—they dare not resent them, but follow heaven and find peace in it. How much more should they submit to solitary transformation, reaching the realm of profound obscurity! How could they not yield to it? Once they yield, life and death, transformation—all follow fate.\n\nThe true is not borrowed from things but is natural. The natural cannot be avoided—how could this apply only to a lord’s command! When a spring dries, fish find themselves on land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praise Yao and blame Jie, better to forget both and merge with the Dao. Rather than love one another in scarcity, better to forget one another in abundance! Praise and blame both arise from insufficiency.\n\nThus, the perfectly sufficient forgets good and evil, leaves behind life and death, and unites with transformation, vast and unbounded. Hiding a boat in a ravine, concealing a mountain in a marsh—one calls this secure! Yet in the dead of night, a strong man carries it away, and the deluded do not know. Hiding the small and large has its proper place, yet there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to leave no room for escape—this is the great truth of all things. Men rejoice merely in possessing a human form. Yet the human form is but one of ten thousand transformations, never reaching an end—how could its joy be measured?\n\nThus, the sage roams where things cannot escape and all are preserved. Excelling in early death, excelling in old age, excelling in beginning, excelling in end—men still emulate him, how much more the ten thousand things that depend on it, and the one transformation they await! Form, birth, aging, death—all are myself. Thus, form carries me, birth labors me, aging rests me, death gives me repose. Though these four change, they have never ceased to be me—why should I regret them? Death and life are both fate. Without goodness, there is death; with goodness, there is life—not goodness alone. If one takes my life as good, then my death is also good.\n\nHaving spoken of the inescapability of life, death, and transformation, one first presents the ultimate of inescapability, then clarifies it with the sign of inevitable change, to yield to transformation without attachment. The power of powerlessness is greatest in transformation; thus, it lifts heaven and earth to pursue the new, shoulders mountains and ridges to discard the old. Without the slightest pause, in an instant it has traversed the new—thus, heaven and earth and the ten thousand things never cease to shift. The world is ever new, yet men take it as old; boats daily change, yet they see them as before; mountains daily alter, yet they see them as the same. Now, in the time it takes to cross an arm, all has departed into obscurity. Thus, the \"I\" of a moment ago is no longer the \"I\" of now. I and the present both pass away—how could one cling to the past? Yet the world does not perceive this, stubbornly believing what it encounters can be grasped and held—how deluded!\n\nHaving nothing to hide and yielding entirely, one merges with things without obstruction, unites with transformation without division. Thus, there is no outside, no inside, no death, no life—embodying heaven and earth and uniting with transformation, seeking escape yet finding none. This is the great truth of constant existence, not the petty intent of a single corner. The human form is but one encounter among ten thousand transformations—hardly worth special delight. Within the boundless, all encounters are like the human form—how could only the human form bring joy while other things have none!\n\n◎ Qingfan’s note: *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Jia Yi’s \"Fu on the Owl\" cites Sima [Biao] as saying: \"It will again transform into nothingness.\" The *Shiwen* is incomplete.\n\nOriginally not human, it transformed into human—having transformed into human, it lost its former state. Losing its former state and rejoicing is rejoicing in what it encounters. Transformation is endless—what is there it does not encounter? Rejoicing in what it encounters, how could its joy have an end! The sage wanders the paths of transformation, drifts upon the stream of daily renewal. The ten thousand things and ten thousand transformations transform with him; transformation is boundless, and he is boundless with it—who can escape it? In life, it is gone; in death, it remains—when is it not present? This is to equalize within a hundred years, not to favor youth and resent age, yet still unable to embody transformation and equalize life and death. Nevertheless, its purity is sufficient to serve as a teacher for others.\n\nThis is to merge with the ten thousand things in profound unity and embody transformation—thus, it is fitting that the world takes it as its model. The Dao has essence and trustworthiness, is without action and without form; it can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted, existing before heaven and earth, enduring since ancient times. It spiritually animates ghosts and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. It is before the Great Ultimate yet not high, beneath the Six Poles yet not deep, born before heaven and earth yet not long-lasting, older than antiquity yet not aged.\n\nXiwei attained it and thereby harnessed heaven and earth; Fuxi attained it and thereby penetrated the Mother of Qi; the Northern Dipper attained it and never erred through all ages; the sun and moon attained it and never ceased through all ages; Kanpi attained it and thereby penetrated Kunlun; Feng Yi attained it and thereby roamed the great rivers; Jianwu attained it and thereby dwelled on the great mountains; the Yellow Emperor attained it and thereby ascended the cloudy heavens; Zhuanxu attained it and thereby dwelled in the Dark Palace; Yuqiang attained it and stood at the North Pole; the Queen Mother of the West attained it and sat in Shaoguang—none knew its beginning, none knew its end. Pengzu attained it and lived from the time of Youyu to the Five Hegemons; Fu Yue attained it and served as minister to Wu Ding, ruling the world, riding the Eastern Ridge and straddling the Tail of the Winnowing Basket to join the ranks of the stars.\n\nThere exists a passion without passion, thus it is non-action; there exists a constancy without constancy, thus it is formless. From antiquity to the present, it has been transmitted and dwelled in, yet none can receive and possess it. All things find their own accommodation within it, yet none perceive its form. Illumination requires nothing of being to be non-being. Non-being—how could it give birth to the numinous? Not being numinous, ghosts and emperors become numinous of themselves—this is the numinosity of non-numinosity. Not giving birth, heaven and earth are born of themselves—this is the birth of non-birth.\n\nThus, the numinosity of the numinous is insufficient to be numinous, while non-numinosity is truly numinous. What achievement is there to claim? What affair is there to rely upon? The Way’s ubiquity means that where it is high, there is no height; where it is deep, there is no depth; where it is enduring, there is no duration; where it is old, there is no age. It is everywhere, yet wherever it is, it is nothing.\n\nMoreover, above and below, nothing fails to reach it—one cannot speak of it in terms of high or low. Within and without, nothing fails to attain it—one cannot name it in terms of inner or outer. Moving in unison with transformation, one cannot speak of it as enduring. Ever without beginning or end, one cannot call it old.\n\nThe Way is incapable. This speaks of attaining it through the Way, yet only clarifies that it is self-attained. Self-attained—yet the Way cannot cause one to attain it; nor, when I have not attained it, can I bring about attainment. Thus, all who attain it neither rely on the Way externally nor depend on themselves internally, but suddenly attain it of themselves and transform alone.\n\nThe difficulty of life is like this self-transformation and self-attainment. Once life is attained, why fear its loss and strive for it? Thus, striving for life is insufficient to preserve life, for life does not arise from oneself—striving for it only harms one’s true life.\n\nNanbo Zikui asked Nü Yu, “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child. Why is this?” Nü Yu replied, “I have heard the Way.”\n\nHaving heard the Way, one allows life to arise of itself—thus one’s qi and complexion remain whole.”\n\nNanbo Zikui said, “Can the Way be learned?”\n“No! How could it be? You are not the right person. Now, Pulam Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Way of a sage, while I possess the Way of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping that he might indeed become a sage. If not, to impart the Way of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. Yet I persisted in teaching him, and after three days he was able to let go of the world. Having let go of the world, I again persisted, and after seven days he was able to let go of things. Having let go of things, I persisted once more, and after nine days he was able to let go of life. Having let go of life, he could then attain clarity at dawn. With clarity at dawn, he could then perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, he could then transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, he could then enter into that which is neither dead nor alive. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life to life does not live. As a thing, it sends nothing forth without escort, meets nothing without welcome, destroys nothing without ruin, and completes nothing without fulfillment. Its name is *yingning*—tranquility through engagement. *Yingning* is that which is completed only after engagement.”\n\n*Wai* means “to let go.” Things are what one requires morning and night, what is intimately tied to the self and hard to forget. To let go of them entirely—this is *du yi*. To let go of life is to cease hating death; ceasing to hate death, one is at peace with whatever one encounters, suddenly unobstructed, acting in accord with the moment—this is clarity at dawn. One moves in unison with the solitary. Clinging to life gives rise to death; hating death gives rise to life. Thus, without clinging and without hatred, one can transcend death and life. Allowing things to escort themselves, nothing is not escorted. Allowing things to welcome themselves, nothing is not welcomed. Allowing things to destroy themselves, nothing is not destroyed. Allowing things to complete themselves, nothing is not completed. One who merges with things—though things entangle, they entangle yet remain ever tranquil.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, “From whom did you alone hear this?”\nHe replied, “I heard it from the disciple of *Fumo*, the disciple of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*, the grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*, *Zhanming* heard it from *Niexu*, *Niexu* heard it from *Xuyi*, *Xuyi* heard it from *Yu’ou*, *Yu’ou* heard it from *Xuanming*, *Xuanming* heard it from *Canliao*, and *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*.”\n\nIf things entangle yet one alone remains unentangled, one is ruined.\n\nThus, entangled yet allowing it, there is nothing that does not bend to completion. *Xuanming* is so named because it is \"non-being yet not nothingness.\" One who ascends through names to reach non-being must attain non-being beyond the realm of names. Therefore, though *Xuanming* is profound, it has not yet reached the ultimate, and so it is further entrusted to *Canliao*—this is the profound within the profound.\n\nThe principle of spontaneity is one that is cultivated through accumulated practice. Indeed, one ascends from the near to the distant, refines from the coarse to the subtle, and thus only after seven layers does one reach the name of non-being, and after nine layers does one doubt that non-being is the beginning.\n\nZisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai said to one another, “Who can take non-being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone? Who knows that death and life, existence and nonexistence, are of one body—we shall befriend him!” The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.\n\nSoon after, Ziyu fell ill, and Zisi went to visit him. He said, “How wondrous! The Creator would make me like this, all crooked and bent.”\n\nHis back was hunched, his spine protruded, his five organs pressed upward, his chin tucked into his navel, his shoulders towered above his crown, and the growth on his neck pointed to the sky. The qi of yin and yang was in disarray, yet his heart remained at ease, untroubled. He hobbled to the well, peered into its depths, and said, “Alas! The Creator would again make me like this, all crooked and bent.”\n\nHe did not take it as an affliction. For one who follows the transformations of nature, there is no lament—only the world laments on his behalf.\n\nZisi said, “Do you resent it?”\n\nHe replied, “No, why should I resent it? If gradually my left arm were transformed into a rooster, I would use it to herald the dawn. If gradually my right arm were transformed into a crossbow, I would use it to hunt an owl for roasting. If gradually my tailbone were transformed into a wheel, and my spirit into a horse, I would ride it—why would I need another steed?\n\nMoreover, to gain is a matter of timing; to lose is a matter of compliance. At peace with the time and in accord with compliance, sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients called ‘suspended release,’ yet one who cannot release himself is bound by things. Furthermore, things have long been unable to overcome Heaven—why should I resent it?”\n\n\"Jìn\" means gradual. When the body undergoes transformation and harmonizes with change, there is nowhere it does not adapt, and no adaptation that is impossible. What one encounters in the moment is called by the world ‘gain.’ Since time does not pause for even an instant, to comply and move on is called by the world ‘loss.’ If one cannot release oneself, then the myriad things bind one together.\n\nThus, one who can release is released from all things, while one who cannot release is released from nothing. Heaven cannot be without day and night—how can I be without life and death and resent it?\n\nSoon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zili went to see him and said, \"Shoo! Away! Do not be startled by transformation!\" Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to him: \"How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a mouse’s liver? Or an insect’s limb?\"\n\nLife and death are but waking and sleeping. By principle, one ought to sleep—one does not wish to be startled awake. To transform and die is fitting; there is no need to be alarmed by it.\n\nZilai said, \"For a child, parents may command east or west, north or south, and one must obey. Yin and yang are no less commanding than parents. If they approach my death and I do not heed them, I would be defiant—what fault would lie with them? The great earth bears me with form, labors me with life, eases me with age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.\n\nNow, when the great smith casts metal, if the metal leaps up and says, ‘I must become a *Mo Ye* sword!’ the smith will surely deem it an inauspicious metal. Now, if one acquires a human form and says, ‘I am human! I am human!’ the Creator will surely deem it an inauspicious person. If one takes heaven and earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smith, where could one go and not be acceptable?\"\n\nHe then fell into a deep sleep and awoke with a start.\n\nSince ancient times, some have been able to defy their parents’ commands, but none have been able to defy the changes of yin and yang or resist the cycle of day and night. Life and death are but day and night—nothing distant. When the time comes to die, it is not something to forbid. To stubbornly harbor resistance is to defy principle and hasten one’s death. The swiftness of death arises from one’s own defiance, not from death itself.\n\n*Bi* refers to death; while alive, one regards death as *bi*. Principle is always present. \"I am human! I am human!\"—this is merely the wish to remain human, just as metal leaping up is known to be inauspicious, yet one cannot allow it to transform of its own accord.\n\nThe Dao of transformation encounters nothing it does not meet. Now, to encounter a human form—was this done deliberately? Life is not created deliberately; it arises naturally in time. To strive to possess it is delusion. People know that metal bound by attachment is inauspicious, so when one realizes one’s own nature is no different from metal, the attachments of the heart can be released. Once released, there is nothing that cannot be released.\n\nWaking and sleeping remain as they are, without life and death burdening the heart.\n\nZisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang spoke to one another: \"Who can join together without joining, act for one another without acting? Who can ascend to heaven and wander in the mists, roam without limit, forget life, and have no end?\"\n\nOne who embodies heaven and earth and darkly merges with transformation—though hands and feet have different functions and the five organs distinct offices, they never join together yet all joints harmonize: this is joining without joining. They never act for one another yet inner and outer mutually aid: this is acting without acting. If one instead employs the mind to worry over hands and feet, or moves limbs to manage the five organs, the more one strives, the more inner and outer become exhausted.\n\nThus, one who takes the world as a single body has no partiality in its midst. Entrusting all things without exception, forgetting life, one forgets all—hence one can follow change and adapt to transformation, with nothing left incomplete.\n\nThe three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in accord, and so became friends. Yet was this truly friendship? It was but a lodging of luminous intimacy, free from the nearness of affectionate attachment.\"\n\nAfter a time, Zisang Hu died, his body yet unburied. When Confucius heard of it, he sent Zigong to attend the rites. Some wove funeral songs, others plucked the zither, and together they harmonized in song: *\"Alas, Zisang Hu! Alas, Zisang Hu! You have returned to your true nature, while we remain as men!\"* Zigong hastened forward and said, *\"May I ask—is it proper to sing before the dead?\"*\n\nTo weep when others weep is but a trace of custom. To equalize life and death, to forget sorrow and joy, to sing before the dead—this is the utmost of those beyond the world. The two looked at one another and laughed: *\"How could he know the meaning of ritual!\"*\n\nOne who knows the meaning of ritual must wander beyond to order what is within, guard the mother to preserve the child, and follow the heart’s truth without deviation. If one instead clings to reputation, is bound by form and convention, then filial piety cannot bear sincerity, kindness cannot bear substance, and father and son, brothers, harbor feelings and deceive one another—how could this be the great meaning of ritual?\n\nZigong returned and told Confucius: *\"What manner of men are they? They cultivate no conduct, yet treat the body as external. They sang before the dead without change of countenance—there is no name for them. What manner of men are they?\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"They wander beyond the world, while I, Qiu, wander within it. Beyond and within do not reach one another, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how shallow I was! They are now companions of the Creator, roaming in the single qi of heaven and earth. To them, life is but an excrescent wart, death but the bursting of a sore. How could such as they know where life and death, before and after, reside? Borrowing from strange things, entrusting to a shared body, they forget liver and gall, leave behind ears and eyes. They turn and return, beginning and ending, without knowing head or tail. Vague and drifting beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action—how could they fret over worldly ritual to perform for the eyes and ears of the crowd?\"*\n\nZigong said: *\"Then what Way does the Master follow?\"*\n\nThere is an ultimate principle where beyond and within merge. There has never been one who attains the utmost of wandering beyond yet does not merge within, nor one who merges within yet does not wander beyond. Thus the sage constantly wanders beyond to merge within, is without mind to follow what is, and so though all day long he appears in form, his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Though he bends and rises amid ten thousand affairs, he is serene and at ease. To see form yet not reach spirit—this is the common burden of the world.\n\nThus when one sees him moving with the crowd, none can say he abandons things and leaves men behind; when one sees him embodying transformation and responding to affairs, none can say he sits in forgetfulness and attains self-possession. How could it be only the sage who is not thus? It must be said that the ultimate principle has no such thing.\n\nTherefore, when Zhuangzi sought to clarify the lineage of the great tradition to awaken the world, had he simply praised Confucius in this way, some might have relied on what they saw to reject it. So he transcended the sage’s inner traces and lodged the beyond in those few disciples. One should forget what is lodged to seek the great meaning of his composition, and then the Way of wandering beyond to merge within will be clear and self-evident. Thus Zhuangzi’s book is a discourse that engages the world while transcending it.\n\nCondolences are a near affair of the world within; to apply them to the world beyond is shallow. All is merged, thus there is no duality. Like a wart that hangs of itself, a growth that clings of itself—this is the temporary gathering of qi, not what one delights in. Like an abscess that bursts of itself, a sore that drains of itself—this is the natural dispersal of qi, not what one regrets. Life and death alternate without end; going along with them, there is nowhere one cannot go. Thus one does not know where victory or defeat lies.\n\n*\"Assuming\"* means *\"relying on.\"* Now life and death, gathering and dispersal, change without pattern—all are strange things. There is nothing strange that is not relied upon, so though what is relied upon differs, together they form a single body. Entrusting them to the five organs is still forgetting—what thing is worth recognizing? Without recognition from the start, one can freely follow the path of transformation, darkly merge with the waves of turning and returning, and not know where beginning or end reaches its limit. This is to wander merged in principle.\n\nThe *\"work of non-action\"* is not mere folded-hands silence; *\"beyond the dust and grime\"* is not hiding in mountains and forests. What he shows to the crowd is but their dust and grime—it is not the dark merging of the world beyond. Zigong had not heard of *\"nature and the Way of Heaven,\"* so he saw what he relied upon but not what he relied upon *for.*\n\nWhat one relies upon *for* is no reliance—how could the world be aware of it? Confucius said: *\"Qiu is a man punished by Heaven. Nevertheless, I share this with you.\"*\n\nTo take the mundane world as shackles is to clarify that what is prized lies beyond it. Those who wander beyond depend on what is within; those who depart from humanity conform to custom. Thus, those who possess all under Heaven do not take all under Heaven as their own. Only by relinquishing things can one enter the multitude; only by sitting in forgetfulness can one respond to affairs. The more one relinquishes, the more one gains. Should one abide in this ultimate state, then even if one wished to cast it aside, principle would naturally come of its own—this is what neither Heaven nor man can pardon.\n\nZigong said, \"May I ask the method?\"\n\nThough bound by the world’s shackles, it is but something I share with you. This makes clear that I am ever beyond them.\n\nConfucius said, \"Fish come together in water; men come together in the Dao. Those who come together in water dig ponds to secure their sustenance; those who come together in the Dao find stability without affairs. Thus it is said: Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; men forget one another in the arts of the Dao.\"\n\nAsked about the meaning of wandering beyond while sharing within, Confucius said, \"Fish come together in water; men come together in the Dao. Those who come together in water dig ponds to secure their sustenance; those who come together in the Dao find stability without affairs. Thus it is said: Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; men forget one another in the arts of the Dao.\"\n\nZigong said, \"May I ask about the extraordinary person?\"\n\nThe means of their convergence may differ, yet in attaining affairs through non-affair, in sharing within from beyond form—thus securing sustenance and finding stability—none fail to follow this principle. All remain unaware of it, and so perfect non-action.\n\nIt is said: \"The extraordinary person is extraordinary among men yet equal to Heaven. Thus it is said: The petty man of Heaven is the noble man of men; the noble man of men is the petty man of Heaven.\"\n\nThose who are self-sufficient and forget one another—none under Heaven are otherwise. The perfected person is ever self-sufficient, and thus ever forgetful.\n\nAsked where lies that which was earlier called \"beyond form yet unyoked to custom,\" it is this: One who merges with the inner wanders in the outer. Only by wandering in the outer to merge with the inner, entrusting all things to their natural course, allowing each being’s nature to find its fullness so that the Dao of emperors and kings is realized—this is to be extraordinary among men yet equal to Heaven.\n\nSpoken in terms of nature, there is no small or great among men; spoken in terms of human principle, those equal to Heaven may be called noble men.\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius, saying: \"Mengsun Cai, when his mother died, wept without tears, felt no grief in his heart, and showed no sorrow in mourning. Lacking these three, he yet excelled in mourning throughout the state of Lu. Is it truly possible to gain such a reputation without substance? I find this deeply strange.\"\n\nIn the state of Lu, they observed his rites, while Yan Hui examined his heart. Confucius said: \"Mengsun Cai has fully realized it—he has advanced beyond knowledge. Yet even in seeking simplicity, he finds no attainment, for he has already attained simplicity. Mengsun Cai knows not why he lives, nor why he dies. He knows not what to follow first, nor what to follow after. As if transformed into things, he awaits the transformations he does not know. Moreover, as he is about to transform, how could he know what is not yet transformed? As he is about to remain untransformed, how could he know what has already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have not yet awakened!\n\nFurthermore, he may take on startled forms, yet his heart remains undamaged; he may dwell in a new abode, yet his essence is not depleted. Mengsun Cai alone is awake—when others weep, he weeps too, for that is simply what is fitting for him. And yet, we merely share this understanding in our ears—how could we be certain that what I call ‘I’ is not truly ‘I’? Suppose you dream of being a bird soaring through the heavens, or a fish diving into the depths. How can we know whether the speaker now is awake or dreaming? When one attains perfect ease, laughter does not follow; when laughter is offered, it does not lead to forced cheer. Resting in spontaneity and departing with transformation, one enters the vast oneness of Heaven.\"\n\nOne who fully grasps the principle of life and death, responding fittingly to both inner and outer, moves in accordance with Heaven’s course—this is beyond the reach of mere knowledge. To select and choose between life and death without discerning their difference is like the progression of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Having already simplified and found no distinction, there is nothing not at ease. With nothing not at ease, one does not weigh life and death in the mind but entrusts them to spontaneous transformation. Whatever one encounters, one is at peace. Not resisting transformation, life and death turn and merge with it as one, just as one forgets what one knows in the present—how could one anticipate what is unknown and fret over it in advance? Having transformed and come to life, how could one know the time before birth? Not yet transformed and facing death, how could one know what comes after? Thus, there is nothing to avoid or pursue, and one moves together with transformation.\n\nLife and death are but waking and dreaming. Now, if in a dream one believes oneself awake, there is no way to prove that waking is not also a dream. If one cannot prove that waking is not a dream, then one also cannot prove that life is not death. Whether in life, death, waking, or dreaming, we know not where we stand. Yet in whatever one encounters, there is nothing not self-attained—why grieve over this while worrying about that? Transformation merely startles the form, so one does not allow life and death to burden the heart. The changes of the bodily frame are but daily renewals of one’s dwelling—one’s nature does not take them as death.\n\nThe one who is always awake meets nothing with resistance, so when others weep, he weeps too—this is simply what is fitting for him. Life, death, and transformation—all are mine. Since all are mine, what have I lost? Never having lost myself, what cause have I for sorrow? Without resistance, when others weep, he weeps; without sorrow, though he weeps, he is not grieved. Embracing all as mine, he harmonizes inner and outer, pervades past and present, and daily renews with transformation—how could he know where his true self resides? This means there is nowhere he does not find himself at ease.\n\nWhen dreaming, one believes oneself awake—how then can one know that the present is not a dream? How can one know it is not waking? The transformations of waking and dreaming are boundless, so the changes of life and death are nothing to regret. Wherever one arrives is fitting, so one forgets the fitting—thus laughter does not follow. *Pai* means to shift or move on. In ritual, weeping must be mournful, laughter must be joyful—if sorrow and joy linger in the heart, one cannot move with ease. But Mengsun always abides in ease, so though he weeps, he is not grieved, and moves together with transformation. At peace with shifting and departing with transformation, he enters the silence and becomes one with Heaven.\"\n\nFrom this point up to Zisi, their attainment is the same. The mourning they observe differs, so their songs and weeping are not alike.\n\nYi’erzi visited Xu You, who asked: \"How has Yao aided you?\" *Zi* here means to supply or assist. Yi’erzi replied: \"Yao told me: ‘You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right from wrong.’\" Xu You said: \"Why then have you come here? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you wander the boundless, carefree, and ever-shifting paths?\"\n\n\"Such is how one will maim and cripple oneself with penal teachings, unable to wander again in the fields of self-attainment or the unbound paths. Yi’erzi said: 'Even so, I wish to wander within its fence.' He dared not seek to tread the central Way, but only wished to wander along its border. Xu You said: 'Not so. The blind have no part in the beauty of brows and eyes or the radiance of countenance; the sightless have no part in the splendor of blue and yellow, embroidered and patterned robes.'\n\nYi’erzi said: 'When Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, when Ju Liang lost his strength, when the Yellow Emperor lost his wisdom—all occurred within the forge and hammer’s span. How do we know the Maker of Things will not cease my branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to mount completion and follow you, Master?'\n\nThis speaks of how the things of the world are not all self-complete; the principles of spontaneity also require smelting and forging to become vessels. Thus these three, too, having heard the Dao, afterward forgot their former pursuits. All this is figurative speech, meant to dispel the burdens of clouded action.\n\nOne who follows nature and goes straight forth—this is spontaneity. One who goes forth and harms nature, yet can change when nature is harmed—this, too, is spontaneity. How do we know that my nature is not fated to cease branding and mend mutilation, to mount the Way of completion and follow you? To cast me aside and refuse instruction—this would hardly be the Maker of Things’ perfection.'\n\nXu You said: 'Alas! It cannot be known.'\"\n\n\"Let me speak to you in broad strokes: O my Master! O my Master! You pulverize the myriad things yet claim no righteousness; your beneficence extends to ten thousand generations yet claims no benevolence; you are older than high antiquity yet claim no seniority; you embrace heaven and earth, carving and sculpting all forms, yet claim no artistry. This is the realm in which you wander!\"\n\nAll things are thus of themselves, with no partiality intervening—where then could benevolence and righteousness reside? They renew daily. It is spontaneity, and thus no artifice. To wander in non-action and take as teacher that which has no teacher.\n\nYan Hui said: \"I have advanced.\"\nBy taking reduction as advancement.\n\nZhongni said: \"What do you mean?\"\nHe replied: \"I have forgotten ritual and music.\"\nHe said: \"Good, but not yet sufficient.\"\n\nBenevolence is the trace of universal love; righteousness is the achievement of things. Love is not benevolence, yet the trace of benevolence is enacted; achievement is not righteousness, yet the achievement of righteousness appears. To retain benevolence and righteousness is insufficient to comprehend the origin of love and benefit in non-intention—thus to forget them is permissible. Yet merely forgetting their traces still falls short of profound penetration.\n\nAnother day, he again appeared and said: \"I have advanced.\"\nHe asked: \"What do you mean?\"\nHe replied: \"I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness.\"\nHe said: \"Good, but not yet sufficient.\"\n\nRitual is the function of the physical form; music is the instrument of joy in life. To forget the instrument is not as profound as forgetting that which enables the instrument. Another day, he again appeared and said: \"I have advanced!\" He asked: \"What do you mean?\" He replied: \"I have attained *zuowang* (sitting-forgetting).\" Zhongni started and said: \"What is *zuowang*?\" Yan Hui said: \"To discard the limbs and body, to cast off perception and intelligence, to depart from form and abandon knowledge, and to merge with the Great Thoroughfare—this is called *zuowang*.\" When nothing is not the same, then there is never discomfort; when there is never discomfort, what preferences or aversions could there be? Zhongni said: \"To be the same is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy. And you are indeed worthy! I, Qiu, shall follow after you.\"\n\nOne who is the same as transformation follows only where transformation leads, and thus has no constancy. Ziyu and Zisang were friends. When continuous rain fell for ten days, Ziyu said: \"Zisang must be in dire straits!\" He wrapped up rice and went to feed him. Arriving at Zisang’s gate, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping—plucking the zither and saying: \"Father! Mother! Heaven!\"\n\n\"Alas, man!\"—his voice unable to bear the strain, he hastened to recite his verse.\n\nZiyu entered and asked: \"Why do you sing this poem in such a manner?\"\n\nThese two acted for one another without acting for one another. Now, wrapping rice to feed him was but following Heaven’s principle and happening of itself—it was not that he went because of acting for him. To suspect the presence of emotion is to rush forth and depart far from the principle.\n\nHe said: \"I pondered what brought me to this extremity but found no answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers without partiality, Earth bears without partiality—would Heaven and Earth single me out for poverty? I sought the one who caused this but could not find him! Yet to reach this extremity—such is fate!\" These words declare that all things are natural, with no doer behind them.\n\n---\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters,\" \"Responding as Emperor,\" Chapter Seven of the* Zhuangzi:\n\nNie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Thereupon Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.\n\nMaster Pu Yi said: \"Have you only now come to know this? The Lord of Yu did not match the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu concealed benevolence to entice men—he did gain men, yet never emerged from the realm of the unhuman. The Lord of Tai slept in tranquil ease, awoke in carefree leisure. Now he took himself for a horse, now for an ox. His knowledge was true to his nature, his virtue most genuine, and he never entered the realm of the unhuman.\"\n\nOne who is without intent and follows self-transformation is fit to be emperor. The Lord of Yu and the Lord of Tai were but traces of worldly affairs, not that by which traces are made. That by which traces are made is traceless—who in the world could name it? Never having been named, what victory or defeat could there be? Yet the traceless one rides the myriad changes, treads the ten thousand ages. The world has its level plains and perilous passes, so traces may fall short. Those who take what they love as the \"human\" and what they hate as the \"unhuman\" are merely bounded by the realm of right and wrong. One who can emerge from the realm of the unhuman must enter the realm where nothing is unhuman. Thus there is no gain, no loss, no right, no wrong—how could it be merely concealing benevolence to entice men! Being thus, what \"human\" or \"unhuman\" could there be? This may be called emerging from the realm of the unhuman. Following one’s own knowledge, thus the emotions are true. Following one’s own attainment, thus there is no falsity. Not entering the realm of right and wrong, one cuts off the age of the Lord of Yu.\n\n---\n\nJian Wu met Jie Yu the Madman.\n\nJie Yu asked: \"What did Ri Zhongshi tell you?\"\n\nJian Wu said: \"He told me that a ruler of men, issuing his own standards of laws, models, principles, and measures, who would dare not listen and be transformed?\"\n\nJie Yu said: \"This is deceptive virtue. In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea to dig a river or making a mosquito carry a mountain. Does the sage govern externally? He rectifies himself and then acts, ensuring he is truly capable of his task. Birds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and snares; the field mouse burrows deep beneath the sacred mound to escape the calamity of fumigation and digging—yet are these two creatures lacking in knowledge?\" To impose one’s own designs upon things is to cause things to lose their truth.\n\nTo entrust all things to their own nature is to accomplish without action; to impose one’s will upon the world with a single body is to leave no task complete and no burden borne. One must preserve only what lies within the bounds of one’s nature. Each fulfills its allotted span of life. One does not attempt what one cannot. Even birds and beasts each have their means of self-preservation—thus when emperors and kings leave them to their own devices without interference, they achieve completion on their own. Have you truly failed to see how these two creatures each preserve themselves without instruction?\n\nTian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and arrived at the banks of the Liao River, where he encountered an unnamed man and asked, “I beg to inquire how to govern the world.” The unnamed man replied, “Away with you! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask such an untimely question? I am about to become one with the Creator. When I weary of this, I will ride the boundless bird beyond the six directions and wander in the land of Nothingness, dwelling in the vast wilderness. Why would you trouble my heart with governing the world?”\n\nTo ask how to govern the world is not to rise from the Great Beginning nor to rest in the Dark and Obscure. Let each person act according to their own nature. \"Boundless\" refers to the myriad fragments. Riding the myriad fragments, one gallops through the ten thousand things, thus able to move freely without constraint or obstruction. To leave all things to their own sphere of self-realization is to achieve order without governance.\n\nHe asked the unnamed man again, “If you let your mind wander in simplicity, harmonize your qi with emptiness, follow things as they are without imposing private designs, then the world will be well-ordered.” To follow one’s nature without adornment is simplicity. To rest in stillness within one’s nature is emptiness. To let nature take its course is impartiality; to seek to augment it with personal desire is partiality. Partiality ultimately fails to sustain life, while following impartiality preserves it.\n\nYang Ziju visited Lao Dan and said, “Suppose there were a man swift, strong, and resolute, with keen perception and clear understanding, who studies the Dao without weariness—could such a one be compared to a enlightened king?” Lao Dan replied, “Such a one, in the eyes of the sage, is like a clerk or artisan, bound by skill and toil, exhausting his body and startling his mind. Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards attract hunters, and the agility of apes and monkeys invites capture. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”\n\nYang Ziju, abashed, said, “I venture to ask about the governance of an enlightened king.” Lao Dan replied, “Such exertions cannot secure one’s own person—how could they compare to the sage-king? These are all cases of being ensnared by one’s own patterns and skills, not of riding emptiness to master the boundless.”\n\nLao Dan continued, “The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. He remains nameless, allowing things to rejoice in themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in Nothingness.”\n\nIf the world lacked an enlightened king, none could attain self-realization. That they do so is truly the king’s achievement—yet his achievement lies in non-action and entrusting the world to itself. When all in the world act according to their own nature, it seems as though the enlightened king played no part. The enlightened king fully realizes the nature of things, so each person claims, “I am thus of myself,” unaware of their reliance on him. Though his achievements cover the world, he does not claim them as his own, so all things believe they have attained their own joy.\n\nHe dwells in the path of transformation, daily renewed and without fixed form. Identifying with the ten thousand things, he wanders in emptiness. If one cannot merge with things, one is constantly at odds with them—how then could one wander in emptiness?\n\nIn Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew the life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death of men, predicting them by year, month, or day with godlike accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. Liezi met him and was enchanted. Returning home, he told Huzi, “At first I thought your Dao was supreme, but now I see there is something even greater.” He did not delight in hearing his own death date.\n\nHe claimed that Ji Xian’s attainment surpassed even yours. Huzi said, “I have shown you only its outward pattern, not yet its true substance. How then could you have grasped the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—how could they lay eggs? You present the Dao to the world with such insistence, and so you must be believed. That is why others can read your fortune.” He then said, “Bring him to me and let him observe me.”\n\nThis showed that Liezi had not yet embraced the Dao. Without embracing the Dao, one still has a mind; having a mind and clinging to one aspect, one must be believed by the world—thus others can read one’s fortune.\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huzi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Alas! Your master is dead! He will not live. It will not be ten days! I saw something strange—like damp ashes.” Liezi entered, his tears soaking his lapels as he told Huzi. Huzi said, “Earlier, I showed him the pattern of earth—sprouting yet unmoving, still. This must be how he saw me sealing my virtue’s mechanism. Bring him again.”\n\nStill and unmoving as a sprout, neither correcting itself nor standing upright, sharing the barrenness of withered wood and the lifelessness of damp ashes—this is the moment when the perfected person is without response. The perfected person moves like heaven, rests like earth, flows like water, and abides in profound stillness. Profound stillness and flowing water, heavenly motion and earthly rest—though they seem not to act, they are spontaneously so, all one in essence.\n\nNow, when Ji Xian saw him dwelling like a corpse in seated oblivion, he declared him near death; when he glimpsed his spirit moving in accord with heaven, he took it for signs of life. Truly, if one responds without employing the mind so that principle naturally aligns with the mysterious tally, rising and falling with transformations while taking the world as measure, then one becomes master of things and follows the timeless without limit—thus beyond the diviner’s reckoning. This is the great meaning of \"Responding to Emperors and Kings.\"\n\nWhen the mechanism of virtue remains unactivated, it is called \"sealed.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi again brought Ji Xian to see Huzi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Fortunate indeed! Your master has met me—he is recovering! Fully alive now! I see his sealed mechanism in motion!” Liezi entered and told Huzi. Huzi said, “Earlier, I showed him heaven and earth—names and realities did not enter, yet the mechanism arose from the soles of my feet. This must be how he saw my mechanism of goodness. Bring him again.”\n\n*Mechanism* here means the same as *trigger*.\n\nNow he himself realized that what he saw yesterday was the sealed mechanism in motion, which is why he had declared him near death. Within heaven and earth, the work of covering and bearing is manifest—compared to the pattern of earth, is this not a step beyond? This is the appearance of responsive resonance. When one entrusts oneself to natural covering and bearing, the heavenly mechanism mysteriously responds, and the adornments of fame and profit all become discarded things. The mechanism always arises from the utmost height, and when it moves and is good for the other, the other perceives it.\n\nThe next day, Liezi again brought Ji Xian to see Huzi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi, “Your master is unsettled—I can find no basis for divination. Try to settle him, and I will divine again.” Liezi entered and told Huzi. Huzi said, “Earlier, I showed him the Great Vacuity where nothing prevails—this must be how he saw my mechanism of balanced qi. The whirlpool formed by the *ni* fish is a deep pool; the stillness of still water makes a deep pool; the flow of flowing water makes a deep pool. There are nine names for deep pools—here we have three of them. Bring him again.”\n\nDwelling at the utmost height of the Great Vacuity, the mind drifts vast and still, merging all directions into profound unity—thus victory and defeat cannot find place within it. There is no movement that is not level, all blending into oneness. Those who peer at heaven through a tube see no bounds, and so it seems uneven. The deep pool is but the name for stillness and silence.\n\nWater is ever without intent, yielding to external things; thus, whether flowing or still, whether the *ni* fish coils or the dragon leaps, it remains ever a deep pool, never losing its stillness and silence. The perfected person acts when employing it and ceases when setting it aside; though action and cessation differ, their profound silence is one. Thus, three differences are briefly shown to clarify this.\n\nThough the currents shift through nine transformations, though order and chaos swirl in confusion, one who dwells at this height remains ever serene and self-content, drifting in forgetfulness of all doing.\n\nThe next day, Liezi again brought Ji Xian to see Huzi. Before he could steady himself, Ji Xian lost composure and fled. Huzi said, “Pursue him!” Liezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Huzi, “He has vanished—he is gone. I could not reach him.” Huzi said, “Earlier, I showed him what has never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and followed his flow, so he knew not who or what I was. Taking me for drifting grass, taking me for shifting currents, he fled.”\n\nThough transformations are ceaseless, their roots ever lie deep in hidden depths. Without intent, one follows the transformations of things, drifting unbound by any tether. As decay and dissolution shift like the world’s currents, there is nowhere one does not adapt. The perfected person is one, yet responds to the world’s changes and moves with the times—thus the physiognomist could find no place to fix his gaze, lost himself, and fled. This illustrates that one who would respond as emperor or king has no fixed method.\n\nThereafter, Liezi returned home believing he had never yet begun to learn. For three years he did not go out, cooked for his wife, and fed pigs as he would feed people, showing no partiality in his dealings. Carved and polished, he returned to simplicity, standing alone as a mere clod of earth. Though the world swirled in confusion, he remained thus to the end. He forgot distinctions of noble and base, attending only to what he encountered. He cast aside ornament and sought substance, shedding external embellishments. Though active, his true nature never scattered.\n\nLet things each fulfill their own ends. Be not the host of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of knowledge. Embrace the boundless and wander without trace. Exhaust what you have received from Heaven, yet perceive no gain—it is emptiness alone! The perfected person’s mind is like a mirror: it neither sends forth nor welcomes, responds yet does not store, and thus can master things without harm. Following things, each finds its proper name. Let things each devise their own plans, entrust tasks to each, and without intent, let each master its own knowledge.\n\nFollowing the self-so of the world, one may gallop through the ten thousand things without limit. Entrusting oneself to things, one leaves no tracks. When one has enough, one stops—perceiving gain, one does not know when to stop. Without emptiness, one cannot bear the weight of all realities. Reflecting things without emotion, one responds when they come and ceases when they go. Things arrive and are mirrored; the mirror does not act with intent, so though the world be vast, there is no weariness of spirit.\n\nThe emperor of the Southern Sea was named Sudden, the emperor of the Northern Sea was named Fleeting, and the emperor of the Central Realm was named Chaos. Sudden and Fleeting often met in the land of Chaos, who treated them very well. Sudden and Fleeting plotted to repay Chaos’s virtue, saying, “All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only this one lacks them. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Chaos died. Those who act ruin things.\n\nXiang Xiu and Guo Xiang’s *Commentary on the Zhuangzi*\n*Zhuangzi, Inner Chapters, “Free and Easy Wandering”*\n\nThough small and great differ, when released into the field of self-contentment, things follow their nature, affairs match their capacities, and each fits its allotted place—free and easy wandering is one. How could there be victory or defeat among them?\n\nIn the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun’s greatness—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The reality of the Peng and the Kun, I have not yet fathomed. The great purport of the *Zhuangzi* lies in free and easy wandering, non-action and self-contentment. Thus it exhausts the extremes of small and great to clarify the fittingness of one’s allotted nature. Those of far-reaching vision should grasp its essential convergence and let go of its incidental lodgings, not needing to quibble over every detail with the living. As long as it does not harm the grand aim, all may be roughly understood.\n\nThe Peng’s back—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. Roused to flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. This bird, when the sea surges, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond. Only a dark sea suffices to bear its body, only ninety thousand *li* suffice to support its wings. Is this a fondness for the strange? Simply, great things must arise from great places, and great places must give rise to such great things—this principle is naturally so, not to be feared as a loss. Why trouble the mind over it?\n\n*Qi Xie* is a record of marvels. It says: “When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, then spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*. With wings so vast, it is difficult to lift, so it must beat the whirlwind to ascend—only ninety thousand *li* suffice to sustain itself. With such wings, how could it suddenly rise and descend a few fathoms? All this is unavoidable, not a matter of delight. It departs on the six-month wind.”\n\nThe great bird departs for half a year before resting at the Celestial Pond; the small bird flies for half a morning before darting to the elm or sandalwood to alight. Though their capacities differ, in following their nature they are one. The wild horses of the air, the motes of dust—all living things are blown by one another’s breath. These are but what the Peng relies upon to fly.\n\nThe \"wild horses\" are wandering *qi*. Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no end? From above, the Peng sees the earth as we see the sky—thus it halts and sets its course southward, for it knows not the distance in *li*, but only that it has strength enough to go. If water is not deep, it cannot bear a great boat. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor, and a mustard seed becomes a boat; place a cup there, and it sticks fast—for the water is shallow and the boat too large. This makes clear why the Peng flies so high: its wings are vast. A small creature requires little, so a great one cannot make do with less. Thus there is a limit to principle, a fixed bound to things; each suffices for its task, and their fulfillment is one.\n\nIf one forgets the self and pursues life beyond what is fitting, undertaking what one’s strength cannot bear and acting against one’s nature, then even wings spanning the sky cannot escape exhaustion, nor can a sudden flight avoid distress. If the wind is not deep, it cannot bear great wings. Only when the wind lies ninety thousand *li* below does it now ride the gale; only when it bears the weight of heaven and brushes aside all obstacles does it now set its course south. Yet this is not a love of height or longing for distance—without accumulated wind, there would be no passage.\n\nThis is the Peng’s freedom.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: *\"We burst forth and fly, darting to the elm or sandalwood to rest, and if we fall short, we simply drop to the ground—why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?\"* If one is content in one’s nature, then even the great Peng has no cause to value itself above the small bird, nor does the small bird envy the Celestial Pond—for its desires are already fulfilled. Though great and small differ, their freedom is one.\n\nOne who journeys to the near wilds returns in a day with a full belly; one who travels a hundred *li* must pound grain the night before; one who goes a thousand *li* must gather provisions for three months. The farther the destination, the more provisions are needed—just as the greater the wings, the deeper the *qi* must be. What do these two creatures know? (The two creatures refer to the Peng and the shrimp.) Comparing great to small equalizes their differing aims. Why do their aims differ? Not because they choose to, but because it is naturally so. It is natural—not by effort.\n\nThis is the essence of freedom. Small knowledge does not reach great knowledge; short years do not reach long years. Each thing has its nature, each nature its limit—like years and knowledge, how could mere striving attain them? From here to Liezi, examples of long and short years and knowledge are given, each true to its own measure, none sufficient to surpass the other. Only the person free of dependence, who forgets self and others, who obscures these differences—only such a one, whose freedom is without merit, can unite great and small. For if there were great and small, then even the Peng and the sparrow, the minister and the wind-rider, would be bound by things. In life and death, only the one without life or death is limitless; if there were life and death, then even the great *chun* tree and the mayfly, Pengzu and the morning mushroom, would be equal in brevity.\n\nThus, to wander without great or small is to be without end; to be lost in neither life nor death is to be without limit. But if freedom is bound to a direction, then even if released to roam, it will reach an end—for it is not yet free of dependence. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not the waxing and waning of the moon; the cricket knows not spring and autumn—these are short years. South of Chu there is the *Mingling* tree, for which five hundred years are a spring, five hundred years an autumn; in high antiquity there was the great *zhuang* tree, for which eight thousand years are a spring, eight thousand years an autumn—these are long years. Yet Pengzu alone is famed for his longevity; for common people to compare themselves to him is truly pitiable! The disparity in years and knowledge is so vast—compared to what common people find lamentable, this is even more lamentable. Yet people do not grieve this, for each nature has its limit. If one knows this limit, then even the slightest difference cannot be bridged—what in the world is there to grieve?\n\nThings do not long for what is small because of its smallness, nor must the small envy the great. Thus, the difference between great and small has its fixed measure, beyond the reach of envy or desire—so the burden of envy and desire can be cut off. Grief arises from burden; when burden is gone, grief departs. When grief departs, life and nature are at peace—this has never been otherwise.\n\nThis is what Tang asked Ji about. Tang’s question to Ji also spoke of each thing having its limit, and that following it brings harmony—thus Zhuangzi affirmed his question.\n\nBeyond the barren north lies the Dark Sea, the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, thousands of *li* wide, whose length is unknown—its name is Kun. There is a bird there, its name Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It rides the whirlwind and the ram’s-horn gale to ascend ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds and bearing the blue sky, then sets its course south, bound for the Southern Darkness.\n\nThe marsh sparrow laughed at it, saying: \"Where is it off to now? I leap and bound upward, but descend after only a few *ren*, soaring among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the perfection of flight. And where is *it* off to now?\" This is the distinction between small and great. Each attains its nature as perfection and exhausts itself as the limit. Earlier, it was said that the two creatures differ, and so their destinations differ—one soars to the Celestial Pond, the other reaches only the elm and sandalwood—each is content with its form and finds sufficiency, unaware of why it is so. Now, speaking of the distinction between small and great, each has its natural endowment. This is not something attainable through striving or admiration. Each rests in its own nature, untroubled by their differences, and so the point is reiterated.\n\nThus, those whose knowledge suffices for one office, whose conduct matches one village, whose virtue aligns with one lord, or whose merit wins one state—such men regard themselves as this sparrow does, content within their own bounds, like a bird self-satisfied in its domain. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. Because he has not yet attained equality, he finds cause to laugh. Moreover, though the whole world praises him, he is not encouraged; though the whole world blames him, he is not disheartened. He has clearly settled the division between inner and outer, regarding himself as inner and all else as outer. He distinguishes the boundary between honor and disgrace, honoring himself and disgracing others. This is the limit. He cannot surpass it. Yet in his dealings with the world, he is not restless. He is sufficient unto himself, and so remains at ease in the world. Even so, he has not yet established the ultimate. He can affirm himself, but cannot be without something to affirm.\n\nLiezi rode the wind and traveled, lightly and skillfully. After fifteen days, he returned. In his pursuit of good fortune, he was not restless. He naturally rode the wind, not seeking knowledge through restless effort. Though he avoided walking, he still depended on something. Without wind, he could not travel—this is necessarily dependence. Only one who accomplishes all without reliance is free from dependence.\n\nAs for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, and harnesses the transformations of the six *qi*, roaming the boundless—what does *he* depend on? Heaven and Earth are the collective names for the myriad things. Heaven and Earth take the myriad things as their body, and the myriad things must take spontaneity as their constancy. Spontaneity is that which is not done yet naturally is. Thus, the great Peng’s ability to ascend, the marsh sparrow’s ability to descend, the tree stump’s ability to grow, the morning mushroom’s ability to be short—all these are what spontaneity enables, not what effort enables. What is not done yet naturally is, this is constancy. Therefore, to ride the constancy of Heaven and Earth is to follow the nature of the myriad things; to harness the transformations of the six *qi* is to roam the paths of change. Proceeding thus, where is there an end? What is harnessed and ridden—what more is there to depend on? This is the carefree wandering of one of utmost virtue, who merges self and other in mystery.\n\nIf there is dependence, then even Liezi’s lightness and skill cannot enable him to travel without wind. He must obtain what he depends on before attaining carefree wandering—how much more so for the great Peng! Only one who merges with things and follows great change can be without dependence and always penetrate. Yet even those who depend on something, if they do not lose what they depend on, are equal to the great penetration. Thus, whether dependent or independent, there is nothing that cannot be equalized. When each rests in its nature, the heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself, receiving without awareness—then there is nothing that cannot be distinct. Yet even independence is insufficient to distinguish dependence, let alone the great and small of those who depend!\n\nThus it is said: The Perfect Man has no self; having no self, he follows things and so attains. The Spirit Man has no merit; things have never thanked spontaneity for their lives, yet must rely on acupuncture and stone—when principle reaches its limit, traces vanish. Now, following without assisting, one becomes one with the ultimate principle, and so has no merit. The Sage has no name. The Sage is merely the name for things attaining their nature—this is insufficient to name how they attain it.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, saying: \"The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for it to shine? The timely rain has fallen, yet irrigation continues—is it not laborious for it to moisten? If you stand forth, the world will be well-governed, yet I still occupy the throne. I see myself as lacking. Please take the world.\" Xu You replied: \"You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. One who can make the world well-governed does not govern the world. Thus, Yao governs by not governing, not by governing and thereby governing. Now, Xu You clearly sees that once governed, there is nothing to depend on, yet the governance actually comes from Yao. Thus, his words 'you govern' should be forgotten to seek what they imply. Yet some say that one who governs and thereby governs is Yao, while one who does not govern yet enables Yao to govern is Xu You—this is far from the truth. Governance arises from non-governance; action emerges from non-action. Taking from Yao is sufficient—why borrow from Xu You? If one claims that only by folding one’s arms in the mountains and forests can one be called non-active, this is why the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi are rejected by those in power. Those in power necessarily dwell in the realm of action and do not return—this is the reason. Yet if I were to replace you, would I do so for the sake of a name? A name is but the guest of reality.\"\n\nShall I then be but a guest? One who takes up the burden of self responds to things, while one who follows things moves with them without opposition. Thus, Yao had no counterpart in the world, while Xu You stood as an equal to Qi and Xie. How can this be so? One who merges with things cannot be separated from them. Therefore, with a mind devoid of intent, responses arise spontaneously, following only what is sensed—adrift like a boat untethered, neither east nor west being its own. Thus, wherever one goes, one shares all with the people, and wherever one turns, one becomes the lord of the world. To rule in this way is like the world elevating itself—such is the virtue of the lord. But if one stands alone, loftily atop a mountain’s peak, this is not the natural inclination of human feeling, for to cling to oneness is but a partial preference. How can one claim this exclusively? Such a one is but a single thing among the common, an outer minister to Yao. If an outer minister were to replace the inner lord, this would be to bear the name of lordship without its true responsibility.\n\nThe wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs no more than a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than its fill. Each nature has its limit—if that limit is satisfied, then the rest of the world’s wealth is superfluous. Return to your repose, my lord—I have no use for the world! If you have no use for it, why does Yao alone possess it? Truly, one who embraces openness has no fixed direction, and so the world delights in elevating him without weariness.\n\nThough the cook does not prepare the meal, the invocator does not step beyond the altar to take his place. Cook and invocator each abide in their proper office; birds and beasts, the myriad things, each find sufficiency in what they receive; Yao and Xu You each rest in their allotted place—this is the ultimate reality of the world. Each attains their reality—what more is there to do? It is enough to attain it oneself.\n\nThus, though the paths of Yao and Xu You differ, in their freedom they are one. Jian Wu asked Lian Shu: *\"I heard Jie Yu’s words—they were vast yet without measure, sweeping away without return. I was startled and terrified by them, like the Milky Way stretching endlessly. They were so extreme, so far from human feeling!\"* Lian Shu said: *\"What did he say?\"* Jian Wu replied: *\"On the distant Guye Mountain dwells a spirit-person, their skin like ice and snow, their grace like a maiden’s. These are but borrowed words. The spirit-person is what we now call the sage. Though the sage may sit in the ancestral hall, their heart is no different from one in the mountains and forests—how could the world recognize this? They see only the yellow canopy and jade seal and think these enough to bind their heart; they see them traversing mountains and rivers, sharing in the people’s affairs, and think these enough to weary their spirit. How could they know that the most perfect remains unharmed?\n\nNow, to speak of one of royal virtue and lodge them on this mountain is to show that the world has no way to recognize them. Thus, they are placed beyond the farthest reaches, beyond the bounds of sight and hearing. The maiden does not let the outer harm the inner. They eat no grains, drinking the wind and dew. Though all eat grains, the spirit-person alone is so—this makes clear that the spirit-person is not formed by grains but is endowed with the wondrous qi of nature. They ride the clouds, mount flying dragons, and wander beyond the four seas. Their spirit is concentrated, so that things suffer no blight and the harvests ripen. Yet I deem this mad and do not believe it!\"*\n\nOne whose body embodies spirit and dwells in the numinous, who exhausts principle and reaches the subtlest mysteries—though they sit in stillness within the quiet hall, their mystery pervades beyond the four seas. Thus, they ride the Two Modes and harness the Six Abandonments, moving among the multitudes yet driving the ten thousand things. If nothing is not compliant, then floating clouds become their mount; if no form is not borne, then flying dragons become their steed. They cast off the self and attain spontaneity, though seemingly indifferent, they need nothing. Sitting in forgetfulness, moving in forgetfulness, forgetting even the act of forgetting—thus their movement is like dragging withered wood, their stillness like a heap of dead ashes. This is what is meant by their spirit being concentrated. When their spirit is concentrated, what is not concentrated attains spontaneity.\n\nThe world judges by what it sees and draws conclusions—how could it ever believe this?\n\nLián Shū said: \"Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns, the deaf cannot partake in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that suffers blindness and deafness? Knowledge, too, has its own. To fail to reach the ultimate subtlety of perfect speech and dismiss it as madness unworthy of belief—this is the deafness and blindness of knowledge. Such words are but the prattle of a child. To say that what Jiē Yú spoke of is naturally sought by things, and that those who are deaf and blind to knowledge deny its possibility—this man, this power, would rather merge with the ten thousand things as one, seeking to bring order to a disordered world. Who would wear themselves out taking the world as their concern?\n\nThe heart of the sage reaches the ultimate convergence of the Two Modes and exhausts the subtle numbers of the ten thousand things. Thus, they embody transformation and harmonize with change. There is nowhere they cannot go, pervading the ten thousand things so that nothing is not so. The world, in its chaos, seeks me, but I have no mind. If I have no mind, why should I not respond to the world? Yet one who embodies the mysterious and exhausts the subtlest—it is by not acting that they harmonize with the natures of the ten thousand things, shaping the transformations of the world, and so attain the fame of Yáo and Shùn. Who would wear themselves out with toil and anxious thought, taking affairs as their affair, and only then succeed?\n\nThis person, no thing harms them. To be at ease with what harms is to render harm powerless; when harm is powerless, things do not harm them. Great floods may rise to the heavens without drowning them; great droughts may melt metal and stone, scorch earth and mountains without heating them. Wherever they go, they are at ease—every place is fitting. Life and death bring no change to them, much less drowning or scorching! Thus, the perfected person is not entangled by calamity and disaster—not by avoiding it, but by following principle straightforwardly, naturally meeting with fortune. Their dust and chaff, the dregs they discard, are what would mold Yáo and Shùn. Who would take things as their concern?\n\nYáo and Shùn are but names for worldly affairs; those who act for names are not true names. Thus, Yáo and Shùn—were they merely Yáo and Shùn? They must have possessed the reality of the spirit-person. What the world calls Yáo and Shùn is merely the dust and chaff of their names. The people of Sòng carried ceremonial caps to Yuè, but the Yuè people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. Yáo governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm, yet when he went to see the Four Masters on the distant slopes of Miǎo Gū Shé Mountain, north of the Fén River, he was suddenly bereft of his world. Yáo’s uselessness to the world was like the Yuè people’s uselessness to the ceremonial cap. Yet one who abandons the world is truly revered by the world. Though the world revered Yáo, Yáo never possessed the world. Thus, he was suddenly bereft of it, his mind wandering in the farthest reaches of the obscure. Though he sat as if enthroned above the ten thousand things, he had never ceased to be carefree.\n\nThe Four Masters are but a lodging for words, to show that Yáo was not confined to being Yáo. In reality, Yáo was obscure; his traces were but Yáo. To view the obscure from the traces is to see inner and outer as separate realms—no wonder it seems strange! The world sees only Yáo as Yáo—how could it recognize his obscurity?\"\n\nHuìzǐ said to Zhuāngzǐ: \"The King of Wèi gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to hold five *dàn*. When I used it to hold water, its strength could not support itself. When I split it to make a ladle, its size was too vast to hold anything. It was not that it wasn’t resoundingly large—I smashed it because it was useless.\"\n\nZhuāngzǐ said: \"You are truly inept at using what is great. There was a man of Sòng skilled in making a salve that prevented chapped hands. For generations, his family made their living by washing silk floss. A traveler heard of it and offered a hundred gold pieces for the formula. The family gathered and deliberated: 'For generations, we’ve washed silk floss and earned only a few coins. Now, in one morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred gold pieces—let’s give it to him.' The traveler obtained it and persuaded the King of Wú. When Yuè raised a rebellion, the King of Wú sent him as a general. In winter, he fought a naval battle with the Yuè and crushed them, gaining land and a fief. The ability to prevent chapped hands was the same, yet one used it to gain a fief, while another could not escape washing silk floss—the difference lay in how it was used. Now you have a gourd of five *dàn*—why not consider making a great float and drifting upon rivers and lakes, instead of worrying that its size is too vast to hold anything? You still have the heart of a clump of mugwort!\"\n\nMugwort is not the path of one who is truly penetrating. This passage speaks of how things each have their proper use. If one finds their proper use, where could one not be carefree?\n\nHuìzǐ said to Zhuāngzǐ: \"I have a great tree—people call it the *chū*. Its great trunk is swollen and gnarled, not fitting the inked line; its small branches are twisted, not fitting the compass or square. It stands by the road, but carpenters do not glance at it. Now your words are vast but useless—just what everyone rejects.\"\n\nZhuāngzǐ said: \"Have you never seen a wildcat or weasel? They crouch low to lie in wait, pouncing on their prey. They leap east and west, not avoiding high or low...\"\n\nThey are caught in traps and snares and die in nets. Now consider the yak: its size is like clouds trailing across the sky. This creature is great indeed, yet it cannot catch mice. You have a great tree and fret that it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the vast and boundless wilds? Wander idly at its side, roam carefree beneath its shade. No axe will fell it prematurely, no thing will harm it. Useless? Where then could it be troubled?\"\n\nFor things great and small, if they miss their proper measure, the principle of benefit and harm is the same. When each finds its proper use, all things are carefree.\n\n---\n\nIn *The Inner Chapters: \"On the Equality of Things,\"* Master Nanguo Ziqi sat leaning against his armrest, gazing at the sky and exhaling deeply, his response seeming as if he had lost his counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, \"What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the heart like dead ashes? Yet the one who leans on the armrest today is not the same as the one who leaned on it before?\"\n\nAll things deem themselves right and others wrong, praise themselves and despise others—none are exempt. However, though right and wrong differ, self and other are equal. When heaven and humanity are united, self and other are equal, then externally there is nothing with which to rejoice, and in response, the body dissolves as if it has lost its match. Dead ashes and withered wood are valued for their stillness and lack of emotion. Those who follow their natural course and forget right and wrong embody only their innate nature—what else could there be? Thus, when still, they stand like a withered tree; when moving, they sway like a dry branch. Sitting, they are like dead ashes; walking, like drifting dust. The forms of movement and stillness are not what I can unify; their state of effortless self-possession is not what I can duplicate.\n\nZiyou had seen those who leaned on armrests before, but none like Ziqi. \"I have lost my 'I,'\" he said, \"and in forgetting myself, what in the world is there left to recognize?\" Only by forgetting both inner and outer can one transcend and attain all.\n\nZiqi said, \"Yan, how excellent that you ask! Just now, I lost my 'I'—did you realize it? You have heard the *human pipes* but not the *earth pipes*; you have heard the *earth pipes* but not the *heavenly pipes*!\"\n\n*Pipes* refers to flutes. Flutes vary in length, their notes differing in pitch, producing myriad sounds—some short, some long, some high, some low. Though the sounds are myriad, the measure they receive is one; thus, there is no place to interpose judgments of superiority or inferiority. How much more so with the winds and things of the world: different sounds share the same nature, each taking its own course, and so the *pipes of heaven and earth* are revealed.\n\nZiyou said, \"May I ask the method?\"\n\nZiqi replied, \"The great clod breathes forth *qi*, and its name is wind. It does nothing, yet when it arises, the myriad hollows roar in anger. Have you alone not heard its long sighs? The *great clod* is nothingness itself. As for the breathing forth of *qi*, how could there be a thing that does it? The *qi* simply breathes forth of itself. When things are born, none fail to arise of themselves—thus the body of this self-arising is vast, and so it is named the *great clod*.\n\nThe towering forests and jagged cliffs, the great trees with hollows as wide as a man’s embrace—some resemble noses, some mouths, some ears, some pegs, some rings, some mortars, some depressions, some pools. Some hiss, some whistle, some scold, some inhale, some cry, some wail, some moan, some shriek. Those ahead sing *yu*, and those behind sing *yong*. A gentle breeze elicits a small harmony; a whirlwind, a great one. When a fierce gale subsides, all hollows fall silent. Have you alone not seen them swaying—*tiaotiao*, *diaodiao*?\"\n\nThe wind does nothing, yet when it arises, the myriad hollows all rage and produce sound. The long sighs are the sounds of a great wind. The stirring of a mighty wind. Here, the various hollows are briefly likened to different things. Here, the diverse sounds of the myriad hollows are briefly enumerated. Though the notes of the sounds vary endlessly—singing and responding, great and small—none fail to match what they receive and each fits its place. *Subsides* means ceases. When a fierce wind blows, the hollows are full; when it ceases, they are empty. Though full and empty differ, in each attaining its proper state, they are the same. *Tiaotiao* and *diaodiao* describe the swaying of things. Though the sounds differ, so too do the movements of their forms. Yet though their movements differ, in attaining equality, they are one—how could *tiaotiao* alone be right and *diaodiao* alone be wrong?\n\nZiyou said, \"The *earth pipes* are simply the myriad hollows; the *human pipes* are the various bamboo flutes. May I ask about the *heavenly pipes*?\"\n\nZiqi said, \"The *heavenly pipes* blow through the myriad differences, yet each follows its own course. All take what is their own—who is it that stirs them to anger?\"\n\nThese are the *heavenly pipes*. For the *heavenly pipes*, is there yet another thing apart? They are simply the hollows, bamboo flutes, and all that joins with living things, converging to form a single heaven. That which is *wu* (nothing) cannot generate *you* (being); that which is *you* before it is born cannot be the source of life.\"\n\nThen who is it that gives life to life? It arises of itself, a clod that lives by itself. It lives by itself—it is not I who give it life. Since I cannot give life to things, and things cannot give life to me, then I am self-so. Being self-so, it is called \"heavenly-so.\" Heavenly-so is not made; thus it is spoken of as \"heaven.\" Speaking of it as \"heaven\" clarifies its self-so nature—how could it mean the azure vault? Yet some say the *heavenly pipes* compel things to follow them. But heaven itself cannot possess itself—how could it possess things? Thus \"heaven\" is simply the collective name for the myriad things. None is uniquely heaven—who then masters and compels things? Therefore, things each live of themselves, with no source from which they emerge—this is the Dao of heaven. All things attain themselves—who stirs them to anger, making them so? This further clarifies the *heavenly pipes*.\n\nThe great knowledge is leisurely, the small knowledge is leisurely. The great words blaze, the small words chatter. In sleep, their spirits intermingle; in waking, their forms open. They engage and contend, daily waging war in their hearts. Some are vague, some are guarded, some are secretive. Small fears make them tremble; great fears make them numb. Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow—this is what it means to judge right and wrong. Their restraint is like a sworn oath—this is what it means to cling to victory. Their decline is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily decay. What they drown in cannot be restored. Their weariness is like a sealed letter, speaking of their aging and stagnation. The heart near death cannot be revived. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, worry and sighing, change and fear, frivolity and ease, seduction and posturing—pleasure emerges from emptiness, steam gives rise to mushrooms. Day and night they alternate before us, yet none knows where they sprout. Enough, enough! Morning and evening we attain this—is this not how we come to be? This is the difference in knowledge. This is the difference in speech. This is the difference between waking and sleeping. This is the difference in interaction. This is the difference in fear and trembling. This is the difference in movement and stillness. Their decay and daily decay are like this. Their drowning and irreversible course are like this. Their weariness, sunk in desire, aging and growing ever more stagnant, are like this. Their pursuit of profit, fear of harm, secret scheming to achieve their aims, are like this. These are the differences in nature and disposition. These are the differences in events and changes.\n\nFrom this point onward, we briefly enumerate the boundlessness of the *heavenly pipes*; from this point downward, we clarify the self-so nature of boundlessness. Things each are self-so, not knowing why they are so yet being so—thus though their forms differ endlessly, their *so-ness* is endlessly the same. Day and night alternate, the old giving way to the new. Heaven and earth, the myriad things, transform and daily renew, advancing with time—what gives rise to them? They are simply self-so. This speaks of their self-generation. Without that, there is no \"I\"; without \"I,\" there is nothing to take. This is close, yet one does not know what makes it so. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found. It can be acted upon and trusted, yet its form is unseen—it has essence but no form. That is self-so. Self-so gives birth to me; I give birth to self-so. Thus self-so is simply my own self-so—how could it be distant? All things, in their multiplicity, are simply thus of themselves, not made to be so by one another. Therefore, leaving them to themselves, principle arrives of itself.\n\nThe myriad things, the myriad dispositions, differ in their inclinations and aversions—it is as if there were a true master making them so. Yet when one seeks the traces of this true master, one never finds them. Thus it is clear that all things are self-so, with nothing making them so. Now consider a traveler: he trusts that he can walk, yet does not see the form that enables him to walk. His disposition matches the thing, so the form is not separately visible. The face, the nine orifices, the six viscera—all are complete and present. With whom should I be intimate? Do you delight in all of them? Or do you have favorites? Are they all like servants and concubines? Are servants and concubines insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns being lord and subject? Or is there a true lord present? Whether one seeks and attains its essence or not, it neither adds to nor detracts from its truth. Entrust it to self-so, and all things are preserved. They simply exist of themselves. If one delighted in all, that would imply partiality. With partiality, one cannot preserve all things completely. Thus they exist without delight, live without being made. If one were partial to all, ambition would exceed one’s proper role, superiors and inferiors would encroach upon one another, and none would be servants or concubines. If those with the talents of servants and concubines do not accept the tasks of servants and concubines, they are lost.\n\nThus the principle of lord and subject, superior and inferior, inner and outer, hands and feet, is the natural pattern of heaven—how could it be the doing of a true person? Servants and concubines simply each fulfill their proper role—this is not insufficient for mutual governance. Mutual governance is like hands, feet, ears, and eyes, the four limbs and hundred parts, each with its office and all mutually serving one another. Those whom the times deem worthy become lords; those whose talents do not match the age become subjects. Like heaven’s natural height and earth’s natural lowness, the head’s natural position above and the feet’s natural position below—is there any alternation? Though there is no error in their proper places, they are necessarily proper of themselves. Leaving them to themselves, they are thus of themselves—this is not artificial.\n\nAll who attain their true nature and employ their self-so nature, though they be mere servants, still do not heed slander or praise but rest content in their work. Thus whether one knows or does not know, all are self-so. But if one opens the path of vain hopes, with inferiors encroaching upon superiors, things lose their truth, people forget their roots—then between slander and praise, one’s bearing is lost and confused. Once one receives this completed form, one does not perish until its end. Locked in mutual struggle and wear, one’s actions rush forward like a gallop, yet nothing can stop them—is this not lamentable? Toiling one’s whole life without seeing success, wearily exhausted yet not knowing where one is headed—how can this not be sorrowful?\n\nIf people call this \"not dying,\" what benefit is there? The form dissolves, and the heart follows it—can this not be called great sorrow? Is human life inherently so deluded? Am I alone deluded, or are there others who are not?\n\nEach nature has its allotted portion, so the wise guard their knowledge to the end, while the foolish cling to their ignorance until death—who can alter their nature midway? The myriad beings swirl in confusion, clashing in opposition and accord, each trusting their own biases and indulging their impulses, none able to turn back. This—what the common people deem sorrowful—is indeed sorrowful. Yet the common people never regard it as sorrowful, for it is the nature of their nature. Since all things are so by nature, what is there to lament?\n\nHuman desires know no bounds, and those who know contentment are few. Thus, having attained this, they do not stop but pursue that instead. All toil their entire lives, never sating their ambitions, ceasing only in death. Therefore, their success is never seen. All things wear out their bodies in pursuit of what they love, until they are exhausted and spent. Yet they do not know where this love leads! In truth, it is no different from death. When heart and form race together, weary yet unable to turn back, this is a sorrow greater than what common people grieve. But since common people never grieve over this, what they grieve is not worth grieving.\n\nAll the matters above occur without knowing why they occur—hence, they are deluded. Those who do not know do not know how they know, yet they know of themselves. The living do not know how they live, yet they live of themselves. Though the myriad things differ, in that their living does not arise from knowing, there is no difference—thus, none in the world are not deluded.\n\nIf one follows the completed heart and takes it as one’s teacher, who is without a teacher? Why must there be those who know the alternation and yet choose for themselves? Even the foolish do so! To have right and wrong before the heart is complete is like arriving in Yue today when you set out yesterday. Thus, to take what is not as what is—even the divine Yu could not comprehend it, so how can I?\n\nThe heart sufficient to govern the body’s use is called the \"completed heart.\" If one takes one’s completed heart as one’s teacher, then each person has their own teacher. Each person having their own teacher, they entrust themselves to it and it fits. To use the completed to replace the incomplete is not knowledge—it is the heart’s self-attainment. Thus, even the foolish take their completed heart as their teacher, unwilling to employ what they deem short and abandon what they deem long.\n\nIf you arrive in Yue today, how could you have arrived yesterday? Before the heart is complete, how could right and wrong arise? Those who clarify right and wrong cannot be without them, so the perfected person follows both. In principle, there is no right or wrong, yet the deluded take it as existing—this is taking what is not as what is. Once the deluded heart is formed, even sages cannot dispel it, so one entrusts it to its natural state without forcing knowledge.\n\nWords are not the wind’s blowing; speakers have something to say. Yet what they say is not yet settled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? Do they differ from the chirping of fledglings, or is there distinction? Or is there no distinction? Each has something to say, so they differ from the wind. I deem this right, and they deem it wrong; what they deem right, I deem wrong—so it is not settled. Not settled because of the bias of their perspectives.\n\nDo we take it as speech? Yet it is insufficient to settle anything. Do we take it as no speech? But one already speaks from one’s own position. Speech and the chirping of fledglings reach the same end—whether there is distinction or not is truly unsettled. The world’s sentiments need not be the same, yet their words cannot differ, so right and wrong swirl in confusion, with no way to settle them.\n\nWhere does the Dao hide to have truth and falsity? Where do words hide to have right and wrong? Where does the Dao go and not remain? Where do words remain and yet cannot? The Dao is hidden in petty achievements, words are hidden in florid embellishment. Thus arise the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other negates and negating what the other affirms. To affirm what they negate and negate what they affirm, nothing is better than illumination.\n\nThe Dao is nowhere absent! Why is it hidden to have truth and falsity, and why do the names of right and wrong arise in profusion? All remain. All are permissible. Petty achievements and florid embellishment naturally obscure the Dao, yet the Dao cannot be obscured. Thus, truth and falsity, right and wrong, operate in florid embellishment and cease in proper alignment, appear in petty achievements and vanish in great wholeness.\n\nConfucians and Mohists mutually affirm and negate, yet all in the world are Confucians and Mohists. Thus, the hundred schools arise, each prizing their own views, never stepping beyond their bounds. Those who have right and wrong are what the Confucians and Mohists affirm; those who have no right and no wrong are what they negate. Now, to affirm what the Confucians and Mohists negate and negate what they affirm is to illuminate the absence of right and wrong. To illuminate the absence of right and wrong, nothing is better than using the Confucians and Mohists to mutually clarify each other. Mutually clarifying each other, what they affirm is not right, and what they negate is not wrong. Not wrong, then there is no wrong; not right, then there is no right.\n\nNothing is not \"that,\" nothing is not \"this.\" From \"that,\" one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also depends on that.\" This is the theory of \"that\" and \"this\" arising together. Yet even as they arise, they die; even as they die, they arise. Even as they are permissible, they are not; even as they are not, they are permissible. Following right, following wrong; following wrong, following right. Therefore, the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates it by the heavens—this too is following \"this.\" All things deem themselves right, so nothing is not right.\n\nAll things deem each other \"that,\" thus nothing is not \"that.\" Nothing is not \"that,\" then under heaven there is no \"this\"; nothing is not \"this,\" then under heaven there is no \"that.\" Without \"that\" and without \"this,\" this is the profound unity.\n\nThe partiality of things lies in that none see what the other sees, but only know what they themselves know. Knowing what they themselves know, they deem themselves right. Deeming themselves right, they regard the other as wrong. Thus it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also depends on that\"—\"that\" and \"this\" arise through mutual dependence.\n\nThe changes of life and death are like the progression of the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Though the states of life and death differ, in each finding peace in what they encounter, they are one. Now, the living deem life as life, while the dead deem life as death—thus there is no life. The living deem death as death, while the dead deem death as life—thus there is no death. Without life and without death, without right and without wrong, the debates of Confucians and Mohists are what I cannot align with; yet when each obscures their own distinctions, these are what I cannot oppose.\n\nThe one who embraces openness follows the right and wrong of the world yet remains without right or wrong. Thus, not proceeding by the path of right and wrong yet ensuring no harm from right or wrong is simply to illuminate their natural state without deviation. This is also \"that,\" and \"that\" is also \"this.\" \"That\" has its own right and wrong, and \"this\" has its own right and wrong—is there truly a \"that\" and \"this\"? Or is there truly no \"that\" and \"this\"? Where \"that\" and \"this\" find no counterpart, this is called the *pivot of the Dao*. When the pivot is found at the center of the ring, it responds to the infinite. \"This\" is one infinity, and \"not-this\" is another infinity. Thus it is said: nothing compares to illumination.\n\nI, too, am deemed \"that\" by \"that.\" \"That,\" too, deems itself right. \"This\" deems itself right and \"that\" wrong; \"that\" deems itself right and \"this\" wrong—each contains within itself one right and one wrong. Now, if one wishes to call \"that\" \"that,\" yet \"that\" still deems itself right; if one wishes to call \"this\" \"this,\" yet \"this\" is still deemed \"that\" by \"that.\" Thus, the presence or absence of \"that\" and \"this\" remains undetermined.\n\nA *counterpart* is an opposition. \"That\" and \"this\" oppose each other, yet the sage harmonizes both. Thus, the one without intent merges with things and has never set up oppositions under heaven. The *pivot* is the essential point. Abiding in this essential point and meeting the profound extremity, one responds to the boundless. Right and wrong alternate endlessly, following one another without cease—thus they are called a *ring*. The center of the ring is empty; now, if one takes right and wrong as the ring and attains its center, there is no right and no wrong. Without right and without wrong, one can respond to right and wrong. Since right and wrong are infinite, the response is also infinite.\n\nUnder heaven, none do not deem themselves right and none do not deem others wrong. Thus, one right and one wrong proceed endlessly. Only the one who traverses emptiness and attains the center, vast and without attachment, rides upon it in wandering. To use a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger; to use a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nFor one to deem oneself right and others wrong is the common sentiment of \"that\" and \"this.\" Thus, if I use my finger to illustrate \"that\" finger, then \"that\" finger alone becomes a non-finger to my finger—this is using a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. If, in turn, \"that\" finger is used to illustrate my finger, then my finger becomes a non-finger to \"that\" finger—this is using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To clarify the absence of right and wrong, nothing compares to reciprocal illustration. Through reciprocal illustration, \"that\" and \"I\" are alike in deeming ourselves right and equal in deeming each other wrong. Equal in deeming each other wrong, then under heaven there is no right; alike in deeming ourselves right, then under heaven there is no wrong.\n\nHow can this be made clear? If \"this\" were truly right, then under heaven there would be no one to deem it wrong. If \"not-this\" were truly wrong, then under heaven there would also be no one to deem it right. Now, with right and wrong lacking a master, they are confused and chaotic—it is clear that these petty distinctions merely reflect each one’s biased views converging in uniformity. Looking up and looking down, none are not thus. Therefore, the perfected person knows that heaven and earth are one finger and the myriad things are one horse. Thus, vast and greatly at peace, heaven and earth and the myriad things each rest in their proper place, united in self-contentment, without right and without wrong.\n\nIs it permissible? Is it not permissible? What is permissible to oneself is called permissible; what is not permissible to oneself is called not permissible. The Dao is completed through its practice; things are deemed so through their naming. There is that by which it is permissible, that by which it is not permissible, that by which it is so, and that by which it is not so. How is it so? It is so in being so. How is it not so? It is not so in not being so. How is it permissible? It is permissible in being permissible. How is it not permissible? It is not permissible in not being permissible.\n\nThings inherently have that by which they are so; things inherently have that by which they are permissible. There is nothing that is not so; there is nothing that is not permissible. Thus, take a stalk and a pillar, an ugly woman and Xi Shi, the expansive, the strange, the deceitful, and the bizarre—all are united as one. In their division, they are completed; in their completion, they are destroyed. All things are without completion and destruction, united as one. There is nothing that is not completed; there is nothing that is not so. Each is so in its own way; each is permissible in its own way.\n\nA stalk lies horizontally while a pillar stands vertically; an ugly woman is repulsive while Xi Shi is beautiful. What is meant by \"equalizing\"? Surely it is not to equalize forms or unify standards! Thus, take the vertical and horizontal, the beautiful and ugly, the expansive and bizarre—each is so in its own way, each is permissible in its own way. Though principles may differ in ten thousand ways, their nature is equally attained. Thus it is said: the Dao unites as one.\n\nThings may be deemed dissolution by one and completion by another. What I call completion, another may call destruction. Completion and destruction arise from self-regard, blind to the other. Thus, there is no completion or destruction, just as there is no right or wrong. Only the enlightened know that all is united as one, and though they do not employ this knowledge, they lodge it in the ordinary. Following what is so, they rest in it without knowing why—this is called the Dao.\n\nThe enlightened are not confined to one perspective; suddenly, they forget themselves and entrust themselves to spontaneous use. In spontaneous use, all things flow smoothly and find their own fulfillment. \"Few\" means \"exhaustion.\" The ultimate principle is exhausted in self-fulfillment. The enlightened follow without contrivance. Do they know that following is good and thus follow? They do not know why they follow—they simply follow, and so it is called the Dao.\n\nTo strain the mind in pursuit of unity while failing to recognize its sameness is called \"morning threes.\" What is \"morning threes\"? The monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" All the monkeys were enraged. He then said, \"Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased. The names and realities remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were put to use—this, too, is following what is so. Therefore, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the celestial balance—this is called \"walking two paths.\"\n\nDoes the enlightened one strain the mind to achieve unity? If one labors the mind to force unity, it is unreliable and no different from those who fail to achieve it. They are as deluded as the monkeys, clinging to what they prefer and deeming themselves right. Without partiality, one entrusts all to spontaneous equilibrium and leaves it at that. Entrusting the world’s right and wrong—\n\nThe ancients’ knowledge reached its limit. Where did it reach? Some held that things had never yet begun to exist—this is the utmost, the exhaustion, beyond which nothing can be added! Next were those who held that things existed but had never yet been bounded. Next were those who held that boundaries existed but right and wrong had never yet arisen. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao; the diminishment of the Dao is the formation of attachment. Is there truly completion and diminishment? Is there truly no completion and diminishment? With completion and diminishment, there is Zhao’s zither-playing; without completion and diminishment, there is Zhao’s not playing the zither. Zhao Wen’s zither-playing, Shi Kuang’s wielding the baton, and Hui Shi’s leaning on the catalpa—these three were nearly at the height of wisdom, and so their deeds are recorded at life’s end.\n\nYet their attachment to their pursuits set them apart from others. Their attachment sought to illuminate them, but what they sought to illuminate was not meant to be illuminated—thus they ended in the obscurity of \"hard and white.\" And Zhao Wen’s son ended his life weaving the threads of his father’s art, achieving nothing. If this can be called achievement, then though I have achieved nothing, I too may be said to have achieved. If this cannot be called achievement, then neither things nor I have achieved anything.\n\nThus, the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage contemplates. Not employing this knowledge but lodging it in the ordinary—this is called \"illuminating through obscurity.\" This is to forget heaven and earth, to leave the myriad things behind, to look outward without examining the cosmos, to look inward without perceiving one’s own body. Thus, one is vast and unburdened, moving with things and responding to all without hindrance.\n\nThough one may not yet have forgotten all, one can still forget self and other. Though one may not yet have forgotten self and other, one can still forget their right and wrong. Without the Dao’s diminishment, emotions become partial and attachment takes form. Failing to forget attachment and relinquish self-interest, one cannot achieve mystical unity with self and other. This is not perfection.\n\nBeing and non-being—these one cannot know, even unto the end.\n\nThe myriad sounds cannot all be enumerated. Thus, when one blows pipes or plucks strings, though the fingers may move intricately, many sounds are still lost. Those who grasp the flute or strike the zither seek to manifest sound, yet in manifesting sound, sound is lost; in not manifesting sound, sound remains whole. Thus, to seek completion and thereby diminish it—this is how Zhaowen plays the zither. Not to seek completion and thus remain undiminished—this is how Zhaowen does not play the zither. \"Nearly\" means \"exhaustively.\" These three masters all sought to clarify what they themselves did not understand, thus exhausting their knowledge and depleting their thoughts, their bodies wearied and their spirits fatigued. Some leaned on their staffs and dozed, others rested against a catalpa tree and closed their eyes. They relied on their vigor to endure, for without it, they would have succumbed long ago.\n\nThese three masters each cherished only what they themselves understood, believing themselves distinct from the common crowd. They sought to display their understanding to others, desiring that all should share their preferences. This is like playing the reed organ to an ox. Since others ultimately do not understand, their own arts and methods end in obscurity. Zhaowen’s son, in turn, carried on his father’s legacy, yet in the end achieved nothing. Though these three sought to enlighten others, those others ultimately did not understand, and so they accomplished nothing in their lifetimes. If these three can be called accomplished, then even my own lack of accomplishment could be called accomplishment. All things illuminate themselves yet do not illuminate others. If, because others are not illuminated, one deems them unaccomplished, then all things would be without accomplishment.\n\nThus, the sage does not display this to dazzle that, nor abandons the self to pursue things. Following along, they allow each to fulfill its capacity, and so all things achieve completion without omission. Now, these three masters sought to display their own preferences to others—is this not delusion? The sage is without self. Thus, when faced with the dazzling confusion of doubt, they chart and delimit it; when confronted with vast deception and strangeness, they unify and harmonize it. They allow the myriad differences to rest in what they find restful, so that the multitude do not lose what they deem right. Thus, the sage is not employed by things, and the use of all things is fulfilled. When all things employ themselves, who is right and who is wrong? Therefore, even in the face of unbridled transformations and strange deviations, bending to follow them and entrusting them to their own use, though their uses may differ in ten thousand ways, all remains clearly self-evident.\n\nNow, suppose I were to speak here—how would I know if it is of the same kind as this? Or not of the same kind? Whether of the same kind or not, all are of the same kind when taken together, and thus no different from that. Nevertheless, let me attempt to speak: There is a beginning; there is that which precedes the beginning; there is that which precedes what precedes the beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is that which precedes non-being; there is that which precedes what precedes non-being. Suddenly, there is being and non-being, yet one does not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly so. Now, I have already spoken, yet I do not know if what I have called \"spoken\" is truly spoken or truly unspoken.\n\nIf I say there is no right or wrong, how would I know if this is of the same kind as those who speak of right and wrong or not? If I wish to call it the same kind, then I take non-being as right, while they take non-being as wrong—thus, it is not the same kind. Yet though this right and wrong differ, they are still not free from right and wrong, and so are of the same kind as that. Therefore, whether of the same kind or not, all are of the same kind when taken together, and thus no different from that. If one wishes to avoid such great dissimilarity, nothing is better than having no mind. Having dispelled right and wrong, one must then dispel the act of dispelling. Dispelling the dispelling again and again until there is no dispelling left—only then will there be no dispelling and nothing not dispelled, and right and wrong will depart of themselves. The ultimate principle is without words; to speak is to fall into classification. Thus, I tentatively entrust these words to this purpose.\n\nIf there is a beginning, there is an end. To speak of no end or beginning and to equate life and death—those who unify them do not compare to those who do not unify them and yet find them equal of themselves. This is to forget their unity. If there is being, beauty and ugliness, right and wrong are all present. If there is non-being yet one does not know that there is no non-being, then right and wrong, love and hate still linger in the heart. Even knowing there is no non-being, one may still not be without knowledge. To forget all knowledge entirely—only then does one suddenly begin to comprehend nothingness. In comprehending nothingness, heaven and earth, the myriad things, self and other, right and wrong—all become clearly and firmly so.\n\nTo say there is no right or wrong is still to make a statement. Not knowing whether this statement is being or non-being, one then becomes utterly free of the slightest speck of dust in the heart. Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing lives longer than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived. Heaven and earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, can there be speech? Since we have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. Proceeding from this, even the most skilled mathematician cannot arrive at a number, much less an ordinary person! Therefore, to go from non-being to being, reaching three—how much more so to go from being to being! Do not proceed thus; follow what is already so!\n\nIf one opposes things by form, then Mount Tai is greater than the tip of an autumn hair. But if each abides by its own nature and things reach their ultimate, then great form is not in excess, and small form is not insufficient. If each is sufficient in its nature, then the tip of an autumn hair is not merely small in its smallness, nor is Mount Tai merely great in its greatness. If sufficiency in nature is deemed greatness, then nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair. If sufficiency in nature is not deemed greatness, then even Mount Tai can be called small. Thus, it is said: Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small. If Mount Tai is small, then nothing in the world is great; if the tip of an autumn hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Without small or great, without long life or early death, the cicada does not envy the great *chun* tree and rejoices in its own contentment; the marsh pheasant does not prize the celestial pond and finds glory in its own sufficiency.\n\nIf one is content with Heaven’s natural endowment and at peace with one’s nature and destiny, then even heaven and earth are not long-lived enough to outlast me, for they arise together with me; the myriad things are not distinct enough to differ from me, for they attain together with me. If heaven and earth arise together with me, why should they not be as one? If the myriad things attain together with me, why should they not be identical? The myriad things in their myriad forms all find sufficiency in themselves, and their sufficiency is one. Once one has attained this oneness, there is no principle left to articulate.\n\nNames and terms arise from a lack of clarity. Some things cannot clarify their own oneness and thus pursue others through comparison, so they coin a term to correct them. Once they have named this \"oneness,\" they have already introduced speech. Yet to speak of oneness with words is to divide it, for oneness is not speech; thus, oneness and speech become two. Oneness is one, yet speech divides it again. With one and two, can we not call it three? To express oneness with a single word still yields three—how much more so when tracing its tributaries, where every thing has its own name? Even with skilled calculation, none can enumerate them.\n\nThus, those who name oneness do not differ from others, while those who forget oneness attain it without speech. Each abides by what it can do—this is the truest way. The Dao has never had boundaries, nor has speech ever had constancy; yet for the sake of this, distinctions arise. Let me speak of these distinctions: there is left and right, hierarchy and duty, division and debate, competition and contention—these are called the eight virtues.\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discourse; within the six directions, the sage discourses but does not debate; regarding the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the aspirations of former kings, the sage debates but does not contend. Thus, division implies what is undivided; debate implies what is undebated.\n\nOne may ask: \"Why is this?\" The sage embraces it, while the multitude debates to display themselves. Thus, it is said: debate arises from what is unseen. In profound obscurity, nothing is absent. When \"this\" and \"that\" are spoken, right and wrong have no fixed ground. The Dao is unbounded, so the myriad things freely occupy their allotted domains, each differing in what suits them. Every thing has its principle, every affair its fittingness. They are grouped by kind and distinguished by category. Pursuing side by side is called competition; opposing debate is called contention. Briefly distinguishing them, we have these eight virtues.\n\nWhat lies beyond the six directions refers to what is outside the inherent nature of things. Though principle exists even there, since it lies beyond the bounds of inherent nature, it does not move the sage, who therefore does not discourse on it. To discourse on it would be to lead the myriad things to learn what they cannot. Thus, the sage does not discuss what lies beyond, and the eight distinctions dissolve into self-sufficiency. One presents one’s nature and rests in it, following its completed traces to congeal at the ultimate of rightness, without clinging to one’s own rightness to condemn others.\n\nEach thing divides itself; each affair distinguishes itself. To desire to impose one’s own divisions is to fail to see their self-distinction. The sage harbors no such intent. Not seeing their self-debate, he debates what he knows to show them.\n\nThe great Dao is not named; great debate does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage does not harm. When the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao; when speech is eloquent, it falls short; when benevolence is constant, it is not all-encompassing; when integrity is pure, it is not trustworthy; when courage is harmful, it fails. These five, though incomplete, nearly approach the proper direction.\n\nEntrusting things to their own names, there is nothing to name. They distinguish themselves. Existing without attachment, they endure on their own. The utterly sufficient one is not affected by things’ comings and goings, so there is no place for modesty or fullness. Without obstruction, one can go anywhere without peril. To use this to illuminate that is to lose both. One cannot reach the self-division of things.\n\nThings have no constant attachment, and constant attachment is never all-encompassing. Brightly pure integrity is merely the greed of the fame-seeker, not true integrity. Harmful, contrary courage is detested by all under heaven, leaving no ground to stand. These five all injure what is fitting by acting, unable to rest in their original nature and endlessly seeking what lies outside. Seeking what cannot be sought is like trying to learn the square from the round or a fish longing to be a bird. Though one may aspire to phoenixes and emulate the sun and moon, the closer one draws to them, the farther one strays from reality. The more one learns, the more one loses one’s nature. Thus, when things are equalized, the burden of partial preferences is cast off.\n\nTo know to stop at what one does not know—this is perfection. Who knows the debate that does not speak, the Dao that is not spoken? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Storehouse. Pour into it without filling it; draw from it without depleting it; yet one does not know whence it comes—this is called preserving the light.\n\nWhat one does not know lies beyond the bounds of inherent nature. Thus, to stop within what one knows is to reach perfection. Vast and unconstrained, one entrusts all to it. The mind of the perfected one is like a mirror: it responds but does not store, so it remains open without fluctuation of fullness or emptiness. The coming of the ultimate principle leaves no trace. Allowing it to clarify itself, its light is never dimmed.\n\nThus, long ago, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I face south, I cannot put it aside. What is the reason?\" Shun said: \"Those three lords dwell among the mugwort and reeds. Why can you not put it aside? In ancient times, ten suns appeared together, and the myriad things were all illuminated—how much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun!\" Yao’s way of peaceful acceptance was not yet vast, so he listened to court affairs without joy. Seeking to lodge the principle of luminous equality in a great sage, he posed this strange question to elicit an answer.\n\nWhat things find peaceful has no baseness, so the mugwort and reeds are the wondrous abode of those three lords. When the doubled brightness ascends the heavens, the six directions are all illuminated, and there is no mugwort or reed that is not bathed in light.\n\nThe sun and moon, though impartial in their illumination, still leave some places unreached—yet virtue knows no such lack. Now, to force the aspirations of the mugwort and reeds and compel them to follow one’s own will—how could this expand the supreme Dao? Thus does the spirit remain unresolved.\n\nIf all things flourished according to their nature, each resting in what it finds peaceful, whether distant or near, hidden or deep, left to itself in perfect ease—then all would attain their fullest potential. In that case, nothing would be amiss for them, and nothing would bring disquiet to me.\n\nNie Que asked Wang Ni: \"Do you know what all things agree to be right?\"\nWang Ni replied: \"How could I know?\"\nWhat they agree upon is not necessarily right, and what they differ on is not uniquely wrong—thus neither can correct the other, and there is no use for such knowledge.\n\n\"Do you know what you do not know?\"\n\"How could I know?\"\nIf one knew what one did not know, that would itself be a form of knowledge. With knowledge, one could not entrust things to their own rightness.\n\n\"Then are things without knowledge?\"\n\"How could I know? Though let me try to speak of it: How do I know that what I call knowledge is not ignorance? How do I know that what I call ignorance is not knowledge? Now, let me ask you this: When people sleep in damp places, their waists ache and they become half-paralyzed—is that the case for loaches? When they dwell in trees, they tremble with fear—is that the case for monkeys? Of these three, which knows the proper place to dwell? People eat domesticated animals, deer eat grass, centipedes relish snakes, owls and crows favor mice—of these four, which knows the proper flavor? Monkeys mate with monkeys, deer couple with deer, loaches swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Xi Shi are considered beautiful by people—yet when fish see them, they dive deep; when birds see them, they fly high; when deer see them, they bolt away. Of these four, which knows the true beauty of the world? From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I discern their distinctions?\"\n\nThe multitude knows nothing—only then is one vast and unburdened by preferences. Precisely because they do not know, I dare not speak with certainty; I merely offer tentative words. Fish swim in water, a capacity shared by all aquatic creatures, and all call this \"knowing.\" Yet from a bird’s perspective, what was just called \"knowing\" becomes \"not knowing.\" The dung beetle’s knowledge lies in rolling its ball, while those who mock the beetle prize storax resin. Thus, what is commonly called \"knowing\" cannot be taken as an absolute standard. What is called \"not knowing\" is simply a matter of difference—it is still a kind of knowing, unique to its own domain. Since I do not know what is correct, I tentatively ask you.\n\nHere, I briefly cite three examples to illustrate the differing advantages of the myriad things. Here, I briefly cite four examples to show that beauty and ugliness have no fixed standard. Here, I briefly cite four examples to demonstrate that what the world favors varies endlessly. To condemn what differs is to have no way of knowing whether what is shared is truly correct. What benefits one may harm another, and since \"one\" and \"another\" in the world are boundless, right and wrong have no constant end. Therefore, only by refraining from debate and allowing each to follow its own nature can all things be freely and fully realized.\n\nNie Que said, \"If you do not know benefit and harm, does the Perfected Person likewise not know benefit and harm?\" Not yet having mastered this \"not knowing,\" he still suspects that the Perfected Person ought to know.\n\nThis knot remains unresolved.\n\nWang Ni said, \"The Perfected Person is divine! Though great marshes burn, they cannot make him hot; though the Milky Way freezes, they cannot make him cold. Though swift thunder splits mountains, it cannot harm him; though whirlwinds shake the seas, they cannot startle him. One such as this rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Life and death bring no change to him—how much less the mere tips of benefit and harm!\"\n\nWithout intent, yet nothing is not accorded. When spirit is whole and faculties complete, and the body merges with things, though one traverses the most extreme transformations, one has never ceased to be oneself. Thus, nothing lingers or lodges in the breast.\n\nOne lodges in things and moves—it is not the self that acts. Having taken change as one’s body, life and death are as one. Day and night pass without life or death—how much less can benefit and harm disturb the mind?\n\nJu Quezi asked Chang Wuzi, \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao. Without words, they speak; with words, they are wordless—and roam beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered these careless words, but I take them as the practice of the wondrous Dao. How do you think I should regard them?\"\n\nChang Wuzi said, \"Even the Yellow Emperor would have been perplexed by such words—how could Confucius know them! Moreover, you are far too hasty in your reckoning. Seeing an egg, you demand the crowing of the rooster at dawn; seeing a slingshot, you seek the roasted owl. I have spoken to you carelessly—why not listen carelessly in turn?\n\n\"To stand beside the sun and moon, to embrace the cosmos, to let things meet of themselves, to set aside confusion and disorder—why rank them in order of honor? The multitude toil to and fro; the sage appears foolish and dull. They blend the myriad ages into a single purity. All things are thus, and in this they are mutually enfolded.\n\n\"Affairs come of themselves, and principle responds of itself—one does not follow and engage with them. Proceeding straightforwardly, one avoids nothing and seeks nothing. Seeking brings no delight; taking directly brings no anger. This is the singular attainment.\n\n\"All that bears a name is not what I call it—they each name themselves. Thus, there is no 'that' with words and no 'this' without words. All that is not true nature is dust and grime.\n\n\"Things have their spontaneity; principle has its ultimate. Following it directly, one merges obscurely of itself—no words are needed. Thus, to speak is careless, and to hear is to be perplexed. Even the Yellow Emperor could not prevent all things from harboring attachments and being perplexed to the end. Therefore, the sage entrusts things to the realm beyond dust and grime, mysteriously uniting with what lies beyond sight and hearing. Illumined by Heaven, they do not oppose with calculation; released to spontaneity, they do not force clarity.\n\n\"Now, Ju Quezi, upon hearing careless words, you immediately take them as the practice of the wondrous Dao. This is no different from seeing an egg and demanding the rooster’s crow or seeing a slingshot and seeking the roasted owl. Those who cannot rest in their time and follow the natural order, who probe change and seek transformation, who contemplate death while alive, who cling to 'this' to debate 'that'—all are those who oppose with calculation.\n\n\"To speak is to be careless—so I have spoken carelessly. But if you listen to careless words as if they were true, you are again too hasty in your reckoning. So listen carelessly—why not?\n\n\"To take life and death as day and night is the metaphor of standing beside the sun and moon. To take the myriad things as a single body is the analogy of embracing the cosmos. Because there is that which is deemed base, honor and lowliness arise, and confusion and disorder proliferate, with none able to set them right. Each is self-certain in its own corner.\n\n\"Thus, for the Dao of effortless self-union, nothing is better than setting it aside and not speaking, entrusting it to spontaneity. To be vast and boundless is to be without waves or shores. To gallop through the realm of 'this' and 'that' is to be impure. Purity is to be without admixture.\n\n\"To survey the myriad ages and blend their changes—ordinary people call this 'mixed.' Thus, they toil in body and startle the mind, shunning 'that' and clinging to 'this.' Only the great sage, without attachment, proceeds straightforwardly and becomes one with change. In constant oneness with change, they ever roam in singularity. Though they blend countless ages, a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions, when the Dao moves through them and completes them, past and present are one. When things name them, the myriad things are as one.\n\n\"Nothing is not so; no time is not complete—this may be called purity. Nothing is not so. 'Enfolded' means accumulated. Accumulating 'this' over the myriad ages makes the myriad ages one 'this.' Accumulating 'so' over the myriad things makes the myriad things all 'so.'\n\n\"Thus, one does not know where life and death, before and after, reside; where 'that' and 'I,' victory and defeat, go. How do I know that delighting in life is not delusion? Life and death are one, yet one delights only in life—desiring to oppose change. Thus, one does not know it is delusion.\n\n\"How do I know that hating death is not like a youth lost and unable to return home? Young and losing one’s former home is called 'youth lost.' The youth lost settles into where they are and does not know to return to their homeland. How do I know that life is not such a youth lost? How do I know that death is not a return home—and yet one hates it?\n\n\"Li Ji was the daughter of the border guard of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her tears soaked her collar. But when she reached the king’s palace, shared his bed, and ate fine meats, she later regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret having sought life?\n\n\"Within a single lifetime, emotions change like this. On that day, one does not know the other—how much less can one know the change of life and death! 'Sought' means 'desired.'\n\n\"One who dreams of drinking wine wakes and weeps; one who dreams of weeping wakes and goes hunting. While dreaming, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even divine the dream—only upon waking does one know it was a dream.\"\n\nMoreover, only after the great awakening does one know that all this was but a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves already awake, priding themselves on their keen discernment. \"A lord! A herdsman!\" How rigid they are! Even you and I, Confucius, are but dreams—when I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called *diaogui* (strange and paradoxical). Even if a great sage should appear once in ten thousand generations to understand their meaning, it would be as if one encountered him at dawn or dusk.\n\nThis is the transformation of waking and dreaming. If circumstances change, emotions differ, and so the wishes of life and death cannot be the same. Thus, when alive, one delights in life; when dead, one delights in death. Though life and death differ, in each attaining their own wish they are one—what is there to cling to? From this perspective, at the moment of death, one does not know it as death but simply follows one’s own inclination. The dreamer who within a dream divines that dream differs not at all from the waking man. In the moment of encounter, nothing is lacking—why then, while alive, should one worry about death?\n\nThe great awakened one is the sage. The great awakened one knows that those who harbor anxieties and concerns remain unawakened. Fools, lost in their great dream, believe themselves awake, smugly distinguishing what they favor as rulers and what they despise as herdsmen, delighting in the biased views of their own faction—how narrow-minded they are! Unable to forget words and attain spiritual understanding, they are not truly awakened. Extraordinary discourse is beyond the comprehension of ordinary men, hence it is called *diaodang zhuogui* (startling and paradoxical), and they fail to recognize its profound liberation.\n\nThose who can shed all attachments and harmonize life and death are exceedingly rare. Even if you and I were to debate, and you defeated me, or I defeated you—would you truly be right? Would I truly be wrong? If I defeated you, and you did not defeat me, would I truly be right? Would you truly be wrong? Is it possible that one of us is right? Or that one of us is wrong? Or that both are right? Or that both are wrong? You and I cannot know for certain. People are inherently shrouded in obscurity—whom could I ask to judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with you to judge, since he agrees with you, how could he judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with me to judge, since he agrees with me, how could he judge rightly? If I asked one who differs from both you and me to judge, since he differs from us, how could he judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with both you and me to judge, since he agrees with us, how could he judge rightly? Thus, you, I, and others all cannot know for certain—should we then await another?\n\nYou and *er* both mean \"you.\" Without knowing, one speculates; without seeing, one debates. Debating is insufficient for self-assurance because it opposes things. Debating all day remains shrouded in obscurity, and in the end, none can be rightly judged—thus, one must leave it to self-correction. Agreement does not suffice as proof, nor does disagreement as grounds for rejection. If what you hold to be right were truly right, then no one in the world could contradict it; if what you believe to be wrong were truly wrong, then there would be no basis for anyone to affirm it. Now, people affirm what they agree on and reject what they differ on—with agreement and difference both present, right and wrong have no fixed ground.\n\nThus, right and wrong arise from the love of debate and rest in the *tianjun* (Heavenly Equalizer). Entrust them to the two alternatives and let them resolve themselves. Each corrects itself. Relying on another is insufficient to correct oneself, so no one in the world can correct another—thus, one must leave it to self-correction to reach the ultimate.\n\nThe *tianni* (Heavenly Boundary) is the natural division. Right and wrong, affirmation and negation, self and other oppose one another—hence, there is no debate. Without debate, one harmonizes with the *tianni*, abiding in one’s natural division alone, without relying on another for correction. The mutual dependence of opposing voices is like their non-dependence. Harmonizing with the *tianni* and following the boundless transformation, one exhausts the years.\n\n\"What does it mean to harmonize with the *tianni*?\" It means: \"Is it so? Is it not so? So or not so. If what is right were truly right, then its difference from what is not right would require no debate; if what is so were truly so, then its difference from what is not so would require no debate.\" Forgetting years, forgetting righteousness, one roams beyond all bounds—thus, one lodges in the boundless. The debate over right and wrong is but the transformation of voices. The mutual dependence of these transforming voices is insufficient to correct one another, so they are as if non-dependent. Harmonizing with the natural division and following the infinite transformation, pursuing this path, the realm of right and wrong naturally dissolves, and the essence of life and destiny is fully realized.\n\nForgetting years, one harmonizes life and death; forgetting righteousness, one transcends right and wrong. When right and wrong, life and death dissolve into one, this is the ultimate principle. The ultimate principle flows without limit—thus, those who lodge in it cannot be exhausted.\n\nThe shadow’s companion asked the shadow, \"Earlier, you were moving; now, you are still. Earlier, you were sitting; now, you are rising. Why are you so without constancy?\"\n\nThe shadow replied, \"Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada? How would I know why it is so? How would I know why it is not so?\"\n\nThe \"shadow’s companion\" is the faint shade beyond the shadow. This speaks to the natural workings of the celestial mechanism, where sitting and rising occur without dependence. Those who attain without dependence—who can fathom their cause and demand their reason? If one insists on tracing their dependence and seeking their origin, such inquiry would stretch endlessly, ultimately reaching the state of no-dependence, where the principle of spontaneous transformation becomes clear. If one were to depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada, the lack of constancy would not be hard to understand. The reason it is not understood now is precisely because it does not depend on such things but transforms spontaneously.\n\nSome in the world say the shadow’s companion depends on the shadow, the shadow on form, and form on the Creator. Let us ask: Does the Creator exist or not? If not, how could it create things? If so, it would not suffice to account for the multitude of forms. Only by recognizing that the multitude of forms arise from themselves can one begin to speak of creation. Thus, within the realm of existing things, even the shadow’s companion does not fail to transform spontaneously in profound obscurity. Therefore, the Creator has no master, and each thing creates itself. Each thing creates itself without dependence—this is the true nature of heaven and earth.\n\nThus, self and other are mutually entailed, form and shadow arise together; though profoundly united, they do not depend on one another. Understanding this principle will lead all things to return to their root within themselves without relying on externals. Externally, nothing is to be rejected; internally, nothing is to be prized. Therefore, all things emerge serenely without knowing why they are born, and all attain their nature without knowing how they attain it. Now, the shadow’s companion’s relation to the shadow is like saying they arise together without dependence. Thus, though all things gather and together complete heaven, each stands distinctly and sees itself alone. Therefore, the shadow’s companion is not controlled by the shadow, nor is the shadow moved by form, nor is form transformed by nothingness. Whether transformed or not, so or not so, following others or acting on one’s own—all arise spontaneously. How could I know their cause?\n\nThus, to follow without aiding is to allow root and branch, inner and outer, to flow unimpeded and attain their nature, leaving no trace. If one clings to proximate causes and forgets their spontaneity, seeking externals and losing the inner master, then attachment and esteem arise. Though one may wish to equalize and harmonize, what is esteemed already resides in the heart—how can there be any leveling?\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering and joyful, a butterfly content with itself. He did not know he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, palpably Zhou. Did Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things. Delighting in one’s own joy, acting with ease and pleasure—when he dreamed he was a butterfly and did not know he was Zhou, it was no different from death. Yet wherever he was, he was content. Thus, those who cling to life while alive will surely cling to death when dying. From this, we see that those who grieve over death while alive are mistaken.\n\nSpeaking from Zhou’s perspective, he called it waking, but it may not have been waking. Now, not knowing the butterfly is no different from the dream’s not knowing Zhou. Each suits its momentary contentment, so there is no way to prove the butterfly does not dream it is Zhou. Some dream in a brief nap and experience a hundred years—there is no way to prove that this hundred years is not a dream in a nap. Time does not pause for even a moment, and the present does not endure. Thus, yesterday’s dream has already transformed by today. The change between life and death is no different—why trouble the heart over it?\n\nTo be so absorbed in one is to be unaware of the other—this is like dreaming of being a butterfly. To take it from a human perspective, in a single lifetime, the present does not know the future—this is like Lady Li. Yet fools secretly believe they know that life is joyful and death is bitter, never having heard of the transformation of things.\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Zhuangzi, \"The Secret of Caring for Life\"*\n\nMy life has limits, but knowledge is without bounds. To pursue the boundless with the limited is perilous! And to do so while claiming to be wise is perilous indeed! In doing good, avoid seeking fame; in doing evil, avoid approaching punishment. Follow the central path as your constant guide—this can preserve the body, fulfill life, nurture one’s kin, and complete one’s years.\n\nLife exists to be nurtured, so nurturing life is the ultimate principle. Yet if nurturing exceeds its limit and harms life, it is no longer the true way of nurturing life. The endowment each receives has its own limit. Lifting heavy weights and carrying light ones while the spirit and qi remain unperturbed—this is the limit of one’s strength. Those who crave fame and compete for victory, even if they break their backs, will never satisfy their desires—this is the boundlessness of knowledge. Thus, the pursuit of knowledge arises from imbalance and vanishes in profound spontaneity.\n\nProfound spontaneity means following one’s utmost capacity without adding even a hair’s weight. Therefore, though bearing ten thousand jun, if it matches one’s ability, one suddenly forgets the weight on one’s body. Though responding to ten thousand affairs, one remains oblivious to their presence. This is the true way of nurturing life. To seek boundless knowledge with a limited nature—how can one not be exhausted? Already exhausted by knowledge and not knowing to stop, then using knowledge to remedy it—this is nurturing that harms, truly perilous.\n\nForgetting good and evil and abiding in the center, allowing all things to act on their own, merging obscurely with the most fitting—thus, punishments and fame keep their distance, and perfect principle resides within. Taking the central path as one’s constant, nurturing one’s kin appropriately—if one attains the center and moves in profound spontaneity, then nothing is impossible. Nurturing life does not seek to exceed one’s portion; it is merely about fulfilling principle and completing one’s years.\n\nWhen Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui, where his hand touched, his shoulder leaned, his foot stepped, his knee pressed—*hua!*—the sounds rang out. The blade’s advance—*huo!*—was flawless, matching the rhythm of the \"Mulberry Grove\" dance, attaining the harmony of the \"Jingshou\" melody.\n\nLord Wenhui exclaimed, \"Excellent! How has your skill reached such heights?\" He spoke of how Cook Ding seized every advantage to apply his craft, leaving no joint unloosed, fully exhausting principle—both perfectly suiting the ox’s structure and harmonizing with rhythm and measure.\n\nCook Ding set down his blade and replied, \"What your servant delights in is the Dao, which advances beyond mere skill. When I first began to carve oxen, all I saw was the whole ox. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. Now, I encounter it with spirit rather than sight; my senses halt while my spirit moves. I rely on Heaven’s patterns, cleaving great gaps, guiding the blade through great cavities, following what is inherently so. Even the finest network of sinews and bones has never once impeded me—how much less the great thigh bones! A good cook changes his blade every year, for he cuts; an ordinary cook changes his blade every month, for he hacks. Your servant’s blade has endured nineteen years, carving thousands of oxen, yet its edge remains as if freshly whetted. For where the joints have spaces, and the blade has no thickness, entering with what has no thickness into those spaces—how vast is the room for the blade to move! Thus, after nineteen years, my blade’s edge is still as if newly whetted from the grindstone.\n\nYet whenever I come to a complex cluster, I see the difficulty, grow cautious, focus my gaze, slow my movements, and move the blade with utmost subtlety—*huo!*—and the ox falls apart like clods of earth. I stand holding the blade, look around in satisfaction, then clean and put it away.\" Here, he simply lodged the Dao within his skill—what he truly delighted in was not skill itself.\n\nThough he has yet to perceive the spaces within the principle—(3)\nHe simply perceives those spaces within the principle.\nThe office of scrutiny lies abandoned;\nhe lets his mind flow freely, following the principle’s grain. (4)\nHe does not cut across it.\nWhere boundaries arise, he merely strikes along them to part the way.\nJoints dissolve, cavities open—he guides them to separate.\nThe blade is never applied recklessly.\nThe marvel of his skill lies in constantly gliding the edge through emptiness,\nnever once brushing against the slightest obstruction.\n\n*Gū*—when the blade twists against a great bone, it galls the edge,\nfor it has not struck the space within the principle.\nTo hit bone is to break the blade.\n\n*Xíng*—the whetstone.\n\nTangled clusters form where sinews and bones interlace.\nHe no longer fixes his gaze on other things.\nHis hand moves slowly.\nWhen he finds the proper point, little force is needed.\nThe principle is cleaved without trace of the blade, as if earth crumbles away.\n\n*Yì zú róng yù zì dé*—this is ease of foot, ample leisure, and self-possession.\n\nHe wipes the blade and sheathes it.\n\nPrince Wenhui said: \"Excellent! From the words of Cook Ding, I have gained insight into nurturing life.\"\nSince the blade may be nurtured, so too may life be nurtured.\n\nGongwen Xuan saw the Right Master and was startled, saying: \"What manner of man is this? How did he become one-legged? Was it Heaven’s doing?\"\n\n\"Was it man’s doing?\"\nHe replied: \"Heaven’s, not man’s. Heaven’s life bestows this solitary state, while man’s form bears companionship. From this we know it is Heaven’s work, not man’s.\"\n\n*Jiè* is the term for partial amputation. What knowledge cannot remedy is Heaven’s doing. To defy what one knows is man’s doing. Partial amputation is called *solitary*. If a master’s knowledge, confined to one household, cannot preserve both feet, then this is what knowledge cannot remedy. Were the Right Master’s knowledge to insist on preserving both, his spirit would inwardly falter and his body outwardly decay—how could it be merely partial amputation! Walking with both feet is called *companionship*. The appearance of companionship never arouses doubt that it is not fate. Since companionship is fate, we know that solitude is likewise not of our own making. Thus, one who grasps the essence of life does not strive for what life cannot achieve; one who grasps the essence of fate does not strive for what fate cannot remedy. To preserve one’s natural state is all.\n\nA marsh pheasant takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink, yet it does not seek to be kept in a cage. Though its spirit may flourish, this is not well-being. *Qí* means to seek; *fán* is what cages the pheasant. To move freely between heaven and earth, to wander in the realm of self-possession—this is the subtlety of nurturing life. Why seek to enter a cage and submit to care? What begins in comfort and never ceases to be comfortable is to forget comfort. The pheasant’s spirit flourishes, its will and qi overflow with ease, and it roams the clear, open land, unaware that it is doing well.\n\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi went to mourn him, crying out three times before leaving. A disciple said: \"Was he not your friend?\"\n\"Yes.\"\n\"Then is such mourning fitting?\"\nPeople mourn, and so he mourned; people wail, and so he wailed. They found it strange that he did not linger at the door to observe the transformation, yet cried out three times.\nHe said: \"At first I thought he was a man, but now I see he was not.\"\n\nWhen I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and the young weeping as if for their own mothers. Those who gathered there must have been moved to speak when no words were sought, to weep when no weeping was sought. This is to flee from Heaven and betray one’s nature, to forget what one has received—ancients called this \"the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.\" When he came, it was the Master’s time; when he departed, it was the Master’s compliance. To rest in one’s time and abide in compliance is to keep sorrow and joy from entering—ancients called this \"the Great Release.\"\n\nThe perfected person has no personal attachments and merely joins the crowd in lamentation, so such conduct is fitting. The nature one receives from Heaven has its own proper measure; it cannot be escaped, nor can it be augmented. To flee from Heaven’s principle and amplify worldly emotions, to let sorrow and joy pass through the heart, is to bind the spirit in suffering, no different from flogging. Was this not a kind of punishment? The enlightened of old held such views.\n\nTime brings life of itself; principle demands death. Sorrow and joy arise from loss and gain. But the sage who embodies mysterious penetration and harmonizes with change is at peace in every moment, at home in every circumstance. Merged with the transformations of creation, there is nowhere that is not oneself—what gain or loss, what life or death could there be? Thus, to follow what one has received is to leave no space for sorrow or joy to intrude.\n\nTo take the bound as suspended is to see the unbound as the Great Release. In this release, the truth of one’s nature and destiny is realized—this is the essence of nurturing life. A finger may be exhausted in serving as kindling, but the fire is transmitted, and its end is unknown. \"Exhausted\" means \"ended\"; \"kindling\" is like the previous fuel. The finger may reach the end of the previous fuel’s principle, yet the fire is passed on and does not expire. The heart that receives nurturance continues life without cessation. This reveals that nurturing life is the very means by which life endures.\n\nTime does not return, and the present does not pause. Thus, a person’s life is but a single breath, a single moment of attainment. The previous breath is not the present breath, so nurturance continues life; the former flame is not the later flame, so the fire is transmitted through the fuel. The fire is transmitted and life continues—this is the culmination of nurturance. How could the world know that life is exhausted only to be reborn?\n\nFrom *Zhuangzi*, \"Inner Chapters,\" \"The Human World\" (Chapter Four):\nYan Hui sought an audience with Confucius and asked to be sent on a mission.\n\nYan Hui said, \"Where are you going?\"\nHe replied, \"I am going to the state of Wei.\"\nYan Hui asked, \"What will you do there?\"\nHe replied, \"I have heard that the lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats his state lightly and does not recognize his faults. He recklessly expends his people’s lives, and the dead are measured by the state as if filling a marsh—like reeds, the people have nowhere to turn. I once heard you say, ‘Leave a well-governed state; go to a disordered one. The physician’s gate is crowded with the sick.’ I wish to apply what I have heard and reflect on how to act, hoping that the state may yet be cured.\"\n\nOne who mingles with others cannot depart from them. Yet the vicissitudes of the human world differ with each generation, and only those who are without fixed intent and do not impose their own will can adapt to change without bearing its burdens. He does not share the people’s desires. For one who rules others, every action rides upon the people—one outburst of anger brings corpses and flowing blood, one moment of joy fills the roads with carriages and caps. Thus, the ruler’s use of the state cannot be taken lightly. None dare admonish him. He recklessly drives them to their deaths. The entire state is delivered to the brink of death, countless as the fallen, regarded as mere grass and weeds. They have nowhere to turn.\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas! You are likely to go and be punished! The Dao does not tolerate杂乱.杂乱 leads to excess, excess to disturbance, disturbance to worry, and worry cannot be remedied. The utmost person of old first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. If what is established within oneself is not yet settled, how can one attend to the conduct of a violent ruler? Their Dao is insufficient to save that affliction. It is fitting to find the right person. If one does not find the right person, then even if a hundred physicians guard the illness, it will only deepen doubt and fail to bring a single cure. To respond to things without an empty mind and to exhaust one’s thoughts in confronting difficulties—this shows that what is established within oneself is not yet settled. Only by setting aside knowledge to nurture the true, entrusting the wondrous to the talents of the multitude, attributing merit and fame to others while keeping worries and concerns far from oneself, can one then proceed to the conduct of a violent ruler.\n\nDo you also know whence virtue’s dissipation and knowledge’s emergence arise? Virtue dissipates for the sake of fame, and knowledge emerges from contention. Fame is that by which people vie; knowledge is the instrument of contention. Both are inauspicious tools, not means to fully realize one’s conduct. Virtue’s dissipation stems from pride in fame; knowledge’s reckless emergence stems from contention over goodness. Even Jie and Zhi, in what they prized and cherished, sought nothing beyond fame and goodness. Fame and wisdom are what the world employs. Yet when fame arises, contention follows; when wisdom is used, strife flourishes. Thus, only by abandoning fame and knowledge can one’s conduct be fully realized.\n\nMoreover, thick virtue and steadfast trust have not yet reached others’ *qi*; fame without contention has not yet reached others’ hearts. To forcibly display the language of benevolence and righteousness, compass and square before a violent ruler is to make others resent what they perceive as your beauty—this is called ‘bringing disaster upon others.’ One who brings disaster upon others will surely have disaster reflected back upon them. You are likely to bring disaster upon yourself. If you merely delight in the worthy and despise the unworthy, what need is there to seek distinction? If you do not instruct, the king and dukes will surely exploit others to vie for victory. Your eyes will be dazzled, your complexion will become placid, your mouth will scheme, your demeanor will take shape, and your heart will conform. This is like using fire to save fire, water to save water—it is called ‘increasing excess.’ Following the beginning without end, you will likely, with insincere grand words, meet your death before the violent ruler!\n\nWhen one offers a luminous pearl at night, few do not grasp their swords—this is because they do not understand. Now, your virtue and trust, along with your fame of non-contention, are things they do not understand. To forcibly apply the standards of benevolence and righteousness to them, they will say you seek to destroy others to establish yourself. Thus, the utmost person does not exhaust their will in ordering the world but responds to things with an empty mind. Sincerity and trust are manifest in heaven and earth; non-contention flows freely among the myriad things. Only then do the myriad things return to embrace them, heaven and earth do not oppose them, their virtuous reputation spreads and the world responds in harmony, their illustrious conduct shines and the six directions all answer. Only then can one traverse cold and heat, navigate order and chaos, without clashing with the dragon’s reversed scales.\n\nIf your approach is not trusted, they will say you contend for fame and turn to harm you. If you can delight in the worthy and despise the foolish, hear righteousness and submit, you will be a enlightened ruler. If you are an enlightened ruler, you will not suffer from a lack of worthy ministers, and your going will not be extraordinary. If it is not so, you will surely be harmed. Thus, to go with intent is to have no place to go; to respond without intent is to have response come of itself—then there is nowhere you cannot go. You need only remain silent and wordless. If you speak, the king and dukes will surely exploit their authority as rulers to engage in verbal sparring, using clever speech to reject admonition and adorn their faults. Their words will be quick and persuasive, dazzling the eyes. You will be unable to distinguish yourself from them, with no time to save or extricate yourself, and will end up releasing yourself to follow them. Unable to save them, you will only strengthen their power.\n\nClinging to the usual and refusing to change, they will not trust you. To admonish without trust, even earnest words will bring harm. Moreover, in ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both were those who cultivated themselves and humbly comforted the people, yet by submitting to those below, they offended those above. Thus, their rulers used their cultivation to cast them out. These were lovers of fame. In ancient times, Yao attacked Cong, Zhi, Xu, and Ao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became wastelands of the dead, and they themselves were executed. Their use of arms did not cease, their pursuit of fame and substance was unending—have you alone not heard of this? Fame and substance are things even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can you!\"\n\n\"Even so, if you must have some way, come and tell me of it.\"\n\nGuan Longfeng and Prince Bigan, though dwelling below, took on the cares of those above—this was not their proper duty. They did not wish to let ministers gain the reputation of surpassing their rulers. Tyrannical rulers do not merely seek to indulge their desires; they also seek fame, though what they seek is not the true Dao.\n\nRulers who covet fame and lust after desires—even Yao and Yu could not transform them. Thus, the people joined together to attack them, yet you would go empty-handed to transform them with the Dao?\n\nYan Hui said, \"If I maintain a proper demeanor yet empty my mind, and strive to be single-minded, would that suffice?\"\n\n\"To rectify one’s form while emptying one’s heart—this is to speak with humility and without duplicity.\"\n\nHe said, \"That will not suffice.\"\n\nYan Hui asked, \"Why not? If one’s yang qi is full to overflowing, with shifting colors and an unsteady countenance—common people dare not oppose it. One seizes upon what moves others to seek compliance with one’s own heart. This is called a gradual virtue that does not take shape—how much less can great virtue do so! One will cling rigidly without transformation, outwardly conforming while inwardly scorning—how could this ever succeed?\"\n\nThis speaks of the Lord of Wei: his overbearing yang nature swells within and flaunts itself without, reaching the height of arrogance. His moods shift unpredictably, and none dare defy him. Such extreme obstinacy—when others act to please him, he tramples them, then suppresses and humiliates them, seeking ease and indulgence to satisfy his extravagant heart. His words, whether few or many, admit no yielding or concession. Thus, he clings to his original intent. Outwardly conforming while inwardly scorning—this is merely the earlier \"proper demeanor, empty mind, and single-minded striving,\" which is insufficient to transform him.\n\n\"Then let me be inwardly upright and outwardly yielding, achieving success by emulating the ancients. To be inwardly upright is to follow Heaven. One who follows Heaven knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven. Why should one alone seek that others praise one’s words or seek that others not condemn them? Those who act thus are called childlike—this is what it means to follow Heaven. To be outwardly yielding is to follow others. Raising the hands, kneeling, and bowing—these are the rites of a minister. If all others do so, how dare I not? To do what others do, so that none find fault—this is what it means to follow others. To achieve success by emulating the ancients is to follow the past. Though my words may instruct, their substance is fitting and true, for they belong to the ancients, not to me. Thus, though upright, one avoids harm—this is what it means to follow the ancients. Would this suffice?\"\n\nYan Hui further expounded these three principles. All things, whether noble or base, share the same attainment of life. Thus, whether good or not good, one leaves it to impartial judgment—seeking nothing from others. Following Heaven’s principle, one extends from one’s nature and entrusts it to fate, proceeding as straightforwardly as an infant. Outwardly, the form bends and yields, adapting to what human affairs demand. Success in the present is measured against the past. Though this is common teaching, it carries the essence of admonition and reproof. By lodging uprightness in antiquity, one avoids bringing harm upon oneself.\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas! How can this suffice? There are too many policies and laws, yet they lack harmony. Though one may be steadfast, one remains blameless—but this is all there is to it. How can it ever reach transformation? It is still to follow one’s own mind. The principle admits no duality, yet by enforcing these three measures to govern, one fails to merge with affairs. Though not grand in scope, one may yet avoid censure. Blame may be absent, but transformation is not. Wielding these three methods to suit circumstances is not to act without intention, entrusting all under Heaven to fate.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"I have no further way to advance. I venture to ask for your guidance.\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Purify yourself, and I will tell you. To act with intention—is this easy? Those who deem it easy are unsuited for the vastness of Heaven.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"My family is poor, and for months now I have drunk no wine and eaten no meat. May this be called purification?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"This is the purification for sacrifice, not the purification of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"I venture to ask what the purification of the mind is.\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Unify your will. Do not listen with the ears but listen with the mind; do not listen with the mind but listen with qi. The ears are limited to hearing, the mind to matching signs. Qi is that which is empty and awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the purification of the mind.\"\n\nTo act with intention in the mind is indeed not easy. Those who deem intentional action easy have not seen its fittingness. To discard heterodoxies and rely on singularity—abandon the senses, set aside the mind’s intentions, and accord with the self-attainment of qi and nature: this is to be empty and await things. Empty the mind, and the supreme Dao will gather in your embrace.\n\nYan Hui said, \"Before I had yet received this teaching, there truly was a Yan Hui. Having received it, there has never been a Yan Hui—may this be called emptiness?\"\n\nHe had not yet practiced the purification of the mind, and so his self remained.\n\nThe Master said, \"Perfect! I shall tell you this: if you can enter and wander within its enclosure without being moved by its name, then when it enters, you will respond; when it does not enter, you will cease. Without gate, without governance—abiding in the single dwelling of inevitability—then you are near.\n\nHaving attained the service of the mind’s purification, you will be without self. The realm where the unmoored heart finds itself is where one should stop at the real. It is like the notes of the pentatonic scale: they respond without intention, and thus it is called resonance. To respond without intention is to follow the other without forcing a reply. Let things be as they are—this is to be without gate. Entrusting the world to its natural ease—this is to be without governance. *Du* means to govern. Inevitability is the necessity of principle, the dwelling of utmost singularity that meets the tally of necessity. Principle is exhausted in this.\n\nCutting off tracks is easy; leaving no trace upon the earth is difficult. Being used by others is easy to feign; being used by Heaven is difficult to feign. We have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings; we have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. Behold that empty chamber: in the vacant room, whiteness arises, and auspiciousness comes to rest. If one does not come to rest, this is called sitting in motion. If one follows the ears and eyes, turning inward while abandoning the mind’s knowledge, then even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so men! This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the ultimate course of Fuxi and Jiqu, and how much more so for those who are scattered!\n\nNot acting is easy; to act without treading upon the earth is impossible. Non-doing is easy; to act without harming one’s nature is unattainable. What the eyes and ears grasp is coarse, and thus easily deceived. But the response of spontaneity is subtle, and thus difficult to feign. The less one loses of the real, the less one is incomplete; the more one loses of the real, the more one is incomplete. The recompense for loss and gain has never failed to match its measure. To go against Heaven and feign falsity—is this not difficult?\n\nWords must have their instruments to accomplish their tasks. Now, without the dwelling of utmost emptiness, how can one have the reality of transforming things? To see something as if it were nothing—this is the vacant room. In the vacant room, pure whiteness arises alone. Where auspiciousness gathers is in utmost emptiness and stillness. If one does not rest in what is fitting, does not meet the ultimate, then even in the days of responding while sitting, one races without cease. Thus, the outer enemy has not yet arrived, yet one is already exhausted within—how can one transform things?\n\nIf one closes the ears and eyes and naturally attains, then the mind’s knowledge is externalized. Therefore, to follow one’s nature and move directly, going nowhere without darkness—how could one be burdened by the obscure and hidden, let alone the entanglements of the human world? Things have no nobility or baseness; none fail to communicate through the mind’s knowledge and the ears and eyes. Thus, what the world calls knowledge—is it desired in order to know? What it calls seeing—is it done in order to see? If knowledge and sight could be obtained by desire and effort, then could one desire worthiness and obtain worthiness, or strive for sagehood and attain sagehood? Certainly not.\n\nYet the world does not know that knowledge knows itself, and so seeks to know by desiring knowledge; it does not see that seeing sees itself, and so seeks to see by desiring sight. Not knowing that life lives itself, it then strives to live by contriving life. Thus, seeing the eyes, one demands the clarity of Li Zhu; hearing the ears, one demands the acuity of Shi Kuang. The spirit races within, the ears and eyes are exhausted without, the body is ill at ease, and one is no longer in darkness with things. Not being in darkness, how can one harmonize with the changes of the human world or respond to the rhythms of every generation?\n\nLord Gaogao of Ye was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi. He asked Confucius, saying, 'The king’s charge to me, Zhu Liang, is most weighty. Qi’s treatment of envoys is generally respectful but not urgent. Even a common man cannot be moved—how much less a feudal lord! I am deeply fearful. You once told Zhu Liang: \"In all matters, whether small or great, few do not rely on the Dao to achieve joyful completion. If the matter is not completed, there will surely be the calamity of human judgment; if it is completed, there will surely be the calamity of yin and yang. Only those with virtue can achieve completion or non-completion without calamity.\" My meals are coarse and not refined, and my cook has no desire for coolness. Yet this morning I received the charge, and by evening I am drinking ice—is this not the heat within me? I have not yet reached the truth of the matter, yet I already have the calamity of yin and yang! If the matter is not completed, there will surely be the calamity of human judgment—this is a double burden. As a minister, I am not equal to this task. Please tell me what to do!'\n\nThe weight of the mission is because he seeks something. He fears that Qi will merely return empty respect and not urgently respond to his request. In matters great or small, few fail to achieve joyful completion through words—this is what Confucius once told Zhu Liang. Those who rely on completion for joy will be angered if it is not achieved. This is something even the King of Chu cannot avoid. Though the human calamity may be averted, joy and fear still war in the breast, and ice is already congealed in the five viscera. Only those with virtue can entrust success or failure to the other without troubling the heart!\n\nFacing the fire without thinking of coolness shows the frugality of his fare. That his fare is frugal yet he drinks ice from inner heat is truly due to the difficulty of the matter, not the excellence of the food. Before the matter is completed, he only fears it will not be. If it truly fails, then fear will congeal within, and the net of punishment will spread without.\n\nConfucius said, 'There are two great precepts under Heaven: one is fate, the other is duty. Your love for your parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is nowhere he can go under Heaven that is not his lord, nowhere to escape within the earth.'\"\n\nThese are called the great precepts. Thus, in serving one’s parents, to be at ease without choosing the place is the utmost filial piety; in serving one’s lord, to be at ease without choosing the task is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own heart, sorrow and joy do not alter what lies before it—knowing the inevitable and accepting it as fate is the perfection of virtue.\n\nFor a minister on the brink, there are indeed things he cannot avoid. Acting with the truth of the matter and forgetting himself, how could he have leisure to delight in life and dread death? The Master’s conduct is thus! Naturally bound fast, it cannot be undone.\n\nWhen a thousand gather, if none is taken as master, disorder will lead to dissolution. Thus, many worthy men cannot have many lords, and without worthies there cannot be no lord—this is the Dao of Heaven and man, the inevitable principle. If a lord could be fled and parents untied, there would be no need for precepts.\n\nTo know the inevitable as fate and accept it is to be without sorrow or joy—how could one’s bearing be altered? Thus, in profound obscurity, one takes what one encounters as fate and does not interpose the heart between them, merging utterly with what is most fitting without joy or sorrow within. Even in serving ordinary men, there is nowhere one does not find accord—how much more so with lord and parents!\n\nMatters have their inevitabilities, principles are ever-pervading. Thus, to entrust them is to accomplish them, and where matters are accomplished yet the self is not preserved—such has never been. Why then trouble the heart over the self? Principles are without obstruction, so one should entrust what one encounters and proceed directly.\n\nIf one’s faith in the Dao is not steadfast and likes and dislikes remain in the heart, unable to proceed with what is most fitting while scheming for life and fearing death, I have never seen such a one succeed in his affairs.\n\nLet me repeat what I have heard: In close dealings, trust must be mutually confirmed; in distant dealings, loyalty must be conveyed through words. Words must sometimes be transmitted. To transmit words of twofold joy or twofold anger is the most difficult thing under Heaven.\n\nFor twofold joy invariably produces excessive praise, and twofold anger invariably produces excessive blame. All excess is falsehood; falsehood breeds distrust, and distrust brings calamity to the transmitter. Thus, the model saying goes: *\"Transmit the constant truth, do not transmit excessive words—then you will be nearly whole.\"*\n\nThose near at hand can verify, so their trust is confirmed through direct contact. Those afar must convey intent through words. Words of joy and anger, if they exceed reality, should be transmitted so that neither side loses the mean—hence the difficulty. *Excess* means going beyond. Words of joy and anger always exceed what is fitting. Suspecting the words are not his, one assumes the transmitter fabricates. Distrust arises. If excessive words are transmitted, it seems like wild falsehood. The recipient doubts, and the transmitter is arbitrarily blamed for exaggeration or understatement.\n\nEven if one hears momentary excesses, do not transmit them. Instead, convey the constant truth and capture the sincerity of the intent—then you will be nearly whole.\n\nMoreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin in openness but invariably end in secrecy; when excess prevails, many strange tactics arise. Those who drink wine with ritual begin in order but invariably end in chaos; when excess prevails, many strange pleasures arise. All things are thus: they begin in sincerity but invariably end in baseness. Their inception is simple, but their conclusion must be vast.\n\nWords are like wind and waves; actions are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss are easily imperiled. Thus, anger arises without cause, and artful speech with biased words. When beasts die, they do not choose their cries—gasping and disordered, they give rise to vicious hearts. Scrutiny carried too far must evoke unworthy responses, yet one does not know it is so. If one does not know it is so, who knows where it will end?\n\nThus, the model saying goes: *\"Do not alter commands, do not urge completion. Going beyond is adding to them.\"* Altering commands and urging completion endanger affairs. Beauty takes time to perfect; evil, once done, cannot be undone—can one not be cautious?\n\nOriginally, all enjoyed the game. When the desire to win arises, it secretly gives rise to harming others. No longer following principle, distinctions of rank are lost, and toasts proceed without order. Drunkenness and excess prevail, reaching every extreme. Trouble arises from simplicity, affairs from the minute—this is the inevitable course.\n\nWords are like wind and waves; thus, acting on them is like gain and loss. If one leaves wind and waves unacted upon, then reality is not lost. When affairs attain their reality, danger can be pacified and turmoil settled.\n\nThe arising of anger has no other cause—it always comes from artful words exceeding reality and biased speech missing the mark. Like wild beasts driven into a corner, their cries urgent and their breath spent, harmony does not come, and their breath is disordered. Suddenly enraged, they both give rise to vicious sores in mutual opposition.\n\nTo be broad and accommodate all things, all things will gather to you. Scrutiny carried too far breeds petty and miserly hearts without one’s awareness. Thus, the great man lets things roam freely in the realm of self-attainment, neither begrudging others’ abilities nor exhausting their joy. Therefore, the fellowship of the four seas can be preserved whole.\n\nIf one does not realize this, how can one know where fortune and misfortune equally lead?\n\nTransmit the other’s reality. Entrust its natural completion. Adding to it is not entrusting reality—this endangers affairs. Beauty is completed by entrusting its timely transformation, like planting—it cannot be done in a single morning. To urge completion of what one dislikes is to invite regret and failure.\n\nMoreover, to ride things with the heart and entrust the inevitable to nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there to act in repayment? It is best to deliver one’s mandate—this is the difficult part.\n\nTo lodge the mind in things is to entrust the inevitable course of principle. The fullness of the Mean is thus preserved—this is the utmost in engaging with things. One should entrust the reality of what is to be repaid—why interpose one’s intent in the matter?\n\nDelivering one’s mandate directly is easiest, yet applying joy and anger to the heart makes it difficult.\n\nWhen Yan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei, he asked Qu Boyu, saying: “There is a man here whose virtue is heaven-sent for destruction. If I deal with him without restraint, it will endanger our state; if I deal with him with restraint, it will endanger myself. His knowledge suffices only to recognize others’ faults, not their causes. In such a case, what should I do?”\n\nThe nature of petty men is such that if you guide them by rules, they resent you; if you indulge their excesses, they throw the state into chaos. Unaware that the people’s faults arise from themselves, they blame the people and never reform. Qu Boyu said: “An excellent question! Be on guard, be cautious—rectify yourself! In form, nothing is better than compliance; in heart, nothing is better than harmony. Yet these two have their perils. Compliance must not become submission, harmony must not become display. If in form you comply and submit, you will be overthrown, destroyed, collapse, or stumble. If in heart you harmonize and display yourself, you will become a reputation, a name, an omen, a calamity.\n\nLet him be an infant, and you be an infant with him; let him be without boundaries, and you be without boundaries with him; let him be without limits, and you be without limits with him—thus guiding him to enter flawlessness. Through repeated encounters and convergence, both serve to rectify yourself. In form, do not oppose; in harmony, do not conform. Compliance in form is following; submission is merging with him. Harmony is aided by rightness; display is self-promotion.\n\nIf you merge with him, you will topple and not support him, perishing together. Thus, you must model yourself on heaven and earth, merely avoiding petty distinctions. If you display your harmony, you will earn a reputation for tolerance, but aiding his reputation will make him resent your superiority and recklessly spawn calamities. Therefore, you must remain obscure as if in darkness, blending like dust in light—then you cannot be drawn near or kept distant, cannot be benefited or harmed. Do not set small edges against his scales.\n\nDo you not know the mantis? It brandishes its arms to block a chariot’s wheel, unaware of its incapacity—such is the beauty of its talent. Beware, be cautious! To accumulate your strengths and beauties to challenge him is perilous indeed! The mantis’s brandished arms are not without beauty, yet blocking the chariot’s wheel is simply no match. Now, with knowledge insufficient to cope, you seek to forcefully take on this task—this is the mantis brandishing its arms. To accumulate your talents, boast of your beauties, and challenge this man is the path to danger.\n\nDo you not know those who raise tigers? They dare not feed them living creatures, for fear of their killing rage; they dare not feed them whole creatures, for fear of their rending rage. They time their hunger and satiety, understanding their angry hearts. Tigers and humans are of different kinds, yet tigers fawn on those who raise them—this is compliance. Thus, those they kill are those who oppose them. They fear that a killing intent will provoke rage. If you make the tiger bite and tear its food, it will use force and grow angry. Know the cause of its anger and comply with it. Compliance with principle makes even different kinds grow affectionate; opposition to nature makes even the closest turn to arms.\n\nThose who love horses use baskets to collect their dung and conch shells to collect their urine. Yet if a mosquito or gadfly alights, and they strike it untimely, the horse will break its bit, shatter its chest-plate. Love can reach a point where it causes loss. Can one not be cautious?”\n\nThe dung and urine are most base, yet one uses precious vessels to contain them—this is the utmost in loving horses. Servants bustle about tending to the horse. Though they seek to relieve its distress, they catch the horse unawares. Striking when it is unprepared, they startle it to this extreme. The intent was to remove harm, yet in haste they strike, leading to destruction and breakage, losing the very reason for their love. Thus, in dealing with things in the world, one must be cautious at the juncture of compliance and opposition.\n\nWhen Master Carpenter Shi traveled to Qi, he reached Quyuan and saw an oak that was a sacred tree. Its greatness could shade thousands of oxen; its girth measured a hundred spans. Its height towered over the mountains, and only after rising eighty feet did it bear branches. Those that could be made into boats numbered more than ten at its side. Spectators gathered like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter did not glance at it and continued on his way without pause. His disciple, having gazed his fill, ran to catch up with Master Shi and said, “Since I took up the axe and followed you, Master, I have never seen timber so fine as this. Why do you refuse to look and walk on without stopping?” He replied, “Enough! Say no more. It is but a useless tree.”\n\n\"To use it for a boat would cause it to sink; for a coffin or outer coffin, it would quickly rot; for vessels, it would swiftly break; for doors or windows, it would ooze resin; for pillars, it would be eaten by worms—this is a worthless tree. Having no use, it has thus attained such longevity.\"\n\nNot counted among the useful, it is called a \"scattered tree.\" Master Carpenter Shi returned home, and the sacred oak appeared to him in a dream, saying: \"With what would you compare me? Would you liken me to the so-called 'cultivated trees'? Those such as hawthorns, pears, oranges, and pomelos—the fruits of the vine and melon—once their fruit ripens, they are stripped, and once stripped, they are shamed. Their great branches are broken, their small branches are torn. This is how their abilities bring suffering to their lives. Thus, they do not complete their Heaven-ordained years but perish midway, struck down by the common world. All things are like this.\n\nYet I have sought to be of no use for a long time! Nearly dying, only now have I attained it—this is my great use. If I had been useful, could I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—why would you judge me so? And you, a nearly dead 'scattered man,' how could you understand a 'scattered tree'?\"\n\nAll useful trees are called \"cultivated trees.\" All things harm themselves through their own usefulness. Many have sneered at me, but only you, Master Carpenter Shi, now perceive this. The accumulation of uselessness is the great use for preserving life. If one is useful, one will surely be felled in time.\n\nThis was in jest with Master Carpenter Shi. He awoke and interpreted his dream. His disciple asked: \"If you seek the useless, then why does it serve as a sacred tree?\" He replied: \"Hush! Say no more!\"\n\nIt merely lodges there by chance! It takes this as the scorn of those who do not know it. Had it not become a sacred tree, it would nearly have been felled! Moreover, what it preserves differs from the multitude, yet you compare it by righteousness—is this not far off the mark?\"\n\nHe still suspected that the tree took pride in being a sacred tree, rather than simply seeking the useless. The sacred tree merely came to lodge there—it was not that the tree sought to become one. This tree, then, took the sacred tree as one who did not know it and thus brought disgrace and affliction—how could this be an honor? The tree itself took its uselessness as its use, so even if it were not a sacred tree, it would still ultimately avoid the harm of being felled. It preserved itself by not preserving, while the multitude preserved by preserving. Benefiting others and nurturing things, restraining people from wrongdoing—these are the duties of the sacred tree. But the useless one, serene and unobtrusive, allows all talents to be used; each self-using thing attains its proper place without interference—this is how the useless preserves life. You praise it as a sacred tree—how could it come close to that?\n\nNanbo Ziqi wandered in the hills of Shang and saw a great tree, unlike any other: its shade could shelter a thousand chariots, and travelers sought refuge beneath its foliage. Ziqi said, \"What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary timber!\" Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and unfit for beams or rafters; looking down at its great roots, he saw they were split and could not be made into coffins. Tasting its leaves, his mouth was blistered and wounded; smelling it, he was struck with a madness that lasted three days. Yet its branches provided shade enough to shelter a thousand chariots. Ziqi said, \"This is truly a useless tree, and yet it has grown so vast! Alas, the spirit-like person—such is their uselessness.\"\n\nWhen a ruler is useless to the hundred officials, the hundred officials manage their own affairs: the clear-sighted see for him, the keen-eared hear for him, the wise plan for him, the brave defend for him. What does he do? He remains darkly silent. And when all talents do not lose their proper place, then the useless becomes what all talents ultimately rely upon. Thus, the world delights in exalting him without tiring, riding upon the ten thousand things without harm.\n\n\"In Song there was a place called Jing, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those with trunks the size of an arm’s embrace were felled by those seeking pegs for monkeys; those three or four spans around were felled by those seeking high and famous beams; those seven or eight spans around were felled by the families of nobles and wealthy merchants seeking side planks. Thus, they did not live out their natural years but were cut down midway by axes—this is the calamity of being useful. Therefore, when exorcists release one from misfortune, they discard the ox with a white forehead, the pig with an upturned snout, and the person with hemorrhoids, deeming them inauspicious and unfit for crossing the river. The exorcists know this well—these are what they consider ill omens. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like person regards as the greatest auspice. Those with usefulness cannot help but cling to it. When exorcists perform their rites, they cast aside these three and meticulously select only the finest sacrificial animals before daring to use them. The exorcists, too, know that the useless remain whole. To preserve life is what the world calls auspicious, yet exorcists deem the useless inauspicious and refuse to use them—yet it is precisely through this inauspiciousness that life is preserved, making it the greatest auspice. The spirit-like person, without intention, follows things as they are. Thus, what the world calls the greatest auspice, the spirit-like person does not oppose.\n\nThere was one called Zhili Shu, whose chin was hidden in his navel, his shoulders higher than his head, his topknot pointing to the sky, his five organs above, his thighs beside his ribs. By mending needles and washing clothes, he earned enough to feed himself; by winnowing and sifting grain, he could feed ten people. When the authorities conscripted soldiers, Zhili waved his arms and wandered among them; when great labor was demanded, Zhili, citing his chronic illness, was exempted from service; when the authorities distributed grain to the sick, he received three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. Though his body was deformed, he could still nourish himself and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is deformed! Relying on his uselessness, he did not hide himself. Exempt from corvée labor, he did not serve; when gifts were given, he accepted them. The spirit-like person is of no use to things, yet things each attain their own use, attributing merit and fame to the multitude of talents, merging with things without a trace. Thus, he avoids the harms of the human world, abides in the substance of constant beauty—this is one whose virtue is deformed.\n\nConfucius traveled to Chu, and the madman Jieyu wandered by his gate, singing:\n*Phoenix! Phoenix!*\n*How has virtue declined?*\nOne should follow the times and move forward, fully attaining the harmony of the moment. The rise and fall of the world are too trivial to notice—hence, \"How has it declined?\" The future cannot be awaited; the past cannot be pursued. One must simply do what is fitting in the present. When the world has the Dao, the sage achieves; when the world lacks the Dao, the sage lives. Entrusting oneself to what is so, principle naturally arises. Arising and achieving are not of my doing—how could one change one’s course for order or chaos? Those who seek order pursue achievement, thus abandoning achievement and not failing; those who face chaos seek life, thus forgetting life and not dying. In the present age, one merely avoids punishment. Without looking ahead or behind, one fully meets the present moment, merging darkly with the times to attain perfect harmony, thus preserving oneself and avoiding the names of punishment.\n\nHappiness is lighter than a feather, yet none know how to bear it. Feet can walk—let them roam; hands can grasp—let them hold. Let the ears hear what they hear, the eyes see what they see; know to stop where knowledge ends, and act only where ability lies. Use what is self-using, do what is self-doing, indulge one’s nature without the slightest concern for what lies beyond—this is the utmost ease of non-action.\"\n\nNo one has ever preserved their nature and life through action, nor has anyone whose nature and life were whole not attained good fortune. Thus, good fortune is nothing other than the wholeness of which we spoke earlier—it is not borrowed from external things, so how could it bear the weight of a goose feather? To move in accord with one’s nature, never exceeding its bounds, is the utmost ease in the world. To lift what lifts itself, to bear what bears itself, is the utmost lightness in the world.\n\nYet knowing injures one’s nature by its boundlessness, and the heart disturbs the true by its likes and dislikes. Thus, people abandon this utmost ease of non-action to pursue the utmost difficulty of action, forsaking the utmost lightness of self-lifting to take up the utmost weight of bearing others. This is the common affliction of the world.\n\nDisaster is heavier than the earth, yet none know how to avoid it. If one acts within one’s nature, even bearing ten thousand *jun* brings no sense of weight. If one relies on external things, even a weight no more than a *zhu* may prove unbearable. Acting inwardly is good fortune, and thus good fortune is supremely light. Acting outwardly is disaster, and thus disaster is supremely heavy. That disaster is supremely heavy yet none know how to avoid it—this is the world’s great delusion.\n\nEnough, enough! To govern others with virtue is perilous, perilous! To draw lines on the ground and make others follow them—such traces cannot be concealed. To possess something oneself and then impose it upon things is to fail to merge with them.\n\nThus, the great person does not dazzle others with their own brightness but lets others find their own clarity; they do not impose their virtue upon others but allow others to attain their own virtue. In this way, they pervade and unite the myriad things, darkly merging self and other, indistinctly becoming one with the world, so that inner and outer share the same good fortune.\n\n\"Deluded yang, deluded yang—do not harm my path.\"\n\"Deluded yang\" means lost yang. If one abides in solitude without being swayed by externals, one’s path remains whole.\n\n\"Crooked, crooked—do not harm my feet.\"\nIf one’s conduct is perfectly curved, it is self-sufficient.\n\nMountain trees bring ruin upon themselves; fat is consumed by its own flame. Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled; lacquer is useful, so it is cut. People all know the use of what is useful, but none know the use of what is useless. What is useful serves others’ purposes; what is useless preserves one’s own life. Those who carve their flesh for the world are known to the world. But to allow the people to preserve their wholeness while both self and other find harmony—this is a subtlety so profound that none sense its presence within.\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Zhuangzi, \"Virtue’s Perfect Correspondence\" (Chapter Five):*\n\nIn Lu there was a man named Wang Tai who had lost a foot, yet those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius. His virtue was full within, and things responded to him without; inner and outer merged darkly, so that he trusted his fate as if it were a tally, forgetting his bodily form. His disciples were as many as Confucius’s.\n\nChang Ji asked Confucius, \"Wang Tai is a man who has lost a foot, yet those who follow him divide Lu equally with you. He stands without teaching, sits without discussing. Those who go to him empty return full.\"\n\nHad there not been a teaching beyond words, a shaping of the heart without form? What manner of man is this? Each finds sufficiency in himself. Yet it is strange that though his form is maimed, his heart is full. When the heart is whole, it leaves the body behind, forgets the five viscera, and wanders alone—none under heaven can part from it.\n\nConfucius said, \"This Master is a sage. I am but a latecomer who has not yet gone to him! I shall take him as my teacher—how much more should those who are not my equal! Why limit it to Lu? I shall lead all under heaven to follow him.\" When spirit is whole and the heart complete, the body merges with things. One who merges with things cannot be distanced by all under heaven—how could it be merely one state?\n\nChang Ji said, \"He is a man who has lost a foot, yet he surpasses the common run by far. If this is so, how does he employ his heart uniquely?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Life and death are great indeed, yet he does not change with them. Though heaven and earth collapse, he will not be lost with them. He examines what is without reliance and does not shift with things; he commands the transformations of things while guarding their root.\" Though people change daily, the change of life and death is the greatest of changes. He moves with change, so life and death do not alter him. This is following it. It is understanding the constancy of nature and fate, taking transformation as fate without opposition, never departing from the ultimate rightness.\n\nChang Ji said, \"What does this mean?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Viewed from what makes them different, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from what makes them the same, the myriad things are all one. One who is like this does not know what the ears and eyes deem fitting but roams the heart in the harmony of virtue. He sees what things share and does not see what they lose; he regards the loss of a foot as discarding dirt.\"\n\nWhen the nature of pleasure and suffering differs, the feelings of beauty and ugliness diverge. Though what is deemed beautiful varies, all share in having something beautiful. Each deems beautiful what it deems beautiful, so the myriad things are one in beauty. Each affirms what it affirms, so all under heaven is one in affirmation. If one distinguishes things by their differences, then nothing under heaven is not different. Yet one who gazes with vast clarity governs heaven and earth, contains the myriad things, and knows that differences are not truly different. Thus, by following what is shared, nothing under heaven is not the same. Knowing further that sameness is not truly possessed, by following what is without, right and wrong, beauty and ugliness—nothing is not without.\n\nTo affirm oneself and negate others, to find beauty in oneself and ugliness in others—from those of middling understanding down to crawling insects, none are not thus. Yet this is merely clarity about oneself and not clarity about others. As for those of profound penetration and merging, they use all under heaven to illuminate all under heaven. If all under heaven says, 'I am not,' then it illuminates that there is nothing not so. If it says, 'That is right,' then it illuminates that there is nothing right. Without right and without wrong, all blends into one. Thus, one can ride change and follow transformation, oppose things without fear. Having forgotten all that is fitting, nothing is not entrusted. To entrust all and not attain—this has never been. To attain all and not be in harmony—this too has never been heard of. Therefore, the heart is released into the space of the Dao and virtue, drifting without anything amiss, vast and without anything unsuitable.\n\nEmbodying the wondrous heart of the utmost principle, one can be without difference from any thing. Without difference from any thing, then in life and death, change and transformation, there is nowhere that is not oneself. Thus, life is my time, death is my following; time is my gathering, following is my scattering. Though gathering and scattering differ, I am always myself. Thus, life is merely my moment—there has never been gain. Death too is myself—there has never been loss. The change of life and death is but one. Having seen its oneness, one sheds all ties, darkly merging self and other, taking life and death as waking and sleeping, the bodily form as an inn. Departing life is like removing sandals, severing a foot like discarding dirt—I have never seen anything that could entangle his heart.\n\nChang Ji said, \"He cultivates himself. Through his knowledge, he attains his heart; through his heart, he attains his constant heart. What can things do to surpass him?\"\n\nWang Tai was suspected of not having forgotten knowledge to preserve himself, of not having relinquished the heart to attain self-possession. Yet to attain one’s constant heart is to be level in one’s comings and goings. The suspicion was that he could not remain level in his comings and goings when encountering things, and thus constantly compelled things to come to him.\n\nConfucius said, \"No one mirrors themselves in flowing water, but in still water. Only stillness can still the many that seek stillness. Rooted in earth, only the pine and cypress stand upright, ever green through winter and summer. Rooted in heaven, only Yao and Shun stand upright, at the head of all things. Fortunate to have rectified their lives, they rectify the lives of all. The proof of preserving one’s beginning lies in fearlessness—one brave warrior can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and can bind themselves to it are already thus, let alone those who govern heaven and earth, store all things, merely lodge in the six senses, take ears and eyes as mere images, unite knowledge with what is known, and whose hearts have never died! He will choose a day to ascend on high, and people will follow him as a matter of course. How would he deign to make things his concern?\"\n\nThe stillness of water that allows it to serve as a mirror is not stillness sought for the sake of mirroring. Thus, when Wang Tai gathered a following, the people came to him of their own accord—how could he have drawn them to follow him? If he had acted to make it so, he could not have abided in the stillness of all things. The pine and cypress are uniquely endowed with the qi of nature’s harmony, and thus stand as the finest of trees—not because they acted to attain it. Those who uniquely receive the upright qi of nature are exceedingly rare: below, only the pine and cypress; above, only the sages. Thus, all that are not upright come seeking rectification. If all things were whole and green, the pine and cypress would hold no distinction; if all people were self-rectified, none would admire the great sage and hasten to him. Fortunate to be upright of themselves, they do not rectify in order to rectify others. They do not relinquish fame yet bear all things without constraint, darkly embodying all without exception. This is what is meant by \"an inn.\" People use ears and eyes, yet they do not depend on ears and eyes. When knowledge moves with transformation, there is nowhere it does not darkly merge—this is the oneness of knowledge. When the heart flows with life and death, there is no time that is not life—this is the heart that has never died. To choose is merely to avoid losing the meeting; such a person makes no choices, but follows heaven’s course and moves with the times. Thus, those who borrow from him are led to esteem him. His serenity preserves his wholeness.\n\nShentu Jia, a man without feet, studied alongside Zichan of Zheng under Bohun Wuren. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I stay.\" The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I stay. Now I am about to go out—can you stay? Or not? Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not avoid him. Do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?\" He was ashamed to walk alongside one without feet. Pressing the matter, he sought to ensure Shentu Jia would not walk beside him. Always prizing his own position, he bluntly declared Shentu Jia equal to the one in power, as if this alone proved his insolence.\n\nShentu Jia said, \"In the Master’s gate, are there truly those in power like this? You delight in your position and put others after yourself. I have heard: ‘When a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if it settles, it is not bright. Long dwelling with the worthy leaves no faults.’ Now, what you take as greatest is the Master, yet you still speak thus—is this not a fault?\" This was a discussion of virtue, not a calculation of rank. He mocked Zichan’s pride in his position, his desire to precede others. To serve a clear teacher yet retain such a stingy heart—this was the true fault.\n\nZichan said, \"Given your condition, you still contend with Yao in goodness. By your virtue, are you not sufficient to reflect on yourself?\" He meant that with such a maimed form, Shentu Jia did not examine himself but instead slighted those in power, comparing himself to the virtuous. By his virtue, he was not enough to make up for the fault of his maimed form.\n\nShentu Jia said, \"Those who describe their faults, claiming they should not have lost what they lost, are many; those who do not describe their faults, claiming they should not have kept what they kept, are few. Knowing there is nothing to be done and accepting it as fate—only those with virtue can do this. Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow: the center is the mark, yet missing it is fate. Many with whole feet mock my incomplete feet; I bristled with anger, but when I came to the Master’s place, I turned back, at peace. Did the Master wash me with goodness? Or did I awaken myself? I have wandered with you for nineteen years, yet you have never known I was without feet. Now you wander with me within the form, yet seek me outside the form—is this not a fault?\" He often recounted his own faults, claiming many believed he should not have lost what he lost.\n\nYi was a master archer of ancient times. Wherever his bow and arrows reached was called the \"drawn bow’s range.\" When profit and harm contend, the world becomes a field of archers like Yi. Those who do not abandon themselves, forget knowledge, and flow with things—all wander within Yi’s drawn bow. Even if one ventures forth like Zhang Yi or dwells in seclusion like Shan Bao, they cannot escape the mark; whether one hits or misses it depends solely on fate. Yet each clings to their own encounters, unaware that fate unfolds of itself. Thus, those who escape harm from bow and arrow deem themselves skillful, rejoicing in their superiority. But when they cannot escape, they blame their own errors, grieving in spirit and shame—such are those who fail to grasp the nature of fate.\n\nOur lives are not of our own making. Within a single lifetime, across a hundred years, all our sitting and rising, moving and pausing, inclinations and aversions, emotions and abilities—all that we possess, all that we lack, all that we do, all that we encounter—are not truly ours; they arise by principle alone. To impose joy and sorrow upon this is to go against nature and lose the Way. All such mockery stems from ignorance of fate.\n\nSeeing the perfected one’s knowledge of fate and abandonment of form, he cast aside his former anger and returned to equilibrium. Was it because the Master cleansed me with the virtuous Dao? Or was I able to reflect upon myself? Thus, he forgot his form and shed his burdens. For when form is forgotten, virtue resides within. Now you wander with me in virtue, not in bodily form, yet you seek my outward adornments—is this not a fault?\n\nZi Chan, struck with realization, changed his expression and said, \"Say no more!\" Having awakened, he grew weary of excessive words.\n\nThe heel is the cheek. In Lu there was a man named Shushan Wuzhi who had lost his toes; he came to see Confucius by dragging his heels. Confucius said, \"You were not careful, and previously you suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?\"\n\nWhen a person is born, the principle arises of itself. Simply do nothing and let it grow naturally—this is to value the body and know one’s duty. If one forgets this natural arising, becomes cautious, and acts with self-importance, this is to use the body lightly and fail to know one’s duty. Thus, the five organs attack one another within, and hands and feet are maimed without.\n\nWuzhi said, \"I only failed to know my duty and used my body lightly, which is why I lost my foot. Now that I have come, what remains of what I valued still exists, so I strive to preserve it whole. Heaven covers all without exception; Earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like Heaven and Earth—how could I have known you would still be like this?\"\n\nTo cast aside self-importance and caution, to let life unfold naturally—this is to strive for wholeness. To reproach another for lack of care is to fall short of Heaven and Earth.\n\nConfucius said, \"I am indeed narrow-minded! Sir, why not come in? Please share what you have heard.\"\n\nHearing what he had heard, he departed, preserving his non-action. Wuzhi left.\n\nConfucius said, \"Disciples, take heed! Though Wuzhi is maimed, he still strives to study and remedy his past misdeeds—how much more should one of whole virtue do so!\"\n\nOne of whole virtue is born and forgets life. Wuzhi said to Lao Dan, \"Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he persist in treating you as a teacher with such earnestness? He seeks to be known for marvels, uncanny illusions, and strange wonders, unaware that the perfected person regards these as his own shackles.\"\n\nHe found it strange that Confucius should again study under Lao Dan. One without attachment learns as others learn. Yet the ancients studied for themselves, while those of today study for others—this flaw has led them to act as others act.\n\nOne who teaches others to attain self-realization follows what is constant; one who abandons the self to imitate others and chases externals seeks an extraordinary reputation. Such extraordinary reputation arises from what is constant.\n\nThus, study is not for the sake of marvels, yet marvels inevitably arise from study. Ritual is not for the sake of ornate display, yet ornate display inevitably arises from ritual. This is the necessary principle, which the perfected person can do nothing about—hence he regards it as his shackles.\n\nLao Dan said, \"Why not simply lead him to see life and death as a single thread, the permissible and impermissible as one continuum, and thus free him from his shackles? Would that be possible?\"\n\nHe wished to guide him directly to the obscure truth, hoping to leave no trace.\n\nWu Zhi said, \"Heaven has punished him—how can it be undone!\"\n\nNow, Confucius was not without profound insight. Yet by the natural principle, where there is movement, a shadow follows; where there are words, echoes respond. To comply with things is to establish a name and trace, though one who complies with things does not act for the sake of name. Not acting for the sake of name is perfection, yet one cannot ultimately escape name—who then can free himself from it? Thus, name is the shadow and echo; shadow and echo are the shackles of form and sound. When this principle is understood, name and trace may be discarded. When name and trace may be discarded, attachment to externals may be severed. When attachment to externals may be severed, one’s nature and life may be preserved whole.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, \"In Wei there is an ugly man named Ai Taituo. When men dwell with him, they grow attached and cannot leave; when women see him, they plead with their parents, saying, 'Rather than be another man’s wife, I would be his concubine'—and this has happened more than ten times without cease. He has never been heard to initiate, only to harmonize with others. He holds no lordly position to save others from death, no wealth to fill others’ bellies; moreover, his ugliness startles the world. He harmonizes but does not initiate, his wisdom does not extend beyond his immediate sphere, yet men and women alike flock to him—there must be something extraordinary about him. I summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness startled the world. When he dwelt with me, before a month had passed, I took notice of his character; before a year had elapsed, I trusted him. As the state had no chief minister, I offered him the governance. He responded with reluctance, as if declining; I felt ashamed, yet in the end I entrusted him with the state. Soon after, he left me and departed. I grieved as though I had suffered a loss, as though there were no one left to share the joy of ruling this state. What manner of man is he?\"\n\nUgliness is but outward deformity. Yet all things flock to him not by force or favor. They come not seeking sustenance, nor drawn by comeliness of form. No summons brings them, no calculation beyond their nature guides them. One whose talents are whole harms nothing in the world: entering the herd, he does not disturb the beasts; joining the flock, he does not scatter the birds. Thus he becomes a refuge for the ten thousand things.\n\nBefore a month had passed, his profound depth was already perceived. Entrusted with the governance of the state, neither favor nor disgrace could unsettle his spirit. When others declined, he too declined.\n\nConfucius said: \"Once, while traveling in Chu, I saw young boars nursing from their dead mother. After a moment’s gaze, they abandoned her and fled. They saw not themselves in her, nor recognized their kind. What they loved in their mother was not her form, but that which animated her form. When warriors fall in battle, their burials are not adorned with military regalia; when a man’s feet are severed, his shoes are no longer cherished. In both cases, the root is lost. The consorts of the Son of Heaven are chosen without cutting their nails or piercing their ears; once wed, they are not sent on further errands. If even bodily wholeness suffices to command such reverence, how much more one whose virtue is whole!\"\n\nNow, Aitai Tu never spoke yet was trusted, achieved nothing yet was cherished, was offered a state yet feared only that he might refuse—surely he is one whose talents are whole and whose virtue remains unmanifest.\"\n\nThey nursed from her milk. The living are drawn to their kind by talent and virtue; when these depart in death, the living flee, having lost their kind. Thus one whose inner power is profound resembles a newborn babe: wherever he goes, all treat him as an infant, and none in the world would harm him. This is because he retains his kind and reveals his true nature. If the heart shares a kindred nature, even dissimilar forms will not provoke hostility; if that nature is lost, even forms as close as mother and child cannot secure the bond.\n\nThat which animates the form is talent and virtue. Military regalia are the trappings of valor; when a warrior dies in battle, valor is gone—where then should regalia be placed? Shoes are cherished for the sake of the feet; when the feet are lost, the shoes are no longer loved. Both lose their root. The Son of Heaven’s consorts remain unaltered in body, and once wed, they are not sent away, for their bodily wholeness is preserved. How much more revered is one whose virtue is whole!\n\nDuke Ai asked: \"What is meant by *talents whole*?\"\nConfucius replied: \"Life and death, survival and ruin, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate before us day and night, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginnings. Thus they should not disturb inner harmony nor enter the sacred chamber of the mind. Let them flow smoothly without obstruction, never departing from joy. Let day and night be seamless, so that the heart ever abides in springtime, meeting all things with the vitality of the season. This is what is called *talents whole*.\"\n\nThe principle is inherently right—it cannot be escaped. Thus, human life is no mistake; what life possesses is no delusion. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things numerous, what I encounter is precisely this—even the gods of heaven and earth, the sages of the state, could not alter it with all their strength and wisdom. Therefore, what one does not encounter cannot be encountered; what one encounters cannot but be encountered. What one does not do cannot be done; what one does cannot but be done. Entrust it to fate, and it will naturally be fitting.\n\nFate moves, affairs change, ceaselessly day and night, pressing forward without retreat, lingering without pause. Thus, one whose talents are whole follows what is encountered and entrusts it to fate. The beginning cannot be fathomed by knowledge, nor can the past be detained by emotion. Therefore, those who understand that fate must unfold and affairs must change—how could they scheme for the end or cling to the new and long for the old? Even with the utmost wisdom, they cannot fathom it. The past has gone—what can I do about it? If one knows that nature and fate are inherently right, then though life and death, poverty and success shift in a thousand transformations, one remains serene and at ease, harmony and principle abiding within.\n\nThe *spirit’s abode* is the dwelling of the essence. The perfectly content do not let cares and troubles disturb their spirit—they pass by like something external. If one’s harmonious nature remains undisturbed and the spirit’s abode is at ease, then though one traverses the greatest changes, one does not lose their joy. Silently, one entrusts all to fate. This is what the myriad beings rely upon, transforming together with the four seasons.\n\n\"What is meant by *virtue not manifest*?\"\n\"The level is the fullness of still water. It can serve as a model: inwardly preserved, outwardly undisturbed. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. *Virtue not manifest* means things cannot depart from it.\"\n\nThere is no greater levelness in the world than still water. Utterly impartial, it is the standard by which all under heaven aligns. When affairs are accomplished and things are harmonized, this is called *virtue*. When no affair fails to be accomplished and no thing fails to be harmonized, this is *virtue not manifest*. Thus, all under heaven delight in exalting it without tiring.\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Minzi: \"At first, I thought that facing south as ruler of all under heaven, holding the people’s guiding principles and worrying over their deaths, I was supremely enlightened. Now, hearing the words of the perfected person, I fear I lack their substance, have lightly used my person, and lost my state. I and Kong Qiu are not ruler and subject—we are friends in virtue!\"\n\nThose who hear of the wind of *virtue whole*—even Duke Ai—would wish to cast off their bodily form and forget nobility and baseness.\n\nYin Qi, the hunchbacked, lipless man, persuaded Duke Ling of Wei, who was so pleased that he compared whole-bodied men and found their necks too slender. The man with a great goiter persuaded Duke Huan of Qi, who was so pleased that he compared whole-bodied men and found their necks too slender. Thus, virtue has its excellence, and form has what may be forgotten. If one does not forget what should be forgotten but forgets what should not be forgotten, this is called *true forgetting*.\n\nPartial emotion, once set in one direction, makes the ugly seem fine and the fine seem ugly. If one’s virtue excels in following things, things forget their ugliness; if it excels in opposing things, things forget their fineness. Living, they are loved; dead, they are discarded. Thus, virtue is what the world does not forget; form is what principle does not retain. Therefore, to forget form is not true forgetting; to forget virtue while clinging to form—that is *true forgetting*.\n\nThus, the sage wanders freely, yet knowledge becomes a snare, covenants become glue, virtue becomes a bond, craft becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme—what use is knowledge? Does not carve—what use is glue? Has no loss—what use is virtue? Does not trade—what use is commerce? These four are the *heavenly nourishment*. *Heavenly nourishment* is the *heavenly sustenance*. Having received sustenance from heaven, what need is there for man?\n\nOne has the form of a human but not the emotions of a human. Having the form of a human, one mingles with others; lacking human emotions, right and wrong do not adhere to one’s person. How small—this by which one belongs to humanity! How great—this by which one alone completes one’s heaven! Wandering in the realm of self-attainment, released without fail—this is *talents and virtue whole*. These four arise naturally from one another; their principle is already complete. Since it is naturally complete, the sage has no use for their own efforts. Words arise from nature and are endowed by it. Once endowed by nature, its principle is sufficient. Thus, though one may ponder deeply to avoid difficulty or clearly admonish to evade misfortune, nothing happens without reason—all are the convergence of heaven and earth, the direction of the supreme principle. What must be pondered is not my pondering; what must not be pondered is not my not pondering. Some ponder and avoid it; some ponder and do not avoid it; some do not ponder and avoid it; some do not ponder and do not avoid it. All this is not of me—what is there to do? Entrust it, and it comes of itself.\n\nTheir appearance is like that of a human. Like gathers with like, kind separates from kind—this is the Dao of nature. Without emotion, one entrusts all to things. Their appearance is like that of a human. Without emotion, they are vast and unburdened by anything. To be unburdened by anything is what those with emotions cannot achieve—thus, without emotion, one alone completes heaven.\n\nThus, virtue has its excellence, and form has what may be forgotten. If one does not forget what should be forgotten but forgets what should not be forgotten, this is called *true forgetting*.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi: \"Are humans truly without emotion?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"Yes.\"\nHuizi said: \"If a human has no emotion, how can they be called human?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"The Dao gives them their appearance, heaven gives them their form—how can they not be called human?\"\n\nHuman life is not born of emotion.\n\nWhat life knows—how could it be what emotion knows? Thus, those with emotion strive for detachment and vastness yet cannot achieve it, while detachment and vastness are attained through freedom from emotion. Those with emotion strive to become worthy and sagely yet cannot achieve it, while the worthy and sagely become so through freedom from emotion. Is it merely that the worthy and sagely are utterly remote, and detachment and vastness are difficult to emulate? Even the dullest, the deaf, the blind, the crowing of roosters, the barking of dogs—though they may have emotion in their striving, they ultimately cannot succeed. Whether distant or near, even if separated by but a hair’s breadth, in the space between brow and eye, they can never attain it. Thus, when the myriad things are considered, one returns to the self: ears and eyes cannot substitute for one another to accomplish their tasks, nor can hands and feet take over one another’s duties to achieve their work.\n\nWhen an infant first comes into the world, it does not seek milk with its eyes, nor turn its ears toward light, nor grasp objects with its feet, nor crawl with its hands. How could it be that the hundred limbs lack fixed offices, that the bodily form has no inherent master, and that emotion alone governs them? Huizi said: \"If one is called human, how can they be without emotion?\" He did not understand that the bodily form is not of emotion. Zhuangzi said: \"This is not what I mean by emotion. What I call freedom from emotion is that one does not internally harm the body with likes and dislikes, but constantly follows nature without adding to life.\" If right and wrong are taken as emotion, then one without right or wrong, without likes or dislikes—though possessing bodily form—is merely human in name; where then could emotion reside? Proceeding directly where it is fitting, without deviation—this is not emotion. Stopping where it is fitting—this too is not emotion.\n\nHuizi said: \"If one does not augment life, how can they possess a body?\"\nHe did not understand that life generates itself, and principle suffices of itself.\n\nZhuangzi said: \"The Dao bestows its appearance, Heaven bestows its form—do not internally harm the body with likes and dislikes.\nNow you estrange your spirit, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree chanting, rest upon a withered catalpa in slumber.\nHeaven has selected this form, yet you clamor about ‘hard and white.’\"\n\nThe principle of life is already self-sufficient within form and appearance; simply follow it, and the body endures.\nThe emotions of likes and dislikes do not augment life but only suffice to harm the body, for life has its allotted portion.\nIf the spirit does not rest within the bounds of its nature, it becomes estranged; if essence does not halt at the limit of self-generation, it becomes exhausted.\nThus, when walking, one leans against a tree chanting; when sitting, one rests upon a catalpa sleeping—this speaks of the self-entrapment of those with emotion.\nIt means that all your actions—estranging the spirit, exhausting essence, leaning against trees, resting upon catalpas, chanting and sleeping—are what the world calls emotion.\nYet to say it is ‘Heaven’s selection’ makes clear that what is called emotion does not arise from emotion—how much less anything else!\nThus, though the myriad things and myriad forms, their activities and preferences, all arise within the absence of emotion, what use is emotion between them?\"\n\n---\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Zhuangzi, \"The Great Master\" (Chapter Six)*\n\nTo know what Heaven does and what man does—this is perfection!\nTo know what Heaven does is to be born of Heaven; to know what man does is to use what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the fullness of knowledge.\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast and the myriad things abundant, what they honor and take as master is without intention.\n\nTo know what Heaven and man do is to know that all is natural.\nThus, one inwardly releases the body and outwardly\n\nThus, though they do not regard heat as heat, they never rush into fire; though they do not regard wetness as wetness, they never tread into water; though they do not regard death as death, they never lose their lives. For life—does it live itself into being? For completion—does it complete itself into completion? Therefore, one who entrusts all to the natural and arrives at all without exception is a true person. How could they impose fixed intentions upon what they encounter?\n\nThe true persons of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the breath of ordinary people reaches only the throat. Those who are cramped and submissive choke on their words as if retching. The deeper one’s cravings and desires, the shallower one’s Heavenly mechanism. They harbor no deliberate thoughts, content with whatever they encounter. What is proper to eat is simply eaten—this arises from the root. When qi is not balanced and flowing, one must deeply root and settle to the utmost, only then returning to oneness and desirelessness.\n\nThe true persons of old did not delight in life nor detest death. They did not rejoice at departure nor resist return. They came and went with effortless ease, neither forgetting their origin nor seeking their end. They received and rejoiced in it, forgot and returned to it—this is called not harming the Dao with the heart, not aiding Heaven with human effort. This is the true person, one who embodies transformation. Serene and entrusting all to the natural, they lodge in the utmost principle, thus coming and going without difficulty. Beginning and end, change and transformation—all are forgotten. How could they merely reverse forgetfulness of life while still probing the meaning of death? They do not question what they receive; whatever they encounter, they find it fitting. Their return is not by way of recognition—it is the utmost.\n\nAt birth, humans are tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature. Moved by things, they stir—this is the desire of nature. When the things that move people are endless and human pursuit of desire knows no bounds, then Heavenly principle is extinguished. The true person knows that using the heart turns one from the Dao, and aiding Heaven harms life, so they do not act thus. Such a one’s heart is forgotten, their countenance still, their brow serene. Chill as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger flow with the four seasons, harmonizing with things yet no one knows their limit. Where they dwell, they settle into their will. Though they act, they do not disrupt their tranquility.\n\nTheir brow serene—this is the appearance of great simplicity. To kill is not for the sake of might. Those who embody the Dao and accord with change share the warmth and severity of cold and heat, yet never hold it in mind. Still, they bear the semblance of warmth and severity, the rhythm of life and death, so we ascribe to them joy and anger. Without intent toward things, they do not violate what is fitting for them; with nothing unfitting, none know their limit.\n\nThus the sage in waging war may overthrow a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. Beneficence flows through ten thousand generations, yet not from love of others. One who delights in connecting with things is no sage; one who has favorites is not humane; one who follows the seasons is not worthy; one who does not penetrate benefit and harm is no gentleman; one who acts for fame yet loses the self is no scholar; one who destroys the self yet is not true is no servant of others.\n\nLike those such as Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these serve the service of others, follow the fitting of others, yet do not follow their own fitting. They cause the fall of what the people’s hearts desire to fall, thus they do not lose the people’s hearts. The bright sun ascends the sky, illuminating the six directions—this is not from love of others.\n\nThus the sage abiding in the world is warm as the spring sun’s self-harmony, so those who receive its moisture do not give thanks; chill as the autumn frost’s self-descent, so those who wither do not bear resentment. The sage has no joy—simply nothing obstructs, and things naturally flow. Utmost benevolence has no favorites, entrusting principle to preserve itself. One who follows Heaven’s timing does not compare to one who forgets timing and naturally accords with it. Unable to unify the paths of right and wrong and pursue benefit while avoiding harm, one injures virtue and burdens what is fitting.\n\nA true scholar abandons fame and attains the self, so fame matches reality and fortune responds to the person. Losing one’s nature and forcing compliance with things brings much servitude—how can one serve others? These all abandon the self to imitate others, following them to harm the self.\n\nThe true person of old bore righteousness yet did not form cliques, seemed insufficient yet did not submit; was angular yet not rigid, expansive in emptiness yet not ostentatious; seemed joyful, compelled as if by necessity, rich in bestowing countenance, restraining with virtue, broad as if worldly, towering and uncontrollable, connected as if fond of seclusion, forgetful of words.\n\nTaking punishment as the body, ritual as wings, knowledge as timing, and virtue as the path: taking punishment as the body is the ease of execution; taking ritual as wings is how one moves through the world; taking knowledge as timing is acting only when unavoidable; taking virtue as the path means accompanying those with feet to the hill, yet others truly believe them to be diligent in conduct.\n\nThus what they like is one, what they dislike is one. Their oneness is one, their non-oneness is one. Their oneness joins them with Heaven; their non-oneness joins them with others. Heaven and others do not overcome one another—this is called the true person. They accord with things yet form no factions.\n\nEmpty and without excess, as if insufficient; yielding yet nothing is not elevated, seeming insufficient yet not submitting. They wander alone yet do not cling. Vast and without attachment, they reach fulfillment. The utmost person has no joy, yet flows in harmony, thus seems joyful. In movement and stillness, action and rest, they always dwell in the utmost of necessity, not allowing things to harm the self. They have no direction.\n\nThe utmost person has no harm, moving with the world, thus seems harmful. Lofty and self-content, far-reaching and profound, none see their gate. Unknowing and unperceiving, Heaven’s mechanism moves of itself, thus they are forgetful of words. Ritual is how the world moves itself—it is not of my making. Knowledge is the movement of the times—it is not of my initiation. Virtue is what others follow—it is not of my creation.\n\nEntrusting governance to its natural execution, thus though it kills, it is lenient. Following what the world does, thus nothing is not done. High and low receive one another—this is an irreversible flow; small and great form groups. This is the momentum of necessity. Vast and without emotion, it is the repository of all knowledge.\n\nBearing the convergence of a hundred streams, dwelling at the teacher of people’s utmost—what is there to do? Entrusting to the world’s knowledge, committing to what must be, yielding to the world alone. The hill is the root; speaking of nature, it is nature’s root. Things each have what is sufficient, sufficient in the root. Entrusting to the self-following of all virtues, this accompanies those with feet to the root. When the root is reached, principle is exhausted.\n\nAll this is completed by others, not by oneself. Thus though dwelling at the utmost of ten thousand affairs, one is always at leisure and self-content, suddenly unaware of affairs passing through the body, forgetful of words in the mouth. Yet people’s great delusion is truly believing the utmost person to be diligent in conduct.\n\nAlways without intent and following others, thus liking and disliking, approving and disapproving, are no different from others. Their oneness is Heaven’s companion; their non-oneness is others’ companion. The true person unites Heaven and humanity, equalizes self and other, not allowing their oneness to differ from non-oneness. Having nothing that is not one—this is Heaven. The true person unites Heaven and humanity, levels the myriad outcomes. The myriad outcomes do not oppose one another; Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another. Thus they are vast and without non-oneness, dark and without absence, mysteriously one with others.\n\nDeath and life are fate; their constancy of night and day is Heaven. What humans cannot partake in are all the conditions of things. They take Heaven as father and still love the self—how much more that which transcends!\n\nMan merely takes having a lord as better than himself, yet still dies for him—how much more that which is true! The constancy of day and night is the Dao of Heaven. Thus to know that death and life are the ultimate of fate, not some random occurrence, is like night and day—what is there to cling to? The true person in daytime gains day, in nighttime gains night. Taking death and life as day and night—how could there be anything unattained! That humans have what they cannot attain and harbor sorrow or joy in their hearts is merely the condition of things, not principle. The transcendent is called \"solitary transformation.\" The achievement of mutual dependence is not as great as the perfection of solitary transformation. Thus what humans depend upon is Heaven; what Heaven gives birth to is solitary transformation. All take Heaven as father, so even the changes of day and night, the seasons of cold and heat, they dare not resent, but follow Heaven and find peace in it. How much more the transcendent solitary transformation, reaching the realm of profound darkness—how could one not entrust oneself to it! Having entrusted oneself, then death and life, transformation, only follow fate.\n\nThat which is true borrows nothing from things but is natural. The unavoidability of the natural—how could it be merely the command of a lord! When a spring dries up, fish find themselves together on land, blowing moisture on one another, moistening one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, better to forget both and transform through the Dao. Rather than loving one another in insufficiency, how much better to have abundance and forget one another! Praise and blame both arise from insufficiency. Thus the utterly sufficient forgets good and evil, leaves behind death and life, unites with transformation, vast and without obstruction.\n\nHiding a boat in a ravine, hiding a mountain in a marsh—one calls this secure! Yet in the dead of night, a strong man carries it away, and the deluded do not know. Hiding the small and large as is fitting still allows for escape. But to hide the world within the world and find no escape—this is the great truth of things. Merely possessing a human form and still delighting in it—if the human form is but one encounter among ten thousand transformations, never beginning or ending, how could its joy be measured? Thus the sage roams where things cannot escape and all are preserved. Excelling in early death, excelling in old age, excelling in beginning, excelling in end—people still emulate this, how much more that to which the myriad things are tied, that upon which the one transformation depends!\n\nForm, birth, aging, death—all are I. Thus form carries me, birth labors me, aging rests me, death gives me repose. Though these four change, they have never ceased to be I—why should I惜 them? Death and life are both fate. Without goodness, there is death; with goodness, there is life—not goodness alone. If one takes my life as good, then my death is also good. Speaking of the inescapability of death, life, and transformation, one first presents the ultimate of inescapability, then clarifies it with the sign of inevitable change, to entrust oneself to transformation without attachment.\n\nThe power of powerlessness is greatest in transformation. Thus it lifts Heaven and Earth to pursue the new, shoulders mountains and ridges to discard the old. Without the slightest pause, in an instant it has traversed the new—thus Heaven and Earth, the myriad things, have no time when they do not shift. The world is all new, yet one takes it as old; the boat changes daily, yet one sees it as before; the mountain alters daily, yet one sees it as the same. Now one clasps an arm and loses it—all has departed in darkness. Thus the I of a moment ago is no longer the I of now. I and the present both pass away—how could one constantly guard the old! Yet the world does not perceive this, stubbornly claiming that what one encounters now can be tied down and retained—how deluded!\n\nHaving nothing to hide and entrusting all, one is without obstruction in things, without division in transformation. Thus there is no outer, no inner, no death, no life, embodying Heaven and Earth and uniting with transformation—seeking escape yet finding none. This is the great truth of constant existence, not some partial, minor intention. The human form is but one encounter among ten thousand transformations—insufficient to delight in alone. Within the boundless, what one encounters is all like the human form—how could only the human form be delightful while other things have no joy!\n\nThe Dao has essence and trustworthiness, is without action and without form; it can be transmitted but not received, can be attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted, existing before Heaven and Earth, enduring since ancient times. It spiritually empowers ghosts and gods, gives birth to Heaven and Earth. Before the Great Ultimate, it is not high; below the Six Poles, it is not deep. Before Heaven and Earth were born, it was not long-lasting; older than high antiquity, it is not aged. Fu Xi obtained it to grasp Heaven and Earth; Fuxi obtained it to inherit the Mother of Qi; the Northern Dipper obtained it and never errs; the sun and moon obtained it and never cease; Kanpi obtained it to inherit Kunlun; Feng Yi obtained it to roam great rivers; Jian Wu obtained it to dwell in great mountains; the Yellow Emperor obtained it to ascend the cloudy heavens; Zhuan Xu obtained it to dwell in the Dark Palace; Yu Qiang obtained it to stand at the North Pole; the Queen Mother of the West obtained it to sit in Shaoguang, knowing neither beginning nor end; Peng Zu obtained it, reaching from the time of Youyu to the Five Hegemons; Fu Yue obtained it to assist Wu Ding, encompassing the world, riding the Eastern Ridge and the Tail of the Winnowing Basket to join the ranks of the stars.\n\nThere exists an emotion beyond emotion, thus the practice of non-action; there is a constancy beyond constancy, thus the absence of form. From antiquity to the present, it has been transmitted and dwelt within, yet none can possess it. All find their own accommodation in it, yet none perceive its form. Illumination requires nothing, for it is not dependent on existence to be non-existent.\n\nHow could the non-existent give birth to the numinous? It does not render ghosts and emperors divine, yet ghosts and emperors become divine of themselves—this is the numinosity of non-numinosity. It does not generate Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth arise of themselves—this is the generation of non-generation. Thus, the numinosity of the numinous is insufficient to be truly numinous; only in non-numinosity does true numinosity reside. What achievement is there to claim? What endeavor is there to rely upon?\n\nTo speak of the Dao’s omnipresence: when it is on high, it is without height; when it is profound, it is without depth; when it endures, it is without duration; when it ages, it is without aging. It is present everywhere, yet wherever it is present, it is as nothing. Moreover, that which pervades above and below cannot be described in terms of high or low; that which reaches within and without cannot be named as inner or outer; that which moves in unison with transformation cannot be called enduring; that which is eternally without beginning or end cannot be termed old.\n\nThe Dao is without agency. This speaks of attaining it through the Dao, yet it is only to clarify that such attainment is self-attained. Being self-attained, the Dao cannot cause one to attain it; if I have not attained it, I cannot force attainment. Thus, all who attain it do not rely on the Dao externally nor depend on themselves internally—they suddenly attain it of themselves and transform alone.\n\nThe difficulty of life is like this self-transformation and self-attainment. Having attained life, why then fret over whether life is attained and strive for it? Thus, striving for life is insufficient to preserve life fully, for life does not arise from one’s own doing—striving for it only harms one’s true life.\n\nNanbo Zikui asked Nü Yu, “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child. How is this?” Nü Yu replied, “I have heard the Dao.”\n\nHaving heard the Dao, one allows life to arise of itself—thus one’s qi and complexion remain whole.”\n\nNanbo Zikui said, “Can the Dao be learned?”\n“Alas! How could it be? You are not the right person. Now, Pulam Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might truly become a sage. If not, even imparting the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. Yet I persisted in instructing him: after three days, he was able to let go of the world; having let go of the world, I persisted further, and after seven days, he was able to let go of things; having let go of things, I persisted again, and after nine days, he was able to let go of life. Only then could he attain clarity at dawn; with clarity at dawn, he could perceive the solitary; perceiving the solitary, he could transcend past and present; transcending past and present, he could enter the realm of neither death nor life. Those who kill life do not die; those who give life to life do not live. As for this state—nothing does it not escort, nothing does it not welcome, nothing does it not destroy, nothing does it not complete. Its name is *yingning* (serene amidst entanglement). *Yingning* is that which is completed through entanglement.”\n\n*Wai* (letting go) means to abandon. Things are what one requires morning and night, difficult to forget due to their immediacy. To abandon them entirely is to let go of life, and thus not to abhor death. Not abhorring death, one finds peace in whatever arises, suddenly free from obstruction, acting in accord with the moment—this is clarity at dawn. Moving in unison with the solitary, one who clings to life thus invites death, and one who abhors death thus invites life. Only by being free from clinging and aversion can one transcend death and life. Allowing things to escort themselves, nothing is not escorted; allowing things to welcome themselves, nothing is not welcomed; allowing things to destroy themselves, nothing is not destroyed; allowing things to complete themselves, nothing is not completed. One who merges with things is entangled by them yet remains undisturbed.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, “From whom did you alone hear this?”\nHe replied, “I heard it from the disciple of *Fumo*, the disciple of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*, the grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*, *Zhanming* heard it from *Nieshu*, *Nieshu* heard it from *Xuyi*, *Xuyi* heard it from *Yu’ou*, *Yu’ou* heard it from *Xuanming*, *Xuanming* heard it from *Canliao*, and *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*.”\n\nIf things entangle yet one alone remains unentangled, one is ruined.\n\nThus, when entangled yet allowing it, nothing fails to be bent into completion.\n\n*Xuanming* is so named because it is \"without\" yet not \"nothing.\" One who ascends by names to reach the nameless must attain the nameless beyond the realm of names. Therefore, even *Xuanming* does not reach the ultimate, and so it is further entrusted to *Canliao*—this is the mystery within mystery.\n\nThe principle of spontaneity is such that it is formed through accumulated practice. Indeed, one ascends from the near to the far, refines from the coarse to the subtle, and so only after seven layers does one reach the name of \"without,\" and after nine layers does one doubt that \"without\" is the beginning.\n\nZisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai spoke among themselves, saying: \"Who can take the absence of being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone? Who knows that death and life, existence and nonexistence, are of one body—we shall befriend them!\" The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord, and so they became friends.\n\nSoon after, Ziyu fell ill, and Zisi went to visit him. He said: \"How wondrous! The Creator is about to make me like this—all crooked and bent.\"\n\nThe man’s back was hunched, his spine protruded, his five organs pressed upward, his chin tucked into his navel, his shoulders towered above his crown, and his goiter pointed to the sky—his yin and yang qi had fallen into disorder. Yet his heart remained at ease, untroubled. He paced to the well, gazed at his reflection, and sighed: \"Alas! The Creator is about to make me like this—all crooked and bent.\"\n\n*Disorder here means chaos or disharmony.*\n\nHe did not take it as suffering. For one who entrusts himself to the transformations of spontaneity, there is no lament—only the world laments on his behalf.\n\nZisi asked: \"Do you resent this?\"\n\nHe replied: \"No, why should I resent it? If, little by little, my left arm were transformed into a rooster, I would use it to herald the dawn. If, little by little, my right arm were transformed into a crossbow, I would use it to hunt an owl for roasting. If, little by little, my tailbone were transformed into a wheel, and my spirit into a horse, I would ride it—why would I need another steed?\n\nMoreover, to gain is a matter of timing; to lose is a matter of following the natural course. At peace with the time and in accord with the course, sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients called *suspended release*—yet those who cannot release themselves are bound by things. Besides, things have long been unable to overcome Heaven. Why should I resent anything?\"\n\n\"Jìn\" means gradual. When the body undergoes transformation and merges with change, there is nowhere it does not follow, and nothing it follows that is impermissible. What one encounters in time, the world calls *gaining*. Time does not pause even briefly; to follow it as it departs, the world calls *losing*. If one cannot release oneself, then the myriad things bind one together. Thus, those who can release themselves are released from all things, while those who cannot are released from nothing.\n\nHeaven cannot be without day and night; how can I be without death and life and resent it? Soon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zili went to visit him and said: \"Shoo! Away! Do not be startled by transformation!\" Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to him: \"How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a mouse’s liver? Will it make you into an insect’s limb?\"\n\nDeath and life are like waking and sleeping. By principle, one ought to sleep, and one does not wish to be startled awake. To transform and die is fitting—there is no cause for alarm. Zilai said: \"For parents and children, east, west, south, or north, one follows their command. Yin and yang are to man no less than parents. If they approach my death and I do not heed them, I would be obstinate—what fault would lie with them? The great clod bears me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.\n\nNow, if a great smith were casting metal, and the metal leapt up, saying, ‘I must become a *Mo Ye* sword!’ the smith would surely deem it inauspicious metal. Now, if one assumes human form and says, ‘I am human! I am human!’ the Creator would surely deem it an inauspicious person. If one takes heaven and earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smith, where could one go and not be acceptable?\" He fell asleep peacefully and awoke with a start.\n\nSince ancient times, some have been able to defy their parents’ commands, but none have been able to defy the changes of yin and yang or resist the cycles of day and night. Death and life are like day and night—nothing so distant. When the time for death comes, it is not something to forbid; yet to stubbornly harbor a defiant heart only hastens one’s end by resisting principle. The swiftness of death arises from one’s own obstinacy, not from death itself. *That* refers to death; in life, one thus regards death as *that*. Principle is ever-present in both.\n\n\"I am human! I am human!\"—one only wishes to remain human. It is like the metal leaping up: the world knows such metal is inauspicious, yet cannot allow it to transform of its own accord. The Way of transformation and change encounters nothing it does not meet. Now, if one encounters human form, was it done deliberately? Life is not deliberate; it arises of itself in time. To strive to possess it is delusion!\n\nPeople all know that metal bound by attachments is inauspicious. Thus, if one realizes one’s own nature is no different from metal, the attachments of the heart can be released. If they can be released, there is nothing that cannot be released. Waking and sleeping remain as they are, and one’s heart is not burdened by life and death.\n\nZisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang spoke among themselves: \"Who can join together without joining, act for one another without acting? Who can ascend to heaven and wander in the mists, roam without limit, forget life, and have no end?\" Those who embody heaven and earth and darkly merge with transformation—though their limbs have different functions and their five organs distinct offices—never join together, yet their hundred joints harmonize as one. This is joining without joining. They never act for one another, yet inner and outer are both fulfilled. This is acting without acting.\n\nIf one were to exert one’s mind to care for one’s limbs, or move one’s thighs and arms to manage one’s organs, the more one strives to nurture them, the more inner and outer become exhausted. Thus, those who take the world as one body have no partiality in their care. They entrust all things without exception. Forgetting life, they forget all things, and thus can follow change and entrust transformation, all without limit.\n\nThe three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in accord. They became friends. Yet was this truly friendship? It was but a lodging of luminous intimacy, free from the nearness of affectionate attachment.\n\nAfter a while, Zisang Hu died, his body yet unburied. When Confucius heard of it, he sent Zigong to attend to the rites. Some wove funeral garlands, others played the zither, and together they sang in harmony: *\"Alas, Zisang Hu! Alas, Zisang Hu! You have returned to your true nature, while we remain as men!\"* Zigong hastened forward and said, *\"May I ask—is it proper to sing before the dead?\"*\n\nTo weep when others weep is but the trace of custom. To equalize life and death, to forget grief and joy, to sing before the dead—this is the utmost of what lies beyond the world. The two looked at each other and laughed: *\"How could he know the meaning of ritual!\"*\n\nOne who knows the meaning of ritual must wander beyond to order what is within, guard the mother to preserve the child, and follow the truth of feeling without deviation. If one is bound by reputation and constrained by form, then filial piety cannot bear sincerity, kindness cannot bear reality, and father and son, brothers, harbor feelings and deceive one another—how could this be the great meaning of ritual?\n\nZigong returned and told Confucius: *\"What manner of men are they? They cultivate no conduct, yet treat their bodies as external. They sing before the dead without change of countenance—there is no name for them. What manner of men are they?\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"They wander beyond the world, while I wander within it. Beyond and within do not reach one another, and yet I sent you to offer condolences—how shallow I was! They are now companions of the Creator, roaming in the single qi of heaven and earth. To them, life is but an excrescent growth, a hanging tumor; death is but the bursting of an abscess, the draining of a sore. How could such as they know where life and death, before and after, reside? Borrowing from different things, they lodge in the same body; forgetting their liver and gall, they abandon their ears and eyes. They turn and return, beginning and ending, without knowing where it starts or ends. Vaguely they wander beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action. How could they trouble themselves with the rituals of the vulgar world to impress the eyes and ears of the crowd?\"*\n\nZigong said: *\"Then what Dao do you follow?\"*\n\nThe principle has an ultimate limit, where beyond and within merge. There has never been one who attained the utmost of wandering beyond yet did not merge within, nor one who merged within yet did not wander beyond. Thus, the sage always wanders beyond to merge within, is without mind to follow what is, and so though all day long he appears in form, his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Though he bends and rises with the myriad affairs, he is serene and at ease. To see form yet not reach spirit—this is the common burden of the world.\n\nThus, when one sees him moving with all things, none can say he abandons things and departs from men; when one sees him responding to affairs while embodying transformation, none can say he sits in forgetfulness and attains self-possession. How could it be only the sage who is not thus? It must be said that the ultimate principle has no such thing.\n\nTherefore, Zhuangzi, in clarifying the lineage of the great tradition to awaken the world, did not simply praise Confucius in this way. Had he done so, some might have clung to what they saw and rejected it. Thus, he transcended the sage’s inner traces and lodged the beyond in those few disciples. One should forget what is lodged to seek the great meaning of his composition. Then the Dao of wandering beyond to merge within will be clear and self-evident, and Zhuangzi’s book will indeed be discourse that crosses the vulgar and covers the world.\n\nOffering condolences is a minor affair of the world within; to apply it to the world beyond is shallow. All are merged, thus there is no duality. Like a tumor that hangs of itself, a growth that attaches of itself—this is the temporary gathering of qi, not what one delights in. Like an abscess that bursts of itself, a sore that drains of itself—this is the natural dispersal of qi, not what one regrets. Life and death alternate without end; if one goes along with them, there is nowhere one cannot go. Thus, one does not know where victory or defeat lies.\n\n*\"Assuming\"* means *\"relying on.\"* Now life and death, gathering and dispersal, change without pattern—all are different things. There is nothing different that is not relied upon, so though what is relied upon differs, all together form one body. If even the five organs are forgotten, what thing is worth recognizing? Without recognition from the start, one can freely follow the path of transformation, darkly merge with the waves of turning and returning, and not know where beginning and end reach their limit.\n\nThis is called *\"wandering in principle and merging with what is beyond.\"* The *\"work of non-action\"* is not mere folded hands and silence; *\"beyond the dust and grime\"* is not hiding in the mountains and forests. What they show to the crowd is but the dust and grime—it is not the dark merging of what lies beyond.\n\nZigong had not heard of *\"nature and the Dao of heaven,\"* so he saw what they relied upon but not what they relied upon *for.* What they relied upon *for* is not reliance—how could the world be aware of it?\n\nConfucius said: *\"I, Qiu, am one punished by heaven. Nevertheless, I share this with you.\"*\n\nTo take what lies within the realm as shackles is to clarify that what is prized lies beyond it. Those who wander beyond rely on what is within; those who depart from humanity conform to custom. Thus, those who possess the world do not take the world as their possession. Only by relinquishing things can one enter the multitude; only by sitting in forgetfulness can one respond to affairs. The more one relinquishes, the more one attains. Should one abide in this ultimate state, then even if one wished to cast it aside, principle would naturally come of its own—this is what neither heaven nor humanity can pardon.\n\nZigong said: *\"May I ask the method?\"*\nThough bound by the world’s shackles, it is but to share this with you. It is clear that I myself ever abide beyond.\n\nConfucius said: *\"Fish come together in water; humans come together in the Dao. Those who come together in water dig ponds to be nourished and provided for; those who come together in the Dao are without affairs and attain tranquility. Thus it is said: Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; humans forget one another in the arts of the Dao.\"*\n\nAsking the meaning of wandering beyond while sharing what is within, Confucius said: *\"Fish come together in water; humans come together in the Dao. Those who come together in water dig ponds to be nourished and provided for; those who come together in the Dao are without affairs and attain tranquility. Thus it is said: Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; humans forget one another in the arts of the Dao.\"*\n\nZigong said: *\"May I ask about the extraordinary person?\"*\n\nThose who come together in different ways—whether in water or in the Dao—all alike attain their ends through non-action, unite what is within by wandering beyond form, and thus find nourishment and tranquility. Yet none are aware of this, and so they achieve effortless action.\n\nIt is said: *\"The extraordinary person is extraordinary among humans yet equal to Heaven. Thus, Heaven’s petty persons are humanity’s noble ones; humanity’s noble ones are Heaven’s petty persons.\"*\n\nWhere each is self-sufficient and forgets the other, nothing in the world is otherwise. The perfected person is ever self-sufficient, and so ever forgetful.\n\nSomeone asked: *\"Where then lies what was earlier called ‘wandering beyond form and unyoked to custom’?\"*\n\nTo be inwardly obscure is to wander outwardly. Only one who can wander outwardly while inwardly obscure, allowing the spontaneity of the myriad things and enabling each to fulfill its Heaven-given nature, brings the Dao of emperors and kings to completion—this is to be extraordinary among humans yet equal to Heaven.\n\nSpeaking in terms of spontaneity, there is no small or great among humans. Speaking in terms of human principles, one who is equal to Heaven may be called a noble person.\n\nYan Hui asked Confucius: *\"Mengsun Cai’s mother died. He wept without tears, his heart felt no grief, and he did not mourn with sorrow. Lacking these three, he was nonetheless deemed the best at mourning in all Lu. Is it truly possible to gain a reputation without substance?\"* Yan Hui found this deeply strange.\n\nIn Lu, they observed his ritual conduct, while Yan Hui examined his heart. Confucius said: *\"Mengsun Cai has exhausted it—he has advanced beyond knowledge. Though he sought simplicity, he could not attain it, for he had already attained a kind of simplicity. Mengsun Cai knows not why he lives, nor why he dies. He knows not whether to follow what comes first or what comes after. If he is transformed into a thing, he awaits the transformations he does not yet know. Moreover, as he is in the midst of transformation, how could he know what is not yet transformed? As he is in the midst of non-transformation, how could he know what has already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have not yet awakened!\n\nYet he may take on startled forms without harming his heart, dwell in new abodes without depleting his essence. Mengsun Cai alone is awake—others weep, and so he weeps, for that is simply what he must do. Moreover, we merely share the same ears—how do we know that what I call 'I' is not truly 'I'? You may dream of being a bird soaring through the heavens, or a fish diving into the depths. Who can say whether the speaker now is awake or dreaming? One reaches contentment before laughter arises; one offers laughter before arranging it. Resting in arrangement, one moves with transformation and enters the vast oneness of Heaven.\"*\n\nOne who fully grasps the principle of life and death, responding fittingly to both inner and outer, moves in accordance with Heaven’s course—this is no match for knowledge. To select between life and death yet find no difference is like the progression of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Having made a selection yet found nothing, one is at ease in all things. Being at ease in all things, one does not weigh life and death in the mind but entrusts them to spontaneous transformation. Wherever one encounters, one is content. One does not resist transformation.\n\nLife and death are but twists in the same flow, merging with transformation. One forgets what one knows in the present—how could one fret over what one does not yet know? Having transformed and come to life, how could one know the time before birth? Not yet transformed and facing death, how could one know what comes after? Thus, there is nothing to avoid or pursue—one simply moves with transformation. Life and death are but waking and dreaming. If in a dream one believes oneself awake, there is no way to prove that waking is not a dream. If one cannot prove that waking is not a dream, then one cannot prove that life is not death.\n\nLife and death, waking and dreaming—where do they reside? In whatever one encounters, one finds contentment. Why grieve over this while worrying about that? Transformation startles the form, but it does not burden the heart. The changes of the bodily frame are but daily renovations of one’s dwelling—one’s nature does not take them as death. The one who is always awake meets no resistance in any direction, so when others weep, he weeps, for that is simply what is fitting.\n\nLife, death, and transformation—all are mine. Since all are mine, what have I lost? Never having lost myself, what cause for sorrow? Without resistance, when others weep, he weeps. Without sorrow, though he weeps, he is not grieved. Nothing is not mine, so he harmonizes inner and outer, pervades past and present, and renews daily with transformation—how could he know where his true self resides? This means there is nowhere one does not find contentment.\n\nWhen dreaming, one believes oneself awake—how then can one know that the present is not a dream? How can one know it is not waking? The transformations of waking and dreaming extend everywhere without hindrance, so the changes of life and death are never worth lamenting. Wherever one arrives is fitting, so one forgets fitting—thus, laughter does not arise. *Pai* means to shift or move. In ritual, weeping must express sorrow, and laughter must express joy. If sorrow and joy linger in the heart, one cannot move with what is fitting.\n\nBut Mengsun is always at ease, so though he weeps, he is not grieved, and he moves with transformation. At peace with shifting, he moves with transformation and thus enters the silence to become one with Heaven. From this point up to Zisi, their attainment is the same. Their approaches to mourning differ, so their songs and weeping vary.\n\nYi’erzi went to see Xu You. Xu You asked: *\"How has Yao aided you?\"* *Zi* here means to supply or assist. Yi’erzi replied: *\"Yao told me: 'You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right from wrong.'\" Xu You said: *\"Then why have you come here? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you wander the boundless, carefree, and ever-shifting paths?\"*\n\nHe speaks of how one will mutilate and diminish oneself through penal teachings, unable to wander again in the realm of self-attainment or the path unbound by ties. Yi’erzi said: *\"Even so, I wish to wander within its fence.\"* He dared not seek to tread the central Way, but wished only to wander along its edges. Xu You said: *\"Not so. The blind have no part in the beauty of brows and eyes or the radiance of countenance; the deaf have no part in the splendor of blue and yellow, of embroidered robes and patterned silks.\"*\n\nYi’erzi said: *\"Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang lost his strength, and the Yellow Emperor lost his wisdom—all within the forge and hammer’s reach. How do we know the Maker of Things will not cease my branding and mend my mutilation, allowing me to mount completion and follow you, Master?\"* He speaks of how not all things in the world necessarily perfect themselves; the principle of spontaneity also requires smelting and forging to become vessels. Thus, these three figures, too, having heard the Dao, afterward forgot their former pursuits. These are all borrowed words, meant to dispel the burdens of mere verbal constructs.\n\nThose who follow their nature and proceed directly act spontaneously; if they proceed and harm their nature, and having harmed it, can change—this, too, is spontaneity. How do we know that my nature is not fated to have its branding ceased and its mutilation mended, allowing me to mount the Way of completion and follow you? To cast me aside and refuse instruction—this may not be the utmost of the Maker of Things.\n\nXu You said: *\"Alas! It cannot be known.\"*\n\n\"Let me speak to you in broad strokes: O my master! O my master! He pulverizes the myriad things yet does not act for righteousness; his beneficence extends to ten thousand generations yet does not act for benevolence. He is older than high antiquity yet does not act for age; he covers and bears heaven and earth, carves and sculpts the forms of all things yet does not act for skill. This is the realm in which he roams!\"\n\nAll things are thus of themselves, with no preference or deliberate action in their midst—where then could benevolence and righteousness reside? They are ever-renewing. It is spontaneous, and thus not skillful. To roam in non-action and take as master the masterless.\n\nYan Hui said: \"I have advanced.\"\nBy taking reduction as advancement.\nZhongni said: \"What do you mean?\"\nHe replied: \"I have forgotten rites and music!\"\nHe said: \"Good, but not yet sufficient.\"\n\nThe benevolent leave traces of universal love; the righteous achieve the work of completing things. Love is not benevolence, yet the traces of benevolence are enacted; completion is not righteousness, yet the work of righteousness appears. To retain benevolence and righteousness is insufficient to understand that the origins of love and benefit lie in non-intention—thus, to forget them is permissible. But merely forgetting their traces and works still falls short of profound penetration.\n\nAnother day, he again saw him and said: \"I have advanced.\"\nHe asked: \"What do you mean?\"\nHe replied: \"I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness.\"\nHe said: \"Good, but not yet sufficient.\"\n\nRites are the functions of the physical form; music is the instrument of joy in life. To forget the instrument is not as profound as forgetting that which enables the instrument.\n\nAnother day, he again saw him and said: \"You have advanced!\"\nHe asked: \"What do you mean?\"\nHe replied: \"I have attained *sitting in forgetfulness*.\"\nConfucius started and said: \"What do you mean by *sitting in forgetfulness*?\"\nYan Hui said: \"I discard my limbs and body, dismiss my hearing and sight, detach from form and abandon knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare—this is called *sitting in forgetfulness*.\"\nWhen nothing is not the same, there is never discontent; when there is never discontent, what preferences or aversions could there be?\n\nConfucius said: \"To be the same is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy. And you are indeed worthy! I, Qiu, would follow after you.\"\nOne who is the same as transformation follows only where transformation leads—thus there is no constancy.\n\nZiyu and Zisang were friends. When continuous rain fell for ten days, Ziyu said: \"Zisang is likely in distress!\" He wrapped rice and went to feed him. Arriving at Zisang’s gate, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping, as Zisang plucked his zither and cried:\n\"Father! Mother! Heaven!\"\n\n\"Humanity indeed!\"—yet his voice could not bear the strain, so he hastened to recite his verse.\n\nZiyu entered and asked: \"Why do you sing this poem in such a manner?\"\n\nThese two were such that they acted for one another without acting for one another. Now, wrapping rice to feed him was but following Heaven’s principle and acting spontaneously—it was not that he went because of acting for him. To suspect the presence of emotion is to rush forth and depart far from the principle.\n\nHe said: \"I ponder what has brought me to this extremity, yet I cannot find it. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; Earth bears all without partiality—would Heaven and Earth single me out for poverty? I seek what has caused this, yet I cannot find it! Yet to have reached this extremity is fate indeed!\"\n\nAll things are thus of themselves; there is no doer behind them.\n\n---\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Zhuangzi, \"The Equalizing Lord of the World\" (Chapter Seven):*\n\nNie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Thereupon Nie Que leapt with great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.\n\nMaster Pu Yi said: \"Have you only now come to know this? The Lord of Yu did not attain to the level of the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu concealed benevolence to entice men—thus he gained men, yet never emerged from the realm of the unnatural. The Lord of Tai slept in tranquil ease and awoke in leisurely fashion. At times he took himself for a horse, at times for an ox. His knowledge was true and his virtue most genuine, yet he never entered the realm of the unnatural.\"\n\nOne who is without intent and follows spontaneous transformation is fit to be an emperor-king. The Lord of Yu and the Lord of Tai were but traces of worldly affairs, not that by which traces are made. That by which traces are made is traceless—who in the world could name it? Never having been named, what victory or defeat could there be? Yet the traceless one rides the myriad changes, treading through ten thousand ages. The world has its level plains and perilous passes, thus traces sometimes fall short.\n\nOne who takes what he likes as the \"right\" person and what he dislikes as the \"wrong\" person is confined within the bounds of right and wrong. One who can emerge from the realm of the unnatural must enter the realm where there is no unnatural. Thus there is no gain, no loss, no right, no wrong—how could it be merely concealing benevolence to entice men? Being thus, what right or wrong persons could there be? This may be called emerging from the realm of the unnatural.\n\nFollowing one’s own knowledge, thus emotions are true. Following one’s own attainment, thus there is no falsity. Not entering the realm of right and wrong is how one cuts off from the age of the Lord of Yu.\n\n---\n\nJian Wu met Jie Yu the Madman.\n\nJie Yu asked: \"What did Zhong Shi tell you at noon?\"\n\nJian Wu replied: \"He told me that a ruler of men must issue laws, standards, principles, and measures from himself—who would dare not listen and be transformed?\"\n\nJie Yu said: \"This is deceptive virtue. In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea to dig a river or making a mosquito carry a mountain. Does the sage govern externally? He rectifies himself and then acts, ensuring only that he is capable of his task. Moreover, birds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and nets; the field mouse burrows deep beneath the sacred mound to escape the peril of fumigation and digging—yet do these two creatures lack knowledge?\"\n\nTo impose one’s self upon things is to cause things to lose their truth.\n\nTo entrust all to the myriad things is to accomplish without action; to impose one’s self upon the world is to leave no task complete and no burden borne. Preserve only what lies within one’s nature and allotted span. Each rectifies its own nature and destiny. Do not attempt what one cannot. Even birds and beasts each have their means of self-preservation—thus when emperors and kings leave them to their own, they fulfill themselves. Have you truly not known that these two creatures each preserve themselves without need of instruction?\n\nTian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and arrived at the banks of Liao River, where he encountered the Nameless Man and asked: “I beg to ask how to govern the world.” The Nameless Man replied: “Away! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask so unpleasantly? I am about to become human with the Creator of Things. When weary, I shall ride the boundless bird to soar beyond the six directions and wander the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the vast wilderness. Why trouble my heart with your questions of governing the world?”\n\nTo ask how to govern the world is not to rise from the Great Beginning nor to rest in the Dark and Obscure. Let people act of themselves. \"Boundless\" means the myriad fragments. Riding the myriad fragments, driving the ten thousand things, one moves freely without constraint or obstruction. To release all into the realm of self-attainment is to govern without governing.\n\nHe asked the Nameless Man again: “If you let your mind wander in simplicity, harmonize your qi with stillness, follow things as they are without private intent, then the world will be governed.” To follow one’s nature without adornment is simplicity. To rest in stillness within one’s nature is stillness. To let nature arise of itself is impartiality; to seek to augment it with the heart’s desires is partiality. Partiality cannot sustain life, but following impartiality preserves it wholly.\n\nYang Ziju saw Lao Dan and said: “Suppose there were a man swift, strong, and resolute, with penetrating insight and clear understanding, who studies the Dao without weariness—could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?” Lao Dan replied: “In the eyes of the sage, such a man is like a clerk or artisan, bound by skill and toil, exhausting his body and startling his mind. Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards invite hunting; the agility of apes and monkeys invites capture. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”\n\nYang Ziju, disconcerted, said: “I venture to ask about the governance of an enlightened king.” Lao Dan said: “Such skill leaves no room for the self—how could it compare to a sage-king? The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name is raised, and things delight of themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders where there is nothing.”\n\nIf the world had no enlightened king, none could attain self-fulfillment. That they do so is truly the king’s achievement—yet his achievement lies in non-action and entrusting the world to itself. When all in the world act of themselves, it seems not the king’s doing. The enlightened king fully meets the nature of things, so each person says, “I am thus of myself,” without knowing their reliance on him. Though his achievements cover the world, he does not claim them as his name, so all things believe they have attained of themselves and rejoice. He dwells in the path of transformation, daily renewed without fixed form. Identifying with the ten thousand things, he wanders in emptiness. If one cannot merge with things, one is ever at odds with them—how could one wander in emptiness?\n\nIn Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew men’s deaths and lives, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, long life and early death, predicting the year, month, ten-day period, or day as if by spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. Liezi saw him and was enchanted. Returning, he told Huzhi: “At first I thought your Dao was supreme, but now there is something even greater.” He did not delight in hearing his own death day.\n\nHe said Ji Xian’s attainment surpassed even the Master’s. Huzhi replied: “I have shown you only its outward pattern, not yet its true substance. How could you have truly attained the Dao? A flock of hens without a rooster—what eggs could they lay? When you parade the Dao before the world with such certainty, you make yourself readable, and thus others can divine your fate. Come, bring him here and let him see me.”\n\nThis showed that Liezi had not yet embraced the Dao. Without embracing the Dao, one still has a mind; having a mind, one asserts one aspect to the exclusion of others, and thus becomes predictable to the world—hence others can divine one’s fate.\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huzhi. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: “Alas! Your master is dead! He will not live. It will not be counted in tens of days! I saw something strange—like damp ashes.”\n\nLiezi entered, his tears soaking his lapels as he told Huzhi. Huzhi said: “Earlier I showed him the pattern of earth—still and unshaken, as if sprouting yet unmoving. This must be what he saw: my blocked virtue-mechanism. Come, bring him again.”\n\nStill and unmoving as a sprout, neither correcting itself nor standing upright, sharing the barrenness of withered wood and the lifelessness of damp ashes—this is the moment when the perfected person is without responsiveness. The perfected person moves like heaven, rests like earth, flows like water, and abides in profound stillness. Profound stillness and flowing water, heavenly motion and earthly rest—though they seem not to act, they are spontaneously so, and in this they are one.\n\nNow, when Ji Xian saw him dwelling like a corpse and sitting in oblivion, he declared him near death; when he glimpsed his spirit stirring and heaven following, he took it for signs of life. Truly, if one responds without engaging the heart-mind, the pattern naturally aligns with the mysterious tally; if one ascends and descends with transformations, taking the world as measure, then one becomes master of things, following the timeless without limit—thus beyond the diviner’s reckoning. This is the great meaning of \"Responding to Emperors and Kings.\"\n\nWhen the virtue-mechanism does not activate, it is called \"blocked.\"\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huzhi again. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: “Fortunate indeed! Your master has met me—he is recovering! Fully alive now! I see his blocked mechanism has shifted!”\n\nLiezi entered and told Huzhi. Huzhi said: “Earlier I showed him heaven and earth—names and realities did not enter, yet the mechanism arose from the heels. This must be what he saw: my good mechanism. Come, bring him again.”\n\n*Shift* here means *mechanism*. Now he realizes that what he saw yesterday was the *blocked mechanism*, hence his declaration of impending death. Between heaven and earth, the work of covering and bearing is manifest—compared to the pattern of earth, is this not a step beyond? This is the appearance of responsive resonance. When one entrusts oneself to natural covering and bearing, the heavenly mechanism mysteriously responds, and the adornments of fame and profit all become discarded things. The mechanism always arises from the utmost height. When it activates and excels in the other, the other perceives it.\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huzhi again. Upon leaving, Ji Xian said to Liezi: “Your master is unsettled—I cannot divine him. Let him settle, and I will divine him again.”\n\nLiezi entered and told Huzhi. Huzhi said: “Earlier I showed him the Great Vastness where nothing prevails—this must be what he saw: my balanced qi-mechanism. The whirlpool formed by the *ni* fish is a deep pool; the still water that forms a deep pool is a deep pool; the flowing water that forms a deep pool is a deep pool. There are nine names for deep pools—here I showed him three. Come, bring him again.”\n\nDwelling at the utmost height of the Great Vastness, one’s heart drifts in boundless tranquility and merges mystically with the ten thousand directions—thus victory and defeat cannot find place within it. There is no direction that is not level, all blending into oneness. Those who peer at heaven through a tube see no horizon, and so it seems uneven. The deep pool is but the name for stillness and silence.\n\nWater is ever without intent, yielding and following external things. Thus, whether flowing or still, whether the *ni* fish coils or the dragon leaps, it remains profoundly self-possessed, never losing its stillness and silence. The perfected person acts when employing it and halts when setting it aside; though action and stillness differ, the mysterious silence remains one. Thus, I briefly presented three variations to clarify this.\n\nThough the waves shift through nine transformations, and order and chaos swirl in confusion, one who dwells at this height remains serene and self-content, drifting in forgetfulness of all doing.\n\nThe next day, Liezi again brought Ji Xian to see Huzhi. Before he could settle into his stance, Ji Xian lost himself and fled. Huzhi said: “Pursue him!” Liezi chased after him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Huzhi: “He has vanished, he is gone—I could not reach him.”\n\nHuzhi said: “Earlier, I showed him what has never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and followed his winding path, so he knew not who or what I was. Taking me for drifting grass, taking me for flowing waves, he fled.”\n\nThough transformations are ceaseless, they ever strike deep roots in the hidden utmost. Without intent, one follows the transformations of things, drifting unbound by any tether. As changes crumble and decay, as worldly affairs surge like waves, there is nowhere one does not accord.\n\nThe perfected person is one, yet responds to the world’s changes and moves with the times—thus the physiognomist found no foothold for his gaze and fled in self-loss. This clarifies that one who would respond as emperor or king has no fixed method.\n\nThereafter, Liezi returned home believing he had never yet begun to learn. For three years he did not venture out, cooked for his wife, and fed pigs as he would feed people, showing no partiality in his dealings. Carved and polished, he returned to simplicity, standing alone as a mere clod of earth. Though the world swirled in chaos, he remained thus to the end. He forgot distinctions of noble and base, attending only to what he encountered. He shed ornament for substance, casting off external embellishments. Though he moved, his true nature never scattered.\n\nLet things each fulfill their own ends. Be not the host of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of knowledge. Embody the boundless and wander without trace. Exhaust what you receive from Heaven, yet perceive no gain—be empty, and nothing more!\n\nThe perfected person’s mind works like a mirror: it neither sends forth nor greets, responds yet does not store, and thus can master things without harm. Accord with things, and each will naturally fit its name. Let things each devise their own plans, entrust tasks to each as they are suited, and without intent, let each direct its own knowledge.\n\nFollow the world’s spontaneous self-governing, and you may gallop through the ten thousand things without exhaustion. Entrust yourself to things, and you leave no trace. When you are content, you stop. To perceive gain is to know no stopping. Without emptiness, one cannot bear the weight of all realities.\n\nMirror things without emotion. When they come, respond; when they depart, cease. Things arrive, and one reflects them—reflecting not with the mind, thus though the world be vast, there is no burden of wearying the spirit.\n\nThe Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Central Realm was Hundun. Shu and Hu would often meet in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them exceedingly well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s virtue, saying: “All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died. Those who act ruin things.",

      "translated_text": "Xiang Xiu and Guo Xiang’s *Annotations on the Zhuangzi*\n*Zhuangzi, Inner Chapters, \"Free and Easy Wandering\" (First)*\n\nThough small and great differ, when released into the realm of self-attainment, things follow their nature, affairs match their capacity, each fitting its allotted portion—free and easy wandering is one and the same. How could victory or defeat find place between them?\n\nIn the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun.\nThe greatness of Kun—who knows how many thousand *li* it spans?\nIt transforms into a bird, its name is Peng.\nThe reality of Peng and Kun, I have not yet fathomed.\n\nThe great purport of Zhuangzi lies in free and easy wandering, in non-action and self-attainment. Thus he exhausts the extremes of small and great to illuminate the suitability of inherent nature. Those of far-reaching vision should grasp its convergence and let go of its incidental trappings, not troubling themselves to argue point by point with the living. So long as the grand intent remains unharmed, all may be roughly understood.\n\nThe back of Peng—who knows how many thousand *li* it spans?\nWhen it rouses itself to flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky.\nThis bird, when the seas stir, will journey to the Southern Darkness.\nThe Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond.\nOnly the dark sea suffices to bear its body; only ninety thousand *li* suffice to support its wings.\nIs this a fondness for the strange? It is simply that great things must arise from great places, and great places must give rise to such great things—principle is inherently natural, not fearing loss. Why trouble the mind over it?\n\n*Qi Xie* is a record of marvels.\nIts words say: “When Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, then spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*. With wings so vast, lifting is difficult—only by seizing the whirlwind can it ascend; ninety thousand *li* are needed to sustain itself. With such wings, how could it suddenly take flight, only to descend a few *ren*? This is all unavoidable, not a matter of delight. It departs with the six-month breath.”",

      "translated_text": "The great bird departs for half a year before resting at the Celestial Pond; the small bird flies for half a morning before darting to the elm or sandalwood to alight. Though their capacities differ, in following their nature they are one. The wild horses of the air, the motes of dust—all living things are blown about by one another’s breath. These are but what the Peng relies upon to fly.\n\nThe \"wild horses\" are wandering *qi*. Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it simply so distant that it has no end? From above, the Peng sees the earth as we see the sky—thus it halts and plans its journey south, for it knows not the distance, only that it must go far enough to sustain itself and depart.\n\nIf water is not deep, it lacks the strength to bear a great boat. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor, and a mustard seed becomes a boat; place a cup there, and it sticks fast—too shallow for so large a vessel. This makes clear why the Peng flies so high: its wings are vast. A small creature requires little, so a great one cannot make do with less. Thus principle has its ultimate divisions, and things have their fixed limits; each suffices for its task, and their fulfillment is the same.\n\nIf one forgets the root of life and pursues it beyond what is fitting, undertaking what exceeds one’s strength and acting against one’s nature, then even wings spanning the sky cannot escape exhaustion, and a sudden flight cannot avoid distress. If the wind is not deep, it lacks the power to bear great wings. Only when the wind lies nine thousand *li* below can the Peng now rise upon it; only by shouldering the sky and overcoming all obstacles can it now set its course south. Yet its journey south is not out of love for height or longing for distance—it is simply that without accumulated wind, no path opens before it. Such is the Peng’s freedom.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: *\"We burst forth in flight, dart to the elm or sandalwood, and if we fall short, we simply land on the ground—why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?\"* If one is content in one’s nature, then even the great Peng has no cause to value itself above the small bird, nor does the small bird envy the Celestial Pond, for its desires are already fulfilled. Thus, though great and small differ, their freedom is the same.\n\nThose who journey to the near wilds return in a day with bellies still full; those who travel a hundred *li* must pound grain the night before; those who go a thousand *li* must gather provisions for three months. The farther the destination, the more provisions are needed—just as the greater the wings, the deeper the *qi* must be. What do these two creatures know?\n\nThese two creatures—the Peng and the shrimp—contrast great with small to show how their aims are equal. Why do their aims differ? Not because they knowingly choose difference, but because each follows its nature without contrivance. This is the essence of freedom.\n\nLesser knowledge does not reach greater knowledge; short years do not reach long years. All things have their nature, and each nature has its limit—like years and wisdom, how could mere striving attain what lies beyond? From this point to Liezi, examples of long and short years are given, each true to its kind, none sufficient to surpass the other.\n\nOnly the person free of all dependence, who forgets self and others, who merges with all differences—only such a one, whose freedom bears no name, can unite great and small. For if there is great and small, then even the Peng and the sparrow, the minister and the wind-rider, are equally bound by things. If there is life and death, then even the great *chun* tree and the mayfly, Pengzu and the morning mushroom, are equally cut short.\n\nThus, to wander where there is no great or small is to be boundless; to merge with what is neither life nor death is to be limitless. But if freedom is tied to a fixed direction, then even if set loose to roam, it will reach an end—for it is not yet free of dependence. How do we know this is so?\n\nThe morning mushroom knows not the waxing and waning of the moon; the summer cicada knows not spring and autumn—these are short years. South of Chu there is the *Mingling* tree, for which five hundred years make a spring, five hundred years an autumn; in high antiquity there was the great *zhuang* tree, for which eight thousand years make a spring, eight thousand years an autumn—these are long years. Yet Pengzu alone is famed for his longevity; for common people to compare themselves to him is truly lamentable!\n\nThe disparity in years and wisdom is so vast, yet when measured against what common people find lamentable, it is even more pitiable. But people never lament this, for each nature has its limit. If one knows this limit, then even the slightest difference cannot be bridged—what in the world is there to lament? Things never long for what is small because of its smallness, but always envy what is great because of its greatness. Yet the difference between great and small is fixed by nature, beyond the reach of envy or desire—thus the burden of envy and desire can be cut off.\n\nSorrow arises from bondage; when bondage is severed, sorrow departs. And when sorrow departs, life and destiny are at peace—this has never been otherwise. This is what Tang asked Ji about.\n\nTang’s question to Ji also concerned how all things have their limits, and how following them brings harmony. Thus Zhuangzi affirmed his question as correct.\n\nNorth of the barren lands lies the Dark Sea—the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, thousands of *li* in breadth, whose length no one knows; its name is Kun. There is a bird there, named Peng, whose back is like Mount Tai and whose wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. It spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds and shouldering the blue sky, then sets its course south, bound for the Southern Darkness.",
      "overlap_context": "is a record of marvels.\nIts words say: “When Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, then spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*. With wings so vast, lifting is difficult—only by seizing the whirlwind can it ascend; ninety thousand *li* are needed to sustain itself. With such wings, how could it suddenly take flight, only to descend a few *ren*? This is all unavoidable, not a matter of delight. It departs with the six-month breath.”",

      "translated_text": "The marsh sparrow laughed at it, saying: \"Where is it off to now? I leap and bound upward, but descend after only a few *ren*, soaring among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the perfection of flight. And where is it off to now?\" This is the distinction between small and great.\n\nEach attains its nature as perfection, exhausts itself as the limit. Earlier, it was said that the two creatures differ, so their destinations vary—one soars to the Celestial Pond, the other reaches only the elm and sandalwood—each is content with its form and sufficient, unaware of why it is so. Now, speaking of the distinction between small and great, each has its natural endowment. This is not something attainable by striving or admiration. Each rests in its own nature, untroubled by their differences, so the point is reiterated.\n\nThus, those whose knowledge suffices for a single office, whose conduct is matched by a single village, whose virtue aligns with a single lord, or whose merit is recognized by a single state—such men regard themselves as this sparrow does, content within their own bounds, like a bird at ease in its domain. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. Because he has not yet equalized all things, he finds cause for laughter.\n\nMoreover, though the whole world praises him, he is not encouraged; though the whole world blames him, he is not discouraged. He has firmly grasped the division between inner and outer—within, the self; without, things. He distinguishes the boundary between honor and shame—honor for himself, shame for others. This is the limit. He cannot surpass it further. In his dealings with the world, he is not restless. He is sufficient unto himself, thus at ease in the world. Yet even so, he has not yet established the ultimate.\n\nHe can affirm himself, but cannot be without something to affirm. Liezi rode the wind and traveled, lightly and skillfully—*lingran*, the appearance of effortless grace. After fifteen days, he returned. If one relies on something, then even riding the wind is merely that—one cannot circumnavigate in an instant. In his pursuit of fortune, he was not restless. He naturally rode the wind, not seeking knowledge through restless striving. Though he avoided walking, he still depended on something. Without wind, he could not travel—this is necessarily reliance. Only one who accomplishes all without reliance is free from dependence.\n\nAs for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, and harnesses the transformations of the six qi, roaming the boundless—what does he rely on? Heaven and Earth are the collective names for the myriad things. Heaven and Earth take the myriad things as their body, and the myriad things must take spontaneity as their constancy. Spontaneity is that which is not done yet naturally is. Thus, the great Peng’s ability to ascend, the marsh sparrow’s ability to descend, the tree stump’s ability to grow, the morning mushroom’s ability to be short—all these are what spontaneity enables, not what effort enables. Not acting yet naturally able, this is what is meant by constancy.\n\nThus, riding the constancy of Heaven and Earth is to follow the nature of the myriad things; harnessing the transformations of the six qi is to roam the paths of change. Proceeding thus, where is there an end? What is harnessed and ridden—what more is there to rely on? This is the carefree wandering of one of utmost virtue, who merges self and other in profound unity.\n\nIf one relies on something, then even Liezi’s light and skillful flight cannot proceed without wind. He must obtain what he relies on before attaining carefree wandering—how much more so for the great Peng! Only one who merges with things and follows great transformation can be without reliance and always unobstructed. Is this merely self-unobstructed? It also guides those who rely on something, ensuring they do not lose what they depend on. If what is relied on is not lost, then it is equal to great unobstruction.\n\nThus, reliance and non-reliance are not opposed; each rests in its nature, the heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself, received without awareness—then there is nothing that cannot be distinct. Non-reliance is not enough to distinguish reliance, let alone the great and small of those who rely!\n\nTherefore, the Perfected Person has no self—without self, one follows things and reaches the ultimate. The Spirit Man has no merit—things have never thanked spontaneity for their lives, yet must rejoice in reliance on acupuncture and stone. When principle reaches its limit, traces vanish. Now, following without assisting, one becomes one with the ultimate principle—thus, no merit. The Sage has no name. The Sage is merely the name for things attaining their nature; it is not enough to name how they attain it.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, saying: \"The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for its light to compare? The timely rain has fallen, yet one still irrigates—is it not laborious for its moisture to compare? You stand, and the world is ordered, yet I still occupy the throne. I see myself as lacking. I beg to offer the world to you.\"\n\nXu You replied: \"You govern the world, and the world is already ordered. One who can order the world does not govern it. Thus, Yao governs by not governing—he does not order the world and yet it is ordered. Now, Xu You clearly understands that once order is achieved, there is nothing to rely on, and order truly comes from Yao. Thus, his words 'you govern' should be forgotten to seek what they illustrate. Yet some say that one who governs and orders is Yao, while one who does not govern and yet enables Yao to order is Xu You—this is far from the truth.\n\nOrder arises from non-governance; action emerges from non-action. Taking from Yao is sufficient—what need is there for Xu You? If one claims that only by folding one’s hands in silence within the mountains and forests can one be called non-active, this is why the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi are rejected by those in power. Those in power are necessarily bound to the realm of action and do not turn back—this is the reason. Yet if I were to replace you, would I do so for the sake of a name? A name is but the guest of reality.\"",

      "translated_text": "Shall I then be but a guest to reality? One who takes on burdens faces things, while one who follows things encounters no opposition—thus Yao had no counterpart in the world, while Xu You and Hou Ji and Qi were his equals.\n\nWhy say it is so? One who merges with things cannot be separated from them. Thus, with no mind, responses arise purely from resonance; drifting like a boat untethered, east or west is not of one’s own doing. Therefore, one who takes no action yet shares all with the people goes nowhere without being the lord of the world. To rule thus is as if the world elevates itself—this is truly the virtue of the lord. But if one stands alone, loftily atop a mountain’s peak, this is not the natural inclination of man. To cling to one corner is but a partial preference—how can one claim it exclusively? Such a one is but a single thing among the common, an outer minister to Yao. To replace the inner lord with an outer minister is to bear the name of ruler without its true responsibility.\n\nThe wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs but a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes only to fill its belly. Each nature has its limit—when that limit is met, the rest of the world’s wealth is superfluous. Return to rest, O lord—I have no use for the world! If you have no use for it, why should Yao alone possess it? Clearly, one who embraces openness has no fixed direction, and so the world delights in elevating him without weariness.\n\nThough the cook does not prepare the meal, the invocator does not step beyond the sacrificial vessels to take his place.\n\nCook and invocator each remain in their proper office; birds and beasts and the myriad things each are content with what they receive; Emperor Yao and Xu You each rest in what they encounter—this is the ultimate reality of the world. When each attains their reality, what more is there to do? It is enough to attain it alone.\n\nThus, though the paths of Yao and Xu You differ, their freedom is one. Jian Wu asked Lian Shu: *\"I heard Jie Yu’s words—they were vast yet without measure, boundless and never returning. I was alarmed by them, like the Milky Way stretching endlessly; so far-reaching, so removed from human feeling.\"*\n\nLian Shu said: *\"What did he say?\"*\n\nJian Wu replied: *\"On the distant Guye Mountain dwells a spirit-man—his skin is as if ice and snow, his grace as if a maiden’s. These are but borrowed words. The spirit-man is what we now call the sage. Though the sage stands in the halls of state, his heart is no different than if he were in the mountains and forests—how could the world recognize this? They see only his imperial canopy and jade seals and think these enough to bind his heart; they see him traverse mountains and rivers, sharing in the people’s affairs, and think these enough to weary his spirit. How could they know the perfection of the most perfect remains unharmed?\n\nNow, to speak of one of royal virtue and lodge him on this mountain is to show that the world has no way to recognize him. Thus, he is placed beyond the farthest reaches, beyond the bounds of sight and hearing. The maiden does not let the outer harm the inner. She does not eat the five grains, but draws in the wind and drinks the dew. Both eat the five grains, yet only she becomes a spirit-man—this makes clear that the spirit-man is not made by the five grains, but is uniquely endowed with the wondrous qi of nature. She rides the clouds, drives flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. Her spirit is concentrated, so that things suffer no blight and the harvests ripen. Yet I deem this mad and do not believe it.\"*",

      "translated_text": "One who embodies the spirit, dwells in the numinous, and exhausts the subtleties of principle—though abiding in the stillness of a quiet chamber—is mystically one with the farthest reaches beyond the four seas. Thus, they ride the Two Modes and harness the Six Abandonments, moving among the multitudes yet driving the myriad things. If nothing is not compliant, then floating clouds become their mount; if no form is not borne, then flying dragons become their steed. They leave the body behind and attain self-realization, though seemingly indifferent and without reliance. Sitting in forgetfulness, acting in forgetfulness, they forget even the act of forgetting—thus, their movement is like dragging withered wood, their stillness like a heap of dead ashes. This is what is meant by the spirit’s concentration. When the spirit is concentrated, what is not concentrated attains its own realization.\n\nYet the world judges all by what it sees—how could it ever believe this?\n\nLián Shū said: \"Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that suffers blindness and deafness? Knowledge, too, has its own. To dismiss the most profound and wondrous words as madness and refuse to believe them—this is the deafness and blindness of understanding. Such words are like timely rain. To say that what Jiē Yú spoke of is naturally sought by things, while those who are deaf and blind to knowledge deny its truth—this is to misunderstand the person and their virtue. They spread their influence across the ten thousand things, unifying the age and seeking to end its chaos. Who would toil and trouble themselves over the world’s affairs?\n\nThe heart of the sage reaches the ultimate convergence of the Two Modes and exhausts the wondrous numbers of the myriad things. Thus, they embody transformation and harmonize with change. There is nowhere they cannot go, pervading the ten thousand things so that nothing is not so. The world, in its chaos, seeks me, yet I have no mind. If I have no mind, why should I not respond to the world? Yet one who embodies the mysterious and exhausts the wondrous—through this, they harmonize with the natures of the ten thousand things and shape the transformations of the world, thereby attaining the fame of Yao and Shun. But they always act by means of non-action. Who would toil and trouble their spirit, exhausting their thoughts over affairs, and only then achieve it?\n\nSuch a person—nothing harms them. If one is at ease with what harms, then harm cannot harm; if harm cannot harm, then things do not harm them. The great flood may rise to the heavens without drowning them; the great drought may melt metal and stone, scorch earth and mountains without heating them. Wherever they go, they are at ease—every place is fitting. Life and death bring no change to them, much less drowning or scorching! Thus, the perfected one does not entangle themselves in calamity and disaster—not by avoiding it, but by following principle straightforwardly, naturally meeting with good fortune. Their dust and chaff, their husks and refuse, are what would mold Yao and Shun. Who would trouble themselves over things!\n\nYao and Shun are but names for worldly affairs; those who act for the sake of names are not truly named. Thus, Yao and Shun—are they merely Yao and Shun? There must be the reality of the spirit-man within. What the world calls Yao and Shun is but the dust and chaff, the husks and refuse of their names. The people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. Yao governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm’s affairs, yet when he went to see the Four Masters on the distant Gu Ye Mountain, north of the Fen River, he was suddenly bereft of his world.\n\nYao’s non-use of the world is like the Yue people’s non-use of ceremonial caps. Yet one who leaves the world behind is truly revered by the world. Though the world reveres Yao, Yao never possessed the world. Thus, he was suddenly bereft of it, having long roamed his mind in the boundless darkness. Though seated above the ten thousand things, he was never not carefree. The Four Masters are but figures of speech to show that Yao was not confined to being Yao. Yao was truly in the dark; his traces were but Yao. To view the dark from the traces is to see inner and outer as separate realms—no wonder it is strange! The world sees only Yao as Yao—how could it recognize his darkness?\"\n\nHuì Zǐ said to Zhuāng Zǐ: \"The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to hold five *dàn*. When I used it to hold water or broth, its strength was not enough to lift itself. When I split it to make a ladle, it was too large and unwieldy to hold anything. It was not that it wasn’t vast—it was that I deemed it useless and smashed it.\"\n\nZhuāng Zǐ said: \"You are truly unskilled in using the great. There was a man of Song who was good at making a salve that prevented chapped hands. For generations, his family made their living by washing silk floss in water. The salve kept their hands from cracking, so they could always bleach silk in the water. A traveler heard of it and offered a hundred gold pieces for the recipe. The family gathered and deliberated: ‘For generations, we’ve washed silk floss and earned only a few gold pieces. Now, in one morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred gold. Let’s give it to him.’ The traveler obtained it and persuaded the King of Wu. When Yue raised a rebellion, the King of Wu sent him to lead the troops. In winter, they fought a naval battle with Yue, and he utterly defeated the Yue forces, winning a fiefdom. The ability to prevent chapped hands was the same, yet one man gained a fiefdom while another remained washing silk floss—the difference lay in how it was used.\n\nNow you have a gourd that holds five *dàn*—why not consider making a great float and drifting upon the rivers and lakes, instead of worrying that it is too large and unwieldy to hold anything? Then you still have the heart of a clogged reed!\"\n\nA clogged reed is not one who attains thorough understanding. This passage speaks of how things each have their proper use. If one finds the proper use, where can one not be carefree?\n\nHuì Zǐ said to Zhuāng Zǐ: \"I have a great tree—people call it a *chū*. Its great trunk is gnarled and does not meet the inked line; its small branches are twisted and do not fit the compass or square. It stands by the road, yet carpenters do not glance at it. Now your words are vast but useless—just what everyone rejects.\"\n\nZhuāng Zǐ said: \"Have you never seen a wildcat or weasel? They crouch low to lie in wait, pouncing on their prey. They leap east and west, not avoiding high or low...\"",

Both eat the five grains, yet only she becomes a spirit-man—this makes clear that the spirit-man is not made by the five grains, but is uniquely endowed with the wondrous qi of nature. She rides the clouds, drives flying dragons, and roams beyond the four seas. Her spirit is concentrated, so that things suffer no blight and the harvests ripen. Yet I deem this mad and do not believe it.\"*",

This creature is great indeed, yet it cannot catch mice. You have a great tree and fret that it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the vast and boundless wilds? Wander idly at its side, roam carefree beneath its shade. No axe will fell it prematurely, no thing will harm it. Useless? Where then will you find trouble?\"\n\nFor things great and small, if they miss their proper measure, the principles of benefit and harm are the same. When use finds its proper place, all things are carefree.\n\n---\n\nIn *The Equality of Things*, Book Two of the *Inner Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi*:\n\nNan Guo Ziqi leaned against his armrest, gazed at the sky, and sighed, his response so absent it seemed he had lost his counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, \"What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, the heart like dead ashes? The one who leans here now is not the one who leaned here before.\"\n\nThose who affirm themselves and deny others, who praise themselves and despise others—all things are like this. Yet though right and wrong differ, self and other are equal. To unite with Heaven and humanity, to equalize self and other, is to be outwardly without companions for joy, and in response, the body dissolves as if it has lost its match. Dead ashes and withered wood take their stillness and lack of feeling. Those who follow nature and forget right and wrong—what do their bodies hold but the solitary task of Heaven’s truth? Thus, when still, they stand like withered trees; when moving, they sway like dry branches. When seated, they are like dead ashes; when walking, like drifting dust. In their movements and stillness, I cannot find unity. In their effortless self-possession, I cannot find duality.\n\nZiyou had seen those who leaned on armrests before, but never one like Ziqi. \"I have lost myself,\" he said, \"and in losing myself, I have forgotten all things. If I have forgotten all things, what in the world is worth recognizing? Thus, I forget both inner and outer, and only then do I transcend and attain both.\"\n\nZiqi said, \"Yan, how excellent that you ask! Just now, I lost myself—did you know it? You have heard the *human pipes*, but not the *earthly pipes*; you have heard the *earthly pipes*, but not the *Heavenly pipes*.\"\n\nThe *pipes* are flutes. Flutes and reeds vary in length, their notes differing in pitch, producing myriad sounds of varying heights and depths. Though the sounds are myriad, the measure they receive is one, and thus there is no place for superiority or inferiority to intervene.\n\nConsider the things of wind: different sounds share the same nature, each taking what is its own—thus the *pipes of Heaven* are revealed.\n\nZiyou said, \"May I ask the method?\"\n\nZiqi said, \"The Great Clod exhales its qi, and its name is wind. It does nothing, yet when it acts, the myriad hollows roar in anger. Have you alone not heard its long sighing? The Great Clod is nothing. Does the exhalation of qi require a thing? The qi simply exhales of itself. When things are born, none do not arise of themselves—thus the body of self-arising is vast, and so it is named the Great Clod.\n\nThe towering forests and jagged cliffs, the great trees with hollows as wide as a man’s embrace—some resemble noses, some mouths, some ears, some hairpins, some rings, some mortars, some depressions, some pools. They hiss, they shriek, they scold, they inhale, they cry, they wail, they moan, they howl. Those in front sing *yu*, those behind sing *yong*. A gentle breeze elicits a small harmony; a whirlwind, a great harmony. When the fierce wind ceases, all hollows become empty.\n\nHave you alone not seen their swaying, their quivering?\"\n\nThe wind does nothing, yet when it acts, the myriad hollows all rage and produce sound. The sound of the long wind is what the great wind stirs. Here, the shapes of the hollows are briefly described. Here, the differing sounds of the hollows are briefly described. Though the notes of sound vary endlessly in pitch and harmony, in loudness and softness, none fail to match what they receive and each finds its proper place. *Ji* means to cease. When the fierce wind blows, the hollows are full; when it ceases, they are empty. Though fullness and emptiness differ, in each finding its proper place they are the same. *Tiaotiao* and *daodao* describe the appearance of movement. Though the sounds of things differ, and the movements of their forms differ as well, in attaining equality they are one. Is *tiaotiao* alone right and *daodao* alone wrong?\n\nZiyou said, \"The *earthly pipes* are simply the myriad hollows; the *human pipes* are simply the bamboo flutes. May I ask about the *Heavenly pipes*?\"\n\nZiqi said, \"The *Heavenly pipes* blow through the myriad differences, yet make them return to themselves. All take what is their own—who is it that stirs them to anger?\"\n\nThese are the *Heavenly pipes*. Do the *Heavenly pipes* require some other thing? They are simply the hollows, the bamboo flutes, and all that joins the realm of the living, gathering to form a single Heaven. Nonbeing cannot generate being; being, before it is born, cannot be the source of life.\"",

      "translated_text": "Then who is it that gives life to life? It simply arises of itself, spontaneously. It arises of itself—it is not that I give life to it. Since I cannot give life to things, and things cannot give life to me, then I am self-so. Being self-so, it is called \"Heavenly-so.\" It is Heavenly-so, not something made, and thus we speak of it as Heaven. [Speaking of it as Heaven] is to clarify its spontaneity—how could it refer to the azure vault? Yet some say the *Heavenly pipes* command things to follow them. But if Heaven itself cannot possess itself, how could it possess things? Thus, \"Heaven\" is but the collective name for the myriad things. None is uniquely Heaven; who then masters and commands things? Therefore, things each arise of themselves, with no source from which they emerge—this is the Dao of Heaven. All things attain their own nature—who stirs them to anger, making them so?\n\nThis further clarifies the *Heavenly pipes*.\n\nThe great wisdom is leisurely, the small wisdom is meddlesome.\nThe great words blaze forth, the small words chatter on.\nIn sleep, their spirits intertwine; in waking, their forms open.\nThey engage in contention, daily battling with their hearts.\nSome are vague, some are guarded, some are secretive.\nSmall fears make them tremble; great fears leave them dazed.\nTheir outbursts are like the release of a crossbow—this is what it means to wield judgments.\nTheir restraints are like sworn oaths—this is what it means to cling to victory.\nTheir decline is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily decay.\nTheir immersion in their pursuits cannot be reversed.\nTheir weariness is like a sealed vessel, speaking of their aging and stagnation.\nThe heart near death cannot be revived.\nJoy and anger, sorrow and delight, worry and sighing, change and fear, frivolity and indulgence, coquetry and affectation—\npleasure arises from emptiness, steam gives rise to mushrooms.\nDay and night they alternate before us, yet none knows where they sprout.\nEnough! Enough! Morning and evening, this is how they come to be—this is how life arises!\n\nHere lies the difference in knowledge.\nHere lies the difference in speech.\nHere lies the difference between waking and sleeping.\nHere lies the difference in interaction.\nHere lies the difference in fear and trembling.\nHere lies the difference in movement and stillness.\nTheir decay and daily decline are like this.\nTheir immersion leading to irreversible change is like this.\nTheir drowning in desire, aging and growing ever more stagnant, is like this.\nTheir pursuit of profit and disregard for calamity, secretly plotting to achieve their aims, is like this.\nHere lie the differences in nature and disposition.\nHere lie the differences in the vicissitudes of affairs.\n\nFrom this point onward, we have briefly set forth the boundlessness of the *Heavenly pipes*; from this point downward, we clarify the spontaneity of the boundless.\n\nThings each are self-so, not knowing why they are so yet being so. Thus, though their forms may differ endlessly, their *so-ness* is endlessly the same. Day and night alternate, the old giving way to the new. The myriad things of Heaven and Earth transform and renew daily, advancing with time—what thing gives rise to them? They are simply self-so, spontaneously so. This speaks of their self-arising. It is not that without the other, I would not exist; nor is it that without me, there would be nothing to take. This is close, yet one does not know what compels it. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found. One may act in good faith, yet not see its form—it has essence but no form.\n\nThat is spontaneity. Spontaneity gives life to me; I give life to myself spontaneously. Thus, spontaneity is simply my own spontaneity—how distant could it be? All things, in their multitude, are simply thus of themselves; they are not made to be so by one another. Therefore, if one leaves them be, principle will arrive of itself. The myriad things and their myriad dispositions take different paths and make different choices, as if some true master made them so. Yet when one seeks the traces of this true master, one finds nothing in the end. This makes clear that all things are spontaneous, with nothing making them so.\n\nConsider one who walks: he trusts that he can walk, yet does not see the form that enables him to do so. His disposition matches the thing, so the form is not separately perceived. The face, the nine orifices, the six viscera—all are complete and present. With whom should I be intimate? Do you delight in all of them? Or do you have a preference? Are they all like servants? Are the servants insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns being lord and servant? Or is there a true lord present? Whether one seeks to grasp its essence or not, it neither adds to nor detracts from its reality. Entrust it to spontaneity, and all will be preserved. It simply preserves itself. If one delights in all, then there is partiality. With partiality, one cannot preserve all completely. Thus, it is not by delighting in them that they are preserved, nor by acting that they arise of themselves. If one were partial to all, then intentions would exceed their proper bounds, high and low would encroach upon one another, and none would be servants. If servants’ talents are not content with the role of servants, they are lost. Thus, the principle of lord and servant, high and low, outer and inner, is the natural pattern of Heaven—how could it be the doing of a true person?\n\nServants simply each fulfill their proper role; this is not insufficient for mutual governance. Mutual governance is like the hands, feet, ears, and eyes, the four limbs and hundred parts, each having its function and alternating in their use. Those whom the times deem worthy become lords; those whose talents do not match the age become servants. Just as Heaven is naturally high and Earth naturally low, the head naturally resides above and the feet naturally reside below—how could there be alternation? Though there is no error in their proper places, they are necessarily so of themselves. If one entrusts them to their own nature, then it is not artificial.\n\nAll who attain their true nature and employ their own spontaneity, though they be mere menials, still do not heed slander or praise but rest content in their work. Thus, whether known or unknown, all remain as they are. But if one opens the path of vain hopes, with inferiors encroaching upon superiors, things lose their reality, people forget their roots, and in the space between slander and praise, they lose their bearings.\n\nOnce one receives this completed form, one does not perish until its end. Locked in mutual conflict and wear, one’s conduct rushes forward like a galloping horse, yet none can stop it—is this not lamentable? Toiling one’s whole life without seeing success, wearily exhausted yet not knowing where one is headed—is this not sorrowful?",

      "translated_text": "People call it \"not dying,\" but what benefit is there? The form dissolves, and the heart follows suit—can this not be called great sorrow? Is human life inherently so deluded? Am I alone deluded, or are there others who are not?\n\nEach nature has its allotted portion. Thus, the wise guard their knowledge to the end, while the foolish cling to their folly until death—who can alter their nature midway? The myriad beings, in their teeming multitudes, clash in discord and accord, each trusting their own partial views and indulging their own conduct, none able to turn back. This—compared to what the common people deem sorrowful—is indeed sorrowful. Yet the common people never regard it as sorrow, for it is the nature of their nature. Each thing follows its own nature—what in the world is worth grieving over?\n\nThe passions of things know no bounds; those who know contentment are few. Thus, having attained this, they do not stop but pursue that instead. All exhaust themselves their whole lives, never sating their ambitions, ceasing only in death. Therefore, their success is never seen. All things, driven by their preferences, wear out their bodies until they are weary and spent, yet do not know where their loves ultimately lead! In truth, this is no different from death.\n\nWhen heart and form race together, exhausted yet unable to turn back, this surpasses what the common people deem sorrowful—here lies the greatest sorrow. Yet the common people never take this as sorrow, so what they sorrow over is not truly sorrowful.\n\nAll the matters above occur without knowing why they occur—hence, delusion. Now, those who do not know all do not know how they know yet know nonetheless; the living all do not know how they live yet live nonetheless. Though the myriad things differ, in that their living does not arise from knowing, there is no difference—thus, none in the world are not deluded.\n\nIf one follows their completed heart and takes it as teacher, who alone would lack a teacher? Why must one know the succession of ages to possess it? Even the foolish have it! To have affirmations and negations before the heart is complete is like arriving in Yue today when you set out yesterday. Thus, to take what is not as what is.\n\nTo take what is not as what is, even the divine Yu could not comprehend—what can I alone do? The heart’s sufficiency to govern the body’s functions is called the completed heart. If one takes their completed heart as teacher, then each person has their own teacher. Each person having their own teacher, they entrust themselves to it and find it fitting.\n\nTo use the completed to replace the incomplete is not knowledge—it is the heart’s own attainment. Thus, even the foolish take their completed heart as teacher, unwilling to employ what they deem deficient and abandon what they deem sufficient. If you arrive in Yue today, how did you get there yesterday? Before the heart is complete, how do affirmations and negations arise?\n\nThose who clarify affirmations and negations cannot be without them, so the perfected person accords with both. In principle, there is no affirmation or negation, yet the deluded take them as existing—this is taking what is not as what is. Once the deluded heart is formed, even sages cannot dispel it, so one entrusts it to its natural state without forcing knowledge.\n\nWords are not like the wind’s blowing; speakers have their words. Yet what they say is not yet settled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? Do they differ from the chirping of fledglings, or is there discernment? Or is there no discernment? Each has their own say, hence differing from the wind. I deem it right, while another deems it wrong; what another deems right, I deem wrong—thus, it is not settled.\n\nNot settled because of the partiality of their perspectives. Do they have words? Yet these are insufficient to settle anything. Do they have no words? Yet they already have words based on themselves. Words and the chirping of fledglings reach the same end—whether there is discernment or not is truly unsettled.\n\nThe world’s sentiments need not be the same, yet their words cannot differ, so affirmations and negations arise in profusion, with no settled ground. Where is the Dao concealed to have truth and falsity? Where are words concealed to have affirmation and negation? Where does the Dao go yet not abide? Where do words abide yet remain untrustworthy?\n\nThe Dao is concealed in petty accomplishments; words are concealed in florid embellishments. Hence, there are the affirmations and negations of the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other negates and negating what the other affirms. To affirm what they negate and negate what they affirm, nothing surpasses using illumination.\n\nWhere is the Dao not present? How are words concealed to have truth and falsity, giving rise to the names of affirmation and negation? All abide. All are permissible.\n\nPetty accomplishments and florid embellishments naturally conceal the Dao, yet the Dao cannot be concealed. Thus, truth and falsity, affirmation and negation arise in florid embellishments yet cease in proper accord; they appear in petty accomplishments yet vanish in great wholeness.\n\nConfucians and Mohists alternately affirm and negate each other, yet all in the world are Confucians and Mohists. Thus, the hundred schools arise, each prizing their own views, never departing from their own domains.\n\nThose who have affirmations and negations are what the Confucians and Mohists affirm; those who have no affirmations and no negations are what the Confucians and Mohists negate. Now, to affirm what the Confucians and Mohists negate and negate what they affirm is to illuminate the absence of affirmations and negations. To illuminate the absence of affirmations and negations, nothing surpasses using the Confucians and Mohists to mutually clarify each other.\n\nWhen mutually clarifying, what they affirm is not affirmed, and what they negate is not negated. Not negated, there is no negation; not affirmed, there is no affirmation. Nothing is not \"that\"; nothing is not \"this.\" From \"that,\" one does not see; from knowing, one knows. Thus, it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also relies on that.\" This is the theory of \"that\" and \"this\" arising together.\n\nYet even as they arise, they die; even as they die, they arise. Even as they are permissible, they are not; even as they are not, they are permissible. Following affirmation, following negation; following negation, following affirmation. Therefore, the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates it by the heavens—this too is following affirmation.\n\nAll things deem themselves right, hence nothing is not \"this.\"",

      "translated_text": "All things deem others \"that,\" hence nothing is not \"that.\" Nothing is not \"that,\" then the world has no \"this\"; nothing is not \"this,\" then the world has no \"that.\" Without \"that\" and without \"this,\" this is called the profound unity.\n\nThe partiality of things arises from their failure to see what others see, knowing only what they themselves know. Knowing only what they themselves know, they deem themselves right. Deeming themselves right, they regard others as wrong. Thus it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also relies on that\"—\"that\" and \"this\" arise in mutual dependence.\n\nThe transformations of life and death are like the progression of the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer. Though the states of life and death differ, in each finding peace in what they encounter, they are one. Now, the living insist that life is life, while the dead insist that life is death—thus there is no life. The living insist that death is death, while the dead insist that death is life—thus there is no death. Without life and without death, without affirmation and without negation, the debates of Confucians and Mohists are what I cannot align with. Yet when each abides in its own lot, that is what I cannot oppose.\n\nThe one who embraces openness follows the world’s affirmations and negations yet remains free of them. Thus, not proceeding by the path of affirmation and negation, yet ensuring no error in either, is simply to illuminate their natural state without imposing anything. This is also \"that,\" and \"that\" is also \"this.\" \"That\" has its own affirmations and negations, and \"this\" has its own affirmations and negations. Is there truly a \"that\" and \"this\"? Or is there truly no \"that\" and \"this\"? Where \"that\" and \"this\" find no counterpart, this is called the pivot of the Dao. Once the pivot is grasped at the center of the ring, it can respond endlessly. Affirmation is one endlessness, and negation is another endlessness. Thus it is said: \"Nothing compares to illumination.\"\n\nI, too, am deemed \"that\" by \"that.\" \"That,\" too, deems itself right. \"This,\" too, deems itself right and \"that\" wrong; \"that,\" too, deems itself right and \"this\" wrong. Within each, there is one affirmation and one negation. Now, if one calls \"that\" \"that,\" yet \"that\" still deems itself right; if one calls \"this\" \"this,\" yet \"this\" is still deemed \"that\" by \"that.\" Thus, the presence or absence of \"that\" and \"this\" remains undetermined.\n\nA counterpart is an opposition. \"That\" and \"this\" are opposites, yet the sage harmonizes both. Thus, the one without intent merges with things and never sets up oppositions in the world. The pivot is the essential point. Abiding in this essential point and meeting the profound extremity, one responds to the boundless. Affirmation and negation cycle endlessly, hence they are called a ring. The center of the ring is empty. Now, if one takes affirmation and negation as the ring and attains its center, one attains neither affirmation nor negation. Without affirmation and without negation, one can respond to all affirmations and negations. Since affirmations and negations are endless, the response is also endless.\n\nThe world deems itself right and others wrong, hence one affirmation and one negation proceed endlessly. Only the one who enters emptiness and attains the center remains unbound, riding it in freedom. To illustrate the non-finger with a finger is not as good as illustrating the non-finger with a non-finger. To illustrate the non-horse with a horse is not as good as illustrating the non-horse with a non-horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nTo deem oneself right and others wrong is the common tendency of \"that\" and \"this.\" Thus, if I use my finger to illustrate \"that\" finger, then \"that\" finger alone becomes a non-finger to my finger—this is illustrating the non-finger with a finger. If, in turn, \"that\" finger is used to illustrate my finger, then my finger becomes a non-finger to \"that\" finger—this is illustrating the non-finger with a non-finger. To clarify the absence of affirmation and negation, nothing compares to reciprocal illustration. Through reciprocal illustration, \"that\" and \"this\" are alike in deeming themselves right and alike in deeming each other wrong. Alike in deeming each other wrong, the world has no right; alike in deeming themselves right, the world has no wrong.\n\nHow can this be demonstrated? If affirmation were truly affirmation, the world would have no one to negate it. If negation were truly negation, the world would have no one to affirm it. Now, with no fixed ground for affirmation or negation, they are confused and chaotic. This shows that these petty distinctions are merely each trusting their own partial views and aligning in uniformity. Looking up and looking down, all are like this. Thus, the perfected person knows that heaven and earth are one finger and the myriad things are one horse. Therefore, they abide in vast tranquility, and heaven, earth, and the myriad things each rest in their lot, merging in self-contentment without affirmation or negation.\n\nIs it permissible? Is it not permissible? What is permissible to oneself is called permissible; what is not permissible to oneself is called not permissible. The Dao is completed in its course, and things are so called by others. There is that by which it is permissible, and that by which it is not; there is that by which it is so, and that by which it is not. How is it so? It is so in being so. How is it not so? It is not so in not being so. How is it permissible? It is permissible in being permissible. How is it not permissible? It is not permissible in not being permissible.\n\nThings inherently have that by which they are so, and inherently have that by which they are permissible. Nothing is not so, and nothing is not permissible. Thus, I raise the examples of a stalk and a pillar, of an ugly woman and Xi Shi, of the expansive, the strange, the deceitful, and the bizarre—all are united as one. In their division, they are completed; in their completion, they are destroyed. All things are without completion and destruction, for they are united as one. There is nothing that is not completed, nothing that is not so. Each is so in its own way, each is permissible in its own way.\n\nA stalk lies horizontally, while a pillar stands vertically; an ugly woman is repulsive, while Xi Shi is beautiful. What is meant by equality is not necessarily equal in form or identical in measure! Thus, I raise the examples of vertical and horizontal, beauty and ugliness, the expansive, the strange, the deceitful, and the bizarre—each is so in its own way, each is permissible in its own way. Though their principles are myriad, their natures share the same attainment. Thus it is said: \"The Dao unites all as one.\"",

He then said, \"Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased. The names and realities remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were put to use—this, too, is following what is so. Therefore, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the balance of heaven, which is called \"walking two paths.\"\n\nDoes the enlightened one labor the spirit to achieve unity? If one labors the spirit to achieve unity, it is not to be relied upon, for it differs not from those who fail to unite. It is no different from the monkeys' delusion, affirming themselves by what they prefer. Without partiality, one entrusts it to spontaneous balance and leaves it at that. Entrusting the world’s right and wrong to this principle:\n\nThe ancients’ knowledge reached its limit. To what limit? Some held that things had never yet begun to exist—this is the limit, the exhaustion, beyond which nothing can be added! Next were those who acknowledged the existence of things but had not yet imposed boundaries. Next were those who acknowledged boundaries but had not yet introduced right and wrong. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao; the diminishment of the Dao is the formation of attachment. Is there truly completion and diminishment? Or is there truly neither completion nor diminishment?\n\nIf there is completion and diminishment, then Master Zhao’s zither playing exists. If there is neither completion nor diminishment, then Master Zhao’s not playing the zither exists. Master Zhao’s zither playing, Shi Kuang’s wielding the baton, and Master Hui’s leaning against the parasol tree—these three were among the most eminent in knowledge, and so their stories are recorded at life’s end. Yet because they were fond of their ways, they differed from others. Their fondness led them to seek clarity, but what they sought to clarify was not truly clarifiable, so they ended in the obscurity of \"hard and white.\" And Master Zhao’s son spent his life weaving the threads of his father’s art, yet achieved nothing. If this can be called completion, then though I have achieved nothing, it too can be called completion. If this cannot be called completion, then neither things nor I have achieved anything.\n\nThus, the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage contemplates. Not employing such distinctions but lodging them in the ordinary—this is called \"illuminating through clarity.\" This is to forget heaven and earth, to leave behind the myriad things, to look outward without examining the cosmos, to look inward without perceiving one’s own body. Thus, one is vast and unburdened, moving with things and responding to all without exception.\n\nThough one may not yet have forgotten everything, one can still forget the distinction between self and other. Though one may not yet have forgotten self and other, one can still forget their right and wrong. Without the Dao’s diminishment, emotions would not be partial, and attachment would not form. Failing to forget attachment and relinquish self-interest, one cannot achieve the profound unity of self and other. This is not perfection.\n\nTo know neither existence nor nonexistence—this is the ultimate limit.",

      "translated_text": "The myriad sounds cannot all be enumerated. Thus, when blowing pipes or plucking strings, though the fingers may move intricately, many sounds are still lost. Those who grasp the flute or strike the zither seek to manifest sound, yet in manifesting sound, sound is lost; in not manifesting sound, sound remains whole. Thus, to strive for completion and thereby diminish it—this is how Zhaowen plays the zither. Not to strive and thus remain undiminished—this is how Zhaowen does not play the zither. \"Almost\" means \"exhaustion.\" These three masters all sought to clarify what they themselves did not understand, thus exhausting their knowledge and depleting their thoughts, their bodies wearied and their spirits fatigued. Some leaned on their staffs and dozed, others rested against a tree and closed their eyes. They relied on their vigor to endure, for without it, they would have succumbed long ago.\n\nThese three spoke only of what they themselves understood, considering themselves distinct from the multitude. They sought to display their understanding to others, desiring that all align with their own preferences. This is like playing the reed pipes to an ox. Since others ultimately do not understand, their own Dao and techniques end in obscurity. Zhaowen’s son, in continuing his father’s legacy, likewise failed to achieve completion. Though these three sought to enlighten others, those others ultimately did not understand, and so they accomplished nothing in their lifetimes. If these three could be called accomplished, then even my own lack of accomplishment could be called accomplishment. All things illuminate themselves but do not illuminate others. If, because others do not understand, one deems them unaccomplished, then all things would be without accomplishment.\n\nThus, the sage does not display this to dazzle that, nor abandons the self to pursue things. Following and entrusting them to their own natures, each attains its proper capacity in obscurity. Thus, all things achieve completion without omission. Now, these three sought to display their own preferences to others—was this not delusional?\n\nThe sage is without self. Thus, when faced with the dazzling confusion of doubt, they chart and contain it; when confronted with the vast and strange, they unify and harmonize it. They allow all differences to rest in what they naturally find restful, so that the multitude does not lose what they deem right. Thus, the sage is not employed by things, and the use of all things is fully realized. When all things employ themselves, who is right and who is wrong? Therefore, even in the face of unbridled transformations and strange deviations, bending to follow them and entrusting them to their own use, though their uses may differ in ten thousand ways, all becomes clearly self-evident.\n\nNow, suppose I were to speak here—how would I know if it is of the same kind as this? Or not of the same kind? Whether of the same kind or not, all are of the same kind when taken together, and thus no different from that. Nevertheless, let me attempt to speak:\n\nThere is a beginning; there is that which precedes the beginning; there is that which precedes what precedes the beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is that which precedes non-being; there is that which precedes what precedes non-being. Suddenly there is being and non-being, yet we do not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly so. Now, I have already spoken, yet I do not know if what I have spoken is truly speaking or truly not speaking.\n\nIf I say there is no right or wrong, how do I know if this is of the same kind as those who say there is right and wrong, or not? If I wish to call it the same kind, then I take non-being as right, while they take non-being as wrong—thus, it is not the same kind. Yet though this right and wrong differ, they are still not free from right and wrong, and thus are of the same kind as that. Therefore, whether of the same kind or not, all are of the same kind when taken together, and thus no different from that.\n\nIf one wishes to avoid such great dissimilarity, nothing is better than having no mind. Having already relinquished right and wrong, one must further relinquish the act of relinquishing. Relinquishing the relinquishing again and again until there is no relinquishing left, then there is no relinquishing and nothing not relinquished, and right and wrong vanish of themselves. The ultimate principle is without words; to speak is to fall into categories. Thus, I tentatively entrust these words to this purpose.\n\nIf there is a beginning, there is an end. To speak of no end or beginning and to equalize life and death—those who equalize have not yet equaled as well as those who do not equalize and yet are naturally equal. This is to forget even the act of equalizing.\n\nWhere there is being, beauty and ugliness, right and wrong all arise. Where there is non-being but one does not yet know the absence of absence, right and wrong, love and hate still linger in the heart. Even knowing the absence of absence, one has not yet ceased knowing. To utterly forget this knowing—only then does one suddenly begin to comprehend nothingness. In comprehending nothingness, heaven and earth, the myriad things, self and other, right and wrong—all become clearly resolved.\n\nTo say there is no right or wrong is itself to speak. Yet not knowing whether this speaking is being or non-being—only then is the mind utterly unburdened, without the slightest trace of dust.\n\nIn the world, nothing is smaller than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing lives shorter than an infant who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived. Heaven and earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, can there be speech? Since we have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. From this point onward, even the most skilled mathematician cannot arrive at a number, much less an ordinary person! Thus, from non-being to being, one reaches three—how much more so from being to being! Do not proceed further; rest here!\n\nWhen things are compared by form, Mount Tai is greater than an autumn hair. But if each abides by its own nature and attains its limit, then a large form is not excessive, nor is a small form insufficient. If each is sufficient in its nature, then an autumn hair is not merely small in its smallness, nor is Mount Tai merely great in its greatness. If sufficiency in nature is deemed greatness, then nothing in the world is greater than an autumn hair. If sufficiency in nature is not deemed greatness, then even Mount Tai may be called small. Thus, it is said: \"In the world, nothing is smaller than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small.\" If Mount Tai is small, then nothing in the world is great; if an autumn hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Without small or great, without long life or early death, the cicada does not envy the great Peng tree but rejoices in its own contentment; the sparrow does not prize the heavenly pond but takes pride in its own sufficiency.",

      "translated_text": "If one is sufficient in Heaven’s natural endowment and at peace with one’s nature and fate, then even heaven and earth are not long-lived enough to surpass me in birth, nor are the myriad things so different as to differ from my own attainment. If heaven and earth are born, why should they not be born alongside me? If the myriad things attain, why should they not attain as one with me?\n\nThe myriad things in their myriad forms all find sufficiency in themselves, and their attainment is one. Once one has attained oneness, there is no principle left to speak of. Names and terms arise from a lack of clarity. Some things cannot clarify their own oneness and thus pursue others through these terms, so they use the term \"one\" to correct them. Once they have termed it \"one,\" they have already resorted to speech. To speak of oneness with speech, when oneness is not speech, is to make oneness and speech two. Oneness is already one, yet speech makes it two; with one and two, how can this not be called three? To speak of oneness with a single word is still to produce three—how much more so when tracing its branches and all things’ distinct names? Even with skilled calculation, none can keep account of them.\n\nThus, those who term oneness do not differ from others, while those who forget oneness remain silent and attain oneness of themselves. Each abiding in what it can do is most fitting. The Dao has never had boundaries, nor has speech ever had constancy; it is for this reason that divisions arise. Let me speak of these divisions: there is left, there is right, there are relationships, there are duties, there are distinctions, there are debates, there is competition, there is contention—these are called the eight virtues.\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate; regarding the *Spring and Autumn* and the records of former kings’ aspirations, the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, where there are divisions, there are also non-divisions; where there is debate, there is also non-debate.\n\nSomeone asks: \"Why is this?\" The answer: \"The sage embraces it, while the multitude debates it to show one another. Thus it is said: debate arises from what is not seen.\" Obscure yet omnipresent, when spoken of in terms of \"this\" and \"that,\" right and wrong have no fixed ground. The Dao is unbounded, so the myriad things freely occupy their own domains, each differing in what suits them. Each thing has its principle, each affair its fittingness. They are grouped by kind and distinguished by category. Pursuing together is called competition; opposing debate is called contention. Briefly distinguishing them, we have these eight virtues.\n\nWhat lies beyond the six directions refers to what is outside the nature and lot of things. Though principle exists even in what lies beyond things’ natures, since it is not within their nature and lot, it does not move the sage, and so the sage does not discuss it. If he were to discuss it, it would be like leading the myriad things to learn what they cannot. Thus, he does not discuss what lies beyond, and the eight divisions are all subsumed in self-sufficiency. He sets forth their natures and lets them rest in them, following their completed traces and congealing at the ultimate of what is fitting, without clinging to what he deems right to condemn others.\n\nEach thing divides itself, each affair distinguishes itself. To desire to divide and distinguish them by oneself is to fail to see their self-distinction. The sage harbors no such intent; he does not see their self-debate, so he debates what he knows to show them. The great Dao is not named; great debate does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage is not aggressive. When the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao; when speech is debating, it does not reach; when benevolence is constant, it is not all-encompassing; when integrity is pure, it is not trustworthy; when courage is aggressive, it does not succeed. These five, though not accomplished, nearly approach the proper direction.\n\nEntrusting it to self-naming, there is nothing to name. It distinguishes itself. Existing without attachment, it preserves itself. The utterly sufficient one is not affected by things’ comings and goings, so there is nowhere to harbor modesty or fullness. Going nowhere without compliance, it can traverse no peril without going. Using this to clarify that, both this and that are lost. It cannot reach their self-division.\n\nThings have no constant attachment, and constant attachment is never all-encompassing. Brightly pure integrity is merely the greed of one who covets fame—it is not true integrity. Aggressive, contrary courage is detested by all under heaven, leaving no ground to stand on. These five all harm what is fitting by acting, unable to rest in their original nature and endlessly seeking what lies beyond. Seeking what cannot be sought is like trying to learn the square from the round or a fish longing to be a bird. Though one may aspire to the phoenix and emulate the sun and moon, the closer one draws to them, the farther one strays from reality; the more one learns, the more one loses one’s nature. Thus, when things are equalized, the burden of partial preferences is gone.\n\nTherefore, to know to stop at what one does not know is perfection. Who knows the debate that does not speak, the Dao that is not the Dao? If there is one who can know this, it is called the Heavenly Storehouse. Pour into it without filling it; draw from it without depleting it; yet one does not know whence it comes—this is called preserving the light. What one does not know lies outside the nature and lot of things. Thus, stopping within what one knows is perfection. Vast and all-embracing, it entrusts everything to its course.\n\nThe mind of the perfected one is like a mirror: it responds but does not store, and so remains open and free from the changes of fullness and emptiness. The coming of the ultimate principle is naturally without trace. Allowing it to clarify itself, its light is never exhausted.\n\nThus, long ago, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I face south, I cannot put it aside. What is the reason?\" Shun said: \"Those three lords dwell among the mugwort and reeds. Why can you not put it aside? Long ago, ten suns appeared together, and the myriad things were all illuminated—how much more so one whose virtue surpasses the sun!\" Yao’s way of peaceful compliance was not yet vast, so he listened to court affairs without joy. He sought to entrust the principle of clarity and equality to the great sage, so he posed this strange question to elicit a response.\n\nWhat things find peaceful has no baseness, so the mugwort and reeds are the wondrous abode of those three lords. When the doubled brightness ascends to heaven, the six directions are all illuminated, and there is no mugwort or reed that is not bathed in light.",

      "translated_text": "This knot remains unresolved.\n\nWang Ni said, \"The Perfected Person is divine! Though great marshes burn, they cannot make him hot; though the Milky Way freezes, they cannot make him cold; though swift thunder splits mountains, it cannot harm him; though whirlwinds shake the seas, they cannot startle him. One such as this rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Death and life bring no change to him—how much less the mere tips of benefit and harm!\"\n\nWithout intent, yet nothing is not accommodated. The one whose spirit is whole and complete, whose body merges with things, though traversing the most extreme changes, has never ceased to be himself. Thus, nothing lingers or clings in his breast. Borrowing things to act, it is not he who moves. Identifying with change as his very body, death and life are as one. Day and night pass without death or life—how much less can benefit and harm disturb his mind?\n\nJu Quezi asked Chang Wuzi, \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao. Where there is no speech, he speaks; where there is speech, he does not speak. And he roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered these wild and reckless words, but I believe they are the practice of the wondrous Dao. How close do you think I am to understanding?\"\n\nChang Wuzi said, \"Even the Yellow Emperor would be dazzled by such words—how could Confucius know them! Moreover, you are far too hasty in your calculations. Seeing an egg, you demand a crowing rooster; seeing a slingshot, you seek a roasted owl. I have spoken to you recklessly—why not listen to them recklessly as well?\n\n\"Stand beside the sun and moon, embrace the cosmos, and let your lips meet in harmony. Why set store by the murky and turbid, or vie for honor? The multitude toil and strive, while the sage appears foolish and dull, blending the myriad ages into a single purity. All things are thus, and with this they are mutually enfolded. Affairs come of themselves, and principle responds of itself—it is not a matter of following and engaging with them. Proceeding straightforwardly without seeking to avoid or approach, not rejoicing in attainment nor angered by direct seizure—this is the solitary perfection.\n\n\"All that bears a name is not what I speak of. Each calls itself by its own name, so there is no 'that' with speech and no 'this' without speech. Whatever is not true nature is but dust and grime. Things have their spontaneity, principles have their ultimate. Following them directly, one merges obscurely of itself—no words are needed. Thus, to speak is reckless, and to hear is dazzled. Even the Yellow Emperor could not prevent all things from harboring attachments and being dazzled to the end. Therefore, the sage entrusts things to the realm beyond dust and grime, mysteriously uniting with what lies beyond sight and hearing. Illumined by Heaven, he does not oppose with calculation; released to spontaneity, he does not force clarity.\n\n\"Now, Ju Quezi, upon hearing reckless words, you immediately take them as the practice of the wondrous Dao. This is no different from seeing an egg and demanding the service of a rooster at dawn, or seeing a slingshot and seeking the reality of a roasted owl. Those who cannot rest in their time and follow the natural order, who probe change and seek transformation, who contemplate death while alive, who cling to 'this' to debate 'that'—all are followers of opposing calculation. To speak of it is reckless, so I have tried speaking recklessly. If you listen to reckless words as though they were correct, you are again too hasty in your calculations. So why not listen recklessly?\n\n\"Taking death and life as day and night—this is the analogy of standing beside the sun and moon. Taking the myriad things as one body—this is the metaphor of embracing the cosmos. Because there is that which is deemed base, honor and lowliness arise, and murkiness and confusion proliferate, none able to set them right. Each asserts its own rightness in its own corner. Thus, for the Dao of effortless harmony, nothing is better than setting it aside without words and entrusting it to spontaneity. Flowing smoothly, without waves or bounds—this is what it means.\n\n\"To gallop through the realm of 'this' and 'that' is to be impure. Purity is to be unadulterated. To survey the myriad ages and blend their changes—this the multitude calls 'mixed.' Thus, they toil in body and startle in mind, shunning 'that' and clinging to 'this.' Only the great sage, free of attachments, proceeds straightforwardly and becomes one with change, ever roaming in solitude. Though blending countless eons, with a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions, when the Dao acts and completes them, past and present are one. When things name them, the myriad things are as one. Nothing is not so, no time is not complete—this may be called purity.\n\n\"Nothing is not so. Enfolded, it accumulates. Accumulating 'this' over the myriad ages, the myriad ages are one 'this.' Accumulating 'so' over the myriad things, the myriad things are all 'so.' Thus, one does not know where death and life, before and after, reside, nor where victory and defeat between self and other lie.\n\n\"How do I know that delighting in life is not delusion? Death and life are one, yet one delights only in life, desiring to oppose change—how can one know this is not delusion? How do I know that hating death is not like one who, having lost his home in youth, is weak and scattered, never knowing to return? How do I know that life is not that weakness and scattering, and death not a return home—why then hate it?\n\n\"Li Ji was the daughter of the border warden of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her robe was soaked. Yet once she arrived at the king’s palace, shared his bed, and ate fine meats, she regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret their former seeking of life?\n\n\"Within a single lifetime, emotions change like this. On that day, one does not know the other—how much less can one know the change of death and life! Seeking is desiring. One who dreams of drinking wine may weep at dawn; one who dreams of weeping may go hunting at dawn. While dreaming, one does not know it is a dream.

      "translated_text": "Moreover, only after the great awakening does one know that all this was but a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves already awake, priding themselves on their keen discernment: \"This is a lord! That is a herdsman!\" How rigid! Even you and I, Confucius, are but dreams—when I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called \"perverse and strange.\" Should a great sage arise once in ten thousand generations to comprehend their meaning, it would be as if encountering him at dawn or dusk.\n\nThis is the transformation of waking and dreaming. If circumstances change, emotions differ; thus, the wishes of life and death cannot be the same. Therefore, those who delight in life when alive will delight in death when dead. Though life and death differ, each attains its wish equally—what bondage remains? From this perspective, at the moment of death, one does not know it as death but simply follows one’s inclination. The dreamer who dreams and then interprets the dream within the dream differs not at all from the waking man. In every encounter, nothing is lacking—why then fret over life while fearing death?\n\nThe great awakened are sages. They alone know that those who harbor anxieties and concerns remain unawakened. Fools, lost in their great dream, believe themselves awake, smugly distinguishing lords from herdsmen, joyfully clinging to the biases of their clan—how narrow-minded! Unable to forget words and attain spiritual understanding, they are not truly awakened. Extraordinary discourse is beyond the grasp of ordinary minds, hence called \"perverse and surpassingly strange,\" for they fail to recognize its profound liberation.\n\nThose who can shed all attachments and harmonize life and death are exceedingly rare. Even if you and I were to debate, and you prevailed over me, or I over you—would you truly be right? Would I truly be wrong? If I prevailed over you, and you did not prevail over me, would I truly be right? Would you truly be wrong? Is one of us right? Is one of us wrong? Are we both right? Are we both wrong? You and I cannot know. People are inherently shrouded in darkness—whom could I ask to judge? If I asked one who agrees with you to judge, since they agree with you, how could they judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with me to judge, since they agree with me, how could they judge rightly? If I asked one who differs from both you and me to judge, since they differ from us, how could they judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with both you and me to judge, since they agree with us, how could they judge rightly? Thus, you, I, and others cannot know one another—must we await another?\n\nYou, *er*, and *ru* all mean \"you.\" Without knowing, one speculates; without seeing, one debates. Debating brings no self-assurance, for it opposes things. Debate all day, yet darkness prevails—ultimately, none can be set right. Thus, one must leave it to self-correction. Agreement does not suffice as proof; difference does not suffice as grounds for rejection. If your view were truly right, none in the world could oppose it; if your wrong were truly wrong, none could affirm it. Now, we affirm what we agree on and reject what we differ on—yet with agreement and difference both present, right and wrong have no foundation.\n\nThus, right and wrong arise from contentiousness and rest in the balance of Heaven. Entrust them to the two courses and let self-correction prevail. Each corrects itself. Relying on another cannot set this right, so none in the world can set one another right—thus, one must leave it to self-correction to reach its end.\n\nThe \"Heavenly Boundary\" is the natural division. Right and wrong, affirmation and negation, self and other oppose one another—hence, no debate. Without debate, harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary, abide in one’s natural division, and do not rely on another to set it right. The mutual dependence of changing voices is like their independence. Harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary, follow the boundless transformation, and thus pass the years.\n\n\"What does it mean to harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary?\" It means: \"Is it so? Is it not so? So or not so.\" If \"is\" were truly \"is,\" then its difference from \"is not\" would require no debate; if \"so\" were truly \"so,\" then its difference from \"not so\" would require no debate. Forget years, forget righteousness, rouse yourself in the boundless, and lodge in the limitless. The debate over right and wrong is but a changing voice. The mutual dependence of changing voices cannot set one another right—thus, they are as if independent. Harmonize with the natural division, follow the infinite transformation, and as you proceed, the realm of right and wrong will vanish of itself, and the essence of life and destiny will be fully realized.\n\nForgetting years unites life and death; forgetting righteousness pervades right and wrong. When right and wrong, life and death dissolve into one, this is the ultimate principle. The ultimate principle flows into the infinite—thus, those who lodge in it cannot be exhausted.\n\nShadowy Doubt asked Shadow: \"Earlier you walked, now you stand; earlier you sat, now you rise. Why so lacking in constancy?\" Shadow replied: \"Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on snake scales or cicada wings? How would I know why it is so? How would I know why it is not so?\"",

      "translated_text": "Shadowy Doubt is the faint yin beyond the shadow. It speaks of the celestial mechanism moving of itself—sitting and rising without dependence. That which is without dependence and attains singularity—who could know its cause and demand its reason? If one demands its dependence and traces its origin, the tracing and demanding would be endless, ultimately reaching the state of no-dependence, and the principle of spontaneous transformation would become clear. If one were to depend on snake scales or cicada wings, the lack of constancy would not be difficult to understand. The reason it is not understood now is precisely because it does not depend on such things but transforms spontaneously.\n\nSome in the world say that Shadowy Doubt depends on the shadow, the shadow depends on form, and form depends on the Creator. Let us ask: Does the Creator exist or not? If it does not exist, how could it create things? If it does exist, it would be insufficient to account for the multitude of forms. Only by recognizing that the multitude of forms arise of themselves can one begin to speak of creation. Thus, within the realm of existing things, even Shadowy Doubt does not fail to transform spontaneously in the profound obscurity. Therefore, the Creator has no master, and each thing creates itself. Each thing creates itself without dependence—this is the norm of heaven and earth.\n\nThus, self and other are mutually arising, form and shadow emerge together; though profoundly united, they do not depend on one another. Understanding this principle will lead all things to return to their source within themselves without relying on externals. Externally, nothing is to be rejected; internally, nothing is to be prized. Thus, all things emerge in serene spontaneity, unaware of why they are born; all attain harmony, unaware of how they attain it. Now, Shadowy Doubt’s reliance on the shadow is like saying they arise together without dependence. Though myriad things gather and together complete heaven, each distinctly manifests its singularity. Therefore, Shadowy Doubt is not controlled by the shadow, nor is the shadow manipulated by form, nor is form transformed by nothingness. Thus, transformation or non-transformation, being so or not being so, following others or following oneself—all arise of themselves. How could I know their cause?\n\nThus, to follow without aiding is to allow root and branch, inner and outer, to flow harmoniously together, leaving no trace. If one clings to proximate causes and forgets their spontaneous arising, externalizes the source of things, and loses the master within, then attachment and esteem arise. Though one may seek to equalize all things, what is esteemed already resides in the heart—how could there be any leveling?\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering and joyous—a butterfly content with itself, unaware of being Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, solidly Zhou. Did Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things. Delighting in one’s own joy, acting with ease and pleasure—while dreaming of being a butterfly and unaware of Zhou, it was no different from a distinct death. Yet wherever one is, there is no lack of contentment. Thus, those who cling to life while alive will surely cling to death when dying. From this perspective, those who grieve death while alive are mistaken.\n\nSpeaking from Zhou’s perspective, he called it waking—yet it may not have been a dream. Now, not knowing the butterfly is no different from the dream’s not knowing Zhou. Each suits its momentary contentment, so there is no way to prove that the butterfly does not dream of being Zhou. There are those who doze and dream of a hundred years—how can we prove that this hundred years is not a dream in a doze? Time does not pause even briefly, and the present does not endure. Thus, yesterday’s dream has already transformed today. The change between life and death—how is it different from this? Why trouble the heart over it?\n\nTo be absorbed in one is to be unaware of the other—this is like dreaming of being a butterfly. To take it from a human perspective, in a single lifetime, the present does not know the future—this is like Lady Li. Yet fools secretly believe they know that life is joyful and death is bitter, never having heard of the transformation of things.\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Zhuangzi, \"Nourishing Life\" (Chapter Three):*\n\"My life has limits, but knowledge is without limit. To pursue the limitless with the limited is perilous! And to do so while claiming to be knowledgeable is perilous indeed! In doing good, avoid seeking fame; in doing wrong, avoid punishment. Follow the central path as your guiding principle—this can preserve the body, fulfill life, nourish kin, and complete one’s years.\n\nLife exists to be nourished and preserved, so nourishing life is the ultimate principle. Yet if nourishment exceeds its limit and harms life, it is no longer the true nourishment of life. The allotment one receives has its own limit. Lifting heavy weights and carrying light ones while the spirit and qi remain unperturbed—this is the limit of one’s strength. Yet those who crave fame and competition, even if they break their backs, still cannot satisfy their desires—this is the limitlessness of knowledge. Thus, the pursuit of knowledge arises from imbalance and vanishes into profound obscurity. Profound obscurity means following one’s utmost allotment without the slightest excess.\n\nTherefore, though bearing ten thousand jun, if it accords with one’s capacity, one suddenly forgets the weight on one’s body. Though responding to ten thousand affairs, one remains oblivious to their presence. This is the true nourishment of life. To seek limitless knowledge with a limited nature—how could one not be exhausted? Already exhausted by knowledge yet not knowing to stop, and then using knowledge to remedy it—this is nourishing yet harming, truly perilous indeed.\n\nForgetting good and evil and abiding in the center, allowing all things to act of themselves, merging obscurely with what is most fitting—thus, punishments and names stay far away, and the whole principle resides within. Following the center as one’s constant—nourishing kin with appropriateness. If one attains the center and moves in profound obscurity, then nothing is impossible. Nourishing life does not seek to exceed one’s allotment; it is merely to fulfill the principle and complete one’s years.\n\nWhen Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui, his hands touched, his shoulders leaned, his feet stepped, his knees pressed. With a *hua* sound, the blade sang *huo*—all in perfect rhythm, matching the dance of Mulberry Grove, attaining the harmony of Jing Shou’s music.\"",

The ultimate principle flows into the infinite—thus, those who lodge in it cannot be exhausted.\n\nShadowy Doubt asked Shadow: \"Earlier you walked, now you stand; earlier you sat, now you rise. Why so lacking in constancy?\" Shadow replied: \"Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on snake scales or cicada wings? How would I know why it is so? How would I know why it is not so?\"",

How has your skill reached such heights?\" He spoke of how Cook Ding seized every advantage to apply his craft, leaving no joint unloosed, fully exhausting the principle—both perfectly suiting the ox’s structure and harmonizing with the rhythm. Cook Ding set down his blade and replied, \"What your servant delights in is the Dao, which advances beyond mere skill. When I first began carving oxen, all I saw was the whole ox. After three years, I no longer saw the whole ox. Now, I encounter it with spirit rather than sight; my senses halt while my spirit moves. I rely on the natural patterns, cleaving great gaps, guiding into great cavities, following what is inherently so. Even the finest knots of sinew and bone have never once impeded me—how much less the great bones! A good cook changes his blade every year, for he cuts; an ordinary cook changes his blade every month, for he hacks. My blade has now endured nineteen years, carving several thousand oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. For where the joints have spaces, and the blade has no thickness—entering with what has no thickness into what has space, how vast is the room for the blade to move! Thus, after nineteen years, my blade’s edge remains as if newly whetted. Yet whenever I come to a complex cluster, I see the difficulty, grow wary with caution, focus my gaze, slow my action, and move the blade with utmost subtlety. Then, with a *huo* sound, the ox falls apart, unaware of its death, like earth crumbling to the ground.

Those who gathered there must have been moved to speak when they had no wish to speak, to weep when they had no wish to weep. This is fleeing from Heaven and betraying one’s nature, forgetting what one has received—what the ancients called \"the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.\" When he came, Master, it was timely; when he departed, it was in accord. To rest content in timeliness and dwell in accord is to be beyond the reach of sorrow and joy—what the ancients called \"the Great Release.\"\n\nThe perfected person has no fixed emotions, merely joining the crowd in lamentation, and thus this was fitting. The nature one receives from Heaven has its own proper measure; it cannot be escaped, nor can it be augmented. To flee from Heaven’s principle and multiply worldly attachments, to let sorrow and joy pass through one’s heart, is to bind the spirit in suffering, no different from torture or punishment. The enlightened of old held such views.\n\nLife arises in its time; principle dictates death. Sorrow and joy arise from loss and gain. But the one who has attained profound communion with change is at peace in every moment, at home in every circumstance, darkly one with the workings of creation. Then nothing is not oneself—what gain or loss, what life or death could there be? Thus, following what one has received, sorrow and joy find no place to settle.\n\nTo take what is bound as \"suspended\" is to see that what is unbound is \"released from suspension.\" Released from suspension, the true nature of life and destiny is attained. This is the essence of nourishing life.\n\nA finger may be exhausted in feeding the flame, but the fire is passed on, never knowing its end. \"Exhausted\" means used up; \"feeding the flame\" is like the earlier fuel. The earlier fuel is consumed by the finger, and when the principle of the earlier fuel is exhausted, the fire is transmitted and does not die. The heart receives nourishment within, so life continues without end. This makes clear that nourishing life is the very means by which life lives.\n\nTime does not come again; the present does not pause even once. Thus human life is but a single breath, a single moment of attainment. The breath just past is not the breath now; thus nourishment is received and life continues. The earlier flame is not the later flame; thus the fuel is consumed and the fire is passed on. The fire is passed on and life continues—this comes from nourishing to its utmost.

      "translated_text": "Confucius said, \"Where are you going?\"\nYan Hui replied, \"I am going to the state of Wei.\"\nConfucius asked, \"What will you do there?\"\nYan Hui said, \"I have heard that the lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats his state lightly and does not recognize his faults. He treats the lives of his people as of little worth, and the dead are measured by the state as if they were marshland—like reeds, the people have nowhere to turn. I once heard you say, ‘Leave a well-ordered state; go to a disordered one. The gate of a physician sees many illnesses.’ I wish to apply what I have heard and reflect on what I might do, hoping that the state may yet be cured.\"\n\nOne who mingles with others cannot depart from them. Yet the vicissitudes of the human world differ in every age, and only those who are without fixed intent and do not rely on their own judgment can adapt to change without bearing its burdens. They do not share the desires of the people.\n\nNow, one who rules others acts only by riding upon them. In anger, corpses lie strewn and blood flows; in pleasure, carriages and caps fill the roads. Thus the ruler’s use of the state cannot be taken lightly. None dare remonstrate with him. He treats life as if it were of no account, leading the entire state into the realm of death, beyond numbering, regarding them as mere grass or mustard seeds. They have nowhere to turn.\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas! You are likely to go and be punished! The Dao does not tolerate杂乱. When it is杂乱, it becomes多; when it is多, it becomes扰; when it is扰, it brings忧, and忧 cannot be saved. The utmost person of old first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. If what is established within oneself is not yet settled, how can one have leisure to attend to the conduct of a violent man? The Dao is insufficient to save their troubles.\n\nIt is fitting to find the right person. If one does not find the right person, then even if a hundred physicians guard the illness, it will only deepen doubt and fail to bring even a single cure. If one does not respond to things with an empty mind but instead exhausts their thoughts in reckless action, it shows that what is established within themselves is not yet settled.\n\nOnly by setting aside knowledge to nurture the true, entrusting the wondrous to the talents of the multitude, attributing merit and fame to others while keeping worries and concerns far from oneself—only then can one attend to the conduct of a violent man.\n\nMoreover, do you also know whence virtue’s dissipation and knowledge’s emergence arise? Virtue dissipates for the sake of fame; knowledge emerges from contention. Fame is that by which people vie; knowledge is the instrument of contention. Both are inauspicious tools, not the means to fulfill one’s conduct.\n\nThe reason virtue flows away is pride in fame; the reason knowledge spreads recklessly is contention over goodness. Even Jie and Zhi, in what they prized, sought nothing but fame and goodness. Fame and wisdom are what the world employs, yet when fame arises, contention follows; when wisdom is used, strife emerges. Thus only by abandoning fame and knowledge can one’s conduct be fulfilled.\n\nMoreover, thick virtue and steadfast trust do not yet reach others’ *qi*; a reputation for non-contention does not yet reach others’ hearts. To forcibly display the language of benevolence and righteousness, compass and square, before a violent man is to make others resent what is beautiful in oneself—this is called ‘harming others.’ One who harms others will surely be harmed in return. You are likely to be harmed by others.\n\nIf one merely delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, what need is there to seek distinction? If you do not issue commands, the lords and dukes will surely ride upon others to vie in cleverness. Your eyes will be dazzled, your complexion will become placid, your mouth will scheme, your demeanor will take shape, and your heart will be formed. This is like using fire to save fire, water to save water—it is called ‘increasing abundance.’ Following the beginning without end, if you go with insincere grand words, you will surely die before the violent man!\n\nWhen one offers a luminous pearl at night, few do not grasp their sword—because they do not understand. Now, your virtue, trust, and reputation for non-contention are things he does not yet understand. To forcibly apply the standards of benevolence and righteousness to him, he will think you wish to destroy others to establish yourself.\n\nThus the utmost person does not exhaust their will in ordering the world but responds to things with an empty mind. Sincerity and trust are manifest in heaven and earth; non-contention flows freely among the myriad things. Only then do the myriad things return to embrace them, heaven and earth do not oppose them. Thus their virtuous reputation spreads, and the world responds in harmony; their illustrious conduct shines, and the six directions all answer. Only then can one traverse cold and heat, cross order and chaos, without clashing with the scales of the dragon.\n\nIf one’s approach is not trusted, they will think you contend for fame and turn to harm you. If one can delight in the worthy and despise the foolish, hear of righteousness and submit, then they are a enlightened ruler. If they are an enlightened ruler, then they do not苦于 lack worthy ministers—your going would not be extraordinary. If they are not so, going will surely bring harm.\n\nThus, to go with intent is to go without success; to respond without intent is to have response come of itself—then there is no going that is not possible. You need only be silent and speechless. If you speak, the lords and dukes will surely ride upon others with the power of rulership, using their clever eloquence to reject remonstrance and adorn their faults. Their words will be clever and swift, dazzling the eyes. You will not be able to distinguish yourself from them, nor will you have leisure to save yourself—you will only cast yourself aside to follow them. If you cannot save them, you will only strengthen their authority.\n\nThe common and constant cling to the old and are unwilling to change. If one is not trusted and remonstrates, even grand words will bring harm.\n\nMoreover, in ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan. Both were those who cultivated themselves and humbly served the people, yet they offended their superiors—thus their lords used their cultivation to cast them out. They were lovers of fame.\n\nIn ancient times, Yao attacked Cong, Zhi, Xu, and Ao; Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became desolate and ruined, their persons subjected to punishment and execution. Their use of arms did not cease; their pursuit of fame and substance knew no end. These were all seekers of fame and substance—have you alone not heard of this? Fame and substance are things even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can you!\"",

How could the world know that what is exhausted is reborn?\n\nFrom *Zhuangzi*, \"Inner Chapters,\" \"The Human World\" (Chapter Four):\nYan Hui sought an audience with Confucius to request leave to depart.",

      "translated_text": "\"Even so, if you must have some way, try telling it to me.\"\n\nGuan Longfeng and Prince Bigan, though subordinates, took on the burdens of their superiors—tasks not rightfully theirs. They did not wish to let ministers gain the reputation of surpassing their lords. Tyrannical rulers not only seek to indulge their desires but also pursue fame; it is only that what they seek is not the Dao.\n\nRulers who covet fame and desire, even if they were Yao or Yu, cannot be transformed. Thus, the multitude attacks them—yet you would go empty-handed to transform them with the Dao?\n\nYan Hui said, \"If I maintain integrity while emptying my heart, and strive for unity, would that suffice?\"\n\n\"To rectify one’s form while emptying one’s heart—this is to speak with deference and without duplicity.\" He replied, \"It will not suffice.\"\n\nYan Hui asked, \"Why not? If one’s yang qi is full to overflowing, with shifting colors and an unsteady demeanor—common people dare not oppose it. One seizes upon others’ emotions to seek harmony with their hearts. This is called a virtue that gradually fails to take shape—how much less can great virtue be achieved! Such a one clings rigidly without transformation, outwardly compliant yet inwardly unyielding—how could this ever work?\"\n\nThis describes the Lord of Wei: his overbearing yang nature swells within and flaunts itself without, reaching the height of arrogance. His joy and anger are unpredictable; none dare defy him. Such extreme obstinacy leads him to respond to others’ flattery with indulgence, then crush them to assert his dominance, seeking ease and self-indulgence to satisfy his extravagant desires. His words grow ever more excessive, with no restraint or humility. Thus, he clings to his original intent. Outwardly compliant yet inwardly unyielding—this is merely the earlier \"integrity with an empty heart and striving for unity,\" which is insufficient to transform him.\n\n\"Then let me be inwardly upright and outwardly yielding, achieving through emulation of the ancients. To be inwardly upright is to follow Heaven. One who follows Heaven knows that the Son of Heaven and oneself are both children of Heaven—why then should one seek others’ approval for one’s words, whether they deem them good or not? Such a one is called a childlike follower of Heaven.\n\nTo be outwardly yielding is to follow others. Raising hands in respect, kneeling in submission, bowing in deference—these are the rites of a minister. If all others do so, how dare I not? To do what others do is to avoid their censure—this is called following others.\n\nTo achieve through emulation of the ancients is to follow the past.

This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the ultimate course of Fuxi and Jiqu, and how much more so for those who are scattered!\n\n“Not acting is easy; to act without treading the earth is impossible. Non-doing is easy; to act without harming one’s nature is unattainable. What sight and hearing obtain is coarse, and thus easily deceived. But the recompense of the natural is subtle, and thus difficult to feign. The less one loses of the real, the less one is incomplete; the more one loses of the real, the more one is incomplete. The recompense of loss and gain never fails to match its measure. To defy Heaven and act falsely—is this not difficult indeed?\n\n“Words must have their means to accomplish their ends. Now, without the abode of utmost emptiness, how can one have the reality of transforming things? To regard being as non-being is the vacant room. In a vacant room, purity and whiteness arise alone. Where auspiciousness gathers is in utmost emptiness and stillness. If one does not halt at what is fitting, does not meet the ultimate, this is to spend the day sitting in response while galloping without cease. Thus, before external enemies arrive, one is already exhausted within—how can one transform things?\n\n“To close the ears and eyes and yet attain naturally is to have turned the mind’s knowledge outward. Therefore, to follow one’s nature and move directly, going nowhere without darkness—how could one be burdened by the obscure and hidden, let alone the entanglements of the human world? Things have no nobility or baseness; none fails to communicate through the mind’s knowledge and the ears and eyes. Thus, what the world calls ‘knowing’—is it knowing by desiring to know? What it calls ‘seeing’—is it seeing by desiring to see? If knowing and seeing could be obtained by desire, then could one desire worthiness and obtain worthiness, or act as a sage and become a sage? Certainly not. Yet the world does not know that knowing knows itself, and so desires to act as knowing to know; it does not see that seeing sees itself, and so desires to act as seeing to see; it does not know that life lives itself, and so seeks to act as life to live. Thus, seeing the eye, one demands the clarity of Li Zhu; hearing the ear, one demands the acuity of Shi Kuang. The spirit gallops within, the ears and eyes are exhausted without, the body is ill at ease, and one is no longer darkly attuned to things. Not being darkly attuned, how can one harmonize with the changes of the human world or respond to the rhythms of generation after generation? This has never been.\n\nDuke Ye of She, about to be sent on a mission to Qi, asked Confucius: ‘The king’s charge to me is most weighty. Qi’s treatment of envoys is likely to be respectful but not urgent. Even a common man cannot be moved, let alone a feudal lord! I am deeply apprehensive. You once told me: “In all matters, great or small, few fail to achieve joy through the Dao. If the matter does not succeed, there will surely be human calamity; if it succeeds, there will surely be the calamity of yin and yang. Only one of power can succeed or fail without disaster.” I eat coarse food without refinement, and my cook has no desire for coolness. Yet this morning I received my charge and by evening was drinking ice—is this not inner heat? I have not yet reached the truth of the matter, yet I already suffer the calamity of yin and yang! If the matter does not succeed, there will surely be human calamity—this is a double burden. As a minister, I am not equal to this task. Pray, tell me what to do!’\n\nThe weight of the mission stems from the desire for something. One fears that Qi will merely return empty respect without urgently meeting the request. In matters great or small, few fail to achieve joy through speaking of success. This is what Confucius once told me. Those who speak of success as joy will be angered if it does not come. This is something even the King of Chu cannot avoid. Though the human calamity may pass, joy and fear still war in the breast, and ice has already congealed in the five viscera. Only one of power can entrust success or failure to the other without troubling the mind.\n\nFacing the fire without thinking of coolness shows the frugality of his fare. That his fare is frugal yet he drinks ice with inner heat—this is truly due to anxiety over the difficulty of the matter, not the allure of fine food. Before the matter is settled, one only fears it will not succeed. If it truly does not succeed, then fear will congeal within while the net of punishment and the web of law ensnare without.”\n\nConfucius said: “Under Heaven there are two great precepts: one is fate, the other is duty. Your love for your parents is fate, which cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is nowhere he can go that is not his lord, no place in Heaven and Earth he can escape.”",

Forsake the senses, discard the mind’s intentions, and align with the self-attainment of qi and nature—this is emptiness awaiting things. When the mind is emptied, the supreme Dao gathers within.\n\nYan Hui said: “Before I was enabled to practice this, I was truly Yan Hui; once enabled, I was no longer Yan Hui—may this be called emptiness?”\n\nNot yet having practiced the fast of the mind, one remains bound to the self.",

      "translated_text": "This is called the great precept. Thus, in serving one’s parents, to be at ease without choosing the place is the utmost of filial piety; in serving one’s lord, to be at ease without choosing the task is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own heart, neither sorrow nor joy alters what lies before it—knowing the inevitable and accepting it as fate is the perfection of virtue. For a minister nearing the throne, there are indeed things he cannot avoid. Acting with the truth of the matter while forgetting himself—how could he have leisure to delight in life and dread death? The Master’s conduct is thus fitting! Naturally bound and firm, it cannot be undone.\n\nWhen a thousand gather, if none is taken as master, disorder will lead to dissolution. Thus, many worthy men cannot have many lords, and without worthies there cannot be no lord—this is the Dao of Heaven and man, the inevitable principle. If a lord could be fled and parents untied, there would be no need for precepts. Knowing the inevitable as fate and accepting it, one has neither sorrow nor joy—how could these be altered? Thus, obscurely taking what one encounters as fate and not applying the mind to it, merging utterly with what is most fitting without joy or sorrow within, even in serving ordinary men, one finds no place that is not fitting—how much more so with lord and parents!\n\nMatters have their inevitabilities, principles are fundamentally constant. Thus, entrusting them brings success, and where matters succeed yet the self is not preserved—this has never been. Why then trouble the mind over the self? Principles are unobstructed, so one should simply proceed with what one encounters. If one’s faith in the Dao is not steadfast and likes and dislikes linger in the heart, unable to proceed with what is most fitting while scheming for life and fearing death—I have never seen such a one succeed.\n\nQiu respectfully repeats what he has heard: In close relations, trust must be mutually confirmed; in distant relations, loyalty must be conveyed through words. Words must sometimes be transmitted. Transmitting words of mutual joy or mutual anger is the most difficult thing under Heaven. For mutual joy invariably brings excessive praise, and mutual anger invariably brings excessive blame. All excess is false, and falsehood cannot be trusted. Where trust is lacking, the transmitter of words brings calamity. Thus, the standard teaching says: *\"Transmit the constant truth, do not transmit excessive words, and you will be nearly whole.\"*\n\nThose nearby can verify, so their trust is confirmed through direct contact. Those afar must convey intent through words. Words of joy and anger, if they exceed reality, should be transmitted so that neither side loses the mean—thus it is not easy. *Excess* means going beyond. Words of joy and anger always exceed what is fitting. Suspecting the words are not his, one may think the transmitter fabricates. Doubt arises. If excessive words are transmitted, it seems like wild falsehood. The receiver doubts, and the transmitter is arbitrarily blamed for exaggeration or understatement. Even if one hears momentary excess, do not transmit it. One must cite the constant truth and grasp the sincere intent—then one is close to wholeness.\n\nMoreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin in openness but often end in secrecy; when taken to excess, they resort to strange tricks. Those who drink with ritual begin in order but often end in chaos; when taken to excess, they indulge in strange pleasures. All things are thus: they begin in sincerity but often end in baseness. Their inception is simple, but their conclusion must be grand.\n\nWords are like wind and waves; actions bring gain or loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred, gain and loss easily endangered. Thus, anger arises without cause, and clever words lead to biased speech. When beasts are cornered and dying, their cries are desperate, their breath disordered—then vicious hearts arise together. If scrutiny is too severe, unworthy intentions will respond, and one does not know why. If one does not know why, who knows where it will end? Thus, the standard teaching says: *\"Do not alter commands, do not urge completion. Going beyond is harmful.\"* Altering commands and urging completion endanger affairs.\n\nTrue excellence takes time; evil, once done, cannot be undone—can one not be cautious? Originally, they played together in good humor. When the desire to win arises, it secretly harms the other, no longer following reason. There are distinctions between high and low, and toasts follow order. Yet they sink into drunkenness, indulging without restraint, reaching every excess. Trouble arises from simplicity, affairs begin in small things—this is the inevitable course.\n\nWords are like wind and waves, so acting on them brings gain or loss. Thus, if one leaves wind and waves unacted upon, gain is not lost. If affairs attain their truth, danger can be stabilized and turmoil settled. The arising of anger has no other cause—it always comes from clever words exceeding reality or biased speech missing the mark. Like wild beasts driven into a corner, their cries are urgent, their breath disordered, their anger violent, and both develop sores to face each other.\n\nOne who is tolerant and accommodates others will surely be sought out. If scrutiny is too precise, a miserly heart arises unnoticed. Thus, the great man lets things drift freely in their own realm, not begrudging others’ abilities, not exhausting others’ joy—thus the bonds of the Four Seas can be preserved. If one does not realize this, how can one know where fortune and misfortune converge?\n\nTransmit the truth of the other. Let it come to fruition on its own. Adding to it is not entrusting the truth. This is how affairs become perilous. Excellence comes from allowing things to transform in their time—like planting, it cannot be rushed. If one urges what the other dislikes to force completion, regret and failure soon follow.\n\nMoreover, riding things to roam the mind, entrusting the unavoidable to nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there to act in return? It is best to deliver one’s mandate—this is the difficult part. Entrusting one’s intent to things, following the inevitable principles, the harmony of the mean is complete—this is the utmost in engaging with others. One should simply accept the truth of what is owed in return—why contrive intentions in the space between?",

He asked Qu Boyu, “There is a man here whose virtue is as harsh as Heaven’s execution. If I deal with him without restraint, I endanger our state; if I deal with him with restraint, I endanger myself. His knowledge suffices only to recognize others’ faults, not to see why they err. What should I do in such a case?”\n\nThe nature of petty men is this: if you guide them by rules, they resent you; if you let them run unchecked, they throw the state into chaos. Unaware that the people’s faults arise from themselves, they blame the people and never reform. Qu Boyu said, “Excellent question! Be on guard, be cautious—first rectify yourself! In form, nothing surpasses compliance; in mind, nothing surpasses harmony. Yet these two have their perils. Compliance must not become submission; harmony must not become display. If form complies and submits, you will be overthrown, destroyed, collapsed, or stumbling. If mind harmonizes and displays itself, you will be reduced to fame, reputation, omen, or calamity.\n\nLet him be an infant, and you be an infant with him. Let him be without boundaries, and you be without boundaries with him. Let him be without limits, and you be without limits with him. Guide him to enter flawlessness. Through repeated encounters and meetings, both will thus rectify themselves. In form, do not oppose; in harmony, do not conform. Compliance in form is yielding; submission is merging completely. Harmony is aided by principle; display is self-promotion. If you merge completely, you will stumble and not support him, perishing together. Therefore, you must model yourself on Heaven and Earth, differing only in small matters.\n\nIf you display harmony, you will gain a reputation for tolerance, yet aiding his fame will make him resent your superiority and recklessly spawn calamity. Thus, you must remain obscure as dusk, blending like dust in radiance. Then you cannot be claimed as close or distant, benefited or harmed.

Thus, those they kill are those who oppose them. They fear that a killing intent will lead to rage. If you make the tiger bite and divide its food, it will use force and grow angry. Know the cause of its anger and comply with it. Compliance with principle makes even different kinds grow affectionate; opposition to rhythm makes even the closest kin turn to arms.\n\nThose who love horses use baskets to collect their dung and clamshells to collect their urine.

      "translated_text": "That tree merely lodges there by chance! It takes those who do not understand it as its revilers. Had it not become a spirit tree, it would nearly have been felled! Moreover, what it preserves differs from the multitude, yet to explain it through righteousness—how far removed is that!\n\nIt still resents being honored as a spirit tree, rather than simply delighting in its uselessness. The spirit merely comes to lodge there—this tree does not seek to become a spirit. The tree takes being a spirit as a humiliation from those who do not understand it—how could this be an honor!\n\nThe tree itself takes its uselessness as its use; thus, even if it were not a spirit tree, it would still ultimately avoid the harm of being felled. It preserves itself by having nothing to preserve, while the multitude preserves itself by having something to preserve. Benefiting others, fostering growth, and restraining wrongdoing—these are the duties of a spirit tree.\n\nThe useless one, serene and inactive, allows all talents to be used; those who are \"useful\" each attain their proper place without interference. This is how the useless preserves life. You praise it as a spirit tree—how could it not draw near to harm!\n\n---\n\nNanbo Ziqi wandered in the hills of Shang and saw a great tree, one unlike any other: its shade could shelter a thousand chariots, and travelers would take refuge beneath its foliage. Ziqi said: \"What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary timber!\" Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and unfit for beams or rafters; looking down at its massive roots, he saw they were split and unfit for coffins or outer caskets. Licking its leaves, his mouth blistered and burned; smelling it, he became wildly intoxicated, raving for three days without cease. Yet its branches’ shade could shelter a thousand chariots.\n\nZiqi said: \"This is truly a useless tree—how else could it have grown so vast? Alas, the spirit-like person takes this uselessness as their way.\"\n\nThe king who is \"useless\" among his officials allows his ministers to manage their affairs: the clear-sighted to see, the keen-eared to listen, the wise to plan, the brave to defend. What does he do? He remains profoundly still. And when all talents do not overstep their proper place, this \"uselessness\" becomes what all talents ultimately rely upon. Thus, the world delights in exalting him without tiring, and he rides upon the ten thousand things without harm.\n\n---\n\nIn Song there was a region called Jing, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those with trunks the size of an arm-span were felled by those seeking pegs for monkey perches; those three or four spans around were felled by those seeking timber for grand and famous structures; those seven or eight spans around were felled by the households of nobles and wealthy merchants seeking sideboards for their halls. Thus, they did not live out their natural years but were cut down midway by axes—this is the calamity of being useful.\n\nTherefore, when exorcists release a white-foreheaded ox, a snub-nosed pig, or a person with hemorrhoids, they do not allow them to cross the river. The shamans know this—these are considered inauspicious. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like person regards as the greatest auspice.\n\nThose with talent cannot help but cherish it. Shamans perform exorcisms, casting aside these three, and only then do they carefully select unblemished sacrificial animals before daring to use them. The shamans know that the untalented remain whole. To preserve life is what the world calls auspicious, yet shamans regard the untalented as inauspicious and do not use them. They, by being \"inauspicious,\" preserve life—this is the greatest auspice.\n\nThe spirit-like person has no mind of their own and follows things as they are. Thus, what the world calls the greatest auspice, the spirit-like person does not oppose.\n\n---\n\nThere was a man named Zhili Shu, whose chin was hidden in his navel, shoulders higher than his head, the crown of his skull pointing to the sky, his five organs above, his thighs beside his ribs. By mending needles and washing clothes, he earned enough to feed himself; by sifting husks and winnowing grain, he could feed ten people. When the authorities conscripted soldiers, Zhili Shu waved his arms and wandered among them; when there were great labor projects, Zhili Shu, citing his chronic illness, was exempt from service; when the authorities distributed grain to the sick, he received three bushels and ten bundles of firewood.\n\nThough his body was deformed, he could still nourish himself and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is \"deformed\"! Relying on his uselessness, he did not hide himself away. Exempt from corvée labor, he did not participate; when gifts were given, he accepted them.\n\nThe spirit-like person is of no use to things, yet things each attain their own use. They ascribe merit and fame to the multitude, merging with things without a trace. Thus, they avoid the harm of the human realm and dwell in the substance of constant beauty—this is one whose virtue is \"deformed.\"\n\n---\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, Jie Yu, the madman of Chu, wandered by his gate and sang:\n\nPhoenix, phoenix,\nHow your virtue has declined!\nThe future cannot be awaited,\nThe past cannot be retrieved.\nWhen the world has the Dao,\nThe sage achieves;\nWhen the world lacks the Dao,\nThe sage survives.\nIn this present age,\nOne barely escapes punishment.\nFortune is lighter than a feather,\nYet none know how to bear it.\nDo not look ahead or behind—\nFully grasp the present moment.\nOblivious, merge with the times,\nAnd only then can you be perfectly attuned, avoid punishment and disgrace.\nLeave your feet free to wander,\nYour hands free to act,\nLet your ears hear what they hear,\nYour eyes see what they see.\nKnow to stop where you do not know,\nDo only what you can do.\nUse what is naturally useful,\nAct as is naturally fitting.\nFollow your nature within,\nWithout the slightest concern for what lies beyond—\nThis is the utmost ease of non-action.",

      "translated_text": "No one who practices non-action fails to preserve their nature and life; and where nature and life are preserved, misfortune is, in principle, unheard of. Thus, what we call fortune is nothing other than this very preservation—it is not borrowed from external things, nor does it bear the weight of a goose feather. To move in accord with one’s nature, never exceeding its bounds, is the utmost ease in the world; to lift what lifts itself, to bear what bears itself, is the utmost lightness in the world. Yet because people harm their nature with boundless knowledge and disturb their true heart with likes and dislikes, they abandon this utmost ease of non-action to pursue the utmost difficulty of action, and discard this utmost lightness of self-lifting to take on the utmost weight of bearing others. This is the common affliction of the world.\n\nDisaster is heavier than the earth,\nYet none know how to avoid it.\nIf one acts from within their nature,\nEven bearing ten thousand jun feels weightless;\nIf one relies on external things,\nEven a weight no heavier than a zhu or a zhi becomes unbearable.\nActing from within brings fortune,\nThus fortune is supremely light;\nActing from without brings disaster,\nThus disaster is supremely heavy.\nThat disaster is supremely heavy yet none know how to avoid it—\nThis is the world’s great delusion.\n\nEnough, enough!\nTo govern others with virtue is perilous indeed!\nDrawing lines on the ground to make others follow—\nPerilous, perilous!\nForcing others to follow a path you have traced leaves tracks that cannot be concealed;\nImposing one’s own standards upon things prevents harmony with them.\nThus, the great person does not dazzle others with their own brilliance but allows others to find their own clarity; they do not impose their virtue upon others but entrust others to discover their own virtue.

      "translated_text": "Had there not been a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What manner of man is this? Each finds fulfillment in himself. How strange that though his form is maimed, his heart is so full! When the heart is whole, it leaves the body behind, forgets the five viscera, and wanders alone—none under heaven can depart from it.\n\nConfucius said, “This Master is a sage. I am but a latecomer who has yet to follow him! I shall take him as my teacher—how much more should those who are not my equal! Why limit it to Lu? I shall lead all under heaven to follow him.”\n\nWhen spirit is whole and the heart complete, the body merges with things. One who merges with things cannot be distanced by all under heaven—how could it be merely one state?\n\nChangji said, “He is a cripple, yet he surpasses Master Wang—how far he stands above the common! If this is so, how does he employ his heart?”\n\nConfucius said, “Though life and death are great indeed, he does not change with them. Though heaven and earth collapse, he will not be lost with them. He discerns the unborrowed and does not shift with things; he commands the transformations of things while guarding their root.”\n\nThough people change daily, life and death are the greatest of changes. He moves with change, so life and death do not alter him. This is following it. It clarifies the constancy of nature and fate. He takes transformation as fate and does not oppose it, never departing from the ultimate of rightness.\n\nChangji said, “What does this mean?”\n\nConfucius said, “Viewed in their differences, liver and gall are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed in their sameness, the myriad things are all one. One who is thus wanders his heart in the harmony of virtue, unaware of what ears and eyes deem fitting. He sees what is one in things and does not see what is lost—seeing the loss of a foot as discarding dirt.”\n\nWhen the nature of tranquility and suffering differs, the feelings of beauty and ugliness diverge. Though what is deemed beautiful varies, all share in finding something beautiful. Each finds beauty in what they deem beautiful, so the myriad things share one beauty. Each affirms what they affirm, so all under heaven share one affirmation.\n\nIf one distinguishes things by their differences, then all under heaven is different. But one who gazes with vast equanimity governs heaven and earth, contains the myriad things, and knows that differences are not truly different. Thus, following what is shared, all under heaven is the same. Knowing that sameness is not truly possessed, following what is absent, all distinctions of right and wrong, beauty and ugliness dissolve into nothingness.\n\nTo affirm oneself and negate others, to find beauty in oneself and ugliness in others—from those of middling wisdom down to crawling insects, none fail to do this. Yet this is merely clarity about oneself and obscurity about others. As for those of profound penetration and merging unity, they illuminate all under heaven through all under heaven. When none under heaven say “I am not,” it reveals that none are not; when none say “that is right,” it reveals that none are right. Without right or wrong, all blends into one. Thus, they ride change and follow transformation, opposing things without fear. Having forgotten all preferences, nothing is not entrusted. To entrust all and not attain—this has never been; to attain all and not harmonize—this too has never been heard.\n\nThus, the heart roams freely within the bounds of Dao and virtue, drifting without anything amiss, vast and without constraint. Embracing the wondrous heart of ultimate principle, one is the same with all things. Being the same with all things, in life and death, in change, there is nowhere that is not oneself. Thus, life is my time, death is my following; time is my gathering, following is my scattering. Though gathering and scattering differ, I am always myself. Life is merely my moment—there has never been gain; death is also myself—there has never been loss.\n\nViewing the changes of life and death as one, once their oneness is seen, one sheds all attachments, merges self and other in profound unity, treats life and death as waking and dreaming, the body as an inn. Departing life is like shedding sandals, severing a foot like discarding dirt—I have never seen anything that could entangle such a heart.\n\nChangji said, “He cultivates himself. Through his knowledge, he attains his heart; through his heart, he attains his constant heart. Why should things vie to surpass him?”",

      "translated_text": "King Tai appeared unable to forget knowledge yet preserve himself, unable to relinquish the heart yet attain self-possession. To attain one’s constant heart is to go forth in equanimity. He seemed unable to go forth in equanimity and encounter things, thus always compelling things to come to him.\n\nConfucius said, “No one mirrors themselves in flowing water, but in still water. Only stillness can still the many stillings. Receiving mandate from earth, only the pine and cypress stand upright, ever green through winter and summer. Receiving mandate from heaven, only Yao and Shun stand upright, at the head of all things. Fortunate to rectify life, they rectify the lives of all. The proof of preserving one’s beginning lies in fearlessness—one brave warrior can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and can restrain themselves are yet like this; how much more one who governs heaven and earth, stores the myriad things, treats the six senses as a temporary abode, models the ears and eyes, unifies the knowledge of knowledge, and whose heart has never died! He will choose a day to ascend on high, and people will follow him. How would he deign to make things his concern?”\n\nThe stillness of water that enables reflection is not stillness sought for reflection. Thus, when King Tai gathered the multitude, the multitude came to him of their own accord—how could he draw things to follow him? If he acted to make it so, he could not abide in the stillness of the myriad things. The pine and cypress uniquely receive the concentrated qi of nature, thus they stand as the finest of trees—not through effort but by attainment. Those who uniquely receive the upright qi of nature are exceedingly rare: below, only the pine and cypress; above, only the sages. Thus, all that are not upright come seeking rectification. If all things possessed perfect verdancy, the pine and cypress would not be prized; if each person were self-upright, none would admire the great sage and hasten to him. Fortunate to be upright oneself, one does not rectify in order to rectify others. Not striving to renounce fame yet leaving nothing unborne, darkly embodying all—this is what is called a temporary abode.\n\nPeople use their ears and eyes, yet they are not their ears and eyes. When knowledge moves with transformation, there is nowhere it does not darkly pervade—this is the oneness of knowledge. When the heart flows with life and death, there is no time it is not alive—this is the heart that has never died. To choose is to fail to meet; this person makes no choice, following heaven’s course and moving with the times. Thus, those who borrow and lend are surpassed by him. His tranquility preserves his wholeness.\n\nShentu Jia, a man without feet, studied with Zheng Zichan under Bohun Wuren. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, “If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay.” The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, “If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay. Now I am about to leave—can you stay? Or not? Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not yield. Do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?” Ashamed to walk alongside one without feet, he pressed the question, wishing to ensure they would not leave together. Always valuing his own position, he directly said, “You consider yourself equal to the one in power,” implying his lack of deference.\n\nShentu Jia said, “In the Master’s gate, are there truly those in power like this? You delight in your position and belittle others. I have heard: ‘When a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if it settles, it is not bright. Long dwelling with the worthy leaves no faults.’ Now, what you take as greatest is the Master, yet you still speak thus—is this not a fault?” This speaks of virtue’s place, not rank. He mocked his pride in position, wishing to precede others. To serve a clear teacher yet retain a stingy heart is truly a fault.\n\nZichan said, “You are already like this, yet still vie with Yao in goodness. Measuring your virtue, is it not enough to reflect on yourself?” As one with a maimed form, he spoke without self-examination, wishing to slight those in power and stand with the virtuous. Measuring his virtue, it was insufficient to compensate for his maimed form’s transgression.\n\nShentu Jia said, “Those who describe their faults, claiming they should not have lost what they lost, are many; those who do not describe their faults, claiming they should not have kept what they kept, are few. Knowing there is nothing to be done and accepting it as fate—only those with virtue can do this. Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow: the center is the target, yet missing it is fate. Many have laughed at my incomplete feet, and I bristled with anger. But when I came to the Master’s place, I returned in calm. Did the Master wash me with goodness, or did I awaken myself? I have wandered with you for nineteen years and never known I was without feet. Now you wander with me within the form, yet seek me outside the form—is this not a fault?” He often recounted his faults, claiming many believed he should not have lost what he lost.",

      "translated_text": "Yi was an archer of old renowned for his skill. The range of his bow and arrows was called the \"drawn bow.\" Where profit and harm contend, the world is all Yi. Those who do not abandon themselves, forget knowledge, and flow with things—all wander within Yi’s drawn bow. Even if one ventures forth like Zhang Yi or dwells in seclusion like Shan Bao, they cannot escape the target’s center. Whether one hits or misses it rests solely with fate. Yet the petty-minded each encounter their own lot and do not realize that fate is thus of itself. Those who escape harm from bow and arrow deem themselves clever, rejoicing in their superiority. But when they cannot escape, they resent their error, their wills wounded and spirits shamed—these have not yet grasped the nature of fate.\n\nOur lives are not of our own making. Within a single lifetime, a hundred years, all our sitting and rising, moving and resting, inclinations and aversions, emotions, nature, knowledge, and abilities—all that we possess, all that we lack, all that we do, all that we encounter—are not of ourselves. The principle is thus of itself. To arbitrarily generate joy and sorrow within it is to go against nature and lose the Way. All this stems from not knowing fate and thus indulging in such laughter.\n\nSeeing the perfected one’s knowledge of fate and abandonment of form, he cast aside his former anger and returned to equilibrium. Did the Master wash me with the goodness of the Dao, or was I able to turn back myself? This was to forget the form and leave burdens behind—forgetting the form indeed. The form lies without, while virtue resides within. Now you wander with me in virtue, not in bodily exchange, yet you seek my external adornments—is this not a fault?\n\nZi Chan, startled, altered his expression and said, “Say no more!” Having awakened, he found the words excessive.",

Yet by the natural principle, where conduct goes, the shadow follows; where words go, echoes attend. One who accords with things establishes a name and trace, though according with things is not for the sake of name. Not acting for name—this is perfection. Yet ultimately one cannot escape name. Who, then, can free himself from it?\n\nThus, name is the shadow and echo; shadow and echo are the fetters of form and sound. When this principle is understood, name and trace may be relinquished. When name and trace are relinquished, attachment to externals may be severed. When attachment to externals is severed, one’s nature and life may be preserved whole.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, “In Wei there was an ugly man named Aitai Tuo. Men who lived with him thought of him and could not leave. Women who saw him pleaded with their parents, saying, ‘Better to be this man’s concubine than another’s wife’—by the tens, without end. He never initiated speech, only harmonized with others. He held no lordly position to save men from death, no store of wealth to fill men’s bellies. Moreover, his ugliness startled all under heaven. He harmonized without initiating, his wisdom did not extend beyond his immediate sphere, yet men and women alike gathered before him. There must have been something extraordinary in him.\n\nI summoned him to observe him, and indeed, his ugliness startled all under heaven. Yet after less than a month in my company, I took notice of his character. Before a year had passed, I trusted him. The state had no chief minister, so I offered him the governance. He responded with reluctance, as if declining. I was ashamed, yet in the end I entrusted him with the state.

      "translated_text": "Ugliness is but outward deformity. Yet men came to him not by power or influence. They came not seeking sustenance. They came not for his comeliness. He summoned none, yet they gathered. His thoughts did not stray beyond their proper bounds.\n\nThe man of perfect talent harms nothing in the world. Entering the herd, he does not disturb the beasts; entering the flock, he does not scatter the birds. Thus he becomes a refuge for all things. Before a month had passed, his depth was already perceived. Entrusted with the governance of the state, neither favor nor disgrace could unsettle his spirit. When others declined, so too did he.\n\nConfucius said: “I once traveled to Chu and saw young boars nursing from their dead mother. After a moment, they glanced about in alarm and fled. They saw not their own kind, nor found anything familiar. What they loved in their mother was not her form, but that which animated her form. When warriors die in battle, their burials do not include the ceremonial shields of the living. No one cherishes the shoes of the mutilated. In both cases, the root is lost. The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears. Those who take wives remain apart, no longer employed in service. If mere bodily integrity suffices to command such reverence, how much more the man of perfect virtue!\n\nNow, Aitai Tu spoke not, yet was trusted; did nothing, yet was beloved. He was offered a state, yet feared only that he might refuse. Such a man must be one of perfect talent whose virtue remains unmanifest.”\n\nThe living are drawn to those of like talent and virtue. When these depart in death, the living flee, for their kind is lost. Thus, one rich in inner virtue is like a newborn babe: wherever he goes, none harm him, for he is recognized as kin and thus made clear to all. If the heart is of like kind, even dissimilar forms arouse no hostility. But if the heart is not of like kind, even mother and child, though alike in form, cannot secure their bond.\n\nThat which animates form is talent and virtue. The ceremonial shield is the instrument of martial prowess. The fallen warrior has no use for martial prowess—where then would such a shield be placed? We cherish shoes for the sake of the feet. Shields and shoes alike depend on their root. To preserve the body whole is to fear harm to its form.\n\nIn selecting consorts or celebrating new marriage, the mind is set on physical beauty. Thus, bodily integrity alone can soften the passions of the most exalted and turn the resolve of the chastest maiden. How much more, then, should the man of perfect virtue be beloved by all things!\n\nDuke Ai said: “What is meant by *perfect talent*?”\n\nConfucius replied: “Life and death, survival and ruin, success and failure, wealth and poverty, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate before us day and night, yet knowledge cannot trace their beginnings. Thus, they must not be allowed to disturb the harmony within, nor enter the sacred chamber of the mind. Let them bring only ease and openness, never departing from joy. Let day and night be seamless, so that the heart ever abides in springtime, meeting all things with the vitality of the season. This is what is called *perfect talent*.”",

      "translated_text": "The principle is inherently right—it cannot be escaped. Thus, human life is no mistake; what life possesses is no delusion. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things numerous, what I encounter is precisely this—even the gods of heaven and earth, the sages of the state, exerting utmost strength and wisdom, cannot alter it. Therefore, what one does not encounter cannot be encountered; what one encounters cannot be unencountered. What one does not do cannot be done; what one does cannot be undone. Entrust it to fate, and it naturally fits.\n\nFate moves, affairs change, ceaseless day and night, pressing forward without retreat, lingering without pause. Thus, the man of perfect talent follows what he encounters and entrusts himself to it. Beginnings cannot be traced by knowledge, nor can endings be clung to by emotion. Therefore, those who know that fate must run its course and affairs must change—how could they scheme for endings or cling to beginnings, fixate on the new or yearn for the old? Even with utmost wisdom, they cannot trace it. The past is gone—what can I do about it? If one knows that nature and fate are inherently right, then though life and death, success and failure, undergo a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations, one remains serene and at ease, harmony and principle dwelling within.\n\nThe sacred chamber is the dwelling of the spirit. The perfectly content do not let cares and troubles disturb their spirit, passing over them like skin-deep matters. If one keeps harmony unperturbed and the sacred chamber at ease, then though one traverses the greatest changes, one does not lose one’s joy. Calmly entrusting oneself to it, one becomes the reliance of all living things, transforming together with the four seasons.\n\n“What is meant by *virtue not manifesting*?”\n“Stillness is the fullness of water at rest. It can serve as a model: inwardly preserved, outwardly undisturbed. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. *Virtue not manifesting* means things cannot depart from it.”\n\nOf all things in the world, none is more perfectly level than still water. Utterly without bias, it is thus the standard for the world. When affairs are accomplished and things are harmonized, this is called *virtue*. When no affair is unaccomplished and no thing is disharmonious, this is *virtue not manifesting*. Therefore, the world delights in exalting it without tiring.\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Minzi: “At first, I thought that by facing south as ruler of the world, holding the people’s guiding threads and worrying over their deaths, I had attained perfect understanding. Now, hearing the words of the perfected man, I fear I lack their substance, have lightly used my person, and lost my state. I and Kong Qiu are not ruler and minister—we are friends in virtue!”\n\nThose who hear the wind of virtue’s fullness, even Duke Ai, wish to cast off their bodily forms and forget nobility and baseness.\n\nYin Qi, the hunchbacked, lipless man, persuaded Duke Ling of Wei, who was so pleased that he compared whole-bodied men and found their necks too slender. The man with the great goiter persuaded Duke Huan of Qi, who was so pleased that he compared whole-bodied men and found their necks too slender. Thus, virtue has its excellences, and form has its forgettings. People forget what should be forgotten yet forget what should not be forgotten—this is called *true forgetting*.\n\nPartial feelings lead one way, and the ugly become more lovely while the lovely become more ugly. If one’s virtue excels in following things, things forget their ugliness; if it excels in opposing things, things forget their loveliness. In life, they are loved; in death, they are discarded. Thus, virtue is what the world does not forget; form is what principle does not retain. Therefore, those who forget form do not truly forget; those who forget virtue while clinging to form—*they* are the ones who truly forget.\n\nThus, the sage wanders freely, yet knowledge becomes a snare, covenants become glue, virtue becomes a bond, skill becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme—why use knowledge? Does not carve—why use glue? Has no loss—why use virtue? Does not trade—why use commerce? These four are the heavenly nourishment. *Heavenly nourishment* is the food of heaven. Having received sustenance from heaven, why use man?\n\nPossessing the form of a human but lacking human emotions, one has the form of a human and thus mingles with people; lacking human emotions, right and wrong do not adhere to one’s person. How small and insignificant—this is how one belongs to people! How vast and towering—this is how one completes one’s heaven. Roaming in the realm of self-attainment, released and reaching everywhere—this is the fullness of talent and virtue. These four arise naturally from one another; their principle is already complete. Since it is naturally complete, the sage has no use for his own contrivance. Words arise from nature and are endowed by it. Once endowed by nature, the principle is already sufficient. Thus, though one may ponder deeply to avoid calamity or clearly admonish to evade misfortune, nothing happens by delusion—all are the convergence of heaven and earth, the direction of the highest principle. What must be pondered is not my pondering; what must not be pondered is not my not pondering. Some ponder and avoid it; some ponder and do not avoid it; some do not ponder and avoid it; some do not ponder and do not avoid it. None of these are of me—what is there to do? Entrust it, and it comes of itself.\n\nTheir appearance is like that of a human. Like gathers with like, kind separates from kind—this is the Dao of nature. Without emotion, one entrusts oneself to things. Their appearance is like that of a human; without emotion, one is vast and unburdened by anything. Unburdened by anything is what those with emotions cannot attain—thus, without emotion, one alone completes heaven.\n\nThus, virtue has its excellences, and form has its forgettings. People forget what should be forgotten yet forget what should not be forgotten—this is called *true forgetting*.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi: “Do humans truly have no emotions?”\nZhuangzi said: “Yes.”\nHuizi said: “If humans have no emotions, how can they be called human?”\nZhuangzi said: “The Dao gives them appearance, heaven gives them form—how can they not be called human?”\n\nHuman life is not born of emotion.",

Even the dullest, the deaf, the blind, the crowing of roosters, the barking of dogs—though they have no emotion in doing so, they too ultimately cannot achieve it.

      "translated_text": "Huizi said: “If one does not augment life, how can one possess a body?”\nHe had not yet understood that life generates itself, and principle suffices of itself.\n\nZhuangzi said: “The Dao bestows its form, Heaven bestows its shape—do not internally harm your body with likes and dislikes. Now you estrange your spirit, exhaust your essence, lean against a tree chanting, or recline on a withered catalpa to sleep. Heaven has selected this form, yet you clamor about ‘hard and white.’”\n\nThe principle of life is already self-sufficient within bodily form; simply follow it, and the body endures. The emotions of likes and dislikes do not augment life but only harm the body, for life has its allotted portion. If the spirit does not rest within the bounds of its nature, it becomes estranged; if essence does not abide at the limit of its self-generation, it becomes exhausted. Thus, when walking, one leans against a tree chanting; when sitting, one reclines on a catalpa to sleep—this is the self-entrapment of those with emotion. All you do—estranging the spirit, exhausting essence, leaning against trees, reclining on catalpas, chanting and sleeping—this is what the world calls emotion. Yet you speak of ‘Heaven’s selection,’ making clear that what arises from emotion (or: what is called emotion) is not born of emotion—how much less anything else! Thus, though the myriad things and myriad forms, their goings and comings, all emerge from the realm of no-emotion, what use is emotion between them?\n\n* * *\n\nIn *The Great and Venerable Master* from the *Inner Chapters* of the *Zhuangzi*:\n\nTo know what Heaven does and what man does—this is perfection!\nTo know what Heaven does is to be born of Heaven; to know what man does is to nourish with what one’s knowledge knows what one’s knowledge does not know, and so complete one’s Heaven-appointed years without dying prematurely—this is the fullness of knowledge.\n\nThough heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things abundant, what they honor as master is the mindless. To know what Heaven and man do is to know that all is natural. Then one inwardly releases the body and outwardly darkens to things, merging with the multitude of mysteries, following them so that nothing is not attained.\n\n“Heaven” means “the natural.” What acts through acting cannot act, but acts through self-acting; what knows through knowing cannot know, but knows through self-knowing. Self-knowing is not knowing; not knowing, then knowledge arises from not-knowing. Self-acting is not acting; not acting, then action arises from non-action. Action arises from non-action, so non-action is the master; knowledge arises from not-knowing, so not-knowing is the origin. Thus the true person abandons knowledge yet knows, does not act yet acts, is born of the natural, attains through sitting in forgetfulness—hence knowledge is called “cut off” and action “gone.”\n\nMan’s life, though the body is but seven feet, must possess the Five Constants. Thus, though the body is small, it upholds heaven and earth to serve it. Therefore, heaven and earth and the myriad things—all that exists—cannot be without one another for a single day. If one thing is lacking, the living have no means to live; if one principle is absent, the Heaven-appointed years have no way to be completed. Yet what the body possesses, one may or may not know; where principle resides, one may or may not act. Thus, what knowledge knows is little, while what the body possesses is much; what action does is small, while where principle resides is vast. Those above cannot measure it to seek its completeness.\n\nWhat people know need not be the same, nor what they do dare differ. To differ is to become false; once falsehood is complete, the true is never preserved. Some love knowledge and tirelessly exhaust their hundred limbs, yet what they love is but a branch while the root is ruined—this is using what one knows to harm what one does not know.\n\nAs for the fullness of knowledge: one knows that what man does has its portion, so one follows without forcing; one knows that what man knows has its limit, so one employs without excess. Thus, not using boundless knowledge to entrap oneself, within the single body, knowledge and non-knowledge darkly meet and are both preserved—this is using what one knows to nourish what one does not know.\n\nYet there is a danger: knowledge must await something to be fitting, but what it awaits is inherently uncertain. How do we know that what I call Heaven is not man, or what I call man is not Heaven? Even with full knowledge, it is not as good as abandoning knowledge and following Heaven without danger. Knowledge cannot be without approval or disapproval, so it must await something. But one who follows Heaven in life meets things and is fitting. To await is to lack certainty.\n\nMy life has its limit—this is Heaven; the heart desires to augment it—this is man. Yet this is only what man calls it; in things, there is nothing that is not (Heaven). “Heaven” means “the natural.” If all people are natural, then order and chaos, success and failure, encounter and non-encounter are not man-made but all natural.\n\nOnly with the true person is there true knowledge. What is the true person? The true persons of old did not oppose the few, did not boast of success, did not scheme. Such as these, when they erred, did not regret; when they were fitting, did not feel self-satisfied. Such as these, when climbing high, did not tremble; when entering water, did not get wet; when entering fire, did not feel heat—this is the knowledge that can ascend to the Dao in this way.\n\nOnly with the true person do all the world’s knowledges attain their truth and cannot be confused. Not opposing the few means one’s wishes are many; not relying on success and taking the lead among things, the heart roams freely and the multitude of scholars naturally gathers—this is not achieved through scheming. Simply preserving wholeness and fittingness without error, not weighing gain and loss in the mind. To say that knowledge ascends to the Dao is to speak of such distance.\n\nPrinciple is inherently whole—this is not fear of death. Thus, when the true person walks on land, it is not to avoid getting wet; when far from fire, it is not to escape heat; without error, it is not to contrive fittingness.",

Therefore, is life truly produced by life? Is completion truly achieved by completion? One who entrusts all to the Way and leaves nothing unattained—this is the true person. How could they impose fixed intentions upon what they encounter?\n\nThe true person of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the breath of ordinary people reaches only the throat. Those who are cramped and submissive speak as if choking. The deeper one’s cravings, the shallower one’s heavenly mechanism. They harbor no deliberate thoughts, resting content in whatever they encounter. Eating is simply a matter of principle—it arises from the root. When qi is not balanced and flowing, one must deeply root and settle to the utmost, only then returning to unity and desirelessness.\n\nThe true person of old did not delight in life nor detest death. They did not rejoice at departure nor resist return. They came and went with effortless ease, neither clinging to their origin nor seeking their end. They accepted and rejoiced in what came, forgot and returned to it—this is called not using the heart to harm the Dao, not using human effort to assist heaven. This is the true person, one whose body is the transformation itself. Serene and yielding, they entrust all to the supreme principle, thus coming and going without difficulty. They forget all transformations of beginning and end—how could they merely forget life while still probing the meaning of death? They do not question what they receive, meeting all with perfect accord. Their return is not guided by knowledge—it is the utmost attainment.\n\nAt birth, humans are still—this is heaven’s nature. Moved by things, they stir—this is nature’s desire. When the things that move people are endless and human desires know no bounds, heavenly principle is extinguished. The true person knows that using the heart turns one from the Dao, and assisting heaven harms life, so they do not act thus. In such a state, their heart is forgotten, their countenance still, their brow serene. They are chill as autumn, warm as spring, their joy and anger flowing with the four seasons, harmonizing with things yet leaving no trace of their depth.

      "translated_text": "The character *kuí* (頯) describes the appearance of great simplicity. The killing of things is not for the sake of authority. Those who embody the Dao and harmonize with change share the warmth and severity of cold and heat, yet never do so with intent. Nevertheless, they possess the demeanor of warmth and severity, the rhythm of life and death—thus, their likeness is lent to joy and anger. Without intent toward things, they do not violate what is fitting for them; with nothing unfitting, none can fathom their depth.\n\nTherefore, when the sage employs military force, he may overthrow a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. His beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet he does not act out of love for others. Thus, one who delights in connecting with things is no sage; one who has partiality is not benevolent; one who follows the seasons is not worthy; one who does not penetrate benefit and harm is no gentleman; one who pursues fame at the cost of self is no scholar; one who sacrifices himself without authenticity does not truly serve others.\n\nThose like Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these are servants of others’ service, followers of others’ paths, yet never do they follow their own. They cause the downfall of what people’s hearts already desire to destroy, and thus do not lose the people’s hearts. The bright sun ascends the heavens, illuminating the six directions—not out of love for others that it shines.\n\nThus, when the sage dwells in the world, he is warm like the spring sun’s natural harmony, so those who receive his grace do not feel gratitude. He is chill like the autumn frost’s natural descent, so those who wither do not bear resentment. The sage has no joy—it is simply that nothing obstructs him, and things flow of themselves. Perfect benevolence has no partiality, entrusting principle to preserve itself. One who adheres to the seasons does not compare to one who forgets time and naturally aligns with it. Unable to unify the paths of right and wrong and pursue benefit while avoiding harm, one injures virtue and burdens what is fitting.\n\nA true scholar abandons fame and finds contentment in himself, so his name matches his reality, and fortune responds to his person. One who loses his nature and forces himself to follow things is enslaved by much—how can he enslave others? These all abandon the self to imitate others, sacrificing themselves for external ends.\n\nThe true person of old bore righteousness yet did not form cliques; appeared insufficient yet did not submit. He was angular yet not rigid, expansive yet not florid. His countenance seemed joyful, his actions seemed compelled. His demeanor invited approach, his virtue restrained me. He seemed worldly yet untamable, appeared fond of seclusion yet was not forgetful of speech.\n\nTaking punishment as his body, ritual as his wings, knowledge as his timing, and virtue as his guide: taking punishment as his body, he was lenient in execution; taking ritual as his wings, he moved through the world; taking knowledge as his timing, he acted only when necessary; taking virtue as his guide, he spoke of reaching the heights with those who have feet, yet others truly believed him to be diligent in conduct.\n\nThus, his liking was singular, and his disliking was singular. His singularity was singular, and his non-singularity was singular. In his singularity, he was a companion of heaven; in his non-singularity, a companion of man. Heaven and man do not overcome one another—this is called the true person. He harmonized with things without forming factions. Empty and without excess, he seemed insufficient yet did not submit. Lowering himself, he was never not exalted. He wandered alone yet did not cling stubbornly. Vast and without attachment, he attained true substance.\n\nThe perfected person has no joy, yet is harmonious and at ease—thus he seems joyful. In movement and stillness, action and rest, he always dwells in the ultimate of necessity. He does not allow things to harm himself. He has no direction to pursue. The perfected person is not harsh, yet moves with the world—thus he seems harsh. Lofty and self-content, his depth is boundless, and none see his gate. Unknowing and unperceiving, his heavenly mechanism operates of itself—thus he seems forgetful.\n\nRitual is how the world conducts itself—it is not of his making. Knowledge responds to the times—it is not his initiative. Virtue is what others follow—it is not his creation. Entrusting governance to its natural course, though it may kill, it is lenient. Following what the world practices, nothing is left undone.\n\nThe mutual reception of high and low is an irreversible flow; the grouping of small and great is an inevitable tendency. Vast and without emotion, he is the repository of all knowledge. Receiving the convergence of a hundred streams, dwelling at the pinnacle of human guidance—what does he do? He entrusts the world’s knowledge to the times, commits to what is necessary, and leaves it to the world.\n\nThe heights are the root. Speaking in terms of nature, it is the root of nature. Things each have what suffices, and what suffices is the root. Entrusting the self-following of all virtues, he thus reaches the root with those who have feet. When the root is reached, principle is exhausted.\n\nAll this is accomplished by others—its completion does not lie with him. Thus, though he dwells at the pinnacle of ten thousand affairs, he is always at leisure and at ease, suddenly unaware of affairs passing through him, forgetful of words in his mouth. Yet people’s great delusion is to truly believe the perfected person is diligent in conduct.\n\nAlways without intent, he follows others—thus his likes and dislikes, his approvals and disapprovals, are no different from theirs. His singularity is the companion of heaven; his non-singularity, the companion of man. The true person unites heaven and man, equalizes self and other, not allowing his singularity to differ from his non-singularity.\n\nTo be without and yet not singular is heaven. The true person unites heaven and man, equalizes the myriad outcomes. The myriad outcomes do not oppose one another; heaven and man do not overcome one another. Thus, he is vast and without non-singularity, obscure and without non-presence, darkly merging with others.\n\nLife and death are fate; their alternation like night and day is heaven. What humans cannot partake in are all the conditions of things. He regards heaven as his father and loves it as his own body—how much more that which transcends it!",

      "translated_text": "Men deem having a lord superior to themselves, yet still give their lives for him—how much more should they do so for the true! The alternation of day and night is the constant Way of heaven. Thus, to know that life and death are the ultimate of fate, not mere happenstance—like night and day—what is there to cling to? The true person in daylight attains daylight, in night attains night. Taking life and death as day and night, is there anything he does not attain? That men harbor sorrow or joy over what they cannot control is but the sentiment of things, not principle.\n\nThe transcendent is called \"solitary transformation.\" The efficacy of mutual dependence is not as great as the perfection of solitary transformation. What men depend upon is heaven; what heaven engenders is solitary transformation. All men take heaven as their father, thus the changes of day and night, the cycles of cold and heat—they dare not resent them, but follow heaven and find peace in it. How much more should they submit to solitary transformation, reaching the realm of profound obscurity! How could they not yield to it? Once they yield, life and death, transformation—all follow fate.\n\nThe true is not borrowed from things but is natural. The natural cannot be avoided—how could this apply only to a lord’s command! When a spring dries, fish find themselves on land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praise Yao and blame Jie, better to forget both and merge with the Dao. Rather than love one another in scarcity, better to forget one another in abundance! Praise and blame both arise from insufficiency.\n\nThus, the perfectly sufficient forgets good and evil, leaves behind life and death, and unites with transformation, vast and unbounded. Hiding a boat in a ravine, concealing a mountain in a marsh—one calls this secure! Yet in the dead of night, a strong man carries it away, and the deluded do not know. Hiding the small and large has its proper place, yet there is still escape. But to hide the world within the world is to leave no room for escape—this is the great truth of all things. Men rejoice merely in possessing a human form. Yet the human form is but one of ten thousand transformations, never reaching an end—how could its joy be measured?\n\nThus, the sage roams where things cannot escape and all are preserved. Excelling in early death, excelling in old age, excelling in beginning, excelling in end—men still emulate him, how much more the ten thousand things that depend on it, and the one transformation they await! Form, birth, aging, death—all are myself. Thus, form carries me, birth labors me, aging rests me, death gives me repose. Though these four change, they have never ceased to be me—why should I regret them? Death and life are both fate. Without goodness, there is death; with goodness, there is life—not goodness alone. If one takes my life as good, then my death is also good.\n\nHaving spoken of the inescapability of life, death, and transformation, one first presents the ultimate of inescapability, then clarifies it with the sign of inevitable change, to yield to transformation without attachment. The power of powerlessness is greatest in transformation; thus, it lifts heaven and earth to pursue the new, shoulders mountains and ridges to discard the old. Without the slightest pause, in an instant it has traversed the new—thus, heaven and earth and the ten thousand things never cease to shift. The world is ever new, yet men take it as old; boats daily change, yet they see them as before; mountains daily alter, yet they see them as the same. Now, in the time it takes to cross an arm, all has departed into obscurity. Thus, the \"I\" of a moment ago is no longer the \"I\" of now. I and the present both pass away—how could one cling to the past? Yet the world does not perceive this, stubbornly believing what it encounters can be grasped and held—how deluded!\n\nHaving nothing to hide and yielding entirely, one merges with things without obstruction, unites with transformation without division. Thus, there is no outside, no inside, no death, no life—embodying heaven and earth and uniting with transformation, seeking escape yet finding none. This is the great truth of constant existence, not the petty intent of a single corner. The human form is but one encounter among ten thousand transformations—hardly worth special delight. Within the boundless, all encounters are like the human form—how could only the human form bring joy while other things have none!\n\n◎ Qingfan’s note: *Wen Xuan*’s commentary on Jia Yi’s \"Fu on the Owl\" cites Sima [Biao] as saying: \"It will again transform into nothingness.\" The *Shiwen* is incomplete.\n\nOriginally not human, it transformed into human—having transformed into human, it lost its former state. Losing its former state and rejoicing is rejoicing in what it encounters. Transformation is endless—what is there it does not encounter? Rejoicing in what it encounters, how could its joy have an end! The sage wanders the paths of transformation, drifts upon the stream of daily renewal. The ten thousand things and ten thousand transformations transform with him; transformation is boundless, and he is boundless with it—who can escape it? In life, it is gone; in death, it remains—when is it not present? This is to equalize within a hundred years, not to favor youth and resent age, yet still unable to embody transformation and equalize life and death. Nevertheless, its purity is sufficient to serve as a teacher for others.\n\nThis is to merge with the ten thousand things in profound unity and embody transformation—thus, it is fitting that the world takes it as its model. The Dao has essence and trustworthiness, is without action and without form; it can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted, existing before heaven and earth, enduring since ancient times. It spiritually animates ghosts and gods, gives birth to heaven and earth. It is before the Great Ultimate yet not high, beneath the Six Poles yet not deep, born before heaven and earth yet not long-lasting, older than antiquity yet not aged.\n\nXiwei attained it and thereby harnessed heaven and earth; Fuxi attained it and thereby penetrated the Mother of Qi; the Northern Dipper attained it and never erred through all ages; the sun and moon attained it and never ceased through all ages; Kanpi attained it and thereby penetrated Kunlun; Feng Yi attained it and thereby roamed the great rivers; Jianwu attained it and thereby dwelled on the great mountains; the Yellow Emperor attained it and thereby ascended the cloudy heavens; Zhuanxu attained it and thereby dwelled in the Dark Palace; Yuqiang attained it and stood at the North Pole; the Queen Mother of the West attained it and sat in Shaoguang—none knew its beginning, none knew its end. Pengzu attained it and lived from the time of Youyu to the Five Hegemons; Fu Yue attained it and served as minister to Wu Ding, ruling the world, riding the Eastern Ridge and straddling the Tail of the Winnowing Basket to join the ranks of the stars.",

Not being numinous, ghosts and emperors become numinous of themselves—this is the numinosity of non-numinosity. Not giving birth, heaven and earth are born of themselves—this is the birth of non-birth.\n\nThus, the numinosity of the numinous is insufficient to be numinous, while non-numinosity is truly numinous. What achievement is there to claim? What affair is there to rely upon? The Way’s ubiquity means that where it is high, there is no height; where it is deep, there is no depth; where it is enduring, there is no duration; where it is old, there is no age. It is everywhere, yet wherever it is, it is nothing.\n\nMoreover, above and below, nothing fails to reach it—one cannot speak of it in terms of high or low. Within and without, nothing fails to attain it—one cannot name it in terms of inner or outer. Moving in unison with transformation, one cannot speak of it as enduring. Ever without beginning or end, one cannot call it old.\n\nThe Way is incapable. This speaks of attaining it through the Way, yet only clarifies that it is self-attained. Self-attained—yet the Way cannot cause one to attain it; nor, when I have not attained it, can I bring about attainment. Thus, all who attain it neither rely on the Way externally nor depend on themselves internally, but suddenly attain it of themselves and transform alone.\n\nThe difficulty of life is like this self-transformation and self-attainment. Once life is attained, why fear its loss and strive for it? Thus, striving for life is insufficient to preserve life, for life does not arise from oneself—striving for it only harms one’s true life.\n\nNanbo Zikui asked Nü Yu, “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child. Why is this?” Nü Yu replied, “I have heard the Way.”",

You are not the right person. Now, Pulam Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Way of a sage, while I possess the Way of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping that he might indeed become a sage. If not, to impart the Way of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. Yet I persisted in teaching him, and after three days he was able to let go of the world. Having let go of the world, I again persisted, and after seven days he was able to let go of things. Having let go of things, I persisted once more, and after nine days he was able to let go of life. Having let go of life, he could then attain clarity at dawn. With clarity at dawn, he could then perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, he could then transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, he could then enter into that which is neither dead nor alive. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life to life does not live. As a thing, it sends nothing forth without escort, meets nothing without welcome, destroys nothing without ruin, and completes nothing without fulfillment. Its name is *yingning*—tranquility through engagement. *Yingning* is that which is completed only after engagement.”\n\n*Wai* means “to let go.” Things are what one requires morning and night, what is intimately tied to the self and hard to forget. To let go of them entirely—this is *du yi*. To let go of life is to cease hating death; ceasing to hate death, one is at peace with whatever one encounters, suddenly unobstructed, acting in accord with the moment—this is clarity at dawn. One moves in unison with the solitary. Clinging to life gives rise to death; hating death gives rise to life. Thus, without clinging and without hatred, one can transcend death and life. Allowing things to escort themselves, nothing is not escorted. Allowing things to welcome themselves, nothing is not welcomed. Allowing things to destroy themselves, nothing is not destroyed. Allowing things to complete themselves, nothing is not completed. One who merges with things—though things entangle, they entangle yet remain ever tranquil.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, “From whom did you alone hear this?”\nHe replied, “I heard it from the disciple of *Fumo*, the disciple of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*, the grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*, *Zhanming* heard it from *Niexu*, *Niexu* heard it from *Xuyi*, *Xuyi* heard it from *Yu’ou*, *Yu’ou* heard it from *Xuanming*, *Xuanming* heard it from *Canliao*, and *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*.”\n\nIf things entangle yet one alone remains unentangled, one is ruined.",

      "translated_text": "\"Jìn\" means gradual. When the body undergoes transformation and harmonizes with change, there is nowhere it does not adapt, and no adaptation that is impossible. What one encounters in the moment is called by the world ‘gain.’ Since time does not pause for even an instant, to comply and move on is called by the world ‘loss.’ If one cannot release oneself, then the myriad things bind one together.\n\nThus, one who can release is released from all things, while one who cannot release is released from nothing. Heaven cannot be without day and night—how can I be without life and death and resent it?\n\nSoon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zili went to see him and said, \"Shoo! Away! Do not be startled by transformation!\" Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to him: \"How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a mouse’s liver? Or an insect’s limb?\"\n\nLife and death are but waking and sleeping. By principle, one ought to sleep—one does not wish to be startled awake. To transform and die is fitting; there is no need to be alarmed by it.\n\nZilai said, \"For a child, parents may command east or west, north or south, and one must obey. Yin and yang are no less commanding than parents. If they approach my death and I do not heed them, I would be defiant—what fault would lie with them? The great earth bears me with form, labors me with life, eases me with age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.\n\nNow, when the great smith casts metal, if the metal leaps up and says, ‘I must become a *Mo Ye* sword!’ the smith will surely deem it an inauspicious metal. Now, if one acquires a human form and says, ‘I am human! I am human!’ the Creator will surely deem it an inauspicious person. If one takes heaven and earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smith, where could one go and not be acceptable?\"\n\nHe then fell into a deep sleep and awoke with a start.\n\nSince ancient times, some have been able to defy their parents’ commands, but none have been able to defy the changes of yin and yang or resist the cycle of day and night. Life and death are but day and night—nothing distant. When the time comes to die, it is not something to forbid. To stubbornly harbor resistance is to defy principle and hasten one’s death. The swiftness of death arises from one’s own defiance, not from death itself.\n\n*Bi* refers to death; while alive, one regards death as *bi*. Principle is always present. \"I am human! I am human!\"—this is merely the wish to remain human, just as metal leaping up is known to be inauspicious, yet one cannot allow it to transform of its own accord.\n\nThe Dao of transformation encounters nothing it does not meet. Now, to encounter a human form—was this done deliberately? Life is not created deliberately; it arises naturally in time. To strive to possess it is delusion. People know that metal bound by attachment is inauspicious, so when one realizes one’s own nature is no different from metal, the attachments of the heart can be released. Once released, there is nothing that cannot be released.\n\nWaking and sleeping remain as they are, without life and death burdening the heart.\n\nZisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang spoke to one another: \"Who can join together without joining, act for one another without acting? Who can ascend to heaven and wander in the mists, roam without limit, forget life, and have no end?\"\n\nOne who embodies heaven and earth and darkly merges with transformation—though hands and feet have different functions and the five organs distinct offices, they never join together yet all joints harmonize: this is joining without joining. They never act for one another yet inner and outer mutually aid: this is acting without acting. If one instead employs the mind to worry over hands and feet, or moves limbs to manage the five organs, the more one strives, the more inner and outer become exhausted.\n\nThus, one who takes the world as a single body has no partiality in its midst. Entrusting all things without exception, forgetting life, one forgets all—hence one can follow change and adapt to transformation, with nothing left incomplete.\n\nThe three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in accord, and so became friends. Yet was this truly friendship? It was but a lodging of luminous intimacy, free from the nearness of affectionate attachment.\"",

There has never been one who attains the utmost of wandering beyond yet does not merge within, nor one who merges within yet does not wander beyond. Thus the sage constantly wanders beyond to merge within, is without mind to follow what is, and so though all day long he appears in form, his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Though he bends and rises amid ten thousand affairs, he is serene and at ease. To see form yet not reach spirit—this is the common burden of the world.\n\nThus when one sees him moving with the crowd, none can say he abandons things and leaves men behind; when one sees him embodying transformation and responding to affairs, none can say he sits in forgetfulness and attains self-possession. How could it be only the sage who is not thus? It must be said that the ultimate principle has no such thing.\n\nTherefore, when Zhuangzi sought to clarify the lineage of the great tradition to awaken the world, had he simply praised Confucius in this way, some might have relied on what they saw to reject it. So he transcended the sage’s inner traces and lodged the beyond in those few disciples. One should forget what is lodged to seek the great meaning of his composition, and then the Way of wandering beyond to merge within will be clear and self-evident. Thus Zhuangzi’s book is a discourse that engages the world while transcending it.\n\nCondolences are a near affair of the world within; to apply them to the world beyond is shallow. All is merged, thus there is no duality. Like a wart that hangs of itself, a growth that clings of itself—this is the temporary gathering of qi, not what one delights in. Like an abscess that bursts of itself, a sore that drains of itself—this is the natural dispersal of qi, not what one regrets. Life and death alternate without end; going along with them, there is nowhere one cannot go. Thus one does not know where victory or defeat lies.\n\n*\"Assuming\"* means *\"relying on.\"* Now life and death, gathering and dispersal, change without pattern—all are strange things. There is nothing strange that is not relied upon, so though what is relied upon differs, together they form a single body. Entrusting them to the five organs is still forgetting—what thing is worth recognizing? Without recognition from the start, one can freely follow the path of transformation, darkly merge with the waves of turning and returning, and not know where beginning or end reaches its limit. This is to wander merged in principle.\n\nThe *\"work of non-action\"* is not mere folded-hands silence; *\"beyond the dust and grime\"* is not hiding in mountains and forests. What he shows to the crowd is but their dust and grime—it is not the dark merging of the world beyond. Zigong had not heard of *\"nature and the Way of Heaven,\"* so he saw what he relied upon but not what he relied upon *for.*\n\nWhat one relies upon *for* is no reliance—how could the world be aware of it? Confucius said: *\"Qiu is a man punished by Heaven. Nevertheless, I share this with you.\"*",
      "overlap_context": "e more inner and outer become exhausted.\n\nThus, one who takes the world as a single body has no partiality in its midst. Entrusting all things without exception, forgetting life, one forgets all—hence one can follow change and adapt to transformation, with nothing left incomplete.\n\nThe three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in accord, and so became friends. Yet was this truly friendship? It was but a lodging of luminous intimacy, free from the nearness of affectionate attachment.\"",

      "translated_text": "In the state of Lu, they observed his rites, while Yan Hui examined his heart. Confucius said: \"Mengsun Cai has fully realized it—he has advanced beyond knowledge. Yet even in seeking simplicity, he finds no attainment, for he has already attained simplicity. Mengsun Cai knows not why he lives, nor why he dies. He knows not what to follow first, nor what to follow after. As if transformed into things, he awaits the transformations he does not know. Moreover, as he is about to transform, how could he know what is not yet transformed? As he is about to remain untransformed, how could he know what has already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have not yet awakened!\n\nFurthermore, he may take on startled forms, yet his heart remains undamaged; he may dwell in a new abode, yet his essence is not depleted. Mengsun Cai alone is awake—when others weep, he weeps too, for that is simply what is fitting for him. And yet, we merely share this understanding in our ears—how could we be certain that what I call ‘I’ is not truly ‘I’? Suppose you dream of being a bird soaring through the heavens, or a fish diving into the depths. How can we know whether the speaker now is awake or dreaming? When one attains perfect ease, laughter does not follow; when laughter is offered, it does not lead to forced cheer. Resting in spontaneity and departing with transformation, one enters the vast oneness of Heaven.\"\n\nOne who fully grasps the principle of life and death, responding fittingly to both inner and outer, moves in accordance with Heaven’s course—this is beyond the reach of mere knowledge. To select and choose between life and death without discerning their difference is like the progression of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Having already simplified and found no distinction, there is nothing not at ease. With nothing not at ease, one does not weigh life and death in the mind but entrusts them to spontaneous transformation. Whatever one encounters, one is at peace. Not resisting transformation, life and death turn and merge with it as one, just as one forgets what one knows in the present—how could one anticipate what is unknown and fret over it in advance? Having transformed and come to life, how could one know the time before birth? Not yet transformed and facing death, how could one know what comes after? Thus, there is nothing to avoid or pursue, and one moves together with transformation.\n\nLife and death are but waking and dreaming. Now, if in a dream one believes oneself awake, there is no way to prove that waking is not also a dream. If one cannot prove that waking is not a dream, then one also cannot prove that life is not death. Whether in life, death, waking, or dreaming, we know not where we stand. Yet in whatever one encounters, there is nothing not self-attained—why grieve over this while worrying about that? Transformation merely startles the form, so one does not allow life and death to burden the heart. The changes of the bodily frame are but daily renewals of one’s dwelling—one’s nature does not take them as death.\n\nThe one who is always awake meets nothing with resistance, so when others weep, he weeps too—this is simply what is fitting for him. Life, death, and transformation—all are mine. Since all are mine, what have I lost? Never having lost myself, what cause have I for sorrow? Without resistance, when others weep, he weeps; without sorrow, though he weeps, he is not grieved. Embracing all as mine, he harmonizes inner and outer, pervades past and present, and daily renews with transformation—how could he know where his true self resides? This means there is nowhere he does not find himself at ease.\n\nWhen dreaming, one believes oneself awake—how then can one know that the present is not a dream? How can one know it is not waking? The transformations of waking and dreaming are boundless, so the changes of life and death are nothing to regret. Wherever one arrives is fitting, so one forgets the fitting—thus laughter does not follow. *Pai* means to shift or move on. In ritual, weeping must be mournful, laughter must be joyful—if sorrow and joy linger in the heart, one cannot move with ease. But Mengsun always abides in ease, so though he weeps, he is not grieved, and moves together with transformation. At peace with shifting and departing with transformation, he enters the silence and becomes one with Heaven.\"\n\nFrom this point up to Zisi, their attainment is the same. The mourning they observe differs, so their songs and weeping are not alike.\n\nYi’erzi visited Xu You, who asked: \"How has Yao aided you?\" *Zi* here means to supply or assist. Yi’erzi replied: \"Yao told me: ‘You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right from wrong.’\" Xu You said: \"Why then have you come here? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you wander the boundless, carefree, and ever-shifting paths?\"",

Now, wrapping rice to feed him was but following Heaven’s principle and happening of itself—it was not that he went because of acting for him. To suspect the presence of emotion is to rush forth and depart far from the principle.\n\nHe said: \"I pondered what brought me to this extremity but found no answer. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers without partiality, Earth bears without partiality—would Heaven and Earth single me out for poverty? I sought the one who caused this but could not find him! Yet to reach this extremity—such is fate!\" These words declare that all things are natural, with no doer behind them.\n\n---\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters,\" \"Responding as Emperor,\" Chapter Seven of the* Zhuangzi:\n\nNie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Thereupon Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.\n\nMaster Pu Yi said: \"Have you only now come to know this? The Lord of Yu did not match the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu concealed benevolence to entice men—he did gain men, yet never emerged from the realm of the unhuman. The Lord of Tai slept in tranquil ease, awoke in carefree leisure. Now he took himself for a horse, now for an ox. His knowledge was true to his nature, his virtue most genuine, and he never entered the realm of the unhuman.\"\n\nOne who is without intent and follows self-transformation is fit to be emperor. The Lord of Yu and the Lord of Tai were but traces of worldly affairs, not that by which traces are made. That by which traces are made is traceless—who in the world could name it? Never having been named, what victory or defeat could there be? Yet the traceless one rides the myriad changes, treads the ten thousand ages. The world has its level plains and perilous passes, so traces may fall short. Those who take what they love as the \"human\" and what they hate as the \"unhuman\" are merely bounded by the realm of right and wrong. One who can emerge from the realm of the unhuman must enter the realm where nothing is unhuman. Thus there is no gain, no loss, no right, no wrong—how could it be merely concealing benevolence to entice men! Being thus, what \"human\" or \"unhuman\" could there be? This may be called emerging from the realm of the unhuman. Following one’s own knowledge, thus the emotions are true. Following one’s own attainment, thus there is no falsity. Not entering the realm of right and wrong, one cuts off the age of the Lord of Yu.\n\n---\n\nJian Wu met Jie Yu the Madman.\n\nJie Yu asked: \"What did Ri Zhongshi tell you?\"\n\nJian Wu said: \"He told me that a ruler of men, issuing his own standards of laws, models, principles, and measures, who would dare not listen and be transformed?\"\n\nJie Yu said: \"This is deceptive virtue.

      "translated_text": "To entrust all things to their own nature is to accomplish without action; to impose one’s will upon the world with a single body is to leave no task complete and no burden borne. One must preserve only what lies within the bounds of one’s nature. Each fulfills its allotted span of life. One does not attempt what one cannot. Even birds and beasts each have their means of self-preservation—thus when emperors and kings leave them to their own devices without interference, they achieve completion on their own. Have you truly failed to see how these two creatures each preserve themselves without instruction?\n\nTian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and arrived at the banks of the Liao River, where he encountered an unnamed man and asked, “I beg to inquire how to govern the world.” The unnamed man replied, “Away with you! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask such an untimely question? I am about to become one with the Creator. When I weary of this, I will ride the boundless bird beyond the six directions and wander in the land of Nothingness, dwelling in the vast wilderness. Why would you trouble my heart with governing the world?”\n\nTo ask how to govern the world is not to rise from the Great Beginning nor to rest in the Dark and Obscure. Let each person act according to their own nature. \"Boundless\" refers to the myriad fragments. Riding the myriad fragments, one gallops through the ten thousand things, thus able to move freely without constraint or obstruction. To leave all things to their own sphere of self-realization is to achieve order without governance.\n\nHe asked the unnamed man again, “If you let your mind wander in simplicity, harmonize your qi with emptiness, follow things as they are without imposing private designs, then the world will be well-ordered.” To follow one’s nature without adornment is simplicity. To rest in stillness within one’s nature is emptiness. To let nature take its course is impartiality; to seek to augment it with personal desire is partiality. Partiality ultimately fails to sustain life, while following impartiality preserves it.\n\nYang Ziju visited Lao Dan and said, “Suppose there were a man swift, strong, and resolute, with keen perception and clear understanding, who studies the Dao without weariness—could such a one be compared to a enlightened king?” Lao Dan replied, “Such a one, in the eyes of the sage, is like a clerk or artisan, bound by skill and toil, exhausting his body and startling his mind. Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards attract hunters, and the agility of apes and monkeys invites capture. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”\n\nYang Ziju, abashed, said, “I venture to ask about the governance of an enlightened king.” Lao Dan replied, “Such exertions cannot secure one’s own person—how could they compare to the sage-king? These are all cases of being ensnared by one’s own patterns and skills, not of riding emptiness to master the boundless.”\n\nLao Dan continued, “The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. He remains nameless, allowing things to rejoice in themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in Nothingness.”\n\nIf the world lacked an enlightened king, none could attain self-realization. That they do so is truly the king’s achievement—yet his achievement lies in non-action and entrusting the world to itself. When all in the world act according to their own nature, it seems as though the enlightened king played no part. The enlightened king fully realizes the nature of things, so each person claims, “I am thus of myself,” unaware of their reliance on him. Though his achievements cover the world, he does not claim them as his own, so all things believe they have attained their own joy.\n\nHe dwells in the path of transformation, daily renewed and without fixed form. Identifying with the ten thousand things, he wanders in emptiness. If one cannot merge with things, one is constantly at odds with them—how then could one wander in emptiness?\n\nIn Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew the life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death of men, predicting them by year, month, or day with godlike accuracy. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. Liezi met him and was enchanted. Returning home, he told Huzi, “At first I thought your Dao was supreme, but now I see there is something even greater.” He did not delight in hearing his own death date.",

The mechanism always arises from the utmost height, and when it moves and is good for the other, the other perceives it.\n\nThe next day, Liezi again brought Ji Xian to see Huzi.

      "translated_text": "Though transformations are ceaseless, their roots ever lie deep in hidden depths. Without intent, one follows the transformations of things, drifting unbound by any tether. As decay and dissolution shift like the world’s currents, there is nowhere one does not adapt. The perfected person is one, yet responds to the world’s changes and moves with the times—thus the physiognomist could find no place to fix his gaze, lost himself, and fled. This illustrates that one who would respond as emperor or king has no fixed method.\n\nThereafter, Liezi returned home believing he had never yet begun to learn. For three years he did not go out, cooked for his wife, and fed pigs as he would feed people, showing no partiality in his dealings. Carved and polished, he returned to simplicity, standing alone as a mere clod of earth. Though the world swirled in confusion, he remained thus to the end. He forgot distinctions of noble and base, attending only to what he encountered. He cast aside ornament and sought substance, shedding external embellishments. Though active, his true nature never scattered.\n\nLet things each fulfill their own ends. Be not the host of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of knowledge. Embrace the boundless and wander without trace. Exhaust what you have received from Heaven, yet perceive no gain—it is emptiness alone! The perfected person’s mind is like a mirror: it neither sends forth nor welcomes, responds yet does not store, and thus can master things without harm. Following things, each finds its proper name. Let things each devise their own plans, entrust tasks to each, and without intent, let each master its own knowledge.\n\nFollowing the self-so of the world, one may gallop through the ten thousand things without limit. Entrusting oneself to things, one leaves no tracks. When one has enough, one stops—perceiving gain, one does not know when to stop. Without emptiness, one cannot bear the weight of all realities. Reflecting things without emotion, one responds when they come and ceases when they go. Things arrive and are mirrored; the mirror does not act with intent, so though the world be vast, there is no weariness of spirit.\n\nThe emperor of the Southern Sea was named Sudden, the emperor of the Northern Sea was named Fleeting, and the emperor of the Central Realm was named Chaos. Sudden and Fleeting often met in the land of Chaos, who treated them very well. Sudden and Fleeting plotted to repay Chaos’s virtue, saying, “All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only this one lacks them. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Chaos died. Those who act ruin things.\n\nXiang Xiu and Guo Xiang’s *Commentary on the Zhuangzi*\n*Zhuangzi, Inner Chapters, “Free and Easy Wandering”*\n\nThough small and great differ, when released into the field of self-contentment, things follow their nature, affairs match their capacities, and each fits its allotted place—free and easy wandering is one. How could there be victory or defeat among them?\n\nIn the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun’s greatness—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The reality of the Peng and the Kun, I have not yet fathomed. The great purport of the *Zhuangzi* lies in free and easy wandering, non-action and self-contentment. Thus it exhausts the extremes of small and great to clarify the fittingness of one’s allotted nature. Those of far-reaching vision should grasp its essential convergence and let go of its incidental lodgings, not needing to quibble over every detail with the living. As long as it does not harm the grand aim, all may be roughly understood.\n\nThe Peng’s back—no one knows how many thousand *li* it spans. Roused to flight, its wings are like clouds hanging from the sky. This bird, when the sea surges, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond. Only a dark sea suffices to bear its body, only ninety thousand *li* suffice to support its wings. Is this a fondness for the strange? Simply, great things must arise from great places, and great places must give rise to such great things—this principle is naturally so, not to be feared as a loss. Why trouble the mind over it?\n\n*Qi Xie* is a record of marvels. It says: “When the Peng journeys to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, then spirals upward on the whirlwind for ninety thousand *li*. With wings so vast, it is difficult to lift, so it must beat the whirlwind to ascend—only ninety thousand *li* suffice to sustain itself. With such wings, how could it suddenly rise and descend a few fathoms? All this is unavoidable, not a matter of delight. It departs on the six-month wind.”",

I could not reach him.” Huzi said, “Earlier, I showed him what has never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and followed his flow, so he knew not who or what I was.

      "translated_text": "The great bird departs for half a year before resting at the Celestial Pond; the small bird flies for half a morning before darting to the elm or sandalwood to alight. Though their capacities differ, in following their nature they are one. The wild horses of the air, the motes of dust—all living things are blown by one another’s breath. These are but what the Peng relies upon to fly.\n\nThe \"wild horses\" are wandering *qi*. Is the deep blue of the sky its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no end? From above, the Peng sees the earth as we see the sky—thus it halts and sets its course southward, for it knows not the distance in *li*, but only that it has strength enough to go. If water is not deep, it cannot bear a great boat. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the floor, and a mustard seed becomes a boat; place a cup there, and it sticks fast—for the water is shallow and the boat too large. This makes clear why the Peng flies so high: its wings are vast. A small creature requires little, so a great one cannot make do with less. Thus there is a limit to principle, a fixed bound to things; each suffices for its task, and their fulfillment is one.\n\nIf one forgets the self and pursues life beyond what is fitting, undertaking what one’s strength cannot bear and acting against one’s nature, then even wings spanning the sky cannot escape exhaustion, nor can a sudden flight avoid distress. If the wind is not deep, it cannot bear great wings. Only when the wind lies ninety thousand *li* below does it now ride the gale; only when it bears the weight of heaven and brushes aside all obstacles does it now set its course south. Yet this is not a love of height or longing for distance—without accumulated wind, there would be no passage.\n\nThis is the Peng’s freedom.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: *\"We burst forth and fly, darting to the elm or sandalwood to rest, and if we fall short, we simply drop to the ground—why go ninety thousand *li* to the south?\"* If one is content in one’s nature, then even the great Peng has no cause to value itself above the small bird, nor does the small bird envy the Celestial Pond—for its desires are already fulfilled. Though great and small differ, their freedom is one.\n\nOne who journeys to the near wilds returns in a day with a full belly; one who travels a hundred *li* must pound grain the night before; one who goes a thousand *li* must gather provisions for three months. The farther the destination, the more provisions are needed—just as the greater the wings, the deeper the *qi* must be. What do these two creatures know? (The two creatures refer to the Peng and the shrimp.) Comparing great to small equalizes their differing aims. Why do their aims differ? Not because they choose to, but because it is naturally so. It is natural—not by effort.\n\nThis is the essence of freedom. Small knowledge does not reach great knowledge; short years do not reach long years. Each thing has its nature, each nature its limit—like years and knowledge, how could mere striving attain them? From here to Liezi, examples of long and short years and knowledge are given, each true to its own measure, none sufficient to surpass the other. Only the person free of dependence, who forgets self and others, who obscures these differences—only such a one, whose freedom is without merit, can unite great and small. For if there were great and small, then even the Peng and the sparrow, the minister and the wind-rider, would be bound by things. In life and death, only the one without life or death is limitless; if there were life and death, then even the great *chun* tree and the mayfly, Pengzu and the morning mushroom, would be equal in brevity.\n\nThus, to wander without great or small is to be without end; to be lost in neither life nor death is to be without limit. But if freedom is bound to a direction, then even if released to roam, it will reach an end—for it is not yet free of dependence. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not the waxing and waning of the moon; the cricket knows not spring and autumn—these are short years. South of Chu there is the *Mingling* tree, for which five hundred years are a spring, five hundred years an autumn; in high antiquity there was the great *zhuang* tree, for which eight thousand years are a spring, eight thousand years an autumn—these are long years. Yet Pengzu alone is famed for his longevity; for common people to compare themselves to him is truly pitiable! The disparity in years and knowledge is so vast—compared to what common people find lamentable, this is even more lamentable. Yet people do not grieve this, for each nature has its limit. If one knows this limit, then even the slightest difference cannot be bridged—what in the world is there to grieve?\n\nThings do not long for what is small because of its smallness, nor must the small envy the great. Thus, the difference between great and small has its fixed measure, beyond the reach of envy or desire—so the burden of envy and desire can be cut off. Grief arises from burden; when burden is gone, grief departs. When grief departs, life and nature are at peace—this has never been otherwise.\n\nThis is what Tang asked Ji about. Tang’s question to Ji also spoke of each thing having its limit, and that following it brings harmony—thus Zhuangzi affirmed his question.\n\nBeyond the barren north lies the Dark Sea, the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, thousands of *li* wide, whose length is unknown—its name is Kun. There is a bird there, its name Peng, its back like Mount Tai, its wings like clouds hanging from the sky. It rides the whirlwind and the ram’s-horn gale to ascend ninety thousand *li*, piercing the clouds and bearing the blue sky, then sets its course south, bound for the Southern Darkness.",

      "translated_text": "The marsh sparrow laughed at it, saying: \"Where is it off to now? I leap and bound upward, but descend after only a few *ren*, soaring among the mugwort and wormwood—this is the perfection of flight. And where is *it* off to now?\" This is the distinction between small and great. Each attains its nature as perfection and exhausts itself as the limit. Earlier, it was said that the two creatures differ, and so their destinations differ—one soars to the Celestial Pond, the other reaches only the elm and sandalwood—each is content with its form and finds sufficiency, unaware of why it is so. Now, speaking of the distinction between small and great, each has its natural endowment. This is not something attainable through striving or admiration. Each rests in its own nature, untroubled by their differences, and so the point is reiterated.\n\nThus, those whose knowledge suffices for one office, whose conduct matches one village, whose virtue aligns with one lord, or whose merit wins one state—such men regard themselves as this sparrow does, content within their own bounds, like a bird self-satisfied in its domain. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. Because he has not yet attained equality, he finds cause to laugh. Moreover, though the whole world praises him, he is not encouraged; though the whole world blames him, he is not disheartened. He has clearly settled the division between inner and outer, regarding himself as inner and all else as outer. He distinguishes the boundary between honor and disgrace, honoring himself and disgracing others. This is the limit. He cannot surpass it. Yet in his dealings with the world, he is not restless. He is sufficient unto himself, and so remains at ease in the world. Even so, he has not yet established the ultimate. He can affirm himself, but cannot be without something to affirm.\n\nLiezi rode the wind and traveled, lightly and skillfully. After fifteen days, he returned. In his pursuit of good fortune, he was not restless. He naturally rode the wind, not seeking knowledge through restless effort. Though he avoided walking, he still depended on something. Without wind, he could not travel—this is necessarily dependence. Only one who accomplishes all without reliance is free from dependence.\n\nAs for one who rides the constancy of Heaven and Earth, and harnesses the transformations of the six *qi*, roaming the boundless—what does *he* depend on? Heaven and Earth are the collective names for the myriad things. Heaven and Earth take the myriad things as their body, and the myriad things must take spontaneity as their constancy. Spontaneity is that which is not done yet naturally is. Thus, the great Peng’s ability to ascend, the marsh sparrow’s ability to descend, the tree stump’s ability to grow, the morning mushroom’s ability to be short—all these are what spontaneity enables, not what effort enables. What is not done yet naturally is, this is constancy. Therefore, to ride the constancy of Heaven and Earth is to follow the nature of the myriad things; to harness the transformations of the six *qi* is to roam the paths of change. Proceeding thus, where is there an end? What is harnessed and ridden—what more is there to depend on? This is the carefree wandering of one of utmost virtue, who merges self and other in mystery.\n\nIf there is dependence, then even Liezi’s lightness and skill cannot enable him to travel without wind. He must obtain what he depends on before attaining carefree wandering—how much more so for the great Peng! Only one who merges with things and follows great change can be without dependence and always penetrate. Yet even those who depend on something, if they do not lose what they depend on, are equal to the great penetration. Thus, whether dependent or independent, there is nothing that cannot be equalized. When each rests in its nature, the heavenly mechanism unfolds of itself, receiving without awareness—then there is nothing that cannot be distinct. Yet even independence is insufficient to distinguish dependence, let alone the great and small of those who depend!\n\nThus it is said: The Perfect Man has no self; having no self, he follows things and so attains. The Spirit Man has no merit; things have never thanked spontaneity for their lives, yet must rely on acupuncture and stone—when principle reaches its limit, traces vanish. Now, following without assisting, one becomes one with the ultimate principle, and so has no merit. The Sage has no name. The Sage is merely the name for things attaining their nature—this is insufficient to name how they attain it.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, saying: \"The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for it to shine? The timely rain has fallen, yet irrigation continues—is it not laborious for it to moisten? If you stand forth, the world will be well-governed, yet I still occupy the throne. I see myself as lacking. Please take the world.\" Xu You replied: \"You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. One who can make the world well-governed does not govern the world. Thus, Yao governs by not governing, not by governing and thereby governing. Now, Xu You clearly sees that once governed, there is nothing to depend on, yet the governance actually comes from Yao. Thus, his words 'you govern' should be forgotten to seek what they imply. Yet some say that one who governs and thereby governs is Yao, while one who does not govern yet enables Yao to govern is Xu You—this is far from the truth. Governance arises from non-governance; action emerges from non-action. Taking from Yao is sufficient—why borrow from Xu You? If one claims that only by folding one’s arms in the mountains and forests can one be called non-active, this is why the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi are rejected by those in power. Those in power necessarily dwell in the realm of action and do not return—this is the reason. Yet if I were to replace you, would I do so for the sake of a name? A name is but the guest of reality.\"",

      "translated_text": "Shall I then be but a guest? One who takes up the burden of self responds to things, while one who follows things moves with them without opposition. Thus, Yao had no counterpart in the world, while Xu You stood as an equal to Qi and Xie. How can this be so? One who merges with things cannot be separated from them. Therefore, with a mind devoid of intent, responses arise spontaneously, following only what is sensed—adrift like a boat untethered, neither east nor west being its own. Thus, wherever one goes, one shares all with the people, and wherever one turns, one becomes the lord of the world. To rule in this way is like the world elevating itself—such is the virtue of the lord. But if one stands alone, loftily atop a mountain’s peak, this is not the natural inclination of human feeling, for to cling to oneness is but a partial preference. How can one claim this exclusively? Such a one is but a single thing among the common, an outer minister to Yao. If an outer minister were to replace the inner lord, this would be to bear the name of lordship without its true responsibility.\n\nThe wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs no more than a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than its fill. Each nature has its limit—if that limit is satisfied, then the rest of the world’s wealth is superfluous. Return to your repose, my lord—I have no use for the world! If you have no use for it, why does Yao alone possess it? Truly, one who embraces openness has no fixed direction, and so the world delights in elevating him without weariness.\n\nThough the cook does not prepare the meal, the invocator does not step beyond the altar to take his place. Cook and invocator each abide in their proper office; birds and beasts, the myriad things, each find sufficiency in what they receive; Yao and Xu You each rest in their allotted place—this is the ultimate reality of the world. Each attains their reality—what more is there to do? It is enough to attain it oneself.\n\nThus, though the paths of Yao and Xu You differ, in their freedom they are one. Jian Wu asked Lian Shu: *\"I heard Jie Yu’s words—they were vast yet without measure, sweeping away without return. I was startled and terrified by them, like the Milky Way stretching endlessly. They were so extreme, so far from human feeling!\"* Lian Shu said: *\"What did he say?\"* Jian Wu replied: *\"On the distant Guye Mountain dwells a spirit-person, their skin like ice and snow, their grace like a maiden’s. These are but borrowed words. The spirit-person is what we now call the sage. Though the sage may sit in the ancestral hall, their heart is no different from one in the mountains and forests—how could the world recognize this? They see only the yellow canopy and jade seal and think these enough to bind their heart; they see them traversing mountains and rivers, sharing in the people’s affairs, and think these enough to weary their spirit. How could they know that the most perfect remains unharmed?\n\nNow, to speak of one of royal virtue and lodge them on this mountain is to show that the world has no way to recognize them. Thus, they are placed beyond the farthest reaches, beyond the bounds of sight and hearing. The maiden does not let the outer harm the inner. They eat no grains, drinking the wind and dew. Though all eat grains, the spirit-person alone is so—this makes clear that the spirit-person is not formed by grains but is endowed with the wondrous qi of nature. They ride the clouds, mount flying dragons, and wander beyond the four seas. Their spirit is concentrated, so that things suffer no blight and the harvests ripen. Yet I deem this mad and do not believe it!\"*",
      "overlap_context": "ce arises from non-governance; action emerges from non-action. Taking from Yao is sufficient—why borrow from Xu You? If one claims that only by folding one’s arms in the mountains and forests can one be called non-active, this is why the teachings of Zhuangzi and Laozi are rejected by those in power. Those in power necessarily dwell in the realm of action and do not return—this is the reason. Yet if I were to replace you, would I do so for the sake of a name? A name is but the guest of reality.\"",

      "translated_text": "One whose body embodies spirit and dwells in the numinous, who exhausts principle and reaches the subtlest mysteries—though they sit in stillness within the quiet hall, their mystery pervades beyond the four seas. Thus, they ride the Two Modes and harness the Six Abandonments, moving among the multitudes yet driving the ten thousand things. If nothing is not compliant, then floating clouds become their mount; if no form is not borne, then flying dragons become their steed. They cast off the self and attain spontaneity, though seemingly indifferent, they need nothing. Sitting in forgetfulness, moving in forgetfulness, forgetting even the act of forgetting—thus their movement is like dragging withered wood, their stillness like a heap of dead ashes. This is what is meant by their spirit being concentrated. When their spirit is concentrated, what is not concentrated attains spontaneity.\n\nThe world judges by what it sees and draws conclusions—how could it ever believe this?\n\nLián Shū said: \"Indeed. The blind cannot partake in the spectacle of patterns, the deaf cannot partake in the sound of bells and drums. Is it only the body that suffers blindness and deafness? Knowledge, too, has its own. To fail to reach the ultimate subtlety of perfect speech and dismiss it as madness unworthy of belief—this is the deafness and blindness of knowledge. Such words are but the prattle of a child. To say that what Jiē Yú spoke of is naturally sought by things, and that those who are deaf and blind to knowledge deny its possibility—this man, this power, would rather merge with the ten thousand things as one, seeking to bring order to a disordered world. Who would wear themselves out taking the world as their concern?\n\nThe heart of the sage reaches the ultimate convergence of the Two Modes and exhausts the subtle numbers of the ten thousand things. Thus, they embody transformation and harmonize with change. There is nowhere they cannot go, pervading the ten thousand things so that nothing is not so. The world, in its chaos, seeks me, but I have no mind. If I have no mind, why should I not respond to the world? Yet one who embodies the mysterious and exhausts the subtlest—it is by not acting that they harmonize with the natures of the ten thousand things, shaping the transformations of the world, and so attain the fame of Yáo and Shùn. Who would wear themselves out with toil and anxious thought, taking affairs as their affair, and only then succeed?\n\nThis person, no thing harms them. To be at ease with what harms is to render harm powerless; when harm is powerless, things do not harm them. Great floods may rise to the heavens without drowning them; great droughts may melt metal and stone, scorch earth and mountains without heating them. Wherever they go, they are at ease—every place is fitting. Life and death bring no change to them, much less drowning or scorching! Thus, the perfected person is not entangled by calamity and disaster—not by avoiding it, but by following principle straightforwardly, naturally meeting with fortune. Their dust and chaff, the dregs they discard, are what would mold Yáo and Shùn. Who would take things as their concern?\n\nYáo and Shùn are but names for worldly affairs; those who act for names are not true names. Thus, Yáo and Shùn—were they merely Yáo and Shùn? They must have possessed the reality of the spirit-person. What the world calls Yáo and Shùn is merely the dust and chaff of their names. The people of Sòng carried ceremonial caps to Yuè, but the Yuè people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. Yáo governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm, yet when he went to see the Four Masters on the distant slopes of Miǎo Gū Shé Mountain, north of the Fén River, he was suddenly bereft of his world. Yáo’s uselessness to the world was like the Yuè people’s uselessness to the ceremonial cap. Yet one who abandons the world is truly revered by the world. Though the world revered Yáo, Yáo never possessed the world. Thus, he was suddenly bereft of it, his mind wandering in the farthest reaches of the obscure. Though he sat as if enthroned above the ten thousand things, he had never ceased to be carefree.\n\nThe Four Masters are but a lodging for words, to show that Yáo was not confined to being Yáo. In reality, Yáo was obscure; his traces were but Yáo. To view the obscure from the traces is to see inner and outer as separate realms—no wonder it seems strange! The world sees only Yáo as Yáo—how could it recognize his obscurity?\"\n\nHuìzǐ said to Zhuāngzǐ: \"The King of Wèi gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to hold five *dàn*. When I used it to hold water, its strength could not support itself. When I split it to make a ladle, its size was too vast to hold anything. It was not that it wasn’t resoundingly large—I smashed it because it was useless.\"\n\nZhuāngzǐ said: \"You are truly inept at using what is great. There was a man of Sòng skilled in making a salve that prevented chapped hands. For generations, his family made their living by washing silk floss. A traveler heard of it and offered a hundred gold pieces for the formula. The family gathered and deliberated: 'For generations, we’ve washed silk floss and earned only a few coins. Now, in one morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred gold pieces—let’s give it to him.' The traveler obtained it and persuaded the King of Wú. When Yuè raised a rebellion, the King of Wú sent him as a general. In winter, he fought a naval battle with the Yuè and crushed them, gaining land and a fief. The ability to prevent chapped hands was the same, yet one used it to gain a fief, while another could not escape washing silk floss—the difference lay in how it was used. Now you have a gourd of five *dàn*—why not consider making a great float and drifting upon rivers and lakes, instead of worrying that its size is too vast to hold anything? You still have the heart of a clump of mugwort!\"\n\nMugwort is not the path of one who is truly penetrating. This passage speaks of how things each have their proper use. If one finds their proper use, where could one not be carefree?\n\nHuìzǐ said to Zhuāngzǐ: \"I have a great tree—people call it the *chū*. Its great trunk is swollen and gnarled, not fitting the inked line; its small branches are twisted, not fitting the compass or square. It stands by the road, but carpenters do not glance at it. Now your words are vast but useless—just what everyone rejects.\"\n\nZhuāngzǐ said: \"Have you never seen a wildcat or weasel? They crouch low to lie in wait, pouncing on their prey. They leap east and west, not avoiding high or low...\"",

      "translated_text": "They are caught in traps and snares and die in nets. Now consider the yak: its size is like clouds trailing across the sky. This creature is great indeed, yet it cannot catch mice. You have a great tree and fret that it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothing Whatever, the vast and boundless wilds? Wander idly at its side, roam carefree beneath its shade. No axe will fell it prematurely, no thing will harm it. Useless? Where then could it be troubled?\"\n\nFor things great and small, if they miss their proper measure, the principle of benefit and harm is the same. When each finds its proper use, all things are carefree.\n\n---\n\nIn *The Inner Chapters: \"On the Equality of Things,\"* Master Nanguo Ziqi sat leaning against his armrest, gazing at the sky and exhaling deeply, his response seeming as if he had lost his counterpart. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, \"What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the heart like dead ashes? Yet the one who leans on the armrest today is not the same as the one who leaned on it before?\"\n\nAll things deem themselves right and others wrong, praise themselves and despise others—none are exempt. However, though right and wrong differ, self and other are equal. When heaven and humanity are united, self and other are equal, then externally there is nothing with which to rejoice, and in response, the body dissolves as if it has lost its match. Dead ashes and withered wood are valued for their stillness and lack of emotion. Those who follow their natural course and forget right and wrong embody only their innate nature—what else could there be? Thus, when still, they stand like a withered tree; when moving, they sway like a dry branch. Sitting, they are like dead ashes; walking, like drifting dust. The forms of movement and stillness are not what I can unify; their state of effortless self-possession is not what I can duplicate.\n\nZiyou had seen those who leaned on armrests before, but none like Ziqi. \"I have lost my 'I,'\" he said, \"and in forgetting myself, what in the world is there left to recognize?\" Only by forgetting both inner and outer can one transcend and attain all.\n\nZiqi said, \"Yan, how excellent that you ask! Just now, I lost my 'I'—did you realize it? You have heard the *human pipes* but not the *earth pipes*; you have heard the *earth pipes* but not the *heavenly pipes*!\"\n\n*Pipes* refers to flutes. Flutes vary in length, their notes differing in pitch, producing myriad sounds—some short, some long, some high, some low. Though the sounds are myriad, the measure they receive is one; thus, there is no place to interpose judgments of superiority or inferiority. How much more so with the winds and things of the world: different sounds share the same nature, each taking its own course, and so the *pipes of heaven and earth* are revealed.\n\nZiyou said, \"May I ask the method?\"\n\nZiqi replied, \"The great clod breathes forth *qi*, and its name is wind. It does nothing, yet when it arises, the myriad hollows roar in anger. Have you alone not heard its long sighs? The *great clod* is nothingness itself. As for the breathing forth of *qi*, how could there be a thing that does it? The *qi* simply breathes forth of itself. When things are born, none fail to arise of themselves—thus the body of this self-arising is vast, and so it is named the *great clod*.\n\nThe towering forests and jagged cliffs, the great trees with hollows as wide as a man’s embrace—some resemble noses, some mouths, some ears, some pegs, some rings, some mortars, some depressions, some pools. Some hiss, some whistle, some scold, some inhale, some cry, some wail, some moan, some shriek. Those ahead sing *yu*, and those behind sing *yong*. A gentle breeze elicits a small harmony; a whirlwind, a great one. When a fierce gale subsides, all hollows fall silent. Have you alone not seen them swaying—*tiaotiao*, *diaodiao*?\"\n\nThe wind does nothing, yet when it arises, the myriad hollows all rage and produce sound. The long sighs are the sounds of a great wind. The stirring of a mighty wind. Here, the various hollows are briefly likened to different things. Here, the diverse sounds of the myriad hollows are briefly enumerated. Though the notes of the sounds vary endlessly—singing and responding, great and small—none fail to match what they receive and each fits its place. *Subsides* means ceases. When a fierce wind blows, the hollows are full; when it ceases, they are empty. Though full and empty differ, in each attaining its proper state, they are the same. *Tiaotiao* and *diaodiao* describe the swaying of things. Though the sounds differ, so too do the movements of their forms. Yet though their movements differ, in attaining equality, they are one—how could *tiaotiao* alone be right and *diaodiao* alone be wrong?\n\nZiyou said, \"The *earth pipes* are simply the myriad hollows; the *human pipes* are the various bamboo flutes. May I ask about the *heavenly pipes*?\"\n\nZiqi said, \"The *heavenly pipes* blow through the myriad differences, yet each follows its own course. All take what is their own—who is it that stirs them to anger?\"\n\nThese are the *heavenly pipes*. For the *heavenly pipes*, is there yet another thing apart? They are simply the hollows, bamboo flutes, and all that joins with living things, converging to form a single heaven. That which is *wu* (nothing) cannot generate *you* (being); that which is *you* before it is born cannot be the source of life.\"",

      "translated_text": "Then who is it that gives life to life? It arises of itself, a clod that lives by itself. It lives by itself—it is not I who give it life. Since I cannot give life to things, and things cannot give life to me, then I am self-so. Being self-so, it is called \"heavenly-so.\" Heavenly-so is not made; thus it is spoken of as \"heaven.\" Speaking of it as \"heaven\" clarifies its self-so nature—how could it mean the azure vault? Yet some say the *heavenly pipes* compel things to follow them. But heaven itself cannot possess itself—how could it possess things? Thus \"heaven\" is simply the collective name for the myriad things. None is uniquely heaven—who then masters and compels things? Therefore, things each live of themselves, with no source from which they emerge—this is the Dao of heaven. All things attain themselves—who stirs them to anger, making them so? This further clarifies the *heavenly pipes*.\n\nThe great knowledge is leisurely, the small knowledge is leisurely. The great words blaze, the small words chatter. In sleep, their spirits intermingle; in waking, their forms open. They engage and contend, daily waging war in their hearts. Some are vague, some are guarded, some are secretive. Small fears make them tremble; great fears make them numb. Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow—this is what it means to judge right and wrong. Their restraint is like a sworn oath—this is what it means to cling to victory. Their decline is like autumn and winter, speaking of their daily decay. What they drown in cannot be restored. Their weariness is like a sealed letter, speaking of their aging and stagnation. The heart near death cannot be revived. Joy and anger, sorrow and delight, worry and sighing, change and fear, frivolity and ease, seduction and posturing—pleasure emerges from emptiness, steam gives rise to mushrooms. Day and night they alternate before us, yet none knows where they sprout. Enough, enough! Morning and evening we attain this—is this not how we come to be? This is the difference in knowledge. This is the difference in speech. This is the difference between waking and sleeping. This is the difference in interaction. This is the difference in fear and trembling. This is the difference in movement and stillness. Their decay and daily decay are like this. Their drowning and irreversible course are like this. Their weariness, sunk in desire, aging and growing ever more stagnant, are like this. Their pursuit of profit, fear of harm, secret scheming to achieve their aims, are like this. These are the differences in nature and disposition. These are the differences in events and changes.\n\nFrom this point onward, we briefly enumerate the boundlessness of the *heavenly pipes*; from this point downward, we clarify the self-so nature of boundlessness. Things each are self-so, not knowing why they are so yet being so—thus though their forms differ endlessly, their *so-ness* is endlessly the same. Day and night alternate, the old giving way to the new. Heaven and earth, the myriad things, transform and daily renew, advancing with time—what gives rise to them? They are simply self-so. This speaks of their self-generation. Without that, there is no \"I\"; without \"I,\" there is nothing to take. This is close, yet one does not know what makes it so. As if there were a true master, yet no trace of it can be found. It can be acted upon and trusted, yet its form is unseen—it has essence but no form. That is self-so. Self-so gives birth to me; I give birth to self-so. Thus self-so is simply my own self-so—how could it be distant? All things, in their multiplicity, are simply thus of themselves, not made to be so by one another. Therefore, leaving them to themselves, principle arrives of itself.\n\nThe myriad things, the myriad dispositions, differ in their inclinations and aversions—it is as if there were a true master making them so. Yet when one seeks the traces of this true master, one never finds them. Thus it is clear that all things are self-so, with nothing making them so. Now consider a traveler: he trusts that he can walk, yet does not see the form that enables him to walk. His disposition matches the thing, so the form is not separately visible. The face, the nine orifices, the six viscera—all are complete and present. With whom should I be intimate? Do you delight in all of them? Or do you have favorites? Are they all like servants and concubines? Are servants and concubines insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns being lord and subject? Or is there a true lord present? Whether one seeks and attains its essence or not, it neither adds to nor detracts from its truth. Entrust it to self-so, and all things are preserved. They simply exist of themselves. If one delighted in all, that would imply partiality. With partiality, one cannot preserve all things completely. Thus they exist without delight, live without being made. If one were partial to all, ambition would exceed one’s proper role, superiors and inferiors would encroach upon one another, and none would be servants or concubines. If those with the talents of servants and concubines do not accept the tasks of servants and concubines, they are lost.\n\nThus the principle of lord and subject, superior and inferior, inner and outer, hands and feet, is the natural pattern of heaven—how could it be the doing of a true person? Servants and concubines simply each fulfill their proper role—this is not insufficient for mutual governance. Mutual governance is like hands, feet, ears, and eyes, the four limbs and hundred parts, each with its office and all mutually serving one another. Those whom the times deem worthy become lords; those whose talents do not match the age become subjects. Like heaven’s natural height and earth’s natural lowness, the head’s natural position above and the feet’s natural position below—is there any alternation? Though there is no error in their proper places, they are necessarily proper of themselves. Leaving them to themselves, they are thus of themselves—this is not artificial.\n\nAll who attain their true nature and employ their self-so nature, though they be mere servants, still do not heed slander or praise but rest content in their work. Thus whether one knows or does not know, all are self-so. But if one opens the path of vain hopes, with inferiors encroaching upon superiors, things lose their truth, people forget their roots—then between slander and praise, one’s bearing is lost and confused. Once one receives this completed form, one does not perish until its end. Locked in mutual struggle and wear, one’s actions rush forward like a gallop, yet nothing can stop them—is this not lamentable? Toiling one’s whole life without seeing success, wearily exhausted yet not knowing where one is headed—how can this not be sorrowful?",

They are simply the hollows, bamboo flutes, and all that joins with living things, converging to form a single heaven.

      "translated_text": "If people call this \"not dying,\" what benefit is there? The form dissolves, and the heart follows it—can this not be called great sorrow? Is human life inherently so deluded? Am I alone deluded, or are there others who are not?\n\nEach nature has its allotted portion, so the wise guard their knowledge to the end, while the foolish cling to their ignorance until death—who can alter their nature midway? The myriad beings swirl in confusion, clashing in opposition and accord, each trusting their own biases and indulging their impulses, none able to turn back. This—what the common people deem sorrowful—is indeed sorrowful. Yet the common people never regard it as sorrowful, for it is the nature of their nature. Since all things are so by nature, what is there to lament?\n\nHuman desires know no bounds, and those who know contentment are few. Thus, having attained this, they do not stop but pursue that instead. All toil their entire lives, never sating their ambitions, ceasing only in death. Therefore, their success is never seen. All things wear out their bodies in pursuit of what they love, until they are exhausted and spent. Yet they do not know where this love leads! In truth, it is no different from death. When heart and form race together, weary yet unable to turn back, this is a sorrow greater than what common people grieve. But since common people never grieve over this, what they grieve is not worth grieving.\n\nAll the matters above occur without knowing why they occur—hence, they are deluded. Those who do not know do not know how they know, yet they know of themselves. The living do not know how they live, yet they live of themselves. Though the myriad things differ, in that their living does not arise from knowing, there is no difference—thus, none in the world are not deluded.\n\nIf one follows the completed heart and takes it as one’s teacher, who is without a teacher? Why must there be those who know the alternation and yet choose for themselves? Even the foolish do so! To have right and wrong before the heart is complete is like arriving in Yue today when you set out yesterday. Thus, to take what is not as what is—even the divine Yu could not comprehend it, so how can I?\n\nThe heart sufficient to govern the body’s use is called the \"completed heart.\" If one takes one’s completed heart as one’s teacher, then each person has their own teacher. Each person having their own teacher, they entrust themselves to it and it fits. To use the completed to replace the incomplete is not knowledge—it is the heart’s self-attainment. Thus, even the foolish take their completed heart as their teacher, unwilling to employ what they deem short and abandon what they deem long.\n\nIf you arrive in Yue today, how could you have arrived yesterday? Before the heart is complete, how could right and wrong arise? Those who clarify right and wrong cannot be without them, so the perfected person follows both. In principle, there is no right or wrong, yet the deluded take it as existing—this is taking what is not as what is. Once the deluded heart is formed, even sages cannot dispel it, so one entrusts it to its natural state without forcing knowledge.\n\nWords are not the wind’s blowing; speakers have something to say. Yet what they say is not yet settled. Is there truly speech? Or has there never been speech? Do they differ from the chirping of fledglings, or is there distinction? Or is there no distinction? Each has something to say, so they differ from the wind. I deem this right, and they deem it wrong; what they deem right, I deem wrong—so it is not settled. Not settled because of the bias of their perspectives.\n\nDo we take it as speech? Yet it is insufficient to settle anything. Do we take it as no speech? But one already speaks from one’s own position. Speech and the chirping of fledglings reach the same end—whether there is distinction or not is truly unsettled. The world’s sentiments need not be the same, yet their words cannot differ, so right and wrong swirl in confusion, with no way to settle them.\n\nWhere does the Dao hide to have truth and falsity? Where do words hide to have right and wrong? Where does the Dao go and not remain? Where do words remain and yet cannot? The Dao is hidden in petty achievements, words are hidden in florid embellishment. Thus arise the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other negates and negating what the other affirms. To affirm what they negate and negate what they affirm, nothing is better than illumination.\n\nThe Dao is nowhere absent! Why is it hidden to have truth and falsity, and why do the names of right and wrong arise in profusion? All remain. All are permissible. Petty achievements and florid embellishment naturally obscure the Dao, yet the Dao cannot be obscured. Thus, truth and falsity, right and wrong, operate in florid embellishment and cease in proper alignment, appear in petty achievements and vanish in great wholeness.\n\nConfucians and Mohists mutually affirm and negate, yet all in the world are Confucians and Mohists. Thus, the hundred schools arise, each prizing their own views, never stepping beyond their bounds. Those who have right and wrong are what the Confucians and Mohists affirm; those who have no right and no wrong are what they negate. Now, to affirm what the Confucians and Mohists negate and negate what they affirm is to illuminate the absence of right and wrong. To illuminate the absence of right and wrong, nothing is better than using the Confucians and Mohists to mutually clarify each other. Mutually clarifying each other, what they affirm is not right, and what they negate is not wrong. Not wrong, then there is no wrong; not right, then there is no right.\n\nNothing is not \"that,\" nothing is not \"this.\" From \"that,\" one does not see; from self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also depends on that.\" This is the theory of \"that\" and \"this\" arising together. Yet even as they arise, they die; even as they die, they arise. Even as they are permissible, they are not; even as they are not, they are permissible. Following right, following wrong; following wrong, following right. Therefore, the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates it by the heavens—this too is following \"this.\" All things deem themselves right, so nothing is not right.",

      "translated_text": "All things deem each other \"that,\" thus nothing is not \"that.\" Nothing is not \"that,\" then under heaven there is no \"this\"; nothing is not \"this,\" then under heaven there is no \"that.\" Without \"that\" and without \"this,\" this is the profound unity.\n\nThe partiality of things lies in that none see what the other sees, but only know what they themselves know. Knowing what they themselves know, they deem themselves right. Deeming themselves right, they regard the other as wrong. Thus it is said: \"That emerges from this, and this also depends on that\"—\"that\" and \"this\" arise through mutual dependence.\n\nThe changes of life and death are like the progression of the four seasons—spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Though the states of life and death differ, in each finding peace in what they encounter, they are one. Now, the living deem life as life, while the dead deem life as death—thus there is no life. The living deem death as death, while the dead deem death as life—thus there is no death. Without life and without death, without right and without wrong, the debates of Confucians and Mohists are what I cannot align with; yet when each obscures their own distinctions, these are what I cannot oppose.\n\nThe one who embraces openness follows the right and wrong of the world yet remains without right or wrong. Thus, not proceeding by the path of right and wrong yet ensuring no harm from right or wrong is simply to illuminate their natural state without deviation. This is also \"that,\" and \"that\" is also \"this.\" \"That\" has its own right and wrong, and \"this\" has its own right and wrong—is there truly a \"that\" and \"this\"? Or is there truly no \"that\" and \"this\"? Where \"that\" and \"this\" find no counterpart, this is called the *pivot of the Dao*. When the pivot is found at the center of the ring, it responds to the infinite. \"This\" is one infinity, and \"not-this\" is another infinity. Thus it is said: nothing compares to illumination.\n\nI, too, am deemed \"that\" by \"that.\" \"That,\" too, deems itself right. \"This\" deems itself right and \"that\" wrong; \"that\" deems itself right and \"this\" wrong—each contains within itself one right and one wrong. Now, if one wishes to call \"that\" \"that,\" yet \"that\" still deems itself right; if one wishes to call \"this\" \"this,\" yet \"this\" is still deemed \"that\" by \"that.\" Thus, the presence or absence of \"that\" and \"this\" remains undetermined.\n\nA *counterpart* is an opposition. \"That\" and \"this\" oppose each other, yet the sage harmonizes both. Thus, the one without intent merges with things and has never set up oppositions under heaven. The *pivot* is the essential point. Abiding in this essential point and meeting the profound extremity, one responds to the boundless. Right and wrong alternate endlessly, following one another without cease—thus they are called a *ring*. The center of the ring is empty; now, if one takes right and wrong as the ring and attains its center, there is no right and no wrong. Without right and without wrong, one can respond to right and wrong. Since right and wrong are infinite, the response is also infinite.\n\nUnder heaven, none do not deem themselves right and none do not deem others wrong. Thus, one right and one wrong proceed endlessly. Only the one who traverses emptiness and attains the center, vast and without attachment, rides upon it in wandering. To use a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger; to use a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nFor one to deem oneself right and others wrong is the common sentiment of \"that\" and \"this.\" Thus, if I use my finger to illustrate \"that\" finger, then \"that\" finger alone becomes a non-finger to my finger—this is using a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. If, in turn, \"that\" finger is used to illustrate my finger, then my finger becomes a non-finger to \"that\" finger—this is using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To clarify the absence of right and wrong, nothing compares to reciprocal illustration. Through reciprocal illustration, \"that\" and \"I\" are alike in deeming ourselves right and equal in deeming each other wrong. Equal in deeming each other wrong, then under heaven there is no right; alike in deeming ourselves right, then under heaven there is no wrong.\n\nHow can this be made clear? If \"this\" were truly right, then under heaven there would be no one to deem it wrong. If \"not-this\" were truly wrong, then under heaven there would also be no one to deem it right. Now, with right and wrong lacking a master, they are confused and chaotic—it is clear that these petty distinctions merely reflect each one’s biased views converging in uniformity. Looking up and looking down, none are not thus. Therefore, the perfected person knows that heaven and earth are one finger and the myriad things are one horse. Thus, vast and greatly at peace, heaven and earth and the myriad things each rest in their proper place, united in self-contentment, without right and without wrong.\n\nIs it permissible? Is it not permissible? What is permissible to oneself is called permissible; what is not permissible to oneself is called not permissible. The Dao is completed through its practice; things are deemed so through their naming. There is that by which it is permissible, that by which it is not permissible, that by which it is so, and that by which it is not so. How is it so? It is so in being so. How is it not so? It is not so in not being so. How is it permissible? It is permissible in being permissible. How is it not permissible? It is not permissible in not being permissible.\n\nThings inherently have that by which they are so; things inherently have that by which they are permissible. There is nothing that is not so; there is nothing that is not permissible. Thus, take a stalk and a pillar, an ugly woman and Xi Shi, the expansive, the strange, the deceitful, and the bizarre—all are united as one. In their division, they are completed; in their completion, they are destroyed. All things are without completion and destruction, united as one. There is nothing that is not completed; there is nothing that is not so. Each is so in its own way; each is permissible in its own way.\n\nA stalk lies horizontally while a pillar stands vertically; an ugly woman is repulsive while Xi Shi is beautiful. What is meant by \"equalizing\"? Surely it is not to equalize forms or unify standards! Thus, take the vertical and horizontal, the beautiful and ugly, the expansive and bizarre—each is so in its own way, each is permissible in its own way. Though principles may differ in ten thousand ways, their nature is equally attained. Thus it is said: the Dao unites as one.",
      "overlap_context": " \"That emerges from this, and this also depends on that.\" This is the theory of \"that\" and \"this\" arising together. Yet even as they arise, they die; even as they die, they arise. Even as they are permissible, they are not; even as they are not, they are permissible. Following right, following wrong; following wrong, following right. Therefore, the sage does not proceed thus but illuminates it by the heavens—this too is following \"this.\" All things deem themselves right, so nothing is not right.",

      "translated_text": "Things may be deemed dissolution by one and completion by another. What I call completion, another may call destruction. Completion and destruction arise from self-regard, blind to the other. Thus, there is no completion or destruction, just as there is no right or wrong. Only the enlightened know that all is united as one, and though they do not employ this knowledge, they lodge it in the ordinary. Following what is so, they rest in it without knowing why—this is called the Dao.\n\nThe enlightened are not confined to one perspective; suddenly, they forget themselves and entrust themselves to spontaneous use. In spontaneous use, all things flow smoothly and find their own fulfillment. \"Few\" means \"exhaustion.\" The ultimate principle is exhausted in self-fulfillment. The enlightened follow without contrivance. Do they know that following is good and thus follow? They do not know why they follow—they simply follow, and so it is called the Dao.\n\nTo strain the mind in pursuit of unity while failing to recognize its sameness is called \"morning threes.\" What is \"morning threes\"? The monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" All the monkeys were enraged. He then said, \"Very well, four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased. The names and realities remained unchanged, yet joy and anger were put to use—this, too, is following what is so. Therefore, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the celestial balance—this is called \"walking two paths.\"\n\nDoes the enlightened one strain the mind to achieve unity? If one labors the mind to force unity, it is unreliable and no different from those who fail to achieve it. They are as deluded as the monkeys, clinging to what they prefer and deeming themselves right. Without partiality, one entrusts all to spontaneous equilibrium and leaves it at that. Entrusting the world’s right and wrong—\n\nThe ancients’ knowledge reached its limit. Where did it reach? Some held that things had never yet begun to exist—this is the utmost, the exhaustion, beyond which nothing can be added! Next were those who held that things existed but had never yet been bounded. Next were those who held that boundaries existed but right and wrong had never yet arisen. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminishment of the Dao; the diminishment of the Dao is the formation of attachment. Is there truly completion and diminishment? Is there truly no completion and diminishment? With completion and diminishment, there is Zhao’s zither-playing; without completion and diminishment, there is Zhao’s not playing the zither. Zhao Wen’s zither-playing, Shi Kuang’s wielding the baton, and Hui Shi’s leaning on the catalpa—these three were nearly at the height of wisdom, and so their deeds are recorded at life’s end.\n\nYet their attachment to their pursuits set them apart from others. Their attachment sought to illuminate them, but what they sought to illuminate was not meant to be illuminated—thus they ended in the obscurity of \"hard and white.\" And Zhao Wen’s son ended his life weaving the threads of his father’s art, achieving nothing. If this can be called achievement, then though I have achieved nothing, I too may be said to have achieved. If this cannot be called achievement, then neither things nor I have achieved anything.\n\nThus, the dazzling confusion of doubt is what the sage contemplates. Not employing this knowledge but lodging it in the ordinary—this is called \"illuminating through obscurity.\" This is to forget heaven and earth, to leave the myriad things behind, to look outward without examining the cosmos, to look inward without perceiving one’s own body. Thus, one is vast and unburdened, moving with things and responding to all without hindrance.\n\nThough one may not yet have forgotten all, one can still forget self and other. Though one may not yet have forgotten self and other, one can still forget their right and wrong. Without the Dao’s diminishment, emotions become partial and attachment takes form. Failing to forget attachment and relinquish self-interest, one cannot achieve mystical unity with self and other.

      "translated_text": "The myriad sounds cannot all be enumerated. Thus, when one blows pipes or plucks strings, though the fingers may move intricately, many sounds are still lost. Those who grasp the flute or strike the zither seek to manifest sound, yet in manifesting sound, sound is lost; in not manifesting sound, sound remains whole. Thus, to seek completion and thereby diminish it—this is how Zhaowen plays the zither. Not to seek completion and thus remain undiminished—this is how Zhaowen does not play the zither. \"Nearly\" means \"exhaustively.\" These three masters all sought to clarify what they themselves did not understand, thus exhausting their knowledge and depleting their thoughts, their bodies wearied and their spirits fatigued. Some leaned on their staffs and dozed, others rested against a catalpa tree and closed their eyes. They relied on their vigor to endure, for without it, they would have succumbed long ago.\n\nThese three masters each cherished only what they themselves understood, believing themselves distinct from the common crowd. They sought to display their understanding to others, desiring that all should share their preferences. This is like playing the reed organ to an ox. Since others ultimately do not understand, their own arts and methods end in obscurity. Zhaowen’s son, in turn, carried on his father’s legacy, yet in the end achieved nothing. Though these three sought to enlighten others, those others ultimately did not understand, and so they accomplished nothing in their lifetimes. If these three can be called accomplished, then even my own lack of accomplishment could be called accomplishment. All things illuminate themselves yet do not illuminate others. If, because others are not illuminated, one deems them unaccomplished, then all things would be without accomplishment.\n\nThus, the sage does not display this to dazzle that, nor abandons the self to pursue things. Following along, they allow each to fulfill its capacity, and so all things achieve completion without omission. Now, these three masters sought to display their own preferences to others—is this not delusion? The sage is without self. Thus, when faced with the dazzling confusion of doubt, they chart and delimit it; when confronted with vast deception and strangeness, they unify and harmonize it. They allow the myriad differences to rest in what they find restful, so that the multitude do not lose what they deem right. Thus, the sage is not employed by things, and the use of all things is fulfilled. When all things employ themselves, who is right and who is wrong? Therefore, even in the face of unbridled transformations and strange deviations, bending to follow them and entrusting them to their own use, though their uses may differ in ten thousand ways, all remains clearly self-evident.\n\nNow, suppose I were to speak here—how would I know if it is of the same kind as this? Or not of the same kind? Whether of the same kind or not, all are of the same kind when taken together, and thus no different from that. Nevertheless, let me attempt to speak: There is a beginning; there is that which precedes the beginning; there is that which precedes what precedes the beginning. There is being; there is non-being; there is that which precedes non-being; there is that which precedes what precedes non-being. Suddenly, there is being and non-being, yet one does not know which of the two—being or non-being—is truly so. Now, I have already spoken, yet I do not know if what I have called \"spoken\" is truly spoken or truly unspoken.\n\nIf I say there is no right or wrong, how would I know if this is of the same kind as those who speak of right and wrong or not? If I wish to call it the same kind, then I take non-being as right, while they take non-being as wrong—thus, it is not the same kind. Yet though this right and wrong differ, they are still not free from right and wrong, and so are of the same kind as that. Therefore, whether of the same kind or not, all are of the same kind when taken together, and thus no different from that. If one wishes to avoid such great dissimilarity, nothing is better than having no mind. Having dispelled right and wrong, one must then dispel the act of dispelling. Dispelling the dispelling again and again until there is no dispelling left—only then will there be no dispelling and nothing not dispelled, and right and wrong will depart of themselves. The ultimate principle is without words; to speak is to fall into classification. Thus, I tentatively entrust these words to this purpose.\n\nIf there is a beginning, there is an end. To speak of no end or beginning and to equate life and death—those who unify them do not compare to those who do not unify them and yet find them equal of themselves. This is to forget their unity. If there is being, beauty and ugliness, right and wrong are all present. If there is non-being yet one does not know that there is no non-being, then right and wrong, love and hate still linger in the heart. Even knowing there is no non-being, one may still not be without knowledge. To forget all knowledge entirely—only then does one suddenly begin to comprehend nothingness. In comprehending nothingness, heaven and earth, the myriad things, self and other, right and wrong—all become clearly and firmly so.\n\nTo say there is no right or wrong is still to make a statement. Not knowing whether this statement is being or non-being, one then becomes utterly free of the slightest speck of dust in the heart. Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; nothing lives longer than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu is short-lived. Heaven and earth are born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, can there be speech? Since we have already called it one, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. Proceeding from this, even the most skilled mathematician cannot arrive at a number, much less an ordinary person! Therefore, to go from non-being to being, reaching three—how much more so to go from being to being! Do not proceed thus; follow what is already so!\n\nIf one opposes things by form, then Mount Tai is greater than the tip of an autumn hair. But if each abides by its own nature and things reach their ultimate, then great form is not in excess, and small form is not insufficient. If each is sufficient in its nature, then the tip of an autumn hair is not merely small in its smallness, nor is Mount Tai merely great in its greatness. If sufficiency in nature is deemed greatness, then nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair. If sufficiency in nature is not deemed greatness, then even Mount Tai can be called small. Thus, it is said: Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small. If Mount Tai is small, then nothing in the world is great; if the tip of an autumn hair is great, then nothing in the world is small. Without small or great, without long life or early death, the cicada does not envy the great *chun* tree and rejoices in its own contentment; the marsh pheasant does not prize the celestial pond and finds glory in its own sufficiency.",

      "translated_text": "If one is content with Heaven’s natural endowment and at peace with one’s nature and destiny, then even heaven and earth are not long-lived enough to outlast me, for they arise together with me; the myriad things are not distinct enough to differ from me, for they attain together with me. If heaven and earth arise together with me, why should they not be as one? If the myriad things attain together with me, why should they not be identical? The myriad things in their myriad forms all find sufficiency in themselves, and their sufficiency is one. Once one has attained this oneness, there is no principle left to articulate.\n\nNames and terms arise from a lack of clarity. Some things cannot clarify their own oneness and thus pursue others through comparison, so they coin a term to correct them. Once they have named this \"oneness,\" they have already introduced speech. Yet to speak of oneness with words is to divide it, for oneness is not speech; thus, oneness and speech become two. Oneness is one, yet speech divides it again. With one and two, can we not call it three? To express oneness with a single word still yields three—how much more so when tracing its tributaries, where every thing has its own name? Even with skilled calculation, none can enumerate them.\n\nThus, those who name oneness do not differ from others, while those who forget oneness attain it without speech. Each abides by what it can do—this is the truest way. The Dao has never had boundaries, nor has speech ever had constancy; yet for the sake of this, distinctions arise. Let me speak of these distinctions: there is left and right, hierarchy and duty, division and debate, competition and contention—these are called the eight virtues.\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage acknowledges but does not discourse; within the six directions, the sage discourses but does not debate; regarding the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and the aspirations of former kings, the sage debates but does not contend. Thus, division implies what is undivided; debate implies what is undebated.\n\nOne may ask: \"Why is this?\" The sage embraces it, while the multitude debates to display themselves. Thus, it is said: debate arises from what is unseen. In profound obscurity, nothing is absent. When \"this\" and \"that\" are spoken, right and wrong have no fixed ground. The Dao is unbounded, so the myriad things freely occupy their allotted domains, each differing in what suits them. Every thing has its principle, every affair its fittingness. They are grouped by kind and distinguished by category. Pursuing side by side is called competition; opposing debate is called contention. Briefly distinguishing them, we have these eight virtues.\n\nWhat lies beyond the six directions refers to what is outside the inherent nature of things. Though principle exists even there, since it lies beyond the bounds of inherent nature, it does not move the sage, who therefore does not discourse on it. To discourse on it would be to lead the myriad things to learn what they cannot. Thus, the sage does not discuss what lies beyond, and the eight distinctions dissolve into self-sufficiency. One presents one’s nature and rests in it, following its completed traces to congeal at the ultimate of rightness, without clinging to one’s own rightness to condemn others.\n\nEach thing divides itself; each affair distinguishes itself. To desire to impose one’s own divisions is to fail to see their self-distinction. The sage harbors no such intent. Not seeing their self-debate, he debates what he knows to show them.\n\nThe great Dao is not named; great debate does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage does not harm. When the Dao is made manifest, it is no longer the Dao; when speech is eloquent, it falls short; when benevolence is constant, it is not all-encompassing; when integrity is pure, it is not trustworthy; when courage is harmful, it fails. These five, though incomplete, nearly approach the proper direction.\n\nEntrusting things to their own names, there is nothing to name. They distinguish themselves. Existing without attachment, they endure on their own. The utterly sufficient one is not affected by things’ comings and goings, so there is no place for modesty or fullness. Without obstruction, one can go anywhere without peril. To use this to illuminate that is to lose both. One cannot reach the self-division of things.\n\nThings have no constant attachment, and constant attachment is never all-encompassing. Brightly pure integrity is merely the greed of the fame-seeker, not true integrity. Harmful, contrary courage is detested by all under heaven, leaving no ground to stand. These five all injure what is fitting by acting, unable to rest in their original nature and endlessly seeking what lies outside. Seeking what cannot be sought is like trying to learn the square from the round or a fish longing to be a bird. Though one may aspire to phoenixes and emulate the sun and moon, the closer one draws to them, the farther one strays from reality. The more one learns, the more one loses one’s nature. Thus, when things are equalized, the burden of partial preferences is cast off.\n\nTo know to stop at what one does not know—this is perfection. Who knows the debate that does not speak, the Dao that is not spoken? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Storehouse. Pour into it without filling it; draw from it without depleting it; yet one does not know whence it comes—this is called preserving the light.\n\nWhat one does not know lies beyond the bounds of inherent nature. Thus, to stop within what one knows is to reach perfection. Vast and unconstrained, one entrusts all to it. The mind of the perfected one is like a mirror: it responds but does not store, so it remains open without fluctuation of fullness or emptiness. The coming of the ultimate principle leaves no trace. Allowing it to clarify itself, its light is never dimmed.\n\nThus, long ago, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I face south, I cannot put it aside. What is the reason?\" Shun said: \"Those three lords dwell among the mugwort and reeds. Why can you not put it aside? In ancient times, ten suns appeared together, and the myriad things were all illuminated—how much more so for one whose virtue surpasses the sun!\" Yao’s way of peaceful acceptance was not yet vast, so he listened to court affairs without joy. Seeking to lodge the principle of luminous equality in a great sage, he posed this strange question to elicit an answer.\n\nWhat things find peaceful has no baseness, so the mugwort and reeds are the wondrous abode of those three lords. When the doubled brightness ascends the heavens, the six directions are all illuminated, and there is no mugwort or reed that is not bathed in light.",

Without small or great, without long life or early death, the cicada does not envy the great *chun* tree and rejoices in its own contentment; the marsh pheasant does not prize the celestial pond and finds glory in its own sufficiency.",

One such as this rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Life and death bring no change to him—how much less the mere tips of benefit and harm!\"\n\nWithout intent, yet nothing is not accorded. When spirit is whole and faculties complete, and the body merges with things, though one traverses the most extreme transformations, one has never ceased to be oneself. Thus, nothing lingers or lodges in the breast.\n\nOne lodges in things and moves—it is not the self that acts. Having taken change as one’s body, life and death are as one. Day and night pass without life or death—how much less can benefit and harm disturb the mind?\n\nJu Quezi asked Chang Wuzi, \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue profit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao. Without words, they speak; with words, they are wordless—and roam beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered these careless words, but I take them as the practice of the wondrous Dao. How do you think I should regard them?\"\n\nChang Wuzi said, \"Even the Yellow Emperor would have been perplexed by such words—how could Confucius know them! Moreover, you are far too hasty in your reckoning. Seeing an egg, you demand the crowing of the rooster at dawn; seeing a slingshot, you seek the roasted owl. I have spoken to you carelessly—why not listen carelessly in turn?\n\n\"To stand beside the sun and moon, to embrace the cosmos, to let things meet of themselves, to set aside confusion and disorder—why rank them in order of honor? The multitude toil to and fro; the sage appears foolish and dull. They blend the myriad ages into a single purity. All things are thus, and in this they are mutually enfolded.\n\n\"Affairs come of themselves, and principle responds of itself—one does not follow and engage with them. Proceeding straightforwardly, one avoids nothing and seeks nothing. Seeking brings no delight; taking directly brings no anger. This is the singular attainment.\n\n\"All that bears a name is not what I call it—they each name themselves. Thus, there is no 'that' with words and no 'this' without words. All that is not true nature is dust and grime.\n\n\"Things have their spontaneity; principle has its ultimate. Following it directly, one merges obscurely of itself—no words are needed. Thus, to speak is careless, and to hear is to be perplexed. Even the Yellow Emperor could not prevent all things from harboring attachments and being perplexed to the end. Therefore, the sage entrusts things to the realm beyond dust and grime, mysteriously uniting with what lies beyond sight and hearing. Illumined by Heaven, they do not oppose with calculation; released to spontaneity, they do not force clarity.\n\n\"Now, Ju Quezi, upon hearing careless words, you immediately take them as the practice of the wondrous Dao. This is no different from seeing an egg and demanding the rooster’s crow or seeing a slingshot and seeking the roasted owl. Those who cannot rest in their time and follow the natural order, who probe change and seek transformation, who contemplate death while alive, who cling to 'this' to debate 'that'—all are those who oppose with calculation.\n\n\"To speak is to be careless—so I have spoken carelessly. But if you listen to careless words as if they were true, you are again too hasty in your reckoning. So listen carelessly—why not?\n\n\"To take life and death as day and night is the metaphor of standing beside the sun and moon. To take the myriad things as a single body is the analogy of embracing the cosmos. Because there is that which is deemed base, honor and lowliness arise, and confusion and disorder proliferate, with none able to set them right. Each is self-certain in its own corner.\n\n\"Thus, for the Dao of effortless self-union, nothing is better than setting it aside and not speaking, entrusting it to spontaneity. To be vast and boundless is to be without waves or shores. To gallop through the realm of 'this' and 'that' is to be impure. Purity is to be without admixture.\n\n\"To survey the myriad ages and blend their changes—ordinary people call this 'mixed.' Thus, they toil in body and startle the mind, shunning 'that' and clinging to 'this.' Only the great sage, without attachment, proceeds straightforwardly and becomes one with change. In constant oneness with change, they ever roam in singularity. Though they blend countless ages, a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions, when the Dao moves through them and completes them, past and present are one. When things name them, the myriad things are as one.\n\n\"Nothing is not so; no time is not complete—this may be called purity. Nothing is not so. 'Enfolded' means accumulated. Accumulating 'this' over the myriad ages makes the myriad ages one 'this.' Accumulating 'so' over the myriad things makes the myriad things all 'so.'\n\n\"Thus, one does not know where life and death, before and after, reside; where 'that' and 'I,' victory and defeat, go. How do I know that delighting in life is not delusion? Life and death are one, yet one delights only in life—desiring to oppose change. Thus, one does not know it is delusion.\n\n\"How do I know that hating death is not like a youth lost and unable to return home? Young and losing one’s former home is called 'youth lost.' The youth lost settles into where they are and does not know to return to their homeland. How do I know that life is not such a youth lost? How do I know that death is not a return home—and yet one hates it?\n\n\"Li Ji was the daughter of the border guard of Ai. When the state of Jin first obtained her, she wept until her tears soaked her collar. But when she reached the king’s palace, shared his bed, and ate fine meats, she later regretted her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret having sought life?\n\n\"Within a single lifetime, emotions change like this. On that day, one does not know the other—how much less can one know the change of life and death! 'Sought' means 'desired.'\n\n\"One who dreams of drinking wine wakes and weeps; one who dreams of weeping wakes and goes hunting. While dreaming, one does not know it is a dream.

If circumstances change, emotions differ, and so the wishes of life and death cannot be the same. Thus, when alive, one delights in life; when dead, one delights in death. Though life and death differ, in each attaining their own wish they are one—what is there to cling to? From this perspective, at the moment of death, one does not know it as death but simply follows one’s own inclination. The dreamer who within a dream divines that dream differs not at all from the waking man. In the moment of encounter, nothing is lacking—why then, while alive, should one worry about death?\n\nThe great awakened one is the sage. The great awakened one knows that those who harbor anxieties and concerns remain unawakened. Fools, lost in their great dream, believe themselves awake, smugly distinguishing what they favor as rulers and what they despise as herdsmen, delighting in the biased views of their own faction—how narrow-minded they are! Unable to forget words and attain spiritual understanding, they are not truly awakened. Extraordinary discourse is beyond the comprehension of ordinary men, hence it is called *diaodang zhuogui* (startling and paradoxical), and they fail to recognize its profound liberation.\n\nThose who can shed all attachments and harmonize life and death are exceedingly rare. Even if you and I were to debate, and you defeated me, or I defeated you—would you truly be right? Would I truly be wrong? If I defeated you, and you did not defeat me, would I truly be right? Would you truly be wrong? Is it possible that one of us is right? Or that one of us is wrong? Or that both are right? Or that both are wrong? You and I cannot know for certain. People are inherently shrouded in obscurity—whom could I ask to judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with you to judge, since he agrees with you, how could he judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with me to judge, since he agrees with me, how could he judge rightly? If I asked one who differs from both you and me to judge, since he differs from us, how could he judge rightly? If I asked one who agrees with both you and me to judge, since he agrees with us, how could he judge rightly? Thus, you, I, and others all cannot know for certain—should we then await another?\n\nYou and *er* both mean \"you.\" Without knowing, one speculates; without seeing, one debates. Debating is insufficient for self-assurance because it opposes things. Debating all day remains shrouded in obscurity, and in the end, none can be rightly judged—thus, one must leave it to self-correction. Agreement does not suffice as proof, nor does disagreement as grounds for rejection. If what you hold to be right were truly right, then no one in the world could contradict it; if what you believe to be wrong were truly wrong, then there would be no basis for anyone to affirm it. Now, people affirm what they agree on and reject what they differ on—with agreement and difference both present, right and wrong have no fixed ground.\n\nThus, right and wrong arise from the love of debate and rest in the *tianjun* (Heavenly Equalizer). Entrust them to the two alternatives and let them resolve themselves. Each corrects itself. Relying on another is insufficient to correct oneself, so no one in the world can correct another—thus, one must leave it to self-correction to reach the ultimate.\n\nThe *tianni* (Heavenly Boundary) is the natural division. Right and wrong, affirmation and negation, self and other oppose one another—hence, there is no debate. Without debate, one harmonizes with the *tianni*, abiding in one’s natural division alone, without relying on another for correction. The mutual dependence of opposing voices is like their non-dependence. Harmonizing with the *tianni* and following the boundless transformation, one exhausts the years.\n\n\"What does it mean to harmonize with the *tianni*?\" It means: \"Is it so? Is it not so? So or not so. If what is right were truly right, then its difference from what is not right would require no debate; if what is so were truly so, then its difference from what is not so would require no debate.\" Forgetting years, forgetting righteousness, one roams beyond all bounds—thus, one lodges in the boundless. The debate over right and wrong is but the transformation of voices. The mutual dependence of these transforming voices is insufficient to correct one another, so they are as if non-dependent. Harmonizing with the natural division and following the infinite transformation, pursuing this path, the realm of right and wrong naturally dissolves, and the essence of life and destiny is fully realized.\n\nForgetting years, one harmonizes life and death; forgetting righteousness, one transcends right and wrong. When right and wrong, life and death dissolve into one, this is the ultimate principle. The ultimate principle flows without limit—thus, those who lodge in it cannot be exhausted.\n\nThe shadow’s companion asked the shadow, \"Earlier, you were moving; now, you are still. Earlier, you were sitting; now, you are rising. Why are you so without constancy?\"\n\nThe shadow replied, \"Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada? How would I know why it is so? How would I know why it is not so?\"",

On that day, one does not know the other—how much less can one know the change of life and death! 'Sought' means 'desired.'\n\n\"One who dreams of drinking wine wakes and weeps; one who dreams of weeping wakes and goes hunting. While dreaming, one does not know it is a dream. Within the dream, one may even divine the dream—only upon waking does one know it was a dream.\"",

      "translated_text": "The \"shadow’s companion\" is the faint shade beyond the shadow. This speaks to the natural workings of the celestial mechanism, where sitting and rising occur without dependence. Those who attain without dependence—who can fathom their cause and demand their reason? If one insists on tracing their dependence and seeking their origin, such inquiry would stretch endlessly, ultimately reaching the state of no-dependence, where the principle of spontaneous transformation becomes clear. If one were to depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada, the lack of constancy would not be hard to understand. The reason it is not understood now is precisely because it does not depend on such things but transforms spontaneously.\n\nSome in the world say the shadow’s companion depends on the shadow, the shadow on form, and form on the Creator. Let us ask: Does the Creator exist or not? If not, how could it create things? If so, it would not suffice to account for the multitude of forms. Only by recognizing that the multitude of forms arise from themselves can one begin to speak of creation. Thus, within the realm of existing things, even the shadow’s companion does not fail to transform spontaneously in profound obscurity. Therefore, the Creator has no master, and each thing creates itself. Each thing creates itself without dependence—this is the true nature of heaven and earth.\n\nThus, self and other are mutually entailed, form and shadow arise together; though profoundly united, they do not depend on one another. Understanding this principle will lead all things to return to their root within themselves without relying on externals. Externally, nothing is to be rejected; internally, nothing is to be prized. Therefore, all things emerge serenely without knowing why they are born, and all attain their nature without knowing how they attain it. Now, the shadow’s companion’s relation to the shadow is like saying they arise together without dependence. Thus, though all things gather and together complete heaven, each stands distinctly and sees itself alone. Therefore, the shadow’s companion is not controlled by the shadow, nor is the shadow moved by form, nor is form transformed by nothingness. Whether transformed or not, so or not so, following others or acting on one’s own—all arise spontaneously. How could I know their cause?\n\nThus, to follow without aiding is to allow root and branch, inner and outer, to flow unimpeded and attain their nature, leaving no trace. If one clings to proximate causes and forgets their spontaneity, seeking externals and losing the inner master, then attachment and esteem arise. Though one may wish to equalize and harmonize, what is esteemed already resides in the heart—how can there be any leveling?\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering and joyful, a butterfly content with itself. He did not know he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and there he was, palpably Zhou. Did Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things. Delighting in one’s own joy, acting with ease and pleasure—when he dreamed he was a butterfly and did not know he was Zhou, it was no different from death. Yet wherever he was, he was content. Thus, those who cling to life while alive will surely cling to death when dying. From this, we see that those who grieve over death while alive are mistaken.\n\nSpeaking from Zhou’s perspective, he called it waking, but it may not have been waking. Now, not knowing the butterfly is no different from the dream’s not knowing Zhou. Each suits its momentary contentment, so there is no way to prove the butterfly does not dream it is Zhou. Some dream in a brief nap and experience a hundred years—there is no way to prove that this hundred years is not a dream in a nap. Time does not pause for even a moment, and the present does not endure. Thus, yesterday’s dream has already transformed by today. The change between life and death is no different—why trouble the heart over it?\n\nTo be so absorbed in one is to be unaware of the other—this is like dreaming of being a butterfly. To take it from a human perspective, in a single lifetime, the present does not know the future—this is like Lady Li. Yet fools secretly believe they know that life is joyful and death is bitter, never having heard of the transformation of things.\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Zhuangzi, \"The Secret of Caring for Life\"*\n\nMy life has limits, but knowledge is without bounds. To pursue the boundless with the limited is perilous! And to do so while claiming to be wise is perilous indeed! In doing good, avoid seeking fame; in doing evil, avoid approaching punishment. Follow the central path as your constant guide—this can preserve the body, fulfill life, nurture one’s kin, and complete one’s years.\n\nLife exists to be nurtured, so nurturing life is the ultimate principle. Yet if nurturing exceeds its limit and harms life, it is no longer the true way of nurturing life. The endowment each receives has its own limit. Lifting heavy weights and carrying light ones while the spirit and qi remain unperturbed—this is the limit of one’s strength. Those who crave fame and compete for victory, even if they break their backs, will never satisfy their desires—this is the boundlessness of knowledge. Thus, the pursuit of knowledge arises from imbalance and vanishes in profound spontaneity.\n\nProfound spontaneity means following one’s utmost capacity without adding even a hair’s weight. Therefore, though bearing ten thousand jun, if it matches one’s ability, one suddenly forgets the weight on one’s body. Though responding to ten thousand affairs, one remains oblivious to their presence. This is the true way of nurturing life. To seek boundless knowledge with a limited nature—how can one not be exhausted? Already exhausted by knowledge and not knowing to stop, then using knowledge to remedy it—this is nurturing that harms, truly perilous.\n\nForgetting good and evil and abiding in the center, allowing all things to act on their own, merging obscurely with the most fitting—thus, punishments and fame keep their distance, and perfect principle resides within. Taking the central path as one’s constant, nurturing one’s kin appropriately—if one attains the center and moves in profound spontaneity, then nothing is impossible. Nurturing life does not seek to exceed one’s portion; it is merely about fulfilling principle and completing one’s years.\n\nWhen Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui, where his hand touched, his shoulder leaned, his foot stepped, his knee pressed—*hua!*—the sounds rang out.

      "translated_text": "When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own children, and the young weeping as if for their own mothers. Those who gathered there must have been moved to speak when no words were sought, to weep when no weeping was sought. This is to flee from Heaven and betray one’s nature, to forget what one has received—ancients called this \"the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.\" When he came, it was the Master’s time; when he departed, it was the Master’s compliance. To rest in one’s time and abide in compliance is to keep sorrow and joy from entering—ancients called this \"the Great Release.\"\n\nThe perfected person has no personal attachments and merely joins the crowd in lamentation, so such conduct is fitting. The nature one receives from Heaven has its own proper measure; it cannot be escaped, nor can it be augmented. To flee from Heaven’s principle and amplify worldly emotions, to let sorrow and joy pass through the heart, is to bind the spirit in suffering, no different from flogging. Was this not a kind of punishment? The enlightened of old held such views.\n\nTime brings life of itself; principle demands death. Sorrow and joy arise from loss and gain. But the sage who embodies mysterious penetration and harmonizes with change is at peace in every moment, at home in every circumstance. Merged with the transformations of creation, there is nowhere that is not oneself—what gain or loss, what life or death could there be? Thus, to follow what one has received is to leave no space for sorrow or joy to intrude.\n\nTo take the bound as suspended is to see the unbound as the Great Release. In this release, the truth of one’s nature and destiny is realized—this is the essence of nurturing life. A finger may be exhausted in serving as kindling, but the fire is transmitted, and its end is unknown. \"Exhausted\" means \"ended\"; \"kindling\" is like the previous fuel. The finger may reach the end of the previous fuel’s principle, yet the fire is passed on and does not expire. The heart that receives nurturance continues life without cessation. This reveals that nurturing life is the very means by which life endures.\n\nTime does not return, and the present does not pause. Thus, a person’s life is but a single breath, a single moment of attainment. The previous breath is not the present breath, so nurturance continues life; the former flame is not the later flame, so the fire is transmitted through the fuel. The fire is transmitted and life continues—this is the culmination of nurturance. How could the world know that life is exhausted only to be reborn?\n\nFrom *Zhuangzi*, \"Inner Chapters,\" \"The Human World\" (Chapter Four):\nYan Hui sought an audience with Confucius and asked to be sent on a mission.",

      "translated_text": "Yan Hui said, \"Where are you going?\"\nHe replied, \"I am going to the state of Wei.\"\nYan Hui asked, \"What will you do there?\"\nHe replied, \"I have heard that the lord of Wei is in his prime, yet his conduct is willful. He treats his state lightly and does not recognize his faults. He recklessly expends his people’s lives, and the dead are measured by the state as if filling a marsh—like reeds, the people have nowhere to turn. I once heard you say, ‘Leave a well-governed state; go to a disordered one. The physician’s gate is crowded with the sick.’ I wish to apply what I have heard and reflect on how to act, hoping that the state may yet be cured.\"\n\nOne who mingles with others cannot depart from them. Yet the vicissitudes of the human world differ with each generation, and only those who are without fixed intent and do not impose their own will can adapt to change without bearing its burdens. He does not share the people’s desires. For one who rules others, every action rides upon the people—one outburst of anger brings corpses and flowing blood, one moment of joy fills the roads with carriages and caps. Thus, the ruler’s use of the state cannot be taken lightly. None dare admonish him. He recklessly drives them to their deaths. The entire state is delivered to the brink of death, countless as the fallen, regarded as mere grass and weeds. They have nowhere to turn.\n\nConfucius said, \"Alas! You are likely to go and be punished! The Dao does not tolerate杂乱.杂乱 leads to excess, excess to disturbance, disturbance to worry, and worry cannot be remedied. The utmost person of old first established it within themselves before establishing it in others. If what is established within oneself is not yet settled, how can one attend to the conduct of a violent ruler? Their Dao is insufficient to save that affliction. It is fitting to find the right person. If one does not find the right person, then even if a hundred physicians guard the illness, it will only deepen doubt and fail to bring a single cure. To respond to things without an empty mind and to exhaust one’s thoughts in confronting difficulties—this shows that what is established within oneself is not yet settled. Only by setting aside knowledge to nurture the true, entrusting the wondrous to the talents of the multitude, attributing merit and fame to others while keeping worries and concerns far from oneself, can one then proceed to the conduct of a violent ruler.\n\nDo you also know whence virtue’s dissipation and knowledge’s emergence arise? Virtue dissipates for the sake of fame, and knowledge emerges from contention. Fame is that by which people vie; knowledge is the instrument of contention. Both are inauspicious tools, not means to fully realize one’s conduct. Virtue’s dissipation stems from pride in fame; knowledge’s reckless emergence stems from contention over goodness. Even Jie and Zhi, in what they prized and cherished, sought nothing beyond fame and goodness. Fame and wisdom are what the world employs. Yet when fame arises, contention follows; when wisdom is used, strife flourishes. Thus, only by abandoning fame and knowledge can one’s conduct be fully realized.\n\nMoreover, thick virtue and steadfast trust have not yet reached others’ *qi*; fame without contention has not yet reached others’ hearts. To forcibly display the language of benevolence and righteousness, compass and square before a violent ruler is to make others resent what they perceive as your beauty—this is called ‘bringing disaster upon others.’ One who brings disaster upon others will surely have disaster reflected back upon them. You are likely to bring disaster upon yourself. If you merely delight in the worthy and despise the unworthy, what need is there to seek distinction? If you do not instruct, the king and dukes will surely exploit others to vie for victory. Your eyes will be dazzled, your complexion will become placid, your mouth will scheme, your demeanor will take shape, and your heart will conform. This is like using fire to save fire, water to save water—it is called ‘increasing excess.’ Following the beginning without end, you will likely, with insincere grand words, meet your death before the violent ruler!\n\nWhen one offers a luminous pearl at night, few do not grasp their swords—this is because they do not understand. Now, your virtue and trust, along with your fame of non-contention, are things they do not understand. To forcibly apply the standards of benevolence and righteousness to them, they will say you seek to destroy others to establish yourself. Thus, the utmost person does not exhaust their will in ordering the world but responds to things with an empty mind. Sincerity and trust are manifest in heaven and earth; non-contention flows freely among the myriad things. Only then do the myriad things return to embrace them, heaven and earth do not oppose them, their virtuous reputation spreads and the world responds in harmony, their illustrious conduct shines and the six directions all answer. Only then can one traverse cold and heat, navigate order and chaos, without clashing with the dragon’s reversed scales.\n\nIf your approach is not trusted, they will say you contend for fame and turn to harm you. If you can delight in the worthy and despise the foolish, hear righteousness and submit, you will be a enlightened ruler. If you are an enlightened ruler, you will not suffer from a lack of worthy ministers, and your going will not be extraordinary. If it is not so, you will surely be harmed. Thus, to go with intent is to have no place to go; to respond without intent is to have response come of itself—then there is nowhere you cannot go. You need only remain silent and wordless. If you speak, the king and dukes will surely exploit their authority as rulers to engage in verbal sparring, using clever speech to reject admonition and adorn their faults. Their words will be quick and persuasive, dazzling the eyes. You will be unable to distinguish yourself from them, with no time to save or extricate yourself, and will end up releasing yourself to follow them. Unable to save them, you will only strengthen their power.\n\nClinging to the usual and refusing to change, they will not trust you. To admonish without trust, even earnest words will bring harm. Moreover, in ancient times, Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both were those who cultivated themselves and humbly comforted the people, yet by submitting to those below, they offended those above. Thus, their rulers used their cultivation to cast them out. These were lovers of fame. In ancient times, Yao attacked Cong, Zhi, Xu, and Ao, and Yu attacked Youhu. Their states became wastelands of the dead, and they themselves were executed. Their use of arms did not cease, their pursuit of fame and substance was unending—have you alone not heard of this? Fame and substance are things even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can you!\"",

      "translated_text": "The Master said, \"Perfect! I shall tell you this: if you can enter and wander within its enclosure without being moved by its name, then when it enters, you will respond; when it does not enter, you will cease. Without gate, without governance—abiding in the single dwelling of inevitability—then you are near.\n\nHaving attained the service of the mind’s purification, you will be without self. The realm where the unmoored heart finds itself is where one should stop at the real. It is like the notes of the pentatonic scale: they respond without intention, and thus it is called resonance. To respond without intention is to follow the other without forcing a reply. Let things be as they are—this is to be without gate. Entrusting the world to its natural ease—this is to be without governance. *Du* means to govern. Inevitability is the necessity of principle, the dwelling of utmost singularity that meets the tally of necessity. Principle is exhausted in this.\n\nCutting off tracks is easy; leaving no trace upon the earth is difficult. Being used by others is easy to feign; being used by Heaven is difficult to feign. We have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings; we have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge. Behold that empty chamber: in the vacant room, whiteness arises, and auspiciousness comes to rest. If one does not come to rest, this is called sitting in motion. If one follows the ears and eyes, turning inward while abandoning the mind’s knowledge, then even ghosts and spirits will come to dwell—how much more so men! This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the ultimate course of Fuxi and Jiqu, and how much more so for those who are scattered!\n\nNot acting is easy; to act without treading upon the earth is impossible. Non-doing is easy; to act without harming one’s nature is unattainable. What the eyes and ears grasp is coarse, and thus easily deceived. But the response of spontaneity is subtle, and thus difficult to feign. The less one loses of the real, the less one is incomplete; the more one loses of the real, the more one is incomplete. The recompense for loss and gain has never failed to match its measure. To go against Heaven and feign falsity—is this not difficult?\n\nWords must have their instruments to accomplish their tasks. Now, without the dwelling of utmost emptiness, how can one have the reality of transforming things? To see something as if it were nothing—this is the vacant room. In the vacant room, pure whiteness arises alone. Where auspiciousness gathers is in utmost emptiness and stillness. If one does not rest in what is fitting, does not meet the ultimate, then even in the days of responding while sitting, one races without cease. Thus, the outer enemy has not yet arrived, yet one is already exhausted within—how can one transform things?\n\nIf one closes the ears and eyes and naturally attains, then the mind’s knowledge is externalized. Therefore, to follow one’s nature and move directly, going nowhere without darkness—how could one be burdened by the obscure and hidden, let alone the entanglements of the human world? Things have no nobility or baseness; none fail to communicate through the mind’s knowledge and the ears and eyes. Thus, what the world calls knowledge—is it desired in order to know? What it calls seeing—is it done in order to see? If knowledge and sight could be obtained by desire and effort, then could one desire worthiness and obtain worthiness, or strive for sagehood and attain sagehood? Certainly not.\n\nYet the world does not know that knowledge knows itself, and so seeks to know by desiring knowledge; it does not see that seeing sees itself, and so seeks to see by desiring sight. Not knowing that life lives itself, it then strives to live by contriving life. Thus, seeing the eyes, one demands the clarity of Li Zhu; hearing the ears, one demands the acuity of Shi Kuang. The spirit races within, the ears and eyes are exhausted without, the body is ill at ease, and one is no longer in darkness with things. Not being in darkness, how can one harmonize with the changes of the human world or respond to the rhythms of every generation?\n\nLord Gaogao of Ye was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi. He asked Confucius, saying, 'The king’s charge to me, Zhu Liang, is most weighty. Qi’s treatment of envoys is generally respectful but not urgent. Even a common man cannot be moved—how much less a feudal lord! I am deeply fearful. You once told Zhu Liang: \"In all matters, whether small or great, few do not rely on the Dao to achieve joyful completion. If the matter is not completed, there will surely be the calamity of human judgment; if it is completed, there will surely be the calamity of yin and yang. Only those with virtue can achieve completion or non-completion without calamity.\" My meals are coarse and not refined, and my cook has no desire for coolness. Yet this morning I received the charge, and by evening I am drinking ice—is this not the heat within me? I have not yet reached the truth of the matter, yet I already have the calamity of yin and yang! If the matter is not completed, there will surely be the calamity of human judgment—this is a double burden. As a minister, I am not equal to this task. Please tell me what to do!'\n\nThe weight of the mission is because he seeks something. He fears that Qi will merely return empty respect and not urgently respond to his request. In matters great or small, few fail to achieve joyful completion through words—this is what Confucius once told Zhu Liang. Those who rely on completion for joy will be angered if it is not achieved. This is something even the King of Chu cannot avoid. Though the human calamity may be averted, joy and fear still war in the breast, and ice is already congealed in the five viscera. Only those with virtue can entrust success or failure to the other without troubling the heart!\n\nFacing the fire without thinking of coolness shows the frugality of his fare. That his fare is frugal yet he drinks ice from inner heat is truly due to the difficulty of the matter, not the excellence of the food. Before the matter is completed, he only fears it will not be. If it truly fails, then fear will congeal within, and the net of punishment will spread without.\n\nConfucius said, 'There are two great precepts under Heaven: one is fate, the other is duty. Your love for your parents is fate—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to his lord is duty—there is nowhere he can go under Heaven that is not his lord, nowhere to escape within the earth.'\"",
      "overlap_context": "scard heterodoxies and rely on singularity—abandon the senses, set aside the mind’s intentions, and accord with the self-attainment of qi and nature: this is to be empty and await things. Empty the mind, and the supreme Dao will gather in your embrace.\n\nYan Hui said, \"Before I had yet received this teaching, there truly was a Yan Hui. Having received it, there has never been a Yan Hui—may this be called emptiness?\"\n\nHe had not yet practiced the purification of the mind, and so his self remained.",

      "translated_text": "These are called the great precepts. Thus, in serving one’s parents, to be at ease without choosing the place is the utmost filial piety; in serving one’s lord, to be at ease without choosing the task is the height of loyalty. In serving one’s own heart, sorrow and joy do not alter what lies before it—knowing the inevitable and accepting it as fate is the perfection of virtue.\n\nFor a minister on the brink, there are indeed things he cannot avoid. Acting with the truth of the matter and forgetting himself, how could he have leisure to delight in life and dread death? The Master’s conduct is thus! Naturally bound fast, it cannot be undone.\n\nWhen a thousand gather, if none is taken as master, disorder will lead to dissolution. Thus, many worthy men cannot have many lords, and without worthies there cannot be no lord—this is the Dao of Heaven and man, the inevitable principle. If a lord could be fled and parents untied, there would be no need for precepts.\n\nTo know the inevitable as fate and accept it is to be without sorrow or joy—how could one’s bearing be altered? Thus, in profound obscurity, one takes what one encounters as fate and does not interpose the heart between them, merging utterly with what is most fitting without joy or sorrow within. Even in serving ordinary men, there is nowhere one does not find accord—how much more so with lord and parents!\n\nMatters have their inevitabilities, principles are ever-pervading. Thus, to entrust them is to accomplish them, and where matters are accomplished yet the self is not preserved—such has never been. Why then trouble the heart over the self? Principles are without obstruction, so one should entrust what one encounters and proceed directly.\n\nIf one’s faith in the Dao is not steadfast and likes and dislikes remain in the heart, unable to proceed with what is most fitting while scheming for life and fearing death, I have never seen such a one succeed in his affairs.\n\nLet me repeat what I have heard: In close dealings, trust must be mutually confirmed; in distant dealings, loyalty must be conveyed through words. Words must sometimes be transmitted. To transmit words of twofold joy or twofold anger is the most difficult thing under Heaven.\n\nFor twofold joy invariably produces excessive praise, and twofold anger invariably produces excessive blame. All excess is falsehood; falsehood breeds distrust, and distrust brings calamity to the transmitter. Thus, the model saying goes: *\"Transmit the constant truth, do not transmit excessive words—then you will be nearly whole.\"*\n\nThose near at hand can verify, so their trust is confirmed through direct contact. Those afar must convey intent through words. Words of joy and anger, if they exceed reality, should be transmitted so that neither side loses the mean—hence the difficulty. *Excess* means going beyond. Words of joy and anger always exceed what is fitting. Suspecting the words are not his, one assumes the transmitter fabricates. Distrust arises. If excessive words are transmitted, it seems like wild falsehood. The recipient doubts, and the transmitter is arbitrarily blamed for exaggeration or understatement.\n\nEven if one hears momentary excesses, do not transmit them. Instead, convey the constant truth and capture the sincerity of the intent—then you will be nearly whole.\n\nMoreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin in openness but invariably end in secrecy; when excess prevails, many strange tactics arise. Those who drink wine with ritual begin in order but invariably end in chaos; when excess prevails, many strange pleasures arise. All things are thus: they begin in sincerity but invariably end in baseness. Their inception is simple, but their conclusion must be vast.\n\nWords are like wind and waves; actions are like gain and loss. Wind and waves are easily stirred; gain and loss are easily imperiled. Thus, anger arises without cause, and artful speech with biased words. When beasts die, they do not choose their cries—gasping and disordered, they give rise to vicious hearts. Scrutiny carried too far must evoke unworthy responses, yet one does not know it is so. If one does not know it is so, who knows where it will end?\n\nThus, the model saying goes: *\"Do not alter commands, do not urge completion. Going beyond is adding to them.\"* Altering commands and urging completion endanger affairs. Beauty takes time to perfect; evil, once done, cannot be undone—can one not be cautious?\n\nOriginally, all enjoyed the game. When the desire to win arises, it secretly gives rise to harming others. No longer following principle, distinctions of rank are lost, and toasts proceed without order. Drunkenness and excess prevail, reaching every extreme. Trouble arises from simplicity, affairs from the minute—this is the inevitable course.\n\nWords are like wind and waves; thus, acting on them is like gain and loss. If one leaves wind and waves unacted upon, then reality is not lost. When affairs attain their reality, danger can be pacified and turmoil settled.\n\nThe arising of anger has no other cause—it always comes from artful words exceeding reality and biased speech missing the mark. Like wild beasts driven into a corner, their cries urgent and their breath spent, harmony does not come, and their breath is disordered. Suddenly enraged, they both give rise to vicious sores in mutual opposition.\n\nTo be broad and accommodate all things, all things will gather to you. Scrutiny carried too far breeds petty and miserly hearts without one’s awareness. Thus, the great man lets things roam freely in the realm of self-attainment, neither begrudging others’ abilities nor exhausting their joy. Therefore, the fellowship of the four seas can be preserved whole.\n\nIf one does not realize this, how can one know where fortune and misfortune equally lead?\n\nTransmit the other’s reality. Entrust its natural completion. Adding to it is not entrusting reality—this endangers affairs. Beauty is completed by entrusting its timely transformation, like planting—it cannot be done in a single morning. To urge completion of what one dislikes is to invite regret and failure.\n\nMoreover, to ride things with the heart and entrust the inevitable to nurture the center—this is perfection. What need is there to act in repayment? It is best to deliver one’s mandate—this is the difficult part.\n\nTo lodge the mind in things is to entrust the inevitable course of principle. The fullness of the Mean is thus preserved—this is the utmost in engaging with things. One should entrust the reality of what is to be repaid—why interpose one’s intent in the matter?",

      "translated_text": "Delivering one’s mandate directly is easiest, yet applying joy and anger to the heart makes it difficult.\n\nWhen Yan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei, he asked Qu Boyu, saying: “There is a man here whose virtue is heaven-sent for destruction. If I deal with him without restraint, it will endanger our state; if I deal with him with restraint, it will endanger myself. His knowledge suffices only to recognize others’ faults, not their causes. In such a case, what should I do?”\n\nThe nature of petty men is such that if you guide them by rules, they resent you; if you indulge their excesses, they throw the state into chaos. Unaware that the people’s faults arise from themselves, they blame the people and never reform. Qu Boyu said: “An excellent question! Be on guard, be cautious—rectify yourself! In form, nothing is better than compliance; in heart, nothing is better than harmony. Yet these two have their perils. Compliance must not become submission, harmony must not become display. If in form you comply and submit, you will be overthrown, destroyed, collapse, or stumble. If in heart you harmonize and display yourself, you will become a reputation, a name, an omen, a calamity.\n\nLet him be an infant, and you be an infant with him; let him be without boundaries, and you be without boundaries with him; let him be without limits, and you be without limits with him—thus guiding him to enter flawlessness. Through repeated encounters and convergence, both serve to rectify yourself. In form, do not oppose; in harmony, do not conform. Compliance in form is following; submission is merging with him. Harmony is aided by rightness; display is self-promotion.\n\nIf you merge with him, you will topple and not support him, perishing together. Thus, you must model yourself on heaven and earth, merely avoiding petty distinctions. If you display your harmony, you will earn a reputation for tolerance, but aiding his reputation will make him resent your superiority and recklessly spawn calamities. Therefore, you must remain obscure as if in darkness, blending like dust in light—then you cannot be drawn near or kept distant, cannot be benefited or harmed. Do not set small edges against his scales.\n\nDo you not know the mantis? It brandishes its arms to block a chariot’s wheel, unaware of its incapacity—such is the beauty of its talent. Beware, be cautious! To accumulate your strengths and beauties to challenge him is perilous indeed! The mantis’s brandished arms are not without beauty, yet blocking the chariot’s wheel is simply no match. Now, with knowledge insufficient to cope, you seek to forcefully take on this task—this is the mantis brandishing its arms. To accumulate your talents, boast of your beauties, and challenge this man is the path to danger.\n\nDo you not know those who raise tigers? They dare not feed them living creatures, for fear of their killing rage; they dare not feed them whole creatures, for fear of their rending rage. They time their hunger and satiety, understanding their angry hearts. Tigers and humans are of different kinds, yet tigers fawn on those who raise them—this is compliance. Thus, those they kill are those who oppose them. They fear that a killing intent will provoke rage. If you make the tiger bite and tear its food, it will use force and grow angry. Know the cause of its anger and comply with it. Compliance with principle makes even different kinds grow affectionate; opposition to nature makes even the closest turn to arms.\n\nThose who love horses use baskets to collect their dung and conch shells to collect their urine.

      "translated_text": "It merely lodges there by chance! It takes this as the scorn of those who do not know it. Had it not become a sacred tree, it would nearly have been felled! Moreover, what it preserves differs from the multitude, yet you compare it by righteousness—is this not far off the mark?\"\n\nHe still suspected that the tree took pride in being a sacred tree, rather than simply seeking the useless. The sacred tree merely came to lodge there—it was not that the tree sought to become one. This tree, then, took the sacred tree as one who did not know it and thus brought disgrace and affliction—how could this be an honor? The tree itself took its uselessness as its use, so even if it were not a sacred tree, it would still ultimately avoid the harm of being felled. It preserved itself by not preserving, while the multitude preserved by preserving. Benefiting others and nurturing things, restraining people from wrongdoing—these are the duties of the sacred tree. But the useless one, serene and unobtrusive, allows all talents to be used; each self-using thing attains its proper place without interference—this is how the useless preserves life. You praise it as a sacred tree—how could it come close to that?\n\nNanbo Ziqi wandered in the hills of Shang and saw a great tree, unlike any other: its shade could shelter a thousand chariots, and travelers sought refuge beneath its foliage. Ziqi said, \"What tree is this? It must possess extraordinary timber!\" Looking up at its slender branches, he saw they were gnarled and unfit for beams or rafters; looking down at its great roots, he saw they were split and could not be made into coffins. Tasting its leaves, his mouth was blistered and wounded; smelling it, he was struck with a madness that lasted three days. Yet its branches provided shade enough to shelter a thousand chariots. Ziqi said, \"This is truly a useless tree, and yet it has grown so vast! Alas, the spirit-like person—such is their uselessness.\"\n\nWhen a ruler is useless to the hundred officials, the hundred officials manage their own affairs: the clear-sighted see for him, the keen-eared hear for him, the wise plan for him, the brave defend for him. What does he do? He remains darkly silent. And when all talents do not lose their proper place, then the useless becomes what all talents ultimately rely upon. Thus, the world delights in exalting him without tiring, riding upon the ten thousand things without harm.\n\n\"In Song there was a place called Jing, where catalpa, cypress, and mulberry thrived. Those with trunks the size of an arm’s embrace were felled by those seeking pegs for monkeys; those three or four spans around were felled by those seeking high and famous beams; those seven or eight spans around were felled by the families of nobles and wealthy merchants seeking side planks. Thus, they did not live out their natural years but were cut down midway by axes—this is the calamity of being useful. Therefore, when exorcists release one from misfortune, they discard the ox with a white forehead, the pig with an upturned snout, and the person with hemorrhoids, deeming them inauspicious and unfit for crossing the river. The exorcists know this well—these are what they consider ill omens. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like person regards as the greatest auspice. Those with usefulness cannot help but cling to it. When exorcists perform their rites, they cast aside these three and meticulously select only the finest sacrificial animals before daring to use them. The exorcists, too, know that the useless remain whole. To preserve life is what the world calls auspicious, yet exorcists deem the useless inauspicious and refuse to use them—yet it is precisely through this inauspiciousness that life is preserved, making it the greatest auspice. The spirit-like person, without intention, follows things as they are. Thus, what the world calls the greatest auspice, the spirit-like person does not oppose.\n\nThere was one called Zhili Shu, whose chin was hidden in his navel, his shoulders higher than his head, his topknot pointing to the sky, his five organs above, his thighs beside his ribs. By mending needles and washing clothes, he earned enough to feed himself; by winnowing and sifting grain, he could feed ten people. When the authorities conscripted soldiers, Zhili waved his arms and wandered among them; when great labor was demanded, Zhili, citing his chronic illness, was exempted from service; when the authorities distributed grain to the sick, he received three bushels and ten bundles of firewood. Though his body was deformed, he could still nourish himself and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is deformed! Relying on his uselessness, he did not hide himself. Exempt from corvée labor, he did not serve; when gifts were given, he accepted them. The spirit-like person is of no use to things, yet things each attain their own use, attributing merit and fame to the multitude of talents, merging with things without a trace. Thus, he avoids the harms of the human world, abides in the substance of constant beauty—this is one whose virtue is deformed.\n\nConfucius traveled to Chu, and the madman Jieyu wandered by his gate, singing:\n*Phoenix! Phoenix!*\n*How has virtue declined?*\nOne should follow the times and move forward, fully attaining the harmony of the moment. The rise and fall of the world are too trivial to notice—hence, \"How has it declined?\" The future cannot be awaited; the past cannot be pursued. One must simply do what is fitting in the present. When the world has the Dao, the sage achieves; when the world lacks the Dao, the sage lives. Entrusting oneself to what is so, principle naturally arises. Arising and achieving are not of my doing—how could one change one’s course for order or chaos? Those who seek order pursue achievement, thus abandoning achievement and not failing; those who face chaos seek life, thus forgetting life and not dying. In the present age, one merely avoids punishment. Without looking ahead or behind, one fully meets the present moment, merging darkly with the times to attain perfect harmony, thus preserving oneself and avoiding the names of punishment.\n\nHappiness is lighter than a feather, yet none know how to bear it. Feet can walk—let them roam; hands can grasp—let them hold. Let the ears hear what they hear, the eyes see what they see; know to stop where knowledge ends, and act only where ability lies. Use what is self-using, do what is self-doing, indulge one’s nature without the slightest concern for what lies beyond—this is the utmost ease of non-action.\"",

      "translated_text": "No one has ever preserved their nature and life through action, nor has anyone whose nature and life were whole not attained good fortune. Thus, good fortune is nothing other than the wholeness of which we spoke earlier—it is not borrowed from external things, so how could it bear the weight of a goose feather? To move in accord with one’s nature, never exceeding its bounds, is the utmost ease in the world. To lift what lifts itself, to bear what bears itself, is the utmost lightness in the world.\n\nYet knowing injures one’s nature by its boundlessness, and the heart disturbs the true by its likes and dislikes. Thus, people abandon this utmost ease of non-action to pursue the utmost difficulty of action, forsaking the utmost lightness of self-lifting to take up the utmost weight of bearing others. This is the common affliction of the world.\n\nDisaster is heavier than the earth, yet none know how to avoid it. If one acts within one’s nature, even bearing ten thousand *jun* brings no sense of weight. If one relies on external things, even a weight no more than a *zhu* may prove unbearable. Acting inwardly is good fortune, and thus good fortune is supremely light. Acting outwardly is disaster, and thus disaster is supremely heavy. That disaster is supremely heavy yet none know how to avoid it—this is the world’s great delusion.\n\nEnough, enough! To govern others with virtue is perilous, perilous! To draw lines on the ground and make others follow them—such traces cannot be concealed. To possess something oneself and then impose it upon things is to fail to merge with them.\n\nThus, the great person does not dazzle others with their own brightness but lets others find their own clarity; they do not impose their virtue upon others but allow others to attain their own virtue. In this way, they pervade and unite the myriad things, darkly merging self and other, indistinctly becoming one with the world, so that inner and outer share the same good fortune.\n\n\"Deluded yang, deluded yang—do not harm my path.\"\n\"Deluded yang\" means lost yang. If one abides in solitude without being swayed by externals, one’s path remains whole.\n\n\"Crooked, crooked—do not harm my feet.\"\nIf one’s conduct is perfectly curved, it is self-sufficient.\n\nMountain trees bring ruin upon themselves; fat is consumed by its own flame. Cinnamon is edible, so it is felled; lacquer is useful, so it is cut. People all know the use of what is useful, but none know the use of what is useless. What is useful serves others’ purposes; what is useless preserves one’s own life. Those who carve their flesh for the world are known to the world. But to allow the people to preserve their wholeness while both self and other find harmony—this is a subtlety so profound that none sense its presence within.\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Zhuangzi, \"Virtue’s Perfect Correspondence\" (Chapter Five):*\n\nIn Lu there was a man named Wang Tai who had lost a foot, yet those who followed him were as numerous as those who followed Confucius.

It is understanding the constancy of nature and fate, taking transformation as fate without opposition, never departing from the ultimate rightness.\n\nChang Ji said, \"What does this mean?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Viewed from what makes them different, the liver and gallbladder are as distant as Chu and Yue. Viewed from what makes them the same, the myriad things are all one. One who is like this does not know what the ears and eyes deem fitting but roams the heart in the harmony of virtue. He sees what things share and does not see what they lose; he regards the loss of a foot as discarding dirt.\"\n\nWhen the nature of pleasure and suffering differs, the feelings of beauty and ugliness diverge. Though what is deemed beautiful varies, all share in having something beautiful. Each deems beautiful what it deems beautiful, so the myriad things are one in beauty. Each affirms what it affirms, so all under heaven is one in affirmation. If one distinguishes things by their differences, then nothing under heaven is not different. Yet one who gazes with vast clarity governs heaven and earth, contains the myriad things, and knows that differences are not truly different. Thus, by following what is shared, nothing under heaven is not the same. Knowing further that sameness is not truly possessed, by following what is without, right and wrong, beauty and ugliness—nothing is not without.\n\nTo affirm oneself and negate others, to find beauty in oneself and ugliness in others—from those of middling understanding down to crawling insects, none are not thus. Yet this is merely clarity about oneself and not clarity about others. As for those of profound penetration and merging, they use all under heaven to illuminate all under heaven. If all under heaven says, 'I am not,' then it illuminates that there is nothing not so. If it says, 'That is right,' then it illuminates that there is nothing right. Without right and without wrong, all blends into one. Thus, one can ride change and follow transformation, oppose things without fear. Having forgotten all that is fitting, nothing is not entrusted. To entrust all and not attain—this has never been. To attain all and not be in harmony—this too has never been heard of. Therefore, the heart is released into the space of the Dao and virtue, drifting without anything amiss, vast and without anything unsuitable.\n\nEmbodying the wondrous heart of the utmost principle, one can be without difference from any thing. Without difference from any thing, then in life and death, change and transformation, there is nowhere that is not oneself. Thus, life is my time, death is my following; time is my gathering, following is my scattering. Though gathering and scattering differ, I am always myself. Thus, life is merely my moment—there has never been gain. Death too is myself—there has never been loss. The change of life and death is but one. Having seen its oneness, one sheds all ties, darkly merging self and other, taking life and death as waking and sleeping, the bodily form as an inn. Departing life is like removing sandals, severing a foot like discarding dirt—I have never seen anything that could entangle his heart.\n\nChang Ji said, \"He cultivates himself. Through his knowledge, he attains his heart; through his heart, he attains his constant heart. What can things do to surpass him?\"",

      "translated_text": "Wang Tai was suspected of not having forgotten knowledge to preserve himself, of not having relinquished the heart to attain self-possession. Yet to attain one’s constant heart is to be level in one’s comings and goings. The suspicion was that he could not remain level in his comings and goings when encountering things, and thus constantly compelled things to come to him.\n\nConfucius said, \"No one mirrors themselves in flowing water, but in still water. Only stillness can still the many that seek stillness. Rooted in earth, only the pine and cypress stand upright, ever green through winter and summer. Rooted in heaven, only Yao and Shun stand upright, at the head of all things. Fortunate to have rectified their lives, they rectify the lives of all. The proof of preserving one’s beginning lies in fearlessness—one brave warrior can charge into nine armies. Those who seek fame and can bind themselves to it are already thus, let alone those who govern heaven and earth, store all things, merely lodge in the six senses, take ears and eyes as mere images, unite knowledge with what is known, and whose hearts have never died! He will choose a day to ascend on high, and people will follow him as a matter of course. How would he deign to make things his concern?\"\n\nThe stillness of water that allows it to serve as a mirror is not stillness sought for the sake of mirroring. Thus, when Wang Tai gathered a following, the people came to him of their own accord—how could he have drawn them to follow him? If he had acted to make it so, he could not have abided in the stillness of all things. The pine and cypress are uniquely endowed with the qi of nature’s harmony, and thus stand as the finest of trees—not because they acted to attain it. Those who uniquely receive the upright qi of nature are exceedingly rare: below, only the pine and cypress; above, only the sages. Thus, all that are not upright come seeking rectification. If all things were whole and green, the pine and cypress would hold no distinction; if all people were self-rectified, none would admire the great sage and hasten to him. Fortunate to be upright of themselves, they do not rectify in order to rectify others. They do not relinquish fame yet bear all things without constraint, darkly embodying all without exception. This is what is meant by \"an inn.\" People use ears and eyes, yet they do not depend on ears and eyes. When knowledge moves with transformation, there is nowhere it does not darkly merge—this is the oneness of knowledge. When the heart flows with life and death, there is no time that is not life—this is the heart that has never died. To choose is merely to avoid losing the meeting; such a person makes no choices, but follows heaven’s course and moves with the times. Thus, those who borrow from him are led to esteem him. His serenity preserves his wholeness.\n\nShentu Jia, a man without feet, studied alongside Zichan of Zheng under Bohun Wuren. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I stay.\" The next day, they again sat together in the same hall. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I go out first, you stay; if you go out first, I stay. Now I am about to go out—can you stay? Or not? Moreover, when you see the one in power, you do not avoid him. Do you consider yourself equal to the one in power?\" He was ashamed to walk alongside one without feet. Pressing the matter, he sought to ensure Shentu Jia would not walk beside him. Always prizing his own position, he bluntly declared Shentu Jia equal to the one in power, as if this alone proved his insolence.\n\nShentu Jia said, \"In the Master’s gate, are there truly those in power like this? You delight in your position and put others after yourself. I have heard: ‘When a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if it settles, it is not bright. Long dwelling with the worthy leaves no faults.’ Now, what you take as greatest is the Master, yet you still speak thus—is this not a fault?\" This was a discussion of virtue, not a calculation of rank. He mocked Zichan’s pride in his position, his desire to precede others. To serve a clear teacher yet retain such a stingy heart—this was the true fault.\n\nZichan said, \"Given your condition, you still contend with Yao in goodness. By your virtue, are you not sufficient to reflect on yourself?\" He meant that with such a maimed form, Shentu Jia did not examine himself but instead slighted those in power, comparing himself to the virtuous. By his virtue, he was not enough to make up for the fault of his maimed form.\n\nShentu Jia said, \"Those who describe their faults, claiming they should not have lost what they lost, are many; those who do not describe their faults, claiming they should not have kept what they kept, are few. Knowing there is nothing to be done and accepting it as fate—only those with virtue can do this. Wandering within Yi’s drawn bow: the center is the mark, yet missing it is fate. Many with whole feet mock my incomplete feet; I bristled with anger, but when I came to the Master’s place, I turned back, at peace. Did the Master wash me with goodness? Or did I awaken myself? I have wandered with you for nineteen years, yet you have never known I was without feet. Now you wander with me within the form, yet seek me outside the form—is this not a fault?\" He often recounted his own faults, claiming many believed he should not have lost what he lost.",

Wherever his bow and arrows reached was called the \"drawn bow’s range.\" When profit and harm contend, the world becomes a field of archers like Yi. Those who do not abandon themselves, forget knowledge, and flow with things—all wander within Yi’s drawn bow. Even if one ventures forth like Zhang Yi or dwells in seclusion like Shan Bao, they cannot escape the mark; whether one hits or misses it depends solely on fate. Yet each clings to their own encounters, unaware that fate unfolds of itself. Thus, those who escape harm from bow and arrow deem themselves skillful, rejoicing in their superiority. But when they cannot escape, they blame their own errors, grieving in spirit and shame—such are those who fail to grasp the nature of fate.\n\nOur lives are not of our own making. Within a single lifetime, across a hundred years, all our sitting and rising, moving and pausing, inclinations and aversions, emotions and abilities—all that we possess, all that we lack, all that we do, all that we encounter—are not truly ours; they arise by principle alone. To impose joy and sorrow upon this is to go against nature and lose the Way. All such mockery stems from ignorance of fate.\n\nSeeing the perfected one’s knowledge of fate and abandonment of form, he cast aside his former anger and returned to equilibrium.

Yet by the natural principle, where there is movement, a shadow follows; where there are words, echoes respond. To comply with things is to establish a name and trace, though one who complies with things does not act for the sake of name. Not acting for the sake of name is perfection, yet one cannot ultimately escape name—who then can free himself from it? Thus, name is the shadow and echo; shadow and echo are the shackles of form and sound. When this principle is understood, name and trace may be discarded. When name and trace may be discarded, attachment to externals may be severed. When attachment to externals may be severed, one’s nature and life may be preserved whole.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, \"In Wei there is an ugly man named Ai Taituo. When men dwell with him, they grow attached and cannot leave; when women see him, they plead with their parents, saying, 'Rather than be another man’s wife, I would be his concubine'—and this has happened more than ten times without cease. He has never been heard to initiate, only to harmonize with others. He holds no lordly position to save others from death, no wealth to fill others’ bellies; moreover, his ugliness startles the world. He harmonizes but does not initiate, his wisdom does not extend beyond his immediate sphere, yet men and women alike flock to him—there must be something extraordinary about him. I summoned him to observe, and indeed, his ugliness startled the world. When he dwelt with me, before a month had passed, I took notice of his character; before a year had elapsed, I trusted him. As the state had no chief minister, I offered him the governance. He responded with reluctance, as if declining; I felt ashamed, yet in the end I entrusted him with the state. Soon after, he left me and departed. I grieved as though I had suffered a loss, as though there were no one left to share the joy of ruling this state. What manner of man is he?\"",

      "translated_text": "Ugliness is but outward deformity. Yet all things flock to him not by force or favor. They come not seeking sustenance, nor drawn by comeliness of form. No summons brings them, no calculation beyond their nature guides them. One whose talents are whole harms nothing in the world: entering the herd, he does not disturb the beasts; joining the flock, he does not scatter the birds. Thus he becomes a refuge for the ten thousand things.\n\nBefore a month had passed, his profound depth was already perceived. Entrusted with the governance of the state, neither favor nor disgrace could unsettle his spirit. When others declined, he too declined.\n\nConfucius said: \"Once, while traveling in Chu, I saw young boars nursing from their dead mother. After a moment’s gaze, they abandoned her and fled. They saw not themselves in her, nor recognized their kind. What they loved in their mother was not her form, but that which animated her form. When warriors fall in battle, their burials are not adorned with military regalia; when a man’s feet are severed, his shoes are no longer cherished. In both cases, the root is lost. The consorts of the Son of Heaven are chosen without cutting their nails or piercing their ears; once wed, they are not sent on further errands. If even bodily wholeness suffices to command such reverence, how much more one whose virtue is whole!\"\n\nNow, Aitai Tu never spoke yet was trusted, achieved nothing yet was cherished, was offered a state yet feared only that he might refuse—surely he is one whose talents are whole and whose virtue remains unmanifest.\"\n\nThey nursed from her milk. The living are drawn to their kind by talent and virtue; when these depart in death, the living flee, having lost their kind. Thus one whose inner power is profound resembles a newborn babe: wherever he goes, all treat him as an infant, and none in the world would harm him. This is because he retains his kind and reveals his true nature. If the heart shares a kindred nature, even dissimilar forms will not provoke hostility; if that nature is lost, even forms as close as mother and child cannot secure the bond.\n\nThat which animates the form is talent and virtue. Military regalia are the trappings of valor; when a warrior dies in battle, valor is gone—where then should regalia be placed? Shoes are cherished for the sake of the feet; when the feet are lost, the shoes are no longer loved. Both lose their root. The Son of Heaven’s consorts remain unaltered in body, and once wed, they are not sent away, for their bodily wholeness is preserved. How much more revered is one whose virtue is whole!\n\nDuke Ai asked: \"What is meant by *talents whole*?\"\nConfucius replied: \"Life and death, survival and ruin, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the workings of fate. They alternate before us day and night, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginnings. Thus they should not disturb inner harmony nor enter the sacred chamber of the mind. Let them flow smoothly without obstruction, never departing from joy. Let day and night be seamless, so that the heart ever abides in springtime, meeting all things with the vitality of the season.

      "translated_text": "The principle is inherently right—it cannot be escaped. Thus, human life is no mistake; what life possesses is no delusion. Though heaven and earth are vast and the myriad things numerous, what I encounter is precisely this—even the gods of heaven and earth, the sages of the state, could not alter it with all their strength and wisdom. Therefore, what one does not encounter cannot be encountered; what one encounters cannot but be encountered. What one does not do cannot be done; what one does cannot but be done. Entrust it to fate, and it will naturally be fitting.\n\nFate moves, affairs change, ceaselessly day and night, pressing forward without retreat, lingering without pause. Thus, one whose talents are whole follows what is encountered and entrusts it to fate. The beginning cannot be fathomed by knowledge, nor can the past be detained by emotion. Therefore, those who understand that fate must unfold and affairs must change—how could they scheme for the end or cling to the new and long for the old? Even with the utmost wisdom, they cannot fathom it. The past has gone—what can I do about it? If one knows that nature and fate are inherently right, then though life and death, poverty and success shift in a thousand transformations, one remains serene and at ease, harmony and principle abiding within.\n\nThe *spirit’s abode* is the dwelling of the essence. The perfectly content do not let cares and troubles disturb their spirit—they pass by like something external. If one’s harmonious nature remains undisturbed and the spirit’s abode is at ease, then though one traverses the greatest changes, one does not lose their joy. Silently, one entrusts all to fate. This is what the myriad beings rely upon, transforming together with the four seasons.\n\n\"What is meant by *virtue not manifest*?\"\n\"The level is the fullness of still water. It can serve as a model: inwardly preserved, outwardly undisturbed. Virtue is the cultivation of perfect harmony. *Virtue not manifest* means things cannot depart from it.\"\n\nThere is no greater levelness in the world than still water. Utterly impartial, it is the standard by which all under heaven aligns. When affairs are accomplished and things are harmonized, this is called *virtue*. When no affair fails to be accomplished and no thing fails to be harmonized, this is *virtue not manifest*. Thus, all under heaven delight in exalting it without tiring.\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Minzi: \"At first, I thought that facing south as ruler of all under heaven, holding the people’s guiding principles and worrying over their deaths, I was supremely enlightened. Now, hearing the words of the perfected person, I fear I lack their substance, have lightly used my person, and lost my state. I and Kong Qiu are not ruler and subject—we are friends in virtue!\"\n\nThose who hear of the wind of *virtue whole*—even Duke Ai—would wish to cast off their bodily form and forget nobility and baseness.\n\nYin Qi, the hunchbacked, lipless man, persuaded Duke Ling of Wei, who was so pleased that he compared whole-bodied men and found their necks too slender. The man with a great goiter persuaded Duke Huan of Qi, who was so pleased that he compared whole-bodied men and found their necks too slender. Thus, virtue has its excellence, and form has what may be forgotten. If one does not forget what should be forgotten but forgets what should not be forgotten, this is called *true forgetting*.\n\nPartial emotion, once set in one direction, makes the ugly seem fine and the fine seem ugly. If one’s virtue excels in following things, things forget their ugliness; if it excels in opposing things, things forget their fineness. Living, they are loved; dead, they are discarded. Thus, virtue is what the world does not forget; form is what principle does not retain. Therefore, to forget form is not true forgetting; to forget virtue while clinging to form—that is *true forgetting*.\n\nThus, the sage wanders freely, yet knowledge becomes a snare, covenants become glue, virtue becomes a bond, craft becomes commerce. The sage does not scheme—what use is knowledge? Does not carve—what use is glue? Has no loss—what use is virtue? Does not trade—what use is commerce? These four are the *heavenly nourishment*. *Heavenly nourishment* is the *heavenly sustenance*. Having received sustenance from heaven, what need is there for man?\n\nOne has the form of a human but not the emotions of a human. Having the form of a human, one mingles with others; lacking human emotions, right and wrong do not adhere to one’s person. How small—this by which one belongs to humanity! How great—this by which one alone completes one’s heaven! Wandering in the realm of self-attainment, released without fail—this is *talents and virtue whole*. These four arise naturally from one another; their principle is already complete. Since it is naturally complete, the sage has no use for their own efforts. Words arise from nature and are endowed by it. Once endowed by nature, its principle is sufficient. Thus, though one may ponder deeply to avoid difficulty or clearly admonish to evade misfortune, nothing happens without reason—all are the convergence of heaven and earth, the direction of the supreme principle. What must be pondered is not my pondering; what must not be pondered is not my not pondering. Some ponder and avoid it; some ponder and do not avoid it; some do not ponder and avoid it; some do not ponder and do not avoid it. All this is not of me—what is there to do? Entrust it, and it comes of itself.\n\nTheir appearance is like that of a human. Like gathers with like, kind separates from kind—this is the Dao of nature. Without emotion, one entrusts all to things. Their appearance is like that of a human. Without emotion, they are vast and unburdened by anything. To be unburdened by anything is what those with emotions cannot achieve—thus, without emotion, one alone completes heaven.\n\nThus, virtue has its excellence, and form has what may be forgotten. If one does not forget what should be forgotten but forgets what should not be forgotten, this is called *true forgetting*.\n\nHuizi said to Zhuangzi: \"Are humans truly without emotion?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"Yes.\"\nHuizi said: \"If a human has no emotion, how can they be called human?\"\nZhuangzi said: \"The Dao gives them their appearance, heaven gives them their form—how can they not be called human?\"\n\nHuman life is not born of emotion.",

Thus, those with emotion strive for detachment and vastness yet cannot achieve it, while detachment and vastness are attained through freedom from emotion.

Is it merely that the worthy and sagely are utterly remote, and detachment and vastness are difficult to emulate? Even the dullest, the deaf, the blind, the crowing of roosters, the barking of dogs—though they may have emotion in their striving, they ultimately cannot succeed. Whether distant or near, even if separated by but a hair’s breadth, in the space between brow and eye, they can never attain it.

For life—does it live itself into being? For completion—does it complete itself into completion? Therefore, one who entrusts all to the natural and arrives at all without exception is a true person. How could they impose fixed intentions upon what they encounter?\n\nThe true persons of old slept without dreaming, woke without worry, ate without relishing flavor, and breathed deeply. The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the breath of ordinary people reaches only the throat. Those who are cramped and submissive choke on their words as if retching. The deeper one’s cravings and desires, the shallower one’s Heavenly mechanism. They harbor no deliberate thoughts, content with whatever they encounter. What is proper to eat is simply eaten—this arises from the root. When qi is not balanced and flowing, one must deeply root and settle to the utmost, only then returning to oneness and desirelessness.\n\nThe true persons of old did not delight in life nor detest death. They did not rejoice at departure nor resist return. They came and went with effortless ease, neither forgetting their origin nor seeking their end. They received and rejoiced in it, forgot and returned to it—this is called not harming the Dao with the heart, not aiding Heaven with human effort. This is the true person, one who embodies transformation. Serene and entrusting all to the natural, they lodge in the utmost principle, thus coming and going without difficulty. Beginning and end, change and transformation—all are forgotten. How could they merely reverse forgetfulness of life while still probing the meaning of death? They do not question what they receive; whatever they encounter, they find it fitting. Their return is not by way of recognition—it is the utmost.\n\nAt birth, humans are tranquil—this is Heaven’s nature. Moved by things, they stir—this is the desire of nature. When the things that move people are endless and human pursuit of desire knows no bounds, then Heavenly principle is extinguished. The true person knows that using the heart turns one from the Dao, and aiding Heaven harms life, so they do not act thus. Such a one’s heart is forgotten, their countenance still, their brow serene.

      "translated_text": "Their brow serene—this is the appearance of great simplicity. To kill is not for the sake of might. Those who embody the Dao and accord with change share the warmth and severity of cold and heat, yet never hold it in mind. Still, they bear the semblance of warmth and severity, the rhythm of life and death, so we ascribe to them joy and anger. Without intent toward things, they do not violate what is fitting for them; with nothing unfitting, none know their limit.\n\nThus the sage in waging war may overthrow a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. Beneficence flows through ten thousand generations, yet not from love of others. One who delights in connecting with things is no sage; one who has favorites is not humane; one who follows the seasons is not worthy; one who does not penetrate benefit and harm is no gentleman; one who acts for fame yet loses the self is no scholar; one who destroys the self yet is not true is no servant of others.\n\nLike those such as Hu Bujie, Wu Guang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di—these serve the service of others, follow the fitting of others, yet do not follow their own fitting. They cause the fall of what the people’s hearts desire to fall, thus they do not lose the people’s hearts. The bright sun ascends the sky, illuminating the six directions—this is not from love of others.\n\nThus the sage abiding in the world is warm as the spring sun’s self-harmony, so those who receive its moisture do not give thanks; chill as the autumn frost’s self-descent, so those who wither do not bear resentment. The sage has no joy—simply nothing obstructs, and things naturally flow. Utmost benevolence has no favorites, entrusting principle to preserve itself. One who follows Heaven’s timing does not compare to one who forgets timing and naturally accords with it. Unable to unify the paths of right and wrong and pursue benefit while avoiding harm, one injures virtue and burdens what is fitting.\n\nA true scholar abandons fame and attains the self, so fame matches reality and fortune responds to the person. Losing one’s nature and forcing compliance with things brings much servitude—how can one serve others? These all abandon the self to imitate others, following them to harm the self.\n\nThe true person of old bore righteousness yet did not form cliques, seemed insufficient yet did not submit; was angular yet not rigid, expansive in emptiness yet not ostentatious; seemed joyful, compelled as if by necessity, rich in bestowing countenance, restraining with virtue, broad as if worldly, towering and uncontrollable, connected as if fond of seclusion, forgetful of words.\n\nTaking punishment as the body, ritual as wings, knowledge as timing, and virtue as the path: taking punishment as the body is the ease of execution; taking ritual as wings is how one moves through the world; taking knowledge as timing is acting only when unavoidable; taking virtue as the path means accompanying those with feet to the hill, yet others truly believe them to be diligent in conduct.\n\nThus what they like is one, what they dislike is one. Their oneness is one, their non-oneness is one. Their oneness joins them with Heaven; their non-oneness joins them with others. Heaven and others do not overcome one another—this is called the true person. They accord with things yet form no factions.\n\nEmpty and without excess, as if insufficient; yielding yet nothing is not elevated, seeming insufficient yet not submitting. They wander alone yet do not cling. Vast and without attachment, they reach fulfillment. The utmost person has no joy, yet flows in harmony, thus seems joyful. In movement and stillness, action and rest, they always dwell in the utmost of necessity, not allowing things to harm the self. They have no direction.\n\nThe utmost person has no harm, moving with the world, thus seems harmful. Lofty and self-content, far-reaching and profound, none see their gate. Unknowing and unperceiving, Heaven’s mechanism moves of itself, thus they are forgetful of words. Ritual is how the world moves itself—it is not of my making. Knowledge is the movement of the times—it is not of my initiation. Virtue is what others follow—it is not of my creation.\n\nEntrusting governance to its natural execution, thus though it kills, it is lenient. Following what the world does, thus nothing is not done. High and low receive one another—this is an irreversible flow; small and great form groups. This is the momentum of necessity. Vast and without emotion, it is the repository of all knowledge.\n\nBearing the convergence of a hundred streams, dwelling at the teacher of people’s utmost—what is there to do? Entrusting to the world’s knowledge, committing to what must be, yielding to the world alone. The hill is the root; speaking of nature, it is nature’s root. Things each have what is sufficient, sufficient in the root. Entrusting to the self-following of all virtues, this accompanies those with feet to the root. When the root is reached, principle is exhausted.\n\nAll this is completed by others, not by oneself. Thus though dwelling at the utmost of ten thousand affairs, one is always at leisure and self-content, suddenly unaware of affairs passing through the body, forgetful of words in the mouth. Yet people’s great delusion is truly believing the utmost person to be diligent in conduct.\n\nAlways without intent and following others, thus liking and disliking, approving and disapproving, are no different from others. Their oneness is Heaven’s companion; their non-oneness is others’ companion. The true person unites Heaven and humanity, equalizes self and other, not allowing their oneness to differ from non-oneness. Having nothing that is not one—this is Heaven. The true person unites Heaven and humanity, levels the myriad outcomes. The myriad outcomes do not oppose one another; Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another. Thus they are vast and without non-oneness, dark and without absence, mysteriously one with others.\n\nDeath and life are fate; their constancy of night and day is Heaven. What humans cannot partake in are all the conditions of things. They take Heaven as father and still love the self—how much more that which transcends!",

      "translated_text": "Man merely takes having a lord as better than himself, yet still dies for him—how much more that which is true! The constancy of day and night is the Dao of Heaven. Thus to know that death and life are the ultimate of fate, not some random occurrence, is like night and day—what is there to cling to? The true person in daytime gains day, in nighttime gains night. Taking death and life as day and night—how could there be anything unattained! That humans have what they cannot attain and harbor sorrow or joy in their hearts is merely the condition of things, not principle. The transcendent is called \"solitary transformation.\" The achievement of mutual dependence is not as great as the perfection of solitary transformation. Thus what humans depend upon is Heaven; what Heaven gives birth to is solitary transformation. All take Heaven as father, so even the changes of day and night, the seasons of cold and heat, they dare not resent, but follow Heaven and find peace in it. How much more the transcendent solitary transformation, reaching the realm of profound darkness—how could one not entrust oneself to it! Having entrusted oneself, then death and life, transformation, only follow fate.\n\nThat which is true borrows nothing from things but is natural. The unavoidability of the natural—how could it be merely the command of a lord! When a spring dries up, fish find themselves together on land, blowing moisture on one another, moistening one another with foam—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, better to forget both and transform through the Dao. Rather than loving one another in insufficiency, how much better to have abundance and forget one another! Praise and blame both arise from insufficiency. Thus the utterly sufficient forgets good and evil, leaves behind death and life, unites with transformation, vast and without obstruction.\n\nHiding a boat in a ravine, hiding a mountain in a marsh—one calls this secure! Yet in the dead of night, a strong man carries it away, and the deluded do not know. Hiding the small and large as is fitting still allows for escape. But to hide the world within the world and find no escape—this is the great truth of things. Merely possessing a human form and still delighting in it—if the human form is but one encounter among ten thousand transformations, never beginning or ending, how could its joy be measured? Thus the sage roams where things cannot escape and all are preserved. Excelling in early death, excelling in old age, excelling in beginning, excelling in end—people still emulate this, how much more that to which the myriad things are tied, that upon which the one transformation depends!\n\nForm, birth, aging, death—all are I. Thus form carries me, birth labors me, aging rests me, death gives me repose. Though these four change, they have never ceased to be I—why should I惜 them? Death and life are both fate. Without goodness, there is death; with goodness, there is life—not goodness alone. If one takes my life as good, then my death is also good. Speaking of the inescapability of death, life, and transformation, one first presents the ultimate of inescapability, then clarifies it with the sign of inevitable change, to entrust oneself to transformation without attachment.\n\nThe power of powerlessness is greatest in transformation. Thus it lifts Heaven and Earth to pursue the new, shoulders mountains and ridges to discard the old. Without the slightest pause, in an instant it has traversed the new—thus Heaven and Earth, the myriad things, have no time when they do not shift. The world is all new, yet one takes it as old; the boat changes daily, yet one sees it as before; the mountain alters daily, yet one sees it as the same. Now one clasps an arm and loses it—all has departed in darkness. Thus the I of a moment ago is no longer the I of now. I and the present both pass away—how could one constantly guard the old! Yet the world does not perceive this, stubbornly claiming that what one encounters now can be tied down and retained—how deluded!\n\nHaving nothing to hide and entrusting all, one is without obstruction in things, without division in transformation. Thus there is no outer, no inner, no death, no life, embodying Heaven and Earth and uniting with transformation—seeking escape yet finding none. This is the great truth of constant existence, not some partial, minor intention. The human form is but one encounter among ten thousand transformations—insufficient to delight in alone. Within the boundless, what one encounters is all like the human form—how could only the human form be delightful while other things have no joy!\n\nThe Dao has essence and trustworthiness, is without action and without form; it can be transmitted but not received, can be attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted, existing before Heaven and Earth, enduring since ancient times. It spiritually empowers ghosts and gods, gives birth to Heaven and Earth. Before the Great Ultimate, it is not high; below the Six Poles, it is not deep. Before Heaven and Earth were born, it was not long-lasting; older than high antiquity, it is not aged. Fu Xi obtained it to grasp Heaven and Earth; Fuxi obtained it to inherit the Mother of Qi; the Northern Dipper obtained it and never errs; the sun and moon obtained it and never cease; Kanpi obtained it to inherit Kunlun; Feng Yi obtained it to roam great rivers; Jian Wu obtained it to dwell in great mountains; the Yellow Emperor obtained it to ascend the cloudy heavens; Zhuan Xu obtained it to dwell in the Dark Palace; Yu Qiang obtained it to stand at the North Pole; the Queen Mother of the West obtained it to sit in Shaoguang, knowing neither beginning nor end; Peng Zu obtained it, reaching from the time of Youyu to the Five Hegemons; Fu Yue obtained it to assist Wu Ding, encompassing the world, riding the Eastern Ridge and the Tail of the Winnowing Basket to join the ranks of the stars.",

      "translated_text": "There exists an emotion beyond emotion, thus the practice of non-action; there is a constancy beyond constancy, thus the absence of form. From antiquity to the present, it has been transmitted and dwelt within, yet none can possess it. All find their own accommodation in it, yet none perceive its form. Illumination requires nothing, for it is not dependent on existence to be non-existent.\n\nHow could the non-existent give birth to the numinous? It does not render ghosts and emperors divine, yet ghosts and emperors become divine of themselves—this is the numinosity of non-numinosity. It does not generate Heaven and Earth, yet Heaven and Earth arise of themselves—this is the generation of non-generation. Thus, the numinosity of the numinous is insufficient to be truly numinous; only in non-numinosity does true numinosity reside. What achievement is there to claim? What endeavor is there to rely upon?\n\nTo speak of the Dao’s omnipresence: when it is on high, it is without height; when it is profound, it is without depth; when it endures, it is without duration; when it ages, it is without aging. It is present everywhere, yet wherever it is present, it is as nothing. Moreover, that which pervades above and below cannot be described in terms of high or low; that which reaches within and without cannot be named as inner or outer; that which moves in unison with transformation cannot be called enduring; that which is eternally without beginning or end cannot be termed old.\n\nThe Dao is without agency. This speaks of attaining it through the Dao, yet it is only to clarify that such attainment is self-attained. Being self-attained, the Dao cannot cause one to attain it; if I have not attained it, I cannot force attainment. Thus, all who attain it do not rely on the Dao externally nor depend on themselves internally—they suddenly attain it of themselves and transform alone.\n\nThe difficulty of life is like this self-transformation and self-attainment. Having attained life, why then fret over whether life is attained and strive for it? Thus, striving for life is insufficient to preserve life fully, for life does not arise from one’s own doing—striving for it only harms one’s true life.\n\nNanbo Zikui asked Nü Yu, “You are advanced in years, yet your complexion is like that of a child.

      "translated_text": "Having heard the Dao, one allows life to arise of itself—thus one’s qi and complexion remain whole.”\n\nNanbo Zikui said, “Can the Dao be learned?”\n“Alas! How could it be? You are not the right person. Now, Pulam Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage, while I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might truly become a sage. If not, even imparting the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. Yet I persisted in instructing him: after three days, he was able to let go of the world; having let go of the world, I persisted further, and after seven days, he was able to let go of things; having let go of things, I persisted again, and after nine days, he was able to let go of life. Only then could he attain clarity at dawn; with clarity at dawn, he could perceive the solitary; perceiving the solitary, he could transcend past and present; transcending past and present, he could enter the realm of neither death nor life. Those who kill life do not die; those who give life to life do not live. As for this state—nothing does it not escort, nothing does it not welcome, nothing does it not destroy, nothing does it not complete. Its name is *yingning* (serene amidst entanglement). *Yingning* is that which is completed through entanglement.”\n\n*Wai* (letting go) means to abandon. Things are what one requires morning and night, difficult to forget due to their immediacy. To abandon them entirely is to let go of life, and thus not to abhor death. Not abhorring death, one finds peace in whatever arises, suddenly free from obstruction, acting in accord with the moment—this is clarity at dawn. Moving in unison with the solitary, one who clings to life thus invites death, and one who abhors death thus invites life. Only by being free from clinging and aversion can one transcend death and life. Allowing things to escort themselves, nothing is not escorted; allowing things to welcome themselves, nothing is not welcomed; allowing things to destroy themselves, nothing is not destroyed; allowing things to complete themselves, nothing is not completed. One who merges with things is entangled by them yet remains undisturbed.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, “From whom did you alone hear this?”\nHe replied, “I heard it from the disciple of *Fumo*, the disciple of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*, the grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*, *Zhanming* heard it from *Nieshu*, *Nieshu* heard it from *Xuyi*, *Xuyi* heard it from *Yu’ou*, *Yu’ou* heard it from *Xuanming*, *Xuanming* heard it from *Canliao*, and *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*.”\n\nIf things entangle yet one alone remains unentangled, one is ruined.",

      "translated_text": "\"Jìn\" means gradual. When the body undergoes transformation and merges with change, there is nowhere it does not follow, and nothing it follows that is impermissible. What one encounters in time, the world calls *gaining*. Time does not pause even briefly; to follow it as it departs, the world calls *losing*. If one cannot release oneself, then the myriad things bind one together. Thus, those who can release themselves are released from all things, while those who cannot are released from nothing.\n\nHeaven cannot be without day and night; how can I be without death and life and resent it? Soon after, Zilai fell ill, gasping as if near death. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zili went to visit him and said: \"Shoo! Away! Do not be startled by transformation!\" Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to him: \"How wondrous is the Creator! What will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you into a mouse’s liver? Will it make you into an insect’s limb?\"\n\nDeath and life are like waking and sleeping. By principle, one ought to sleep, and one does not wish to be startled awake. To transform and die is fitting—there is no cause for alarm. Zilai said: \"For parents and children, east, west, south, or north, one follows their command. Yin and yang are to man no less than parents. If they approach my death and I do not heed them, I would be obstinate—what fault would lie with them? The great clod bears me with form, wearies me with life, eases me with age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.\n\nNow, if a great smith were casting metal, and the metal leapt up, saying, ‘I must become a *Mo Ye* sword!’ the smith would surely deem it inauspicious metal. Now, if one assumes human form and says, ‘I am human! I am human!’ the Creator would surely deem it an inauspicious person. If one takes heaven and earth as a great furnace and the Creator as a great smith, where could one go and not be acceptable?\" He fell asleep peacefully and awoke with a start.\n\nSince ancient times, some have been able to defy their parents’ commands, but none have been able to defy the changes of yin and yang or resist the cycles of day and night. Death and life are like day and night—nothing so distant. When the time for death comes, it is not something to forbid; yet to stubbornly harbor a defiant heart only hastens one’s end by resisting principle. The swiftness of death arises from one’s own obstinacy, not from death itself. *That* refers to death; in life, one thus regards death as *that*. Principle is ever-present in both.\n\n\"I am human! I am human!\"—one only wishes to remain human. It is like the metal leaping up: the world knows such metal is inauspicious, yet cannot allow it to transform of its own accord. The Way of transformation and change encounters nothing it does not meet. Now, if one encounters human form, was it done deliberately? Life is not deliberate; it arises of itself in time. To strive to possess it is delusion!\n\nPeople all know that metal bound by attachments is inauspicious. Thus, if one realizes one’s own nature is no different from metal, the attachments of the heart can be released. If they can be released, there is nothing that cannot be released. Waking and sleeping remain as they are, and one’s heart is not burdened by life and death.\n\nZisang Hu, Mengzi Fan, and Ziqin Zhang spoke among themselves: \"Who can join together without joining, act for one another without acting? Who can ascend to heaven and wander in the mists, roam without limit, forget life, and have no end?\" Those who embody heaven and earth and darkly merge with transformation—though their limbs have different functions and their five organs distinct offices—never join together, yet their hundred joints harmonize as one. This is joining without joining. They never act for one another, yet inner and outer are both fulfilled. This is acting without acting.\n\nIf one were to exert one’s mind to care for one’s limbs, or move one’s thighs and arms to manage one’s organs, the more one strives to nurture them, the more inner and outer become exhausted. Thus, those who take the world as one body have no partiality in their care. They entrust all things without exception. Forgetting life, they forget all things, and thus can follow change and entrust transformation, all without limit.\n\nThe three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in accord. They became friends. Yet was this truly friendship? It was but a lodging of luminous intimacy, free from the nearness of affectionate attachment.",

      "translated_text": "After a while, Zisang Hu died, his body yet unburied. When Confucius heard of it, he sent Zigong to attend to the rites. Some wove funeral garlands, others played the zither, and together they sang in harmony: *\"Alas, Zisang Hu! Alas, Zisang Hu! You have returned to your true nature, while we remain as men!\"* Zigong hastened forward and said, *\"May I ask—is it proper to sing before the dead?\"*\n\nTo weep when others weep is but the trace of custom. To equalize life and death, to forget grief and joy, to sing before the dead—this is the utmost of what lies beyond the world. The two looked at each other and laughed: *\"How could he know the meaning of ritual!\"*\n\nOne who knows the meaning of ritual must wander beyond to order what is within, guard the mother to preserve the child, and follow the truth of feeling without deviation. If one is bound by reputation and constrained by form, then filial piety cannot bear sincerity, kindness cannot bear reality, and father and son, brothers, harbor feelings and deceive one another—how could this be the great meaning of ritual?\n\nZigong returned and told Confucius: *\"What manner of men are they? They cultivate no conduct, yet treat their bodies as external. They sing before the dead without change of countenance—there is no name for them. What manner of men are they?\"*\n\nConfucius said: *\"They wander beyond the world, while I wander within it. Beyond and within do not reach one another, and yet I sent you to offer condolences—how shallow I was! They are now companions of the Creator, roaming in the single qi of heaven and earth. To them, life is but an excrescent growth, a hanging tumor; death is but the bursting of an abscess, the draining of a sore. How could such as they know where life and death, before and after, reside? Borrowing from different things, they lodge in the same body; forgetting their liver and gall, they abandon their ears and eyes. They turn and return, beginning and ending, without knowing where it starts or ends. Vaguely they wander beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action. How could they trouble themselves with the rituals of the vulgar world to impress the eyes and ears of the crowd?\"*\n\nZigong said: *\"Then what Dao do you follow?\"*\n\nThe principle has an ultimate limit, where beyond and within merge. There has never been one who attained the utmost of wandering beyond yet did not merge within, nor one who merged within yet did not wander beyond. Thus, the sage always wanders beyond to merge within, is without mind to follow what is, and so though all day long he appears in form, his spirit and qi remain unchanged. Though he bends and rises with the myriad affairs, he is serene and at ease. To see form yet not reach spirit—this is the common burden of the world.\n\nThus, when one sees him moving with all things, none can say he abandons things and departs from men; when one sees him responding to affairs while embodying transformation, none can say he sits in forgetfulness and attains self-possession. How could it be only the sage who is not thus? It must be said that the ultimate principle has no such thing.\n\nTherefore, Zhuangzi, in clarifying the lineage of the great tradition to awaken the world, did not simply praise Confucius in this way. Had he done so, some might have clung to what they saw and rejected it. Thus, he transcended the sage’s inner traces and lodged the beyond in those few disciples. One should forget what is lodged to seek the great meaning of his composition. Then the Dao of wandering beyond to merge within will be clear and self-evident, and Zhuangzi’s book will indeed be discourse that crosses the vulgar and covers the world.\n\nOffering condolences is a minor affair of the world within; to apply it to the world beyond is shallow. All are merged, thus there is no duality. Like a tumor that hangs of itself, a growth that attaches of itself—this is the temporary gathering of qi, not what one delights in. Like an abscess that bursts of itself, a sore that drains of itself—this is the natural dispersal of qi, not what one regrets. Life and death alternate without end; if one goes along with them, there is nowhere one cannot go. Thus, one does not know where victory or defeat lies.\n\n*\"Assuming\"* means *\"relying on.\"* Now life and death, gathering and dispersal, change without pattern—all are different things. There is nothing different that is not relied upon, so though what is relied upon differs, all together form one body. If even the five organs are forgotten, what thing is worth recognizing? Without recognition from the start, one can freely follow the path of transformation, darkly merge with the waves of turning and returning, and not know where beginning and end reach their limit.\n\nThis is called *\"wandering in principle and merging with what is beyond.\"* The *\"work of non-action\"* is not mere folded hands and silence; *\"beyond the dust and grime\"* is not hiding in the mountains and forests. What they show to the crowd is but the dust and grime—it is not the dark merging of what lies beyond.\n\nZigong had not heard of *\"nature and the Dao of heaven,\"* so he saw what they relied upon but not what they relied upon *for.* What they relied upon *for* is not reliance—how could the world be aware of it?\n\nConfucius said: *\"I, Qiu, am one punished by heaven. Nevertheless, I share this with you.\"*",
      "overlap_context": " them, the more inner and outer become exhausted. Thus, those who take the world as one body have no partiality in their care. They entrust all things without exception. Forgetting life, they forget all things, and thus can follow change and entrust transformation, all without limit.\n\nThe three looked at one another and laughed, their hearts in accord. They became friends. Yet was this truly friendship? It was but a lodging of luminous intimacy, free from the nearness of affectionate attachment.",

      "translated_text": "In Lu, they observed his ritual conduct, while Yan Hui examined his heart. Confucius said: *\"Mengsun Cai has exhausted it—he has advanced beyond knowledge. Though he sought simplicity, he could not attain it, for he had already attained a kind of simplicity. Mengsun Cai knows not why he lives, nor why he dies. He knows not whether to follow what comes first or what comes after. If he is transformed into a thing, he awaits the transformations he does not yet know. Moreover, as he is in the midst of transformation, how could he know what is not yet transformed? As he is in the midst of non-transformation, how could he know what has already transformed? You and I are but dreamers who have not yet awakened!\n\nYet he may take on startled forms without harming his heart, dwell in new abodes without depleting his essence. Mengsun Cai alone is awake—others weep, and so he weeps, for that is simply what he must do. Moreover, we merely share the same ears—how do we know that what I call 'I' is not truly 'I'? You may dream of being a bird soaring through the heavens, or a fish diving into the depths. Who can say whether the speaker now is awake or dreaming? One reaches contentment before laughter arises; one offers laughter before arranging it. Resting in arrangement, one moves with transformation and enters the vast oneness of Heaven.\"*\n\nOne who fully grasps the principle of life and death, responding fittingly to both inner and outer, moves in accordance with Heaven’s course—this is no match for knowledge. To select between life and death yet find no difference is like the progression of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. Having made a selection yet found nothing, one is at ease in all things. Being at ease in all things, one does not weigh life and death in the mind but entrusts them to spontaneous transformation. Wherever one encounters, one is content. One does not resist transformation.\n\nLife and death are but twists in the same flow, merging with transformation. One forgets what one knows in the present—how could one fret over what one does not yet know? Having transformed and come to life, how could one know the time before birth? Not yet transformed and facing death, how could one know what comes after? Thus, there is nothing to avoid or pursue—one simply moves with transformation. Life and death are but waking and dreaming. If in a dream one believes oneself awake, there is no way to prove that waking is not a dream. If one cannot prove that waking is not a dream, then one cannot prove that life is not death.\n\nLife and death, waking and dreaming—where do they reside? In whatever one encounters, one finds contentment. Why grieve over this while worrying about that? Transformation startles the form, but it does not burden the heart. The changes of the bodily frame are but daily renovations of one’s dwelling—one’s nature does not take them as death. The one who is always awake meets no resistance in any direction, so when others weep, he weeps, for that is simply what is fitting.\n\nLife, death, and transformation—all are mine. Since all are mine, what have I lost? Never having lost myself, what cause for sorrow? Without resistance, when others weep, he weeps. Without sorrow, though he weeps, he is not grieved. Nothing is not mine, so he harmonizes inner and outer, pervades past and present, and renews daily with transformation—how could he know where his true self resides? This means there is nowhere one does not find contentment.\n\nWhen dreaming, one believes oneself awake—how then can one know that the present is not a dream? How can one know it is not waking? The transformations of waking and dreaming extend everywhere without hindrance, so the changes of life and death are never worth lamenting. Wherever one arrives is fitting, so one forgets fitting—thus, laughter does not arise. *Pai* means to shift or move. In ritual, weeping must express sorrow, and laughter must express joy. If sorrow and joy linger in the heart, one cannot move with what is fitting.\n\nBut Mengsun is always at ease, so though he weeps, he is not grieved, and he moves with transformation. At peace with shifting, he moves with transformation and thus enters the silence to become one with Heaven. From this point up to Zisi, their attainment is the same. Their approaches to mourning differ, so their songs and weeping vary.\n\nYi’erzi went to see Xu You. Xu You asked: *\"How has Yao aided you?\"* *Zi* here means to supply or assist. Yi’erzi replied: *\"Yao told me: 'You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness and clearly distinguish right from wrong.'\" Xu You said: *\"Then why have you come here? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you wander the boundless, carefree, and ever-shifting paths?\"*",

      "translated_text": "\"Humanity indeed!\"—yet his voice could not bear the strain, so he hastened to recite his verse.\n\nZiyu entered and asked: \"Why do you sing this poem in such a manner?\"\n\nThese two were such that they acted for one another without acting for one another. Now, wrapping rice to feed him was but following Heaven’s principle and acting spontaneously—it was not that he went because of acting for him. To suspect the presence of emotion is to rush forth and depart far from the principle.\n\nHe said: \"I ponder what has brought me to this extremity, yet I cannot find it. Would my parents wish me to be poor? Heaven covers all without partiality; Earth bears all without partiality—would Heaven and Earth single me out for poverty? I seek what has caused this, yet I cannot find it! Yet to have reached this extremity is fate indeed!\"\n\nAll things are thus of themselves; there is no doer behind them.\n\n---\n\n*From the \"Inner Chapters\" of the Zhuangzi, \"The Equalizing Lord of the World\" (Chapter Seven):*\n\nNie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Thereupon Nie Que leapt with great joy and went to tell Master Pu Yi.\n\nMaster Pu Yi said: \"Have you only now come to know this? The Lord of Yu did not attain to the level of the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu concealed benevolence to entice men—thus he gained men, yet never emerged from the realm of the unnatural. The Lord of Tai slept in tranquil ease and awoke in leisurely fashion. At times he took himself for a horse, at times for an ox. His knowledge was true and his virtue most genuine, yet he never entered the realm of the unnatural.\"\n\nOne who is without intent and follows spontaneous transformation is fit to be an emperor-king. The Lord of Yu and the Lord of Tai were but traces of worldly affairs, not that by which traces are made. That by which traces are made is traceless—who in the world could name it? Never having been named, what victory or defeat could there be? Yet the traceless one rides the myriad changes, treading through ten thousand ages. The world has its level plains and perilous passes, thus traces sometimes fall short.\n\nOne who takes what he likes as the \"right\" person and what he dislikes as the \"wrong\" person is confined within the bounds of right and wrong. One who can emerge from the realm of the unnatural must enter the realm where there is no unnatural. Thus there is no gain, no loss, no right, no wrong—how could it be merely concealing benevolence to entice men? Being thus, what right or wrong persons could there be? This may be called emerging from the realm of the unnatural.\n\nFollowing one’s own knowledge, thus emotions are true. Following one’s own attainment, thus there is no falsity. Not entering the realm of right and wrong is how one cuts off from the age of the Lord of Yu.\n\n---\n\nJian Wu met Jie Yu the Madman.\n\nJie Yu asked: \"What did Zhong Shi tell you at noon?\"\n\nJian Wu replied: \"He told me that a ruler of men must issue laws, standards, principles, and measures from himself—who would dare not listen and be transformed?\"\n\nJie Yu said: \"This is deceptive virtue. In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea to dig a river or making a mosquito carry a mountain. Does the sage govern externally? He rectifies himself and then acts, ensuring only that he is capable of his task. Moreover, birds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and nets; the field mouse burrows deep beneath the sacred mound to escape the peril of fumigation and digging—yet do these two creatures lack knowledge?\"\n\nTo impose one’s self upon things is to cause things to lose their truth.",

      "translated_text": "To entrust all to the myriad things is to accomplish without action; to impose one’s self upon the world is to leave no task complete and no burden borne. Preserve only what lies within one’s nature and allotted span. Each rectifies its own nature and destiny. Do not attempt what one cannot. Even birds and beasts each have their means of self-preservation—thus when emperors and kings leave them to their own, they fulfill themselves. Have you truly not known that these two creatures each preserve themselves without need of instruction?\n\nTian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and arrived at the banks of Liao River, where he encountered the Nameless Man and asked: “I beg to ask how to govern the world.” The Nameless Man replied: “Away! You are a vulgar man—why do you ask so unpleasantly? I am about to become human with the Creator of Things. When weary, I shall ride the boundless bird to soar beyond the six directions and wander the land of Nothing Whatever, dwelling in the vast wilderness. Why trouble my heart with your questions of governing the world?”\n\nTo ask how to govern the world is not to rise from the Great Beginning nor to rest in the Dark and Obscure. Let people act of themselves. \"Boundless\" means the myriad fragments. Riding the myriad fragments, driving the ten thousand things, one moves freely without constraint or obstruction. To release all into the realm of self-attainment is to govern without governing.\n\nHe asked the Nameless Man again: “If you let your mind wander in simplicity, harmonize your qi with stillness, follow things as they are without private intent, then the world will be governed.” To follow one’s nature without adornment is simplicity. To rest in stillness within one’s nature is stillness. To let nature arise of itself is impartiality; to seek to augment it with the heart’s desires is partiality. Partiality cannot sustain life, but following impartiality preserves it wholly.\n\nYang Ziju saw Lao Dan and said: “Suppose there were a man swift, strong, and resolute, with penetrating insight and clear understanding, who studies the Dao without weariness—could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?” Lao Dan replied: “In the eyes of the sage, such a man is like a clerk or artisan, bound by skill and toil, exhausting his body and startling his mind. Moreover, the patterns of tigers and leopards invite hunting; the agility of apes and monkeys invites capture. Could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?”\n\nYang Ziju, disconcerted, said: “I venture to ask about the governance of an enlightened king.” Lao Dan said: “Such skill leaves no room for the self—how could it compare to a sage-king? The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name is raised, and things delight of themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders where there is nothing.”\n\nIf the world had no enlightened king, none could attain self-fulfillment. That they do so is truly the king’s achievement—yet his achievement lies in non-action and entrusting the world to itself. When all in the world act of themselves, it seems not the king’s doing. The enlightened king fully meets the nature of things, so each person says, “I am thus of myself,” without knowing their reliance on him. Though his achievements cover the world, he does not claim them as his name, so all things believe they have attained of themselves and rejoice. He dwells in the path of transformation, daily renewed without fixed form. Identifying with the ten thousand things, he wanders in emptiness. If one cannot merge with things, one is ever at odds with them—how could one wander in emptiness?\n\nIn Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew men’s deaths and lives, survival and ruin, fortune and misfortune, long life and early death, predicting the year, month, ten-day period, or day as if by spirit. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled. Liezi saw him and was enchanted. Returning, he told Huzhi: “At first I thought your Dao was supreme, but now there is something even greater.” He did not delight in hearing his own death day.",

The perfected person moves like heaven, rests like earth, flows like water, and abides in profound stillness. Profound stillness and flowing water, heavenly motion and earthly rest—though they seem not to act, they are spontaneously so, and in this they are one.\n\nNow, when Ji Xian saw him dwelling like a corpse and sitting in oblivion, he declared him near death; when he glimpsed his spirit stirring and heaven following, he took it for signs of life. Truly, if one responds without engaging the heart-mind, the pattern naturally aligns with the mysterious tally; if one ascends and descends with transformations, taking the world as measure, then one becomes master of things, following the timeless without limit—thus beyond the diviner’s reckoning.

When one entrusts oneself to natural covering and bearing, the heavenly mechanism mysteriously responds, and the adornments of fame and profit all become discarded things. The mechanism always arises from the utmost height. When it activates and excels in the other, the other perceives it.\n\nThe next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huzhi again.

For three years he did not venture out, cooked for his wife, and fed pigs as he would feed people, showing no partiality in his dealings. Carved and polished, he returned to simplicity, standing alone as a mere clod of earth. Though the world swirled in chaos, he remained thus to the end. He forgot distinctions of noble and base, attending only to what he encountered. He shed ornament for substance, casting off external embellishments. Though he moved, his true nature never scattered.\n\nLet things each fulfill their own ends. Be not the host of fame, the storehouse of schemes, the bearer of tasks, or the master of knowledge. Embody the boundless and wander without trace. Exhaust what you receive from Heaven, yet perceive no gain—be empty, and nothing more!\n\nThe perfected person’s mind works like a mirror: it neither sends forth nor greets, responds yet does not store, and thus can master things without harm. Accord with things, and each will naturally fit its name. Let things each devise their own plans, entrust tasks to each as they are suited, and without intent, let each direct its own knowledge.\n\nFollow the world’s spontaneous self-governing, and you may gallop through the ten thousand things without exhaustion. Entrust yourself to things, and you leave no trace. When you are content, you stop. To perceive gain is to know no stopping. Without emptiness, one cannot bear the weight of all realities.\n\nMirror things without emotion. When they come, respond; when they depart, cease. Things arrive, and one reflects them—reflecting not with the mind, thus though the world be vast, there is no burden of wearying the spirit.\n\nThe Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Central Realm was Hundun. Shu and Hu would often meet in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them exceedingly well. Shu and Hu plotted to repay Hundun’s virtue, saying: “All people have seven apertures for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try to bore them for him.” Each day they bored one aperture, and on the seventh day, Hundun died. Those who act ruin things.",

Huzhi said: “Pursue him!” Liezi chased after him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Huzhi: “He has vanished, he is gone—I could not reach him.”\n\nHuzhi said: “Earlier, I showed him what has never yet departed from my source. I met him with emptiness and followed his winding path, so he knew not who or what I was. Taking me for drifting grass, taking me for flowing waves, he fled.”",
