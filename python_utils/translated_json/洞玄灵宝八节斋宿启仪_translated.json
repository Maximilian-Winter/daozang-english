The officials of the Three Realms array themselves to left and right,\ntheir majestic deportment solemn and reverent, without slackness or negligence.\n\n**At Midday, Practicing the Dao**\nVisualize the qi of vermilion clouds.\nCrimson phoenixes and vermilion birds stand guard before and behind, suffusing the fasting chamber.\n\n**At Sunset, Practicing the Dao**\nVisualize the qi of white clouds suffusing the fasting hall.\nQilin, lions, and white tigers stand guard over the four directions.\nJade Lads and Jade Maidens are present as in the method for dawn.\n\nFurther, with eyes closed, inwardly visualize the Five Marchmounts, the Five Immortals, and the Five Thearchs standing guard within the body.\nA golden radiance envelops the entire form, the body assuming a golden hue.\nIt emerges from behind the lungs, and a circular halo appears upon the neck, like the image of the sun.\nLet it illuminate the ten directions, so that the body’s interior is fully revealed, both within and without—\nthis is the same for all six periods.\n\nSound the Dharma drum twenty-four times.\n\nThe Most High Three Heavens’ Primordial Origin, the Three Qi of the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, summon forth from within us, your servants, the Three and Five Merit Officers, the Left and Right Attendants, the Left and Right Incense-Bearing Courier Dragon Riders, the Incense-Attending Golden Lads, the Message-Transmitting Jade Maidens, the Five Thearchs’ Direct Talismans, and the Direct-Day Incense Officials—thirty-six of each. Command the local earth deities and territorial true officials to swiftly prepare and present themselves. We now, in this very moment of burning incense, act on behalf of the disciples of the Great Dao, observing the rites of this sacred season, conducting the wondrous fast of the Numinous Treasure’s nocturnal invocation—a day and a night of thrice practicing the Dao, thrice reciting the scriptures. May we receive the descending flow of the Ten Directions’ Upright and True Life Qi of the Most High, infusing our bodies. Let our supplications swiftly ascend to the presence of the Most High, the Boundless, the Great Dao’s Perfect and True Kingly Emperor. Each proclaims their name and rank: Disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Purity, performing the rites of the Numinous Treasure’s nocturnal invocation.\n\nWe, your servants, humbly and sincerely invoke the Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Spontaneous, the Boundless Great Dao’s Supreme Dao Lord, the Supreme Venerable Lord Lao, the August Jade Emperor on High, the Ten Directions’ Great Sage Assemblies who have attained the Dao, the Perfect and True Lords and Elders, the Thirty-Two Heavenly Emperors, the Jade Void Emperor, the Great Emperor of the Jade Capital, the Eastern Florescence, Southern Culmen, Western Numinosity, Northern Perfection, the Golden Towers and Jeweled Terraces of the Mysterious Capital, the Purple Tenuity’s Upper Palace, the Numinous Treasure’s Perfect and Illuminated August Dao Lord, the Great Dharma Masters of the Mysterious Center, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all divine beings. We, your servants, respectfully lead and accompany the disciples of the Great Dao in observing the rites of this sacred season’s Numinous Treasure nocturnal invocation. Tonight, we lodge our invocation in the Dharma hall, ascending our memorials to the perfected, opening the deliverance of the fast’s sponsor, their nine generations of ancestors, seven lineages of forebears, and departed kin. We supplicate on behalf of the Emperor, the grand ministers and aides, the governors of lands and prefectures, the magistrates of counties, then for the scripture-transmitting preceptors, and further for reclusive scholars of aspiration, fellow learners, the nine relations of kin, all people under heaven, the flying and creeping, the crawling and gasping—all sentient beings.\n\nNow, we burn incense, surrendering body, spirit, and life to the Boundless Most High, the Ten Directions’ Numinous Treasure, the Spontaneous and Perfect, the Supreme Great Dao. We beseech forgiveness for the fast’s sponsor—sins and transgressions from past lives, former existences, and this life’s mortal coil—delivering them from the Three Evil Paths, the Ten Sufferings, Eight Hardships, and Nine Calamities, turning misfortune to fortune, swiftly ascending to the celestial halls. May their household and kin, young and old, male and female, all attain blessings and felicity, their lifespans boundless. May we, your servants, attain the perfection of the Dao, soaring through the void, ascending to heaven in broad daylight, attending the Dao Lord, roaming freely in the Supreme Golden Towers and Jeweled Terraces of the Spontaneous Palace, forever merging with the Dao. May our supplications, wondrously responsive, ascend swiftly to the presence of the Perfect and Boundless Dao.\n\n**Homage to the Ten Directions**\n**Repentance**\nWe, your servants, wholeheartedly surrender our lives to the Ten Directions’ Boundless Great Dao and the Supreme Numinous Treasure Heavenly Worthy. We act on behalf of the fast’s sponsor and disciples, both living and deceased, and their nine lineages of kin. We reflect that, by nature, they may have been dull-witted, their conduct straying from the true Dao. Perhaps they harmed living beings, transgressing heaven’s constant principles. In all their words and deeds, they knew not what to avoid or shun. Their hidden sins and manifest transgressions are measureless and boundless. Now, as we burn incense and practice the Dao, may they all be cleansed. May misfortune turn to fortune, and all their wishes be fulfilled. We pray that the Dharma rites flow unimpeded, free from any rebuke or rejection. May their repentance and gratitude be met with wondrous response. Bowing in reverence, we rely upon the True Three Treasures.\n\n**Homage to the Scriptures**\n**Three Prostrations**\n\n**Reaffirming Names and Titles**\n\nThe disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Purity, conducting the wondrous fast of the Lingbao tradition’s ancient invocation, humbly reaffirm their address to the Boundless and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Natural, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Ten Directions’ Lingbao Heavenly Worthies, the perfected and great sagely hosts, the perfected lords and venerable masters, the Heavenly Master and Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the supreme ministers and prime officials, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all divine spirits.\n\nWe, who have planted karmic seeds across kalpas and drifted through a thousand rebirths in the mundane world, have been blessed to hear the mysterious teachings and awaken to the source of transformation. The golden scriptures of the Three Caverns reveal profound wonders; the five thousand characters of the profound canon lie open before us, their subtleties beyond perception. Yet our roots are shallow and our wisdom frail. We cannot abandon form to wander alone, nor conceal ourselves forever in mountain fastnesses. Relying on small acts of goodness as merit, we dare to hope for deliverance.\n\nAll matters of devotion must be duly presented. As the liturgy declares, our sincerity burns with utmost earnestness. Relying upon the great Dao, we pray for the deliverance of the living and the dead. Together, we purify our thoughts and cleanse our hearts. For this observance of [specific fast], we conduct the wondrous fast of the Lingbao tradition, practicing the Dao in three periods by day and three by night, reciting the scriptures in three periods. We emulate heaven and earth, holding candles and burning incense. Our devotion, like the dew at dawn, is earnest and sincere, hoping for communion and response.\n\nWe implore the Three Supreme Worthies, the Ten Directions’ sagely hosts, and the Dharma Master overseeing the fast to deign to witness and reflect upon our supplications. We beseech the issuance of decrees to the officials of the Lingbao realm and the local earth deities, that they unite in purpose and strength to guard the fast, purify its inner and outer domains, and eradicate the thieves of deluded thought. May we find peace of mind and stability of spirit, summoning the true and invoking the numinous. May the fast’s merit be fulfilled without hindrance.\n\nIn reverent accordance with the fast’s rites, we proclaim the precepts and their solemn observances, that all participants may submit to the Dharma’s discipline. At dawn, we will resume the practice, continuing our address. Standing level and facing east, we recite the *Hymn of Wisdom*. Turning north, we prostrate ourselves fully, repenting and bowing to the Ten Directions. The assembled officials face east, while the Dharma Master faces west to proclaim the precepts. The rites proceed as prescribed.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Dao Lord, saying: “Now is the time to proclaim the Dharma’s voice universally, to deliver all sentient beings. For all men and women, dispel calamities and avert misfortune. Invoke blessings, deliver lives, and uproot the roots of suffering. Let the living behold the Dao and escape the eight difficulties; let the dead rejoice and feast in the heavens. May they soon be reborn among men as Wheel-Turning Sage Kings. In conducting fasts and practicing the Dao, all must be of one mind. Receive the Ten Precepts with care, and do not forget them. Focus your thoughts in silent contemplation, and meditate deeply upon the natural. Do not allow stray thoughts to disturb body and spirit. Those who can do so shall listen in stillness.\n\nThe First Precept: Let the heart be free of malice and envy, and harbor no hidden thieves. Guard your speech, be circumspect in conduct, and let your thoughts dwell upon the Dharma.\n\nThe Second Precept: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing. Cherish all living beings, extend compassionate aid, and benefit all.\n\nThe Third Precept: Uphold chastity and yield to righteousness. Do not indulge in lust or theft. Always act with good intentions, sacrificing for others.\n\nThe Fourth Precept: Be free of sensuality and desire, and let the heart not wander. Maintain purity and caution, and let your conduct be unstained.\n\nThe Fifth Precept: Let your speech be free of malice, and avoid ornate or deceitful words. Be loyal and upright within and without, and commit no transgressions of speech.\n\nThe Sixth Precept: Abstain from alcohol and regulate your conduct. Harmonize your qi and nature, that the spirit not be harmed, and avoid all evils.\n\nThe Seventh Precept: Do not envy those who surpass you, nor contend for fame or merit. In all matters, yield and defer, and withdraw to aid others.\n\nThe Eighth Precept: Do not criticize the scriptures and teachings, nor slander the sacred texts. Keep your heart as pure as ice, ever as if in the presence of the divine.\n\nThe Ninth Precept: Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor judge or gossip about others. Such actions invite the censure of heaven and men, and harm the spirit and qi.\n\nThe Tenth Precept: In all actions and undertakings, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness. Let harmony prevail among people, and reverence among spirits, that your conduct may always be thus.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: To observe the Ten Precepts is to align with the heart of heaven. Always practice great compassion, and vow to act for the sake of all. Universally deliver those in peril, humbly honor the teachings, and never grow lax. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil. Those who do not retreat may attain deliverance from the five paths, avoid the three evils, be protected by all heavens, and revered by all spirits. By maintaining the fast and upholding the precepts, one may attain deliverance in this very life.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: The Dao is noble, the Dharma wondrous, and the human body is also precious. Thus the Dao opens the Dharma, bequeathing precepts and scriptures to deliver humanity. Once the human body is delivered, it ascends to become one with the Dao. Therefore, cultivate purity, maintain the fast, and uphold the precepts. Calm the heart and quiet the mind, with clear resolve and focused intention. Direct your thoughts single-mindedly, purifying the six repositories, and do not transgress the mean. Let inner and outer be clear and empty, ever in accord with the natural.\n\nOn the day of the fast, hold incense and make vows, that your prayers may ascend. The patrolling officers of the Four Heavens and the mighty spirits of the Ten Divisions shall descend to witness your practice, observe the recitation of the Dharma, and reflect upon your heart. Those who uphold the precepts and practice the Dao shall have their merits recorded in the heavens. Fortune and misfortune will manifest swiftly, for the Dao does not fail those who strive. Receive the precepts earnestly, and do not heed demonic words.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: When establishing a fast and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Kings arrive in flying clouds and jade chariots of eight luminaries, accompanied by perfected ones and jade maidens holding floral banners. Phoenixes sing before them, and celestial music follows. White cranes and lions roar and chant in harmony. Burning incense and scattering flowers, they float through the air to witness the practice and hear the Dharma’s voice. The Heavenly Kings descend, and the myriad spirits pay homage. How can one not fulfill the Dharma to its utmost?\n\nFirst receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Walk with measured grace, calm the heart, and close the mind. In sitting, rising, lying, and resting, never depart from proper form. The heavens rejoice, and your name is inscribed in the registers of Supreme Purity. This may be called attaining the Dao within the space of a square inch.”\n\nThen at the incense burner, the Fragrant Sound Messengers, the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger Lords, and the attendant spirit-officials of incense shall cause the place of fasting to naturally produce golden liquid, cinnabar, and azure mushroom blossoms. The hundred numinous spirits and perfected ones gather together before this incense-and-lamp altar. May the family of the fasting practitioner enjoy health and peace, with years and lifespan prolonged. May the departed ancestors of old attain deliverance and ascension. May all living beings together partake in felicity and celebration. May they receive protection through the seasons, and may the world be graced with Heaven’s favor.\n\nThe jade maidens and immortal youths of the ten directions shall attend the incense smoke, transmitting the supplications just now offered directly to the Jade Emperor’s imperial presence.\n\nRecite the *Eulogy for Upholding the Precepts* and the *Primary School of Immortals’ Praise*. Turn and offer the *Eulogy of Dedication* before the Mysterious Master. Scatter flowers as in the usual rite.\n\nThus concludes the *Rite of Petition for the Eight-Festival Fasts of the Cavernous Mystery Numinous Treasure*.",

      "translated_text": "**Reaffirming Names and Titles**\n\nThe disciples of the Three Luminaries of the Great Cavern of the Mysterious Capital of Supreme Purity, conducting the wondrous fast of the Lingbao tradition’s ancient invocation, humbly reaffirm their address to the Boundless and Spontaneous Primordial Heavenly Worthy of the Void and the Natural, the Most High Dao Lord, the Most High Lord Lao, the Supreme Mysterious Elder, the Ten Directions’ Lingbao Heavenly Worthies, the perfected and great sagely hosts, the perfected lords and venerable masters, the Heavenly Master and Great Dharma Master of the Mysterious Center, the supreme ministers and prime officials, the officials and attendants of the Three Realms, and all divine spirits.\n\nWe, who have planted karmic seeds across kalpas and drifted through a thousand rebirths in the mundane world, have been blessed to hear the mysterious teachings and awaken to the source of transformation. The golden scriptures of the Three Caverns reveal profound wonders; the five thousand characters of the profound canon lie open before us, their subtleties beyond perception. Yet our roots are shallow and our wisdom frail. We cannot abandon form to wander alone, nor conceal ourselves forever in mountain fastnesses. Relying on small acts of goodness as merit, we dare to hope for deliverance.\n\nAll matters of devotion must be duly presented. As the liturgy declares, our sincerity burns with utmost earnestness. Relying upon the great Dao, we pray for the deliverance of the living and the dead. Together, we purify our thoughts and cleanse our hearts. For this observance of [specific fast], we conduct the wondrous fast of the Lingbao tradition, practicing the Dao in three periods by day and three by night, reciting the scriptures in three periods. We emulate heaven and earth, holding candles and burning incense. Our devotion, like the dew at dawn, is earnest and sincere, hoping for communion and response.\n\nWe implore the Three Supreme Worthies, the Ten Directions’ sagely hosts, and the Dharma Master overseeing the fast to deign to witness and reflect upon our supplications. We beseech the issuance of decrees to the officials of the Lingbao realm and the local earth deities, that they unite in purpose and strength to guard the fast, purify its inner and outer domains, and eradicate the thieves of deluded thought. May we find peace of mind and stability of spirit, summoning the true and invoking the numinous. May the fast’s merit be fulfilled without hindrance.\n\nIn reverent accordance with the fast’s rites, we proclaim the precepts and their solemn observances, that all participants may submit to the Dharma’s discipline. At dawn, we will resume the practice, continuing our address. Standing level and facing east, we recite the *Hymn of Wisdom*. Turning north, we prostrate ourselves fully, repenting and bowing to the Ten Directions. The assembled officials face east, while the Dharma Master faces west to proclaim the precepts. The rites proceed as prescribed.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy addressed the Most High Dao Lord, saying: “Now is the time to proclaim the Dharma’s voice universally, to deliver all sentient beings. For all men and women, dispel calamities and avert misfortune. Invoke blessings, deliver lives, and uproot the roots of suffering. Let the living behold the Dao and escape the eight difficulties; let the dead rejoice and feast in the heavens. May they soon be reborn among men as Wheel-Turning Sage Kings. In conducting fasts and practicing the Dao, all must be of one mind. Receive the Ten Precepts with care, and do not forget them. Focus your thoughts in silent contemplation, and meditate deeply upon the natural. Do not allow stray thoughts to disturb body and spirit. Those who can do so shall listen in stillness.\n\nThe First Precept: Let the heart be free of malice and envy, and harbor no hidden thieves. Guard your speech, be circumspect in conduct, and let your thoughts dwell upon the Dharma.\n\nThe Second Precept: Uphold benevolence and refrain from killing. Cherish all living beings, extend compassionate aid, and benefit all.\n\nThe Third Precept: Uphold chastity and yield to righteousness. Do not indulge in lust or theft. Always act with good intentions, sacrificing for others.\n\nThe Fourth Precept: Be free of sensuality and desire, and let the heart not wander. Maintain purity and caution, and let your conduct be unstained.\n\nThe Fifth Precept: Let your speech be free of malice, and avoid ornate or deceitful words. Be loyal and upright within and without, and commit no transgressions of speech.\n\nThe Sixth Precept: Abstain from alcohol and regulate your conduct. Harmonize your qi and nature, that the spirit not be harmed, and avoid all evils.\n\nThe Seventh Precept: Do not envy those who surpass you, nor contend for fame or merit. In all matters, yield and defer, and withdraw to aid others.\n\nThe Eighth Precept: Do not criticize the scriptures and teachings, nor slander the sacred texts. Keep your heart as pure as ice, ever as if in the presence of the divine.\n\nThe Ninth Precept: Do not engage in quarrels or disputes, nor judge or gossip about others. Such actions invite the censure of heaven and men, and harm the spirit and qi.\n\nThe Tenth Precept: In all actions and undertakings, maintain equanimity and single-mindedness. Let harmony prevail among people, and reverence among spirits, that your conduct may always be thus.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: To observe the Ten Precepts is to align with the heart of heaven. Always practice great compassion, and vow to act for the sake of all. Universally deliver those in peril, humbly honor the teachings, and never grow lax. Better to die upholding goodness than to live in evil. Those who do not retreat may attain deliverance from the five paths, avoid the three evils, be protected by all heavens, and revered by all spirits. By maintaining the fast and upholding the precepts, one may attain deliverance in this very life.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: The Dao is noble, the Dharma wondrous, and the human body is also precious. Thus the Dao opens the Dharma, bequeathing precepts and scriptures to deliver humanity. Once the human body is delivered, it ascends to become one with the Dao. Therefore, cultivate purity, maintain the fast, and uphold the precepts. Calm the heart and quiet the mind, with clear resolve and focused intention. Direct your thoughts single-mindedly, purifying the six repositories, and do not transgress the mean. Let inner and outer be clear and empty, ever in accord with the natural.\n\nOn the day of the fast, hold incense and make vows, that your prayers may ascend. The patrolling officers of the Four Heavens and the mighty spirits of the Ten Divisions shall descend to witness your practice, observe the recitation of the Dharma, and reflect upon your heart. Those who uphold the precepts and practice the Dao shall have their merits recorded in the heavens. Fortune and misfortune will manifest swiftly, for the Dao does not fail those who strive. Receive the precepts earnestly, and do not heed demonic words.\n\nThe Heavenly Worthy said: When establishing a fast and practicing the Dao, the Four Heavenly Kings arrive in flying clouds and jade chariots of eight luminaries, accompanied by perfected ones and jade maidens holding floral banners. Phoenixes sing before them, and celestial music follows. White cranes and lions roar and chant in harmony. Burning incense and scattering flowers, they float through the air to witness the practice and hear the Dharma’s voice. The Heavenly Kings descend, and the myriad spirits pay homage. How can one not fulfill the Dharma to its utmost?\n\nFirst receive the Ten Precepts, then practice the Dao. Walk with measured grace, calm the heart, and close the mind. In sitting, rising, lying, and resting, never depart from proper form. The heavens rejoice, and your name is inscribed in the registers of Supreme Purity. This may be called attaining the Dao within the space of a square inch.”",

May misfortune turn to fortune, and all their wishes be fulfilled. We pray that the Dharma rites flow unimpeded, free from any rebuke or rejection. May their repentance and gratitude be met with wondrous response. Bowing in reverence, we rely upon the True Three Treasures.\n\n**Homage to the Scriptures**\n**Three Prostrations**",
