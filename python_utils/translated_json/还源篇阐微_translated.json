  "full_translation": "**Preface to *Elucidating the Return to the Source***\n\nThose who cherish the primordial truth wander through sacred realms, seeking the transmission of the true Dharma, ever aspiring to benefit the world. They abide in singular devotion to the Three Treasures, with particular emphasis on the cultivation of life. For though the study of immortality is most simple, men make it difficult for themselves; though liberation from the dust is not hard, men find it elusive—how lamentable indeed!\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"Deluded clouds obscure the moon of wisdom,\nKarmic winds stir the sea of stillness.\"*\n\nYears ago, at a post station, I encountered my late master, the Perfected Zhang Ziyang. In words of utmost simplicity—no more than half a phrase—he revealed effects that manifested in but a moment. Thus I knew that immortality could indeed be learned, and privately rejoiced. When the golden elixir congealed and the sacred embryo attained perfection, I composed *The Return to the Source* in eighty-one chapters of five-character quatrains, offering it to later students that they might early awaken to the true trap. Do not wait until old age, when lead is spent and mercury scarce—awaken swiftly! Seek a master, inquire into the Dao, refine the golden elixir, ascend together the immortal ranks, transform and take flight—this is my deepest wish.\n\n---\n\n**Postscript**\n\nThose who refine the golden elixir must know that the winter solstice does not lie in the *zi* hour, nor is bathing confined to *mao* and *you*. Mercury and lead are neither saliva, essence, qi, blood, nor fluids. The *seven returns* are the return to the root; the *nine reversions* are the return to the source. When the essence of metal and the fluid of wood meet earth, they unite. Dragon and tiger, horse and ox—all are without form.\n\nAs my late master’s *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water of the Flowery Pond\"*—this refers to lead and mercury. If one knows the origin of lead, one knows the source of mercury. Knowing lead and mercury, one knows the divine water of the Flowery Pond. Knowing the divine water of the Flowery Pond, one may refine the golden elixir.\n\nThe work of the golden elixir is accomplished in an instant—do not cling to the timetable of nine years or three years, nor fixate on years, months, days, or hours for its operation. As Zhongli said: *\"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin.\"* Thus one cannot seek within the body itself, but must seek the single yang essence within it. Yet this yang essence resides in one aperture, which ordinary people cannot fathom. This aperture is the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the very divine water of the Flowery Pond. Knowing this, one may gather and unite, then refine, bathe, and separate the embryo, followed by gentle nurturing. When the elixir is complete, how could one fail to discern its source, know its weight, or recognize its time?\n\nSince receiving my master’s teaching, I have known that this body need not die, and that this elixir must surely be achieved. Now that the great work is underway, I proclaim this to all future seekers of immortality.\n\n*Another postscript by Shi Tai of Apricot Grove.*\n\n---\n\n**Elucidating *The Return to the Source***\n\n*The Return to the Source*, in eighty-one chapters, was composed by the Perfected Shi of Apricot Grove during the Song dynasty. A disciple of the Perfected Zhang Ziyang, he was the second patriarch of the Southern Lineage. Moved by pity for those who study books in pursuit of the Dao yet fail to awaken to their own nature, he wrote this work to repeatedly clarify the path of returning to the root and source.\n\nThe method of returning to the source begins with unwavering adherence to right mindfulness. In the midst of daily ethical conduct, one must everywhere restrain anger and suppress desire, acting with sincerity and without pretense, practicing ritual—this is *refining the self*. Silently applying effort to purify the mind and forget emotions, one dredges and opens the *Du* and *Ren* meridians. Through vigilant solitude, one retreats and conceals within the profound—this is *laying the foundation*. Naturally, a single point of true yang qi emerges from the body, and a single drop of true yin essence flows from the heart. These intermingle and congeal into the elixir—this is the *elixir head*.\n\nFrom this point, the heart naturally abides in sincerity, and qi naturally circulates throughout. Over time, the heart is concealed within the heart yet unseen, and qi is stored within qi yet unfathomable. In stillness, one is empty; in motion, one is direct. Qi is fresh, and spirit is clear—this is *completing the body*. Only when the three temporal realms are fully penetrated, all conditions stilled, the six senses purified, and the square inch of the heart empty and luminous—only then, after a month of unbroken practice, do the medicinal substances flow ceaselessly. Throughout, one operates with pure stillness and naturalness, thereby returning to the source, reverting to the root, and uniting with the Dao—this is *perfecting the true*.\n\nSuch is the essence of the golden elixir. Yet the great key lies first in knowing the single aperture within the body, for only then can one begin. This aperture is the window of spirit and brightness, the origin of nature and life. When scattered, it disperses into the seven apertures; when returned to its root, it coalesces into one. Only one who can gather the body with the heart knows how to fathom principle and exhaust nature. Only one who can conceal the heart within the body can exhaust nature and attain life.\n\nFor the heart and body are the supports of nature and life, while nature and life are the root and stem of the heart and body. Essence and qi are the functions of the heart and body, while the heart and body are the gathering and storing places of spirit and qi. Thus, one who can gather the body’s qi with the heart causes spirit to return to the Celestial Valley, enabling the fathoming of principle and the exhaustion of nature. One who can conceal the heart’s spirit within the body causes qi to return to the Crimson Palace, enabling the exhaustion of nature and the attainment of life.\n\nOnly when principle is fathomed are desires purified; only when nature is exhausted are emotions forgotten. With desires purified and emotions forgotten, nothing disturbs the center. I alone guard the profound mystery of life, and suddenly the single aperture opens wide—this is *opening the barrier*. Perceiving that within it is emptiness without exhaustion, movement without cessation, one follows the transformations of opportunity and allows all to proceed naturally. This is what the *Book of Documents* means by: *\"The Dao-heart is subtle; only with precision and unity can one truly hold to the center.\"* And what the *Dao De Jing* means by: *\"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.\"*\n\nHaving returned to the root, one recovers life; recovering life, one returns the elixir. How could one not, by tracing the flow to its source, first return to the moment of receiving qi at birth? Returning to my origin, the valley spirit does not die.\n\nGuard well the beginning to secure the end, and the Golden Elixir may surely be accomplished.\n\n(Received) This treatise was graciously bestowed by my late master, the Venerable Tai Xu, who also instructed me in the essentials of superior-grade lead and mercury. I have pondered it in silence, daring not to presumptuously add my own interpretations, until a single word from the master’s illumination suddenly brought full awakening.\n\nThe method of returning to the source, as revealed in the sequence of this text, encompasses all oral instructions—from *gathering* and *joining* to *smelting*, *bathing*, *parting the embryo*, *warming and nurturing*, and finally the elixir’s completion and liberation—none other than the repeated elucidation of the Way of returning to the root and restoring the origin, exhausting the subtlest to attain the vastest.\n\nOne who cultivates accordingly may enter the inner sanctum of sages and worthies, may ascend the stairway of immortals and buddhas. Now that the karmic conditions have ripened, I reverently honor my master’s intent and expound upon the text’s subtleties. Here, I command my grandnephew Yang Lin to record the following:\n\n**Lead and mercury form the true body;\nYin and yang conjoin the Great Origin.**\n\nThe master said: *\"Lead refers to the body; mercury refers to the heart. When they meet the Origin in due time, this is the superior-grade elixir path.\"*\n\nMy humble observation: At the moment before birth when one first receives qi, a single aperture forms within, containing essence, qi, and spirit—these three intermingled as one, steaming and swirling within, growing day and night. By the tenth month, when the fetus is fully formed, with a sudden forceful cry, the primordial aperture bursts open, connecting to the seven orifices, and breathing begins.\n\nWithin the body, three valleys then emerge: above, the Celestial Valley of Mud Pill Palace, the abode of spirit; in the center, the Resonant Valley of Crimson Palace, the abode of qi; below, the Hollow Valley of Pass of Origin, later to become the abode of essence. At that time, primordial essence has already spread throughout the solid regions of the body and circulates; primordial qi has gathered in the central valley of Crimson Palace to serve as the foundation of life; primordial spirit then floats upward to the Celestial Valley of Mud Pill Palace to serve as the lodging of nature.\n\nPresently, primordial qi stirs and generates yang, beginning to flow into the lower valley of Pass of Origin to become essence—hence the lower valley is also called the Sea of Qi. Yet this essence remains primordial essence, still circulating with qi throughout the body. Whenever stillness reaches its utmost, the seven orifices merge back into one, and within the body, a single point of true yang qi rises to ascend toward the primordial spirit—this is what the elixir path calls *true lead*. Thus, the master designates the body as lead.\n\nPrimordial spirit, in stillness, generates yin, which also spreads into the central valley of Crimson Palace to become qi—hence the central valley is also called the Chamber of Spirit. Yet this qi remains primordial qi, still congealed with spirit, constantly generating fluid to nourish the heart. Whenever yang stirs, the single aperture is about to divide into seven, and from the heart first flows a single drop of true yin essence to meet the yang qi—this is what the elixir path calls *true mercury*. Thus, the master designates the heart as mercury.\n\nWhen lead-qi obtains mercury-essence to circulate, the physical form matures—hence *\"lead and mercury form the true body.\"* When yin-essence combines with yang-qi to ascend, primordial spirit congeals—hence *\"yin and yang conjoin the Great Origin.\"*\n\nIn truth, lead refers to the qi within the body, and mercury refers to the essence within the heart—these are the primordial yang-spirit and yin-essence that have descended into the postnatal state, resembling the hidden Qian and Kun within Kan and Li. Yin refers to the qi within the sea, and yang refers to the spirit within the chamber—these are the postnatal lead-qi and mercury-essence returning to the primordial state, resembling the postnatal Kan and Li reverting to Qian and Kun.\n\nSimply by inverting Kan and Li and returning the postnatal to the prior, spirit then lodges in the heart, resembling Qian; qi then relies upon the body, resembling Kun. Kun provides life—hence it is called *body*; Qian provides inception—hence it is called *Origin*. *\"True body\"* clarifies that the body has not yet leaked, remaining the body of the True One; *\"Great Origin\"* clarifies that the Origin has not yet dissipated, still holding the primordial of the Supreme Ultimate—both formed spontaneously at birth without reliance on artificial effort.\n\nThis chapter establishes the fundamental principle, explicitly pointing to the origin and showing that the body formed by the congealing of essence and qi serves as the foundation of primordial life, while the heart formed by the congealing of spirit and qi serves as the lodging of primordial nature. With body and heart attained, nature and life are complete; essence and qi daily flourish, medicine and fire are both prepared—one need only return daily to the True One.\n\n**Merely knowing the practice of the two eights,\nOne may refine the Golden Elixir.**\n\nThis means that when one attains this body, heart, nature, and life—with spirit relying upon the heart and belonging to Qian, and qi depending upon the body and belonging to Kun—if one can maintain constant clarity and stillness, the seven orifices long remain merged into one, still resembling a single formed Supreme Ultimate. Nature has not yet leaked away, resembling a solid golden elixir. One need only return to emptiness and unite with the Dao to merge with the true Origin—why employ deliberate cultivation with the troubles of restoring nature and life?\n\nYet after birth, the seven orifices have already become individually perceptive and cannot constantly return to the one aperture. Thus, the undifferentiated is shattered into knowledge, and knowledge in turn transforms into consciousness. From this point, the heart is moved by external things and develops preferences and aversions; the body encounters external things and experiences joy and anger.\n\nThe essence within the heart, once drawn by external objects, no longer obeys the governance of primordial nature, constantly chasing outward instead of nourishing the heart. Primordial nature, having no lodging, thus dissipates. The primordial spirit, previously modeled on Qian, now becomes hollow and transforms into Li.\n\nThe qi within the body, once stirred by yin-essence, no longer circulates in accordance with primordial life, constantly leaking outward instead of filling the body. Primordial life, lacking sufficient foundation, daily diminishes. The primordial qi, previously modeled on Kun, now becomes substantial and transforms into Kan.\n\nPrimordial spirit was originally solid, but by constantly chasing qi, it daily appears hollow. Primordial qi was originally empty, but by constantly flowing into essence, it reverses and appears solid.\n\nAt last, the hollow grows ever more hollow, and the solid loses its solidity once more, giving rise to the afflictions of aging, sickness, death, and suffering. This is not due to any inherent flaw in the root or source, but rather the harm of pursuing the branch while neglecting the root, of mistaking the flow for the source.\n\nWhen spirit loses its solidity, the heart transforms in form to become Li. When qi loses its hollowness, the body likewise transforms in form to become Kan. Thus, the single spark of yang within the postnatal Kan-body is none other than the prenatal primordial qi. In the hexagram’s virtue, it resembles fire within water—hence it is called \"yang-qi.\" The single drop of yin within the postnatal Li-heart is none other than the prenatal primordial spirit. In the hexagram’s virtue, it gathers as water within fire—hence it is called \"yin-essence.\"\n\nThe term \"two eights\" refers to the symbolic numbers within the hexagrams. Kan-water is already formed water, its number six belonging to earth. The fire within water is newly born fire, its number two also belonging to earth—six and two both pertain to earth, forming one of the \"eights\" of earth. This represents the prenatal primordial qi issuing forth from within my body, metaphorically called \"lead.\" Li-fire is already formed fire, its number seven belonging to heaven. The water within fire is newly born water, its number one also belonging to heaven—seven and one both pertain to heaven, forming one of the \"eights\" of heaven. This represents the prenatal primordial spirit issuing forth from within my heart, metaphorically called \"mercury.\" Thus, whenever speaking of medicine or fire, one must refer to it as \"two eights,\" and no other number will suffice.\n\nThe phrase \"practicing the two eights\" is precisely the Dao of \"timely uniting the primordial,\" as the master taught—employing only purity and naturalness in its application. Now, recognizing the harm of mistaking the flow for the source and wishing to return to the root, if one does not restrain anger and suppress desires, there is absolutely no way to begin. If one wishes to suppress desires and restrain anger, then uniting and practicing these two eights will make spirit the fire and qi the medicine.\n\nAt the time of gathering, it is called \"medicine,\" for it is still postnatal yin-essence and yang-qi. At the time of refinement, it is called \"fire,\" for it belongs to the prenatal—spirit is yang, while qi is yin. Simply knowing how to employ spirit to guide qi is to use fire to refine medicine, which can then form the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor.\n\nThe term \"refinement\" implies the need for vigilance against danger and caution against risk, yet it still employs only purity and naturalness in its application. For the yang-qi within my body, now just returning from its temporary abode in the hollow valley, if not congealed by spirit, risks scattering. The yin-essence within my body, now just returning from its temporary abode in the responsive valley, if not circulated by qi, risks sinking back into its former state.\n\nOnly by constantly establishing the substance of the Dao through tranquility can one obtain true lead and mercury as the function of the Dao. When using these two substances—lead and mercury—to unite the primordial, they coalesce into one. The proper thought immediately retreats and conceals itself, congealing into profound stillness. Within thought, there is no thought—thus, in an instant, they congeal, returning to the moment when my born body first received qi.\n\nConfucius said, \"Essence and qi become things,\" does this not refer to the true body formed by the congealing of lead and mercury? Laozi said, \"There is a thing, undifferentiated and complete,\" does this not refer to the Great Primordial formed by the congealing of yin and yang? Master Zhang Ziyang said, \"Grasp the foundation of Kan and Li, and the three realms return to one body,\" does this not refer to the pivotal method of practicing the two eights to refine the Golden Elixir?\n\nThus, lead and mercury are yin and yang; the union of yin and yang is the Great Primordial; the Great Primordial is the true body. The true body, the Great Primordial, is my prenatal \"one that becomes two.\" When timely united, it becomes \"two that return to one.\" Now, one can suddenly awaken!\n\n**Chapter One (conclusion)**\nThis entire chapter serves as the guiding principle, revealing that body and heart, nature and life, spirit and qi, medicine and fire—all are complete from the very beginning of one’s existence. Thus, it spares no effort in clearly expounding the original source of human life to aid practitioners in personal realization. The following eighty chapters are all annotations to this chapter.\n\nThe next seven chapters systematically elucidate the methods of gathering, uniting, and refining. Chapters nine through fifteen teach the secrets of beginning practice. Chapters sixteen through twenty-four expound on the crucial openings, detailing the processes of refinement, bathing, guarding against danger, contemplating risks, as well as the methods of separating the embryo, nurturing, and forming the elixir. Chapters twenty-five through forty-eight re-emphasize the central tenets, unfolding the true mechanism so that readers may have all doubts dispelled.\n\nFrom chapters forty-nine to sixty-eight, the text clearly instructs on returning postnatal essence and qi to prenatal spirit and qi to form the Valley Spirit. From the Valley Spirit, one refines the yang-spirit, and from the yang-spirit, one further refines to restore the primordial spirit—ultimately returning the primordial spirit to the true Non-Ultimate to become a True Person, thus merging with the Dao in truth. The completion of the Golden Elixir directly reveals the ancient sages’ intent to thoroughly investigate principle, fulfill nature, and attain life—this teaching is earnestly imparted with meticulous steps.\n\nThe final three chapters once more invoke the heart-transmission of the ancient sages, earnestly urging the necessary union of spirit and qi, body and heart, nature and life, thereby summarizing the entire work’s meaning. If a practitioner has truly cultivated the work of refining the self, concentrating qi and unifying spirit, holding fast to the singular, numinous, and upright thought, then facing this text, they will naturally perceive the method as exceedingly simple and can immediately enter the Dao through seated practice.\n\nMercury is the marrow of the Azure Dragon; lead is the fat of the White Tiger. The yin-essence within the heart originally emerges from the fissure of the root of nature. Here, it is called the marrow of the Azure Dragon because alchemists use the Azure Dragon to symbolize the hun-soul. In the prenatal hexagram positions, it belongs to Li, residing in the east—thus Master Zhang referred to it as \"the Wood of the Eastern Hun.\" The prenatal hun-soul remains concealed within Qian, unmoving. In the postnatal state, Qian becomes hollow at its center, transforming into Li. Li resides in the south and pertains to fire—thus Master Zhang also called it \"the Fire of the Southern Spirit.\"\n\nThis hun-soul is stored in the liver, though it still resides in the east, its hexagram has already transformed into the moving image of Zhen, prone to anger. Its function relies on the heart to become spirit, for the heart is the abode of spirit. The yin-essence now spilling from my heart originally arises from the prenatal root-qi to become mercury—previously likened to \"water within fire,\" yet in truth, it is the fluid of Wood. Thus it is called the marrow of the Azure Dragon, meaning it requires refinement.\n\nThe yang-qi within the body originally draws forth from the stem of life. Now called the fat of the White Tiger, alchemists use the White Tiger to symbolize the po-soul. In the prenatal hexagram positions, it belongs to Kan, residing in the west—thus Master Zhang referred to it as \"the Metal of the Western Po.\" The prenatal po-soul remains concealed within Kun, unmanifest. In the postnatal state, Kun becomes replete at its center, transforming into Kan. Kan resides in the north and pertains to water—thus Master Zhang also called it \"the Water of the Northern Essence.\"\n\nThis po-soul is stored in the lungs, though it still resides in the west, its hexagram has already transformed into the joyous image of Dui, inclined toward gentleness. Its function depends on the body to become essence, for the body is where essence congeals. The yang-qi now surging within me originally stems from the prenatal Metal-qi to become lead—previously likened to \"fire within water,\" yet in truth, it is the fluid of Metal. Thus it is called the fat of the White Tiger, meaning it requires smelting.\n\nGather them into the crucible; the timing of their gathering must be known.\n\nThis speaks of the moment when the two substances, essence and qi, arise—precisely the time for their gathering. The method lies solely in summoning them at will to unite, returning them to the crucible. Thus Kan, now hollow at its center, reverts to Kun, while Li, now replete at its core, returns to Qian. When essence and qi merge within the crucible, Qian and Kun likewise unite to restore the Supreme Polarity. This is called the \"elixir head,\" which Master Zhang termed the \"true seed.\"\n\nTo return is to store; the crucible is the orthodox transmission of the *Yi*’s Dao. The alchemists’ watchword has no visible form—it resides at the very center of the sixfold harmony within this body. As the ancients said, \"Within lies a true golden crucible,\" yet it has no fixed location to confine it. The *Yi* states, \"The crucible: the noble person rectifies their position and consolidates their mandate.\"\n\nThe \"time\" refers to the moment when *gui* arises—half of the \"living midnight.\" If one has not yet awakened, one should sit upright in meditation as practice. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins, this is the time of *gui*’s arising. Swiftly withdraw the proper thought and conceal it in secrecy for gathering; any diversion of intent will fail. This must not be sought elsewhere.\n\nIn sum: the yang-qi within Kan is true lead; the yin-essence within Li is true mercury. Kan and Li give birth to lead and mercury, while lead and mercury arise from body and mind. The function of body and mind is essence and qi, and the substance of essence and qi is nature and life. Extracting the yang from Kan returns it to Kun; filling the void in Li restores it to Qian. These two substances are like a wellspring—qi is primordial qi, essence transforms into spirit. When spirit and qi interact, Kan and Li revert to Kun and Qian. As they wondrously merge and congeal, Qian and Kun blend into the Supreme Polarity. From this point, yin and yang, movement and stillness become each other’s root, binding inseparably, harmonizing indistinguishably, and uniting purely without end.\n\nIs this not the simplest and easiest method of gathering?\n\n---\n\nThe maiden rides the lead tiger,\nThe golden elder straddles the mercury dragon.\nThe maiden is true mercury,\nThe golden elder is true lead.\nTheir names and meanings are detailed in Chapter Ten.\nThe tiger symbolizes the body,\nThe dragon symbolizes the mind.\nMaster Zhang said, \"The mind’s wildness is like a dragon,\nThe body’s ferocity is like a tiger.\"\n\"Rides\" and \"straddles\" describe the image of mutual mastery.\nWhen the two medicines are gathered into the crucible,\nYin-essence naturally masters yang-qi,\nAnd yang-qi governs yin-essence,\nForming an undifferentiated whole.\nYet if at this moment tranquility is lacking,\nThe spirit scatters outward,\nAnd the elixir head dissolves.\nOne must await the renewed gathering of lead and mercury,\nHence the following admonition to clarify the proper command.\n\n---\n\n*Jia* and *geng* clarify the proper command,\nRefining to forge a furnace of red.\n*Jia*, belonging to wood, symbolizes nature;\n*Geng*, belonging to metal, symbolizes indolence.\nThe \"proper command\" is an unbiased decree—\nWhat Confucius called \"straightening what is upright,\"\nWhat Master Bai termed \"the movement of thought as the Mysterious Female,\"\nAnd the *Wenyan* of Kun’s second line describes as \"the noble person’s reverence to straighten within.\"\nTo \"clarify the proper command\" is to first understand it in ordinary times,\nSo that when the moment arrives, a single reaffirmation suffices,\nAnd all parts naturally obey.\nAt the first union of essence and qi,\nOne must ensure tranquility of nature and ease of emotion\nTo preserve harmony without dissipation.\nThe method relies on the power of reverence and sincerity cultivated in advance.\nWhile the mind has not yet stirred,\nSwiftly clarify the Dao of nurturing uprightness,\nFirst concealing it in secrecy,\nSo that within thought there is no thought.\nEssence congeals with qi to form spirit,\nEmotion returns to nature in great stillness,\nAnd the elixir head solidifies without risk of leakage—\nWhat Mencius called \"nurturing with uprightness and causing no harm.\"\n\"A furnace of red\" is what alchemists call\n\"A furnace of flame forging emptiness,\nThe very path of refinement,\"\nWhat Mencius termed \"fullness radiating brilliance.\"\n\n---\n\nThe serpent’s po seizes the dragon’s marrow,\nThe tortoise’s hun subdues the tiger’s essence.\nThe serpent symbolizes emotion,\nWhich often responds to gentleness with joy—\nThe work of the po-soul, hence \"serpent’s po.\"\nThe \"dragon’s marrow\" symbolizes the yin-essence within the mind.\nThe tortoise symbolizes nature,\nWhich often reacts to shock with anger—\nThe work of the hun-soul, hence \"tortoise’s hun.\"\nThe \"tiger’s essence\" symbolizes the yang-qi within the body.\nThis continues from the previous chapter:\nWhen the proper command is clarified,\nEmotion is forgotten and returns to its original nature,\nThus the wild dragon of the mind is captured.\nAs essence ceases to waver and nature stabilizes,\nThe root of emotion is severed,\nSo the ferocious tiger of the body is subdued,\nAnd qi no longer stagnates.\n\"Seizes\" and \"subdues\" are but acting without contrivance—\nAs the saying goes, \"The tiger is tamed, the dragon is lowered,\nThe macaque no longer peers through the six windows.\"\nDoes this not describe it?\n\nWithin the divine waters of the Flowery Pond,\nA single bud of jade fat takes form.\nMaster Zhang states: \"When lead meets mercury, it is called the Flowery Ground; when mercury enters lead, it is called the Divine Water.\"\nIn my humble understanding of Master Zhang’s intent:\nLead symbolizes the body, likened to a pond—\nWhen mercury appears, its qi flourishes, hence the name *Flowery Pond*.\nMercury symbolizes the mind, called water—\nAs it moves in and out of lead, the spirit is invigorated, hence the name *Divine Water*.\nWhen mercury and lead harmonize,\nIt is but a metaphor for Divine Water entering the Flowery Pond—\nIn truth, it is only the spirit returning and the body’s qi naturally restored!\nWhen lead and mercury have congealed,\nEmotion is forgotten and nature stabilizes,\nThe spirit enters qi as water returns to the pond.\nThere is a master ever wakeful,\nLike a flower budding with sap, blossoming in joy;\nOr jade congealing into fat, dense and solid in form—\nSuch are the metaphors.\n○ Chapter Four above.\nThis continues from the previous chapter, elucidating that once the two substances have united,\nNature and emotion are rectified, their substance undivided—\nThus the elixir’s foundation is established!\n\nWhite snow flies in the jasper garden,\nYellow sprouts emerge in the jade orchard.\n\n\"White snow\" refers to the body belonging to *kan* (☵). Within *kan*, the single yang is *qian*-metal, hence its color is white. The generation of lead within the body arises from the overflowing of metal-qi; when it encounters mercury and transforms into divine water, bright, pure, and crystalline, it takes on the appearance of snow. *Jasper garden* is a metaphor for the body.\n\n\"Yellow sprouts\" refers to the heart belonging to *li* (☲). Within *li*, the single yin is *kun*-earth, hence its color is yellow. The generation of mercury within the heart arises from the abundance of wood-fluid; when it meets lead and congeals, it enters the Flowery Pond, blending and flourishing—thus taking on the appearance of sprouting. *Jade orchard* likewise metaphorically refers to this body.\n\n\"Flying\" and \"emerging\" describe how, when lead receives the union of mercury, it ascends and permeates, its momentum poised to scatter across the sky; when mercury receives the congealment of lead, it descends and flows, its momentum poised to flourish across the earth.\n\nMaster Zixian Xuezi said: *\"Without white snow, there are no yellow sprouts. White snow is the divine water of the spirit-chamber; yellow sprouts are the flowers of the qi-pivot.\"* This serves as verification!\n\nYet one must not seek them with intention.\n\nYet if one can resemble the recumbent moon, where then is the forging of red lead?\n\nTo resemble the recumbent moon is but a transformed image of the original mysterious aperture. Before the elixir is obtained within this body, one maintains inner purity and guards the One—all seven apertures return to the single aperture. Within it, emptiness and numinous clarity stand open, round and whole as an egg, for in stillness it contracts. When the elixir arises, the moment one’s true command arrives, the aperture turns upward like a vessel to receive the medicine, for as it is about to move, it also begins to open. Viewed from the side at that moment, its form resembles the recumbent moon. Once the medicine is received and merges into darkness, it returns to the egg-like guarding. For the instant a thought stirs, it settles again—the mysterious aperture opens only to contract once more. If moved by emotion and the heart stirs, the aperture will open into seven, and the medicine scatters. Thus, the ability to resemble the recumbent moon serves as verification of receiving the medicine. Yet this describes only its likeness, for it arises spontaneously, without form or substance to behold.\n\nRed lead, as Master Zhang states, is “true lead born in Kan, whose function lies in the Li palace”—the transformation from black to red. Yet even this has no color or appearance. To ask “where is it forged” is to remind that spirit has no fixed form, warning against attachment to deliberate action. This is what Mencius meant by “there must be doing, yet without fixation.”\n\nIn essence, once the cinnabar head is established, the medicinal substances arise at all times. If one can only clarify the true command, no external distractions will intrude. Within, it will naturally receive at all times. Over time, with qi abundant and spirit full, the Valley Spirit will naturally be replete.\n\nFor the cultivator, at first one suffers from not knowing the aperture; once the aperture is understood, one must vigilantly guard against its severance. Withdrawal and concealment beforehand are essential—purity and stillness are wondrously subtle. If one can withdraw and conceal beforehand, then when the moment arrives, one will not miss the opportunity, and subsequent thoughts will not disturb. Knowing this, the heart can be rectified!\n\nAbove, Chapter Five.\n\nBuilding upon the previous chapter, once the cinnabar head is established, the medicinal substances arise at every moment, and the more one gathers, the more inexhaustible they become. Yet one must never turn the mind to calculation or measurement, for then this inner realm will naturally receive—absolutely no contrivance should be employed to hasten the process. This is what Master Zhang meant by “one grain begets another, from the subtle to the manifest,” speaking only of the grandeur of accumulation, without any form or image to liken it to.\n\nThe medicinal material opens the primordial chaos; the fire-tending refines the vast expanse.\nThe “medicinal material” is the term used at the moment of gathering; the “fire-tending” is the designation during the process of refinement—both refer to this essence and qi. To say “opening the primordial chaos” and “refining the vast expanse” means that this essence and qi emerge only in the midst of purity and stillness, when the seven apertures return to one, like the unmanifest within chaos, naturally unfolding. Refining it with the intent of purity, without distinguishing inner or outer, is like the formless vastness of the primordial state, naturally coalescing into success. This clarifies the earlier teachings on the true command and the waning moon, instructing one to grasp it with a mind free of effort, rather than through labored striving.\n\nAfter ten months, the immortal embryo transforms—only then does one recognize the work of the nine revolutions.\n“Transformation” is what Master Bai referred to as “shattering emptiness to reach completion,” the same as the later “transcendence of the embryo and spiritual transformation.” The “nine revolutions” are the nine returns. Nine is the completion number of metal, signifying the return of the yang qi within the body, not nine literal cycles. It means that when the medicinal material arises from nothing, one must refine it like the great creation’s primordial vastness, without pausing to assess its appearance. Only after three hundred days, when the embryo is complete, does one realize the work of gathering the body’s original yang qi when first forming the elixir.\n\nAbove, Chapter Six.\nHere, it speaks of obtaining the elixir and refining it, without clinging to form or seeking signs—its efficacy will become known in time. As the *Canticle* says, “Do not seek through examination.”\n\nWhere the dragon rightly conceals its pearl, where the hen just broods her egg—\nwho knows when lead and mercury unite? Precisely then may one drink the *daogui*.\n“Concealing the pearl” and “brooding the egg” illustrate the wondrousness of the aperture. The *Inner Landscape* states: “Once one knows to return all to the single aperture, one has grasped the method of dwelling in secrecy—simply be like the dragon nurturing its pearl, like the hen brooding her egg, with spirit unwaveringly fixed.” The word “who” carries profound meaning. My teacher, Master Taixu, in his commentary on the *Nine Heavens’ Heart-Seal Repentance Text*, said: “Neither self nor other, inexpressible yet forcibly called—‘who.’” The word “who” appears eleven times in this text, and each instance may be understood in this light. To say “who knows when lead and mercury unite” means only to conceal the spirit in secrecy, guarding purity and stillness, without distinguishing what is other or primary, what is self or guest, nor even whether the two substances have merged—this is true seamless union.\n\nThe *daogui* refers to the two earths, wu and ji, both numbered five, originally sharing the central position. After generation, they lodge in Kan and Li—Kan’s yang is the essence of wu earth, Li’s yin is the essence of ji earth. The ancients spoke of this as the principle of Kan-Li and the *daogui*; earlier scholars called it “the essence of the two fives”... to clarify that when Kan’s wu and Li’s ji meet, there is no intervening substance, and they unite in the center—hence *daogui*. It teaches that one should employ only the initial intent, which is the true command, the same as what the earlier sages called “the true of the limitless” and “the wondrous union of the two fives, congealed.”\n\nLaozi’s *Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness* says: “Without form, without emotion, without name—forced to name it, call it the Dao.” This is the true meaning of my teacher’s explanation of “who”—it is the Dao that may be employed when meeting the origin. The first thought after the initial one is already attachment; though correct, it has fallen into the postnatal, instantly turning into deliberation, and the two earths become separated by the nature of wood and the disposition of metal. Qi, being Kan’s wu, flows into breathing, and the water palace cannot preserve its source; essence, being Li’s ji, seeps into the bladder, and the spirit chamber cannot secure its dwelling. Thus, water-essence and fire-spirit cannot assist each other, and the four images are no longer at one’s disposal—how then can lead and mercury unite to congeal the immortal embryo? Therefore, the cultivator must take the ability to drink the *daogui* as the proper method for uniting lead and mercury. To say “precisely then may one drink” means that at the moment when lead and mercury first arise—when the heavenly heart’s stillness first stirs into the true command—this is when the two substances have congealed and may be refined. It does not say “use” but “drink,” implying the self-awareness of drinking water or broth, hot or cold. Where my intent is aware, refinement naturally follows, illustrating the wondrous function of the true command, where within use there is correct awareness—still, only purity and unbroken density are the work. From this, one may know that a moment’s effort already encompasses refinement. For the union occurs at the stirring of the thought, in an instant; refinement, self-contained and withdrawn, requires a moment’s duration to become firm. The union arises naturally; refinement is what congeals it. Thus, before the union, one works within the workless work, sitting in meditation to prepare for gathering. When the medicine arises, one practices effortless use within useful use, abiding in great stillness without thought or action—this is refinement. This is the subtlety within subtlety—how easily can it be spoken? Yet having spoken it, the words are already overly verbose. Let the reader condense and refine, apprehend it spiritually—it rests with the person.\n\nAbove, Chapter Seven.\nThis continues the previous chapter, elucidating the Dao of refinement: one need only maintain unbroken continuity, as Master Bai said, “Guarding against interruption and lack of focus.”\n\nBathing relies on the Water of Kun, breath revives through the Wind of Xun.\nAt this stage, if thoughts are not sealed tightly, the fire scatters, and the body feels chilled. Yet when one clarifies the true mandate, the spirit returns to the center and qi naturally flows back—there arises a direct qi that steams through the entire body for bathing, and warmth returns. This is called \"relying on the Water of Kun\": as one’s bodily form has already transformed into the primordial, the northern position is no longer the postnatal Kan trigram, so this natural bathing qi is termed the Water of Kun. If distracting thoughts arise and disturb, the fire becomes impure, and the body feels restless and hot. Yet when one turns back to the correct mindfulness to quell agitation, the inner stillness remains undisturbed, and true breath gently blows, bringing coolness throughout—harmony returns. This is called \"relying on the Wind of Xun\": as one’s Kun body has reverted to the primordial, the southwest region is originally the Xun palace of the nose, so this natural breath is termed the Wind of Xun. This is the wondrous remedy for balancing cold and warmth—when the spirit returns, qi follows of itself, and one need not seek it in the qi aspect. Master Bai took vigilant awareness as \"conducting the fire,\" the steaming of true qi as \"bathing,\" and stilling thoughts as \"nurturing the fire\"—his method is precise indeed!\n\nThe infant has no affairs, dwelling alone in the Palace of Grand Tenuity.\nThe infant refers to the spirit formed when the yin essence within the heart has coalesced with yang qi, now returning to reside in the original palace of the Celestial Valley—called the Valley Spirit. The ancients likened it to an infant, for at this stage its spiritual power is still weak and requires one’s correct mindfulness to constantly sustain and guard it. The Palace of Grand Tenuity, in the heavens, is the Grand Tenuity Enclosure with the imperial seat at its center; in the human body, it is the central palace among the nine palaces of the head—the Mud Pill Palace, the abode where the Valley Spirit resides to nurture the true. My teacher often said: \"The infant is the true person—it must be in a state of leisure and non-use, idly and alone nurturing the primordial spirit.\" His meaning is profound! This is the light of self-nature. Within the human body, only this is true nurturance; when the true body manifests, it is the Perfected One of the wondrous Dao.\n\nAbove, Chapter Eight.\nThis continues the previous chapter, stating that after refinement comes bathing. If cold or warmth becomes unbalanced, it is always due to the spirit straying outward or thoughts disturbing within—one must swiftly correct the fault. Guarding the infant, dwelling alone in the upper valley, practicing non-action and stillness, allowing qi to circulate naturally—this is the remedy for harmony, without need to startle the spirit. If the spirit is startled, it clings to phenomena and remains adrift in the cycle of birth and death. From the previous chapter to this, the principles of the elixir foundation, gathering, union, refinement, and bathing are fully expounded. Yet the essential teaching lies in sustaining mindfulness for gathering, concealing mindfulness for absorption, stilling the spirit for union as delusions vanish, concentrating qi for refinement, and absence of delusion for congealing. When delusion vanishes, correct mindfulness endures; when correct mindfulness is concealed, delusion does not arise—the method is upright, simple, and unburdensome. The following seven chapters continue from this, elucidating the principles of nurturing, parting the embryo, and forging—all emphasizing pure stillness, complete non-action, to be inwardly realized and personally practiced. The phrase \"concentrating qi\" comes from the *Daodejing*, meaning one should be as self-sufficient in qi as an infant, practicing this without mental contrivance.\n\nIn the Purple Palace, seek the Maiden of Li; in the Vermilion Mound, pair with the Youth of Kan.\n\nAt the matchmaking of the Yellow Matron, the Great Ultimate naturally embraces the Three.\nThe Purple Palace is an analogy for my body; the Vermilion Mound, for my heart; the Yellow Matron, for my intent.\n\nIn my humble interpretation: The postnatal body corresponds to the northern Kan trigram, Kan belonging to Water, its color originally black. To revert to the prenatal Kun trigram, one must seek the Yin within the southern Li to receive it. Li belongs to Fire, its color vermilion; vermilion and black blend to form purple—hence \"in the Purple Palace, seek the Maiden of Li.\" The Maiden is the Yin within Li, meaning the postnatal Kan body reverts to the prenatal Kun body. The postnatal heart corresponds to the southern Li trigram; to revert to the prenatal Qian trigram, one must seek the Yang within the northern Kan to pair with it. The Vermilion Mound is the name of a cavern on the Southern Marchmount, used as an analogy for the heart’s abode—hence \"in the Vermilion Mound, pair with the Youth of Kan.\" The Youth is the Yang within Kan, meaning the postnatal Li heart reverts to the prenatal Qian heart.\n\nYellow is the color of Earth; *pó* is an honorific for an elder woman. The Yellow Matron thus refers to one’s correct mindfulness. It speaks of refining the postnatal heart and body: first, within the body, seek the Yin essence of the heart to pair with the Yang qi of the body. When Yang qi obtains Yin essence, it courses straight through; the Yin essence, relying on Yang qi, is refined into spirit, which then returns to its original palace, the Valley of Mystery—all depending on one’s correct mindfulness first withdrawing to mediate in secret. Thus, the Three of body, heart, and intent are embraced as one Great Ultimate, forming this Valley Spirit. The Valley Spirit’s arising is the congealing of essence and qi; correct mindfulness remains singular, its command clear. It naturally merges within, yet claims no merit—hence \"the Great Ultimate naturally embraces the Three.\"\n\n○ Above, Chapter Nine.\nThis continues the previous chapter, elucidating how body and heart revert—solely by relying on one’s sincere intent to secretly unite as one aperture. The following chapter will expound upon this repeatedly.\n\nThe Qian horse drives the Metal Gate, the Kun ox enters the Wood Palace.\nMetal symbolizes emotion—once Vermilion Mound is paired with the Kan youth to form Qian, one may employ the Dao of firm strength to govern emotion, so the spirit naturally conceals itself in secrecy, ever dwelling in Heavenly Valley to nurture nature. Yet who brings this about?\nWood symbolizes inherent nature—once Purple Court is united with the Li maiden to form Kun, one may employ the virtue of gentle compliance to guide inherent nature, so qi naturally fills the void, ever attending Mud Pill to nurture life. Yet who truly enables this?\n\nAh, who escorts the Alchemical Maiden to wed the Metal Elder?\nThe maiden is the Yin essence within Li, entering Kan to become Kun—since she returns from Li to Kun as qi, she bears the image of a maiden returning to her dwelling, hence the Alchemical Maiden.\nThe Metal Elder is the Yang qi within Kan, entering Li to become Qian—since he returns from Kan to Qian and transforms into spirit, he bears the image of youth maturing into age, hence the Metal Elder.\n\"Wedding\" speaks of Yin essence departing Li to enter Kan, thereby pairing Kun with Qian, illustrating how the heart becomes the dwelling of the body and the body becomes the vessel of the heart, evoking the image of a bride following her husband.\nWhen Yin essence departs Li for Kan, Yang qi’s departure from Kan to enter Li goes without saying!\nAt that time, had my correct command not illuminated its virtue, foreseeing the future and concealing the past, how could qi nurture form to achieve compliance, or essence refine into spirit to achieve strength?\nNow, with compliant form paired to steadfast spirit, wondrously merging into the profound obscurity of the Great Ultimate, nature and emotion each attain their proper place—whose power is this?\n\nThe Metal Gate refers to the Dui trigram, Dui being the image of Qian’s metal gate; the Qian horse driving the Metal Gate symbolizes the *Guai* hexagram, when Yang qi is already abundant.\nThe original palace refers to the Gen trigram, Gen being the image of Kun earth harnessing wood as its palace; the Kun ox entering its original palace symbolizes the *Bo* hexagram, when Yin essence is already abundant.\nThe Alchemical Maiden refers to the single Yin atop *Bo*, returning to her dwelling to form Kun; the Metal Elder refers to the *Guai* image.\n\"Ah, who escorts the Alchemical Maiden to wed the Metal Elder?\" echoes the alchemical saying of \"half a catty matching eight ounces.\"\nFor the four Yang hexagrams contain eight Yang lines as half a catty, while the four Yin hexagrams contain eight Yin lines as eight ounces—together they form the eight trigrams as a full catty.\nThis speaks of the moment when Yin and Yang are equally robust: without the habitual reverence of sincerity and the tempered resolve of unwavering faith, who could withdraw the heart to conceal it in secrecy, allowing the single Yang atop *Bo* to naturally pair with *Guai* to form Qian, even as the single Yin atop *Guai* returns to *Bo* to form Kun?\nThus, the body fully embodies Kun’s compliance to nurture qi, while the spirit returns to Qian’s steadfastness to govern form.\nFrom this, the origins of generation and life are renewed, cycling through *Gou* and *Fu*, their transformations boundless.\nHere, the meaning of the next chapter’s \"cavern chamber generating auspicious qi\" is also elucidated, appearing more direct.\nYet in the highest alchemical teachings, earlier masters framed their words within the principles of the *Yijing*, not through hexagrams or lines, but by pointing directly to concrete realities, making them accessible to all.\nFor those with prior learning, one may observe the images and ponder the words to penetrate the profound meaning; for beginners, however, language laden with classical allusions may instead obstruct their perception.\nThus, in annotating this text, it is fitting to focus on the tangible elements within the human body, speaking plainly and concretely, so that all may see and know without needing to seek images or delve into abstractions—thereby upholding our teacher’s compassionate vow of universal deliverance.\nThis chapter, prompted by the \"Metal Gate\" and \"Wood Palace\" images left unaddressed in the primary commentary, clarifies their meaning lest it be lost to heterodox interpretations. It thus employs the *Guai* and *Bo* hexagrams to illustrate their mutual transformation into *Gou* and *Fu*, averting the calamity of excess and the regret of overweening Yang. May all reflect upon this.\n\n○ Above, Chapter Ten.\nThis elaborates on the preceding chapter’s principle of reverting to the primordial, all depending on the habitual practice of concealing correct mindfulness.\nFor since the initial coalescence of the elixir’s essence, spirit and qi have grown daily stronger, gradually enabling the separation of the embryo—one must then redouble efforts to preserve abundance, conceal spirit, and nurture qi.\n\nThe Alchemical Maiden is but sixteen, the Metal Elder precisely nine-three.\nThe Alchemical Maiden symbolizes the qi transformed from my Yin essence, sixteen being the number of a full catty, denoting sufficient measure.\nThe Metal Elder symbolizes the spirit congealed from my Yang qi, nine-three signifying inner Yang’s fulfillment, akin to Qian’s inner trigram reaching its third line.\nThis speaks of the stage in elixir refinement when the body’s spirit and qi are both robust, poised to separate the embryo—yet often unsettled by restlessness, if one indulges impatience, qi will agitate the heart, and the Valley Spirit will struggle to remain tranquil.\nNothing full fails to overflow, so the text specifies \"precisely sixteen\" and \"exactly nine-three\" to clarify the firing times, teaching one to remain vigilant in due season, neither arrogant nor anxious. Thus, inner beauty is contained, anger and desire do not arise, and the embryo’s separation incurs no fault.\n\nThe cavern chamber generates auspicious qi, their joyous union produces the firstborn son.\nThe cavern chamber symbolizes my body, the secret aperture within.\n\"Generating auspicious qi\" refers to the vigorous stirring of Yang qi within my body, the very sign of primordial life’s return and the nascent foundation of Yang spirit.\n\"Producing the firstborn son\" speaks of the initial conception of Yang spirit, like *Zhen* as the eldest son, superimposed upon Qian to form the image of *Lei Tian Da Zhuang*—a single Yang stirring in the outer trigram.\nAt this stage, with the body’s qi already robust and the spirit further concealed, Yang qi suddenly surges, instantly uniting with the spirit. In that moment, the Valley Spirit transforms into Yang spirit.\n\nJust as the firstborn son is newly born, this is the return of primordial life—here the Valley Spirit achieves success, and one may preserve the spirit to attain immortality.\n\n**Chapter Eleven.**\nThis describes the phenomenon of primordial life’s return, elucidating the Dao of natural embryo separation. Should one read this and attain realization:\nWhen Yang flourishes to the point of overcoming, this is the image of the *Guài* hexagram. Swiftly withdrawing and concealing oneself, the upper trigram reverts to the initial Yang. This is what Confucius meant by “knowing the future and concealing the past.” *Guài* interchanges with *Gòu*, just as *Bō* interchanges with *Fù*—from this, Yang spirit takes its foundational birth. Only then does one understand why the “use of nine” and “use of six” are both auspicious and without regret.\n\n---\n\nLast night on the western riverbank,\nToad-light illumined the jade-green waves.\nGathered and brought to the jade chamber,\nWithin the crucible, the sun’s searing blaze.\n\n“Last night” refers to the time of primordial life’s return. The West is the *Kǎn* hexagram’s primordial position; *Kǎn* is Water, hence “western river.” The toad, originally lunar radiance, is called “toad-light” to symbolize the upward breakthrough of Yang qi. Whenever the text speaks of the Yang spirit’s initial foundation, it invariably compares it to the toad, alluding to its three legs and the upward breakthrough of Yang light. The “jade-green waves” symbolize the post-heaven bodily image of the *Kǎn* hexagram’s qi—*Kǎn* Water is inherently black, but when illuminated by toad-light, the water turns jade-green, hence “jade-green waves.” The “jade chamber” symbolizes my body, for once primordial life has returned, spirit and qi become dense and refined, thus called the jade chamber. “Within the crucible” refers to the spirit chamber. “Searing blaze” alludes to the method of “refining with focused qi” and “tempering through non-delusion.” It means that in the past, my primordial life’s return arose from the post-heaven *Kǎn* image’s abundant spirit and qi. Suddenly, Yang qi surged upward, breaking through the Celestial Valley, merging with spirit to transform into Yang spirit. Now, the body has reverted to the primordial, the *Kūn* image has resumed its northern position, and *Kǎn* has retreated to the West. Tracing back, it is like last night on the western riverbank, witnessing the toad’s light illuminating the water. I then gathered it and brought it into the spirit chamber, refining it so that it seethes and tempers itself—yet one feels only a gentle warmth, with no visible sign of searing blaze. Thus, it transforms into Yang spirit, and life is restored! This is the Dao of the jade tally preserving the spirit, so the Valley Spirit may not die.\n\n**Chapter Twelve.**\nThis continues from the previous chapter, stating that once primordial life has returned, one must preserve and harmonize the Great Harmony to ensure proper advantage.\n\n---\n\n*Lí* and *Kǎn* do not copulate,\n*Qián* and *Kūn* spontaneously generate.\nOne who understands this principle\nLets a single point descend into the Yellow Court.\n\nIt means that in the past, my post-heaven heart and body united, nominally called “conjunction,” like the sun and moon conjoining in the same palace—yet not true copulation. At this moment of life’s return, though called the copulation of *Qián* and *Kūn*, it is merely spirit congealing and qi gathering, naturally generating a perfect Great Ultimate. Should one grasp this principle, then all that the alchemical classics describe—“a single Yang within the body, a single Yin within the heart,” referring to two things—are but different names for the same origin. Their encounter naturally merges into a single right thought; when thought subsides and returns to the hidden, it descends into the Yellow Court. The Yellow Court refers to a single aperture, the very secret place—yellow being the central true color, and court signifying the void and empty expanse, hence the name. Yet one must not seek it through form or appearance.\n\n**Chapter Thirteen.**\n\nBuilding upon the preceding chapters, this elucidates the essential principle that the beginning and end of the alchemical Dao all arise from spontaneity, and that the two must merge into one.\n\nWithin the Cinnabar Valley, spirit-water is born;\nIn the Yellow Court lies the Great Granary.\nNo longer thoughts of hunger or thirst arise—\nStraightaway one enters the immortal realm.\n\nThe Cinnabar Valley is another name for the Crimson Palace within the human body; the Yellow Court has already been discussed in the previous chapter. Here it is said that the central valley naturally generates qi, which spirals upward from the lower valley to meet the spirit, thereby producing spirit-water that irrigates the entire body. Thus, the Valley Spirit also receives qi in audience, just as the Great Granary ceaselessly stores and then releases spirit-water to fill the whole body. Within the body, there is naturally a nectar that irrigates without thirst, without any appearance of overflow; the Valley Spirit itself possesses a sustenance that sates without hunger, without any form of accumulation. Knowing this, one may dispense with all worldly theories of nourishment, and the heart will be free from any fear of hunger or thirst. If even hunger and thirst need not be feared, what other thoughts could arise? One may then settle the mind and withdraw, directly reaching the immortal realm—this is the teaching of a single thought unarisen, all illusions at rest.\n\nThis continues the above chapters, instructing one to hold fast to the right thought, withdraw into the hidden as the work, and never allow the mind to stray into other concerns, lest one err on the great path to immortality.\n\nThe intent-steed returns to the spirit-chamber;\nThe heart-ape guards the grotto-chamber.\nWith single-minded withdrawal, the spirit naturally does not scatter—once returned to the hidden, it is the Heavenly Heart. All conditions released, the heart abides within the body; seizing this state of non-doing, it too withdraws into the hidden.\n\nSpirit, essence, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent—\nTransform into Purple Gold Frost.\nEssence is stored in the kidneys; when kidney qi is complete, essence rests securely in the kidney viscus, and one attains wisdom.\nSpirit is stored in the heart; when heart qi is complete, spirit rests securely in the heart viscus, and one attains propriety.\nThe ethereal soul is stored in the liver; when liver qi is complete, the ethereal soul rests securely in the liver viscus, and one attains benevolence.\nThe corporeal soul is stored in the lungs; when lung qi is complete, the corporeal soul rests securely in the lung viscus, and one attains righteousness.\nIntent is stored in the spleen; when spleen qi is complete, intent rests securely in the spleen viscus, and one attains trustworthiness.\nThus, the five viscera each hold one qi and each possess one virtue. If one can make intent sincere and the heart upright, then the five qi are all complete and each rests in its proper viscus, and the five virtues are also complete. This is the Confucian teaching of \"unity throughout\" and \"withdrawal into the hidden,\" which is the alchemical method of gathering the five phases into a single aperture. When the five qi converge as one, they can congeal into spirit—this spirit is the elixir. The \"elixir\" of the Quanzhen school is what the Confucian school calls \"benevolence,\" like the kernel within a fruit. It is called \"purple\" because the initial golden elixir is formed from the union of water and fire—water is black, fire is red, and their intermingling produces purple, as when Master Guan Yin saw Laozi’s qi as purple. It is not called \"elixir\" but \"frost\" lest one cling to the word and mistake it for a physical pellet, thereby accumulating delusive thoughts and causing qi blockages in the body, which would be a grave error. Thus, it is likened to frost formed from scattered dew: visible in its traces yet ungraspable when gathered, evoking the image of empty space pulverized. This describes the wondrous arising of the golden elixir within the formless to become true form—hence, Purple Gold Frost.\n\nThese two chapters further demonstrate that human cultivation and nurturance share the same work as heaven and earth. How so?\n\nHeaven suspends its images to cover all things, yet it nurtures only the imageless—thus its images grow ever more luminous, perpetually covering the myriad things without end. Earth solidifies its form to bear all things, yet it nurtures only the formless—thus its form grows ever more vast and deep, perpetually bearing the myriad things without leakage. Man dwells in form to complete all things, yet if he can nurture the formless, his form will endure ever longer, encompassing the transformations of heaven and earth without transgression, shaping the myriad things without omission. Thus may he attain longevity and lasting vision, his wisdom pervading all categories, his blessings flowing beyond the world, standing as the third between heaven and earth.\n\nMaster Bai Zi once said: *\"If man is not burdened by form, the world before his eyes is the Great Luo Heaven.\"* He also said: *\"Forget form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness, forget emptiness to merge with the Dao.\"* This single word \"forget\" is itself the absence of things. *\"Originally there was not a single thing—where could dust alight?\"* Why then cling to distinctions of what is essence, what is spirit, what is hun or po or intent? All returns to the single secret of nurturing the formless. Simply allow the natural flow of qi-transformation to fulfill the utmost sincerity of one’s inherent nature without cease.\n\nThe above concludes Chapter Fifteen. This continues the themes of the preceding chapters, elucidating the immaterial nature of the golden elixir and instructing how to begin the work. It is nothing more than sincerity without duality, nurturing the formless to merge with the imageless and formless—then true qi naturally flows through heaven and earth, and primordial spirit naturally gathers within the body, all achieved through the wondrous subtlety of inherent clarity and stillness. This is what Li Níwán called the *\"Three-One Sound-Symbol\"* and what Master Zhang referred to as *\"Grasping the foundation of Kan and Li, the three realms return to one body.\"*\n\nFrom the first chapter to this point, the text forms a comprehensive summation. The following nine chapters expound upon the key apertures and the nurturing of the elixir, further clarifying the meanings of the preceding chapters.\n\n---\n\nOne aperture, three passes—the three passes are the crucial junctures.\nSuddenly moving lightly, the divine water flows throughout.\n\nThis \"one aperture\" refers to the single aperture where the seven orifices return to their root. The \"three passes\" denote the refinement of essence into qi as the lower pass, the refinement of qi into spirit as the middle pass, and the refinement of spirit into emptiness as the upper pass—the highest-grade path of elixir refinement. Some identify the three passes as the post-mortem locations of the tailbone, spine, and jade pillow (lower, middle, upper), while others locate them in the front of the body as the magpie bridge, cinnabar palace, and pass of origin (upper, middle, lower). Our tradition also adopts this interpretation for its utility in establishing the foundation: dredging the Governing and Conception Vessels to dissolve long-standing illnesses and impurities, thereby enabling the later unimpeded flow of true qi. Yet this is achieved solely through emptying thoughts and forgetting emotions, without further contrivance. Here, however, the \"three passes\" need not be confined to such interpretations.\n\nThe \"aperture\" refers precisely to this single aperture within the true body—the pivotal juncture where essence accumulates, qi gathers, and spirit congeals. Simply abide in emptiness and stillness, nurturing to the point of formlessness, and suddenly the lead and mercury respond in unison, essence having transformed into qi, naturally ascending to the valley—this is the five qi returning to the origin. At that moment, spirit and qi interact, qi transforms into spirit, spirit congeals and qi gathers, then transmutes into divine water suffusing the entire body—this is divine water entering the flower pool. Allow it to circulate and move without pause, naturally and spontaneously, beyond the grasp of cognition, while one’s spirit remains settled in unshakable stillness—hence the three flowers gathering at the crown.\n\nThrough this, I realized that the transformation of essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness to merge with the Dao depends solely on the mutual forgetting of heart and breath within the formless and insubstantial. The method begins with interdependence, gradually withdrawing into concealment. From this interdependence in nothingness, concealment itself is forgotten in the moment when nothing remains to conceal—this is mutual forgetting. Profound and ever-quiescent, this is the transformation into emptiness. When quiescence reaches the point of no-quiescence, this is the refinement of emptiness to merge with the Dao.\n\nMy teacher, Master Taixu, once said: *\"The study of heavenly immortality revolves around the three—essence, qi, and spirit—turning within a single aperture, like a child in the womb, unmeasured and unweighed, the mother nurturing the fetus without effort, mother and child mutually forgetting yet at peace. It is like a pearl in a crystal dish, rolling and glistening, naturally round and radiant, with no dregs or obstructions within. Unlike other elixir methods that rigidly prescribe set times for refining essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness—failing to grasp the secret of this single-aperture turning point—they cannot attain such intimate and authentic practice, resorting instead to trivial techniques, idle words, and arbitrary schedules to deceive and mislead.\"*\n\nOur tradition’s heart-transmission is the highest-grade elixir method. For our lineage’s heart-transmission necessarily takes the merging and transformation of spirit as the work of heavenly immortality. Thus, when examining the treasures of the school, every detail is clarified with concrete evidence. When instructing practitioners, they are first taught to seek the master within, to proceed with utmost sincerity and diligence, with utter simplicity and honesty. Only then, when beginning the elixir refinement, will subduing the tiger and dragon, refining the hun and po, become effortless. Returning to the secret of the single aperture, one directly reaches the source of the three passes—no longer difficult. Thus, the great returning elixir of golden liquid can be accomplished in three hundred days.\n\nAll my fellow practitioners, I urge you not to be misled: do not mistakenly fixate on a cavity beside the spleen, imagining qi ascending and descending, calling it \"qi steaming,\" \"essence dripping,\" \"spirit numinous,\" or \"emptiness void\"—such misconceptions uproot the source and exacerbate errors.\n\nAs if starving and eating salt, only to grow more parched—such practice ensures one will never refine essence into spirit, nor attain the moment of refining emptiness to merge with the Dao. Idle sitting wastes qi and wearies the spirit, unaware that the foundation of the elixir is laid in an instant, that the workings of creation are enacted within the body. How lamentable this is.\n\n**Chapter Sixteen (conclusion)**\nThis chapter reveals the secret of the single aperture that turns the mechanism, and particularly clarifies the principle of blending qi and essence to refine them into spirit—entirely the subtle efficacy of nurturing the formless through quiescence and profound stillness.\n\nTo restrain the *po* is not the heart’s restraint; how could the *hun* be bound by intention?\nWhen one nurtures the formless, the *shen* of consciousness dies while the *gu shen* (Valley Spirit) lives.\nThe *gu shen* lives, thus passions fade; passions fade, and the *po* is extinguished!\nIndeed, only one who has first mastered the heart can restrain it—the heart itself cannot restrain the *po*.\nWhen form is forgotten, the seven apertures become still while the single aperture shines.\nThe single aperture shines, thus nature manifests; nature manifests, and the *hun* is stored!\nOnly one who holds to this intention can bind it—how could intention itself bind the *hun*?\n\n**Chapter Seventeen**\nOnly abide in spirit and qi, and in a fleeting moment the Mysterious Pearl is formed.\nThe *hun* stored, thus spirit is whole; the *po* extinguished, thus qi is full.\nSpirit and qi interact and naturally congeal.\n\"Mysterious\" reflects its profound abyss; \"pearl\" reflects its luminous purity—hence it is called the Mysterious Pearl.\n\n**Chapter Seventeen (conclusion)**\nThis continues the previous chapter, expounding that by nurturing the formless, qi naturally becomes abundant and spirit naturally finds its refuge.\n\nThe oral instructions are few; the elixir is refined in a moment.\nThis speaks of the elixir-refining oral instructions—namely, the two lines from the previous chapter, \"Only abide in spirit and qi\"—where the meaning lies entirely in the phrase \"few in number\" and the \"fleeting moment.\"\nYet how spirit and qi are to be conjoined, how in a fleeting moment they congeal, has its own simple and easy method—precisely what the original preface to *The Stone Tablet* calls \"no more than half a phrase.\"\nWhen the practitioner’s effort is pure and mature, wisdom arises from concentration, and one naturally awakens, seizing the initiative—what is called \"attaining it without the least exertion.\"\n\nGently stoking the fire’s timing, after ten months the infant is born.\nRather than idly tending the elixir furnace to watch the fire’s timing,\nsimply settle the spirit and rest the breath, allowing nature to take its course.\nWhen qi is focused and thought is still, no error arises.\nNurturing it for three hundred days, it naturally becomes lively as an infant emerging from the womb,\nmanifesting the image of \"the dragon seen in the field\"—a metaphorical expression.\n\n○ Above: Chapter Eighteen.\nThis continues the preceding two chapters to introduce the intent of the following six.\nThe previous two chapters spoke of gathering and conjoining; this chapter highlights the two words \"oral instructions,\"\nand teaches that when applying the instructions, the fire’s timing must be gentle.\nThe next six chapters will elaborate on bathing, the division of the embryo, gentle nurturing, and the completion of the elixir.\n\nThe husband and wife first unite in joy, and as the years deepen, their affection grows more profound.\nAuspicious qi arises in the bridal chamber, where spring winds blow without cease.\nThe husband and wife symbolize heart and body; the bridal chamber, the single aperture; the spring winds, gentleness.\nThis speaks of how body and heart, initially congealed by essence and qi into spirit, already feel inseparable in their union.\nAfter refining through firing and bathing, accumulated over days and months, their harmonious affection deepens beyond its initial state.\nIn their constant communion, true qi naturally steams and bathes them, its warmth as gentle as sitting amid spring winds.\nReaders must not let the words obscure the meaning.\n\nMaster Zixian Xue has a song:\n*\"True husband, true wife,\nWhen Kan’s man and Li’s woman unite in resonance,\nThe sky is empty, the earth dew-laden, without a speck of dust.\"*\nThis depicts the luminous scene within the single aperture—how could the slightest dust of mundane perception remain?\n\n○ Above: Chapter Nineteen.\n\nThis continues from the preceding chapter, speaking of how prolonged firing and refining naturally give rise to the bathing of true qi, its warmth still taken as the standard—seemingly no different from the function of firing and refining. Yet one must understand: once the medicine coalesces within, the initial application of fire must be meticulous, and this is called \"firing and refining.\" Later, when true qi constantly ascends in audience, suffusing the entire body, its warmth and moisture are called \"bathing.\" Thus, firing and refining arise from the regulation of fire, while bathing is the natural power of the medicine. This is why Master Bai speaks of \"taking activity and stillness as advance and retreat\"—firing and refining are activity, bathing is stillness. Activity is the advance of fire, where there is use within the absence of use; stillness is the retreat of fire, where effort is applied within the effortlessness of prior effort. This must not be overlooked.\n\nSudden rain on paper butterflies,\nGolden furnace with jade peonies.\nAt midnight, a red sun blazes,\nIn the sixth month, pristine frost chills.\n\nThe first line depicts peril, the second danger; midnight signifies cold, the sixth month heat. The red sun dispels cold, pristine frost dissolves heat. This speaks of how, in the flourishing stage of the elixir path, one is often inclined toward movement rather than stillness, yet the fire regulation must occur in a state of non-doing and non-action. If the spirit is truly settled and still, with no thoughts arising within thought, the work is pure and nothing need be feared. But if one’s prior refinement of the self remains impure, upon reaching this state of non-doing, thoughts will inevitably stir, causing the spirit to scatter outward. The peril is like paper butterflies caught in sudden rain; the body grows cold as midnight. One must then draw upon the warmth of the red sun to dispel it, so the spirit returns to the Celestial Valley, the cold recedes, and warmth is restored. If thoughts grow restless, the spirit turns volatile, the danger like jade peonies cast into a golden furnace; the heart burns as in the sixth month. One must then draw upon the chill of pristine dew to quell it, so qi returns to the Crimson Palace, and restlessness naturally subsides into moisture. The key is to maintain no-thought within thought, movement rooted in stillness, always keeping warmth and moisture as the measure. Yet how can one obtain the sun at midnight or frost in the sixth month? If one seeks remedial methods at this stage, how can they be effective?\n\nOne must realize: midnight is precisely the *zi* hour, the sixth month when the sun is at *wu*. Cold is always likened to midnight, heat to the sixth month—these vivid warnings of danger from reckless movement also subtly reveal the opportune moment for timely adjustment. If one awakens to the location of the primordial embryo, one may then proceed to regulate it. For those who have not yet grasped the method, read the next chapter.\n\n○ Above: Chapter Twenty.\n\nThis continues from the preceding chapter, speaking of how, during the cessation of fire and bathing, all depends on the spirit’s stillness and qi’s movement to achieve fullness and ultimately part the embryo. If thoughts stir and qi scatters, peril arises—this is why Master Bai insists on \"taking discontinuity and lack of focus as a dike.\" Herein lies the insight.\n\nThose whose prior refinement of the self runs deep will not suffer this affliction. Those with the aspiration to cultivate the elixir—can they not first rouse vigilance?\n\nFire flies from the sea’s depths,\nEarthen springs flow from mountain peaks.\nIn a moment, union is achieved,\nThe jade crucible emits blue smoke.\n\nThe sea’s depths signify the *weilu*, mountain peaks the crown of the head. Golden fire is the fire of life, earthen springs the water of nature. \"Union achieved\" describes the harmony and balance attained in secrecy; the jade crucible is this single aperture of mystery, and the rising blue smoke is the sign of warmth and transformation.\n\nThis continues from the preceding chapter, addressing how to obtain the sun at midnight: one must direct the true command to fly the pure yang *qian*-gold fire of *kan* from the sea’s depths at the *weilu*, ascending to the crown and returning to *qian*—like the blazing red sun suffusing the body with harmony. How to obtain frost in the sixth month? One must guide the pure yin *kun*-earth springs of *li* from the mountain peak downward, returning to the sea and reverting to *kun*—like pristine frost’s chill bringing warmth and moisture throughout the body. Though expressed in two lines, it is in truth a single process: ascending from below to return to *qian* is called \"flying golden fire,\" while descending from above to return to *kun* is called \"flowing earthen springs.\" This is the method of \"advancing fire and retreating tally\" described in other elixir texts. Through such adjustment, in but a moment the entire body attains warmth and harmony, just as the crucible emits smoke—no further pursuit of qi is needed. Yet this is ultimately not natural but a last resort for remedy. Otherwise, the treasure should not be lightly toyed with, as Master Zhang has warned in detail.\n\nIn sum, the study of human nature and life (*xingming*) lies entirely in guarding the mind like a fortress. Thus, when King Wen expounded the third line of *Kun* in the *Yijing*, he appended the phrase \"containing brilliance, it may be steadfast.\" ○ Chapter Twenty-One. This continues the preceding chapter, elucidating the method of remedy.\n\nIn my humble view: The nineteenth chapter above expounded the proper way of natural bathing; these two chapters teach the means to remedy deviations, which is why Master Bai spoke of the practices of \"operation, withdrawal, and replenishment.\"\n\nBreak open the Gate of the Mysterious Origin; surge through the Barrier of Chaos.\nThe \"Gate of the Mysterious Origin\" refers to the singular aperture of the mysterious image. \"Break open\" means to return the seven apertures to their root in this one aperture, whereupon it suddenly opens wide, and one directly perceives the original True Unity—rooted before the myriad phenomena, penetrating the inner and outer of the physical form, utterly void and utterly nonexistent, most wondrous and most mysterious. One feels only boundless obscurity beyond measure by inches, vast expanse beyond confinement by shores; its greatness has no exterior, its smallness no interior. It encompasses heaven and earth, yet enters the finest hairtip. Above, there is no further color; below, no further abyss. A single thing is perfectly complete, manifesting through the ages—this is the moment when the singular aperture unifies the seven, and the Mysterious Barrier stands fully open.\n\nThe \"Barrier of Chaos\" describes the time when *qi* has grown abundant, and the yang spirit dwells alone in the Celestial Valley, receiving the homage of *qi*, yet remaining in a state of primal undifferentiation, like a lump at the threshold of chaos. \"Surge through\" means that at this stage, the elixir’s power is sufficient, the fire’s force is complete, so vast and unyielding that it cannot remain hidden. One’s Valley Spirit has already beheld the Mysterious Origin, and the true aperture suddenly bursts open, whereupon the center glows with penetrating principle. Rightly positioned within the body, its *qi* courses through heaven and earth, its spirit commands the Dharma-body. Suddenly, one feels thunder’s roar and lightning’s flash, shaking heaven and earth; immediately, the hundred meridians bristle, the Three Passes are fully opened, the entire body becomes pure yang, and the form grows fiery hot—this is the true scene, not a metaphor.\n\nThe preceding line dissolves the former toil of refining thoughts and cleansing the mind through the six-day cycle, returning all to the root in a single stroke. The following line then directly points to the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, unifying the seven in the one, nurturing it straightaway without harm—what Laozi called \"returning the report,\" saying \"serene, serene\" and \"restoring life.\" Only at this point is the original life fully restored!\n\nIn short: In the postnatal realm, it pertains to body and mind, and the work must proceed from movement to stillness to return to one’s prenatal state. Upon returning to the prenatal, it pertains to nature and life, and the work naturally shifts from extreme stillness to movement, exhibiting the image of \"leaping in the abyss.\" Without the foundation of \"day and night, establishing life in profound secrecy,\" how could one attain this?\n\nYet knowing only to refine water and fire, one lets tiger and dragon coil at will. The refining of water and fire is precisely the work of gentle nurturing, as will be explained in the next chapter. The tiger originally symbolized the body, but here symbolizes qi; the dragon originally symbolized the mind, but here symbolizes spirit. At this stage, the mysterious aperture has already opened—no need to seclude oneself in the colored body for hidden cultivation. Yet the original nature remains unrecovered, just like the ninth-fourth line in the outer trigram of Qian. Confucius called this: \"No constancy in rising or falling, no permanence in advancing or retreating.\" One cannot ascend to join Heaven, nor descend to embrace Earth; one has not yet advanced to merge with the Dao, nor retreated to preserve the body. This is the time of congealing yet unsettled, when one can only gather the sack within, gently nurturing the sagely work.\n\nLike the spring first welling beneath the mountain in *Meng*, the noble one, through resolute action, cultivates virtue to nurture its stability as water. Like the fire first kindling beneath the mountain in *Bi*, the noble one, through illuminating governance, dares not adjudicate disputes, nurturing its wisdom as fire. In such refinement, one must proceed to the end without presuming completion.\n\nThus, in the perfect formula of *Heavenly Immortals’ Heart Transmission*, I say: \"Guard the Three Powers as an egg; yellow is the field of fortune. I dwell within, blending and transforming Kun and Qian.\" This means still congealing spirit and qi in the sincerity of unwavering unity, enclosing nature and life within the aperture of emptiness and spontaneity. Let tiger and dragon coil together, awaiting the meeting of wind and cloud—only then may one hope for the elixir’s completion.\n\n*(Lin’s note: My teacher once told others, \"To seek the essentials of the Golden Elixir, study the Qian and Kun of the *Zhouyi*, and the Dao will be complete.\" I, Lin, once read the sixth line of Kun and the ninth of Qian, and awakened to the method of gathering and refining. Reading the first line of Qian alongside the first of Kun, I understood the way of congealing and binding. Reading the second line of Qian alongside the second of Kun, I grasped the way of refining and tempering. Reading the third line of Qian alongside the third of Kun, I knew the way of bathing and cleansing. Reading the fourth line of Qian alongside the fourth of Kun, I saw that once the embryo is divided, one must proceed with gentle nurturing. Reading the fifth line of Kun alongside the fifth of Qian, I attained the way of elixir completion. Re-reading the sixth line of Kun and the ninth of Qian, alongside the ‘using nine’ and ‘using six,’ I finally awakened to the way of transcending life and death. Thus, the Duke of Zhou composed the *Tuan* to let people contemplate its oracles, while Confucius supplemented it with the *Xiang*, *Tuanzhuan*, and *Wenyan* to elucidate its subtleties—truly one may observe the images, know the changes, contemplate the words, and understand the oracles!)*\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Two (Continued)**\nThis follows the preceding chapter, speaking of how, once bathing is complete, there naturally arises the Way of embryo division—precisely what Master Bai referred to as \"shifting the spirit to exchange the crucible.\" In truth, there is nothing to divide, nothing to shift; it is only that knowledge and perception expand until heaven and humanity are no longer separate, spirit and qi fill until self and other are without boundary. Yet one must nurture with gentle warmth until maturity is reached, only then will the elixir be complete.\n\nHowever, the work of gentle nurturing is difficult to bring to fruition within a set time—this depends on whether one’s usual practice of vigilance in solitude is pure, which determines its swiftness or slowness.\n\n*In the Sakaṭa’s waters, fire;*\n*On Kunlun’s peak, waves.*\n*Who can fathom its operation?*\n*The great intent lies with the Yellow Dame.*\n\n\"In the Sakaṭa’s waters\" points to the sea’s depths; \"on Kunlun’s peak\" points to the mountain’s summit. Though these two lines appear identical to the first couplet of Chapter Twenty-One, previously the words \"flying and circulating\" described the method of internal restoration within the physical form. Here, however, the spirit has already settled into its proper position to consolidate life, and qi has penetrated both within and without. One now knows that within the sea of Sakaṭa lies the treasure of one’s wisdom-life, and that atop Kunlun’s summit dwells the abode of one’s settled nature. There is no east or west, no distance; neither water nor fire ascends or descends. One simply allows the vast, upright qi to flow of itself, while all things grow together in the sacred work of gentle nurturing. Its operation differs greatly from the time before the barrier was opened. All that is required is a steadfast, reverent, and careful adherence to the great intent—never allowing flightiness or restlessness to disturb the body’s constant ease. In harmonious radiance, seated in unity, one may naturally await the return of the original nature.\n\nMaster Zixian Xue composed a song:\n*\"Water is true water, fire is true fire,*\n*As before, awaiting the season, circulating the celestial sphere.*\n*In harmony, refined to perfection—*\n*The treasure of long life.\"*\n\nThis may serve to illuminate its operation.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**\n\nBuilding upon the preceding chapter, this further elucidates the Dao of gentle nurturing and sustaining fullness.\n\nThe elixir is drawn from the primordial qi,\nThe fire sought from the essence of the Great One.\nTo know the elixir is to take the fire—\nWithin stillness, the cinnabar is formed.\n\nThe \"elixir\" refers to the qi of the five: spirit, essence, soul,魄, and intent. When the five qi flow as one to return to the origin, they coalesce into the nebulous primordial spirit of undifferentiated simplicity, and the body then contains the pure yang qi—this is the primordial qi. The \"fire\" refers to the radiance of the three treasures: essence, qi, and spirit. When the three radiances transform in unison and gather at the crown, they inwardly congeal the essence of the Great One containing truth, and the heart then holds the pure yin essence—this is the essence of the Great One.\n\nOur fellow disciple Qu Jun observed: *\"In the* Spring and Autumn Unification Diagram*, the five stars of the North Pole reside in the Purple Tenuity Palace, which is the essence of the Great One, the celestial chamber of the Heavenly Emperor. Its position, slightly south of and near the Heavenly One, corresponds precisely to the crown of a person’s head, thus enabling direct resonance and infusion into the heart.\"* This principle is indeed well-founded, for it is the very origin of the primordial union of yin and yang at the moment of a person’s birth.\n\nI have further verified this with Chapter Seventeen, which describes what is obtained at this stage as the *\"marrow of Heaven and Earth.\"* Heaven and Earth are the Supreme Ultimate, so the Great One’s root in the Supreme Ultimate is precisely what He Quzi described as *\"the Supreme Ultimate flowing its essence in profound obscurity.\"* Yet the Supreme Ultimate is invisible, so it is likened to the Great One that governs Heaven. Thus, the essence of the Great One in the Purple Tenuity Palace is clearly the essence flowing from the Supreme Ultimate—rightly called the marrow of Heaven and Earth. However, this need not be discussed in detail.\n\nIn essence, human qi is originally interconnected with Heaven’s qi. At this stage of cultivation, one constantly fuses the true qi of the five returning to the origin with the primordial spirit of the three radiances gathering at the crown. Abiding in unbroken continuity, with the heart as still as ashes, one naturally awaits the return of the original nature. This is to seek the essence of the Great One as fire and gather the primordial qi as the elixir. With fire to refine the elixir, within stillness the cinnabar is formed—just as Bai Zi said: *\"It may be met without intent, but cannot be sought with intent.\"*\n\nThus, Master Zixian Xue composed a song:\n*\"The elixir is no thing, the fire no season—*\n*Clearly, it is but a single spark of yang,*\n*Refined into boundless life through ten thousand kalpas.\"*\n\nWe need only guard it in the formless clarity of stillness, and naturally the fire will forge the spirit into perfection—this is *\"within stillness, the cinnabar is formed.\"* If one seeks with knowledge, it is like Zhuangzi’s *\"Yellow Emperor losing the dark pearl,\"* sending knowledge to seek it in vain.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThis chapter, building upon Chapter Twenty-Three, clarifies that from gathering the elixir to the formation of the cinnabar, the process does not depart from the simple Dao of Qian and Kun—methods that are easy to know and simple to practice. With the right mindfulness, in natural stillness and undivided purity, after three hundred days of effort, one may thereafter roam beyond the world, playfully wandering among mortals, coming and going without obstruction, in harmony with the natural Dao.\n\nI note: From the first chapter to this twenty-fourth, the discourse on the cinnabar Dao is now complete. However, in explaining the stages of transmutation, gathering, union, refinement, bathing, as well as embryo division and gentle nurturing, one cannot avoid using metaphors, nor can distinctions be omitted for clarity. Yet I fear that later practitioners may cling to the words and become mired in imagery, mistaking it for something tangible and deliberate, thus failing to awaken suddenly. Even if they grasp its truth, they may still err in thinking the two (elixir and fire) must be used together, fixating on the labor of ascent and descent without realizing their unity. Even if they understand unity, they may yet cling to distinctions between inner and outer after refining the Valley Spirit, unaware that the true body originally encompasses form and dharma as one, inherently transparent within and without.\n\nTherefore, the following text will further expound upon Chapter Twenty-Four to clarify the central meaning of the preceding chapters. Though it occasionally employs metaphors drawn from things, its every passage dispels doubts, and each chapter reveals the true teaching. Its lingering resonance carries meaning beyond words—profound and far-reaching, it merits deep contemplation.\n\nThe primordial qi—how to ingest it?\nTrue essence—no need to shift.\nTrue essence and primordial qi,\nThese are the foundation of the Great Elixir.\n\nWhat I speak of is the qi produced within my body—formless primordial qi, unlike tangible food that can be discussed in terms of how to consume it. The essence born of my heart is immaterial true essence, unlike external objects that are solid and heavy, and thus requires no transference.\n\nIf one can know the medicine and grasp the fire, one knows that medicine is fire and fire is medicine. True essence and primordial qi are one yet two, two yet one. Clearly, they form the foundation of the Great Elixir!\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Five.**\nThis chapter continues from the previous twenty-four, clarifying that the foundation of the Elixir lies solely in the union of these two—essence and qi—with no need for external seeking.\n\n---\n\nConfucians elucidate nature and principle,\nBuddhists strike at empty nothingness.\nUnacquainted with the immortal’s art,\nThe Golden Elixir’s work is momentary.\n\nThis speaks of how, in that era, both the sagely Dao and Buddhist Dharma lacked true transmitters. Confucians merely clarified nature and principle without investigating the primordial mandate as the root of nature. Buddhists merely struck at empty nothingness without exploring the primordial nature as the source of mandate. Thus, they failed to recognize the immortal’s all-pervading Way.\n\nWhat is called refining medicine with fire to form the Elixir is simply guiding qi with spirit to achieve the Dao—this is exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining mandate. Alas!\n\nThe former sages of Confucianism composed the *Zhouyi* and the *Zhongyong*; the World-Honored One of Buddhism expounded the *Vajra* and the *Perfect Awakening*. If one takes these and examines them together, one will know that the immortal’s art of the Golden Elixir is the art of benevolence. It can, in an instant, establish the foundation of transformation for the entire body.\n\nWhat the earlier Confucians called \"comprehending the one and completing all things\"—only then does one realize that since ancient times, the world has never had two Ways, and the sages of the Three Teachings have never had two hearts.\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Six.**\nThis chapter, following the preceding text, laments that people do not know how to unite essence and qi to form the Elixir. With profound compassion, it sharply admonishes the followers of the Three Teachings, urging them to explore the transmitted hearts of the Three Sages, practice the same art, and universally deliver all beings.\n\n---\n\nIn the crescent-moon furnace, mercury;\nIn the cinnabar tripod, lead.\nTortoise and snake—true unified qi,\nBorn in the prior heaven.\n\nThe crescent-moon furnace refers to the place within the human body where the furnace for refinement can be established, without need to fixate on specific locations. Cinnabar symbolizes the heart’s image; the term \"tripod\" signifies the heart’s inherent emptiness, capable of containing and refining things.\n\nThe tortoise and snake were mentioned in Chapter Four; here, they further elucidate the meaning of the first chapter, stating that the lead and mercury within body and heart originally derive from the true unity of yin and yang, all produced in the prior heaven. One need only attain emptiness and tranquility to observe their return—no external seeking is required.\n\nThus, the worthy Xue Zixian composed a song:\n*\"Crescent-moon furnace, cinnabar tripod,\nKnow to embrace the One and guard harmony,\nWithout concern for penetrating barriers or casting into the jade well.\"*\nMaster Xue was a disciple of Master Shi, having received the true transmission of this chapter’s secret and thus composing this song.\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Seven.**\nThis clarifies that the furnace, tripod, medicine, and fire are all present from the very beginning of our existence, lamenting that people remain unaware and fail to practice.\n\n---\n\nNew moon, full moon, crescent, and dark—\nDrawing and adding mirror waxing and waning.\nUnknowing of true creation and transformation,\nWhat thing is true lead?\n\nNew moon, full moon, crescent, and dark are images of waxing and waning, ebb and flow. \"Seeking\" means turning, not searching. \"Drawing\" means reducing when full; \"adding\" means supplementing when empty—all arising naturally.\n\nFrom non-being to being is called creation; from being back to non-being is called transformation—this is following nature. The Dao of the Elixir follows nature: the human body naturally has movement and stillness, the qi mechanism naturally has concealment and activation, just as the moon in the sky has new moon, full moon, crescent, and dark. One draws and adds according to its waxing and waning, never maintaining perpetual fullness.\n\nIf one does not recognize waxing and waning as the true mechanism of creation and transformation, then after the first crescent and before the new moon or dark, seeking the moon’s appearance in the west at dusk will be impossible. This illustrates that when refining the Elixir and gathering the medicine, one should embrace purity and stillness as the body and guard true lead as the function.\n\nIf the initial stirring of *gui* has not yet arisen, one will never find—even searching the entire body—what thing could be true lead. This further elucidates the meaning of Chapter Two: *\"To gather and refine, one must know the time.\"*\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Eight.**\nThe previous chapter having clarified the source of the medicine, this chapter specifies the time of its arising, hoping that all may know and practice.\n\n---\n\nQi is the life within form,\nHeart is the spirit within nature.\nOne who knows the cavity of spirit and qi\nIs indeed an immortal.\n\nForm is the body; the body relies on the stem of life’s true qi to live, thus qi is the life within form. The heart is the heaven of nature, where the primordial spirit gathers, thus the heart is the spirit within nature—meaning the heart is the chamber of spirit.\n\nIn sum, nature and life are the root of body and heart; spirit and qi are what body and heart emit. Thus, knowing that body and heart are the support of nature and life, body and heart are the cavity of spirit and qi. The perceptive person who attains this true cavity, gathers and stores it, has established the foundation of life in profound secrecy.\n\nWithout this knowledge, where does one begin the refinement of the immortal?\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Nine.**\nThis further elucidates the function of body, heart, nature, and life, relying solely on spirit and qi for application, hoping that people will suddenly awaken to the method of return and restoration to regain their source.\n\n---\n\nWood marrow refines the golden tripod,\nSpring flow pours into the jade furnace.\nWood symbolizes nature; nature relies on the heart. The single point of true essence within the heart originally arises from the root of nature—this is my primordial essence, like the marrow within wood, hence \"wood marrow.\"\n\nThis clarifies the source of mercury. Gold represents the primordial Qian virtue; the primordial heart originally belongs to Qian, hence the heart is metaphorically called the \"golden heart\"—the foundation upon which nature relies. Nature is inherently without flaw, thus it resides within the heart, which possesses all principles to respond to the myriad affairs. Just as smelting gold forms a tripod capable of regulating water and fire to refine the five flavors, it is called the \"golden tripod.\" The heart is originally perfectly pure; when untainted by external objects, it remains without blemish, and its essence and marrow can be refined into spirit. Yet since birth, without refinement, it becomes distracted by sensory desires, laboring the heart and instead being enslaved by form. Now, desiring to refine the elixir, how can one expect to condense essence into mercury? Therefore, one must first establish the correct mandate, purify the heart through stillness, and refine it to clarity, thereby completing the original spirit of one’s nature. Once lead arises, true mercury is produced, condensed and refined into spirit. Hence the metaphor: *\"Wood marrow refines the golden tripod.\"*\n\n\"Spring\" refers to water still within the mountain before its emergence, symbolizing my life. Life depends on the body; the single point of true qi within the body originally arises from the root of life—this is my primordial qi, like a flowing stream with its source, hence \"spring flow\"—this clarifies the source of lead. Jade embodies the primordial Kun body; the primordial body originally belongs to Kun, hence the body is metaphorically called the \"jade body\"—the foundation upon which life relies. Life is inherently vigorous, thus it resides within the body. At midnight, when a single yang stirs, it is like carving jade into a furnace, wherein fire warms and qi grows more temperate, hence the \"jade furnace.\" The body is originally perfectly still; when untouched by external objects, it remains free from illness, nourished by fetal breathing to mature. Yet after encountering external things, if one no longer cherishes it, the qi mechanism becomes agitated, flowing into essence and causing leakage. Now, desiring to refine the elixir, this qi is still deemed impure. One must first firmly uphold the correct thought, guiding qi to gather within the body, settling and purifying it, thereby attaining the primordial qi. Naturally activated, it refines mercury into spirit. Hence the metaphor: *\"Spring flow pours into the jade furnace.\"*\n\nWho among the bustling world would contemplate life and death’s great matter, rectifying the root and purifying the source of the heart and body’s essence and qi, refining them like gold and jade, and then devote three hundred days of effort, neither forgetting nor forcing, to cultivate it steadily?\n\n**Above: Chapter Thirty.**\nThis chapter, following the previous one—which has thoroughly revealed the origins of spirit and qi, seemingly allowing for sudden awakening and return to the source—addresses those who have yet to awaken. Due to deep-seated habitual defilements, their spirit is dull and qi turbid; the spiritual barrier remains unopened, and they cannot fully embrace it. Thus, it further instructs them to invigorate their spirit, refine and purify it, awaiting the proper time to commence the firing process.\n\nThe jade tripod refines lead fluid,\nThe golden furnace nurtures mercury essence.\nThe tripod symbolizes the spirit chamber; when the master within, through the cultivation described above, becomes clear and luminous, the spirit is as flawless as jade, hence the \"jade tripod.\" When lead qi arrives, mercury fire is activated to refine it, forming spirit water, hence: *\"The jade tripod refines lead fluid.\"* The furnace symbolizes the sea of qi; when the true qi within, as described above, is settled and purified, the qi naturally solidifies like gold, hence the \"golden furnace.\" When qi is produced, it must encounter mercury essence, which is naturally nurtured and enters the flowery pond, hence: *\"The golden furnace nurtures mercury essence.\"*\n\nNine returns are nine transformations, as explained in Chapter Six. Properly gathering the ingredients is the way of refinement and union. \"Resembling the revolving stars\" means following the celestial bodies that govern the four seasons and the regularity of dawn and dusk, all rooted in the heavens’ ceaseless motion, naturally revolving around the pivot without error. This illustrates that bathing and nurturing should be modeled after this principle. The main point of this chapter is to clarify that spirit is fire and qi is the medicine; when fire meets medicine, it vigorously refines, and when medicine encounters fire, it solidifies, thereby forming the returned elixir. \"Refining\" and \"nurturing\" refer to the process from union to refinement, employing Qian’s steadfast stillness to nurture until the bathing stage, when the embryo separates and the elixir is completed.\n\n**Above: Chapter Thirty-One.**\nThis chapter, building upon the previous one, states that after invigorating the spirit, when the time arrives and all converges, one can condense and refine the elixir. It further instructs on the precise nature of medicine and fire, enabling one to clearly understand the theory of the nine returns without doubt.\n\nJade fluid nourishes the spirit chamber,\nThe golden embryo forms the qi pivot.\nSeek only the medicine within the body,\nNo need to consult alchemical texts.\nJade fluid refers to heart qi, and the golden embryo refers to lead heart. When qi is sufficient to become spirit, it can refine the elixir. Therefore, one must first cultivate heart qi to nourish the spirit chamber, so that when lead is encountered, it merges into a single embryo. Once the embryo’s qi is formed, the entire body’s qi mechanism follows the celestial pivot like the revolving heavens, without errant movement. Thus, spirit is the qi pivot. When Kun constantly condenses, qi gathers without fail—all is the medicine within the body, which can only be sought within oneself. Alchemical texts of past dynasties merely clarify the main principles, teaching people to introspect and cultivate internally, without needing to consult them.\n\n**Above: Chapter Thirty-Two.**\nThis explains the correct method of union.\n\nFire jujubes have no pits,\nIntercourse pears leave no dregs.\nAll day long, tend the fire and timing,\nDivine water irrigates the golden flower.\n\nThe jujube is called \"fire jujube,\" metaphor for true mercury refined from lead into elixir.\nThe pear is called \"intercourse pear,\" metaphor for the elixir head where mercury and lead merge as one.\n\"Divine water\" is explained in Chapter Four; the \"golden flower\" is the Flower Pool.\nThis speaks of spirit having no pit, qi leaving no dregs—only by maintaining stillness and emptiness throughout the day, nurturing the formless, does spirit naturally condense into the qi cavern.\nThis is the Dao of \"lead and mercury forming the true body\" achieved spontaneously, as mentioned in the first chapter.\nAs Laozi said, \"Daring not to act brings life.\"\n\nMaster Zixian Xue has a song:\n*\"True intercourse pear, true fire jujube,\nAfter eating the pear, the four limbs grow refined;\nWhen swallowing the jujube, ten thousand kalpas are sated.\"*\nDo you not believe it so?\n\n**Above: Chapter Thirty-Three.**\nThis explains the correct method of refinement. The next chapter will address the errors of those who practice qi refinement and spirit preservation, lamenting their failure to grasp the subtlety of the superior-grade true formula.\n\n---\n\nRefining qi is but wasted effort,\nPreserving spirit is mere exertion.\nHow could they know the marvel of the elixir formula—\nAll day long, one delights in true emptiness.\n\n\"Delighting\" is like the roc soaring ninety thousand li and resting for six months, never straying beyond the heavens.\n\"True emptiness\" means spirit is real, qi is void.\nWhen I enter the qi cavern with spirit, the perception of emptiness and the emptied realm are both swept away, and the entire body becomes utterly transparent, inner and outer as one true emptiness.\n\"Delighting in true emptiness\" is what Master Haichan meant by:\n*\"Illuminating the body, long life is empty yet not empty;\nThe numinous mirror embraces heaven and holds the ten thousand things.\"*\n\nThis speaks of human primordial qi, which should only be nurtured, not refined—let it circulate freely, and it will be clear and unobstructed.\nYet some refine qi: if not through manipulation, then by breath-holding.\nLittle do they know that breath-holding and manipulation are techniques used in talismanic practices, where the emptied realm is feigned to store and deploy qi, creating an illusion of efficacy—this is refining through deliberate effort.\nIf true qi is already circulating naturally and one still refines it, this is fettering qi.\nFettering qi causes stagnation and blockage, and when asleep or unaware, it will inevitably leak out, wasting effort without result.\nThis is the error of those in lesser alchemical traditions who cling to the emptied realm, failing to grasp the principle of inner-outer unity.\n\nMoreover, primordial spirit should only be settled, not preserved through effort—constantly retreating into concealment, it becomes real and not hollow.\nYet some preserve spirit: if not through focused visualization, then by silent invocation.\nLittle do they know that focused visualization and silent invocation are practices used in ghostly rites, where the perception of emptiness is feigned to express reverence, achieving resonance—this is preserving through deliberate intent.\nIf the elixir spirit is already serene and one still preserves it, this is self-disturbance.\nDisturbing spirit shackles and unsettles it, inevitably driving it toward wandering thoughts and delusions, wasting effort without gain.\nThis is the error of the Two Vehicles in Buddhism, who remain attached to the perception of emptiness, failing to achieve the forgetting of both self and dharmas.\n\nChen Niuwan’s *Song of Emerald Emptiness* points out these flaws:\n*\"All stem from not understanding the true one’s correct formula,\nLeading to vain labor and endless harm.\"*\n\nHow could they know the marvel of the superior-grade elixir formula, which long ago swept away both the perception of emptiness and the emptied realm, achieving true emptiness without obstruction?\nSpirit naturally conceals itself in secrecy, nurturing the formless;\nQi naturally fills the void, meeting its ultimate limit.\nFrom the moment of the living zi hour’s true union onward to the living zi hour’s initial union, one remains serene all day,\nUsing activity and rest, movement and stillness as fire and timing.\nRising with the sun to work like the roc in flight,\nResting at dusk like the roc at rest,\nEating when hungry, sleeping when weary,\nResponding to events with compliance, returning to stillness when guests depart—\nThe ten thousand things cannot disturb my non-awareness,\nHeaven and earth cannot enslave my formlessness.\nFreely circulating through the six qi,\nI alone contain the myriad existences in sincerity.\nThis is the marvelous formula of \"tending the fire and timing all day\" from the previous chapter, and \"delighting in true emptiness all day\" in this chapter—\nWhy trouble with the vain labor of refining qi and preserving spirit?\n\n**Above: Chapter Thirty-Four.**\nThis chapter, following the previous one, speaks of the life treasure not to be lightly tampered with—only by concealing qi within qi without detection, concealing spirit within spirit without awareness,\nNeither clinging to emptiness nor to nothingness,\nLike a fish in water, carefree and at ease,\nResponding to things with integrity and compliance,\nDeparting from things with vast impartiality,\nExisting in perfect oneness—\nThis is the correct method of bathing.\nIf one can be thus, what danger need one fear?\n\n---\n\nTo refine primordial qi,\nFirst dry the living mercury.\nOnce the sacred embryo is formed,\nThe crown breaks open with thunderous roar.\n\n\"Living mercury\" refers to unrefined mercury—\nThe single point of yin essence in my heart,\nInitially unmet by lead’s refinement,\nLike quicksilver, lively and hard to control.\n\"Breaking the crown\" follows the meaning of \"chiseling through\" in Chapter Twenty-Two.\n\nThis speaks of treasuring the yin essence in my heart because, when it encounters the yang qi in my body, it can be seized and refined.\nYet essence, being yin, is like quicksilver—lively and prone to dissipation.\nHow can it gather qi to become spirit?\nThus, to refine primordial qi, one must first, in daily life,\nBe cautious and fearful, steadfast in resolve,\nThrough vigilance in solitude, retreat into concealment—\nTaking purity as the foundation, guarding lead and mercury as the function.\nWhen gui is born, exert unwavering strength,\nSeize this unruly yin essence like a dragon,\nWrestle and capture the fierce yang qi like a tiger,\nWrestle them into a death grip, surging upward,\nTurning back in a single motion—\nThen they unite joyously without separation.\n\nAt that moment, my yin essence—long resented for its tendency to dissipate, likened to quicksilver—has its fluid wholly absorbed by yang qi, congealing into spirit and returning together to the formless cavity. This is called the Mysterious Female.\nAs Master Bai said: *\"Two mud oxen wrestle into the sea—henceforth, all trace of them vanishes.\"* Yet this describes only the initial formation of the elixir-head; thereafter, the coming and renewal of primordial life and primordial nature are all rooted in this profound concealment as their foundation.\nEven the true qi that perpetually arises in the body at ordinary times is none other than this \"spiritless spirit,\" wondrously merging and congealing within the realm of nothingness.\nDay after day, night after night, without reckoning the passage of days or months, the sacred embryo naturally takes form. One day, when the cavity at the crown breaks open, it becomes the gate of the Mysterious Female.\nSuddenly, this body seems to sit atop the heavens—only to behold thunder roaring and lightning flashing in the void, shaking earth and startling sky. In an instant, the hundred meridians all still, the Three Passes become radiantly clear.\nFrom then on, the body is as if ablaze, wholly yang throughout, all chronic ailments vanish, and dreams no longer arise.\nThe ancients revered this return of life as the reappearance of the primordial numinous treasure, the True Person of Original Life; in the return of nature, they saw the reappearance of the primordial Supreme Ultimate, the True Person of Dao and virtue. When refining emptiness to merge with the Dao, they called it the return of the primordial Wuji, the original unified qi.\nClearly, they took the Three Pure Ones, who unfold the transformations of heaven, as the true essence of the flowing unity of qi. Their teaching indeed contains profound truth, yet I humbly suggest that in the path of elixir refinement, the first steps are the return of qi and the return of spirit, followed by the revelation of the return of life, the return of nature, and the merging with the original source as the ultimate achievement—thus unfolding the essential aim of returning to the root and restoring the origin in a way that feels more intimate and less abstract.\nTherefore, there is no need to invoke honorific titles at every step; this is not to dismiss the established teachings of the ancients.\n\n---\n\nQi does not arise from the kidneys, nor does spirit reside in the heart.\nQi and spirit are elusive—\nThey transform into a single mass of gold.\nThis \"single mass of gold\" does not distinguish between the five qi, the three flowers, inner or outer, movement or stillness, form or dharma—it is simply nurtured with a tranquil mind in the formless.\nAs the *Taiyi Saving from Suffering Sutra* says:\n*\"Heavenly qi returns to the one body, all becoming natural spirit.\nThe natural has a distinct essence, originally in the empty cavern.\nThe empty cavern’s trace is no-trace, pervading the body with emptiness.\nFirst, entrust qi to stand;\nSecond, follow qi to arise;\nThird, complete the ten thousand dharmas;\nFourth, generate radiant light.\"*\nThis continues the previous chapter, speaking of the qi initially entrusted to the body, which returns from the dwelling palace of the empty valley to the responding valley—not originating from the kidneys.\nThe spirit transformed from yin essence returns from the responding valley, circulating with qi to revert to the celestial valley—not residing in the heart. Yet this remains within the tangible body, where grasping is possible, and does not yet manifest the Dharma-body.\nHere, form and dharma are merged as the practice of nurturing and refining.\nKnow that spirit has no direction, and qi has no form—what is concealed in secrecy is called spirit, and what fills the void is called qi.\nWhen qi and spirit interact, it occurs within the vast emptiness, leaving no trace to trace. Only in the midst of vagueness do they meet, and within profound obscurity does transformation arise.\nIf one seeks to find it, it can never be grasped; yet in the space between stillness and movement, a flash of flame scatters across the void—truly a mass of golden light, permeating the entire body.\nWhen employed, the true spirit manifests; when released, it hides within the unchanging stillness.\nThis is no mere metaphor—it is the true vision.\n\n---\n\nThe cavity is called the Mysterious Female,\nWithin it, qi and spirit are stored.\nWho knows this cavity?\nSeek no further for the real.\nThis chapter reveals the cavity formed at the moment of receiving qi at birth, which the ancients named the Mysterious Female. It arises only when I attain tranquility, the seven apertures return to their root, and essence and qi revert to congeal into spirit—this cavity can then contain them, hence the name Mysterious Female.\nThe key lies in that single moment when a steadfast and upright thought arises, allowing a brief instant of congealment.\nThus, Master Bai said: *\"The Mysterious Female is where the thought stirs.\"*\nThe Master taught:\n*\"Qi arises from the hidden abyss and becomes spirit—hence it is called 'Mysterious,' the true yin within Li, the yin essence within the heart. When qi congeals, it completes my celestial nature.\nQi relies on spirit to gather and transform into spirit-water—hence it is called 'Female,' the true yang within Kan, the yang qi within the body. When it merges with qi, it completes my original life.\nWhen qi and essence unite in one cavity, it is called the Mysterious Female. Who knows it?\nIf one understands why this cavity is called the Mysterious Female, then this single thought alone is real—beyond it, nothing is genuine. Why seek further?\"*\nMaster Zixian Xue composed a song:\n*\"The true Mysterious Female, the true Mysterious Female—\nThe Mysterious Female is but one cavity,\nNot in the mouth, nose, heart, or kidneys.\"*\nThis elucidates the chapter.\nMaster Chunyang said: *\"Trace back to the moment of receiving qi at birth—\nNo wonder the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.\"*\n\nThe explanation grows ever clearer!\n\n**[On Chapter 37]**\nThis speaks of why the single cavity is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe spleen and stomach are not the chamber of spirit,\nThe bladder is but surplus of the kidneys.\nI urge you: cease your clinging attachment—\nThis is not the ladder of the Elixir.\n\nThe spleen and stomach store the qi of grain, not the chamber of spirit; one must not obstruct them, lest transformation become difficult. The bladder is merely the kidneys’ surplus, storing turbid water—do not mistake it for yang essence and recklessly circulate it through the River Chariot. The steps of the Dao of the Elixir lie not here; abandon your rigid attachments.\n\n**[On Chapter 38]**\nFollowing the previous chapter’s warning against external seeking, this cautions against internal misdirection, teaching one to nurture only the formless—this is the true ladder.\n\nA thousand poems of inner visions,\nA single cup of Central Yellow wine.\nCarefree, unburdened by things,\nBeyond the body lies Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Inner visions* refer to the scenes within the colored body. *Central Yellow* is the Yellow Court within the celestial axis. *Beyond the body lies Heaven and Earth* describes the radiance uniting the seven apertures—once the crown is suddenly pierced, one beholds a golden light pervading the colored body inside and out, formed from the vast qi of primordial Heaven and Earth. Boundless in expanse, infinitesimal in subtlety, it permeates the colored body, which is contained within it. Thus, the body beyond the body is the integrated whole of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAt this stage, the inner visions cannot be grasped, nor can fire be applied to the Central Yellow. It is best to compose verses in response to the scene, cultivating the nature of Heaven and Earth, and to harmonize yin and yang’s spirit with wine. Refining one’s temperament demands meticulous care, hence a thousand poems flow without obstruction; nurturing qi must not be excessive, hence a single cup suffices. Spirit and qi thus roam freely within the Dharma-body. Though this colored body soars ninety thousand miles or rests for six months, soaring at will, it never strays beyond the Dharma-realm, and no worldly desire can burden its spirit. This is the Way of mutual nurturance within and without—what Master Zhang called, *\"When the inner is unobstructed, the outer is also unobstructed.\"*\n\n**[On Chapter 39]**\nBuilding on the two preceding chapters, which swept clean and clarified inner and outer, this now emphasizes their mutual nurturance. One must refine temperament and cultivate nature, truly nurturing one’s vast qi. Thus, all three hundred rituals and three thousand deportments are the sage’s means of tempering harmony within Heaven and Earth, guiding each to the essence of their nature. Rooted in soundless music and formless ritual, moving with ease along the central path, ascending and descending in unity with Heaven and Earth—how could any external thing burden the spirit?\n\nThe Sun-Crow and Moon-Hare boil each other,\nThe Tortoise and Serpent coil of themselves.\nRefined into a single grain of elixir,\nWarmed and nurtured to become the Embryonic Immortal.\n\nThe crow is the solar soul, signifying this moment’s nature;\nThe hare is the lunar spirit, signifying this moment’s emotion.\nTheir boiling together means nature gathers emotion,\nand emotion follows nature—\nan image of water and fire in mutual completion.\n\nThe tortoise, skilled at concealment, signifies spirit;\nThe serpent, skilled at coiling, signifies qi.\nTheir self-coiling means spirit guides qi,\nand qi naturally nurtures spirit—\na form of yin and yang in spiral embrace.\n\nFollowing the previous chapter,\nwhich taught refining emotion and cultivating nature,\nso one may drink wine and compose poetry,\nthe master now fears disciples may cling to distinctions of inner and outer.\nThus, he further instructs to forget form entirely:\nnature and emotion, through refining and forging, become boiling;\nqi and spirit, through movement and stillness, become coiling.\nNaturally, they merge and transform into a single grain of elixir—\nvast beyond all bounds, minute beyond all interiors,\nintelligence pervading the ten thousand things,\nspirit transforming without limit,\nfused with the Great Ultimate and ever abiding.\n\nChen Niniu said,\n*“Seize the crow and hare as medicinal ingredients,\ntake the Great Void as crucible and cauldron,”*\nwhich is precisely the Way of returning to nature and uniting with the Origin.\n\nMaster Zixian Xue composed a song:\n*“The crow has no form, the hare no shadow,\nthe crow and hare are but the essence of sun and moon.\nWhen crow and hare unite, heaven and earth endure.”*\nAnother song says:\n*“The tortoise has no image, the serpent no trace,\nthe tortoise and serpent are but the forms of yin and yang.\nWhen the two qi unite, they merge into one.”*\nBoth illustrate nature and emotion, spirit and qi.\n\nThe Dao undergoes constant change,\nyet one must merge and perfect it to nurture that single grain of cinnabar heart,\nresponding to circumstances with fluid transformation,\nin motion and stillness alike attuned,\nuniting inner and outer as one body.\nOne must not fixate on one side in seeking it.\n\n**[On Chapter 40]**\nThis chapter, building on the previous one,\nreveals that at this stage, yin and yang, spirit and qi,\nshift and move without fixed abode—\nno division of inner and outer remains.\nWhether manifest as ritual and music\nor subtle as ghosts and spirits,\nall return to my refined emotion and cultivated nature,\nwarming and nurturing the mechanism of transformation,\nleading gradually to the realm of no sound, no scent—\nwhere the elixir is complete!\n\n---\n\nAll things born must die,\nthe primordial spirit dies and revives again.\nWhen spirit returns to the qi cave,\nthe Dao of the elixir naturally forms.\n\nSpirit here is primordial spirit;\nqi is the true qi of the Limitless Primordial Yang.\nIf one nurtures thus, one may seem to achieve\nlongevity, deathlessness, joyous freedom—\nwhy then seek elixir completion, immortality, or ancestral mastery?\n\nYet observe: all things under heaven,\nonce born, must die.\nEven my yang spirit and primordial life,\nonce before, had perished.\nThough now, by secret method, they have revived,\nwho can guarantee they will not die again?\nSuch nurturing is not the ultimate resolution.\n\nAt this stage, one must advance further,\nwaiting until the warming and nurturing are fourfold complete\nbefore success is assured.\nWhy?\nSince the opening of the passes and orifices,\nmy spirit and qi have been nurtured directly, without harm,\nfilling heaven and earth, penetrating the Three Clarities.\nI await the completion of the Great Ultimate\nwithin the natural void,\nthen arouse a single spark of the Limitless Primordial Yang’s true qi.\nI then settle as in the beginning—\nthis is spirit returning to the qi cave,\nunyielding even if earth overturns and heaven collapses.\nAfter a brief moment of such work,\nthe yang spirit, infused with primordial qi,\nmanifests in form—\nable to ascend and transform,\nor dwell in tranquil stillness.\nIn its substance:\nears hear the nine heavens,\neyes see ten thousand miles,\nno hunger from fasting,\nno drunkenness from wine,\nmouth can dry mercury,\nbelly can steam cakes.\nIn its function:\nthe body radiates light, myriad spirits pay homage,\nit can command thunder, clear skies, summon rain.\nGhosts and demons lose their souls at its sight,\nspirits and monsters vanish upon encounter.\nYet it remains unmoved before its own reflection,\nserene and unchanging,\nencompassing all phenomena,\nnurturing the primordial spirit—\nnaturally uniting virtue with heaven and earth,\nbrightness with sun and moon.\nThis is uniting with the Origin.\n\nWhen the primordial spirit is accomplished,\nawaiting the moment of transformation,\nit merges with the Dao in truth—\nas the *Daodejing* says:\n*“Work is completed, affairs are settled,\nthe people all say, ‘It happened naturally.’”*\nWho would know that my effort, from beginning to end,\nlies solely in nurturing the formless,\nin the single secret of spirit returning to the qi cave?\nWithout true wisdom, intelligence, spiritual power, and non-violence,\nwho could partake in this?\n\nThis is the method of refining form with golden liquid,\nthus the yang spirit can manifest in form.\n\n**[On Chapter 41]**\nThis chapter, together with the preceding five,\nall expound the warming and nurturing to complete the elixir.\nUltimately, no artificial effort is needed—\none merely awaits the return of the primordial spirit and true nature,\nrelying on the yang spirit’s stillness and steadfastness to fulfill its course.\nThe following seven chapters are all written to dispel doubts,\nnot to introduce new practices.\nReaders will naturally understand.\n\n---\n\nWhere spirit and qi return to the root,\nbody and mind recover their mandate—\nthis true aperture,\nfew indeed know it.\n\nSpirit and qi were discussed in the previous chapter.\nThe root is the root of heaven and earth,\nmy primordial nature.\nThe mandate is the primordial life.\nAt this stage, one reaches the time of returning to the root and recovering the mandate.\nFearing that people might not know what “returning” refers to,\nthe master clearly points to the four words: spirit, qi, heart, body.\nNo longer borrowing metaphors from things,\nhe clarifies that where spirit and qi return to the root\nis precisely when body and mind recover their mandate—\nboth are the virtue of nature,\nthe Way of uniting inner and outer.\nThus, its application is always timely,\nnot imposed from without.\nHe teaches that one need not seek another aperture—\nthis single aperture of the seven apertures returning to the root,\nonce restored to true emptiness,\nis the true aperture.\nAs Master Bai said,\n*“Returning to the origin and restoring the source is true emptiness,”*\nbut in truth, it is simply that when one empties the heart,\nthe Dao naturally returns.\n\nLaozi’s words, *“All under heaven return to it,”* and Confucius’s words, *“The world returns to ren,”*—how could these refer to some other visible aperture? ○ Above is Chapter Forty-Two. This is to elucidate the aperture of returning, so that people may be enlightened. Thus, Master Bai’s saying, *“Returning to the root and recovering the mandate is the completion of the elixir,”* holds true.\n\nWithin the body lies the Mysterious Female,\nin the heart, no dust or defilement remains.\nWho can comprehend this?\nA single aperture contains the true.\n\nBefore receiving the true formula, the body lacks the Mysterious Female, so one must diligently wash away the dust from the heart. Once the cleansing deepens and the true formula is attained, with the arrival of the correct command, lead and mercury come together at once, without need for thought or calculation, and naturally retreat into concealment. From this, spirit resides in the Celestial Valley, and qi returns to the Crimson Palace—this is the Mysterious Female. Now that the body contains the Mysterious Female, spirit naturally abides in sincerity, qi naturally flows in depth, and the heart is utterly free of dust or defilement, so no further washing is needed. In this vast and empty state, the heavens stretch boundlessly—who among the unknowing can comprehend it? It is only because my spirit and qi have merged into a single right thought, concealed together within one aperture, nurturing the celestial true, undisturbed by externals. This heart thus becomes a luminous terrace, where dust and defilement cannot leave a trace. This teaches that one need not flee the world or shun desires—dwelling in the dust, one may yet transcend it. In sum, it is a practice of simplicity and ease, enduring and vast.\n\nMaster Bai’s words: *“Those who strive yet do not meet must meet a true person. Once the true formula is attained, likes and dislikes are all discarded, and when matters arise, judgment is always fitting. With mastery within, the myriad things cannot enslave me.”* ○ Above is Chapter Forty-Three, which particularly clarifies that upon attaining the formula and completing the elixir, deluded thoughts vanish of themselves. It urges people not to fear difficulty and settle for ease—its words are most earnest!\n\nThe true dragon and tiger of *Li* and *Kan*,\nthe proper horse and ox of *Qian* and *Kun*.\n\nEvery person is fully endowed—why then do they not know to cultivate? The *Li* trigram illustrates the postnatal heart: the heart possesses yin essence but lacks restraint, thus like a dragon it runs rampant. The *Kan* trigram illustrates the postnatal body: the body possesses yang qi but lacks return, thus like a tiger it rages fiercely. Here, *Li* and *Kan* are called the true dragon and tiger—yet they must still be captured and tamed. The *Qian* trigram illustrates the prenatal heart, which Confucius in the *Shuo Gua* likens to a “fine horse.” The *Kun* trigram illustrates the prenatal body, which the *Shuo Gua* likens to a “mother-and-calf cow.” Here, *Qian* and *Kun* are called the “proper horse and ox”—for these are all docile by nature.\n\nThe cultivation of the elixir is fundamentally nothing more than refining away the obstinacy of the postnatal body and heart, and perfecting the docility of the prenatal nature and life. Every person possesses body and heart, every person is endowed with Heaven’s constant principle—why then do they not know to cultivate? It is because they have not obtained the true formula, and do not know first to conceal their spirit within the One Aperture. Thus, the hun and po are not at peace in the liver and lungs, all overstepping their bounds to usurp the kitchen, acting on likes and dislikes to indulge their joy and anger, daily flowing downward into filth without knowing to return. How lamentable!\n\nThe next chapter will clearly expound the method for molding the hun and po.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Four. This continues from the previous chapter, stating that every person possesses the material of immortality, and exhorting them to advance in cultivation.\n\nThe hun and po serve as the heart’s master, while spirit and essence are enveloped by intent. Steadfastly conduct the firing process, silently move the initial yang line. Intent is what the heart emits—it is where my thought first stirs. “Enveloped by intent” means to keep this thought constantly in mind, concealed in secrecy. “Steadfastly” means that as soon as a thought arises, it is like a seal matching its imprint, immediately withdrawing and concealing itself. “Silently” is like a commander deliberating affairs alone within the tent, allowing no outside interference—this illustrates how one gathers and trains the spirit to return to life, holding fast to this single intent in secrecy, not permitting the hun and po to usurp the heart’s mastery.\n\nThe “initial yang line” is where the thought first stirs. The Dao of the elixir takes spirit, essence, hun, po, and intent as its medicinal ingredients, yet the hun and po are originally stored in the liver and lungs, not the heart’s master. Within the heart, the true spirit naturally dwells in serene stillness, calmly governing the hundred bones, and all follow its commands. When it issues forth as intent, this is the first stirring of the true thought. With firm faith and careful guarding, it gathers the essence and qi, so the hun and po also submit and return to their proper places, enabling me to abide in benevolence and follow righteousness to nurture my virtue and power, which in turn nourishes my spirit.\n\nHowever, after birth, the heart engages with things and cannot remain concentrated and still. The spirit then flows into qi, and qi flows into essence, causing the qi to become substantial while the spirit becomes empty, leaving the heart without a master to govern the body’s organs. The hun and po, no longer content in their original viscera, instead seek to manipulate the spirit and usurp the heart’s mastery. When the hun—Wood—leaves the liver and dwells in the heart, Fire flares and injures the nature. When the po—Metal—leaves the lungs and dwells in the heart, it is smelted and the emotions flow unchecked. Thus, the hun loses its benevolence and vents its anger, while the po violates righteousness and indulges its desires. From this, anger, fear, likes, dislikes, worries, and disturbances surge within, suddenly and uncontrollably—all because the spirit does not guard its abode, allowing the hun and po to seize its authority and act as the heart’s master.\n\nTherefore, those who practice cultivation, knowing that the hun and po cannot serve as the heart’s master, must first gather and train the spirit, firmly holding to the true thought. When the true thought congeals, the heart and kidneys naturally communicate. The spirit and essence are then enveloped by intent and do not scatter, while the hun and po, drawn to the spirit, return together with it into the intent. This is the gathering of all elements, with the true thought now wielding authority as the heart’s master. Keeping this thought constantly in mind, steadfastly and unmoving, one conducts the fire of quietude and naturalness. Suddenly, one yang returns, silently circulating the Zhou Tian. The hun and po can no longer recklessly interfere with perception, and the yang qi is no longer shaken—it rises directly to meet and unite with the spirit. The true thought also merges to become spirit, and the elixir’s foundation is thus formed. This is the essential formula for gathering and uniting, and when compared with Chapter Sixty below, it further proves that the true thought must first be established.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Five. This continues from the previous chapter, lamenting that people do not know the proper method, and revealing the true formula for molding the hun, casting the po, and gathering the spirit.\n\nBelow the heart, above the kidneys,\nwest of the liver, left of the lungs.\nNeither intestines nor stomach,\nqi flows freely on its own.\n\nThis continues from the previous chapter. “Silently move the initial yang line” means circulating this yang qi—yet how precisely to circulate it, and where it returns, has not been fully revealed. Lest people, doubting, fall into delusion and cause grave error, the text now clearly points out the body’s interconnected passage. Yet it does not speak of a single aperture, but says it lies between the heart and kidneys, west of the liver and left of the lungs—neither in the intestines nor the six viscera. It seems to be in the spleen, yet Chapter Thirty-Eight states, “The spleen and stomach are not the chamber of spirit.” Thus, all substantial places in the body are not the homeland to which the true qi returns. It is only in this empty, secret space, like the Great Ultimate encompassing the Six Directions’ void, where qi naturally flows freely, without stagnation or the labor of circulation. Simply allowing qi to nourish the spirit, it comes and returns repeatedly. Over time, it can form the yang spirit throughout the body, and one may then suddenly comprehend the meaning of the One Aperture.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Six. This further clarifies the true Dao of emptying the heart so qi flows freely, dispelling doubts about seeking apertures and orifices.\n\nThe marvelous function does not depend on intention,\nThe true mechanism requires no timing.\nWho can know this aperture?\nYet do not merely indulge in non-action.\n\nThis aperture is the secret key, the hidden stem—\nit need not be understood as a mere cavity or orifice!\nSpeaking of the Dao of congealing the elixir:\nit fundamentally relies on our true intention, inherently pure and quiescent in its essence.\nWhen essence arrives to unite with qi,\nqi then refines essence to become spirit.\nAt this juncture, the marvelous function arises solely from the wondrous fusion and coagulation of essence and qi—\nit does not depend on deliberate effort or contrived intent.\nFor instance, when yang qi arises,\nthough Chapter Two speaks of the necessity of \"knowing the timing\" for gathering,\nwhat is meant by \"timing\" is merely the true mechanism of subtle awareness within the secret,\nnot the measured moments of striking clocks or dripping clepsydrae.\nWho, indeed, can truly know this aperture of prior withdrawal and concealment?\nThus, at the moment of union,\nit is precisely \"acting within non-action\";\nbefore union occurs,\none must \"exert effort within effortlessness\"—\nthis is where our correct mindfulness should reside in non-action.\nUntil the time of fetal nurturance arrives,\ndo not prematurely surrender to non-action and fall into boundless dissipation,\nlosing the opportune moment.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Seven.\nThis continues the themes of preceding chapters,\nclarifying that the subtlety of the true mechanism must not be abandoned to mere non-action,\nlest one miss the moment and court danger.\nTherefore, our correct mindfulness must be ceaselessly maintained:\nin stillness, we cultivate the work of preserving and nourishing correctness;\nin movement, we apply the power of reflection and examination,\nso as to avoid error.\nShould an error occur, one fears a host of ills may arise—\nthe elixir overturned, life endangered,\nall prior efforts lost, and further refinement requiring time.\nFormerly, Bai Ziyu of the Southern Lineage’s Five Patriarchs,\nthough he had not yet awakened to the purport of *Awakening to Reality*,\nunderwent three refinements and three collapses.\nYet his heaven-endowed talent prevented disaster!\n\n(Sun Lin, in his early years of practice,\nknew only to purify the heart\nbut not how to sustain mindfulness and withdraw into the secret.\nIt was like chasing a thief while driving away the master of the house—\nthus, in stillness, he could not concentrate;\nin movement, he lacked directness;\nand in matters, he wavered.\nThis heart was half governed by the hun and po,\nand his spirit and essence could not be encompassed by intention.\nIn the winter of the *xinmao* year,\nhe was graced by a single phrase from my teacher at his ear—\nas if ambrosia poured upon his crown, sweet dew sprinkled upon his heart.\nAt once, he welcomed the master home,\ngradually sensing stillness as emptiness and movement as directness.\nIndeed, his daily practice became effortless,\nand in matters, he responded smoothly without difficulty.\nYet he had not yet awakened to the prior mechanism,\nand this heart remained unable to be constantly responsive and quiescent.\nHe thus built levees of restraint to guard against transgression.\nAfter another three years,\nmy teacher imparted this text,\ninstructing him to purify his heart and withdraw to listen.\nWhen purification reached its limit,\na half-word of marvel arrived—\nsuddenly, all was opened.\nThe teacher had deeply mastered the Dao,\nwishing Sun Lin to realize it for himself.\nHad the time not been ripe,\nhe might well have heard without comprehending.\nI humbly append this account of my arduous learning.)\n\nThere is substance, yet it is not nothing;\nNon-action harmonizes with action.\nThe power of transformation returns to one’s grasp—\nSun and Moon congeal golden fat.\n\nSun and Moon refer to the luminaries,\nsymbolizing the nature and feelings of Heaven and Earth.\n\"Golden fat\" is an image of concentrating qi to attain softness,\nlike metal in the crucible, supple as grease—\njust as Bai Ziyu said, \"Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, soft as silk,\"\nand Chen Ninwan said, \"Soft as a silk floss ball, hard as iron.\"\n\nEssence and qi are substantial, not insubstantial.\nWhen mercury meets the arising of lead, they congeal;\nwhen lead obtains mercury, it penetrates directly—\nthese are methods of action.\nYet if these two substances of action are left to linger and turn back,\nthey will flow downward and refuse to ascend—\nthis is not good.\nBut if guided by our non-action’s correct mindfulness,\nwe gather and unite the two substances of action,\nfirst withdrawing and concealing,\nthen the heart, free of distraction, returns together to the secret—\nthis is good.\nThus, the subtle power of creation returns to the grasp of the one who presides over it.\nThe three great barriers of before and after naturally align with the method,\nand one may wander with the Creator, wielding control over its beginning and end.\nWhen our nature and feelings are rectified,\nthe nature and feelings of Heaven and Earth are also rectified—\nhence Zisi transmitted the Dao of harmony and equilibrium,\nand the Pure Yang Master spoke of healing the world and praising transformation.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Eight.\nThis particularly elucidates the function of constantly preserving correct mindfulness,\nso vast and potent,\nserving as a summation of the meaning of Chapter Forty-Seven.\nThe following fifteen chapters teach the method of refining the Valley Spirit;\nfrom Chapter Sixty-Four to Seventy, the way of refining the yang spirit;\nfrom Chapter Seventy-One to Seventy-Eight, the method of refining and uniting the original spirit to shed and return to the source.\nThe principles are profound, the methods simple—\nthose with the aspiration to advance in cultivation\nshould further refine and contemplate them,\nso that through long familiarity, they may naturally enter the marvelous.\n\nThe tiger roars on the western mountain,\nThe dragon intones in the eastern sea.\n\nCapture it for the wild battle,\nEntrust it to the Palace of Gen and Kun.\nThe tiger, by nature, symbolizes the yin aspect of the body—here, \"the tiger roars\" metaphorically signifies the near-fullness of yin essence.\nThe dragon, by nature, symbolizes the yang aspect of the heart—here, \"the dragon intones\" metaphorically signifies the nascent arising of yang qi.\nThe western mountain marks the precelestial Gen position, an image of gradual attainment of pure yin.\nThe eastern sea marks the precelestial Zhen position, an image of the first stirring of solitary yang.\n\"Wild battle\" refers to what Master Bai Zi calls \"subduing body and mind.\"\nThe Teacher says: \"In the postcelestial arrangement, at the juncture of Xu and Hai, within lies Qian—yang enveloped by yin—hence the sixth line of Kun’s hexagram depicts 'dragons battling in the wild.'\"\nThus, Han Confucians took Qian as the wild, while earlier Quanzhen masters called the Xu-Hai juncture \"the wild.\"\nConfucius’ *Wenyan* states: \"When yin congeals upon yang, battle is inevitable—hence 'wild battle.'\"\nThe Palace of Gen and Kun is the Great Yin among the Four Images.\nGen serves as the palace gate, Kun as the closed door—an image of sealing the chamber in profound concealment.\nAt this juncture, the three treasures of ears, eyes, and mouth must be shut and not allowed to communicate; this is the marvel of secret concealment in contemplation, the very method of refinement.\nIt speaks of the moment when one lies in repose, the nocturnal qi just arising—precisely when true yin is nearly full, and within the heart’s center a single drop of yin essence has gathered.\nSuddenly, upon awakening, this is the moment of extreme yin giving birth to yang: beneath the Kun body, a single point of yang qi stirs, and yin essence naturally congeals to engage yang in battle.\nAt that instant, correct mindfulness detects it—hastily withdraw and conceal within the secret aperture.\nThis is the subduing of body and mind, where essence and qi naturally merge as one, surging upward through the spine to settle in its rightful position, then issuing forth as divine water to suffuse the entire body.\nI remain concentrated for a brief moment—this is entrusting it to the Palace of Great Yin, the very Dao of withdrawing and concealing in secrecy.\n\"Capture\" and \"entrust\" merely reflect the retrospective contemplation of the initial union of these two substances, as if through the power of my stillness they were seized and concealed.\nDuring the practice itself, one must not entertain the slightest deliberation.\n\n※ The *Wenyan* of the *Book of Changes*’ Kun hexagram states: \"When yin congeals upon yang, battle is inevitable, for it suspects the absence of yang.\" The ancient text originally read: \"When yang congeals upon yang, battle is inevitable, for it is overlaid with yang.\" *Yi* (doubt) was written as *ning* (congeal), *xian* (suspect) as *jian* (overlay), and the character *wu* (absence) was omitted. Since the Han and Tang dynasties, all Quanzhen predecessors have followed this version, and thus it is retained here to explicate the natural coagulation of the highest-grade elixir.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Nine.\nThis chapter speaks of timely preservation of mindfulness to first conceal, using the subduing of body and mind as the marvelous method for gathering, uniting, and refining.\nThough the explanation is slow, the coagulation is swift—all depends on attaining clarity and stillness.\nAt the moment of awareness, withdraw and conceal; concentrate for a brief moment—this is \"capturing and entrusting.\"\nThe so-called Palace of Gen and Kun refers precisely to this moment of concentration, not some obscure yin realm.\nOne must never seek traces or pursue signs, lest one deviate from the true intent of the alchemical blade.\n\nThe *Fù* hexagram governs the transition from darkness to light—from obscurity to clarity—while *Lún* governs the shift from dawn to dusk. The elixir furnace congeals into pure white snow; there is no place to seek the heart of the monkey.\n\n*Fù* is the hexagram of *yin* reaching its extreme and *yang* emerging anew, illustrating the moment in the human body when stillness reaches its peak and movement begins, when *yang* qi first stirs. *Jié* is the hexagram of *yang* flourishing and *yin* arising, depicting the moment when the mind’s agitation reaches its height and stillness follows, when *yin* essence spontaneously generates.\n\nThe *Lún* hexagram—*Zhèn* below, *Kǎn* above—represents movement within peril, for when *yang* qi first stirs, *yin* essence immediately congeals within. This is the moment of danger: when difficulty arises, one must swiftly conceal the true mind and withdraw to listen as this qi breaks through the peril and ascends straight—only then can clarity be achieved.\n\nThe *Méng* hexagram—*Kǎn* below, *Gèn* above—represents peril beneath and stillness above, symbolizing that when the mind perceives the qi just beginning to form, it seeks to seize it, a moment of danger. One must immediately quiet the mind, withdraw first, and not disrupt this qi—this is the way of nurturing what is true.\n\n\"Clarity and obscurity, dawn and dusk\" speak of movement, as when night gives way to morning; movement returning to stillness, as when day fades into evening—all follow the natural flow of qi. \"Govern\" and \"direct\" mean that true qi naturally governs and directs, embodying stillness and upright movement.\n\nIf one only collects and restrains body and mind without allowing them to sway, this is what Zhang Zai meant by *\"Let the other be host, I the guest.\"* Here, \"the other\" refers to qi, and \"I\" to the mind—then the elixir furnace naturally congeals, and white snow spreads throughout the body, with no stray thoughts to intrude. Even if one wishes to purify the mind, there is no trace of its arising or vanishing to be found.\n\nWhite snow is the *shénshuǐ* [spirit-water]; its meaning has already been explained in Chapter Five. The \"monkey’s heart\" refers to, before attaining the secret, all contrived perceptions and all delusive thoughts and stray notions.\n\n○ **Chapter Fifty**. This continues from the previous chapter, elaborating further on the method of gathering and refining.\n\n「] The black mercury yields yellow leaves, the red lead unfurls purple blossoms. One must further proceed with the fire’s alchemy, within the cauldron to congeal the cinnabar essence.\n\nThe \"heart’s essence\" (*xīn jīng*) has already followed the body’s *qi* and ascended, hence the metaphor of \"black mercury.\" The \"body’s *qi*\" has absorbed the yin essence and become spirit, hence \"red lead.\" When it is said \"to yield yellow leaves,\" it means the black mercury has already contained the yang *qi*, harmonizing with the pure yin *kūn tǔ* [yin earth], and congealing for a moment—now having obtained the nourishing earth *qi*, it yields the tender yellow leaves, the first sprouts of the yellow shoot. **Qu Jun** said, *\"The leaves bear the yin essence and flourish with the yang *qi*, likening yin congealing within yang and the auspicious signs of cinnabar formation.\"* When it unfurls purple blossoms, it means the red lead also relies on the black mercury, and during that moment of shared stillness, it has already obtained the fire *qi*’s vaporous influence—thus, it unfurls purple blossoms, for the hue between water and fire is purple. **Qu Jun** said, *\"The purple blossoms are the fruit’s seed-pod, likening water receiving fire’s aid and the initial foundation for cinnabar formation.\"*\n\nAt this juncture, if one recklessly indulges outward distractions, the spirit-*qi* will still scatter—how can it be permanently congealed to form the *gǔshén* [embryonic spirit]? One must urgently set aside body and mind, firmly store the true thought, and hold the luminous stillness as the alchemical fire’s refinement.\n\nLike an infant’s focused *qi* to attain softness, neither forgetting nor aiding—when one observes its eyes are open, the heart-*qi* is abundant, as if the cinnabar essence congeals within the cauldron. Its virtue/power (*déxìng*) is firm and congealed, and its *qi*’s nature is also steadied—only then can it be called the *gǔshén*, yet it still cannot preserve its immortality.\n\n○ **Chapter Fifty-One**. This continues from the previous chapter, further elucidating the method of mutual absorption and alchemical refinement.\n\n] The wood essence must guard against the hare, the metal essence must further forbid the rooster. Wood symbolizes nature, and the mind arises from nature, hence \"wood essence.\" The hare, in the earthly branches, belongs to *mǎo* [wood], and its time coincides with the hexagram *Léi Tiān Dà Zhuàng* [Thunder-Heaven, Great Strength]—a hexagram where yang *qi* flourishes beyond measure. When one takes this as a symbol, the mind has already attained its proper grandeur; upon seeing a petty person, it recoils as one would from foul stench. Anger arises with the world’s transformations, and fire erupts from wood—it will inevitably counter-naturally subdue itself, hence one must guard against it. If one waits for anger to manifest before restraining it, then nature is already disordered and the *gǔkūn* [embryonic earth] is in peril! Hence the saying, *\"The gentleman does not tread where there is no propriety\"*—this is how one steadies nature. Nature steadied, then the great is truly strong! Guard against it to remove moral obstacles.\n\nMetal symbolizes emotion, and the body arises from emotion, hence \"metal essence.\" The rooster, in the earthly branches, belongs to *yǒu* [metal], and its time coincides with the hexagram *Fēng Dì Guān* [Wind-Earth, Contemplation]—a hexagram where yin *qi* grows beyond measure. When one takes this as a symbol, the body has already thrived; upon encountering external stimuli, it succumbs to lustful desires, and the emotion overpowers—water leaks, metal withers—making it difficult to control emotion, hence one must further forbid it. If one waits for desire to stir before suppressing it, then emotion is already drawn and the *gǔshén* is in jeopardy! Hence the saying, *\"The gentleman contemplates his own life\"*—this is how one checks desire and forgets emotion. Emotion forgotten, then Contemplation is effortless! Forbid it to sever the demon of passion.\n\nDrawing and adding must be accompanied by bathing, precisely at the time of the full moon. If one practices such guarding and forbidding as drawing and adding, true *qi* will naturally circulate within the body, vaporously bathing and nourishing—from this point onward, one progresses. Just as in the hexagram *Zé Tiān Guì* [Marshy Heaven, Decision], one must take its hexagram virtue/power (*guàdé*), ruling *qi* with spirit, yielding to respond to the strong. Thus, my nature and emotions become harmonious and my spirit-*qi* flows freely, like the moon’s approaching fullness. Yet beware of self-praise and self-satisfaction, of exhausting *qi* and straining spirit—one must still retreat and hide deeply, imitating the gentleman’s bestowing of blessings upon others yet not dwelling in his own virtue/power, so that the heart expands and the body becomes plump, preserving fullness without overflow.\n\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Two**. This continues from the previous three chapters, instructing on the method of bathing.\n\n] A thousand sounds stir with the first wind, a thousand peaks embrace the full moon.\n\n「Swiftly issue the correct precepts, then one may circulate the *Zhōu Tiān* [Complete Heaven, Circulation].\nA thousand sounds symbolize the myriad orifices of the body, a thousand peaks represent the channels traversing the entire form.\nWhen a person’s body and mind, nature and emotions, are refined to this stage, the spirit is complete and the *qi* is full, the myriad orifices open freely, and the channels are clear as crystal.\nJust as the first wind stirs all sounds, and the moon’s initial fullness illuminates the thousand peaks—this marks the transition from *Zé Tiān Guì* [Marshy Heaven, Decision], approaching the realm of *Chunyang* [Pure Yang, *Qián*].\nIt is the moment when the primordial command is about to revive, and the moment when the discerning spirit is about to transform.\n\nIf one does not strictly and closely preserve this internally, then when the body’s myriad orifices are fully open, the **Three Corpses and Nine Vermin** (*sānshī jiǔchóng*) will seize the opportunity to intrude and plunder. They will seize my **Grain Spirit** (*gǔshén*), causing it to escape through the body’s orifices, unaware of its dispersion—whether it becomes **flying, hidden, moving, rooted, fetal, ovate, moist, or transformed** (*wéi fēi, wéi qián, wéi dòng, wéi zhí, wéi tāi, wéi luǎn, wéi shī, wéi huà*).\nIt will take form according to one’s lifelong inclinations, and even one’s rightful awareness will be lost along with it. Thus, though one may not die, they will become dull and lifeless!\nThis is why those who know only how to advance but not retreat will inevitably meet regret.\nTherefore, at this time, one must urgently reiterate the correct precepts.\nStrengthen vigilance, maintain meticulous and sustained practice, guarding the **Precepts of the Embracing Bag** (*Guābā zhēn*), revering the **Symbol of the Leaping Abyss** (*Yuèyuān xiàng*).\nAchieve emptiness and preserve stillness, awaiting the revival of the primordial command (*yuánmìng*), then the discerning spirit will naturally transform, and one may broadly circulate the *Zhōu Tiān* [Complete Heaven].\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Three**. This follows the previous chapter, teaching the Dao/Way of maintaining secrecy.\n\nMedicinal substances must be distinguished by their aged or fresh qualities; the fire’s intensity must be adjusted by **drawing and adding** (*chōu tiān*).\nWhen the **single grain of Elixir Light** (*dān guāng*) arises, the **Cold Toad** (*hán chán*) emits radiance toward the **Jade Eaves** (*yù yán*).\nMedicinal substances refer to the revived primordial command (*lái fù zhī yuánmìng*), when the *qi* is excessive, it is aged; when insufficient, it is fresh.\nOne’s constitution and *qi* nature vary, and at this juncture of maintaining fullness, if one’s temperament is slightly unbalanced—\nthe bold may rush forward to meet it and thus lose through **suddenness** (*zhòu*), the timid may falter and fail to act, thus losing through **cowardice** (*qiè*).\nThe sudden will grasp it too quickly, and the medicinal substance remains fresh; the timid will obtain it too late, and the medicinal substance becomes aged—both miss the **middle fire intensity** (*zhōng huǒhòu*).\nHence, my correct precepts must carefully examine one’s *qi* nature and constitution:\n“**The forceful must not befriend the overbearing** (*qiáng fú yǒu gāng*), **the harmonious must befriend the yielding** (*xiè yǒu róu*), **the deep and hidden must overcome the overbearing** (*shěn qián gāng*), **the lofty and bright must overcome the yielding** (*gāo míng róu*).”\nOne must adhere strictly to this balance of **moderation and rectitude** (*píngkāng zhèngzhí*), maintaining secrecy within the rules, acting only at the right time—\nthen the medicinal substance will be perfectly suited, and subsequent **warming and nourishment** (*wēn yǎng*) will be effortless.\n\nThus, at this time, the fire’s intensity must be drawn and added appropriately, while still observing the strict and secret precepts.\nSuddenly, the single grain of Elixir Light (*dān guāng*) radiates forth, and one feels within the body like thunder or lightning—\nthis is the sign of the primordial command’s revival (*yuánmìng lái fù*).\nEven if it ascends straight to the peak, it will eventually rest in the **Heavenly Valley** (*Tiāngǔ*), as described in the later **Chapter Sixty-Four**:\n“**Retaining Mercury in the Golden Tripod**” (*liú gǒng jū jīn dǐng*).\nOne then perceives the pulse ceasing and breathing stopping, a moment of **boundless stillness** (*míngmò piànsī*), followed by a sense of **expansive heart and plump body** (*xīn guǎng tǐ pán*).\nThe skin feels refreshed and clear, all old ailments vanish, and there are no more dreams or slumber.\nFor the **Soul** (*hún*) has already melted into the spirit-*qi*, and the **Grain Spirit** (*gǔshén*) has merged with the revived primordial command to become the **initial foundation of the Yang Spirit** (*yángshén zhī chūjī*).\nThough the Heavenly *qi* has already returned to the body, the Yang Spirit is just forming—\nlike the faintest glimmer of the **Toad’s light** after the Winter Solstice (*dōngzhì*), which still requires **warming and nourishment**.\nThe light has not yet fully emerged from the eaves, hence the saying: *“the Cold Toad emits radiance toward the Jade Eaves”* (*hán chán shè yù yán*).\n\nThe fool notes: **The Gold Elixir’s three hundred days of cultivation** (*jīndān sān bǎi rì gōngfū*)\ncommences at this stage, when **preheaven true *qi*** (*xiāntiān zhēnqì*) begins to condense into spirit, allowing one to advance the Dao/Way without obstruction.\nRecently, other alchemical texts (*dānshū*) describe this stage and hastily write of the **Yang Spirit manifesting** (*yángshén xiànxíng*), yet this is still **spirit dispersing** (*shénchí*).\nIf they say it manifests within the body, it is still unsatisfactory.\nAs for the phrase *“manifesting form”* (*xiànxíng*), I do not know from where its phantom image arises.\nThe **Pure Yang Master’s** (*Chunyáng Zǐ*) *Qiaocao Song* [Divining-Stick Strike Song] states:\n*“With three lead, one lead is obtained, yet the Golden Fruit and Immortal Herb have not yet manifested form.”*\nThis serves as proof!\n\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Four**.」\n\n「This follows upon the preceding chapter, elucidating the intent of **urgent rectification** (*zhènglìng*), which is the **Dao of division and gestation** (*fēntāi*). Indeed, its foundation has long been laid in the **hidden subtlety** (*yòumì*) of **preheaven true *qi*** (*xiāntiān zhēnqì*) through day and night! Thus, when **original essence and destiny** (*yuánmìng*) return to their source, this is the **success of the Valley Spirit** (*Gǔshén chénggōng*), the moment when one may **retain form and not die** (*liúxíng bùsǐ*)—the **initial formation of the Pure Yang Spirit** (*zhèngyángshén chūjié*).\n\nThe **nurturing and warming** (*wēnyǎng*) practices are detailed in **Chapter Sixty-Four** and beyond, while the following nine chapters expound upon the **essentials of returning the elixir** (*huándān*) and further reinforce the **exhortation to earnest practice** (*quànmiǎn zhī cí*).\n\n---\n**The Pearl within the Shell is easily split, the Hen’s Egg within the Nest is readily found.**\nFrom **nothingness, somethingness arises** (*wúzhōng shēngyǒu*), as **spirit-*qi*** (*shénqì*) naturally interpenetrates.\nIt speaks of how even **subtle things** (*wéiwù*) know to **remain still and focused** (*jìngzhuān*) until **somethingness is achieved** (*yǒuchéng*).\nLike the shell containing the pearl, like the hen brooding the egg—all belong to **somethingness arising from nothingness** (*wúzhōng néngshēng yǒuwù*).\nThus, one’s **elixir Dao** (*dān dào*) must be **steadfast and sincere** (*héngchéng*).\nOnly when **spirit-*qi* is steadfast and unshaken** (*shénzhù bùyí*), when **concentrated *qi* yields softness** (*zhuāngqì zhìróu*), and when **subtlety is sustained without interruption** (*mìmì miánmián*), will **spirit-*qi* naturally interpenetrate and coalesce**—this is all there is to it.\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Five**.»\nThis uses **material analogies to illustrate human practice** (*wùyǐ pìrén*), and further implies the **Dao of natural nurturing and warming after division and gestation** (*fēntāi hòu zìrán wēnyǎng*). Can humans not surpass even these analogies?\n\n---\n**Spirit-*qi* is not parent-child, the body-mind is not husband-wife.**\nBut only when one **harmonizes with the celestial mechanism** (*hé tiānjī*), will anyone recognize the **place where the elixir is formed** (*jié dān chù*).\nThis is due to the **master-transmitted alchemical texts** (*shīchuán dānshū*) of former generations, which often use terms like **parent-child** (*zǐmǔ*) and **husband-wife** (*fūfù*), to metaphorically describe **spirit-*qi* and body-mind** (*shénqì shēnxīn*).\nThe **parent-child analogy** (*zǐmǔ zhī yù*) is still too disjointed, while the **husband-wife analogy** (*fūfù zhī yù*) falls into the error of **deliberate fabrication** (*wàngzuò*).\nThus, I particularly clarify that these are metaphors for **spirit-*qi* and body-mind** (*shénqì shēnxīn*), not actual **parent-child** (*zǐmǔ*) or **husband-wife** (*fūfù*).\nI instruct students not to be **entangled in the literal wording** (*ní dānwén*), but only to comprehend the **timely celestial mechanism** (*shí míng hé tiān jī*), which begins with **action** (*yǒuwéi*) and ends with **non-action** (*wúwéi*).\n**Refining yin essence** (*yīnjīng*) into **Pure Yang Spirit** (*yángshén*)—\nwhen **spirit condenses and *qi* gathers** (*shénníng qìjù*), the elixir naturally forms.\nIf asked where the elixir is formed, it is only within **formlessness and profound seclusion** (*wúxiàng yōudú*), where **perfect substance arises from nothingness** (*wánzhì shēngxiàng*).\nIt is merely the **practice of nurturing *qi*** (*yǎngqì zhī shí*), where the **substantial essence of concentrated spirit** (*shénníng zhī shí*) is directed toward **stillness and emptiness** (*jìngxū*), and the **void of condensed spirit** (*shénníng zhī xū*) returns to **my steadfast substance** (*wú dūshí*).\nWith time, it becomes **strong and robust** (*gāngjiàn*), and thus **radiance emerges** (*suǐyǒu guānghuī*).\nTherefore, the **Pure Yang Spirit manifests** (*yángshén xiànxíng*), and the **celestial *qi*** (*tiānqì*) returns—who can truly recognize this?\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Six**.»\n**Rejecting false visions of seeking emptiness** (*pìchú mìkōng wàngjiàn*), and **clarifying the application of true mechanism** (*zhǎnmíng yùnyòng zhēnjī*).\n\n「The **elixir’s initial formation** (*dāntóu chūjié chù*), when the **medicinal substances condense** (*yàowù yǐníng shí*).\nThe **Dragon and Tiger engage in mutual combat** (*Lóng Hǔ jiāoxiàng zhàn*), yet the **Eastern Sovereign remains unaware** (*Dōngjūn zǒng bùzhī*).\nIt is said that when the **celestial *qi* obtains the refined essence** (*qì dé jīng jiān ér shàng tòu*) and they **coalesce upward** (*jīng suì níng qì yǐ chéng shén*), this is the **elixir’s initial formation** (*dāntóu chūjié zhī chù*), the very moment when the **medicinal substances condense** (*yàowù yǐ níng zhī shí*).\nOne must know that the **essence condenses within the *qi*** (*jīng níng yú qì*) like the **Dragon and Tiger’s mutual combat** (*Lóng Hǔ zhī jiāoxiàng*), yet my **true directive** (*zhēnglìng*) has long since **retired into secrecy** (*tùicáng yú mì*).\nThose who fail to recognize this remain unaware, hence the **celestial *qi* naturally overcomes** (*qì zì zhànshèng*).\nAs **Zhangzi** says: *“Only after the battle can one behold the Sage”* (*“Zhànbà fāngnéng jiàn shèngrén” yě*).\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Seven**.\nThis further clarifies that the **interaction and refinement** (*jiāojié shēngliàn*) occur in a single instant, and with the **dispelling of the forty-nine chapters’ futile speculations** (*pòchú sìshíjiǔzhāng nèi zhuōqí yǔyán*), it teaches one to **know the hidden and the revealed** (*zhī lái cáng wǎng*), to **neither forget nor assist** (*wùwàng wùzhù ér yǐ*).\n\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Eight**.\n**Marginal and minor methods** (*pángmén bìng xiǎofǎ*), **heterodox techniques and idle words** (*yìshù jí xián yán*).\nThe **Golden Elixir Reversion Formula** (*Jīnyè huán dān jué*)—**no other path exists** (*hún wú dìèr mén*).\nIt is said that this **Golden Elixir Reversion Formula** (*Jīnyè huán dān zhèng jué*) is the **unified, singular Dao** (*yī bùèr fǎmén*) of the **Buddha’s Great Vehicle** (*fózǔ dàshuàn zhèngzōng*) and the **Confucian *Zhōngyōng* Way** (*Kǒngmén Zhōngyōng zhìdào*).\nIt does not compare to **marginal methods** (*pángmén*), which **invite misfortune and disaster** (*yìshù rěn rén rěhuò zhāoyāng*), nor to **minor techniques and idle words** (*xiǎofǎ xián yán*), which **lead only to wasted effort** (*tú fèi gōnglì ér yǐ*).\n\n○ **Note by Yanglin**: Marginal methods and heterodox techniques—my teacher has never explicitly pointed them out, and I, Lin, am unaware of their details. Only upon reading **Fourth Patriarch Chen Nihuan of the Southern School’s** (*Nánzōng sìzǔ Chén Níhuán zhēnrén*) *Emerald Void Chant* (*Cuìxū yín*) did I discern the **orthodox and heretical** (*xiézhōng*), as clear as the **radiant sun illuminating the azure sky** (*rào rì zhī lì qīngtiān*). The following is appended for reference. ○ **Chapter Fifty-Eight**.」\n\n「To teach the Dao and select methods, one must first distinguish clearly between orthodoxy and heresy—only then can one avoid straying into **marginal methods**.\n\nWhether noble or humble, high or low,\nhusband and wife, brothers and kin—\nif one has the **portion** (*fèn*) for cultivating the Dao,\nall may study the **Alchemical Canon**.\n\nFor the **Way of Nurturing the Transcendent**, it matters not rank or gender—\nonly that one remains in one’s proper place, diligently tends to one’s duties,\nand sincerely resolves to cultivate.\nThen one is among those **destined** (*yǒu fèn*), a kin of the **Immortal House**.\nSuch **Alchemical Canons** are for all to read.\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Nine.**\nThis is an exhortation to the multitude, declaring all may learn together.\n\nA broken house is easily repaired,\na spent medicine is not hard to regrow.\nYet one need only return to the **Law**—\nthen gold and treasure will accumulate like mountains.\n\nThough the previous chapter declared all may cultivate,\nI fear worldly scholars might mishear idle words of **heterodox methods**,\nand sigh that their **medicine is spent**, abandoning hope of transcendent practice.\n\nYet the **Supreme Authentic Alchemy** of the **Complete Reality** requires no aged materials—\nits essence lies in **spirit-qi** (*shénqì*), which pierces heaven and earth,\nknowing no division of youth or age.\nA single moment of **spirit’s stillness** is a moment of **Grain Spirit** (*gǔshén*),\na single moment of **clear vital intent** is a moment of **Original Qi** (*yuánqì*).\nIf one steadfastly guards this moment’s **spirit**, one nourishes this moment’s **qi** in circulation.\nThus, through unbroken, enduring practice,\n**qi nourishes spirit**, spirit condenses, and **essence spontaneously generates qi**.\nAs **essence daily thrives**, spirit grows vibrant—\n**spirit-water** irrigates, the **Sea of Qi** fills,\nand **yang-qi** naturally ascends, penetrating upward,\ncondensing **essence into spirit**.\nWhen **spirit is complete** and **qi is full**,\none reverses aging, returning to infancy—\nthis is the **Law of Return**.\nWhat difficulty is there in the **medicine**?\nThus I liken the body to a house:\nif one but wills to repair it, it will soon mend.\nThe **medicine within** is not hard to regenerate—\nonly gather the mind, refine the heart, and conceal them in secrecy,\nand **spirit will return**, **qi will restore itself**.\nDay by day, month by month,\ngold and treasure will pile like mountains within—\nas **Zhūyáng Zhāngzǐ** said:\n*“When does the true gold of a house ever decay?”*\nThis too speaks of the same.\n○ **Chapter Seventy.**\nThis continues from the previous chapter,\nencouraging even the aged to undertake cultivation.»\n\nIn sum, so long as breath remains, life and nature still belong to me.\nWhen spirit stands firm and unyielding,\nqi flows ceaseless and continuous—\nthis resolve must not falter in the least.\n\nThe following three chapters then expound the **Law of Return**.\n\nThe soul and vital essence form three natures,\nspirit and qi gather the Five Phases.\nWithin them, four symbols divide,\nconcentrating to form the embryonic essence.\n\nHuman nature is fundamentally one,\nbestowed by Heaven (as the field above, grass below) upon my heart,\nwhile soul and vital essence reside in liver and lungs,\noriginally not permitted to stand alongside the heart.\n\nThe Master Qú remarked:\n*“Before cultivation, the heart of right and wrong is indeed one’s innate nature.\nIts branches and offshoots, its conflicting tendencies—\nthese are the work of the soul;\nits partiality and stubbornness, its disregard for justice—\nthese are the work of the vital essence.”*\n\nLi Shàn’s annotation in the *Wénxuǎn* states:\n*“The soul is the essence of the body, the vital essence the resolve of nature;\nboth can divide the authority of true nature.”*\nThis principle is most clear.\n\nThus, when ordinary people encounter matters,\ntheir first thought is pure and clear—\nrooted in the heart, it is true intention;\nbut when a second thought arises,\nit is the soul’s doing—\nthough doubt may linger, it is not yet wholly corrupt;\nuntil the third thought decides,\nit is the vital essence’s creation—\npure yin, entirely selfish.\nMan has but one nature,\nyet the heart, seduced by external things, cannot discern good from evil,\nand thus allows soul, vital essence, and intention to rule together—\na state of three ministers in one kingdom.\nHence it is said: *“The soul and vital essence form three natures.”*\n\nYet the soul of the East Wood truly gives birth to the spirit of South Fire,\nand the vital essence of West Metal truly generates the essence of North Water.\nThe Dao of the Elixir draws from spirit and qi,\nwhich in turn depend on soul and vital essence for their origin—\nthus soul and vital essence are the mother of spirit and qi,\nand spirit and qi are the sign of life and nature.\nTherefore, one must gather the Five Phases into one\nto fully achieve the Dao of the Elixir.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*“To sincerely intend, first perfect knowledge;\nwhen knowledge is perfected, one exhausts principle and nature reveals itself.”*\nThus, those who cultivate must first exhaust principle and perfect nature,\nestablishing great defenses—\nwhen nature is perfected, the heart naturally becomes firm and resolute,\nand supreme authority no longer drifts elsewhere.\n\nOn one hand, gather spirit and establish unshakable faith and vigilance,\ndividing soul, vital essence, and spirit into the four symbols within.\nCondense essence to gather the vital essence,\ncalm spirit to conceal the soul—\nsince spirit and qi depend on soul and vital essence for their origin,\nsoul and vital essence are thus gathered into spirit and qi.\nWhen intention is pure and still,\nthe four symbols cluster in the hidden and secret place—\nthis is the gathering of the Five Phases’ qi into one,\ncondensed and firmly established as embryonic essence.\n\nAs Master Zhāng said:\n*“Two elixirs combined, refining soul and vital essence into sacred spirit.”*\nWhen soul and vital essence are transformed,\nspirit naturally condenses,\nand my nature and emotions may be steadied.\nThis chapter, when compared with the forty-fifth above, reveals even greater wonder.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-One.**\nThis continues from the two preceding chapters,\nillustrating that exhausting principle and perfecting nature are essential to the Dao.\nWhen nature is steadied, one may align with the Way.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Two.**\nDetermine the will to seek lead and mercury,\nquiet the heart to find earth and gold.\nOnly then does one recognize the true unity—\nwho can fathom this profound depth?\n\nThe will is the matter my nature points toward—\nmy original resolve.\nEarth and gold refer to the stillness of pure yin, the *Kūn* soil concealing a point of *Qián* gold—\nwhen *Wu* rests in *Kūn*, forming *Kǎn*—\nthis is the initial stir of my true intention.\n\nThis follows from the previous chapter:\nwhen nature is steadied, the will is also steadied,\nand from this, the seven orifices return to their root.\nFocused intent and silent heart\nare the method of seeking yang qi and yin essence.\nWhen qi and essence awaken in harmony,\none must still maintain a silent, ashen heart—\nthis is the way to seek true intention and contain spirit.\nThus, when spirit condenses and qi becomes still,\nall return to the true, unerring unity within—\nnaturally merging to form the Elixir.\n\nMaster Bái said:\n*“When the will is not scattered, it condenses into spirit.\nA silent, ashen heart—within, the Elixir forms.”*\nSuch profound and abyssal learning—\nwho can truly recognize it?\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Two.**\nThis too continues from the previous chapter,\nrevealing the secret method of establishing life.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Three.**\nCreation has no root or stem,\nyin and yang have their origin.\nThese true mysteries—\nfathers do not transmit them to sons.\n\nThe nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth is the root of creation;\nthe named mother of all things is the origin of yin and yang.\nIndeed!\nYet this most subtle and profound secret\ncan only be grasped by the heart—\nit cannot be easily spoken of.\n\nLet us first speak of creation, yin, and yang by name.\nCreation is the power Heaven alone wields to give birth to all things—\nthe natural, intentional Way of Heaven.\nYin and yang are what man and all things share with Heaven and Earth,\nrooted in the boundless, primordial *Yīqì*—\nthe unborn, unending, empty, and natural Way of non-action.\n\nFrom non-being arises being—creation;\nfrom being returns non-being—transformation.\nThis is spoken of in terms of birth and death.\nExtreme motion becomes stillness—yin;\nextreme stillness returns to motion—yang.\nThis is spoken of in terms of circulation and return.\nBirth and death pertain to form and substance,\ncirculation and return pertain to spirit and qi.\n\nSince man and all things’ form and substance arise from the condensation of spirit and qi,\nwhen man obtains yin essence and yang qi at the beginning,\nspirit is born—\nthis is the root of life.\nWhy does this chapter specifically speak of non-action as the root?\nBecause the world does not know that the **Law of Return** originates from parents,\nwhose natural essence and qi construct this body.\nOnce the umbilical cord is severed at birth,\nit is as though the root is cut and the stem falls.\nThough the spirit and qi received from Great Creation vary in quantity,\ndetermining one’s lifespan—\nthe virtuous may prolong it slightly,\nthe unvirtuous may shorten it—\nthe wise and foolish neither extend nor shorten it,\nbut follow or resist it, exhausting their allotted measure.\nEarly or late, all return to dissolution,\nonce more entering the furnace of Great Creation.\nThus, all things cannot escape fate.\n\nThe lifespan’s birth year, month, and day are called *mingzào* (命造), while death’s year, month, and day are called *huàmìng* (化命). The *Exhortation to Virtue* speaks of prolonging life or shortening it, and of fate being exhausted leading to death—all asserting that what is formed must perish, and what is created must transform. Hence, it is said, *\"Zàohuà wú gēntí\"* (造化无根蒂).\n\nThough the yin essence and yang qi within a human body are also rooted in what Heaven endows, Heaven and Earth themselves rely on these yin and yang to form shapes and bodies. Heaven and Earth merely forget their forms and bodies, not burdening their spirit with material substance, thus using this yin and yang to give birth to all beings.\n\nHumans are the most refined of all things, knowing to revere the high and humble the low, imitating Heaven and following Earth, cultivating emptiness within and substance without to nourish the formless. Within them, the interplay of these two qi moves like the *Wújí Yuānbù* (无极元始) qi—endlessly swelling and waning, like fish in water, perpetually interconnected.\n\nYet those who do not return to the source are like a single ladle of water or a pinch of earth—played with briefly before the ladle shatters and the pinch scatters, with water returning to the sea and dust to the earth. But those who return to the source naturally align with their origin. A ladle of water preserved without clinging to its vessel remains ever in its source; a pinch of earth settled with sincerity cultivates virtue without ceasing. Over time, water gathers into lakes, earth accumulates into mountains—gradually filling lakes to become seas, embracing emptiness to merge with the *Tàiqīng* (太清), condensing to expand mountains into earth, bearing *Huáyuè* (华岳) with solidity. All this is the original essence of that ladle of water and pinch of earth.\n\nHumans accumulate essence and qi to form spirit, refine emptiness and nourish vastness to attain the Dao—this belongs to the intrinsic response to the source. Laozi’s *\"Gǔshén bùsǐ\"* (谷神不死) is rooted with Heaven and Earth at the *Xuānpìn* (玄牝) gate! Hence, it is said, *\"Yīnyáng yǒu běnyuán\"* (阴阳有本源)—though this is only a *zhōngpǐn* (中品) explanation.\n\nAs for the *shàngpǐn* (上品) elixir method, there exists a prior move, a direct path through the *Kǒngdào* (孔道), where the *Xuānguān* (玄关) may be instantly realized. One naturally perceives the mysteries of the *Dàodé* (道德) first chapter, knowing that human spirit shares the same *zàohuà* (造化) as Heaven and Earth—that is, the same *Yuānbù miàowúwéi* (元始妙无为) root.\n\nHuman qi, like all things, draws from yin and yang—that is, from the *Língbǎo miàoyǒuwéi* (灵宝妙有为) source. It is not like the laborious gathering of multitudes or heaps of earth; it requires only a sincere, unshaken thought, ensuring uninterrupted practice and swift return.\n\nThus, when discussing *zàohuà* through yin and yang, these belong to the post-heaven realm, manifesting in humans as the *sèsēn* (色身). If lifespan is neither prolonged nor shortened, and one adheres to the *shàn dào* (善道) of guarding death, this is the *Dàrén* (大人) practicing *\"Hòutiān ér fèng tiānshí\"* (后天而奉天时).\n\nHence, Yán Zǐ did not die young—not because his *sèsēn* was fated to perish, but because he could *\"Chángwú yǐ guān qí miào\"* (常无以观其妙). Zháojí did not live long—not because his *sèsēn* was fated to dissolve, but because he failed to *\"Chángwú yǐ guān qí miào\"*.\n\nIf *zàohuà* is understood through yin and yang, then *zàohuà* originates from the pre-heaven realm, manifesting in humans as the *fǎshēn* (法身). If wisdom and fate can restore their source and return to their origin, they naturally respond to all things in constancy, attaining their true nature. This is the *Dàrén* practicing *\"Xiāntiān ér tiān bù wéi\"* (先天而天不违).\n\nThus, beings cycle through the *Liùdào* (六道) wheel, while sages and kings cannot become Buddhas because they sacrifice their *fǎshēn* to yin and yang’s likes and dislikes, failing to *\"Chángyǒu yǐ guān qí jiào\"* (常有以观其徼). The *Wén Dì*’s seventeen incarnations, Laozi’s eighty-one transformations—these follow yin and yang’s movement and stillness, thus able to *\"Chángyǒu yǐ guān qí jiào\"*.\n\nHence, it is said:\n*\"Sèsēn píng zàohuà, yóu tiān bù yóu jǐ\"* (色身凭造化，由天不由己)—since one has no root to rely on.\n*\"Fǎshēn guàn yīnyáng, yóu wǒ bù yóu tiān\"* (法身贯阴阳，由我不由天)—since one has a source to penetrate.\n\nHeaven aids the sincere; nothing is unlucky.\n\nYet all things arise from existence, and existence from non-existence. Non-existence is the source of existence, while existence is the root of non-existence. Thus, existence and non-existence are movement and stillness; movement and stillness are yin and yang; yin and yang are *zàohuà*; *zàohuà* are existence and non-existence.\n\nI need not distinguish between existence and non-existence, yin and yang, creation and transformation. Only in my every movement and stillness do they mutually root, without preference or aversion, following the *Wángdào* (王道).\n\nIf one nourishes the *fǎshēn* with the *sèsēn*, then gathering is form, scattering is qi. If one stabilizes the *sèsēn* with the *fǎshēn*, stillness becomes the *Jīndān* (金丹), movement becomes thunderous lightning. What birth, what death, what preservation, what annihilation?\n\nAs Mèngzǐ said:\n*\"Tiān shòu bù èr, xiūshēn yǐ sì zhī, suǒyǐ lì mìng yě.\"*\n(天寿不贰，修身以俟之，所以立命也.)\nHow could there be a division between life and death?\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Wànwù jiē bèi yú wǒ yǐ! Fǎnshēn ér chéng, lè mò zài yān.\"*\n(万物皆备于我矣！反身而诚，乐莫在焉.)\nHow could there be a distinction between preservation and annihilation?\n\nThus, one may awaken to the effortless ease of those who are ever responsive and ever still!\n\nQi is like water, spirit like earth. Qi is what fate depends on; spirit is what nature entrusts. The wise delight in water to nourish qi, acting without contrivance to cultivate wisdom. The virtuous take joy in mountains to solidify spirit, dwelling in earth to cultivate sincerity without wavering, thus fostering tranquility.\n\nLet me exhaust this principle of simultaneously cultivating nature and fate: first, store the spirit in the heart; settle the spirit to still the mind; forget the mind to nourish the form; forget the form to nourish the qi; forget the qi to nourish the spirit; forget the spirit to nourish the void.\n\nThus, one attains **Master Yan’s** *zuòwáng* (坐忘), exhausting one’s nature to fulfill fate, and further forgetting the void to merge with the Dao—then Heaven itself will grant one sainthood, and the Original Command and Original Nature will naturally return.\n\nWhen nature and fate are complete, there is no scheming, no certainty, no rigidity, no self—thus merging with the primordial *yīqì* (一氣) of Preheaven, this is the union with the True Dao, transcending past and present while ever enduring, participating in Heaven and Earth without division. In motion, it becomes the eternal constancy of the Great Ultimate; in flow, it is unobstructed. In stillness, it is the True One of the Non-Ultimate, secure and unchanging.\n\nIf one attains this constancy, then all impermanence falls under command; if unobstructed, then all obstruction will be penetrated.\n\nAs the earlier Confucian scholar Zhouzi (周子) said:\n*\"The Five Phases are but one yin-yang; yin-yang is but the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate originates from the Non-Ultimate.\"*\n\nThe Non-Ultimate is indeed void; the Great Ultimate is indeed existence—the root of transformation, the origin of yin-yang. How could one willingly be bound by yin-yang, confined within the Five Phases, vainly clinging to life while fearing death, debating existence over nonexistence?\n\nOne must instead grasp its fundamental root, comprehend its pivotal essence, and transcend the confines of transformation—only then may one be called a true Daoist.\n\nThese profound truths, where life and death intersect with colored phenomena, cannot be transmitted by father to son if one does not personally embody and awaken, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, returning to the True Teacher beneath the divine canopy. With pure mindfulness unfettered, silent and scentless, one must verify it oneself—thus self-stabilizing, self-establishing, self-reverting, self-restoring, self-returning, self-fulfilling, self-liberating. Even the deepest filial bonds cannot convey this.\n\nHence, the seventh patriarch of Longmen, Master Wang Ziyuan of Kunyang, declared after enlightenment:\n*\"Recognize the True—run all night,\nSeek a pillar with neither existence nor nonexistence.\nEmpty, vast, and solitary in cultivation,\nNeither thirst nor hunger—Heaven’s longevity.\"*\n\nAs stated in the annotations of the Twenty-Two Chapters, *\"The advantage of using Six\"* is *\"eternal constancy,\"* while *\"The advantage of using Nine\"* is *\"seeing the dragons without a head—auspicious.\"*\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Three (上第六十三章).**\n\nThis follows the preceding four chapters, elaborating on the middle-grade precepts, demonstrating that transformation lacks roots while yin-yang has its source, revealing the beginnings of exhausting principle and fulfilling nature. It teaches self-realization, awakening to life and death, and directly attaining the sacred realm of wondrous existence and wondrous nonexistence—thus returning to the origin and source, aligning with the highest-grade elixir cultivation and verification. Only then does one grasp Confucius’ saying: *\"To trace the beginning and the end, thus knowing life and death.\"* This is what he meant.\n\nThis true profundity may now be applied with skill.\n\nThis is the pivotal eye-opening insight of the entire passage, elucidating the overarching key of refining the Valley Spirit in Chapters Forty-Nine to Fifty-Four, and setting the stage for the subsequent chapters.\n\n※ From *Zhouyi · Xìcí Zhuàn* (《周易·系辞传》): *\"Original beginning and end.\"* The character *jí* (及) is taken from the Han scholar’s annotation: *\"He who traces the beginning and attains the end knows the saying of life and death.\"* The meaning is clear; thus, I follow it.\n\nRetain the mercury within the golden cauldron,\nAnd lead into the jade pool.\n\nHost and guest know no left nor right—\nOnly recognize the infant.\n\nMercury refers to the spirit,\nLead refers to the qi.\n\nThe golden cauldron denotes within the body\nThe Upper Valley (*Tiāngǔ*), where in infancy the spirit is stored.\n\nThe jade pool denotes within the body\nThe Middle Valley (*Yìnggǔ*), where in infancy the qi is stored.\n\nThe infant refers to the Original Command’s return—\nThe nascent spirit of the Valley’s first transformation.\n\nThis follows Chapter Fifty-Four,\nSpeaking of the moment when the Original Command returns.\n\nThis spirit, having been nurtured in the Middle Valley until fullness,\nRiding the qi ascends and circulates the Microcosmic Orbit,\nThen returns to its original position in the Mud Ball Palace,\nThus remaining in the Upper Valley—this is the Valley Spirit.\n\nThe stone child calls this *division of the embryo*,\nThe white child calls it *transference of the spirit and exchange of the cauldron*—\nHence, *\"retain the mercury in the golden cauldron.\"*\n\nAnd the qi likewise returns to its original position,\nEntering the Middle Valley’s vermilion chamber—\nHence, *\"lead into the jade pool.\"*\n\nThis shift requires no artificial effort;\nIt moves naturally.\n\nMaster Zhang’s *Awakening to Reality* states:\n*\"When using, divide left and right armies—\nLet the other be host, I the guest.\"*\n\nThis chapter clarifies its essence,\nTeaching that qi should be host and spirit the guest—\nNo distinction of left or right,\nThus aligning with the Dao’s authenticity and returning to neither death nor birth.\n\nOnly when the spirit is securely hidden within\nDoes it not seek life through external contrivance—\nHence the qi flows boundlessly,\nTemporarily retaining the spirit to avoid death.\n\nOnly the infant can guard such pure qi,\nThus: *\"Host and guest know no left nor right—\nOnly recognize the infant.\"*\n\nAt this moment, one attains this nascent spirit,\nJust as the infant at birth—\nOnly guard the pure qi as the infant does,\nAnd the pure yang body will naturally flourish!\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Four**\n\nSummarizing the past nine chapters,\nAll elucidating the subtle essence of exhausting principle and perfecting nature,\nRevealing the origin of the Original Command’s return,\nAnd the natural functions at the moment of its return.\n\nThe next chapter will speak of the method of gentle nurturing.\n\nThe Yellow Nurse’s twin breasts are fair,\nThe Old Man’s single heart is kind.\nNo other method in gentle nurturing—\nOnly from the Void, the child is raised.\n\nThe Old Man points to the heart:\nAt the moment of Original Command’s return,\nWhen all is settled and at rest,\nOne must not cling to any *having*—\nOnly nurture the formless spirit,\nMastering purity with unwavering devotion,\nGuest to lead and mercury in solemn stillness,\nThen the qi flows naturally to nourish the spirit-chamber.\n\nLike a nurse feeding her child,\nLet it drink as it will,\nHer heart tender and yielding,\nFollowing the qi’s course,\nEver watchful and returning—\nThus the body grows uniformly warm,\nAnd the infant thrives naturally, needing no other art.\n\nThe Void is the meaning of *not-having*.\nAs the *Golden Lotus Sutra* says:\n*\"If one seeks me through form or sound, it is not so.\"*\nOnly the method of *Observation of Self-Nature* suffices—\nTo forget form, forget qi,\nAnd nurture the spirit that is not-spirit.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Five**\n\nThis follows the previous chapter,\nRevealing the fire’s timing in gentle nurturing—\nOnly the secret of forgetting form\nIs the way to cultivate the Grain-Spirit.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Six**\n\nWithin the vessel, the sky of Heaven never darkens,\nAnd fine, white snow descends in delicate flakes.\n\nThe crimson gate—\nThis refers to the **Zhonggu** (Midgut), the place where the **Ying** (Response) resonates in the **Jiangong** (Crimson Palace).\nThe soaring **Qingfeng** (Azure Phoenix)—\nThis signifies that at this moment, the **qi** emerges fresh from its original position in the **Jiangong**, like the **Qingfeng** (Azure Phoenix) taking flight.\nAs the *Yinfu Jing* (Scripture of the Mysterious Response) states: *\"The bird is within the qi,\"*\nHence, the **Qingfeng** is likened to the **qi**.\nThe *Shiming* (Explication of Names) says: *\"Qing, means 'to generate.'*\nThus, the **Qingfeng** (Azure Phoenix) symbolizes the **qi** in its nascent state.\n\nThe **Dantian** (Elixir Field) here refers to the **Upper Dantian**,**—**\nThat is, the **Tiangu** (Heavenly Grain), the **Nihuan Gong** (Mud Pillow Palace).\nThe **Yushen** (Jade Hare)—\nThis denotes the **yang** spirit within the **Gutian** (Grain-Sky), now nurtured and no longer cold as in its initial state, but warm as jade.\n\nThe **white snow**—\nThis signifies the **qi** circulating to the **Gutian** (Grain-Sky), where it mingles with the spirit, forming **shenwater** (spirit-essence).\nIts **qi** is clear, pure, and pervasive, like white snow.\n\nAt this stage, the **yang** spirit has grown strong and must not be disturbed—\nIt rests naturally in its **not-spirit** state;\nThe **qi** flows freely on its own,\nLike the **Qingfeng** (Azure Phoenix) ascending to the **Nihuan Gong** (Mud Pillow Palace),\nNourishing this spirit.\nWhen the spirit and **qi** unite, they become **shenwater** (spirit-essence),\nAnd it descends like fine, white snow,\nFilling the entire body.\nOne feels uniformly clear and serene,\nAs though the body were a sky that never darkens.\n\n○ This is **Chapter Sixty-Six**.\nThis describes the phenomenon of the **qi** flowing freely during the **warming-nurturing** phase—\nSuch is the true method of **nurturing life**,\nHow does it compare to the various minor techniques of life-nurturing in *The Chui Xu Yin* (Jade Emptiness Ode)?\nWith a **clear heart and bright eyes**, one can surely discern the difference.\n\nAfter the **qinsè** (zither and se) harmonize, the **jīqiú** (winnowing basket and quilt) is set aside.\nThe **qi** flows freely without need of **fires** (refining techniques),\nYet one must not fear harming the **baby** (nascent spirit).\n\nThis is when the **original spirit** (元神) is tempered and nurtured,\nNot the same as before when the **grain spirit** (谷神) was refined by **fires** (火候).\nFor now, the **grain spirit** has already merged with the **life-qi** (命气),\nJust as the **qinsè** has harmonized, and the **qi** circulates freely.\nWhen the **yang spirit** (陽神) is fully matured,\nIt is the time when the **jīqiú** is truly complete—\nNo longer bound by **emotions** (情) or **desires** (识好恶).\n\nIf one still stirs the **heart-fire** (心火) to refine,\nExhausting the spirit and **violating the qi** (暴气),\nThen the **qi** will not fully fill the **emptiness** (虚),\nAnd the spirit will struggle to attain its **completeness** (完夫实).\nWhen will this ever be achieved?\nThe **yang spirit** will be damaged beyond measure—\nThus one must simply let go of body and mind,\nCalm the spirit and still the **qi**,\nLet it flow freely on its own,\nNaturally filling and complete—\nNever probing its **fires** (火候).\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Seven**.\nThis speaks of **nurturing life** (温养) without **forcing** (助长).\nBefore, one exhausted the **nature** (性) to attain the **life-qi** (命),\nNow one must nurture the **life-qi** to guide the **nature** (性),\nOnly then can one return to the **root source** (本源).\n\n---\n\nWhen the **eldest son** (長男) enters **Dui** (Joy),\nThe **young maiden** (少女) returns to **Qian** (Heaven),\nThe **Xun Palace** (巽宫) aligns with the **earthly position** (土位),\nAnd the **passageways** (关锁) are sealed within the **Great Circulation** (周天).\nThe **eldest son** refers to **Lu** (Exposure), symbolizing **yang** (陽) in its nascent form.\nThe **young maiden** refers to **Dui** (Joy), symbolizing **yang** (陽) now mature—\nEntering **Dui** and returning to **Qian**,\nThis is the **original heaven** (先天) **hexagram** (卦) and **line** (爻) imagery:\nThe first **yang** (一陽) as **Zhen** (Thunder),\nGrowing to two lines as **Dui** (Joy)—\n**Dui** is the **young maiden** (少女)—\nThen to three lines as the **pure yang** (纯陽) **Qian** (Heaven) symbol.\nThe terms **\"just entering\"** (才入) and **\"already returns\"** (便归)\nShow how swiftly the **yang spirit** (陽神) matures.\n\nThe **Xun Palace** (巽宫) is the **nasal orifice** (鼻窍) of the body.\nThe **earthly position** (土位) refers to the **physical form** (形体)—\n**\"Aligning\"** (并) is the **Gen-Kun Palace** (艮坤宫) as mentioned in **Chapter Forty-Nine**.\nFor one **yin** (一阴) is **Xun** (Wind), two **yin** become **Gen** (Mountain),\nThree **yin** become **Kun** (Earth)—\nThis is the **earthly position** (土位).\nFrom the time the **nature** (性) determines the **life-qi** (命),\nThe **yang spirit** (陽神) initially hides like **Zhen** (Thunder)’s single **yang** (陽),\nConcealed within the **heavens**, as the **grain spirit** (谷神) and **life-qi** (命气) flow,\nThe body grows strong like **Dui**’s two **yang** (二陽),\nThen swiftly fills as the **pure yang** (纯陽) **Qian** (Heaven) symbol—\nThe spirit now dwells in its **proper position** (正位) within the body.\n\nWhile the **qi** too, like the **Xun Palace**’s single **yin** (一阴), initially rests,\nThen stills as **Gen**’s **arrest** (止),\nAnd withdraws like **Kun**’s **concealment** (藏),\nFilling the body and flowing freely through the **four limbs** (四肢),\nReaching its utmost perfection!\n\nFor the spirit grows stronger through **concentration** (凝),\nAnd the **qi** becomes more abundant through **stillness** (寂),\nThis is the natural order—\nThere should be no **excess or deficiency** (偏胜).\n\nYet within the **uterus** (胞胎), a trace of **blood-qi** (血气) remains uneliminated.\nIf one does not **guard strictly** (戒严), **withdraw deeply** (深藏), and **keep secret** (宥密),\nThere is still fear of **excessive movement** (好动) and **not abiding in stillness** (不安于静).\nIn **movement, stillness, sitting, or lying** (行止坐卧),\nIf one hears the **nasal breath** (鼻息) as having sound,\nOr if the **body** (形体) is **exhausted** (驰骤), **labored** (劳顿),\nThen the **qi** will **return to agitation** (返动心),\nAnd the spirit will **constantly stray outward** (神常外驰),\nLeading to **leaking the **Passageway** and losing the **qi**** (透关漏气).\nFuture attainment of the **Dao fruit** (道果) will be **unbalanced** (偏) rather than **complete** (圆),\nFor the **qi** overpowers the spirit.\n\nThus it is essential to have **true breath** (真息) flowing **leisurely** (悠悠),\nThe **body** (形体) **relaxed** (申申),\nThe **appearance and complexion** (容色) **serene** (夭夭),\nFollowing the **Six Qi** (六气) in their **circulation** (周流),\nConforming to the **Great Circulation**’s **rhythm** (运度),\nSo the **qi mechanisms** (气机) naturally **seal and lock within** (关锁于内),\nWithout the **flaws of imbalance or dissipation** (偏胜流失),\nThis is the **true nurturing of the Great Qi** (善养浩然).\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Eight**.\nThis speaks of the **nurturing life** phase when the **qi** is **strong and mature** (壮盛),\nRequiring no **artificial effort** (不假作为),\nOnly **restraint and moderation** (制节谨度) to preserve **fullness without overflow** (满而不溢).\n\n---\n\nThe **strings** (弦) after and before,\nThe **full and waning moons** (月圆月缺).\n**Withdrawing** (抽) and **adding** (添) mirror **punishment** (刑) and **virtue** (德),\n**Bathing** (沐浴) and **adjusting** (按) follow the **swell and ebb** (盈亏).\n**\"Strings after and before\"** (弦后弦前) illustrate the **qi’s** **ebb and flow** (消息),\n**\"Full and waning moons\"** (月圆月缺) point to the **qi’s** **swell and ebb** (盈亏).\n**Harshness** (刚) governs as **punishment** (刑),\n**Softness** (柔) yields as **virtue** (德).\n\nAt this time when the **spirit is flourishing** (神旺) and the **qi is abundant** (气足),\nThe **Great Qi** (浩气) flows freely, filling **heaven and earth** (天地).\nOne must not let it **agitate** (动荡),\nNor **suppress it** (抑制).\nOnly **withdraw when full** (因盈而抽) and **supplement when depleted** (因虚而添),\nStill applying the **method of firmness overcoming softness** (刚克柔克),\nSo that this **true qi** (正气) **constantly harmonizes and refreshes** (冲和以为沐浴),\nThen the **body** (体) will always be **relaxed and expansive** (舒泰广大宽平),\nWaiting for the **original heaven’s yang** (先天元阳) to **encounter summer and return to origin** (遘夏还元).\n\nIn summary,\nThe more **abundant the qi** (气体愈旺),\nThe more the **spirit withdraws** (则神愈退藏).\nDo not let the **spirit be enslaved by the qi** (勿使神为气役),\nThen the **yang spirit** (陽神) will naturally attain **completeness** (圆足).\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Nine**.\nThis speaks of the **phase of holding fullness** (持盈),\nEnsuring the **spirit is clear** (神清) and the **qi is still** (气静),\nAvoiding **excess or deficiency** (过不及) in either.\n\nAt this juncture, the three grades within the body have completed the **Pure and Chaste Essence** (太素贞白), and upon obtaining this **true lead of great red** (大赤之真铅), their fusion and congealing—intermingling red and white—yield the crimson.\n\nThe **marrow of Heaven and Earth** (天地髓) refers to this very **true lead**. When it is said that the **spirit, qi, and essence** are all fully suffused, utterly undefiled, and ready as **old cinnabar**, it is only that the **nurturing work** is yet insufficient. Once a single point of **true lead** arises and turns crimson, it becomes the **golden elixir of Great Return**.\n\nYet at this time, the **yang spirit** within the body merely abides in stillness and seclusion. One lets the **Heavenly qi** flow freely, until its completeness is fully realized and the **qi stands motionless in stillness**.\n\nAs the **White Boy** said:\n*\"Concentrate the heart, solidify the spirit,\nAttain emptiness, guard stillness—\nThen the empty chamber births the white.\"*\n\nTruly natural!\n\nThen one feels the body steadfast as a towering mountain, vast and high.\nSuddenly, a point of **true lead** emerges, deep and piercing—\nA radiant red heaven, for this is the **marrow of Heaven and Earth**, the very **original nature returning in summer**.\n\nIt stirs the earth and shakes the heavens, surging through the **mixed and chaotic**—\nMy spirit is thus enveloped in drowsiness,\nUnknowing, unaware, as if in deep slumber.\n\nAfter a moment, one awakens to **clear spirit and refreshed qi**,\nThe body as if aflame, the heart as ice released.\n\nIf speaking of further cultivation,\nOne must yet engage in **fusion and refinement**;\nIf speaking of its effects,\nThen the **light of nature shines universally**, penetrating the profound and subtle.\nOne hears the **Nine Heavens**, sees **ten thousand miles**,\nThe entire body pure **yang**—**golden sinews, jade bones**—\nThis is the **yang spirit manifesting in form**, able to move freely in nature.\n\nAs for the **Dao of longevity**, it is here complete!\n\nYet fearing that **yang has its yin counterpart**,\nAnd that the **six directions of emptiness** still linger,\nUnable to avoid the **coming and going of concealment and revelation**—\nHow could one then **consort with the Creator** and hold dominion over its beginning and end?\n\nThus, it is impossible not to **bind together** the **primordial chaos** of the past and the **manifested forms** of now,\nAnd **refine them into the golden elixir of Great Return**.\n\n○ **Chapter Seventy**\nThis speaks of the **yang spirit already formed**,\nThe moment when the **original spirit first unites**.\n\n※Within this chapter, the word **\"seize\"** (夺) aligns with the *Yin Symbol Classic*’s **\"steal the mechanism\"** (盗机).\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* states:\n*\"The Military Records say: ‘The ancients had the mind to seize from others.’\"*\nThey speak of war’s value in **spiritual swiftness**—\nSeizing the **vital points** before the enemy’s intent even stirs.\n\nHere, the study of cultivation lies in **spiritual might**—\nSeizing the **pivotal essence of yin and yang** before one’s own mind moves.\n\nThe **marrow of Heaven and Earth** is the **pivotal essence of yin and yang**.\n\nAt the **mysterious juncture of fire and time**, who from ancient or modern times would dare transmit it?\nNone have yet known how to **extract the elixir**,\nNor even inquire about the **circulation of the Microcosmic Orbit**.\n\n*\"Play\"* (玄) is *\"Heaven\"* (天).\nWhen the **original nature is restored** and the **yang spirit formed**,\nThere remains no **fire and time** to be applied within the body—\nThe **fire and time** lie only in the **path to Heaven**.\nFrom antiquity to now, who would clearly transmit it?\nBecause the world lacks those who can **restore life and nature**,\nNor those with the wisdom to seek—\nThus the **golden elixir of Great Return** remains unplucked,\nAnd the **fire and time of this Microcosmic Orbit** are not yet to be asked.\n\n○ **Chapter Seventy-One**\nThis follows the meaning of **\"seize\"** from the previous chapter,\nRevealing the first glimpses of **fire and time**.\n\n*Clouds disperse over the sea-pink moon,\nSpring deepens with willow winds.*\nWho knows this intent?\nGazing upward, questioning the void.\n\n**Note:** At this stage, one has obtained the **original official of the Great Polarity** as one’s body.\nThe **fire and time** is merely **forgetting the void to merge with the Dao**—\nA single move where **spirit and qi are entrusted to mutual oblivion**.\n\nThus, the opening line speaks of **clouds dispersing** while the **moon reaches the sea-pink**—\nAs if the **spirit is now utterly pure and luminous**, without sound or stench.\nThe next line speaks of **spring deepening** as the **wind blows through the willows**—\nAs if the **qi is now perfectly harmonious and unrestrained**, leaving no trace.\n\nScholars must apply this to **body and mind**,\nCompleting its structure—\nThe first line describes the **unmanifest emotions** as the **central equilibrium**,\nThe second describes **manifested emotions in perfect measure** as **harmony**.\n\nIn terms of its function,\nThe first line models the **Three Penetrations of Virtue** as my **inherent knowing**—\nThat which all share.\nThe second models the **Five Penetrations of the Dao** as my **inherent ability**—\nThat which all follow.\n\nYet regarding the **mysteries of the Microcosmic Orbit’s fire and time**,\nThe principle of **gathering and refining** has not yet been entered.\n\nAnd why does the text then say, *\"eyes question the void\"*?\nThis must be **self-body and self-enlightenment**—\nUnifying one to comprehend all,\nOnly able to attain the **original heart’s sincerity**.\n\nThus, in **action**, one aligns with the **common nature of humanity**,\nIn **stillness**, one merges with the **original mandate of Heaven**,\nEver nurturing the **undivided whole**—\nThen everywhere one touches, it is **penetratingly clear**,\nAnd one knows the **spirit and qi** have long since **naturally fused within heart and eyes**,\nAnd **vanished into the void**.\n\nWhy?\nThe **movement and stillness of qi** follow the **spirit**,\nYet the **spirit is always prior to qi**.\nThe **ascension and concealment of the spirit** depend on the **heart**,\nYet the **heart is even prior to the spirit**.\nThe **first impulse of the heart** lies in the **eyes**—\nThus the **eyes are truly the heart’s first impulse**,\nThe **primary concern of spirit and qi**.\n\nAs the *Yin Symbol Classic* says:\n*\"The heart is born from things, dies from things—\nIts mechanism lies in the eyes.\"*\nThus it is known that the **eyes are the first impulse of the heart**,\nThe **true priority of spirit and qi**.\n\nIf the **eyes flee**, then the **heart withdraws** and **qi is obstructed**, the **spirit perishes**.\nIf the **eyes are clear and inwardly gazing**, then the **heart is pure**, the **spirit condenses**, and the **qi expands**.\nIf the **eyes merge with the void**, then the **heart wanders at the origin of things** without attachment,\nAnd the **spirit and qi** remain **serene and ever still**.\n\nWhen nurturing reaches **stillness without stillness**,\nOne knows the **ten directions and three realms** are not outside the **One Heart**,\nPast and future are not separate from the **One Self**—\nOriginally unborn, now unextinguished,\nOriginally unreduced, now unincreased.\n\nThis **suchness**—who knows it?\n\n「Once, I inquired about this meaning from my teacher during his abode in the **Great Void (Tàixū)**.\nThe teacher was reciting the *Sutra of the Wordless Guan Yin*,\nand thus spoke: **\"The first sentence is like pointing at the moon to make others see it—\ndo not mistake the finger for the moon itself.\nThe second sentence is like the flag of a horned demon—\ndo not mistake the flag for the wind.**\n\nIndeed, after the **thunder and rain fill the form (xíng)**,\nthe scene of **radiant light, clear wind, and the moon’s brilliance (guāngfēngjìyuè)** unfolds.\nThe first sentence, with its **dispersion (sàn)**, is akin to the verse:\n*—But if one only sits in the heavens’ expanse, no need to turn back and see the white clouds dip low.*\n—**This is the Dao/Way of the spirit, the very essence of life (xìng)**,\nyet how can one cling to the metaphor and call it the **spirit** itself?\nThe second sentence, with its **depth (shēn)**, is akin to the verse:\n*—Casually recognizing the face of the east wind, one sees all purple and red blossoms—spring’s very self.*\n—**This is the nature of qi, the very essence of life (mìng)**,\nyet how can one narrowly call it only the **qi**?\n\nMy teacher, the **Dirt Pellet (Níwán) Master**, once left behind a **Dao/Way verse (dàojì)**,\nwhich reads: *\"The willows too should dance beneath the bright moon,\nthe magnolias bloom in the fine wind’s embrace.\"*\nAnd again: *\"The clouds drift freely, each home holds the moon,\nthe earth blooms with spring, flowers appear everywhere.\"*\nThis is precisely the **serene and boundless light of heaven (dàn dàng tiān guāng)**,\nan **unlimited mirror of clarity (wúbiān míngjìng)**,\nmutually containing and receiving all things,\nwithout fixed boundary or trace.\n\nYou must only **steadfastly abide in the close, subtle (mì), concentration, and insight (dìnghuì),\nand the equal observation (děngguān)**—\nthen from sincerity comes clarity,\nand clarity knows no obscurity.\nThus, you fulfill the **Dao/Way’s true nature of life (tiān mìng xìng)**,\nand **nature and life merge with the Original (yuán)**—\nhow then could the **Great Void (xūkōng)** be forgotten?\n\nTo **observe nature (zìrán)** and **merge with the Dao/Way (hé Dào)**,\nis to **unite with the Dao/Way’s true essence (hé Dào zhēn)**,\nand **eternally preserve the boundless rest of true emptiness (wúài zhēng)**.»\n\nThus, bowing deeply, he praised:\n*\"I dwell within the **Great Void (Tàixū)**,\nwhere **emptiness and clarity (xūmíng)** hold nothing at all.\n**Freedom is the Original Nature (zìrán)**,\nthe **True Self of Heaven (tiān zhēn)**—\ncool winds stir the vast moon.\"*\n\nSuch is the **Great Vehicle’s true teaching (Dàchéng zhèngzōng) of the wondrous Dao/Way of emptiness (xūwú miàodào)**.\nIf not for the **accumulated strength of sincere and steadfast contemplation (jiǒuxīng héngzhī)**,\nhow could one grasp even half a sentence’s **initial insight (xiān jī)**?\nThis was **authenticated by my teacher, the Great Void Treasure (Xūkōng Zàng)**—\neven if one travels to the ends of the world,\nwho could truly know this meaning?\n\n※From the *Yì·Tún Cò Guà* (I Ching, Tún Hexagram Commentary):\n*\"The movement of thunder and rain is full and overflowing.\"*\nThe **Han scholar’s annotation (xíng)** originally reads *\"swelling (yíng)\"*,\nbut this refers to the **abstract unity of the second, third, and fourth lines of the Tún hexagram**.\nAll the **Perfect Reality (Quánzhēn)** predecessors interpreted it as *\"form (xíng)\"*—\nI follow this tradition here as well.\n○[End of Chapter Seventy-Two]」\n\nThis follows the previous chapters, pointing to the **alchemical fire-refinement (tōngxuán)**—\nthe very **initial insight (xiān jī)** of **unifying the Primordial (héyuán)**.\nBy **integrating the Three Treasures** with the *Emerald Chamber’s* **Lü Xiucai’s single secret (Dìníhuán Chǔixū Yín Lǚ Xiūcāi yījué)**,\none comes to know the **subtle body and its wondrous application (miàotǐ miàoyòng)**—\nits **vast and minute (guǎngdà jīngwēi)** nature,\nrevealing the **True Realm of the Great Void (Tàixū Zhēnjìng)** in such ineffable splendor.\n\n○[**Human affairs weigh nothing upon one**,\n**Heaven’s path offers the steps of the Immortal.**]\nAlready **mastering cloud-riding**,\n**Awaiting the crane’s arrival to ascend the void.**\n\nWhen the **secret is directly attained (jié)**,\nthen **all dross is refined into pure gold (jiàngjìn yínchún)**,\n**Smoke and fire are extinguished (yānxīo huǒmiè)**—\n**embracing all phenomena (bāohán wànxiàng)**,\n**without a thread remaining (bùguà yīsī)**.\nHuman **entanglements dissolve (wùlèi wúguān)**,\n**Heaven’s Immortal path is now within reach (xiānjiē yǒufèn)**.\n\nYet one **does not dare ride the clouds alone**,\nbut **waits in reverence for the crane’s arrival to pierce the heavens (chōngxiāo)**.\n\n**Teaching others** is not to **boast of concealment or revelation (chūrù yǐnxiǎn)**—\n**only thus can one attain the Dao of transformation and ascension (zàobiàn fēishēng zhīdào)!**\n○[End of Chapter Seventy-Three]\n\nThis continues from the last chapter—\n**having clarified the fire-refinement (huǒhòu)**, one now **reaches the realm of elixir completion (dānchéng zhījìng)**.\n○[**The heart-field is free of weeds (xīntián wúcǎohuì)**,\n**The nature-ground is utterly free of dust (xìngdì juéchénfēi).**]\n\n**Under the moonlit quiet of the night, a single spring bird’s cry.**\nHere, the \"moonlit quiet of the night\" refers to the interplay of **Wuji** (無極) and **Taiji** (太極) in mutual concealment and revelation—\nillustrating the moment when **stillness reaches its peak and primal movement begins**, when **True Yang-qi harmonizes with the Original (yuán)**.\n\nThe \"single spring bird’s cry\" signifies the emergence of a single **true seed of transformation** from **Wuji**—\nmy **preheaven Five Phases essence (yuánxīng)**, the **golden elixir** born from **Heaven’s One (Tiānyī)**,\nwhich the ancient scholar **Zhou Dunyi** called **\"Wuji’s True Essence\" (wújí zhīzhēn)**,\nand **Chen Ti’an** named **\"a single cup of Hongmeng wine\" (yīzhǎn hóngméng jiǔ)**.\n\nOnce ingested, it frees one from **Yin-Yang’s bonds**,\nno longer bound by the **Five Phases’ constraints**!\n\n○**[Chapter Seventy-Four]**\nThis speaks of the **Dao of nurturing the Original Spirit (yuánshén)**.**\n\n---\n\n**White gold simmers through the Six Changes (liùguà),**\n**Black tin passes the Orchid Pass (Lán Guān).**\nWithin the **third watch of the night (bàn yè sān gēng),**\n**The golden crow enters the Palace of Broad Cold (Guǎng Hán).**\n\n**White gold**—the **Original Spirit now refined into singular, undivided purity**, like the **golden elixir’s sudden return**.\n\nThe **Six Changes (zhèn duì qián xùn gèn kūn)**—\nthe **Six Qi** in cyclical flow, unceasing, embodying **Taiji’s movement**.\n\"To simmer\" means **reaching supreme emptiness, uncarved**.\n\n**Black tin** is **lead (qiān)**, symbolizing the **Yang-Spirit**, now having **internalized the Original Spirit**,\nits body **softened and compliant**, like **lead and tin awaiting ignition**.\n\nThe **Three Passes (sānguān)**—\nthe **mixing and refining of Original Essence, Original Qi, and Original Spirit (yuánjīng yuánqì yuánshén)**,\neach transforming and returning to **void**.\nThis is when the **three leads are all perfected**.\n\nWithin the **third watch of the night**—\nthe moment when **Wuji’s primal seed of transformation stirs**, as in the **\"moonlit quiet\"** of the last chapter.\nThe **golden crow**, also bearing the **Three Legs’ meaning (sānjǔ)**, is the **soul of the sun** in heaven—\nhere, it borrows to signify the **primal seed of transformation**, the **\"spring bird\"** of the last chapter.\nThe last chapter spoke of **Hearing-Vehicles**; here, it is **Causally Awakened**.\n\n**Broad Cold** mirrors **Taiji**.\n\nWhen **nurturing is complete**, the **Original Nature contains the Six Qi in ceaseless circulation**,\n**reaching uncarved void**—\nthe **Original Command has passed the Three Passes**, arriving at **Wuji**, where **no further Dao can be practiced**.\nThen, **Wuji’s true seed naturally erupts**—\nmy **wondrous Original One-Qi (miàowú yuánqì)** returns and **mixes with the Original Spirit**,\nbecoming the **Great Return of Golden Elixir**.\n\nThus, **True Original-Qi bursts forth**,\nand one becomes a **True Person of the Wondrous Dao**—\n**able to endure the world, or withdraw from it**.\n\nLike the **Lion’s hidden tracks**, no lion can trace its path;\nlike the **Spirit Dragon’s transformations**, no dragon can compare its **mystic agility**.\n\n**How profound and wondrous! How perfect and divine!**\n\nThe **Wen Wang** thus bound **Heaven’s** *\"Use Nine\"* and beheld *\"the group dragons without a head\"*—a most auspicious sign.\nThis is called **refining the void and uniting with the Dao**,\nwhere **nature and life merge as one**,\nand the **Taiji remains ever whole**.\n\nYet though one first obtains the **Original Ancestral Essence of Heaven and Earth**,\none must still **unite with the Dao’s true essence** to **forever avoid decline**.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Five (above)**\nThis speaks of the moment when the **Original Spirit unites with the Dao**.\n\nWhen the **elixir is ripe**, there are **no longer Dragon and Tiger**—\nthe **fire terminates in the body of Mercury and Lead**.\nHaving **shed the mortal coil and attained divine transformation**,\none then becomes a **Pure-Clear Immortal**.\n\nThe **elixir** refers to the **True Person’s body**,\nthe **fire** to the **True Person’s heart**,\nand **Pure-Clear** is the **sublime domain of the Most High, Original Beginning, Miao Wu**.\n\nThis follows the previous chapter,\nspeaking of **refining the void and uniting with the Dao**—\nyet still **not fully merging with the Dao’s true essence**.\nOne must **connect with this true body**,\nno longer clinging to perceptions of **heart, body, or wisdom**;\nand **this true heart**,\nno longer divided into **yin-yang, spirit, or qi**.\n\nOnly through **exhausting the Dao of utmost sincerity**,\nand **devoting unceasing reverence**,\ndoes one **hide the spirit without intent**,\nand **need not feign emptiness to contain reality**;\n**nurture the heart without constraint**,\nnor **boil the hexagrams to still the vital mechanism**;\n**secure the body without rigidity**,\nnor **pierce the passes to refine the form**;\n**respond to things without self**,\nnor **cling to thought to attend to affairs**.\n\nThe **ten directions and three realms** lie within a single hall;\n**past and future** are but **one self**.\n**Hinayana and Mahayana disciples**—\nlike ice melting and snow brightening—\n**emerge, vanish, soar, and leap**,\nacting spontaneously in accordance with circumstances.\n\nWith a **serene and vast heart**, one **broadens the great aspiration**,\nand **resting the lead-mercury qi**, one **expands the cosmic balance**.\nWhen **true and false are utterly extinguished**,\nand **being and non-being are not distinguished**,\nonly then has one **truly united with the Dao**—\nable to **shed the mortal coil and attain divine comparison**—\n**ascending to Pure-Clear**,\n**forever becoming a Great Luo Immortal**;\n**transmitted through the ages**,\nknown as a **sage teacher of an era**.\n\nThis is the day the **Great Return of Golden Elixir** is complete.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Six (above)**\nThis speaks of the **elixir’s completion and divine transformation**, merging with the Dao’s true essence.\n\n**The Yellow Springs’ path is sealed shut**,\n**the Purple Palace’s gate is burst open**.\nHow could **Hai Zhan’s son**—\n**transformed into a crane**, emerging from the **muddy homunculus**?\n\nThe **Purple Palace** is where **Dong Hua Qing Tong Mu Gong** resides,\nthe **Dao Lord** is the **founder of the Full-Perfection Teaching**.\n**Dong Hua’s Purple Palace** is where the **Primordial Foundation is established**,\nand the **Minor Yang Emperor** selects immortals.\n\nIt is said that **only when the elixir is complete and one has undergone divine transformation—merging with the Dao’s true essence—**\ndoes one **forever seal the Yellow Springs’ path**,\n**directly ascending to the Dao Ancestor’s gate** to await selection as an immortal,\n**ascending to receive celestial honors**,\nor **becoming a sage teacher of an era**.\n\nThe earlier text likened the **Cold Hare** to the **completion of the Valley Spirit**,\nand the **Jade Hare** to the **vigorous Yang Spirit**.\nNow, the **Sea Hare** signifies that the **Original Spirit has obtained the true mechanism of Wuji’s transformation**,\nthus **piercing the muddy homunculus like a crane taking flight**—\nusing the **crane as a metaphor for the True Person**,\nspeaking of the **cultivator’s transformation from hare to crane**,\nnot referring to **Liu Gong, the Southern School’s Sea Hare**.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Seven (above)**\nThis speaks of **shedding the mortal coil and divine transformation**,\n**ascending to pay homage to the Dao Ancestor**—\nthe **final attainment of fruit and true essence**.\n\nWhere shall the rivers and seas return?\nTo whom do mountains and cliffs belong?\n\nOnce the **Golden Elixir** ripens,\nIt is the supreme treasure within one’s halls.\n\nThe **Dao of the Great Return Elixir of Golden Fluid** has been expounded in full threefold,\nYet still I fear the world may read it and know yet not cherish it,\nCherish it yet not delight in it.\nIts root cause lies in clinging to mundane affections,\nFailing to awaken a single true thought to cultivate and establish one’s foundation.\n\nThus, I further reveal this chapter:\nWhen the Golden Elixir ripens,\nIt merges with the **Great Void** as one body.\nAll worldly rivers, seas, mountains, and cliffs are cast aside—\nThey are but household treasures.\nSpeaking of mountains and rivers,\nI encompass all that is finer than them.\nTeach people to cast aside all worldly ties,\nHold fast to a single thought,\nAnd naturally, the path of **True Cultivation** will open,\nThe Dao will have no obstacles,\nSuccess will be inevitable—\nEven enlightenment for others will follow.\nOtherwise, when the **Impermanence** arrives,\n*\"All else will vanish, only karma remains to be transformed.\"*\nThen, even regret will be too late!\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Eighth**\nThis is written to awaken the true thought within people,\nThus stating that once the Elixir ripens,\nIt becomes one with Heaven—\nMountains, rivers, and the earth are all household treasures.\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"The vast eight extremes are all within my gates.\"*\nWas this not true?\n\n---\n**Lü Chengzhong’s Oral Instructions, Ge Laoshi’s Transmission to Zheng Xin.**\nNo idle words—only **mercury and lead**.\nLü refers to **Dao Ancestor Pure Yang Emperor**, the **Pure Yang Emperor Lü**,\nWhile **Zhong** refers to **Zhongli the Elder**, the **True Yang Emperor**.\nGe refers to **Lao Ge the Immortal**, surnamed **Xiaoxian**, the **Taiji Left Elder**.\nZheng refers to **Zheng Zhenren, Master of Thoughtful Retreat**.\nFrom ancient times, countless **High Immortals** attained the Dao through cultivation—\nLike Lü and Ge, whom all know and revere.\nYet their transmitted oral instructions contain no extraneous words—\nOnly **mercury and lead**,\nTeaching people not to seek the Dao through external beliefs or external means.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Ninth**\nThis speaks of the **Original Elixir Method**,\nThe **easy and simple Dao** of ancient sages,\nNot like other obscure arts whose methods are complex and difficult.\n\n---\n**Mercury and lead return to one crucible,\nSun and moon must share the same furnace.**\nWhen refining fire, beware of anger and desire,\nTeach you to **congeal the Jade Acid Butter**.\n\nThis reveals the **ultimate secret of Elixir Cultivation**:\nMercury and lead must merge as one,\nTheir natures must harmonize.\nIn the stages of **cooking, bathing, and refining fire**,\nThe essence lies in avoiding wrath and lust,\nAdjusting the heat with precision—\nDay and night, maintain utmost secrecy,\nThen **self and object merge**, the six senses grow still,\nThe mind becomes clear—\nNaturally, the Elixir congeals.\nThe term **\"Jade Acid Butter\"** speaks of\nNurturing the **Spirit** and **qi** so thoroughly\nThat within **warmth, refinement, and harmony**,\nIt achieves the subtlest fusion.\nFrom beginning to end, the **Three Great Intersections** are all thus nurtured,\nRequiring no effort—\nIts completion is swift.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eightieth**\nThis elucidates the **ultimate secret of Elixir Cultivation**.\n\n---\n**Gathering herbs and forming connections,\nRefining fire and bathing in elixir.**\nWhen the time of **shedding the mortal coil** arrives,\nThe **nine times nine of pure Yang** will be complete.\n\nThis chapter summarizes the entire text,\nClarifying the **ordered stages of Elixir Cultivation**,\nTeaching people to progress step by step—\nWhen the **pure Yang** is complete,\nNaturally, the **transformation of Spirit and form** occurs,\nAnd one ascends to become an Immortal.\nReaders must not squander this **sincere guidance** to return to the Origin!\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty-First**\nThis marks the sequence of the Elixir instructions,\nConcluding the meaning of all eighty chapters.\n\n**Note:** This entire section on techniques begins with **deliberate action**\nAnd ends with **effortless spontaneity**.\nThe **deliberate action** is to **rectify the body, stabilize the vital breath,**\nAnd **nurture the boundless and sincere**.\nThe **effortless spontaneity** is to **strengthen oneself unceasingly,**\nAnd **nurture the formless**.\n\nMy teacher once said to people:\n*\"If one straightens their body, empties their mind,\nAnd makes their thought **True One**,\nThen practicing the Elixir instructions will naturally be easy.\nEven without cultivation, it suffices to **ward off illness and prolong life**,\nAnd to remain strong in old age.\"*\n\nThis is indeed the **fundamental and supreme method** for beginners.\n\nFor if one straightens their body,\nTheir posture will have no crookedness or leaning,\nAnd their **five senses, four limbs, and hundred bones**\nWill all be orderly—\nExternal things will find no way to disturb them.\nIf one empties their mind,\nThe **flow of qi** will be unobstructed,\nAnd their **entire body’s meridians, tendons, and bones**\nWill have no stagnation—\nThus, the **qi returns to the Void**.\nIf one makes their thought **True One**,\nThey will act with sincerity,\nWith no hesitation in their heart—\nThen, the **yin essence** within will naturally congeal with the **true qi**,\nForming the **Spirit**, which then returns to its origin.\n\nThus, **body, mind, and intention** are always united,\nAnd the **Valley Spirit** is nourished in **unconscious awareness**—\nStrength and vitality naturally follow.\n\nTherefore, the **Method of Returning to the Origin**\nMust first uphold a **true thought**.\nIf the **true thought** is sincere,\nThen the body will naturally straighten,\nAnd the mind will naturally empty.\nOnce the mind is empty,\nThe **medicine arises**, and the **fire will be true**—\nThere will be no fear of **metal and wood obstruction**,\nNor of **water and fire failing to aid each other**.\nOnly when **Spirit and qi** merge in subtlety\nDoes the **Elixir congeal**.\nWithin this lies the **root**—\nThen nurture the **formless**,\nGradually leading to **no form, no body**,\nAnd the **Great Return of Golden Fluid** will be achieved!\n\n**Gold** is the **Heavenly One’s** self-generated metal,\n**Fluid** is the **Heavenly One’s** pre-natal water essence.\nThe **Great Return** is when these **Five Agents’** refined essences merge and congeal,\nRestoring the **Taiji** to the **Wuji** of **Prenatal Heaven**.\nOnce the **entire fluid congeals**,\nAdd the **functions of bathing and nurturing**,\nDay by day, month by month,\nFrom subtle to manifest,\nTo achieve **enduring and vast virtue**—\nHow could the body not become an **indestructible Golden Body**?\n\nThe **Source** is as such,\nAnd **Returning to the Source** is as such.\nFrom these words, one may suddenly awaken to the **Dao of Congealing Essence into Spirit**.\n\nThe **Method of Settling the Furnace** is to observe the initial three to four slender months of the moon’s cycle—\nwhen the intention of **nurturing and resting** is most harmonious and wondrous beyond words,\nhence the saying: *\"Refining the elixir requires seeking the reclining crescent furnace\"* (the furnace base is pressed firmly against the lower palate, with the body tilted upward on all fours).\n\nThe furnace base must be **expansive and void**, resting gently upon the **Lianquan** spring,\nwhile the furnace edges hover near the **lower teeth and Huiyan** junction** (the throat’s opening),\ndescending like a pendulum, its force clinging close to the **rear of the throat**,\nas though an infant were suckling—\nthen the **qi** and breath will easily descend.\n\nIf the furnace base is **fully hollowed**,\nthe **Heavenly One’s** **Spring-Summer-Growth-Autumn-Storage-Winter-Hiding** cyclical **qi**\nwill enter through the **Xuanpin** (the nostrils),\nflooding the **Dantian** and traversing the **Governing** and **Conception Vessels**,\nnot merely manifesting in men as the **testicles’ contraction** as proof,\nnor in women as the **breasts’ contraction** (the method of **massaging the breasts** is utterly mistaken)—\nbut also, the **qi** will naturally reach the soles,\nand one will feel the **Yongquan** at the foot’s heart as if ants were crawling.\nWhen this luminous scene appears,\none may say the furnace is **settled** and the elixir is **ripe**.\n\nOnce this body leaves the mother’s womb,\nit gradually forgets the **original path** of its **roots**,\nand after one year, the **Governing** and **Conception Vessels’** **pathways** become **blocked** for a year.\nIf further exposed to **wind, cold, heat, or dampness** of the **evil pathogens**,\nthe **viscera and bowels** will close and **death** ensue.\n\nThus, the *Suwen·Tianzhen Lun* begins with:\n*\"Those who know the **Dao** have their **qi** and **vessels** always **unobstructed**.\"*\nand continues to:\n*\"The **Sages** transmit the **Heavenly One’s qi** to **penetrate Spirit and Mind**.\"*\nYet its words are **brief** and lack detail.\n\nStill, even **Huangdi and Qibo** (the Yellow Emperor and his minister) held this method in such high regard,\nand now, for mortals to **clear and unblock the Governing and Conception Vessels’ pathways**—\nhow could this be easy?\n\nIt must be done at the **child and noon hours**, seated facing south,\nstriving to **close the breath** as though it were **not exhaled**.\nWith all one’s might, direct the **qi** downward and **hold the breath**,\nrepeating this **once, twice, or thrice**,\nup to ten, twenty, or thirty times—\nthere will surely come a day when the **pathways are cleared**.\n\nIt is best practiced in **winter months**,\nwhen the **Heavenly One’s qi** is **concealed** and **yang** is **hidden**—\nthen the **qi** will be **conserved** without harm.\n\nIf done **gradually and leisurely**,\none must wait a full year before the **pathways** will open!\n\n**The Return to Source Chapter**\n\nThe Sage Tai Su sought the **Dao** of the True Essence,\nand wandered through all sacred realms.\nHe received the **orthodox method** in transmission,\nand vowed to take **saving the world** as his heart’s purpose;\nyet he singled out **preserving the Three** above all,\nand placed **nourishing life** as his highest priority.\nFor he said: *\"Learning the art of immortality is easy, yet mortals struggle;\nescaping the dust is not hard, yet mortals find it difficult—\nhow lamentable this is!\"*\n\nThe ancients spoke:\n*\"Clouds obscure the moon of wisdom,\nwinds of karma scatter the ocean of tranquility.\"*\n\nIn years past,\nby chance, he encountered his **preceptor**, the **Venerable Sage of Purple Yang**, Master Zhang.\nHis words of **ease** were but half a sentence;\nhis **verification and efficacy** were but fleeting moments.\nYet knowing that immortality could be **learned**,\nhe privately rejoiced in his discovery.\nWhen the **golden elixir** was **refined** and the **sage’s embryo** formed,\nTai Su composed *The Return to Source Chapter* in **eighty-one sections** (to correspond with the **pure yang of yin and yang’s cycles**),\neach in **four lines of five characters**,\nto instruct those who came late to the **Dao**.\n\n*\"Awaken early to the **True Essence**,\ndo not wait until old age when **lead and mercury**

      "translated_text": "**Preface to *Elucidating the Return to the Source***\n\nThose who cherish the primordial truth wander through sacred realms, seeking the transmission of the true Dharma, ever aspiring to benefit the world. They abide in singular devotion to the Three Treasures, with particular emphasis on the cultivation of life. For though the study of immortality is most simple, men make it difficult for themselves; though liberation from the dust is not hard, men find it elusive—how lamentable indeed!\n\nAs the ancients said:\n*\"Deluded clouds obscure the moon of wisdom,\nKarmic winds stir the sea of stillness.\"*\n\nYears ago, at a post station, I encountered my late master, the Perfected Zhang Ziyang. In words of utmost simplicity—no more than half a phrase—he revealed effects that manifested in but a moment. Thus I knew that immortality could indeed be learned, and privately rejoiced. When the golden elixir congealed and the sacred embryo attained perfection, I composed *The Return to the Source* in eighty-one chapters of five-character quatrains, offering it to later students that they might early awaken to the true trap. Do not wait until old age, when lead is spent and mercury scarce—awaken swiftly! Seek a master, inquire into the Dao, refine the golden elixir, ascend together the immortal ranks, transform and take flight—this is my deepest wish.\n\n---\n\n**Postscript**\n\nThose who refine the golden elixir must know that the winter solstice does not lie in the *zi* hour, nor is bathing confined to *mao* and *you*. Mercury and lead are neither saliva, essence, qi, blood, nor fluids. The *seven returns* are the return to the root; the *nine reversions* are the return to the source. When the essence of metal and the fluid of wood meet earth, they unite. Dragon and tiger, horse and ox—all are without form.\n\nAs my late master’s *Awakening to Reality* states: *\"The essence of the golden elixir lies in the divine water of the Flowery Pond\"*—this refers to lead and mercury. If one knows the origin of lead, one knows the source of mercury. Knowing lead and mercury, one knows the divine water of the Flowery Pond. Knowing the divine water of the Flowery Pond, one may refine the golden elixir.\n\nThe work of the golden elixir is accomplished in an instant—do not cling to the timetable of nine years or three years, nor fixate on years, months, days, or hours for its operation. As Zhongli said: *\"The four great elements of the body all belong to yin.\"* Thus one cannot seek within the body itself, but must seek the single yang essence within it. Yet this yang essence resides in one aperture, which ordinary people cannot fathom. This aperture is the Gate of the Mysterious Female, the very divine water of the Flowery Pond. Knowing this, one may gather and unite, then refine, bathe, and separate the embryo, followed by gentle nurturing. When the elixir is complete, how could one fail to discern its source, know its weight, or recognize its time?\n\nSince receiving my master’s teaching, I have known that this body need not die, and that this elixir must surely be achieved. Now that the great work is underway, I proclaim this to all future seekers of immortality.\n\n*Another postscript by Shi Tai of Apricot Grove.*\n\n---\n\n**Elucidating *The Return to the Source***\n\n*The Return to the Source*, in eighty-one chapters, was composed by the Perfected Shi of Apricot Grove during the Song dynasty. A disciple of the Perfected Zhang Ziyang, he was the second patriarch of the Southern Lineage. Moved by pity for those who study books in pursuit of the Dao yet fail to awaken to their own nature, he wrote this work to repeatedly clarify the path of returning to the root and source.\n\nThe method of returning to the source begins with unwavering adherence to right mindfulness. In the midst of daily ethical conduct, one must everywhere restrain anger and suppress desire, acting with sincerity and without pretense, practicing ritual—this is *refining the self*. Silently applying effort to purify the mind and forget emotions, one dredges and opens the *Du* and *Ren* meridians. Through vigilant solitude, one retreats and conceals within the profound—this is *laying the foundation*. Naturally, a single point of true yang qi emerges from the body, and a single drop of true yin essence flows from the heart. These intermingle and congeal into the elixir—this is the *elixir head*.\n\nFrom this point, the heart naturally abides in sincerity, and qi naturally circulates throughout. Over time, the heart is concealed within the heart yet unseen, and qi is stored within qi yet unfathomable. In stillness, one is empty; in motion, one is direct. Qi is fresh, and spirit is clear—this is *completing the body*. Only when the three temporal realms are fully penetrated, all conditions stilled, the six senses purified, and the square inch of the heart empty and luminous—only then, after a month of unbroken practice, do the medicinal substances flow ceaselessly. Throughout, one operates with pure stillness and naturalness, thereby returning to the source, reverting to the root, and uniting with the Dao—this is *perfecting the true*.\n\nSuch is the essence of the golden elixir. Yet the great key lies first in knowing the single aperture within the body, for only then can one begin. This aperture is the window of spirit and brightness, the origin of nature and life. When scattered, it disperses into the seven apertures; when returned to its root, it coalesces into one. Only one who can gather the body with the heart knows how to fathom principle and exhaust nature. Only one who can conceal the heart within the body can exhaust nature and attain life.\n\nFor the heart and body are the supports of nature and life, while nature and life are the root and stem of the heart and body. Essence and qi are the functions of the heart and body, while the heart and body are the gathering and storing places of spirit and qi. Thus, one who can gather the body’s qi with the heart causes spirit to return to the Celestial Valley, enabling the fathoming of principle and the exhaustion of nature. One who can conceal the heart’s spirit within the body causes qi to return to the Crimson Palace, enabling the exhaustion of nature and the attainment of life.\n\nOnly when principle is fathomed are desires purified; only when nature is exhausted are emotions forgotten. With desires purified and emotions forgotten, nothing disturbs the center. I alone guard the profound mystery of life, and suddenly the single aperture opens wide—this is *opening the barrier*. Perceiving that within it is emptiness without exhaustion, movement without cessation, one follows the transformations of opportunity and allows all to proceed naturally. This is what the *Book of Documents* means by: *\"The Dao-heart is subtle; only with precision and unity can one truly hold to the center.\"* And what the *Dao De Jing* means by: *\"The valley spirit does not die; this is called the Mysterious Female. The gate of the Mysterious Female is called the root of heaven and earth.\"*\n\nHaving returned to the root, one recovers life; recovering life, one returns the elixir. How could one not, by tracing the flow to its source, first return to the moment of receiving qi at birth? Returning to my origin, the valley spirit does not die.",

      "translated_text": "Guard well the beginning to secure the end, and the Golden Elixir may surely be accomplished.\n\n(Received) This treatise was graciously bestowed by my late master, the Venerable Tai Xu, who also instructed me in the essentials of superior-grade lead and mercury. I have pondered it in silence, daring not to presumptuously add my own interpretations, until a single word from the master’s illumination suddenly brought full awakening.\n\nThe method of returning to the source, as revealed in the sequence of this text, encompasses all oral instructions—from *gathering* and *joining* to *smelting*, *bathing*, *parting the embryo*, *warming and nurturing*, and finally the elixir’s completion and liberation—none other than the repeated elucidation of the Way of returning to the root and restoring the origin, exhausting the subtlest to attain the vastest.\n\nOne who cultivates accordingly may enter the inner sanctum of sages and worthies, may ascend the stairway of immortals and buddhas. Now that the karmic conditions have ripened, I reverently honor my master’s intent and expound upon the text’s subtleties. Here, I command my grandnephew Yang Lin to record the following:\n\n**Lead and mercury form the true body;\nYin and yang conjoin the Great Origin.**\n\nThe master said: *\"Lead refers to the body; mercury refers to the heart. When they meet the Origin in due time, this is the superior-grade elixir path.\"*\n\nMy humble observation: At the moment before birth when one first receives qi, a single aperture forms within, containing essence, qi, and spirit—these three intermingled as one, steaming and swirling within, growing day and night. By the tenth month, when the fetus is fully formed, with a sudden forceful cry, the primordial aperture bursts open, connecting to the seven orifices, and breathing begins.\n\nWithin the body, three valleys then emerge: above, the Celestial Valley of Mud Pill Palace, the abode of spirit; in the center, the Resonant Valley of Crimson Palace, the abode of qi; below, the Hollow Valley of Pass of Origin, later to become the abode of essence. At that time, primordial essence has already spread throughout the solid regions of the body and circulates; primordial qi has gathered in the central valley of Crimson Palace to serve as the foundation of life; primordial spirit then floats upward to the Celestial Valley of Mud Pill Palace to serve as the lodging of nature.\n\nPresently, primordial qi stirs and generates yang, beginning to flow into the lower valley of Pass of Origin to become essence—hence the lower valley is also called the Sea of Qi. Yet this essence remains primordial essence, still circulating with qi throughout the body. Whenever stillness reaches its utmost, the seven orifices merge back into one, and within the body, a single point of true yang qi rises to ascend toward the primordial spirit—this is what the elixir path calls *true lead*. Thus, the master designates the body as lead.\n\nPrimordial spirit, in stillness, generates yin, which also spreads into the central valley of Crimson Palace to become qi—hence the central valley is also called the Chamber of Spirit. Yet this qi remains primordial qi, still congealed with spirit, constantly generating fluid to nourish the heart. Whenever yang stirs, the single aperture is about to divide into seven, and from the heart first flows a single drop of true yin essence to meet the yang qi—this is what the elixir path calls *true mercury*. Thus, the master designates the heart as mercury.\n\nWhen lead-qi obtains mercury-essence to circulate, the physical form matures—hence *\"lead and mercury form the true body.\"* When yin-essence combines with yang-qi to ascend, primordial spirit congeals—hence *\"yin and yang conjoin the Great Origin.\"*\n\nIn truth, lead refers to the qi within the body, and mercury refers to the essence within the heart—these are the primordial yang-spirit and yin-essence that have descended into the postnatal state, resembling the hidden Qian and Kun within Kan and Li. Yin refers to the qi within the sea, and yang refers to the spirit within the chamber—these are the postnatal lead-qi and mercury-essence returning to the primordial state, resembling the postnatal Kan and Li reverting to Qian and Kun.\n\nSimply by inverting Kan and Li and returning the postnatal to the prior, spirit then lodges in the heart, resembling Qian; qi then relies upon the body, resembling Kun. Kun provides life—hence it is called *body*; Qian provides inception—hence it is called *Origin*. *\"True body\"* clarifies that the body has not yet leaked, remaining the body of the True One; *\"Great Origin\"* clarifies that the Origin has not yet dissipated, still holding the primordial of the Supreme Ultimate—both formed spontaneously at birth without reliance on artificial effort.\n\nThis chapter establishes the fundamental principle, explicitly pointing to the origin and showing that the body formed by the congealing of essence and qi serves as the foundation of primordial life, while the heart formed by the congealing of spirit and qi serves as the lodging of primordial nature. With body and heart attained, nature and life are complete; essence and qi daily flourish, medicine and fire are both prepared—one need only return daily to the True One.\n\n**Merely knowing the practice of the two eights,\nOne may refine the Golden Elixir.**\n\nThis means that when one attains this body, heart, nature, and life—with spirit relying upon the heart and belonging to Qian, and qi depending upon the body and belonging to Kun—if one can maintain constant clarity and stillness, the seven orifices long remain merged into one, still resembling a single formed Supreme Ultimate. Nature has not yet leaked away, resembling a solid golden elixir. One need only return to emptiness and unite with the Dao to merge with the true Origin—why employ deliberate cultivation with the troubles of restoring nature and life?\n\nYet after birth, the seven orifices have already become individually perceptive and cannot constantly return to the one aperture. Thus, the undifferentiated is shattered into knowledge, and knowledge in turn transforms into consciousness. From this point, the heart is moved by external things and develops preferences and aversions; the body encounters external things and experiences joy and anger.\n\nThe essence within the heart, once drawn by external objects, no longer obeys the governance of primordial nature, constantly chasing outward instead of nourishing the heart. Primordial nature, having no lodging, thus dissipates. The primordial spirit, previously modeled on Qian, now becomes hollow and transforms into Li.\n\nThe qi within the body, once stirred by yin-essence, no longer circulates in accordance with primordial life, constantly leaking outward instead of filling the body. Primordial life, lacking sufficient foundation, daily diminishes. The primordial qi, previously modeled on Kun, now becomes substantial and transforms into Kan.\n\nPrimordial spirit was originally solid, but by constantly chasing qi, it daily appears hollow. Primordial qi was originally empty, but by constantly flowing into essence, it reverses and appears solid.",

      "translated_text": "At last, the hollow grows ever more hollow, and the solid loses its solidity once more, giving rise to the afflictions of aging, sickness, death, and suffering. This is not due to any inherent flaw in the root or source, but rather the harm of pursuing the branch while neglecting the root, of mistaking the flow for the source.\n\nWhen spirit loses its solidity, the heart transforms in form to become Li. When qi loses its hollowness, the body likewise transforms in form to become Kan. Thus, the single spark of yang within the postnatal Kan-body is none other than the prenatal primordial qi. In the hexagram’s virtue, it resembles fire within water—hence it is called \"yang-qi.\" The single drop of yin within the postnatal Li-heart is none other than the prenatal primordial spirit. In the hexagram’s virtue, it gathers as water within fire—hence it is called \"yin-essence.\"\n\nThe term \"two eights\" refers to the symbolic numbers within the hexagrams. Kan-water is already formed water, its number six belonging to earth. The fire within water is newly born fire, its number two also belonging to earth—six and two both pertain to earth, forming one of the \"eights\" of earth. This represents the prenatal primordial qi issuing forth from within my body, metaphorically called \"lead.\" Li-fire is already formed fire, its number seven belonging to heaven. The water within fire is newly born water, its number one also belonging to heaven—seven and one both pertain to heaven, forming one of the \"eights\" of heaven. This represents the prenatal primordial spirit issuing forth from within my heart, metaphorically called \"mercury.\" Thus, whenever speaking of medicine or fire, one must refer to it as \"two eights,\" and no other number will suffice.\n\nThe phrase \"practicing the two eights\" is precisely the Dao of \"timely uniting the primordial,\" as the master taught—employing only purity and naturalness in its application. Now, recognizing the harm of mistaking the flow for the source and wishing to return to the root, if one does not restrain anger and suppress desires, there is absolutely no way to begin. If one wishes to suppress desires and restrain anger, then uniting and practicing these two eights will make spirit the fire and qi the medicine.\n\nAt the time of gathering, it is called \"medicine,\" for it is still postnatal yin-essence and yang-qi. At the time of refinement, it is called \"fire,\" for it belongs to the prenatal—spirit is yang, while qi is yin. Simply knowing how to employ spirit to guide qi is to use fire to refine medicine, which can then form the Great Return Elixir of Golden Liquor.\n\nThe term \"refinement\" implies the need for vigilance against danger and caution against risk, yet it still employs only purity and naturalness in its application. For the yang-qi within my body, now just returning from its temporary abode in the hollow valley, if not congealed by spirit, risks scattering. The yin-essence within my body, now just returning from its temporary abode in the responsive valley, if not circulated by qi, risks sinking back into its former state.\n\nOnly by constantly establishing the substance of the Dao through tranquility can one obtain true lead and mercury as the function of the Dao. When using these two substances—lead and mercury—to unite the primordial, they coalesce into one. The proper thought immediately retreats and conceals itself, congealing into profound stillness. Within thought, there is no thought—thus, in an instant, they congeal, returning to the moment when my born body first received qi.\n\nConfucius said, \"Essence and qi become things,\" does this not refer to the true body formed by the congealing of lead and mercury? Laozi said, \"There is a thing, undifferentiated and complete,\" does this not refer to the Great Primordial formed by the congealing of yin and yang? Master Zhang Ziyang said, \"Grasp the foundation of Kan and Li, and the three realms return to one body,\" does this not refer to the pivotal method of practicing the two eights to refine the Golden Elixir?\n\nThus, lead and mercury are yin and yang; the union of yin and yang is the Great Primordial; the Great Primordial is the true body. The true body, the Great Primordial, is my prenatal \"one that becomes two.\" When timely united, it becomes \"two that return to one.\" Now, one can suddenly awaken!\n\n**Chapter One (conclusion)**\nThis entire chapter serves as the guiding principle, revealing that body and heart, nature and life, spirit and qi, medicine and fire—all are complete from the very beginning of one’s existence. Thus, it spares no effort in clearly expounding the original source of human life to aid practitioners in personal realization. The following eighty chapters are all annotations to this chapter.\n\nThe next seven chapters systematically elucidate the methods of gathering, uniting, and refining. Chapters nine through fifteen teach the secrets of beginning practice. Chapters sixteen through twenty-four expound on the crucial openings, detailing the processes of refinement, bathing, guarding against danger, contemplating risks, as well as the methods of separating the embryo, nurturing, and forming the elixir. Chapters twenty-five through forty-eight re-emphasize the central tenets, unfolding the true mechanism so that readers may have all doubts dispelled.\n\nFrom chapters forty-nine to sixty-eight, the text clearly instructs on returning postnatal essence and qi to prenatal spirit and qi to form the Valley Spirit. From the Valley Spirit, one refines the yang-spirit, and from the yang-spirit, one further refines to restore the primordial spirit—ultimately returning the primordial spirit to the true Non-Ultimate to become a True Person, thus merging with the Dao in truth. The completion of the Golden Elixir directly reveals the ancient sages’ intent to thoroughly investigate principle, fulfill nature, and attain life—this teaching is earnestly imparted with meticulous steps.\n\nThe final three chapters once more invoke the heart-transmission of the ancient sages, earnestly urging the necessary union of spirit and qi, body and heart, nature and life, thereby summarizing the entire work’s meaning. If a practitioner has truly cultivated the work of refining the self, concentrating qi and unifying spirit, holding fast to the singular, numinous, and upright thought, then facing this text, they will naturally perceive the method as exceedingly simple and can immediately enter the Dao through seated practice.\n\nMercury is the marrow of the Azure Dragon; lead is the fat of the White Tiger. The yin-essence within the heart originally emerges from the fissure of the root of nature. Here, it is called the marrow of the Azure Dragon because alchemists use the Azure Dragon to symbolize the hun-soul. In the prenatal hexagram positions, it belongs to Li, residing in the east—thus Master Zhang referred to it as \"the Wood of the Eastern Hun.\" The prenatal hun-soul remains concealed within Qian, unmoving. In the postnatal state, Qian becomes hollow at its center, transforming into Li. Li resides in the south and pertains to fire—thus Master Zhang also called it \"the Fire of the Southern Spirit.\"",

      "translated_text": "This speaks of the moment when the two substances, essence and qi, arise—precisely the time for their gathering. The method lies solely in summoning them at will to unite, returning them to the crucible. Thus Kan, now hollow at its center, reverts to Kun, while Li, now replete at its core, returns to Qian. When essence and qi merge within the crucible, Qian and Kun likewise unite to restore the Supreme Polarity. This is called the \"elixir head,\" which Master Zhang termed the \"true seed.\"\n\nTo return is to store; the crucible is the orthodox transmission of the *Yi*’s Dao. The alchemists’ watchword has no visible form—it resides at the very center of the sixfold harmony within this body. As the ancients said, \"Within lies a true golden crucible,\" yet it has no fixed location to confine it. The *Yi* states, \"The crucible: the noble person rectifies their position and consolidates their mandate.\"\n\nThe \"time\" refers to the moment when *gui* arises—half of the \"living midnight.\" If one has not yet awakened, one should sit upright in meditation as practice. When stillness reaches its extreme and movement begins, this is the time of *gui*’s arising. Swiftly withdraw the proper thought and conceal it in secrecy for gathering; any diversion of intent will fail. This must not be sought elsewhere.\n\nIn sum: the yang-qi within Kan is true lead; the yin-essence within Li is true mercury. Kan and Li give birth to lead and mercury, while lead and mercury arise from body and mind. The function of body and mind is essence and qi, and the substance of essence and qi is nature and life. Extracting the yang from Kan returns it to Kun; filling the void in Li restores it to Qian. These two substances are like a wellspring—qi is primordial qi, essence transforms into spirit. When spirit and qi interact, Kan and Li revert to Kun and Qian. As they wondrously merge and congeal, Qian and Kun blend into the Supreme Polarity. From this point, yin and yang, movement and stillness become each other’s root, binding inseparably, harmonizing indistinguishably, and uniting purely without end.\n\nIs this not the simplest and easiest method of gathering?\n\n---\n\nThe maiden rides the lead tiger,\nThe golden elder straddles the mercury dragon.\nThe maiden is true mercury,\nThe golden elder is true lead.\nTheir names and meanings are detailed in Chapter Ten.\nThe tiger symbolizes the body,\nThe dragon symbolizes the mind.\nMaster Zhang said, \"The mind’s wildness is like a dragon,\nThe body’s ferocity is like a tiger.\"\n\"Rides\" and \"straddles\" describe the image of mutual mastery.\nWhen the two medicines are gathered into the crucible,\nYin-essence naturally masters yang-qi,\nAnd yang-qi governs yin-essence,\nForming an undifferentiated whole.\nYet if at this moment tranquility is lacking,\nThe spirit scatters outward,\nAnd the elixir head dissolves.\nOne must await the renewed gathering of lead and mercury,\nHence the following admonition to clarify the proper command.\n\n---\n\n*Jia* and *geng* clarify the proper command,\nRefining to forge a furnace of red.\n*Jia*, belonging to wood, symbolizes nature;\n*Geng*, belonging to metal, symbolizes indolence.\nThe \"proper command\" is an unbiased decree—\nWhat Confucius called \"straightening what is upright,\"\nWhat Master Bai termed \"the movement of thought as the Mysterious Female,\"\nAnd the *Wenyan* of Kun’s second line describes as \"the noble person’s reverence to straighten within.\"\nTo \"clarify the proper command\" is to first understand it in ordinary times,\nSo that when the moment arrives, a single reaffirmation suffices,\nAnd all parts naturally obey.\nAt the first union of essence and qi,\nOne must ensure tranquility of nature and ease of emotion\nTo preserve harmony without dissipation.\nThe method relies on the power of reverence and sincerity cultivated in advance.\nWhile the mind has not yet stirred,\nSwiftly clarify the Dao of nurturing uprightness,\nFirst concealing it in secrecy,\nSo that within thought there is no thought.\nEssence congeals with qi to form spirit,\nEmotion returns to nature in great stillness,\nAnd the elixir head solidifies without risk of leakage—\nWhat Mencius called \"nurturing with uprightness and causing no harm.\"\n\"A furnace of red\" is what alchemists call\n\"A furnace of flame forging emptiness,\nThe very path of refinement,\"\nWhat Mencius termed \"fullness radiating brilliance.\"\n\n---\n\nThe serpent’s po seizes the dragon’s marrow,\nThe tortoise’s hun subdues the tiger’s essence.\nThe serpent symbolizes emotion,\nWhich often responds to gentleness with joy—\nThe work of the po-soul, hence \"serpent’s po.\"\nThe \"dragon’s marrow\" symbolizes the yin-essence within the mind.\nThe tortoise symbolizes nature,\nWhich often reacts to shock with anger—\nThe work of the hun-soul, hence \"tortoise’s hun.\"\nThe \"tiger’s essence\" symbolizes the yang-qi within the body.\nThis continues from the previous chapter:\nWhen the proper command is clarified,\nEmotion is forgotten and returns to its original nature,\nThus the wild dragon of the mind is captured.\nAs essence ceases to waver and nature stabilizes,\nThe root of emotion is severed,\nSo the ferocious tiger of the body is subdued,\nAnd qi no longer stagnates.\n\"Seizes\" and \"subdues\" are but acting without contrivance—\nAs the saying goes, \"The tiger is tamed, the dragon is lowered,\nThe macaque no longer peers through the six windows.\"\nDoes this not describe it?",

      "translated_text": "Yet if one can resemble the recumbent moon, where then is the forging of red lead?\n\nTo resemble the recumbent moon is but a transformed image of the original mysterious aperture. Before the elixir is obtained within this body, one maintains inner purity and guards the One—all seven apertures return to the single aperture. Within it, emptiness and numinous clarity stand open, round and whole as an egg, for in stillness it contracts. When the elixir arises, the moment one’s true command arrives, the aperture turns upward like a vessel to receive the medicine, for as it is about to move, it also begins to open. Viewed from the side at that moment, its form resembles the recumbent moon. Once the medicine is received and merges into darkness, it returns to the egg-like guarding. For the instant a thought stirs, it settles again—the mysterious aperture opens only to contract once more. If moved by emotion and the heart stirs, the aperture will open into seven, and the medicine scatters. Thus, the ability to resemble the recumbent moon serves as verification of receiving the medicine. Yet this describes only its likeness, for it arises spontaneously, without form or substance to behold.\n\nRed lead, as Master Zhang states, is “true lead born in Kan, whose function lies in the Li palace”—the transformation from black to red. Yet even this has no color or appearance. To ask “where is it forged” is to remind that spirit has no fixed form, warning against attachment to deliberate action. This is what Mencius meant by “there must be doing, yet without fixation.”\n\nIn essence, once the cinnabar head is established, the medicinal substances arise at all times. If one can only clarify the true command, no external distractions will intrude. Within, it will naturally receive at all times. Over time, with qi abundant and spirit full, the Valley Spirit will naturally be replete.\n\nFor the cultivator, at first one suffers from not knowing the aperture; once the aperture is understood, one must vigilantly guard against its severance. Withdrawal and concealment beforehand are essential—purity and stillness are wondrously subtle. If one can withdraw and conceal beforehand, then when the moment arrives, one will not miss the opportunity, and subsequent thoughts will not disturb.

      "translated_text": "Building upon the previous chapter, once the cinnabar head is established, the medicinal substances arise at every moment, and the more one gathers, the more inexhaustible they become. Yet one must never turn the mind to calculation or measurement, for then this inner realm will naturally receive—absolutely no contrivance should be employed to hasten the process. This is what Master Zhang meant by “one grain begets another, from the subtle to the manifest,” speaking only of the grandeur of accumulation, without any form or image to liken it to.\n\nThe medicinal material opens the primordial chaos; the fire-tending refines the vast expanse.\nThe “medicinal material” is the term used at the moment of gathering; the “fire-tending” is the designation during the process of refinement—both refer to this essence and qi. To say “opening the primordial chaos” and “refining the vast expanse” means that this essence and qi emerge only in the midst of purity and stillness, when the seven apertures return to one, like the unmanifest within chaos, naturally unfolding. Refining it with the intent of purity, without distinguishing inner or outer, is like the formless vastness of the primordial state, naturally coalescing into success. This clarifies the earlier teachings on the true command and the waning moon, instructing one to grasp it with a mind free of effort, rather than through labored striving.\n\nAfter ten months, the immortal embryo transforms—only then does one recognize the work of the nine revolutions.\n“Transformation” is what Master Bai referred to as “shattering emptiness to reach completion,” the same as the later “transcendence of the embryo and spiritual transformation.” The “nine revolutions” are the nine returns. Nine is the completion number of metal, signifying the return of the yang qi within the body, not nine literal cycles. It means that when the medicinal material arises from nothing, one must refine it like the great creation’s primordial vastness, without pausing to assess its appearance. Only after three hundred days, when the embryo is complete, does one realize the work of gathering the body’s original yang qi when first forming the elixir.\n\nAbove, Chapter Six.\nHere, it speaks of obtaining the elixir and refining it, without clinging to form or seeking signs—its efficacy will become known in time. As the *Canticle* says, “Do not seek through examination.”\n\nWhere the dragon rightly conceals its pearl, where the hen just broods her egg—\nwho knows when lead and mercury unite? Precisely then may one drink the *daogui*.\n“Concealing the pearl” and “brooding the egg” illustrate the wondrousness of the aperture. The *Inner Landscape* states: “Once one knows to return all to the single aperture, one has grasped the method of dwelling in secrecy—simply be like the dragon nurturing its pearl, like the hen brooding her egg, with spirit unwaveringly fixed.” The word “who” carries profound meaning. My teacher, Master Taixu, in his commentary on the *Nine Heavens’ Heart-Seal Repentance Text*, said: “Neither self nor other, inexpressible yet forcibly called—‘who.’” The word “who” appears eleven times in this text, and each instance may be understood in this light. To say “who knows when lead and mercury unite” means only to conceal the spirit in secrecy, guarding purity and stillness, without distinguishing what is other or primary, what is self or guest, nor even whether the two substances have merged—this is true seamless union.\n\nThe *daogui* refers to the two earths, wu and ji, both numbered five, originally sharing the central position. After generation, they lodge in Kan and Li—Kan’s yang is the essence of wu earth, Li’s yin is the essence of ji earth. The ancients spoke of this as the principle of Kan-Li and the *daogui*; earlier scholars called it “the essence of the two fives”... to clarify that when Kan’s wu and Li’s ji meet, there is no intervening substance, and they unite in the center—hence *daogui*. It teaches that one should employ only the initial intent, which is the true command, the same as what the earlier sages called “the true of the limitless” and “the wondrous union of the two fives, congealed.”\n\nLaozi’s *Classic of Constant Purity and Stillness* says: “Without form, without emotion, without name—forced to name it, call it the Dao.” This is the true meaning of my teacher’s explanation of “who”—it is the Dao that may be employed when meeting the origin. The first thought after the initial one is already attachment; though correct, it has fallen into the postnatal, instantly turning into deliberation, and the two earths become separated by the nature of wood and the disposition of metal. Qi, being Kan’s wu, flows into breathing, and the water palace cannot preserve its source; essence, being Li’s ji, seeps into the bladder, and the spirit chamber cannot secure its dwelling. Thus, water-essence and fire-spirit cannot assist each other, and the four images are no longer at one’s disposal—how then can lead and mercury unite to congeal the immortal embryo? Therefore, the cultivator must take the ability to drink the *daogui* as the proper method for uniting lead and mercury. To say “precisely then may one drink” means that at the moment when lead and mercury first arise—when the heavenly heart’s stillness first stirs into the true command—this is when the two substances have congealed and may be refined. It does not say “use” but “drink,” implying the self-awareness of drinking water or broth, hot or cold. Where my intent is aware, refinement naturally follows, illustrating the wondrous function of the true command, where within use there is correct awareness—still, only purity and unbroken density are the work. From this, one may know that a moment’s effort already encompasses refinement. For the union occurs at the stirring of the thought, in an instant; refinement, self-contained and withdrawn, requires a moment’s duration to become firm. The union arises naturally; refinement is what congeals it. Thus, before the union, one works within the workless work, sitting in meditation to prepare for gathering. When the medicine arises, one practices effortless use within useful use, abiding in great stillness without thought or action—this is refinement. This is the subtlety within subtlety—how easily can it be spoken? Yet having spoken it, the words are already overly verbose. Let the reader condense and refine, apprehend it spiritually—it rests with the person.\n\nAbove, Chapter Seven.\nThis continues the previous chapter, elucidating the Dao of refinement: one need only maintain unbroken continuity, as Master Bai said, “Guarding against interruption and lack of focus.”",

      "translated_text": "Bathing relies on the Water of Kun, breath revives through the Wind of Xun.\nAt this stage, if thoughts are not sealed tightly, the fire scatters, and the body feels chilled. Yet when one clarifies the true mandate, the spirit returns to the center and qi naturally flows back—there arises a direct qi that steams through the entire body for bathing, and warmth returns. This is called \"relying on the Water of Kun\": as one’s bodily form has already transformed into the primordial, the northern position is no longer the postnatal Kan trigram, so this natural bathing qi is termed the Water of Kun. If distracting thoughts arise and disturb, the fire becomes impure, and the body feels restless and hot. Yet when one turns back to the correct mindfulness to quell agitation, the inner stillness remains undisturbed, and true breath gently blows, bringing coolness throughout—harmony returns. This is called \"relying on the Wind of Xun\": as one’s Kun body has reverted to the primordial, the southwest region is originally the Xun palace of the nose, so this natural breath is termed the Wind of Xun. This is the wondrous remedy for balancing cold and warmth—when the spirit returns, qi follows of itself, and one need not seek it in the qi aspect. Master Bai took vigilant awareness as \"conducting the fire,\" the steaming of true qi as \"bathing,\" and stilling thoughts as \"nurturing the fire\"—his method is precise indeed!\n\nThe infant has no affairs, dwelling alone in the Palace of Grand Tenuity.\nThe infant refers to the spirit formed when the yin essence within the heart has coalesced with yang qi, now returning to reside in the original palace of the Celestial Valley—called the Valley Spirit. The ancients likened it to an infant, for at this stage its spiritual power is still weak and requires one’s correct mindfulness to constantly sustain and guard it. The Palace of Grand Tenuity, in the heavens, is the Grand Tenuity Enclosure with the imperial seat at its center; in the human body, it is the central palace among the nine palaces of the head—the Mud Pill Palace, the abode where the Valley Spirit resides to nurture the true. My teacher often said: \"The infant is the true person—it must be in a state of leisure and non-use, idly and alone nurturing the primordial spirit.\" His meaning is profound! This is the light of self-nature. Within the human body, only this is true nurturance; when the true body manifests, it is the Perfected One of the wondrous Dao.\n\nAbove, Chapter Eight.\nThis continues the previous chapter, stating that after refinement comes bathing. If cold or warmth becomes unbalanced, it is always due to the spirit straying outward or thoughts disturbing within—one must swiftly correct the fault. Guarding the infant, dwelling alone in the upper valley, practicing non-action and stillness, allowing qi to circulate naturally—this is the remedy for harmony, without need to startle the spirit. If the spirit is startled, it clings to phenomena and remains adrift in the cycle of birth and death. From the previous chapter to this, the principles of the elixir foundation, gathering, union, refinement, and bathing are fully expounded. Yet the essential teaching lies in sustaining mindfulness for gathering, concealing mindfulness for absorption, stilling the spirit for union as delusions vanish, concentrating qi for refinement, and absence of delusion for congealing. When delusion vanishes, correct mindfulness endures; when correct mindfulness is concealed, delusion does not arise—the method is upright, simple, and unburdensome. The following seven chapters continue from this, elucidating the principles of nurturing, parting the embryo, and forging—all emphasizing pure stillness, complete non-action, to be inwardly realized and personally practiced. The phrase \"concentrating qi\" comes from the *Daodejing*, meaning one should be as self-sufficient in qi as an infant, practicing this without mental contrivance.\n\nIn the Purple Palace, seek the Maiden of Li; in the Vermilion Mound, pair with the Youth of Kan.",

To revert to the prenatal Kun trigram, one must seek the Yin within the southern Li to receive it. Li belongs to Fire, its color vermilion; vermilion and black blend to form purple—hence \"in the Purple Palace, seek the Maiden of Li.\" The Maiden is the Yin within Li, meaning the postnatal Kan body reverts to the prenatal Kun body. The postnatal heart corresponds to the southern Li trigram; to revert to the prenatal Qian trigram, one must seek the Yang within the northern Kan to pair with it. The Vermilion Mound is the name of a cavern on the Southern Marchmount, used as an analogy for the heart’s abode—hence \"in the Vermilion Mound, pair with the Youth of Kan.\" The Youth is the Yang within Kan, meaning the postnatal Li heart reverts to the prenatal Qian heart.\n\nYellow is the color of Earth; *pó* is an honorific for an elder woman. The Yellow Matron thus refers to one’s correct mindfulness.

Thus, the Three of body, heart, and intent are embraced as one Great Ultimate, forming this Valley Spirit.

Yet who brings this about?\nWood symbolizes inherent nature—once Purple Court is united with the Li maiden to form Kun, one may employ the virtue of gentle compliance to guide inherent nature, so qi naturally fills the void, ever attending Mud Pill to nurture life. Yet who truly enables this?\n\nAh, who escorts the Alchemical Maiden to wed the Metal Elder?\nThe maiden is the Yin essence within Li, entering Kan to become Kun—since she returns from Li to Kun as qi, she bears the image of a maiden returning to her dwelling, hence the Alchemical Maiden.\nThe Metal Elder is the Yang qi within Kan, entering Li to become Qian—since he returns from Kan to Qian and transforms into spirit, he bears the image of youth maturing into age, hence the Metal Elder.\n\"Wedding\" speaks of Yin essence departing Li to enter Kan, thereby pairing Kun with Qian, illustrating how the heart becomes the dwelling of the body and the body becomes the vessel of the heart, evoking the image of a bride following her husband.\nWhen Yin essence departs Li for Kan, Yang qi’s departure from Kan to enter Li goes without saying!\nAt that time, had my correct command not illuminated its virtue, foreseeing the future and concealing the past, how could qi nurture form to achieve compliance, or essence refine into spirit to achieve strength?\nNow, with compliant form paired to steadfast spirit, wondrously merging into the profound obscurity of the Great Ultimate, nature and emotion each attain their proper place—whose power is this?\n\nThe Metal Gate refers to the Dui trigram, Dui being the image of Qian’s metal gate; the Qian horse driving the Metal Gate symbolizes the *Guai* hexagram, when Yang qi is already abundant.\nThe original palace refers to the Gen trigram, Gen being the image of Kun earth harnessing wood as its palace; the Kun ox entering its original palace symbolizes the *Bo* hexagram, when Yin essence is already abundant.\nThe Alchemical Maiden refers to the single Yin atop *Bo*, returning to her dwelling to form Kun; the Metal Elder refers to the *Guai* image.\n\"Ah, who escorts the Alchemical Maiden to wed the Metal Elder?\" echoes the alchemical saying of \"half a catty matching eight ounces.\"\nFor the four Yang hexagrams contain eight Yang lines as half a catty, while the four Yin hexagrams contain eight Yin lines as eight ounces—together they form the eight trigrams as a full catty.\nThis speaks of the moment when Yin and Yang are equally robust: without the habitual reverence of sincerity and the tempered resolve of unwavering faith, who could withdraw the heart to conceal it in secrecy, allowing the single Yang atop *Bo* to naturally pair with *Guai* to form Qian, even as the single Yin atop *Guai* returns to *Bo* to form Kun?\nThus, the body fully embodies Kun’s compliance to nurture qi, while the spirit returns to Qian’s steadfastness to govern form.\nFrom this, the origins of generation and life are renewed, cycling through *Gou* and *Fu*, their transformations boundless.\nHere, the meaning of the next chapter’s \"cavern chamber generating auspicious qi\" is also elucidated, appearing more direct.\nYet in the highest alchemical teachings, earlier masters framed their words within the principles of the *Yijing*, not through hexagrams or lines, but by pointing directly to concrete realities, making them accessible to all.\nFor those with prior learning, one may observe the images and ponder the words to penetrate the profound meaning; for beginners, however, language laden with classical allusions may instead obstruct their perception.\nThus, in annotating this text, it is fitting to focus on the tangible elements within the human body, speaking plainly and concretely, so that all may see and know without needing to seek images or delve into abstractions—thereby upholding our teacher’s compassionate vow of universal deliverance.\nThis chapter, prompted by the \"Metal Gate\" and \"Wood Palace\" images left unaddressed in the primary commentary, clarifies their meaning lest it be lost to heterodox interpretations. It thus employs the *Guai* and *Bo* hexagrams to illustrate their mutual transformation into *Gou* and *Fu*, averting the calamity of excess and the regret of overweening Yang. May all reflect upon this.\n\n○ Above, Chapter Ten.\nThis elaborates on the preceding chapter’s principle of reverting to the primordial, all depending on the habitual practice of concealing correct mindfulness.\nFor since the initial coalescence of the elixir’s essence, spirit and qi have grown daily stronger, gradually enabling the separation of the embryo—one must then redouble efforts to preserve abundance, conceal spirit, and nurture qi.\n\nThe Alchemical Maiden is but sixteen, the Metal Elder precisely nine-three.\nThe Alchemical Maiden symbolizes the qi transformed from my Yin essence, sixteen being the number of a full catty, denoting sufficient measure.\nThe Metal Elder symbolizes the spirit congealed from my Yang qi, nine-three signifying inner Yang’s fulfillment, akin to Qian’s inner trigram reaching its third line.\nThis speaks of the stage in elixir refinement when the body’s spirit and qi are both robust, poised to separate the embryo—yet often unsettled by restlessness, if one indulges impatience, qi will agitate the heart, and the Valley Spirit will struggle to remain tranquil.\nNothing full fails to overflow, so the text specifies \"precisely sixteen\" and \"exactly nine-three\" to clarify the firing times, teaching one to remain vigilant in due season, neither arrogant nor anxious. Thus, inner beauty is contained, anger and desire do not arise, and the embryo’s separation incurs no fault.\n\nThe cavern chamber generates auspicious qi, their joyous union produces the firstborn son.\nThe cavern chamber symbolizes my body, the secret aperture within.\n\"Generating auspicious qi\" refers to the vigorous stirring of Yang qi within my body, the very sign of primordial life’s return and the nascent foundation of Yang spirit.\n\"Producing the firstborn son\" speaks of the initial conception of Yang spirit, like *Zhen* as the eldest son, superimposed upon Qian to form the image of *Lei Tian Da Zhuang*—a single Yang stirring in the outer trigram.\nAt this stage, with the body’s qi already robust and the spirit further concealed, Yang qi suddenly surges, instantly uniting with the spirit.

      "translated_text": "Just as the firstborn son is newly born, this is the return of primordial life—here the Valley Spirit achieves success, and one may preserve the spirit to attain immortality.\n\n**Chapter Eleven.**\nThis describes the phenomenon of primordial life’s return, elucidating the Dao of natural embryo separation. Should one read this and attain realization:\nWhen Yang flourishes to the point of overcoming, this is the image of the *Guài* hexagram. Swiftly withdrawing and concealing oneself, the upper trigram reverts to the initial Yang. This is what Confucius meant by “knowing the future and concealing the past.” *Guài* interchanges with *Gòu*, just as *Bō* interchanges with *Fù*—from this, Yang spirit takes its foundational birth. Only then does one understand why the “use of nine” and “use of six” are both auspicious and without regret.\n\n---\n\nLast night on the western riverbank,\nToad-light illumined the jade-green waves.\nGathered and brought to the jade chamber,\nWithin the crucible, the sun’s searing blaze.\n\n“Last night” refers to the time of primordial life’s return. The West is the *Kǎn* hexagram’s primordial position; *Kǎn* is Water, hence “western river.” The toad, originally lunar radiance, is called “toad-light” to symbolize the upward breakthrough of Yang qi. Whenever the text speaks of the Yang spirit’s initial foundation, it invariably compares it to the toad, alluding to its three legs and the upward breakthrough of Yang light. The “jade-green waves” symbolize the post-heaven bodily image of the *Kǎn* hexagram’s qi—*Kǎn* Water is inherently black, but when illuminated by toad-light, the water turns jade-green, hence “jade-green waves.” The “jade chamber” symbolizes my body, for once primordial life has returned, spirit and qi become dense and refined, thus called the jade chamber. “Within the crucible” refers to the spirit chamber. “Searing blaze” alludes to the method of “refining with focused qi” and “tempering through non-delusion.” It means that in the past, my primordial life’s return arose from the post-heaven *Kǎn* image’s abundant spirit and qi. Suddenly, Yang qi surged upward, breaking through the Celestial Valley, merging with spirit to transform into Yang spirit. Now, the body has reverted to the primordial, the *Kūn* image has resumed its northern position, and *Kǎn* has retreated to the West. Tracing back, it is like last night on the western riverbank, witnessing the toad’s light illuminating the water. I then gathered it and brought it into the spirit chamber, refining it so that it seethes and tempers itself—yet one feels only a gentle warmth, with no visible sign of searing blaze. Thus, it transforms into Yang spirit, and life is restored! This is the Dao of the jade tally preserving the spirit, so the Valley Spirit may not die.\n\n**Chapter Twelve.**\nThis continues from the previous chapter, stating that once primordial life has returned, one must preserve and harmonize the Great Harmony to ensure proper advantage.\n\n---\n\n*Lí* and *Kǎn* do not copulate,\n*Qián* and *Kūn* spontaneously generate.\nOne who understands this principle\nLets a single point descend into the Yellow Court.\n\nIt means that in the past, my post-heaven heart and body united, nominally called “conjunction,” like the sun and moon conjoining in the same palace—yet not true copulation. At this moment of life’s return, though called the copulation of *Qián* and *Kūn*, it is merely spirit congealing and qi gathering, naturally generating a perfect Great Ultimate. Should one grasp this principle, then all that the alchemical classics describe—“a single Yang within the body, a single Yin within the heart,” referring to two things—are but different names for the same origin. Their encounter naturally merges into a single right thought; when thought subsides and returns to the hidden, it descends into the Yellow Court.

      "translated_text": "Building upon the preceding chapters, this elucidates the essential principle that the beginning and end of the alchemical Dao all arise from spontaneity, and that the two must merge into one.\n\nWithin the Cinnabar Valley, spirit-water is born;\nIn the Yellow Court lies the Great Granary.\nNo longer thoughts of hunger or thirst arise—\nStraightaway one enters the immortal realm.\n\nThe Cinnabar Valley is another name for the Crimson Palace within the human body; the Yellow Court has already been discussed in the previous chapter. Here it is said that the central valley naturally generates qi, which spirals upward from the lower valley to meet the spirit, thereby producing spirit-water that irrigates the entire body. Thus, the Valley Spirit also receives qi in audience, just as the Great Granary ceaselessly stores and then releases spirit-water to fill the whole body. Within the body, there is naturally a nectar that irrigates without thirst, without any appearance of overflow; the Valley Spirit itself possesses a sustenance that sates without hunger, without any form of accumulation. Knowing this, one may dispense with all worldly theories of nourishment, and the heart will be free from any fear of hunger or thirst. If even hunger and thirst need not be feared, what other thoughts could arise? One may then settle the mind and withdraw, directly reaching the immortal realm—this is the teaching of a single thought unarisen, all illusions at rest.\n\nThis continues the above chapters, instructing one to hold fast to the right thought, withdraw into the hidden as the work, and never allow the mind to stray into other concerns, lest one err on the great path to immortality.\n\nThe intent-steed returns to the spirit-chamber;\nThe heart-ape guards the grotto-chamber.\nWith single-minded withdrawal, the spirit naturally does not scatter—once returned to the hidden, it is the Heavenly Heart. All conditions released, the heart abides within the body; seizing this state of non-doing, it too withdraws into the hidden.\n\nSpirit, essence, ethereal soul, corporeal soul, and intent—\nTransform into Purple Gold Frost.\nEssence is stored in the kidneys; when kidney qi is complete, essence rests securely in the kidney viscus, and one attains wisdom.\nSpirit is stored in the heart; when heart qi is complete, spirit rests securely in the heart viscus, and one attains propriety.\nThe ethereal soul is stored in the liver; when liver qi is complete, the ethereal soul rests securely in the liver viscus, and one attains benevolence.\nThe corporeal soul is stored in the lungs; when lung qi is complete, the corporeal soul rests securely in the lung viscus, and one attains righteousness.\nIntent is stored in the spleen; when spleen qi is complete, intent rests securely in the spleen viscus, and one attains trustworthiness.\nThus, the five viscera each hold one qi and each possess one virtue. If one can make intent sincere and the heart upright, then the five qi are all complete and each rests in its proper viscus, and the five virtues are also complete. This is the Confucian teaching of \"unity throughout\" and \"withdrawal into the hidden,\" which is the alchemical method of gathering the five phases into a single aperture. When the five qi converge as one, they can congeal into spirit—this spirit is the elixir. The \"elixir\" of the Quanzhen school is what the Confucian school calls \"benevolence,\" like the kernel within a fruit. It is called \"purple\" because the initial golden elixir is formed from the union of water and fire—water is black, fire is red, and their intermingling produces purple, as when Master Guan Yin saw Laozi’s qi as purple. It is not called \"elixir\" but \"frost\" lest one cling to the word and mistake it for a physical pellet, thereby accumulating delusive thoughts and causing qi blockages in the body, which would be a grave error. Thus, it is likened to frost formed from scattered dew: visible in its traces yet ungraspable when gathered, evoking the image of empty space pulverized. This describes the wondrous arising of the golden elixir within the formless to become true form—hence, Purple Gold Frost.\n\nThese two chapters further demonstrate that human cultivation and nurturance share the same work as heaven and earth.

      "translated_text": "Heaven suspends its images to cover all things, yet it nurtures only the imageless—thus its images grow ever more luminous, perpetually covering the myriad things without end. Earth solidifies its form to bear all things, yet it nurtures only the formless—thus its form grows ever more vast and deep, perpetually bearing the myriad things without leakage. Man dwells in form to complete all things, yet if he can nurture the formless, his form will endure ever longer, encompassing the transformations of heaven and earth without transgression, shaping the myriad things without omission. Thus may he attain longevity and lasting vision, his wisdom pervading all categories, his blessings flowing beyond the world, standing as the third between heaven and earth.\n\nMaster Bai Zi once said: *\"If man is not burdened by form, the world before his eyes is the Great Luo Heaven.\"* He also said: *\"Forget form to nurture qi, forget qi to nurture spirit, forget spirit to nurture emptiness, forget emptiness to merge with the Dao.\"* This single word \"forget\" is itself the absence of things. *\"Originally there was not a single thing—where could dust alight?\"* Why then cling to distinctions of what is essence, what is spirit, what is hun or po or intent? All returns to the single secret of nurturing the formless. Simply allow the natural flow of qi-transformation to fulfill the utmost sincerity of one’s inherent nature without cease.\n\nThe above concludes Chapter Fifteen. This continues the themes of the preceding chapters, elucidating the immaterial nature of the golden elixir and instructing how to begin the work. It is nothing more than sincerity without duality, nurturing the formless to merge with the imageless and formless—then true qi naturally flows through heaven and earth, and primordial spirit naturally gathers within the body, all achieved through the wondrous subtlety of inherent clarity and stillness. This is what Li Níwán called the *\"Three-One Sound-Symbol\"* and what Master Zhang referred to as *\"Grasping the foundation of Kan and Li, the three realms return to one body.\"*\n\nFrom the first chapter to this point, the text forms a comprehensive summation. The following nine chapters expound upon the key apertures and the nurturing of the elixir, further clarifying the meanings of the preceding chapters.\n\n---\n\nOne aperture, three passes—the three passes are the crucial junctures.\nSuddenly moving lightly, the divine water flows throughout.\n\nThis \"one aperture\" refers to the single aperture where the seven orifices return to their root. The \"three passes\" denote the refinement of essence into qi as the lower pass, the refinement of qi into spirit as the middle pass, and the refinement of spirit into emptiness as the upper pass—the highest-grade path of elixir refinement. Some identify the three passes as the post-mortem locations of the tailbone, spine, and jade pillow (lower, middle, upper), while others locate them in the front of the body as the magpie bridge, cinnabar palace, and pass of origin (upper, middle, lower). Our tradition also adopts this interpretation for its utility in establishing the foundation: dredging the Governing and Conception Vessels to dissolve long-standing illnesses and impurities, thereby enabling the later unimpeded flow of true qi. Yet this is achieved solely through emptying thoughts and forgetting emotions, without further contrivance. Here, however, the \"three passes\" need not be confined to such interpretations.\n\nThe \"aperture\" refers precisely to this single aperture within the true body—the pivotal juncture where essence accumulates, qi gathers, and spirit congeals. Simply abide in emptiness and stillness, nurturing to the point of formlessness, and suddenly the lead and mercury respond in unison, essence having transformed into qi, naturally ascending to the valley—this is the five qi returning to the origin. At that moment, spirit and qi interact, qi transforms into spirit, spirit congeals and qi gathers, then transmutes into divine water suffusing the entire body—this is divine water entering the flower pool. Allow it to circulate and move without pause, naturally and spontaneously, beyond the grasp of cognition, while one’s spirit remains settled in unshakable stillness—hence the three flowers gathering at the crown.\n\nThrough this, I realized that the transformation of essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness to merge with the Dao depends solely on the mutual forgetting of heart and breath within the formless and insubstantial. The method begins with interdependence, gradually withdrawing into concealment. From this interdependence in nothingness, concealment itself is forgotten in the moment when nothing remains to conceal—this is mutual forgetting. Profound and ever-quiescent, this is the transformation into emptiness. When quiescence reaches the point of no-quiescence, this is the refinement of emptiness to merge with the Dao.\n\nMy teacher, Master Taixu, once said: *\"The study of heavenly immortality revolves around the three—essence, qi, and spirit—turning within a single aperture, like a child in the womb, unmeasured and unweighed, the mother nurturing the fetus without effort, mother and child mutually forgetting yet at peace. It is like a pearl in a crystal dish, rolling and glistening, naturally round and radiant, with no dregs or obstructions within. Unlike other elixir methods that rigidly prescribe set times for refining essence into qi, qi into spirit, and spirit into emptiness—failing to grasp the secret of this single-aperture turning point—they cannot attain such intimate and authentic practice, resorting instead to trivial techniques, idle words, and arbitrary schedules to deceive and mislead.\"*\n\nOur tradition’s heart-transmission is the highest-grade elixir method. For our lineage’s heart-transmission necessarily takes the merging and transformation of spirit as the work of heavenly immortality. Thus, when examining the treasures of the school, every detail is clarified with concrete evidence. When instructing practitioners, they are first taught to seek the master within, to proceed with utmost sincerity and diligence, with utter simplicity and honesty. Only then, when beginning the elixir refinement, will subduing the tiger and dragon, refining the hun and po, become effortless. Returning to the secret of the single aperture, one directly reaches the source of the three passes—no longer difficult. Thus, the great returning elixir of golden liquid can be accomplished in three hundred days.\n\nAll my fellow practitioners, I urge you not to be misled: do not mistakenly fixate on a cavity beside the spleen, imagining qi ascending and descending, calling it \"qi steaming,\" \"essence dripping,\" \"spirit numinous,\" or \"emptiness void\"—such misconceptions uproot the source and exacerbate errors.",

      "translated_text": "This continues from the preceding chapter, speaking of how prolonged firing and refining naturally give rise to the bathing of true qi, its warmth still taken as the standard—seemingly no different from the function of firing and refining. Yet one must understand: once the medicine coalesces within, the initial application of fire must be meticulous, and this is called \"firing and refining.\" Later, when true qi constantly ascends in audience, suffusing the entire body, its warmth and moisture are called \"bathing.\" Thus, firing and refining arise from the regulation of fire, while bathing is the natural power of the medicine. This is why Master Bai speaks of \"taking activity and stillness as advance and retreat\"—firing and refining are activity, bathing is stillness. Activity is the advance of fire, where there is use within the absence of use; stillness is the retreat of fire, where effort is applied within the effortlessness of prior effort. This must not be overlooked.\n\nSudden rain on paper butterflies,\nGolden furnace with jade peonies.\nAt midnight, a red sun blazes,\nIn the sixth month, pristine frost chills.\n\nThe first line depicts peril, the second danger; midnight signifies cold, the sixth month heat. The red sun dispels cold, pristine frost dissolves heat. This speaks of how, in the flourishing stage of the elixir path, one is often inclined toward movement rather than stillness, yet the fire regulation must occur in a state of non-doing and non-action. If the spirit is truly settled and still, with no thoughts arising within thought, the work is pure and nothing need be feared. But if one’s prior refinement of the self remains impure, upon reaching this state of non-doing, thoughts will inevitably stir, causing the spirit to scatter outward. The peril is like paper butterflies caught in sudden rain; the body grows cold as midnight. One must then draw upon the warmth of the red sun to dispel it, so the spirit returns to the Celestial Valley, the cold recedes, and warmth is restored. If thoughts grow restless, the spirit turns volatile, the danger like jade peonies cast into a golden furnace; the heart burns as in the sixth month. One must then draw upon the chill of pristine dew to quell it, so qi returns to the Crimson Palace, and restlessness naturally subsides into moisture. The key is to maintain no-thought within thought, movement rooted in stillness, always keeping warmth and moisture as the measure. Yet how can one obtain the sun at midnight or frost in the sixth month? If one seeks remedial methods at this stage, how can they be effective?\n\nOne must realize: midnight is precisely the *zi* hour, the sixth month when the sun is at *wu*. Cold is always likened to midnight, heat to the sixth month—these vivid warnings of danger from reckless movement also subtly reveal the opportune moment for timely adjustment. If one awakens to the location of the primordial embryo, one may then proceed to regulate it. For those who have not yet grasped the method, read the next chapter.\n\n○ Above: Chapter Twenty.\n\nThis continues from the preceding chapter, speaking of how, during the cessation of fire and bathing, all depends on the spirit’s stillness and qi’s movement to achieve fullness and ultimately part the embryo. If thoughts stir and qi scatters, peril arises—this is why Master Bai insists on \"taking discontinuity and lack of focus as a dike.\" Herein lies the insight.\n\nThose whose prior refinement of the self runs deep will not suffer this affliction. Those with the aspiration to cultivate the elixir—can they not first rouse vigilance?\n\nFire flies from the sea’s depths,\nEarthen springs flow from mountain peaks.\nIn a moment, union is achieved,\nThe jade crucible emits blue smoke.\n\nThe sea’s depths signify the *weilu*, mountain peaks the crown of the head. Golden fire is the fire of life, earthen springs the water of nature. \"Union achieved\" describes the harmony and balance attained in secrecy; the jade crucible is this single aperture of mystery, and the rising blue smoke is the sign of warmth and transformation.\n\nThis continues from the preceding chapter, addressing how to obtain the sun at midnight: one must direct the true command to fly the pure yang *qian*-gold fire of *kan* from the sea’s depths at the *weilu*, ascending to the crown and returning to *qian*—like the blazing red sun suffusing the body with harmony. How to obtain frost in the sixth month? One must guide the pure yin *kun*-earth springs of *li* from the mountain peak downward, returning to the sea and reverting to *kun*—like pristine frost’s chill bringing warmth and moisture throughout the body. Though expressed in two lines, it is in truth a single process: ascending from below to return to *qian* is called \"flying golden fire,\" while descending from above to return to *kun* is called \"flowing earthen springs.\" This is the method of \"advancing fire and retreating tally\" described in other elixir texts. Through such adjustment, in but a moment the entire body attains warmth and harmony, just as the crucible emits smoke—no further pursuit of qi is needed. Yet this is ultimately not natural but a last resort for remedy. Otherwise, the treasure should not be lightly toyed with, as Master Zhang has warned in detail.",

      "translated_text": "In sum, the study of human nature and life (*xingming*) lies entirely in guarding the mind like a fortress. Thus, when King Wen expounded the third line of *Kun* in the *Yijing*, he appended the phrase \"containing brilliance, it may be steadfast.\" ○ Chapter Twenty-One. This continues the preceding chapter, elucidating the method of remedy.\n\nIn my humble view: The nineteenth chapter above expounded the proper way of natural bathing; these two chapters teach the means to remedy deviations, which is why Master Bai spoke of the practices of \"operation, withdrawal, and replenishment.\"\n\nBreak open the Gate of the Mysterious Origin; surge through the Barrier of Chaos.\nThe \"Gate of the Mysterious Origin\" refers to the singular aperture of the mysterious image. \"Break open\" means to return the seven apertures to their root in this one aperture, whereupon it suddenly opens wide, and one directly perceives the original True Unity—rooted before the myriad phenomena, penetrating the inner and outer of the physical form, utterly void and utterly nonexistent, most wondrous and most mysterious. One feels only boundless obscurity beyond measure by inches, vast expanse beyond confinement by shores; its greatness has no exterior, its smallness no interior. It encompasses heaven and earth, yet enters the finest hairtip. Above, there is no further color; below, no further abyss. A single thing is perfectly complete, manifesting through the ages—this is the moment when the singular aperture unifies the seven, and the Mysterious Barrier stands fully open.\n\nThe \"Barrier of Chaos\" describes the time when *qi* has grown abundant, and the yang spirit dwells alone in the Celestial Valley, receiving the homage of *qi*, yet remaining in a state of primal undifferentiation, like a lump at the threshold of chaos. \"Surge through\" means that at this stage, the elixir’s power is sufficient, the fire’s force is complete, so vast and unyielding that it cannot remain hidden. One’s Valley Spirit has already beheld the Mysterious Origin, and the true aperture suddenly bursts open, whereupon the center glows with penetrating principle. Rightly positioned within the body, its *qi* courses through heaven and earth, its spirit commands the Dharma-body. Suddenly, one feels thunder’s roar and lightning’s flash, shaking heaven and earth; immediately, the hundred meridians bristle, the Three Passes are fully opened, the entire body becomes pure yang, and the form grows fiery hot—this is the true scene, not a metaphor.\n\nThe preceding line dissolves the former toil of refining thoughts and cleansing the mind through the six-day cycle, returning all to the root in a single stroke. The following line then directly points to the Great Dao of the Golden Elixir, unifying the seven in the one, nurturing it straightaway without harm—what Laozi called \"returning the report,\" saying \"serene, serene\" and \"restoring life.\" Only at this point is the original life fully restored!\n\nIn short: In the postnatal realm, it pertains to body and mind, and the work must proceed from movement to stillness to return to one’s prenatal state. Upon returning to the prenatal, it pertains to nature and life, and the work naturally shifts from extreme stillness to movement, exhibiting the image of \"leaping in the abyss.\" Without the foundation of \"day and night, establishing life in profound secrecy,\" how could one attain this?",

      "translated_text": "Yet knowing only to refine water and fire, one lets tiger and dragon coil at will. The refining of water and fire is precisely the work of gentle nurturing, as will be explained in the next chapter. The tiger originally symbolized the body, but here symbolizes qi; the dragon originally symbolized the mind, but here symbolizes spirit. At this stage, the mysterious aperture has already opened—no need to seclude oneself in the colored body for hidden cultivation. Yet the original nature remains unrecovered, just like the ninth-fourth line in the outer trigram of Qian. Confucius called this: \"No constancy in rising or falling, no permanence in advancing or retreating.\" One cannot ascend to join Heaven, nor descend to embrace Earth; one has not yet advanced to merge with the Dao, nor retreated to preserve the body. This is the time of congealing yet unsettled, when one can only gather the sack within, gently nurturing the sagely work.\n\nLike the spring first welling beneath the mountain in *Meng*, the noble one, through resolute action, cultivates virtue to nurture its stability as water. Like the fire first kindling beneath the mountain in *Bi*, the noble one, through illuminating governance, dares not adjudicate disputes, nurturing its wisdom as fire. In such refinement, one must proceed to the end without presuming completion.\n\nThus, in the perfect formula of *Heavenly Immortals’ Heart Transmission*, I say: \"Guard the Three Powers as an egg; yellow is the field of fortune. I dwell within, blending and transforming Kun and Qian.\" This means still congealing spirit and qi in the sincerity of unwavering unity, enclosing nature and life within the aperture of emptiness and spontaneity. Let tiger and dragon coil together, awaiting the meeting of wind and cloud—only then may one hope for the elixir’s completion.\n\n*(Lin’s note: My teacher once told others, \"To seek the essentials of the Golden Elixir, study the Qian and Kun of the *Zhouyi*, and the Dao will be complete.\" I, Lin, once read the sixth line of Kun and the ninth of Qian, and awakened to the method of gathering and refining. Reading the first line of Qian alongside the first of Kun, I understood the way of congealing and binding. Reading the second line of Qian alongside the second of Kun, I grasped the way of refining and tempering. Reading the third line of Qian alongside the third of Kun, I knew the way of bathing and cleansing. Reading the fourth line of Qian alongside the fourth of Kun, I saw that once the embryo is divided, one must proceed with gentle nurturing. Reading the fifth line of Kun alongside the fifth of Qian, I attained the way of elixir completion. Re-reading the sixth line of Kun and the ninth of Qian, alongside the ‘using nine’ and ‘using six,’ I finally awakened to the way of transcending life and death.

Yet one must nurture with gentle warmth until maturity is reached, only then will the elixir be complete.\n\nHowever, the work of gentle nurturing is difficult to bring to fruition within a set time—this depends on whether one’s usual practice of vigilance in solitude is pure, which determines its swiftness or slowness.\n\n*In the Sakaṭa’s waters, fire;*\n*On Kunlun’s peak, waves.*\n*Who can fathom its operation?*\n*The great intent lies with the Yellow Dame.*\n\n\"In the Sakaṭa’s waters\" points to the sea’s depths; \"on Kunlun’s peak\" points to the mountain’s summit. Though these two lines appear identical to the first couplet of Chapter Twenty-One, previously the words \"flying and circulating\" described the method of internal restoration within the physical form. Here, however, the spirit has already settled into its proper position to consolidate life, and qi has penetrated both within and without. One now knows that within the sea of Sakaṭa lies the treasure of one’s wisdom-life, and that atop Kunlun’s summit dwells the abode of one’s settled nature. There is no east or west, no distance; neither water nor fire ascends or descends. One simply allows the vast, upright qi to flow of itself, while all things grow together in the sacred work of gentle nurturing. Its operation differs greatly from the time before the barrier was opened. All that is required is a steadfast, reverent, and careful adherence to the great intent—never allowing flightiness or restlessness to disturb the body’s constant ease. In harmonious radiance, seated in unity, one may naturally await the return of the original nature.\n\nMaster Zixian Xue composed a song:\n*\"Water is true water, fire is true fire,*\n*As before, awaiting the season, circulating the celestial sphere.*\n*In harmony, refined to perfection—*\n*The treasure of long life.\"*\n\nThis may serve to illuminate its operation.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Three**",

Its position, slightly south of and near the Heavenly One, corresponds precisely to the crown of a person’s head, thus enabling direct resonance and infusion into the heart.\"* This principle is indeed well-founded, for it is the very origin of the primordial union of yin and yang at the moment of a person’s birth.\n\nI have further verified this with Chapter Seventeen, which describes what is obtained at this stage as the *\"marrow of Heaven and Earth.\"* Heaven and Earth are the Supreme Ultimate, so the Great One’s root in the Supreme Ultimate is precisely what He Quzi described as *\"the Supreme Ultimate flowing its essence in profound obscurity.\"* Yet the Supreme Ultimate is invisible, so it is likened to the Great One that governs Heaven. Thus, the essence of the Great One in the Purple Tenuity Palace is clearly the essence flowing from the Supreme Ultimate—rightly called the marrow of Heaven and Earth. However, this need not be discussed in detail.\n\nIn essence, human qi is originally interconnected with Heaven’s qi. At this stage of cultivation, one constantly fuses the true qi of the five returning to the origin with the primordial spirit of the three radiances gathering at the crown. Abiding in unbroken continuity, with the heart as still as ashes, one naturally awaits the return of the original nature. This is to seek the essence of the Great One as fire and gather the primordial qi as the elixir. With fire to refine the elixir, within stillness the cinnabar is formed—just as Bai Zi said: *\"It may be met without intent, but cannot be sought with intent.\"*\n\nThus, Master Zixian Xue composed a song:\n*\"The elixir is no thing, the fire no season—*\n*Clearly, it is but a single spark of yang,*\n*Refined into boundless life through ten thousand kalpas.\"*\n\nWe need only guard it in the formless clarity of stillness, and naturally the fire will forge the spirit into perfection—this is *\"within stillness, the cinnabar is formed.\"* If one seeks with knowledge, it is like Zhuangzi’s *\"Yellow Emperor losing the dark pearl,\"* sending knowledge to seek it in vain.\n\n**Chapter Twenty-Four**\nThis chapter, building upon Chapter Twenty-Three, clarifies that from gathering the elixir to the formation of the cinnabar, the process does not depart from the simple Dao of Qian and Kun—methods that are easy to know and simple to practice. With the right mindfulness, in natural stillness and undivided purity, after three hundred days of effort, one may thereafter roam beyond the world, playfully wandering among mortals, coming and going without obstruction, in harmony with the natural Dao.\n\nI note: From the first chapter to this twenty-fourth, the discourse on the cinnabar Dao is now complete. However, in explaining the stages of transmutation, gathering, union, refinement, bathing, as well as embryo division and gentle nurturing, one cannot avoid using metaphors, nor can distinctions be omitted for clarity. Yet I fear that later practitioners may cling to the words and become mired in imagery, mistaking it for something tangible and deliberate, thus failing to awaken suddenly. Even if they grasp its truth, they may still err in thinking the two (elixir and fire) must be used together, fixating on the labor of ascent and descent without realizing their unity. Even if they understand unity, they may yet cling to distinctions between inner and outer after refining the Valley Spirit, unaware that the true body originally encompasses form and dharma as one, inherently transparent within and without.\n\nTherefore, the following text will further expound upon Chapter Twenty-Four to clarify the central meaning of the preceding chapters. Though it occasionally employs metaphors drawn from things, its every passage dispels doubts, and each chapter reveals the true teaching. Its lingering resonance carries meaning beyond words—profound and far-reaching, it merits deep contemplation.",

      "translated_text": "The primordial qi—how to ingest it?\nTrue essence—no need to shift.\nTrue essence and primordial qi,\nThese are the foundation of the Great Elixir.\n\nWhat I speak of is the qi produced within my body—formless primordial qi, unlike tangible food that can be discussed in terms of how to consume it. The essence born of my heart is immaterial true essence, unlike external objects that are solid and heavy, and thus requires no transference.\n\nIf one can know the medicine and grasp the fire, one knows that medicine is fire and fire is medicine. True essence and primordial qi are one yet two, two yet one. Clearly, they form the foundation of the Great Elixir!\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Five.**\nThis chapter continues from the previous twenty-four, clarifying that the foundation of the Elixir lies solely in the union of these two—essence and qi—with no need for external seeking.\n\n---\n\nConfucians elucidate nature and principle,\nBuddhists strike at empty nothingness.\nUnacquainted with the immortal’s art,\nThe Golden Elixir’s work is momentary.\n\nThis speaks of how, in that era, both the sagely Dao and Buddhist Dharma lacked true transmitters. Confucians merely clarified nature and principle without investigating the primordial mandate as the root of nature. Buddhists merely struck at empty nothingness without exploring the primordial nature as the source of mandate. Thus, they failed to recognize the immortal’s all-pervading Way.\n\nWhat is called refining medicine with fire to form the Elixir is simply guiding qi with spirit to achieve the Dao—this is exhausting principle, fulfilling nature, and attaining mandate. Alas!\n\nThe former sages of Confucianism composed the *Zhouyi* and the *Zhongyong*; the World-Honored One of Buddhism expounded the *Vajra* and the *Perfect Awakening*. If one takes these and examines them together, one will know that the immortal’s art of the Golden Elixir is the art of benevolence. It can, in an instant, establish the foundation of transformation for the entire body.\n\nWhat the earlier Confucians called \"comprehending the one and completing all things\"—only then does one realize that since ancient times, the world has never had two Ways, and the sages of the Three Teachings have never had two hearts.\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Six.**\nThis chapter, following the preceding text, laments that people do not know how to unite essence and qi to form the Elixir. With profound compassion, it sharply admonishes the followers of the Three Teachings, urging them to explore the transmitted hearts of the Three Sages, practice the same art, and universally deliver all beings.\n\n---\n\nIn the crescent-moon furnace, mercury;\nIn the cinnabar tripod, lead.\nTortoise and snake—true unified qi,\nBorn in the prior heaven.\n\nThe crescent-moon furnace refers to the place within the human body where the furnace for refinement can be established, without need to fixate on specific locations. Cinnabar symbolizes the heart’s image; the term \"tripod\" signifies the heart’s inherent emptiness, capable of containing and refining things.\n\nThe tortoise and snake were mentioned in Chapter Four; here, they further elucidate the meaning of the first chapter, stating that the lead and mercury within body and heart originally derive from the true unity of yin and yang, all produced in the prior heaven. One need only attain emptiness and tranquility to observe their return—no external seeking is required.\n\nThus, the worthy Xue Zixian composed a song:\n*\"Crescent-moon furnace, cinnabar tripod,\nKnow to embrace the One and guard harmony,\nWithout concern for penetrating barriers or casting into the jade well.\"*\nMaster Xue was a disciple of Master Shi, having received the true transmission of this chapter’s secret and thus composing this song.\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Seven.**\nThis clarifies that the furnace, tripod, medicine, and fire are all present from the very beginning of our existence, lamenting that people remain unaware and fail to practice.\n\n---\n\nNew moon, full moon, crescent, and dark—\nDrawing and adding mirror waxing and waning.\nUnknowing of true creation and transformation,\nWhat thing is true lead?\n\nNew moon, full moon, crescent, and dark are images of waxing and waning, ebb and flow. \"Seeking\" means turning, not searching. \"Drawing\" means reducing when full; \"adding\" means supplementing when empty—all arising naturally.\n\nFrom non-being to being is called creation; from being back to non-being is called transformation—this is following nature. The Dao of the Elixir follows nature: the human body naturally has movement and stillness, the qi mechanism naturally has concealment and activation, just as the moon in the sky has new moon, full moon, crescent, and dark. One draws and adds according to its waxing and waning, never maintaining perpetual fullness.\n\nIf one does not recognize waxing and waning as the true mechanism of creation and transformation, then after the first crescent and before the new moon or dark, seeking the moon’s appearance in the west at dusk will be impossible. This illustrates that when refining the Elixir and gathering the medicine, one should embrace purity and stillness as the body and guard true lead as the function.\n\nIf the initial stirring of *gui* has not yet arisen, one will never find—even searching the entire body—what thing could be true lead. This further elucidates the meaning of Chapter Two: *\"To gather and refine, one must know the time.\"*\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Eight.**\nThe previous chapter having clarified the source of the medicine, this chapter specifies the time of its arising, hoping that all may know and practice.\n\n---\n\nQi is the life within form,\nHeart is the spirit within nature.\nOne who knows the cavity of spirit and qi\nIs indeed an immortal.\n\nForm is the body; the body relies on the stem of life’s true qi to live, thus qi is the life within form. The heart is the heaven of nature, where the primordial spirit gathers, thus the heart is the spirit within nature—meaning the heart is the chamber of spirit.\n\nIn sum, nature and life are the root of body and heart; spirit and qi are what body and heart emit. Thus, knowing that body and heart are the support of nature and life, body and heart are the cavity of spirit and qi. The perceptive person who attains this true cavity, gathers and stores it, has established the foundation of life in profound secrecy.\n\nWithout this knowledge, where does one begin the refinement of the immortal?\n\n**Above: Chapter Twenty-Nine.**\nThis further elucidates the function of body, heart, nature, and life, relying solely on spirit and qi for application, hoping that people will suddenly awaken to the method of return and restoration to regain their source.\n\n---\n\nWood marrow refines the golden tripod,\nSpring flow pours into the jade furnace.\nWood symbolizes nature; nature relies on the heart. The single point of true essence within the heart originally arises from the root of nature—this is my primordial essence, like the marrow within wood, hence \"wood marrow.\"",

      "translated_text": "This clarifies the source of mercury. Gold represents the primordial Qian virtue; the primordial heart originally belongs to Qian, hence the heart is metaphorically called the \"golden heart\"—the foundation upon which nature relies. Nature is inherently without flaw, thus it resides within the heart, which possesses all principles to respond to the myriad affairs. Just as smelting gold forms a tripod capable of regulating water and fire to refine the five flavors, it is called the \"golden tripod.\" The heart is originally perfectly pure; when untainted by external objects, it remains without blemish, and its essence and marrow can be refined into spirit. Yet since birth, without refinement, it becomes distracted by sensory desires, laboring the heart and instead being enslaved by form. Now, desiring to refine the elixir, how can one expect to condense essence into mercury? Therefore, one must first establish the correct mandate, purify the heart through stillness, and refine it to clarity, thereby completing the original spirit of one’s nature. Once lead arises, true mercury is produced, condensed and refined into spirit. Hence the metaphor: *\"Wood marrow refines the golden tripod.\"*\n\n\"Spring\" refers to water still within the mountain before its emergence, symbolizing my life. Life depends on the body; the single point of true qi within the body originally arises from the root of life—this is my primordial qi, like a flowing stream with its source, hence \"spring flow\"—this clarifies the source of lead. Jade embodies the primordial Kun body; the primordial body originally belongs to Kun, hence the body is metaphorically called the \"jade body\"—the foundation upon which life relies. Life is inherently vigorous, thus it resides within the body. At midnight, when a single yang stirs, it is like carving jade into a furnace, wherein fire warms and qi grows more temperate, hence the \"jade furnace.\" The body is originally perfectly still; when untouched by external objects, it remains free from illness, nourished by fetal breathing to mature. Yet after encountering external things, if one no longer cherishes it, the qi mechanism becomes agitated, flowing into essence and causing leakage. Now, desiring to refine the elixir, this qi is still deemed impure. One must first firmly uphold the correct thought, guiding qi to gather within the body, settling and purifying it, thereby attaining the primordial qi. Naturally activated, it refines mercury into spirit. Hence the metaphor: *\"Spring flow pours into the jade furnace.\"*\n\nWho among the bustling world would contemplate life and death’s great matter, rectifying the root and purifying the source of the heart and body’s essence and qi, refining them like gold and jade, and then devote three hundred days of effort, neither forgetting nor forcing, to cultivate it steadily?\n\n**Above: Chapter Thirty.**\nThis chapter, following the previous one—which has thoroughly revealed the origins of spirit and qi, seemingly allowing for sudden awakening and return to the source—addresses those who have yet to awaken. Due to deep-seated habitual defilements, their spirit is dull and qi turbid; the spiritual barrier remains unopened, and they cannot fully embrace it. Thus, it further instructs them to invigorate their spirit, refine and purify it, awaiting the proper time to commence the firing process.\n\nThe jade tripod refines lead fluid,\nThe golden furnace nurtures mercury essence.\nThe tripod symbolizes the spirit chamber; when the master within, through the cultivation described above, becomes clear and luminous, the spirit is as flawless as jade, hence the \"jade tripod.\" When lead qi arrives, mercury fire is activated to refine it, forming spirit water, hence: *\"The jade tripod refines lead fluid.\"* The furnace symbolizes the sea of qi; when the true qi within, as described above, is settled and purified, the qi naturally solidifies like gold, hence the \"golden furnace.\" When qi is produced, it must encounter mercury essence, which is naturally nurtured and enters the flowery pond, hence: *\"The golden furnace nurtures mercury essence.\"*\n\nNine returns are nine transformations, as explained in Chapter Six. Properly gathering the ingredients is the way of refinement and union. \"Resembling the revolving stars\" means following the celestial bodies that govern the four seasons and the regularity of dawn and dusk, all rooted in the heavens’ ceaseless motion, naturally revolving around the pivot without error. This illustrates that bathing and nurturing should be modeled after this principle. The main point of this chapter is to clarify that spirit is fire and qi is the medicine; when fire meets medicine, it vigorously refines, and when medicine encounters fire, it solidifies, thereby forming the returned elixir. \"Refining\" and \"nurturing\" refer to the process from union to refinement, employing Qian’s steadfast stillness to nurture until the bathing stage, when the embryo separates and the elixir is completed.\n\n**Above: Chapter Thirty-One.**\nThis chapter, building upon the previous one, states that after invigorating the spirit, when the time arrives and all converges, one can condense and refine the elixir. It further instructs on the precise nature of medicine and fire, enabling one to clearly understand the theory of the nine returns without doubt.\n\nJade fluid nourishes the spirit chamber,\nThe golden embryo forms the qi pivot.\nSeek only the medicine within the body,\nNo need to consult alchemical texts.\nJade fluid refers to heart qi, and the golden embryo refers to lead heart. When qi is sufficient to become spirit, it can refine the elixir. Therefore, one must first cultivate heart qi to nourish the spirit chamber, so that when lead is encountered, it merges into a single embryo. Once the embryo’s qi is formed, the entire body’s qi mechanism follows the celestial pivot like the revolving heavens, without errant movement. Thus, spirit is the qi pivot. When Kun constantly condenses, qi gathers without fail—all is the medicine within the body, which can only be sought within oneself. Alchemical texts of past dynasties merely clarify the main principles, teaching people to introspect and cultivate internally, without needing to consult them.\n\n**Above: Chapter Thirty-Two.**\nThis explains the correct method of union.",

The next chapter will address the errors of those who practice qi refinement and spirit preservation, lamenting their failure to grasp the subtlety of the superior-grade true formula.\n\n---\n\nRefining qi is but wasted effort,\nPreserving spirit is mere exertion.\nHow could they know the marvel of the elixir formula—\nAll day long, one delights in true emptiness.\n\n\"Delighting\" is like the roc soaring ninety thousand li and resting for six months, never straying beyond the heavens.\n\"True emptiness\" means spirit is real, qi is void.\nWhen I enter the qi cavern with spirit, the perception of emptiness and the emptied realm are both swept away, and the entire body becomes utterly transparent, inner and outer as one true emptiness.\n\"Delighting in true emptiness\" is what Master Haichan meant by:\n*\"Illuminating the body, long life is empty yet not empty;\nThe numinous mirror embraces heaven and holds the ten thousand things.\"*\n\nThis speaks of human primordial qi, which should only be nurtured, not refined—let it circulate freely, and it will be clear and unobstructed.\nYet some refine qi: if not through manipulation, then by breath-holding.\nLittle do they know that breath-holding and manipulation are techniques used in talismanic practices, where the emptied realm is feigned to store and deploy qi, creating an illusion of efficacy—this is refining through deliberate effort.\nIf true qi is already circulating naturally and one still refines it, this is fettering qi.\nFettering qi causes stagnation and blockage, and when asleep or unaware, it will inevitably leak out, wasting effort without result.\nThis is the error of those in lesser alchemical traditions who cling to the emptied realm, failing to grasp the principle of inner-outer unity.\n\nMoreover, primordial spirit should only be settled, not preserved through effort—constantly retreating into concealment, it becomes real and not hollow.\nYet some preserve spirit: if not through focused visualization, then by silent invocation.\nLittle do they know that focused visualization and silent invocation are practices used in ghostly rites, where the perception of emptiness is feigned to express reverence, achieving resonance—this is preserving through deliberate intent.\nIf the elixir spirit is already serene and one still preserves it, this is self-disturbance.\nDisturbing spirit shackles and unsettles it, inevitably driving it toward wandering thoughts and delusions, wasting effort without gain.\nThis is the error of the Two Vehicles in Buddhism, who remain attached to the perception of emptiness, failing to achieve the forgetting of both self and dharmas.\n\nChen Niuwan’s *Song of Emerald Emptiness* points out these flaws:\n*\"All stem from not understanding the true one’s correct formula,\nLeading to vain labor and endless harm.\"*\n\nHow could they know the marvel of the superior-grade elixir formula, which long ago swept away both the perception of emptiness and the emptied realm, achieving true emptiness without obstruction?\nSpirit naturally conceals itself in secrecy, nurturing the formless;\nQi naturally fills the void, meeting its ultimate limit.\nFrom the moment of the living zi hour’s true union onward to the living zi hour’s initial union, one remains serene all day,\nUsing activity and rest, movement and stillness as fire and timing.\nRising with the sun to work like the roc in flight,\nResting at dusk like the roc at rest,\nEating when hungry, sleeping when weary,\nResponding to events with compliance, returning to stillness when guests depart—\nThe ten thousand things cannot disturb my non-awareness,\nHeaven and earth cannot enslave my formlessness.\nFreely circulating through the six qi,\nI alone contain the myriad existences in sincerity.\nThis is the marvelous formula of \"tending the fire and timing all day\" from the previous chapter, and \"delighting in true emptiness all day\" in this chapter—\nWhy trouble with the vain labor of refining qi and preserving spirit?\n\n**Above: Chapter Thirty-Four.**\nThis chapter, following the previous one, speaks of the life treasure not to be lightly tampered with—only by concealing qi within qi without detection, concealing spirit within spirit without awareness,\nNeither clinging to emptiness nor to nothingness,\nLike a fish in water, carefree and at ease,\nResponding to things with integrity and compliance,\nDeparting from things with vast impartiality,\nExisting in perfect oneness—\nThis is the correct method of bathing.\nIf one can be thus, what danger need one fear?\n\n---\n\nTo refine primordial qi,\nFirst dry the living mercury.\nOnce the sacred embryo is formed,\nThe crown breaks open with thunderous roar.\n\n\"Living mercury\" refers to unrefined mercury—\nThe single point of yin essence in my heart,\nInitially unmet by lead’s refinement,\nLike quicksilver, lively and hard to control.\n\"Breaking the crown\" follows the meaning of \"chiseling through\" in Chapter Twenty-Two.\n\nThis speaks of treasuring the yin essence in my heart because, when it encounters the yang qi in my body, it can be seized and refined.\nYet essence, being yin, is like quicksilver—lively and prone to dissipation.\nHow can it gather qi to become spirit?\nThus, to refine primordial qi, one must first, in daily life,\nBe cautious and fearful, steadfast in resolve,\nThrough vigilance in solitude, retreat into concealment—\nTaking purity as the foundation, guarding lead and mercury as the function.\nWhen gui is born, exert unwavering strength,\nSeize this unruly yin essence like a dragon,\nWrestle and capture the fierce yang qi like a tiger,\nWrestle them into a death grip, surging upward,\nTurning back in a single motion—\nThen they unite joyously without separation.",

      "translated_text": "At that moment, my yin essence—long resented for its tendency to dissipate, likened to quicksilver—has its fluid wholly absorbed by yang qi, congealing into spirit and returning together to the formless cavity. This is called the Mysterious Female.\nAs Master Bai said: *\"Two mud oxen wrestle into the sea—henceforth, all trace of them vanishes.\"* Yet this describes only the initial formation of the elixir-head; thereafter, the coming and renewal of primordial life and primordial nature are all rooted in this profound concealment as their foundation.\nEven the true qi that perpetually arises in the body at ordinary times is none other than this \"spiritless spirit,\" wondrously merging and congealing within the realm of nothingness.\nDay after day, night after night, without reckoning the passage of days or months, the sacred embryo naturally takes form. One day, when the cavity at the crown breaks open, it becomes the gate of the Mysterious Female.\nSuddenly, this body seems to sit atop the heavens—only to behold thunder roaring and lightning flashing in the void, shaking earth and startling sky. In an instant, the hundred meridians all still, the Three Passes become radiantly clear.\nFrom then on, the body is as if ablaze, wholly yang throughout, all chronic ailments vanish, and dreams no longer arise.\nThe ancients revered this return of life as the reappearance of the primordial numinous treasure, the True Person of Original Life; in the return of nature, they saw the reappearance of the primordial Supreme Ultimate, the True Person of Dao and virtue. When refining emptiness to merge with the Dao, they called it the return of the primordial Wuji, the original unified qi.\nClearly, they took the Three Pure Ones, who unfold the transformations of heaven, as the true essence of the flowing unity of qi. Their teaching indeed contains profound truth, yet I humbly suggest that in the path of elixir refinement, the first steps are the return of qi and the return of spirit, followed by the revelation of the return of life, the return of nature, and the merging with the original source as the ultimate achievement—thus unfolding the essential aim of returning to the root and restoring the origin in a way that feels more intimate and less abstract.\nTherefore, there is no need to invoke honorific titles at every step; this is not to dismiss the established teachings of the ancients.\n\n---\n\nQi does not arise from the kidneys, nor does spirit reside in the heart.\nQi and spirit are elusive—\nThey transform into a single mass of gold.\nThis \"single mass of gold\" does not distinguish between the five qi, the three flowers, inner or outer, movement or stillness, form or dharma—it is simply nurtured with a tranquil mind in the formless.\nAs the *Taiyi Saving from Suffering Sutra* says:\n*\"Heavenly qi returns to the one body, all becoming natural spirit.\nThe natural has a distinct essence, originally in the empty cavern.\nThe empty cavern’s trace is no-trace, pervading the body with emptiness.\nFirst, entrust qi to stand;\nSecond, follow qi to arise;\nThird, complete the ten thousand dharmas;\nFourth, generate radiant light.\"*\nThis continues the previous chapter, speaking of the qi initially entrusted to the body, which returns from the dwelling palace of the empty valley to the responding valley—not originating from the kidneys.\nThe spirit transformed from yin essence returns from the responding valley, circulating with qi to revert to the celestial valley—not residing in the heart. Yet this remains within the tangible body, where grasping is possible, and does not yet manifest the Dharma-body.\nHere, form and dharma are merged as the practice of nurturing and refining.\nKnow that spirit has no direction, and qi has no form—what is concealed in secrecy is called spirit, and what fills the void is called qi.\nWhen qi and spirit interact, it occurs within the vast emptiness, leaving no trace to trace. Only in the midst of vagueness do they meet, and within profound obscurity does transformation arise.\nIf one seeks to find it, it can never be grasped; yet in the space between stillness and movement, a flash of flame scatters across the void—truly a mass of golden light, permeating the entire body.\nWhen employed, the true spirit manifests; when released, it hides within the unchanging stillness.\nThis is no mere metaphor—it is the true vision.\n\n---\n\nThe cavity is called the Mysterious Female,\nWithin it, qi and spirit are stored.\nWho knows this cavity?\nSeek no further for the real.\nThis chapter reveals the cavity formed at the moment of receiving qi at birth, which the ancients named the Mysterious Female. It arises only when I attain tranquility, the seven apertures return to their root, and essence and qi revert to congeal into spirit—this cavity can then contain them, hence the name Mysterious Female.\nThe key lies in that single moment when a steadfast and upright thought arises, allowing a brief instant of congealment.\nThus, Master Bai said: *\"The Mysterious Female is where the thought stirs.\"*\nThe Master taught:\n*\"Qi arises from the hidden abyss and becomes spirit—hence it is called 'Mysterious,' the true yin within Li, the yin essence within the heart. When qi congeals, it completes my celestial nature.\nQi relies on spirit to gather and transform into spirit-water—hence it is called 'Female,' the true yang within Kan, the yang qi within the body. When it merges with qi, it completes my original life.\nWhen qi and essence unite in one cavity, it is called the Mysterious Female. Who knows it?\nIf one understands why this cavity is called the Mysterious Female, then this single thought alone is real—beyond it, nothing is genuine. Why seek further?\"*\nMaster Zixian Xue composed a song:\n*\"The true Mysterious Female, the true Mysterious Female—\nThe Mysterious Female is but one cavity,\nNot in the mouth, nose, heart, or kidneys.\"*\nThis elucidates the chapter.\nMaster Chunyang said: *\"Trace back to the moment of receiving qi at birth—\nNo wonder the celestial mechanism is fully revealed.\"*",

      "translated_text": "The explanation grows ever clearer!\n\n**[On Chapter 37]**\nThis speaks of why the single cavity is called the Mysterious Female.\n\nThe spleen and stomach are not the chamber of spirit,\nThe bladder is but surplus of the kidneys.\nI urge you: cease your clinging attachment—\nThis is not the ladder of the Elixir.\n\nThe spleen and stomach store the qi of grain, not the chamber of spirit; one must not obstruct them, lest transformation become difficult. The bladder is merely the kidneys’ surplus, storing turbid water—do not mistake it for yang essence and recklessly circulate it through the River Chariot. The steps of the Dao of the Elixir lie not here; abandon your rigid attachments.\n\n**[On Chapter 38]**\nFollowing the previous chapter’s warning against external seeking, this cautions against internal misdirection, teaching one to nurture only the formless—this is the true ladder.\n\nA thousand poems of inner visions,\nA single cup of Central Yellow wine.\nCarefree, unburdened by things,\nBeyond the body lies Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Inner visions* refer to the scenes within the colored body. *Central Yellow* is the Yellow Court within the celestial axis. *Beyond the body lies Heaven and Earth* describes the radiance uniting the seven apertures—once the crown is suddenly pierced, one beholds a golden light pervading the colored body inside and out, formed from the vast qi of primordial Heaven and Earth. Boundless in expanse, infinitesimal in subtlety, it permeates the colored body, which is contained within it. Thus, the body beyond the body is the integrated whole of Heaven and Earth.\n\nAt this stage, the inner visions cannot be grasped, nor can fire be applied to the Central Yellow. It is best to compose verses in response to the scene, cultivating the nature of Heaven and Earth, and to harmonize yin and yang’s spirit with wine. Refining one’s temperament demands meticulous care, hence a thousand poems flow without obstruction; nurturing qi must not be excessive, hence a single cup suffices. Spirit and qi thus roam freely within the Dharma-body. Though this colored body soars ninety thousand miles or rests for six months, soaring at will, it never strays beyond the Dharma-realm, and no worldly desire can burden its spirit. This is the Way of mutual nurturance within and without—what Master Zhang called, *\"When the inner is unobstructed, the outer is also unobstructed.\"*\n\n**[On Chapter 39]**\nBuilding on the two preceding chapters, which swept clean and clarified inner and outer, this now emphasizes their mutual nurturance. One must refine temperament and cultivate nature, truly nurturing one’s vast qi. Thus, all three hundred rituals and three thousand deportments are the sage’s means of tempering harmony within Heaven and Earth, guiding each to the essence of their nature. Rooted in soundless music and formless ritual, moving with ease along the central path, ascending and descending in unity with Heaven and Earth—how could any external thing burden the spirit?",

This is to elucidate the aperture of returning, so that people may be enlightened. Thus, Master Bai’s saying, *“Returning to the root and recovering the mandate is the completion of the elixir,”* holds true.\n\nWithin the body lies the Mysterious Female,\nin the heart, no dust or defilement remains.\nWho can comprehend this?\nA single aperture contains the true.\n\nBefore receiving the true formula, the body lacks the Mysterious Female, so one must diligently wash away the dust from the heart. Once the cleansing deepens and the true formula is attained, with the arrival of the correct command, lead and mercury come together at once, without need for thought or calculation, and naturally retreat into concealment. From this, spirit resides in the Celestial Valley, and qi returns to the Crimson Palace—this is the Mysterious Female. Now that the body contains the Mysterious Female, spirit naturally abides in sincerity, qi naturally flows in depth, and the heart is utterly free of dust or defilement, so no further washing is needed. In this vast and empty state, the heavens stretch boundlessly—who among the unknowing can comprehend it? It is only because my spirit and qi have merged into a single right thought, concealed together within one aperture, nurturing the celestial true, undisturbed by externals. This heart thus becomes a luminous terrace, where dust and defilement cannot leave a trace. This teaches that one need not flee the world or shun desires—dwelling in the dust, one may yet transcend it. In sum, it is a practice of simplicity and ease, enduring and vast.\n\nMaster Bai’s words: *“Those who strive yet do not meet must meet a true person. Once the true formula is attained, likes and dislikes are all discarded, and when matters arise, judgment is always fitting.

      "translated_text": "Every person is fully endowed—why then do they not know to cultivate? The *Li* trigram illustrates the postnatal heart: the heart possesses yin essence but lacks restraint, thus like a dragon it runs rampant. The *Kan* trigram illustrates the postnatal body: the body possesses yang qi but lacks return, thus like a tiger it rages fiercely. Here, *Li* and *Kan* are called the true dragon and tiger—yet they must still be captured and tamed. The *Qian* trigram illustrates the prenatal heart, which Confucius in the *Shuo Gua* likens to a “fine horse.” The *Kun* trigram illustrates the prenatal body, which the *Shuo Gua* likens to a “mother-and-calf cow.” Here, *Qian* and *Kun* are called the “proper horse and ox”—for these are all docile by nature.\n\nThe cultivation of the elixir is fundamentally nothing more than refining away the obstinacy of the postnatal body and heart, and perfecting the docility of the prenatal nature and life. Every person possesses body and heart, every person is endowed with Heaven’s constant principle—why then do they not know to cultivate? It is because they have not obtained the true formula, and do not know first to conceal their spirit within the One Aperture. Thus, the hun and po are not at peace in the liver and lungs, all overstepping their bounds to usurp the kitchen, acting on likes and dislikes to indulge their joy and anger, daily flowing downward into filth without knowing to return. How lamentable!\n\nThe next chapter will clearly expound the method for molding the hun and po.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Four. This continues from the previous chapter, stating that every person possesses the material of immortality, and exhorting them to advance in cultivation.\n\nThe hun and po serve as the heart’s master, while spirit and essence are enveloped by intent. Steadfastly conduct the firing process, silently move the initial yang line. Intent is what the heart emits—it is where my thought first stirs. “Enveloped by intent” means to keep this thought constantly in mind, concealed in secrecy. “Steadfastly” means that as soon as a thought arises, it is like a seal matching its imprint, immediately withdrawing and concealing itself. “Silently” is like a commander deliberating affairs alone within the tent, allowing no outside interference—this illustrates how one gathers and trains the spirit to return to life, holding fast to this single intent in secrecy, not permitting the hun and po to usurp the heart’s mastery.\n\nThe “initial yang line” is where the thought first stirs. The Dao of the elixir takes spirit, essence, hun, po, and intent as its medicinal ingredients, yet the hun and po are originally stored in the liver and lungs, not the heart’s master. Within the heart, the true spirit naturally dwells in serene stillness, calmly governing the hundred bones, and all follow its commands. When it issues forth as intent, this is the first stirring of the true thought. With firm faith and careful guarding, it gathers the essence and qi, so the hun and po also submit and return to their proper places, enabling me to abide in benevolence and follow righteousness to nurture my virtue and power, which in turn nourishes my spirit.\n\nHowever, after birth, the heart engages with things and cannot remain concentrated and still. The spirit then flows into qi, and qi flows into essence, causing the qi to become substantial while the spirit becomes empty, leaving the heart without a master to govern the body’s organs. The hun and po, no longer content in their original viscera, instead seek to manipulate the spirit and usurp the heart’s mastery. When the hun—Wood—leaves the liver and dwells in the heart, Fire flares and injures the nature. When the po—Metal—leaves the lungs and dwells in the heart, it is smelted and the emotions flow unchecked. Thus, the hun loses its benevolence and vents its anger, while the po violates righteousness and indulges its desires. From this, anger, fear, likes, dislikes, worries, and disturbances surge within, suddenly and uncontrollably—all because the spirit does not guard its abode, allowing the hun and po to seize its authority and act as the heart’s master.\n\nTherefore, those who practice cultivation, knowing that the hun and po cannot serve as the heart’s master, must first gather and train the spirit, firmly holding to the true thought. When the true thought congeals, the heart and kidneys naturally communicate. The spirit and essence are then enveloped by intent and do not scatter, while the hun and po, drawn to the spirit, return together with it into the intent. This is the gathering of all elements, with the true thought now wielding authority as the heart’s master. Keeping this thought constantly in mind, steadfastly and unmoving, one conducts the fire of quietude and naturalness. Suddenly, one yang returns, silently circulating the Zhou Tian. The hun and po can no longer recklessly interfere with perception, and the yang qi is no longer shaken—it rises directly to meet and unite with the spirit. The true thought also merges to become spirit, and the elixir’s foundation is thus formed. This is the essential formula for gathering and uniting, and when compared with Chapter Sixty below, it further proves that the true thought must first be established.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Five. This continues from the previous chapter, lamenting that people do not know the proper method, and revealing the true formula for molding the hun, casting the po, and gathering the spirit.\n\nBelow the heart, above the kidneys,\nwest of the liver, left of the lungs.\nNeither intestines nor stomach,\nqi flows freely on its own.\n\nThis continues from the previous chapter. “Silently move the initial yang line” means circulating this yang qi—yet how precisely to circulate it, and where it returns, has not been fully revealed. Lest people, doubting, fall into delusion and cause grave error, the text now clearly points out the body’s interconnected passage. Yet it does not speak of a single aperture, but says it lies between the heart and kidneys, west of the liver and left of the lungs—neither in the intestines nor the six viscera. It seems to be in the spleen, yet Chapter Thirty-Eight states, “The spleen and stomach are not the chamber of spirit.” Thus, all substantial places in the body are not the homeland to which the true qi returns. It is only in this empty, secret space, like the Great Ultimate encompassing the Six Directions’ void, where qi naturally flows freely, without stagnation or the labor of circulation. Simply allowing qi to nourish the spirit, it comes and returns repeatedly. Over time, it can form the yang spirit throughout the body, and one may then suddenly comprehend the meaning of the One Aperture.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Six. This further clarifies the true Dao of emptying the heart so qi flows freely, dispelling doubts about seeking apertures and orifices.",

aperture is the secret key, the hidden stem—\nit need not be understood as a mere cavity or orifice!\nSpeaking of the Dao of congealing the elixir:\nit fundamentally relies on our true intention, inherently pure and quiescent in its essence.\nWhen essence arrives to unite with qi,\nqi then refines essence to become spirit.\nAt this juncture, the marvelous function arises solely from the wondrous fusion and coagulation of essence and qi—\nit does not depend on deliberate effort or contrived intent.\nFor instance, when yang qi arises,\nthough Chapter Two speaks of the necessity of \"knowing the timing\" for gathering,\nwhat is meant by \"timing\" is merely the true mechanism of subtle awareness within the secret,\nnot the measured moments of striking clocks or dripping clepsydrae.\nWho, indeed, can truly know this aperture of prior withdrawal and concealment?\nThus, at the moment of union,\nit is precisely \"acting within non-action\";\nbefore union occurs,\none must \"exert effort within effortlessness\"—\nthis is where our correct mindfulness should reside in non-action.\nUntil the time of fetal nurturance arrives,\ndo not prematurely surrender to non-action and fall into boundless dissipation,\nlosing the opportune moment.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Seven.\nThis continues the themes of preceding chapters,\nclarifying that the subtlety of the true mechanism must not be abandoned to mere non-action,\nlest one miss the moment and court danger.\nTherefore, our correct mindfulness must be ceaselessly maintained:\nin stillness, we cultivate the work of preserving and nourishing correctness;\nin movement, we apply the power of reflection and examination,\nso as to avoid error.\nShould an error occur, one fears a host of ills may arise—\nthe elixir overturned, life endangered,\nall prior efforts lost, and further refinement requiring time.\nFormerly, Bai Ziyu of the Southern Lineage’s Five Patriarchs,\nthough he had not yet awakened to the purport of *Awakening to Reality*,\nunderwent three refinements and three collapses.\nYet his heaven-endowed talent prevented disaster!\n\n(Sun Lin, in his early years of practice,\nknew only to purify the heart\nbut not how to sustain mindfulness and withdraw into the secret.\nIt was like chasing a thief while driving away the master of the house—\nthus, in stillness, he could not concentrate;\nin movement, he lacked directness;\nand in matters, he wavered.\nThis heart was half governed by the hun and po,\nand his spirit and essence could not be encompassed by intention.\nIn the winter of the *xinmao* year,\nhe was graced by a single phrase from my teacher at his ear—\nas if ambrosia poured upon his crown, sweet dew sprinkled upon his heart.\nAt once, he welcomed the master home,\ngradually sensing stillness as emptiness and movement as directness.\nIndeed, his daily practice became effortless,\nand in matters, he responded smoothly without difficulty.\nYet he had not yet awakened to the prior mechanism,\nand this heart remained unable to be constantly responsive and quiescent.\nHe thus built levees of restraint to guard against transgression.\nAfter another three years,\nmy teacher imparted this text,\ninstructing him to purify his heart and withdraw to listen.\nWhen purification reached its limit,\na half-word of marvel arrived—\nsuddenly, all was opened.\nThe teacher had deeply mastered the Dao,\nwishing Sun Lin to realize it for himself.\nHad the time not been ripe,\nhe might well have heard without comprehending.\nI humbly append this account of my arduous learning.)\n\nThere is substance, yet it is not nothing;\nNon-action harmonizes with action.\nThe power of transformation returns to one’s grasp—\nSun and Moon congeal golden fat.\n\nSun and Moon refer to the luminaries,\nsymbolizing the nature and feelings of Heaven and Earth.\n\"Golden fat\" is an image of concentrating qi to attain softness,\nlike metal in the crucible, supple as grease—\njust as Bai Ziyu said, \"Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, soft as silk,\"\nand Chen Ninwan said, \"Soft as a silk floss ball, hard as iron.\"\n\nEssence and qi are substantial, not insubstantial.\nWhen mercury meets the arising of lead, they congeal;\nwhen lead obtains mercury, it penetrates directly—\nthese are methods of action.\nYet if these two substances of action are left to linger and turn back,\nthey will flow downward and refuse to ascend—\nthis is not good.\nBut if guided by our non-action’s correct mindfulness,\nwe gather and unite the two substances of action,\nfirst withdrawing and concealing,\nthen the heart, free of distraction, returns together to the secret—\nthis is good.\nThus, the subtle power of creation returns to the grasp of the one who presides over it.\nThe three great barriers of before and after naturally align with the method,\nand one may wander with the Creator, wielding control over its beginning and end.\nWhen our nature and feelings are rectified,\nthe nature and feelings of Heaven and Earth are also rectified—\nhence Zisi transmitted the Dao of harmony and equilibrium,\nand the Pure Yang Master spoke of healing the world and praising transformation.\n\n○ Above is Chapter Forty-Eight.\nThis particularly elucidates the function of constantly preserving correct mindfulness,\nso vast and potent,\nserving as a summation of the meaning of Chapter Forty-Seven.\nThe following fifteen chapters teach the method of refining the Valley Spirit;\nfrom Chapter Sixty-Four to Seventy, the way of refining the yang spirit;\nfrom Chapter Seventy-One to Seventy-Eight, the method of refining and uniting the original spirit to shed and return to the source.\nThe principles are profound, the methods simple—\nthose with the aspiration to advance in cultivation\nshould further refine and contemplate them,\nso that through long familiarity, they may naturally enter the marvelous.\n\nThe tiger roars on the western

      "translated_text": "「] The black mercury yields yellow leaves, the red lead unfurls purple blossoms. One must further proceed with the fire’s alchemy, within the cauldron to congeal the cinnabar essence.\n\nThe \"heart’s essence\" (*xīn jīng*) has already followed the body’s *qi* and ascended, hence the metaphor of \"black mercury.\" The \"body’s *qi*\" has absorbed the yin essence and become spirit, hence \"red lead.\" When it is said \"to yield yellow leaves,\" it means the black mercury has already contained the yang *qi*, harmonizing with the pure yin *kūn tǔ* [yin earth], and congealing for a moment—now having obtained the nourishing earth *qi*, it yields the tender yellow leaves, the first sprouts of the yellow shoot. **Qu Jun** said, *\"The leaves bear the yin essence and flourish with the yang *qi*, likening yin congealing within yang and the auspicious signs of cinnabar formation.\"* When it unfurls purple blossoms, it means the red lead also relies on the black mercury, and during that moment of shared stillness, it has already obtained the fire *qi*’s vaporous influence—thus, it unfurls purple blossoms, for the hue between water and fire is purple. **Qu Jun** said, *\"The purple blossoms are the fruit’s seed-pod, likening water receiving fire’s aid and the initial foundation for cinnabar formation.\"*\n\nAt this juncture, if one recklessly indulges outward distractions, the spirit-*qi* will still scatter—how can it be permanently congealed to form the *gǔshén* [embryonic spirit]? One must urgently set aside body and mind, firmly store the true thought, and hold the luminous stillness as the alchemical fire’s refinement.\n\nLike an infant’s focused *qi* to attain softness, neither forgetting nor aiding—when one observes its eyes are open, the heart-*qi* is abundant, as if the cinnabar essence congeals within the cauldron. Its virtue/power (*déxìng*) is firm and congealed, and its *qi*’s nature is also steadied—only then can it be called the *gǔshén*, yet it still cannot preserve its immortality.\n\n○ **Chapter Fifty-One**. This continues from the previous chapter, further elucidating the method of mutual absorption and alchemical refinement.\n\n] The wood essence must guard against the hare, the metal essence must further forbid the rooster. Wood symbolizes nature, and the mind arises from nature, hence \"wood essence.\" The hare, in the earthly branches, belongs to *mǎo* [wood], and its time coincides with the hexagram *Léi Tiān Dà Zhuàng* [Thunder-Heaven, Great Strength]—a hexagram where yang *qi* flourishes beyond measure. When one takes this as a symbol, the mind has already attained its proper grandeur; upon seeing a petty person, it recoils as one would from foul stench. Anger arises with the world’s transformations, and fire erupts from wood—it will inevitably counter-naturally subdue itself, hence one must guard against it. If one waits for anger to manifest before restraining it, then nature is already disordered and the *gǔkūn* [embryonic earth] is in peril! Hence the saying, *\"The gentleman does not tread where there is no propriety\"*—this is how one steadies nature. Nature steadied, then the great is truly strong! Guard against it to remove moral obstacles.\n\nMetal symbolizes emotion, and the body arises from emotion, hence \"metal essence.\" The rooster, in the earthly branches, belongs to *yǒu* [metal], and its time coincides with the hexagram *Fēng Dì Guān* [Wind-Earth, Contemplation]—a hexagram where yin *qi* grows beyond measure. When one takes this as a symbol, the body has already thrived; upon encountering external stimuli, it succumbs to lustful desires, and the emotion overpowers—water leaks, metal withers—making it difficult to control emotion, hence one must further forbid it. If one waits for desire to stir before suppressing it, then emotion is already drawn and the *gǔshén* is in jeopardy! Hence the saying, *\"The gentleman contemplates his own life\"*—this is how one checks desire and forgets emotion. Emotion forgotten, then Contemplation is effortless! Forbid it to sever the demon of passion.\n\nDrawing and adding must be accompanied by bathing, precisely at the time of the full moon. If one practices such guarding and forbidding as drawing and adding, true *qi* will naturally circulate within the body, vaporously bathing and nourishing—from this point onward, one progresses. Just as in the hexagram *Zé Tiān Guì* [Marshy Heaven, Decision], one must take its hexagram virtue/power (*guàdé*), ruling *qi* with spirit, yielding to respond to the strong. Thus, my nature and emotions become harmonious and my spirit-*qi* flows freely, like the moon’s approaching fullness. Yet beware of self-praise and self-satisfaction, of exhausting *qi* and straining spirit—one must still retreat and hide deeply, imitating the gentleman’s bestowing of blessings upon others yet not dwelling in his own virtue/power, so that the heart expands and the body becomes plump, preserving fullness without overflow.\n\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Two**.

      "translated_text": "「Swiftly issue the correct precepts, then one may circulate the *Zhōu Tiān* [Complete Heaven, Circulation].\nA thousand sounds symbolize the myriad orifices of the body, a thousand peaks represent the channels traversing the entire form.\nWhen a person’s body and mind, nature and emotions, are refined to this stage, the spirit is complete and the *qi* is full, the myriad orifices open freely, and the channels are clear as crystal.\nJust as the first wind stirs all sounds, and the moon’s initial fullness illuminates the thousand peaks—this marks the transition from *Zé Tiān Guì* [Marshy Heaven, Decision], approaching the realm of *Chunyang* [Pure Yang, *Qián*].\nIt is the moment when the primordial command is about to revive, and the moment when the discerning spirit is about to transform.\n\nIf one does not strictly and closely preserve this internally, then when the body’s myriad orifices are fully open, the **Three Corpses and Nine Vermin** (*sānshī jiǔchóng*) will seize the opportunity to intrude and plunder. They will seize my **Grain Spirit** (*gǔshén*), causing it to escape through the body’s orifices, unaware of its dispersion—whether it becomes **flying, hidden, moving, rooted, fetal, ovate, moist, or transformed** (*wéi fēi, wéi qián, wéi dòng, wéi zhí, wéi tāi, wéi luǎn, wéi shī, wéi huà*).\nIt will take form according to one’s lifelong inclinations, and even one’s rightful awareness will be lost along with it. Thus, though one may not die, they will become dull and lifeless!\nThis is why those who know only how to advance but not retreat will inevitably meet regret.\nTherefore, at this time, one must urgently reiterate the correct precepts.\nStrengthen vigilance, maintain meticulous and sustained practice, guarding the **Precepts of the Embracing Bag** (*Guābā zhēn*), revering the **Symbol of the Leaping Abyss** (*Yuèyuān xiàng*).\nAchieve emptiness and preserve stillness, awaiting the revival of the primordial command (*yuánmìng*), then the discerning spirit will naturally transform, and one may broadly circulate the *Zhōu Tiān* [Complete Heaven].\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Three**. This follows the previous chapter, teaching the Dao/Way of maintaining secrecy.\n\nMedicinal substances must be distinguished by their aged or fresh qualities; the fire’s intensity must be adjusted by **drawing and adding** (*chōu tiān*).\nWhen the **single grain of Elixir Light** (*dān guāng*) arises, the **Cold Toad** (*hán chán*) emits radiance toward the **Jade Eaves** (*yù yán*).\nMedicinal substances refer to the revived primordial command (*lái fù zhī yuánmìng*), when the *qi* is excessive, it is aged; when insufficient, it is fresh.\nOne’s constitution and *qi* nature vary, and at this juncture of maintaining fullness, if one’s temperament is slightly unbalanced—\nthe bold may rush forward to meet it and thus lose through **suddenness** (*zhòu*), the timid may falter and fail to act, thus losing through **cowardice** (*qiè*).\nThe sudden will grasp it too quickly, and the medicinal substance remains fresh; the timid will obtain it too late, and the medicinal substance becomes aged—both miss the **middle fire intensity** (*zhōng huǒhòu*).\nHence, my correct precepts must carefully examine one’s *qi* nature and constitution:\n“**The forceful must not befriend the overbearing** (*qiáng fú yǒu gāng*), **the harmonious must befriend the yielding** (*xiè yǒu róu*), **the deep and hidden must overcome the overbearing** (*shěn qián gāng*), **the lofty and bright must overcome the yielding** (*gāo míng róu*).”\nOne must adhere strictly to this balance of **moderation and rectitude** (*píngkāng zhèngzhí*), maintaining secrecy within the rules, acting only at the right time—\nthen the medicinal substance will be perfectly suited, and subsequent **warming and nourishment** (*wēn yǎng*) will be effortless.\n\nThus, at this time, the fire’s intensity must be drawn and added appropriately, while still observing the strict and secret precepts.\nSuddenly, the single grain of Elixir Light (*dān guāng*) radiates forth, and one feels within the body like thunder or lightning—\nthis is the sign of the primordial command’s revival (*yuánmìng lái fù*).\nEven if it ascends straight to the peak, it will eventually rest in the **Heavenly Valley** (*Tiāngǔ*), as described in the later **Chapter Sixty-Four**:\n“**Retaining Mercury in the Golden Tripod**” (*liú gǒng jū jīn dǐng*).\nOne then perceives the pulse ceasing and breathing stopping, a moment of **boundless stillness** (*míngmò piànsī*), followed by a sense of **expansive heart and plump body** (*xīn guǎng tǐ pán*).\nThe skin feels refreshed and clear, all old ailments vanish, and there are no more dreams or slumber.\nFor the **Soul** (*hún*) has already melted into the spirit-*qi*, and the **Grain Spirit** (*gǔshén*) has merged with the revived primordial command to become the **initial foundation of the Yang Spirit** (*yángshén zhī chūjī*).\nThough the Heavenly *qi* has already returned to the body, the Yang Spirit is just forming—\nlike the faintest glimmer of the **Toad’s light** after the Winter Solstice (*dōngzhì*), which still requires **warming and nourishment**.\nThe light has not yet fully emerged from the eaves, hence the saying: *“the Cold Toad emits radiance toward the Jade Eaves”* (*hán chán shè yù yán*).\n\nThe fool notes: **The Gold Elixir’s three hundred days of cultivation** (*jīndān sān bǎi rì gōngfū*)\ncommences at this stage, when **preheaven true *qi*** (*xiāntiān zhēnqì*) begins to condense into spirit, allowing one to advance the Dao/Way without obstruction.\nRecently, other alchemical texts (*dānshū*) describe this stage and hastily write of the **Yang Spirit manifesting** (*yángshén xiànxíng*), yet this is still **spirit dispersing** (*shénchí*).\nIf they say it manifests within the body, it is still unsatisfactory.\nAs for the phrase *“manifesting form”* (*xiànxíng*), I do not know from where its phantom image arises.\nThe **Pure Yang Master’s** (*Chunyáng Zǐ*) *Qiaocao Song* [Divining-Stick Strike Song] states:\n*“With three lead, one lead is obtained, yet the Golden Fruit and Immortal Herb have not yet manifested form.”*\nThis serves as proof!\n\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Four**.」",

Thus, when **original essence and destiny** (*yuánmìng*) return to their source, this is the **success of the Valley Spirit** (*Gǔshén chénggōng*), the moment when one may **retain form and not die** (*liúxíng bùsǐ*)—the **initial formation of the Pure Yang Spirit** (*zhèngyángshén chūjié*).\n\nThe **nurturing and warming** (*wēnyǎng*) practices are detailed in **Chapter Sixty-Four** and beyond, while the following nine chapters expound upon the **essentials of returning the elixir** (*huándān*) and further reinforce the **exhortation to earnest practice** (*quànmiǎn zhī cí*).\n\n---\n**The Pearl within the Shell is easily split, the Hen’s Egg within the Nest is readily found.**\nFrom **nothingness, somethingness arises** (*wúzhōng shēngyǒu*), as **spirit-*qi*** (*shénqì*) naturally interpenetrates.\nIt speaks of how even **subtle things** (*wéiwù*) know to **remain still and focused** (*jìngzhuān*) until **somethingness is achieved** (*yǒuchéng*).\nLike the shell containing the pearl, like the hen brooding the egg—all belong to **somethingness arising from nothingness** (*wúzhōng néngshēng yǒuwù*).\nThus, one’s **elixir Dao** (*dān dào*) must be **steadfast and sincere** (*héngchéng*).\nOnly when **spirit-*qi* is steadfast and unshaken** (*shénzhù bùyí*), when **concentrated *qi* yields softness** (*zhuāngqì zhìróu*), and when **subtlety is sustained without interruption** (*mìmì miánmián*), will **spirit-*qi* naturally interpenetrate and coalesce**—this is all there is to it.\n○ **Chapter Fifty-Five**.»\nThis uses **material analogies to illustrate human practice** (*wùyǐ pìrén*), and further implies the **Dao of natural nurturing and warming after division and gestation** (*fēntāi hòu zìrán wēnyǎng*).

falter in the least.\n\nThe following three chapters then expound the **Law of Return**.\n\nThe soul and vital essence form three natures,\nspirit and qi gather the Five Phases.\nWithin them, four symbols divide,\nconcentrating to form the embryonic essence.\n\nHuman nature is fundamentally one,\nbestowed by Heaven (as the field above, grass below) upon my heart,\nwhile soul and vital essence reside in liver and lungs,\noriginally not permitted to stand alongside the heart.\n\nThe Master Qú remarked:\n*“Before cultivation, the heart of right and wrong is indeed one’s innate nature.\nIts branches and offshoots, its conflicting tendencies—\nthese are the work of the soul;\nits partiality and stubbornness, its disregard for justice—\nthese are the work of the vital essence.”*\n\nLi Shàn’s annotation in the *Wénxuǎn* states:\n*“The soul is the essence of the body, the vital essence the resolve of nature;\nboth can divide the authority of true nature.”*\nThis principle is most clear.\n\nThus, when ordinary people encounter matters,\ntheir first thought is pure and clear—\nrooted in the heart, it is true intention;\nbut when a second thought arises,\nit is the soul’s doing—\nthough doubt may linger, it is not yet wholly corrupt;\nuntil the third thought decides,\nit is the vital essence’s creation—\npure yin, entirely selfish.\nMan has but one nature,\nyet the heart, seduced by external things, cannot discern good from evil,\nand thus allows soul, vital essence, and intention to rule together—\na state of three ministers in one kingdom.\nHence it is said: *“The soul and vital essence form three natures.”*\n\nYet the soul of the East Wood truly gives birth to the spirit of South Fire,\nand the vital essence of West Metal truly generates the essence of North Water.\nThe Dao of the Elixir draws from spirit and qi,\nwhich in turn depend on soul and vital essence for their origin—\nthus soul and vital essence are the mother of spirit and qi,\nand spirit and qi are the sign of life and nature.\nTherefore, one must gather the Five Phases into one\nto fully achieve the Dao of the Elixir.\n\nThe Classic says:\n*“To sincerely intend, first perfect knowledge;\nwhen knowledge is perfected, one exhausts principle and nature reveals itself.”*\nThus, those who cultivate must first exhaust principle and perfect nature,\nestablishing great defenses—\nwhen nature is perfected, the heart naturally becomes firm and resolute,\nand supreme authority no longer drifts elsewhere.\n\nOn one hand, gather spirit and establish unshakable faith and vigilance,\ndividing soul, vital essence, and spirit into the four symbols within.\nCondense essence to gather the vital essence,\ncalm spirit to conceal the soul—\nsince spirit and qi depend on soul and vital essence for their origin,\nsoul and vital essence are thus gathered into spirit and qi.\nWhen intention is pure and still,\nthe four symbols cluster in the hidden and secret place—\nthis is the gathering of the Five Phases’ qi into one,\ncondensed and firmly established as embryonic essence.\n\nAs Master Zhāng said:\n*“Two elixirs combined, refining soul and vital essence into sacred spirit.”*\nWhen soul and vital essence are transformed,\nspirit naturally condenses,\nand my nature and emotions may be steadied.\nThis chapter, when compared with the forty-fifth above, reveals even greater wonder.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-One.**\nThis continues from the two preceding chapters,\nillustrating that exhausting principle and perfecting nature are essential to the Dao.\nWhen nature is steadied, one may align with the Way.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Two.**\nDetermine the will to seek lead and mercury,\nquiet the heart to find earth and gold.\nOnly then does one recognize the true unity—\nwho can fathom this profound depth?\n\nThe will is the matter my nature points toward—\nmy original resolve.\nEarth and gold refer to the stillness of pure yin, the *Kūn* soil concealing a point of *Qián* gold—\nwhen *Wu* rests in *Kūn*, forming *Kǎn*—\nthis is the initial stir of my true intention.\n\nThis follows from the previous chapter:\nwhen nature is steadied, the will is also steadied,\nand from this, the seven orifices return to their root.\nFocused intent and silent heart\nare the method of seeking yang qi and yin essence.\nWhen qi and essence awaken in harmony,\none must still maintain a silent, ashen heart—\nthis is the way to seek true intention and contain spirit.\nThus, when spirit condenses and qi becomes still,\nall return to the true, unerring unity within—\nnaturally merging to form the Elixir.\n\nMaster Bái said:\n*“When the will is not scattered, it condenses into spirit.\nA silent, ashen heart—within, the Elixir forms.”*\nSuch profound and abyssal learning—\nwho can truly recognize it?\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Two.**\nThis too continues from the previous chapter,\nrevealing the secret method of establishing life.\n\n○ **Chapter Sixty-Three.**\nCreation has no root or stem,\nyin and yang have their origin.\nThese true mysteries—\nfathers do not transmit them to sons.\n\nThe nameless beginning of Heaven and Earth is the root of creation;\nthe named mother of all things is the origin of yin and yang.\nIndeed!\nYet this most subtle and profound secret\ncan only be grasped by the heart—\nit cannot be easily spoken of.\n\nLet us first speak of creation, yin, and yang by name.\nCreation is the power Heaven alone wields to give birth to all things—\nthe natural, intentional Way of Heaven.\nYin and yang are what man and all things share with Heaven and Earth,\nrooted in the boundless, primordial *Yīqì*—\nthe unborn, unending, empty, and natural Way of non-action.\n\nFrom non-being arises being—creation;\nfrom being returns non-being—transformation.\nThis is spoken of in terms of birth and death.\nExtreme motion becomes stillness—yin;\nextreme stillness returns to motion—yang.\nThis is spoken of in terms of circulation and return.\nBirth and death pertain to form and substance,\ncirculation and return pertain to spirit and qi.\n\nSince man and all things’ form and substance arise from the condensation of spirit and qi,\nwhen man obtains yin essence and yang qi at the beginning,\nspirit is born—\nthis is the root of life.\nWhy does this chapter specifically speak of non-action as the root?\nBecause the world does not know that the **Law of Return** originates from parents,\nwhose natural essence and qi construct this body.\nOnce the umbilical cord is severed at birth,\nit is as though the root is cut and the stem falls.\nThough the spirit and qi received from Great Creation vary in quantity,\ndetermining one’s lifespan—\nthe virtuous may prolong it slightly,\nthe unvirtuous may shorten it—\nthe wise and foolish neither extend nor shorten it,\nbut follow or resist it, exhausting their allotted measure.\nEarly or late, all return to dissolution,\nonce more entering the furnace of Great Creation.\nThus, all things cannot escape fate.",

      "translated_text": "The lifespan’s birth year, month, and day are called *mingzào* (命造), while death’s year, month, and day are called *huàmìng* (化命). The *Exhortation to Virtue* speaks of prolonging life or shortening it, and of fate being exhausted leading to death—all asserting that what is formed must perish, and what is created must transform. Hence, it is said, *\"Zàohuà wú gēntí\"* (造化无根蒂).\n\nThough the yin essence and yang qi within a human body are also rooted in what Heaven endows, Heaven and Earth themselves rely on these yin and yang to form shapes and bodies. Heaven and Earth merely forget their forms and bodies, not burdening their spirit with material substance, thus using this yin and yang to give birth to all beings.\n\nHumans are the most refined of all things, knowing to revere the high and humble the low, imitating Heaven and following Earth, cultivating emptiness within and substance without to nourish the formless. Within them, the interplay of these two qi moves like the *Wújí Yuānbù* (无极元始) qi—endlessly swelling and waning, like fish in water, perpetually interconnected.\n\nYet those who do not return to the source are like a single ladle of water or a pinch of earth—played with briefly before the ladle shatters and the pinch scatters, with water returning to the sea and dust to the earth. But those who return to the source naturally align with their origin. A ladle of water preserved without clinging to its vessel remains ever in its source; a pinch of earth settled with sincerity cultivates virtue without ceasing. Over time, water gathers into lakes, earth accumulates into mountains—gradually filling lakes to become seas, embracing emptiness to merge with the *Tàiqīng* (太清), condensing to expand mountains into earth, bearing *Huáyuè* (华岳) with solidity. All this is the original essence of that ladle of water and pinch of earth.\n\nHumans accumulate essence and qi to form spirit, refine emptiness and nourish vastness to attain the Dao—this belongs to the intrinsic response to the source. Laozi’s *\"Gǔshén bùsǐ\"* (谷神不死) is rooted with Heaven and Earth at the *Xuānpìn* (玄牝) gate! Hence, it is said, *\"Yīnyáng yǒu běnyuán\"* (阴阳有本源)—though this is only a *zhōngpǐn* (中品) explanation.\n\nAs for the *shàngpǐn* (上品) elixir method, there exists a prior move, a direct path through the *Kǒngdào* (孔道), where the *Xuānguān* (玄关) may be instantly realized. One naturally perceives the mysteries of the *Dàodé* (道德) first chapter, knowing that human spirit shares the same *zàohuà* (造化) as Heaven and Earth—that is, the same *Yuānbù miàowúwéi* (元始妙无为) root.\n\nHuman qi, like all things, draws from yin and yang—that is, from the *Língbǎo miàoyǒuwéi* (灵宝妙有为) source. It is not like the laborious gathering of multitudes or heaps of earth; it requires only a sincere, unshaken thought, ensuring uninterrupted practice and swift return.\n\nThus, when discussing *zàohuà* through yin and yang, these belong to the post-heaven realm, manifesting in humans as the *sèsēn* (色身). If lifespan is neither prolonged nor shortened, and one adheres to the *shàn dào* (善道) of guarding death, this is the *Dàrén* (大人) practicing *\"Hòutiān ér fèng tiānshí\"* (后天而奉天时).\n\nHence, Yán Zǐ did not die young—not because his *sèsēn* was fated to perish, but because he could *\"Chángwú yǐ guān qí miào\"* (常无以观其妙). Zháojí did not live long—not because his *sèsēn* was fated to dissolve, but because he failed to *\"Chángwú yǐ guān qí miào\"*.\n\nIf *zàohuà* is understood through yin and yang, then *zàohuà* originates from the pre-heaven realm, manifesting in humans as the *fǎshēn* (法身). If wisdom and fate can restore their source and return to their origin, they naturally respond to all things in constancy, attaining their true nature. This is the *Dàrén* practicing *\"Xiāntiān ér tiān bù wéi\"* (先天而天不违).\n\nThus, beings cycle through the *Liùdào* (六道) wheel, while sages and kings cannot become Buddhas because they sacrifice their *fǎshēn* to yin and yang’s likes and dislikes, failing to *\"Chángyǒu yǐ guān qí jiào\"* (常有以观其徼). The *Wén Dì*’s seventeen incarnations, Laozi’s eighty-one transformations—these follow yin and yang’s movement and stillness, thus able to *\"Chángyǒu yǐ guān qí jiào\"*.\n\nHence, it is said:\n*\"Sèsēn píng zàohuà, yóu tiān bù yóu jǐ\"* (色身凭造化，由天不由己)—since one has no root to rely on.\n*\"Fǎshēn guàn yīnyáng, yóu wǒ bù yóu tiān\"* (法身贯阴阳，由我不由天)—since one has a source to penetrate.\n\nHeaven aids the sincere; nothing is unlucky.\n\nYet all things arise from existence, and existence from non-existence. Non-existence is the source of existence, while existence is the root of non-existence. Thus, existence and non-existence are movement and stillness; movement and stillness are yin and yang; yin and yang are *zàohuà*; *zàohuà* are existence and non-existence.\n\nI need not distinguish between existence and non-existence, yin and yang, creation and transformation. Only in my every movement and stillness do they mutually root, without preference or aversion, following the *Wángdào* (王道).\n\nIf one nourishes the *fǎshēn* with the *sèsēn*, then gathering is form, scattering is qi. If one stabilizes the *sèsēn* with the *fǎshēn*, stillness becomes the *Jīndān* (金丹), movement becomes thunderous lightning. What birth, what death, what preservation, what annihilation?\n\nAs Mèngzǐ said:\n*\"Tiān shòu bù èr, xiūshēn yǐ sì zhī, suǒyǐ lì mìng yě.\"*\n(天寿不贰，修身以俟之，所以立命也.)\nHow could there be a division between life and death?\n\nAnd again:\n*\"Wànwù jiē bèi yú wǒ yǐ! Fǎnshēn ér chéng, lè mò zài yān.\"*\n(万物皆备于我矣！反身而诚，乐莫在焉.)\nHow could there be a distinction between preservation and annihilation?\n\nThus, one may awaken to the effortless ease of those who are ever responsive and ever still!\n\nQi is like water, spirit like earth. Qi is what fate depends on; spirit is what nature entrusts. The wise delight in water to nourish qi, acting without contrivance to cultivate wisdom. The virtuous take joy in mountains to solidify spirit, dwelling in earth to cultivate sincerity without wavering, thus fostering tranquility.\n\nLet me exhaust this principle of simultaneously cultivating nature and fate: first, store the spirit in the heart; settle the spirit to still the mind; forget the mind to nourish the form; forget the form to nourish the qi; forget the qi to nourish the spirit; forget the spirit to nourish the void.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, one attains **Master Yan’s** *zuòwáng* (坐忘), exhausting one’s nature to fulfill fate, and further forgetting the void to merge with the Dao—then Heaven itself will grant one sainthood, and the Original Command and Original Nature will naturally return.\n\nWhen nature and fate are complete, there is no scheming, no certainty, no rigidity, no self—thus merging with the primordial *yīqì* (一氣) of Preheaven, this is the union with the True Dao, transcending past and present while ever enduring, participating in Heaven and Earth without division. In motion, it becomes the eternal constancy of the Great Ultimate; in flow, it is unobstructed. In stillness, it is the True One of the Non-Ultimate, secure and unchanging.\n\nIf one attains this constancy, then all impermanence falls under command; if unobstructed, then all obstruction will be penetrated.\n\nAs the earlier Confucian scholar Zhouzi (周子) said:\n*\"The Five Phases are but one yin-yang; yin-yang is but the Great Ultimate; the Great Ultimate originates from the Non-Ultimate.\"*\n\nThe Non-Ultimate is indeed void; the Great Ultimate is indeed existence—the root of transformation, the origin of yin-yang. How could one willingly be bound by yin-yang, confined within the Five Phases, vainly clinging to life while fearing death, debating existence over nonexistence?\n\nOne must instead grasp its fundamental root, comprehend its pivotal essence, and transcend the confines of transformation—only then may one be called a true Daoist.\n\nThese profound truths, where life and death intersect with colored phenomena, cannot be transmitted by father to son if one does not personally embody and awaken, exhausting principle and fulfilling nature, returning to the True Teacher beneath the divine canopy. With pure mindfulness unfettered, silent and scentless, one must verify it oneself—thus self-stabilizing, self-establishing, self-reverting, self-restoring, self-returning, self-fulfilling, self-liberating.

It teaches self-realization, awakening to life and death, and directly attaining the sacred realm of wondrous existence and wondrous nonexistence—thus returning to the origin and source, aligning with the highest-grade elixir cultivation and verification. Only then does one grasp Confucius’ saying: *\"To trace the beginning and the end, thus knowing life and death.\"* This is what he meant.\n\nThis true profundity may now be applied with skill.\n\nThis is the pivotal eye-opening insight of the entire passage, elucidating the overarching key of refining the Valley Spirit in Chapters Forty-Nine to Fifty-Four, and setting the stage for the subsequent chapters.\n\n※ From *Zhouyi · Xìcí Zhuàn* (《周易·系辞传》): *\"Original beginning and end.\"* The character *jí* (及) is taken from the Han scholar’s annotation: *\"He who traces the beginning and attains the end knows the saying of life and death.\"* The meaning is clear; thus, I follow it.",

      "translated_text": "At this juncture, the three grades within the body have completed the **Pure and Chaste Essence** (太素贞白), and upon obtaining this **true lead of great red** (大赤之真铅), their fusion and congealing—intermingling red and white—yield the crimson.\n\nThe **marrow of Heaven and Earth** (天地髓) refers to this very **true lead**. When it is said that the **spirit, qi, and essence** are all fully suffused, utterly undefiled, and ready as **old cinnabar**, it is only that the **nurturing work** is yet insufficient. Once a single point of **true lead** arises and turns crimson, it becomes the **golden elixir of Great Return**.\n\nYet at this time, the **yang spirit** within the body merely abides in stillness and seclusion. One lets the **Heavenly qi** flow freely, until its completeness is fully realized and the **qi stands motionless in stillness**.\n\nAs the **White Boy** said:\n*\"Concentrate the heart, solidify the spirit,\nAttain emptiness, guard stillness—\nThen the empty chamber births the white.\"*\n\nTruly natural!\n\nThen one feels the body steadfast as a towering mountain, vast and high.\nSuddenly, a point of **true lead** emerges, deep and piercing—\nA radiant red heaven, for this is the **marrow of Heaven and Earth**, the very **original nature returning in summer**.\n\nIt stirs the earth and shakes the heavens, surging through the **mixed and chaotic**—\nMy spirit is thus enveloped in drowsiness,\nUnknowing, unaware, as if in deep slumber.\n\nAfter a moment, one awakens to **clear spirit and refreshed qi**,\nThe body as if aflame, the heart as ice released.\n\nIf speaking of further cultivation,\nOne must yet engage in **fusion and refinement**;\nIf speaking of its effects,\nThen the **light of nature shines universally**, penetrating the profound and subtle.\nOne hears the **Nine Heavens**, sees **ten thousand miles**,\nThe entire body pure **yang**—**golden sinews, jade bones**—\nThis is the **yang spirit manifesting in form**, able to move freely in nature.\n\nAs for the **Dao of longevity**, it is here complete!\n\nYet fearing that **yang has its yin counterpart**,\nAnd that the **six directions of emptiness** still linger,\nUnable to avoid the **coming and going of concealment and revelation**—\nHow could one then **consort with the Creator** and hold dominion over its beginning and end?\n\nThus, it is impossible not to **bind together** the **primordial chaos** of the past and the **manifested forms** of now,\nAnd **refine them into the golden elixir of Great Return**.\n\n○ **Chapter Seventy**\nThis speaks of the **yang spirit already formed**,\nThe moment when the **original spirit first unites**.\n\n※Within this chapter, the word **\"seize\"** (夺) aligns with the *Yin Symbol Classic*’s **\"steal the mechanism\"** (盗机).\nThe *Spring and Autumn Annals* states:\n*\"The Military Records say: ‘The ancients had the mind to seize from others.’\"*\nThey speak of war’s value in **spiritual swiftness**—\nSeizing the **vital points** before the enemy’s intent even stirs.\n\nHere, the study of cultivation lies in **spiritual might**—\nSeizing the **pivotal essence of yin and yang** before one’s own mind moves.\n\nThe **marrow of Heaven and Earth** is the **pivotal essence of yin and yang**.\n\nAt the **mysterious juncture of fire and time**, who from ancient or modern times would dare transmit it?\nNone have yet known how to **extract the elixir**,\nNor even inquire about the **circulation of the Microcosmic Orbit**.\n\n*\"Play\"* (玄) is *\"Heaven\"* (天).\nWhen the **original nature is restored** and the **yang spirit formed**,\nThere remains no **fire and time** to be applied within the body—\nThe **fire and time** lie only in the **path to Heaven**.\nFrom antiquity to now, who would clearly transmit it?\nBecause the world lacks those who can **restore life and nature**,\nNor those with the wisdom to seek—\nThus the **golden elixir of Great Return** remains unplucked,\nAnd the **fire and time of this Microcosmic Orbit** are not yet to be asked.\n\n○ **Chapter Seventy-One**\nThis follows the meaning of **\"seize\"** from the previous chapter,\nRevealing the first glimpses of **fire and time**.\n\n*Clouds disperse over the sea-pink moon,\nSpring deepens with willow winds.*\nWho knows this intent?\nGazing upward, questioning the void.\n\n**Note:** At this stage, one has obtained the **original official of the Great Polarity** as one’s body.\nThe **fire and time** is merely **forgetting the void to merge with the Dao**—\nA single move where **spirit and qi are entrusted to mutual oblivion**.\n\nThus, the opening line speaks of **clouds dispersing** while the **moon reaches the sea-pink**—\nAs if the **spirit is now utterly pure and luminous**, without sound or stench.\nThe next line speaks of **spring deepening** as the **wind blows through the willows**—\nAs if the **qi is now perfectly harmonious and unrestrained**, leaving no trace.\n\nScholars must apply this to **body and mind**,\nCompleting its structure—\nThe first line describes the **unmanifest emotions** as the **central equilibrium**,\nThe second describes **manifested emotions in perfect measure** as **harmony**.\n\nIn terms of its function,\nThe first line models the **Three Penetrations of Virtue** as my **inherent knowing**—\nThat which all share.\nThe second models the **Five Penetrations of the Dao** as my **inherent ability**—\nThat which all follow.\n\nYet regarding the **mysteries of the Microcosmic Orbit’s fire and time**,\nThe principle of **gathering and refining** has not yet been entered.\n\nAnd why does the text then say, *\"eyes question the void\"*?\nThis must be **self-body and self-enlightenment**—\nUnifying one to comprehend all,\nOnly able to attain the **original heart’s sincerity**.\n\nThus, in **action**, one aligns with the **common nature of humanity**,\nIn **stillness**, one merges with the **original mandate of Heaven**,\nEver nurturing the **undivided whole**—\nThen everywhere one touches, it is **penetratingly clear**,\nAnd one knows the **spirit and qi** have long since **naturally fused within heart and eyes**,\nAnd **vanished into the void**.\n\nWhy?\nThe **movement and stillness of qi** follow the **spirit**,\nYet the **spirit is always prior to qi**.\nThe **ascension and concealment of the spirit** depend on the **heart**,\nYet the **heart is even prior to the spirit**.\nThe **first impulse of the heart** lies in the **eyes**—\nThus the **eyes are truly the heart’s first impulse**,\nThe **primary concern of spirit and qi**.\n\nAs the *Yin Symbol Classic* says:\n*\"The heart is born from things, dies from things—\nIts mechanism lies in the eyes.\"*\nThus it is known that the **eyes are the first impulse of the heart**,\nThe **true priority of spirit and qi**.\n\nIf the **eyes flee**, then the **heart withdraws** and **qi is obstructed**, the **spirit perishes**.\nIf the **eyes are clear and inwardly gazing**, then the **heart is pure**, the **spirit condenses**, and the **qi expands**.\nIf the **eyes merge with the void**, then the **heart wanders at the origin of things** without attachment,\nAnd the **spirit and qi** remain **serene and ever still**.\n\nWhen nurturing reaches **stillness without stillness**,\nOne knows the **ten directions and three realms** are not outside the **One Heart**,\nPast and future are not separate from the **One Self**—\nOriginally unborn, now unextinguished,\nOriginally unreduced, now unincreased.\n\nThis **suchness**—who knows it?",

root cause lies in clinging to mundane affections,\nFailing to awaken a single true thought to cultivate and establish one’s foundation.\n\nThus, I further reveal this chapter:\nWhen the Golden Elixir ripens,\nIt merges with the **Great Void** as one body.\nAll worldly rivers, seas, mountains, and cliffs are cast aside—\nThey are but household treasures.\nSpeaking of mountains and rivers,\nI encompass all that is finer than them.\nTeach people to cast aside all worldly ties,\nHold fast to a single thought,\nAnd naturally, the path of **True Cultivation** will open,\nThe Dao will have no

Zhenren, Master of Thoughtful Retreat**.\nFrom ancient times, countless **High Immortals** attained the Dao through cultivation—\nLike Lü and Ge, whom all know and revere.\nYet their transmitted oral instructions contain no extraneous words—\nOnly **mercury and lead**,\nTeaching people not to seek the Dao through external beliefs or external means.\n\n---\n**Chapter Seventy-Ninth**\nThis speaks of the **Original Elixir Method**,\nThe **easy and simple Dao** of ancient sages,\nNot like other obscure arts whose methods are complex and difficult.\n\n---\n**Mercury and lead return to one crucible,\nSun and moon must share the same furnace.**\nWhen refining fire, beware of anger and desire,\nTeach you to **congeal the Jade Acid Butter**.\n\nThis reveals the **ultimate secret of Elixir Cultivation**:\nMercury and lead must merge as one,\nTheir natures must harmonize.\nIn the stages of **cooking, bathing, and refining fire**,\nThe essence lies in avoiding wrath and lust,\nAdjusting the heat with precision—\nDay and night, maintain utmost secrecy,\nThen **self and object merge**, the six senses grow still,\nThe mind becomes clear—\nNaturally, the Elixir congeals.\nThe term **\"Jade Acid Butter\"** speaks of\nNurturing the **Spirit** and **qi** so thoroughly\nThat within **warmth, refinement, and harmony**,\nIt achieves the subtlest fusion.\nFrom beginning to end, the **Three Great Intersections** are all thus nurtured,\nRequiring no effort—\nIts completion is swift.\n\n---\n**Chapter Eightieth**\nThis elucidates the **ultimate secret of Elixir Cultivation**.\n\n---\n**Gathering herbs and forming connections,\nRefining fire and bathing in elixir.**\nWhen the time of **shedding the mortal coil** arrives,\nThe **nine times nine of pure Yang** will be complete.\n\nThis chapter summarizes the entire text,\nClarifying the **ordered stages of Elixir Cultivation**,\nTeaching people to progress step by step—\nWhen the **pure Yang** is complete,\nNaturally, the **transformation of Spirit and form** occurs,\nAnd one ascends to become an Immortal.\nReaders must not squander this **sincere guidance** to return to the Origin!\n\n---\n**Chapter Eighty-First**\nThis marks the sequence of the Elixir instructions,\nConcluding the meaning of all eighty chapters.\n\n**Note:** This entire section on techniques begins with **deliberate action**\nAnd ends with **effortless spontaneity**.\nThe **deliberate action** is to **rectify the body, stabilize the vital breath,**\nAnd **nurture the boundless and sincere**.\nThe **effortless spontaneity** is to **strengthen oneself unceasingly,**\nAnd **nurture the formless**.\n\nMy teacher once said to people:\n*\"If one straightens their body, empties their mind,\nAnd makes their thought **True One**,\nThen practicing the Elixir instructions will naturally be easy.\nEven without cultivation, it suffices to **ward off illness and prolong life**,\nAnd to remain strong in old age.\"*\n\nThis is indeed the **fundamental and supreme method** for beginners.\n\nFor if one straightens their body,\nTheir posture will have no crookedness or leaning,\nAnd their **five senses, four limbs, and hundred bones**\nWill all be orderly—\nExternal things will find no way to disturb them.\nIf one empties their mind,\nThe **flow of qi** will be unobstructed,\nAnd their **entire body’s meridians, tendons, and bones**\nWill have no stagnation—\nThus, the **qi returns to the Void**.\nIf one makes their thought **True One**,\nThey will act with sincerity,\nWith no hesitation in their heart—\nThen, the **yin essence** within will naturally congeal with the **true qi**,\nForming the **Spirit**, which then returns to its origin.\n\nThus, **body, mind, and intention** are always united,\nAnd the **Valley Spirit** is nourished in **unconscious awareness**—\nStrength and vitality naturally follow.\n\nTherefore, the **Method of Returning to the Origin**\nMust first uphold a **true thought**.\nIf the **true thought** is sincere,\nThen the body will naturally straighten,\nAnd the mind will naturally empty.\nOnce the mind is empty,\nThe **medicine arises**, and the **fire will be true**—\nThere will be no fear of **metal and wood obstruction**,\nNor of **water and fire failing to aid each other**.\nOnly when **Spirit and qi** merge in subtlety\nDoes the **Elixir congeal**.\nWithin this lies the **root**—\nThen nurture the **formless**,\nGradually leading to **no form, no body**,\nAnd the **Great Return of Golden Fluid** will be achieved!\n\n**Gold** is the **Heavenly One’s** self-generated metal,\n**Fluid** is the **Heavenly One’s** pre-natal water essence.\nThe **Great Return** is when these **Five Agents’** refined essences merge and congeal,\nRestoring the **Taiji** to the **Wuji** of **Prenatal Heaven**.\nOnce the **entire fluid congeals**,\nAdd the **functions of bathing and nurturing**,\nDay by day, month by month,\nFrom subtle to manifest,\nTo achieve **enduring and vast virtue**—\nHow could the body not become an **indestructible Golden Body**?\n\nThe **Source** is as such,\nAnd **Returning to the Source** is as such.\nFrom these words, one may suddenly awaken to the **Dao of Congealing Essence into Spirit**.",
