Emperor*\n*Postface*\n*Preface to the Supreme Purity Great Cavern Perfection Scripture*\n\nMaster Zhu Ziying of the Twenty-Third Generation of Maoshan Shangqing Lineage, the Master Who Contemplates the Wondrous, states:\n\nThe Dao arises from Non-Being, abiding in the hidden numinous yet unfathomable;\nThe spirit congeals in Emptiness, wondrously transforming the myriad changes without fixed form.\nIn the profound obscurity, essence abides, and in supreme tranquility, radiance emerges;\nIn the boundless Great Mystery, one attains Emptiness and preserves Stillness—\nThis is called the *Great Cavern*.\n\nWhen essence is gathered and spirit is concentrated, one rides the primordial qi in cyclic rotation;\nWhen spirit is refined and the Dao is realized, auspicious winds are set in motion and dance.\nFrom Non-Being, Being suddenly arises, and through breath, the myriad spirits’ forms disperse;\nWhen movement reaches its extreme, stillness returns, and in the indistinct, the wondrous unity of the Imperial One is encircled—\nThis is called the *Cyclic Wind Unified*.\n\nIt is the root of universal propagation for Heaven and Earth, the origin of creation for emperors and sages.\nHumans are born, receiving qi from the Supreme Ultimate, their movement and stillness patterned after Heaven and Earth;\nThey originate in the One Primordial, their opening and closing embodying Yin and Yang.\nThus, the Thirty-Nine August Lords of Shangqing reflect their true forms downward, entering the thirty-nine portals within the adept’s body.\nEach portal, according to its corresponding passage, bears one chapter of the scripture.\nIts words are profound and abstruse, serving to command the hundred spirits, summon the true, and repel the false—\nWhat is called \"auspicious clouds open the Gate of Life, and propitious mists seal the Portal of Death\" refers to this.\n\nTherefore, the Central Yellow Elder of the Primordial Essence Dao Lord synthesized the esoteric intentions of the host of sages and compiled the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, hence its name: *The Thirty-Nine Chapters Scripture*.\nAdditionally, there are the *Cyclic Wind Imperial One*, the *Lofty Primordial Mighty One*, and the *Five Elders Feminine One*—these three scriptures serve to supplement the venerable *Thirty-Nine Chapters*.\n\nThe Dao possesses three marvels:\nThe first marvel is the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern in Thirty-Nine Chapters*;\nThe second marvel is the *Precious Scripture of the Five Elders Feminine One*;\nThe third marvel is the *Wondrous Scripture of the Vast and Subtle Primordial Numinosity*.\n\nThus, the *Thirty-Nine Chapters* is the esoteric formula of the Nine Heavens, the foremost scripture of the Supreme Primordial Lord, inscribed in golden characters.\nIt is also called the *Dragon Script of the Three Heavens* and the *True Dao Scripture of the Nine Heavens*.\nThis scripture was composed by the Primordial Heavenly King, who circulated qi across the ten directions of the Mysterious Subtle.\nThe Queen Mother of the West received the Dao from the Primordial Heavenly King and, together, they inscribed it in the Northern Primordial Heaven, in the Land of Luyena, upon the Spirit Mirror Mountain of the Bird-Men, within the Grotto of Shelai.\nIn a chamber of Emptiness, they gathered the qi of the Ninefold Mysterious Unity, coalescing it into a book. The characters measured a *zhang* in height, and it remains preserved to this day.\nThe Primordial Heavenly King further transmitted it to the Central Yellow Elder of the Eight Perfected of Shangqing, instructing him to teach it to those below who would become true persons and ascend to the Three Luminaries.\n\nThis scripture was concealed and guarded by the Central Yellow Elder, unknown to the world. Thus, in the mortal realm, upon the Five Sacred Peaks and within the celestial precincts of Heaven, it has never been present.\nThe Perfected of the Shangqing Heaven treasure and secrete it; only in the Great Mystery are there golden pavilions and jade tablets, purple slips and cinnabar records.\nIn the Three Origins, there are the *Secret Registers of the Conjoined Dawn*; in the Cinnabar Terrace, the yellow characters of the scripture.\nOnly those destined to become true persons may receive it.\n\nThis scripture is the banner of the Dao of the Supreme August, the wondrous text of the Purple Dawn.\nIt governs the ranks of the Nine Heavens, summons the numinous powers of the Five Emperors,\nUnifies the *Cyclic Wind* in its primordial harmony, coagulates the ninefold transmutations in mysterious essence,\nConjoins the feminine and masculine, unites the myriad spirits,\nArrayed in profound solemnity, resonating with the jade tones of the Great Perfected.\nIt dispels the false in the Luminous Beam, communicates the mutable in the Mysterious Gate,\nPenetrates virtue to attain the wondrous, washes radiance to illumine the clouds.\nThe Great Han becomes the qi of the Numinous Pass; the Boundless becomes the years of the Vast Kalpa.\nMajestic are the spirit halls, the abyss of the myriad Perfected;\nResplendent the golden chambers, flourishing in the Shangqing Heaven.\n\nIts purport is subtle and profound, difficult to exhaust in detail.\nIf the adept can maintain long-term purification, severing worldly attachments,\nRecite the jade chapters in the secluded chamber, and invoke the jade tones to stir the numinous,\nThen the true person’s register will be established in the Eastern Florescence,\nThe Seven Mysteries will be further refined in the Purple Chamber,\nThe Demon Kings will be subdued by numinous might,\nThe Five Emperors will be harnessed to guard the body.\nAfter ten thousand recitations, the fleshly body will ascend;\nAfter seven invocations, the Controller of Destiny will arrive.\nThese are the marvelous chapters of the *Great Cavern*, which gather the myriad Dao to return to life.\nWithout extraordinary feathers or anomalous forms, without golden bones or jade names,\nNone may rashly peruse the numinous text—its prohibitions strictly follow the *Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*.\n\nThe adept must undergo three years of arduous purification before being permitted to read it.\nUpon completing ten thousand recitations of these chapters, the Central Yellow Elder Dao Lord will memorialize above,\nAnd the Supreme Lord will command the cinnabar-gale chariot with its green canopy,\nWhile the Nine Numinous Envoys and the Controller of Destiny of the Great Unity come to welcome the adept.\nThus, the Five Elders will flank the carriage, the Eight Winds will fan their feathers,\nDivine thunder will lead the way, jade splendor will support the wheels.\nRiding clouds and driving dragons, the adept will ascend to Heaven that very day,\nProceeding to the palace of the Three Primordial Lords of the Supreme Simplicity to receive the scripture.\nThis is called ascending to the Shangqing Heaven, receiving the scripture in the Supreme Ultimate,\nAnd being appointed as the Left Minister of the Lofty Immortals.\n\nIf the adept merely possesses this scripture but does not recite it,\nThe Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity will strike the adept’s name from the Register of Death.\nAt the outset of scripture transmission, the true register is established;\nAt the beginning of the purification rite, the Supreme Ultimate is invoked to inscribe the name in the Eastern Florescence.\nA memorial is presented to the Supreme Lord, and the name is recorded in the Tortoise Terrace.\nThe myriad spirits and thousand numina will then address the adept as the *Grand Master of the Nine Mysteries*,\nRanking equivalent to the *Immortal Earl of the Supreme Purity*.\n\nThe protocols for receiving the scripture strictly adhere to the *Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*; the adept should comply accordingly.\n\n**Postface**\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Great indeed is the Primal Qi of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it.\"\nIt further states: \"The Dao of Qian transforms and changes, each attaining its proper nature and destiny. Preserving and uniting the Great Harmony, only then is there benefit and correctness.\"\nThe earlier scholars explained: \"What is called *yuan*? It is that which cannot be spoken—perhaps the state before Yin and Yang took form.\"\nWhat Heaven bestows is *ming* (destiny); what beings receive is *xing* (nature).\nNature and destiny are wondrous; only by preserving and uniting the Great Harmony can there be benefit and correctness.\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* fundamentally concerns the return to the origin and the restoration of destiny.\nThose who discuss it in the world all say: \"The Dao is wondrous in Emptiness and Non-Being; the spirit is hidden in the sudden arising of Being.\"\n\nBefore heaven and earth existed, this Dao already was. The disciples of the Mo and Si schools spoke of Confucius, saying: \"His nature and the Dao of Heaven—these could not be heard.\" Yet this Dao is none other than the wondrous subtlety of \"only the refined, only the unified,\" transmitted heart-to-heart by the Three Sages—Yao, Shun, and Yu—each in unbroken accord, never for an instant apart. By the Spring and Autumn period, as the age declined and customs decayed, it was regarded as something loftily impracticable, leaving people at a loss, and so the Master seldom spoke of it. Yet when Yanzi sat in forgetfulness and Zengzi responded with singular devotion, did they hear anything different? The purport of this scripture is to preserve the heart and nurture nature in serving Heaven, to gather essence and unite spirit in harmonizing with the Dao—entirely consistent with the Master’s teaching that \"when you grasp it, it remains; when you release it, it vanishes.\"\n\nSince the Yellow and Lao Lords of the Central Realm withdrew into seclusion, the world has known nothing of this. Thus, among the earthly realms of humanity and the five sacred mountains, this scripture has vanished forever. Later generations, never hearing of the Great Dao, have abandoned themselves to the sea of desires, drowning their aspirations in the dusty waves. How pitiable are those who would preserve the Great Harmony and rectify nature and destiny!\n\nAt the Shangqing Ancestral Altar of Mount Mao, transmission has spanned over a thousand years, yet only thirty-eight individuals have received it. For it reveals the hidden truths of heaven and earth before form arose and dissects the mysteries of the union of father and mother’s essences—thus it must remain concealed, never lightly or carelessly passed on.\n\nIn the second lunar month of the Xianchun reign, the Perfected Master of Jade Ocean’s Profound Mystery visited Jiuhua Mountain. While visiting a Daoist chamber, he spoke of this matter, and few were those who heard. Fearing its imminent extinction, he wished to broaden its transmission. I, Gongduan, bound by the green threads of three lifetimes’ karmic practice, received the Master’s instruction and, overwhelmed with gratitude, commissioned this carving in wood to fulfill his intent, sharing it with scholars across the world. May those who treasure this text, pledging their hearts before Heaven in transmission, vow to practice it and thus flourish this Dao.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the ren-shen year of the Xianchun reign, the Dharma-heir Cheng Gongduan reverently inscribed this with burning incense.\n\nWhat is bestowed upon beings as nature and destiny is at once vast and minute, light and weighty, boundless in its presence and absence—yet never apart from the Dao, all may be seen and sought. Thus, one who attains the self becomes enlightened, then knows that heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things are but a single entity. That which is empty, numinous, and wondrous—do I not possess it? Since I possess it, it may be seen and sought. Why should it not share the same endowment as the vast and minute, the light and weighty, without ever being obscured?\n\nWhat is called a *scripture* of the Dao arises from the sound of celestial truth, the text of the Three Qi. None but the Perfected Immortals of the Supreme Emperor expound it before transmitting it to the world below. Its sound is heard in the absence of sound; its text takes form in the absence of form. It divides at the beginning of the primordial chaos, yet its unfolding and nurturing manifestations may be heard and perceived—hence it is called a *scripture*.\n\nTo unlock the treasury within oneself, to expound the scripture within oneself, to reveal its most profound truths and dispel the obstructions of the benighted—is it not that every being possesses this scripture? The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* comprises thirty-nine chapters, all concerning the principles of refinement. Those who practice it to completion—such as Wei, Yang, Guo, and Xu—attest to this.\n\nSome ascend to the lofty void, some penetrate to luminous clarity; some are meticulous in ritual observance, some nourish themselves through ingestion—each method has its similarities and differences, and none may be casually pursued. For the path of refinement must be rooted in nurturing qi and preserving spirit. Only after dispelling external distractions and dissolving thoughts does qi congeal and spirit transform. When all things and concerns are severed, and not even a hair’s breadth of obstruction remains, one returns to the primordial chaos. Thus, hunger and thirst vanish, birth and extinction cease. One roams with the clouds drifting through the sky, coming and going without limit.\n\nWhen such scriptures circulate in the world, those of reverent virtue must consider broadening their transmission. At its core, the intention to preserve goodness is one and the same.\n\nThe Daoist Xiong Changyi of Min, who has sought the Dao for years, sponsored the carving of this scripture and requested a preface. Alas! Many know the scripture as the Dao and follow it, yet few truly practice its Way. The teachings established by the Most High extend their grace to all creatures, enduring through countless generations without cease—such is their origin. How many can truly believe in themselves and diligently cultivate it? Those who believe and cultivate—what hinders them from attaining the scripture? How much more does it transcend the bounds of existence and non-existence, its numinous wonders far exceeding what the scripture alone conveys!\n\nHolders of this scripture should take heed of these words.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Dharma-heir, Illuminator of the Dao’s Radiance, Perfected Zhang Yu Chu, Forty-Third Celestial Master and Overseer of Daoist Affairs, respectfully inscribed this.\n\n**Completion of the Sixth Scroll of the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern***\n**Beginning of the First Scroll of the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern***\n\nMaoshan Supreme Clarity Thirty-Eighth Patriarch Master Jiang Zongying collated and annotated.\n\n**Jade Formula for Reciting the Scripture**\n\nThe formula states: First, outside the chamber, hold a tablet before the heart, face forward with eyes closed, and knock the teeth three times. Visualize the chamber filled with purple cloud-qi, dense and swirling, crowning and enveloping the body. Envision jade lads and jade maidens attending the scripture on left and right, while the Three Lights and precious mushrooms illumine the chamber with radiance. Upon completing the visualization, knock the teeth three times and recite the Entering-the-Chamber Incantation:\n\n*\"The heavens are bright, the qi is clear,\nThe Three Lights illumine the cavern’s splendor.\nGolden chambers and jade halls,\nFive mushrooms bloom as treasures.\nMystic clouds and purple canopies\nCome to adorn my form.\nImmortal lads and jade maidens\nBestow their numinous power upon me.\nThe Nine Qi ascend in harmony,\nThe Three Lights unite as one.\nMounting the purple canopy,\nI ascend to the imperial court.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, step forward with the right foot to enter the chamber. Pinch the incense three times, knock the teeth three times, and pray:\n\n*\"Jade radiance scatters its light,\nThe Nine Qi bear fragrant mist.\nClouds of incense weave a dense net,\nPiercing straight to the Nine Heavens.\nThe incense-attending golden lad\nAnd the message-bearing jade maiden\nConvey my words to the imperial presence,\nGranting me long life,\nThat I may become a transcendent for all generations,\nEvery wish fulfilled as spoken.\"*\n\n**Diagram of Visualization for Entering the Chamber and Reciting the Scripture**\n\nAfter completing the visualization, next recite the Mystic Essence Incantation for Opening the Scripture:\n\n*\"Subtle is the gate of the Mystic Origin,\nResplendent and bright, it pervades empty sameness.\nThe Supreme Dao arises from stillness and silence—\nThen shall you behold the Three Pure Palaces.\nThe Great Dao is perfected here,\nRiding the clouds and spurring the dragon.\nTranscendents attend the scripture on left and right,\nJade maidens and jade lads.\nMy body is saved by the elixir of deathlessness,\nLoosening the nets to follow the numinous wind.\nSeven ancestors return to womb-life,\nBecoming the lineage of divine transcendents for all generations.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, face north and knock the teeth thirty-six times. Close the eyes in inner vision, bow the head, and pray:\n\n*\"I, the humble mortal so-and-so, born a man of this dusty world, now offer these humble words to the Jade Clarity’s Primordial Sovereign of the Numinous Origin. Having entered the retreat chamber to recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, I humbly pray that demonic trials be dispelled, ghostly afflictions and illnesses averted, and that my seven ancestors’ sins be absolved and blessings be born.\"*\n\nNext, pray:\n\n*\"Great Demon Kings of the Six Heavens,\nBound by the desolate void’s restraints,\nWhite-clawed apes and crimson-scaled poisonous dragons,\nGuard the four directions,\nSafeguarding the ninefold layers.\nWhite eagles cry aloft,\nUnsheathing their talons and shaking their manes.\nAll hidden spirits vanish,\nEvil is destroyed and demons shattered.\nWhen the Heavenly Soldiers rage,\nThe Five Peaks tremble.\nWind and fire launch their campaign,\nThe Nine Heavens open their court.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, face north and bow four times, knock the teeth three times, then kneel with eyes closed, knock the teeth twenty-four times, and declare:\n\n*\"I, the humble mortal so-and-so, born a man of this dusty world, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Most High and Sagely Vast Realized One, the Supreme Dao Lord. Having entered the oratory to burn incense and recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, I refine my spirit and guard my essence, beseeching the flowering of my destiny’s splendor. May I rise bodily upon the void to bow before the imperial court, and may my seven ancestors’ sins be absolved, ascending to the Hall of Blessings.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, bow four times again, then kneel and declare:\n\n*\"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Central Yellow Elder of Primordial Simplicity, Sovereign of the Dao. Having entered the chamber to burn incense and recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, I pray that within my oratory, mushroom blossoms may spontaneously arise, jade radiance and precious luminosity illumine the chamber, and the Three Lights shine with clarity. May I ascend to the Supreme Clarity and unite with the imperial numen, that my seven ancestors’ sins be absolved and I attain long life.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, bow four times again, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:\n\n*\"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Supreme Clarity’s Marshal of the Hosts of Transcendents, the Long-Life Dharma Master, the Three Heavenly Lords, and Perfected One Wang Baicheng.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, bow four times again, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:\n\n*\"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Ancestral Master who bestowed the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, the Perfected Sagely Mother, Primordial Sovereign of the Purple Tenuity, Lady Wang.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, bow four times again, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:\n\n*\"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Master who bestowed the *Great Cyclic Harmony of the Returning Wind*, the Perfected Sagely Mother, Primordial Sovereign of the Central Candidate, Lady Wang. Having entered the chamber to burn incense and recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern*, I humbly pray for the harmonization of my three hun-souls and the refinement of my seven po-souls, the sinking of corpse-worms, the radiance of my viscera and bowels, the prevention of all illness, the elimination of calamities, the return of my complexion to that of an infant, and my ascent in broad daylight. May my seven ancestors’ sins be absolved and they ascend to the Hall of Blessings.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, face east and bow four times, burn incense, knock the teeth thirty-six times, and visualize the Six Gates of the Eastern Florescence, governing the Eastern Mound Mountain, encircling three thousand *li*. Within the gates stand the Three Offices, arrayed in perfect order.\n\nThe First Palace is the Azure Palace of the Square Reservoir, governed by the Azure Lad, the High Minister.\nThe Second Palace is the Azure Palace of Jade Preservation, governed by the High Minister, Great Marshal of the Hosts, and Perfected Master Gao Chen.\nThe Third Palace is the Azure Palace of Jade Florescence, governed by the Little Lad of Azure Florescence of the Eastern Sea.\n\nNext, visualize and recite the names of the Six Gates and their gatekeepers:\n\nThe Eastern Azure Florescence Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Qiu Boyuan.\nThe Southern Spirit Florescence Jade Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Wang Zusi.\nThe Western Jade Cavern Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Yu Shangjie.\nThe Northern Jade Yin Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Shi Shaohua.\nThe Southeastern Heavenly Pass Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Wen Wuche.\nThe Northeastern Cold Water Gate, guarded by Gatekeeper Tong Lindu.\n\nNext, knock the teeth three times and pray facing upward:\n\n*\"Supreme Clarity’s Mystic Dawn,\nThree Palaces and Six Gates,\nRecord my jade name,\nSend down my spirit-transcendents.\nDragon skirts and feathered regalia\nAdorn my body.\nAs I recite the cavern’s chapters,\nMay they resound through the Nine Heavens.\nAscending to the Jade Clarity,\nI submit my writ to the Eastern Florescence.\nMy name is carved on golden tablets,\nThat I may long be an imperial guest.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, swallow the qi nine times, face east, burn incense, bow four times, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:\n\n*\"I, so-and-so, with utmost sincerity reverently address the Supreme Clarity’s Ninefold Subtlety, the Great Perfected Jade Preserver King, the Golden Watchtower’s High Minister and Great Controller of Destinies, Perfected Master Gao Chen, and the Great Lord of the Eastern Sea’s Jade Clarity and Azure Florescence, the Little Lad.\"*\n\nHaving recited this, burn incense again, bow four times, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I, so-and-so, reverently address the Supreme Clarity’s Great Non-Being, the Eastern Aurora’s Fusang Vermilion Grove Great Emperor, and the Supreme Dao Lord.\n\nHaving recited this, burn incense again, bow four times, knock the teeth three times, then kneel and declare:\n\nWith utmost sincerity, I, so-and-so, reverently address the Ancestral Master, the Southern Culmen’s Purple Perfected Supreme Clarity Dao Lord; the Grand Tenuity’s Jade Clarity Sagely Empress; the Golden Watchtower’s High Preserver, Eastern Florescence Dao Lord; and the Golden Watchtower’s Grand Master, Supreme Clarity Immortal Marquis. Now entering the chamber, I recite the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Perfected Scripture*. May the dawn’s radiance shine forth, illuminating my body; may my viscera and organs flourish; may calamities and misfortunes dissipate; may my seven ancestors return to the womb and together ascend the cloud chariot.\n\nHaving recited this, burn incense again, bow in reverence before the scripture, and gently knock the teeth fourteen times, then pray:\n\nSupreme Unity Emperor Lord,\nImperial Unity Mysterious Scripture,\nFive Numinous Ones scatter their effulgence,\nDense and penetrating through the Three Clarities.\nJade lads and jade maidens,\nBurn incense and attend the numinous.\nMay my highest aspirations be declared,\nThat I may merge my form with theirs,\nBecoming an immortal,\nAnd long enjoy felicity and purity.\n\nHaving recited this, knock the teeth fourteen times again, then softly recite the *Casket-Opening Incantation*:\n\nJade Emperor’s supreme dharma,\nAscends to the Three Clarities.\nOn this auspicious day of purification,\nI dare open the divine scripture.\nTen thousand trials concealed,\nAll shall succeed as I direct.\nJade lads stand guard,\nJade maidens scatter fragrance.\nVoices numbering five hundred million,\nResound through the ten thousand numina.\nSupreme report to the Three Origins,\nGrant me long life eternal.\n\nHaving recited this, knock the teeth twenty times, then bow in reverence again. Next, offer three pinches of upper-grade incense, ascend the seat, sit upright, face north, knock the teeth thirty-two times, swallow saliva thirty-two times, and with eyes closed, visualize the Imperial Unity Honored Lord.\n\nNext, envision the disciple’s head as true azure, like jasper; the two shoulders as cinnabar; the two feet as snow. Clad in a nine-colored feathered robe, draped with a dragon-patterned mantle, crowned with a Jade Clarity coronet, holding a nine-colored staff. A green dragon attends to the left, a white tiger guards the right; a canopy of blossoms shades the head, and below sits a lion. Immortal lads attend with incense, jade maidens scatter flowers. Purple clouds billow thickly, filling the chamber; five-colored mystic yellows array before and behind, clearly distinct, all brightly illumined.\n\nHaving completed this, knock the teeth thirty-six times, then softly recite the *Three Heavens Demon-Quelling Incantation*:\n\nNorthern Emperor, Great Demon King,\nBefore the Emperor Lord you serve.\nGhosts of the Yellow Springs’ bends,\nFour Luminaries, Fengdu’s peaks.\nA thousand demons blend their forms,\nNine heads share one body.\nDivine tigers spew their venom,\nSevered by thunder’s might.\nDivine efficacy utters the curse,\nNone slain shall be spared.\nGrand Tenuity’s command,\nSubdues mountains and streams.\nClashing bells cast forth,\nFlowing brilliance through the Nine Heavens.\nWind and fire launch their assault,\nDivine blades arrayed tenfold.\nMalevolent trials subdue and perish,\nTen thousand spirits beheaded and annihilated.\nDare any demonic toxin arise,\nSealed within the Three Passes.\nInvoking the Cavern Dharma,\nNone shall disobey these words.\n\nHaving recited this, knock the teeth thirty-six times again, then recite the *Great Cavern Demon-Quelling Divine Wisdom Jade Clarity Hidden Writ*:\n\nMysterious effulgence scatters at heaven’s edge,\nThe clear Han thins as clouds retreat.\nWondrous qi illumines the Three Mornings,\nCinnabar clouds radiate the Purple Tenuity.\nAll heavens

bow in the four directions in the mind. Envision the self seated amidst five-colored clouds, with cloud-qi covering above the head, and settle the vision.

Another nine August Lords likewise descend, piercing the Crimson Palace, entering the lower barrier’s realm. Another nine August Lords enter the middle barrier’s realm. Let the sunlight illuminate the entire body, inwardly penetrating the *Niwan*, shining down upon the five viscera, and through the intestines and stomach, all perceiving its illumination within and without.\n\nLet the entire body merge with the radiance of the sun and moon. After a long while, knock the teeth and exhale with the sound *xi*. Next, visualize the twenty-four stars, each one inch in size. This method may be practiced daily whether walking, standing, sitting, or reclining, as if in continuous union. Further visualize within each star a figure, so that the twenty-four stars contain twenty-four beings, all in the form of infants, naked and without garments or sashes. Then see the twenty-four stars descend from the void, circling the body three times.\n\nWhen this is complete, recite the invocation:\n*\"Twenty-four Perfected, return to the Yellow Court,\nExhale yellow qi from your mouths.\nTwenty-four stars, pour into my Gate of Life,\nA hundred spirits receive numinous power,\nBody filled, bones strengthened,\nHun and po at peace,\nFive viscera sealed with talismanic signs,\nHeaven and earth stand firm.\"*\n\nThen draw in the qi of the twenty-four stars with a single breath, swallowing saliva twenty-four times. With each swallow, feel a star enter the mouth and pass directly to the navel, its radiance illuminating the entire abdomen, penetrating the five viscera. Next, visualize the starlight transforming into twenty-four Perfected Ones, each exhaling yellow qi like mist, filling the navel and suffusing the interior and exterior with a dense, luminous glow. After a long while, exhale with the sound *hu*, and bow thirty-nine times.\n\nThen contemplate the thirty-nine portals of the body, each distinct and guarded by a divine spirit. Visualize the thirty-nine Lords descending their true qi to bathe the thirty-nine portals, swallowing saliva thirty-nine times. Next, shake the left hand three times, as if ringing a golden fire-bell; shake the right hand three times, as if casting the Seven Origins of the Vast Expanse. Tilt the head back and turn the neck nine times, as if bearing the heavens; stamp the foot once, as if treading the earth. Shake the body twice seven times to delight the myriad spirits. Wipe the eyes three times to brighten the Three Luminaries. Pinch the nose seven times to clear the Bridge of Light. Press the two points behind the eyebrows three times to block the source of evil. Rotate the ears three times to open the Heavenly Windows. Swallow saliva nine times to savor the Jade Pitchpipe.\n\nWhen all these practices for guiding the entire body are complete and the myriad spirits rejoice, softly recite the charm:\n*\"Bearing heaven, treading earth,\nEntering and exiting the Cavernous Gate,\nLeft hand ringing the flowing bell,\nRight hand casting the Seven Origins,\nGirded with gold, adorned with jade,\nImmortal robes fluttering,\nEight Effulgences arrayed,\nDriving the chariot upon clouds,\nTen thousand traversals luminously attained,\nSoaring into the Imperial Dawn.\"*\n\nThen sit upright and recite the scripture, visualizing the August Lord of the Supreme Unity facing you from the empty mystery, his mouth aligned with yours, listening to the recitation of the true scripture.\n\n*Here ends the first scroll of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scripture.*\n*Here begins the second scroll of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern Scripture.*\n\nMaster Jiang Zongying of the Thirty-Eighth Generation of Maoshan Supreme Clarity, Collator\n\n**First Scripture of the August Lord of the Supreme Void**\n**Chapter of the Youth of the Grand Tenuity**\n\nReverently invoke the Celestial Radiance Essence of the Youth of the Grand Tenuity, whose style is Meeting-the-Primordial Child, who ever guards the Gate of Dead Qi beneath the root of your tongue. His mouth exhales a crimson cloud that encircles your entire body, transforming and engendering blood and fluids, which ascend to congeal in the Muddy Pellet. When the Muddy Pellet is firm and luminous, the hundred spirits assume their proper positions.\n\nWith true contemplation, visualize the true qi of the Celestial Radiance Essence of the Youth of the Grand Tenuity, the hue of the crimson cloud, shrouding your crown. Silently recite the charm:\n\n*\"True qi flows downward to fill the Dark Pass,\nSealing the spirits, securing essence, blocking the source of death.\nThe Jade Scripture’s wisdom illumines the myriad spirits,\nThat for me they may summon true destiny and enduring life.\nDeliver the seven ancestors to revert as womb-born immortals,\nTempering and refining the hundred spirits into wholeness of qi.\"*\n\nNext, visualize the crimson qi entering from your Muddy Pellet. You then inhale the divine cloud through your mouth and swallow the saliva thrice, forming three spirits.\n\nThe first spirit resembles the Great General Tianpeng; the other two attend him. They descend to roam throughout your liver, then enter the Crimson Palace of the heart, ascending to fill the Mansion of Blood and Fluids beneath the root of the tongue. Exhale gently in accord with the rhythm of time.\n\nBefore reciting the Jade Scripture, first press the philtrum with your left hand, then proceed to recite.\n\nThe Jade Scripture of the Grand Cavern states:\n\n*\"Supreme Cavern of the Primordial,\nPrimordial engendering the Nine Heavens,\nQi-ancestor of the Great Nonbeing,\nHosts of winds in chaotic mystery.\nMystery once severed and scattered,\nThe Four Clarities pacify the tranquil.\nThe August Lord of the Supreme Unity of the Grand Cavern,\nTitled Lord of the Upper Effulgence,\nLinks the multitudes, gathers the mists,\nEternally bound to the One Revolution.\nSeven generations cast into tranquility,\nEntrusting numen, attaching destiny,\nReverting to spontaneous splendor,\nDissolving into the flowing void.\nThe Six Luminaries sink and shift,\nThe August Lord of the Jade Terrace, named Radiant Banner,\nThe White August Lord of the Western Florescence, named Manifest Peace,\nBoth inscribed in the imperial registers,\nAll attain liberation at the source.\nIn the profound recesses of the Womb Field and the Talisman Field,\nWhere the jade orchid of the world blooms,\nThe numinous light of the Eight Effulgences\nIntermingles to engender the myriad spirits.\"*\n\nThe Demon-Quelling Incantation of the Jade Sovereign of Jade Clarity states:\n\n*\"Heaven holds the great hidden treasure of the heart’s engendering,\nCalled the Luminous Beam above the heart’s qi, dispelling the non-smoke.\nGuard my sealed pass beneath the Dark Boundary,\nBeyond the Gate of Life in the Gate of the Kidneys’ Prison.\nThen summon the Feathered Youth of the Nose-Spirit of Beneficent Primordial,\nArrayed in the Green Chamber at the balcony of the philtrum,\nTo unbind the hundred knots of the seven ancestors,\nFollowing the wind to sever their roots,\nMatching heaven in shifting their foundation,\nAttaining transformation through entering the mystery.\"*\n\nThe Incantation of the Supreme Numinous Azure of the Divine Empyrean Jade Clarity Sovereign states:\n\n*\"Primordial qi is fundamentally non-born,\nThe Five Paths and Five Phases bear the void to emerge.\nFemale and male, yin and yang, lodge in divine transformation,\nThe profound and dark forests of the abstruse,\nThe jade tone resounds in Grand Harmony.\nTen thousand chants arise from the midst of nothingness,\nThe immortal court revolves through nine transformations.\nThe hundred chaos merge into the One.\nThere is in the northwest a Heavenly Gate named Converging the Void Center,\nAll together they enter the imperial hall to assemble.\"*\n\nConclude by softly reciting the charm:\n\n*\"Inner tone of heaven,\nThree Indigos arrayed, waves reach the terrace.\nOuter tone of earth,\nHeaven’s mandate endures, humanity ever tranquil.\"*\n\n**Jade Talisman of the Youth of the Grand Tenuity for Demon-Quelling**\n\nMethod: Write in blue upon yellow silk and wear it.

After a long while, I suddenly forget my own form. When the ritual is complete and the spirit and qi have settled, I feel my body light and pure, my spirit refreshed and expansive.\n\nThen I click my teeth thirty-nine times, rub my face with both hands, and recite the following ode:\n\nThe Most High instructs me,\nTo recite the *Dongzhen* scripture,\nJade tones harmonize with golden notes,\nRising to fill the Court of Supreme Nothingness.\nThey untie knots and disperse hidden misfortunes,\nLiberate the spirits of seven generations of ancestors,\nReturn to the womb and meet in the Southern Palace,\nThat each generation may bear a jade name.\nThe Three Paths’ roots of sin are extinguished,\nAnd through cyclic transformation, one ascends to the Upper Clarity.\n\nAfter reciting the scripture, I restore the incense burner and pray:\n\nI, your humble servant [Name], having entered the oratory on this auspicious day to perform the recitation of the *Thirty-Nine Chapters of the Supreme Clarity Great Cavern True Scripture*, now offer my wishes. May the immortal spirits and immortal officials, the Golden Lads and messengers, the Five Thearchs, the gods and immortals of the Five Marchmounts, the perfected of the Three Heavens, the True Spirits, the Lords of the Left and Right Dragon-Tiger, the immortals of heaven and earth, the Five Numinous Fragrance Officials, and the mighty spirits attendant upon the scripture, command the summoning of the upright qi from the ten directions. May the golden liquid, cinnabar, and jade mushrooms naturally arise, and may the Nine Mysteries and Jade Perfected gather in this hall of purification. Together, may they bathe my body, so that I may study the Dao and attain the Dao, seek immortality and attain immortality, soar through the Great Void, and ascend in radiance through the Nine Heavens. May jade lads and jade maidens attend me with fragrant incense, and may they report all that I have petitioned and vowed here, directly to the presence of the Lofty Perfected, the Jade Thearch, the Supreme Dao, and the myriad sagely hosts.\n\nWhen the prayer is finished, I bow in reverence to the four directions and rise.",

      "translated_text": "Master Zhu Ziying of the Twenty-Third Generation of Maoshan Shangqing Lineage, the Master Who Contemplates the Wondrous, states:\n\nThe Dao arises from Non-Being, abiding in the hidden numinous yet unfathomable;\nThe spirit congeals in Emptiness, wondrously transforming the myriad changes without fixed form.\nIn the profound obscurity, essence abides, and in supreme tranquility, radiance emerges;\nIn the boundless Great Mystery, one attains Emptiness and preserves Stillness—\nThis is called the *Great Cavern*.\n\nWhen essence is gathered and spirit is concentrated, one rides the primordial qi in cyclic rotation;\nWhen spirit is refined and the Dao is realized, auspicious winds are set in motion and dance.\nFrom Non-Being, Being suddenly arises, and through breath, the myriad spirits’ forms disperse;\nWhen movement reaches its extreme, stillness returns, and in the indistinct, the wondrous unity of the Imperial One is encircled—\nThis is called the *Cyclic Wind Unified*.\n\nIt is the root of universal propagation for Heaven and Earth, the origin of creation for emperors and sages.\nHumans are born, receiving qi from the Supreme Ultimate, their movement and stillness patterned after Heaven and Earth;\nThey originate in the One Primordial, their opening and closing embodying Yin and Yang.\nThus, the Thirty-Nine August Lords of Shangqing reflect their true forms downward, entering the thirty-nine portals within the adept’s body.\nEach portal, according to its corresponding passage, bears one chapter of the scripture.\nIts words are profound and abstruse, serving to command the hundred spirits, summon the true, and repel the false—\nWhat is called \"auspicious clouds open the Gate of Life, and propitious mists seal the Portal of Death\" refers to this.\n\nTherefore, the Central Yellow Elder of the Primordial Essence Dao Lord synthesized the esoteric intentions of the host of sages and compiled the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern*, hence its name: *The Thirty-Nine Chapters Scripture*.\nAdditionally, there are the *Cyclic Wind Imperial One*, the *Lofty Primordial Mighty One*, and the *Five Elders Feminine One*—these three scriptures serve to supplement the venerable *Thirty-Nine Chapters*.\n\nThe Dao possesses three marvels:\nThe first marvel is the *True Scripture of the Great Cavern in Thirty-Nine Chapters*;\nThe second marvel is the *Precious Scripture of the Five Elders Feminine One*;\nThe third marvel is the *Wondrous Scripture of the Vast and Subtle Primordial Numinosity*.\n\nThus, the *Thirty-Nine Chapters* is the esoteric formula of the Nine Heavens, the foremost scripture of the Supreme Primordial Lord, inscribed in golden characters.\nIt is also called the *Dragon Script of the Three Heavens* and the *True Dao Scripture of the Nine Heavens*.\nThis scripture was composed by the Primordial Heavenly King, who circulated qi across the ten directions of the Mysterious Subtle.\nThe Queen Mother of the West received the Dao from the Primordial Heavenly King and, together, they inscribed it in the Northern Primordial Heaven, in the Land of Luyena, upon the Spirit Mirror Mountain of the Bird-Men, within the Grotto of Shelai.\nIn a chamber of Emptiness, they gathered the qi of the Ninefold Mysterious Unity, coalescing it into a book. The characters measured a *zhang* in height, and it remains preserved to this day.\nThe Primordial Heavenly King further transmitted it to the Central Yellow Elder of the Eight Perfected of Shangqing, instructing him to teach it to those below who would become true persons and ascend to the Three Luminaries.\n\nThis scripture was concealed and guarded by the Central Yellow Elder, unknown to the world. Thus, in the mortal realm, upon the Five Sacred Peaks and within the celestial precincts of Heaven, it has never been present.\nThe Perfected of the Shangqing Heaven treasure and secrete it; only in the Great Mystery are there golden pavilions and jade tablets, purple slips and cinnabar records.\nIn the Three Origins, there are the *Secret Registers of the Conjoined Dawn*; in the Cinnabar Terrace, the yellow characters of the scripture.\nOnly those destined to become true persons may receive it.\n\nThis scripture is the banner of the Dao of the Supreme August, the wondrous text of the Purple Dawn.\nIt governs the ranks of the Nine Heavens, summons the numinous powers of the Five Emperors,\nUnifies the *Cyclic Wind* in its primordial harmony, coagulates the ninefold transmutations in mysterious essence,\nConjoins the feminine and masculine, unites the myriad spirits,\nArrayed in profound solemnity, resonating with the jade tones of the Great Perfected.\nIt dispels the false in the Luminous Beam, communicates the mutable in the Mysterious Gate,\nPenetrates virtue to attain the wondrous, washes radiance to illumine the clouds.\nThe Great Han becomes the qi of the Numinous Pass; the Boundless becomes the years of the Vast Kalpa.\nMajestic are the spirit halls, the abyss of the myriad Perfected;\nResplendent the golden chambers, flourishing in the Shangqing Heaven.\n\nIts purport is subtle and profound, difficult to exhaust in detail.\nIf the adept can maintain long-term purification, severing worldly attachments,\nRecite the jade chapters in the secluded chamber, and invoke the jade tones to stir the numinous,\nThen the true person’s register will be established in the Eastern Florescence,\nThe Seven Mysteries will be further refined in the Purple Chamber,\nThe Demon Kings will be subdued by numinous might,\nThe Five Emperors will be harnessed to guard the body.\nAfter ten thousand recitations, the fleshly body will ascend;\nAfter seven invocations, the Controller of Destiny will arrive.\nThese are the marvelous chapters of the *Great Cavern*, which gather the myriad Dao to return to life.\nWithout extraordinary feathers or anomalous forms, without golden bones or jade names,\nNone may rashly peruse the numinous text—its prohibitions strictly follow the *Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*.\n\nThe adept must undergo three years of arduous purification before being permitted to read it.\nUpon completing ten thousand recitations of these chapters, the Central Yellow Elder Dao Lord will memorialize above,\nAnd the Supreme Lord will command the cinnabar-gale chariot with its green canopy,\nWhile the Nine Numinous Envoys and the Controller of Destiny of the Great Unity come to welcome the adept.\nThus, the Five Elders will flank the carriage, the Eight Winds will fan their feathers,\nDivine thunder will lead the way, jade splendor will support the wheels.\nRiding clouds and driving dragons, the adept will ascend to Heaven that very day,\nProceeding to the palace of the Three Primordial Lords of the Supreme Simplicity to receive the scripture.\nThis is called ascending to the Shangqing Heaven, receiving the scripture in the Supreme Ultimate,\nAnd being appointed as the Left Minister of the Lofty Immortals.\n\nIf the adept merely possesses this scripture but does not recite it,\nThe Heavenly Emperor of the Supreme Tenuity will strike the adept’s name from the Register of Death.\nAt the outset of scripture transmission, the true register is established;\nAt the beginning of the purification rite, the Supreme Ultimate is invoked to inscribe the name in the Eastern Florescence.\nA memorial is presented to the Supreme Lord, and the name is recorded in the Tortoise Terrace.\nThe myriad spirits and thousand numina will then address the adept as the *Grand Master of the Nine Mysteries*,\nRanking equivalent to the *Immortal Earl of the Supreme Purity*.\n\nThe protocols for receiving the scripture strictly adhere to the *Luminous Regulations of the Nine Perfected*; the adept should comply accordingly.\n\n**Postface**\nThe *Book of Changes* states: \"Great indeed is the Primal Qi of Qian! All things owe their beginning to it.\"\nIt further states: \"The Dao of Qian transforms and changes, each attaining its proper nature and destiny. Preserving and uniting the Great Harmony, only then is there benefit and correctness.\"\nThe earlier scholars explained: \"What is called *yuan*? It is that which cannot be spoken—perhaps the state before Yin and Yang took form.\"\nWhat Heaven bestows is *ming* (destiny); what beings receive is *xing* (nature).\nNature and destiny are wondrous; only by preserving and uniting the Great Harmony can there be benefit and correctness.\nThe *Great Cavern Scripture* fundamentally concerns the return to the origin and the restoration of destiny.\nThose who discuss it in the world all say: \"The Dao is wondrous in Emptiness and Non-Being; the spirit is hidden in the sudden arising of Being.\"",

      "translated_text": "Before heaven and earth existed, this Dao already was. The disciples of the Mo and Si schools spoke of Confucius, saying: \"His nature and the Dao of Heaven—these could not be heard.\" Yet this Dao is none other than the wondrous subtlety of \"only the refined, only the unified,\" transmitted heart-to-heart by the Three Sages—Yao, Shun, and Yu—each in unbroken accord, never for an instant apart. By the Spring and Autumn period, as the age declined and customs decayed, it was regarded as something loftily impracticable, leaving people at a loss, and so the Master seldom spoke of it. Yet when Yanzi sat in forgetfulness and Zengzi responded with singular devotion, did they hear anything different? The purport of this scripture is to preserve the heart and nurture nature in serving Heaven, to gather essence and unite spirit in harmonizing with the Dao—entirely consistent with the Master’s teaching that \"when you grasp it, it remains; when you release it, it vanishes.\"\n\nSince the Yellow and Lao Lords of the Central Realm withdrew into seclusion, the world has known nothing of this. Thus, among the earthly realms of humanity and the five sacred mountains, this scripture has vanished forever. Later generations, never hearing of the Great Dao, have abandoned themselves to the sea of desires, drowning their aspirations in the dusty waves. How pitiable are those who would preserve the Great Harmony and rectify nature and destiny!\n\nAt the Shangqing Ancestral Altar of Mount Mao, transmission has spanned over a thousand years, yet only thirty-eight individuals have received it. For it reveals the hidden truths of heaven and earth before form arose and dissects the mysteries of the union of father and mother’s essences—thus it must remain concealed, never lightly or carelessly passed on.\n\nIn the second lunar month of the Xianchun reign, the Perfected Master of Jade Ocean’s Profound Mystery visited Jiuhua Mountain. While visiting a Daoist chamber, he spoke of this matter, and few were those who heard. Fearing its imminent extinction, he wished to broaden its transmission. I, Gongduan, bound by the green threads of three lifetimes’ karmic practice, received the Master’s instruction and, overwhelmed with gratitude, commissioned this carving in wood to fulfill his intent, sharing it with scholars across the world. May those who treasure this text, pledging their hearts before Heaven in transmission, vow to practice it and thus flourish this Dao.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the first lunar month in the ren-shen year of the Xianchun reign, the Dharma-heir Cheng Gongduan reverently inscribed this with burning incense.\n\nWhat is bestowed upon beings as nature and destiny is at once vast and minute, light and weighty, boundless in its presence and absence—yet never apart from the Dao, all may be seen and sought. Thus, one who attains the self becomes enlightened, then knows that heaven, earth, and the ten thousand things are but a single entity. That which is empty, numinous, and wondrous—do I not possess it? Since I possess it, it may be seen and sought. Why should it not share the same endowment as the vast and minute, the light and weighty, without ever being obscured?\n\nWhat is called a *scripture* of the Dao arises from the sound of celestial truth, the text of the Three Qi. None but the Perfected Immortals of the Supreme Emperor expound it before transmitting it to the world below. Its sound is heard in the absence of sound; its text takes form in the absence of form. It divides at the beginning of the primordial chaos, yet its unfolding and nurturing manifestations may be heard and perceived—hence it is called a *scripture*.\n\nTo unlock the treasury within oneself, to expound the scripture within oneself, to reveal its most profound truths and dispel the obstructions of the benighted—is it not that every being possesses this scripture? The *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern* comprises thirty-nine chapters, all concerning the principles of refinement. Those who practice it to completion—such as Wei, Yang, Guo, and Xu—attest to this.\n\nSome ascend to the lofty void, some penetrate to luminous clarity; some are meticulous in ritual observance, some nourish themselves through ingestion—each method has its similarities and differences, and none may be casually pursued. For the path of refinement must be rooted in nurturing qi and preserving spirit. Only after dispelling external distractions and dissolving thoughts does qi congeal and spirit transform. When all things and concerns are severed, and not even a hair’s breadth of obstruction remains, one returns to the primordial chaos. Thus, hunger and thirst vanish, birth and extinction cease. One roams with the clouds drifting through the sky, coming and going without limit.\n\nWhen such scriptures circulate in the world, those of reverent virtue must consider broadening their transmission. At its core, the intention to preserve goodness is one and the same.\n\nThe Daoist Xiong Changyi of Min, who has sought the Dao for years, sponsored the carving of this scripture and requested a preface. Alas! Many know the scripture as the Dao and follow it, yet few truly practice its Way. The teachings established by the Most High extend their grace to all creatures, enduring through countless generations without cease—such is their origin. How many can truly believe in themselves and diligently cultivate it? Those who believe and cultivate—what hinders them from attaining the scripture? How much more does it transcend the bounds of existence and non-existence, its numinous wonders far exceeding what the scripture alone conveys!\n\nHolders of this scripture should take heed of these words.\n\nThe Orthodox Unity Dharma-heir, Illuminator of the Dao’s Radiance, Perfected Zhang Yu Chu, Forty-Third Celestial Master and Overseer of Daoist Affairs, respectfully inscribed this.\n\n**Completion of the Sixth Scroll of the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern***\n**Beginning of the First Scroll of the *Perfect Scripture of the Great Cavern***",
