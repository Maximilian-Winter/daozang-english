  "full_translation": "*The Record of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen*\n*Sutra Title: The Comprehensive Record of Zhou’s Spiritual Communication*\n*Four fascicles. Composed by Tao Hongjing.*\n\n**Fascicle One**\n\nThe transcendent Zhou Ziliang, styled Yuansu, was a disciple of Tao the Recluse of Mount Mao. Originally from Jiqian Village, Du Township, Runan County, Runan Commandery in Yuzhou, he later resided in Qinghua Village, West Township of Jiankang in Danyang. His family was of illustrious lineage, renowned along the Jiangzuo region. In later generations, their fortunes declined, and they fell into hardship.\n\nHis grandfather, Wenlang, was nominated as a Filial and Incorrupt Candidate and served as Left Attendant in the household of the Prince of Jiangxia under the Liu-Song dynasty. His birth father, Yaozong, childhood name Jingang, was Wenlang’s fifth son. Yaozong held the post of Assistant in the Commandery and resided separately in Yuyao. He passed away in the second year of the Tianjian reign (503 CE) at the age of thirty-four and was provisionally interred there.\n\nHis adoptive uncle, Yaoxu, served as Registrar of the Prefecture and later as Consultant in the Yangzhou Administration. His mother, Xu Jingguang of Yongjia, dreamed during her fifth month of pregnancy that all the sages in a celestial chamber rose and circumambulated her from all sides. Thus, on the second day of the first month in the ding-chou year of the Jianwu reign (497 CE), at the hour of *ren ding*, he was born in Mingxing Village, Yuyao.\n\nAt the age of one, he was taken in and raised by his aunt, Baoguang, who treated him as her own son. From childhood, Ziliang was upright and intelligent, his nature gentle and refined. His family never witnessed him display anger. At ten, he followed his adoptive mother back to Yongjia.\n\nIn the seventh year of the Tianjian reign (508 CE), the Recluse journeyed eastward to the sacred mountains. Temporarily residing at Mount Qingzhang in Yongning, the Recluse entered the east. Originally bound for Yuyao, they boarded a sea vessel to Mount Huo in Jin’an. As they descended the Zhe River at dusk, the tide surged, dragging the boat toward Dingshan—a force beyond human control. They thus proceeded to Dongyang, intending to stay in Yongkang. Suddenly, they encountered a man from Yongjia who extolled the beauty of the local mountains and waters, so they followed him to the commandery. There, they sought out Magistrate Lu Xiang of Yongning. Lu personally escorted them to rest at the Hall of the Celestial Master, where Ziliang had already been lodging. Here, they first met. The circumstances of his arrival seemed divinely ordained, as if summoned by numinous spirits. Otherwise, the reason would remain unfathomable.\n\nAt the time, Ziliang was twelve years old. He sought to enter the mountain, submit to discipline, and become a disciple. He first received *The Register of Immortals and Spirits*, *The Five Thousand Character Scripture of Laozi*, and *The Talisman of the Western Marchmount for Suppressing Tigers and Leopards*, thereafter devoting himself wholeheartedly to the duties of incense and lamp offerings. Whatever he took interest in—calligraphy, painting, or miscellaneous arts—he mastered with focused attention.\n\nLater, he followed the Recluse to Southern Huo. Upon returning to Muliu, he served with utmost reverence and diligence, day and night.\n\nIn the eleventh year, he followed [the Recluse] back to Maoling. Thereafter, he advanced to receive *The Charts of the Five Marchmounts* and *The Esoteric Writings of the Three Sovereigns*.\n\nIn the autumn of the twelfth year, his maternal relatives came to reside in the mountains, so he moved out to dwell separately in a western hermitage. On the summer solstice of the fourteenth year, the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the *yiwei* cyclical year, he suddenly fell into a deep sleep at noon in the hermitage. After a long while, he arose and emerged. His aunt, not understanding the reason, pressed him severely. He then recounted in detail what he had seen, as recorded separately.\n\nFrom then on, for forty or fifty days, he felt profoundly altered. He constantly lowered the blinds, shut the doors, and barred others from entering his chamber, burning incense in solitude. At midday, he consumed only a *sheng* of honey. His family had long worshipped common spirits, and his maternal uncle and Daoist companions all feared this was a deception by mundane deities or suspected he had been afflicted by perverse *qi*. They repeatedly questioned him in alarm, but he only replied: \"Perhaps it was merely a dream of *vārttā*—I know nothing for certain. I am troubled and anxious, so I have cut myself off.\" Thus, none could discern the truth, and they let the matter rest, observing his inclinations.\n\nIn the seventh month, he secretly received the true teachings, which instructed him to blend into the world outwardly while drawing near, so as not to arouse suspicion.\n\nFrom then on, his diligence in service surpassed even his usual devotion. In the tenth month of that year, he followed his master to Zhu Yang. Later, when the master moved to reside separately at Shu Mountain, he remained solely at the Western Lodge, overseeing external affairs, receiving both Daoists and laypeople—all held him in love and reverence. By nature a gentleman, reticent in speech yet swift in action, whatever he undertook was accomplished in silence. His cultivation was pure and upright, utterly free of self-interest. Having long since cast off worldly desires, he secretly followed the hidden decree. Anticipating the need for a posthumous name, he devised a pretext to request construction. Though he built three modest chambers, the work remained unfinished for some time. By the tenth month of this year, he had quietly completed it himself, arranging windows, doors, and curtains. On the nineteenth, he invited his relatives and Daoist companions to contribute to its furnishing. Those who came to inspect it sensed his concealed form and sidelong demeanor, yet\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day, he was interred at dusk, and a tomb of fine jade was constructed on the eastern ridge. On the third day of the eleventh month, the *bingyin* day, he was again interred at dusk, and earth was heaped to form the grave. Thereafter, his voice and form vanished into silence, leaving no trace in waking or dream—was this the boundary between man and spirit, a moment awaiting its time?\n\nThe origins of his attainment of the Dao and his posthumous title are fully recorded in the *Account* he received, while the present text briefly outlines his deeds in this world as witnessed and heard, hence its placement before the *Account*.\n\nThat same day, four sealed letters were found upon his writing desk, their seals and covers damp. One was for his master, one for his stepmother and maternal aunt, one for his uncle Xu Puming, and a large one—containing four sheets—for the Daoists of the Southern Lodge and Eastern Mountain. All were farewells, each dated the twenty-seventh. Judging by this, he must have returned from Zhuyang and written them then. After finishing the letters, he burned incense.\n\nUpon inspection, the warm wine pot still held the usual scent of alcohol, but the clay basin had been rinsed with water, leaving no trace of qi, nor any sign of medicine. The cause remained unfathomable. A prescription was later found in the *Account*, leading some to suspect it might have been the one. His master, lamenting the matter, regretted not having examined the letters sooner. Now, others meticulously searched through chests and boxes, hoping to find the lost *Account*, yet not a single note remained. Fortunately, it was recalled that on the sixteenth day, he had burned two bundles of writings—over a hundred sheets—allowing no one to see them. It was suspected these had all been destroyed, deepening the sorrow, which lingered unresolved.\n\nOn the first day of the eleventh month, the *jiazi* day, a trial journey was made to the cave at Yankou Mountain, where a large sealed letter was indeed found. Climbing the rugged slope, it was retrieved with a hook, and upon returning, it was opened with reverence. It contained instructions received five months prior, detailing only four matters after the Summer Solstice, with June and July fully recorded. From August onward to the seventh month of this year, entries ceased. The table of contents briefly listed events, merely noting their occurrence, leaving it unclear whether other matters—like those of June and July—had been omitted or simply not recorded in full. Perhaps they were intentionally left unelaborated. How could one know?\n\nIn the first few dozen days after his descent, he had found leisure and tranquility, but later, entangled in worldly affairs and the burdens of kinship, he could not escape others’ notice. What he committed to paper was only the barest outline. One can only imagine how much instruction he must have given in those ten-odd months—what a pity it was not inquired after! This was his master’s failing.\n\nThe sealed letters contained scattered and disordered papers, now arranged in chronological order. From the eighth to the tenth month of this year, not a single entry was found. As for the burned writings, they were surely of a different kind, for he would not have incinerated them one by one. Perhaps they were texts meant to remain hidden.\n\nPreviously, only a few matters had been disclosed to his master and maternal aunt. The first was his midday nap on the Summer Solstice, which drew strange rebukes from within and without, leaving him no choice but to explain. The second was his refusal to eat dried meat, which also provoked suspicion, forcing an explanation. The third was the true decree to change from vermilion to ink when jointly petitioning for rain, which he could not conceal. The fourth was the decree to halt his master’s summons, which he was instructed to reveal. These were the only clear instances. For all other inquiries, he remained evasive, never issuing explicit commands.\n\nEarlier, after his master had perused the scriptures once, he had declined further visits and moved to Zhuyang. Later, when matters arose, he was repeatedly questioned and answered, but as he did not always respond, no replies were recorded, and thus nothing was made known. Now, upon reflection, it seems certain there were answers. Perhaps he feared that responding would invite endless requests, while silence would draw reproach. To answer fully would risk exposing hidden decrees, so he concealed them all.\n\nThe *Account* contains many taboo names of true immortals and various teachings, akin to sacred scriptures. It must be approached with the same reverence: washing hands, donning clean robes, burning incense, and only then reading it. If one wishes to copy it, one must first inform the assembled immortals and adepts—it is not to be treated like ordinary writings.\n\nAround the dwelling where he resided, the courtyard altar was shaded by several large *xiang* trees. The one before the door was especially lush. On the fifteenth day of the twelfth month in the *jiawu* year, something like sugar was suddenly seen scattered all over the tree, with the middle portion particularly dense. Around dusk, Ding Jingda, the lecturer of Huayang, came to visit Xu Puming and witnessed it as well, asking in astonishment. Seeing this sweet dew descend, the household wished to conceal the matter and jested, “The children must have poured sugar on it.” They tasted it together—it was like honey—and hastily broke off two branches to display, hanging them on the door curtain, where they remained for over ten days. According to the *Illustrated Record of Auspicious Omens*, sweet dew falling on bamboo and *wu* trees is a sign of propitious qi. Upon reflection, of all the trees near the altar, only this one before the door was so luxuriant—surely this was meant to reveal that divine spirits had descended to guide him.\n\nTo the south of the dwelling, a covered walkway was flanked by bamboo planted on both sides, their roots creeping beneath the veranda. On the eighteenth day of the fifth month in the *yiwei* year, he and his uncle Xu Puming were in the main hall conducting a three-day grand vegetarian feast for the Xie family. After its conclusion, during the dispersal of the fast, Xu Puming briefly returned to the dwelling. Suddenly, he saw a bamboo shoot sprouting from the roots beneath the walkway, already over three inches tall and split into two stalks, both shooting up with tender shoots nine inches long. Yesterday, nothing had been there—now, it had appeared in an instant. Xu Puming, recognizing the marvel, feared his young nephew might pluck it, so he broke it off and brought it to the main hall, showing it to all the Daoists, who gasped in amazement, having never seen the like. The recluse deeply regretted not letting it grow into bamboo and, fearing it would rot, dried it by fire. It remains preserved to this day.\n\nExamining bamboo, it is the essence of stars, often manifesting numinous efficacy. The people of Xiangzhou craft \"united-heart bamboo,\" all awaiting the emergence of shoots, then carving notches into the sides to form openings—thus, a single stalk may bear four, yet this remains one bamboo, merely hollowed at the center on both sides. Never before has there been a bamboo that splits into two shoots from a single root, each standing apart. On the twenty-third day of this month, the summer solstice, this portent descended, surely signifying a hidden resonance of harmonious union, bearing the virtue of the parasol bamboo.\n\nMoreover, Zhou Yi Zhu, a yang-dwelling official, had a house built in the east. Stacked thatch lay in the northeast of the house, and behind it, remnants of thatch covered the rear. When Zhou went to gather and restack it, he suddenly saw a white tortoise, about six inches long, its body, shell, and skin smooth as talc, save for four black markings on its back resembling written characters, though indecipherable. He caught it and played with it for some time, then wished to take it home but dared not, so he released it. Upon returning, he told his family of this.\n\nNow, the tortoise is inherently a spiritually potent creature, long-lived and prescient, and it emerged from beneath the stacked thatch, seemingly to manifest the numen of Tea Ridge. Generally, white creatures are all considered divine marvels. When the recluse heard of this, he wished to record it for posterity, but upon further search, it was no longer to be found. Nearby Daoists often spoke of a white tortoise in Willow Valley that would vanish whenever someone tried to take it. It is suspected this tortoise was the same, though its appearance in the thatch pile several hundred paces from his home remains a mystery.\n\nThe above is recalled in retrospect, as I remember these two extraordinary events recorded in the annals. Thus, the account is presented.\n\nYour Highness,\n\nI, Hongjing, respectfully submit: In the latter part of the tenth month, the matter concerning the Zhou family arose suddenly. As I was then observing purification rites, I had no means to report it immediately. Now, I have meticulously compiled the recent events into four scrolls, as separately presented, and humbly offer them for Your Majesty’s perusal.\n\nYet, I remain entangled in the webs of doubt and delusion, having failed to awaken to the truth sooner. In hindsight, I reproach myself deeply, and fear my negligence may incur severe censure. I have recounted the details in full, and prostrate myself, beseeching Your Majesty’s forbearance for my lapses.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nThe sixteenth day of the twelfth month.\n\n---\n\nUpon reviewing the memorial and examining the relics left by the Zhou family, the revealed truths are manifest, their signs and confirmations aligning with earlier prophecies. The clarity of these two or three matters is all the more extraordinary. The four scrolls are now retained here, and the details are fully recorded in the accompanying text, inspiring only greater admiration.\n\nThe twentieth day of the eleventh month.\n\n*Divine Brush*\n\n---\n\nWhen the Zhou matter first arose, I was in seclusion at Yugang, observing the Leaf-Limited Fast, and thus could not report it at once. Only after completing the posthumous records did I dispatch Pan Zhongzheng to present the memorial. It was received in the inner palace, where the four scrolls were unsealed and read in full. Every detail was scrutinized, and questions were posed on each matter, to which I responded accordingly.\n\n*Account of the Zhou Transmission*\n\n---\n\nThe fifth-month affair was transcribed exactly as it occurred. There was a recluse who instructed Zhu to annotate the imperial edict.\n\nOn the day of the Summer Solstice, a little before noon—specifically, the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the fourteenth year of the Tianjian era (the year *yimao*, *bingzi*)—I was resting in the southern woods of my residence. As I awoke, I had Shansheng lower the curtain. At the time, I was staying in the western chamber of my aunt’s residence, where she was afflicted with ringworm. Shansheng was the son of my two aunts, originally surnamed Zhu. At the age of seven, he fell gravely ill in Yongjia for over ten days, nearing death, when I intervened to save him and took him in as a disciple of the Dao.\n\nBefore I had fully settled into sleep, I suddenly beheld a man standing nearly seven *chi* tall, with a small face, fierce mouth and nose, thick brows, and a sparse beard. His complexion was pale with a bluish tint, and he appeared to be around forty. He wore a crimson robe with red shoes, his cap adorned with cicada-shaped ornaments and long, trailing ribbons. A purple leather belt, about seven *cun* wide, encircled his waist, from which hung a brush-case shaped like a dragon’s head. His shoes, dyed black and purple, made a rustling sound as he walked. Twelve attendants followed him.\n\nTwo of the attendants wore their hair in topknots, styled like those of the elderly women of Yongjia. This knot was bound loosely at the roots, the ends hanging down to the forehead. They wore purple robes with green trousers, their shoes loosely tied to the trousers, the bindings exceedingly slack. Three others were clad in purple trousers, their jackets gathered with flat-folded headscarves. Each held a bamboo slip, inscribed with characters that could not be deciphered. The remaining seven all wore white cloth trousers, their jackets tucked into their shoes, each carrying something in hand. One bore a sitting mat, another a *ruyi* scepter, and a third a five-colored feather fan. One carried a large scroll of books, another held paper and brush along with a large inkstone—black in color, the brush no different from those of the world. Another grasped a *jiao*, its form resembling a feather or variegated silk, mottled and lovely. The *jiao* was round and deep, its handle black and exceedingly long. After entering the room, they leaned it against the eaves. Two others each carried a satchel, as large as a small pillar, seemingly filled with documents.\n\nThe one bearing the mat unfurled it upon the book stand. The mat was white, luminous, its weave like that of a fine rush mat, though its strands were coarser. Six attendants entered the room and stood before the low table. As the man entered, he frowned and said, \"This is far too close.\" He then took his seat, resting his arm upon the book stand. At that moment, the brush and the ruler—about a *chi* in length—lay upon the stand. He took them and placed them within the inner frame, then moved the frame to the northern end.\n\nThe room he occupied was the west wing, consisting of two chambers, separated from the main hall by only three bays of a veranda. He had remarked it was too close, perhaps because it was pressed near the hall, though the hall had already been burned to the ground. It was unclear what he meant by \"too close.\" The room faced east, with a door on its northern side. A five-*chi* sleeping couch stood against the western wall—this was where I had been napping. My head lay to the west, allowing me to see outside. Another five-*chi* couch stood against the northern wall, where the low table was placed. A third five-*chi* space by the window held the book stand, which faced east. The inkstone originally sat at the northern end of the stand, the brush frame at the southern end, so he moved the frame beside the inkstone and rested his arm upon the stand.\n\nHe then asked those beside him, \"Why did you not bring the desk?\"\n\nHe replied, \"The officials were on the move and did not bring it.\"\n\nThen he said to Ziliang, \"I am the vice-magistrate of this mountain’s prefecture. I have come to visit you because I admire your blamelessness.\"\n\nZiliang rose to adjust his robe but did not respond. At the time, I felt myself rise to answer clearly, yet others saw my body still outside, bewildered and unable to comprehend.\n\nHe then asked, \"Today is an auspicious day, and the sun is nearly at its zenith. Are you observing the fast?\"\n\nZiliang answered, \"I follow the usual court rites and take my midday meal—though I do not yet understand the rules of fasting.\"\n\nHe said, \"A midday meal is sufficient. But in summer, napping is not beneficial. Do not indulge in excessive sleep.\" He then added, \"Your body is frail; even minor tasks leave you weary, and when weariness comes, you feel as though you must sleep, unable to resist.\"\n\nHe said, \"Such small matters need not trouble you.\"\n\nJust then, a gust of wind blew, nearly knocking him over, so he ordered his attendants to steady him. A child named Chidou was playing in the courtyard and ran up to the edge of the steps. The attendants pushed him away with their hands. Langshan then reached from a shelf to take a dam, but in doing so, he bumped into the attendants, and Langshan fell to the ground. The attendants caught him with their hands.\n\nThe visitor asked, \"Where did this little boy come from?\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"My family is in Qiantang, surnamed Yu. We are temporarily lodging here.\"\n\nHe said, \"Do not let him go naked—it offends the good spirits.\"\n\nThe little boy, named Chidou, was five years old, the son of Yu Sengxia. He said the child had suffered many misfortunes and was temporarily entrusted to a Daoist for care. In summer, he often played outside naked.\n\nThe visitor then asked, \"Who is Langshan?\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"My family resides in Yongjia, under the patronage of Master Tao Ying.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Master Tao possesses noble aspirations, and many seek refuge with him.\"\n\nLangshan was surnamed Xu, a native of Lecheng County, aged sixteen or seventeen. He had previously followed a recluse back to the mountains but had since departed.\n\nThe visitor then said to Ziliang, \"Your father once committed minor transgressions, but they were absolved three years ago, and he now dwells in a place of peace. He claims his tomb lies in Yue. Though he has wandered far, he does not wish to have it moved. There is a pit to the south—it should be filled. He had intended to come with me, but unfinished matters of documents prevented him. Next spring, he will be reborn into a royal household, for his past transgressions are not yet fully exhausted, and so he must return to the world. You originally planned to retrieve your father’s coffin in the year *jiawu* and bring it west, but the matter did not come to pass. The Zhou family is of the *jiao* lineage; after this year, when the years *shen* and *you* have passed, we may discuss it again. It was your father who did not permit the move, and thus he informed me.\"\n\nZiliang went to verify this and indeed found the pit, which had already been filled.\n\nThe visitor said, \"In your past life, you were blessed to encounter the true Dharma. In this life, you have not lost the heart of a human or a spirit. According to the records, your great fate still extends forty-six years. Truly, while living as a man, one clings to the world, but as a spirit after death, one lingers in the unseen realm. If we speak plainly, the unseen realm is superior. There is now a vacancy in the prefecture, and I wish to appoint you to fill it. The details are nearly settled—say no more. Next year, in the tenth month, you will be summoned. Prepare in advance, for I have come to inform you. If you do not accept this appointment, the writs of the Three Offices will arrive—take heed.\"\n\nZiliang’s face showed fear.\n\nThe visitor said, \"You hasten to remain in the world and accumulate transgressions—how could you be fit to assume a post in my grotto-realm? Facing the celestial perfected, roaming the sacred precincts—you should know there is no place in the world more exalted than this.\"\n\nZiliang then replied, \"I can only defer to your guidance.\"\n\nThe visitor continued, \"From your youth until now, you have not been without minor faults. Reflect upon them and repent. If you do not, they will become a burden upon you. All who cultivate the Dao must not go naked or bare their topknots, nor harm the innocent without cause. In all matters of conduct, eating, and drinking, you must adhere to the regulations. I have told you this much—my words end here. Now return to your duties. The affairs of your office remain uncertain, but the resolution is not far off.\"\n\n\"Take heed of my words, and do not reveal them to the careless folk of the world—those here in the mountains who share our knowledge will have no quarrel with you.\"\n\nHe then rose from his seat, and before stepping through the door, Ziliang saw upon it the names *Lingchun* and *Liu Bai*: the former was his aunt’s serving girl, the latter a younger cousin on his father’s side. The visitor added, \"Do not let the children approach the altar or the oratory, for within the oratory lie true scriptures. The great hall’s foundation was lost in the previous fire, and even now, officials and guards stand watch—do not treat it lightly. The ignorant may act recklessly, but such matters implicate the household’s master.\"\n\n\"The gate lies ahead, with a chamber dividing the inner and outer sections. The quiet chamber and the altar stand beyond the partition. The scripture hall was burned, so the texts were moved to a secluded place. The hall had four bays: the eastern two served as the refectory, while the western two were where your aunt resided. On the twenty-third day of the fourth month of that year, the fire consumed all four bays. Your aunt was reciting the *Three Ones of the Yellow Court*, making offerings to the *Wei Transmission*, the *Su Transmission*, the *Five Marchmounts*, and the *Five Talismans of the Three Sovereigns*. The true scriptures likely refer to these, though I do not understand why guards remain when the foundation lies empty.\"\n\n\"Your aunt’s illness runs deep. Though it may not prove fatal, it will be difficult to cure.\" Ziliang then asked, \"How might it be treated? And what of the mass in her abdomen—how can it be removed?\" The visitor replied, \"It cannot be removed at once. Over months and years, who can say what may come? The mass in her abdomen may yet improve suddenly, but I will speak of this to you another time.\"\n\n\"The earlier remark about matters implicating the household’s master referred to your aunt—thus I spoke of her illness without waiting for your inquiry. Your aunt is forty-seven years old and has long suffered from wind-stroke, with frequent shortness of breath. On her left side, a mass of qi the size of a cup has formed, which no physician or medicine has ever cured.\"\n\nLingchun and the others departed, and as the visitor descended the steps, he vanished. Though divine beings come and go without fixed abode, appearing as suddenly as a forest without doubt, there are times when they avoid others—lest the impure and base offend them.\n\nThis entry was recorded on the Summer Solstice, written on four sheets of white paper with margins. Following the previous account, this concerns Zhao Yubao of Hedong, known variously as *Siming* or *Bohuo*, who oversees the celestial registers, wind, rain, and water, as well as the administration of the Five Zhi, gold, jade, and herbs. Recorded in *The True and Unadorned Pavilion*.\n\nThat night, at the third watch, someone again knocked at the door, announcing, \"Marshal Fan has arrived.\" Before a response could be made, he had already entered—a man of imposing stature, dignified and solemn in appearance, wearing a tall crown resembling stacked layers, and dressed in ceremonial robes. Only three attendants followed him, all clad in black, their features indistinguishable even in daylight. Outside the door, a radiance like a torch burned, yet no flame was visible.\n\nThe marshal leaned against a tree and spoke: \"I am surnamed Fan and serve as the controller of ghosts and spirits in the *Dinglu* Prefecture. The *Dinglu* and *Baoming* Prefectures share the same domain but govern distinct territories, each guarded by celestial perfected ones. Both lords share the surname Mao—brothers, with the younger brother of *Dinglu* overseeing *Baoming*. You should already know this. Recently, a great minister toured the boundaries, recording the sins and blessings of men.\"\n\nHaving passed by your residence, I learned that the two lords and all the supervising officials of the prefecture have selected you to serve as *Baoji* Vice-Minister—a position newly established to assist in overseeing the registers. Though its duties are minor, its rank is lofty and its purity esteemed; ideally, it should be held by two or three who enjoy the patronage of the Perfected Immortals of the lineage. Your earlier responses to the minister were not at all displeasing. Why then did you later disagree with your aunt, thereby allowing the daily administrators to report the matter and inform the minister? Suspecting you of lapsing into heterodox customs, the minister was deeply displeased and wished to charge you with the offense of faithlessness—hence my dispatch to deliver this warning.\n\nI observe that your worldly attachments remain unsevered, and the clamor of dust easily leads you astray. Why do you indulge the seven *po* while constraining the three *hun*? Truly, this stems from your long entanglement with the affairs of the silk-clan households—petty practitioners who boast of their merits to delude others, as if you were one of their flock. Had your earlier judgment not faltered, your name would not have been inscribed on the black tally.\n\nThe Zhou family’s ancestral rites are those of common gods—prayers and vulgar invocations, the very way of the silk-clan. Even Master Xu, when tested, spoke thus. Your maternal grandmother, née Du, was a great shamaness, and her influence lingers. Your mother’s family, the Xus, were once Daoist libationers, and your aunt converted her father’s branch to the Way. Thus, I feared only that you might be ensnared by vulgar spirits. Yet seeing you sink ever deeper into rusticity, I have come to admonish you in full.\n\nSince you have not yet grasped the true purport, it is only natural that doubts persist.\n\nZiliang said: \"I once harbored doubts, but how dare I now dissent?\"\n\nThe Marshal replied: \"The sacred and numinous have their own principles—how could they be debated in mere words? Moreover, you once served as Prefect overseeing Wu and Yue, entrusted with great responsibilities. When proclamations were issued, how could you refuse to comply? Your late father also petitioned me, claiming no heir remained, but I did not permit it. Even when he appeared in the netherworld to plead in person, I did not relent. Now, with a corpse defiled by death, how could a mere written petition suffice? Even if it reached me, I would not grant it—wasting only paper and ink. At the time, your aunt wished to submit a memorial and draft a petition on your behalf, so I spoke thus to put an end to it.\n\nYou burn incense day and night, praying for immortality and transcendence. Now that your wish has been granted, what more do you seek? As for the Second Perfected, he has journeyed to the Palace of Grand Primordial and has not yet returned. When he does, I fear he will question you, so I have sent him ahead to verify. You may answer according to your heart.\n\nYour elder brother, the Second Lord, is the Great Director of Destinies and a Perfected of Grand Primordial, governing the Crimson City of Great Huo. He likely departed for his audience there on the summer solstice and has not yet returned.\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"I am but an unlearned layman, unable to discern truth from falsehood. I humbly beg your indulgence and dare not dissent.\"\n\nThe Marshal said plainly: \"Good.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Each time you perform your rites, first complete the ceremonial obeisances to the four directions as prescribed, then bow to the Three Perfected Lords—Director of Destinies, Recorder of Deeds, and Guardian of Life. Since you reside in the countryside, this is proper.\"\n\nAt that moment, Ziliang had placed his clogs crosswise before the general’s seat and was lying down without his robe. The Marshal said: \"As a Daoist, it is improper to sleep exposed or to place clogs crosswise. If clogs are laid crosswise, evil spirits will not fear you.\"\n\nZiliang assented.\n\nThe precepts warn: \"When removing shoes, place them with the heels aligned and toes pointing outward.\" This is the reason. All Daoists should always wear sleeping robes, resembling short unlined garments. It is also forbidden to sleep with the topknot unbound.\n\nZiliang then asked: \"Since the numinous ones have deigned to instruct me, might I humbly request an extension of several years?\"\n\nThe Marshal replied: \"Lower your voice—others may hear. Earlier, we discussed your doubts, and the Director of Destinies has already been informed. Now that I have come to verify, you still seek an extension. I fear word may reach the throne, so I tell you to lower your voice—not necessarily because I fear others hearing.\"\n\nAt that time, Zizao was also sleeping in a separate grove. The Marshal added: \"What was previously requested cannot be granted. Your fate is already fixed, and this office cannot remain vacant for long. That is why I have come again in earnest—solely for this reason. Now, I speak to you privately—do not disclose it.\n\nSince you lack the arts of deliverance, you must still secure a proper resting place for your remains. Only south of the great ridge, in the land of your ancestral gardens, may you find a suitable burial site. If that area is too stony, examine the left side of Mount Liangchang in the north—there should be good earth. Do not return to the original site. The original plot is defiled by worldly filth and overgrown with weeds; if buried there, it will bring you no benefit.\"\n\nI have never determined where the gardens south of the ridge lie. Liangchang is some ten *li* northeast of Zhuyang, its ridges extending to this region, yet I have never heard of anyone surveying the land. Today, in haste, you have chosen this eastern ridge for the tomb. Later, upon reviewing these records, you will recall that on the eighth day of the eleventh month last year, the Recorder of Deeds declared: \"Building a house where divination for burial was conducted is inauspicious.\"\n\nWhen the house was first constructed, you wished to site it near the eastern grove, but the recluse objected, finding the grove too large and distant. Now you have returned to the western slope. Clearly, the current burial site aligns with the earlier directive, though it does not match this marshal’s mention of Liangchang, it accords with the Recorder of Deeds’ divination on burial.\n\nSince you lack the arts of deliverance and must secure a resting place for your remains, this corpse will not return. Thus, I have sought a good burial site in cold earnest. The rest of the coffin and burial rites may follow worldly customs.\n\nAll the scriptures and talismans you have received may accompany you, but their divine guardians will require the names of your three masters, along with the year and month of your ordination. The Three Officials and water spirits may question you again—you must be prepared to answer, not left speechless. Leave instructions for your family to do the same, for this is following the master’s teachings.\n\nYou have inscribed *The Five Peaks Chart*, *The Transmission of the Three Sovereigns*, and various scriptures and talismans, stating they should be worn on your person. But I do not know who your three masters are—does this refer to the master of registration, the master of ordination, and the master of scriptures, or simply three generations of successive masters? I never inquired further, but scriptural records state that when a person’s life ends, whether they become immortal or ghost, they must pass through the Three Officials, all of whom require verification of lineage. Thus, the bond between master and disciple is not easily formed.\n\nI now depart—do not forget this proof. Though your fate is fixed, you must still exercise caution. True caution repels dark evil, and divine spirits will guard and protect you, making it easier to attract blessings. Since you dwell amid worldly dust, we cannot return often.\"\n\nThen, pointing to the peach-and-bamboo decoction written on the wall, he said: \"If you feel unwell, bathe according to this formula. How did you come by this prescription?\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"I copied it from the *True Reports*.\"\n\nThe Marshal said: \"This was what the Southern Perfected revealed to Yang and Xu—you have obtained it well. The Second Lord also marked it as outstanding.\"\n\nBefore his words ended, Ziping awoke, and the Marshal departed.\n\nThis passage records the instructions received on the summer solstice night, densely written on a large sheet of hemp paper.\n\nThis Marshal Fan is the Guardian of Life, one of the Four Ghost Marshals. His name is Fan Jiangwu, the foremost of the four, as recorded in the *True and Unadorned*. However, the reason he refers to himself as \"I\" and addresses others as \"you\" remains unclear.\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day, during the second watch, I opened my eyes to see a figure standing before me. His appearance was dignified, with a full beard, fine brows and eyes, and an age of perhaps twenty-odd. His face was most pleasing. He wore a lotus crown with long, hanging blue tassels, and his robe resembled a single-layer garment, though woven with red, blue, yellow, and white in a pattern like brocade, yet not plain silk. His waist sash emitted a radiance like the candlelight when Marshal Fan had previously appeared, though the candle had already extinguished itself.\n\nThe figure claimed to be from Zhongshan, and said: \"Master Mao has appointed you as his chancellor. He has already sent the chancellor-marshal to inform you, and the matter is settled. I have now come to teach you the method of cultivating the Dao. You may follow my instructions and draft a memorial to Ziliang, then begin writing it on paper.\"\n\nThis occurred on the twenty-seventh day of the fifth month. Upon seeing Ziliang record the date, the figure smiled and said: \"Noting the month is good, but as the years grow distant, those who see it later will not know which era it refers to.\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"The previous chancellor-marshal’s arrival was already recorded by year. Now, I only need—\" The figure then said: \"Recording it on paper is best.\"\n\nZiliang thus wrote four characters below: \"The year of *yǐwèi* under the Great Year Star.\"\n\nAccording to this figure’s words, he was clearly not bound to the mortal world, yet the reason for concealing the *Zhou* seals and caches remains unclear. His intent seemed to be that the transmission should not be freely disseminated. The earlier accounts of Yang and Xu were also of this nature.\n\nThose who become Daoist practitioners must first understand the essentials of longevity. If one cannot yet feast on rosy clouds and drink the radiance of the sun and moon, or discipline oneself to seek the truth, then remaining in the world is of no benefit to the body. The reason for summoning you now is twofold: first, to assist in timely affairs, and second, to receive instruction for cultivating the body. Over time, you may gain its power. Only when the five viscera are whole and the marrow is full can one truly seek the Dao. Now, your four limbs are weak and emaciated, your spirit and essence obstructed. The true destiny cannot be awaited in haste, but you may observe the two stars once or twice daily to establish a connection.\n\nZiliang then asked: \"I do not know where these stars are located or what they look like.\"\n\nThe figure replied: \"The Northern Dipper has nine stars, but only seven are visible, while two remain hidden. Observe them on the twenty-seventh day of the month or the third day of the new moon. Their forms will shine with exceptional brilliance. You may now draw the seven stars, and I will vaguely indicate their orientation.\"\n\nZiliang dipped his brush and sketched the seven stars. The figure said: \"I cannot move my hands freely. Simply place the two stars at the head of the Dipper’s handle, and I will tell you.\"\n\nAfter arranging them, Ziliang asked again, but the figure did not answer, nor did he respond to a second inquiry. Only after adjusting the planchette and asking once more did the figure reply: \"This is correct. When observing, burn incense, compose your mind, and wait. If they appear, make your prayers and express your wishes—there will be other signs, which I will explain later. Tonight, during the third or fourth watch, you may try observing them, but do not let others know. If others are present during the observation, the stars will not appear.\"\n\nThe figure then said: \"I will now depart. Do not lightly reveal this to others. There are also scriptures in the world, but you have the karmic affinity to receive this oral transmission.\" Without a sound of the door opening, he lingered and then vanished.\n\nThe above account was received on the night of the twenty-seventh day. It was recorded in a large ledger, with white hemp paper joined together to fill the page.\n\nAccording to the *Separate Record*, this man from Zhongshan was surnamed Hong, named Zijuan. Originally from Mount Song, he had now come to Huayang, though his position was not made clear. Later, he also transmitted the *Cavern Chamber Sutra* orally from the Northern Lord. He was accustomed to instructing disciples. However, this person does not appear in the *True Reports*.\n\nThe method of observing the two stars of the Northern Dipper is found in the *Fangzhu Cavern Scripture*. Zhou had never before glimpsed the upper scriptures. His nature was cautious and upright, and he did not seek or request them. He regretted deeply that he could not obtain all the essential scriptures or meet the true instructions of Yang and Xu. Though he could no longer undertake this important task, he felt a deficiency in his devotion to his master.\n\nThese three entries were all from dreams, not entirely clear. In another dream, he saw towering cliffs and sheer walls, lush and verdant as if within a green cicada’s shell. Below the mountain, he looked up and saw two figures above: one wore a *yuanyou* cap and embroidered robes, and seemed to be the Lord of Life Preservation; the other sat high above, resembling Laozi, engaged in conversation with the first. Zhou could not understand their words. After a moment, he awoke, never knowing where the two had gone afterward.\n\nThe above was recorded from a dream during a daytime nap on the twenty-eighth day, written on two small sheets of white paper.\n\nUpon reviewing the records, those marked as \"dreams\" were visions seen during sleep, while entries stating \"on such-and-such a day, such-and-such an event was seen\" were witnessed while fully awake, though it was unclear whether he was seated or outside.\n\nFrom the eighth month of the *yǐwèi* year onward, he traveled to various places, but these were journeys of the spirit while his body remained still.\n\nIn many of the records, characters were hastily altered, likely due to the urgency of receiving the instructions and later recalling and revising them. Yang Jun had often done the same.\n\nThe above covers events from the twenty-third to the twenty-eighth day of the fifth month, comprising four entries, written on eight sheets of large and small white paper. All correspond to the catalog without omission.\n\n*Record of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen, Scroll One* concludes.\n\n[Note: The character \"弟\" appears to be superfluous. #2 The character \"其\" likely should be \"甚.\" The character \"浩\" likely should be \"拙.\"]\n\n*Record of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen, Scroll Two: Sixth Month Affairs*\n\nOn the first principle of transcription, matters that remain obscure shall be left unannotated for now. On the night of the first day of the sixth month, all these beginnings were inscribed on paper, each dated to the year *yiwei*.\n\nThe former assistant reappeared, now wearing a *jinxian* cap, still accompanied by seven attendants in white as before. The objects they held remained unchanged. He settled onto a mat, seated beneath the southern grove.\n\nTwo youths, both around fifteen or sixteen, appeared beside him. Their forms and garments were radiant, each wearing twin topknots. Their robes seemed single-layered, yet resembled embroidered silk without being so.\n\nThe assistant spoke:\n*\"The appointed day draws near—no cause for doubt.\"*\n\nPointing to the youth on the east, he said:\n*\"This is the Jade Youth of Huayang. The Lords of Fixed Record and Life Protection sent him to deliver their message.\"*\n\nThen, indicating the youth to the west:\n*\"This is the Attendant Youth of Ziyang. The two Lords visited Ziyang yesterday to recount the origins of your affairs. This is the source of it all.\"*\n\nZiyang then jested:\n*\"The great clan of Zhenxu harbors many whose aspirations soar like clouds—such principles are not confined to one.\"*\n\nThe Lord of Fixed Record replied:\n*\"This is merely what is seen on the surface.\"*\n\nZiyang laughed:\n*\"Should the Eastern Flower and Purple Tenuity burn their records?\"*\n\nThe assistant said:\n*\"I believe these words truly praise you.\"*\n\nThe Jade Youth of Huayang then spoke:\n*\"The talent to ride dragons and ascend the heavens is not meant for worldly use. The heart that schemes for glory—how could it harbor thoughts of divine transcendence? Your mind is free of stagnant thoughts, your breast unclouded; thus, your success is swift. Without this emptiness and clarity, one might pursue a single aim without attainment, advance without turning back—could such a one achieve the Dao? You possess no renowned talent or learning, nor the beauty of supreme virtue. Yet you seek the green hues of fate, and though burdened by minor transgressions, your heart remains unburdened—this is why you have succeeded. Do not cling to the mundane, linger among kin and acquaintances, or yearn for wealth and sensual pleasures. These are but mountains of accumulated sin, cauldrons that boil the self. Reflect deeply on these words; do not take them lightly as mere amusement. If you transcribe this faithfully, the Way of Immortality will be fulfilled.\"*\n\nSomeone then asked:\n*\"What of Tao’s talent and discernment?\"*\n\nThe reply came:\n*\"His virtue and conduct run deep—none in this world compare.\"*\n\nAnother asked:\n*\"Yet I fear his karmic conditions may not suffice—what then?\"*\n\nThe Ziyang Youth responded:\n*\"Your words echo those of Ziyang. The Way of Immortals is easily attained, but human virtue is difficult to perfect. Though the two paths diverge, their boundaries remain blurred. The true Dao may be heard but not seen; the human path may be seen but its practices are rarely heard. As for humanity, all are driven by greed, cruelty, deceit, and desire, indulging their passions without restraint. Thus, the Three Evils never leave their hearts, and the Five Passions remain unchecked in their bodies—all due to the weight of sins sown in past lives. If one is born in the Central Kingdom, aware of the Dao and virtue, with a complete human form, bright talent, and steadfast conduct, it is because of the blessings of past lives.\"*\n\nThe transmission of the Lord’s words seemed to end here.\n\n*\"In a past life, you were already born into the Zhou household, a descendant of the Lord. Now, reborn into the Zhou family again—though of humble origins—your past merits have not faded. Thus, you have been granted study in the Immortal Palace and entrusted with duties in the Divine Bureau. The Lord sighed yesterday, saying: ‘Since we parted, centuries have passed.’ His earnest words to you are now complete, and his counsel as your teacher is exhausted. Strive well, for our comings and goings will continue—this is no long farewell.\"*\n\nHe then added:\n*\"The Lord has already changed your name—it will be conveyed to you through others.\"*\n\nThe two youths then exited through the door.\n\nThe assistant said:\n*\"All these words were taught to them by the True Lord for this discussion. I cannot stay; I will return shortly.\"*\n\nHe descended from the mat and vanished.\n\nThis record, received on the first night of the month, was written on two small sheets of thin white paper. The assistant was still Zhao Cheng.\n\nThe *Later Record of the Huayang Youth* states his surname is Jing and his given name Benqi, while the *Ziyang Youth* is surnamed Feng and named Lingzhi. According to the earlier passage, \"your name has already been changed—it will be conveyed to you through others,\" and eight days later, they revealed the new names, which were still those of these youths. It seems they dared not speak of it at the time.\n\nOn the night of the fourth day of the sixth month, the Huayang Youth came and instructed:\n\n*\"Since you have shown resolve to align your thoughts with the divine, you must not harbor worldly desires or seek personal gain. If you fail to benefit others, displeasure will arise. In your service to others, if a superior reviles you as they might revile Jin, when you are reviled in turn, you must inwardly recall your body’s spirits—your ears may hear, but your heart must not receive it. Do not respond with words. If you are cursed as livestock or beasts, you must immediately bathe. Such words are grave defilements to the body; defilement prevents the descent of true spirits and allows evil qi to invade.*\n\n*In the past, Liu Wenchang studied under Li Shaolian. Shaolian was cruel and immoral, whipping and berating him without restraint. Wenchang endured it and responded verbally. After eleven years, mountain spirits tested him, and he later fell ill with demonic possession. Now, he serves as a messenger under the Life-Preserving Assistant. Because of the loyalty and sincerity in his past life, he was deemed fit for service by the true spirits. Shaolian remains by the river, toiling day and night, yet cannot be seen. Take heed of such matters—can you afford not to be cautious?\"*\n\nHaving spoken thus, he departed.\n\nThe above was a revelation received over four days and nights, recorded on a sheet of white mulberry paper.\n\nLast year, I heard from his family that his maternal aunt often practiced the ingestion of talismans, merely instructing him to transcribe them. Once he began to experience spiritual communion, he would miss the appointed times for writing talismans and was also careless in his work. His aunt reproached and scolded him severely, saying: \"Even a household dog must guard, bark, and chase rats. You, having been taken in, fail to provide proper service—merely transcribing talismans and copying texts without care. What use are you?\"\n\nAt the time, his expression was deeply troubled. Now, this admonition has come to pass, and its source lies therein. His aunt, considering him young and prone to serving others, feared his mistakes and thus reprimanded him frequently. Thereafter, whenever he was scolded, he would rejoice, smile, and immediately bathe, to the astonishment of all, young and old. Yet in the presence of his masters, he never once displayed resentment in word or countenance.\n\nNow, the cases of Wenchang and Shaolian serve as warnings. They are equal in the principle of being among the three [realms of existence].\n\nOn the night of the sixth day of the sixth month, a man appeared, his attire impeccable. He wore a cinnabar robe, a green cloak, and a lotus crown, upon which rested a small flat parasol, green with a purple border. On his back hung three green bells. He appeared to be in his twenties, his complexion fair, with a slight beard. Four attendants accompanied him—two men and two women.\n\nAfter a long while, he spoke: \"I am Deng Lingqi, the Immortal of Tongwu. Hearing that you are destined for the Dao, I have come to offer my regards.\"\n\nZili replied: \"I am but a lowly and unworthy man, with little affinity for the true Dharma. By fortunate circumstance, I dwell in this mountain abode, assigned to the character *ze* [泽]. How could I dare expect the gracious descent of a true sage? Overwhelmed by my own filth and unworthiness, I find no place to rest. If my past karma permits, I humbly beseech your guidance and deliverance.\"\n\nThe immortal said: \"Excellent words! Through a thousand lifetimes, you have cultivated abundant blessings. This meeting arises naturally—what need is there for formal instruction? Those who would deliver you will come of their own accord. I have come merely to praise your karmic virtue and to form a bond with you. Do not be overly modest.\"\n\n\"Others from Tongwu will come again. Receive them well. Now, I take my leave.\" In the latter part of the month, we shall meet again, for our paths align in leisurely wandering, and our thoughts remain intertwined.\n\nTaking his hand, he departed.\n\nThe above was a record of the revelation received on the night of the sixth day, transcribed on a sheet of green paper.\n\nFollowing the later separate record, Deng was first appointed as the Prime Minister of Tongwu, serving as the Imperial Canopy-Bearing Censor and overseeing Huayang, where he studied the arts of immortality and observed the prohibitions. This is not found in the *Zhen’gao*.\n\nThe statement \"Others from Tongwu will come again\" refers to Xu Xuanzhen, who would arrive later.\n\nOn the night of the eighth day of the sixth month, the Purple Yang Youth arrived, dressed as before. He asked, \"Do you wish to know my surname and given name?\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"I would be honored to hear them.\"\n\nThe youth said, \"My original surname is Wang, my given name Ziqian, and I am from Taiyuan. In a past life, my father was the Prefect of Chenliu, and we later moved to Danyang. I transformed at the age of fifteen. Due to the blessings of my former life, I was born as a human and, having further cultivated merit, died to become a spirit, serving as the Jade Youth of the Purple Yang Inner Palace. I was granted the surname Feng and the given name Yunzhi. Today, you shall change your name to Taixuan, with the style Xuling.\"\n\n(Whenever the youth referred to \"you,\" he meant Ziyang.)\n\n\"Do not change your surname; it shall remain Zhou. These names and styles carry profound meanings, which I shall briefly explain. *Tai* signifies the ultimate origin, its essence embodying truth. *Xuan* refers to the blackness of the void, a distinction bestowed by fate, not something attained through self-cultivation or merit. *Xu* denotes a form akin to the transient, a mind unburdened by trivial attachments, aligning with the true in desolation. *Ling* signifies one who, while in the world, communes with spirits and, upon leaving it, becomes a numinous being. This reflects the success of your inner and outer cultivation, which shall nourish your descendants. Such is a brief outline of its principles. There are deeper mysteries yet to be revealed, which cannot be disclosed now. Do not use this name in the world, nor reveal it to others.\n\nYour style, Yuansu, is a fine name for this life, though it is not meant for worldly use—it is only to be employed in the unseen realm.\"\n\nWith these words, he departed.\n\nThe above was a record of the revelation received on the night of the eighth day, transcribed on a sheet of white rattan paper.\n\nZiliang’s brothers all bore names with the character *zi*. Ziliang was given this name by his father at birth, with no other childhood name. The style *Yuanci* was bestowed upon him at the age of seventeen in the *gui-si* year, when he underwent the capping ceremony on the eastern ridge of Huayang. He received it after burning incense and making an offering to his teacher.\n\nAccording to the later record, the name he was given corresponds to the jade script of the Azure Register, and his Zhou surname was retained for this purpose.\n\nOn the night of the ninth day of the sixth month, Ziliang dreamed he heard a voice, though no figure was visible. The voice was lofty and stern, saying, \"If you don the purple mantle and wander leisurely in secluded chambers, this is the beginning of the path to immortality.\" These were the only words spoken, but their intent suggested they came from a spirit of the Definite Register, a hidden message for him.\n\nAwakening suddenly, he saw the former Attendant. The Attendant asked, \"Did you recognize the one who just spoke?\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"I did not.\"\n\nThe Attendant said, \"It was a Perfected One. It is not yet time for you to see him, so he spoke to you from afar.\"\n\n(Previously in Huayang, only the Attendant and the youth had come, and neither of these two lords had descended. This hidden message marked the beginning of such visitations.)\n\nThe Attendant then asked, \"Did you smell the scent of blood?\"\n\nZiliang answered, \"I did not.\"\n\nThe Attendant said, \"Your body flows with blood, yet you remain unaware. You claim to have no blood, only sweat.\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"I thought it was merely sweat.\"\n\nThe Attendant said, \"What difference is there between sweat and blood? Sweat is the essence of blood. Human blood is like water—cold, it congeals; in summer, it clarifies. When clear, it flows; when easily congealed, it bursts forth like ice, and blood appears. Your reservoirs are shallow and weak, so the flow cannot be stopped. Human blood is like deep water: it is not troubled by excess, only by depletion. I possess the art of fortifying the reservoirs. I shall treat you. For now, await the embrace of the radiant blossom, which will bring subtle improvement.\"\n\n\"I shall take my leave now, for someone else has arrived.\"\n\nHe descended from his seat and vanished.\n\nImmediately, a man entered, accompanied by three attendants. Approaching Ziliang, he said, \"I am Zhang Xiao, styled Zian, from Li Jing in Rongyang.\" With these words, he disappeared. He appeared to be around thirty, wearing a purple square cap and embroidered robes, likely a lofty immortal.\n\nThe above was a record of the dream and revelation received on the night of the ninth day, transcribed on a sheet of white rattan paper.\n\nAccording to the separate record, Zhang Zian was the master of the Xiaoxian Hall in Huayang, a detail not found in the *Zhen’gao*.\n\nOn the night of the eleventh day of the sixth month, a woman arrived. She emerged from the ridge, her appearance graceful and lovely, with a large topknot and a flowing cyan robe. She said, \"Tonight, four individuals from the Yi-Qian realm intended to visit your dwelling, but since I am already here, they will not come. They shall arrive on the nineteenth day instead.\"\n\nZiliang said, \"I was accompanying my teacher here and did not know there would be a visitation tonight. If I return to my dwelling to await them, would that be acceptable?\"\n\nThe woman replied, \"Since you are already here and it is late, there is no need to return, lest others grow suspicious. You need not mention that I came here tonight.\"\n\nZiliang asked, \"May I know your surname and given name?\"\n\nThe woman said, \"My surname is Li, my given name Feihua. I am from Huaiyin and have been in the Yi-Qian realm for ninety-four years. Though I began my studies long ago, I have not yet attained advancement. I have come tonight at the behest of Lady Zhao.\"\n\nShe then took her leave, saying, \"I shall meet you on the nineteenth day at the Western Slope.\"\n\nZiliang bowed and parted from her.\n\nThe woman appeared to be around twenty-three or twenty-four, and two others accompanied her, though only she spoke. One was likely her attendant.\n\nThe above was a record of the revelation received on the night of the eleventh day, transcribed on a sheet of white rattan paper.\n\nOn this day, the teacher left Bingwan and ascended the mountain. He returned to the eastern ridge after sunset. Zhou Xun entered Ziliang’s dwelling at dusk and stayed the night. At that time, within the ice-mouth chamber near the ridge, the divine maidens did not gather. The western inspection revealed disorder, and those who sought to follow him did not grasp this principle, mistaking it for mere sensual indulgence.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the sixth month, five individuals arrived around the third watch.\n\nOne appeared to be around thirty, wearing a yellow-flowered crown and a cloud-brocade feathered robe. Four attendants accompanied him, bearing purple-feathered staffs and holding flowing-gold bells—this was Perfected Master Feng, as recorded in the *Declarations of the Perfected*. Another wore a lotus crown and a crimson embroidered robe, with two attendants who carried nothing—this was Zhang Zian. A third had a black lotus crown and a green embroidered robe, with two attendants—this was Master Hong of Zhongshan. Another was clad in a vermilion robe with a purple-grass sash, accompanied by six attendants all in official garb, each bearing something—this was Registrar Le. The last had twin topknots and an embroidered robe—this was the Youth of Huayang.\n\nOf the five, the first three sat in a row facing south, while the Registrar and the Youth sat to the side recording. The Registrar stepped forward and said, \"This evening, exalted perfected ones have arrived. Rise, rise!\" Ziliang then rose and bowed to those before him. They replied, \"Be seated, Ziliang.\" Then they asked, \"Zhou has cultivated merit and accumulated virtue—can this be said to fulfill his aspirations?\" Master Zhang said, \"The bright mirror of discernment should rightly illuminate his heart.\" They answered, \"So it is.\" Master Hong asked, \"Has Zhou not shown joy in his progress along the Way?\" (The character *yifa* should be *xifei*.) They replied, \"Though he may not rejoice, even if he did, it could not mar his golden tally.\" The Registrar said, \"Zhou may indeed be called one who preserves the immortal’s path.\"\n\nThen they asked Ziliang, \"Today, with all these present, have you fully expressed your heart?\" Ziliang answered, \"To be so graced by the descent of the exalted perfected into this humble place fills me with both joy and trepidation—I know not how to compose myself.\" They smiled but said nothing. The Youth of Huayang then said, \"You may not recognize all these perfected ones, so I shall introduce them. The first is Perfected Master Feng of Mount Song, the second is Immortal Minister Zhang of Leisure, the third is Immortal Master Hong of the Central Marchmount, the fourth is Registrar Le of the Bureau of Life-Preservation, and the fifth is I, the Jade Youth of the Celestial Minister of Agriculture of Huayang. Thus, I make their names and ranks known to you. Among them, any position here is as esteemed as a palace attendant or minister in the mortal world.\" Ziliang replied, \"How could the lofty and numinous perfected ones be compared to worldly mortals?\" The Registrar said, \"*Youce* should be written as *yuce*. The obscure one here is Zhou.\" Then he added, \"Now that the perfected have deigned to descend, each should compose a verse.\"\n\nThe perfected ones said, \"You are the clear witness—proceed first.\" Ziliang answered, \"I dare not disobey, but I fear it would be improper for one as lowly as I to go first.\" The Registrar then instructed Ziliang to fold paper and moisten his brush, dictating:\n\n*\"The radiant splendor illumines the jade grove,\nA pure wind scatters the purple clouds.\nGazing up, I behold the perfected ones,\nRiding the void through the green dawn.\nThey descend from the vermilion-mist pavilion,\nTo visit this companion in the dust.\nThere is a natural meeting of the Way,\nNo need for the heart to strain.\"*\n\nPerfected Master Feng then recited:\n\n*\"The great aurora swells beneath the purple canopy,\nA scene wind stirs the feathered wheels.\nStraight to the ford of dust I descend,\nMyriad impurities drench this body.\nWere he not a child who preserves the Way,\nHow could one meet such a man today?\nBeyond this, before the year’s end,\nI shall ride the light to the court of the Great Perfected.\nThough karmic ties may be bound,\nVirtue must be steadfastly cultivated.\"*\n\nImmortal Minister Zhang recited:\n\n*\"I inscribe my hall of leisure,\nWandering where the dust’s clamor reaches.\nI gallop through the flying clouds,\nSeeking this bond among mortals.\nHow wondrous is Zhou—\nAble to move the hearts of the mysterious ones.\nLet not your soaring aspirations wither,\nLest they break beneath the frost’s severity.\"*\n\nMaster Hong recited:\n\n*\"A numinous wind fans the purple mist,\nA radiant cloud scatters cinnabar light.\nThe Eight Simplicities are not distant,\nThe Nine Abysses are not so towering.\nThough aspirations and deeds may... (one character missing)\nCultivation may yet refine them.\nExhort yourself in this present task,\nFor the golden gates shall be our shared return.\"*\n\nThe Youth of Huayang recited:\n\n*\"The suspended terrace pierces the purple Han,\nThe steep steps ascend the crimson clouds.\nThe radiant splendor flies like a torch,\nThe Seven Luminaries each in their course.\nI inscribe this passage through the dust’s filth,\nTo reach that transcendent lord.\nExhort yourself within these two years,\nLet not the gates of the profane age prevail.\nWhen the time comes for our meeting,\nWhy trouble with lengthy words?\"*\n\nWhen the poems were finished, Perfected Master Feng said, \"What each has composed is sufficient for mutual exhortation and admonition. Reflect on the turning of the green destiny and strive to refine your single-minded devotion.\" (*Yundan* should be *lidan*.) He continued, \"There will be others who come. If one can contemplate deeply and enter the subtle, ride the dragon’s chariot upon the misty path, and sound the phoenix’s call along the clouded thoroughfare, with divine youths unfurling their banners and jade maidens attending his carriage—why wait for endless kalpas? Attaining the Dao lies entirely within the square inch of the heart; there is no need for bodily toil or spiritual depletion.\n\nYet mortals only know of consuming elixirs and swallowing talismans, clinging to what is not their lot—such efforts are in vain. They do not devote themselves to accumulating merit and virtue. Though the Dao may be discussed when merits are fulfilled, it is only attained by later generations, not in this present life. These words may also be shared with your family. Now you know.\"\n\nZiliang respectfully assented and complied.\n\nZhang said, \"These words of the Perfected Lord may be called the ultimate teaching. If one could further transcend and surpass this, then even the two celestial bureaus would find it rare and difficult.\"\n\nWould the Leisurely Hall become Master Zhou’s place of wandering?\n\nMaster Hong said, \"If benevolent merits are accumulated, might one be selected as a minor attendant in the Court of the Perfected? Yet this may not be the limit.\"\n\nThe Attendant said, \"Once merits are fixed, why must one be so diligent?\"\n\nThe Youth said, \"What the two of you speak of is also what others do—there is no need to press one another. If one can accumulate deeper karmic merit, then one may achieve the work of a Perfected. Even if one rests, one will still not lose this.\"\n\nWhen the Attendant finished speaking, they bade farewell together, lingering at the doorway before vanishing.\n\nThe above passage was received as a record on the twelfth day, written on four sheets of white paper. Among these jade-like beings, three have already come: Perfected Feng, Attendant Le, and now descending. According to the *Declarations of the Perfected*, there is a Perfected of the Western Peak, Feng Yanshou—this is likely the same. Attendant Le, styled Changzhi, was a native of Chengyang and oversaw disasters as one of the Four Attendants. The poetic compositions of the immortals and Perfected, in their talent and diction, are all quite similar; the *Declarations of the Perfected* contains many such examples, none surpassing the others. Examining the meaning of the words received in this descent, it seems to vaguely hint at the elevation to the Eastern Florescence’s Protector of Dawn.\n\nOn the night of the thirteenth day of the sixth month in the *yiwei* year, the former commander came and said, \"Recently, the wandering descent of the Perfected Immortals must have brought you great joy. I have been constantly occupied, thus becoming estranged. How have you been?\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"Of late, heaven and earth have been clear and serene, the Seven Luminaries all bright. I have been fortunate to receive the descent of lofty spirits several times, yet my impurities and filth make me unworthy to bear it.\"\n\nThe commander said, \"This is the merit of your thousand autumns. Do not lament your impurities and filth. However, during the time your sixth-generation ancestor, Zhou Mei, served as governor of Qiao Commandery, he was particularly fond of hunting, killing and wounding countless beings. Fortunately, he occasionally cultivated merit and virtue, so his sins have already been absolved. You ought not to eat meat again, for doing so may provoke retribution from your ancestral source. Take heed. The herbs of the immortals are sufficient—why rush to consume this? Fearing you might not understand, I took this opportunity to come and inform you.\"\n\nZiliang respectfully received the instruction, and the commander departed.\n\nThe above passage was received as a record on the thirteenth day, written on a small sheet of green paper. The genealogy of the Zhou family of Runan has not been consulted, so it is unclear during which emperor’s reign of the Jin dynasty Zhou Mei served as governor of Qiao. The fault of slaughter is truly grave, yet since he himself was absolved, one now fears the calamity may extend to his descendants, making it difficult to resolve. One should also establish good merit, so that one’s own blessings may flow to one’s descendants. This commander had one attendant, whom I have not yet met.\n\nOn the night of the fifteenth day after the departure of the man from Mount Zhong, according to a separate record, on the fifteenth day of the sixth month, Master Hong of Mount Song bestowed the *Scripture of the Grotto Chamber*, and so forth. Upon examining the case, however, this transmission was not found. Perhaps it was due to the secrecy and solemnity of the cultivation practice that it was not inscribed on the document’s edge, or it may have been stored elsewhere. This likely pertains to the external *Dou* method, its affairs intersecting with the previous two stars, which explains its continuity.\n\nMaster Hong, who bestowed it, was heard to reside in Western Xian. Later, when he moved to Zhu Yang, he slept in a grove where no evil person could approach him, and he seldom mingled with others. At dusk, he would always retire outside the grove—this must be the method of sleeping in alignment with the *Dou* in cultivation. This method belongs to the middle-grade scriptures of the *Shangqing* tradition, not the teachings of lesser immortals.\n\nAnother person arrived, youthful and resplendent, dressed in white, and conveyed a message from Commander Fan: \"I previously warned you about consuming meat—have you still not ceased? Why did you go to another’s place this morning to eat dried meat? From now on, do not repeat this.\" He urged Ziliang to heed the earlier admonition and fulfill today’s expectations.\n\nZiliang replied: \"This morning, I went to my master’s abode, where he offered me food, claiming it was sweet fruit. I did not suspect deceit. Moreover, having received this command, how would I dare approach meat again?\" The visitor departed after this exchange.\n\nThe above is a record received on the fifteenth day. Written on a single sheet of white rattan paper, its quality closely resembles that of Master Yang’s hand. On the morning of the fourteenth day, Ziliang had already informed his aunt that he could not eat meat. That evening, upon entering the mountain pass, he again heard the same admonition as Commander Fan’s, and he immediately assented. On the morning of the fifteenth day, he entered once more and proceeded to inquire of Pan Yuanwen. Pan performed a ritual with him and urged him to focus his resolve, after which this message was received at night. On the morning of the sixteenth day, he again encountered the earlier admonition. From then on, he completely abstained from evil.\n\nIn his response, he later explained: \"What the master bestowed was merely expedient teaching to ease reproach.\" From the tenth month of last year until the third month of this year, he had strictly adhered to a vegetable diet, but the hardship left him emaciated. His aunt then advised him to gradually reintroduce food, and he had only just begun to do so when he again committed this transgression. Not only was he constrained by the impending calamity from past misdeeds, but his indulgence also violated the nurturing *qi* of living beings, which those with benevolent hearts must sever to cultivate their nature. Thus, the immortals and sages make it their essence to abstain entirely.\n\nOn the nineteenth day of the sixth month, five women arrived—these were the ones Li Feihua had mentioned on the eleventh night in the mountain pass, scheduled to meet at the Western Bank on the nineteenth. The first was Yi Qian’s disciple, the Immortal Consort Lady Zhao, styled Sutai, aged around thirty, clad in embroidered robes. She is recorded in the *True Records*. The second was Yi Qian’s left concubine, Lady Wang, who had changed her style name to Taiying, aged around twenty, dressed in purple. The *True Records* mention a Wang Jinxian; this may be her under a new name. The third was Yi Qian’s right concubine, Lady Liu, styled Xuanwei, aged around twenty, dressed in green. The *True Records* mention a Liu Chunlong, but this is not the same person—unless she had changed her name a hundred times, which seems unlikely. The fourth was Yi Qian’s Director of Studies, Lady Tao, who had changed her style name to Zhi’an, aged around forty, wearing a robe of green above and purple below, with tadpole-script embroidery—likely the same as Xu Yuanmu. The fifth was Yi Qian’s disciple, Li Feihua, aged around twenty, who had come before, dressed in green above and jade-green below. The *True Records* do not mention her.\n\nThe names, titles, and Li Feihua’s account of these five women were all as described. When the conversation ended, the four sat together, while Li remained standing. There were also eight attendant maidens: one carried a towel case, on which was an inscription; two wore large talismans at their waists, each about a foot square, inscribed in black on blue-green silk. Another held a case, covering it with its lid as she carried it, within which was a pouch bearing a yellow inscription—likely containing scriptures. Four others each held an ivory tablet, their characters so fine as to be unreadable. All were dressed in figured silk robes with purple and crimson sashes.\n\nThe immortals conversed among themselves for some time, seemingly discussing Ziliang’s affairs, though their meaning was not entirely clear. Lady Zhao then addressed him: \"Your dark affinity has long been evident, enabling you to summon and receive the aid of true immortals with joy.\" Ziliang replied: \"Though unworthy and common, I have from youth followed the registers of the Dao, fortunate enough to dwell in forests and valleys. How could I have anticipated that true immortals would descend in response? My heart is filled with both joy and fear, leaving me unable to find peace. If my past causes may be considered, I humbly request the essential secrets of immortality to achieve accomplishment.\"\n\nLady Zhao said: \"Your name is inscribed on the purple tablets—why do you fear you will not become an immortal, and seek this from me? I am but an immortal myself.\" Lady Liu said: \"Zhou, do you know from whence your accumulated deeds and planted causes have brought you to this day?\" Ziliang replied: \"I am but a speck of dust in the mortal world—how could I fathom such matters?\" Lady Liu said: \"I will briefly explain. When you were born in the household of Zhou Kui, you were already destined for the Dao, but your greed and impurity were too great, so you did not attain it. In your next life, born into the household of Liu Wei, you gained the fortune of diligently studying the Dao, which has carried over to your present existence. You have been recorded in the registers of the highest immortals three times, but on occasion, you violated the proper methods and fell away. This meeting has been recorded above for over seventy years, which is why you have endured cycles of life and death. I have consulted the Recorder of Records regarding this matter, and he informed me thus, so I now reveal it to you, that you may know the source of your circumstances.\"\n\nLady Wang said: \"Lady Liu’s words have thoroughly explained the hidden and manifest aspects of your past lives. You should keep this knowledge in your heart and not reveal it to the careless common folk.\" Lady Tao said: \"Zhou, you were born on the nineteenth day of the *dingchou* year, a person of the Water destiny.\" She then asked Lady Zhao: \"To whom does this one compare?\" Lady Zhao replied: \"There is no fixed comparison.\"\n\nLord Zongzhen of the Perfected was born in a *dingchou* year, a person of the Water destiny, and holds the rank of High Perfected. Zhang Suan, also born in a *dingchou* year, has sunk into the Three Bureaus. This is not a fixed fate, but depends solely on one’s merits and deeds.\n\nLady Tao said: \"Truly as Lady Liu has told you, and as I have told Ziliang: Though the divine immortals’ responsiveness to profound mysteries is swift and effortless, mortal sentiments are too insubstantial and faint to summon such resonance. Those of us who come here today seek only those with the Dao—we do not wander aimlessly without purpose. Take care that others do not learn of this. Even if they do, it may not be so, for such matters might breed doubt and reproach, turning your heart away. I bear no ill will toward them, but fear they may bring retribution upon themselves.\"\n\nZiliang said: \"Having received the descent of the divine, how could I dare to doubt? I wished only to present this to my teacher’s wife from time to time, not to reveal it to the careless common folk.\" He added: \"Nor should you tell those of the *jia* or *yi* ranks.\"\n\nLady Zhao further explained: \"The Dao of immortals holds subtle and hidden delights. Now, let me roughly describe them. Those who attain the rank of True Immortal repose in the Mystic Palace, roam the Purple Han, their movements unfolding the twin radiance of sun and moon, their stillness calming the winds and clouds. Clad in kingfisher plumes and flying robes, they ride upon maple chariots and divine pines. They traverse seas and cross mountains, wandering the eight directions. Advancing, they suffer no peril of water or fire; retreating, they bear no burden of wood or stone. Is this not worthy of being called noble and exalted? Yet people see only the glory of carriages and caps, the pleasures of the inner chambers, and deem these the ultimate. This is precisely why the True Dao does not mingle with the world, and why divine immortals seldom wander among men. Even those who know of it cannot fully cultivate it—some cultivate but do not persist, others persist but do not refine their practice. Such matters are truly lamentable. Zhou, do not follow the path of the common herd.\"\n\nLady Wang said: \"One whose will is single-minded, who proceeds without turning back, whose thoughts are unburdened by attachments, and whose heart is free and unencumbered—this is a disciple who preserves the worthy. If one delves into the hidden and probes the distant, seeking teachers and friends, toiling day and night for years on end; or if one sits alone in the mountains, practicing scriptures and methods, swallowing talismans and absorbing radiance, dwelling in the Seven Primes—all may attain the Dao. Yet none compare to the swiftness of accumulating merit and perfecting deeds. You may convey this to the younger generation, urging them to diligence. If they persist without cease, they need not fear for their future, nor will they waste their own efforts or trouble others with their concerns.\"\n\nLady Tao said: \"If one can guard the Dao without wavering, practice *qi*-absorption and radiance-swallowing to stabilize the five viscera, one may attain earthly immortality and live forever. Without the Golden Elixir or the Five Mushrooms, however, one cannot soar through the Great Ultimate or move without constraint. I am still but a middling immortal, not yet among the High Perfected or Lesser Realized. I too once practiced *qi*-absorption and other arts, and thus have reached my present state. Zhou, will you strive for this?\"\n\nTheir words grew more detailed as the fourth watch approached. Lady Zhao said: \"The stars have grown sparse; dawn is near. We should depart, and all of you should leave as well.\" She added: \"This parting is not a long farewell.\"\n\nLady Wang said: \"When Lady Zhao comes, she will not fail to accompany us.\"\n\nLady Liu said: \"On the third day of next month, I shall go to the Eastern Flower, present the Learning Register, and visit Lady Tao.\" Ziliang asked: \"What is the Learning Register?\" She replied: \"It is the register of immortals’ progress in the teachings of *Yiqian*, recording their advances and setbacks. Every two months, on the third day, it is presented to the Great Director of Destinies of the Eastern Flower. The second month is the most important; it is presented again in the ninth month. This cycle repeats endlessly.\"\n\nLady Tao said: \"Let us part for ten days or so.\"\n\nLi said: \"Regarding your activities, Lady Zhao will send messengers to and fro. There is no need for formal farewells.\"\n\nThen they all descended into the grove and vanished, the attendants following in order. This record was received on the night of the nineteenth and written on six small sheets of green-striped paper.\n\nThe teachings of these ladies contained no fixed doctrine, not limited to Zhou alone but serving as a general admonition to cultivators. They clarified the meaning of wisdom and merit, showing that their virtue surpassed mere specialized practice. Observing their discourse, one may glimpse the principles therein.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-first day of the sixth month, I dreamed of a man around thirty years old, dressed in a plain white cloth robe with a black tablet in hand. His bearing was refined and dignified, inspiring respect. He identified himself as an emissary of Vice-Minister Zhao and said: \"Yesterday, I had words with Tao Yinju. There are matters requiring attention to the lord’s concerns and the people’s welfare, so I have come only now. Recently, petitions have arrived from many places, but none have been answered except Tao’s. Since your meritorious deeds have come full circle, I have come here to verify the virtue of you both. Do not be overly modest, lest expectations be dampened. Thus, I have come to report.\"\n\nLord Ziliang said: \"Of late, the wind and sun have blazed fiercely, the ponds and lakes run dry, the five grains wither, grasses and trees fade and fall. Fearing famine and want, I have ventured to submit this petition, hoping for a drop of moisture to bestow.\"\n\nThe man replied: \"You need not fear the absence of rain—only that it may not come in torrents.\"\n\n\"The words of the previous petition were fine, but requests for rain should be written in ink, and requests for clear skies in vermilion, both on blue paper. The gods value cinnabar and ink, yet do not realize that cinnabar and ink have their limits. Such cases are not uncommon in the world, yet no one has ever explained this intent. Since the petitioners themselves remain unaware, they instead claim the gods lack efficacy. I urge you to compose another petition in ink, and avoid repeating the former words.\"\n\nLord Ziliang answered: \"I shall follow your essential instructions.\"\n\nHe then asked: \"May I know the sacred spirit’s surname?\"\n\nThe man replied: \"Are you asking me, the subordinate official?\"\n\nWhen Lord Ziliang assented, he said: \"The surname is Huang, the given name Yuanping. He is from Donghai, and still serves as an attendant among the life-preserving officials under Vice-Minister Zhao, holding no formal rank.\"\n\nHe added: \"I cannot linger long; perhaps I shall return again.\" With that, he clasped his hands and departed.\n\nThe above entry, received in a vision on the night of the twenty-first, was inscribed on a sheet of white hemp paper.\n\nThat summer, a drought had persisted for weeks without rain. The various Daoist masters had repeatedly submitted memorials, yet no clouds gathered. The Recluse and Zhou jointly composed a petition, following the usual practice of writing in cinnabar on blue-green paper. On the twentieth day, the sky cleared, and that night, together with Zhou, they presented the petition in meditation. Thus, on the night of the twenty-first, this dream was received.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-second, Zhou composed a petition in ink in response and submitted it himself at the court altar. On the morning of the twenty-third, Zhou told his family: \"Last night, someone reported that it would rain at midday today.\" That morning, the sky was clear and scorching, with no sign of rain. By midday, Zhou entered the mountain pass and, upon reaching the summit, saw wind and clouds suddenly rise from the east. Before he could reach the Recluse, he was met on the road by a downpour that soaked the ground, though it fell only on the mountain where he had just passed.\n\nThis matter was later widely recounted, though some merely noted the dream without confirming whether it was truly a dream or reality.\n\nHua Yang Recluse, Daoist Zhou Ziliang, humbly observes: The mandate of the lower realm depends on grain as its foundation, and farming relies on moisture. For weeks now, drought has parched the seedlings, and the cries of distress echo far and near as all gaze upon the heavens in despair. Though the people have prayed ceaselessly, no response has descended. We have heard that the office responsible for water and rain exists, and we beseech its compassion for the common folk, that it may swiftly send down moisture. Let it summon wind and call forth clouds, gathering them from every direction, so that floods may overflow the rivers and all—whether on land or water—may be saved. Then shall the ode of the white crane be revived in our time. With utmost sincerity, we submit this petition, modeled on past examples.\n\n*Tianjian 14th year, cyclical year yiwei, sixth month, twenty-first day.* The petition is presented before Zhang Li, Keeper of the Golden Altar Grotto-Heaven of Juqu Hua Yang, and Vice-Minister Zhao of the Prohibitions.\n\nThis was the former petition written in cinnabar. The Recluse later drafted Zhou’s petition, and upon reviewing it, transcribed it anew. The wooden tablet Zhou had altered was later sought but not found.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, during the afternoon, in the southern woods, the Recluse dreamed of a man of about sixty years, wearing a fluttering wind crown and a purple robe lined with fur. He held a jade bell in hand and bore a great talisman at his waist, inscribed in cinnabar on yellow silk—not in brushstrokes, but woven into the fabric. He had never appeared before. Two attendants accompanied him, both clad in crimson.\n\nThey invited him to take a seat, whereupon he spoke: \"The excellence of Dexiu has moved the unseen realms. I have long wished to come, but was hindered by various duties, and so did not immediately fulfill my intent. Master Deng had previously also spoken of my coming.\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"The Immortal Deng fully described how the divine spirits deigned to descend, and I have constantly purified my heart and thoughts, reverently awaiting the arrival of the true immortals.\"\n\nThe visitor smiled and said: \"Deng will soon come as well.\" After a long pause, he sighed in sorrow and said: \"In the past, I wandered alone in reclusion, and no worthy surpassed me. I once studied the Dao on Mount Song, accumulating over eighty years, until I was granted divine lingzhi. Consuming it, I transformed. Though I attained the divine and ascended the immortal ranks, my bodily form had no resting place, and to this day it remains in the southern stone chamber of Mount Song. Gazing upon it, I am filled with longing, and my heart cannot let go. You need not worry about this matter. People say that those who attain the Dao no longer think of their form, yet my longing for my form is so intense it tears at my liver and heart. Can I truly be without a coffin?\"\n\n\"Now I am the master of the Paulownia-Wu Golden Court and Jasper Palace, leading the immortals of Cangwu and presiding within the Crimson Terrace. My surname is Xu, and my style is Xuanzhen. Thus I let you know that my name and style remain—soon I shall come with Master Deng, and we will speak further in detail. It is not a distant parting.\"\n\nWith that, he vanished from sight. After a moment, two men appeared in another dream—those sent by Vice-Minister Zhao, Huang Yuanping among them. They said: \"We regret that yesterday’s rain did not last longer; next month we shall do more. Yesterday, we went to Mount Tai and saw your esteemed father escorting someone at dusk. Only then was your name removed from the register of the dead and your name of life recorded anew, along with five others. Your esteemed father said he would return to the Northern Palace, and if you were to visit Ziliang, you should tell him of my coming here, which is why I have come to announce it.\"\n\nWith these words, they departed.\n\nThis account was received in a dream during the afternoon nap on the twenty-fourth day and recorded on two sheets of blue paper.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nAccording to Deng, he arrived on the sixth day of this month. Xu and Deng were together at Tongwu, which is why they referred to each other. On the twenty-ninth day, they came again. As Xu said, though one may attain transformation, the transformed still cling to their bodily forms—how much more so for those among the remaining spirits and ghosts? The matter of the coffin and outer coffin cannot be dispensed with.\n\nThis Xu Jun—*Zhenzhuo* records nothing of his origins, nor does it state where or when he attained the Dao. He said that Zhou’s father had returned to the Northern Palace, which means he was under the command of Deng’s capital office. In the fifth month, Vice-Minister Zhao said that next spring he would be reborn into the Wang family; now he has already departed, and once rebirth is received, all former ties are severed.\n\nFurthermore, recalling what Madam Liu had previously said: \"Your name has been on the register of immortals for over seventy years,\" yet now it is only said that Mount Tai has just removed your name from the register of the dead and recorded your name of life. From this, it appears that the ledgers of immortals and the rolls of ghosts each have their own records. Though the immortal ledger may list one’s name, if the ghostly roll is not expunged, the matter remains unsettled. Only when the name on the immortal register is confirmed and the ghostly roll is likewise corrected—so that both names are properly aligned—does one escape demotion or expulsion back to the mortal realm, or conscription into ghostly service. If so, then Zhou’s transformation today ensures his rank is eternally secured.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month in the *yimao* year, two men arrived at Tongwu. One was Xu Xuanzhen, Master of the Jinting Palace at Tongxiang, an immortal of Cangwu, dressed as before and holding a jade bell, accompanied by two attendants—*Zhen Gao* makes no mention of this. The other was Deng Lingqi, an immortal of Tongwu, also dressed as before but holding only a jade bell, likewise attended by two—*Zhen Gao* omits this as well.\n\nDeng spoke first: \"I have long wished to visit you, but this has hindered me. On the twenty-seventh, I received an imperial decree appointing me as *Dichen*, Umbrella-Bearing Censor, to govern the Southern Green Lodge at the foot of Tongwu Mountain, and to oversee the study of immortality in Huayang, as well as the affairs of the Four Palaces. This is why I have been delayed. Xu Jun’s earlier visit allowed for some pleasant exchange.\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"I am deeply honored by Xu Jun’s gracious regard, and my joy knows no bounds. To receive your descent now brings a happiness beyond measure.\"\n\nXu Jun said: \"Earlier, I passed by Mao Dinglu’s place, where he had just been granted *The Scripture of the Mysterious True One*. I was greatly pleased to hear it.\"\n\nZiliang answered: \"I am unworthy of such divine favor and the transmission of true teachings. As a dull mortal, my cultivation has been lax and inconsistent.\"\n\nXu then said: \"I have heard that your name has entered the green bamboo slips of the Eastern Palace. I shall verify this matter and, before long, will go with Deng to investigate it.\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"To be granted such an inquiry is indeed my greatest hope.\"\n\nXu then pointed to Deng and said: \"This gentleman has studied the Dao for several hundred years and has only now attained his position. You have obtained it while still seated upon the earth—this shows that long-standing effort has borne fruit.\"\n\nDeng smiled and said: \"As for Zhou’s karmic affinity, it was indeed as Marquis Han described. May I speak of it?\"\n\nXu said: \"Though Zhou bears the karmic affinity of an immortal, he has not yet come to know the matters of his past lives.\"\n\nZiliang then asked: \"How could one as base and worldly as I comprehend such things? Who is this Marquis Han?\"\n\nDeng replied: \"He is Han Huiqi, the Immortal Marquis of Donghua, who oversees the registers of the Eastern Palace and governs the Eighth Mysterious Palace of Fangzhang. When I spoke earlier of verifying your affairs, it is to him we must go.\"\n\nXu said: \"Today is rushed, and I cannot stay long. Before long, Deng and I shall come together again—it will not be a distant parting.\"\n\nThey rose from their seats, exited the door together, and vanished as their attendants followed. The attendants disappeared as well.\n\nThis account was received in a dream on the evening of the twenty-ninth and recorded on one large sheet of white hemp paper.\n\nAccording to Xu Xuan’s *Dinglu*, in the separate index of *The Scripture of the Mysterious True One*, it states: \"On the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, by decree of the Lord of Xuan Dinglu of Huayang, *The Hidden Book of the Grand Empyrean* and *The Inner Secrets of the Mysterious True One* were conferred,\" and so on. Yet this matter is not found in the present letter, likely because it was sealed separately with others in the same chamber.\n\nAs for the immortals of Tongwu, they should not be connected to one another. Since Deng oversees the immortal prohibitions of the Four Palaces of Huayang, he is permitted to travel among them. These would be, for men, Tong Chu and Xiao Xian, and for women, Yi Qian and Han Zhen. The matter of verifying the registers will be addressed in the seventh month.\n\nFrom the first to the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, there are thirteen entries in all, recorded on twenty-three sheets of blue and white paper, large and small. Of the two entries concerning the *Cavern Chamber* and *Mysterious True One* in the catalog, only these are missing; the rest are complete.\n\n*Records of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen, Scroll Two* ends here.\n*Records of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen, Scroll Three* begins.\n\nSeventh Month Matters—All entries are transcribed as they occurred, with hidden details now annotated in red by Zhu.\n\nIn the year *yiwei*, on the second night of the seventh month, seven persons arrived.\n\nOne surnamed Zhou wore a *Xuanhua* crown and a green feathered robe with a *Danxiao* flying garment, bearing golden bells. He appeared to be around fifty years of age. As recorded in the *Zhen’gao*, he had four attendants holding yellow-feathered staffs.\n\nOne surnamed Wang was dressed similarly to Zhou, but with a purple feathered robe and golden bells. He appeared to be around forty. The *Zhen’gao* notes he had four attendants holding green-feathered staffs.\n\nOne surnamed Mao wore a *Yuanyou* crown, a black feathered robe, and a purple brocade garment, bearing golden bells. He appeared to be around sixty. The *Zhen’gao* records he had three attendants holding black-feathered staffs, one of whom carried a white ivory box.\n\nAnother surnamed Mao wore a *Furong* crown, a red feathered robe, and a black embroidered garment, bearing jade bells. He appeared to be around sixty or older. The *Zhen’gao* notes he had two attendants, who carried nothing.\n\nOne surnamed Zhou wore a *Huagai* crown and a cloud-brocade garment, bearing jade bells. He was in his forties. The *Zhen’gao* states his name was Taibin, with five attendants holding purple-feathered staffs.\n\nOne surnamed Sima wore a *Furong* crown, a plain feathered robe, and a purple brocade garment, bearing jade bells. He appeared to be around forty. The *Zhen’gao* records he had two attendants holding blue-feathered staffs.\n\nThe last was the Minister of Music, dressed as before, with five attendants. The *Zhen’gao* confirms this; their attire was previously described, and the *Zhen’gao* commands recognition of it.\n\nThe Minister said: \"Now that the Perfected Ones have arrived, why do you not bow?\"\nZiliang immediately rose and bowed twice, kowtowing and knocking his head to the ground, entreating the secrets of immortality.\n\nLord Mao, Registrar of Destinies, said: \"Your merit and fame are already manifest; do not trouble yourself with further striving. Record all that concerns me.\"\nZhou Ziyang said: \"...It has been hundreds of years since we last parted, yet to me it feels like a single day. How bitterly you have entangled yourself in the cycles of life and death!\"\nSima of Kuocang said: \"Is it not Zhou who has attained the Dao without diligence in study?\"\nMao, Preserver of Life, said: \"The hardships of striving cannot be fully described—what is called 'first suffering, then joy.'\"\nWang Ziyang said: \"Time accumulates easily, but meritorious deeds are difficult to manifest. I once heard of Zhou’s name; now I see his virtue. His resolve has long been firm—this is truly evident.\"\nThis must refer to his courtesy name, Jia.\n\nThe Zhou Grand Master said: \"Zhou is young in years but profound in virtue, shallow in knowledge yet deep in wisdom. He has been thus for three lifetimes. In my past travels through the world, I visited him several times, and he was always able to open his heart in sincerity and extend benevolence. I wished to impart essential teachings to him, but he was not yet ready to receive the methods, so I did not transmit them. Now that we meet again, I am truly delighted.\"\nZhou Ziyang said: \"Do you know his origins? He is none other than my grandnephew. I last met him at the Southern Sea, and we parted. It has been over two hundred years since then.\"\n\nThe Minister said: \"I shall now announce the ranks of the foremost Perfected Ones among you.\nThe Left Perfected One of Ziyang governs Mount Geyan.\nSecond is Zhou, the Ancient Perfected One of Ziyang, who governs Mount Panzhong. (Wang and Zhou’s traditions state that Ziyang has Left and Right Perfected Ones, but it is unclear whether the Right is Wang; his name is unknown.)\nThird is Mao, Registrar of Destinies.\nFourth is Mao, Preserver of Life.\nFifth is Zhou, Right Grand Master of Penglai.\nSixth is Sima, Perfected One of Kuocang.\nSeventh is myself.\nThe first six ranks, including those who have come before and after, are all immortals. Only Feng is the Perfected One of the Yellow Court, governing the Central Marchmount.\"\n\nThe Preserver of Life asked: \"Do you roughly understand these ranks?\"\nZiliang replied: \"I humbly receive your instruction and now comprehend.\"\nThe Registrar of Destinies said: \"Previously, I sent Jing to arrange the transmission of the *Inner Secrets of the Mysterious Perfected*—have you not yet cultivated it?\"\nZiliang said: \"Having received the *Scripture of the Mysterious Perfected*, I should have cultivated it, but Master Hong previously bestowed the *Cavern Chamber* upon me, and I wished to first complete its practice, so I have not had the leisure.\"\nHe further instructed: \"The *Cavern Chamber* yields benefits slowly. If you cultivate the *Mysterious Perfected* with single-minded diligence, within five years you will obtain the attendance of the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery. I still advise you to prioritize it; cultivating both will not hinder one another.\"\nZiliang assented.\n\nWang said: \"You must strive diligently. Though your name is recorded in the registers, if you slacken midway, you may not fully attain this merit. Do not lightly reveal tonight’s affairs to others.\"\nThe Zhou Grand Master said: \"Those who attain immortality appear year after year, month after month—only people do not know it. In the year *shen*, you will ascend to the Grand Ultimate; if not, then in the year *you*. This appointed time is neither distant nor far—you must strive without ceasing.\"\nSima said: \"Your protection and advancement are strong, your attainments fine. The Dao will surely be harmonized—only ensure its circulation does not cease.\"\nZiliang received these one or two instructions and respectfully complied.\n\nThe Minister said: \"Master Tao’s affairs are recent, and this discussion is not without basis. Your aunt has repeatedly made earnest requests to the two Lords, and there is no objection—only I fear my own position may not permit assent.\"\nThe Registrar of Destinies said: \"Tao’s name is recorded with many gaps, and the flaws are not definitive. Since he indulged himself through me, I cannot take sole responsibility.\"\nMid-month, he asked to consult with Sihe (the courtesy name of the Preserver of Life). He intended to visit the various Controllers of Destiny to discuss the matter, assuring that there would be no hardship—do not worry hastily.\nHe further said: \"We depart now, but may return to visit again. If you have letters or memorials, they may also be conveyed.\"\nThey then departed together.\n\nThis entry, recorded on the second night of the seventh month, was written on four small blue slips, with an additional piece appended later.\n\n**Annotation:**\nOn this occasion, the Two Perfected of Ziyang and the Two Lords of Juqu seemed to descend for the first time. Yet in the previous sixth month, they had only dispatched their attendants. *The Declarations of the Perfected* states: \"Zhou Taibin was skilled at playing the one-stringed zither; the one who instructed Sun Deng was the Right Lady of Penglai—this must refer to her.\" Sima Kuocang appears neither in internal nor external records, nor is he the same as Ji Zhu; rather, he must have been Ji Zhu’s son, Fayu. Only this single visitation is recorded, after which he withdrew into seclusion. In the fourth month of this year, he dreamed of being summoned, saying that the official bureau was already prepared, save only for the seal, which had not yet been made. His heart was heavy with concern, and he went directly to Zhou to speak of it. Zhou then told his aunt of this, and she secretly arranged a delicate missive, instructing Pan Yuanwen to draft a memorial. Together with Zhou, they submitted the petition. Later, he retreated into seclusion in the Tianchuang Cavern, and nothing more was known. Only afterward did they learn of this, though they did not inquire whether Zhou had approved. By the thirteenth day of the seventh month, the matter was resolved. At dawn on the fourteenth, Zhou received the memorial and was shown the details. He had heard of this only once, yet it was said that there had been repeated delicate petitions—this remains unexplained.\n\nOn the third night of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, nine women arrived. They wore dark green robes with crimson-green skirts, their waists girded with purple sashes, and golden bells hanging from their belts. Beneath the bells hung large black talismans. Their documents were written on blue slips. Each held a tablet in hand, white as jade, with seams resembling woven patterns, and small bells sewn into the stitching, chiming as they walked. One of the women was Liu Xuanwei, another Tao Zhi’an; the rest were unknown and unseen. Speaking to Lady Liu, one said: \"Have you recently cultivated new studies? I have just returned from Donghua. The documents are roughly settled, and your name has been inscribed on the Azure Slips of Donghua—this is most fortunate.\" Lady Tao said: \"I have heard that those who fast and await the Northern Dipper achieve greatness beyond words. I marvel at your resolve, yet even this star cannot be swiftly attained—it requires years of accumulation.\" Lady Liu then called to the other women: \"This Zhou has the soaring elegance of clouds; he may be worthy of conversation.\" One replied: \"A minor immortal dares not speak with one so exalted.\" Liu said: \"High and low are not so easily fixed. He remains mired in the dust and clamor—we merely seek to awaken him. What exaltation is there?\" The woman smiled and said: \"We shall visit another time; now is not the occasion for words.\" Tao said: \"In this passage, *Liu Miaoji* should be written as *Ji* (姬), as the oral transmission misrendered the character.\" Sun Fanghua and Ruan Huixiang—these three women—are absent from *The Declarations of the Perfected*. These three have cultivated diligently and attained transcendence, receiving their texts in the Eighth Vermilion Terrace of Fangzhu. They have become immortal consorts, which is how we now know of them. Liu said: \"Zhou, do you desire this?\" He replied: \"I, a mere worm or bird, dare not aspire to such heights.\" She said: \"You *can* aspire—that is why I tell you.\" Tao said: \"The night grows late; we should depart.\" As they prepared to leave, the women said: \"Wait for us.\" Then they vanished together.\n\nThis entry, recorded on the third night, was written on two small blue slips.\n\n**Annotation:**\nThis refers to the previous month’s account of delivering the study register to Donghua, then descending after an audience with the King of Zhao. There were others who added playful or earnest words, expressing aspirations to harmonize the Two Modes, illuminate the sun and moon, and unite the qi of mountains and marshes, the convergence of yin and yang—all requiring pairing and mutual resonance. Even among the loftiest Perfected, this principle holds. Though long recorded in past accounts, the present discrepancy is not a matter of confusion. Yet distinctions of seniority and rank, of time’s length or brevity, each follow their own destined course—uniformity is not required. For those whose Dao transcends the mundane and whose minds congeal beyond transformation, responses may arise at the margins, no longer bound by conventional harmony. Like the resonance of Mañjuśrī or the manifestation in Vimalakīrti’s chamber, where guest and host exchange roles beneath the Fusang tree—this carries a different significance.\n\nOn the ninth night of the seventh month, the Two Perfected of Ziyang and Lord Zhou, along with the Registrar of Destinies and three others, appeared. Their attire was as before, and they were accompanied by some ten attendants. The Ziyang youth was also present, and they conversed at length. The Registrar of Destinies then said to Ziliang: \"You have labored diligently. Heavenly affairs have frequently wearied my spirit. Six days ago, I went to Donghua and saw your name inscribed on the Azure Slips—you have been appointed as Controller of the Dawn, the first among my disciples. Is this not magnificent? This accords with the hidden tally of past vows. Though not strictly within this office’s purview, it should be fulfilled first.\" Lord Zhou of Ziyang added: \"You were destined for this position. The various bureaus did not promote you based on manifest virtue but directly reported your cultivation—hence the delay. Entering the realm of the Perfected entails many trials. Steady your resolve and do not falter.\" Lord Wang of Ziyang said: \"This is excellent, though I fear the trials may prove difficult.\" Ziliang then asked: \"May I inquire how many trials there will be, and whether they are great or small? As a mortal, I fear I may falter in fear.\" Wang said: \"There will be two minor trials: you may encounter tigers and wolves, or strange voices and forms to frighten you. When you see these, compose your mind and fortify your intent—do not be alarmed. If you do not falter, the apparitions will crumble like dust. Such trials are but a moment’s effort.\" Zhou had long possessed a strong and upright spirit. As a child, he slept alone in empty houses and walked through forests and grasses at night without fear, never suffering nightmares. Since coming to Maoshan and moving to Zhuyang, he often traveled the roads at dawn and dusk, always alone.\n\nAt first, when Zhou inquired of others, he was told that from the eighth or ninth month onward, he had been observed coming and going only with one or two companions, which was unusual for him. At the slightest disturbance, he would grasp a blade or staff. When asked why, he would merely respond with vague sounds—this was surely a sign of his impending departure. Recently, he had taken secret precautions against the trials: on the twenty-sixth evening, he moved to sleep in the eastern chamber, where a Daoist was arranged to keep vigil by the window. The Daoist noticed Zhou could not sleep and rose several times to sit and recite incantations, saying this was a critical moment—lest anything unusual occur to startle him. Yet he passed unscathed, surely by the strength of his cultivation.\n\nThe *Dinglu* further stated: Yesterday, the Eastern Flower gathered all the Directors of Destiny, the local earth deities, and their subordinates to review the records. They found that among the people of the world, not even one in fifty did good, let alone those pursuing immortality—scarcely two or three in ten thousand. Even among those whose cultivation had nearly succeeded, many later fell away. I fear the registers of immortals will soon have no names left. Moreover, the kalpa of disaster draws near, making it even harder to attain. In the Purple Register of the Eastern Flower’s ledgers, among the highest tier of Perfected, five were listed—two have already fallen, and no replacements have advanced to take their place. Among the upper-middle Perfected, twenty-eight were recorded; one fell, seven were demoted to lower immortals, five returned to the mortal realm, and only one advanced. Among the lower Perfected, three hundred were listed; twenty-six fell, eleven were demoted to earthbound immortals, fifteen returned to the people, and only eight advanced. Among the highest immortals, two hundred eleven were recorded; forty-two fell, twelve were demoted to mid-level offices in the Three Bureaus, six achieved corpse-liberation, twenty-four became lowly mortals—altogether, fifty fell. Among the upper-middle immortals, two hundred ninety-three were recorded; seventy fell, ten were demoted to lower immortals, eight achieved corpse-liberation, fifty-one returned to the mortal realm, and only eleven advanced. Among the lower immortals, four hundred three were recorded; seventy-eight fell, twenty were claimed by the Dark Capital, four were examined by the Three Bureaus, fifty-four returned to the mortal realm, and only nineteen advanced.\n\nThis month’s marked demotions will soon reach their appointed time. They must be reported to the Supreme Ultimate, and their names recorded in the ledgers of Mount Tai. Seeing such cases is truly lamentable. All failed due to lax cultivation: some were led astray by the recently deceased, others strayed from the Dao in their conduct, or began diligently but later slackened, losing their progress—how bitter! Yet there are those on the verge of ascending to the heavens, their days and months not spent in vain. All were instructed by descending Perfected Ones. Some dwell deep in the mountains, others have studied the Dao for years, yet none are known to the world. We, too, often teach as we do you—who among today’s people would recognize this?\n\nZhou said: What the *Dinglu* of Mao recounts is a profound warning to you. Do not grow idle in your inquiries. You now stand among the lowest immortals, yet you may ascend to the upper ranks of the middle immortals—able to roam the Supreme Ultimate, riding the scales of dragons. Is that not joyous?\n\nMaster Wang said: The admonitions of the *Dinglu* of Mao and Zhou Ziyang are indeed profound, sufficient to serve as your true record. Here in the mountains of Juqu, there are three or four who have entered the ranks of lower immortals. Would you like to know of them?\n\nZiliang then asked about his teacher, Master Tao. The reply: If you were like him, attaining Perfection would not be difficult. Tao has long stood at the upper ranks of lower immortals—such as Fan Youchong and others. (One version reads: \"middle ranks of middle immortals,\" but later, a note in black ink marks it as \"upper ranks of lower immortals,\" though the reason is unclear.) Since it is said he has long held this rank, has he now slackened, causing his demotion by two stages? When Fan Youchong was a child, he first supervised the transcription of the *Zhen’gao*, unaware of the ranks of true immortals—how did he compare to the Director of Waterways?\n\nIt was said there are four in Juqu—would you like to know who they are? Yet the question was never asked, which is most regrettable. From what I have seen and heard, among men there are Jiang and Xue; among women, Jiang and Song. All have long pursued cultivation, young and old, male and female, from north and south—some for their virtue, others for their faith and insight, though their study is not yet deep. Xu Lingzhen, though descended from a former sage, has not yet engaged in study due to family burdens. Yang Chao, though now at Linwu, was once a Daoist of old Juqu, possessing great talent and ambition. I do not yet know who among these three will meet the count, but all should redouble their diligence to fulfill this limit.\n\nZiliang further asked about his aunt. The reply: She has committed no great transgressions, but if she remains diligent, she may yet attain it in a future life—nothing can be said of this one. His aunt, originally from Qiantang, was surnamed Zhang. At three, she lost her father and followed her mother to remarry into the Xu family of Yongjia, taking their surname. At ten, she left home to study the Dao under a master, establishing a hermitage in Yuyao. Her nature was utterly sincere, and she cared for no one but her nephew, Ziliang. At thirty-five, pressed by imperial decree and urged by fellow Daoists to make concessions, she married into the Zhu family of Shangyu, thus entangled in worldly affairs. Ashamed and resentful, she fell ill with qi stagnation for four years, bore a son, then fled back to Yongjia, severing all ties. To this day—eleven years later—she claims never to have killed an insect or ant in her life, nor carelessly plucked flowers or grass, eating but one meal a day. Yet she regrets her nature was too severe, her discipline too harsh. What she has said shows no great faults, though she is not without minor failings. She should have steadfastly preserved her integrity to fulfill her destiny, rather than suffering humiliation before gods and ghosts.\n\nThus, with my learning so shallow, how could I hope for fruition in this life? To achieve it in two or three lifetimes would already be fortunate.\n\nMaster Zhou further asked Ziliang, “What is your surname?”\n\nFlustered, Ziliang could not recall the name previously bestowed upon him and simply replied, “I am surnamed Zhou, named Ziliang.”\n\nThe master grew stern: “How dare you be so careless? You are Daoist Zhou Taixuan, styled Xuling—how could you be confused with the worldly Zhou Ziliang? Your name is inscribed on jade tablets as Zhou Taixuan. Do not presume to use it lightly. You should address yourself by your style.”\n\nZiliang said, “In the world, I am only known as Ziliang. I would not reveal my hidden name to common folk.”\n\nThe master replied, “Those in the world who are destined for the Dao are without limit—why should they cling solely to you? It is not merely because your fate moves the Perfected, but also because of the bond of kinship. Long ago, there were Yang and Xu: Yang Heng was visited by divine Perfected, yet Xu Yong never saw them. The reason was that Xu’s heart, though diligent and humble, was not free of desire and attachment, so he could not behold them. Yang’s rank was no higher than Xu’s, but his spirit was serene and steadfast, untroubled by the myriad distractions. His mind was not swayed by the splendor of the world, so he received the teachings from Yang and later conveyed them to Xu.\n\n“That you now see us is akin to Yang’s role. Do not lightly reveal these matters to others. Once, I traveled with Pei Qingling to Hua Qiao’s abode, where we received his instructions to convey them to Xu Qiao. But Xu was of common stock, his nature careless and undisciplined, unable to keep secrets. When taught a single method, he would embellish it and, without discernment, reveal it to anyone he met. After many such incidents, he was punished by Yang. Xu was cast into the river and drowned in a foreign land. Only fourteen years have passed since his escape, yet he remains among the ranks of ghosts, toiling day and night. Matters such as these—can you not be cautious? Do not reveal these things to others.”\n\nThe stories of Yang, Xu, and Hua Qiao all appear in the *True Reports*.\n\nThe *Record of Determinations* states: “Yesterday, I saw Yang in the Eastern Flower and invited him to come. He said he wished to, but was hindered by various matters and would visit another time.”\n\nMaster Wang said, “At the beginning of this month, I saw Lord Xu riding a dragon chariot with the Lady of Purple Tenuity and the Lady of Right Radiance, journeying to the Southern Perfected. The Lady of Purple Tenuity asked me if I had seen Zhou Taixuan, whose name is already inscribed in the Purple Register and who is destined for the Dao. She wished to observe his virtue and deeds. Have you seen him?”\n\nI replied that I had visited him and found him possessed of a refined and solitary virtue, well-suited to enlighten the Lady of Purple Tenuity. She said she would visit him again next year, and by autumn, his affairs would be settled so he could depart.\n\nThe Lady of Purple Tenuity oversees the instruction of those below.\n\nThe *Record of Determinations* said, “Your words are rough but sufficient to serve as a trial for Zhou. For now, depart. Heavenly duties are many, and I shall await your return tomorrow.”\n\nThey left with me, arriving at the second watch and departing at the fourth. Their words were too numerous to recall in full.\n\n---\n\nThis entry was received on the night of the ninth day and recorded on five sheets of official paper. Much of it concerns comings and goings, as well as proclamations and admonitions—all intended to impress caution, lest careless speech lead to punishment and demotion. Given this, how could they dare to reveal such matters? Even if pressed by the authority of kings or halls filled with gold and silk, they would seal their lips and uphold the Dao.\n\nThus, I ceased my inquiries, though this passage citing Yang and Xu’s admonition may well have another purpose. I regret not having discussed these matters with them earlier, for now, gaps remain, and though I continue to seek answers, it will not be in vain. How can I still hope for communication in the unseen realm? Yet there is still resonance.\n\n---\n\nOn the night of the eleventh day of the seventh month, Xu and Deng of Tong Bridge arrived, dressed as before. Xu approached and said, “Your name has already been submitted to the Eastern Flower, and you have been appointed as an attendant in the Office of Dawn Protection. This is a great cause for celebration.”\n\nDeng said, “This matter was foretold yesterday. Ziliang, you have already roughly explained it to the various Perfected. But you are of humble and unrefined nature—how dare you aspire to rely on the favor of divine Perfected?”\n\nXu said, “Recently, I saw Zhao Weibo, who serves in the Office of Life Protection. He said: ‘Zhou Ziliang, styled Yuansu, is now one person. His name is to be changed to Taixuan, styled Xuling. Born in the household of Zhou Kui, his name was first inscribed in the Purple Register. In his next life, he was born in the household of Liu Wei, and his name was again recorded in the Jade Register. Having endured hardships, he now strictly follows the celestial statutes and is to be reported as a minor immortal, appointed as Attendant of the Protective Register. His feathered regalia and attire remain as before. The Protector of Life will proceed to the Office of Determined Records to examine the matter at length, then compose a eulogy to be presented to the Eastern Flower, saying:\n\n*‘Zhou Taixuan possesses refined virtue, his heart and will empty and pure. According to the Purple Register, his immortal name may be inscribed.’*\n\nThe Eastern Flower then decreed that on the seventh day of the seventh month, the immortal officials would convene to review the register of names. Thus, your rank and position were determined: you are to be a middle-grade immortal, and a further petition has been made to promote you to the rank of upper immortal, appointing you as Attendant of the Office of Dawn Protection under the Han Lord.”\n\nThe document further states: *“Zhou Taixuan, styled Xuling, once nurtured the aspiration for the Dao and has now cultivated a vast and untrammeled virtue. Above, he aligns with the celestial principles; below, he accords with the terrestrial order. According to the immortal statutes, he is fit for the upper rank of the middle grade. As the term of the current Attendant of the Office of Dawn Protection nears its end, we request that Taixuan be selected to succeed him.”*\n\nRespectfully submitted to the Azure Lord, the decree reads as follows:\n\n*“Whereas Zhou Taixuan, by virtue of his deeds, has earned the inscription of his name on the immortal tablets, he is hereby appointed as Attendant of the Office of Dawn Protection.”*\n\nThis Han Lord inscribed the purple jade tablet with characters of red gold, addressing the Supreme.\n\nI have heard that this position is typically filled within one or two years, and you will likely be summoned then.\n\nZiliang asked, “What are the regalia for this position?”\n\nXu replied, “It cannot be fixed in advance, for it depends on the height of one’s merit. In principle, it may include a cinnabar dragon and green chariot, a canopy of black feathers, a staff of white plumes, five jade maidens in blue robes, seven jade lads in red, holding fans of swan feathers, wearing crowns of divine support, clad in robes of purple feathers and crimson clouds, girded with jade bells. The Six Dings will serve as messengers, and the myriad spirits will be under your protection.”\n\nHere the Master revealed the arts of divine transcendents and the methods of their instruction—no longer the mere office of a mortal registrar of records.\n\nThus, he pointed to what would come in due course, though it could not yet be shown to those near or far, serving only as a model for later generations.\n\nDeng said, “The True Lord of Tongwu wishes to come, but must first meet with the Supreme Void and the Two Perfected of the Ministry of Yin.”\n\nAfter repeated departures, he had spent the entire night in close counsel with his two disciples, fearing that if others arrived the next day and saw them in such disarray, word might spread. Thus, he kept it secret, revealing it only in private report. This matter, in fact, was precisely what the Green One had previously summoned him for—perhaps a reprimand or censure was due, as recorded in the celestial registers. Steward Zhao clearly knew of it, yet it could not be contested.\n\nUpon reflection, though he did not yet know whether he would assume this position, he felt no great desire for it, fearing it might be a mere illusion. Yet this reluctance arose from his devotion to the Dao, for he had examined Lord Lao’s teachings and understood that the nature of principle lies in forgetting. He no longer clung to all that is conditioned, and his resolve to seek the Dao had grown faint. Thus, he surmised that he would not greatly desire the office.\n\nNow that he had forgotten distinctions of acceptance and rejection, he would not refuse the task. If only he could benefit sentient beings, he would gladly endure lowly or arduous stations.\n\nLater, he admitted that though he wished to dissolve emotions and scatter thoughts, he had not yet fully succeeded. This was indeed a divine insight from his six or seven past journeys on the Dao—his afflictions were not yet exhausted, and he relied on this faith and forbearance, hoping to eradicate them entirely. Whether it took five years or ten, he would not regret hearing of it at dawn only to perish by dusk. It was his wish.\n\nSince Zhou had already seen him relinquish the matter, he wished to hasten and seek him out, following the separate record’s catalog.\n\nOn the fifteenth of the month, he received the *Three Heavens’ Dragon Script* for life preservation, along with its commands, and was instructed to blend in with mortals without drawing attention to his movements.\n\nThis passage, written on three sheets of white official paper, was the record received on the night of the eleventh. Within it lay the confirmation of his appointment, stating that he would not assume office until his predecessor’s term was complete. For now, he remained a provisional registrar, awaiting the appointed time before departing—though it was unclear whether he would truly hold the title or merely wander freely.\n\nThis was not a matter of personal desire; only when his topknot and temples showed signs of spiritual resonance could it be known.\n\nBy his calculations, he must still be in the grotto.\n\nOn the night of the thirteenth, Steward Zhao of the Celestial Registers arrived with them. Zhao said, “Yesterday, I went with Sihe to the Palace of the Supreme Origin and then called upon the Southern Lady to discuss Tao’s case. It was resolved in a short while.”\n\nZiliang asked when the summons would be issued, but Zhao replied, “It is uncertain—perhaps five or ten years. Though the matter concerns me, I must first report to the Upper Palace. I have been assigned to assist the Ministry of Destiny, so I dare not make a definitive statement.”\n\nSteward Zhao then said, “I have been ordered by the Eastern Palace to temporarily halt the summons of Tao.”\n\nZiliang asked whether the summons was for a celestial or ghostly office. Zhao answered, “It is for the position of High Radiance, Director of the Penglai Waterworks, who oversees water affairs. He was reprimanded, and it seems they wish Tao to replace him. However, the summons has been suspended, and another will be selected instead. This is a celestial office under the Ministry of Yin, overseeing water affairs. Tao is being considered for it due to his merits.”\n\n“Since Tao is a transcendent, he may not be aware of this. You may inform him.”\n\nAfter a moment, Zhao added, “Fortune and misfortune in life arise from causes, not from the will of the gods. Tao’s thoughts tonight—how could he recall such things? Though he speaks of dissolving emotions and scattering thoughts, he has not yet fully succeeded. How could he let them go entirely?”\n\nHe then spoke of alchemical matters, but the details were unclear—what a pity.\n\nHe also mentioned that the Great Lord of the Azure Youth would arrive when the moon was full, and that Hua would be exempted from the selection of transcendents under the *Yang* register.\n\nThis passage, written on a small sheet of white paper, was the record received on the night of the thirteenth. It aligned with what had been discussed two days prior, around the middle of the month.\n\nOn the fourteenth at dawn, Zhou entered the mountain pass and halted the previous summons, showing it to Tao. When asked his thoughts, Tao replied that he did not understand the reason, but his expression was grim. Ziliang dared not press further. Realizing the gravity of the matter, he ceased discussing it within the pass.\n\nOn the thirteenth night, during the first watch, Tao was suddenly visited by six or seven figures, all bearing staffs, who swiftly approached the steps. The foremost said, “\n\nTao the Recluse, having received the proclamation from Zhou, composed a memorial on the fifteenth to present upon their next meeting, framing it as a formal response. This would have served as a reciprocal declaration, yet Zhou ultimately did not regard it as an appeal to the Dao—perhaps because there was no clear affirmation or denial to proclaim.\n\nAt the time, the August Emperor, in his grace, granted two parcels of land for Daoist cultivation in Changsha of Song, along with adjacent vacant plots to the west of this site. He further ordered the construction of halls on either side of the front courtyard, which happened to occupy the former grounds of Director Xu. I privately feared that such proximity to the true transcendents might invite reproach, and thus I heard of this matter only indirectly, regretting that I could not compose a more eloquent petition in response—had I done so, it would surely have been met with a thousandfold reply.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-fifth, I dreamed of Attendants Tang and Zhao arriving. Zhao said, “Why do you persist in such toil, depleting your spirit, straining your ears and eyes? Depart now, and spare yourself further hardship.” Ziliang asked, “Is it favorable to reside in this sanctuary? Lately, I have been constantly anxious about banditry.” Zhao turned and said, “This concerns Attendant Tang.” Tang then replied, “Though it concerns me, I am not at liberty to decide. As for calamities, even spirits and gods cannot foresee them. You need not fret excessively over this sanctuary, for it wearies the mind. As for Ziliang’s mention of bandit raids, he relies on us deeply.” He answered, “Take care and do not worry overmuch,” then departed. “Our discussion of fate and destiny is not yet concluded; we shall visit again.” I rose to see them off, and they vanished as they followed one another away.\n\nThis passage, received in a dream on the night of the twenty-fifth, was recorded on a sheet of white official paper.\n\nThat summer, the drought had soured the people’s temper, and the mountain’s venerable elders feared only alarm and terror. Thus, I sought their counsel through this inquiry. Attendant Tang, named Gongfang, was one of the Four Attendants, said to govern life and death, and to calculate matters of banditry—though it should have been Attendant Le who held jurisdiction, I did not realize it concerned Tang. In past records, whenever Tang appeared, there were always introductory exchanges, as if we were meeting for the first time. Perhaps such details were already noted and need not be preserved here.\n\nFrom this point onward, until now, I have enjoyed peace and security. According to a separate record’s catalog, on the twenty-eighth of this month, Attendant Tang again spoke of banditry, urging me not to worry, and so forth. This was not made explicit, so I feared it might not be transcribed.\n\nFrom the third to the twenty-fifth of the seventh month, there were nearly seven entries, written on ten sheets of blue and white paper of varying sizes. One entry is missing from the catalog, but the rest are complete.\n\n*Record of Zhou’s Communications with the Unseen, Scroll Three* concludes here.\n\n*Record of Zhou’s Communications with the Unseen, Scroll Four*\n\nThis scroll begins with the first communication on the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the year *yiwei* and continues through the seventh month of the year *bingshen*, with a monthly catalog of all recorded communications. The fifth, sixth, and seventh months are fully documented in the preceding three separate scrolls. From the eighth month onward, only this year’s catalog remains, with no further records.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the year *yiwei*, during the day, Attendant Zhao of the Life-Preserving Bureau delivered a proclamation. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the year *yiwei*, at night, Marshal Fan of the Life-Preserving Bureau delivered a proclamation. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day of the fifth month in the year *yiwei*, at night, Master Hong, an immortal of Mount Song, and two stellar attendants delivered a proclamation. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of the fifth month in the year *yiwei*, during the day, I dreamed of partaking in the Golden Liquid Offering. [Text omitted.]\n\nThe above four entries pertain to matters of the fifth month and are now compiled separately in the first fascicle.\n\n111 entries record visions, while one records a dream.\n\nOn the first day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, Attendant Zhao of the Life-Preserving Bureau, the Jade Youth of the Hua-Yang Agricultural Office, and the Jade Youth of the Zi-Yang Inner Palace each delivered proclamations on the practice of cultivating the body. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the fourth day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, the Hua-Yang Youth delivered a proclamation instructing that when insulted by others, one should not accept it in the heart. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the sixth day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, Immortal Deng of Tong Bridge arrived to form a bond of unseen friendship.

[Text omitted.]\n\nOn the eleventh day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, while lodging at East Ridge, the female immortal Li Feihua of Yi-Qian announced that five female immortals wished to come. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the twelfth day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, True Man Feng of Mount Song, Master Zhang of the Xiao-Xian Hall, Immortal Hong of Mount Song, Attendant Le of the Life-Preserving Bureau, and the Jade Youth of Hua-Yang—a total of five—delivered essential teachings on longevity. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the year *yiwei*, Marshal Fan delivered a proclamation on abstaining from meat. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, Master Hong of Mount Song transmitted the *Cavern Chamber Scripture*. [Text omitted.] This record is now missing.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, Marshal Fan sent someone to reiterate the prohibition against eating meat, stating that [the proclamation] had been issued after departing from the mountain. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the nineteenth day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, the five female immortals of Yi-Qian arrived to proclaim the fundamental causes of life and death.

[Text omitted.]\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, Immortal Xu of Cangwu delivered a proclamation regarding coffin matters.

[Text omitted.] This record is now missing.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the sixth month in the year *yiwei*, Huang Yuanping delivered a proclamation stating that his name had been removed from the death register of Mount Tai.

[Text omitted.]\n\nThe above seventeen entries pertain to matters of the sixth month and are now compiled separately in the second fascicle. Three entries are missing, leaving fourteen now extant, none of which mention dreams.\n\nOn the second day of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, the two Perfected Ones Zhou and Wang of Zi-Yang, the two Perfected Lords of the Register of Destiny and the Life-Preserving Bureau, Minister Zhou, Sima of Kuo-Cang, and Attendant Le arrived together to discuss matters of great discourse, as well as matters of concealment and fragility. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the third day of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, a female immortal of Yi-Qian arrived, stating that her name had been inscribed on the Green Bamboo Slips. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the ninth day of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, the two Perfected Ones of the Zi-Yang Register of Destiny delivered a proclamation announcing their promotion to the Office of Morning Preservation, along with the submission of the number of names removed.

[Text omitted.]\n\nOn the thirteenth day of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, the Lord of the Register of Destiny and Attendant Zhao delivered a proclamation regarding the cessation of the summons for Tao De and related matters. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, the Lord of the Life-Preserving Bureau transmitted the *Dragon Script of the Three Heavens*, instructing that one should simply blend into the mortal world, refraining from extraordinary conduct or manifestations. In movement and stillness, act as you will; in coming and going, follow your inclinations—only do not violate the true Dharma. When practicing the Perfected Dharma, act in silence and let no one know. The divine luminaries do not regard ten thousand *li* as distant, nor mountains and seas as obstacles. In response to inclinations, act freely as you will—do not let us hinder you. [Text omitted.] This record is now missing.\n\nOn the eighteenth day of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, I saw the Lord of the Register of Destiny deliver Tao’s response and inquire about his dwelling. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, Attendants Zhao and Tang delivered a proclamation advising against overtaxing the spirit or exhausting the body. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, Attendant Tang delivered a proclamation regarding calamities of robbery and disaster, stating that no precautions were necessary and no worries should arise. [Text omitted.] This record is now missing.\n\nThe above nine entries pertain to matters of the seventh month and are now compiled separately in the third fascicle.\n\nTwo entries are missing, and now seven remain, some witnessed in waking vision and others in dreams. Together with the thirty entries above, all have detailed records. Only five are missing. From this point onward, no further records exist, which is deeply regrettable.\n\nOn the first day of the eighth month in the year *yiwei*, Attendant Fan arrived with a proclamation, stating: \"Today, the various Perfected Ones gathered to discuss and celebrate, and from now on, they wish for you to come freely and wander wherever you please.\" This visitation was not a dream.\n\nOn the fifth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I entered through a vermilion gate and towering palace, where I saw the Lord of Life’s Register. He bestowed upon me a luminous zhi fungus. The luminous zhi is one of the five varieties of zhi from Mount Gouqu.\n\nOn the seventh day of the eighth month, in a dream, I entered Huayang, first passing through the Palace of Life Preservation, then proceeding to the Office of Destiny to inquire about the whereabouts of the Celestial Dragon’s zhi in Xiaoxian. This journey went from north to south. The Celestial Dragon’s zhi is also one of the five varieties of zhi.\n\nOn the ninth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I arrived at the Office of Destiny and was questioned upon seeing them, asking whether I had joined others in a purification fast. That day, in the central hall, Wang Faming conducted a *tutan* fast for the imperial family.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I rode in a carriage with the Lord of Destiny within Huayang, accompanied by thirty jade maidens playing celestial music. We visited the Southern Perfected in the Cinnabar City, where the Southern Perfected delivered a proclamation. They then reported to the Supreme Prime, who showed me the registers of immortality. Both Perfected residences are located on Great Mount Huo.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I traveled with the Lords of Destiny and Life Preservation to the abode of the Lady of Purple Tenuity. The Lady of Purple Tenuity governs the Dark Dragon Palace, which should lie in the north.\n\nOn the sixteenth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I arrived at Fangzhu and saw the residence of the Azure Lord, though I did not see the Azure Lord himself. Instead, I met Han Taihua, and Lady Song of the Vermilion and Azure Pavilion appeared, instructing me on the essentials of divine transcendence and the art of relinquishing form. Han Taihua was initially appointed this year to the Eastern Palace, where he received the books of the Vermilion Palace as a companion to the Jade Consort Han, as recorded in the *True Annals*.\n\nOn the nineteenth day of the eighth month, in another dream, I visited Fangzhu and encountered the Azure Lord on an outing, accompanied by Lord Yang Jiuhua and Immortal Marquis Xu. I then visited Marquis Han, who informed me of matters concerning the celestial registers. This Han is the same as the one previously mentioned in the records as the Keeper of Registers in the Eastern Palace, named Huiqi.\n\nOn the twenty-first day of the eighth month, in a dream, I traveled with the Lord of Life Preservation to Penglai, where I saw Minister Zhou. We then arrived at a vermilion terrace with towering gates, green eaves, and purple chambers. It was said that this was the Office of the Yin Bureau, where a certain Tao was recently appointed to govern this northeastern dark palace. Continuing on, I saw a person with a golden complexion, of medium stature, dressed in soaring-cloud robes and cap. He instructed me on matters of the Dao and its methods. The Lord of Life Preservation said: \"This is Minister Zhou, a minor celestial official of the Dao. He has also expounded on many causes and conditions of the Dao’s work.\" Minister Zhou is the same as the Grand Guest. The *True and Unadorned* also states: \"On Penglai, the Lord of the Yin Bureau oversees the world’s water affairs,\" as recorded in the earlier traditions of Master Ma. It is unclear whether his governance lies in the lesser Fangzhu of Penglai. Many matters of the Dao also appear in the *True and Unadorned Pavilion*.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I traveled with Attendants Fan and Zhao to Great Mount Heng, where I saw Minister Xue of Nanling and Minister Du of the Central Yellow. They bestowed upon me the method of concealment and transformation. Proceeding further, I saw a thatched hut, exceedingly tall and vast, with sweet springs and various flowers growing around it. Attendant Fan said: \"This is the abode of wandering immortals.\" We entered together and sat beneath the hut, discussing matters of divine transcendence. Neither Minister Xue nor Minister Du appear in the *True Annals*.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I entered Huayang and presented myself at the *Dinglu* Register, where I inquired whether I might secure an extension until the tenth month of the coming year. The answer came: \"It may be so.\" This still reflected an intention to remain in the world. The reason for making this request—though the initial response was affirmative—was the fear that further entreaties might follow. If, upon careful reconsideration, the extension were granted, then it would not be so; indeed, by the tenth month, I would depart.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-sixth day of the eighth month, in a dream, the *Dinglu* Register’s Protector of Life came to see me and announced: \"Tomorrow, I shall again journey to Donghua to consult the Controller of Destinies. Since this is a matter of heavenly decree, I cannot act in accord with you. I shall instead seek out Lord Han to discuss the matter. There will be no further discrepancies.\" Some details regarding names and records were repeatedly mentioned, but these cannot be fixed, for advance or retreat still depend on the balance of merit and transgression.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the eighth month, I received a summons to the appointed audience, where the decree of the *Dinglu* Register was proclaimed: \"Lord Han holds you in deep regard; the records remain contingent.\" This encounter was not a dream.\n\nThe appointed audience was with a prominent figure of Huayang, named Jing Shangqi.\n\nOf the thirteen entries above, two from the eighth month were real encounters, while eleven were dream journeys.\n\nOn the second day of the ninth month, I dreamed of arriving at the midst of Huayang, where I saw two lords.\n\nOn the fifth day of the ninth month, I dreamed again of journeying to Penglai. First, I visited the Controller of Destinies, who informed me: \"To consume the divine elixir, your name must first be inscribed in the register of immortals; only then may you partake of it.\" Thereafter, I reached Penglai and met with Minister Zhou. He offered me a herb, resembling sophora blossoms but of a purple hue, and said: \"You have not yet tasted this. Once you do, you shall become like me.\" He also spoke of fire dates and intertwined pears—these appear in the *True Reports*, though I remain uncertain of their wondrous nature.\n\nOn the eighth day of the ninth month, I dreamed of wandering through Yiqian with Minister Zhao, visiting the two palaces of Tongchu. The two palaces stood some five or six *li* apart. Yiqian was the palace of female immortals, while Tongchu was that of male immortals. Yet I remain unsure whether they were arranged east-west or north-south.\n\nOn the tenth day of the ninth month, I dreamed of accompanying the Protector of Life to a mountain, its form smooth and rounded, unlike those of the mortal realm. The mountain was called Danlong, and within its clouds lay a grotto inhabited by many immortals. Danlong, I was told, lay south of Yangluo and served as the administrative palace of the Southern Perfected.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the ninth month, I dreamed of traveling alone to Tongqiao Mountain, where I beheld the Golden Court Lodge, resplendent with pearls and treasures. Its halls and chambers were arranged in orderly rows, their hues of blue and yellow all alike. I was further told that the Golden Court Grotto Palace existed beyond what I saw—this was merely a place of leisure for the assembled immortals, where their stewards conducted affairs, not the residence of Perfected King. When the Great Lord of the East arrived, a separate palace would be prepared, though I did not witness it. Tongxiang and Youbi, the domains governed by Perfected King, were said to have palaces both within and beyond the mountain.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the ninth month, I dreamed that the *Dinglu* Register came to Zhuyang and led me to the Bureau of Destinies. Along the way, I encountered the Two Ladies, Xuanqing and Ziwei, who rode upon cloud-cakes accompanied by over twenty jade maidens. They addressed the *Dinglu* Register, saying: \"The Controller of Destinies, Ziyang, has been delayed by mortal dust. His coming now is also due to this.\" This implied that I, a mortal, was the cause of his delay—though they did not refer to me as Chen Sheng. The *Dinglu* Register responded accordingly.\n\nAt that moment, I knew not where I was—only that I moved without conscious will. Upon reaching the Gate of the Bureau of Destinies, I beheld Ziyang, and we met together. He spoke at length of matters too vast to record in full. This must have been an extraordinary event.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the ninth month, I suddenly dreamed of Zhang Li, the Master of Prohibitions and Decrees, reciting the *Daode* in full. The two chapters of the *Daode* are indeed the ultimate essence of Daoist scriptures. The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate also said: \"Recite them ten thousand times, and you shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\" From the preceding account to this point, all were written in ink on large sheets of western hemp paper, nearly seven hundred in total.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the ninth month, I dreamed of a thing in the northwest of the heavens, dozens of *zhang* in length, blue and red in hue, its head and tail of equal girth, resembling a rainbow. I went to Zhang Li’s place of prohibitions and asked what this thing was. He replied: \"It is called the Beast of Dark Radiance, or sometimes the Water Mother—truly a cause for sorrow. That which is non-being within being is not as profound as non-being within non-being. The principle of emptiness and nothingness is difficult to fathom. This is the manifestation of the calamity of the nine-six, yet who among men knows it?\" Zhang, as the Lord of Prohibitions of the Bureau of Life Preservation, was in charge of petitioning for rain and water, hence my question to him.\n\nThis matter is recorded in the *True Records of the Infant*. Zhang was skilled in discoursing on emptiness and nothingness, and his words always entered into such realms. The Recluse said: \"Non-being within being is the emptiness of self-nature; non-being within non-being is the emptiness of ultimate truth.\" Yet these are mere verbal explanations—what do they truly point to?\n\nThe above eight entries record the events of the ninth month, all noted in dreams.\n\nOn the second day of the tenth month, I dreamed of Master Hong, who instructed me to recite the *Tai Su Invocation*. The source of this text remains unclear. On the fifth day, I dreamed of the Lord of Life Register, who said: \"Recently, there have been many offerings to the throne. You must restrain yourself and not indulge your desires.\" This likely should read \"indulge\" (恣), for though there have been frequent promotions and demotions, one ought to remain diligent. On the eleventh day, I saw Ziyang, the Lord of Life Register, and Tongwu of the Bureau of Life Preservation, as well as matters concerning the relocation to Zhu Yang. The details are unclear, and I do not know whether this discussion was appropriate. On the eighteenth day, I saw the Lord of Life Register again, who said: \"Zhu Yang is not a place for you to dwell. If you cannot move far away, even the left side of Zhu Yang would be better than staying here, though I fear you may not be able to remain there.\" On the nineteenth day of this month, the Recluse first moved to reside in Zhu Yang, and Zhou also came with him. Since this is an official residence, one must consider the possibility of future events that might prove obstructive.\n\nOn the twentieth day, I dreamed of the Southern Perfected One of the Purple Tenuity. On the twenty-seventh day, I dreamed of Minister Zhao, Master Hong, and matters concerning the stars. This likely pertains to the affairs of the Two Stars. On the twenty-ninth day, I dreamed of arriving at a place called the Palace of the Shade City, where many immortals dwelled, though I did not recognize them. The origin of the Shade City Palace remains unknown.\n\nThe above seven entries record the events of the tenth month: two describe visions, and five describe dreams.\n\nOn the third day of the eleventh month, I dreamed of Lord Hong and Minister Tang, who said: \"The stars in the clouds have vanished; you should gaze only toward the southern mountain. Though this may be worth observing, it is not the true essence of seeking the Dao.\" On the third day, since the affairs of the Two Stars had been mentioned, one should not simply rest. On the eighth day, I dreamed of the Lord of Life Register and explained my desire to build a small hut in the eastern part of Zhu Yang, but I was unsure whether this was permissible. He replied: \"The eastern side is a good location, but burial there would be inconvenient. A proper dwelling should be a four-sided courtyard; otherwise, you must at least construct a main hall with eastern and western wings. If you do not, it will be called a 'lonely and inauspicious abode.' Build it as you see fit, then depart, leaving it for those who come after. I have observed Tao’s intentions—he greatly wishes to test you. Do not fear others’ disbelief; if they disbelieve, it will bring me joy.\"\n\nOn the eastern ridge, there are two large hollows, both suitable for constructing a tomb. Initially, I intended to build a vast structure in the western hollow, but it would be better to erect an observation platform near the western hollow, closer to Zhu Yang. Zhou has now decided to bury in the eastern hollow, facing due south.\n\nOn the thirteenth day, I dreamed of Lord Zhou, who said: \"Tao may or may not believe you, for he often likes to test people. Recently, you have also been troubled by many distracting thoughts; you must restrain yourself.\" He repeatedly warned: \"Tao may or may not believe you and wishes to test you.\" Upon reflection, I realize there have indeed been instances of disbelief, stemming from my own wandering thoughts. All conditioned phenomena are ultimately without regret.\n\nIn Zhou’s affairs, I have been both modest and compliant, never acting contrary to his wishes. Yet at times, I have seen him preoccupied, acting carelessly, which seems inconsistent with the proper demeanor of one who attends to the spirits. When Zhou wished to build a separate dwelling, I readily agreed and even offered to survey the land, providing ten thousand coins. He initially planned to construct a three-bay hall with two bays for eastern and western wings. However, when the trees and bamboo were planted and the Daoist’s intentions were not yet settled, disputes arose, and the plan was abandoned. Only a three-bay hall was built. Today, I see how matters have unfolded so closely—clearly, this was not my original intention. Though I had some preliminary plans and still wished to proceed, the remaining instructions stated that only one bay should be retained, as it was a place for former companions. Now, everything is to be repaired to prevent it from falling into disarray.\n\nOn the fifteenth day, I dreamed of Lord Hong, who came to tell me: \"The northwest side of your intended residence has residual qi. I will go with you to examine it.\" We went there and saw a man of extremely ugly appearance. The Lord said: \"This is the Great Capital. It is inauspicious for people to dwell here; you will certainly suffer hardship.\"\n\nAfter Zhu Yangwan and the others had surveyed the site, two or three coffin-like structures resembling ancient tombs were discovered. Though overgrown with brambles and weeds, the place had once been trodden by people, its buried dust now unseen. There was a site for shamanic rituals, said to hold residual *qi*—precisely the abode of wandering spirits. Yet since it posed no suffering, it was deemed harmless.\n\nOn the twentieth day, I saw a woman of extraordinary beauty, attended above and below by two maidservants in blue-green robes. She stood at the threshold but spoke no word.\n\nOn the twenty-sixth day, I dreamed of Zhou Penglai, who said: \"The Northern Dipper has vanished once more, and prayers were offered to the two stars,\" and so on. This was the twenty-seventh, the day when the two stars were to be observed. But as the evening had turned overcast, they would certainly not be visible.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day, I dreamed of the two Lords Mao and the two Lords Zhou, all riding in a carriage, roaming over Leiping. They went straight to Fulong, where the Record-Keeper raised his hands in greeting, as if bidding farewell. Leiping lies to the southeast of the bend, while Fulong is to the northwest. Ascending into the sky from the bend at ten degrees, they could thus gaze upon one another.\n\nOf these seven entries, the events of the eleventh month: one records a sighting, six record dreams.\n\nOn the third day of the twelfth month, I saw Xu Deng—*Deng* should have been written as 邓. The two Lords said they were departing.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day, the Tongwu Prefecture’s registry of penal servitude was found to contain errors, and three men were punished for the oversight of the guilty in the ledgers. And so on. Thus, the matter remained unresolved.\n\nOn the seventh day, I dreamed of going to the Bureau of Destiny to report matters concerning the Jade Purity and Dark Mystery. *And so on.* The discourse here was exceptionally profound, [lacuna] and thus not briefly recounted.\n\nOn the eleventh day, I dreamed of seeing Lady Han, who said: “Of late, my thoughts and aspirations have grown ever more detached, deepening into the true form.” *And so on.* This must have been Han Taihua, who was first initiated into the Eastern Palace as a consort in the seventh month.\n\nOn the nineteenth day, I saw a man driving a great carriage, his appearance most imposing, followed by ten attendants. He came only to bow before Wen Dong and then departed.\n\nOn the twenty-first day, the Record-Keeper announced: “The one who came to pay respects earlier was Cai Zijian, the Enforcer of the Deng Capital.” He had come merely to report that you were now overseeing his superior office. *And so on.* The officials of the Bureau of Life Protection all hold concurrent posts in the Deng Terrace Chancellery, which is closely connected to the Upper Palace—this pertains to the duties of the register of life.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day, I saw Attendant Zhao, who said: “The immortal register is now empty—you need not worry.” Thus, in the seventh month, the Record-Keeper’s lament that “the immortal register has no one” was also a cause for concern.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day at dusk, I saw the Record-Keeper, Attendant Zhao, and Marshal Fan. Ziliang asked what message had been conveyed, but the Lord had not yet received it. The Lord said he had just obtained it, then told the Attendant: “You may simply state the matter directly—say nothing more.” *And so on.* There seemed to be some hidden intent in this, which could not be fully disclosed; it was likely due to the Marshal’s lingering grievance.\n\nOf these seven entries, the events of the twelfth month: five record sightings, two record dreams.\n\nOn the third day of the intercalary month, I dreamed of seeing Lady Han, who said: “In the world below, there are no longer any traces like this.” *And so on.* Lady Han was still likely Taihua.\n\nOn the sixth day, I saw Master Hong, who said: “Exert yourself diligently—encourage yourself in all matters, past and present.” *And so on.* This, too, was merely to urge and admonish.\n\nOn the fifteenth day, I saw the Lord of Life-Preservation, who said: “Do not let the matter of your house weigh on your mind, lest it harm your spirit and qi. The person in question will soon come to you of their own accord. In the first month, when you wished to build a house but hesitated, the master never came. Then you said you would draft a petition to inform the marshal of the county’s administration, and that he would surely come of his own accord—this is the reason for the present notice.”\n\nOn the eighteenth day, I dreamed of the Great Lord of Life-Command, who asked: “Do you wish to attain the Dao?” I did not answer, but in truth I did wish it. He said: “If you wish to attain the Dao, why do you not study the Way of immortality?” *And so on.*\n\nOn the twenty-third day, I saw Master Hong again, who said: “The one you asked about—the man who sailed the boat—was Gan Pu, an immortal of Mount Song. In a former life, he had dealings with Tao of such-and-such, but you did not know him in this life. How could he have come here? Last winter, a man named Gu Daodu returned from the outer river. He said that at Dalei, he suddenly encountered a man in a small boat no larger than a deer’s neck, poorly crafted and barely holding one person, who emerged from the waves and called out Gu’s name. The man said: ‘I am going to the capital and wish to send a letter to Tao Yinju of Maoshan. Yinju had promised to assist me in my efforts to present something to the Lord. The Lord was just then drafting a letter to bestow upon me, but suddenly said: “Since you will not go to the mountain, I will come down myself.”’ The man claimed to be surnamed Peng. Gu hurried to Guangling on his way to the capital to deliver this message, but when he inquired at Hua’s office, he missed the opportunity. He then entrusted the matter to the Daoist Qiang, a disciple of Sizhen, who recorded the details and sent them back. Yinju merely listened to the account without questioning its source. It seems Qiang had privately inquired in the unseen realm. Since this was the report given, the man should no longer come down of his own accord.”\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day, I saw the Record-Keeper and the Lord of Life-Preservation. The Lord of Life-Preservation said: “You have labored much this year, driving away and suppressing spirits and gods. The Three Offices have memorialized that you have committed many transgressions, but I have already rejected their claims. You should not repeat such conduct three times over.” *And so on.* How fortunate I am to receive such protection and favor from the divine perfected.\n\nThe memorial from a single office concerns but mediocre men—each of you should tread as though on thin ice.\n\nOn the twenty-sixth day, I saw Lord Zhou, who said: “At the eastern reaches of Mount Ge’s ridge, the waters have risen eighty-one zhang. The western flank of Mount Heng in the south has suddenly collapsed into an abyss.” *And so on.*\n\nOn the twenty-eighth day, I saw Lord Xu, who said: “Han Zhong has resumed his affairs. Now he and Deng will go to observe them.” *And so on.* This must refer not to Huiqi but to Zhong—also called Huolin, the Controller of Destinies.\n\nOn New Year’s Eve, I dreamed of the Controller of Destinies and the Southern Perfected. The Southern Perfected handed me a child, large as a goose egg, and bade me swallow it. The Controller of Destinies said: “The Dao is not yet complete; you have not obtained the Ninefold Transformed Flower. For now, eat this—it will suffice to brighten your vision.” *And so on.*\n\nThe above eight entries pertain to matters of the intercalary month. Six are accounts of visions; two are dreams.\n\nFrom the beginning of the eighth month to the end of the intercalary month—nearly six months in all—fifty-one entries were recorded. Sixteen describe visions; fifteen, dreams. From the twenty-ninth day of the ninth month onward, all were inscribed in vermilion on large, pale paper, with one sheet bearing additional yellow-script text.\n\nOn the second day of the first month of the bingshen year, I dreamed of ascending to the Lesser Heavenly Realm, where I saw Lord Wang. He said: “Why do you rush so restlessly among men? Your name is already fixed—do not falter on the worldly path.” *And so on.* This was Lord Wang of Pure Emptiness of Mount Wangwu, chief of the Twenty-Four Perfected who transmit the lower teachings.\n\nOn the tenth day, I saw Lord Hong, commander of the Fan host, who said: “The coming year is wuyin, when the Supreme Mystery’s governance begins. You may don the cap of office.” He added: “Only the dwelling is not yet properly situated.” Lord Hong replied: “Even the great cosmos is ever inconstant—what constancy can human life claim? This place will do well enough.” He also spoke of matters concerning the *Cave Scriptures*. *And so on.* Though I had intended to don the cap that day, the master did not arrive. A light rain fell besides, so the ceremony was not performed. It was not until the dinghai day that I was finally able to assume it.\n\nOn the eleventh day, I saw Lord Zhou, the Peach Record-Keeper, and the Lord of Life-Preservation. Lord Zhou said: “Will you no longer pursue the true Dao? I am about to leave you.” Before I could respond, the Record-Keeper said: “His heart is not so—it is only his body that has failed. Perhaps Ziyang is testing him.” The Lord of Life-Preservation asked: “Why did you suddenly take three hundred *hu* of grain from someone?” I answered: “I did not.” He repeated: “Why did you take it?” I again replied: “I did not.” He continued: “If you did not take it, then why say so? There must be some other matter you cannot explain.” During these past ten-day periods, I have been constantly anxious and unsettled over the construction of the house. Fearing both bodily failure and mental agitation, the Record-Keeper was surprised. As for the grain, I heard nothing of it—this was the first I had heard of such a claim. Three hundred *hu* of grain amounts to one hundred thirty *hu* of rice, enough to feed an ordinary person for six years. I suspect this refers to grain meant for the master’s sustenance. Since I have long served as the master’s disciple, providing for his clothing and food, it would be improper to hold me accountable for this. I said: “I did not take it.” The divine witness declared: “To take or not take—neither should be falsely claimed.” He added: “You must reflect further on this.” This answer I did not understand.\n\nOn the fourteenth night, I dreamed of Xu Xianhou and four others conversing among themselves. Xu said: “This dwelling of mine has not been long established—barely two hundred years or so.” Another replied: “Cosmic kalpas pass in the blink of an eye; what is this to speak of as distant?” I did not know who it was, but someone mentioned that Changshi Li had built his residence on the mountain during the Yonghe reign of Emperor Mu of Jin—only a hundred and sixty or seventy years ago.\n\nOn the seventeenth night, I saw Attendant Dinglu and Tang Cheng arrive. The Middle Lord said: “What Lord Xu said recently was most profound.” Tang Cheng discoursed at length on the affairs of the Northern Terrace—too much to inscribe in full. The Northern Terrace is the Terrace of the Northern Emperor in Dengdu.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth night, Attendant Dinglu said: “When thoughts are not kept secret, impure qi cannot be distinguished—he spoke of refining and polishing, and so on.”\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day, I saw the Lord of Life-Preservation and Lord Hong. Lord Hong said: “Do not speak lightly of others’ affairs.” And so forth. This must be some kind of trial, though I know not what.\n\nThe above seven entries pertain to matters in the first month of the *bingshen* year. Four entries record visions; two, dreams.\n\nOn the third day of the third month, I dreamed of Master Hong speaking of the Northern Dipper. And so forth. This again concerns the two stars he oversees, for Hong was the one who transmitted the teaching, hence his repeated mention of them.\n\nOn the seventh day, I dreamed that Attendant Dinglu said: “In the mountains of Linhai, where the forests have burned, a transcendent wanders among the people, calling himself Master Peng. In truth, he is Zheng Xuan, styled Ziyin, the immortal of Luhun. Zhu Jiaofu sent him to observe the dispositions of men and those who cultivate the Dao. He may come seeking you soon—he has already gone to Jian’an. A man of Linhai wrote to the Daoist Zou Yao, saying: ‘Master Peng is here, and I, Yao, have not yet been able to withdraw into quietude, so others have been able to meet him.’ The man swiftly boarded a small boat with a single oar. He sang:\n\n*How vast and dark the Great Empyrean,\nThe numinous ones descend in timely flight.\nThey charge me to sweep the dust from the path,\nTo seek and examine the companions of the clouds.\nThe world’s roads are steeped in defilement,\nTrue sincerity cannot be fathomed.\nI urge my carriage back to Lu Ridge—\nIn the human realm, none are my match.*\n\nHe also chanted this while walking. If he comes, do not receive him.” The man appeared of middling stature, with a purple mark on the left side of his face. He wore a yellow silk cap, had a full beard, and was missing his front teeth. This entry is recorded in such detail, perhaps to provide a sign for later generations. The “burned mountain” is Red Water Mountain, now part of Yongning District, though it may lie at the border of three counties. I do not know where Zou Yao is from, but his appearance and attire are so distinctive that he should be easy to recognize—though I fear he may alter his form if he knows others can identify him.\n\nOn the ninth day, I saw Attendant Zhao, who said: “Lately, your spirit and will—why are they so listless?” And so forth.\n\nOn the fourteenth day, I saw Attendant Dinglu, who said: “The Lord of Life will come in the middle of next month, and the West Palace’s Attendant Shu will also arrive together—thus I forewarn you.” And so forth. This likely refers to the eighteenth day of the third month, as I have seen a written record of his words from that day.\n\nOn the twentieth day, I dreamed of the Lord of Life. Upon meeting him, he ordered me to fetch a green *ci*-chapter—this single character is blurred beyond recognition. I presented it to the Lord of Life, who said: “This will do, but your heart is not yet true. You must further refine and polish it.” Later, I saw Attendant Jingshang, who said: “The two lords have now gone to Tortoise Mountain. I pass this on so you may know. Your emotions stirred, and after jesting with someone earlier, you allowed demonic influences to encroach. Fortunately, Senior Overseer Gao intervened, or it might have led to disaster. I heard Zhou was in the capital and suddenly suffered from pain and fear—this was likely the reason.” I do not know who Senior Overseer Gao is; he is not among those in the grotto. He also said: “The man who wraps his house and claims not to be a Daoist is an agent of the Northern Star’s Ghost Official—do not trust him. His perverse desires swiftly delude people and corrupt their true *qi*. Hurry to Xu; he has already departed far and cannot stay long—leave at once.”\n\nZhou remained in the capital and stayed with Wang Faming in the Daoist lodge of the Southern Yushu Residence, sleeping in the outer chamber. Was this to consult the wooden divination blocks? That is how he came by this. I told him that many others had inquired about the blocks, but he said nothing in the capital—this matter truly requires discretion.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day, Attendant Tang Zhao arrived and said he had returned to his former residence. Together, we felt a profound emptiness and discussed the Ninefold Refinement at length. And so forth—both lords instructed him to convey this. And so forth. It was the twenty-second or twenty-third day when he returned to the mountain, but he was utterly unwilling to entertain visitors’ questions. No word of the Ninefold Refinement reached me—how lamentable!\n\nThe above six entries were recorded in the second month: five describe encounters, and one a dream.\n\nOn the third day of the third month, I saw the Lord of Longevity, who warned against eating the heart of grass and other matters. And so forth. The *Purple Text of the Immortals’ Taboos* states this, though it refers only to this single day.\n\nOn the eighth day, I saw Attendant Zhao, who spoke of the world’s demonic spirits and urged caution in all things. And so forth.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day, I saw the Lord of Longevity, who warned: “Do not violate the mist and dew.” And so forth.\n\nThe above three entries pertain to the third month, all describing encounters.\n\nOn the ninth day of the fourth month, I saw Attendant Dinglu, who said: “The earlier memorial’s language was most refined, though I fear your heart may not fully align with it.” And so forth. I have not seen the original text of this memorial.\n\nOn the fifteenth day, I saw the Three Attendants and Lord Hong arrive, who said: “We wish to descend to the capital to expel evil, but do not fail to return to the mountains.” The various individuals conversed among themselves, much of it unclear. At that time, I intended to leave the capital to settle matters below, and indeed departed in the sixth month [gap in text].\n\nThe above two entries pertain to the fourth month, both describing encounters.\n\nOn the ninth day of the fifth month, I dreamed of the Lord of Life Span, Attendant Dinglu, the Lord of Longevity, and a host of perfected beings, all of whom tested me regarding matters of karmic obstructions. And so forth. Their countenances were displeased, and they also spoke of concerns about theft, saying they would come to my aid at the time.\n\nOn the fifteenth day, I dreamed of arriving at the Eastern Palace, where I paid respects to the Azure Lord. Though I did not meet the Azure Lord face-to-face, his sentiments were conveyed through messengers, showing great compassion. Lord Han received and conversed with me as usual. Such an account suggests that the previous Lord Han and his retinue were not Huixi.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day, I dreamed of the Three Lords of Life Span, who said: “Previously, we dispatched ten guards from the outer defenses of Red City to assist you, but you were unable to reach the capital.” This passage is written in hasty script and is illegible. It also states: “It may suffice.” I do not understand what this refers to. If it concerns the earlier matter of theft and the promise of aid, then it should not have said, “It may suffice.”\n\nAt that time, the capital was indeed in a state of tranquility.\n\n*(The preceding three entries pertain to events of the fifth month. All were said to have been seen from the first month to this point, written on yellow paper with fine-grade paper for details, totaling four and a half sheets. The first sheet bore a vermilion inscription from the end of the previous year.)*\n\nOn the tenth day of the sixth month, while sleeping on the road, I dreamed of Marshal Fan, who said: “Malevolent spirits rampage unchecked—do not take them lightly. Though they are not human, why should your relations with them be so poor?” And so on.\n\nZhou briefly left the capital on the ninth day of this month at dawn, lodging by the ferry after exiting the mountains. He departed early on the tenth, and by that evening, he should have been near Hushu and Fangshan. He is expected to return within this month, though warm-illnesses have been prevalent of late.\n\nOn the nineteenth day, while at home, I dreamed of abstaining from meat and eating only goose fat—its meaning remains unclear. Upon reviewing this day’s events, I recall that Wang Faming’s son stayed overnight at the guesthouse, and Yanling’s Ji Maoxian also arrived with many provisions. In the food prepared by Guo Yi’s household, goose fat must have been used for frying or boiling.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-eighth day, I dreamed of wandering through the Purple Forbidden Enclosure. And so on.\n\nHere follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe above three entries pertain to matters of the sixth month. One records what was seen, and two record dreams.\n\nOn the first day of the seventh month, I met with Master Hong, who said: \"Beyond the eightfold radiance, your dwelling has already been arranged. There is no need to prepare the bundled herbs.\" And so on—much of it cannot be fully recorded. Herein should be discussed matters of departure and staying, and the gathering of texts.\n\nOn the eighth day, I dreamed again of Marquis Han, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, Master Yang, and the Register of Destiny. Much was said concerning the subtleties of nature and life, tracing the roots of sin and fortune. Had it been written down, it would have filled three or four sheets of paper. Not to have heard it is a deep regret.\n\nOn the seventeenth day, I met with Attendant Zhao of the Preservation of Life. Much was discussed regarding the calamities and disasters of Heaven and Earth—too much to record. The principles of these matters are difficult to expound.\n\nOn the twenty-third day, I saw a gathering of immortals, thirty in all. Much was said on the fundamentals of human cultivation and the methods of averting misfortune. They also discussed the work of the Ninefold Transmutation. And so on. This entry, being unclear, is the deepest regret.\n\nThe above four entries pertain to matters of the seventh month. Three record what was seen, and one records a dream. Since the beginning of the sixth month, all together they fill one large sheet of white *zhan* paper.\n\nFrom the first month to the end of the seventh month of the *bingshen* year, nearly seven months have passed, comprising twenty-eight entries in total. Eighteen record what was seen, and ten record dreams.\n\nThe above is the table of contents. It is written in three colors—black, vermilion, and yellow—on large white and fine paper, totaling sixteen folios: eight white and eight colored.\n\nFrom the initial communication on the twenty-third day of the fifth month of the *yiwei* year to the end of the seventh month of the present *bingshen* year, there are altogether one hundred and nine entries: sixty-three recording what was seen, and forty-six recording dreams.\n\nFrom the eighth month to the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month, when I departed this world, a span of three months, the written records are no longer clearly preserved.\n\nReviewing the entries made month by month since the beginning of this year, I have been careless and do not know if they are complete. Perhaps the times have grown sparse, and so I have not recorded everything.\n\nRecorded by Zhou Ziyang, *The Elixir Formula of the Jade Fluid of the Nine Perfected*.\n\nIt is said to be lighter than the Ninefold Transmutation and easier than the Ninefold Transmutation. This is on a separate sheet, without date.\n\nOne *jin* of the nine-stemmed purple fungus, *langge* zhi. It comes from southern Min, and is also found north of Juqu.\n\nTwo *dou* of cinnabar-red jade nectar. It comes from southern Min, and is also found in this region.\n\nFor the above two ingredients, finely chop the fungus, then soak it overnight in one *dou* of jade nectar. Bury it on the yang side of a shaded wall, three *cun* from the wall and one *chi* deep in the earth. Use a white ceramic vessel holding about four *dou* to contain it, and cover it with a ceramic plate. Seal it tightly with wax, then cover it with two *cun* of earth. Bury it at noon today and retrieve it at noon tomorrow. Carry it southward to a point twelve paces from the door of your dwelling, and place it at the head of a sleeping grove.\n\nFrom the time of retrieval until noon the following day, boil it in a bronze vessel, ensuring the fire is level with the bottom of the vessel and does not flare beyond its edges. After three boilings, add the remaining *dou* of jade nectar, then increase the fire by about five *fen*, using mugwort or thatch as fuel. Reduce it until only one *dou* remains, then dry the dregs and seal the liquid for three days. After three days, open it: a purple radiance should shine forth, visible even at night without lamplight. This indicates the elixir is complete.\n\nNext, place the dregs in a wooden mortar and pound them three hundred and twenty times. Wrap them tightly in paper. If thrown into water, the water will halt in its flow. If used to seal a house, ten thousand men could not open it. If used to bind bandits, a mob could not move. If used to seal a mountain, the mountain will open; if used to seal a person, the person will submit.\n\nIf one wishes to ascend to Heaven swiftly, one may consume both the liquid and the dregs together—though this will result in death. If one wishes to remain in the world for a time, one should consume them gradually, and in the end, one will attain immortality.\n\nDo not share this with others or let anyone witness its use. It may only be known in the heart and consumed in secret. If others learn of it, this medicine will be wasted in vain.\n\nThe above is one formula, without year, month, or day. It is not known when it was written, but it fills one sheet of white *zhan* paper.\n\nRespectfully corrected.\n\nThe name of this medicine is also said to be \"known only in the heart,\" making it difficult to ponder in detail. I have inquired of all those living with me, young and old alike, and none recall seeing the medicine buried within the wall, nor hearing the sound of pounding in the wooden mortar. Perhaps it was prepared elsewhere—no matter. It is said that consuming it results in death, which gives me pause. Even if warm wine is offered, it may be a ruse to confuse.\n\nIn all, there are four volumes of the original text, written in various colors, totaling sixty-five folios, some in standard script, some in cursive.\n\n*Comprehensive Records of the Zhou Clan, Volume Four* ends here.",

      "translated_text": "*The Record of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen*\n*Sutra Title: The Comprehensive Record of Zhou’s Spiritual Communication*\n*Four fascicles. Composed by Tao Hongjing.*\n\n**Fascicle One**\n\nThe transcendent Zhou Ziliang, styled Yuansu, was a disciple of Tao the Recluse of Mount Mao. Originally from Jiqian Village, Du Township, Runan County, Runan Commandery in Yuzhou, he later resided in Qinghua Village, West Township of Jiankang in Danyang. His family was of illustrious lineage, renowned along the Jiangzuo region. In later generations, their fortunes declined, and they fell into hardship.\n\nHis grandfather, Wenlang, was nominated as a Filial and Incorrupt Candidate and served as Left Attendant in the household of the Prince of Jiangxia under the Liu-Song dynasty. His birth father, Yaozong, childhood name Jingang, was Wenlang’s fifth son. Yaozong held the post of Assistant in the Commandery and resided separately in Yuyao. He passed away in the second year of the Tianjian reign (503 CE) at the age of thirty-four and was provisionally interred there.\n\nHis adoptive uncle, Yaoxu, served as Registrar of the Prefecture and later as Consultant in the Yangzhou Administration. His mother, Xu Jingguang of Yongjia, dreamed during her fifth month of pregnancy that all the sages in a celestial chamber rose and circumambulated her from all sides. Thus, on the second day of the first month in the ding-chou year of the Jianwu reign (497 CE), at the hour of *ren ding*, he was born in Mingxing Village, Yuyao.\n\nAt the age of one, he was taken in and raised by his aunt, Baoguang, who treated him as her own son. From childhood, Ziliang was upright and intelligent, his nature gentle and refined. His family never witnessed him display anger. At ten, he followed his adoptive mother back to Yongjia.\n\nIn the seventh year of the Tianjian reign (508 CE), the Recluse journeyed eastward to the sacred mountains. Temporarily residing at Mount Qingzhang in Yongning, the Recluse entered the east. Originally bound for Yuyao, they boarded a sea vessel to Mount Huo in Jin’an. As they descended the Zhe River at dusk, the tide surged, dragging the boat toward Dingshan—a force beyond human control. They thus proceeded to Dongyang, intending to stay in Yongkang. Suddenly, they encountered a man from Yongjia who extolled the beauty of the local mountains and waters, so they followed him to the commandery. There, they sought out Magistrate Lu Xiang of Yongning. Lu personally escorted them to rest at the Hall of the Celestial Master, where Ziliang had already been lodging. Here, they first met. The circumstances of his arrival seemed divinely ordained, as if summoned by numinous spirits. Otherwise, the reason would remain unfathomable.\n\nAt the time, Ziliang was twelve years old. He sought to enter the mountain, submit to discipline, and become a disciple. He first received *The Register of Immortals and Spirits*, *The Five Thousand Character Scripture of Laozi*, and *The Talisman of the Western Marchmount for Suppressing Tigers and Leopards*, thereafter devoting himself wholeheartedly to the duties of incense and lamp offerings. Whatever he took interest in—calligraphy, painting, or miscellaneous arts—he mastered with focused attention.\n\nLater, he followed the Recluse to Southern Huo. Upon returning to Muliu, he served with utmost reverence and diligence, day and night.",

Thereafter, he advanced to receive *The Charts of the Five Marchmounts* and *The Esoteric Writings of the Three Sovereigns*.\n\nIn the autumn of the twelfth year, his maternal relatives came to reside in the mountains, so he moved out to dwell separately in a western hermitage. On the summer solstice of the fourteenth year, the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the *yiwei* cyclical year, he suddenly fell into a deep sleep at noon in the hermitage. After a long while, he arose and emerged. His aunt, not understanding the reason, pressed him severely. He then recounted in detail what he had seen, as recorded separately.\n\nFrom then on, for forty or fifty days, he felt profoundly altered. He constantly lowered the blinds, shut the doors, and barred others from entering his chamber, burning incense in solitude. At midday, he consumed only a *sheng* of honey. His family had long worshipped common spirits, and his maternal uncle and Daoist companions all feared this was a deception by mundane deities or suspected he had been afflicted by perverse *qi*. They repeatedly questioned him in alarm, but he only replied: \"Perhaps it was merely a dream of *vārttā*—I know nothing for certain.

      "translated_text": "On the twenty-ninth day, he was interred at dusk, and a tomb of fine jade was constructed on the eastern ridge. On the third day of the eleventh month, the *bingyin* day, he was again interred at dusk, and earth was heaped to form the grave. Thereafter, his voice and form vanished into silence, leaving no trace in waking or dream—was this the boundary between man and spirit, a moment awaiting its time?\n\nThe origins of his attainment of the Dao and his posthumous title are fully recorded in the *Account* he received, while the present text briefly outlines his deeds in this world as witnessed and heard, hence its placement before the *Account*.\n\nThat same day, four sealed letters were found upon his writing desk, their seals and covers damp. One was for his master, one for his stepmother and maternal aunt, one for his uncle Xu Puming, and a large one—containing four sheets—for the Daoists of the Southern Lodge and Eastern Mountain. All were farewells, each dated the twenty-seventh. Judging by this, he must have returned from Zhuyang and written them then. After finishing the letters, he burned incense.\n\nUpon inspection, the warm wine pot still held the usual scent of alcohol, but the clay basin had been rinsed with water, leaving no trace of qi, nor any sign of medicine. The cause remained unfathomable. A prescription was later found in the *Account*, leading some to suspect it might have been the one. His master, lamenting the matter, regretted not having examined the letters sooner. Now, others meticulously searched through chests and boxes, hoping to find the lost *Account*, yet not a single note remained. Fortunately, it was recalled that on the sixteenth day, he had burned two bundles of writings—over a hundred sheets—allowing no one to see them. It was suspected these had all been destroyed, deepening the sorrow, which lingered unresolved.\n\nOn the first day of the eleventh month, the *jiazi* day, a trial journey was made to the cave at Yankou Mountain, where a large sealed letter was indeed found. Climbing the rugged slope, it was retrieved with a hook, and upon returning, it was opened with reverence. It contained instructions received five months prior, detailing only four matters after the Summer Solstice, with June and July fully recorded. From August onward to the seventh month of this year, entries ceased. The table of contents briefly listed events, merely noting their occurrence, leaving it unclear whether other matters—like those of June and July—had been omitted or simply not recorded in full. Perhaps they were intentionally left unelaborated. How could one know?\n\nIn the first few dozen days after his descent, he had found leisure and tranquility, but later, entangled in worldly affairs and the burdens of kinship, he could not escape others’ notice. What he committed to paper was only the barest outline. One can only imagine how much instruction he must have given in those ten-odd months—what a pity it was not inquired after! This was his master’s failing.\n\nThe sealed letters contained scattered and disordered papers, now arranged in chronological order. From the eighth to the tenth month of this year, not a single entry was found. As for the burned writings, they were surely of a different kind, for he would not have incinerated them one by one. Perhaps they were texts meant to remain hidden.\n\nPreviously, only a few matters had been disclosed to his master and maternal aunt. The first was his midday nap on the Summer Solstice, which drew strange rebukes from within and without, leaving him no choice but to explain. The second was his refusal to eat dried meat, which also provoked suspicion, forcing an explanation. The third was the true decree to change from vermilion to ink when jointly petitioning for rain, which he could not conceal. The fourth was the decree to halt his master’s summons, which he was instructed to reveal. These were the only clear instances. For all other inquiries, he remained evasive, never issuing explicit commands.\n\nEarlier, after his master had perused the scriptures once, he had declined further visits and moved to Zhuyang. Later, when matters arose, he was repeatedly questioned and answered, but as he did not always respond, no replies were recorded, and thus nothing was made known. Now, upon reflection, it seems certain there were answers. Perhaps he feared that responding would invite endless requests, while silence would draw reproach. To answer fully would risk exposing hidden decrees, so he concealed them all.\n\nThe *Account* contains many taboo names of true immortals and various teachings, akin to sacred scriptures. It must be approached with the same reverence: washing hands, donning clean robes, burning incense, and only then reading it. If one wishes to copy it, one must first inform the assembled immortals and adepts—it is not to be treated like ordinary writings.\n\nAround the dwelling where he resided, the courtyard altar was shaded by several large *xiang* trees. The one before the door was especially lush. On the fifteenth day of the twelfth month in the *jiawu* year, something like sugar was suddenly seen scattered all over the tree, with the middle portion particularly dense. Around dusk, Ding Jingda, the lecturer of Huayang, came to visit Xu Puming and witnessed it as well, asking in astonishment. Seeing this sweet dew descend, the household wished to conceal the matter and jested, “The children must have poured sugar on it.” They tasted it together—it was like honey—and hastily broke off two branches to display, hanging them on the door curtain, where they remained for over ten days. According to the *Illustrated Record of Auspicious Omens*, sweet dew falling on bamboo and *wu* trees is a sign of propitious qi. Upon reflection, of all the trees near the altar, only this one before the door was so luxuriant—surely this was meant to reveal that divine spirits had descended to guide him.\n\nTo the south of the dwelling, a covered walkway was flanked by bamboo planted on both sides, their roots creeping beneath the veranda. On the eighteenth day of the fifth month in the *yiwei* year, he and his uncle Xu Puming were in the main hall conducting a three-day grand vegetarian feast for the Xie family. After its conclusion, during the dispersal of the fast, Xu Puming briefly returned to the dwelling. Suddenly, he saw a bamboo shoot sprouting from the roots beneath the walkway, already over three inches tall and split into two stalks, both shooting up with tender shoots nine inches long. Yesterday, nothing had been there—now, it had appeared in an instant. Xu Puming, recognizing the marvel, feared his young nephew might pluck it, so he broke it off and brought it to the main hall, showing it to all the Daoists, who gasped in amazement, having never seen the like. The recluse deeply regretted not letting it grow into bamboo and, fearing it would rot, dried it by fire. It remains preserved to this day.",

Though he built three modest chambers, the work remained unfinished for some time. By the tenth month of this year, he had quietly completed it himself, arranging windows, doors, and curtains. On the nineteenth, he invited his relatives and Daoist companions to contribute to its furnishing. Those who came to inspect it sensed his concealed form and sidelong demeanor, yet",

      "translated_text": "Examining bamboo, it is the essence of stars, often manifesting numinous efficacy. The people of Xiangzhou craft \"united-heart bamboo,\" all awaiting the emergence of shoots, then carving notches into the sides to form openings—thus, a single stalk may bear four, yet this remains one bamboo, merely hollowed at the center on both sides. Never before has there been a bamboo that splits into two shoots from a single root, each standing apart. On the twenty-third day of this month, the summer solstice, this portent descended, surely signifying a hidden resonance of harmonious union, bearing the virtue of the parasol bamboo.\n\nMoreover, Zhou Yi Zhu, a yang-dwelling official, had a house built in the east. Stacked thatch lay in the northeast of the house, and behind it, remnants of thatch covered the rear. When Zhou went to gather and restack it, he suddenly saw a white tortoise, about six inches long, its body, shell, and skin smooth as talc, save for four black markings on its back resembling written characters, though indecipherable. He caught it and played with it for some time, then wished to take it home but dared not, so he released it. Upon returning, he told his family of this.\n\nNow, the tortoise is inherently a spiritually potent creature, long-lived and prescient, and it emerged from beneath the stacked thatch, seemingly to manifest the numen of Tea Ridge. Generally, white creatures are all considered divine marvels. When the recluse heard of this, he wished to record it for posterity, but upon further search, it was no longer to be found. Nearby Daoists often spoke of a white tortoise in Willow Valley that would vanish whenever someone tried to take it. It is suspected this tortoise was the same, though its appearance in the thatch pile several hundred paces from his home remains a mystery.\n\nThe above is recalled in retrospect, as I remember these two extraordinary events recorded in the annals.

As I was then observing purification rites, I had no means to report it immediately. Now, I have meticulously compiled the recent events into four scrolls, as separately presented, and humbly offer them for Your Majesty’s perusal.\n\nYet, I remain entangled in the webs of doubt and delusion, having failed to awaken to the truth sooner. In hindsight, I reproach myself deeply, and fear my negligence may incur severe censure. I have recounted the details in full, and prostrate myself, beseeching Your Majesty’s forbearance for my lapses.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\nThe sixteenth day of the twelfth month.\n\n---\n\nUpon reviewing the memorial and examining the relics left by the Zhou family, the revealed truths are manifest, their signs and confirmations aligning with earlier prophecies. The clarity of these two or three matters is all the more extraordinary. The four scrolls are now retained here, and the details are fully recorded in the accompanying text, inspiring only greater admiration.\n\nThe twentieth day of the eleventh month.\n\n*Divine Brush*\n\n---\n\nWhen the Zhou matter first arose, I was in seclusion at Yugang, observing the Leaf-Limited Fast, and thus could not report it at once. Only after completing the posthumous records did I dispatch Pan Zhongzheng to present the memorial. It was received in the inner palace, where the four scrolls were unsealed and read in full. Every detail was scrutinized, and questions were posed on each matter, to which I responded accordingly.\n\n*Account of the Zhou Transmission*\n\n---\n\nThe fifth-month affair was transcribed exactly as it occurred. There was a recluse who instructed Zhu to annotate the imperial edict.\n\nOn the day of the Summer Solstice, a little before noon—specifically, the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the fourteenth year of the Tianjian era (the year *yimao*, *bingzi*)—I was resting in the southern woods of my residence. As I awoke, I had Shansheng lower the curtain. At the time, I was staying in the western chamber of my aunt’s residence, where she was afflicted with ringworm. Shansheng was the son of my two aunts, originally surnamed Zhu. At the age of seven, he fell gravely ill in Yongjia for over ten days, nearing death, when I intervened to save him and took him in as a disciple of the Dao.\n\nBefore I had fully settled into sleep, I suddenly beheld a man standing nearly seven *chi* tall, with a small face, fierce mouth and nose, thick brows, and a sparse beard. His complexion was pale with a bluish tint, and he appeared to be around forty. He wore a crimson robe with red shoes, his cap adorned with cicada-shaped ornaments and long, trailing ribbons. A purple leather belt, about seven *cun* wide, encircled his waist, from which hung a brush-case shaped like a dragon’s head. His shoes, dyed black and purple, made a rustling sound as he walked. Twelve attendants followed him.",

      "translated_text": "Two of the attendants wore their hair in topknots, styled like those of the elderly women of Yongjia. This knot was bound loosely at the roots, the ends hanging down to the forehead. They wore purple robes with green trousers, their shoes loosely tied to the trousers, the bindings exceedingly slack. Three others were clad in purple trousers, their jackets gathered with flat-folded headscarves. Each held a bamboo slip, inscribed with characters that could not be deciphered. The remaining seven all wore white cloth trousers, their jackets tucked into their shoes, each carrying something in hand. One bore a sitting mat, another a *ruyi* scepter, and a third a five-colored feather fan. One carried a large scroll of books, another held paper and brush along with a large inkstone—black in color, the brush no different from those of the world. Another grasped a *jiao*, its form resembling a feather or variegated silk, mottled and lovely. The *jiao* was round and deep, its handle black and exceedingly long. After entering the room, they leaned it against the eaves. Two others each carried a satchel, as large as a small pillar, seemingly filled with documents.\n\nThe one bearing the mat unfurled it upon the book stand. The mat was white, luminous, its weave like that of a fine rush mat, though its strands were coarser. Six attendants entered the room and stood before the low table. As the man entered, he frowned and said, \"This is far too close.\" He then took his seat, resting his arm upon the book stand. At that moment, the brush and the ruler—about a *chi* in length—lay upon the stand. He took them and placed them within the inner frame, then moved the frame to the northern end.\n\nThe room he occupied was the west wing, consisting of two chambers, separated from the main hall by only three bays of a veranda. He had remarked it was too close, perhaps because it was pressed near the hall, though the hall had already been burned to the ground. It was unclear what he meant by \"too close.\" The room faced east, with a door on its northern side. A five-*chi* sleeping couch stood against the western wall—this was where I had been napping.

He had previously followed a recluse back to the mountains but had since departed.\n\nThe visitor then said to Ziliang, \"Your father once committed minor transgressions, but they were absolved three years ago, and he now dwells in a place of peace. He claims his tomb lies in Yue. Though he has wandered far, he does not wish to have it moved. There is a pit to the south—it should be filled. He had intended to come with me, but unfinished matters of documents prevented him. Next spring, he will be reborn into a royal household, for his past transgressions are not yet fully exhausted, and so he must return to the world. You originally planned to retrieve your father’s coffin in the year *jiawu* and bring it west, but the matter did not come to pass. The Zhou family is of the *jiao* lineage; after this year, when the years *shen* and *you* have passed, we may discuss it again. It was your father who did not permit the move, and thus he informed me.\"\n\nZiliang went to verify this and indeed found the pit, which had already been filled.\n\nThe visitor said, \"In your past life, you were blessed to encounter the true Dharma. In this life, you have not lost the heart of a human or a spirit. According to the records, your great fate still extends forty-six years. Truly, while living as a man, one clings to the world, but as a spirit after death, one lingers in the unseen realm. If we speak plainly, the unseen realm is superior. There is now a vacancy in the prefecture, and I wish to appoint you to fill it. The details are nearly settled—say no more. Next year, in the tenth month, you will be summoned. Prepare in advance, for I have come to inform you. If you do not accept this appointment, the writs of the Three Offices will arrive—take heed.\"\n\nZiliang’s face showed fear.\n\nThe visitor said, \"You hasten to remain in the world and accumulate transgressions—how could you be fit to assume a post in my grotto-realm? Facing the celestial perfected, roaming the sacred precincts—you should know there is no place in the world more exalted than this.\"\n\nZiliang then replied, \"I can only defer to your guidance.\"\n\nThe visitor continued, \"From your youth until now, you have not been without minor faults. Reflect upon them and repent. If you do not, they will become a burden upon you. All who cultivate the Dao must not go naked or bare their topknots, nor harm the innocent without cause. In all matters of conduct, eating, and drinking, you must adhere to the regulations. I have told you this much—my words end here. Now return to your duties.

Your aunt was reciting the *Three Ones of the Yellow Court*, making offerings to the *Wei Transmission*, the *Su Transmission*, the *Five Marchmounts*, and the *Five Talismans of the Three Sovereigns*.

The mass in her abdomen may yet improve suddenly, but I will speak of this to you another time.\"\n\n\"The earlier remark about matters implicating the household’s master referred to your aunt—thus I spoke of her illness without waiting for your inquiry.

Though its duties are minor, its rank is lofty and its purity esteemed; ideally, it should be held by two or three who enjoy the patronage of the Perfected Immortals of the lineage. Your earlier responses to the minister were not at all displeasing. Why then did you later disagree with your aunt, thereby allowing the daily administrators to report the matter and inform the minister? Suspecting you of lapsing into heterodox customs, the minister was deeply displeased and wished to charge you with the offense of faithlessness—hence my dispatch to deliver this warning.\n\nI observe that your worldly attachments remain unsevered, and the clamor of dust easily leads you astray. Why do you indulge the seven *po* while constraining the three *hun*? Truly, this stems from your long entanglement with the affairs of the silk-clan households—petty practitioners who boast of their merits to delude others, as if you were one of their flock. Had your earlier judgment not faltered, your name would not have been inscribed on the black tally.\n\nThe Zhou family’s ancestral rites are those of common gods—prayers and vulgar invocations, the very way of the silk-clan. Even Master Xu, when tested, spoke thus. Your maternal grandmother, née Du, was a great shamaness, and her influence lingers. Your mother’s family, the Xus, were once Daoist libationers, and your aunt converted her father’s branch to the Way. Thus, I feared only that you might be ensnared by vulgar spirits.

      "translated_text": "Since you have not yet grasped the true purport, it is only natural that doubts persist.\n\nZiliang said: \"I once harbored doubts, but how dare I now dissent?\"\n\nThe Marshal replied: \"The sacred and numinous have their own principles—how could they be debated in mere words? Moreover, you once served as Prefect overseeing Wu and Yue, entrusted with great responsibilities. When proclamations were issued, how could you refuse to comply? Your late father also petitioned me, claiming no heir remained, but I did not permit it. Even when he appeared in the netherworld to plead in person, I did not relent. Now, with a corpse defiled by death, how could a mere written petition suffice? Even if it reached me, I would not grant it—wasting only paper and ink. At the time, your aunt wished to submit a memorial and draft a petition on your behalf, so I spoke thus to put an end to it.\n\nYou burn incense day and night, praying for immortality and transcendence. Now that your wish has been granted, what more do you seek? As for the Second Perfected, he has journeyed to the Palace of Grand Primordial and has not yet returned. When he does, I fear he will question you, so I have sent him ahead to verify. You may answer according to your heart.\n\nYour elder brother, the Second Lord, is the Great Director of Destinies and a Perfected of Grand Primordial, governing the Crimson City of Great Huo. He likely departed for his audience there on the summer solstice and has not yet returned.\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"I am but an unlearned layman, unable to discern truth from falsehood. I humbly beg your indulgence and dare not dissent.\"\n\nThe Marshal said plainly: \"Good.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Each time you perform your rites, first complete the ceremonial obeisances to the four directions as prescribed, then bow to the Three Perfected Lords—Director of Destinies, Recorder of Deeds, and Guardian of Life. Since you reside in the countryside, this is proper.\"\n\nAt that moment, Ziliang had placed his clogs crosswise before the general’s seat and was lying down without his robe. The Marshal said: \"As a Daoist, it is improper to sleep exposed or to place clogs crosswise. If clogs are laid crosswise, evil spirits will not fear you.\"\n\nZiliang assented.\n\nThe precepts warn: \"When removing shoes, place them with the heels aligned and toes pointing outward.\" This is the reason. All Daoists should always wear sleeping robes, resembling short unlined garments. It is also forbidden to sleep with the topknot unbound.\n\nZiliang then asked: \"Since the numinous ones have deigned to instruct me, might I humbly request an extension of several years?\"\n\nThe Marshal replied: \"Lower your voice—others may hear. Earlier, we discussed your doubts, and the Director of Destinies has already been informed. Now that I have come to verify, you still seek an extension. I fear word may reach the throne, so I tell you to lower your voice—not necessarily because I fear others hearing.\"\n\nAt that time, Zizao was also sleeping in a separate grove. The Marshal added: \"What was previously requested cannot be granted. Your fate is already fixed, and this office cannot remain vacant for long. That is why I have come again in earnest—solely for this reason. Now, I speak to you privately—do not disclose it.\n\nSince you lack the arts of deliverance, you must still secure a proper resting place for your remains. Only south of the great ridge, in the land of your ancestral gardens, may you find a suitable burial site. If that area is too stony, examine the left side of Mount Liangchang in the north—there should be good earth. Do not return to the original site. The original plot is defiled by worldly filth and overgrown with weeds; if buried there, it will bring you no benefit.\"\n\nI have never determined where the gardens south of the ridge lie. Liangchang is some ten *li* northeast of Zhuyang, its ridges extending to this region, yet I have never heard of anyone surveying the land. Today, in haste, you have chosen this eastern ridge for the tomb. Later, upon reviewing these records, you will recall that on the eighth day of the eleventh month last year, the Recorder of Deeds declared: \"Building a house where divination for burial was conducted is inauspicious.\"\n\nWhen the house was first constructed, you wished to site it near the eastern grove, but the recluse objected, finding the grove too large and distant. Now you have returned to the western slope. Clearly, the current burial site aligns with the earlier directive, though it does not match this marshal’s mention of Liangchang, it accords with the Recorder of Deeds’ divination on burial.\n\nSince you lack the arts of deliverance and must secure a resting place for your remains, this corpse will not return. Thus, I have sought a good burial site in cold earnest. The rest of the coffin and burial rites may follow worldly customs.\n\nAll the scriptures and talismans you have received may accompany you, but their divine guardians will require the names of your three masters, along with the year and month of your ordination. The Three Officials and water spirits may question you again—you must be prepared to answer, not left speechless. Leave instructions for your family to do the same, for this is following the master’s teachings.\n\nYou have inscribed *The Five Peaks Chart*, *The Transmission of the Three Sovereigns*, and various scriptures and talismans, stating they should be worn on your person. But I do not know who your three masters are—does this refer to the master of registration, the master of ordination, and the master of scriptures, or simply three generations of successive masters? I never inquired further, but scriptural records state that when a person’s life ends, whether they become immortal or ghost, they must pass through the Three Officials, all of whom require verification of lineage. Thus, the bond between master and disciple is not easily formed.\n\nI now depart—do not forget this proof. Though your fate is fixed, you must still exercise caution. True caution repels dark evil, and divine spirits will guard and protect you, making it easier to attract blessings. Since you dwell amid worldly dust, we cannot return often.\"\n\nThen, pointing to the peach-and-bamboo decoction written on the wall, he said: \"If you feel unwell, bathe according to this formula. How did you come by this prescription?\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"I copied it from the *True Reports*.\"\n\nThe Marshal said: \"This was what the Southern Perfected revealed to Yang and Xu—you have obtained it well. The Second Lord also marked it as outstanding.\"\n\nBefore his words ended, Ziping awoke, and the Marshal departed.\n\nThis passage records the instructions received on the summer solstice night, densely written on a large sheet of hemp paper.\n\nThis Marshal Fan is the Guardian of Life, one of the Four Ghost Marshals. His name is Fan Jiangwu, the foremost of the four, as recorded in the *True and Unadorned*. However, the reason he refers to himself as \"I\" and addresses others as \"you\" remains unclear.\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day, during the second watch, I opened my eyes to see a figure standing before me. His appearance was dignified, with a full beard, fine brows and eyes, and an age of perhaps twenty-odd. His face was most pleasing.

      "translated_text": "The figure claimed to be from Zhongshan, and said: \"Master Mao has appointed you as his chancellor. He has already sent the chancellor-marshal to inform you, and the matter is settled. I have now come to teach you the method of cultivating the Dao. You may follow my instructions and draft a memorial to Ziliang, then begin writing it on paper.\"\n\nThis occurred on the twenty-seventh day of the fifth month. Upon seeing Ziliang record the date, the figure smiled and said: \"Noting the month is good, but as the years grow distant, those who see it later will not know which era it refers to.\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"The previous chancellor-marshal’s arrival was already recorded by year. Now, I only need—\" The figure then said: \"Recording it on paper is best.\"\n\nZiliang thus wrote four characters below: \"The year of *yǐwèi* under the Great Year Star.\"\n\nAccording to this figure’s words, he was clearly not bound to the mortal world, yet the reason for concealing the *Zhou* seals and caches remains unclear. His intent seemed to be that the transmission should not be freely disseminated. The earlier accounts of Yang and Xu were also of this nature.\n\nThose who become Daoist practitioners must first understand the essentials of longevity. If one cannot yet feast on rosy clouds and drink the radiance of the sun and moon, or discipline oneself to seek the truth, then remaining in the world is of no benefit to the body. The reason for summoning you now is twofold: first, to assist in timely affairs, and second, to receive instruction for cultivating the body. Over time, you may gain its power. Only when the five viscera are whole and the marrow is full can one truly seek the Dao. Now, your four limbs are weak and emaciated, your spirit and essence obstructed. The true destiny cannot be awaited in haste, but you may observe the two stars once or twice daily to establish a connection.\n\nZiliang then asked: \"I do not know where these stars are located or what they look like.\"\n\nThe figure replied: \"The Northern Dipper has nine stars, but only seven are visible, while two remain hidden. Observe them on the twenty-seventh day of the month or the third day of the new moon. Their forms will shine with exceptional brilliance. You may now draw the seven stars, and I will vaguely indicate their orientation.\"\n\nZiliang dipped his brush and sketched the seven stars. The figure said: \"I cannot move my hands freely. Simply place the two stars at the head of the Dipper’s handle, and I will tell you.\"\n\nAfter arranging them, Ziliang asked again, but the figure did not answer, nor did he respond to a second inquiry. Only after adjusting the planchette and asking once more did the figure reply: \"This is correct. When observing, burn incense, compose your mind, and wait. If they appear, make your prayers and express your wishes—there will be other signs, which I will explain later. Tonight, during the third or fourth watch, you may try observing them, but do not let others know. If others are present during the observation, the stars will not appear.\"\n\nThe figure then said: \"I will now depart. Do not lightly reveal this to others. There are also scriptures in the world, but you have the karmic affinity to receive this oral transmission.\" Without a sound of the door opening, he lingered and then vanished.\n\nThe above account was received on the night of the twenty-seventh day. It was recorded in a large ledger, with white hemp paper joined together to fill the page.\n\nAccording to the *Separate Record*, this man from Zhongshan was surnamed Hong, named Zijuan. Originally from Mount Song, he had now come to Huayang, though his position was not made clear. Later, he also transmitted the *Cavern Chamber Sutra* orally from the Northern Lord. He was accustomed to instructing disciples. However, this person does not appear in the *True Reports*.\n\nThe method of observing the two stars of the Northern Dipper is found in the *Fangzhu Cavern Scripture*. Zhou had never before glimpsed the upper scriptures. His nature was cautious and upright, and he did not seek or request them. He regretted deeply that he could not obtain all the essential scriptures or meet the true instructions of Yang and Xu. Though he could no longer undertake this important task, he felt a deficiency in his devotion to his master.\n\nThese three entries were all from dreams, not entirely clear. In another dream, he saw towering cliffs and sheer walls, lush and verdant as if within a green cicada’s shell. Below the mountain, he looked up and saw two figures above: one wore a *yuanyou* cap and embroidered robes, and seemed to be the Lord of Life Preservation; the other sat high above, resembling Laozi, engaged in conversation with the first. Zhou could not understand their words. After a moment, he awoke, never knowing where the two had gone afterward.\n\nThe above was recorded from a dream during a daytime nap on the twenty-eighth day, written on two small sheets of white paper.\n\nUpon reviewing the records, those marked as \"dreams\" were visions seen during sleep, while entries stating \"on such-and-such a day, such-and-such an event was seen\" were witnessed while fully awake, though it was unclear whether he was seated or outside.\n\nFrom the eighth month of the *yǐwèi* year onward, he traveled to various places, but these were journeys of the spirit while his body remained still.\n\nIn many of the records, characters were hastily altered, likely due to the urgency of receiving the instructions and later recalling and revising them. Yang Jun had often done the same.\n\nThe above covers events from the twenty-third to the twenty-eighth day of the fifth month, comprising four entries, written on eight sheets of large and small white paper. All correspond to the catalog without omission.\n\n*Record of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen, Scroll One* concludes.\n\n[Note: The character \"弟\" appears to be superfluous. #2 The character \"其\" likely should be \"甚.\" The character \"浩\" likely should be \"拙.\"]\n\n*Record of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen, Scroll Two: Sixth Month Affairs*",

The objects they held remained unchanged. He settled onto a mat, seated beneath the southern grove.\n\nTwo youths, both around fifteen or sixteen, appeared beside him. Their forms and garments were radiant, each wearing twin topknots. Their robes seemed single-layered, yet resembled embroidered silk without being so.\n\nThe assistant spoke:\n*\"The appointed day draws near—no cause for doubt.\"*\n\nPointing to the youth on the east, he said:\n*\"This is the Jade Youth of Huayang.

The heart that schemes for glory—how could it harbor thoughts of divine transcendence? Your mind is free of stagnant thoughts, your breast unclouded; thus, your success is swift. Without this emptiness and clarity, one might pursue a single aim without attainment, advance without turning back—could such a one achieve the Dao? You possess no renowned talent or learning, nor the beauty of supreme virtue. Yet you seek the green hues of fate, and though burdened by minor transgressions, your heart remains unburdened—this is why you have succeeded. Do not cling to the mundane, linger among kin and acquaintances, or yearn for wealth and sensual pleasures. These are but mountains of accumulated sin, cauldrons that boil the self. Reflect deeply on these words; do not take them lightly as mere amusement. If you transcribe this faithfully, the Way of Immortality will be fulfilled.\"*\n\nSomeone then asked:\n*\"What of Tao’s talent and discernment?\"*\n\nThe reply came:\n*\"His virtue and conduct run deep—none in this world compare.\"*\n\nAnother asked:\n*\"Yet I fear his karmic conditions may not suffice—what then?\"*\n\nThe Ziyang Youth responded:\n*\"Your words echo those of Ziyang. The Way of Immortals is easily attained, but human virtue is difficult to perfect. Though the two paths diverge, their boundaries remain blurred. The true Dao may be heard but not seen; the human path may be seen but its practices are rarely heard. As for humanity, all are driven by greed, cruelty, deceit, and desire, indulging their passions without restraint. Thus, the Three Evils never leave their hearts, and the Five Passions remain unchecked in their bodies—all due to the weight of sins sown in past lives. If one is born in the Central Kingdom, aware of the Dao and virtue, with a complete human form, bright talent, and steadfast conduct, it is because of the blessings of past lives.\"*\n\nThe transmission of the Lord’s words seemed to end here.\n\n*\"In a past life, you were already born into the Zhou household, a descendant of the Lord.

Once he began to experience spiritual communion, he would miss the appointed times for writing talismans and was also careless in his work. His aunt reproached and scolded him severely, saying: \"Even a household dog must guard, bark, and chase rats. You, having been taken in, fail to provide proper service—merely transcribing talismans and copying texts without care. What use are you?\"\n\nAt the time, his expression was deeply troubled. Now, this admonition has come to pass, and its source lies therein. His aunt, considering him young and prone to serving others, feared his mistakes and thus reprimanded him frequently. Thereafter, whenever he was scolded, he would rejoice, smile, and immediately bathe, to the astonishment of all, young and old. Yet in the presence of his masters, he never once displayed resentment in word or countenance.\n\nNow, the cases of Wenchang and Shaolian serve as warnings. They are equal in the principle of being among the three [realms of existence].\n\nOn the night of the sixth day of the sixth month, a man appeared, his attire impeccable. He wore a cinnabar robe, a green cloak, and a lotus crown, upon which rested a small flat parasol, green with a purple border. On his back hung three green bells. He appeared to be in his twenties, his complexion fair, with a slight beard. Four attendants accompanied him—two men and two women.\n\nAfter a long while, he spoke: \"I am Deng Lingqi, the Immortal of Tongwu.

Those who would deliver you will come of their own accord. I have come merely to praise your karmic virtue and to form a bond with you.

      "translated_text": "Following the later separate record, Deng was first appointed as the Prime Minister of Tongwu, serving as the Imperial Canopy-Bearing Censor and overseeing Huayang, where he studied the arts of immortality and observed the prohibitions. This is not found in the *Zhen’gao*.\n\nThe statement \"Others from Tongwu will come again\" refers to Xu Xuanzhen, who would arrive later.\n\nOn the night of the eighth day of the sixth month, the Purple Yang Youth arrived, dressed as before. He asked, \"Do you wish to know my surname and given name?\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"I would be honored to hear them.\"\n\nThe youth said, \"My original surname is Wang, my given name Ziqian, and I am from Taiyuan. In a past life, my father was the Prefect of Chenliu, and we later moved to Danyang. I transformed at the age of fifteen. Due to the blessings of my former life, I was born as a human and, having further cultivated merit, died to become a spirit, serving as the Jade Youth of the Purple Yang Inner Palace. I was granted the surname Feng and the given name Yunzhi. Today, you shall change your name to Taixuan, with the style Xuling.\"\n\n(Whenever the youth referred to \"you,\" he meant Ziyang.)\n\n\"Do not change your surname; it shall remain Zhou. These names and styles carry profound meanings, which I shall briefly explain. *Tai* signifies the ultimate origin, its essence embodying truth. *Xuan* refers to the blackness of the void, a distinction bestowed by fate, not something attained through self-cultivation or merit. *Xu* denotes a form akin to the transient, a mind unburdened by trivial attachments, aligning with the true in desolation. *Ling* signifies one who, while in the world, communes with spirits and, upon leaving it, becomes a numinous being. This reflects the success of your inner and outer cultivation, which shall nourish your descendants. Such is a brief outline of its principles. There are deeper mysteries yet to be revealed, which cannot be disclosed now. Do not use this name in the world, nor reveal it to others.\n\nYour style, Yuansu, is a fine name for this life, though it is not meant for worldly use—it is only to be employed in the unseen realm.\"\n\nWith these words, he departed.\n\nThe above was a record of the revelation received on the night of the eighth day, transcribed on a sheet of white rattan paper.\n\nZiliang’s brothers all bore names with the character *zi*. Ziliang was given this name by his father at birth, with no other childhood name. The style *Yuanci* was bestowed upon him at the age of seventeen in the *gui-si* year, when he underwent the capping ceremony on the eastern ridge of Huayang. He received it after burning incense and making an offering to his teacher.\n\nAccording to the later record, the name he was given corresponds to the jade script of the Azure Register, and his Zhou surname was retained for this purpose.\n\nOn the night of the ninth day of the sixth month, Ziliang dreamed he heard a voice, though no figure was visible. The voice was lofty and stern, saying, \"If you don the purple mantle and wander leisurely in secluded chambers, this is the beginning of the path to immortality.\" These were the only words spoken, but their intent suggested they came from a spirit of the Definite Register, a hidden message for him.\n\nAwakening suddenly, he saw the former Attendant. The Attendant asked, \"Did you recognize the one who just spoke?\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"I did not.\"\n\nThe Attendant said, \"It was a Perfected One. It is not yet time for you to see him, so he spoke to you from afar.\"\n\n(Previously in Huayang, only the Attendant and the youth had come, and neither of these two lords had descended. This hidden message marked the beginning of such visitations.)\n\nThe Attendant then asked, \"Did you smell the scent of blood?\"\n\nZiliang answered, \"I did not.\"\n\nThe Attendant said, \"Your body flows with blood, yet you remain unaware. You claim to have no blood, only sweat.\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"I thought it was merely sweat.\"\n\nThe Attendant said, \"What difference is there between sweat and blood? Sweat is the essence of blood. Human blood is like water—cold, it congeals; in summer, it clarifies. When clear, it flows; when easily congealed, it bursts forth like ice, and blood appears. Your reservoirs are shallow and weak, so the flow cannot be stopped. Human blood is like deep water: it is not troubled by excess, only by depletion. I possess the art of fortifying the reservoirs. I shall treat you. For now, await the embrace of the radiant blossom, which will bring subtle improvement.\"\n\n\"I shall take my leave now, for someone else has arrived.\"\n\nHe descended from his seat and vanished.\n\nImmediately, a man entered, accompanied by three attendants. Approaching Ziliang, he said, \"I am Zhang Xiao, styled Zian, from Li Jing in Rongyang.\" With these words, he disappeared. He appeared to be around thirty, wearing a purple square cap and embroidered robes, likely a lofty immortal.\n\nThe above was a record of the dream and revelation received on the night of the ninth day, transcribed on a sheet of white rattan paper.\n\nAccording to the separate record, Zhang Zian was the master of the Xiaoxian Hall in Huayang, a detail not found in the *Zhen’gao*.\n\nOn the night of the eleventh day of the sixth month, a woman arrived. She emerged from the ridge, her appearance graceful and lovely, with a large topknot and a flowing cyan robe. She said, \"Tonight, four individuals from the Yi-Qian realm intended to visit your dwelling, but since I am already here, they will not come. They shall arrive on the nineteenth day instead.\"\n\nZiliang said, \"I was accompanying my teacher here and did not know there would be a visitation tonight. If I return to my dwelling to await them, would that be acceptable?\"\n\nThe woman replied, \"Since you are already here and it is late, there is no need to return, lest others grow suspicious. You need not mention that I came here tonight.\"\n\nZiliang asked, \"May I know your surname and given name?\"\n\nThe woman said, \"My surname is Li, my given name Feihua. I am from Huaiyin and have been in the Yi-Qian realm for ninety-four years. Though I began my studies long ago, I have not yet attained advancement. I have come tonight at the behest of Lady Zhao.\"\n\nShe then took her leave, saying, \"I shall meet you on the nineteenth day at the Western Slope.\"\n\nZiliang bowed and parted from her.\n\nThe woman appeared to be around twenty-three or twenty-four, and two others accompanied her, though only she spoke. One was likely her attendant.\n\nThe above was a record of the revelation received on the night of the eleventh day, transcribed on a sheet of white rattan paper.\n\nOn this day, the teacher left Bingwan and ascended the mountain. He returned to the eastern ridge after sunset. Zhou Xun entered Ziliang’s dwelling at dusk and stayed the night. At that time, within the ice-mouth chamber near the ridge, the divine maidens did not gather. The western inspection revealed disorder, and those who sought to follow him did not grasp this principle, mistaking it for mere sensual indulgence.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the sixth month, five individuals arrived around the third watch.",
      "overlap_context": "will come of their own accord. I have come merely to praise your karmic virtue and to form a bond with you. Do not be overly modest.\"\n\n\"Others from Tongwu will come again. Receive them well. Now, I take my leave.\" In the latter part of the month, we shall meet again, for our paths align in leisurely wandering, and our thoughts remain intertwined.\n\nTaking his hand, he departed.\n\nThe above was a record of the revelation received on the night of the sixth day, transcribed on a sheet of green paper.",

      "translated_text": "One appeared to be around thirty, wearing a yellow-flowered crown and a cloud-brocade feathered robe. Four attendants accompanied him, bearing purple-feathered staffs and holding flowing-gold bells—this was Perfected Master Feng, as recorded in the *Declarations of the Perfected*. Another wore a lotus crown and a crimson embroidered robe, with two attendants who carried nothing—this was Zhang Zian. A third had a black lotus crown and a green embroidered robe, with two attendants—this was Master Hong of Zhongshan. Another was clad in a vermilion robe with a purple-grass sash, accompanied by six attendants all in official garb, each bearing something—this was Registrar Le. The last had twin topknots and an embroidered robe—this was the Youth of Huayang.\n\nOf the five, the first three sat in a row facing south, while the Registrar and the Youth sat to the side recording. The Registrar stepped forward and said, \"This evening, exalted perfected ones have arrived. Rise, rise!\" Ziliang then rose and bowed to those before him. They replied, \"Be seated, Ziliang.\" Then they asked, \"Zhou has cultivated merit and accumulated virtue—can this be said to fulfill his aspirations?\" Master Zhang said, \"The bright mirror of discernment should rightly illuminate his heart.\" They answered, \"So it is.\" Master Hong asked, \"Has Zhou not shown joy in his progress along the Way?\" (The character *yifa* should be *xifei*.) They replied, \"Though he may not rejoice, even if he did, it could not mar his golden tally.\" The Registrar said, \"Zhou may indeed be called one who preserves the immortal’s path.\"\n\nThen they asked Ziliang, \"Today, with all these present, have you fully expressed your heart?\" Ziliang answered, \"To be so graced by the descent of the exalted perfected into this humble place fills me with both joy and trepidation—I know not how to compose myself.\" They smiled but said nothing. The Youth of Huayang then said, \"You may not recognize all these perfected ones, so I shall introduce them. The first is Perfected Master Feng of Mount Song, the second is Immortal Minister Zhang of Leisure, the third is Immortal Master Hong of the Central Marchmount, the fourth is Registrar Le of the Bureau of Life-Preservation, and the fifth is I, the Jade Youth of the Celestial Minister of Agriculture of Huayang. Thus, I make their names and ranks known to you. Among them, any position here is as esteemed as a palace attendant or minister in the mortal world.\" Ziliang replied, \"How could the lofty and numinous perfected ones be compared to worldly mortals?\" The Registrar said, \"*Youce* should be written as *yuce*. The obscure one here is Zhou.\" Then he added, \"Now that the perfected have deigned to descend, each should compose a verse.\"\n\nThe perfected ones said, \"You are the clear witness—proceed first.\" Ziliang answered, \"I dare not disobey, but I fear it would be improper for one as lowly as I to go first.\" The Registrar then instructed Ziliang to fold paper and moisten his brush, dictating:\n\n*\"The radiant splendor illumines the jade grove,\nA pure wind scatters the purple clouds.\nGazing up, I behold the perfected ones,\nRiding the void through the green dawn.\nThey descend from the vermilion-mist pavilion,\nTo visit this companion in the dust.\nThere is a natural meeting of the Way,\nNo need for the heart to strain.\"*\n\nPerfected Master Feng then recited:\n\n*\"The great aurora swells beneath the purple canopy,\nA scene wind stirs the feathered wheels.\nStraight to the ford of dust I descend,\nMyriad impurities drench this body.\nWere he not a child who preserves the Way,\nHow could one meet such a man today?\nBeyond this, before the year’s end,\nI shall ride the light to the court of the Great Perfected.\nThough karmic ties may be bound,\nVirtue must be steadfastly cultivated.\"*\n\nImmortal Minister Zhang recited:\n\n*\"I inscribe my hall of leisure,\nWandering where the dust’s clamor reaches.\nI gallop through the flying clouds,\nSeeking this bond among mortals.\nHow wondrous is Zhou—\nAble to move the hearts of the mysterious ones.\nLet not your soaring aspirations wither,\nLest they break beneath the frost’s severity.\"*\n\nMaster Hong recited:\n\n*\"A numinous wind fans the purple mist,\nA radiant cloud scatters cinnabar light.\nThe Eight Simplicities are not distant,\nThe Nine Abysses are not so towering.\nThough aspirations and deeds may... (one character missing)\nCultivation may yet refine them.\nExhort yourself in this present task,\nFor the golden gates shall be our shared return.\"*\n\nThe Youth of Huayang recited:\n\n*\"The suspended terrace pierces the purple Han,\nThe steep steps ascend the crimson clouds.\nThe radiant splendor flies like a torch,\nThe Seven Luminaries each in their course.\nI inscribe this passage through the dust’s filth,\nTo reach that transcendent lord.\nExhort yourself within these two years,\nLet not the gates of the profane age prevail.\nWhen the time comes for our meeting,\nWhy trouble with lengthy words?\"*\n\nWhen the poems were finished, Perfected Master Feng said, \"What each has composed is sufficient for mutual exhortation and admonition. Reflect on the turning of the green destiny and strive to refine your single-minded devotion.\" (*Yundan* should be *lidan*.) He continued, \"There will be others who come. If one can contemplate deeply and enter the subtle, ride the dragon’s chariot upon the misty path, and sound the phoenix’s call along the clouded thoroughfare, with divine youths unfurling their banners and jade maidens attending his carriage—why wait for endless kalpas? Attaining the Dao lies entirely within the square inch of the heart; there is no need for bodily toil or spiritual depletion.\n\nYet mortals only know of consuming elixirs and swallowing talismans, clinging to what is not their lot—such efforts are in vain. They do not devote themselves to accumulating merit and virtue. Though the Dao may be discussed when merits are fulfilled, it is only attained by later generations, not in this present life. These words may also be shared with your family. Now you know.\"",

      "translated_text": "Ziliang respectfully assented and complied.\n\nZhang said, \"These words of the Perfected Lord may be called the ultimate teaching. If one could further transcend and surpass this, then even the two celestial bureaus would find it rare and difficult.\"\n\nWould the Leisurely Hall become Master Zhou’s place of wandering?\n\nMaster Hong said, \"If benevolent merits are accumulated, might one be selected as a minor attendant in the Court of the Perfected? Yet this may not be the limit.\"\n\nThe Attendant said, \"Once merits are fixed, why must one be so diligent?\"\n\nThe Youth said, \"What the two of you speak of is also what others do—there is no need to press one another. If one can accumulate deeper karmic merit, then one may achieve the work of a Perfected. Even if one rests, one will still not lose this.\"\n\nWhen the Attendant finished speaking, they bade farewell together, lingering at the doorway before vanishing.\n\nThe above passage was received as a record on the twelfth day, written on four sheets of white paper. Among these jade-like beings, three have already come: Perfected Feng, Attendant Le, and now descending. According to the *Declarations of the Perfected*, there is a Perfected of the Western Peak, Feng Yanshou—this is likely the same. Attendant Le, styled Changzhi, was a native of Chengyang and oversaw disasters as one of the Four Attendants. The poetic compositions of the immortals and Perfected, in their talent and diction, are all quite similar; the *Declarations of the Perfected* contains many such examples, none surpassing the others. Examining the meaning of the words received in this descent, it seems to vaguely hint at the elevation to the Eastern Florescence’s Protector of Dawn.\n\nOn the night of the thirteenth day of the sixth month in the *yiwei* year, the former commander came and said, \"Recently, the wandering descent of the Perfected Immortals must have brought you great joy. I have been constantly occupied, thus becoming estranged. How have you been?\"\n\nZiliang replied, \"Of late, heaven and earth have been clear and serene, the Seven Luminaries all bright. I have been fortunate to receive the descent of lofty spirits several times, yet my impurities and filth make me unworthy to bear it.\"\n\nThe commander said, \"This is the merit of your thousand autumns. Do not lament your impurities and filth. However, during the time your sixth-generation ancestor, Zhou Mei, served as governor of Qiao Commandery, he was particularly fond of hunting, killing and wounding countless beings. Fortunately, he occasionally cultivated merit and virtue, so his sins have already been absolved. You ought not to eat meat again, for doing so may provoke retribution from your ancestral source. Take heed. The herbs of the immortals are sufficient—why rush to consume this? Fearing you might not understand, I took this opportunity to come and inform you.\"\n\nZiliang respectfully received the instruction, and the commander departed.\n\nThe above passage was received as a record on the thirteenth day, written on a small sheet of green paper. The genealogy of the Zhou family of Runan has not been consulted, so it is unclear during which emperor’s reign of the Jin dynasty Zhou Mei served as governor of Qiao. The fault of slaughter is truly grave, yet since he himself was absolved, one now fears the calamity may extend to his descendants, making it difficult to resolve. One should also establish good merit, so that one’s own blessings may flow to one’s descendants. This commander had one attendant, whom I have not yet met.",

      "translated_text": "On the night of the fifteenth day after the departure of the man from Mount Zhong, according to a separate record, on the fifteenth day of the sixth month, Master Hong of Mount Song bestowed the *Scripture of the Grotto Chamber*, and so forth. Upon examining the case, however, this transmission was not found. Perhaps it was due to the secrecy and solemnity of the cultivation practice that it was not inscribed on the document’s edge, or it may have been stored elsewhere. This likely pertains to the external *Dou* method, its affairs intersecting with the previous two stars, which explains its continuity.\n\nMaster Hong, who bestowed it, was heard to reside in Western Xian. Later, when he moved to Zhu Yang, he slept in a grove where no evil person could approach him, and he seldom mingled with others. At dusk, he would always retire outside the grove—this must be the method of sleeping in alignment with the *Dou* in cultivation. This method belongs to the middle-grade scriptures of the *Shangqing* tradition, not the teachings of lesser immortals.\n\nAnother person arrived, youthful and resplendent, dressed in white, and conveyed a message from Commander Fan: \"I previously warned you about consuming meat—have you still not ceased? Why did you go to another’s place this morning to eat dried meat? From now on, do not repeat this.\" He urged Ziliang to heed the earlier admonition and fulfill today’s expectations.\n\nZiliang replied: \"This morning, I went to my master’s abode, where he offered me food, claiming it was sweet fruit. I did not suspect deceit. Moreover, having received this command, how would I dare approach meat again?\" The visitor departed after this exchange.\n\nThe above is a record received on the fifteenth day. Written on a single sheet of white rattan paper, its quality closely resembles that of Master Yang’s hand. On the morning of the fourteenth day, Ziliang had already informed his aunt that he could not eat meat. That evening, upon entering the mountain pass, he again heard the same admonition as Commander Fan’s, and he immediately assented. On the morning of the fifteenth day, he entered once more and proceeded to inquire of Pan Yuanwen. Pan performed a ritual with him and urged him to focus his resolve, after which this message was received at night. On the morning of the sixteenth day, he again encountered the earlier admonition. From then on, he completely abstained from evil.\n\nIn his response, he later explained: \"What the master bestowed was merely expedient teaching to ease reproach.\" From the tenth month of last year until the third month of this year, he had strictly adhered to a vegetable diet, but the hardship left him emaciated. His aunt then advised him to gradually reintroduce food, and he had only just begun to do so when he again committed this transgression. Not only was he constrained by the impending calamity from past misdeeds, but his indulgence also violated the nurturing *qi* of living beings, which those with benevolent hearts must sever to cultivate their nature. Thus, the immortals and sages make it their essence to abstain entirely.\n\nOn the nineteenth day of the sixth month, five women arrived—these were the ones Li Feihua had mentioned on the eleventh night in the mountain pass, scheduled to meet at the Western Bank on the nineteenth. The first was Yi Qian’s disciple, the Immortal Consort Lady Zhao, styled Sutai, aged around thirty, clad in embroidered robes. She is recorded in the *True Records*. The second was Yi Qian’s left concubine, Lady Wang, who had changed her style name to Taiying, aged around twenty, dressed in purple. The *True Records* mention a Wang Jinxian; this may be her under a new name. The third was Yi Qian’s right concubine, Lady Liu, styled Xuanwei, aged around twenty, dressed in green. The *True Records* mention a Liu Chunlong, but this is not the same person—unless she had changed her name a hundred times, which seems unlikely. The fourth was Yi Qian’s Director of Studies, Lady Tao, who had changed her style name to Zhi’an, aged around forty, wearing a robe of green above and purple below, with tadpole-script embroidery—likely the same as Xu Yuanmu. The fifth was Yi Qian’s disciple, Li Feihua, aged around twenty, who had come before, dressed in green above and jade-green below. The *True Records* do not mention her.\n\nThe names, titles, and Li Feihua’s account of these five women were all as described. When the conversation ended, the four sat together, while Li remained standing. There were also eight attendant maidens: one carried a towel case, on which was an inscription; two wore large talismans at their waists, each about a foot square, inscribed in black on blue-green silk. Another held a case, covering it with its lid as she carried it, within which was a pouch bearing a yellow inscription—likely containing scriptures. Four others each held an ivory tablet, their characters so fine as to be unreadable. All were dressed in figured silk robes with purple and crimson sashes.\n\nThe immortals conversed among themselves for some time, seemingly discussing Ziliang’s affairs, though their meaning was not entirely clear. Lady Zhao then addressed him: \"Your dark affinity has long been evident, enabling you to summon and receive the aid of true immortals with joy.\" Ziliang replied: \"Though unworthy and common, I have from youth followed the registers of the Dao, fortunate enough to dwell in forests and valleys. How could I have anticipated that true immortals would descend in response? My heart is filled with both joy and fear, leaving me unable to find peace. If my past causes may be considered, I humbly request the essential secrets of immortality to achieve accomplishment.\"\n\nLady Zhao said: \"Your name is inscribed on the purple tablets—why do you fear you will not become an immortal, and seek this from me? I am but an immortal myself.\" Lady Liu said: \"Zhou, do you know from whence your accumulated deeds and planted causes have brought you to this day?\" Ziliang replied: \"I am but a speck of dust in the mortal world—how could I fathom such matters?\" Lady Liu said: \"I will briefly explain. When you were born in the household of Zhou Kui, you were already destined for the Dao, but your greed and impurity were too great, so you did not attain it. In your next life, born into the household of Liu Wei, you gained the fortune of diligently studying the Dao, which has carried over to your present existence. You have been recorded in the registers of the highest immortals three times, but on occasion, you violated the proper methods and fell away. This meeting has been recorded above for over seventy years, which is why you have endured cycles of life and death. I have consulted the Recorder of Records regarding this matter, and he informed me thus, so I now reveal it to you, that you may know the source of your circumstances.\"\n\nLady Wang said: \"Lady Liu’s words have thoroughly explained the hidden and manifest aspects of your past lives. You should keep this knowledge in your heart and not reveal it to the careless common folk.\" Lady Tao said: \"Zhou, you were born on the nineteenth day of the *dingchou* year, a person of the Water destiny.\" She then asked Lady Zhao: \"To whom does this one compare?\" Lady Zhao replied: \"There is no fixed comparison.\"",

      "translated_text": "Lord Zongzhen of the Perfected was born in a *dingchou* year, a person of the Water destiny, and holds the rank of High Perfected. Zhang Suan, also born in a *dingchou* year, has sunk into the Three Bureaus. This is not a fixed fate, but depends solely on one’s merits and deeds.\n\nLady Tao said: \"Truly as Lady Liu has told you, and as I have told Ziliang: Though the divine immortals’ responsiveness to profound mysteries is swift and effortless, mortal sentiments are too insubstantial and faint to summon such resonance. Those of us who come here today seek only those with the Dao—we do not wander aimlessly without purpose. Take care that others do not learn of this. Even if they do, it may not be so, for such matters might breed doubt and reproach, turning your heart away. I bear no ill will toward them, but fear they may bring retribution upon themselves.\"\n\nZiliang said: \"Having received the descent of the divine, how could I dare to doubt? I wished only to present this to my teacher’s wife from time to time, not to reveal it to the careless common folk.\" He added: \"Nor should you tell those of the *jia* or *yi* ranks.\"\n\nLady Zhao further explained: \"The Dao of immortals holds subtle and hidden delights. Now, let me roughly describe them. Those who attain the rank of True Immortal repose in the Mystic Palace, roam the Purple Han, their movements unfolding the twin radiance of sun and moon, their stillness calming the winds and clouds. Clad in kingfisher plumes and flying robes, they ride upon maple chariots and divine pines. They traverse seas and cross mountains, wandering the eight directions. Advancing, they suffer no peril of water or fire; retreating, they bear no burden of wood or stone. Is this not worthy of being called noble and exalted? Yet people see only the glory of carriages and caps, the pleasures of the inner chambers, and deem these the ultimate. This is precisely why the True Dao does not mingle with the world, and why divine immortals seldom wander among men. Even those who know of it cannot fully cultivate it—some cultivate but do not persist, others persist but do not refine their practice. Such matters are truly lamentable. Zhou, do not follow the path of the common herd.\"\n\nLady Wang said: \"One whose will is single-minded, who proceeds without turning back, whose thoughts are unburdened by attachments, and whose heart is free and unencumbered—this is a disciple who preserves the worthy. If one delves into the hidden and probes the distant, seeking teachers and friends, toiling day and night for years on end; or if one sits alone in the mountains, practicing scriptures and methods, swallowing talismans and absorbing radiance, dwelling in the Seven Primes—all may attain the Dao. Yet none compare to the swiftness of accumulating merit and perfecting deeds. You may convey this to the younger generation, urging them to diligence. If they persist without cease, they need not fear for their future, nor will they waste their own efforts or trouble others with their concerns.\"\n\nLady Tao said: \"If one can guard the Dao without wavering, practice *qi*-absorption and radiance-swallowing to stabilize the five viscera, one may attain earthly immortality and live forever. Without the Golden Elixir or the Five Mushrooms, however, one cannot soar through the Great Ultimate or move without constraint. I am still but a middling immortal, not yet among the High Perfected or Lesser Realized. I too once practiced *qi*-absorption and other arts, and thus have reached my present state. Zhou, will you strive for this?\"\n\nTheir words grew more detailed as the fourth watch approached. Lady Zhao said: \"The stars have grown sparse; dawn is near. We should depart, and all of you should leave as well.\" She added: \"This parting is not a long farewell.\"\n\nLady Wang said: \"When Lady Zhao comes, she will not fail to accompany us.\"\n\nLady Liu said: \"On the third day of next month, I shall go to the Eastern Flower, present the Learning Register, and visit Lady Tao.\" Ziliang asked: \"What is the Learning Register?\" She replied: \"It is the register of immortals’ progress in the teachings of *Yiqian*, recording their advances and setbacks. Every two months, on the third day, it is presented to the Great Director of Destinies of the Eastern Flower. The second month is the most important; it is presented again in the ninth month. This cycle repeats endlessly.\"\n\nLady Tao said: \"Let us part for ten days or so.\"\n\nLi said: \"Regarding your activities, Lady Zhao will send messengers to and fro. There is no need for formal farewells.\"\n\nThen they all descended into the grove and vanished, the attendants following in order. This record was received on the night of the nineteenth and written on six small sheets of green-striped paper.\n\nThe teachings of these ladies contained no fixed doctrine, not limited to Zhou alone but serving as a general admonition to cultivators. They clarified the meaning of wisdom and merit, showing that their virtue surpassed mere specialized practice. Observing their discourse, one may glimpse the principles therein.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-first day of the sixth month, I dreamed of a man around thirty years old, dressed in a plain white cloth robe with a black tablet in hand. His bearing was refined and dignified, inspiring respect. He identified himself as an emissary of Vice-Minister Zhao and said: \"Yesterday, I had words with Tao Yinju. There are matters requiring attention to the lord’s concerns and the people’s welfare, so I have come only now. Recently, petitions have arrived from many places, but none have been answered except Tao’s. Since your meritorious deeds have come full circle, I have come here to verify the virtue of you both. Do not be overly modest, lest expectations be dampened. Thus, I have come to report.\"",

      "translated_text": "The above entry, received in a vision on the night of the twenty-first, was inscribed on a sheet of white hemp paper.\n\nThat summer, a drought had persisted for weeks without rain. The various Daoist masters had repeatedly submitted memorials, yet no clouds gathered. The Recluse and Zhou jointly composed a petition, following the usual practice of writing in cinnabar on blue-green paper. On the twentieth day, the sky cleared, and that night, together with Zhou, they presented the petition in meditation. Thus, on the night of the twenty-first, this dream was received.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-second, Zhou composed a petition in ink in response and submitted it himself at the court altar. On the morning of the twenty-third, Zhou told his family: \"Last night, someone reported that it would rain at midday today.\" That morning, the sky was clear and scorching, with no sign of rain. By midday, Zhou entered the mountain pass and, upon reaching the summit, saw wind and clouds suddenly rise from the east. Before he could reach the Recluse, he was met on the road by a downpour that soaked the ground, though it fell only on the mountain where he had just passed.\n\nThis matter was later widely recounted, though some merely noted the dream without confirming whether it was truly a dream or reality.\n\nHua Yang Recluse, Daoist Zhou Ziliang, humbly observes: The mandate of the lower realm depends on grain as its foundation, and farming relies on moisture. For weeks now, drought has parched the seedlings, and the cries of distress echo far and near as all gaze upon the heavens in despair. Though the people have prayed ceaselessly, no response has descended. We have heard that the office responsible for water and rain exists, and we beseech its compassion for the common folk, that it may swiftly send down moisture. Let it summon wind and call forth clouds, gathering them from every direction, so that floods may overflow the rivers and all—whether on land or water—may be saved. Then shall the ode of the white crane be revived in our time. With utmost sincerity, we submit this petition, modeled on past examples.\n\n*Tianjian 14th year, cyclical year yiwei, sixth month, twenty-first day.* The petition is presented before Zhang Li, Keeper of the Golden Altar Grotto-Heaven of Juqu Hua Yang, and Vice-Minister Zhao of the Prohibitions.\n\nThis was the former petition written in cinnabar. The Recluse later drafted Zhou’s petition, and upon reviewing it, transcribed it anew. The wooden tablet Zhou had altered was later sought but not found.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, during the afternoon, in the southern woods, the Recluse dreamed of a man of about sixty years, wearing a fluttering wind crown and a purple robe lined with fur. He held a jade bell in hand and bore a great talisman at his waist, inscribed in cinnabar on yellow silk—not in brushstrokes, but woven into the fabric. He had never appeared before.

I once studied the Dao on Mount Song, accumulating over eighty years, until I was granted divine lingzhi. Consuming it, I transformed. Though I attained the divine and ascended the immortal ranks, my bodily form had no resting place, and to this day it remains in the southern stone chamber of Mount Song. Gazing upon it, I am filled with longing, and my heart cannot let go. You need not worry about this matter. People say that those who attain the Dao no longer think of their form, yet my longing for my form is so intense it tears at my liver and heart. Can I truly be without a coffin?\"\n\n\"Now I am the master of the Paulownia-Wu Golden Court and Jasper Palace, leading the immortals of Cangwu and presiding within the Crimson Terrace.

It is not a distant parting.\"\n\nWith that, he vanished from sight. After a moment, two men appeared in another dream—those sent by Vice-Minister Zhao, Huang Yuanping among them.

Only then was your name removed from the register of the dead and your name of life recorded anew, along with five others.

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nAccording to Deng, he arrived on the sixth day of this month. Xu and Deng were together at Tongwu, which is why they referred to each other. On the twenty-ninth day, they came again. As Xu said, though one may attain transformation, the transformed still cling to their bodily forms—how much more so for those among the remaining spirits and ghosts? The matter of the coffin and outer coffin cannot be dispensed with.\n\nThis Xu Jun—*Zhenzhuo* records nothing of his origins, nor does it state where or when he attained the Dao. He said that Zhou’s father had returned to the Northern Palace, which means he was under the command of Deng’s capital office. In the fifth month, Vice-Minister Zhao said that next spring he would be reborn into the Wang family; now he has already departed, and once rebirth is received, all former ties are severed.\n\nFurthermore, recalling what Madam Liu had previously said: \"Your name has been on the register of immortals for over seventy years,\" yet now it is only said that Mount Tai has just removed your name from the register of the dead and recorded your name of life. From this, it appears that the ledgers of immortals and the rolls of ghosts each have their own records. Though the immortal ledger may list one’s name, if the ghostly roll is not expunged, the matter remains unsettled. Only when the name on the immortal register is confirmed and the ghostly roll is likewise corrected—so that both names are properly aligned—does one escape demotion or expulsion back to the mortal realm, or conscription into ghostly service. If so, then Zhou’s transformation today ensures his rank is eternally secured.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month in the *yimao* year, two men arrived at Tongwu. One was Xu Xuanzhen, Master of the Jinting Palace at Tongxiang, an immortal of Cangwu, dressed as before and holding a jade bell, accompanied by two attendants—*Zhen Gao* makes no mention of this. The other was Deng Lingqi, an immortal of Tongwu, also dressed as before but holding only a jade bell, likewise attended by two—*Zhen Gao* omits this as well.\n\nDeng spoke first: \"I have long wished to visit you, but this has hindered me. On the twenty-seventh, I received an imperial decree appointing me as *Dichen*, Umbrella-Bearing Censor, to govern the Southern Green Lodge at the foot of Tongwu Mountain, and to oversee the study of immortality in Huayang, as well as the affairs of the Four Palaces. This is why I have been delayed. Xu Jun’s earlier visit allowed for some pleasant exchange.\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"I am deeply honored by Xu Jun’s gracious regard, and my joy knows no bounds. To receive your descent now brings a happiness beyond measure.\"\n\nXu Jun said: \"Earlier, I passed by Mao Dinglu’s place, where he had just been granted *The Scripture of the Mysterious True One*. I was greatly pleased to hear it.\"\n\nZiliang answered: \"I am unworthy of such divine favor and the transmission of true teachings. As a dull mortal, my cultivation has been lax and inconsistent.\"\n\nXu then said: \"I have heard that your name has entered the green bamboo slips of the Eastern Palace. I shall verify this matter and, before long, will go with Deng to investigate it.\"\n\nZiliang replied: \"To be granted such an inquiry is indeed my greatest hope.\"\n\nXu then pointed to Deng and said: \"This gentleman has studied the Dao for several hundred years and has only now attained his position. You have obtained it while still seated upon the earth—this shows that long-standing effort has borne fruit.\"\n\nDeng smiled and said: \"As for Zhou’s karmic affinity, it was indeed as Marquis Han described. May I speak of it?\"\n\nXu said: \"Though Zhou bears the karmic affinity of an immortal, he has not yet come to know the matters of his past lives.\"\n\nZiliang then asked: \"How could one as base and worldly as I comprehend such things? Who is this Marquis Han?\"\n\nDeng replied: \"He is Han Huiqi, the Immortal Marquis of Donghua, who oversees the registers of the Eastern Palace and governs the Eighth Mysterious Palace of Fangzhang. When I spoke earlier of verifying your affairs, it is to him we must go.\"\n\nXu said: \"Today is rushed, and I cannot stay long. Before long, Deng and I shall come together again—it will not be a distant parting.\"\n\nThey rose from their seats, exited the door together, and vanished as their attendants followed. The attendants disappeared as well.\n\nThis account was received in a dream on the evening of the twenty-ninth and recorded on one large sheet of white hemp paper.\n\nAccording to Xu Xuan’s *Dinglu*, in the separate index of *The Scripture of the Mysterious True One*, it states: \"On the twenty-seventh day of the sixth month, by decree of the Lord of Xuan Dinglu of Huayang, *The Hidden Book of the Grand Empyrean* and *The Inner Secrets of the Mysterious True One* were conferred,\" and so on. Yet this matter is not found in the present letter, likely because it was sealed separately with others in the same chamber.\n\nAs for the immortals of Tongwu, they should not be connected to one another. Since Deng oversees the immortal prohibitions of the Four Palaces of Huayang, he is permitted to travel among them. These would be, for men, Tong Chu and Xiao Xian, and for women, Yi Qian and Han Zhen. The matter of verifying the registers will be addressed in the seventh month.\n\nFrom the first to the twenty-ninth day of the sixth month, there are thirteen entries in all, recorded on twenty-three sheets of blue and white paper, large and small. Of the two entries concerning the *Cavern Chamber* and *Mysterious True One* in the catalog, only these are missing; the rest are complete.\n\n*Records of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen, Scroll Two* ends here.\n*Records of Zhou’s Communication with the Unseen, Scroll Three* begins.",

He appeared to be around fifty years of age. As recorded in the *Zhen’gao*, he had four attendants holding yellow-feathered staffs.\n\nOne surnamed Wang was dressed similarly to Zhou, but with a purple feathered robe and golden bells. He appeared to be around forty. The *Zhen’gao* notes he had four attendants holding green-feathered staffs.\n\nOne surnamed Mao wore a *Yuanyou* crown, a black feathered robe, and a purple brocade garment, bearing golden bells. He appeared to be around sixty. The *Zhen’gao* records he had three attendants holding black-feathered staffs, one of whom carried a white ivory box.\n\nAnother surnamed Mao wore a *Furong* crown, a red feathered robe, and a black embroidered garment, bearing jade bells. He appeared to be around sixty or older. The *Zhen’gao* notes he had two attendants, who carried nothing.\n\nOne surnamed Zhou wore a *Huagai* crown and a cloud-brocade garment, bearing jade bells. He was in his forties. The *Zhen’gao* states his name was Taibin, with five attendants holding purple-feathered staffs.\n\nOne surnamed Sima wore a *Furong* crown, a plain feathered robe, and a purple brocade garment, bearing jade bells. He appeared to be around forty. The *Zhen’gao* records he had two attendants holding blue-feathered staffs.\n\nThe last was the Minister of Music, dressed as before, with five attendants. The *Zhen’gao* confirms this; their attire was previously described, and the *Zhen’gao* commands recognition of it.\n\nThe Minister said: \"Now that the Perfected Ones have arrived, why do you not bow?\"\nZiliang immediately rose and bowed twice, kowtowing and knocking his head to the ground, entreating the secrets of immortality.\n\nLord Mao, Registrar of Destinies, said: \"Your merit and fame are already manifest; do not trouble yourself with further striving. Record all that concerns me.\"\nZhou Ziyang said: \"...It has been hundreds of years since we last parted, yet to me it feels like a single day. How bitterly you have entangled yourself in the cycles of life and death!\"\nSima of Kuocang said: \"Is it not Zhou who has attained the Dao without diligence in study?\"\nMao, Preserver of Life, said: \"The hardships of striving cannot be fully described—what is called 'first suffering, then joy.'\"\nWang Ziyang said: \"Time accumulates easily, but meritorious deeds are difficult to manifest. I once heard of Zhou’s name; now I see his virtue. His resolve has long been firm—this is truly evident.\"\nThis must refer to his courtesy name, Jia.\n\nThe Zhou Grand Master said: \"Zhou is young in years but profound in virtue, shallow in knowledge yet deep in wisdom. He has been thus for three lifetimes. In my past travels through the world, I visited him several times, and he was always able to open his heart in sincerity and extend benevolence. I wished to impart essential teachings to him, but he was not yet ready to receive the methods, so I did not transmit them. Now that we meet again, I am truly delighted.\"\nZhou Ziyang said: \"Do you know his origins? He is none other than my grandnephew. I last met him at the Southern Sea, and we parted. It has been over two hundred years since then.\"\n\nThe Minister said: \"I shall now announce the ranks of the foremost Perfected Ones among you.\nThe Left Perfected One of Ziyang governs Mount Geyan.\nSecond is Zhou, the Ancient Perfected One of Ziyang, who governs Mount Panzhong. (Wang and Zhou’s traditions state that Ziyang has Left and Right Perfected Ones, but it is unclear whether the Right is Wang; his name is unknown.)\nThird is Mao, Registrar of Destinies.\nFourth is Mao, Preserver of Life.\nFifth is Zhou, Right Grand Master of Penglai.\nSixth is Sima, Perfected One of Kuocang.\nSeventh is myself.\nThe first six ranks, including those who have come before and after, are all immortals. Only Feng is the Perfected One of the Yellow Court, governing the Central Marchmount.\"\n\nThe Preserver of Life asked: \"Do you roughly understand these ranks?\"\nZiliang replied: \"I humbly receive your instruction and now comprehend.\"\nThe Registrar of Destinies said: \"Previously, I sent Jing to arrange the transmission of the *Inner Secrets of the Mysterious Perfected*—have you not yet cultivated it?\"\nZiliang said: \"Having received the *Scripture of the Mysterious Perfected*, I should have cultivated it, but Master Hong previously bestowed the *Cavern Chamber* upon me, and I wished to first complete its practice, so I have not had the leisure.\"\nHe further instructed: \"The *Cavern Chamber* yields benefits slowly. If you cultivate the *Mysterious Perfected* with single-minded diligence, within five years you will obtain the attendance of the Jade Maiden of the Great Mystery. I still advise you to prioritize it; cultivating both will not hinder one another.\"\nZiliang assented.\n\nWang said: \"You must strive diligently. Though your name is recorded in the registers, if you slacken midway, you may not fully attain this merit. Do not lightly reveal tonight’s affairs to others.\"\nThe Zhou Grand Master said: \"Those who attain immortality appear year after year, month after month—only people do not know it. In the year *shen*, you will ascend to the Grand Ultimate; if not, then in the year *you*. This appointed time is neither distant nor far—you must strive without ceasing.\"\nSima said: \"Your protection and advancement are strong, your attainments fine. The Dao will surely be harmonized—only ensure its circulation does not cease.\"\nZiliang received these one or two instructions and respectfully complied.\n\nThe Minister said: \"Master Tao’s affairs are recent, and this discussion is not without basis. Your aunt has repeatedly made earnest requests to the two Lords, and there is no objection—only I fear my own position may not permit assent.\"\nThe Registrar of Destinies said: \"Tao’s name is recorded with many gaps, and the flaws are not definitive. Since he indulged himself through me, I cannot take sole responsibility.\"\nMid-month, he asked to consult with Sihe (the courtesy name of the Preserver of Life). He intended to visit the various Controllers of Destiny to discuss the matter, assuring that there would be no hardship—do not worry hastily.\nHe further said: \"We depart now, but may return to visit again. If you have letters or memorials, they may also be conveyed.\"\nThey then departed together.\n\nThis entry, recorded on the second night of the seventh month, was written on four small blue slips, with an additional piece appended later.",

      "translated_text": "**Annotation:**\nOn this occasion, the Two Perfected of Ziyang and the Two Lords of Juqu seemed to descend for the first time. Yet in the previous sixth month, they had only dispatched their attendants. *The Declarations of the Perfected* states: \"Zhou Taibin was skilled at playing the one-stringed zither; the one who instructed Sun Deng was the Right Lady of Penglai—this must refer to her.\" Sima Kuocang appears neither in internal nor external records, nor is he the same as Ji Zhu; rather, he must have been Ji Zhu’s son, Fayu. Only this single visitation is recorded, after which he withdrew into seclusion. In the fourth month of this year, he dreamed of being summoned, saying that the official bureau was already prepared, save only for the seal, which had not yet been made. His heart was heavy with concern, and he went directly to Zhou to speak of it. Zhou then told his aunt of this, and she secretly arranged a delicate missive, instructing Pan Yuanwen to draft a memorial. Together with Zhou, they submitted the petition. Later, he retreated into seclusion in the Tianchuang Cavern, and nothing more was known. Only afterward did they learn of this, though they did not inquire whether Zhou had approved. By the thirteenth day of the seventh month, the matter was resolved. At dawn on the fourteenth, Zhou received the memorial and was shown the details. He had heard of this only once, yet it was said that there had been repeated delicate petitions—this remains unexplained.\n\nOn the third night of the seventh month in the year *yiwei*, nine women arrived. They wore dark green robes with crimson-green skirts, their waists girded with purple sashes, and golden bells hanging from their belts. Beneath the bells hung large black talismans. Their documents were written on blue slips. Each held a tablet in hand, white as jade, with seams resembling woven patterns, and small bells sewn into the stitching, chiming as they walked. One of the women was Liu Xuanwei, another Tao Zhi’an; the rest were unknown and unseen. Speaking to Lady Liu, one said: \"Have you recently cultivated new studies? I have just returned from Donghua. The documents are roughly settled, and your name has been inscribed on the Azure Slips of Donghua—this is most fortunate.\" Lady Tao said: \"I have heard that those who fast and await the Northern Dipper achieve greatness beyond words. I marvel at your resolve, yet even this star cannot be swiftly attained—it requires years of accumulation.\" Lady Liu then called to the other women: \"This Zhou has the soaring elegance of clouds; he may be worthy of conversation.\" One replied: \"A minor immortal dares not speak with one so exalted.\" Liu said: \"High and low are not so easily fixed. He remains mired in the dust and clamor—we merely seek to awaken him. What exaltation is there?\" The woman smiled and said: \"We shall visit another time; now is not the occasion for words.\" Tao said: \"In this passage, *Liu Miaoji* should be written as *Ji* (姬), as the oral transmission misrendered the character.\" Sun Fanghua and Ruan Huixiang—these three women—are absent from *The Declarations of the Perfected*. These three have cultivated diligently and attained transcendence, receiving their texts in the Eighth Vermilion Terrace of Fangzhu. They have become immortal consorts, which is how we now know of them. Liu said: \"Zhou, do you desire this?\" He replied: \"I, a mere worm or bird, dare not aspire to such heights.\" She said: \"You *can* aspire—that is why I tell you.\" Tao said: \"The night grows late; we should depart.\" As they prepared to leave, the women said: \"Wait for us.\" Then they vanished together.\n\nThis entry, recorded on the third night, was written on two small blue slips.\n\n**Annotation:**\nThis refers to the previous month’s account of delivering the study register to Donghua, then descending after an audience with the King of Zhao. There were others who added playful or earnest words, expressing aspirations to harmonize the Two Modes, illuminate the sun and moon, and unite the qi of mountains and marshes, the convergence of yin and yang—all requiring pairing and mutual resonance. Even among the loftiest Perfected, this principle holds. Though long recorded in past accounts, the present discrepancy is not a matter of confusion. Yet distinctions of seniority and rank, of time’s length or brevity, each follow their own destined course—uniformity is not required. For those whose Dao transcends the mundane and whose minds congeal beyond transformation, responses may arise at the margins, no longer bound by conventional harmony. Like the resonance of Mañjuśrī or the manifestation in Vimalakīrti’s chamber, where guest and host exchange roles beneath the Fusang tree—this carries a different significance.\n\nOn the ninth night of the seventh month, the Two Perfected of Ziyang and Lord Zhou, along with the Registrar of Destinies and three others, appeared. Their attire was as before, and they were accompanied by some ten attendants. The Ziyang youth was also present, and they conversed at length. The Registrar of Destinies then said to Ziliang: \"You have labored diligently. Heavenly affairs have frequently wearied my spirit. Six days ago, I went to Donghua and saw your name inscribed on the Azure Slips—you have been appointed as Controller of the Dawn, the first among my disciples. Is this not magnificent? This accords with the hidden tally of past vows. Though not strictly within this office’s purview, it should be fulfilled first.\" Lord Zhou of Ziyang added: \"You were destined for this position. The various bureaus did not promote you based on manifest virtue but directly reported your cultivation—hence the delay. Entering the realm of the Perfected entails many trials. Steady your resolve and do not falter.\" Lord Wang of Ziyang said: \"This is excellent, though I fear the trials may prove difficult.\" Ziliang then asked: \"May I inquire how many trials there will be, and whether they are great or small? As a mortal, I fear I may falter in fear.\" Wang said: \"There will be two minor trials: you may encounter tigers and wolves, or strange voices and forms to frighten you. When you see these, compose your mind and fortify your intent—do not be alarmed. If you do not falter, the apparitions will crumble like dust. Such trials are but a moment’s effort.\" Zhou had long possessed a strong and upright spirit. As a child, he slept alone in empty houses and walked through forests and grasses at night without fear, never suffering nightmares. Since coming to Maoshan and moving to Zhuyang, he often traveled the roads at dawn and dusk, always alone.",
      "overlap_context": "sult with Sihe (the courtesy name of the Preserver of Life). He intended to visit the various Controllers of Destiny to discuss the matter, assuring that there would be no hardship—do not worry hastily.\nHe further said: \"We depart now, but may return to visit again. If you have letters or memorials, they may also be conveyed.\"\nThey then departed together.\n\nThis entry, recorded on the second night of the seventh month, was written on four small blue slips, with an additional piece appended later.",

      "translated_text": "At first, when Zhou inquired of others, he was told that from the eighth or ninth month onward, he had been observed coming and going only with one or two companions, which was unusual for him. At the slightest disturbance, he would grasp a blade or staff. When asked why, he would merely respond with vague sounds—this was surely a sign of his impending departure. Recently, he had taken secret precautions against the trials: on the twenty-sixth evening, he moved to sleep in the eastern chamber, where a Daoist was arranged to keep vigil by the window. The Daoist noticed Zhou could not sleep and rose several times to sit and recite incantations, saying this was a critical moment—lest anything unusual occur to startle him. Yet he passed unscathed, surely by the strength of his cultivation.\n\nThe *Dinglu* further stated: Yesterday, the Eastern Flower gathered all the Directors of Destiny, the local earth deities, and their subordinates to review the records. They found that among the people of the world, not even one in fifty did good, let alone those pursuing immortality—scarcely two or three in ten thousand. Even among those whose cultivation had nearly succeeded, many later fell away. I fear the registers of immortals will soon have no names left. Moreover, the kalpa of disaster draws near, making it even harder to attain. In the Purple Register of the Eastern Flower’s ledgers, among the highest tier of Perfected, five were listed—two have already fallen, and no replacements have advanced to take their place. Among the upper-middle Perfected, twenty-eight were recorded; one fell, seven were demoted to lower immortals, five returned to the mortal realm, and only one advanced. Among the lower Perfected, three hundred were listed; twenty-six fell, eleven were demoted to earthbound immortals, fifteen returned to the people, and only eight advanced. Among the highest immortals, two hundred eleven were recorded; forty-two fell, twelve were demoted to mid-level offices in the Three Bureaus, six achieved corpse-liberation, twenty-four became lowly mortals—altogether, fifty fell. Among the upper-middle immortals, two hundred ninety-three were recorded; seventy fell, ten were demoted to lower immortals, eight achieved corpse-liberation, fifty-one returned to the mortal realm, and only eleven advanced. Among the lower immortals, four hundred three were recorded; seventy-eight fell, twenty were claimed by the Dark Capital, four were examined by the Three Bureaus, fifty-four returned to the mortal realm, and only nineteen advanced.\n\nThis month’s marked demotions will soon reach their appointed time. They must be reported to the Supreme Ultimate, and their names recorded in the ledgers of Mount Tai. Seeing such cases is truly lamentable. All failed due to lax cultivation: some were led astray by the recently deceased, others strayed from the Dao in their conduct, or began diligently but later slackened, losing their progress—how bitter! Yet there are those on the verge of ascending to the heavens, their days and months not spent in vain. All were instructed by descending Perfected Ones. Some dwell deep in the mountains, others have studied the Dao for years, yet none are known to the world. We, too, often teach as we do you—who among today’s people would recognize this?\n\nZhou said: What the *Dinglu* of Mao recounts is a profound warning to you. Do not grow idle in your inquiries. You now stand among the lowest immortals, yet you may ascend to the upper ranks of the middle immortals—able to roam the Supreme Ultimate, riding the scales of dragons. Is that not joyous?\n\nMaster Wang said: The admonitions of the *Dinglu* of Mao and Zhou Ziyang are indeed profound, sufficient to serve as your true record. Here in the mountains of Juqu, there are three or four who have entered the ranks of lower immortals. Would you like to know of them?\n\nZiliang then asked about his teacher, Master Tao. The reply: If you were like him, attaining Perfection would not be difficult. Tao has long stood at the upper ranks of lower immortals—such as Fan Youchong and others. (One version reads: \"middle ranks of middle immortals,\" but later, a note in black ink marks it as \"upper ranks of lower immortals,\" though the reason is unclear.) Since it is said he has long held this rank, has he now slackened, causing his demotion by two stages? When Fan Youchong was a child, he first supervised the transcription of the *Zhen’gao*, unaware of the ranks of true immortals—how did he compare to the Director of Waterways?\n\nIt was said there are four in Juqu—would you like to know who they are? Yet the question was never asked, which is most regrettable. From what I have seen and heard, among men there are Jiang and Xue; among women, Jiang and Song. All have long pursued cultivation, young and old, male and female, from north and south—some for their virtue, others for their faith and insight, though their study is not yet deep. Xu Lingzhen, though descended from a former sage, has not yet engaged in study due to family burdens. Yang Chao, though now at Linwu, was once a Daoist of old Juqu, possessing great talent and ambition. I do not yet know who among these three will meet the count, but all should redouble their diligence to fulfill this limit.\n\nZiliang further asked about his aunt. The reply: She has committed no great transgressions, but if she remains diligent, she may yet attain it in a future life—nothing can be said of this one. His aunt, originally from Qiantang, was surnamed Zhang. At three, she lost her father and followed her mother to remarry into the Xu family of Yongjia, taking their surname. At ten, she left home to study the Dao under a master, establishing a hermitage in Yuyao. Her nature was utterly sincere, and she cared for no one but her nephew, Ziliang. At thirty-five, pressed by imperial decree and urged by fellow Daoists to make concessions, she married into the Zhu family of Shangyu, thus entangled in worldly affairs. Ashamed and resentful, she fell ill with qi stagnation for four years, bore a son, then fled back to Yongjia, severing all ties. To this day—eleven years later—she claims never to have killed an insect or ant in her life, nor carelessly plucked flowers or grass, eating but one meal a day. Yet she regrets her nature was too severe, her discipline too harsh. What she has said shows no great faults, though she is not without minor failings. She should have steadfastly preserved her integrity to fulfill her destiny, rather than suffering humiliation before gods and ghosts.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, with my learning so shallow, how could I hope for fruition in this life? To achieve it in two or three lifetimes would already be fortunate.\n\nMaster Zhou further asked Ziliang, “What is your surname?”\n\nFlustered, Ziliang could not recall the name previously bestowed upon him and simply replied, “I am surnamed Zhou, named Ziliang.”\n\nThe master grew stern: “How dare you be so careless? You are Daoist Zhou Taixuan, styled Xuling—how could you be confused with the worldly Zhou Ziliang? Your name is inscribed on jade tablets as Zhou Taixuan. Do not presume to use it lightly. You should address yourself by your style.”\n\nZiliang said, “In the world, I am only known as Ziliang. I would not reveal my hidden name to common folk.”\n\nThe master replied, “Those in the world who are destined for the Dao are without limit—why should they cling solely to you? It is not merely because your fate moves the Perfected, but also because of the bond of kinship. Long ago, there were Yang and Xu: Yang Heng was visited by divine Perfected, yet Xu Yong never saw them. The reason was that Xu’s heart, though diligent and humble, was not free of desire and attachment, so he could not behold them. Yang’s rank was no higher than Xu’s, but his spirit was serene and steadfast, untroubled by the myriad distractions. His mind was not swayed by the splendor of the world, so he received the teachings from Yang and later conveyed them to Xu.\n\n“That you now see us is akin to Yang’s role. Do not lightly reveal these matters to others. Once, I traveled with Pei Qingling to Hua Qiao’s abode, where we received his instructions to convey them to Xu Qiao. But Xu was of common stock, his nature careless and undisciplined, unable to keep secrets. When taught a single method, he would embellish it and, without discernment, reveal it to anyone he met. After many such incidents, he was punished by Yang. Xu was cast into the river and drowned in a foreign land. Only fourteen years have passed since his escape, yet he remains among the ranks of ghosts, toiling day and night. Matters such as these—can you not be cautious? Do not reveal these things to others.”\n\nThe stories of Yang, Xu, and Hua Qiao all appear in the *True Reports*.\n\nThe *Record of Determinations* states: “Yesterday, I saw Yang in the Eastern Flower and invited him to come. He said he wished to, but was hindered by various matters and would visit another time.”\n\nMaster Wang said, “At the beginning of this month, I saw Lord Xu riding a dragon chariot with the Lady of Purple Tenuity and the Lady of Right Radiance, journeying to the Southern Perfected. The Lady of Purple Tenuity asked me if I had seen Zhou Taixuan, whose name is already inscribed in the Purple Register and who is destined for the Dao. She wished to observe his virtue and deeds. Have you seen him?”\n\nI replied that I had visited him and found him possessed of a refined and solitary virtue, well-suited to enlighten the Lady of Purple Tenuity. She said she would visit him again next year, and by autumn, his affairs would be settled so he could depart.\n\nThe Lady of Purple Tenuity oversees the instruction of those below.\n\nThe *Record of Determinations* said, “Your words are rough but sufficient to serve as a trial for Zhou. For now, depart. Heavenly duties are many, and I shall await your return tomorrow.”\n\nThey left with me, arriving at the second watch and departing at the fourth. Their words were too numerous to recall in full.\n\n---\n\nThis entry was received on the night of the ninth day and recorded on five sheets of official paper. Much of it concerns comings and goings, as well as proclamations and admonitions—all intended to impress caution, lest careless speech lead to punishment and demotion. Given this, how could they dare to reveal such matters? Even if pressed by the authority of kings or halls filled with gold and silk, they would seal their lips and uphold the Dao.\n\nThus, I ceased my inquiries, though this passage citing Yang and Xu’s admonition may well have another purpose. I regret not having discussed these matters with them earlier, for now, gaps remain, and though I continue to seek answers, it will not be in vain. How can I still hope for communication in the unseen realm? Yet there is still resonance.\n\n---\n\nOn the night of the eleventh day of the seventh month, Xu and Deng of Tong Bridge arrived, dressed as before. Xu approached and said, “Your name has already been submitted to the Eastern Flower, and you have been appointed as an attendant in the Office of Dawn Protection. This is a great cause for celebration.”\n\nDeng said, “This matter was foretold yesterday. Ziliang, you have already roughly explained it to the various Perfected. But you are of humble and unrefined nature—how dare you aspire to rely on the favor of divine Perfected?”\n\nXu said, “Recently, I saw Zhao Weibo, who serves in the Office of Life Protection. He said: ‘Zhou Ziliang, styled Yuansu, is now one person. His name is to be changed to Taixuan, styled Xuling. Born in the household of Zhou Kui, his name was first inscribed in the Purple Register. In his next life, he was born in the household of Liu Wei, and his name was again recorded in the Jade Register. Having endured hardships, he now strictly follows the celestial statutes and is to be reported as a minor immortal, appointed as Attendant of the Protective Register. His feathered regalia and attire remain as before. The Protector of Life will proceed to the Office of Determined Records to examine the matter at length, then compose a eulogy to be presented to the Eastern Flower, saying:\n\n*‘Zhou Taixuan possesses refined virtue, his heart and will empty and pure. According to the Purple Register, his immortal name may be inscribed.’*\n\nThe Eastern Flower then decreed that on the seventh day of the seventh month, the immortal officials would convene to review the register of names. Thus, your rank and position were determined: you are to be a middle-grade immortal, and a further petition has been made to promote you to the rank of upper immortal, appointing you as Attendant of the Office of Dawn Protection under the Han Lord.”\n\nThe document further states: *“Zhou Taixuan, styled Xuling, once nurtured the aspiration for the Dao and has now cultivated a vast and untrammeled virtue. Above, he aligns with the celestial principles; below, he accords with the terrestrial order. According to the immortal statutes, he is fit for the upper rank of the middle grade. As the term of the current Attendant of the Office of Dawn Protection nears its end, we request that Taixuan be selected to succeed him.”*\n\nRespectfully submitted to the Azure Lord, the decree reads as follows:\n\n*“Whereas Zhou Taixuan, by virtue of his deeds, has earned the inscription of his name on the immortal tablets, he is hereby appointed as Attendant of the Office of Dawn Protection.”*\n\nThis Han Lord inscribed the purple jade tablet with characters of red gold, addressing the Supreme.\n\nI have heard that this position is typically filled within one or two years, and you will likely be summoned then.\n\nZiliang asked, “What are the regalia for this position?”\n\nXu replied, “It cannot be fixed in advance, for it depends on the height of one’s merit. In principle, it may include a cinnabar dragon and green chariot, a canopy of black feathers, a staff of white plumes, five jade maidens in blue robes, seven jade lads in red, holding fans of swan feathers, wearing crowns of divine support, clad in robes of purple feathers and crimson clouds, girded with jade bells. The Six Dings will serve as messengers, and the myriad spirits will be under your protection.”",

      "translated_text": "Here the Master revealed the arts of divine transcendents and the methods of their instruction—no longer the mere office of a mortal registrar of records.\n\nThus, he pointed to what would come in due course, though it could not yet be shown to those near or far, serving only as a model for later generations.\n\nDeng said, “The True Lord of Tongwu wishes to come, but must first meet with the Supreme Void and the Two Perfected of the Ministry of Yin.”\n\nAfter repeated departures, he had spent the entire night in close counsel with his two disciples, fearing that if others arrived the next day and saw them in such disarray, word might spread. Thus, he kept it secret, revealing it only in private report. This matter, in fact, was precisely what the Green One had previously summoned him for—perhaps a reprimand or censure was due, as recorded in the celestial registers. Steward Zhao clearly knew of it, yet it could not be contested.\n\nUpon reflection, though he did not yet know whether he would assume this position, he felt no great desire for it, fearing it might be a mere illusion. Yet this reluctance arose from his devotion to the Dao, for he had examined Lord Lao’s teachings and understood that the nature of principle lies in forgetting. He no longer clung to all that is conditioned, and his resolve to seek the Dao had grown faint. Thus, he surmised that he would not greatly desire the office.\n\nNow that he had forgotten distinctions of acceptance and rejection, he would not refuse the task. If only he could benefit sentient beings, he would gladly endure lowly or arduous stations.\n\nLater, he admitted that though he wished to dissolve emotions and scatter thoughts, he had not yet fully succeeded. This was indeed a divine insight from his six or seven past journeys on the Dao—his afflictions were not yet exhausted, and he relied on this faith and forbearance, hoping to eradicate them entirely. Whether it took five years or ten, he would not regret hearing of it at dawn only to perish by dusk. It was his wish.\n\nSince Zhou had already seen him relinquish the matter, he wished to hasten and seek him out, following the separate record’s catalog.\n\nOn the fifteenth of the month, he received the *Three Heavens’ Dragon Script* for life preservation, along with its commands, and was instructed to blend in with mortals without drawing attention to his movements.\n\nThis passage, written on three sheets of white official paper, was the record received on the night of the eleventh. Within it lay the confirmation of his appointment, stating that he would not assume office until his predecessor’s term was complete. For now, he remained a provisional registrar, awaiting the appointed time before departing—though it was unclear whether he would truly hold the title or merely wander freely.\n\nThis was not a matter of personal desire; only when his topknot and temples showed signs of spiritual resonance could it be known.\n\nBy his calculations, he must still be in the grotto.\n\nOn the night of the thirteenth, Steward Zhao of the Celestial Registers arrived with them. Zhao said, “Yesterday, I went with Sihe to the Palace of the Supreme Origin and then called upon the Southern Lady to discuss Tao’s case. It was resolved in a short while.”\n\nZiliang asked when the summons would be issued, but Zhao replied, “It is uncertain—perhaps five or ten years. Though the matter concerns me, I must first report to the Upper Palace. I have been assigned to assist the Ministry of Destiny, so I dare not make a definitive statement.”\n\nSteward Zhao then said, “I have been ordered by the Eastern Palace to temporarily halt the summons of Tao.”\n\nZiliang asked whether the summons was for a celestial or ghostly office. Zhao answered, “It is for the position of High Radiance, Director of the Penglai Waterworks, who oversees water affairs. He was reprimanded, and it seems they wish Tao to replace him. However, the summons has been suspended, and another will be selected instead. This is a celestial office under the Ministry of Yin, overseeing water affairs. Tao is being considered for it due to his merits.”\n\n“Since Tao is a transcendent, he may not be aware of this. You may inform him.”\n\nAfter a moment, Zhao added, “Fortune and misfortune in life arise from causes, not from the will of the gods. Tao’s thoughts tonight—how could he recall such things? Though he speaks of dissolving emotions and scattering thoughts, he has not yet fully succeeded. How could he let them go entirely?”\n\nHe then spoke of alchemical matters, but the details were unclear—what a pity.\n\nHe also mentioned that the Great Lord of the Azure Youth would arrive when the moon was full, and that Hua would be exempted from the selection of transcendents under the *Yang* register.\n\nThis passage, written on a small sheet of white paper, was the record received on the night of the thirteenth. It aligned with what had been discussed two days prior, around the middle of the month.\n\nOn the fourteenth at dawn, Zhou entered the mountain pass and halted the previous summons, showing it to Tao. When asked his thoughts, Tao replied that he did not understand the reason, but his expression was grim. Ziliang dared not press further. Realizing the gravity of the matter, he ceased discussing it within the pass.\n\nOn the thirteenth night, during the first watch, Tao was suddenly visited by six or seven figures, all bearing staffs, who swiftly approached the steps. The foremost said, “",

      "translated_text": "Tao the Recluse, having received the proclamation from Zhou, composed a memorial on the fifteenth to present upon their next meeting, framing it as a formal response. This would have served as a reciprocal declaration, yet Zhou ultimately did not regard it as an appeal to the Dao—perhaps because there was no clear affirmation or denial to proclaim.\n\nAt the time, the August Emperor, in his grace, granted two parcels of land for Daoist cultivation in Changsha of Song, along with adjacent vacant plots to the west of this site. He further ordered the construction of halls on either side of the front courtyard, which happened to occupy the former grounds of Director Xu. I privately feared that such proximity to the true transcendents might invite reproach, and thus I heard of this matter only indirectly, regretting that I could not compose a more eloquent petition in response—had I done so, it would surely have been met with a thousandfold reply.\n\nOn the night of the twenty-fifth, I dreamed of Attendants Tang and Zhao arriving. Zhao said, “Why do you persist in such toil, depleting your spirit, straining your ears and eyes? Depart now, and spare yourself further hardship.” Ziliang asked, “Is it favorable to reside in this sanctuary? Lately, I have been constantly anxious about banditry.” Zhao turned and said, “This concerns Attendant Tang.” Tang then replied, “Though it concerns me, I am not at liberty to decide. As for calamities, even spirits and gods cannot foresee them. You need not fret excessively over this sanctuary, for it wearies the mind. As for Ziliang’s mention of bandit raids, he relies on us deeply.” He answered, “Take care and do not worry overmuch,” then departed. “Our discussion of fate and destiny is not yet concluded; we shall visit again.” I rose to see them off, and they vanished as they followed one another away.\n\nThis passage, received in a dream on the night of the twenty-fifth, was recorded on a sheet of white official paper.\n\nThat summer, the drought had soured the people’s temper, and the mountain’s venerable elders feared only alarm and terror. Thus, I sought their counsel through this inquiry. Attendant Tang, named Gongfang, was one of the Four Attendants, said to govern life and death, and to calculate matters of banditry—though it should have been Attendant Le who held jurisdiction, I did not realize it concerned Tang. In past records, whenever Tang appeared, there were always introductory exchanges, as if we were meeting for the first time. Perhaps such details were already noted and need not be preserved here.\n\nFrom this point onward, until now, I have enjoyed peace and security. According to a separate record’s catalog, on the twenty-eighth of this month, Attendant Tang again spoke of banditry, urging me not to worry, and so forth. This was not made explicit, so I feared it might not be transcribed.\n\nFrom the third to the twenty-fifth of the seventh month, there were nearly seven entries, written on ten sheets of blue and white paper of varying sizes. One entry is missing from the catalog, but the rest are complete.\n\n*Record of Zhou’s Communications with the Unseen, Scroll Three* concludes here.\n\n*Record of Zhou’s Communications with the Unseen, Scroll Four*\n\nThis scroll begins with the first communication on the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the year *yiwei* and continues through the seventh month of the year *bingshen*, with a monthly catalog of all recorded communications. The fifth, sixth, and seventh months are fully documented in the preceding three separate scrolls. From the eighth month onward, only this year’s catalog remains, with no further records.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the year *yiwei*, during the day, Attendant Zhao of the Life-Preserving Bureau delivered a proclamation. [Text omitted.]\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the fifth month in the year *yiwei*, at night, Marshal Fan of the Life-Preserving Bureau delivered a proclamation.

Only five are missing. From this point onward, no further records exist, which is deeply regrettable.\n\nOn the first day of the eighth month in the year *yiwei*, Attendant Fan arrived with a proclamation, stating: \"Today, the various Perfected Ones gathered to discuss and celebrate, and from now on, they wish for you to come freely and wander wherever you please.\" This visitation was not a dream.\n\nOn the fifth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I entered through a vermilion gate and towering palace, where I saw the Lord of Life’s Register. He bestowed upon me a luminous zhi fungus. The luminous zhi is one of the five varieties of zhi from Mount Gouqu.\n\nOn the seventh day of the eighth month, in a dream, I entered Huayang, first passing through the Palace of Life Preservation, then proceeding to the Office of Destiny to inquire about the whereabouts of the Celestial Dragon’s zhi in Xiaoxian. This journey went from north to south. The Celestial Dragon’s zhi is also one of the five varieties of zhi.\n\nOn the ninth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I arrived at the Office of Destiny and was questioned upon seeing them, asking whether I had joined others in a purification fast. That day, in the central hall, Wang Faming conducted a *tutan* fast for the imperial family.\n\nOn the twelfth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I rode in a carriage with the Lord of Destiny within Huayang, accompanied by thirty jade maidens playing celestial music. We visited the Southern Perfected in the Cinnabar City, where the Southern Perfected delivered a proclamation. They then reported to the Supreme Prime, who showed me the registers of immortality. Both Perfected residences are located on Great Mount Huo.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I traveled with the Lords of Destiny and Life Preservation to the abode of the Lady of Purple Tenuity. The Lady of Purple Tenuity governs the Dark Dragon Palace, which should lie in the north.\n\nOn the sixteenth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I arrived at Fangzhu and saw the residence of the Azure Lord, though I did not see the Azure Lord himself. Instead, I met Han Taihua, and Lady Song of the Vermilion and Azure Pavilion appeared, instructing me on the essentials of divine transcendence and the art of relinquishing form. Han Taihua was initially appointed this year to the Eastern Palace, where he received the books of the Vermilion Palace as a companion to the Jade Consort Han, as recorded in the *True Annals*.\n\nOn the nineteenth day of the eighth month, in another dream, I visited Fangzhu and encountered the Azure Lord on an outing, accompanied by Lord Yang Jiuhua and Immortal Marquis Xu. I then visited Marquis Han, who informed me of matters concerning the celestial registers. This Han is the same as the one previously mentioned in the records as the Keeper of Registers in the Eastern Palace, named Huiqi.\n\nOn the twenty-first day of the eighth month, in a dream, I traveled with the Lord of Life Preservation to Penglai, where I saw Minister Zhou. We then arrived at a vermilion terrace with towering gates, green eaves, and purple chambers. It was said that this was the Office of the Yin Bureau, where a certain Tao was recently appointed to govern this northeastern dark palace. Continuing on, I saw a person with a golden complexion, of medium stature, dressed in soaring-cloud robes and cap. He instructed me on matters of the Dao and its methods. The Lord of Life Preservation said: \"This is Minister Zhou, a minor celestial official of the Dao. He has also expounded on many causes and conditions of the Dao’s work.\" Minister Zhou is the same as the Grand Guest. The *True and Unadorned* also states: \"On Penglai, the Lord of the Yin Bureau oversees the world’s water affairs,\" as recorded in the earlier traditions of Master Ma. It is unclear whether his governance lies in the lesser Fangzhu of Penglai. Many matters of the Dao also appear in the *True and Unadorned Pavilion*.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day of the eighth month, in a dream, I traveled with Attendants Fan and Zhao to Great Mount Heng, where I saw Minister Xue of Nanling and Minister Du of the Central Yellow. They bestowed upon me the method of concealment and transformation. Proceeding further, I saw a thatched hut, exceedingly tall and vast, with sweet springs and various flowers growing around it. Attendant Fan said: \"This is the abode of wandering immortals.\" We entered together and sat beneath the hut, discussing matters of divine transcendence.

First, I visited the Controller of Destinies, who informed me: \"To consume the divine elixir, your name must first be inscribed in the register of immortals; only then may you partake of it.\" Thereafter, I reached Penglai and met with Minister Zhou. He offered me a herb, resembling sophora blossoms but of a purple hue, and said: \"You have not yet tasted this. Once you do, you shall become like me.\" He also spoke of fire dates and intertwined pears—these appear in the *True Reports*, though I remain uncertain of their wondrous nature.\n\nOn the eighth day of the ninth month, I dreamed of wandering through Yiqian with Minister Zhao, visiting the two palaces of Tongchu. The two palaces stood some five or six *li* apart. Yiqian was the palace of female immortals, while Tongchu was that of male immortals. Yet I remain unsure whether they were arranged east-west or north-south.\n\nOn the tenth day of the ninth month, I dreamed of accompanying the Protector of Life to a mountain, its form smooth and rounded, unlike those of the mortal realm. The mountain was called Danlong, and within its clouds lay a grotto inhabited by many immortals. Danlong, I was told, lay south of Yangluo and served as the administrative palace of the Southern Perfected.\n\nOn the fifteenth day of the ninth month, I dreamed of traveling alone to Tongqiao Mountain, where I beheld the Golden Court Lodge, resplendent with pearls and treasures. Its halls and chambers were arranged in orderly rows, their hues of blue and yellow all alike. I was further told that the Golden Court Grotto Palace existed beyond what I saw—this was merely a place of leisure for the assembled immortals, where their stewards conducted affairs, not the residence of Perfected King. When the Great Lord of the East arrived, a separate palace would be prepared, though I did not witness it. Tongxiang and Youbi, the domains governed by Perfected King, were said to have palaces both within and beyond the mountain.\n\nOn the twenty-third day of the ninth month, I dreamed that the *Dinglu* Register came to Zhuyang and led me to the Bureau of Destinies. Along the way, I encountered the Two Ladies, Xuanqing and Ziwei, who rode upon cloud-cakes accompanied by over twenty jade maidens. They addressed the *Dinglu* Register, saying: \"The Controller of Destinies, Ziyang, has been delayed by mortal dust.

The two chapters of the *Daode* are indeed the ultimate essence of Daoist scriptures. The Perfected One of the Great Ultimate also said: \"Recite them ten thousand times, and you shall ascend to heaven in broad daylight.\" From the preceding account to this point, all were written in ink on large sheets of western hemp paper, nearly seven hundred in total.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day of the ninth month, I dreamed of a thing in the northwest of the heavens, dozens of *zhang* in length, blue and red in hue, its head and tail of equal girth, resembling a rainbow. I went to Zhang Li’s place of prohibitions and asked what this thing was. He replied: \"It is called the Beast of Dark Radiance, or sometimes the Water Mother—truly a cause for sorrow. That which is non-being within being is not as profound as non-being within non-being. The principle of emptiness and nothingness is difficult to fathom. This is the manifestation of the calamity of the nine-six, yet who among men knows it?\" Zhang, as the Lord of Prohibitions of the Bureau of Life Preservation, was in charge of petitioning for rain and water, hence my question to him.\n\nThis matter is recorded in the *True Records of the Infant*. Zhang was skilled in discoursing on emptiness and nothingness, and his words always entered into such realms. The Recluse said: \"Non-being within being is the emptiness of self-nature; non-being within non-being is the emptiness of ultimate truth.\" Yet these are mere verbal explanations—what do they truly point to?\n\nThe above eight entries record the events of the ninth month, all noted in dreams.",

The origin of the Shade City Palace remains unknown.\n\nThe above seven entries record the events of the tenth month: two describe visions, and five describe dreams.\n\nOn the third day of the eleventh month, I dreamed of Lord Hong and Minister Tang, who said: \"The stars in the clouds have vanished; you should gaze only toward the southern mountain. Though this may be worth observing, it is not the true essence of seeking the Dao.\" On the third day, since the affairs of the Two Stars had been mentioned, one should not simply rest. On the eighth day, I dreamed of the Lord of Life Register and explained my desire to build a small hut in the eastern part of Zhu Yang, but I was unsure whether this was permissible. He replied: \"The eastern side is a good location, but burial there would be inconvenient. A proper dwelling should be a four-sided courtyard; otherwise, you must at least construct a main hall with eastern and western wings. If you do not, it will be called a 'lonely and inauspicious abode.' Build it as you see fit, then depart, leaving it for those who come after. I have observed Tao’s intentions—he greatly wishes to test you. Do not fear others’ disbelief; if they disbelieve, it will bring me joy.\"\n\nOn the eastern ridge, there are two large hollows, both suitable for constructing a tomb. Initially, I intended to build a vast structure in the western hollow, but it would be better to erect an observation platform near the western hollow, closer to Zhu Yang. Zhou has now decided to bury in the eastern hollow, facing due south.\n\nOn the thirteenth day, I dreamed of Lord Zhou, who said: \"Tao may or may not believe you, for he often likes to test people. Recently, you have also been troubled by many distracting thoughts; you must restrain yourself.\" He repeatedly warned: \"Tao may or may not believe you and wishes to test you.\" Upon reflection, I realize there have indeed been instances of disbelief, stemming from my own wandering thoughts. All conditioned phenomena are ultimately without regret.\n\nIn Zhou’s affairs, I have been both modest and compliant, never acting contrary to his wishes. Yet at times, I have seen him preoccupied, acting carelessly, which seems inconsistent with the proper demeanor of one who attends to the spirits. When Zhou wished to build a separate dwelling, I readily agreed and even offered to survey the land, providing ten thousand coins. He initially planned to construct a three-bay hall with two bays for eastern and western wings. However, when the trees and bamboo were planted and the Daoist’s intentions were not yet settled, disputes arose, and the plan was abandoned. Only a three-bay hall was built. Today, I see how matters have unfolded so closely—clearly, this was not my original intention. Though I had some preliminary plans and still wished to proceed, the remaining instructions stated that only one bay should be retained, as it was a place for former companions. Now, everything is to be repaired to prevent it from falling into disarray.\n\nOn the fifteenth day, I dreamed of Lord Hong, who came to tell me: \"The northwest side of your intended residence has residual qi. I will go with you to examine it.\" We went there and saw a man of extremely ugly appearance. The Lord said: \"This is the Great Capital. It is inauspicious for people to dwell here; you will certainly suffer hardship.\"",

In a former life, he had dealings with Tao of such-and-such, but you did not know him in this life. How could he have come here? Last winter, a man named Gu Daodu returned from the outer river. He said that at Dalei, he suddenly encountered a man in a small boat no larger than a deer’s neck, poorly crafted and barely holding one person, who emerged from the waves and called out Gu’s name. The man said: ‘I am going to the capital and wish to send a letter to Tao Yinju of Maoshan. Yinju had promised to assist me in my efforts to present something to the Lord. The Lord was just then drafting a letter to bestow upon me, but suddenly said: “Since you will not go to the mountain, I will come down myself.”’ The man claimed to be surnamed Peng. Gu hurried to Guangling on his way to the capital to deliver this message, but when he inquired at Hua’s office, he missed the opportunity. He then entrusted the matter to the Daoist Qiang, a disciple of Sizhen, who recorded the details and sent them back. Yinju merely listened to the account without questioning its source. It seems Qiang had privately inquired in the unseen realm. Since this was the report given, the man should no longer come down of his own accord.”\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day, I saw the Record-Keeper and the Lord of Life-Preservation.

He said: “Why do you rush so restlessly among men? Your name is already fixed—do not falter on the worldly path.” *And so on.* This was Lord Wang of Pure Emptiness of Mount Wangwu, chief of the Twenty-Four Perfected who transmit the lower teachings.\n\nOn the tenth day, I saw Lord Hong, commander of the Fan host, who said: “The coming year is wuyin, when the Supreme Mystery’s governance begins. You may don the cap of office.” He added: “Only the dwelling is not yet properly situated.” Lord Hong replied: “Even the great cosmos is ever inconstant—what constancy can human life claim? This place will do well enough.” He also spoke of matters concerning the *Cave Scriptures*. *And so on.* Though I had intended to don the cap that day, the master did not arrive. A light rain fell besides, so the ceremony was not performed.

Perhaps Ziyang is testing him.” The Lord of Life-Preservation asked: “Why did you suddenly take three hundred *hu* of grain from someone?” I answered: “I did not.” He repeated: “Why did you take it?” I again replied: “I did not.” He continued: “If you did not take it, then why say so? There must be some other matter you cannot explain.” During these past ten-day periods, I have been constantly anxious and unsettled over the construction of the house. Fearing both bodily failure and mental agitation, the Record-Keeper was surprised. As for the grain, I heard nothing of it—this was the first I had heard of such a claim. Three hundred *hu* of grain amounts to one hundred thirty *hu* of rice, enough to feed an ordinary person for six years. I suspect this refers to grain meant for the master’s sustenance. Since I have long served as the master’s disciple, providing for his clothing and food, it would be improper to hold me accountable for this.

      "translated_text": "On the fourteenth night, I dreamed of Xu Xianhou and four others conversing among themselves. Xu said: “This dwelling of mine has not been long established—barely two hundred years or so.” Another replied: “Cosmic kalpas pass in the blink of an eye; what is this to speak of as distant?” I did not know who it was, but someone mentioned that Changshi Li had built his residence on the mountain during the Yonghe reign of Emperor Mu of Jin—only a hundred and sixty or seventy years ago.\n\nOn the seventeenth night, I saw Attendant Dinglu and Tang Cheng arrive. The Middle Lord said: “What Lord Xu said recently was most profound.” Tang Cheng discoursed at length on the affairs of the Northern Terrace—too much to inscribe in full. The Northern Terrace is the Terrace of the Northern Emperor in Dengdu.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth night, Attendant Dinglu said: “When thoughts are not kept secret, impure qi cannot be distinguished—he spoke of refining and polishing, and so on.”\n\nOn the twenty-seventh day, I saw the Lord of Life-Preservation and Lord Hong. Lord Hong said: “Do not speak lightly of others’ affairs.” And so forth. This must be some kind of trial, though I know not what.\n\nThe above seven entries pertain to matters in the first month of the *bingshen* year. Four entries record visions; two, dreams.\n\nOn the third day of the third month, I dreamed of Master Hong speaking of the Northern Dipper. And so forth. This again concerns the two stars he oversees, for Hong was the one who transmitted the teaching, hence his repeated mention of them.\n\nOn the seventh day, I dreamed that Attendant Dinglu said: “In the mountains of Linhai, where the forests have burned, a transcendent wanders among the people, calling himself Master Peng. In truth, he is Zheng Xuan, styled Ziyin, the immortal of Luhun. Zhu Jiaofu sent him to observe the dispositions of men and those who cultivate the Dao. He may come seeking you soon—he has already gone to Jian’an. A man of Linhai wrote to the Daoist Zou Yao, saying: ‘Master Peng is here, and I, Yao, have not yet been able to withdraw into quietude, so others have been able to meet him.’ The man swiftly boarded a small boat with a single oar. He sang:\n\n*How vast and dark the Great Empyrean,\nThe numinous ones descend in timely flight.\nThey charge me to sweep the dust from the path,\nTo seek and examine the companions of the clouds.\nThe world’s roads are steeped in defilement,\nTrue sincerity cannot be fathomed.\nI urge my carriage back to Lu Ridge—\nIn the human realm, none are my match.*\n\nHe also chanted this while walking.

      "translated_text": "On the fourteenth day, I saw Attendant Dinglu, who said: “The Lord of Life will come in the middle of next month, and the West Palace’s Attendant Shu will also arrive together—thus I forewarn you.” And so forth. This likely refers to the eighteenth day of the third month, as I have seen a written record of his words from that day.\n\nOn the twentieth day, I dreamed of the Lord of Life. Upon meeting him, he ordered me to fetch a green *ci*-chapter—this single character is blurred beyond recognition. I presented it to the Lord of Life, who said: “This will do, but your heart is not yet true. You must further refine and polish it.” Later, I saw Attendant Jingshang, who said: “The two lords have now gone to Tortoise Mountain. I pass this on so you may know. Your emotions stirred, and after jesting with someone earlier, you allowed demonic influences to encroach. Fortunately, Senior Overseer Gao intervened, or it might have led to disaster. I heard Zhou was in the capital and suddenly suffered from pain and fear—this was likely the reason.” I do not know who Senior Overseer Gao is; he is not among those in the grotto. He also said: “The man who wraps his house and claims not to be a Daoist is an agent of the Northern Star’s Ghost Official—do not trust him. His perverse desires swiftly delude people and corrupt their true *qi*. Hurry to Xu; he has already departed far and cannot stay long—leave at once.”\n\nZhou remained in the capital and stayed with Wang Faming in the Daoist lodge of the Southern Yushu Residence, sleeping in the outer chamber. Was this to consult the wooden divination blocks? That is how he came by this. I told him that many others had inquired about the blocks, but he said nothing in the capital—this matter truly requires discretion.\n\nOn the twenty-fifth day, Attendant Tang Zhao arrived and said he had returned to his former residence. Together, we felt a profound emptiness and discussed the Ninefold Refinement at length. And so forth—both lords instructed him to convey this. And so forth. It was the twenty-second or twenty-third day when he returned to the mountain, but he was utterly unwilling to entertain visitors’ questions. No word of the Ninefold Refinement reached me—how lamentable!\n\nThe above six entries were recorded in the second month: five describe encounters, and one a dream.\n\nOn the third day of the third month, I saw the Lord of Longevity, who warned against eating the heart of grass and other matters. And so forth. The *Purple Text of the Immortals’ Taboos* states this, though it refers only to this single day.\n\nOn the eighth day, I saw Attendant Zhao, who spoke of the world’s demonic spirits and urged caution in all things. And so forth.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth day, I saw the Lord of Longevity, who warned: “Do not violate the mist and dew.” And so forth.\n\nThe above three entries pertain to the third month, all describing encounters.\n\nOn the ninth day of the fourth month, I saw Attendant Dinglu, who said: “The earlier memorial’s language was most refined, though I fear your heart may not fully align with it.” And so forth.

      "translated_text": "Here follows the translation:\n\n---\n\nThe above three entries pertain to matters of the sixth month. One records what was seen, and two record dreams.\n\nOn the first day of the seventh month, I met with Master Hong, who said: \"Beyond the eightfold radiance, your dwelling has already been arranged. There is no need to prepare the bundled herbs.\" And so on—much of it cannot be fully recorded. Herein should be discussed matters of departure and staying, and the gathering of texts.\n\nOn the eighth day, I dreamed again of Marquis Han, the Purple Forbidden Enclosure, Master Yang, and the Register of Destiny. Much was said concerning the subtleties of nature and life, tracing the roots of sin and fortune. Had it been written down, it would have filled three or four sheets of paper. Not to have heard it is a deep regret.\n\nOn the seventeenth day, I met with Attendant Zhao of the Preservation of Life. Much was discussed regarding the calamities and disasters of Heaven and Earth—too much to record. The principles of these matters are difficult to expound.\n\nOn the twenty-third day, I saw a gathering of immortals, thirty in all. Much was said on the fundamentals of human cultivation and the methods of averting misfortune. They also discussed the work of the Ninefold Transmutation. And so on. This entry, being unclear, is the deepest regret.\n\nThe above four entries pertain to matters of the seventh month. Three record what was seen, and one records a dream. Since the beginning of the sixth month, all together they fill one large sheet of white *zhan* paper.\n\nFrom the first month to the end of the seventh month of the *bingshen* year, nearly seven months have passed, comprising twenty-eight entries in total. Eighteen record what was seen, and ten record dreams.\n\nThe above is the table of contents. It is written in three colors—black, vermilion, and yellow—on large white and fine paper, totaling sixteen folios: eight white and eight colored.\n\nFrom the initial communication on the twenty-third day of the fifth month of the *yiwei* year to the end of the seventh month of the present *bingshen* year, there are altogether one hundred and nine entries: sixty-three recording what was seen, and forty-six recording dreams.\n\nFrom the eighth month to the twenty-seventh day of the tenth month, when I departed this world, a span of three months, the written records are no longer clearly preserved.\n\nReviewing the entries made month by month since the beginning of this year, I have been careless and do not know if they are complete. Perhaps the times have grown sparse, and so I have not recorded everything.\n\nRecorded by Zhou Ziyang, *The Elixir Formula of the Jade Fluid of the Nine Perfected*.\n\nIt is said to be lighter than the Ninefold Transmutation and easier than the Ninefold Transmutation. This is on a separate sheet, without date.\n\nOne *jin* of the nine-stemmed purple fungus, *langge* zhi. It comes from southern Min, and is also found north of Juqu.\n\nTwo *dou* of cinnabar-red jade nectar. It comes from southern Min, and is also found in this region.\n\nFor the above two ingredients, finely chop the fungus, then soak it overnight in one *dou* of jade nectar. Bury it on the yang side of a shaded wall, three *cun* from the wall and one *chi* deep in the earth. Use a white ceramic vessel holding about four *dou* to contain it, and cover it with a ceramic plate. Seal it tightly with wax, then cover it with two *cun* of earth. Bury it at noon today and retrieve it at noon tomorrow. Carry it southward to a point twelve paces from the door of your dwelling, and place it at the head of a sleeping grove.\n\nFrom the time of retrieval until noon the following day, boil it in a bronze vessel, ensuring the fire is level with the bottom of the vessel and does not flare beyond its edges. After three boilings, add the remaining *dou* of jade nectar, then increase the fire by about five *fen*, using mugwort or thatch as fuel. Reduce it until only one *dou* remains, then dry the dregs and seal the liquid for three days. After three days, open it: a purple radiance should shine forth, visible even at night without lamplight. This indicates the elixir is complete.\n\nNext, place the dregs in a wooden mortar and pound them three hundred and twenty times. Wrap them tightly in paper. If thrown into water, the water will halt in its flow. If used to seal a house, ten thousand men could not open it. If used to bind bandits, a mob could not move. If used to seal a mountain, the mountain will open; if used to seal a person, the person will submit.\n\nIf one wishes to ascend to Heaven swiftly, one may consume both the liquid and the dregs together—though this will result in death. If one wishes to remain in the world for a time, one should consume them gradually, and in the end, one will attain immortality.\n\nDo not share this with others or let anyone witness its use. It may only be known in the heart and consumed in secret. If others learn of it, this medicine will be wasted in vain.\n\nThe above is one formula, without year, month, or day. It is not known when it was written, but it fills one sheet of white *zhan* paper.\n\nRespectfully corrected.\n\nThe name of this medicine is also said to be \"known only in the heart,\" making it difficult to ponder in detail. I have inquired of all those living with me, young and old alike, and none recall seeing the medicine buried within the wall, nor hearing the sound of pounding in the wooden mortar. Perhaps it was prepared elsewhere—no matter. It is said that consuming it results in death, which gives me pause. Even if warm wine is offered, it may be a ruse to confuse.\n\nIn all, there are four volumes of the original text, written in various colors, totaling sixty-five folios, some in standard script, some in cursive.\n\n*Comprehensive Records of the Zhou Clan, Volume Four* ends here.",
