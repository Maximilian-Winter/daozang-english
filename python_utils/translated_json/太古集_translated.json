  "full_translation": "**The *Taigu Collection***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Taigu Collection*\nAuthored by Jin Du Datong of the Capital, compiled by his disciple Fan Yuanxi. Four scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Taiping* Section.\n\n**Four Prefaces to the *Taigu Collection***\n\nIn my youth, while dwelling in the lands of Yan and Zhao, I heard the name of the Perfected One of Taigu. Yet I never had the fortune to gaze upon his sacred traces, nor to hear the sound of his admonitions—this I have long regretted. Each time I pondered his noble legacy, it was as though I envisioned one dwelling amidst Penglai, Yingzhou, or Fangzhang.\n\nNow, by chance, I have come to meet the Perfected One’s dharma heir, the Great Master Fan, Illuminator of the Universal. The Master is a man of keen intelligence and luminous clarity, his mind as open as a pavilion with eight windows. While residing at Zhengyi in Dongping, his virtue and renown drew both Daoists and layfolk from a thousand *li* around, who flocked to him like clouds. Through their offerings, they erected ritual halls, grand halls, refectories, guest quarters, and granaries. In just three or four years, the structures numbered not merely dozens but hundreds of bays.\n\nOne day, he passed by my humble abode and said: *\"The reason I have labored so earnestly to accomplish these meritorious works is no other than to propagate the teachings and model of my late master. My master, the Perfected One of Taigu, once compiled the *Kunlun Anthology*, but the editions circulated at the time were riddled with omissions and errors. I believe that the standards of our lineage and the wellsprings of Daoist learning depend on the presence of its people, and when they are gone, only the written word remains. Thus, one must never be parted from it, not even for a moment. Though one may build a pagoda of nine tiers with tiles and bricks, it cannot compare to the transmission of the mind-seal through texts, free of even a single misplaced word. Many see only my diligence in construction and repair, but few know that I have also devoted no small effort to mending the gaps, restoring the missing, and correcting the errors in the *Kunlun Anthology*. Now that the work is complete, why do you not write a preface for it?\"*\n\nI replied: *\"In my youth, I was deeply drawn to the Perfected One’s noble legacy, and it has long been my regret that I never beheld his sacred traces. To have my name attached to this collection is a great fortune indeed. Yet what I have heard of him until now has been mere hearsay. As his dharma heir, you have received his direct transmission over many years—none know the Perfected One’s virtues and deeds better than you. I ask that you recount even a fraction of his moral character and noble legacy, to substantiate this preface and lend credence to future generations.\"*\n\nThe Great Master then presented me with a handwritten account of his master’s life, which follows below.\n\nThe Master’s secular surname was Hao, and his family had long resided in Ninghai, where they were among the foremost households of the prefecture. His brothers all pursued Confucian scholarship. His elder brother, styled Junyan, passed the imperial examinations, rising to the rank of *Chaolie Dafu* and serving as magistrate of Changyi County. The Master alone, from childhood, displayed exceptional intelligence and a disposition both serene and expansive, bearing the unmistakable air of one destined to transcend the mundane world.\n\nThe Patriarch Chongyang, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, traveled from Qin to Qi in the *Dinghai* year of the Dading era. Upon reaching Ninghai, he met the Master and at once declared him a divine immortal. Later, on Kunlun Mountain, he transmitted the robe before the assembly. After receiving the transmission, the Master did not regard himself as having attained the Dao. Instead, he concealed his light, often begging for alms in the regions of Zhen and Xingming. Passing beneath the Southern Stone Bridge of Zhaozhou, he maintained silence, sitting in meditation for six years. Neither cold nor heat, wind nor rain, could dislodge him from that place. Children who came to play saw him as a mere earthen or wooden figure, even piling bricks and stones around him, yet he remained undisturbed.\n\nThe youngest daughter of the Lord of Changyi was married to Guo Changqian, the Vice Prefect of Zhen. When the Guo couple traveled to Zhen together, their carriage procession was grand. Passing the Stone Bridge, they learned of the Master’s presence beneath it. They halted their carriage to pay their respects, offering him clothing and provisions in abundance. The Master, however, seemed not to recognize them and accepted nothing. The lady wept with emotion, and Guo sighed in wonder before departing after some time.\n\nThe Master’s resolve to sever worldly ties was so firm that he could devote himself wholeheartedly to the Dao. As months and years passed, his spirit moved and resonated with the unseen. One day, south of Luanzhou, a divine being bestowed upon him the *Great Book of Changes*. Suddenly, he attained great awakening, gaining foresight into many matters. His name spread throughout the world.\n\nDuring the Da’an era, the imperial court bestowed upon him a decree with the title: *Taigu Perfected One of Quanning and the Entire Dao*—this was his honorific. After receiving the *Book of Changes* in Luanzhou, his predictions of fortune and misfortune were precise to the finest detail. Moreover, he knew his own lifespan, which was to be seventy-three years. When the time came, he took leave of his disciples, and passed away without illness.\n\nHis writings fill six volumes. The *Veritable Records* record these details as above.\n\nYet what was once heard in Yan and Zhao still did not encompass all that the Perfected One possessed.\n\nAfter completing the preface, the Great Master said to Bi: \"You compose the preface for the collected writings of my late master, yet include the rise of the Orthodox Unity teachings—would this not be superfluous?\"\n\nI replied: \"Recorded sayings and accounts transmit the mind; meritorious constructions and establishments manifest traces. At seventy-five years of age, looking back upon the earlier transmissions in Yan and Zhao, it is as though separated by two lifetimes. Had the Great Master not compiled the master’s posthumous writings and traced his deeds, the Perfected One’s lingering influence and remaining power would have no means to be revealed. Moreover, how could later students and younger generations easily come to know these things? The Great Master, relying upon the Perfected One’s Daoist legacy, has erected the meritorious works of Orthodox Unity, illuminating the eastern lands. Now, by recounting these deeds, you stir the hearts of learners, making them easier to comprehend.\"\n\nThe ancients said: \"Though no elders remain, their models still endure.\" Alas, are not the meritorious works of Orthodox Unity likewise a model of the Perfected One’s Daoist legacy?\n\nThe Great Master said, \"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThe Great Master’s personal name was Yuanxi, a descendant of the former Song dynasty’s eminent minister, Duke Wenzheng. Preface by Feng Bi, former Hanlin Academician.\n\nIn the summer of the *guisi* year, I journeyed north from Daliang to Tongtai, where I heard of a Daoist master surnamed Fan on Mount Tianping. The Great Master’s reputation in the Dao stood lofty, and he cherished worthies and delighted in affairs, foremost in the eastern lands. Scholars from all directions flocked to him, and the master aided and succored them without wearying. Thus, I wished to meet him, though I had not yet been able.\n\nLater, I returned to my hometown, where two years passed. In the *bingjia* year, I traveled south and heard his name even more resoundingly. Thereupon, I went to Dongyuan and was granted an audience at his feet. His discourse was vast and profound, his heart open and untrammeled—soaring as one not of this dusty world. I was astonished and deeply impressed, and so lodged at his abode. Over twenty days passed, and our mutual regard grew profound.\n\nAt parting, he produced a volume and said, “This is the *Songs and Poems of the Great Ancient* by my master, Hao Kunyu. I now intend to carve new woodblocks to transmit it—you must write a preface for me.” I accepted and read it, only to find that Master Feng, the Academician, had already inscribed its opening. After poring over it again and again, I sighed: “Was this not one of the ancient men of the Dao? How refined his words, how wondrous his principles!”\n\nI have often thought: when scholar-officials are born and pursue learning, they say, ‘I wish to bring good to all under Heaven, to aid the ruler and enrich the people.’ Yet if their aspirations do not align with the times, few fulfill their wishes. Many fall into hidden sorrow, resentment, and self-inflicted harm. They cannot achieve universal good, nor do they preserve personal integrity—deeply lamentable indeed. Those outside the worldly realm, however, harbor no ambition to save the age. They resolutely cultivate and refine themselves, making longevity their sole concern. With single-minded devotion and meticulous care, their progress renews daily. Though they may not ascend in broad daylight, they preserve bodily wholeness and spiritual vitality, living out their years in robust health. How far removed they are from those who chase external things, ensnared by hollow fame, squandering wisdom and wearing down their essence—all without benefit to our teaching!\n\nTake Master Hao, for instance: from youth, he set his resolve and stood unwavering. During his years of seclusion, his conduct was as pure as jade and as steadfast as pine. One day, he discoursed on the profound and expounded the *Yi*, his spirit enlightened and heart attuned. He composed writings to transmit after his passing. Master Fan, in turn, has propagated his teacher’s Dao, amplifying its influence in this age. He has also edited and published his master’s posthumous works to awaken later learners—both are towering figures beyond the worldly realm. Thus, stirred by these reflections, I write to address the twin failures of our generation.\n\nIn the autumn of the eighth month, this preface was written by Liu Qi of Hunshui.\n\n---\n\nThe late master, the Perfected Great Ancient of Quanning, Master Hao, met his teacher in Ninghai and received the transmission on Kunlun. Divine beings bestowed upon him the *Yi*, and the Great Peace granted him his title. As Master Feng, the Academician, has already recounted in his preface, I need not repeat it here. His extant works include *A Discussion on the Three Teachings Entering the Yi* (one fascicle), *Direct Words for Teaching* (one fascicle), *Commentaries on the Heart Sutra* and *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* (one fascicle each), and *The Great Ancient Collection* (fifteen fascicles), within which is *A Concise Exegesis of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* (one fascicle).\n\nWhen the master first arrived from the west, the people of Zhen Ding had already begun carving woodblocks in Dai. After returning to his later years, he composed many more works, and even revised some of his earlier collections. Common transcriptions, however, are rife with errors. Though I wished to correct and renew them, I lacked the leisure.\n\nI reflect that my late master’s Dao uniquely grasped the untransmitted mysteries of antiquity. He refined it with the imagery of the *Yi* and expanded it with the joy of Chan, achieving both subtlety and vastness. Standing apart from the world, his teachings and discourses are what people long to see. Yet today, errors abound like the *lu* and *yu* fish, truth and falsehood intermingle, and later learners are left bewildered. It falls to his disciples to bear this responsibility.\n\nI, Yuanxi, though dull-witted, have relied on the shade of the Dao. Now, with ample leisure while sweeping and tending the Orthodox Unity abode on Dongyuan, I have meticulously collated the master’s later revisions and previously unseen works, establishing a definitive edition to carve and transmit. I dare to place these unpolished words at the head of the volume.\n\nThe perfected ones perceive all things with equanimity, so their words aim solely to clarify principle. They do not necessarily string together four- and six-character lines, nor pluck green to match white, as those who craft literature do, boasting of tonal rhythms and stylistic elegance. In Chan learning, it is said: “Coarse words and fine speech alike embody the supreme meaning.” In the Confucian tradition, it is said: “Words suffice when they convey meaning,” and “To grasp the intent is to attain it.” If scholars do not aspire to the Dao but seek only ornate expression, how can this be the Dao of daily diminution—diminishing further and further?\n\nThe masters of old, upon hearing a single word or phrase from the teacher, would deem him a divine immortal. They treated him as kin beyond the worldly realm, and his lifelong instruction was strict and unyielding—enough to rival Linji of the Daoist gate. Were he still alive today, he would surely raise the true command, sit in judgment over the great thousandfold world, and even the lion and elephant kings would retreat in deference. Foxes and wild beasts, I know, could not gather in his presence. His passing beyond the light—how can one not sigh in sorrow?\n\nYet his books remain. Take them and read: there will surely be those whose eyes see but cannot perceive, whose mouths gape but cannot speak.\n\nOn the Winter Solstice of the *bingshen* year, this preface was respectfully written by Fan Yuanxi, heir to the teaching in the wild garb of Kunlun.\n\n---\n\nThe Great Dao is indistinct, entering existence from non-being;\nThe creative transformations of Heaven and Earth return from being to non-being.\nThus, being enters non-being, and non-being emerges from being.\nThe primordial qi, existing before Heaven and Earth, once manifested in the Three Powers, gradually gave rise to the myriad things.\nIn the movements of the myriad things, there is generation and restraint, benefit and harm, compliance and opposition, good and evil, right and wrong.\nLike gathers with like, things divide by kind.\nWhen hierarchy is ordered, the Way of peace flourishes; when ranks lose their proper place, the time of closure arrives.\nAt the outset of affairs, one may lie hidden; at the appointed hour, one may leap forth.\nTreading on frost foretells the coming of solid ice; when dragons battle, their blood is black and yellow.\nIn *Tun*, it is favorable to dwell in integrity; in *Song*, sincerity must be tempered with caution.\nTo correct the world, one may dwell among the ignorant; to issue commands, one may employ poisonous *gu* for clarity.\nWith firm advance, wait for *Xu*; with gentle conduct, there is *Bo*.\nGoing forth, value *Tongren*; calamity arises from *Daguo*.\n*Gen* halts it, *Dui* delights it; *Bi* adorns and *Li* clings.\n*Jian* is stagnation, *Kan* is peril.\n*Kui* is separation, *Heng* is constancy.\nRenewal can secure the tripod; losing rhythm overturns the army.\nRadiance allows the world to be seen; obscurity permits retreat to the mountains and forests.\n\nNot by divine transformation or numinous penetration—who else could partake in this?\n\nI once delved deeply into the *Zhouyi*, abridging its *Zhengyi* to compose the *Cantong*. Therein, I delineated the Two Modes and Four Images, the Three Powers and Eight Trigrams, the Six Pitch Pipes and Nine Palaces, the Seven Governors and Five Phases. The stars spread forth in array; the sun and moon trace their celestial paths. Being and non-being blend into oneness, forming diagrams and images.\n\nIn response to inquiries, I set forth my thoughts in poems, lyrics, songs, and rhapsodies—fifteen scrolls in all, divided into three volumes. Longing for the winds of the Great Antiquity, I titled it *The Anthology of Great Antiquity*. Now, \"Great\" refers to the Supreme Simplicity, Supreme Beginning, Supreme Origin, and Supreme Simplicity; \"Antiquity\" refers to the Remote Past, High Antiquity, Deep Antiquity, and Eternal Past. My aim is that future seekers of the Dao may know this endeavor is no empty pursuit.\n\nMoreover, no phenomenon is greater than Heaven and Earth; no transformation is greater than yin and yang. The essence of Heaven and Earth, the root of yin and yang—these are the Two Qi. The Wood Dragon and Metal Tiger, the Crimson Phoenix and Dark Tortoise—these are the Four Images. Six, seven, eight, nine—these are the numbers. Knife-point and lead-mercury—these are the instruments of generation and completion. Spirit’s encounter and qi’s union—these are the terms for nature and destiny.\n\nThe Purple Palace and Cinnabar Palace, the Numinous Terrace and Jade Tower, the Crimson Towers and Vermilion Gates, the Jade Cavern and Pearl Curtain, the Mysterious Barrier and Yang Path, the Earth Gate and Heavenly Portal, Jade Fluid and Golden Essence, Yellow Sprout and White Snow, True Water and True Fire, the Alchemical Maiden and Infant, the Stone Man and Wooden Horse, the Nine Worms and Three Corpses, the Golden Elder and Yellow Dame, the Mushroom of Immortality and Cinnabar—all these are the workings of the Five Phases’ transformations.\n\nIn general, when movement and stillness are both forgotten, when nature is perfected and destiny secured, one accords with the spontaneous. The Dao of spontaneity is most easy to know, most easy to practice—yet none in the world know it, none practice it, for desire and delusive thoughts are what harm it.\n\nIf one casts off falsity and follows the real, transcends the dust and leaves the dharmas, mingles with the world yet remains extraordinary, stands alone yet does not change, embraces the One and never departs, circulates without weariness—then one may nearly attain the immortal’s way. Yanzi possessed the virtue of \"sitting in forgetfulness\"; Meng Ke achieved the merit of \"nurturing simplicity\"—both were devoted to a single matter.\n\nNow, I set forth the great outlines, revealing the various alternate names. Though paths differ, they converge in the same end; though names are many, the principle is one. This is shown to benefit later learners, to strengthen the resolve of the Dao-heart and ensure purity without selfishness. If one holds fast to this resolve until the end, one’s name will be inscribed in the immortal registers, forever becoming a perfected one—with numinous transformations boundless and the power to ascend on feathered wings.\n\nThus, none may enter who are not of my gate; none may affirm who are not of my Dao. Yet what is so is so, and what is not so is also affirmed as so.\n\nIn the winter solstice of the sixth day after the full moon of the eleventh month, the eighteenth year of the Dading reign [1178], self-preface.\n\n*Anthology of Great Antiquity*, Scroll One\nComposed by Guangningzi Hao Datong\n\n**A Concise Exegesis of the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, with Preface**\n\nTeaching is that by which the Dao is born. The Dao has no name in itself, yet we force a name upon it and call it \"Dao.\" Teaching has no form in itself, yet we borrow words to manifest its instruction. The essence of teaching encompasses both being and non-being. Thus, to speak of it as non-being is to preserve the substance of the Dao; to speak of it as being is to preserve its function. The substance is taken as non-being, while its function is taken as efficacy.\n\nIf one says that the formed arises from the formless, then how do Heaven and Earth come to be? If teaching transforms the unknowing, then how does true knowledge emerge? Now, when the Supreme Ultimate brushes forth division, the Three Powers take their places; the Five Phases are arrayed at the Mysterious Ultimate, the Eight Trigrams are ordered in the vast expanse. The Seven Governors are set in motion, the celestial cycles establish their norms. Myriad images hang in the firmament above, while the numinous and the coarse are nurtured upon the earth below.\n\nThus, the sage looks up and observes, looks down and examines, shaping and aiding all things. He trusts the four seasons to generate the ten thousand beings, penetrating transformation to traverse the realm of spirits. The passage of essence has no gate; the abode of spirit has no cavity. Still and unmoving, yet responsive and instantly penetrating.\n\nAs for those who cultivate reality and attain the Dao, they employ its virtue to transform the ten directions, their wisdom transcending the Three Realms. Ascending and descending, dragons chant and tigers roar; waxing and waning, serpents hide and tortoises conceal. Going and coming, spirits wail and ghosts weep; extending and contracting, self and other are both forgotten. At such a time, lightning flashes and the eight bounds blaze with radiance; thunder crashes and the three mountains tremble in awe. Cranes soar and phoenixes dance, deer return and rams circle. Vital qi brims over, auspicious clouds gather thickly. The ten thousand spirits array themselves, while the hordes of demons flee in concealment. The Mysterious Pearl scatters upon the terrace of spirit; lingzhi mushrooms sprout together in the Purple Palace. The flower of awakening just unfolds, the Dharma-ocean is fathomless in depth. One enters directly into the Mysterious Capital, forever transcending the dusty realm.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"a hair swallowing the great sea, a mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru,\" by \"the wooden horse neighing, the stone man singing in harmony.\" All these are expressions of post-enlightenment realization, spoken of only when unavoidable.\n\nThis Dao, when employed in accord with the natural order, brings the Two Modes into sequence and harmonizes the hundred things. When practiced in reversal, the six positions topple and the Five Phases fall into chaos. Who but one of utmost mystery and subtlety could partake of this?\n\nThus, I have briefly set forth the profound text, abridging it into essentials.\n\nPreface written on the nineteenth day of the fourth month in the summer of the *wuxu* year, the eighteenth of the Dading reign [1178].\n\nThe Dao of the *Changes* takes Qian as its gate, Kun as its door, the Northern Asterism as its pivot, the sun and moon as its revolutions, the four seasons as its officers, the Five Phases as its permutations, quiescence and emptiness as its substance, response and movement as its function, firmness and yielding as its foundation, purity and stillness as its norm, clouds and rain as its benefit, the ten thousand images as its model, the manifold kinds as one, fortune and misfortune as the constant, life and death as the origin, being and non-being as its teaching.\n\nThus, we know that teaching and transformation must reside in humanity, that the goodness of substance and function must reside in the heart, and that change and penetration must reside in spirit. With one spirit, the myriad spirits are encompassed; with one Dharma, the boundless Dharma is embraced; with one heart, the innumerable hearts are governed. From antiquity to the present, it endures unbroken, ever-present.\n\nThis is the meaning of the *Concise Exegesis of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*.\n\nThe celestial body is vast in its Dao, pure, empty, broad, and distant, unalloyed yang without admixture. Qian universally applies its virtue, revolving without cease, responding and transforming without end. It begins well and harmoniously penetrates, gathering and uniting the host of spirits, communicating the principles of things and their natures. Like Xihe, it is steadfast and firm, harmonizing and aiding, benefiting with firmness and correctness.\n\nHow wondrous and supremely subtle! Following this Dao in practice, one adapts to the times and transforms accordingly.\n\nThe Mysterious Origin, the Sacred Ancestor, sets the compass and square for later generations, illuminating the world. It provides for the ten thousand things, and the appropriateness of all images is drawn from Qian’s function. It governs clouds and rain: cloud qi flows and spreads, rain and moisture are distributed, reaching all beings without obstruction or blockage.\n\nIt illuminates the beginning and the end, clarifying the Dao of the ten thousand things from start to finish. At the beginning, it lies hidden; at the end, it soars and leaps. When concealment is fitting, it conceals; when flight is fitting, it flies. Thus, it is clear and penetrating in the Dao of beginning and end.\n\nIt rides the six positions in due season. Yang has six positions, yin has six positions; firmness and function follow the time, beginning and end as one. If one does not employ them according to the time—flying when concealment is called for, concealing when flight is called for, killing when life is called for, giving life when killing is called for—the six positions, not ridden in due season, will instead bring harm.\n\nThe tiger lies in submission, the dragon takes flight—yin submits, yang flies; yang gives life, yin kills.\n\nIt controls the cosmos and commands the universe, ascending and descending without cease, revolving without end.\n\nIt transforms power into efficacy. The Dao of application: shedding the old and following the new, proceeding gradually, is called \"change\"; sudden alteration from being to non-being is called \"transformation.\" In the Dao of Qian, whether things gradually change or suddenly transform, all rely on it for their beginning, for nurturing the ten thousand things, for unifying the functions of concealment and manifestation.\n\nIt rectifies nature and assists destiny. The function of Qian is seen in its transformations. The efficacy of transformation enables things to each rectify their nature and destiny. \"Nature\" is the innate quality bestowed by Heaven, such as the distinctions between firmness and yielding, slowness and swiftness. \"Destiny\" is what humans receive, such as the conditions of nobility or baseness, long life or early death.\n\nThus, we know that the formless arises from the formed, and the formed is burdened by its form. Only the Dao of Heaven, though formed, can be firm without being burdened, for it rides transformation to govern the great vessel, still and concentrated when at rest, upright and direct when in motion, never losing the Great Harmony.\n\nIn its substance, Qian is still and abiding, concentrated and unwavering. In its movement, it is upright and free from deviation. Not losing the great benefit—is this not the essence of rectifying nature and destiny?\n\nQian can rectify and stabilize the nature and destiny of things, for the nature and destiny of things each have their own essence. What is received at birth is called \"nature\"; what arises from momentary thoughts and considerations is called \"emotion.\" Thus, in truth, preservation resides in nature.\n\nFrom the deviant perspective, preservation resides in emotion. When emotion departs and nature remains, destiny naturally returns to assist it. Preserving and uniting the Great Harmony—such is the function of Qian. Pure yang, firm and vehement: without harmony and compliance, things cannot receive benefit, and rectitude is lost. If one can safeguard peace and convergence, the Dao of Great Harmony endures, enabling all things to rectify their natures and destinies and attain longevity.\n\nProfit and integrity thus arise. Integrity solidifies the function of the stem, benefiting all things. Within, it resides in firm strength, single-minded and unshifting; without, it employs soft weakness, upright and free from deviation. Like the craftsman’s compass and square, the noble person employs this Dao to shape the myriad things and teach transformation without end.\n\nThe noble person is self-strengthening, operating without cease, cycling from end to beginning, ever robust and flourishing—the Dao of the noble person is complete. The *jun* is the master; the *zi* is love. The master occupies the superior position, loving others and aiding all things. Those who study the Dao penetrate the function of Qian and enact great benefit, ceaseless day and night, without decline or retreat. The noble person, self-strengthening and diligent, never ceasing, extends this only to the multitude. Their teachings and commands are worthy of adoption.\n\nThis clarifies how the noble person embodies the Dao in action: inwardly firm, outwardly compliant, still and concentrated, moving upright and direct. Like clouds drifting and rain falling, the four seasons proceed in order, and the myriad things come to life—all categories of beings receive universal care.\n\nThe earth embodies the greatness of the Dao: deep, solid, and purely substantial, bearing all without exception. Kun’s function is of profound virtue: soft, harmonious, and thickly supportive, embracing all impurities, complying with the multitude of beings, and penetrating the principles of things. Like the virtue of Qian, its virtue is vast and great, nourishing and benefiting all categories of beings, fostering the myriad existences, each flowing unimpeded.\n\nAffairs are fully accommodated, flexibly connected. Adapting to the times and awaiting things, yielding oneself to advance others—such is the noble person: compliant yet rectifying the stem, achieving fine and beautiful merit. The feminine extreme transforms into the masculine: not initiating affairs but harmonizing after another’s lead. Humility and reverence illuminate; if one advances others, others will advance oneself—first feminine, then transformed into masculine.\n\nThe southwest is inauspicious: yin softness cannot stand, and things suffer harm. The northeast establishes merit: will and intent harmonize, nature and conduct are soft and weak, yet when facing affairs, decisions are made without partiality—this is the meaning of rectitude.\n\nRiding this to reach that, attaining rectitude and complying with the will, one preserves constancy. Following the ancestral wind of the Yellow Emperor: only governance is obeyed, adapting to change with the times. Nurturing the myriad existences, its wondrous function is vast and boundless, nothing distant or estranged. It accords with Heaven’s wisdom: conduct does not violate propriety, compliant and free from deviation.\n\nThick and able to bear all things, utmost compliance embraces and upholds without disordering the multitude. The ultimate principle is inexhaustible: abiding in the center and attaining rectitude, following nature. Embracing vastness and radiating brilliance, harmonizing light with the multitude, neither haughty nor solitary.\n\nCategories of beings flourish in tranquility: harmonious qi fills and overflows, enabling things to live. Words of goodness lead to ascent; the Dao returns to the multitude of beings. Unrelenting from beginning to end—this is the noble person’s rectitude.\n\nTrue appearance is not appearance: relying on reverence and treading rectitude, enacting destiny with merit, turning inward to observe—appearance is real yet not existent, the reality of non-appearance, for reality is not appearance.\n\nTrue emptiness is not empty: not dwelling in action, not contriving—emptiness is truly not preserved, yet the true is not empty, for the true is not empty.\n\nPreserving all mysteries: plain and unadorned, cultivating benevolence and upholding rectitude. The vessel aligns with the profound: pure, refined, and immaculate, the will firmly fixed on unity. Vast and expansive in bestowal, centered and unbiased, at peace with gain and loss, adapting to the times to fulfill the fruition of the Dao.\n\n*Taigu Collection, Scroll One Concluded*\n*Taigu Collection, Scroll Two*\n\n**Hao Datong of Guangning, *Illustrated Exegesis of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* #1**\n\n**Qian Multitude Diagram**\nQian serves as the function of Heaven, while Heaven is the substance of Qian. Heaven is thus limpid, vacuous, lofty, and distant—pure yang unadulterated, its singular qi operating in obscurity, transforming and engendering the myriad things. One may emulate Heaven’s function but not its substance. Hence it is called the Qian image, also termed \"old yang.\" Its number is nine. As Qian represents Heaven, it has three lines; three multiplied yields nine. This hexagram, when doubled, has six lines, each designated \"nine.\"\n\nThe Way of Heaven resembles an inverted canopy, its form like a hen’s egg. It takes Kun as its consort, thereby begetting six offspring.\n\n**Kun Image Diagram**\nKun serves as the function of Earth, while the nurturing soil is Kun’s substance. Earth is thus purely thick and broadly sustaining—pure yin unadulterated. The dual qi ascend and descend, and things undergo transformation. One may emulate Earth’s function but not its substance. Hence it is called the Kun image, termed \"old yin.\" Its number is six. As Kun represents Earth, it has six lines; the image is thus designated \"six.\" This hexagram, when doubled, has six lines, each designated \"six.\" Heaven has three lines, which, combined with Kun’s six lines, yield the number nine. Only Earth, belonging to old yin...\n\n**Sun Image Diagram**\nThe Sun is the essence of great yang, corresponding to the Li hexagram. Its number is seven, termed \"young yang.\" The Li hexagram has long lines above and below, with a short line in the center, forming four lines. Combined with Qian’s three lines, it yields the number seven. It is called \"young yang\" because the Way of Qian Heaven covers and shades the myriad things—limpid, vacuous, vast, and distant, pure yang unadulterated, its singular qi operating in obscurity, termed \"old yang.\" Though the Sun’s Way lacks such magnitude, its brilliance illumines the eight directions, universally reaching all under Heaven. When it emerges, it is day; when it sets, it is night—hence it is called \"young yang.\"\n\n**Moon Image Diagram**\nThe Moon is the essence of great yin, corresponding to the Kan hexagram. Its number is eight, termed \"young yin.\" The Kan hexagram has short lines above and below, with a long line in the center, forming five lines. Combined with Qian’s three lines, it yields the number eight. It is called \"young yin\" because the Way of Kun Earth is vastly sustaining, termed \"old yin.\" The Moon’s brilliance waxes and wanes; when it emerges, it is night, its illumination boundless, like Earth’s vastness—hence it is called \"young yin.\" The Sun and Moon are the children of Heaven and Earth, inheriting Qian but not Kun, for children follow the father.\n\n**Heaven and Earth in Harmonious Union Diagram**\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite, there is peace; when they do not, there is obstruction. This means Heaven’s yang qi descends into Earth, while Earth’s yin qi ascends to Heaven—this is Heaven and Earth uniting to achieve peace. If Heaven’s qi rises and Earth’s qi descends, the two qi do not interact, and the myriad things become obstructed, unable to flow freely. Thus, Heaven and Earth should unite, not remain separate; the myriad things should prosper, not stagnate. Without prosperity, there is obstruction. Hence, the Way of Heaven experiences peace for eleven years and obstruction for twelve. A full cycle of years completes its phases of obstruction and peace.\n\n**Conjunction of Sun and Moon Diagram**\nWhen the Sun and Moon conjoin, they unite; when they do not, there is the new moon and full moon. The Sun completes one circuit of Heaven in a year, while the Moon completes one circuit in a month. In a year without intercalary months, there are twelve months. Each month has its conjunction, hence it is said: when the Sun and Moon are separated by a wall, it is called *shuo* (new moon). *Shuo* means dawn. Dawn occurs on the first day of each month, when the Sun and Moon conjoin beneath the Sun—this is called *shuo*. When the Sun and Moon are in opposition, it is called *wang* (full moon); when they are a quarter apart, it is called *xian* (first or last quarter). These are times when they do not conjoin. When light is exhausted and the body is concealed, it is called *hui* (dark moon), approaching conjunction.\n\n**Heaven’s Odd Numbers and Symbolic Images Diagram**\nHeaven is pure yang and possesses yang numbers. Yang numbers include one, three, five, seven, and nine. Summed together, they total twenty-five, forming Qian’s yang numbers. These are called \"odd\" because odd numbers form four square directions with a center—this is the meaning. Heaven’s numbers are five; when multiplied by themselves, they yield the odd transformation numbers. Thus, it is said: north one, east three, south seven, west nine, center five—all yang numbers. The yang numbers are one, three, five, seven, and nine.\n\n**Earth’s Even Numbers and Symbolic Images Diagram**\nEarth is pure yin and possesses yin numbers. Yin numbers include two, four, six, eight, and ten. Summed together, they total thirty, forming Kun’s yin numbers. These are called \"even\" because even numbers form four square directions with a center—this is the meaning. Thus, it is said: east eight, west four, north six, south two, center ten—all yin numbers. The yin numbers are two, four, six, eight, and ten. Earth is fundamentally square, hence termed \"even\"; Heaven is fundamentally round, hence termed \"odd.\"\n\n**Twenty-Eight Constellations Aligned with the Four Symbols Diagram**\nThe celestial image comprises twenty-eight constellations, totaling 365¼ degrees, distributed across the twelve terrestrial divisions as the constant path of the stars. The Sun, Moon, Five Phases, and Seven Governors serve as the weft, circulating through the degrees, giving rise to transformation. Divided into the four corners and four cardinal directions, the east, south, west, and north each attain their numbers, harmonizing with the functions of Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon. Therein lie the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, and the Dark Warrior.\n\n**Twenty-Four Solar Terms Aligned with the Seventy-Two Pentads Diagram**\n\nHeaven and Earth establish their positions; the Sun and Moon move in their courses. The eight nodes and four seasons revolve naturally. Thus, when heat departs, cold arrives; when spring recedes, autumn comes, completing the work of a year. Within this yearly cycle lie seventy-two pentads. A pentad signifies the timely manifestations, revealing that things possess their own nature, responding to the solar terms—five days and seven fen constitute one pentad. From the Beginning of Spring to the Greater Cold, comprising one year, there are twelve celestial divisions, to which the phenological signs naturally correspond in due season.\n\n**River Chart**\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth’s odd and even combine to form the River Chart, totaling fifty-five. This Chart and Book, however, comprise forty-five numbers, permeating the Nine Palaces in the likeness of a tortoise’s form: nine at the head, one at the tail, three on the left, seven on the right, two and four as the shoulders, six and eight as the feet—this is the natural image. Upon its back lie the Five Phases, by which one may discern the past and future, divining omens of fortune and misfortune. Thus, it communicates the virtue of the divine spirits and categorizes the conditions of the myriad things. Heaven produces numinous objects, and the sages take them as models, forming the Chart and Book. One, three, five, seven, and nine are odd, belonging to yang and residing in the center and the four cardinal directions. Two, four, six, and eight are even, belonging to yin and residing in the four corners. Only the earth number ten lies within the dragon’s belly, not visibly manifest, and so it is preserved without depiction.\n\n**Diagram of Transformation**\nThe Dao of Change is unfathomable without divine power and unknowable without sagely wisdom. Thus, there is the Great Simplicity, the qi not yet manifest. There is the Great Beginning, the inception of qi. There is the Great Commencement, the inception of form. There is the Great Pristine, the inception of substance. When qi, form, and substance are complete yet not yet separated, this is called primordial chaos. Once chaos divides, the Two Modes fall into order, and the myriad things transform and take shape. Before chaos, there is nothingness; after chaos, there is being. From the alternation of being and non-being arises chaos—chaotic and undifferentiated—when Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, twice conjoin, the time of harmonious union. The Five Phases Diagram\n\n**Diagram of the Five Phases**\nThe Five Phases are Water, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Wood. All numbers of Heaven and Earth each have their correspondences, generated from the Five Phases. Thus, Heaven One and Earth Six combine to generate Water. Earth Two and Heaven Seven combine to generate Fire. Heaven Three and Earth Eight combine to generate Wood. Earth Four and Heaven Nine combine to generate Metal. Heaven Five and Earth Ten combine to generate Earth. The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five, giving rise to the Five Phases, whose numbers are thus revealed. Seven counts yield Water; nine counts yield Fire; eleven counts yield Wood; thirteen counts yield Metal; fifteen counts yield Earth. These are the numbers of Heaven and Earth that generate the Five Phases.\n\n**Diagram of the Celestial Stems**\nThe Ten Celestial Stems are: Jia and Yi, symbolizing Wood; Bing and Ding, symbolizing Fire; Geng and Xin, symbolizing Metal; Ren and Gui, symbolizing Water; Wu and Ji, symbolizing Earth. Wood as a body symbolizes spring, engendering the myriad beings, governing the hun-soul, its numinous presence manifest in sprouts. Fire as a body symbolizes summer, nurturing the myriad things, governing the nature, its spirit manifest in blossoms. Metal as a body symbolizes autumn, maturing the species, governing the po-soul, its qi manifest in fruit. Water as a body symbolizes winter, consummating the myriad beings, governing the life essence, its essence manifest in roots. Earth flourishes as the symbol, added to the proper seasons of the four quarters, present in each time.\n\n**Diagram of the Three Powers Entering the Crucible for Transformation**\nThe Dao of the Three Powers comprises Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. The Celestial Origin possesses the category of the Ten Stems; the Terrestrial Origin possesses the category of the Twelve Branches; the Human Origin possesses the category of the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams. These Three Powers, matched with the Branches and Stems, the Five Phases, and the symbolic trigrams, enter into emptiness and emerge from nothingness. Within the realm of emptiness and nothingness, they engender, nurture, and perfect the work of the myriad things without weariness. Through creation and transformation, they necessarily attain their transmutation. This transformation and creation are fundamentally the transformation of non-action. The crucible has three tiers and twelve gates; fire resides within, refining the true qi of the Three Powers to harmonize and complete the Dao.\n\n**Diagram of the Eight Trigrams Gathering in the Tripod for Elixir Refinement**\nThe Eight Trigrams gather into the tripod as follows: Qian symbolizes Heaven; Kun symbolizes Earth; Zhen symbolizes the dragon issuing forth in thunder; Xun symbolizes the tiger arising in wind; Kan symbolizes clouds descending in rain; Li symbolizes lightning flashing in light; Gen symbolizes mountains communicating qi; Dui symbolizes marshes delighting in things. Through Qian’s vigor in movement and Kun’s compliance in action, the three sons and three daughters are obtained, wondrous in great function and beneficial to the myriad things. Thus, the attributes of thunder, wind, clouds, rain, and lightning all originate from and return to the clear sky—hence, the tripod. As an instrument, the tripod holds fire below, refining within it Heaven, Earth, thunder, wind, fire, mountains, water, and marshes to produce the Great Elixir.\n\n**Diagram of the Twelve Pitch Pipes**\nThe pitch of Yellow Bell corresponds to the eleventh month in use, its length nine cun and three fen, diminished by one part to generate Forest Bell. Forest Bell corresponds to the sixth month in use, increased by one part to generate Great Budding. Great Budding corresponds to the first month in use, diminished by one part to generate Southern Regulator. Southern Regulator corresponds to the eighth month in use, increased by one part to generate Maiden Purity. Maiden Purity corresponds to the third month in use, diminished by one part to generate Responsive Bell. Responsive Bell corresponds to the tenth month in use, increased by one part to generate Without Shooting. Without Shooting corresponds to the ninth month in use, diminished by one part to generate Pressed Bell. Pressed Bell corresponds to the second month in use, increased by one part to generate Level Rule. Level Rule corresponds to the seventh month in use, diminished by one part to generate Great Regulator.\n\nCorresponding to the twelfth month in use, increased by one part to generate Ruibin. Corresponding to the fifth month in use, diminished by one part to generate the Clear Palace Huangzhong, which further diminishes by fifty-seven parts out of ninety to generate Zhonglü. Corresponding to the fourth month in use, it generates Zhishi, Zhishi generates Qumie, and Qumie generates Nanshi.\n\nFrom the node of Huangzhong to Yingzhong, there are twelve pipes. The Clear Palace, Zhishi, Qumie, and Nanshi serve as the conclusion of the pitch-pipes, thus appended below.\n\n*End of Volume Two of the Taigu Collection*\n*(Original text lacks title; this is supplemented based on Hao Datong’s preface.)*\n\n**Volume Three of the Taigu Collection**\n*Composed by Guangningzi Hao Datong*\n\n**Diagram of Qian and Kun Giving Birth to Six Children**\nThe Qian trigram represents old yang, and the Kun trigram represents old yin. Together, they give birth to six children.\n\nQian receives Kun’s first qi to give birth to Xun, the eldest daughter.\nQian receives Kun’s second qi to give birth to Li, the middle daughter.\nQian receives Kun’s third qi to give birth to Dui, the youngest daughter.\nKun receives Qian’s first qi to give birth to Zhen, the eldest son.\nKun receives Qian’s second qi to give birth to Kan, the middle son.\nKun receives Qian’s third qi to give birth to Gen, the youngest son.\n\nThus it is said: Qian gives birth to three daughters—Xun, Li, and Dui—while Kun gives birth to three sons—Zhen, Kan, and Gen.\n\n**Diagram of the Eight Trigrams’ Lines Forming the Year**\nThe Qian trigram has three long lines, each line corresponding to the number nine, thus three nines make twenty-seven. When the Qian trigram is doubled to six lines, each line corresponds to nine, so six nines make fifty-four. These are the numerical values of Qian’s lines.\n\nThe Kun trigram has three short lines, each line corresponding to the number six, thus three sixes make eighteen. When the Kun trigram is doubled to six lines, each line corresponds to six, so six sixes make thirty-six. These are the numerical values of Kun’s lines.\n\nHere, one yang is reckoned as nine, and one yin as six. Beyond these are Zhen, Kan, Gen, Xun, Li, and Dui. As yang and yin are unequal, they mutually derive their natural numerical values.\n\nThe total number of the eight trigrams is three hundred and sixty; halved, it becomes one hundred and eighty, symbolizing the number of a year.\n\n**Diagram of the Twenty-Four Solar Terms Added to the Qian and Kun Trigrams’ Yin-Yang Waxing and Waning**\nIn the month of the Winter Solstice, the first yang begins to grow, forming the Fu hexagram.\nOn the day of Great Cold, the second yang begins to grow, forming the Lin hexagram.\nOn the day of Rain Water, the third yang begins to grow, forming the Tai hexagram.\nOn the Spring Equinox, the fourth yang begins to grow, forming the Dazhuang hexagram.\nOn the day of Grain Rain, the fifth yang begins to grow, forming the Guai hexagram.\nOn the day of Lesser Fullness, pure yang forms the Qian hexagram.\nOn the Summer Solstice, the first yin begins to grow, forming the Gou hexagram.\nOn the day of Great Heat, the second yin begins to grow, forming the Dun hexagram.\nOn the day of the Limit of Heat, the third yin begins to grow, forming the Pi hexagram.\nOn the Autumn Equinox, the fourth yin begins to grow, forming the Guan hexagram.\nOn the day of Frost Descent, the fifth yin begins to grow, forming the Bo hexagram.\nOn the day of Lesser Snow, pure yin prevails, and the Kun hexagram governs.\n\nThis is what is meant by diminishing to augment and augmenting to diminish.\n\n**Diagram of the Six Children Added to the Twenty-Four Solar Terms’ Yin-Yang Waxing and Waning**\nThe Qian and Kun trigrams symbolize the great functions of Heaven and Earth. To further elucidate their principles, observe the movements of the sun and moon, the arising and vanishing of wind and thunder, and the communication and obstruction of mountains and marshes.\n\nBased on these six hexagrams—the three sons and three daughters—their Dao operates beginning from the Winter Solstice, with yang transforming into yin and yin transforming into yang. From the Summer Solstice onward, yin transforms into yang and yang into yin. Yin and yang intermingle, each undergoing transformation. By transforming and making them flow, the power of transforming things is made clear. This originates from the governance of non-action, arising naturally of itself.\n\n**Diagram of the Eight Trigrams’ Reversion and Repetition**\nIn the first generation, Qian transforms to become Gou; in the second, Dun; in the third, Pi; in the fourth, Guan; in the fifth, Bo. Here, from the bottom ascending upward, the fifth line reaches the extreme of transformation. Thus, after the Bo hexagram, the transformation proceeds from the top downward, called the \"wandering soul,\" yielding the Jin hexagram. After Jin, the lower three lines transform together to become Dayou, called the \"returning soul\" hexagram. The rest follow this pattern.\n\n**Diagram of the Sixty Jiazi Added to the Hexagram Images**\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth gives birth to the myriad things, none more noble than humanity. Thus, the Dao of the Three Powers is matched with the heavenly stems, earthly branches, and musical notes to form the sixty jiazi. Therefore, from the Qian and Kun hexagrams arise sixty-four numbers, totaling eleven thousand five hundred and twenty, symbolizing the number of the myriad things.\n\nWithin these images, Zhun serves as the initial model. The sixty jiazi pair with one another, and the sixty-four hexagrams encompass the natures of the myriad things, preserving the auspicious and inauspicious, regret and remorse, anxiety and apprehension, survival and demise, gain and loss—nothing is left unaddressed.\n\n**Diagram of the Twenty-Four Solar Terms Added to the Hexagram Images**\nBeginning from the Winter Solstice, Zhongfu embodies sincerity, and the yang qi begins to grow. By the Summer Solstice, Xian embodies mutual resonance, and the first yin begins to lengthen. Thus, the hexagrams number sixty, traversing the twenty-four solar terms, totaling three hundred and sixty to complete the work of a year.\n\nWithin one year, there are three hundred and fifty-four days, with intercalary months accumulating as surplus. Thus, from the Winter Solstice to the completion of a year, the measure is three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days. Each day governs one line, and six days and seven fen complete one hexagram. Including the surplus, the total is made whole.\n\nOnly Kan, Zhen, Li, and Dui return to the four cardinal directions and are not among the others.\n\n**Diagram of the Five Phases Fully Manifest**\nThe Five Phases are complete, encompassing the harmony of the Three Powers and the myriad images, the categories of the Eight Trigrams and the four cardinal directions, to illuminate the workings of transformation. Each phase occupies its own domain, where generation and restriction naturally give rise to times of compliance and opposition.\n\nFor instance, the eyes govern the liver, and when moved by anger, they may be drawn toward Metal. Metal governs the lungs, and when moved by sorrow, admonition may follow, thus through mutual resonance, they engage in the contest of restriction. If Metal is not employed, then Fire may be used: Fire governs the heart, and when met with laughter, the anger gradually dissipates, for this is the principle of mutual generation. All others follow this pattern, to clarify the Dao of the Five Phases in their compliance, opposition, generation, and restriction.\n\n**Diagram of the Generative Numbers of Heaven and Earth**\nHeaven is yang and Earth is yin; their union gives rise to existence, and each has its proper place. Heaven’s one combines with Earth’s four to generate, and Heaven’s three combines with Earth’s two to grow. From these numbers of generation and growth, the nature of Heaven and Earth may be discerned. Thus it is said: when Heaven and Earth unite, the myriad things communicate; when they do not unite, the myriad things do not communicate.\n\nHere, the yang numbers are one, three, and five, while the yin numbers are four and two. Together, yin and yang sum to fifteen. Each contributes half, completing the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Thus they are called the generative numbers, for they are named after generation and growth.\n\n**Diagram of the Completion Numbers of Heaven and Earth**\nEarth is yin. Riding the yang qi of Heaven, it fulfills the Dao of the beginning and end of the myriad things. At first, things lie hidden; in the end, they soar—all is the natural course of things. Earth possesses the yin numbers six, eight, and ten, while Heaven possesses the yang numbers seven and nine. Thus Earth’s six combines with Heaven’s nine to complete, and Earth’s eight combines with Heaven’s seven to fulfill. From these completion numbers, the nature of Heaven and Earth is revealed.\n\nAs for Heaven’s five and Earth’s ten, they interact of themselves, together completing the count. The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five, fulfilling the Dao of generation, growth, completion, and the beginning and end of the myriad things.\n\n**Diagram of the Five Movements**\nThe Five Movements traverse the ten celestial stems, forming the five qi. For example, in years governed by *jia* and *ji*, the Earth Movement prevails, manifesting as the qi of the Yellow Heaven. All others follow this pattern. Thus, the images of the Five Phases are called the Five Stars.\n\nWhen Jupiter retrogrades, it is the Wood Movement. When Mars retrogrades, it is the Fire Movement. When Venus retrogrades, it is the Metal Movement. When Mercury retrogrades, it is the Water Movement. When Saturn retrogrades, it is the Earth Movement. Following these Five Stars, they are distributed among the ten celestial stems to form the Five Movements. The stars possess cycles of concealment, delay, and retrogradation.\n\n**Diagram of the Six Qi**\nThe Six Qi clarify the three yang and three yin qi, which traverse the twelve earthly branches in mutual correspondence. For instance, in years of *yin* and *shen*, Lesser Yang governs; in years of *mao* and *you*, Yang Brightness governs; in years of *chen* and *xu*, Greater Yang governs; in years of *si* and *hai*, Reverting Yin governs; in years of *zi* and *wu*, Lesser Yin governs; in years of *chou* and *wei*, Greater Yin governs. Within each year, there are Six Qi.\n\nFor example, when Lesser Yang is the Controller of Heaven, Reverting Yin is the Director of the Earthly Springs. All others follow this pattern. Each qi endures for sixty days.\n\n**Diagram of the Four Images**\nThe Four Images further elucidate the Dao of Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon, and the numbers six, seven, eight, and nine. For instance, the old yang of *Qian* is called nine, the old yin of *Kun* is called six, the young yang of *Qian* is called seven, and the young yin of *Kun* is called eight.\n\nThus, *Qian* has six lines, each called nine, and multiplying by four yields thirty-six counting rods per line. *Kun* has six lines, each called six, and multiplying by four yields twenty-four counting rods per line. The yang lines of *Qian* total one hundred ninety-two, and the yin lines of *Kun* total one hundred ninety-two. Together, they sum to eleven thousand five hundred twenty counting rods, corresponding to the number of the myriad things.\n\n**Diagram of the Northern Dipper’s Monthly Positions**\nHeaven suspends the myriad images, with the Northern Asterism as its pivot. It governs the host of stars, ensuring none lose their proper time. The seven stars of the Northern Dipper each occupy their own direction, and their governance is described thus: the *Kui* rests upon Orion’s head, the *Shao* embraces the Dragon’s horns, and the Dipper reclines in the Great Turtle.\n\nKnow that the first star of the Northern Dipper is called the *Kui* Star, and the seventh is called the *Shao* Star. From the *Kui* to the *Shao*, there are seven stars, distributed among the seven palaces of the southern direction. Thus it is said: *xu* is the River *Kui*, and *chen* is the Heavenly Stem. Traversing the seven celestial stems mirrors the Northern Dipper.\n\n**Diagram of the Sun’s Cyclical Degrees and the Nine Paths in the Twenty-Four Solar Terms**\nOn the Winter Solstice, the sun travels through Oxherd. On the Summer Solstice, the sun travels through Well. Oxherd is the star of the southern extreme, and Well is the celestial stem of the northern extreme. From the northern extreme to the southern extreme, in one contraction and one extension, the sun traverses the twenty-four solar terms, passing through the twenty-eight lodges, covering three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees. Circulating through the nine paths, it reveals the workings of waxing and waning, and the principles of ascent and descent—all are encompassed in the sun’s path.\n\nThe sun completes one movement in a year, and the moon completes one cycle in a month. Thus, the sun’s motion exhibits waxing and waning, while the moon’s motion exhibits swiftness and slowness. The sun travels one degree per day, and the moon travels thirteen degrees per day, falling short by twelve degrees, mirroring the twelve months to complete a year.\n\nThe sun traverses the twelve movements of Heaven in twelve years, but the moon’s path differs. In a year without an intercalary month, it completes twelve cycles of Heaven; with an intercalary month, it completes thirteen cycles. Thus, the moon’s precise degree is twelve degrees and thirty-seven fen per day.\n\nThe motions of the sun and moon give rise to intercalary surplus.\n\nThe triad of powers mirrors the revolving three altars.\nThe triad of powers consists of Heaven as one, Earth as two, and Humanity as three. Yet this is not the case here—for what is called Heaven lies above, Earth lies below, and Humanity stands in the midst, thus embodying the triad of powers. It does not take the sequence of one, two, three, but rather the three grades of upper, middle, and lower.\n\nThus, the upper grade resembles Heaven’s myriad manifestations, exemplified by the ten Celestial Stems. The middle grade resembles Humanity’s myriad affairs, all of which dwell between Heaven above and Earth below, exemplified by the Eight Trigrams and the five phases. The lower grade resembles Earth’s myriad beings, exemplified by the twelve Earthly Branches. These three grades together attest to the triad of powers.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* states: “There is the Dao of Heaven, the Dao of Humanity, and the Dao of Earth. The Dao of Heaven is vast, the Dao of Earth is great, and the Dao of Humanity is complete.” Though the Dao of Heaven is vast, without Humanity’s modeling of it, the Dao of Heaven cannot be made manifest. Though the Dao of Earth is great, without Humanity’s regulation of it, the Dao of Earth cannot be accomplished. Only the Dao of Humanity can model itself upon Heaven and Earth, transform the ten thousand existents, and bring about the rise and fall of the ten thousand affairs—all of which arise from this alone.\n\n*Tai Gu Collection*, Scroll Three (concluded)\n*Tai Gu Collection*, Scroll Four\n\n**Gold Elixir Poems**\n*Composed by Guangningzi Hao Datong*\n\nThe spirit of emptiness-nothingness governs

leaving the teachings dim.\nA single grain of golden elixir lies within the crucible—\nYet without immortal bones, who can plumb its depths?\n\n**XIX**\nWithin the Nine Yang Palaces, a great awakened monk\nRaises his fist in steadfast meditation, reciting the *Yellow Court*.\nDivine radiance pierces the treasury of empty space;\nAuspicious qi congeals, pure, in the jeweled vase.\nRoaming the grotto-heavens, he displays his mastery;\nPervading the dharma-realm, he unleashes his numinous might.\nFrom this, he grasps the intent of the Western Advent—\nBefore the primal chaos, how could there have been form?\n\n**XX**\nTo learn immortality, one must refine the golden elixir,\nPlacing lead and mercury within the tripod’s embrace.\nApply the fire, circulate the heavens in due order;\nAdd to the work through months and years—do not tarry.\nPreserve spirit by first stilling the heart’s core;\nNurture qi—let not the tongue’s well run dry.\nThrough all twelve hours, never slacken—\nThen nature and life will be preserved whole.\n\n**XXI**\nFive qi dwell together in one palace, a single household,\nMutually sustaining, revolving in mist-wreathed livelihood.\nWhat carriage does not ascend the road to Chang’an?\nPrecious goods ever abide in the moon’s osmanthus glow.\nLead and mercury blend, yielding supreme auspice;\nQi and spirit, wisdom and numen, crystallize into cinnabar.\nThe wondrous work of perfected truth aligns with the profound—\nDrink deeply of flowing rosy clouds, bathe in radiant haze.\n\n**XXII**\nHow may one drink the knife’s measure?\nOnly the bloodless lamb reaches that shore.\nMountain and marsh qi commune—clouds rise from the valley;\nEarth and heaven harmonize—wood ascends the ladder.\nKan and Li unite, revealing inversion;\nDragon and tiger return, dispelling delusion.\nGrasp the principle within this ebb and flow—\nThen tread upon clouds and mist as if on level ground.\n\n**XXIII**\nEver hear the golden and stone tones within the gourd?\nWhen worldly passions fade, Dao-passion arises.\nOnce the yang-spirit is whole, sleep vanishes entirely;\nWhen the yin-soul dissolves, clarity dawns anew.\nA lotus born in fire is still within reach;\nA clod shaped in water surely takes form.\nWhen these two things merge in perfect harmony,\nSteer the cloud-chariot steadily toward Jade Capital.\n\n**XXIV**\nIdly drawing the golden crow to feast in the moon palace,\nBy chance they meet and fuse as one.\nDivine radiance illumines the numinous, empty body;\nThe wondrous Dao pierces the cage of creation.\nOnly then does the heart-mind recognize the guest in the snail-shell abode;\nOnly then does wisdom’s gaze behold the true host.\nFrom this awakening, the body is seen as hindrance—\nTo cling not to hollow names is the great penetration.\n\n**XXV**\nTo learn the Dao, first sever all outward splendor;\nTo cultivate truth and nurture simplicity befits the immortal clan.\nForget emotion, for it refines the golden liquor;\nStill thoughts, for they temper the purple cinnabar.\nOne nature, at dawn, gathers the five qi;\nMyriad spirits, at the crown, unfurl the triple blossom.\nFrom this, the path of longevity is attained—\nForever blend with the clear empyrean, one with rosy clouds.\n\n**XXVI**\nThose who leave the household do so seeking immortality,\nYet it lies only in the oral transmission of a true master.\nWithin the crucible, flying lead is ever preserved;\nWithin the tripod, mercury congeals, ever fresh.\nMolten gold, ground to powder, dissolves the dragon’s bones;\nDripping dew, crystallized to frost, lengthens the jade drool.\nOnce the heart-mirror is polished to shining clarity,\nThe original face naturally becomes whole.\n\n**XXVII**\nIn cultivation, do not force a carefree air,\nNor in an empty chamber cling to solitude.\nLet not the Purple Palace allow the tigers to battle;\nLet the Elixir Palace command the myriad spirits to pay homage.\nRoaming mountains, ever find the azure empyrean’s path;\nCrossing waters, always mount the hollowed-wood bridge.\nGather and consume the magic fungus without cease—\nWhy hang a gourd and begging bowl beneath the pines?\n\n**XXVIII**\nWithin the Three-One Gourd, scenes are extraordinary—\nA long-browed elder sits, gazing at pines and bamboo.\nSix *zhu* of crimson hue adorn his golden form;\nTwelve-storied towers drink the jade nectar.\nBy the white crane’s tree, he bows and rises again;\nBy the black turtle’s pool, he sways low and high.\nA numinous youth, stepping in Kan-trigrams, approaches,\nOffering the master the elixir of life.\n\n**XXIX**\nPrimordial qi blends into a body of purity;\nRosy clouds burst forth in five directions’ glow.\nThe golden elixir crystallizes in the pure yang adept;\nJade liquor waters the ever-blooming flower.\nWithin the formless gate, white snow drifts;\nWithin the treasury of empty space, the yellow sprout emerges.\nFew tread the path of longevity—\nOnly the immortals and Daoists.\n\n**XXX**\nHeavenly winds unfurl the Luoyang blossoms;\nThe six directions share one path—intent unerring.\n\nLeisurely plucking peonies to brew tender pistils,\nSilently gathering peonies to refine their essence.\nHarmonizing the two to purify spirit and qi,\nIrrigating the Three Fields with sesame and wheat.\nWine in hand, the feast concludes in carefree delight;\nSeated astride a white deer, he ascends into rosy clouds.\n*Tai Gu Ji*, Scroll Four—end.",

      "translated_text": "**The *Taigu Collection***\n\n**Scripture Title:** *Taigu Collection*\nAuthored by Jin Du Datong of the Capital, compiled by his disciple Fan Yuanxi. Four scrolls.\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Taiping* Section.\n\n**Four Prefaces to the *Taigu Collection***\n\nIn my youth, while dwelling in the lands of Yan and Zhao, I heard the name of the Perfected One of Taigu. Yet I never had the fortune to gaze upon his sacred traces, nor to hear the sound of his admonitions—this I have long regretted. Each time I pondered his noble legacy, it was as though I envisioned one dwelling amidst Penglai, Yingzhou, or Fangzhang.\n\nNow, by chance, I have come to meet the Perfected One’s dharma heir, the Great Master Fan, Illuminator of the Universal. The Master is a man of keen intelligence and luminous clarity, his mind as open as a pavilion with eight windows. While residing at Zhengyi in Dongping, his virtue and renown drew both Daoists and layfolk from a thousand *li* around, who flocked to him like clouds. Through their offerings, they erected ritual halls, grand halls, refectories, guest quarters, and granaries. In just three or four years, the structures numbered not merely dozens but hundreds of bays.\n\nOne day, he passed by my humble abode and said: *\"The reason I have labored so earnestly to accomplish these meritorious works is no other than to propagate the teachings and model of my late master. My master, the Perfected One of Taigu, once compiled the *Kunlun Anthology*, but the editions circulated at the time were riddled with omissions and errors. I believe that the standards of our lineage and the wellsprings of Daoist learning depend on the presence of its people, and when they are gone, only the written word remains. Thus, one must never be parted from it, not even for a moment. Though one may build a pagoda of nine tiers with tiles and bricks, it cannot compare to the transmission of the mind-seal through texts, free of even a single misplaced word. Many see only my diligence in construction and repair, but few know that I have also devoted no small effort to mending the gaps, restoring the missing, and correcting the errors in the *Kunlun Anthology*. Now that the work is complete, why do you not write a preface for it?\"*\n\nI replied: *\"In my youth, I was deeply drawn to the Perfected One’s noble legacy, and it has long been my regret that I never beheld his sacred traces. To have my name attached to this collection is a great fortune indeed. Yet what I have heard of him until now has been mere hearsay. As his dharma heir, you have received his direct transmission over many years—none know the Perfected One’s virtues and deeds better than you. I ask that you recount even a fraction of his moral character and noble legacy, to substantiate this preface and lend credence to future generations.\"*\n\nThe Great Master then presented me with a handwritten account of his master’s life, which follows below.\n\nThe Master’s secular surname was Hao, and his family had long resided in Ninghai, where they were among the foremost households of the prefecture. His brothers all pursued Confucian scholarship. His elder brother, styled Junyan, passed the imperial examinations, rising to the rank of *Chaolie Dafu* and serving as magistrate of Changyi County. The Master alone, from childhood, displayed exceptional intelligence and a disposition both serene and expansive, bearing the unmistakable air of one destined to transcend the mundane world.\n\nThe Patriarch Chongyang, the Perfected One of the Great Ultimate, traveled from Qin to Qi in the *Dinghai* year of the Dading era. Upon reaching Ninghai, he met the Master and at once declared him a divine immortal. Later, on Kunlun Mountain, he transmitted the robe before the assembly. After receiving the transmission, the Master did not regard himself as having attained the Dao. Instead, he concealed his light, often begging for alms in the regions of Zhen and Xingming. Passing beneath the Southern Stone Bridge of Zhaozhou, he maintained silence, sitting in meditation for six years. Neither cold nor heat, wind nor rain, could dislodge him from that place. Children who came to play saw him as a mere earthen or wooden figure, even piling bricks and stones around him, yet he remained undisturbed.\n\nThe youngest daughter of the Lord of Changyi was married to Guo Changqian, the Vice Prefect of Zhen. When the Guo couple traveled to Zhen together, their carriage procession was grand. Passing the Stone Bridge, they learned of the Master’s presence beneath it. They halted their carriage to pay their respects, offering him clothing and provisions in abundance. The Master, however, seemed not to recognize them and accepted nothing. The lady wept with emotion, and Guo sighed in wonder before departing after some time.\n\nThe Master’s resolve to sever worldly ties was so firm that he could devote himself wholeheartedly to the Dao. As months and years passed, his spirit moved and resonated with the unseen. One day, south of Luanzhou, a divine being bestowed upon him the *Great Book of Changes*. Suddenly, he attained great awakening, gaining foresight into many matters. His name spread throughout the world.\n\nDuring the Da’an era, the imperial court bestowed upon him a decree with the title: *Taigu Perfected One of Quanning and the Entire Dao*—this was his honorific. After receiving the *Book of Changes* in Luanzhou, his predictions of fortune and misfortune were precise to the finest detail. Moreover, he knew his own lifespan, which was to be seventy-three years. When the time came, he took leave of his disciples, and passed away without illness.\n\nHis writings fill six volumes. The *Veritable Records* record these details as above.",

At seventy-five years of age, looking back upon the earlier transmissions in Yan and Zhao, it is as though separated by two lifetimes. Had the Great Master not compiled the master’s posthumous writings and traced his deeds, the Perfected One’s lingering influence and remaining power would have no means to be revealed. Moreover, how could later students and younger generations easily come to know these things? The Great Master, relying upon the Perfected One’s Daoist legacy, has erected the meritorious works of Orthodox Unity, illuminating the eastern lands. Now, by recounting these deeds, you stir the hearts of learners, making them easier to comprehend.\"\n\nThe ancients said: \"Though no elders remain, their models still endure.\" Alas, are not the meritorious works of Orthodox Unity likewise a model of the Perfected One’s Daoist legacy?\n\nThe Great Master said, \"Indeed, indeed.\"\n\nThe Great Master’s personal name was Yuanxi, a descendant of the former Song dynasty’s eminent minister, Duke Wenzheng.

Scholars from all directions flocked to him, and the master aided and succored them without wearying.

      "translated_text": "At parting, he produced a volume and said, “This is the *Songs and Poems of the Great Ancient* by my master, Hao Kunyu. I now intend to carve new woodblocks to transmit it—you must write a preface for me.” I accepted and read it, only to find that Master Feng, the Academician, had already inscribed its opening. After poring over it again and again, I sighed: “Was this not one of the ancient men of the Dao? How refined his words, how wondrous his principles!”\n\nI have often thought: when scholar-officials are born and pursue learning, they say, ‘I wish to bring good to all under Heaven, to aid the ruler and enrich the people.’ Yet if their aspirations do not align with the times, few fulfill their wishes. Many fall into hidden sorrow, resentment, and self-inflicted harm. They cannot achieve universal good, nor do they preserve personal integrity—deeply lamentable indeed. Those outside the worldly realm, however, harbor no ambition to save the age. They resolutely cultivate and refine themselves, making longevity their sole concern. With single-minded devotion and meticulous care, their progress renews daily. Though they may not ascend in broad daylight, they preserve bodily wholeness and spiritual vitality, living out their years in robust health. How far removed they are from those who chase external things, ensnared by hollow fame, squandering wisdom and wearing down their essence—all without benefit to our teaching!\n\nTake Master Hao, for instance: from youth, he set his resolve and stood unwavering. During his years of seclusion, his conduct was as pure as jade and as steadfast as pine. One day, he discoursed on the profound and expounded the *Yi*, his spirit enlightened and heart attuned. He composed writings to transmit after his passing. Master Fan, in turn, has propagated his teacher’s Dao, amplifying its influence in this age. He has also edited and published his master’s posthumous works to awaken later learners—both are towering figures beyond the worldly realm. Thus, stirred by these reflections, I write to address the twin failures of our generation.\n\nIn the autumn of the eighth month, this preface was written by Liu Qi of Hunshui.\n\n---\n\nThe late master, the Perfected Great Ancient of Quanning, Master Hao, met his teacher in Ninghai and received the transmission on Kunlun. Divine beings bestowed upon him the *Yi*, and the Great Peace granted him his title. As Master Feng, the Academician, has already recounted in his preface, I need not repeat it here. His extant works include *A Discussion on the Three Teachings Entering the Yi* (one fascicle), *Direct Words for Teaching* (one fascicle), *Commentaries on the Heart Sutra* and *Sutra of Salvation from Suffering* (one fascicle each), and *The Great Ancient Collection* (fifteen fascicles), within which is *A Concise Exegesis of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* (one fascicle).\n\nWhen the master first arrived from the west, the people of Zhen Ding had already begun carving woodblocks in Dai. After returning to his later years, he composed many more works, and even revised some of his earlier collections. Common transcriptions, however, are rife with errors. Though I wished to correct and renew them, I lacked the leisure.\n\nI reflect that my late master’s Dao uniquely grasped the untransmitted mysteries of antiquity. He refined it with the imagery of the *Yi* and expanded it with the joy of Chan, achieving both subtlety and vastness. Standing apart from the world, his teachings and discourses are what people long to see. Yet today, errors abound like the *lu* and *yu* fish, truth and falsehood intermingle, and later learners are left bewildered. It falls to his disciples to bear this responsibility.\n\nI, Yuanxi, though dull-witted, have relied on the shade of the Dao. Now, with ample leisure while sweeping and tending the Orthodox Unity abode on Dongyuan, I have meticulously collated the master’s later revisions and previously unseen works, establishing a definitive edition to carve and transmit. I dare to place these unpolished words at the head of the volume.\n\nThe perfected ones perceive all things with equanimity, so their words aim solely to clarify principle. They do not necessarily string together four- and six-character lines, nor pluck green to match white, as those who craft literature do, boasting of tonal rhythms and stylistic elegance. In Chan learning, it is said: “Coarse words and fine speech alike embody the supreme meaning.” In the Confucian tradition, it is said: “Words suffice when they convey meaning,” and “To grasp the intent is to attain it.” If scholars do not aspire to the Dao but seek only ornate expression, how can this be the Dao of daily diminution—diminishing further and further?\n\nThe masters of old, upon hearing a single word or phrase from the teacher, would deem him a divine immortal. They treated him as kin beyond the worldly realm, and his lifelong instruction was strict and unyielding—enough to rival Linji of the Daoist gate. Were he still alive today, he would surely raise the true command, sit in judgment over the great thousandfold world, and even the lion and elephant kings would retreat in deference. Foxes and wild beasts, I know, could not gather in his presence. His passing beyond the light—how can one not sigh in sorrow?\n\nYet his books remain. Take them and read: there will surely be those whose eyes see but cannot perceive, whose mouths gape but cannot speak.\n\nOn the Winter Solstice of the *bingshen* year, this preface was respectfully written by Fan Yuanxi, heir to the teaching in the wild garb of Kunlun.\n\n---\n\nThe Great Dao is indistinct, entering existence from non-being;\nThe creative transformations of Heaven and Earth return from being to non-being.\nThus, being enters non-being, and non-being emerges from being.\nThe primordial qi, existing before Heaven and Earth, once manifested in the Three Powers, gradually gave rise to the myriad things.\nIn the movements of the myriad things, there is generation and restraint, benefit and harm, compliance and opposition, good and evil, right and wrong.\nLike gathers with like, things divide by kind.\nWhen hierarchy is ordered, the Way of peace flourishes; when ranks lose their proper place, the time of closure arrives.\nAt the outset of affairs, one may lie hidden; at the appointed hour, one may leap forth.\nTreading on frost foretells the coming of solid ice; when dragons battle, their blood is black and yellow.\nIn *Tun*, it is favorable to dwell in integrity; in *Song*, sincerity must be tempered with caution.\nTo correct the world, one may dwell among the ignorant; to issue commands, one may employ poisonous *gu* for clarity.\nWith firm advance, wait for *Xu*; with gentle conduct, there is *Bo*.\nGoing forth, value *Tongren*; calamity arises from *Daguo*.\n*Gen* halts it, *Dui* delights it; *Bi* adorns and *Li* clings.\n*Jian* is stagnation, *Kan* is peril.\n*Kui* is separation, *Heng* is constancy.\nRenewal can secure the tripod; losing rhythm overturns the army.\nRadiance allows the world to be seen; obscurity permits retreat to the mountains and forests.",

      "translated_text": "Not by divine transformation or numinous penetration—who else could partake in this?\n\nI once delved deeply into the *Zhouyi*, abridging its *Zhengyi* to compose the *Cantong*. Therein, I delineated the Two Modes and Four Images, the Three Powers and Eight Trigrams, the Six Pitch Pipes and Nine Palaces, the Seven Governors and Five Phases. The stars spread forth in array; the sun and moon trace their celestial paths. Being and non-being blend into oneness, forming diagrams and images.\n\nIn response to inquiries, I set forth my thoughts in poems, lyrics, songs, and rhapsodies—fifteen scrolls in all, divided into three volumes. Longing for the winds of the Great Antiquity, I titled it *The Anthology of Great Antiquity*. Now, \"Great\" refers to the Supreme Simplicity, Supreme Beginning, Supreme Origin, and Supreme Simplicity; \"Antiquity\" refers to the Remote Past, High Antiquity, Deep Antiquity, and Eternal Past. My aim is that future seekers of the Dao may know this endeavor is no empty pursuit.\n\nMoreover, no phenomenon is greater than Heaven and Earth; no transformation is greater than yin and yang. The essence of Heaven and Earth, the root of yin and yang—these are the Two Qi. The Wood Dragon and Metal Tiger, the Crimson Phoenix and Dark Tortoise—these are the Four Images. Six, seven, eight, nine—these are the numbers. Knife-point and lead-mercury—these are the instruments of generation and completion. Spirit’s encounter and qi’s union—these are the terms for nature and destiny.\n\nThe Purple Palace and Cinnabar Palace, the Numinous Terrace and Jade Tower, the Crimson Towers and Vermilion Gates, the Jade Cavern and Pearl Curtain, the Mysterious Barrier and Yang Path, the Earth Gate and Heavenly Portal, Jade Fluid and Golden Essence, Yellow Sprout and White Snow, True Water and True Fire, the Alchemical Maiden and Infant, the Stone Man and Wooden Horse, the Nine Worms and Three Corpses, the Golden Elder and Yellow Dame, the Mushroom of Immortality and Cinnabar—all these are the workings of the Five Phases’ transformations.\n\nIn general, when movement and stillness are both forgotten, when nature is perfected and destiny secured, one accords with the spontaneous. The Dao of spontaneity is most easy to know, most easy to practice—yet none in the world know it, none practice it, for desire and delusive thoughts are what harm it.\n\nIf one casts off falsity and follows the real, transcends the dust and leaves the dharmas, mingles with the world yet remains extraordinary, stands alone yet does not change, embraces the One and never departs, circulates without weariness—then one may nearly attain the immortal’s way. Yanzi possessed the virtue of \"sitting in forgetfulness\"; Meng Ke achieved the merit of \"nurturing simplicity\"—both were devoted to a single matter.\n\nNow, I set forth the great outlines, revealing the various alternate names. Though paths differ, they converge in the same end; though names are many, the principle is one. This is shown to benefit later learners, to strengthen the resolve of the Dao-heart and ensure purity without selfishness. If one holds fast to this resolve until the end, one’s name will be inscribed in the immortal registers, forever becoming a perfected one—with numinous transformations boundless and the power to ascend on feathered wings.\n\nThus, none may enter who are not of my gate; none may affirm who are not of my Dao. Yet what is so is so, and what is not so is also affirmed as so.\n\nIn the winter solstice of the sixth day after the full moon of the eleventh month, the eighteenth year of the Dading reign [1178], self-preface.\n\n*Anthology of Great Antiquity*, Scroll One\nComposed by Guangningzi Hao Datong",

      "translated_text": "**A Concise Exegesis of the *Zhouyi Cantong Qi*, with Preface**\n\nTeaching is that by which the Dao is born. The Dao has no name in itself, yet we force a name upon it and call it \"Dao.\" Teaching has no form in itself, yet we borrow words to manifest its instruction. The essence of teaching encompasses both being and non-being. Thus, to speak of it as non-being is to preserve the substance of the Dao; to speak of it as being is to preserve its function. The substance is taken as non-being, while its function is taken as efficacy.\n\nIf one says that the formed arises from the formless, then how do Heaven and Earth come to be? If teaching transforms the unknowing, then how does true knowledge emerge? Now, when the Supreme Ultimate brushes forth division, the Three Powers take their places; the Five Phases are arrayed at the Mysterious Ultimate, the Eight Trigrams are ordered in the vast expanse. The Seven Governors are set in motion, the celestial cycles establish their norms. Myriad images hang in the firmament above, while the numinous and the coarse are nurtured upon the earth below.\n\nThus, the sage looks up and observes, looks down and examines, shaping and aiding all things. He trusts the four seasons to generate the ten thousand beings, penetrating transformation to traverse the realm of spirits. The passage of essence has no gate; the abode of spirit has no cavity. Still and unmoving, yet responsive and instantly penetrating.\n\nAs for those who cultivate reality and attain the Dao, they employ its virtue to transform the ten directions, their wisdom transcending the Three Realms. Ascending and descending, dragons chant and tigers roar; waxing and waning, serpents hide and tortoises conceal. Going and coming, spirits wail and ghosts weep; extending and contracting, self and other are both forgotten. At such a time, lightning flashes and the eight bounds blaze with radiance; thunder crashes and the three mountains tremble in awe. Cranes soar and phoenixes dance, deer return and rams circle. Vital qi brims over, auspicious clouds gather thickly. The ten thousand spirits array themselves, while the hordes of demons flee in concealment. The Mysterious Pearl scatters upon the terrace of spirit; lingzhi mushrooms sprout together in the Purple Palace. The flower of awakening just unfolds, the Dharma-ocean is fathomless in depth. One enters directly into the Mysterious Capital, forever transcending the dusty realm.\n\nThis is what is meant by \"a hair swallowing the great sea, a mustard seed containing Mount Sumeru,\" by \"the wooden horse neighing, the stone man singing in harmony.\" All these are expressions of post-enlightenment realization, spoken of only when unavoidable.\n\nThis Dao, when employed in accord with the natural order, brings the Two Modes into sequence and harmonizes the hundred things. When practiced in reversal, the six positions topple and the Five Phases fall into chaos. Who but one of utmost mystery and subtlety could partake of this?\n\nThus, I have briefly set forth the profound text, abridging it into essentials.\n\nPreface written on the nineteenth day of the fourth month in the summer of the *wuxu* year, the eighteenth of the Dading reign [1178].\n\nThe Dao of the *Changes* takes Qian as its gate, Kun as its door, the Northern Asterism as its pivot, the sun and moon as its revolutions, the four seasons as its officers, the Five Phases as its permutations, quiescence and emptiness as its substance, response and movement as its function, firmness and yielding as its foundation, purity and stillness as its norm, clouds and rain as its benefit, the ten thousand images as its model, the manifold kinds as one, fortune and misfortune as the constant, life and death as the origin, being and non-being as its teaching.\n\nThus, we know that teaching and transformation must reside in humanity, that the goodness of substance and function must reside in the heart, and that change and penetration must reside in spirit. With one spirit, the myriad spirits are encompassed; with one Dharma, the boundless Dharma is embraced; with one heart, the innumerable hearts are governed. From antiquity to the present, it endures unbroken, ever-present.\n\nThis is the meaning of the *Concise Exegesis of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi*.\n\nThe celestial body is vast in its Dao, pure, empty, broad, and distant, unalloyed yang without admixture. Qian universally applies its virtue, revolving without cease, responding and transforming without end. It begins well and harmoniously penetrates, gathering and uniting the host of spirits, communicating the principles of things and their natures. Like Xihe, it is steadfast and firm, harmonizing and aiding, benefiting with firmness and correctness.\n\nHow wondrous and supremely subtle! Following this Dao in practice, one adapts to the times and transforms accordingly.\n\nThe Mysterious Origin, the Sacred Ancestor, sets the compass and square for later generations, illuminating the world. It provides for the ten thousand things, and the appropriateness of all images is drawn from Qian’s function. It governs clouds and rain: cloud qi flows and spreads, rain and moisture are distributed, reaching all beings without obstruction or blockage.\n\nIt illuminates the beginning and the end, clarifying the Dao of the ten thousand things from start to finish. At the beginning, it lies hidden; at the end, it soars and leaps. When concealment is fitting, it conceals; when flight is fitting, it flies. Thus, it is clear and penetrating in the Dao of beginning and end.\n\nIt rides the six positions in due season. Yang has six positions, yin has six positions; firmness and function follow the time, beginning and end as one. If one does not employ them according to the time—flying when concealment is called for, concealing when flight is called for, killing when life is called for, giving life when killing is called for—the six positions, not ridden in due season, will instead bring harm.\n\nThe tiger lies in submission, the dragon takes flight—yin submits, yang flies; yang gives life, yin kills.\n\nIt controls the cosmos and commands the universe, ascending and descending without cease, revolving without end.\n\nIt transforms power into efficacy. The Dao of application: shedding the old and following the new, proceeding gradually, is called \"change\"; sudden alteration from being to non-being is called \"transformation.\" In the Dao of Qian, whether things gradually change or suddenly transform, all rely on it for their beginning, for nurturing the ten thousand things, for unifying the functions of concealment and manifestation.\n\nIt rectifies nature and assists destiny. The function of Qian is seen in its transformations. The efficacy of transformation enables things to each rectify their nature and destiny. \"Nature\" is the innate quality bestowed by Heaven, such as the distinctions between firmness and yielding, slowness and swiftness. \"Destiny\" is what humans receive, such as the conditions of nobility or baseness, long life or early death.\n\nThus, we know that the formless arises from the formed, and the formed is burdened by its form. Only the Dao of Heaven, though formed, can be firm without being burdened, for it rides transformation to govern the great vessel, still and concentrated when at rest, upright and direct when in motion, never losing the Great Harmony.\n\nIn its substance, Qian is still and abiding, concentrated and unwavering. In its movement, it is upright and free from deviation. Not losing the great benefit—is this not the essence of rectifying nature and destiny?\n\nQian can rectify and stabilize the nature and destiny of things, for the nature and destiny of things each have their own essence. What is received at birth is called \"nature\"; what arises from momentary thoughts and considerations is called \"emotion.\" Thus, in truth, preservation resides in nature.",

      "translated_text": "From the deviant perspective, preservation resides in emotion. When emotion departs and nature remains, destiny naturally returns to assist it. Preserving and uniting the Great Harmony—such is the function of Qian. Pure yang, firm and vehement: without harmony and compliance, things cannot receive benefit, and rectitude is lost. If one can safeguard peace and convergence, the Dao of Great Harmony endures, enabling all things to rectify their natures and destinies and attain longevity.\n\nProfit and integrity thus arise. Integrity solidifies the function of the stem, benefiting all things. Within, it resides in firm strength, single-minded and unshifting; without, it employs soft weakness, upright and free from deviation. Like the craftsman’s compass and square, the noble person employs this Dao to shape the myriad things and teach transformation without end.\n\nThe noble person is self-strengthening, operating without cease, cycling from end to beginning, ever robust and flourishing—the Dao of the noble person is complete. The *jun* is the master; the *zi* is love. The master occupies the superior position, loving others and aiding all things. Those who study the Dao penetrate the function of Qian and enact great benefit, ceaseless day and night, without decline or retreat. The noble person, self-strengthening and diligent, never ceasing, extends this only to the multitude. Their teachings and commands are worthy of adoption.\n\nThis clarifies how the noble person embodies the Dao in action: inwardly firm, outwardly compliant, still and concentrated, moving upright and direct. Like clouds drifting and rain falling, the four seasons proceed in order, and the myriad things come to life—all categories of beings receive universal care.\n\nThe earth embodies the greatness of the Dao: deep, solid, and purely substantial, bearing all without exception. Kun’s function is of profound virtue: soft, harmonious, and thickly supportive, embracing all impurities, complying with the multitude of beings, and penetrating the principles of things. Like the virtue of Qian, its virtue is vast and great, nourishing and benefiting all categories of beings, fostering the myriad existences, each flowing unimpeded.\n\nAffairs are fully accommodated, flexibly connected. Adapting to the times and awaiting things, yielding oneself to advance others—such is the noble person: compliant yet rectifying the stem, achieving fine and beautiful merit. The feminine extreme transforms into the masculine: not initiating affairs but harmonizing after another’s lead. Humility and reverence illuminate; if one advances others, others will advance oneself—first feminine, then transformed into masculine.\n\nThe southwest is inauspicious: yin softness cannot stand, and things suffer harm. The northeast establishes merit: will and intent harmonize, nature and conduct are soft and weak, yet when facing affairs, decisions are made without partiality—this is the meaning of rectitude.\n\nRiding this to reach that, attaining rectitude and complying with the will, one preserves constancy. Following the ancestral wind of the Yellow Emperor: only governance is obeyed, adapting to change with the times. Nurturing the myriad existences, its wondrous function is vast and boundless, nothing distant or estranged. It accords with Heaven’s wisdom: conduct does not violate propriety, compliant and free from deviation.\n\nThick and able to bear all things, utmost compliance embraces and upholds without disordering the multitude. The ultimate principle is inexhaustible: abiding in the center and attaining rectitude, following nature. Embracing vastness and radiating brilliance, harmonizing light with the multitude, neither haughty nor solitary.\n\nCategories of beings flourish in tranquility: harmonious qi fills and overflows, enabling things to live. Words of goodness lead to ascent; the Dao returns to the multitude of beings. Unrelenting from beginning to end—this is the noble person’s rectitude.\n\nTrue appearance is not appearance: relying on reverence and treading rectitude, enacting destiny with merit, turning inward to observe—appearance is real yet not existent, the reality of non-appearance, for reality is not appearance.\n\nTrue emptiness is not empty: not dwelling in action, not contriving—emptiness is truly not preserved, yet the true is not empty, for the true is not empty.\n\nPreserving all mysteries: plain and unadorned, cultivating benevolence and upholding rectitude. The vessel aligns with the profound: pure, refined, and immaculate, the will firmly fixed on unity. Vast and expansive in bestowal, centered and unbiased, at peace with gain and loss, adapting to the times to fulfill the fruition of the Dao.\n\n*Taigu Collection, Scroll One Concluded*\n*Taigu Collection, Scroll Two*",

      "translated_text": "**Hao Datong of Guangning, *Illustrated Exegesis of the Zhouyi Cantong Qi* #1**\n\n**Qian Multitude Diagram**\nQian serves as the function of Heaven, while Heaven is the substance of Qian. Heaven is thus limpid, vacuous, lofty, and distant—pure yang unadulterated, its singular qi operating in obscurity, transforming and engendering the myriad things. One may emulate Heaven’s function but not its substance. Hence it is called the Qian image, also termed \"old yang.\" Its number is nine. As Qian represents Heaven, it has three lines; three multiplied yields nine. This hexagram, when doubled, has six lines, each designated \"nine.\"\n\nThe Way of Heaven resembles an inverted canopy, its form like a hen’s egg. It takes Kun as its consort, thereby begetting six offspring.\n\n**Kun Image Diagram**\nKun serves as the function of Earth, while the nurturing soil is Kun’s substance. Earth is thus purely thick and broadly sustaining—pure yin unadulterated. The dual qi ascend and descend, and things undergo transformation. One may emulate Earth’s function but not its substance. Hence it is called the Kun image, termed \"old yin.\" Its number is six. As Kun represents Earth, it has six lines; the image is thus designated \"six.\" This hexagram, when doubled, has six lines, each designated \"six.\" Heaven has three lines, which, combined with Kun’s six lines, yield the number nine. Only Earth, belonging to old yin...\n\n**Sun Image Diagram**\nThe Sun is the essence of great yang, corresponding to the Li hexagram. Its number is seven, termed \"young yang.\" The Li hexagram has long lines above and below, with a short line in the center, forming four lines. Combined with Qian’s three lines, it yields the number seven. It is called \"young yang\" because the Way of Qian Heaven covers and shades the myriad things—limpid, vacuous, vast, and distant, pure yang unadulterated, its singular qi operating in obscurity, termed \"old yang.\" Though the Sun’s Way lacks such magnitude, its brilliance illumines the eight directions, universally reaching all under Heaven. When it emerges, it is day; when it sets, it is night—hence it is called \"young yang.\"\n\n**Moon Image Diagram**\nThe Moon is the essence of great yin, corresponding to the Kan hexagram. Its number is eight, termed \"young yin.\" The Kan hexagram has short lines above and below, with a long line in the center, forming five lines. Combined with Qian’s three lines, it yields the number eight. It is called \"young yin\" because the Way of Kun Earth is vastly sustaining, termed \"old yin.\" The Moon’s brilliance waxes and wanes; when it emerges, it is night, its illumination boundless, like Earth’s vastness—hence it is called \"young yin.\" The Sun and Moon are the children of Heaven and Earth, inheriting Qian but not Kun, for children follow the father.\n\n**Heaven and Earth in Harmonious Union Diagram**\nWhen Heaven and Earth unite, there is peace; when they do not, there is obstruction. This means Heaven’s yang qi descends into Earth, while Earth’s yin qi ascends to Heaven—this is Heaven and Earth uniting to achieve peace. If Heaven’s qi rises and Earth’s qi descends, the two qi do not interact, and the myriad things become obstructed, unable to flow freely. Thus, Heaven and Earth should unite, not remain separate; the myriad things should prosper, not stagnate. Without prosperity, there is obstruction. Hence, the Way of Heaven experiences peace for eleven years and obstruction for twelve. A full cycle of years completes its phases of obstruction and peace.\n\n**Conjunction of Sun and Moon Diagram**\nWhen the Sun and Moon conjoin, they unite; when they do not, there is the new moon and full moon. The Sun completes one circuit of Heaven in a year, while the Moon completes one circuit in a month. In a year without intercalary months, there are twelve months. Each month has its conjunction, hence it is said: when the Sun and Moon are separated by a wall, it is called *shuo* (new moon). *Shuo* means dawn. Dawn occurs on the first day of each month, when the Sun and Moon conjoin beneath the Sun—this is called *shuo*. When the Sun and Moon are in opposition, it is called *wang* (full moon); when they are a quarter apart, it is called *xian* (first or last quarter). These are times when they do not conjoin. When light is exhausted and the body is concealed, it is called *hui* (dark moon), approaching conjunction.\n\n**Heaven’s Odd Numbers and Symbolic Images Diagram**\nHeaven is pure yang and possesses yang numbers. Yang numbers include one, three, five, seven, and nine. Summed together, they total twenty-five, forming Qian’s yang numbers. These are called \"odd\" because odd numbers form four square directions with a center—this is the meaning. Heaven’s numbers are five; when multiplied by themselves, they yield the odd transformation numbers. Thus, it is said: north one, east three, south seven, west nine, center five—all yang numbers. The yang numbers are one, three, five, seven, and nine.\n\n**Earth’s Even Numbers and Symbolic Images Diagram**\nEarth is pure yin and possesses yin numbers. Yin numbers include two, four, six, eight, and ten. Summed together, they total thirty, forming Kun’s yin numbers. These are called \"even\" because even numbers form four square directions with a center—this is the meaning. Thus, it is said: east eight, west four, north six, south two, center ten—all yin numbers. The yin numbers are two, four, six, eight, and ten. Earth is fundamentally square, hence termed \"even\"; Heaven is fundamentally round, hence termed \"odd.\"\n\n**Twenty-Eight Constellations Aligned with the Four Symbols Diagram**\nThe celestial image comprises twenty-eight constellations, totaling 365¼ degrees, distributed across the twelve terrestrial divisions as the constant path of the stars. The Sun, Moon, Five Phases, and Seven Governors serve as the weft, circulating through the degrees, giving rise to transformation. Divided into the four corners and four cardinal directions, the east, south, west, and north each attain their numbers, harmonizing with the functions of Heaven, Earth, Sun, and Moon. Therein lie the Azure Dragon, the White Tiger, the Vermilion Bird, and the Dark Warrior.\n\n**Twenty-Four Solar Terms Aligned with the Seventy-Two Pentads Diagram**",

      "translated_text": "Heaven and Earth establish their positions; the Sun and Moon move in their courses. The eight nodes and four seasons revolve naturally. Thus, when heat departs, cold arrives; when spring recedes, autumn comes, completing the work of a year. Within this yearly cycle lie seventy-two pentads. A pentad signifies the timely manifestations, revealing that things possess their own nature, responding to the solar terms—five days and seven fen constitute one pentad. From the Beginning of Spring to the Greater Cold, comprising one year, there are twelve celestial divisions, to which the phenological signs naturally correspond in due season.\n\n**River Chart**\nThe numbers of Heaven and Earth’s odd and even combine to form the River Chart, totaling fifty-five. This Chart and Book, however, comprise forty-five numbers, permeating the Nine Palaces in the likeness of a tortoise’s form: nine at the head, one at the tail, three on the left, seven on the right, two and four as the shoulders, six and eight as the feet—this is the natural image. Upon its back lie the Five Phases, by which one may discern the past and future, divining omens of fortune and misfortune. Thus, it communicates the virtue of the divine spirits and categorizes the conditions of the myriad things. Heaven produces numinous objects, and the sages take them as models, forming the Chart and Book. One, three, five, seven, and nine are odd, belonging to yang and residing in the center and the four cardinal directions. Two, four, six, and eight are even, belonging to yin and residing in the four corners. Only the earth number ten lies within the dragon’s belly, not visibly manifest, and so it is preserved without depiction.\n\n**Diagram of Transformation**\nThe Dao of Change is unfathomable without divine power and unknowable without sagely wisdom. Thus, there is the Great Simplicity, the qi not yet manifest. There is the Great Beginning, the inception of qi. There is the Great Commencement, the inception of form. There is the Great Pristine, the inception of substance. When qi, form, and substance are complete yet not yet separated, this is called primordial chaos. Once chaos divides, the Two Modes fall into order, and the myriad things transform and take shape. Before chaos, there is nothingness; after chaos, there is being. From the alternation of being and non-being arises chaos—chaotic and undifferentiated—when Heaven and Earth, Sun and Moon, twice conjoin, the time of harmonious union. The Five Phases Diagram\n\n**Diagram of the Five Phases**\nThe Five Phases are Water, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Wood. All numbers of Heaven and Earth each have their correspondences, generated from the Five Phases. Thus, Heaven One and Earth Six combine to generate Water. Earth Two and Heaven Seven combine to generate Fire. Heaven Three and Earth Eight combine to generate Wood. Earth Four and Heaven Nine combine to generate Metal. Heaven Five and Earth Ten combine to generate Earth. The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five, giving rise to the Five Phases, whose numbers are thus revealed. Seven counts yield Water; nine counts yield Fire; eleven counts yield Wood; thirteen counts yield Metal; fifteen counts yield Earth. These are the numbers of Heaven and Earth that generate the Five Phases.\n\n**Diagram of the Celestial Stems**\nThe Ten Celestial Stems are: Jia and Yi, symbolizing Wood; Bing and Ding, symbolizing Fire; Geng and Xin, symbolizing Metal; Ren and Gui, symbolizing Water; Wu and Ji, symbolizing Earth. Wood as a body symbolizes spring, engendering the myriad beings, governing the hun-soul, its numinous presence manifest in sprouts. Fire as a body symbolizes summer, nurturing the myriad things, governing the nature, its spirit manifest in blossoms. Metal as a body symbolizes autumn, maturing the species, governing the po-soul, its qi manifest in fruit. Water as a body symbolizes winter, consummating the myriad beings, governing the life essence, its essence manifest in roots. Earth flourishes as the symbol, added to the proper seasons of the four quarters, present in each time.\n\n**Diagram of the Three Powers Entering the Crucible for Transformation**\nThe Dao of the Three Powers comprises Heaven, Earth, and Humanity. The Celestial Origin possesses the category of the Ten Stems; the Terrestrial Origin possesses the category of the Twelve Branches; the Human Origin possesses the category of the Five Phases and Eight Trigrams. These Three Powers, matched with the Branches and Stems, the Five Phases, and the symbolic trigrams, enter into emptiness and emerge from nothingness. Within the realm of emptiness and nothingness, they engender, nurture, and perfect the work of the myriad things without weariness. Through creation and transformation, they necessarily attain their transmutation. This transformation and creation are fundamentally the transformation of non-action. The crucible has three tiers and twelve gates; fire resides within, refining the true qi of the Three Powers to harmonize and complete the Dao.\n\n**Diagram of the Eight Trigrams Gathering in the Tripod for Elixir Refinement**\nThe Eight Trigrams gather into the tripod as follows: Qian symbolizes Heaven; Kun symbolizes Earth; Zhen symbolizes the dragon issuing forth in thunder; Xun symbolizes the tiger arising in wind; Kan symbolizes clouds descending in rain; Li symbolizes lightning flashing in light; Gen symbolizes mountains communicating qi; Dui symbolizes marshes delighting in things. Through Qian’s vigor in movement and Kun’s compliance in action, the three sons and three daughters are obtained, wondrous in great function and beneficial to the myriad things. Thus, the attributes of thunder, wind, clouds, rain, and lightning all originate from and return to the clear sky—hence, the tripod. As an instrument, the tripod holds fire below, refining within it Heaven, Earth, thunder, wind, fire, mountains, water, and marshes to produce the Great Elixir.\n\n**Diagram of the Twelve Pitch Pipes**\nThe pitch of Yellow Bell corresponds to the eleventh month in use, its length nine cun and three fen, diminished by one part to generate Forest Bell. Forest Bell corresponds to the sixth month in use, increased by one part to generate Great Budding. Great Budding corresponds to the first month in use, diminished by one part to generate Southern Regulator. Southern Regulator corresponds to the eighth month in use, increased by one part to generate Maiden Purity. Maiden Purity corresponds to the third month in use, diminished by one part to generate Responsive Bell. Responsive Bell corresponds to the tenth month in use, increased by one part to generate Without Shooting. Without Shooting corresponds to the ninth month in use, diminished by one part to generate Pressed Bell. Pressed Bell corresponds to the second month in use, increased by one part to generate Level Rule. Level Rule corresponds to the seventh month in use, diminished by one part to generate Great Regulator.",

As yang and yin are unequal, they mutually derive their natural numerical values.\n\nThe total number of the eight trigrams is three hundred and sixty; halved, it becomes one hundred and eighty, symbolizing the number of a year.\n\n**Diagram of the Twenty-Four Solar Terms Added to the Qian and Kun Trigrams’ Yin-Yang Waxing and Waning**\nIn the month of the Winter Solstice, the first yang begins to grow, forming the Fu hexagram.\nOn the day of Great Cold, the second yang begins to grow, forming the Lin hexagram.\nOn the day of Rain Water, the third yang begins to grow, forming the Tai hexagram.\nOn the Spring Equinox, the fourth yang begins to grow, forming the Dazhuang hexagram.\nOn the day of Grain Rain, the fifth yang begins to grow, forming the Guai hexagram.\nOn the day of Lesser Fullness, pure yang forms the Qian hexagram.\nOn the Summer Solstice, the first yin begins to grow, forming the Gou hexagram.\nOn the day of Great Heat, the second yin begins to grow, forming the Dun hexagram.\nOn the day of the Limit of Heat, the third yin begins to grow, forming the Pi hexagram.\nOn the Autumn Equinox, the fourth yin begins to grow, forming the Guan hexagram.\nOn the day of Frost Descent, the fifth yin begins to grow, forming the Bo hexagram.\nOn the day of Lesser Snow, pure yin prevails, and the Kun hexagram governs.\n\nThis is what is meant by diminishing to augment and augmenting to diminish.\n\n**Diagram of the Six Children Added to the Twenty-Four Solar Terms’ Yin-Yang Waxing and Waning**\nThe Qian and Kun trigrams symbolize the great functions of Heaven and Earth. To further elucidate their principles, observe the movements of the sun and moon, the arising and vanishing of wind and thunder, and the communication and obstruction of mountains and marshes.\n\nBased on these six hexagrams—the three sons and three daughters—their Dao operates beginning from the Winter Solstice, with yang transforming into yin and yin transforming into yang. From the Summer Solstice onward, yin transforms into yang and yang into yin. Yin and yang intermingle, each undergoing transformation. By transforming and making them flow, the power of transforming things is made clear. This originates from the governance of non-action, arising naturally of itself.\n\n**Diagram of the Eight Trigrams’ Reversion and Repetition**\nIn the first generation, Qian transforms to become Gou; in the second, Dun; in the third, Pi; in the fourth, Guan; in the fifth, Bo. Here, from the bottom ascending upward, the fifth line reaches the extreme of transformation. Thus, after the Bo hexagram, the transformation proceeds from the top downward, called the \"wandering soul,\" yielding the Jin hexagram. After Jin, the lower three lines transform together to become Dayou, called the \"returning soul\" hexagram. The rest follow this pattern.\n\n**Diagram of the Sixty Jiazi Added to the Hexagram Images**\nThe Dao of Heaven and Earth gives birth to the myriad things, none more noble than humanity. Thus, the Dao of the Three Powers is matched with the heavenly stems, earthly branches, and musical notes to form the sixty jiazi. Therefore, from the Qian and Kun hexagrams arise sixty-four numbers, totaling eleven thousand five hundred and twenty, symbolizing the number of the myriad things.\n\nWithin these images, Zhun serves as the initial model. The sixty jiazi pair with one another, and the sixty-four hexagrams encompass the natures of the myriad things, preserving the auspicious and inauspicious, regret and remorse, anxiety and apprehension, survival and demise, gain and loss—nothing is left unaddressed.\n\n**Diagram of the Twenty-Four Solar Terms Added to the Hexagram Images**\nBeginning from the Winter Solstice, Zhongfu embodies sincerity, and the yang qi begins to grow. By the Summer Solstice, Xian embodies mutual resonance, and the first yin begins to lengthen. Thus, the hexagrams number sixty, traversing the twenty-four solar terms, totaling three hundred and sixty to complete the work of a year.\n\nWithin one year, there are three hundred and fifty-four days, with intercalary months accumulating as surplus. Thus, from the Winter Solstice to the completion of a year, the measure is three hundred and sixty-five and a quarter days. Each day governs one line, and six days and seven fen complete one hexagram. Including the surplus, the total is made whole.\n\nOnly Kan, Zhen, Li, and Dui return to the four cardinal directions and are not among the others.",

      "translated_text": "**Diagram of the Five Phases Fully Manifest**\nThe Five Phases are complete, encompassing the harmony of the Three Powers and the myriad images, the categories of the Eight Trigrams and the four cardinal directions, to illuminate the workings of transformation. Each phase occupies its own domain, where generation and restriction naturally give rise to times of compliance and opposition.\n\nFor instance, the eyes govern the liver, and when moved by anger, they may be drawn toward Metal. Metal governs the lungs, and when moved by sorrow, admonition may follow, thus through mutual resonance, they engage in the contest of restriction. If Metal is not employed, then Fire may be used: Fire governs the heart, and when met with laughter, the anger gradually dissipates, for this is the principle of mutual generation. All others follow this pattern, to clarify the Dao of the Five Phases in their compliance, opposition, generation, and restriction.\n\n**Diagram of the Generative Numbers of Heaven and Earth**\nHeaven is yang and Earth is yin; their union gives rise to existence, and each has its proper place. Heaven’s one combines with Earth’s four to generate, and Heaven’s three combines with Earth’s two to grow. From these numbers of generation and growth, the nature of Heaven and Earth may be discerned. Thus it is said: when Heaven and Earth unite, the myriad things communicate; when they do not unite, the myriad things do not communicate.\n\nHere, the yang numbers are one, three, and five, while the yin numbers are four and two. Together, yin and yang sum to fifteen. Each contributes half, completing the Dao of Heaven and Earth. Thus they are called the generative numbers, for they are named after generation and growth.\n\n**Diagram of the Completion Numbers of Heaven and Earth**\nEarth is yin. Riding the yang qi of Heaven, it fulfills the Dao of the beginning and end of the myriad things. At first, things lie hidden; in the end, they soar—all is the natural course of things. Earth possesses the yin numbers six, eight, and ten, while Heaven possesses the yang numbers seven and nine. Thus Earth’s six combines with Heaven’s nine to complete, and Earth’s eight combines with Heaven’s seven to fulfill. From these completion numbers, the nature of Heaven and Earth is revealed.\n\nAs for Heaven’s five and Earth’s ten, they interact of themselves, together completing the count. The numbers of Heaven and Earth total fifty-five, fulfilling the Dao of generation, growth, completion, and the beginning and end of the myriad things.\n\n**Diagram of the Five Movements**\nThe Five Movements traverse the ten celestial stems, forming the five qi. For example, in years governed by *jia* and *ji*, the Earth Movement prevails, manifesting as the qi of the Yellow Heaven. All others follow this pattern. Thus, the images of the Five Phases are called the Five Stars.\n\nWhen Jupiter retrogrades, it is the Wood Movement. When Mars retrogrades, it is the Fire Movement. When Venus retrogrades, it is the Metal Movement. When Mercury retrogrades, it is the Water Movement. When Saturn retrogrades, it is the Earth Movement. Following these Five Stars, they are distributed among the ten celestial stems to form the Five Movements. The stars possess cycles of concealment, delay, and retrogradation.\n\n**Diagram of the Six Qi**\nThe Six Qi clarify the three yang and three yin qi, which traverse the twelve earthly branches in mutual correspondence. For instance, in years of *yin* and *shen*, Lesser Yang governs; in years of *mao* and *you*, Yang Brightness governs; in years of *chen* and *xu*, Greater Yang governs; in years of *si* and *hai*, Reverting Yin governs; in years of *zi* and *wu*, Lesser Yin governs; in years of *chou* and *wei*, Greater Yin governs. Within each year, there are Six Qi.\n\nFor example, when Lesser Yang is the Controller of Heaven, Reverting Yin is the Director of the Earthly Springs. All others follow this pattern. Each qi endures for sixty days.\n\n**Diagram of the Four Images**\nThe Four Images further elucidate the Dao of Heaven, Earth, sun, and moon, and the numbers six, seven, eight, and nine. For instance, the old yang of *Qian* is called nine, the old yin of *Kun* is called six, the young yang of *Qian* is called seven, and the young yin of *Kun* is called eight.\n\nThus, *Qian* has six lines, each called nine, and multiplying by four yields thirty-six counting rods per line. *Kun* has six lines, each called six, and multiplying by four yields twenty-four counting rods per line. The yang lines of *Qian* total one hundred ninety-two, and the yin lines of *Kun* total one hundred ninety-two. Together, they sum to eleven thousand five hundred twenty counting rods, corresponding to the number of the myriad things.\n\n**Diagram of the Northern Dipper’s Monthly Positions**\nHeaven suspends the myriad images, with the Northern Asterism as its pivot. It governs the host of stars, ensuring none lose their proper time. The seven stars of the Northern Dipper each occupy their own direction, and their governance is described thus: the *Kui* rests upon Orion’s head, the *Shao* embraces the Dragon’s horns, and the Dipper reclines in the Great Turtle.\n\nKnow that the first star of the Northern Dipper is called the *Kui* Star, and the seventh is called the *Shao* Star. From the *Kui* to the *Shao*, there are seven stars, distributed among the seven palaces of the southern direction. Thus it is said: *xu* is the River *Kui*, and *chen* is the Heavenly Stem. Traversing the seven celestial stems mirrors the Northern Dipper.\n\n**Diagram of the Sun’s Cyclical Degrees and the Nine Paths in the Twenty-Four Solar Terms**\nOn the Winter Solstice, the sun travels through Oxherd. On the Summer Solstice, the sun travels through Well. Oxherd is the star of the southern extreme, and Well is the celestial stem of the northern extreme. From the northern extreme to the southern extreme, in one contraction and one extension, the sun traverses the twenty-four solar terms, passing through the twenty-eight lodges, covering three hundred sixty-five and a quarter degrees. Circulating through the nine paths, it reveals the workings of waxing and waning, and the principles of ascent and descent—all are encompassed in the sun’s path.\n\nThe sun completes one movement in a year, and the moon completes one cycle in a month. Thus, the sun’s motion exhibits waxing and waning, while the moon’s motion exhibits swiftness and slowness. The sun travels one degree per day, and the moon travels thirteen degrees per day, falling short by twelve degrees, mirroring the twelve months to complete a year.\n\nThe sun traverses the twelve movements of Heaven in twelve years, but the moon’s path differs. In a year without an intercalary month, it completes twelve cycles of Heaven; with an intercalary month, it completes thirteen cycles. Thus, the moon’s precise degree is twelve degrees and thirty-seven fen per day.\n\nThe motions of the sun and moon give rise to intercalary surplus.",

comprehends the principle of the divine mechanism’s inversion,\nWithin the gourd, one forever smiles with joy.\n\n**XI**\nGreen dragon and tiger never idle in their struggle;\nThe youngest daughter drives back the six eldest sons.\nOften bowing and raising the head toward the Yellow Court,\nHow would one know the Jade Chamber silently contains all?\nThe treasure vase repeatedly blooms with red lotus blossoms;\nThe lion stealthily treads the black jade pool.\nThe strongman captures the general and returns to the grotto palace—\nThe ten thousand spirits array themselves, hastening to attend.\n\n**XII**\nThe eight trigrams ride one another, determining host and guest;\nThe five phases’ generation and overcoming test lord and minister.\nThe green phoenix crashes into the fire dragon’s den;\nThe red phoenix flies to devour the golden tiger’s body.\nHusband and wife unite to harmonize the pitch-pipes;\nFather and son accord to attain the mean and purity.\nAll because the spirit and qi can be constantly preserved—\nWith each breath, one inch of the true is fused and merged.\n\n**XIII**\nTo recognize cinnabar’s precise weight and measure,\nMatch the three marvels to the southwest and north positions.\nWithin the Nine Yang Palace, open the golden door;\nBefore the Six Yin Hall, stir the jade pool.\nKnow that three hundred and eighty-four *zhu* make a distinction;\nSixteen *jin* are divided into ounces.\nUse it according to the time—before noon, after midnight—\nMyriad rays of rosy light shroud the jade radiance.\n\n**XIV**\nLead and mercury must distinguish yang and yin—\nHalf a *jin* of silver, half a *jin* of gold.\nFiery clouds fly into the Cowherd’s nose;\nFrosty moon pierces through the Weaver Girl’s heart.\nDivine water is stored, filling the golden well;\nThe source of the Dao is clarified, deepening the jade spring.\nThe inversion of ascent and descent reveals Li and Kan—\nWhere would the unenlightened seek it?\n\n**XV**\nThe sun’s essence in the east, the moon’s radiance in the west—\nJust when the Elixir Heaven is in its prime.\nThe maiden of sixteen presents an elegant demeanor;\nThe gentleman of nine and three displays his bearing.\nA crystal curtain hangs over a staircase of pearls;\nA malachite canopy suspends kingfisher-green drapes.\nIf one asks where the original return lies—\nIt has never left the tower of the Seven Stars.\n\n**XVI**\nTo whom does the *daogui* originally belong?\nThe red phoenix fixes its gaze upon the falling rosy clouds.\nOn the bank, grass meets and adds auspicious hues;\nOn the shoal, stone encounters and congeals numinous cinnabar.\nSeveral times in the northern sea, rhinoceros horns are sawed;\nRepeatedly at the southern ford, elephant tusks are plucked.\nYet there is another sight most worthy of admiration—\nWithin the Heavenly Pool, golden flowers bloom.\n\n**XVII**\nOne asks: What is most fitting?\nSeizing the divine work at the moment of creation.\nThe tiger crouches by the azure pool, wind rustling;\nThe dragon coils in the vermilion grotto, rain dripping.\nCloud maiden scatters, and thunder quiets;\nDew drips, and the stars and constellations shift.\nOnly when a white silk sash stretches across the east\nWill rosy clouds bear forth a single wheel of dawn’s radiance.",

      "translated_text": "**XVIII**\nA pure breeze soars, vast and boundless—this age is not the same.\nThose who grasp not the subtle call it mere emptiness.\nPoetic rapture delights only the self when the meaning is caught;\nHow many truly fathom the words of the Dao, heart to heart?\nAll because clinging to nature obscures true nature,\nAnd the pure breeze scatters, leaving the teachings dim.\nA single grain of golden elixir lies within the crucible—\nYet without immortal bones, who can plumb its depths?\n\n**XIX**\nWithin the Nine Yang Palaces, a great awakened monk\nRaises his fist in steadfast meditation, reciting the *Yellow Court*.\nDivine radiance pierces the treasury of empty space;\nAuspicious qi congeals, pure, in the jeweled vase.\nRoaming the grotto-heavens, he displays his mastery;\nPervading the dharma-realm, he unleashes his numinous might.\nFrom this, he grasps the intent of the Western Advent—\nBefore the primal chaos, how could there have been form?\n\n**XX**\nTo learn immortality, one must refine the golden elixir,\nPlacing lead and mercury within the tripod’s embrace.\nApply the fire, circulate the heavens in due order;\nAdd to the work through months and years—do not tarry.\nPreserve spirit by first stilling the heart’s core;\nNurture qi—let not the tongue’s well run dry.\nThrough all twelve hours, never slacken—\nThen nature and life will be preserved whole.\n\n**XXI**\nFive qi dwell together in one palace, a single household,\nMutually sustaining, revolving in mist-wreathed livelihood.\nWhat carriage does not ascend the road to Chang’an?\nPrecious goods ever abide in the moon’s osmanthus glow.\nLead and mercury blend, yielding supreme auspice;\nQi and spirit, wisdom and numen, crystallize into cinnabar.\nThe wondrous work of perfected truth aligns with the profound—\nDrink deeply of flowing rosy clouds, bathe in radiant haze.\n\n**XXII**\nHow may one drink the knife’s measure?\nOnly the bloodless lamb reaches that shore.\nMountain and marsh qi commune—clouds rise from the valley;\nEarth and heaven harmonize—wood ascends the ladder.\nKan and Li unite, revealing inversion;\nDragon and tiger return, dispelling delusion.\nGrasp the principle within this ebb and flow—\nThen tread upon clouds and mist as if on level ground.\n\n**XXIII**\nEver hear the golden and stone tones within the gourd?\nWhen worldly passions fade, Dao-passion arises.\nOnce the yang-spirit is whole, sleep vanishes entirely;\nWhen the yin-soul dissolves, clarity dawns anew.\nA lotus born in fire is still within reach;\nA clod shaped in water surely takes form.\nWhen these two things merge in perfect harmony,\nSteer the cloud-chariot steadily toward Jade Capital.\n\n**XXIV**\nIdly drawing the golden crow to feast in the moon palace,\nBy chance they meet and fuse as one.\nDivine radiance illumines the numinous, empty body;\nThe wondrous Dao pierces the cage of creation.\nOnly then does the heart-mind recognize the guest in the snail-shell abode;\nOnly then does wisdom’s gaze behold the true host.\nFrom this awakening, the body is seen as hindrance—\nTo cling not to hollow names is the great penetration.\n\n**XXV**\nTo learn the Dao, first sever all outward splendor;\nTo cultivate truth and nurture simplicity befits the immortal clan.\nForget emotion, for it refines the golden liquor;\nStill thoughts, for they temper the purple cinnabar.\nOne nature, at dawn, gathers the five qi;\nMyriad spirits, at the crown, unfurl the triple blossom.\nFrom this, the path of longevity is attained—\nForever blend with the clear empyrean, one with rosy clouds.\n\n**XXVI**\nThose who leave the household do so seeking immortality,\nYet it lies only in the oral transmission of a true master.\nWithin the crucible, flying lead is ever preserved;\nWithin the tripod, mercury congeals, ever fresh.\nMolten gold, ground to powder, dissolves the dragon’s bones;\nDripping dew, crystallized to frost, lengthens the jade drool.\nOnce the heart-mirror is polished to shining clarity,\nThe original face naturally becomes whole.\n\n**XXVII**\nIn cultivation, do not force a carefree air,\nNor in an empty chamber cling to solitude.\nLet not the Purple Palace allow the tigers to battle;\nLet the Elixir Palace command the myriad spirits to pay homage.\nRoaming mountains, ever find the azure empyrean’s path;\nCrossing waters, always mount the hollowed-wood bridge.\nGather and consume the magic fungus without cease—\nWhy hang a gourd and begging bowl beneath the pines?\n\n**XXVIII**\nWithin the Three-One Gourd, scenes are extraordinary—\nA long-browed elder sits, gazing at pines and bamboo.\nSix *zhu* of crimson hue adorn his golden form;\nTwelve-storied towers drink the jade nectar.\nBy the white crane’s tree, he bows and rises again;\nBy the black turtle’s pool, he sways low and high.\nA numinous youth, stepping in Kan-trigrams, approaches,\nOffering the master the elixir of life.\n\n**XXIX**\nPrimordial qi blends into a body of purity;\nRosy clouds burst forth in five directions’ glow.\nThe golden elixir crystallizes in the pure yang adept;\nJade liquor waters the ever-blooming flower.\nWithin the formless gate, white snow drifts;\nWithin the treasury of empty space, the yellow sprout emerges.\nFew tread the path of longevity—\nOnly the immortals and Daoists.\n\n**XXX**\nHeavenly winds unfurl the Luoyang blossoms;\nThe six directions share one path—intent unerring.",
