Also known as *The Perfected Text of the Nine Heavens’ Eight Registers Worn at the Sash*.\n\nThe compiler is unknown, but it likely emerged during the Eastern Jin or Southern Dynasties. Originally one of the eight scrolls of *The Yellow Writ of the Great Mystery of the Grand Tenuity*, it expounds methods of wearing talismans to attain transcendence.\n\nSource text: *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Methods* section of the *Great Mystery* division.\n\n---\n\n**The Perfected Text of the Nine Heavens’ Eight Registers of the Yellow Writ of the Great Mystery**\n**Secret Formula of the Sash from the Mysterious Capital**\n\nThe script of the Eight Assemblies of the Supreme Thearch of the Grand Tenuity is inscribed with characters of soaring mysterious purple *qi*. Reciting its text subjugates the myriad evils; wearing its characters allows one to wander the Nine Heavens, overawe the Six Realms, and command the reverence of the ten thousand spirits as their guardian.\n\nThose destined to receive this Dao may wander the Five Marchmounts, enter the Three Clarities, and suppress inauspicious forces.\n\nWithin the Grand Tenuity reside the Three Sovereigns and One Thearch. The Sovereigns are the ministers of the Lord: the first is the Sovereign Lord, the second the Sovereign Heaven, and the third the Sovereign Elder. These are the *qi* of the Three Origins, the perfected of primordial chaos, who come and go from the Palace of the Grand Clarity, the Grand Simplicity, and the Grand Harmony.\n\nThe Three August Perfected of Heaven concealed the text of the Eight Assemblies in Mount Wei Yu, while the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity concealed one copy in Tortoise Mountain, engraving it within a chamber of green stone.\n\nThe Immortal King of the Mysterious Capital once received it from the Three Elder Sovereigns of the Grand Tenuity and secretly transmitted it to immortals, hence its name, *The Perfected Text Worn at the Sash*.\n\nAll who receive this Dao from a master must offer five taels of gold and one set of ritual robes, binding the sash as a token of their covenant. The Dao is held in reverence, and its text kept secret.\n\nThe Perfected Lord of the Western City once received it from the Queen Mother of Tortoise Mountain, hence its alternate names, *The Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity* or *The Nine Heavens’ Eight Registers*.\n\nIf transmitted to the unworthy, the corpses of three generations of ancestors will be destroyed, and calamity will flow to their descendants.\n\nThose who possess the *Perfected Text Worn at the Sash* and whose names are already recorded in the Palace of the Grand Tenuity—whether read forward or backward, from any of the four directions—will find its characters form coherent script.\n\nWhen entering mountains, wandering the Five Marchmounts, or resting at night, one should constantly recite it aloud. Then, fierce beasts, the thousand demons, and the myriad evils will not dare to test you.\n\nWearing it on the left elbow allows one to traverse the Six Realms, govern the world, and suppress the ten thousand weapons. Moving in any of the four directions, the characters will array themselves in orderly ranks. Inscribe them on green silk with yellow ink and wear them on the left elbow to behold the August Lord of the Golden Gates of Great Peace.\n\nIf I wish to command ghosts and spirits, I shall submit them to the Five Characters, beginning from the top and proceeding downward. After five years, I may then employ ghosts and spirits at will.\n\n*The Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity* comprises eight scrolls in total. The Thearch of the Grand Tenuity transmitted it to the Most High.\n\n*The Highest Scripture of the Eight Enclosures and Four Gates of the Grand Tenuity, First Scroll*\n*The Purple Essence of the Nine Numinous Flowers of the Central Hua of the Grand Tenuity, Second Scroll*\n*The Precious Chapters of the Jade Void of the Grand Tenuity, Third Scroll*\n*The Radiant Brilliance Within the Precious Clouds of the Jade Chamber of the Grand Tenuity, Fourth Scroll*\n*The Mother of Water and Fire of the Three Qi and Nine Transformations of the Grand Tenuity, Fifth Scroll*\n*The Five Paths of the Central Spirits of the Grand Tenuity: Stepping Through the Void and Flying, Sixth Scroll*\n*The Golden Yang Essence Scripture of the Stone Scenery of the Grand Tenuity, Seventh Scroll*\n*The Interwoven Texts of the True Writ of the Eight Records of the Nine Heavens of the Grand Tenuity, Eighth Scroll*\n\nOf the eight scrolls of *The Yellow Writ of the Grand Tenuity*, the first, second, third, and fourth do not circulate in the world. The fifth, sixth, and seventh are transmitted only to those destined to become Perfected Ones. The eighth, which is this text, is to be transmitted solely to those of predetermined faith. Without one who dwells in seclusion, pursues distant aspirations, loves the Dao, and believes in truth, none may receive it recklessly. Reckless transmission will bring punishment upon the three ancestral lines by the Water Officials.\n\nWhen signs of resonance appear and one is deemed worthy of transmission, bestow it along with its essential teachings. Those who possess it shall become divine immortals.\n\nPurify oneself for three days before receiving it. The recipient shall pay homage to the Thearch of the Grand Tenuity nine times in a year. The homage is performed at dawn on the first day of the lunar month, facing north within a quiet chamber, girded with a sash and clad in ritual vestments. Bow four times, then strike the teeth thrice and kneel to pray:\n\n*\"O Supreme Perfected Ones of the Grand Tenuity, Celestial Thearch of the Great August,\nYour humble servant [Name] makes this entreaty and declaration:\nTo the Four August Emperors above, the Life-Controllers of the Grand Tenuity,\nTo the Purple Mystery and Cinnabar Numinous, resplendent as sun and moon,\nTo the Golden Essence and Precious Treasures, the Eight Awes of August Heaven,\nI pray for longevity, that heaven and earth may endure as one,\nThat ghosts and spirits become my servants, that metal and stone open before me,\nThat I may govern the Six Realms and command the ten thousand weapons,\n[...] like thunderbolts in flight,\nThat my years be boundless, my blessings towering,\nThat fortune flows in and virtue departs not,\nThat my countenance remain youthful, my eyes clear, my ears sharp,\nThat my four limbs never decline,\nThat jade maidens attend me, and I ascend in radiance to the Grand Tenuity.\"*\n\nUpon completion, rise and bow twice more, then kneel.
