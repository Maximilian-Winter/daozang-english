  "full_translation": "**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* (Part Four)**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness*\n**Commentary by:** Daoist Hou Shanyuan of the Jin Dynasty\n**One fascicle.**\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness***\n\nBefore the source stirs, all streams are pure;\nBefore the wind fans, all things are still.\nYet when streams are muddied, the clear becomes turbid;\nWhen winds scatter, the still moves.\nSuch is the constant principle of things.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the myriad beings, their nature inherently pristine—profoundly clear, utterly still, responsive and unobstructed. But when nature is swayed by emotion, losing its celestial truth, beings drift without return, sinking into the sea of suffering amid the cycles of birth and death. How pitiful!\n\nOut of boundless compassion and skillful means, the Supreme Lord guides the lost, restoring them to their original essence so they may behold the Dao. Though the Dao cannot be transmitted through words, how few are those who perceive it with a single glance? Though the Dao cannot be taught through images, the parable of \"forgetting the trap once the fish is caught\" suggests it still requires some support. Thus, this scripture was composed.\n\nThis scripture’s earnest teachings begin: \"Purity is the source of turbidity; stillness is the foundation of movement. If one can abide in constant purity and stillness, heaven and earth all return to them.\" It continues: \"The spirit delights in purity, yet the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in stillness, yet desires entangle it. If one can constantly dispel desires, the heart becomes still; if one clarifies the heart, the spirit becomes pure.\" Further, it states: \"Inwardly observe the heart—when the heart is no-heart; outwardly observe form—when form is no-form; distantly observe things—when things are no-things. Profoundly still, stillness without stillness—this is true stillness. Responding to things with true stillness, one gradually enters the true Dao.\" It concludes: \"Though called ‘attaining the Dao,’ there is in truth nothing attained. For the sake of transforming beings, it is called ‘attaining the Dao.’\" Is this not the great purport of this true scripture?\n\nSince the Queen Mother of the West bestowed it, immortals like Ge Xuan have transmitted it, and the Perfected of the Great Mystery praised it, generations have revered and upheld it. Yet how many fools remain dull their whole lives, how many deluded never awaken—how few live up to the Supreme Lord’s compassionate and skillful intent!\n\nNow, Master Hou of Mount Li is one who wanders beyond the mundane. Reflecting that those who comprehend this scripture’s words may transmit the sagely Dao, he has elucidated its meaning with commentary. His words are concise and easily understood; his principles are penetrating and easily practiced. Through them, one may:\n- Dispel desires and extinguish the Three Poisons;\n- Observe the mind and recognize emptiness;\n- Banish the deluded mind of attachment;\n- Admonish against the afflictions of craving.\n\nFollowing the sages’ works, he illuminates and clarifies. Within his text, he states:\n- \"Awakening without action is right; attaining through effort is wrong.\"\n- \"Within the great Dao there are no words; within words there is no great Dao. Celestial texts and jade instructions must be transmitted orally by a master.\"\n- \"Do not cling to emptiness as emptiness; do not fixate on being as being.\"\n- \"Embrace the radiant purity of the numinous flower; return to the light of oneness.\"\n\nIf scholars recite and uphold this scripture without retreat, they may attain the mystery of direct perception, not waiting until after \"forgetting the trap.\"\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Mao Hui, the Old Man of Pingshui.\n\n---\n\n### **The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness***\n**Commentary by Hou Shanyuan, the Perfected of the Great Mystery of Mount Guye**\n\nThe Lord Lao said:\n**The great Dao is formless.**\nThat which is formless is the vast, boundless yang abyss—immeasurable and infinite, harmonizing heart and body, subtle and without limit. Thus, it is said the great Dao is formless.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe great Dao is originally formless,\nFormless is but a borrowed name.\nGazing, one finds no thing;\nListening closely, no sound remains.\nAwakened nature penetrates the profound and still;\nNurtured spirit pierces the eye’s clarity.\nThe great void has no companion,\nA solitary moon illumines Penglai’s isles.\n\n**It gives birth to and nurtures heaven and earth.**\nHeaven and earth possess form and image, all sustained by the Dao’s nurturance. Thus, it is said to give birth to and nurture heaven and earth.\n\n*Ode:*\nOne qi gives birth to heaven and earth,\nThe Three Luminaries within it reside.\nThe four seasons divide creation,\nThe myriad beings attain harmony.\nTo comprehend the Dharma of no-birth,\nKnow the heart’s exhaustion beyond things.\nThe utmost truth shines endlessly,\nEver in communion with the Dao.\n\n**The great Dao is without emotion.**\nThat the Dao is without emotion means it is profoundly non-manifest, utterly empty and without intent. The myriad beings are born and completed, spontaneously transforming without contrivance. Thus, it is said the great Dao is without emotion.\n\n*Ode:*\nWithout emotion, it pervades the great Dao,\nNurturing and sustaining, fundamentally without emotion.\nIt grasps the flourishing of heaven and earth,\nEncompasses the brightness of the cosmos.\nAbove, it pierces the Golden Gates’ realm;\nBelow, it penetrates the Nine Dark Realms.\nVast and boundless, unfathomable,\nMysteriously veiling the Jade Capital.\n\n**It moves the sun and moon.**\nThe sun and moon are the Dao’s numinous radiance, the lords of human and spirit. They circulate in all directions, universally illuminating without obscurity.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe great Dao clarifies the empty expanse,\nThe sun and moon at heaven’s edge endure.\nThey circulate throughout the boundless realm,\nAscending to traverse every region.\nManifesting the purity of the numinous flower,\nReturning to the light of oneness.\nThose who grasp this meaning,\nFind the immortal land close at hand.\n\n**The great Dao is without name.**\nThat which is nameless is the great Dao—penetrating the profound and subtle, the ultimate principle without end. The primordial qi of the undifferentiated origin existed before heaven and earth, inherently without name.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe Dao transforms the empty body,\nProvisionally given a borrowed name.\nWith a name, yet no form;\nWithout things, yet no shape.\nAbove, it illumines the Three Heavens;\nHorizontally, it bears the Four Seas’ brightness.\nUnfolding the eye of purity and stillness,\nIt soars like a shooting star.\n\n**It nurtures the myriad beings.**\nThe great Dao, vast and formless, profoundly still and unmoving, luminous and pure, covers and shelters heaven and earth, moves the sun and moon, flows through rivers, grasps mountains and streams, contains valleys and ravines, overflows gardens and groves, ripens the five grains, and brings forth the blossoming of flowers and fruits.\n\nAll the myriad beings are born by receiving the Dao’s qi, inherently acting without contrivance, transforming spontaneously in response to the seasons. The Dao is originally formless, yet nurtures the formed. Thus it is said to nurture the myriad beings.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe Dao transforms the teeming multitudes,\nSpontaneously giving life to things.\nMist and radiance span ten thousand leagues,\nLush beauty illumines a thousand mountains.\nVerdant fields stretch through ravines,\nPure sounds echo beneath the azure sky.\nAwakening to this land of true blessing,\nHere the flying immortals conceal themselves.\nI know not its name.\n\nThe Most High said: I know not the name of this,\nFor it abides alone without hindrance,\nA mechanism of supreme truth and mystery,\nWithout birth or extinction, without increase or decrease,\nConcealing and revealing without fixed direction.\nAs sentient beings fail to awaken,\nThe Most High, in compassion, provisionally established a name.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe wondrous Dao is hard to awaken to,\nYet when the mind opens, wisdom becomes numinous.\nThe original spirit grows from a firm root,\nThe empty valley bears perfect clarity.\nThe sea’s depths congeal radiant pearls,\nThe mountain’s summit blends the sun’s essence.\nThe sky is filled with the dawn’s precious mirror,\nIts light illumining the Jade Capital.\n\nForcibly called the Dao.\nThe Dao is originally nameless.\nOnce given a name, it attaches to forms;\nIf one acts without mind, one dies into hollow emptiness.\nBeing and non-being give rise to each other,\nDarkness and obscurity stand in opposition.\nResponding to things, it manifests form,\nYet in daily use, it is never apart.\n\nHard to distinguish from the teachings of the true Dharma,\nIt is forcibly called the Dao.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe Dao is originally beyond words,\nYet forcibly named to distinguish it.\nWhen the mind is clear, refined qi congeals,\nWhen nature is still, numinous clouds gather.\nA fresh wind rises over the sea,\nAn ancient moon appears at the sky’s edge.\nIn emptiness, self and things become clear,\nThe ten thousand images are all embraced.\n\nNow, the Dao possesses both clarity and turbidity.\nThat which is clear is vast, empty, and open,\nThe spirit-valley silent and void,\nA single qi harmoniously surging—\nThus it is called clarity.\nThat which is turbid encompasses the myriad beings,\nNothing it does not contain,\nNothing it does not enter,\nPermeating the world,\nPenetrating even the finest hair—\nThus it is said to possess both clarity and turbidity.\n\n*Ode:*\nClarity and turbidity determine floating and sinking,\nYin and yang operate through ancient and modern times.\nThe sky hangs with jade-like images,\nThe earth produces forests of precious trees.\nLeaning in clarity upon the Cao Stream’s path,\nThe spirit congeals in the depths of the Dharma sea.\nOnly by understanding this principle\nCan the heart of the Dao-person be revealed.\n\nThere is movement and stillness.\nStillness is the great Dao, silent and without mind.\nMovement is the spirit’s function, responding and penetrating the mysterious.\nIn the interplay of movement and stillness,\nThe true Dao may be realized.\n\n*Ode:*\nMovement and stillness expand the Dao’s reach,\nThe divine elixir shoots toward the sun.\nThe celestial soul gathers at the Kan position,\nThe earthly soul enters the Li region.\nFrom the sea’s depths, the dragon churns waves,\nOn the mountain’s summit, the tiger battles the azure.\nCaptured and returned to the vast realm,\nLife and nature attain extension.\n\nHeaven is clear, earth is turbid.\nHeaven’s clarity is the primordial qi,\nFilling and surging through emptiness,\nProfoundly distant and utterly deep.\nEarth’s turbidity gives rise to humanity,\nNothing it does not cultivate,\nNothing it does not harvest,\nBearing the filth of the myriad people—\nThus it is said that heaven is clear and earth is turbid.\n\n*Ode:*\nEarth’s qi reaches the azure sky,\nClear heaven fills the four directions.\nWithin lie buried ancient traces,\nAbove and below, new light transcends.\nThose who attain return to the true path,\nSilently entering the Dao’s realm.\nThe jade infant ascends the jeweled hall,\nGazing afar at the Miluo River.\n\nHeaven moves, earth is still.\nMovement and stillness: heaven is round, earth is square,\nThus naturally giving rise to a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations,\nThe stars shift, the Dipper turns,\nOperating the pivot of the axis.\nEarth’s stillness: wind stirs the waves,\nStupidly enduring defilement without contention—\nThus it is said that heaven moves and earth is still.\n\n*Ode:*\nEarth is still, inherently without contrivance,\nThe celestial pivot follows the Dipper’s handle.\nCreation arises without fabrication,\nTransformation unfolds with numinous mechanism.\nGazing afar, the autumn moon is bright,\nFocusing the eyes, the sun’s radiance gleams.\nA single yang is gathered into the crucible,\nAdvancing the fire to nurture the spirit-turtle.\n\nMan is clear, woman is turbid.\nMan is yang; woman is yin.\nThus they are called true yin and true yang.\nThis does not refer to worldly men and women,\nFor they are seen when not in use,\nAnd not seen when in use.\nThus the *Virtue Classic* says:\nThe myriad beings all bear yin and embrace yang.\nExternally yang, internally yin.\nExternally, the body;\nInternally, the heart and nature.\nWhy is this so?\nEven in cultivating practitioners:\nIf the body is still, is this not man’s clarity?\nIf the heart and nature are disturbed and restless,\nIs this not woman’s turbidity?\n\n*Ode:*\nThings may be still, yet the heart is not,\nThe body may be clear, yet nature is not.\nDeluded by truth, doubting the indistinct,\nWith scattered intent, how can there be peace?\nReturning the light to the golden crucible,\nReversing the gaze into the precious vase.\nClearly opening the Dao’s eye,\nWhy worry about not attaining perfection?\n\nMan moves, woman is still.\nMan’s movement is not governed by sexual union.\nMovement is instability; stillness is stability.\nThus movement arises from the yang Dao,\nLike parting clouds to reveal the sun,\nPolishing a mirror to attain clarity.\nThus yin returns to yang—\nThis is called man’s movement.\nWoman’s stillness means the yang Dao opens naturally,\nThe spirit transforms into emptiness and clarity,\nWithout licentiousness or deviance,\nWithout hatred or love,\nWithout greed or anger,\nWithout jealousy or envy,\nWithout arising or thought,\nWithout delusion or imagination—\nIs this not woman’s stillness?\n\nIt is also said:\nWithin Li, emptiness; within Kan, fullness.\nClearly taking the fullness within Kan to transform the emptiness within Li—\nThis is the method of inverting yin and yang,\nThe practice of returning to pure yang.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe method of inverting yin and yang,\nWithin the furnace, gathering mercury and lead.\nClear light shines upon the earth,\nCrimson flames burst through the cosmos.\nThe white tiger reclines in the pool,\nThe green dragon sleeps within the fire.\nRefining into the true jade countenance,\nBeyond the body, the fetal immortal dances.\n\nDescending from the root to the branches, giving rise to the myriad beings.\nDescending from the root is the origin of the branches.\nVirtue and the Dao are the root,\nA single qi surging through emptiness,\nIssuing forth the principle of spontaneity.\nThe myriad beings attain their root,\nNurtured without withering,\nBranches and leaves flourishing.\nHumans attain their root,\nThe spirit numinous and unfathomable,\nManifesting without fixed direction.\n\n*Ode:*\nDescending from the root, harmonious and elegant,\nFollowing the mechanism, things arise spontaneously.\n\nTwo crimson mists arise,\nA single thread of pale smoke pours forth.\nThe tiger drinks the golden crow’s marrow,\nThe dragon swallows the jade hare’s essence.\nThese two are the true and supreme treasures—\nThose who awaken become spiritually numinous.\n\nThe clear is the source of the turbid.\nWhen water is clear, the abyss reflects with luminous clarity,\nIts form naturally manifest,\nDistinct from the turbid.\nThis wellspring of clarity is likened to the practitioner.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe heart’s abyss shines with bottomless clarity,\nThe Dao’s stillness mirrors the primordial throughway.\nThe jade gate overflows with yang essence,\nThe golden pass surges with boundless qi.\nIn harmony, they gather at the Kan palace,\nIn union, they are sent to the Li chamber.\nOnly then does the mysterious pearl descend,\nSoaring heavenward, radiant as the sun.\n\nStillness is the foundation of movement.\nStillness is the Dao, the great void of emptiness.\nThe spirit, in its function, enters and exits without obstruction,\nMerging with the profound and obscure as one body.\nThus it is called the foundation of movement.\n\n*Ode:*\nSilent and empty, nothing remains,\nThe spirit and the Dao’s essence are one.\nThe heavens clear, azure waves surge,\nThe earth still, crimson ripples well.\nThe four images bore through the furnace’s mouth,\nThe five phases enter the crucible.\nRefined, the elixir glows crimson,\nConsumed, one awakens to ascend the immortal palace.\n\nIf one can remain perpetually clear and still,\nThe heavens are ever clear and still—\nSun, moon, and stars gleam white in empty brightness.\nWhen humans remain clear and still,\nEssence, qi, and spirit settle, never scattering.\nThus it is said: one can remain perpetually clear and still.\n\n*Ode:*\nFree from the stains of desire,\nCut off from the red dust’s comings and goings.\nThe light of nature soars like the bright sun,\nThe heart’s ground floats in the vast sky.\nA single qi refines the primordial image,\nThe twin passes temper the subtle.\nSpirit and essence pierce the cosmos,\nRadiance shimmering across the three thousand realms.\n\nHeaven and earth all return.\nWhen one is clear and still,\nThe spirit’s wondrous principle ascends into non-action,\nEncompassing heaven and earth,\nPenetrating even the tiniest speck of dust.\nThus it is said: heaven and earth all return.\n\n*Ode:*\nAbiding in stillness, dwelling in non-action,\nNon-action attains the wondrous mechanism.\nThe toad palace races with the jade hare,\nThe sun’s hall hastens with the crow’s flight.\nFlaring forth a thousand dazzling lights,\nBursting open ten thousand radiant forms.\nEncompassing all appearances,\nHeaven and earth all return.\n\nThe human spirit favors clarity, yet emotions disturb it.\nThe human spirit—heaven and earth’s refined qi,\nCongealed into luminous brightness—\nIs inherently clear and still,\nYet follows things to generate emotions,\nClinging to dust and attracting defilement.\nThus it is said: emotions disturb it.\n\n*Ode:*\nWealth and rank veil the heart’s eye,\nGlory and splendor blind the vision with dust.\nThough one may gaze upon sun and moon,\nThe original truth remains unseen.\nSerene and profound, nurturing the primordial nature,\nLimpid and empty, refining the supreme spirit.\nThe numinous youth opens the azure peaks,\nThe immortal maiden rides the qilin.\n\nThe human heart favors stillness, yet desires entangle it.\nThe heart is the spirit’s illumination—\nInwardly known as nature,\nOutwardly manifest as spirit.\nThe spirit is inherently clear and still,\nYet swayed by winds, it becomes disordered,\nMoved by things, desires entangle it.\n\n*Ode:*\nEyes open, the celestial jades are revealed,\nYet the human heart strays where it clings.\nClinging to emotions, desires disturb,\nChasing scenes, scenes follow in turn.\nEmbracing simplicity, penetrating the pure and refined,\nThe singular true refines the myriad images,\nMerging with the great abyss in equality.\n\nIf one can constantly dispel desires, the heart naturally stills.\nTo dispel desires is to sever attachments, leave loved ones,\nEliminate emotions, abandon cravings,\nCast aside thoughts, forsake scheming—\nThen nature is naturally still, the heart serene.\n\n*Ode:*\nEver steadfast in guarding stillness,\nThe square inch nurtures the spirit’s numinosity.\nClosing the door, the golden child sleeps,\nLowering the curtain, the jade infant is embraced.\nMysterious frost refines the supreme treasure,\nPurple powder tempers true emotion.\nThe radiant mysterious pearl is formed,\nGathered to offer to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nWhen the heart is settled, the spirit naturally clarifies.\nCalming the heart, stabilizing the intent,\nProfoundly still and limpidly clear,\nReturning to the root, reverting to the origin—\nLike water undisturbed.\nThus it is said: when the heart is settled, the spirit naturally clarifies.\n\n*Ode:*\nTo know the spirit’s source,\nRecognize emptiness before your eyes.\nThe heart-moon shines with limpid clarity,\nThe nature-light glows in perfect roundness.\nQi flourishes, connecting to the divine and sagely,\nThe spirit’s wind transforms into feathered immortals.\nCarefree, returning to the island in the sea,\nAlone, spanning the three realms.\n\nNaturally, the six desires do not arise.\nThe six desires are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent.\n\"Not arising\" means:\nThe eyes behold no colors, the spirit does not stray in sight;\nThe ears hear no sounds, voice and form go unheard;\nThe nose’s breath is harmonious, neither fragrance nor stench admitted;\nThe tongue savors no flavors, neither sour nor sweet relished;\nThe intent embraces heaven’s truth, not deluded by external scenes.\nThus it is said: the six desires return to truth, naturally not arising.\n\n*Ode:*\nReturning to truth, eliminating the six harms,\nExhausting leaks, escaping the three calamities.\nRecognizing nature, the mysterious path opens,\nKnowing the heart, the Dao’s eye awakens.\nThe wooden man roams the vast heavens,\nThe stone maiden plays on the immortal steps.\nAs the sun sets on a clear autumn night,\nAt the sky’s edge, the moon is embraced.\n\nThe three poisons are extinguished.\nThe three poisons are bodily karma, mental karma, and verbal karma.\n\"Extinguished\" means:\nNurturing essence, qi, and spirit with goodness,\nEradicating greed, anger, and jealousy.\nThus it is said: the three poisons are extinguished.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe six desires become a golden treasury,\nThe three calamities transform into precious pearls.\nThe seven emotions remain unstained,\nThe ten evils forever dissolved.\nWiping clean the ice terrace, it gleams,\nIts radiance neither furled nor unfurled.\nEmbraced, one roams the earthly realm,\nAlone, stepping into the clear void.\n\nThose who cannot do so—\nFail to eliminate emotions and desires in cultivating the Dao,\nTheir hearts clinging to something.\n\n*Ode:*\nUnable to practice this path,\nNature reverts, doubts arise.\nSitting in meditation exhausts heart and strength,\nInvestigating Chan strains the spleen.\nStanding and walking lack distinction,\nSitting and lying ever follow.\nTo see the opening of the clear eye,\nThe spirit’s light fills the chamber.\n\nFor the heart is not settled—\nThe heart-nature unsettled, disturbances abound.\nThe spirit wanders external scenes,\nGazing at the subtle, clinging to things.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe highest good’s heart is an abyss,\nLimpid and clear, reflecting the azure heavens.\nWorldly emotions bring much suffering,\nPeople are bound by karmic conditions.\nChasing waves, the true nature is deluded,\nFollowing ripples, the root is obscured.\nA single spirit returns to the bitter sea,\nTen thousand kalpas without return.\n\nDesires are not dispelled—\nA lifetime unaltered, things turn the heart.\n\n*Ode:*\nCultivating illusions, applying effort in vain,\nDiverging from the true matter.\nConditioned actions are like shadows,\nClinging to forms like drifting winds.\nThings are borrowed, the heart is not;\nThe body is empty, nature is not.\n\nA single spirit knows its master,\nAnd the ten thousand dharmas all become clear.\nThe one who can dispel them\nTurns amidst the ten thousand things,\nThe heart abides in formlessness,\nNurturing the spirit in the wondrous.\n\n*Ode:*\nNurturing the heart, one grasps the sage’s mechanism,\nWithout form, it equals the void in equilibrium.\nRippling waves grow still,\nThe sunlit abyss stretches boundless.\nFlowing through all realms,\nRoaming with the power of the great spirit.\nThe moon illumines the cosmos with clarity,\nA pure wind escorts one home.\n\nInwardly observe the heart—\nThe heart has no heart.\nReturn to observe the heart—\nSilent, it is without heart.\nThis heart,\nWhen the eyes open, the void is clear,\nReveals the true heart.\nThe true heart,\nProfound and still, without thing,\nMerges with the sun in pure oneness.\nThus is it named the heart.\n\n*Ode:*\nReturning the light, one sees the heart of heaven,\nPerfect and bright, deep as the limpid azure.\nThe form of true reality is neither non-being,\nNor can being be sought.\nMountains and seas offer no obstruction,\nHeavenly disasters and misfortunes cannot invade.\nWho is the true person’s companion?\nThe wind and moon are their confidants.\n\nOutwardly observe the form—\nThe form has no form.\nForm is earth, water, fire, and wind.\nThis is called the body of outflows.\nThe body not of outflows\nIs thus the true without form.\nThe true without form\nIs like gazing at the moon in water,\nLike the sky turning with pure wind,\nSpirit congealed, qi gathered—\nThus may the true Dao be attained.\n\n*Ode:*\nOutwardly observing the form of outflows,\nIllusion transforms into true form.\nDeparture and abiding leave no trace,\nSerene, without the slightest pause.\nWithin, all is indistinct,\nInward and outward, dark and profound.\nMelting like ice about to dissolve,\nThe depths of the sea of awakening grow clear.\n\nObserve things from afar—\nThings have no thing.\nWithin and without, all is empty—\nWhat then remains at a distance?\nThis is the absence of things.\nWithin the absence of things,\nThere is another wondrous thing.\nThe sutra says: *Dimly, dimly, faintly—*\n*Within it, there is a thing.*\nThus it is said: *Things have no thing.*\n\n*Ode:*\nVast and boundless, the indistinct,\nWithin the crucible, scenes are fine.\nThe furnace door pours forth jade medicine,\nThe cauldron’s eye brims with golden blossoms.\nTigers encircle the luminous pearl in play,\nDragons spew ten thousand miles of rosy clouds.\nParting the clouds and mist to gaze,\nOne cradles the night-shining sand.\n\nHaving awakened to these three—\nThese three are heart, form, and thing,\nWhich are but emptiness.\nAwakening is comprehension.\n\n*Ode:*\nA metaphor speaks of three bodies,\nYet the profound is one, without duality.\nBeing and non-being are both illusions,\nWithout care, the Dao lends support.\nThe Dharma-eye is the elixir cauldron,\nThe Gate of Heaven is the medicine furnace.\nRefining, cinnabar and mercury congeal,\nPoured into a single crystal flask.\n\nOnly the void is seen.\nWithin, without, and between—\nAll is unattached,\nPerfectly bright, vast and unobstructed,\nThe heart enters non-action.\nThus it is said: *Only the void is seen.*\n\n*Ode:*\nObserving emptiness is not form,\nFor form is true emptiness.\nSelf and things both forgotten,\nOnly then does one know the primordial unity.\nCircling endlessly without cessation,\nCounting exhaustively without limit.\nThe heavenly net is vast,\nThe net of the profound covers all.\n\nObserve emptiness—emptiness too is empty.\nObserving emptiness,\nThe Dao is vast, without form,\nThe ten thousand dharmas are without shape.\nEmptiness too is empty—\nSpirit’s wondrous transformations,\nThe one body returns to the true.\n\n*Ode:*\nRadiant, it cleanses the clear sky,\nThe spirit roams the four seas.\nVast and obscure, it pervades heaven and earth,\nIndistinct, it merges with the great void.\nThe moon gleams in the azure night,\nThe wind drifts through the emerald firmament.\nFreely it traverses above and below,\nNorth and south, east and west.\n\nEmptiness is not clung to as emptiness.\nEmptiness is not grasped,\nFor emptiness does not attach to being.\nBeing and the heart are one—\nWithin the Supreme Ultimate,\nMystery gathers in the wondrous.\n\n*Ode:*\nBoundless, without corner,\nDarkly, transformation operates in the void.\nWithout form, it is called the great Dao,\nBeyond form, it is named true suchness.\nOne body, without distinction,\nThe three illuminations have their abode.\nVastly it reveals the wondrous Dharma,\nThe ten thousand paths of pure light unfold.\n\nWhat is emptied is already without,\nAnd the absence of absence is also without.\nThe heart comprehends its origin,\nThe nature recognizes its source—\nWhy cling to teachings of being and non-being?\nTeachings of being and non-being\nAre but provisional names.\nWithout provisional names,\nHow would the true heart be revealed?\nThus being arises from non-being.\nNon-being is not a doctrine of falling into emptiness,\nFor non-being is replete with being,\nAnd being is not exhausted by things.\nThus being and non-being are natural.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe ultimate secret is the pure and void Dao,\nClearly knowing the midst beyond things.\nGraceful, the radiance of the vast sky,\nResplendent, the brilliance of the azure void.\nThe cauldron shatters, the heart-pearl blazes,\nThe furnace opens, the sun of wisdom glows red.\nCinnabar and mercury congeal, settled,\nConveyed into the Palace of Broad Cold.\n\nThe absence of absence is already without—\nProfoundly still, ever tranquil.\nTo know emptiness is not empty,\nTo grasp being yet not be bound by being—\nThus the original nature is profoundly still, ever tranquil.\n\n*Ode:*\nProfoundly still, without flaw,\nTraversing the obscure, passing before the eyes like stars.\nHeaven and earth, vast and replete,\nThe cosmos, boundless and bright.\nThe nature awakens, the empty heart is still,\nThe spirit slumbers, free from dreams’ startling.\nSuddenly the ancient Dao opens,\nThe moon illumines the crystal city.\n\nStillness is not clung to as stillness—\nDesire, how could it arise?\nNot still, yet thus still—\nThus the celestial truth fills the eyes,\nThe wondrous Dao returns to its source.\nDesire, how could it arise?\n\n*Ode:*\nStillness casts all things aside,\nThe empty heart nurtures the vast.\nThe countenance is like the bright moon,\nThe azure eyes resemble a cold spring.\nLuminous, one returns to the true essence,\nDim, the Dharma-nature is purified.\nA pool of autumn water, limpid,\nTen thousand streams of pure waves, profound.\n\nDesire does not arise—\nThis is true stillness.\nDesire does not arise—\nPurifying the mind of myriad cares,\nAll desires vanish,\nStillness is without desire—\nDesire, how could it arise?\nTrue stillness—\nThe spirit’s light, empty and radiant,\nManifests numinous clarity,\nReturns to purity.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe pure heart connects with the sage,\nNon-action transforms into achievement.\nThe pearl congeals within the golden cauldron,\nThe treasure forms in the jade flask.\nBright as the sun in the sky,\nClear as the wind in the cave.\nVoid and serene, auspicious signs arise,\nLight envelops the Five Luminous Palaces.\n\nThe true and constant responds to things,\nThe true and constant attains its nature.\nAttaining its nature—\nThis is the true and constant wondrous Dao.\nResponding to things as they arise,\nFollowing conditions, one sees the nature,\nSeeing the nature, one understands emptiness—\nThus one attains one’s nature.\n\n*Ode:*\nTrue stillness—stillness without doubt,\nYang’s light illumines the dim eye.\nTreading the void, one fathoms wondrous principle,\nCircling, one reaches the profound mechanism.\nAll things respond to one another,\nYet in each case, one knows nothing.\nTurning to gaze—misty waves of green,\nLaughing, one points the way back to the grotto-heaven.\n\nEver-responsive, ever-still,\nEver pure and serene.\nEver-responsive—\nSeeing things, one sees the heart;\nSeeing the heart, one leaves things behind;\nLeaving things, one illumines emptiness—\nThus one attains the true and constant, fulfills one’s nature.\n\n*Ode:*\nPurity is the root and origin,\nWithin it, nature is spontaneous.\nThe two passes—essence dense and lush,\nThe one Way—qi flowing ceaselessly.\nMerging, one illumines true principle,\nCongealing, one awakens to the Great Mystery.\nIn emptiness, one knows there are images,\nIn response and transformation, one emerges from the primordial.\n\nSuch true stillness\nGradually enters the true Dao.\nThose who diligently practice true purity and true stillness\nAttain the wondrous principle of the subtle and formless,\nThe celestial truth beyond things.\nThus it is said: one gradually enters the true Dao.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe great Dao—cold, vast, and deep,\nDawn’s light illumines all heaven.\nOne clarity divides creation,\nTwo harmonies nurture the embryonic immortal.\nNature reaches, forgetting sorrow and suffering,\nThe heart connects, uniting with the natural.\nA touch opens the formless realm,\nReturning to the root, restoring the origin.\n\nHaving entered the true Dao,\nOne is called “attained the Dao.”\nThe Dao has no name in itself—\nA provisional name is given to the Dao.\nRecognizing the dharma of neither birth nor death,\nRefining the mortal into the sage,\nRefining the sage into the spirit,\nThe spirit merges with qi,\nQi communicates with the primordial origin—\nThis is called “attained the Dao.”\n\n*Ode:*\nAttaining the Dao—profound and distant,\nThe immortal’s wind spreads loftily through the world.\nThe nine heavens—one dwells in ease,\nThe three seas—one roams freely.\nDeeds fulfilled, the golden script confers,\nMerits accomplished, the jade register records.\nThe spirit ascends to the azure vault,\nSoaring steps traverse the cinnabar clouds.\n\nThough called “attained the Dao,”\nIn truth, there is nothing attained.\nUnderstanding yet not abiding,\nEmbodying function yet without form,\nTaking what is yet no-thing—\nThus it is said: in truth, there is nothing attained.\n\n*Ode:*\nDelusion—separated by a thousand mountains,\nAwakening—comes with not a single thing.\nTaking nothing—nothing to attain,\nAbandoning being—being lends support.\nBeing—what being remains?\nNon-being—even this is but a borrowed name.\nGazing at heaven, the great Dao is clear—\nA solitary wheel revealed in the open.\n\nFor the transformation of sentient beings,\nOne is called “attained the Dao.”\nA provisional name is given,\nTo transform those yet unawakened,\nA temporary teaching to verify fruition—\nThus it is said: in truth, there is nothing attained,\nYet in truth, there is cultivation.\n\n*Ode:*\nAttainment is not attainment,\nNon-cultivation is not cultivation.\nThe Dao, vast, embraces the ten thousand images,\nThe heart is not bound by a single thread.\nEarth’s po—leaps and soars in the void,\nHeaven’s hun—gathered from the ocean’s depths.\nThis is the true and ultimate treasure—\nWithout awakening, one’s life is spent in vain.\n\nThose who can awaken\nMay transmit the sagely Dao.\nThose who awaken to the true and constant Dao\nGather all hearts to return as one,\nTransforming endlessly,\nMoving in and out without obstruction—\nThus one illumines the sagely Dao.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe spirit’s clarity—heaven sighs in the bones,\nThe moon shines deep in the grotto abyss.\nSplit open—Jingshan’s jade revealed,\nBrandished—treasures overflow from the hidden vault.\nNaturally, one penetrates the sagely Dao,\nOnly then is the original heart made manifest.\nTransformations—boundless and unfathomable,\nThe spirit shifts into the great tone.\n\nThe Lord Lao said:\nThe superior person is free from contention.\nThe Most High declares: The person of supreme virtue dwells in the companionless vastness of the void, where the celestial and true wondrous Dao remains still and unmoving, without dispute or litigation.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe superior person knows Heaven’s mandate—\nhow could there be contention?\nThe elixir of the cinnabar field blooms,\nthe heart’s earth sprouts jade mushrooms.\nIn a quiet chamber, one sits at leisure,\nroaming freely through the clear void.\nThe numinous youth holds the moon’s treasure,\nthe spirit’s function attains its full brilliance.\n\nThe inferior person delights in contention.\nClinging to the arts of guiding teachings, they stir up self and others, competing in right and wrong, giving rise to disputes.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe inferior person delights in contention and force,\nseeking merit and fame to make themselves known.\nWhy trouble with manifest forms—\nbetter to treasure the concealment of light.\nClosing the eyes, one concentrates the spirit in stillness;\nopening them, one merges with the great sun.\nNaturally, one knows the ancient Dao,\nand the heart’s earth attains cool clarity.\n\nSupreme virtue is without virtue.\nSupreme virtue—note: In the Great Beginning, there are no images; the four limits are profoundly luminous. Knowing the heart is without heart, thus it is called \"supreme virtue without virtue.\"\n\n*Ode:*\nSupreme virtue awakens to non-virtue,\nwithout cultivation, one understands cultivation.\nThe Dao abides in the sea of perfect enlightenment,\nthe spirit is like a celestial boat.\nReaching the shore, one leaves birth and death;\nturning from the waves, one does not return to swim.\nFreely one departs beyond the void,\nreturning to one’s nature in the Isles of the Blessed.\n\nInferior virtue clings to virtue.\nThe person of inferior virtue clings to the arts of the lesser vehicle, enacting governance and affairs. Their virtue falls into emptiness—this is called \"non-virtue.\" Such views forever depart from the true Dao.\n\n*Ode:*\nInferior virtue enacts meritorious deeds,\nvainly seeking manifest rewards.\nMired in emptiness, sunk in delusion,\nclinging to illusions, one falls into the prison of yin.\nThe Great Beginning has no name,\nthe Mysterious Origin has its cultivation.\nTurning toward yang, one sees the sun—\nthe spirit and qi naturally harmonize and soften.\n\nThose who cling are not called virtuous.\nThe Dao is non-action, pure and still, profoundly tranquil.\nVirtue is the spirit’s myriad transformations,\nits essence and function abiding in constancy.\nDao and virtue blend as one—\ntheir principle is the same.\nThose who cling cling to all manner of contrived efforts.\n\n*Ode:*\nClinging obstructs the Dharma—it is not penetration;\nvainly one exhausts effort to no avail.\nContrived action deludes with false appearances,\nnon-action accords with true emptiness.\nIn the indistinct, the images of heaven and earth;\nin the obscure, the traces of the cosmos.\nThe Supreme Clarity enacts the great Dao—\nthe spirit’s function lies within.\n\nLiving beings fail to attain the true Dao because of deluded minds.\nThey do not attain the true Dao because they cling to all manner of guiding teachings.\nThe deluded mind seeks lesser methods,\nenacting governance and affairs,\nconstantly dwelling in the mind of delusion.\nThe true Dao is boundlessly transformative,\nresponding without separation,\nmost numinous and sagely—\nits principle is natural,\nnot clinging to views,\nnot employing deluded minds.\nThis is called purity and stillness,\ncutting off perverse views.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe great Dao is not distant—\nit is only obscured by the film of illusion.\nDeparting from the subtle, one inverts sagely wisdom;\npursuing things, one returns to demonic perversity.\nWhen the heart is still, all obstructions cease;\nwhen the spirit is clear, how could there be error?\nA single wheel of blazing sun,\nilluminates and shatters the cave’s clouds and mist.\n\nOnce there is a deluded mind, it startles the spirit.\nOnce the spirit is startled, the deluded mind arises—\nthe eyes see and the heart shifts,\nthe spirit does not abide in the wondrous.\nThe Scripture says: \"Constantly without desire, observe its mystery;\nconstantly with desire, observe its manifestations.\"\nOnce one observes its manifestations,\nthe spirit is startled.\n\n*Ode:*\nNot awakening to the original spirit,\nhow can one speak of a body beyond the body?\nDeluded conditions give rise to jealousy and ruin,\npursuing thoughts, anger and blame arise.\nForever losing the Dao of the Mysterious Origin,\nconstantly deluded by the primordial truth of the Great Antiquity.\nThough the sun and moon shine bright,\none’s eyes are filled with red dust.\n\nOnce the spirit is startled, one clings to the myriad things.\nNot abiding in the wondrous place,\nobserving things, one sinks into confusion and inversion,\nmired in the margins and boundaries.\n\n*Ode:*\nLife and death arise from pride and excess,\ntransmigration comes from attachment to emotion.\nDeluded conditions cause the heart to lose principle,\nbound to things, the Dao is hard to accomplish.\nDeparting from desire, one observes the clarity of emptiness;\nreturning to the true, the eye’s realm becomes bright.\nMoving without obstruction,\nthe heart’s ground is level and at peace.\n\nOnce one clings to the myriad things, desire and seeking arise.\nThe myriad Dharmas are not understood,\nbound by the myriad things,\nattached to things, emotions arise—\nendless craving and love.\n\n*Ode:*\nTurning toward things, blame and seeking arise,\ndeluded emotions grow daily more severe.\nThe heart has not abandoned fame and profit,\nwealth and sensuality are gathered within.\nThought after thought arises in dependence,\nrestlessly, one is not free.\nA life is vainly spent—\nhow can one awaken to clear vision?\n\nOnce desire and seeking arise, so too do afflictions.\nUnceasing desire and seeking bring affliction and sorrow,\nreturning to calamity and fault.\n\n*Ode:*\nCraving and love run deep in the six senses,\ndeluded emotions lead one into the forest of sins.\nAnxiety and sorrow should be dispelled early,\nafflictions should not be allowed to encroach.\nCultivate purity and stillness to refine body and life,\npractice non-action to temper the original heart.\nFixing the gaze, observe the vast heavens—\nbeyond things, one sees the clear tone.\n\nAfflictions and deluded thoughts bring sorrow to body and mind.\nReceiving contrived action, one labors without merit—\nthe body suffers, the heart is vexed,\nthe nature is disordered, the spirit scattered.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe greedy heart spurs a weak horse,\nthe unrestrained mind lets the monkey run wild.\nDeluded thoughts give rise to inversion,\nanxious striving brings bitter seeking.\nThe spirit is dull, clinging to things’ appearances;\nthe nature is benighted, following the flowing currents.\nTurning from awakening, the numinous and bright body—\ndeluded and sunk for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThus one suffers defilement and disgrace.\nBody and mind endure sorrow,\nmired in the turbidity of shame,\nenduring the confusion of the erring.\n\n*Ode:*\nPerverse lust brings bodily contact,\nturbidity and excess dull the heart’s emotions.\nNarrowing the eyes, one supports the pure and refined;\nraising the brows, one turns the azure pupils.\nSpreading the net, one gathers heaven and earth’s beauty;\nopening wide, the great abyss becomes clear.\nBlending the images of heaven and earth,\nthe yang essence shines in ten thousand streams.\n\nWandering in the cycle of life and death,\nthe heart is bound to things,\nturning from the correct to the perverse,\nflowing and wandering in life and death.\n\n*Ode:*\nWhen will life and death end?\nWhen will the wheel of transmigration cease?\nAbiding in the principle of purity and stillness,\none embraces the sun’s head from dawn.\nFilling the void, one hears the treasure’s weight;\nilluminating the great divine continent.\nConstantly sinking in the sea of suffering—\nthe awakened enter the sea of enlightenment,\nthe deluded enter the sea of suffering.\nThose who constantly sink are deluded by the true source,\nforever submerged in the sea of suffering.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe heart’s desires—passions without end,\nthe body like a leaky, broken boat.\nThe waters deep, escape is hard to find;\nlife and death ride the waves’ ebb and flow.\nThe shore so vast—how can one gather in?\nLife and death ride the waves,\nthe wheel of transmigration drifts with circumstance.\nDeluded, sinking into the sea of suffering,\nboth nature and life come to an end,\nforever losing the true Dao.\n\nFailing to grasp the ultimate principle,\nacting in chaos, seeking to do,\naccumulating skills and surpassing others,\ngalloping through empty dharmas—\none forever loses the true Dao.\n\n*Ode:*\nWithout discerning the true and constant Dao,\none seeks only what can be done.\nThe nature deluded, never settled,\nthe heart in turmoil, doubt arises.\nThe highest good is like clear water,\nthe numinous source vast and boundless.\nThe golden spring swells high,\noverflowing to illuminate the celestial pool.\n\nThe true and constant Dao—\nthe true and constant is daily use without trace,\nthus it is called the constant Dao.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe spirit’s function is most true and constant,\nilluminating the realm of virtue and power.\nThe jade crucible gathers white snow,\nthe golden tripod collects crimson frost.\nThe earth splits to reveal the seal of the heart,\nthe heavens open to flash the light of nature.\nThe numinous child returns to the ocean’s treasury,\nalone resting in the crystal hall.\n\nThe awakened attain it on their own—\nthose who attain it do not cultivate yet cultivate,\ndo not act yet act.\nThe awakened conceal the subtle mechanism in their gaze,\nilluminating the wondrous Dao,\npenetrating and manifesting true emptiness.\n\n*Ode:*\nWithdrawing the mind, turning the pupils,\nnaturally one sees the Dharma-body.\nMoving the celestial sun and moon,\nknocking on the Dao to illumine heaven and earth.\nThe radiance of the dragon pearl gleams,\nthe brilliance of amber glows deep.\nThe jade infant sleeps in the jeweled palace,\npristine and pure, beyond the red dust.\n\nThose who awaken to the Dao—\nthose who awaken open the eye of the Dao,\nfully comprehending non-action.\n\n*Ode:*\nKnowing the profound, penetrating the ancient Dao,\nawakening to the true and constant.\nLush and verdant, curling through the empty wilds,\nmist and haze fill the great firmament.\nThe sun’s soul shines like gleaming snow,\nthe moon’s essence illuminates silver frost.\nEmitting the spirit’s radiance in splendor,\nround and bright, one enters the native land.\n\nEver pure and still—\nheaven’s purity hangs with images,\nearth’s stillness brings peace and tranquility.\nIf one can be pure and still,\nthe spirit accords with the great Dao,\nabiding in the One, dwelling in constancy.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe mind still, awareness becomes clear,\nthe wind arrives before the bright moon.\nPearl-like dew descends from all the heavens,\nmercury levels the great earth.\nThe jade door reveals golden essence,\nthe golden gate manifests the jade infant.\nStriking open the handle of the celestial Dipper,\none ascends to the star of the great sun.\n\nThe immortal Ge Xuan said: \"I attained the true Dao and have recited this scripture ten thousand times. This scripture is practiced by heavenly beings and not transmitted to lesser scholars. I once received it from the Lord of Eastern Florescence, who received it from the Lord of the Golden Gates, who received it from the Queen Mother of the West. The Queen Mother of the West transmitted it orally, without written record. Now, in this world, I have written and recorded it.\n\nThe superior scholar who awakens to it ascends as an official of heaven; the middling scholar who awakens to it ranks among the immortals of the Southern Palace; the lesser scholar who attains it enjoys long years in the world, roaming the three realms, ascending through the golden gate.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Left Mystery said: \"Those who study the Dao and uphold this scripture will have the ten celestial good spirits protect them. Then, the jade talisman guards the spirit, the golden elixir refines the form, and both form and spirit become wondrous, uniting with the Dao in truth.\"\n\nThe Perfected of Orthodox Unity said: \"Households possessing this scripture, if they awaken to and understand it, will be free from calamities and obstacles. All sages will guard their gates, their spirits will ascend to the upper realms, and they will pay homage to the exalted ones. When merit is complete and virtue perfected, they will be received by the Lord Emperor. Those who recite and uphold it without retreat will ascend in purple clouds.\"\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao’s *Explication of the Scripture on Constant Purity and Stillness* concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness* (Part Four)**\n\n**Scripture Title:** *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness*\n**Commentary by:** Daoist Hou Shanyuan of the Jin Dynasty\n**One fascicle.**\n**Source of Base Text:** *Daoist Canon of the Zhengtong Era*, *Wondrous Writings* section, *Jade Instructions* category.\n\n---\n\n### **Preface to *The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness***\n\nBefore the source stirs, all streams are pure;\nBefore the wind fans, all things are still.\nYet when streams are muddied, the clear becomes turbid;\nWhen winds scatter, the still moves.\nSuch is the constant principle of things.\n\nThe Dao gives birth to the myriad beings, their nature inherently pristine—profoundly clear, utterly still, responsive and unobstructed. But when nature is swayed by emotion, losing its celestial truth, beings drift without return, sinking into the sea of suffering amid the cycles of birth and death. How pitiful!\n\nOut of boundless compassion and skillful means, the Supreme Lord guides the lost, restoring them to their original essence so they may behold the Dao. Though the Dao cannot be transmitted through words, how few are those who perceive it with a single glance? Though the Dao cannot be taught through images, the parable of \"forgetting the trap once the fish is caught\" suggests it still requires some support. Thus, this scripture was composed.\n\nThis scripture’s earnest teachings begin: \"Purity is the source of turbidity; stillness is the foundation of movement. If one can abide in constant purity and stillness, heaven and earth all return to them.\" It continues: \"The spirit delights in purity, yet the heart disturbs it; the heart delights in stillness, yet desires entangle it. If one can constantly dispel desires, the heart becomes still; if one clarifies the heart, the spirit becomes pure.\" Further, it states: \"Inwardly observe the heart—when the heart is no-heart; outwardly observe form—when form is no-form; distantly observe things—when things are no-things. Profoundly still, stillness without stillness—this is true stillness. Responding to things with true stillness, one gradually enters the true Dao.\" It concludes: \"Though called ‘attaining the Dao,’ there is in truth nothing attained. For the sake of transforming beings, it is called ‘attaining the Dao.’\" Is this not the great purport of this true scripture?\n\nSince the Queen Mother of the West bestowed it, immortals like Ge Xuan have transmitted it, and the Perfected of the Great Mystery praised it, generations have revered and upheld it. Yet how many fools remain dull their whole lives, how many deluded never awaken—how few live up to the Supreme Lord’s compassionate and skillful intent!\n\nNow, Master Hou of Mount Li is one who wanders beyond the mundane. Reflecting that those who comprehend this scripture’s words may transmit the sagely Dao, he has elucidated its meaning with commentary. His words are concise and easily understood; his principles are penetrating and easily practiced. Through them, one may:\n- Dispel desires and extinguish the Three Poisons;\n- Observe the mind and recognize emptiness;\n- Banish the deluded mind of attachment;\n- Admonish against the afflictions of craving.\n\nFollowing the sages’ works, he illuminates and clarifies. Within his text, he states:\n- \"Awakening without action is right; attaining through effort is wrong.\"\n- \"Within the great Dao there are no words; within words there is no great Dao. Celestial texts and jade instructions must be transmitted orally by a master.\"\n- \"Do not cling to emptiness as emptiness; do not fixate on being as being.\"\n- \"Embrace the radiant purity of the numinous flower; return to the light of oneness.\"\n\nIf scholars recite and uphold this scripture without retreat, they may attain the mystery of direct perception, not waiting until after \"forgetting the trap.\"\n\nRespectfully inscribed by Mao Hui, the Old Man of Pingshui.\n\n---\n\n### **The Supreme Lord Lao’s Explanation of the *Scripture of Constant Purity and Stillness***\n**Commentary by Hou Shanyuan, the Perfected of the Great Mystery of Mount Guye**\n\nThe Lord Lao said:\n**The great Dao is formless.**\nThat which is formless is the vast, boundless yang abyss—immeasurable and infinite, harmonizing heart and body, subtle and without limit. Thus, it is said the great Dao is formless.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe great Dao is originally formless,\nFormless is but a borrowed name.\nGazing, one finds no thing;\nListening closely, no sound remains.\nAwakened nature penetrates the profound and still;\nNurtured spirit pierces the eye’s clarity.\nThe great void has no companion,\nA solitary moon illumines Penglai’s isles.\n\n**It gives birth to and nurtures heaven and earth.**\nHeaven and earth possess form and image, all sustained by the Dao’s nurturance. Thus, it is said to give birth to and nurture heaven and earth.\n\n*Ode:*\nOne qi gives birth to heaven and earth,\nThe Three Luminaries within it reside.\nThe four seasons divide creation,\nThe myriad beings attain harmony.\nTo comprehend the Dharma of no-birth,\nKnow the heart’s exhaustion beyond things.\nThe utmost truth shines endlessly,\nEver in communion with the Dao.\n\n**The great Dao is without emotion.**\nThat the Dao is without emotion means it is profoundly non-manifest, utterly empty and without intent. The myriad beings are born and completed, spontaneously transforming without contrivance. Thus, it is said the great Dao is without emotion.\n\n*Ode:*\nWithout emotion, it pervades the great Dao,\nNurturing and sustaining, fundamentally without emotion.\nIt grasps the flourishing of heaven and earth,\nEncompasses the brightness of the cosmos.\nAbove, it pierces the Golden Gates’ realm;\nBelow, it penetrates the Nine Dark Realms.\nVast and boundless, unfathomable,\nMysteriously veiling the Jade Capital.\n\n**It moves the sun and moon.**\nThe sun and moon are the Dao’s numinous radiance, the lords of human and spirit. They circulate in all directions, universally illuminating without obscurity.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe great Dao clarifies the empty expanse,\nThe sun and moon at heaven’s edge endure.\nThey circulate throughout the boundless realm,\nAscending to traverse every region.\nManifesting the purity of the numinous flower,\nReturning to the light of oneness.\nThose who grasp this meaning,\nFind the immortal land close at hand.\n\n**The great Dao is without name.**\nThat which is nameless is the great Dao—penetrating the profound and subtle, the ultimate principle without end. The primordial qi of the undifferentiated origin existed before heaven and earth, inherently without name.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe Dao transforms the empty body,\nProvisionally given a borrowed name.\nWith a name, yet no form;\nWithout things, yet no shape.\nAbove, it illumines the Three Heavens;\nHorizontally, it bears the Four Seas’ brightness.\nUnfolding the eye of purity and stillness,\nIt soars like a shooting star.\n\n**It nurtures the myriad beings.**\nThe great Dao, vast and formless, profoundly still and unmoving, luminous and pure, covers and shelters heaven and earth, moves the sun and moon, flows through rivers, grasps mountains and streams, contains valleys and ravines, overflows gardens and groves, ripens the five grains, and brings forth the blossoming of flowers and fruits.",

      "translated_text": "All the myriad beings are born by receiving the Dao’s qi, inherently acting without contrivance, transforming spontaneously in response to the seasons. The Dao is originally formless, yet nurtures the formed. Thus it is said to nurture the myriad beings.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe Dao transforms the teeming multitudes,\nSpontaneously giving life to things.\nMist and radiance span ten thousand leagues,\nLush beauty illumines a thousand mountains.\nVerdant fields stretch through ravines,\nPure sounds echo beneath the azure sky.\nAwakening to this land of true blessing,\nHere the flying immortals conceal themselves.\nI know not its name.\n\nThe Most High said: I know not the name of this,\nFor it abides alone without hindrance,\nA mechanism of supreme truth and mystery,\nWithout birth or extinction, without increase or decrease,\nConcealing and revealing without fixed direction.\nAs sentient beings fail to awaken,\nThe Most High, in compassion, provisionally established a name.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe wondrous Dao is hard to awaken to,\nYet when the mind opens, wisdom becomes numinous.\nThe original spirit grows from a firm root,\nThe empty valley bears perfect clarity.\nThe sea’s depths congeal radiant pearls,\nThe mountain’s summit blends the sun’s essence.\nThe sky is filled with the dawn’s precious mirror,\nIts light illumining the Jade Capital.\n\nForcibly called the Dao.\nThe Dao is originally nameless.\nOnce given a name, it attaches to forms;\nIf one acts without mind, one dies into hollow emptiness.\nBeing and non-being give rise to each other,\nDarkness and obscurity stand in opposition.\nResponding to things, it manifests form,\nYet in daily use, it is never apart.\n\nHard to distinguish from the teachings of the true Dharma,\nIt is forcibly called the Dao.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe Dao is originally beyond words,\nYet forcibly named to distinguish it.\nWhen the mind is clear, refined qi congeals,\nWhen nature is still, numinous clouds gather.\nA fresh wind rises over the sea,\nAn ancient moon appears at the sky’s edge.\nIn emptiness, self and things become clear,\nThe ten thousand images are all embraced.\n\nNow, the Dao possesses both clarity and turbidity.\nThat which is clear is vast, empty, and open,\nThe spirit-valley silent and void,\nA single qi harmoniously surging—\nThus it is called clarity.\nThat which is turbid encompasses the myriad beings,\nNothing it does not contain,\nNothing it does not enter,\nPermeating the world,\nPenetrating even the finest hair—\nThus it is said to possess both clarity and turbidity.\n\n*Ode:*\nClarity and turbidity determine floating and sinking,\nYin and yang operate through ancient and modern times.\nThe sky hangs with jade-like images,\nThe earth produces forests of precious trees.\nLeaning in clarity upon the Cao Stream’s path,\nThe spirit congeals in the depths of the Dharma sea.\nOnly by understanding this principle\nCan the heart of the Dao-person be revealed.\n\nThere is movement and stillness.\nStillness is the great Dao, silent and without mind.\nMovement is the spirit’s function, responding and penetrating the mysterious.\nIn the interplay of movement and stillness,\nThe true Dao may be realized.\n\n*Ode:*\nMovement and stillness expand the Dao’s reach,\nThe divine elixir shoots toward the sun.\nThe celestial soul gathers at the Kan position,\nThe earthly soul enters the Li region.\nFrom the sea’s depths, the dragon churns waves,\nOn the mountain’s summit, the tiger battles the azure.\nCaptured and returned to the vast realm,\nLife and nature attain extension.\n\nHeaven is clear, earth is turbid.\nHeaven’s clarity is the primordial qi,\nFilling and surging through emptiness,\nProfoundly distant and utterly deep.\nEarth’s turbidity gives rise to humanity,\nNothing it does not cultivate,\nNothing it does not harvest,\nBearing the filth of the myriad people—\nThus it is said that heaven is clear and earth is turbid.\n\n*Ode:*\nEarth’s qi reaches the azure sky,\nClear heaven fills the four directions.\nWithin lie buried ancient traces,\nAbove and below, new light transcends.\nThose who attain return to the true path,\nSilently entering the Dao’s realm.\nThe jade infant ascends the jeweled hall,\nGazing afar at the Miluo River.\n\nHeaven moves, earth is still.\nMovement and stillness: heaven is round, earth is square,\nThus naturally giving rise to a thousand changes and ten thousand transformations,\nThe stars shift, the Dipper turns,\nOperating the pivot of the axis.\nEarth’s stillness: wind stirs the waves,\nStupidly enduring defilement without contention—\nThus it is said that heaven moves and earth is still.\n\n*Ode:*\nEarth is still, inherently without contrivance,\nThe celestial pivot follows the Dipper’s handle.\nCreation arises without fabrication,\nTransformation unfolds with numinous mechanism.\nGazing afar, the autumn moon is bright,\nFocusing the eyes, the sun’s radiance gleams.\nA single yang is gathered into the crucible,\nAdvancing the fire to nurture the spirit-turtle.\n\nMan is clear, woman is turbid.\nMan is yang; woman is yin.\nThus they are called true yin and true yang.\nThis does not refer to worldly men and women,\nFor they are seen when not in use,\nAnd not seen when in use.\nThus the *Virtue Classic* says:\nThe myriad beings all bear yin and embrace yang.\nExternally yang, internally yin.\nExternally, the body;\nInternally, the heart and nature.\nWhy is this so?\nEven in cultivating practitioners:\nIf the body is still, is this not man’s clarity?\nIf the heart and nature are disturbed and restless,\nIs this not woman’s turbidity?\n\n*Ode:*\nThings may be still, yet the heart is not,\nThe body may be clear, yet nature is not.\nDeluded by truth, doubting the indistinct,\nWith scattered intent, how can there be peace?\nReturning the light to the golden crucible,\nReversing the gaze into the precious vase.\nClearly opening the Dao’s eye,\nWhy worry about not attaining perfection?\n\nMan moves, woman is still.\nMan’s movement is not governed by sexual union.\nMovement is instability; stillness is stability.\nThus movement arises from the yang Dao,\nLike parting clouds to reveal the sun,\nPolishing a mirror to attain clarity.\nThus yin returns to yang—\nThis is called man’s movement.\nWoman’s stillness means the yang Dao opens naturally,\nThe spirit transforms into emptiness and clarity,\nWithout licentiousness or deviance,\nWithout hatred or love,\nWithout greed or anger,\nWithout jealousy or envy,\nWithout arising or thought,\nWithout delusion or imagination—\nIs this not woman’s stillness?\n\nIt is also said:\nWithin Li, emptiness; within Kan, fullness.\nClearly taking the fullness within Kan to transform the emptiness within Li—\nThis is the method of inverting yin and yang,\nThe practice of returning to pure yang.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe method of inverting yin and yang,\nWithin the furnace, gathering mercury and lead.\nClear light shines upon the earth,\nCrimson flames burst through the cosmos.\nThe white tiger reclines in the pool,\nThe green dragon sleeps within the fire.\nRefining into the true jade countenance,\nBeyond the body, the fetal immortal dances.\n\nDescending from the root to the branches, giving rise to the myriad beings.\nDescending from the root is the origin of the branches.\nVirtue and the Dao are the root,\nA single qi surging through emptiness,\nIssuing forth the principle of spontaneity.\nThe myriad beings attain their root,\nNurtured without withering,\nBranches and leaves flourishing.\nHumans attain their root,\nThe spirit numinous and unfathomable,\nManifesting without fixed direction.\n\n*Ode:*\nDescending from the root, harmonious and elegant,\nFollowing the mechanism, things arise spontaneously.",
      "overlap_context": "ns;\nHorizontally, it bears the Four Seas’ brightness.\nUnfolding the eye of purity and stillness,\nIt soars like a shooting star.\n\n**It nurtures the myriad beings.**\nThe great Dao, vast and formless, profoundly still and unmoving, luminous and pure, covers and shelters heaven and earth, moves the sun and moon, flows through rivers, grasps mountains and streams, contains valleys and ravines, overflows gardens and groves, ripens the five grains, and brings forth the blossoming of flowers and fruits.",

      "translated_text": "Two crimson mists arise,\nA single thread of pale smoke pours forth.\nThe tiger drinks the golden crow’s marrow,\nThe dragon swallows the jade hare’s essence.\nThese two are the true and supreme treasures—\nThose who awaken become spiritually numinous.\n\nThe clear is the source of the turbid.\nWhen water is clear, the abyss reflects with luminous clarity,\nIts form naturally manifest,\nDistinct from the turbid.\nThis wellspring of clarity is likened to the practitioner.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe heart’s abyss shines with bottomless clarity,\nThe Dao’s stillness mirrors the primordial throughway.\nThe jade gate overflows with yang essence,\nThe golden pass surges with boundless qi.\nIn harmony, they gather at the Kan palace,\nIn union, they are sent to the Li chamber.\nOnly then does the mysterious pearl descend,\nSoaring heavenward, radiant as the sun.\n\nStillness is the foundation of movement.\nStillness is the Dao, the great void of emptiness.\nThe spirit, in its function, enters and exits without obstruction,\nMerging with the profound and obscure as one body.\nThus it is called the foundation of movement.\n\n*Ode:*\nSilent and empty, nothing remains,\nThe spirit and the Dao’s essence are one.\nThe heavens clear, azure waves surge,\nThe earth still, crimson ripples well.\nThe four images bore through the furnace’s mouth,\nThe five phases enter the crucible.\nRefined, the elixir glows crimson,\nConsumed, one awakens to ascend the immortal palace.\n\nIf one can remain perpetually clear and still,\nThe heavens are ever clear and still—\nSun, moon, and stars gleam white in empty brightness.\nWhen humans remain clear and still,\nEssence, qi, and spirit settle, never scattering.\nThus it is said: one can remain perpetually clear and still.\n\n*Ode:*\nFree from the stains of desire,\nCut off from the red dust’s comings and goings.\nThe light of nature soars like the bright sun,\nThe heart’s ground floats in the vast sky.\nA single qi refines the primordial image,\nThe twin passes temper the subtle.\nSpirit and essence pierce the cosmos,\nRadiance shimmering across the three thousand realms.\n\nHeaven and earth all return.\nWhen one is clear and still,\nThe spirit’s wondrous principle ascends into non-action,\nEncompassing heaven and earth,\nPenetrating even the tiniest speck of dust.\nThus it is said: heaven and earth all return.\n\n*Ode:*\nAbiding in stillness, dwelling in non-action,\nNon-action attains the wondrous mechanism.\nThe toad palace races with the jade hare,\nThe sun’s hall hastens with the crow’s flight.\nFlaring forth a thousand dazzling lights,\nBursting open ten thousand radiant forms.\nEncompassing all appearances,\nHeaven and earth all return.\n\nThe human spirit favors clarity, yet emotions disturb it.\nThe human spirit—heaven and earth’s refined qi,\nCongealed into luminous brightness—\nIs inherently clear and still,\nYet follows things to generate emotions,\nClinging to dust and attracting defilement.\nThus it is said: emotions disturb it.\n\n*Ode:*\nWealth and rank veil the heart’s eye,\nGlory and splendor blind the vision with dust.\nThough one may gaze upon sun and moon,\nThe original truth remains unseen.\nSerene and profound, nurturing the primordial nature,\nLimpid and empty, refining the supreme spirit.\nThe numinous youth opens the azure peaks,\nThe immortal maiden rides the qilin.\n\nThe human heart favors stillness, yet desires entangle it.\nThe heart is the spirit’s illumination—\nInwardly known as nature,\nOutwardly manifest as spirit.\nThe spirit is inherently clear and still,\nYet swayed by winds, it becomes disordered,\nMoved by things, desires entangle it.\n\n*Ode:*\nEyes open, the celestial jades are revealed,\nYet the human heart strays where it clings.\nClinging to emotions, desires disturb,\nChasing scenes, scenes follow in turn.\nEmbracing simplicity, penetrating the pure and refined,\nThe singular true refines the myriad images,\nMerging with the great abyss in equality.\n\nIf one can constantly dispel desires, the heart naturally stills.\nTo dispel desires is to sever attachments, leave loved ones,\nEliminate emotions, abandon cravings,\nCast aside thoughts, forsake scheming—\nThen nature is naturally still, the heart serene.\n\n*Ode:*\nEver steadfast in guarding stillness,\nThe square inch nurtures the spirit’s numinosity.\nClosing the door, the golden child sleeps,\nLowering the curtain, the jade infant is embraced.\nMysterious frost refines the supreme treasure,\nPurple powder tempers true emotion.\nThe radiant mysterious pearl is formed,\nGathered to offer to the Supreme Clarity.\n\nWhen the heart is settled, the spirit naturally clarifies.\nCalming the heart, stabilizing the intent,\nProfoundly still and limpidly clear,\nReturning to the root, reverting to the origin—\nLike water undisturbed.\nThus it is said: when the heart is settled, the spirit naturally clarifies.\n\n*Ode:*\nTo know the spirit’s source,\nRecognize emptiness before your eyes.\nThe heart-moon shines with limpid clarity,\nThe nature-light glows in perfect roundness.\nQi flourishes, connecting to the divine and sagely,\nThe spirit’s wind transforms into feathered immortals.\nCarefree, returning to the island in the sea,\nAlone, spanning the three realms.\n\nNaturally, the six desires do not arise.\nThe six desires are the eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and intent.\n\"Not arising\" means:\nThe eyes behold no colors, the spirit does not stray in sight;\nThe ears hear no sounds, voice and form go unheard;\nThe nose’s breath is harmonious, neither fragrance nor stench admitted;\nThe tongue savors no flavors, neither sour nor sweet relished;\nThe intent embraces heaven’s truth, not deluded by external scenes.\nThus it is said: the six desires return to truth, naturally not arising.\n\n*Ode:*\nReturning to truth, eliminating the six harms,\nExhausting leaks, escaping the three calamities.\nRecognizing nature, the mysterious path opens,\nKnowing the heart, the Dao’s eye awakens.\nThe wooden man roams the vast heavens,\nThe stone maiden plays on the immortal steps.\nAs the sun sets on a clear autumn night,\nAt the sky’s edge, the moon is embraced.\n\nThe three poisons are extinguished.\nThe three poisons are bodily karma, mental karma, and verbal karma.\n\"Extinguished\" means:\nNurturing essence, qi, and spirit with goodness,\nEradicating greed, anger, and jealousy.\nThus it is said: the three poisons are extinguished.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe six desires become a golden treasury,\nThe three calamities transform into precious pearls.\nThe seven emotions remain unstained,\nThe ten evils forever dissolved.\nWiping clean the ice terrace, it gleams,\nIts radiance neither furled nor unfurled.\nEmbraced, one roams the earthly realm,\nAlone, stepping into the clear void.\n\nThose who cannot do so—\nFail to eliminate emotions and desires in cultivating the Dao,\nTheir hearts clinging to something.\n\n*Ode:*\nUnable to practice this path,\nNature reverts, doubts arise.\nSitting in meditation exhausts heart and strength,\nInvestigating Chan strains the spleen.\nStanding and walking lack distinction,\nSitting and lying ever follow.\nTo see the opening of the clear eye,\nThe spirit’s light fills the chamber.\n\nFor the heart is not settled—\nThe heart-nature unsettled, disturbances abound.\nThe spirit wanders external scenes,\nGazing at the subtle, clinging to things.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe highest good’s heart is an abyss,\nLimpid and clear, reflecting the azure heavens.\nWorldly emotions bring much suffering,\nPeople are bound by karmic conditions.\nChasing waves, the true nature is deluded,\nFollowing ripples, the root is obscured.\nA single spirit returns to the bitter sea,\nTen thousand kalpas without return.\n\nDesires are not dispelled—\nA lifetime unaltered, things turn the heart.\n\n*Ode:*\nCultivating illusions, applying effort in vain,\nDiverging from the true matter.\nConditioned actions are like shadows,\nClinging to forms like drifting winds.\nThings are borrowed, the heart is not;\nThe body is empty, nature is not.",

      "translated_text": "A single spirit knows its master,\nAnd the ten thousand dharmas all become clear.\nThe one who can dispel them\nTurns amidst the ten thousand things,\nThe heart abides in formlessness,\nNurturing the spirit in the wondrous.\n\n*Ode:*\nNurturing the heart, one grasps the sage’s mechanism,\nWithout form, it equals the void in equilibrium.\nRippling waves grow still,\nThe sunlit abyss stretches boundless.\nFlowing through all realms,\nRoaming with the power of the great spirit.\nThe moon illumines the cosmos with clarity,\nA pure wind escorts one home.\n\nInwardly observe the heart—\nThe heart has no heart.\nReturn to observe the heart—\nSilent, it is without heart.\nThis heart,\nWhen the eyes open, the void is clear,\nReveals the true heart.\nThe true heart,\nProfound and still, without thing,\nMerges with the sun in pure oneness.\nThus is it named the heart.\n\n*Ode:*\nReturning the light, one sees the heart of heaven,\nPerfect and bright, deep as the limpid azure.\nThe form of true reality is neither non-being,\nNor can being be sought.\nMountains and seas offer no obstruction,\nHeavenly disasters and misfortunes cannot invade.\nWho is the true person’s companion?\nThe wind and moon are their confidants.\n\nOutwardly observe the form—\nThe form has no form.\nForm is earth, water, fire, and wind.\nThis is called the body of outflows.\nThe body not of outflows\nIs thus the true without form.\nThe true without form\nIs like gazing at the moon in water,\nLike the sky turning with pure wind,\nSpirit congealed, qi gathered—\nThus may the true Dao be attained.\n\n*Ode:*\nOutwardly observing the form of outflows,\nIllusion transforms into true form.\nDeparture and abiding leave no trace,\nSerene, without the slightest pause.\nWithin, all is indistinct,\nInward and outward, dark and profound.\nMelting like ice about to dissolve,\nThe depths of the sea of awakening grow clear.\n\nObserve things from afar—\nThings have no thing.\nWithin and without, all is empty—\nWhat then remains at a distance?\nThis is the absence of things.\nWithin the absence of things,\nThere is another wondrous thing.\nThe sutra says: *Dimly, dimly, faintly—*\n*Within it, there is a thing.*\nThus it is said: *Things have no thing.*\n\n*Ode:*\nVast and boundless, the indistinct,\nWithin the crucible, scenes are fine.\nThe furnace door pours forth jade medicine,\nThe cauldron’s eye brims with golden blossoms.\nTigers encircle the luminous pearl in play,\nDragons spew ten thousand miles of rosy clouds.\nParting the clouds and mist to gaze,\nOne cradles the night-shining sand.\n\nHaving awakened to these three—\nThese three are heart, form, and thing,\nWhich are but emptiness.\nAwakening is comprehension.\n\n*Ode:*\nA metaphor speaks of three bodies,\nYet the profound is one, without duality.\nBeing and non-being are both illusions,\nWithout care, the Dao lends support.\nThe Dharma-eye is the elixir cauldron,\nThe Gate of Heaven is the medicine furnace.\nRefining, cinnabar and mercury congeal,\nPoured into a single crystal flask.\n\nOnly the void is seen.\nWithin, without, and between—\nAll is unattached,\nPerfectly bright, vast and unobstructed,\nThe heart enters non-action.\nThus it is said: *Only the void is seen.*\n\n*Ode:*\nObserving emptiness is not form,\nFor form is true emptiness.\nSelf and things both forgotten,\nOnly then does one know the primordial unity.\nCircling endlessly without cessation,\nCounting exhaustively without limit.\nThe heavenly net is vast,\nThe net of the profound covers all.\n\nObserve emptiness—emptiness too is empty.\nObserving emptiness,\nThe Dao is vast, without form,\nThe ten thousand dharmas are without shape.\nEmptiness too is empty—\nSpirit’s wondrous transformations,\nThe one body returns to the true.\n\n*Ode:*\nRadiant, it cleanses the clear sky,\nThe spirit roams the four seas.\nVast and obscure, it pervades heaven and earth,\nIndistinct, it merges with the great void.\nThe moon gleams in the azure night,\nThe wind drifts through the emerald firmament.\nFreely it traverses above and below,\nNorth and south, east and west.\n\nEmptiness is not clung to as emptiness.\nEmptiness is not grasped,\nFor emptiness does not attach to being.\nBeing and the heart are one—\nWithin the Supreme Ultimate,\nMystery gathers in the wondrous.\n\n*Ode:*\nBoundless, without corner,\nDarkly, transformation operates in the void.\nWithout form, it is called the great Dao,\nBeyond form, it is named true suchness.\nOne body, without distinction,\nThe three illuminations have their abode.\nVastly it reveals the wondrous Dharma,\nThe ten thousand paths of pure light unfold.\n\nWhat is emptied is already without,\nAnd the absence of absence is also without.\nThe heart comprehends its origin,\nThe nature recognizes its source—\nWhy cling to teachings of being and non-being?\nTeachings of being and non-being\nAre but provisional names.\nWithout provisional names,\nHow would the true heart be revealed?\nThus being arises from non-being.\nNon-being is not a doctrine of falling into emptiness,\nFor non-being is replete with being,\nAnd being is not exhausted by things.\nThus being and non-being are natural.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe ultimate secret is the pure and void Dao,\nClearly knowing the midst beyond things.\nGraceful, the radiance of the vast sky,\nResplendent, the brilliance of the azure void.\nThe cauldron shatters, the heart-pearl blazes,\nThe furnace opens, the sun of wisdom glows red.\nCinnabar and mercury congeal, settled,\nConveyed into the Palace of Broad Cold.\n\nThe absence of absence is already without—\nProfoundly still, ever tranquil.\nTo know emptiness is not empty,\nTo grasp being yet not be bound by being—\nThus the original nature is profoundly still, ever tranquil.\n\n*Ode:*\nProfoundly still, without flaw,\nTraversing the obscure, passing before the eyes like stars.\nHeaven and earth, vast and replete,\nThe cosmos, boundless and bright.\nThe nature awakens, the empty heart is still,\nThe spirit slumbers, free from dreams’ startling.\nSuddenly the ancient Dao opens,\nThe moon illumines the crystal city.\n\nStillness is not clung to as stillness—\nDesire, how could it arise?\nNot still, yet thus still—\nThus the celestial truth fills the eyes,\nThe wondrous Dao returns to its source.\nDesire, how could it arise?\n\n*Ode:*\nStillness casts all things aside,\nThe empty heart nurtures the vast.\nThe countenance is like the bright moon,\nThe azure eyes resemble a cold spring.\nLuminous, one returns to the true essence,\nDim, the Dharma-nature is purified.\nA pool of autumn water, limpid,\nTen thousand streams of pure waves, profound.\n\nDesire does not arise—\nThis is true stillness.\nDesire does not arise—\nPurifying the mind of myriad cares,\nAll desires vanish,\nStillness is without desire—\nDesire, how could it arise?\nTrue stillness—\nThe spirit’s light, empty and radiant,\nManifests numinous clarity,\nReturns to purity.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe pure heart connects with the sage,\nNon-action transforms into achievement.\nThe pearl congeals within the golden cauldron,\nThe treasure forms in the jade flask.\nBright as the sun in the sky,\nClear as the wind in the cave.\nVoid and serene, auspicious signs arise,\nLight envelops the Five Luminous Palaces.\n\nThe true and constant responds to things,\nThe true and constant attains its nature.\nAttaining its nature—\nThis is the true and constant wondrous Dao.\nResponding to things as they arise,\nFollowing conditions, one sees the nature,\nSeeing the nature, one understands emptiness—\nThus one attains one’s nature.",

Knowing the heart is without heart, thus it is called \"supreme virtue without virtue.\"\n\n*Ode:*\nSupreme virtue awakens to non-virtue,\nwithout cultivation, one understands cultivation.\nThe Dao abides in the sea of perfect enlightenment,\nthe spirit is like a celestial boat.\nReaching the shore, one leaves birth and death;\nturning from the waves, one does not return to swim.\nFreely one departs beyond the void,\nreturning to one’s nature in the Isles of the Blessed.\n\nInferior virtue clings to virtue.\nThe person of inferior virtue clings to the arts of the lesser vehicle, enacting governance and affairs.

emotion.\nDeluded conditions cause the heart to lose principle,\nbound to things, the Dao is hard to accomplish.\nDeparting from desire, one observes the clarity of emptiness;\nreturning to the true, the eye’s realm becomes bright.\nMoving without obstruction,\nthe heart’s ground is level and at peace.\n\nOnce one clings to the myriad things, desire and seeking arise.\nThe myriad Dharmas are not understood,\nbound by the myriad things,\nattached to things, emotions arise—\nendless craving and love.\n\n*Ode:*\nTurning toward things, blame and seeking arise,\ndeluded emotions grow daily more severe.\nThe heart has not abandoned fame and profit,\nwealth and sensuality are gathered within.\nThought after thought arises in dependence,\nrestlessly, one is not free.\nA life is vainly spent—\nhow can one awaken to clear vision?\n\nOnce desire and seeking arise, so too do afflictions.\nUnceasing desire and seeking bring affliction and sorrow,\nreturning to calamity and fault.\n\n*Ode:*\nCraving and love run deep in the six senses,\ndeluded emotions lead one into the forest of sins.\nAnxiety and sorrow should be dispelled early,\nafflictions should not be allowed to encroach.\nCultivate purity and stillness to refine body and life,\npractice non-action to temper the original heart.\nFixing the gaze, observe the vast heavens—\nbeyond things, one sees the clear tone.\n\nAfflictions and deluded thoughts bring sorrow to body and mind.\nReceiving contrived action, one labors without merit—\nthe body suffers, the heart is vexed,\nthe nature is disordered, the spirit scattered.\n\n*Ode:*\nThe greedy heart spurs a weak horse,\nthe unrestrained mind lets the monkey run wild.\nDeluded thoughts give rise to inversion,\nanxious striving brings bitter seeking.\nThe spirit is dull, clinging to things’ appearances;\nthe nature is benighted, following the flowing currents.\nTurning from awakening, the numinous and bright body—\ndeluded and sunk for ten thousand kalpas.\n\nThus one suffers defilement and disgrace.\nBody and mind endure sorrow,\nmired in the turbidity of shame,\nenduring the confusion of the erring.\n\n*Ode:*\nPerverse lust brings bodily contact,\nturbidity and excess dull the heart’s emotions.\nNarrowing the eyes, one supports the pure and refined;\nraising the brows, one turns the azure pupils.\nSpreading the net, one gathers heaven and earth’s beauty;\nopening wide, the great abyss becomes clear.\nBlending the images of heaven and earth,\nthe yang essence shines in ten thousand streams.\n\nWandering in the cycle of life and death,\nthe heart is bound to things,\nturning from the correct to the perverse,\nflowing and wandering in life and death.\n\n*Ode:*\nWhen will life and death end?\nWhen will the wheel of transmigration cease?\nAbiding in the principle of purity and stillness,\none embraces the sun’s head from dawn.\nFilling the void, one hears the treasure’s weight;\nilluminating the great divine continent.\nConstantly sinking in the sea of suffering—\nthe awakened enter the sea of enlightenment,\nthe deluded enter the sea of suffering.\nThose who constantly sink are deluded by the true source,\nforever submerged in the sea of suffering.",
