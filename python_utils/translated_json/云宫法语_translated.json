  "full_translation": "**Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses**\n\n*Scripture Title:* Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses. Compiled by Wang Kesun of the Yuan Dynasty. Two scrolls. Source text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Preface to Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses**\n\nAll forms decay, yet only the Dao alone is imperishable. Man dwells between Heaven and Earth as the vessel of this Dao. There is fate, and there is nature—what Heaven decrees is called nature, and following nature is called the Dao. There is no second Dao in the world; how could there be two natures or two fates? The subtleties of \"refining the essence to unify the mind\" were seen in the Great Shun’s admonitions to Yu. The constancy of nature, the cultivation of nature, the illumination of nature, and the restraint of nature were expounded in the maxims of Tang’s Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou. The Master praised the *Book of Changes*, saying: \"Each rectifies its nature and fate.\" Thus, nature and fate are spoken of together. Yet observe how the Master rarely spoke of fate and benevolence, and the nature and the Way of Heaven could not be heard. The study of nature and fate is not something the shallowly learned can fully comprehend.\n\nThrough the transmission from Zengzi, Zisi, and Mencius, the learning of nature and fate became ever more manifest and detailed. The Confucians took nurturing nature and following nature as their priority, and knowing fate and establishing fate as their duty. Thus, their merit reached the utmost in assisting transformation and nurturing life, and they participated in the work of Heaven and Earth. The Daoists and Buddhists, in clarifying the mind and perceiving nature, cultivating fate and returning to fate, attain the wondrous existence of true emptiness and merge with the Dao in truth. The learning of nature and fate in Daoism and Buddhism cannot be extinguished either.\n\nIn later ages, corruption arose: Confucians used literary arts to trade for rank and salary, while Daoists and Buddhists employed fortune and misfortune to deceive the foolish and mediocre. In the practice of personal conduct, few adhered to the true path of nature and fate. Moreover, the Three Bonds and Five Constants are the great origin of the Dao; if the decrees of Heaven and the norms of the people are not fully realized, how can this be called the Dao?\n\nIn this sagely and enlightened dynasty, the ruler and teachers act as exemplars. Our Confucian Way is ever more revered and encouraged, while the two traditions of Daoism and Buddhism are not abolished but honored and rewarded, with the hope that all under Heaven may return to the Dao. In this era of grand harmony and flourishing governance, where the household of Ji and the people of Gao Yao abound, and the supreme enlightenment of Śākyamuni and the efficacy of Laozi’s teachings prevail, those who discourse on nature and fate have multiplied. Yet they have not grasped the essential unity of these teachings.\n\nI have imitated the classics and compiled these discourses by category. The Confucian Way is attained through rectifying the mind and sincerity of intention, and the Ways of the Buddha and Laozi are likewise attained through rectifying the mind and sincerity of intention. When human desires are entirely purified and the principles of Heaven flow freely, even a single thought unarisen reveals the great mechanism of the entire being. Transforming into the sagely and spiritual—apart from this, it is not what I call the Dao, nor what I call nature and fate. I name this collection *Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses*. Daoist texts speak of resting in the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, which is the time of \"fasting the mind\" and \"sitting in forgetfulness.\" In thoroughly investigating this Dao, one may gaze ahead and behind without finding a moment otherwise—standing upright without shame, bowing without remorse. How could nature and fate merely signify emptiness and nothingness?\n\nAutumn of the *wuxu* year of the Dade era,\nPreface by Wang Kesun of Jishui, the Recluse of Empty Serenity.\n\n**Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses, Scroll One**\nCompiled by Wang Kesun of Jishui, the Recluse of Empty Serenity\n\n**Chapter One: The Primordial Heaven**\n\nAt the origin before Heaven and Earth divided, there existed *Taiyi* (Supreme Simplicity), *Taichu* (Supreme Beginning), *Taishi* (Supreme Commencement), and *Taisu* (Supreme Simplicity of Substance).\n*Taiyi* is that in which qi has yet to appear.\n*Taichu* is the beginning of qi.\n*Taishi* is the beginning of form.\n*Taisu* is the beginning of substance.\nWhen qi, form, and substance are complete yet not yet separated, this is called *hundun* (primordial chaos).\nOnce *hundun* divides, Heaven and Earth open.\n\nThe *Laozi* states: *\"There is a thing, chaotic yet complete, born before Heaven and Earth.\"*\nThe *Daoist Scriptures* say: *\"The Supreme Perfection, the Boundless Great Dao.\"*\nThe *Scripture of Salvation* states: *\"Above, there is no further ancestor—only the Dao as its body,\"* and also: *\"The Primordial Ancestral Qi.\"*\nZhou Dunyi says: *\"The Ultimateless and yet the Supreme Ultimate,\"* and also: *\"The true reality of the Ultimateless.\"*\nShao Yong remarks: *\"If one speaks of the prior Heaven, there is not a single thing.\"*\nMaster Cheng says: *\"What is above the state of human birth and stillness cannot be described. The Ultimateless cannot be spoken of, nor can it be named by any form or category—once you speak of it, it is no longer so.\"*\n\n**Heavenly Chapter the First**\nThe *Book of Changes* states: *\"In the Supreme Ultimate there is the Taiyi, which generates the Two Modes. The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams.\"*\nClosing the door is called *Kun* (Earth); opening the door is called *Qian* (Heaven). The alternation of closing and opening is called *change*.\n*Qian* is the yang entity; *Kun* is the yin entity.\n*Qian* is Heaven and called Father; *Kun* is Earth and called Mother. Yin and yang unite their powers, and hardness and softness take form, embodying the configurations of Heaven and Earth. This is what is meant by *\"the alternation of yin and yang is called the Dao.\"*\nThus it is said: *\"Essence and qi become things.\"*\n\nZhou Dunyi says: *\"The essence of the Two and Five, wondrously united and congealed.\"*\nThe two qi interact and transform, giving birth to the myriad things, endlessly generating and transforming.\nThe *Guliang Commentary* states: *\"Neither yin alone nor yang alone can generate—only their union brings forth life.\"*\nThe *Plain Questions* says: *\"Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things; yin and yang are the male and female of blood and qi. Procreation is the root of human relations.\"*\nThus, when yang is within and yin without, yin contains the embryo of yang, and the male form is produced; when yang is without and yin within, yang contains the embryo of yin, and the female form is produced.\n\nThe *Nine Chapters Scripture* states: *\"Humans receive life within the womb. The Three Origins nurture, the Nine Qi shape the form. In the ninth month, the spirits are arrayed, the qi is full, and the voice is capable. When the voice is complete and the spirits are fully formed, the Nine Heavens rejoice—thus is life born.\"*\nThe *Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* says: *\"The physical body,\"* and also: *\"born from the womb, born from an egg, born from moisture, born from transformation.\"*\nThe Sixth Patriarch says: *\"Born from an egg, one is deluded in nature; born from the womb, one is habituated in nature; born from moisture, one follows perverse nature; born from transformation, one inclines toward nature.\"*\n\nZixia said: *\"I, Shang, have heard that in the generation of the *Book of Changes*, when discussing the myriad things—birds, beasts, insects, and worms—each has its male and female. Their qi are divided differently, and none but those of penetrating virtue can trace their origins.\"*\nHeaven is one, Earth is two, and man is three. Three threes make nine.\nNine nines are eighty-one. One governs the sun, and the sun’s number is ten—thus humans are born after ten months.\nYang follows the odd, so the sun’s number is ten, from *jia* to *gui*.\nEight nines are seventy-two. The even follows the odd, and the odd governs the celestial stems. The stems belong to the moon, and the moon governs horses—thus horses are born after twelve months.\nSeven nines are sixty-three. Three governs the Dipper, and the Dipper governs dogs—thus dogs are born after three months.\nSix nines are fifty-four. Four governs the seasons, and the seasons govern pigs—thus pigs are born after four months.\nThe Dipper follows the sun and moon—thus it governs the Dipper.\nFour nines are thirty-six. Six governs the pitch-pipes, and the pitch-pipes govern deer—thus deer are born after six months.\nThree nines are twenty-seven. Seven governs the stars, and the stars govern tigers—thus tigers are born after seven months.\nThe stars comprise the twenty-eight constellations, divided among the four directions, each direction having seven degrees—thus seven governs the stars.\nTwo nines are eighteen. Eight governs the wind, and the wind belongs to insects—thus insects are born after eight months.\nThe categories of wind are exhausted at eight nines, for wind and insects are one.\nThe rest follow their own kinds.\nBirds and fish are born of yin yet belong to yang—thus they are all born from eggs.\nFish swim in water, and birds soar in the clouds—thus at the onset of winter, swallows and sparrows enter the sea and transform into clams.\nSilkworms eat but do not drink; cicadas drink but do not eat; mayflies neither drink nor eat. The reasons for the differences among the myriad things: creatures with scales and shells eat in summer and hibernate in winter. Those with shells are armored insects.\nThose that gnaw and swallow have eight orifices and are born from eggs, belonging to the bird class. Those with interlocking teeth have nine orifices and are born from the womb, belonging to humans and beasts.\nFour-legged creatures have no feathers or wings; those with horns have no upper teeth.\nThose without horns or front teeth have fat; those without horns or teeth have lard.\nThe *Huainanzi* adopts this.\nIt also says: *\"Those without horns have fat but no front teeth; those with horns have lard but no rear teeth.\"*\nCreatures born in the day resemble their fathers; those born at night resemble their mothers.\nThus, the utmost yin governs the female, and the utmost yang governs the male.\n\nDare I ask why this is so?\nConfucius said: *\"Long ago, I heard Lao Dan speak as you do.\"*\nZixia said: *\"I, Shang, have heard from the *Mountain Records*: Earth’s east-west is called *wei* (latitude), and its south-north is called *jing* (longitude). Mountains accumulate virtue; rivers accumulate form. The high give life; the low bring death. Hills are male; valleys are female. Clams, oysters, turtles, and pearls wax and wane with the sun and moon. When the moon is full, creatures like clams and pearls are full; when the moon wanes, they are empty. Thus, people from firm soil are strong; those from weak soil are gentle. People from mound soil are large; those from sandy soil are fine. People from fertile soil are beautiful; those from barren soil are ugly.\"* (The missing character is *hao*, meaning \"barren.\" Fertile soil is fine and rich; barren soil is coarse and sparse.)\nThose who eat water are good swimmers and resistant to cold; those who eat earth have no hearts and do not breathe (like leeches, which do not respire).\nThose who eat wood are strong but unruly (their blood and qi are untamed).\nThe *Huainanzi* says: *\"Strong yet not fierce\"—this also describes their untamed nature.*\n\nThose who eat grass are swift runners yet foolish; those who eat mulberry leaves produce silk and moths; those who eat meat are brave and fierce; those who consume qi are spiritually luminous and long-lived; those who eat grains are intelligent and skillful; those who eat nothing do not die and become spirits.\n\nThus it is said: Among the three hundred and sixty feathered creatures, the phoenix is their chief; among the three hundred and sixty furred creatures, the qilin is their chief; among the three hundred and sixty shelled creatures, the tortoise is their chief; among the three hundred and sixty scaled creatures, the dragon is their chief; among the three hundred and sixty naked creatures, man is their chief. These are the strategies of Heaven and Earth—Heaven above, Earth below.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius: \"At the beginning of life, there are five things a person lacks: the eyes cannot see, they cannot eat, they cannot walk, they cannot speak, they cannot transform.\" After three months of life, the pupils warm slightly, and then they can see. At eight months, teeth emerge, and then they can eat. At three years, the fontanelle closes, and then they can speak. At sixteen, their essence flows freely, and then they can transform. When yin reaches its limit, it turns back to yang, so yin transforms through yang. When yang reaches its limit, it turns back to yin, so yang transforms through yin. Thus, boys grow teeth at eight months and lose them at eight years; girls grow teeth at seven months and lose them at seven years, transforming at fourteen. One yin and one yang, the odd and even pair, then align with the Dao, giving rise to the beginnings of life and destiny, manifesting in this form.\n\nThe Duke said: \"When boys reach sixteen and their essence flows freely, and girls transform at fourteen, they can then bear children.\" Jiandi swallowed the egg left by a dark bird and gave birth to Xie. Jiang Yuan stepped in the footprint of a giant, delighted, and followed it, her body stirring as if pregnant. After a full term, she gave birth to Hou Ji.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth first divided, the first qi gave birth to the Primordial Beginning, the second qi gave birth to the Primordial Sovereign, and the third qi gave birth to the Venerable Lord, who became the master of transformation. In Heaven, he is the lord of the ten thousand heavens; descending to the world, he is the teacher of the hundred kings. Among the stars, he is the Heavenly August Emperor; in the teachings, he is the Most High Lord Lao. When Lord Lao was born, he emerged from his mother’s left armpit, his hair already white. It is also said that he transformed eighty-one times to appear in the world.\n\nThe *Veritable Records* states: Initially, Yan-shi prayed at Niqiu Mountain and gave birth to Confucius. At Confucius’s birth, the top of his head was concave, resembling Niqiu Mountain, so he was named Qiu, styled Zhongni. That night, two dragons coiled around the house, and the Five Elders descended to the courtyard—the Five Elders being the essences of the five stars. Yan-shi’s chamber heard the music of the Grand Heavenly Harmony. Before his birth, a qilin spat out a jade book at Que-li, its text reading: \"Child of the essence of water, bound to the declining Zhou as an uncrowned king.\" Yan-shi marveled at this and tied a silk ribbon to the qilin’s horn. After two nights, the qilin departed.\n\nThe *Sutra of the Manifestation* says: Śākyamuni descended from the Tuṣita Heaven into the palace of King Śuddhodana in the western region of Kapilavastu. Queen Māyā gave birth from her right side. Emperor Wu of Han’s son, Fuling, was born in the sand. Zhao Jieyu, residing in the Gouyi Palace, conceived and gave birth after fourteen months. The Emperor said: \"I have heard that in ancient times, Yao was born after fourteen months; now Gouyi is the same.\" He named it the Gate of Yao’s Mother.\n\nThe *Classic of Filial Piety* says: \"Among the natures of Heaven and Earth, man is the most noble.\" The *Scripture of the Mysterious Numinous* says: \"The human body is hard to obtain.\" Zhou Dunyi said: \"Man is the spirit of the ten thousand things.\" The *Scripture of the Dark Warrior* says: The mother of the True Warrior dreamed of swallowing sunlight, awoke pregnant, and gave birth after twenty-four months.\n\nYang Wen, the grandfather of the Song dynasty’s Yang family, dreamed someone said the Lord of Wuyi had entrusted a transformation. When his eldest son was born, he was egg-shaped. Cutting it open revealed a crane chick, its body covered in purple feathers. They placed it in a basket and abandoned it by the riverbank. His uncle found it strange, pursued it to the river, and it transformed into an infant. He took it home and raised it, and later it became a Palace Attendant.\n\nDuring the decline of the Xia dynasty, a woman of the rear palace, dwelling in seclusion, was impregnated by dragon’s saliva and gave birth to Bao Si, who brought chaos to the world. The *Songs of Chu* says: \"Lady Qi had no husband yet bore nine sons\"—the nine sons were all mothers.\n\nSuch cases are not isolated; a few examples suffice to show that those endowed with the finest qi of Heaven and Earth, with extraordinary innate bones, possess the qualities of sages and worthies. Those who receive impure and unbalanced qi become fools, villains, or monstrosities.\n\nCao Bin of the Song, later enfeoffed as Prince Wuhui, at one year old underwent the custom of testing infants. His family arranged before him an array of toys, treasures, jades, and foods. Holding the prince to observe, he alone took a shield and spear in his left hand and ritual vessels in his right. Later, he aided the Great Ancestor of Zhao in pacifying Jiangnan.\n\nFrom the age of one, a person’s likes and dislikes begin to form. Yet in their inability to speak or walk, what they like and dislike is the pure, unfeigned truth of an infant. As they grow older, their likes and dislikes increasingly diverge from the public good.\n\n**Chapter Three: Nurturing Life**\n\nThe *Laozi* says: \"My greatest affliction is that I have a body; if I had no body, what affliction would I have?\" The *Plain Questions* says: \"Men and women must reach the proper age: for men, at sixteen, their essence and qi overflow, so they should marry at thirty. For women, at fourteen, the heavenly dew arrives, so they should marry at twenty. If their two qi are full, they will conceive and bear children, and their offspring will be long-lived. In ancient times, people often lived to one hundred and twenty. Today’s affliction lies in early marriage. Before twenty for men and fifteen for women, they are already married, and their primordial essence is lost prematurely. As they grow older, they do not know how to replenish their losses. It is like a lamp: the oil poured into it is the primordial qi one is endowed with. The size of the vessel and the length of the wick determine its duration. If the lamp is placed where there is no wind and is well cared for, it will burn long; when the oil is exhausted, it goes out.\"\n\nYet if the lamp is placed in the wind, its oil and fat will quickly dry up, and it may even face the danger of sudden extinction. The span of human life—whether long or short—is much the same. Duke Ai asked Confucius: “Do the wise live long? Do the benevolent live long?” Confucius replied: “People meet three kinds of death that are not determined by fate but are self-inflicted. Those who sleep and rest at improper times, eat and drink without moderation, and overwork or overindulge in leisure will be killed by illness and suffering. Those who occupy low positions yet offend their rulers, indulge in desires without restraint, and never cease their demands will be killed by punishment. Those who attack the many with the few, insult the strong with the weak, give free rein to unchecked anger, and act without measuring their strength will be killed by weapons. These three kinds of death are not decreed by fate but are self-inflicted. As for the wise and the benevolent, they conduct themselves with moderation, act and rest with propriety, express joy and anger at the proper times, and do no harm to their nature—thus they rightfully attain longevity.\n\nGuangchengzi said to the Yellow Emperor: “Do not exhaust your body, do not disturb your essence, and you may attain long life.” Zuoshi said: “Heaven possesses six qi, which descend to produce the five flavors, manifest as the five colors, and manifest as the five sounds. Excess in them gives rise to the six illnesses. The six qi are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. They divide into the four seasons and arrange into the five phases; when they exceed their bounds, they become disasters. Excess yin brings cold illnesses; excess yang brings heat illnesses; excess wind brings illnesses of the limbs; excess rain brings abdominal illnesses; excess darkness brings illnesses of confusion; excess brightness brings illnesses of the heart.”\n\nThe *Xiangdang* chapter records that Confucius avoided ten kinds of food. Mencius said: “Eat at the proper times and use things according to ritual.” He also said: “When one sees an animal alive, one cannot bear to see it die; when one hears its cries, one cannot bear to eat its flesh. This is why the noble person keeps his distance from the kitchen.” For in matters of diet and daily life lie the great essentials of nurturing life, and thus the sages never fail to treat them with reverence.\n\nIn eating and drinking, the five flavors should not be taken to excess, for excess leads to harm. As the saying goes: “Delicious flavors in abundance will soon become illness.” Those who overwork their minds or bodies harm their limbs and blood-qi. Bright teeth and moth-like eyebrows are the axes that hew away one’s nature; sweet, crisp, rich, and fresh foods are the medicines that rot the intestines. Therefore, one should refrain from killing to accumulate virtue, moderate one’s diet, reduce one’s desires, and thus prevent illness and prolong life.\n\nThe practitioners of self-cultivation purge the excesses of the five viscera: they exhale for the liver, sigh for the heart, hiss for the lungs, call for the spleen, and blow for the kidneys. To supplement the deficiencies of the five viscera, they inhale according to each organ.\n\nThe *Yuan Shi Tai Xuan Jing* states: “Joy and anger harm one’s nature; sorrow and pleasure harm one’s spirit. Harm to one’s nature endangers life. Thus, one nurtures one’s nature to preserve one’s qi, guards one’s spirit to secure one’s body. When qi is whole and the body is balanced, the heart is at peace and the spirit is at ease—this is the secret to preserving life.”\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said to Qibo: “Human beings receive the qi of Heaven and Earth to come into life. What comes with life is called essence; the encounter of essence is called numinosity; the manifestation of numinosity is called spirit; the transformation of spirit is called the hun-soul; the hun-soul’s comings and goings with the spirit are called consciousness; the exit and entry of essence together are called the po-soul; the accumulation of glory and the gathering of the hun-soul are called the heart; the heart’s inclinations are called emotions; the attachment of emotions is called intention; the direction of intention is called will; the recollection of will is called thought; the distant yearning of thought is called contemplation; the completion of affairs through contemplation is called wisdom. Wisdom encompasses all these faculties.”\n\nThus, spirit, hun-soul, po-soul, intention, emotion, and wisdom are the functions of perception and understanding. Sun the Perfected said: “Hair should be frequently combed; teeth should be frequently tapped; saliva should be frequently swallowed; qi should be frequently refined; essence should be frequently preserved.”\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: “The Heavenly Numinous Cavity is the place where the ten thousand spirits pay homage. Obtain the One, and all affairs are complete.” Zhuangzi called it “seeing the Unique.” The Yellow Emperor called it “breathing the essence-qi and standing alone to guard the spirit.” The Most High called it: “Serene and vast, standing alone without change, circulating without ceasing.” The Unique is the One. It is said: “Guard the One to nourish the spirit; rely on the spirit to guard the One.” One who guards the One may complete his years with Heaven and Earth and enjoy boundless longevity.\n\nThe *Daodejing* of Laozi says: “Know the white, guard the black.” It also says: “Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life.” The Mysterious One is the original life of the self. The Perfected One is born and guards it; guarding it to the utmost stillness, he obtains it and guards it, never to lose it again.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* says: “Refine the hun-soul and po-soul with the Mysterious and Primordial One. The One as a thing is suddenly seen. Only when one attains the utmost truth does it turn its gaze; it most abhors the dead qi of defilement and baseness.”\n\nIt is said: Human life arises from the formless and becomes manifest. Thus, spirit transforms qi, and qi transforms essence—this is the way of employing the formed. The wise do not expend these outwardly but apply them to themselves, so that essence reverts to qi, qi reverts to spirit, and refining the spirit to merge with the Dao, one reattains the wondrousness of the formless. This is the method of returning to the root and restoring life, the art of cultivating truth and nurturing life.\n\nMencius said: “Whether one dies young or lives long, one does not waver; one cultivates the self and awaits it. This is how one establishes life.” One who knows fate does not stand beneath a crumbling wall. Kong Mou said: “At fifty, one knows the Mandate of Heaven; one who does not know the Mandate cannot be a noble person.” Liuzi said: “People receive the mean of Heaven and Earth to live—this is what is called fate.”\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “Exhaust the principles and fulfill one’s nature to reach fate.” It also says: “The sages created the *Changes* to accord with the principles of nature and fate.” And again: “The noble person acts according to the law and awaits fate; he dwells in ease and awaits fate.”\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius: “What are human fate and nature?” The Master said: “What is allotted by division and the Dao is called fate.” The *Neiguan Jing* says: “Receiving life from the Dao is called fate.” Mencius said: “The mouth’s desire for flavors, the eyes’ desire for colors, the ears’ desire for sounds, the nose’s desire for scents, and the four limbs’ desire for ease and comfort are nature, but there is fate in them. The noble person does not call them nature.”\n\nChengzi said: “The five desires are nature, yet there is allotment in them, and one cannot always have one’s wishes—this is fate.” This fate refers to the principle of bestowal.\n\n*Cloud Palace Dharma Words*, Volume One concludes.\n*Cloud Palace Dharma Words*, Volume Two.\nCompiled by Jishui Xuyi, Master Jing’an, Wang Kesun.\n\n**Chapter Four: Cultivating Goodness**\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: “The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle. Only through refinement and unity can one truly grasp the center.”\n\nMencius said: “The great person does not lose the heart of an infant.” This means purity and absence of falsity.\n\nThe *Great Learning* says: “To rectify the heart: if the body harbors anger or resentment, it cannot be rectified; if there is fear, it cannot be rectified; if there is fondness for pleasure, it cannot be rectified; if there is worry or distress, it cannot be rectified. When the heart is not present, one sees yet does not see, hears yet does not hear, eats yet does not know the taste—this is how cultivating the self lies in rectifying the heart.”\n\nMencius said: “Grasp it and it remains; abandon it and it perishes. It comes and goes without fixed time, and none knows its direction—this is what is meant by the heart.” He also said: “At forty, my heart did not waver.” And again: “There is no better way to nurture the heart than to reduce desires.” And: “The way of learning and inquiry is nothing other than seeking the lost heart.”\n\nThe *Explanation of the Dipper Classic* says: “When a person’s heart roams outward, the spirit wanders and departs. When the heart is settled inward, the spirit rests in harmony. All good and evil reside in the heart. The heart is the abode of spirit and brightness; in action and stillness, in movement and rest, in good and evil, when desires arise, it knows all. Can the deluded heart of man not be stilled?” It also says: “Man’s primordial destiny is outwardly lodged in the eyes and inwardly stored in the heart. The eyes look outward upon the ten thousand things, while the heart races inward among the ten thousand affairs. Where heart and eyes race, the spirit also rushes—hence it is called primordial destiny.” To cease the galloping of horses and return to manure is like one who gathers the heart and returns to illumination, preserving the mysterious spirit within oneself.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: “The Tathāgata often declares that all dharmas are created by the mind, and all causes and effects take form through the mind.”\n\nZhang Wujin said: “To realize this deluded heart is to be the pure, tranquil Buddha-nature.”\n\nThe precepts say: “The heart is the origin of the ten thousand dharmas, the master of the nine orifices. It transcends past and present without decay—hence it is said: when the true suchness stirs within, the six consciousnesses flow outward. If it does not incline toward goodness, it inclines toward evil.”\n\nThe *Classic of Purity and Stillness* says: “Once there is a deluded heart, it startles the spirit; once the spirit is startled, it clings to the ten thousand things; once it clings to the ten thousand things, it generates craving; once craving arises, there is affliction.”\n\nThe *Classic of Fixed Observation* says: “When the awakened heart arises, extinguish it at once. Extinguish only the moving heart, not the illuminating heart. Simply congeal the empty heart, not the abiding heart.”\n\nThe *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: “The past heart cannot be obtained, the present heart cannot be obtained, the future heart cannot be obtained.”\n\nThe Sixth Patriarch said: “The deluded heart is but a shadow upon the true heart.”\n\nThe scripture says: “Your body, your heart—all are manifestations within the wondrous luminous nature.” To know that all hearts are not the true heart is to know the essence of the heart. If it is the deluded heart, there is past, present, and future; if it is the true nature, it is utterly still and unmoving.\n\n**The foregoing discusses the heart.**\n\nHengqu said: “The heart governs nature and emotion.” He also said: “To be spiritually luminous and undimmed is the heart; to possess this principle fully, without the slightest lack, is nature; to respond to stimuli is emotion.”\n\nYi said: “From the Great Void comes the name *qi*; from the transformation of *qi* comes the name *Dao*; the union of void and *qi* gives the name *nature*; the union of nature and awareness gives the name *heart*. That which is numinous is the heart; that which is real is nature.”\n\nThe *Tang Announcement* says: “Only the August Lord-on-High bestows the center upon the people below, as if there were a constant nature.”\n\nYi Yin said: “Habit and nature become one.”\n\nZu Yi said: “Not anticipating the Mandate of Heaven.”\n\nMencius spoke of the goodness of nature—this is entirely about principle.\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: “What Heaven confers is called nature.” This refers to both humans and other beings. Where there is the Mandate of Heaven, there must be this *qi* to bear this principle. Without this *qi*, how could this principle be suddenly manifested?\n\nChengzi said: “To discuss nature without discussing *qi* is incomplete; to discuss *qi* without discussing nature is unclear.”\n\nThe *Reflections on Things at Hand* says: “The heart is one: when referring to its substance, it is still and unmoving; when referring to its function, it responds and thoroughly communicates.”\n\nZhu Xi said: “In stillness, it is ever aware; in movement, it is ever correct. The wonder of the heart lies in its stillness that responds and its response that returns to stillness.”\n\nConfucius spoke of nature being near and habit distant. Mencius spoke of fully realizing the heart to know nature, preserving the heart and nurturing nature to serve Heaven.\n\nMencius said: “Humaneness in father and son, righteousness in ruler and minister, propriety in host and guest, wisdom in the worthy, the sage’s relation to the Way of Heaven—these are fate, yet they are also nature. The noble person does not call them fate.”\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “Exhaust the principles and fulfill one’s nature to reach fate.” It also says: “The sages created the *Changes* to accord with the principles of nature and fate.”\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius: “What are human fate and nature?” “To be shaped by the One is called nature.” Each person receives from yin and yang a nature of hardness or softness—hence it is said to be shaped by the One.\n\nThe *Neiguan Jing* says: “To receive form from the One is called nature.”\n\nZhu Xi said: “Nature is the Supreme Ultimate, the undifferentiated whole—initially, it cannot be expressed in words.”\n\n**The foregoing discusses heart and nature.**\n\nIn the preceding sections, the Confucians speak of preserving the heart and nurturing nature, while Daoists and Buddhists speak of illuminating the heart and seeing nature. The Confucians take concrete principle as nature, manifesting it in action. Daoists and Buddhists take natural non-action as nature.\n\nI would suggest that the Daoist and Buddhist discourse on nature refers to the \"centrality before arousal,\" while the Confucian discourse on nature refers to \"all that is aroused being in accord with the standard.\" To see one’s nature is called the Dao, just as to see one’s nature is called seeing the Buddha. The Buddha’s term *jue* (awakening) surely does not refer to the Buddha as carved from clay or wood.\n\n**Chapter Five: On the Application of Principles**\n\nYan Yuan said: “Shun—what sort of man was he? What sort of man am I? He who exerts himself will also be like this.” The Master said: “To know and yet not act is not as good as not knowing.” The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: “I do not slight you; you shall all become Buddhas.” *Fo* (Buddha) is the title of the sage of the Western lands. The Sixth Patriarch said: “Those who do not awaken are sentient beings, common folk; those who awaken are called Buddhas.” *Buddha* means “great awakening.” People receive the qi of Heaven and Earth and are born, sharing this goodness. Yet awakening comes sooner or later; those who awaken later must emulate the actions of those who awaken earlier, thereby illuminating goodness and returning to their original state. This saying is most profound.\n\nThe sage knows from birth and acts with ease, never tiring of learning. The worthy learn and then know, striving to act. Those who are beset by difficulties yet do not learn—such people are the lowest. Master Zeng examined himself thrice daily; loyalty and reciprocity form a single thread. The noble person thinks ninefold, stands in awe of three things, and guards against three dangers. Master Yan mastered the four “do nots.” Confucius cut off four things, maintained the measuring square, and was cautious in solitude. These are all the daily practices one should uphold.\n\nSincerity of intention means not deceiving oneself. The one thing is sincerity alone—this is called “without delusion.” To be sincere is not to deceive; this is secondary. Kangjie said: “The prior Heaven is governed by sincerity. Utmost sincerity can communicate with the divine luminaries; without sincerity, one cannot attain the Dao.” Sincerity is the instrument of the master of nature, boundless and without direction. The way of utmost sincerity can foreknow. It is said: “In me there is not a shred of private falsity, thus I am ever empty and luminous, naturally able to see.” Sincerity is the Dao of Heaven; to be sincere is the Dao of humanity. Sincerity is to hit the mark without effort, to attain without thought, to be at ease in the central Dao—this is the sage. To be sincere is to choose goodness and hold fast to it.\n\n“From sincerity to clarity” is called nature; “from clarity to sincerity” is called teaching. Sincerity leads to clarity; clarity leads to sincerity. Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can fully realize its nature. It can assist in the transformation and nourishment of Heaven and Earth, and stand alongside them. It is also said: “Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can transform the sincere.” The beginning and end of things—without sincerity, there are no things. Utmost sincerity is without ceasing; without ceasing, it endures. Enduring without limit. Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can order the great warp of the world, establish the great root of the world, and know the transformation and nourishment of the world—how could it rely on anything? The great warp is the five relations of human ethics; the great root is the complete substance of nature. The sage’s ultimate understanding is without delusion; his natural functioning—how could it rely on anything to be able?\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says: “The Mandate of Heaven—profound and unceasing.” This is to say: that by which King Wen was called Wen—ah! How illustrious! King Wen’s virtue was pure, pure and unceasing. It also says: “Reverent and majestic was King Wen, ever bright and respectful.” The *Book of Changes* says: “The movement of Heaven is strong; the noble person thereby strengthens himself unceasingly.” The *Inscription on Tang’s Basin* says: “If you renew yourself for a day, renew yourself daily, and renew yourself yet again.”\n\nHui’s character was such that he chose the Mean, and having obtained one goodness, he held it fast in his breast and never lost it. The Dao cannot be departed from for even a moment; that which can be departed from is not the Dao.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao and Master Fu drilled a wooden awl in the stone chamber of Mount Jiao, piercing a stone plate five feet thick; after forty-nine years, the stone was penetrated. Mencius said: “To expose it for a day and then freeze it for ten—nothing can grow thus.” The earlier Confucians said: “The single word *jing* (reverence) is how the sage’s learning is accomplished, beginning and ending in it.” Master Cheng spoke of reverence as “focusing on one thing without distraction.” He also said: “Utmost sincerity is without ceasing; sincerity is true and without delusion.”\n\nThe human heart is prone to dissipation and carelessness; if one does not establish a rule to maintain it, constantly raising vigilance, it will become dissolute and have nowhere to return. Only by focusing on one thing, only by utmost sincerity, can one begin well and end well. I would say: the trouble with people is starting and stopping. The Buddhist teachings also call this “severance and constancy.” For example, steaming sand will never become rice. The Chan school’s method of “ever-wakeful” requires that thought follow upon thought without interruption. Thus it is said: “Advance bravely and diligently without retreat.” This is also well said, and accords with the Confucian “focusing on one thing without ceasing.” Sincerity and reverence must not depart from the body for even a moment.\n\n**Chapter Six: On Attaining the Subtle**\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Hymn* says:\nThe physical body is not the Buddha,\nNor is sound.\nYet without leaving the physical body,\nOne sees the Buddha’s supernatural power.\n\nZhuangzi said: “The noble person sits as a corpse yet appears like a dragon; is silent as the abyss yet thunders. When the spirit moves, Heaven follows. At ease and without action.” Guangchengzi said: “The essence of the utmost Dao is dark and obscure; the ultimate of the utmost Dao is dim and silent. Without seeing, without hearing, embrace the spirit in stillness. The body will then right itself, and must be pure and clear.”\n\nThe *Heart Sūtra of the Prajñāpāramitā* says: “Illuminating, one sees that the five aggregates are all empty.” The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* says: “Purify the six senses and cut off evil obstructions.” The *Scripture of Attaining the Dao* says: “Inwardly observe with heart and eyes; the true qi that is there is pure, luminous, empty, and bright.” It also hymns:\nDark and obscure, the pure Dao;\nDim and silent, the great void.\nThe substance and nature are serene, without abode;\nForm and heart are both still—one true source.\n\nThe *Scripture of Original Conduct* says: “When all thoughts do not arise, the myriad conditions suddenly cease. The evil karma of dust and sand dissipates with each thought; all heavenly demons naturally perish.” The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says: “If a person can always be pure and still, Heaven and Earth all return to him.”\n\nThe text further states: “When the absence of absence is itself absent, there is only profound and constant stillness. When stillness is no longer stillness, how can desire arise? With desire unarisen, this is true stillness. Always responsive, always still—this is constant purity and stillness.”\n\nThe *Dao De Jing* says: “The multitude bustle about, as if ascending a spring terrace, as if feasting on a grand sacrifice. I alone remain detached, without sign, like an infant who has not yet learned to smile.” It also says: “Concentrate the qi to attain suppleness—can one become like an infant?” And again: “Return to the state of the infant.”\n\nZhang Wujin said: “The attainment that is no attainment is true attainment; the discourse that is no discourse is true discourse.”\n\nMaster Xu Bian said: “The Dharma of the Great Vehicle is a mind without attachment. Attaining great freedom, acting yet not acting, doing yet not doing—this is what makes one sagely, enlightened, and wise.”\n\nA poem says: “The workings of Heaven above—utterly soundless, utterly scentless—are supreme.”\n\nMaster Chuan’s hymn says:\nSeeing forms and hearing sounds—such is the world’s common way;\nLayer upon layer, snow upon frost.\nIf you now wish to see the Yellow-Headed Elder,\nEnter the womb of Māyā and there conceal yourself.\n\nThis is the study of returning to the root and restoring the origin, the mechanism of turning the light inward and reflecting back—profoundly entering the state of forgetting illumination and transcending reflection.\n\n**Chapter on Spiritual Transformation, Section Seven**\n\nThe *Hong Fan*’s ninefold blessings say: “Die at the appointed time.” The *Book of Changes* says: “The Changes are on par with Heaven and Earth; thus one knows the causes of the hidden and the manifest. Tracing beginnings and returning to endings, one knows the discourse on death and life.”\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius about this. The Master said: “Transformation ends in yin and yang. Manifesting form and issuing forth is called life—endless generation and transformation. When the reckoning is exhausted, it is called death. Thus life is the beginning of one’s nature, and death is the end of life. Where there is a beginning, there must be an end.”\n\nThe Master also said: “Not yet understanding life, how can one understand death?”\n\nYue Tian said: “Death is the end of reckoning.”\n\nMencius said: “One who dies having fully realized the Way dies a proper death. One who dies in shackles does not die a proper death. Those who understand fate do not stand beneath crumbling walls.”\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: “Many former sagely kings of Yin are in Heaven.” The commentary explains: “Many enlightened and wise kings of the Shang dynasty—with their refined spirits—are in Heaven.”\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “The wandering soul undergoes transformation.” And again: “Know the conditions of ghosts and spirits.” And: “To fathom the spirit and know transformation is the height of virtue.”\n\nThe Master said: “The virtue of ghosts and spirits—how abundant it is! Invisible when looked for, inaudible when listened for, yet pervading all things without omission. It makes the people of the world fast, purify, and dress in fine robes to offer sacrifices—overflowing, as if above them, as if beside them. The advent of the spirits—how unfathomable! How could one treat them lightly?”\n\nThe subtlety made manifest, the sincerity that cannot be concealed—such is this. Earlier Confucians cited the *Book of Rites*: “The feudal lords, following their state’s sacrifices, offer to those in their state without descendants, such as the Grand Duke of Qi’s enfeoffment in Qi. They sacrifice to the Shangjiu clan, Jikuai, Feng Boling, the Pugu clan, and the like—former lords of that land, now included in the rites. For example, the Marquis of Wei dreamed of Kang Shu saying, ‘You are usurping my offerings.’ Since Wei later moved its capital to Diqiu, and the Xia ruler Xiang also had his capital at Diqiu, it was fitting to sacrifice there. If not, the spirits would resent it. Another example: the Marquis of Jin dreamed of a yellow bear entering his bedchamber, which he took to be the spirit of Gun. Such cases are of this kind. It is not that only those with descendants have the principle of spiritual resonance. Even without descendants, their qi has not perished. Now, when we sacrifice to Gou Mang, though he is distant, since it is fitting to sacrifice to him, his qi is present. In essence, the qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity is one and the same. Thus it is said: ‘Overflowing, as if above them, as if beside them.’ The vast emptiness is replete with nothing but this principle—it is for people to perceive it vividly.”\n\nZhu Xi of Hui’an said: “The exhalation and inhalation of mouth and nose are the *hun*; the clarity of ears and eyes is the *po*. The yang *hun* is spirit; the yin *po* is ghost. In humans, when yin and yang unite, the *po* congeals and the *hun* gathers, giving rise to life. When yin and yang part, the *hun* ascends as spirit, and the *po* descends as ghost. In terms of coming and going: what comes is just unfolding as spirit; what goes is already receding as ghost. The division of the two qi is the movement of one qi.”\n\nThus, Confucius’ *Sacrificial Rites* says: “Qi is the abundance of spirit; *po* is the abundance of ghost.” Zheng’s commentary says: “Qi is the breath that goes in and out. The acuity of ears and eyes is the *po*. Thus, one cannot yet speak of ghosts and spirits in terms of yin and yang—it is the numinosity of yin and yang that is ghosts and spirits. The *po* is the spirit of form; the *hun* is the spirit of qi. *Hun* and *po* are the essence of form and qi; their clarity is called *ling*.”\n\nThe other night, discussing cultivation, I spoke of the turmoil at death—knowing the meaning of *xunhao* (the qi that assails one) is most urgent. When its qi brushes against a person, one clearly knows the meaning of sorrow and desolation. The shrine of Emperor Wu’s Lady Li says: “Its wind was solemn.” Now, in villages where many households gather to offer sacrifices, there may be a solemn wind like a gust—commonly called a whirlwind—this is the same idea. When foul qi strikes a person, it makes one fearful and desolate—this is the refined spirit of things.\n\nThe Way of Heaven flows and operates, giving birth to and nurturing the myriad things. Humans receive it and thus have life. The clear part of qi is qi; the illuminated part is substance. Consciousness and movement are the work of yang; physical form is the work of yin. Qi is *hun*; form is *po*. The Buddhists take nature as *hun* and illusion as *po*.\n\nGao You’s commentary on the *Huainanzi* says: “The *hun* is the spirit of yang; the *po* is the spirit of yin. Because they govern form and qi, they are called spirits. What gives rise to human life is the gathering of essence and qi. Humans have only so much qi, and there must come a time when it is exhausted. When exhausted, the spirit-qi returns to Heaven, and the form-*po* returns to Earth.”\n\nNow the Buddhists take nature as the root and illusion as destiny—this is indeed so. When a person is near death, the warmth of qi gradually fades, which is called the ascent of *hun*; the lower body cools, the light in the eyes dims, which is called the descent of *po*. Where there is life, there must be death; where there is a beginning, there must be an end—what gathers and disperses is qi. As for those who become malevolent spirits, they are people who did not die a proper death, whose qi has not dispersed but instead congeals and transforms into demons.\n\nHui’an’s commentary on Qu Yuan’s *Far Roaming* says: “When *po* does not receive *hun* and *hun* does not bear *po*, then *hun* wanders and *po* descends, and death follows.” He also says: “*Hun* and *po* are like burning incense: the oozing resin is *po*, while the smoke that rises afterward is *hun*. *Hun* is the radiance of *po*; *po* is the root and stem of *hun*. Those who cultivate and refine themselves must ensure that *hun* always clings to *po*, like sunlight carrying the essence of the moon; and that *po* always restrains *hun*, like the moon’s essence receiving sunlight. Then the spirit does not scatter, and *po* does not die, enabling one to ascend as an immortal and journey far upward.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “To be great and transform is called sageliness; to be sagely and unknowable is called spirit.” Spirit has no fixed direction, just as the *Changes* has no fixed form.\n\n*Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses*, Scroll the Lower, concludes.",

      "translated_text": "**Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses**\n\n*Scripture Title:* Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses. Compiled by Wang Kesun of the Yuan Dynasty. Two scrolls. Source text from *The Orthodox Daoist Canon*, Supreme Mystery Section.\n\n**Preface to Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses**\n\nAll forms decay, yet only the Dao alone is imperishable. Man dwells between Heaven and Earth as the vessel of this Dao. There is fate, and there is nature—what Heaven decrees is called nature, and following nature is called the Dao. There is no second Dao in the world; how could there be two natures or two fates? The subtleties of \"refining the essence to unify the mind\" were seen in the Great Shun’s admonitions to Yu. The constancy of nature, the cultivation of nature, the illumination of nature, and the restraint of nature were expounded in the maxims of Tang’s Yi Yin and the Duke of Zhou. The Master praised the *Book of Changes*, saying: \"Each rectifies its nature and fate.\" Thus, nature and fate are spoken of together. Yet observe how the Master rarely spoke of fate and benevolence, and the nature and the Way of Heaven could not be heard. The study of nature and fate is not something the shallowly learned can fully comprehend.\n\nThrough the transmission from Zengzi, Zisi, and Mencius, the learning of nature and fate became ever more manifest and detailed. The Confucians took nurturing nature and following nature as their priority, and knowing fate and establishing fate as their duty. Thus, their merit reached the utmost in assisting transformation and nurturing life, and they participated in the work of Heaven and Earth. The Daoists and Buddhists, in clarifying the mind and perceiving nature, cultivating fate and returning to fate, attain the wondrous existence of true emptiness and merge with the Dao in truth. The learning of nature and fate in Daoism and Buddhism cannot be extinguished either.\n\nIn later ages, corruption arose: Confucians used literary arts to trade for rank and salary, while Daoists and Buddhists employed fortune and misfortune to deceive the foolish and mediocre. In the practice of personal conduct, few adhered to the true path of nature and fate. Moreover, the Three Bonds and Five Constants are the great origin of the Dao; if the decrees of Heaven and the norms of the people are not fully realized, how can this be called the Dao?\n\nIn this sagely and enlightened dynasty, the ruler and teachers act as exemplars. Our Confucian Way is ever more revered and encouraged, while the two traditions of Daoism and Buddhism are not abolished but honored and rewarded, with the hope that all under Heaven may return to the Dao. In this era of grand harmony and flourishing governance, where the household of Ji and the people of Gao Yao abound, and the supreme enlightenment of Śākyamuni and the efficacy of Laozi’s teachings prevail, those who discourse on nature and fate have multiplied. Yet they have not grasped the essential unity of these teachings.\n\nI have imitated the classics and compiled these discourses by category. The Confucian Way is attained through rectifying the mind and sincerity of intention, and the Ways of the Buddha and Laozi are likewise attained through rectifying the mind and sincerity of intention. When human desires are entirely purified and the principles of Heaven flow freely, even a single thought unarisen reveals the great mechanism of the entire being. Transforming into the sagely and spiritual—apart from this, it is not what I call the Dao, nor what I call nature and fate. I name this collection *Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses*. Daoist texts speak of resting in the Yellow Chamber of the Cloud Palace, which is the time of \"fasting the mind\" and \"sitting in forgetfulness.\" In thoroughly investigating this Dao, one may gaze ahead and behind without finding a moment otherwise—standing upright without shame, bowing without remorse. How could nature and fate merely signify emptiness and nothingness?\n\nAutumn of the *wuxu* year of the Dade era,\nPreface by Wang Kesun of Jishui, the Recluse of Empty Serenity.\n\n**Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses, Scroll One**\nCompiled by Wang Kesun of Jishui, the Recluse of Empty Serenity\n\n**Chapter One: The Primordial Heaven**",

The Two Modes generate the Four Images, and the Four Images generate the Eight Trigrams.\"*\nClosing the door is called *Kun* (Earth); opening the door is called *Qian* (Heaven). The alternation of closing and opening is called *change*.\n*Qian* is the yang entity; *Kun* is the yin entity.\n*Qian* is Heaven and called Father; *Kun* is Earth and called Mother.

Their qi are divided differently, and none but those of penetrating virtue can trace their origins.\"*\nHeaven is one, Earth is two, and man is three. Three threes make nine.\nNine nines are eighty-one. One governs the sun, and the sun’s number is ten—thus humans are born after ten months.\nYang follows the odd, so the sun’s number is ten, from *jia* to *gui*.\nEight nines are seventy-two. The even follows the odd, and the odd governs the celestial stems. The stems belong to the moon, and the moon governs horses—thus horses are born after twelve months.\nSeven nines are sixty-three. Three governs the Dipper, and the Dipper governs dogs—thus dogs are born after three months.\nSix nines are fifty-four. Four governs the seasons, and the seasons govern pigs—thus pigs are born after four months.\nThe Dipper follows the sun and moon—thus it governs the Dipper.\nFour nines are thirty-six. Six governs the pitch-pipes, and the pitch-pipes govern deer—thus deer are born after six months.\nThree nines are twenty-seven. Seven governs the stars, and the stars govern tigers—thus tigers are born after seven months.\nThe stars comprise the twenty-eight constellations, divided among the four directions, each direction having seven degrees—thus seven governs the stars.\nTwo nines are eighteen. Eight governs the wind, and the wind belongs to insects—thus insects are born after eight months.\nThe categories of wind are exhausted at eight nines, for wind and insects are one.\nThe rest follow their own kinds.\nBirds and fish are born of yin yet belong to yang—thus they are all born from eggs.\nFish swim in water, and birds soar in the clouds—thus at the onset of winter, swallows and sparrows enter the sea and transform into clams.\nSilkworms eat but do not drink; cicadas drink but do not eat; mayflies neither drink nor eat. The reasons for the differences among the myriad things: creatures with scales and shells eat in summer and hibernate in winter. Those with shells are armored insects.\nThose that gnaw and swallow have eight orifices and are born from eggs, belonging to the bird class. Those with interlocking teeth have nine orifices and are born from the womb, belonging to humans and beasts.\nFour-legged creatures have no feathers or wings; those with horns have no upper teeth.\nThose without horns or front teeth have fat; those without horns or teeth have lard.\nThe *Huainanzi* adopts this.\nIt also says: *\"Those without horns have fat but no front teeth; those with horns have lard but no rear teeth.\"*\nCreatures born in the day resemble their fathers; those born at night resemble their mothers.\nThus, the utmost yin governs the female, and the utmost yang governs the male.\n\nDare I ask why this is so?\nConfucius said: *\"Long ago, I heard Lao Dan speak as you do.\"*\nZixia said: *\"I, Shang, have heard from the *Mountain Records*: Earth’s east-west is called *wei* (latitude), and its south-north is called *jing* (longitude). Mountains accumulate virtue; rivers accumulate form. The high give life; the low bring death. Hills are male; valleys are female. Clams, oysters, turtles, and pearls wax and wane with the sun and moon. When the moon is full, creatures like clams and pearls are full; when the moon wanes, they are empty. Thus, people from firm soil are strong; those from weak soil are gentle. People from mound soil are large; those from sandy soil are fine. People from fertile soil are beautiful; those from barren soil are ugly.\"* (The missing character is *hao*, meaning \"barren.\" Fertile soil is fine and rich; barren soil is coarse and sparse.)\nThose who eat water are good swimmers and resistant to cold; those who eat earth have no hearts and do not breathe (like leeches, which do not respire).\nThose who eat wood are strong but unruly (their blood and qi are untamed).\nThe *Huainanzi* says: *\"Strong yet not fierce\"—this also describes their untamed nature.*",

These are the strategies of Heaven and Earth—Heaven above, Earth below.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius: \"At the beginning of life, there are five things a person lacks: the eyes cannot see, they cannot eat, they cannot walk, they cannot speak, they cannot transform.\" After three months of life, the pupils warm slightly, and then they can see. At eight months, teeth emerge, and then they can eat. At three years, the fontanelle closes, and then they can speak. At sixteen, their essence flows freely, and then they can transform. When yin reaches its limit, it turns back to yang, so yin transforms through yang. When yang reaches its limit, it turns back to yin, so yang transforms through yin. Thus, boys grow teeth at eight months and lose them at eight years; girls grow teeth at seven months and lose them at seven years, transforming at fourteen. One yin and one yang, the odd and even pair, then align with the Dao, giving rise to the beginnings of life and destiny, manifesting in this form.\n\nThe Duke said: \"When boys reach sixteen and their essence flows freely, and girls transform at fourteen, they can then bear children.\" Jiandi swallowed the egg left by a dark bird and gave birth to Xie. Jiang Yuan stepped in the footprint of a giant, delighted, and followed it, her body stirring as if pregnant. After a full term, she gave birth to Hou Ji.\n\nWhen Heaven and Earth first divided, the first qi gave birth to the Primordial Beginning, the second qi gave birth to the Primordial Sovereign, and the third qi gave birth to the Venerable Lord, who became the master of transformation. In Heaven, he is the lord of the ten thousand heavens; descending to the world, he is the teacher of the hundred kings. Among the stars, he is the Heavenly August Emperor; in the teachings, he is the Most High Lord Lao. When Lord Lao was born, he emerged from his mother’s left armpit, his hair already white. It is also said that he transformed eighty-one times to appear in the world.\n\nThe *Veritable Records* states: Initially, Yan-shi prayed at Niqiu Mountain and gave birth to Confucius. At Confucius’s birth, the top of his head was concave, resembling Niqiu Mountain, so he was named Qiu, styled Zhongni. That night, two dragons coiled around the house, and the Five Elders descended to the courtyard—the Five Elders being the essences of the five stars. Yan-shi’s chamber heard the music of the Grand Heavenly Harmony. Before his birth, a qilin spat out a jade book at Que-li, its text reading: \"Child of the essence of water, bound to the declining Zhou as an uncrowned king.\" Yan-shi marveled at this and tied a silk ribbon to the qilin’s horn. After two nights, the qilin departed.\n\nThe *Sutra of the Manifestation* says: Śākyamuni descended from the Tuṣita Heaven into the palace of King Śuddhodana in the western region of Kapilavastu. Queen Māyā gave birth from her right side. Emperor Wu of Han’s son, Fuling, was born in the sand. Zhao Jieyu, residing in the Gouyi Palace, conceived and gave birth after fourteen months. The Emperor said: \"I have heard that in ancient times, Yao was born after fourteen months; now Gouyi is the same.\" He named it the Gate of Yao’s Mother.\n\nThe *Classic of Filial Piety* says: \"Among the natures of Heaven and Earth, man is the most noble.\" The *Scripture of the Mysterious Numinous* says: \"The human body is hard to obtain.\" Zhou Dunyi said: \"Man is the spirit of the ten thousand things.\" The *Scripture of the Dark Warrior* says: The mother of the True Warrior dreamed of swallowing sunlight, awoke pregnant, and gave birth after twenty-four months.\n\nYang Wen, the grandfather of the Song dynasty’s Yang family, dreamed someone said the Lord of Wuyi had entrusted a transformation. When his eldest son was born, he was egg-shaped. Cutting it open revealed a crane chick, its body covered in purple feathers. They placed it in a basket and abandoned it by the riverbank. His uncle found it strange, pursued it to the river, and it transformed into an infant. He took it home and raised it, and later it became a Palace Attendant.\n\nDuring the decline of the Xia dynasty, a woman of the rear palace, dwelling in seclusion, was impregnated by dragon’s saliva and gave birth to Bao Si, who brought chaos to the world. The *Songs of Chu* says: \"Lady Qi had no husband yet bore nine sons\"—the nine sons were all mothers.\n\nSuch cases are not isolated; a few examples suffice to show that those endowed with the finest qi of Heaven and Earth, with extraordinary innate bones, possess the qualities of sages and worthies. Those who receive impure and unbalanced qi become fools, villains, or monstrosities.\n\nCao Bin of the Song, later enfeoffed as Prince Wuhui, at one year old underwent the custom of testing infants. His family arranged before him an array of toys, treasures, jades, and foods. Holding the prince to observe, he alone took a shield and spear in his left hand and ritual vessels in his right. Later, he aided the Great Ancestor of Zhao in pacifying Jiangnan.\n\nFrom the age of one, a person’s likes and dislikes begin to form. Yet in their inability to speak or walk, what they like and dislike is the pure, unfeigned truth of an infant. As they grow older, their likes and dislikes increasingly diverge from the public good.\n\n**Chapter Three: Nurturing Life**\n\nThe *Laozi* says: \"My greatest affliction is that I have a body; if I had no body, what affliction would I have?\" The *Plain Questions* says: \"Men and women must reach the proper age: for men, at sixteen, their essence and qi overflow, so they should marry at thirty. For women, at fourteen, the heavenly dew arrives, so they should marry at twenty. If their two qi are full, they will conceive and bear children, and their offspring will be long-lived. In ancient times, people often lived to one hundred and twenty. Today’s affliction lies in early marriage. Before twenty for men and fifteen for women, they are already married, and their primordial essence is lost prematurely. As they grow older, they do not know how to replenish their losses. It is like a lamp: the oil poured into it is the primordial qi one is endowed with. The size of the vessel and the length of the wick determine its duration. If the lamp is placed where there is no wind and is well cared for, it will burn long; when the oil is exhausted, it goes out.\"",

      "translated_text": "Yet if the lamp is placed in the wind, its oil and fat will quickly dry up, and it may even face the danger of sudden extinction. The span of human life—whether long or short—is much the same. Duke Ai asked Confucius: “Do the wise live long? Do the benevolent live long?” Confucius replied: “People meet three kinds of death that are not determined by fate but are self-inflicted. Those who sleep and rest at improper times, eat and drink without moderation, and overwork or overindulge in leisure will be killed by illness and suffering. Those who occupy low positions yet offend their rulers, indulge in desires without restraint, and never cease their demands will be killed by punishment. Those who attack the many with the few, insult the strong with the weak, give free rein to unchecked anger, and act without measuring their strength will be killed by weapons. These three kinds of death are not decreed by fate but are self-inflicted. As for the wise and the benevolent, they conduct themselves with moderation, act and rest with propriety, express joy and anger at the proper times, and do no harm to their nature—thus they rightfully attain longevity.\n\nGuangchengzi said to the Yellow Emperor: “Do not exhaust your body, do not disturb your essence, and you may attain long life.” Zuoshi said: “Heaven possesses six qi, which descend to produce the five flavors, manifest as the five colors, and manifest as the five sounds. Excess in them gives rise to the six illnesses. The six qi are yin, yang, wind, rain, darkness, and brightness. They divide into the four seasons and arrange into the five phases; when they exceed their bounds, they become disasters. Excess yin brings cold illnesses; excess yang brings heat illnesses; excess wind brings illnesses of the limbs; excess rain brings abdominal illnesses; excess darkness brings illnesses of confusion; excess brightness brings illnesses of the heart.”\n\nThe *Xiangdang* chapter records that Confucius avoided ten kinds of food. Mencius said: “Eat at the proper times and use things according to ritual.” He also said: “When one sees an animal alive, one cannot bear to see it die; when one hears its cries, one cannot bear to eat its flesh. This is why the noble person keeps his distance from the kitchen.” For in matters of diet and daily life lie the great essentials of nurturing life, and thus the sages never fail to treat them with reverence.\n\nIn eating and drinking, the five flavors should not be taken to excess, for excess leads to harm. As the saying goes: “Delicious flavors in abundance will soon become illness.” Those who overwork their minds or bodies harm their limbs and blood-qi. Bright teeth and moth-like eyebrows are the axes that hew away one’s nature; sweet, crisp, rich, and fresh foods are the medicines that rot the intestines. Therefore, one should refrain from killing to accumulate virtue, moderate one’s diet, reduce one’s desires, and thus prevent illness and prolong life.\n\nThe practitioners of self-cultivation purge the excesses of the five viscera: they exhale for the liver, sigh for the heart, hiss for the lungs, call for the spleen, and blow for the kidneys. To supplement the deficiencies of the five viscera, they inhale according to each organ.\n\nThe *Yuan Shi Tai Xuan Jing* states: “Joy and anger harm one’s nature; sorrow and pleasure harm one’s spirit. Harm to one’s nature endangers life. Thus, one nurtures one’s nature to preserve one’s qi, guards one’s spirit to secure one’s body. When qi is whole and the body is balanced, the heart is at peace and the spirit is at ease—this is the secret to preserving life.”\n\nThe Yellow Emperor said to Qibo: “Human beings receive the qi of Heaven and Earth to come into life. What comes with life is called essence; the encounter of essence is called numinosity; the manifestation of numinosity is called spirit; the transformation of spirit is called the hun-soul; the hun-soul’s comings and goings with the spirit are called consciousness; the exit and entry of essence together are called the po-soul; the accumulation of glory and the gathering of the hun-soul are called the heart; the heart’s inclinations are called emotions; the attachment of emotions is called intention; the direction of intention is called will; the recollection of will is called thought; the distant yearning of thought is called contemplation; the completion of affairs through contemplation is called wisdom. Wisdom encompasses all these faculties.”\n\nThus, spirit, hun-soul, po-soul, intention, emotion, and wisdom are the functions of perception and understanding. Sun the Perfected said: “Hair should be frequently combed; teeth should be frequently tapped; saliva should be frequently swallowed; qi should be frequently refined; essence should be frequently preserved.”\n\nThe *Baopuzi* states: “The Heavenly Numinous Cavity is the place where the ten thousand spirits pay homage. Obtain the One, and all affairs are complete.” Zhuangzi called it “seeing the Unique.” The Yellow Emperor called it “breathing the essence-qi and standing alone to guard the spirit.” The Most High called it: “Serene and vast, standing alone without change, circulating without ceasing.” The Unique is the One. It is said: “Guard the One to nourish the spirit; rely on the spirit to guard the One.” One who guards the One may complete his years with Heaven and Earth and enjoy boundless longevity.\n\nThe *Daodejing* of Laozi says: “Know the white, guard the black.” It also says: “Returning to the root is called stillness; stillness is called the restoration of life.” The Mysterious One is the original life of the self. The Perfected One is born and guards it; guarding it to the utmost stillness, he obtains it and guards it, never to lose it again.\n\nThe *Huangting Jing* says: “Refine the hun-soul and po-soul with the Mysterious and Primordial One. The One as a thing is suddenly seen. Only when one attains the utmost truth does it turn its gaze; it most abhors the dead qi of defilement and baseness.”\n\nIt is said: Human life arises from the formless and becomes manifest. Thus, spirit transforms qi, and qi transforms essence—this is the way of employing the formed. The wise do not expend these outwardly but apply them to themselves, so that essence reverts to qi, qi reverts to spirit, and refining the spirit to merge with the Dao, one reattains the wondrousness of the formless. This is the method of returning to the root and restoring life, the art of cultivating truth and nurturing life.\n\nMencius said: “Whether one dies young or lives long, one does not waver; one cultivates the self and awaits it. This is how one establishes life.” One who knows fate does not stand beneath a crumbling wall. Kong Mou said: “At fifty, one knows the Mandate of Heaven; one who does not know the Mandate cannot be a noble person.” Liuzi said: “People receive the mean of Heaven and Earth to live—this is what is called fate.”\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “Exhaust the principles and fulfill one’s nature to reach fate.” It also says: “The sages created the *Changes* to accord with the principles of nature and fate.” And again: “The noble person acts according to the law and awaits fate; he dwells in ease and awaits fate.”\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius: “What are human fate and nature?” The Master said: “What is allotted by division and the Dao is called fate.” The *Neiguan Jing* says: “Receiving life from the Dao is called fate.” Mencius said: “The mouth’s desire for flavors, the eyes’ desire for colors, the ears’ desire for sounds, the nose’s desire for scents, and the four limbs’ desire for ease and comfort are nature, but there is fate in them. The noble person does not call them nature.”",

      "translated_text": "Chengzi said: “The five desires are nature, yet there is allotment in them, and one cannot always have one’s wishes—this is fate.” This fate refers to the principle of bestowal.\n\n*Cloud Palace Dharma Words*, Volume One concludes.\n*Cloud Palace Dharma Words*, Volume Two.\nCompiled by Jishui Xuyi, Master Jing’an, Wang Kesun.\n\n**Chapter Four: Cultivating Goodness**\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: “The human heart is perilous; the Dao-heart is subtle. Only through refinement and unity can one truly grasp the center.”\n\nMencius said: “The great person does not lose the heart of an infant.” This means purity and absence of falsity.\n\nThe *Great Learning* says: “To rectify the heart: if the body harbors anger or resentment, it cannot be rectified; if there is fear, it cannot be rectified; if there is fondness for pleasure, it cannot be rectified; if there is worry or distress, it cannot be rectified. When the heart is not present, one sees yet does not see, hears yet does not hear, eats yet does not know the taste—this is how cultivating the self lies in rectifying the heart.”\n\nMencius said: “Grasp it and it remains; abandon it and it perishes. It comes and goes without fixed time, and none knows its direction—this is what is meant by the heart.” He also said: “At forty, my heart did not waver.” And again: “There is no better way to nurture the heart than to reduce desires.” And: “The way of learning and inquiry is nothing other than seeking the lost heart.”\n\nThe *Explanation of the Dipper Classic* says: “When a person’s heart roams outward, the spirit wanders and departs. When the heart is settled inward, the spirit rests in harmony. All good and evil reside in the heart. The heart is the abode of spirit and brightness; in action and stillness, in movement and rest, in good and evil, when desires arise, it knows all. Can the deluded heart of man not be stilled?” It also says: “Man’s primordial destiny is outwardly lodged in the eyes and inwardly stored in the heart. The eyes look outward upon the ten thousand things, while the heart races inward among the ten thousand affairs. Where heart and eyes race, the spirit also rushes—hence it is called primordial destiny.” To cease the galloping of horses and return to manure is like one who gathers the heart and returns to illumination, preserving the mysterious spirit within oneself.\n\nThe *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: “The Tathāgata often declares that all dharmas are created by the mind, and all causes and effects take form through the mind.”\n\nZhang Wujin said: “To realize this deluded heart is to be the pure, tranquil Buddha-nature.”\n\nThe precepts say: “The heart is the origin of the ten thousand dharmas, the master of the nine orifices. It transcends past and present without decay—hence it is said: when the true suchness stirs within, the six consciousnesses flow outward. If it does not incline toward goodness, it inclines toward evil.”\n\nThe *Classic of Purity and Stillness* says: “Once there is a deluded heart, it startles the spirit; once the spirit is startled, it clings to the ten thousand things; once it clings to the ten thousand things, it generates craving; once craving arises, there is affliction.”\n\nThe *Classic of Fixed Observation* says: “When the awakened heart arises, extinguish it at once. Extinguish only the moving heart, not the illuminating heart. Simply congeal the empty heart, not the abiding heart.”\n\nThe *Vajracchedikā Sūtra* says: “The past heart cannot be obtained, the present heart cannot be obtained, the future heart cannot be obtained.”\n\nThe Sixth Patriarch said: “The deluded heart is but a shadow upon the true heart.”\n\nThe scripture says: “Your body, your heart—all are manifestations within the wondrous luminous nature.” To know that all hearts are not the true heart is to know the essence of the heart. If it is the deluded heart, there is past, present, and future; if it is the true nature, it is utterly still and unmoving.\n\n**The foregoing discusses the heart.**\n\nHengqu said: “The heart governs nature and emotion.” He also said: “To be spiritually luminous and undimmed is the heart; to possess this principle fully, without the slightest lack, is nature; to respond to stimuli is emotion.”\n\nYi said: “From the Great Void comes the name *qi*; from the transformation of *qi* comes the name *Dao*; the union of void and *qi* gives the name *nature*; the union of nature and awareness gives the name *heart*. That which is numinous is the heart; that which is real is nature.”\n\nThe *Tang Announcement* says: “Only the August Lord-on-High bestows the center upon the people below, as if there were a constant nature.”\n\nYi Yin said: “Habit and nature become one.”\n\nZu Yi said: “Not anticipating the Mandate of Heaven.”\n\nMencius spoke of the goodness of nature—this is entirely about principle.\n\nThe *Doctrine of the Mean* says: “What Heaven confers is called nature.” This refers to both humans and other beings. Where there is the Mandate of Heaven, there must be this *qi* to bear this principle. Without this *qi*, how could this principle be suddenly manifested?\n\nChengzi said: “To discuss nature without discussing *qi* is incomplete; to discuss *qi* without discussing nature is unclear.”\n\nThe *Reflections on Things at Hand* says: “The heart is one: when referring to its substance, it is still and unmoving; when referring to its function, it responds and thoroughly communicates.”\n\nZhu Xi said: “In stillness, it is ever aware; in movement, it is ever correct. The wonder of the heart lies in its stillness that responds and its response that returns to stillness.”\n\nConfucius spoke of nature being near and habit distant. Mencius spoke of fully realizing the heart to know nature, preserving the heart and nurturing nature to serve Heaven.\n\nMencius said: “Humaneness in father and son, righteousness in ruler and minister, propriety in host and guest, wisdom in the worthy, the sage’s relation to the Way of Heaven—these are fate, yet they are also nature. The noble person does not call them fate.”\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “Exhaust the principles and fulfill one’s nature to reach fate.” It also says: “The sages created the *Changes* to accord with the principles of nature and fate.”\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius: “What are human fate and nature?” “To be shaped by the One is called nature.” Each person receives from yin and yang a nature of hardness or softness—hence it is said to be shaped by the One.\n\nThe *Neiguan Jing* says: “To receive form from the One is called nature.”\n\nZhu Xi said: “Nature is the Supreme Ultimate, the undifferentiated whole—initially, it cannot be expressed in words.”\n\n**The foregoing discusses heart and nature.**\n\nIn the preceding sections, the Confucians speak of preserving the heart and nurturing nature, while Daoists and Buddhists speak of illuminating the heart and seeing nature. The Confucians take concrete principle as nature, manifesting it in action. Daoists and Buddhists take natural non-action as nature.",

The noble person does not call them nature.”",

      "translated_text": "I would suggest that the Daoist and Buddhist discourse on nature refers to the \"centrality before arousal,\" while the Confucian discourse on nature refers to \"all that is aroused being in accord with the standard.\" To see one’s nature is called the Dao, just as to see one’s nature is called seeing the Buddha. The Buddha’s term *jue* (awakening) surely does not refer to the Buddha as carved from clay or wood.\n\n**Chapter Five: On the Application of Principles**\n\nYan Yuan said: “Shun—what sort of man was he? What sort of man am I? He who exerts himself will also be like this.” The Master said: “To know and yet not act is not as good as not knowing.” The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* says: “I do not slight you; you shall all become Buddhas.” *Fo* (Buddha) is the title of the sage of the Western lands. The Sixth Patriarch said: “Those who do not awaken are sentient beings, common folk; those who awaken are called Buddhas.” *Buddha* means “great awakening.” People receive the qi of Heaven and Earth and are born, sharing this goodness. Yet awakening comes sooner or later; those who awaken later must emulate the actions of those who awaken earlier, thereby illuminating goodness and returning to their original state. This saying is most profound.\n\nThe sage knows from birth and acts with ease, never tiring of learning. The worthy learn and then know, striving to act. Those who are beset by difficulties yet do not learn—such people are the lowest. Master Zeng examined himself thrice daily; loyalty and reciprocity form a single thread. The noble person thinks ninefold, stands in awe of three things, and guards against three dangers. Master Yan mastered the four “do nots.” Confucius cut off four things, maintained the measuring square, and was cautious in solitude. These are all the daily practices one should uphold.\n\nSincerity of intention means not deceiving oneself. The one thing is sincerity alone—this is called “without delusion.” To be sincere is not to deceive; this is secondary. Kangjie said: “The prior Heaven is governed by sincerity. Utmost sincerity can communicate with the divine luminaries; without sincerity, one cannot attain the Dao.” Sincerity is the instrument of the master of nature, boundless and without direction. The way of utmost sincerity can foreknow. It is said: “In me there is not a shred of private falsity, thus I am ever empty and luminous, naturally able to see.” Sincerity is the Dao of Heaven; to be sincere is the Dao of humanity. Sincerity is to hit the mark without effort, to attain without thought, to be at ease in the central Dao—this is the sage. To be sincere is to choose goodness and hold fast to it.\n\n“From sincerity to clarity” is called nature; “from clarity to sincerity” is called teaching. Sincerity leads to clarity; clarity leads to sincerity. Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can fully realize its nature. It can assist in the transformation and nourishment of Heaven and Earth, and stand alongside them. It is also said: “Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can transform the sincere.” The beginning and end of things—without sincerity, there are no things. Utmost sincerity is without ceasing; without ceasing, it endures. Enduring without limit. Only the utmost sincerity under Heaven can order the great warp of the world, establish the great root of the world, and know the transformation and nourishment of the world—how could it rely on anything? The great warp is the five relations of human ethics; the great root is the complete substance of nature. The sage’s ultimate understanding is without delusion; his natural functioning—how could it rely on anything to be able?\n\nThe *Book of Songs* says: “The Mandate of Heaven—profound and unceasing.” This is to say: that by which King Wen was called Wen—ah! How illustrious! King Wen’s virtue was pure, pure and unceasing. It also says: “Reverent and majestic was King Wen, ever bright and respectful.” The *Book of Changes* says: “The movement of Heaven is strong; the noble person thereby strengthens himself unceasingly.” The *Inscription on Tang’s Basin* says: “If you renew yourself for a day, renew yourself daily, and renew yourself yet again.”\n\nHui’s character was such that he chose the Mean, and having obtained one goodness, he held it fast in his breast and never lost it. The Dao cannot be departed from for even a moment; that which can be departed from is not the Dao.\n\nThe Most High Lord Lao and Master Fu drilled a wooden awl in the stone chamber of Mount Jiao, piercing a stone plate five feet thick; after forty-nine years, the stone was penetrated. Mencius said: “To expose it for a day and then freeze it for ten—nothing can grow thus.” The earlier Confucians said: “The single word *jing* (reverence) is how the sage’s learning is accomplished, beginning and ending in it.” Master Cheng spoke of reverence as “focusing on one thing without distraction.” He also said: “Utmost sincerity is without ceasing; sincerity is true and without delusion.”\n\nThe human heart is prone to dissipation and carelessness; if one does not establish a rule to maintain it, constantly raising vigilance, it will become dissolute and have nowhere to return. Only by focusing on one thing, only by utmost sincerity, can one begin well and end well. I would say: the trouble with people is starting and stopping. The Buddhist teachings also call this “severance and constancy.” For example, steaming sand will never become rice. The Chan school’s method of “ever-wakeful” requires that thought follow upon thought without interruption. Thus it is said: “Advance bravely and diligently without retreat.” This is also well said, and accords with the Confucian “focusing on one thing without ceasing.” Sincerity and reverence must not depart from the body for even a moment.\n\n**Chapter Six: On Attaining the Subtle**\n\nThe *Avataṃsaka Hymn* says:\nThe physical body is not the Buddha,\nNor is sound.\nYet without leaving the physical body,\nOne sees the Buddha’s supernatural power.\n\nZhuangzi said: “The noble person sits as a corpse yet appears like a dragon; is silent as the abyss yet thunders. When the spirit moves, Heaven follows. At ease and without action.” Guangchengzi said: “The essence of the utmost Dao is dark and obscure; the ultimate of the utmost Dao is dim and silent. Without seeing, without hearing, embrace the spirit in stillness. The body will then right itself, and must be pure and clear.”\n\nThe *Heart Sūtra of the Prajñāpāramitā* says: “Illuminating, one sees that the five aggregates are all empty.” The *Scripture of Ascending the Mystery* says: “Purify the six senses and cut off evil obstructions.” The *Scripture of Attaining the Dao* says: “Inwardly observe with heart and eyes; the true qi that is there is pure, luminous, empty, and bright.” It also hymns:\nDark and obscure, the pure Dao;\nDim and silent, the great void.\nThe substance and nature are serene, without abode;\nForm and heart are both still—one true source.\n\nThe *Scripture of Original Conduct* says: “When all thoughts do not arise, the myriad conditions suddenly cease. The evil karma of dust and sand dissipates with each thought; all heavenly demons naturally perish.” The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says: “If a person can always be pure and still, Heaven and Earth all return to him.”",

Tracing beginnings and returning to endings, one knows the discourse on death and life.”\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius about this. The Master said: “Transformation ends in yin and yang. Manifesting form and issuing forth is called life—endless generation and transformation. When the reckoning is exhausted, it is called death. Thus life is the beginning of one’s nature, and death is the end of life. Where there is a beginning, there must be an end.”\n\nThe Master also said: “Not yet understanding life, how can one understand death?”\n\nYue Tian said: “Death is the end of reckoning.”\n\nMencius said: “One who dies having fully realized the Way dies a proper death. One who dies in shackles does not die a proper death. Those who understand fate do not stand beneath crumbling walls.”\n\nThe *Book of Documents* says: “Many former sagely kings of Yin are in Heaven.” The commentary explains: “Many enlightened and wise kings of the Shang dynasty—with their refined spirits—are in Heaven.”\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “The wandering soul undergoes transformation.” And again: “Know the conditions of ghosts and spirits.” And: “To fathom the spirit and know transformation is the height of virtue.”\n\nThe Master said: “The virtue of ghosts and spirits—how abundant it is! Invisible when looked for, inaudible when listened for, yet pervading all things without omission. It makes the people of the world fast, purify, and dress in fine robes to offer sacrifices—overflowing, as if above them, as if beside them. The advent of the spirits—how unfathomable! How could one treat them lightly?”\n\nThe subtlety made manifest, the sincerity that cannot be concealed—such is this. Earlier Confucians cited the *Book of Rites*: “The feudal lords, following their state’s sacrifices, offer to those in their state without descendants, such as the Grand Duke of Qi’s enfeoffment in Qi. They sacrifice to the Shangjiu clan, Jikuai, Feng Boling, the Pugu clan, and the like—former lords of that land, now included in the rites. For example, the Marquis of Wei dreamed of Kang Shu saying, ‘You are usurping my offerings.’ Since Wei later moved its capital to Diqiu, and the Xia ruler Xiang also had his capital at Diqiu, it was fitting to sacrifice there. If not, the spirits would resent it. Another example: the Marquis of Jin dreamed of a yellow bear entering his bedchamber, which he took to be the spirit of Gun. Such cases are of this kind. It is not that only those with descendants have the principle of spiritual resonance. Even without descendants, their qi has not perished. Now, when we sacrifice to Gou Mang, though he is distant, since it is fitting to sacrifice to him, his qi is present. In essence, the qi of Heaven, Earth, and humanity is one and the same. Thus it is said: ‘Overflowing, as if above them, as if beside them.’ The vast emptiness is replete with nothing but this principle—it is for people to perceive it vividly.”\n\nZhu Xi of Hui’an said: “The exhalation and inhalation of mouth and nose are the *hun*; the clarity of ears and eyes is the *po*. The yang *hun* is spirit; the yin *po* is ghost. In humans, when yin and yang unite, the *po* congeals and the *hun* gathers, giving rise to life. When yin and yang part, the *hun* ascends as spirit, and the *po* descends as ghost. In terms of coming and going: what comes is just unfolding as spirit; what goes is already receding as ghost. The division of the two qi is the movement of one qi.”\n\nThus, Confucius’ *Sacrificial Rites* says: “Qi is the abundance of spirit; *po* is the abundance of ghost.” Zheng’s commentary says: “Qi is the breath that goes in and out. The acuity of ears and eyes is the *po*. Thus, one cannot yet speak of ghosts and spirits in terms of yin and yang—it is the numinosity of yin and yang that is ghosts and spirits. The *po* is the spirit of form; the *hun* is the spirit of qi. *Hun* and *po* are the essence of form and qi; their clarity is called *ling*.”\n\nThe other night, discussing cultivation, I spoke of the turmoil at death—knowing the meaning of *xunhao* (the qi that assails one) is most urgent. When its qi brushes against a person, one clearly knows the meaning of sorrow and desolation. The shrine of Emperor Wu’s Lady Li says: “Its wind was solemn.” Now, in villages where many households gather to offer sacrifices, there may be a solemn wind like a gust—commonly called a whirlwind—this is the same idea. When foul qi strikes a person, it makes one fearful and desolate—this is the refined spirit of things.\n\nThe Way of Heaven flows and operates, giving birth to and nurturing the myriad things. Humans receive it and thus have life. The clear part of qi is qi; the illuminated part is substance. Consciousness and movement are the work of yang; physical form is the work of yin. Qi is *hun*; form is *po*. The Buddhists take nature as *hun* and illusion as *po*.\n\nGao You’s commentary on the *Huainanzi* says: “The *hun* is the spirit of yang; the *po* is the spirit of yin. Because they govern form and qi, they are called spirits. What gives rise to human life is the gathering of essence and qi. Humans have only so much qi, and there must come a time when it is exhausted. When exhausted, the spirit-qi returns to Heaven, and the form-*po* returns to Earth.”",

The evil karma of dust and sand dissipates with each thought; all heavenly demons naturally perish.” The *Scripture of Purity and Stillness* says: “If a person can always be pure and still, Heaven and Earth all return to him.”",

      "translated_text": "Now the Buddhists take nature as the root and illusion as destiny—this is indeed so. When a person is near death, the warmth of qi gradually fades, which is called the ascent of *hun*; the lower body cools, the light in the eyes dims, which is called the descent of *po*. Where there is life, there must be death; where there is a beginning, there must be an end—what gathers and disperses is qi. As for those who become malevolent spirits, they are people who did not die a proper death, whose qi has not dispersed but instead congeals and transforms into demons.\n\nHui’an’s commentary on Qu Yuan’s *Far Roaming* says: “When *po* does not receive *hun* and *hun* does not bear *po*, then *hun* wanders and *po* descends, and death follows.” He also says: “*Hun* and *po* are like burning incense: the oozing resin is *po*, while the smoke that rises afterward is *hun*. *Hun* is the radiance of *po*; *po* is the root and stem of *hun*. Those who cultivate and refine themselves must ensure that *hun* always clings to *po*, like sunlight carrying the essence of the moon; and that *po* always restrains *hun*, like the moon’s essence receiving sunlight. Then the spirit does not scatter, and *po* does not die, enabling one to ascend as an immortal and journey far upward.\n\nThe *Book of Changes* says: “To be great and transform is called sageliness; to be sagely and unknowable is called spirit.” Spirit has no fixed direction, just as the *Changes* has no fixed form.\n\n*Cloud Palace Dharma Discourses*, Scroll the Lower, concludes.",
