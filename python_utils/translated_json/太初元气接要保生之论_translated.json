  "full_translation": "**The Treatise on Connecting Primordial Qi to Preserve Life**\n\n**Title:** *The Treatise on Connecting Primordial Qi to Preserve Life*\nOne scroll, unattributed, likely composed during the Song dynasty.\nSource text: *Wanli Continuation of the Daoist Canon*\n\nWhen heaven and earth were yet undivided, the primordial chaos held all in embrace. The primordial qi congealed to give birth to water—for water is the origin of qi, the ancestor of cinnabar, the master of the Five Phases, and the root of the myriad things. In the refinement of returning cinnabar, one must obtain the true water of Unity, entering the Flowery Pond, whereupon yin and yang interact and fuse to form the sacred embryo. To know this water is to illuminate the source of the Dao—it is black lead. Thus, black lead is no ordinary substance: it is the divine water of the Dark Heaven, born before heaven and earth, transformed from the mother of the myriad things. It is the essence of true Unity, the root of heaven and earth. From this essence and qi, heaven, earth, the Five Phases, and the myriad things are produced—how could the杂物 generated *after* heaven and earth be called true lead? This true essence corresponds above to the stars, named true lead, ever harmonizing with the flowing pearls of the Great Yang to nourish the myriad things. Thus, gold is born from water, called white gold—the very foundation of returning cinnabar, wherein all is fulfilled.\n\nMaster Wang Dao said: \"White gold is born from water; it is true mercury. This true mercury, existing before the separation of unity, gives rise to the Great Ultimate, containing the Five, Four, Three, Two, and One. When yang is clear and yin turbid, lead and mercury divide. This is the art of inverting yin and yang, and through its use, the myriad things all revolve.\" Now, water is the primordial qi of heaven and earth, the original essence of yin and yang, and from it is born silver, called white gold—this is the generation of something from nothing, the foundation of the returning cinnabar’s transformation.\n\nThe Perfected One of the Wang Ding said: \"Returning cinnabar is originally a formless thing; apart from this true silver, there is no truth.\" The sages, knowing that this white gold is born from water, gathered it as the foundation of the elixir. In the work of advancing the Dao, one must understand the four seasons, eight solar terms, twenty-four qi, seventy-two pentads, and the hundred divisions of day and night—all encompassed within the teachings of *daoyin*. By mastering these qi and seasons, one remains free from calamity and extends life indefinitely.\n\nWhen encountering the *Lichun* (Beginning of Spring) after the first month’s solar term, each day during the *zi* and *chou* hours, press the hands against the inner kidneys, turn the body, and stretch thirty-five times, exhaling, inhaling, rinsing, and swallowing at will. If one can fully apply this effort, though it may not suffice to achieve the great Dao, it can disperse illnesses of stagnant wind in the eyebrows, back, meridians, and neck, leaving the body light and strong.\n\nDuring the first month, each day at the *zi* and *chou* hours, press the hands against the abdomen and turn left and right thirty-five times, drawing the primordial qi upward into the Flowery Pond. Exhale, inhale, rinse, and swallow nine times at will, then unite with the lower cinnabar field. If one can fully apply this effort without negligence, it can dispel obstructions in the *sanjiao* meridians and channels, leaving the body light and free from difficulty.\n\nAfter the second month’s solar term, each day at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit in stillness and purify the qi for a quarter-hour. Clench the fists, turn the neck five or six times, and with tranquil effort, seal and gather the qi upward. Inhale, rinse, and swallow two or three times at will, then return to the original ancestral palace for harmony. Exhale slowly, and the body will be healthy, free from accumulations in the kidneys and lungs. Thus, the body will be strong and movement light.\n\nDuring the second month, each day at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit in stillness and regulate the qi for a quarter-hour. Pull with the left and right hands six or seven times each, drawing the ancestral qi upward into the Flowery Pond. Slowly inhale three times in three degrees, descending fire at will to disperse fullness and distension in the chest and abdomen. With prolonged practice, longevity is extended.\n\nAfter the *Qingming* (Clear and Bright) solar term in the third month, at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit upright and pull forward with the left and right hands, drawing the ancestral qi seven or eight times. Spit out the turbid and swallow the clear two or three times. Perform this effort three to five times, and it will eliminate stagnant accumulations in the waist, kidneys, and stomach. How could one’s lifespan not increase?\n\nDuring the third month, each day at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit level and alternate the left and right hands, lifting and shifting the kidneys three to five times each. Swallow the Flowery Pond’s water into the middle cinnabar field two or three times, which can dispel stasis in the spleen and stomach. With prolonged effort, the body will be peaceful, light, and strong.\n\nAt the *Lixia* (Beginning of Summer) solar term in the fourth month, each day at the *yin* and *mao* hours, hold the breath and close the eyes. Reverse and alternate the hands five to seven times, then rest the qi for half a quarter-hour. Draw the ancestral qi upward into the Flowery Pond, sip the water, and swallow the fluid. Apply the effort daily without rest to disperse wind-dampness in the back and arms. With constant practice, the whole body will be light and strong.\n\nDuring the fourth month, each day at the *yin* and *mao* hours, sit in stillness for a quarter-hour. Point the left hand toward the sky and press the right hand against the chest, drawing the qi upward into the Twelve-Storied Tower three to five times. Let the swallowed fluid flow downward continuously, harmonizing yin and yang to disperse long-standing accumulations in the lungs and navel. With unwavering effort, illnesses will vanish, and the body will be strong.\n\nAt the fifth month’s solar term, each day at the *yin* and *mao* hours, stand upright, tilt the body backward, and raise both hands upward. Exchange the qi from the back, lifting five to seven times. Stabilize the breath and return to the palace, swallowing the fluid at will to eliminate accumulations in the waist and kidneys, leaving the body light and healthy.\n\nDuring the fifth month, each day at the *yin* and *mao* hours, sit in stillness, extend one foot backward, and stretch the other forward. Inhale the clear and swallow the fluid several times to completion. Apply the effort at will to dispel all wind-cold, leaving the body clear and the qi refreshed.\n\nAt the sixth month’s solar term, each day at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit and stabilize the breath for half a quarter-hour. Move both hands to the lower cinnabar field, extend both feet straight, and regulate three to five times. The primordial attacks upward, uniting with the true water of the Flowery Pond, the ancestor of the life root. Swallow the fluid seven times to disperse accumulations, leaving the body healthy and strong.\n\nDuring the sixth month, each day at the *chou* and *yin* hours, clench the fists against the knees, performing the *daoyin* of the dragon and tiger’s liver and lungs. Draw the qi upward to the heart three to five times each, then descend the Flowery Pond’s water three times. When the liver and lungs’ dragon and tiger unite and harmonize, fully applying the effort, back illnesses will not arise, and the effects will be as if one has attained the Two Primordials.\n\nFor the seventh month’s solar term, each day at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit upright. With both hands, grasp and hold the root-ancestor, close the breath, and raise the qi to surge upward, drawing the Flowery Pond’s water downward in three to five mouthfuls. Visualize the two correspondences uniting in harmony, then lower the hands three to five times. Thus, all laborious accumulations will be dispelled.\n\nDuring the mid-seventh month, at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit upright for a time. Turn the head left and right, swaying twenty-four times, and guide the ancestral qi upward. Exhale the phlegm-fire from the mouth, expelling malign influences so that illness does not arise.\n\nAfter the eighth month’s solar term, each day at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit in clarity. Press both hands upon the knees and rub gently, focusing the mind on the ancestral qi. Circulate and guide it upward to the Pond, then swallow the fluid three times. This may dispel ailments of the lower back and waist, harmonizing the body’s primordial streams.\n\nDuring the mid-eighth month, at the *chou* hour, sit cross-legged, cover the ears with both hands, and sway the body left and right. Draw the ancestral qi upward to the Flowery Pond three to five times, then swallow the fluid. This may avert afflictions of the face and waist, brightening the eyes and sharpening the spirit.\n\nFor the ninth month’s solar term, at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit upright. Raise both arms, spring the body upward, and hold the breath to ascend into the Pond. Swallow the fluid seven times, and all heart-fire will be dispelled, phlegm and stagnation dissolved. With prolonged practice, one merges with the true Dao.\n\nDuring the mid-ninth month, at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit in stillness. Hold the lower cinnabar field firmly with both hands, allowing the ancestral qi to remain clear and tranquil—neither rising nor falling. Circulate and regulate the water, harmonizing yin and yang. Proceeding gently, no illness will arise.\n\nFor the tenth month’s solar term, at the *chou* and *yin* hours, clasp the waist with both hands, stabilize the primordial spirit, and lift the kettle to irrigate the crucible. When water and fire achieve balance, the qi circulates through the microcosmic orbit. Tilt the face toward the heavens, inhale three breaths, and extinguish the calamity of fire and phlegm. With consistent practice, how could phlegm not be expelled and longevity not be attained?\n\nDuring the mid-tenth month, at the *chou* and *yin* hours, sit upright to cultivate qi. Follow the breath without exhaling or ascending, stillness yielding clarity. Illuminate the mind and perceive the nature. Swallow the fluid once, then inhale five times, invigorating the body and strengthening its health.\n\nFor the eleventh month’s solar term, rise at the *zi* and *chou* hours. Extend both hands upward, strain the feet, and draw the qi into the navel five times. Repeat the cycle seven times. The qi will be refreshed, the spirit invigorated. With prolonged practice, the immortal Dao is not distant.\n\nDuring the mid-eleventh month, at the *zi* and *chou* hours, sit upright with legs extended. Cross the hands and guide the ancestral qi upward to the Water Pond for union. Swallow the fluid twice, naturally relaxing the center as the solitary yang pervades. Practicing this in stages, the body will be peaceful and health enhanced.\n\nAfter the twelfth month’s solar term, at the *zi* and *chou* hours, sit upright in tranquil practice. With one hand, embrace the root-ancestor, and with the other, circulate the navel. Let the qi flow vibrantly, neither releasing nor restraining, smoothly harmonizing the root-ancestor. After three to five repetitions, follow the method without deviation to nurture life for distant longevity.\n\nDuring the mid-twelfth month, at the *zi* and *chou* hours, lie down with the face outward. Draw the knees to the chest, regulate the breath with three exhalations, and swallow the fluid once. Repeat this three times ninefold. If the practice is fully realized, the meridians will flow purely. Even if great achievement is not attained, illness may still be dispelled, and peace secured.\n\nWith prolonged practice, life may extend to a hundred years. Within this profound mystery lies the method of replenishing life, augmenting longevity, and aiding the Dao—a technique commonly called the \"oil-adding\" method. Scholars may savor and reflect upon it, examining it deeply to awaken and transcend the mundane. After a hundred days of inquiry, one may grasp the mysteries of creation and endure as long as heaven and earth.\n\nThis is a transmitted teaching, not a minor path of peripheral alchemy. Those with innate immortal bones who obtain it should treasure and conceal it. Do not reveal it to the unworthy. The vows within this text are weighty—examine them carefully!\n\nKeep it secret! Most secret!\n\nThe Treatise on the Primordial Qi of the Great Beginning and the Essentials of Preserving Life is hereby concluded.",

With one hand, embrace the root-ancestor, and with the other, circulate the navel. Let the qi flow vibrantly, neither releasing nor restraining, smoothly harmonizing the root-ancestor. After three to five repetitions, follow the method without deviation to nurture life for distant longevity.\n\nDuring the mid-twelfth month, at the *zi* and *chou* hours, lie down with the face outward. Draw the knees to the chest, regulate the breath with three exhalations, and swallow the fluid once. Repeat this three times ninefold. If the practice is fully realized, the meridians will flow purely. Even if great achievement is not attained, illness may still be dispelled, and peace secured.\n\nWith prolonged practice, life may extend to a hundred years. Within this profound mystery lies the method of replenishing life, augmenting longevity, and aiding the Dao—a technique commonly called the \"oil-adding\" method. Scholars may savor and reflect upon it, examining it deeply to awaken and transcend the mundane. After a hundred days of inquiry, one may grasp the mysteries of creation and endure as long as heaven and earth.\n\nThis is a transmitted teaching, not a minor path of peripheral alchemy. Those with innate immortal bones who obtain it should treasure and conceal it. Do not reveal it to the unworthy. The vows within this text are weighty—examine them carefully!\n\nKeep it secret! Most secret!",

Draw the qi upward to the heart three to five times each, then descend the Flowery Pond’s water three times.
