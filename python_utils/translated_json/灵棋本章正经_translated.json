  "full_translation": "**The Orthodox Classic of the Divine Chess: Preface**\n\nThe *Orthodox Classic of the Divine Chess* is a work of uncertain authorship, annotated by Yan Youming of the Jin dynasty and continued by He Chengtian of the Liu-Song dynasty. It comprises two scrolls. The base text is derived from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Tai Xuan* section. Collated versions include Dunhuang manuscript P.4048, volume 719.\n\n**Preface to the *Divine Chess Classic***\n\nThe origins of the *Divine Chess Classic* are unknown. Some say Emperor Wu of Han commanded Dongfang Shuo to employ it, and none of his ancient divinations failed—his art relied on this book. Others claim the Yellow Stone Elder bestowed it upon Zhang Liang. Still others recount the esoteric affairs of the Prince of Huainan, also attributing them to this text. Likely, later admirers embellished its reputation to exalt its art, but how could it truly be the work of all these figures?\n\nThough I had long heard of it, I paid it little mind, deeming it not a classic or historical work. By the end of the Kaicheng era, as I prepared to journey to Min, I heard of the Jian River, where rocks barred the surging rapids, and boatmen scaled perilous crags. Even the bravest warriors would sweat and tremble—how much more so a coward like me? As a scholar, I could not resolve my fear.\n\nUpon reaching Si, I encountered my cousin An and confessed my timidity. An said, \"I’ve heard the Jian River is not so treacherous—those tales are exaggerated.\" He possessed a divination book that could dispel doubt, so I asked him to consult it. The oracle read:\n\n*\"Above and below, the heart is at peace,\nNo treachery arises within.\nStand firm, free from care,\nHeed not idle rumors.\"*\n\nI laughed, and indeed, the rumors proved false. An then entrusted the book to me, and I carried it to Min. My journey was untroubled, and I came to trust its wisdom. Whenever I sought answers to other doubts, they were as clear as if I had witnessed them myself.\n\nAlas! What the world dismisses may yet be a supreme treasure, while what it esteems may not be truly fine. A single volume of this book resolved my uncertainties—how could it not be prized?\n\nFrom this, I understood that a scholar’s rise or fall, wealth or poverty, is fated, and cannot be judged by a single path. Examining the book, it seemed the work of one who had attained the Dao. Twelve chess pieces are divided into three sets of four—upper, middle, and lower—cast to form a hexagram, then matched to the text to reveal its meaning.\n\nThe upper four represent Heaven, the middle four Humanity, and the lower four Earth—the trinity of the Three Powers. Each of the twelve pieces bears an inscription, akin to the judgments of the *Zhou Changes*. Cast together, they form a hexagram, hence the name *Divine Chess*.\n\nLater, while serving as an official in Fuzhou, I had ample leisure. I gathered dozens of versions, collated and corrected them, removing errors and preserving truth, compiling them here. Future scholars may study it without doubt.\n\nDuring my time in Min, the distance from my homeland stretched thousands of miles across land and water, leaving me uneasy. One day, I cast the pieces and obtained the hexagram *\"The Broad Way of Heaven\"*, its words most auspicious. I trusted its promise. Yet, days after leaving Min, an imperial decree summoned me as an imperial censor. The divination had foretold this—was it not divine?\n\nWritten in the ninth month of autumn, the ninth year of Huichang, by Li Yuan, Gentleman for Ceremonial Service of the Ministry of Justice.\n\n---\n\nThe *Divine Chess Classic* is a legacy of the Yellow Stone Elder. Some say it is Dongfang Shuo’s method of divination. Others claim it was composed by Zhang Liang or the Prince of Huainan, Liu An, annotated by Yan Youming of the Jin and He Chengtian of the Song, with a preface by Li Yuan of the Tang. Transmitted through the ages as the Yellow Stone Elder’s work, the *Bibliographic Treatise of the Tang Dynasty*’s *Five Elements* section records only its title.\n\nIts method employs twelve round pieces carved from jujube wood struck by lightning. The oracles number one hundred and twenty-four. Four pieces symbolize Heaven, inscribed with \"upper\"; four symbolize Humanity, inscribed with \"middle\"; and four symbolize Earth, inscribed with \"lower.\" After prayer, they are cast, and the oracle is consulted to determine fortune or misfortune.\n\nThe *History of the Southern Qi* records Jiang Mi’s divination, yielding: *\"A guest comes from the south, bestowing fine wealth—treasures, jewels, golden cups, and jade vessels.\"* Yang Wengong’s *Garden of Talks* records that in the first year of Xianping, while seeking an external appointment, he cast three upper, two middle, and one lower pieces, matching Jiang Mi’s oracle. At the time, the compilation of the *Veritable Records of Taizong* was unfinished, so his request was denied. Soon after, he was appointed as an envoy for a prince’s birthday and received gifts of silver vessels. Later, he cast again, obtaining four middle and three lower pieces, the *\"Avoiding the World\"* oracle, which read:\n\n*\"Petty men prevail,\nNoble ones lose the Way.\nLeave my home,\nEnter the deep grass.\"*\n\nHe indeed fell ill and returned to Yangdi. Other divinations were equally accurate, but each casting pertained to a single matter—repeating it yielded no result. As the saying goes: *\"To profane is to receive no answer; divination is not repeated.\"*\n\nZhu Xi, in his discussions with Lin Zhengqing on the *Changes*, remarked: \"Recently, someone asked about the *Changes*. I replied, 'Have you seen the *Divine Chess* oracles? The *Changes* is much the same.'\" Observing the prefaces and annotations from the Jin, Song, and Tang dynasties, as well as the words of two Song masters, one trusts it as an ancient text. Great sacrifices to the divine tortoise, divination methods—all are preserved. Even methods like milfoil stalks or tile divination are usable; how much more so an ancient text from the Qin and Han?\n\nAlas! The ruler’s mandate extends across the vast heavens; the sun’s brilliance endures as if present. Above, as if present; beside, as if present—such is the power of the spirits. Knock, and they respond; move them, and they commune. Is not the spirit of the heart worthy of reverence?\n\nMaster Zhang Nanxuan, during a drought in Bagui, cast the pieces under the scorching sun and obtained the sixty-second oracle, *\"Yin Prolongs\"*:\n\n*\"Water deep in the courtyard,\nBoats row beneath the hall.\"*\n\nSoon after, heavy rain fell. This is recorded in his *Recorded Sayings*.\n\nThis book was once in my late father’s collection. Its oracles distinguish yin and yang, odd and even; only when yang prevails over yin is it auspicious.\n\nThrough one’s own sincerity and devotion, none fails to receive a response.\n\nThe *Divine Chess Classic* was originally transmitted by the Marquis of Liu to the Yellow Stone Master during the Han, enabling foreknowledge of events yet to come. Initially used for divining the times, deploying troops, and setting out on journeys, it proved infallible. By the reign of Emperor Wu, Dongfang Shuo was ordered to test its accuracy across myriad affairs, and it invariably struck true. Some say the Eight Masters employed this method, passing it to the King of Huainan; a retainer from Huainan later obtained it, guarding it in secrecy so that none might receive it.\n\nBy the Tai Kang era of the Jin, the Daoist adept Chang Fahe of Xiangcheng declared: An old man clad in yellow hempen robes appeared, bearing this book in a bamboo tube, and bestowed it upon Fahe. Fahe then transmitted it to the world.\n\nIts method employs twelve pieces made from thunderstruck wood, or catalpa, jujube, or sandalwood, each one cun and two fen in diameter, three fen in thickness. Four pieces are inscribed with the *upper* character, four with the *middle* character, and four with the *lower* character.\n\nWhen divining, one must first compose the spirit, purify with incense, don proper attire, and sit in stillness. After a moment of focused contemplation, hold the twelve casting pieces with reverence, exhale upon them, and offer a prayer. Then cast all twelve pieces at once, arranging the resulting *upper*, *middle*, and *lower* characters in sequence to form a hexagram. Discard any scattered pieces and consult the manual to interpret the outcome. For each matter divined, cast the pieces only once—repeated casting renders fortune and misfortune uncertain.\n\nDuring the Song era, Wang Yin and his brothers, along with He Chengtian, deliberated upon this classic. Those who approached it with sincere devotion invariably found its judgments accurate. Yet many, failing to grasp its subtle principles, dismissed it as ineffective and treated it with disdain. He who discerns the incipient knows more than half the truth; he who remains unaware of the incipient misjudges even the slightest movement. To know both the incipient and the movement is to comprehend more than half the Way. Whether one withdraws or advances, accepts or rejects, these paths diverge—one cannot assume that a single auspicious phrase confirms predestined fate.\n\nThus, \"In the northeast, friends are lost,\" yet in the end, there is cause for celebration. \"The traveler gains an ox,\" but this portends disaster for the villagers. \"Darkness in *Mingyi*,\" \"Greatness in *Feng*’s upper trigram\"—these cannot be discussed as equals. The hexagrams, divided into *upper*, *middle*, and *lower*, embody the *Yijing*’s principle of the Three Powers. Through permutations, they yield a total of one hundred twenty-four hexagrams, with odd and even numbers determining fortune and misfortune. Odd numbers are yang, and yang is auspicious; even numbers are yin, and yin is inauspicious. By this method, fortune and misfortune become clear.\n\nThe words accompanying each hexagram are its *yao* text. The diviner must focus solely on their truth or falsehood, for therein virtue and vice are determined. If the meaning of the words does not align with the situation, one should carefully consider their intent. For instance, phrases like \"majestic and resplendent, attaining without seeking\" bode well for matters such as pursuing fugitives or recovering lost items, but not for divining illness or marriage. Similarly, \"A year of prosperity, a month of flourishing—how can one know the stability of Mount Tai?\" suggests that when treading danger, seeking wealth is auspicious, yet for one wandering far from home longing for return, the outcome remains uncertain.\n\nAgain, \"Ruler and minister exchange positions, great fortune arises\"—this is auspicious for the noble person but dire for the petty. Or \"Thieves plunder my home, the worthy conceal themselves and advance\"—this is auspicious for the petty but inauspicious for the noble. All such interpretations must be deduced by analogy. The distinction between noble and petty lies not in rank or power but in orientation: those who turn toward the Dao are noble, while those who turn away are petty. The wise employ this method without confusion.\n\n\"For whatever doubts reside in the heart, simply speak them aloud.\"\n\n#9 \"Whenever one wishes to divine, one must first compose the spirit, purify with incense, don proper attire, and sit in stillness. After a moment of focused contemplation, take up the twelve divination pieces and, with reverent heart, exhale and invoke them.\"\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: \"Each time one performs divination, one must first purify with incense and sit in quietude for a while. Then, holding the pieces, recite the incantation: *'Earthly servant so-and-so humbly invokes the gods of the Four First Months, the gods of the Four Mid-Seasons, the gods of the Four Seasons, the Twelve Celestial Offices—above, I beseech the Heavenly and Earthly Parents, the Supreme Primordial Elders, the Sun and Moon, the Five Planets, the Northern Dipper’s Seven Stars, the Four Seasons and Five Phases, the Six Jia and Yin-Yang, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, and the Year’s Bright Hall: so-and-so harbors doubts in the heart and requests a decision. If auspicious, declare it auspicious; if inauspicious, declare it inauspicious. Of gain or loss, right or wrong, let the forms appear upon the earth. For whatever doubts reside in the heart, simply speak them aloud.'\"\n\n#10 Immediately cast all twelve divination pieces at once, then arrange the resulting \"upper,\" \"middle,\" and \"lower\" characters in sequence to form a hexagram. Discard the stray pieces and consult the manual to interpret it. For each matter divined, cast the pieces once—casting again will render the auspices uncertain.\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: *Cast the pieces to determine \"upper,\" \"middle,\" and \"lower,\" then arrange them into a hexagram to fix the auspices. Once determined, do not divine again, for a second casting will leave the auspices uncertain.*\n\n#11 The hexagram’s \"upper,\" \"middle,\" and \"lower\" positions correspond to the *Yijing*’s principle of the Three Powers. Through permutation, a total of one hundred twenty-four hexagrams are formed, all distinguished by odd and even lines to determine auspices.\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: *The \"upper,\" \"middle,\" and \"lower\" positions embody the principle of the Three Powers. Through permutation, one hundred twenty-four hexagrams are formed, all distinguished by odd and even lines to determine auspices.*\n\n#12 Odd lines are yang, and yang is auspicious. Even lines are yin, and yin is inauspicious. By this principle, the auspices may be discerned.\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: *Odd lines are yang, even lines are yin. By this principle, the auspices may be discerned.*\n\n#13 Then it is fitting.\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: *Fitting.*\n\n#14 For instance, when the signs are towering and resplendent, gains come unbidden. In such cases, divination for matters like pursuing fugitives or recovering lost property is auspicious, but for illness or marriage, it is not.\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: *For example, when the signs are towering and imposing, gains come unbidden. In such cases, divination for pursuit, recovery, or seeking wealth is auspicious, but applying it to illness brings misfortune.*\n\n#15 When treading perilous ground, divining for wealth is auspicious. For those traveling afar who long for a swift return, the signs will indicate they have not yet arrived.\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: *When in distress, divining for wealth or dwelling places is auspicious. For those wandering in distant lands who hope for a quick return, the signs will indicate they have not yet arrived.*\n\n#16 Likewise, when ruler and minister exchange positions and great fortune arises, the noble encountering this will find it auspicious, while the petty will meet great misfortune.\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: *Likewise, when ruler and minister are in their proper places and great fortune arises, the noble encountering this will find it auspicious, while the petty will meet misfortune.*\n\n#17 All must be deduced by category.\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: *Deduce by category to grasp the hexagram’s meaning.*\n\n#18 The terms \"noble\" and \"petty\" are judged by alignment with the Way, not by rank or power. Those who turn toward the Dao are noble; those who turn away are petty. The wise apply this principle and remain free from confusion.\n\nThe Dunhuang version reads: *The terms \"noble\" and \"petty\" are judged by virtue and conduct, not by rank. Those who uphold the Dao are noble; those who abandon it are petty. Those who value benevolence and righteousness while scorning bribes and profit are noble; those who slight trust and righteousness while prizing rank and emolument are petty.*\n\nIn ancient times, before the sages composed the *Yi*, the people used spirit divining blocks, which were modeled after the *Yi*. The Way of the *Yi* is profound and difficult to comprehend, thus they created the symbolic system of spirit blocks. Though it does not exhaust the subtleties of the *Yi*, without mastery of the *Yi*, how could one compose the oracles of the spirit blocks?\n\nThe system of spirit blocks takes three as its warp and four as its weft. The three positions—above, middle, and below—represent Heaven, Humanity, and Earth. They also signify the ruler, the minister, and the people. The four configurations—one as *shaoyang*, three as *taiyang*, two as *shaoyin*, and four as *laoyin*—pair *shaoyang* with *shaoyin* as harmonious, while *taiyang* with *taiyang* becomes adversarial. Harmony brings joy, while adversity sparks conflict—this is the constant Way. Yet sometimes, losing the Way, harmony may invert into enmity; or by aligning with its course, adversity may transform into utility—such are its permutations.\n\nWhen yang prevails, paths align and mutual illumination follows. When yin dominates, intentions diverge and discord arises. This marks the division between the noble and the petty. The alternation of yin and yang, the differentiation of forms, and the shifting of names—such is the Way of the *Yi*. The *Yi* draws its symbols from chariots, buckets, arrows, hares, foxes, and the like; yet by extension, it encompasses all things under Heaven. It speaks of a horse yet signifies a dragon, or names water yet implies transformation—this is the meaning of the *Yi*. Without penetrating the mysteries of all under Heaven, one cannot grasp it. Thus, the spirit blocks were created in emulation of the *Yi*, and only those deeply versed in the *Yi* can master them.\n\nI have always admired the accuracy of its divinations but lamented that interpreters fail to fully convey the author’s intent. Therefore, I have expanded upon its principles and elucidated its meaning.\n\n**Method for Crafting the Blocks**\nUse *pili* wood, catalpa, jujube, or white sandalwood, measuring one *cun* and two *fen* in diameter, three *fen* in thickness, and perfectly round, calibrated to the *zhou* ruler. Cut the wood on a *jiazi* day, inscribe it on a *bingzi* day, carve it on a *wuzi* day, apply cinnabar grains on a *gengzi* day, and store it in a case on a *renzi* day. The case should be made of *ziwei* wood.\n\n**Preparation of Pokeweed (Shanglu)**\nTake any quantity of pokeweed root, pare away the thin outer layer with a bronze knife, and slice it thinly. Soak it in east-flowing water for two nights, then steam it in a steamer, layering it with bean leaves. Steam from noon until midnight, remove the bean leaves, dry the root in the sun, and finely chop it for use as sacrificial jerky.\n\n**Invocation and Incantation**\n*\"Heaven is clear, Earth is tranquil; the River Chart holds its numen. A single censer of sacred incense purifies the ten directions. Three rolls of the ritual drum summon all spirits to heed.\"*\n\n**Prayer**\n*\"Heaven and Earth unite their virtue, sun and moon their brightness; the four seasons keep their order, ghosts and spirits align with fortune and misfortune. August Heaven is impartial, aiding only those with virtue. On this day, in this year, this month, this day, [name and native place], I reverently burn incense and invoke the gods of the Four First Months, the Four Middle Months, the Four Seasons, the Twelve Earthly Branches, the Celestial and Terrestrial Parents, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign, the Sun to the left and Moon to the right, the Five Stars and Northern Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Four Seasons and Five Phases, the Six Jia and Yin-Yang, the Hall of Light and Yearly Virtue, the Twelve Celestial Gods, the Twelve Terrestrial Spirits, the Year, Month, Day, and Hour Officers, and the Attendant Messengers of Merit: I, born at this hour, humbly present my purpose regarding [state matter]. My heart holds a wish, my mind harbors doubt; hesitant and uncertain, I seek your judgment. Favor or ill, fortune or misfortune—let the oracle decide. I reverently await your sagely illumination and manifest response.\"*\n\n**Incantation**\n*\"Om hum hum ma-ni da-li hum cha chi.\"*\nRecite three times in a single breath.\n\nThen cast the twelve blocks at once, forming a hexagram according to the upper, middle, and lower positions. Consult the oracle’s words to determine fortune or misfortune.\n\n**Closing Prayer for Sending Forth the Spirits**\n*\"Having invoked your presence and reverently consulted the spirit blocks, I have received your gracious response. Now I humbly send you forth. May you return adorned with clouds and mist, ascending to your palaces in the celestial vault. As you came, you bestowed grace; as you depart, leave blessings behind. Whenever summoned, return as before.\"*\n\n**Sacrificial Rite**\nOn the seventh day of the first lunar month each year, fast and bathe according to the ritual. By the waterside, prepare a mat, wine, fruit, incense, jerky, and paper candles. Invoke the spirits as previously described, then clasp the left hand in a mudra, bow, and sigh:\n*\"Heaven is clear, Earth is numinous; dragons and tigers hold their power. The Six Jia and Six Ding spirits follow my command. Banish evil, uphold the right, emerging from darkness into light.\"*\n\nI now receive your summons—descend swiftly without delay.\nForm, shadow, sound, and qi shall instantly dissolve into dust.\nDare any resist or defy? Lightning and thunder shall strike them down.\nHasten, hasten, as the statutes command!\n\nOffer three sticks of incense, pour the libation, and bow according to ritual—with utmost sincerity, none shall fail to be moved.\n\n**Prohibitions**\nOn the six *wu* days, divination is forbidden; any attempt will yield no verification.\n\n**Divination Chart of the *Divine Blocks

Jin\nSupplementary Commentary by He Chengtian, Palace Censor-in-Chief of the Song\n\n**Ascending Prosperity** Divination – *Great Passage* Hexagram  1-1-1\n*From small to great, without stumbling or collapse.*\n*From low to high, attaining wealth and eminence.*\n\n*Fitting to journey forth, inauspicious to conceal one’s brilliance.*\nYan says: *Aspiring from small to great may lead to wealth and nobility. If the great aspires to the small, there will be peril and ruin.*\nHe also says: *Heaven and Earth having taken their places, the sage harmonizes with them. Ordering the primordial chaos, inaugurating the origin of creation—thus it is said: from low to high.*\n\n*Establishing merit and creating systems, nothing is not auspicious. Secret schemes and covert plans are inadvisable; the elderly, the ill, and marriage unions are unfavorable, for pure yang is difficult to harmonize. Travelers have not returned; those imprisoned will be released; merchants profit.*\n\nHe says: *For official advancement, visibility is auspicious, concealment inauspicious. The ill should not remain in dark places; it is fortunate to avoid them by going elsewhere. Slander brings no harm; households prosper greatly. Military campaigns are auspicious; battles are victorious. Pregnancies yield sons; fields, silkworms, fishing, and hunting bring great bounty. All is auspicious.*\n\nExplanation: *From small to great—yang begins to grow. Three hearts in accord—journeying forth is fitting. Inauspicious to conceal brilliance—its way is radiant. This divination’s three positions are all yang; lesser yang is just rising, thus the image of ascending from small to great, from low to high. Those who obtain it—whether initiating enterprises, seeking fame, or pursuing profit—all is auspicious. Litigants should seek justice through upright means; travelers are fortunate but have not yet returned. Secretive or deceptive schemes must not be undertaken. The ill will worsen; avoiding them brings fortune.*\n\n**Gradual Peace** Divination – *Receiving Blessings* Hexagram  1-1-2\n*Dwelling in tranquility, establishing one’s enterprise—possessions increase. Both wealthy and noble, though emolument and rank have not yet arrived.*\n\nYan says: *Calm the heart and steady the will to await the seasons—then all will be auspicious. If one seeks hasty fulfillment, it will not come to pass.*\nHe also says: *Yin and yang having taken their rightful places, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is thus attained by humanity. This is the image of settling into one’s vocation. Seeking office, pursuing wealth, managing fields and silkworms—all are auspicious. Marriage is initially difficult but later easy. Travelers will arrive; households are at peace. Legal matters do not come to fruition; imprisoned persons will be released through effort.*\n\nHe says: *Distant travelers arrive; pregnancies yield sons. Legal matters and imprisonment will be absolved by imperial pardon. The ill will not die; all affairs are auspicious.*\n\nExplanation: *Dwelling in tranquility and managing property—firmness and softness are balanced. This is not desired outwardly, yet blessings are received in reality. In this divination, two yang are above and one yin below; the positions of the Three Powers are all fitting. Thus the image of being both wealthy and noble—it is fitting to preserve this and not indulge in insatiable desires, then all will be auspicious. Households and marriages are settled; legal matters encounter no obstruction. Travelers have not returned; seeking office leads to attainment and governance. Hearing of misfortune, one need not grieve; though illness has not yet abated, it brings no harm.*\n\n**Abundant Fortune** Divination – *Auspicious Celebration* Hexagram  1-1-3\n*Resplendent and illustrious, the household possesses gold and silk. Supplies are complete, affairs are settled—without seeking, one obtains.*\n\nYan says: *Having gold and silk, there is no need for seeking. Dwelling at home is auspicious; travelers have not returned.*\nHe also says: *Heaven generates the myriad things—its principle is ever-abundant. Without need for striving, all naturally comes to fruition. This hexagram is pure yang; marriages are not harmonious. The imprisoned are without guilt; fields and silkworms succeed. All other affairs are auspicious.*\n\nHe says: *Travelers are about to arrive; pregnancies yield sons. Merchants profit; legal matters and imprisonment are absolved by pardon. Pursuits and suppressions all succeed.*\n\n**Explication:**\n*Resplendent and illustrious*—this is pure yang. *The household possesses gold and silk*—the earthly Dao shines. *Supplies are complete, affairs are settled*—its power is abundant and strong. *Without seeking, one obtains*—its fruitfulness flourishes. This hexagram has three yang lines with the lower position thriving; the earthly Dao produces things, thus gold and silk overflow and affairs are settled. The fullness of yang is rooted below, while lesser yang rises above—like a tree with a flourishing root and abundant fruit, hence the image of obtaining without seeking. For one who casts this divination, all pursuits are auspicious. Managing property is most favorable; in war, great victory; in pursuit, the fugitive is captured. In litigation, one spends wealth but prevails; in illness, it is inauspicious; those in hiding cannot escape.\n\n---\n\n**Divination – *Abundant Prosperity***\nHexagram 4\n*Abundant wealth, utmost nobility—the Dao of Heaven turns and shifts. Following the course, rising and falling, waxing with the times, waning with the seasons. Descendants by the tens of thousands, by the hundreds of millions.*\n\nYan says: *One who dwells in wealth and nobility yet does not forget poverty and lowliness will have a name that flows to posterity. If one cannot practice humility and retreat, ruin will surely come. Travelers are on the road; it will be long before they return.*\nHe also says: *From the second to the fourth line, the earthly Dao is twice fulfilled. The principle of wealth and nobility reaches its apex here. Yet when fullness is attained, it must wane; when high, it is perilous—hence \"turns and shifts.\" If one follows the ebb and flow of yin and yang, not opposing the times, one can preserve body and reputation, and blessings will extend to descendants. This hexagram favors humility and retreat; prisoners will have difficulty leaving. Those awaiting others will face slight delays; travelers will not depart.*\n\nHe says: *The ill will recover slowly; it is fitting to sacrifice to the heavenly spirits and seek blessings. Marriages and weddings are auspicious; those accumulating wealth should not add further. Distant travel is inadvisable; hasty words may lead to official disputes—it is best to seek those who uphold the law.*\n\n**Explication:**\n*Abundant wealth, utmost nobility*—the household’s enterprise is complete. *Following the course, rising and falling*—to preserve fullness. *Descendants by the tens of thousands*—it is not fitting to contend. This divination has yang above and old yin below, with upper and lower in their proper places. It bears the image of position and substance, wealth and nobility at their peak, with nothing left to add. Thus, one should follow the course of the times, know contentment, and avoid recklessness—then one may preserve one’s own success, and descendants will guard it without loss. Marriages are auspicious; seeking office, pursuing wealth, and awaiting matters have all reached fruition—one must not overreach. Those awaiting travelers should cease, for it is auspicious; in official matters, seek harmony—if pressed further, there will be regret. Illness will recover; in war, one should not act rashly—if an encounter occurs, halting is auspicious. Trust in others is lacking; when matters reach their extreme, they must reverse. What was auspicious may turn inauspicious, and what was inauspicious may turn auspicious. The Dao of joy and harmony leads to the *Surprise and Delight* Hexagram.\n\n---\n\n**Divination – *Surprise and Delight***\nHexagram 1-2-\n*Firm without, yielding within—harmony and unity are all-encompassing. Nurturing nature, preserving life, roaming with the spirits.*\n\nYan says: *What is sought is contrary; one should only preserve oneself. The ill have not recovered; it is fitting to make offerings and pray—there is no cause for worry. Official duties will not advance; matters will not succeed. Prisoners will have difficulty leaving.*\nHe also says: *Marriages are auspicious; pregnancies yield sons. The ill should seek the spirits; merchants profit; in war, great fortune.*\n\nHe says: *Yin occupies a yang position—hence \"firm without.\" One should not force advancement; nurturing nature and preserving life is the image of self-sufficiency.*\n\n**Explication:**\n*Firm without, yielding within*—it is fitting to be in accord with others. *Planning carefully, acting cautiously*—to preserve one’s whole person. *Roaming with the spirits*—this is not inauspicious. This divination has one yin line amid two yang lines, hence the image of firmness without and yielding within. Yin occupies a yang position—it is not fitting to act. Thus, one should harmonize, be circumspect, and preserve—then it is auspicious. In illness, there are malevolent spirits; sacrifices are auspicious. Litigation will not succeed; marriages and commerce are auspicious. In war, do not fight; prisoners will have difficulty leaving. Rumors are often false and deceitful—secret plans are fitting. The *Fright* Hexagram leads to *Minor Peril.*\n\n---\n\n**Divination – *Fright***\nHexagram 1-2-2\n*A rooster crows at noon, climbing the roof and stretching its neck. The hen is below the wall—startled by a fox. Cutting off its cry, it flees—its body is spared harm.*\n\nYan says: *In all matters, initial difficulty and distress will ultimately bring no other misfortune. In all undertakings, there is first ruin, then success. Travelers have not arrived; illness should be treated early.*\nHe also says: *The upper responds to the lower, but is blocked by the middle—unable to aid one another, hence the fright. Yet, dwelling in a high position, it ultimately controls and governs; cutting off its cry, it flees—disaster is averted.*\n\nThe male belongs to yang, the female to yin—the natural predator of chickens is none other than the fox. This hexagram portends that official matters will not succeed, and prisoners will only be released with powerful assistance.\n\nHe says: Travelers may encounter bandits; seeking office, marriage, or trade will all be unfavorable. Borrowing or seeking aid will be difficult, and desires will be thwarted. Fields and silkworms will yield no harvest. In all matters, there will first be worry, then good fortune.\n\nExplanation: One male and one female—there is secret contention. The firm and strong reside above, and the yielding cannot overpower them. Moving in accord with the proper response ensures no collapse. This divination shows a young yang occupying the honored position, while the two yin below both desire to act. The upper and lower correspond but are blocked by the middle, hence the image of the rooster crowing atop the roof while the hen below is startled by a fox. Yet, as yang holds the superior position and governs, and the middle yin is not yet dominant, they ultimately unite without harm or ruin. Divined affairs will require effort—first peril, then peace. Travelers will return but face obstacles midway. Military campaigns will bring fear; illness should be treated urgently. Seeking office or marriage will be obstructed by others. One must rely on the powerful—all will first be difficult, then obtained.\n\n**Abundance – *Year of Plenty***\nHexagram 1-2-3\n*First month, noon hour—year in Great Beam. The east wind thaws the ice; plowing and mulberry thrive. By year’s end, the harvest will be abundant, and joy will be boundless.*\n\nYan says: For all endeavors, the years, months, and days of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* will be auspicious, though results may come slowly. Without these years, months, or days, fields and silkworms will not prosper, yet no misfortune will arise.\nHe also says: This is the image of yin departing and yang arriving—the year resides in the *you* month, Great Beam.\nThe *Diagnosis* says: When the Great Year is in *you*, even begging for water yields wine—such is its abundance.\nThis hexagram governs fields and silkworms as auspicious. Officials will not yet attain their posts, but those in office will have no worries; the ill will suffer no harm.\n\nHe says: Travel by water or land, marriage, and harmony—all are greatly auspicious, the hexagram of talent.\nExplanation: Heaven and humanity are in harmony, yin following yang. The land is fertile and expansive—fitting for fields and mulberry. At the juncture of *wu* and *you*, fortune is unstoppable. This divination shows young yang above, with young yin in the middle following it—the positions of heaven and humanity are proper. Vigorous yang occupies the earthly position; above is harmony, below is abundance, hence fields and silkworms thrive. The \"first month\" refers to the initial line, and \"Great Beam\" is *you*. The lower three form *Li*, which is *wu*; the middle two form *Dui*, which is *you*. All divined affairs will proceed as desired, with results manifesting in the years, months, or days of *wu* and *you*, or in the *you* direction.\n\n**Minor Excess – *Minor Success***\nHexagram 1-2-4\n*Disaster arises from below—beware a single servant. Secret plots converge, hands and feet poised to act.*\n\nYan says: Though yang holds its position, it is plotted against by the many yin. Thus, a servant harbors secret schemes to cause harm. Be wary of those nearby. This hexagram portends worry in all matters, though no great misfortune will arise. Official affairs will nearly conclude, but prisoners will struggle to be freed—due to yang’s weakness.\n\nHe says: Travelers will encounter bandits; those at home will face troubles. Servants will cause harm; groups will stir gossip. Endeavors will not succeed; the ill will be cursed by subordinates.\nExplanation: A solitary yang above is weak in power. Yin thrives within the household—there is concern over servants. This divination shows one yang above, with strong yin below and young yin in the middle. The weak and yielding cannot control what lies beneath, hence the image of disaster arising from below—beware the servant. All divined affairs will be unfavorable. This and the sixth hexagram both feature one yang above, yet their divinations differ. In the latter, the lower position is young yin, which harbors the intent to follow above but is blocked by the middle. Here, however, the yin is mature, acting wantonly below, and the middle cannot restrain it. It is like a weak husband and young wife managing a household, where fierce servants and defiant maids refuse their master’s commands—its inauspiciousness is self-evident.\n\n**Attaining Aspirations – *Self-Sufficiency***\nHexagram 1-3-1\n*Ambitions clearly attained, in harmony with the times. Wealth and resources are abundant, with no lack of servants.*\n\nYan says: Aspirations are fulfilled, resources are sufficient, and servants are at hand.\nHe also says: Pure yang governs—this is the image of attaining aspirations. With utmost impartiality in heart, wealth and resources are fully provided.\nMaster Han says: When King Wen campaigned against Chong, he reached the ruins of Yellow Crane. His sandal strap broke, and as he turned to fix it, all around him were worthy men—none could be dispatched, so he tied it himself. This is the way of the noble person, holding to the Dao of utmost impartiality.\n\nHe says: Officials will enjoy abundant emoluments; distant travelers will arrive. The ill will recover; prisoners will be freed. Pregnant women will bear sons; trade will be profitable. This is the image of great success in all endeavors.\nExplanation: The dragon attains the proper center—greatly in accord with the times. Above and below harmonize and follow, sufficient for great deeds. This divination shows vigorous yang occupying its position, attaining aspirations and the times, with the young yang above and below united in purpose. What worry could there be over insufficient resources or lack of servants? For the diviner, nothing sought will not be obtained—this is the most auspicious of divinations.\n\n**Fulfillment – *Coming Prosperity***\nHexagram 1-3-2\n*Once desires were unmet—now they are fulfilled. All things attain their proper order; affairs proceed with clarity.*\n\nYan says: First, one attains aspirations, with loyalty and goodness as the foundation. Private matters are not fitting. Travelers will return; the ill will recover.\nHe also says: The positions of the Three Powers are correct; yin and yang are harmonious. This is the Dao of the noble person—here, it is prosperity. Promotion and longevity will increase; trade will be profitable. All affairs will be auspicious.\n\nHe says: Marriage and harmony will unite; undertakings will greatly succeed. Fields and silkworms will thrive; the distressed will attain their aspirations. Prisoners will be freed; endeavors will fulfill desires. Travelers will arrive soon. Affairs proceed with clarity—all things attain their proper order.\nExplanation: *Once desires were unmet*—the yielding was within.\n\nThe yang flourishes and acts externally—this is the time of opening and prosperity. Upright and selfless, its Dao thus becomes great. In this divination, the positions of the Three Powers are correct, yin and yang harmonize, and the noble person’s single Dao prospers. One should not engage in private or hidden matters but rather in upright and magnanimous affairs. The diviner who obtains this will find great fortune.\n\n**Talent Flourishes, Divination of Peace and Auspiciousness** *(1-3-3)*\nAbundant are the scholars, their virtuous power shining brightly.\nMeetings bring joy, lasting happiness without misfortune.\n\nYan says: One advances by talent and will receive aid from noble persons. By year’s end, success will come, and its strength will not be singular. The ill will recover, travelers return, and all affairs will be auspicious. If one seeks audience with kings or lords or pursues fame, it will be even better.\n\nHe says: Seeking office will fulfill aspirations; travelers will arrive. Trade, fields, and silkworms will be profitable; marriages will be auspicious. The ill will recover, legal matters will not succeed—this divination is highly favorable.\n\nExplanation: *Abundant are the scholars*—they follow those above. *Meetings bring joy*—the journey will be honored. In this divination, one yang occupies the upper position, while the middle and lower positions are all three yang. This resembles a ruler possessing firm and enlightened virtue, with many worthy followers. For commoners, it signifies the assistance of noble persons and good friends. Divining for office, meeting superiors, marriage, trade, or military affairs—all will be auspicious. In warfare, one will gain worthy allies; in endeavors, one will receive assistance—all is fortunate.\n\n**Leisure Divination, Divination of Joyful Travel** *(1-3-4)*\nRiding dragons and driving steeds, roaming the four directions.\nJoyful and content, boundless delight in travel.\n\nYan says: Follow your heart’s desires—east, west, south, or north—nearly all matters will succeed. Travelers have not yet returned; the ill will recover on their own. *The Book of Changes* says: *At the right time, ride the six dragons to govern the heavens.* It also says: *The mare belongs to the earthly kind, traveling the earth without bounds.*\n\nHe says: Lost thieves and stolen goods will be recovered; a male child will be born. Trade will be profitable; marriage will naturally align. Fields and silkworms will flourish; those in bonds will have no worries—all affairs will be resolved.\n\nExplanation: *Riding dragons and driving steeds*—the lower submits and supports. *Roaming the four directions*—none dare oppose me. In this divination, one yang resides above, while the middle and lower positions are balanced. The three yang are dragons, the four yin are steeds—each finds its proper place and serves me. Thus, one may roam the four directions, delighting without end. The diviner who obtains this should boldly advance. Only in inquiring about travelers will they not return, though they will fare well abroad.\n\n**Worry Divination, Divination of Isolation** *(1-4-1)*\nAbove alone, below solitary—schemed against by the treacherous.\nThe illness of the heart’s chamber cannot be swiftly cured.\nOnly when the season of yang spring arrives will one regain freedom.\n\nYan says: One will constantly harbor fear, dreading harm, but with the rescue of a noble person, all will ultimately be without fault. For the ill, recovery will come in the second or third month. It is also said: Two yang are separated by layers of yin, beyond aid. This resembles treacherous ministers usurping power, first harming petty men. It is an omen of worry and harm—few affairs will be auspicious, and travelers will encounter obstacles.\n\nHe says: Managing property will not be auspicious; one will be plotted against by thieves. The ill will recover slowly; prisoners will not be released—this divination is slightly inauspicious.\n\nExplanation: *Above alone, below solitary*—yin flourishes within. Petty men create barriers, and aspirations cannot be communicated. Upholding integrity and awaiting the right time will preserve the center. In this divination, the upper and lower positions are both one yang, while four yin reside in the middle, forming a clique of petty men. This is the omen of the true Dao being obstructed. All divined matters will face barriers and misfortune. One should uphold integrity to guard against disaster. This resembles the fifth divination, but here, the worry arises because the four yin form a clique, their power vast and difficult to remove. Thus, one must wait for the yang season, when the solitary yang’s assistance arrives, to resolve the crisis.\n\n**Vigilance Divination, Divination of Thieves** *(1-4-2)*\nHeaven and earth are vast and relaxed; petty men act freely.\nProhibitions are unenforced; thieves invade my home.\n\nYan says: One will lose property, and the head of the household will fall ill, recovering only by autumn. This divination greatly favors upholding integrity; it is not suitable for pursuing affairs. Travelers have no set return date; those chasing fugitives will not succeed.\n\nHe says: Medicine will not benefit the ill; legal matters will not be resolved lightly. Seeking wealth will yield little profit; one must guard against thieves at home—this divination is highly inauspicious.\n\nExplanation: *Heaven and earth are vast and relaxed*—laws and orders are implemented. *Thieves invade my home*—one cannot oversee them. The sigh of the noble person is the joy of the petty man. In this divination, a multitude of yin surrounds one yang. Yin flourishes in the middle position, and though the lower originally responds to the upper, it is blocked by the middle and instead allies with it. Thus, the noble person’s chamber is occupied by thieves. The diviner should guard against thieves. Matters of home, property, trade, office, warfare, or travel—all will be inauspicious. Only in fleeing or hiding will one find fortune.\n\n**Destroying Thieves, Divination of Enforcing Orders** *(1-4-3)*\nThe lord’s command oversees affairs, punishing and eliminating treachery and villainy.\nWielding spears and brandishing halberds, great undertakings will follow.\n\nYan says: One should be employed by others or employ others; acting independently will lead to failure. The ill are afflicted by spirits—exorcism is advisable. Travelers are safe; pursuing them will be auspicious. Divining for suppressing rebels or capturing fugitives will ensure victory. Treachery within, villainy without—this divination favors small victories over great ones. Trade will be profitable; seeking office will succeed. Fields, silkworms, and marriages will all be auspicious.\n\nHe says: The king’s punitive expeditions will prove effective. Legal matters will resolve themselves; no affairs will be inauspicious.\n\nExplanation: *Yin obstructs the middle*—seeking to rectify it. *The lord’s command punishes*—military strength is abundant. *Wielding spears and brandishing halberds*—to strike at illness. In this divination, yin obstructs the middle, but the lord’s command to punish it is backed by formidable force. Thus, one wields weapons to eliminate harm. The diviner who obtains this will find great success in advancing.\n\nIn this divination, a single yang occupies its proper position above, while three yang forces flourish below, with four yin forces residing in the middle. Though yin seeks to obstruct, the three yang powers unite in virtue. Thus, yin’s treachery is exposed, giving rise to the image of the lord’s command and officers mobilizing to eliminate villainy and calamity. For military campaigns or capturing fugitives, great victory is assured. The sick will recover upon treatment; in legal disputes, the righteous will prevail. Travelers will remain unharmed; obstacles will be overcome. All undertakings will be auspicious.\n\n**Defeated in Battle: The General’s Loss Hexagram**\n*One-Four-Four*\nJackals and tigers roar,\nEndless rains flood the land.\nBattles yield no victory,\nWeak troops and valiant warriors alike.\nOverwhelmed by raiders,\nMany perish or flee.\n\nYan says: To weaken one and strengthen another—both defy principle. All affairs grow difficult; travelers should return. Mid-journey, terror strikes; punitive expeditions are ill-advised.\n\nHe also says: Yin’s influence grows ever stronger, while the lord’s Way daily wanes. Jackals and tigers, external raiders, connect on all sides—enemies cannot be overcome.\n\nHe says: Regional lords guard the borders, yet officials fall prey to bandits. Even atop high ridges, they suffer deluges. The sick grow gravely ill; prisoners remain firmly bound; lawsuits stall. Cycles repeat endlessly. Trade, fields, silkworms, and seeking office—all prove unfavorable.\n\nExplanation: Jackals roar and waters overflow—yang’s path stands alone. Great villains conspire together, their peril beyond rescue. In this divination, a single yang perches atop accumulated yin, hence the images of roaring jackals and ceaseless rain. All affairs turn inauspicious; deploying troops is most ill-omened. Only in times of great drought will prayers for rain succeed.\n\n**Three Images, Upper Sixteen Hexagrams.**\n**Divine Aid: The Spirit’s Protection Hexagram**\n*Two-One-One*\n\nThe Great Unity deploys troops, the Jade Maiden stands beside. The shaman becomes an immortal master, dispelling misfortune.\n\nYan says: The household’s elder will fall ill, for a female ghost brings harm—best to perform exorcism. Most affairs remain obscure; even the traveler cannot return for this reason.\n\nIt is also said: The celestial deity, the Venerable Great Unity, has the Jade Maiden as his aide, while Wu Xian was a worthy minister of Yin. These are but auspicious titles. This hexagram brings fortune through prayers and exorcisms. If the sick are afflicted by spirits, hasten to dispel them. Seeking office, pursuing matters, trade, and marriage—all prove favorable.\n\nHe says: The traveler arrives soon; no harm comes from slander. Legal troubles end without worry, and one gains human aid. Best to seek blessings and avert calamity—what is undertaken will succeed.\n\nExplanation: The Great Unity deploys troops to dispel misfortune. Yang, though solitary amid yin, does not long abide with evil. Here, though yin resides above, two yang lines find fellowship, forming a united resolve to expel wickedness. The upper yin, in turn, serves our purpose—hence the omen of the Great Unity leading troops. The Jade Maiden at his side mirrors the radiant aid of Wu Xian. Though affairs may seem doubtful, one ultimately gains friends’ assistance to succeed. The sick recover through exorcism; the traveler returns; battles end in great victory.\n\n**Decaying Hexagram of the Seduced General**\n*Two-One-Two*\nTwo women, one man—above and below drive each other. Yin’s qi seizes yang, leading to depletion and emptiness.\n\nYan says: Man and woman clash; marriage begins but later dissolves. Though the traveler returns, bandits await on the road.\n\nIt is also said: The outer is no Jade Maiden, the inner betrays the Great Unity. One yang, subdued by two yin, forms a hexagram of depletion. The sick grow worse.\n\nHe says: What is sought brings no benefit; what is done fails to harmonize. The traveler does not arrive; silkworms and fields yield no hope. Legal troubles prove hard to resolve; the sick worsen. All affairs turn greatly inauspicious.\n\nExplanation: Two women, one man—yang is trapped by yin. It resists essence yet surrenders to seduction, leading to depletion and ruin. Here, one yang is ensnared between two yin. Both yin and yang are weak; the lesser seeks union, but yang cannot rise, overpowered by yin, hastening depletion. All matters divined under this sign prove ill-fated.\n\n**Rectifying Hexagram of Disciplined Order**\n*Two-Zero-Three*\nHeaven darkens, clouds ascend; yang stirs from below. The noble governs chaos; the petty fear punishment.\n\nYan says: Yin usurps yang’s place, rising like clouds. Mighty yang lies below, poised to ascend to the ninth five. It quells rebellion and restrains violence—all evil dissipates. Minor punishments serve as great warnings. This hexagram excels in governance; all affairs begin with worry but end in joy.\n\nHe says: What is sought is not obtained; what is done does not succeed. Upholding justice to quell chaos, the petty fear guilt. The sick do not recover; the traveler returns but gains no profit, only slander.\n\nExplanation: Heaven darkens, clouds ascend—like a dragon leaping from the abyss. Using rectitude to expel evil is like water flowing in order. Here, though yin and yang are misplaced, one yang stands at the center, three yang below, forming the image of the noble governing chaos and the firm overcoming the yielding. Divined for governance, civil rule, pursuing fugitives, or quelling rebellion—all prove auspicious. Lawsuits end in righteous victory; secrecy brings no good. For the noble, this is greatly fortunate; for the petty, the opposite holds.\n\n**Unreturned Hexagram of Exile**\n*Two-Zero-Four*\nFields lie barren, earth grows hollow; the people relocate. Awaiting a bountiful year, they return to their homes.\n\nYan says: This hexagram marks yin’s extreme rise, which yang cannot restrain. Fields lie waste, people scatter—only in a year of plenty do they return. The sick recover slowly; silkworms and fields prove unfavorable.\n\nHe says: Officials lose emoluments; travelers do not return. Silkworms and fields lose their capital. Though this hexagram is not auspicious, it cannot harm. Best to endure poverty and remain tranquil—seeking blessings brings good fortune.\n\nExplanation: Fields lie barren, earth grows hollow—nothing to rely upon. The petty harbor divergent desires, never uniting. Upholding rectitude and awaiting the moment, one surely attains their place. Here, yang is trapped by yin, while the lower position teems with yin—hence the image of barren fields, hollow earth, and fleeing people. Yet the lower yin, being mature, does not seek union. The petty, having their way, reach their limit and decline, while the lesser yin above instead aligns with us—thus, one ultimately returns to the old home. All affairs meet obstruction; remaining tranquil and awaiting the right time brings good fortune.\n\n**Cautionary Hexagram of Hoarded Wealth**\n*Two-Two-One*\nBurying gold and hiding jade, one boasts of supreme nobility. Ghostly debts remain unpaid; the spirits withhold blessings.\n\nYan says: Yang is deemed noble, hence \"gold and jade.\" Boasting of supreme nobility, the spirits do not protect. The sick are haunted by ghosts—best to hasten exorcism. Legal troubles require human aid to resolve.\n\nHe says: Hoarding wealth invites calamity. Though treasures exist, one must fear bandits. The sick do not recover; travelers do not return. Prisoners remain confined; silkworms and fields yield no harvest. Deploying troops brings no advantage—one is seized by ghosts. This is ill-fated.\n\nExplanation: Burying gold and hiding treasure—yang lies below. The ghostly path ascends; blessings cannot be borrowed. Here, a solitary yang is suppressed beneath two yang, unable to act. Two yin above, weak and yielding, take this as their treasure—thus, no blessings come, only worries. The diviner must expect ruin from greed.\n\n**Peaceful Hexagram of the Adorned Garden**\n*Two-Two-Two*\nThe year is abundant, the month prosperous; fields and lands expand. Steadfast as Mount Tai, no misfortune befalls in the end.\n\nYan says: Broadly open the fields, awaiting the year’s end. Divide heaven and earth—no calamity or fault arises. Unshaken, steadfast as Mount Tai. At home, all is auspicious; silkworms and fields yield great harvests. The sick suffer no pain; the traveler has not returned.\n\nHe says: Holding office, one enjoys emoluments; wealth and silk come of their own accord. Troops prevail in battle; the pregnant bear sons. Those with learning—this hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n**Explication:**\n\"Abundant year, prosperous month\"—all share the same aspiration. Gentle and yielding, favorable and upright, blessings know no end. \"Steadfast as Mount Tai\"—beginning and end are as one. This divination’s three positions are all yin, yet attain central correctness, bearing the image of dwelling in peace, abiding in compliance, and harboring no external desires. Thus, fortune prevails, misfortune vanishes. For inquiries into household affairs, fields and silkworms, official posts, or market trade—all are greatly auspicious. In campaigns, land is gained; the sick recover without treatment; lawsuits incur no blame; the traveler has not yet returned.\n\n**Heavenly Emolument Divination: Hexagram of Rising Fortune**\n*Two-Two-Three*\nReceiving Heaven’s emolument, ascending like the sun. From youth in office, rank and stipend flourish.\n\nYan says: Auspicious for seeking wealth at home; the traveler has not returned. The sick should perform exorcisms; offer sacrifices to seek blessings. It is also said: Heavy yin stirs into motion, ascending like the sun—this approaches pure auspiciousness. Not suitable for reclusion or rebellion. In market trade or hiring servants, desires are difficult to fulfill; the rest is auspicious.\n\nHe says: Endeavors are lofty and distant, all coming to fruition. The sick suffer no pain; military campaigns are fortunate. Favorable for praying to the stars; all plans succeed. No matter should be kept secret.\n\n**Explication:**\nYang flourishes below, strength following softness. Cultivating virtue and refining conduct, one receives Heaven’s favor. In this divination, two yin reside above while vigorous yang lies below, advancing upward—an image of the sun’s ascent. For seeking office or advancement, it is greatly auspicious. This divination is purely fortunate, except for reclusion, exile, market trade, or servants.\n\n**Abundant Wealth Divination: Hexagram of Unimpeded Prosperity**\n*Two-Two-Four*\nWealth like a wellspring, though used, never exhausted. All sought is attained; joy knows no end.\n\nYan says: All matters are auspicious; at home, there are celebrations. The traveler returns soon; wealth flows like a wellspring, inexhaustible in use. All desires are fulfilled, bringing unparalleled joy.\n\nHe says: Officials attain high promotion; livelihoods grow rich and ample. Fields and silkworms yield double harvests; good fortune and joy abound. The sick recover; prisoners are released—this hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n**Explication:**\n\"Wealth like a wellspring\"—one gains the advantage of the land. Softness and compliance move above and below; nothing sought goes unfulfilled. In this divination, the lower position is rich in yin, not clashing with the upper, thus forming the image of fertile land. The two yin, gentle and compliant above, do not act recklessly but enjoy peace—hence their prosperity is unceasing. All inquiries into matters are auspicious.\n\n**Later Fortune Divination: Hexagram of Sorrow and Joy**\n*Two-Three-One*\nThe heart bears sorrow, restless and sleepless. Fearing calamity, fortune arrives instead. Celebration and joy bring great benefit.\n\nYan says: Initially there is sorrow, but in the end, joy. It is also said: Yin occupies Heaven’s position, where it does not belong. Thus, though there is sorrow, the three yang unite to resist, unable to cause harm. This hexagram brings minor sorrow first, then great fortune—hence no blame.\n\nHe says: Gossip comes to nothing; the traveler is on the way. In marriage or trade, difficulty precedes ease. The sick first suffer, then recover; legal matters turn from ill to good; lost items are hard to retrieve.\n\n**Explication:**\nYin overpowers yang—its position is not esteemed. Anxiety subsides, and fortune is gained through firmness in the center. In this divination, yin occupies the upper position while yang resides below—an image of misplaced position. Yet one yang lies below, vigorous and centrally situated, while weak yin cannot restrain strength. Initially, there is doubt, but in the end, good fortune prevails. All matters begin with sorrow but conclude with joy—sorrow is empty, fortune is real.\n\n**Peaceful Divination: Hexagram of Latent Flow**\n*Two-Three-Two*\nAbove and below are at peace; the heart harbors no deceit. Upright and free from worry, do not heed rumors.\n\nYan says: A righteous heart brings good fortune; do not believe rumors. The traveler arrives; prisoners are released. Though this hexagram has yin above and below, three yang reside in the center. Initially, there is worry, but each abides in its place—no regrets remain. All matters proceed naturally; sorrow precedes joy. Serving rulers and forming alliances is especially good.\n\nHe says: Marrying brings a fine wife; the traveler is on the way. The pregnant bear sons; the sick encounter strange omens but suffer no harm. Legal matters dissipate; fields and silkworms prosper. In campaigns, trade, and all matters—greatly auspicious.\n\n**Explication:**\nAbove and below are both soft, relying on the central ruler. Upright and unyielding, they gain the people’s support. In this divination, three yang occupy the center while above and below are yin. Lesser yin is not yet dominant, avoiding conflict and fostering harmony. Yang’s vigor and yin’s abundance cannot prevail—thus the image of universal peace, with omens but no misfortune.\n\n**Averting Evil Divination: Hexagram of Flourishing Virtue**\n*Two-Three-Three*\nThe multitude loves me, warding off calamity. Fierce dogs do not bite; ten thousand things come to fruition.\n\nYan says: All matters are auspicious, gaining others’ assistance. The traveler returns; wealth is acquired; at home, all is fortunate. It is also said: Though yin resides above, it is not in its rightful place. Yet yang’s vigor prevails, able to dispel misfortune—all love it. In the three preceding hexagrams, yin usurps yang’s position, but virtue is not lacking. Cultivating it brings good fortune; sorrows cause no suffering.\n\nHe says: High ministers and regional lords gain worthy aides. Marrying secures a virtuous wife. The sick recover; prisoners are released; others lend assistance. In war, victory is won; the pregnant bear sons; trade is profitable.\n\n**Explication:**\nModesty and brilliance reside above—all find them lovable. Worthy aides assist in succession, ensuring no harm.\n\nHere the yin resides in the upper position yet does not wield its power. The host of yang below remains steadfast and upright, free from perversity. Though fierce dogs do not bite, they instead serve to ward off misfortune for me. In divination, one gains the support of many, ensuring success through their aid.\n\n**Hexagram of Great Capture, Governing Things** (2-3-4)\nThe Han Lu hound pursues the hare—its steps cannot stretch forth. The biting dog lies ahead; the pursuer follows behind. Layer upon layer, they press so closely that escape is impossible.\n\nYan says: At home, all is auspicious; the traveler returns, arriving both before and after. It is also said: The three yang reside in the center, able to restrain the multitude of lesser forces. The fierce dog’s pursuit of the hare leaves no room for flight—speaking of success in the turn of a heel. In all matters, what begins small will grow great. This hexagram favors the capture of fugitives, the pursuit of wealth (which will be abundant), and divination concerning property. For illness, it bodes ill.\n\nHe says: Officials and those in sericulture all find their pursuits favorable; travelers meet with good fortune. The sick grow distressed; prisoners remain confined; legal matters prove difficult to resolve; military campaigns return empty-handed. It is also said: Though this path is arduous, why sigh over toil and labor? Cast your line into the deep pool, and you shall surely land a great turtle.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe three yang occupy the center—vigorous Dao prevails. Though the petty man is yielding, he cannot contend. Even if he seeks to leap and surge, in the end, he submits to fate. In this divination, though the three yang are situated amid two yin, with lesser yin above and elder yin below, the desires of old and young differ. They are constrained by the firm and cannot act. Thus, it takes the form of the Han Lu hound pursuing the hare. For the diviner, it is highly auspicious for capturing fugitives, suppressing rebels, seeking wealth, pursuing profit, and marriage. Travel will meet with obstacles; prisoners will find it hard to escape; the sick will be in grave danger; at home, there is no misfortune. Most matters will come to fruition, but attempts at resolution will fail.\n\n**Hexagram of Decline and Revival** (2-4-1)\nThe sagely and the worthy succeed one another; the faint revives and flourishes anew. Like the melon vine stretching endlessly, it gradually ascends.\n\nYan says: Affairs that were askew now reunite; seekers obtain what is hidden; all things follow the heart’s desire. It is also said: Though yang is faint and weak, its aspiration lies in uprightness. Rising from below to above, it resembles the melon vine’s tendrils, extending ceaselessly upward. With a sincere heart in one’s endeavors, one revives what is fading and restores what is broken. This hexagram favors official promotion, the bestowal of grace and fortune, and the seeking of heirs.\n\nHe says: Studies come to fruition; the traveler arrives soon. Sericulture yields great harvests; trade is profitable; the wife one marries is virtuous and fair; officials ascend in rank; all desires are fulfilled. The sick grow distressed—praying to the spirits will bring good fortune. Lost items will not be recovered.\n\n**Explication:**\nYin flourishes in the center, but when it reaches its extreme, it must decline. Like the melon vine stretching endlessly, yang returns. Gradually ascending, the upright Dao is restored. In this divination, lesser yang resides beneath the host of yin, perilously isolated. Yet lesser yin lies above, with elder yin in the center—they lack the will to unite. The petty man, though at his peak, is doomed to discord, while lesser yang rises from below. As they wane, it advances, like the melon vine’s ceaseless ascent—a sign of revival after decline and the restoration of order. All matters bode well.\n\n**Hexagram of Avoiding Disaster** (2-4-2)\nSummer departs, autumn arrives; frost brings calamity. Birds and beasts grow thick fur; grasses and trees shed their leaves.\n\nYan says: In all matters, spring’s beginning follows the heart’s desire; at home, all is auspicious; the traveler has not yet returned. It is also said: Summer emerges, autumn retreats—yang scatters as yin reaches its peak. Thus, birds and beasts shed their fur, grasses and trees fade in color. The noble man, in a time of obscurity and stillness, cannot advance with the affairs of the age. This divination leans toward misfortune.\n\nHe says: Officials face unjust accusations; prisoners and rebels harm one another. The sick grow distressed; military campaigns meet with misfortune; legal matters are hard to resolve; travelers do not return; livelihoods are lost; there is gossip, theft, and banditry.\n\n**Explication:**\nSummer departs, autumn arrives—yin qi flourishes. Grasses and trees wither and yellow; stillness preserves uprightness. In this divination, the host of yin holds sway, with elder yin in the center—a time when the noble man’s Dao is obstructed. The diviner should withdraw, remain still, and guard their integrity; seeking advancement will not bring good fortune. All matters will fail to achieve their aims; the sick will face great distress.\n\n**Hexagram of Enlightening the Obscure** (2-4-3)\nYin at its extreme transforms into yang; hibernating creatures stir and emerge. The imperial pardon is proclaimed; the bells and drums resound grandly.\n\nYan says: Through yin, yang is aroused; reverently employing the multitude of creatures is like striking bells and drums to grant broad amnesty, opening the gates of the dark prison. This is the hexagram governed by the celestial immortals. It is highly auspicious for official advancement but ill-suited for marriage, for yin and yang injure one another and lack harmony.\n\nSunzi says: Do not intercept a formation with banners arrayed in perfect order; do not strike a battle line drawn up in full strength.\n\nHe says: Imperial grace descends; prisoners are released; officials attain high rank; livelihoods multiply tenfold.\n\n**Explication:**\nYin at its extreme transforms into yang—thunder arises from within the earth. The bells and drums resound grandly—the voice of virtue spreads far. In this divination, the three yang succeed the yin at its peak, like the thunderclap that awakens hibernating creatures—a time when the noble man’s Dao flourishes. All matters bode well; when deploying troops, it is fitting to display civil virtue.\n\n**Hexagram of Hidden Illness** (2-4-4)\nYin’s excess brings minor illness; one lies prostrate, filled with sorrow. Gazing upward at the heavens, then bowing low in submission.\n\nYan says: One’s desires are unfulfilled; the traveler faces misfortune. It is also said: Yin’s harm arises subtly, not yet reaching its extreme—hence, it is called minor illness. Yet lying prostrate and gazing at the heavens, one sees no savior; thus, one bows low in submission, consumed by worry. This hexagram bodes ill for all matters; only secrecy is advisable.\n\nHe says: The sick cannot be saved; prisoners’ sentences are sealed; reasoning proves difficult; travelers encounter misfortune—this hexagram is inauspicious.\n\n**Explication:**\nYin’s dominance spreads insidiously—distress and hardship follow. Bowing low and gazing at the heavens, sorrow reaches its extreme.\n\nHere, two yin lines are exhausted below, while one yin line perches above—this portends misfortune for the world. In divination: illness leads to death, prisoners remain confined, the besieged find no rescue, and all matters turn inauspicious.\n\n*The Classic of Spirit Chess, Upper Scroll of the Orthodox Canon* concludes here.\n\n**Hexagram of Ascending Prosperity (1111)**\n(Dunhuang version: \"Ascending\" with a \"work\" (工) glyph between the two characters.)\n\n\"Thus attaining wealth and prominence.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Attaining wealth and prominence.\")\n\n\"Not advantageous to conceal or withdraw.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Cannot conceal or flee.\")\n\nYan says: \"Aspiring from the small to the great brings wealth and nobility. If the great aspires to the small, danger and ruin follow.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Yan says: Aspiring from the small to others cannot bring wealth and nobility. If the exalted aspires to the lowly, there will be sorrow.\")\n\nIt is also said: \"Heaven and Earth have taken their positions.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"It is also said: Heaven and Earth are settled in their positions.\")\n\n\"To establish...\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"To announce...\")\n\n\"Is lofty.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Lofty.\")\n\n\"To achieve merit.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Merit.\")\n\n\"Not suitable for the elderly, the ill, or marriage, for pure yang is difficult to harmonize.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"In divination for marriage, pure yang is difficult to harmonize.\")\n\n\"Travelers have not returned; prisoners will be released; merchants profit.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Travelers have not arrived; the imprisoned will be freed; buying and selling bring profit.\")\n\nHe says: \"Official careers ascend; it is fitting to be prominent, not hidden.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"He says: Official careers ascend.\")\n\n\"The ill should not remain in dark places; it is auspicious to go outside and avoid them.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"The ill should not stay in dark places; it is auspicious to go out and avoid them.\")\n\n\"No harm.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"No suffering.\")\n\n\"In battle, the encircled side prevails.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"The encircled side prevails in battle.\")\n\n\"Farming, sericulture, fishing, and hunting yield great gains—auspicious.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Farming, sericulture, and hunting all yield great gains.\")\n\n**Hexagram of Gradual Peace (112)**\n(Dunhuang version: \"Gradual Peace\" with a \"work\" (工) glyph between the two characters.)\n\n\"Managing property...\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Pledging property...\")\n\n\"Not yet...\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Has not yet...\")\n\nYan says: \"Calm the heart and steady the will to await the proper time—then all will be auspicious in the coming year. If one seeks haste, it will not succeed. It is also said: Yin and yang have taken their rightful positions; the Dao of Heaven and Earth is thus attained by humanity. This is the image of affairs resting in their proper place.\"\n(Dunhuang version: \"Yan says: Calm the heart and steady the will to await the coming year—then all matters will be auspicious. If one seeks haste, it cannot be achieved. It is also said: The positions of yin and yang are settled; the Dao is thus attained in human affairs.\")\n\nThis hexagram originally followed the *Hexagram of Battle Defeat and Impending Loss (144)*; the sequence was disordered and has now been adjusted according to the original catalog.\n\n*The Classic of Spirit Chess, Lower Scroll of the Orthodox Canon*\nAnnotated by Yan Youming, Gentleman of the Carriage Bureau of the Jin Dynasty.\n\n**Supplementary Annotations by He Chengtian, Palace Attendant and Censor-in-Chief of the Song Dynasty**\n\n**Hexagram of Minor Advancement in the Yang Divination (311)**\n*Office and salary come in due season; emolument aligns with one’s years.*\nDiligently attend to affairs—take heed, lest you lose the moment.\n\nYan says: Official salary arrives in its time; in retreat or advancement, the cold season of one’s years brings both fortune and emolument. Be vigilant and cautious; do not grow lax or negligent.\nFor the sick, swift recovery. The traveler, though returned, gains something along the way.\n\nIt is also said: Dispelling accumulated yin, one governs the host of yang, doubling brightness and radiance.\nBeholding the beauty of the state, one speaks of position—all affairs are in great harmony.\nOther external matters may also be pursued in season: marriage and official pursuits are especially auspicious.\n\nHe says: For all one seeks, choose an auspicious time.\nFor the sick, offer prayers and supplications for blessings. The traveler will arrive at once.\nFor the imprisoned, seek those who enforce the law—they will surely secure pardon.\n\n*Explanation*: The brilliance of yang is upright and direct; the path of office is greatly flourishing.\nThe noble person’s time for service is to act in due season. In this divination, the three yang lines occupy their rightful positions, while the middle and lower lines are yang in ascent.\nThe Dao of yang is unimpeded; yin’s perversity is cast aside. For those in office or pursuing the Way, this is the moment to act.\nAll matters are highly auspicious—advance without missing the opportunity. Every affair is favorable, save those of secret yin.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Heaven’s Blessing: The Path (312)**\n*Ascend high and gaze afar—above, one sees the celestial thoroughfare.*\nThe Jade Maiden, most sagely, bestows upon me a divine talisman.\nEternal bestowal of agelessness, to preserve my body.\n\nYan says: This is the image of receiving things, matters arising from a woman.\nAt home, all is auspicious. The traveler has not yet returned but will surely obtain rare treasures. The sick will recover of themselves.\n\nIt is also said: Heaven and Earth’s positions are now correct; Heaven and humanity unite in virtue. It is like ascending high to observe the six directions, yet below, one responds to yin.\nWhen one finds their match, the divine talisman may be sought and seen.\nA century of venerable age may be attained in tranquility.\nThis hexagram is an omen for the noble: yin and yang are in their rightful places, without mutual harm. All affairs are auspicious.\n\nHe says: For those at home, fortune. Marriage brings beauty.\nThe traveler’s road is unimpeded; the sick will recover at once. In official matters, seeking high ministers brings good fortune.\nSilkworms and wheat flourish; the pregnant will bear sons. Merchants profit; the traveler returns. This hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n*Explanation*: Ascending high to gaze afar is to occupy the superior position.\nThe Jade Maiden bestows the talisman—yin’s mutual response.\nCentered and correct, one receives Heaven’s blessing.\nHere, a single yang resides in the middle, above supporting the firm and luminous ruler, below responding to the young yin’s match—its fortune is unparalleled.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Nobility: Encountering the Auspicious (313)**\n*Virtue shines brilliantly; ten thousand years without end.*\nThe Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper guard and defend me.\nAttaining promotion and emolument, generation after generation brings prosperity.\n\nYan says: Above and below are both yang; within and without, all is illuminated.\nThis is no hexagram for the common folk—it is the sign of the honored and wise.\nEven those who would meet the lord may draw a comparison.\n\nIt is also said: All one seeks will be obtained; the traveler returns.\n\nHe says: Officials will be promoted; scholarship will bear fruit. Leading troops, one gains advantage; the army suffers no harm.\nFor the sick, pray to the celestial spirits. Marriage is fitting; merchants profit. The traveler returns; silkworms and wheat thrive. Official matters disperse. This hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n*Explanation*: Virtue shines brilliantly—the Dao of yang is manifest.\nThe Northern Dipper guards and defends—yin’s treachery is dispelled.\nIn seeking office or planning affairs, one gains the power of the noble.\nFor grave sites or dwellings, this is an auspicious location.\nFor those at home, movement; for travelers, companionship. This is the divination of the noble.\nEven common folk who obtain it will know extraordinary joy. Prayers are fitting.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Prayer and Exorcism (314)**\n*Numerous strange anomalies appear—summon the shaman to perform the rites.*\nPray and supplicate for blessings; calamity vanishes, misfortune ceases.\nGreat and small find peace—by the power of the gods and spirits.\n\nYan says: The subject will encounter strange events. At first, matters do not proceed as desired, but later, all conforms to the heart.\nThe traveler will arrive; there will first be tidings. At home, all is auspicious.\n\nIt is also said: Through accumulated yin encroaching upon extreme yang, one remains still while witnessing anomalies.\nThe so-called shaman responds to the superior position—prayer is fitting.\nBy harmonizing and dispelling misfortune, is this not the protective power of the gods?\nAll affairs are slightly auspicious.\n\nHe says: Fear calamity and misfortune—perform good deeds to avert them.\nThere may be quarrels, disputes, lawsuits, or hardships; evil dreams or strange anomalies. Former misfortune, later fortune; beginning difficult, end easy. Fortune and misfortune are evenly matched—only vigilance and exorcism are fitting.\nFor the sick, sacrifices to the celestial spirits bring good fortune. Marriage will be promptly settled, for within and without, there is response.\n\n*Explanation*: Witnessing anomalies gives rise to doubt.\nThe household harbors an old ghost, whose power cannot be overcome.\nAppeal to the divine—security is preserved without loss.\nHere, accumulated yin resides within, while the superior position is replete with yang. Thus, the middle position speaks of the diviner obtaining it.\nThe household will encounter strange events—exorcism brings good fortune. For illness or lawsuits, prayer and exorcism are fitting. Seeking others, one gains their power. In all matters, initial worry yields to later fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Bestowing Goods: Initial Auspiciousness (321)**\n*A guest arrives from the south, leaving me fine wealth.*\nPrecious goods and rare treasures: a golden platter, a jade cup.\n\nYan says: Someone will send things; at home, all is auspicious. The traveler returns, obtaining treasures and wealth.\n\nIt is also said: Yin occupies the center, responding to external yang—friends arrive from afar, is this not fitting?\nThe south is the position of yang, hence \"from the south.\"\nPrecious goods and rare treasures are the resources of the noble; the golden platter and jade cup, the vessels of a fine feast.\n\nHe says: Marriage is auspicious; all one seeks will be obtained. The sick will recover; merchants profit. Official matters disperse; the traveler returns. This hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n*Explanation*: A guest arrives from the south—firm and yielding respond.\nThe golden bowl and jade cup express reverence.\n\nHere the divination shows Lesser Yin dwelling at the center, with one yang aligned below, while abundant yang holds its proper place above. Yin, through its yielding compliance, responds to external yang—thus obtaining precious goods. The \"south\" refers to the upper three lines forming *Li*, the southern direction. The \"golden bowl and jade cup\" arise from the lower single line as *Qian*, for *Qian* represents gold and jade, and the round vessel—hence the image of a golden bowl and jade cup. The first line corresponds to the upper and aligns with the center; the center is even, signifying a guest’s gift. For the querent, all matters are greatly auspicious, with seeking wealth and marriage most favorable.\n\n**Peaceful Land Hexagram** (3-2-2)\nThe land is at peace, without hardship or difficulty.\nSow and cultivate as you wish; journeys and returns are favorable.\n\nYan says: The lower position does not encroach upon the upper, hence \"the land is at peace.\" Planting is timely, trade is profitable, official ranks advance, illness poses no threat, travelers are safe and will soon arrive, marriages are harmonious, and dwellings are auspicious.\nHe says: Seekers attain their desires, the sick recover lightly, official matters bring no worry, and all affairs are tranquil—this is a hexagram of great fortune.\n\n*Explanation*: \"The land is at peace\" because the yielding dwells in lowliness. \"Without hardship or difficulty\" comes from an untroubled heart. With no deceit between above and below, what could go amiss? Here, firm yang resides above while the middle and lower positions harmonize in compliance—thus the land is at peace and free from difficulty, so movement and stillness, advance and retreat encounter no obstruction. All matters are auspicious.\n\n**Reverent Harmony Hexagram** (3-2-3)\nAbove, one stands upright; below, people fulfill their duties.\nHouseholds live in harmony, young and old unite in effort.\nWith unopposed resolve, all one seeks is obtained.\n\nYan says: Yin occupies the central position, embodying the Way of compliance—hence \"below, people fulfill their duties.\" This hexagram unites the strength of all below, so all requests are fulfilled.\nHe says: Marriages are auspicious, husbands and wives harmonious, dwellings secure, travelers return, business and sericulture prosper, sons are born, and all matters are greatly fortunate.\n\n*Explanation*: Yang’s firmness above is fitting and proper. With vigor and compliance mutually supporting, those below fulfill their duties. Households live in harmony, and nothing sought is denied. This hexagram brings good fortune in office, at home, on journeys, in work, marriage, and trade—nothing is not favorable, making it a greatly auspicious sign for all plans.\n\n**Defiance Hexagram** (3-2-4)\nBelow does not follow above; the center cannot restrain the outer.\nAbove and below clash in defiance, discipline and order collapse in ruin.\n\nYan says: The Yin path steadily grows, while yang cannot contain it—such discord leads to chaos, hence \"ruin.\" The sick grow worse, and medicine proves ineffective. Armies suffer defeat, and travelers do not return. This hexagram bodes ill for all matters.\nHe says: Nothing sought is obtained, nothing undertaken succeeds. One will see households scatter, property lost, armies defeated, distant journeys plagued by disaster, the sick distressed, official matters entangled, legal troubles unavoidable, and all exits leading to death’s gate—nothing is auspicious. Do not act or change course; only with the new year will fortune return. If obtained in the first month, it is inauspicious.\n\n*Explanation*: \"Below does not follow above\" because yin prevails. \"Above and below clash in defiance\" through mutual aggression. \"Discipline and order collapse in ruin\"—they cannot prevail in the end. Here, above and below clash while yielding yin occupies the center, unable to govern the petty yet also unable to rightly follow above—this inevitably leads to ruin. All matters are inauspicious for the querent.\n\n**Hidden Virtue Hexagram** (3-3-1)\nThe Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang,\nCultivating nature and walking the Dao.\nInhaling and exhaling primordial qi,\nOne may attain agelessness.\n\nYan says: Though this hexagram is pure yang, the lower position governs, approaching the image of a noble retreat—thus one may nurture its purity. All matters are secure and auspicious, except marriage, which is unfavorable due to its pure yang nature.\nHe says: Officials ascend to high rank, sericulture and farming should begin early, travelers return at once, official matters disperse immediately, the sick recover on their own, and trade, home life, and all affairs prosper—this is an omen of great fortune.\n\n*Explanation*: The Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang illuminate while dwelling in seclusion. Inhaling and exhaling primordial qi allows for leisurely ease. Here, double yang occupies the upper two positions, a time of brilliance under heaven. Yet with one yang below, only the Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang can match this. For the querent, it is fitting to dwell in peace and uphold integrity, enjoying the blessings of health and tranquility—do not seek advancement from others.\n\n**Growing Firmness Hexagram** (2-1-3)\nTwo people share one heart,\nBoth as inner and outer.\nDwelling together in one state,\nThey rely on each other like lips and teeth.\n\nYan says: Gain comes from others, loss from oneself. Also: Three yangs reside above yin—hence \"two people share one heart.\" Home life and all other matters are auspicious. Officials fare even better, marriages bear minor flaws, the sick recover slowly, and those seeking counsel find success. Travelers have not returned but will surely receive news.\nHe says: Rulers and ministers observe propriety, friends share one heart. Trade is profitable, sons are born, silkworms and wheat bring minor fortune. Official matters find aid, the sick suffer no harm, and medical treatment is advisable. This hexagram brings no calamity—greatly auspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Two people share one heart\" signifies doubled firmness. The yielding and compliant reside below, unharmed. Withdrawing to rely on each other like lips and teeth, they form a steadfast barrier. In this configuration, one yin dwells beneath doubled yang—yielding yet without conflict. Two yangs above act in unison, serving as inner and outer, embodying the image of dwelling together in one state. Like lips and teeth, they depend on each other and cannot be separated. For matters concerning rulers and ministers, brothers, husbands and wives, or friends, all are auspicious. One must not harbor groundless suspicions. In household affairs and commerce, great joy prevails. Do not heed slanderous words. Planting yields abundance, and silkworms and wheat bring harvest. Pregnant women will bear sons, official matters find resolution with aid, and the sick should seek medical treatment and perform blessings for protection. Marriages are harmonious, matching fine partners. For travelers, though they have not returned, news will surely arrive. This hexagram, when consulted for affairs, trade, or household matters, is an omen of great fortune. One version states: If one seeks elsewhere, it will not be favorable.\n\n**Hexagram of Strong and Prosperous Forces (3-3-3)**\nA multitude thrives and regains strength,\nAlready wealthy and flourishing.\nFavorable for establishing merit,\nNone can resist or oppose.\n\nYan says: In this hexagram, each of the three positions holds three yangs—truly at the height of prosperity. Thus, in establishing merit and undertaking affairs, none can obstruct. In all matters, one should follow the straight path without partiality, never straying into crookedness—only then will it be auspicious.\nHe says: This hexagram is in its prime. Pregnant women will bear sons, travelers will return at once, business ventures are profitable, fields and silkworms yield double, hunting and fishing bring gains, relocation is auspicious, those raising armies will triumph, and those guarding borders will find peace. Homes are fortunate, illnesses recover, official matters disperse, trade is profitable—this hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThree yangs share the same virtue, thriving and regaining strength. In establishing merit and undertaking affairs, they act with bold resolve. This configuration, with all three positions as yang, is firm, vigorous, and grand, reaching the height of wealth and prosperity. Thus, it is favorable for establishing merit and undertaking affairs. For those who obtain this hexagram, it is greatly auspicious to take action, especially in military matters. However, for illness, it is severe, and for marriage, it is unfavorable—due to its pure yang nature.\n\n**Hexagram of Noble Beauty (3-3-4)**\nGreen windows and purple chambers,\nWithin dwell ladies of grace.\nWith radiant countenances and fragrant hues,\nOrchids and irises bloom.\n\nYan says: The yin position flourishes, and matters arise from women. The sick recover on their own, and all sought-after goals are attained. Also: Pure yin resides below, corresponding above to heaven and humanity. Their essence and qi are fresh and fragrant, like orchids. Travelers return at once, marriages are most favorable, the sick find peace, and all affairs are auspicious.\nHe says: This is the hexagram of inner nobility. For marriage, the noble can be obtained, but the humble cannot. As a yin hexagram, it is unfavorable for yang matters. In planning, litigation, or encounters with influential figures, as well as with inner nobility, monks, nuns, or Daoists, it is auspicious. At home or abroad, financial gains and blessings abound, people admire you, and all matters are peaceful.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nDoubled firmness above shines with the Dao of yang. The multitude of yin below submits, resembling ladies of grace. Their descendants will surely flourish. In this configuration, though the multitude of yin is strong, it resides in the lower position, while the Dao of yang shines brightly above. The yielding dare not encroach, thus forming a proper correspondence. In all consulted matters, there is harmony. Travelers return at once, marriages are greatly auspicious, friendships deepen, and illnesses are not fatal.\n\n**Hexagram of Gaining Emolument and Rising Fortune (3-4-1)**\nRuler and minister exchange positions,\nJust as great fortune arises.\nMessengers and letters travel,\nPeople act with self-indulgence.\n\nYan says: Relocation is auspicious, and this direction brings profit. Pursuits will surely meet success. Travelers have not returned, but news arrives first. For the sick, their dwelling must be changed—moving away will avoid harm. Perhaps perform sacrifices, but do not partake; if one does, it will be auspicious. Also: One yang below, with a multitude of yin above—hence \"exchanging positions.\" As merit and enterprise rise, they rely on others to succeed—hence \"messengers and letters travel.\" In this hexagram, matters initially do not harmonize, but later bring great fortune—difficult at first, easy afterward.\nHe says: The lines of those in office undergo change, and affairs are auspicious. Travelers by water and land all return, livelihoods multiply tenfold, pregnant women bear sons, and marriages secure fine partners.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Ruler and minister exchange positions\" signifies yin submitting to yang. \"Messengers and letters travel with self-indulgence\" means losing their proper allegiance. In this configuration, three yangs reside above, while one yang is below—this is called \"ruler and minister exchanging positions.\" Moreover, four yins occupy the middle, overpowering it, while the three above, firm and strong, dwell externally and cannot attend to their ruler. Instead, they ally with the multitude of yin to pursue great fortune. Messengers and letters travel, acting with self-indulgence—this is extremely inauspicious. This hexagram is the exact opposite of the fifteenth hexagram in the \"Three Images, One Above\" section. Comparing and observing them reveals the author’s intent.\n\n**Hexagram of Doubt and Hesitation (3-4-2)**\nIntentions are glimpsed,\nYet fear they cannot be realized.\nAdvancing and retreating in hesitation,\nUncertain of what to do.\n\nYan says: In all matters, if one wavers in advancing or retreating, affairs will not be single-minded. Without single-mindedness, they cannot succeed. Also: Yin resides in the lower position, corresponding above to yang. Desiring action, the multitude of yin internally obstructs—hence the hesitation. Yet if one strives with determination, there will ultimately be gain. In this hexagram, all matters begin without success but end with it.\nHe says: What is sought is not obtained, what is undertaken does not succeed, livelihoods are unprofitable, officials retreat, travelers are confused, official matters are difficult to resolve, the sick face danger—this hexagram is an image of bewilderment.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Intentions are glimpsed\" because the response lies below. \"Fear they cannot be realized\" due to the obstruction of petty people. \"Advancing and retreating in hesitation\" means doubt prevents resolution. In this configuration, yin resides in the lower position, corresponding above to yang, but is separated by the four yins in the middle.\n\nThe upper yang seeks to respond to the lower, yet is constrained by yin—thus doubt arises and cannot be resolved, giving birth to worry and misfortune. Divination reveals confusion without success: the sick waver between improvement and decline, and all matters prove unfavorable.\n\n**Evil-Dispelling, Clarity-Shining Hexagram**  ☰☰☷\n*Three-Four-Three*\nThe sun rises in the eastern sky, blazing with radiant brilliance.\nThough malevolent qi lingers, it is scorched and consumed by the flames.\nThe multitude of worthy ones shatters the yin, and calamities dissolve.\n\nYan says: Amidst the prevailing yin, it is called \"malevolent qi.\" The surrounding yang, through its searing heat, purges it.\nAll matters begin in discord but end in fortune.\n\nHe says: Official matters fail, yet one receives assistance. Prisoners free themselves; the sick first suffer but later recover. Travelers return at once; trade and official pursuits, though initially thwarted, ultimately yield great fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Blazing with radiant brilliance\"—both above and below are luminous. When malevolence reaches its extreme, it declines and cannot persist. The multitude of yin is shattered and dispersed, and the human Dao prevails. In this hexagram, two firm yangs assail a dominant yin: though effort is required at first, success is ultimately assured. All divined matters are auspicious; though perilous, there is no blame. However, divining yin matters brings misfortune.\n\n**Upright Yang Hexagram**  ☰☰☷\n*Three-Four-Four*\nAbove stands a worthy ruler; below lurk slanderous ministers.\nSun and moon cast their light, yet dark dust remains unseen.\n\nYan says: The three yangs above form the image of a worthy ruler. Though sun and moon shine brightly, they do not illuminate the dark dust.\n\nFor those in high positions, fortune prevails; slander does not take root. Marriage brings a virtuous wife, and the sick suffer no distress.\n\nHe says: Though the yang above is luminous, the multitude of yin gazes upward in reflection. Though sun and moon shine, dark dust still arises. This hexagram portends frequent regrets. Seeking office is somewhat difficult, but divining marriage is auspicious, for yin and yang respond to each other. The sick waver between improvement and decline, recovering only at the onset of spring. All matters bring minor fortune, flourishing only when spring stirs.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe firm yang occupies its rightful position—above stands a worthy ruler. The accumulated yin below resembles dark dust. Obstruction lingers unresolved, and aspirations cannot be fulfilled. In this hexagram, the firm yang ascends to the celestial position, yet the middle and lower positions are filled with crooked yin, jointly causing obstruction. There is a ruler but no ministers, hence his will cannot be enacted. Divined matters often bring regret; only marriage, through mutual resonance, is auspicious. This hexagram holds equal measure of fortune and misfortune.\n\n**Orphaned-Poverty Hexagram: Encountering Difficulty**  ☷☰☰\n*Four-One-One*\nEmerging from warmth into cold, clad in thin garments.\nDeparting from my loving mother, I suffer this calamity and transgression.\n\nYan says: Two yangs lie below, obscured by the multitude of yin. It is as if one leaves what is beloved and encounters harsh pity.\nIn this hexagram, all matters are inauspicious. Travelers do not arrive; the sick worsen, bearing the image of separation. It is best to maintain the status quo. Obtaining this in the first or second month brings fortune; in other months, misfortune.\n\nHe says: Officials make no progress; livelihoods yield no profit. Dwelling in solitude and poverty, one endures hardship to the end. Prisoners struggle to be freed; the sick do not recover. Nothing aligns with one’s desires. Marriages lack constancy; all matters demand caution. Only with the arrival of the new year does vitality return.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Clad in thin garments\"—lowly and orphaned. The dominant yin above obscures all, leaving none to accompany him. In this hexagram, two yangs reside beneath the dominant yin yet receive no response, like an orphaned child. Moreover, the fourth line, with its crooked yin above, resembles a jealous wife regarding the orphan—his plight is extreme. Divining illness portends danger; travelers face prolonged hardship; officials encounter obstacles; livelihoods falter; military campaigns meet resistance. All matters are inauspicious.\n\n**Hidden Dragon Hexagram: Awaiting the Hour**  ☷☰☷\n*Four-One-Two*\nShun tilled the fields, reaching Mount Li.\nThe soil was fertile, the harvest abundant—ten thousand measures reaped in a year.\n\nYan says: All matters begin in the third or fourth month and conclude in the eighth or ninth month.\nAgain, it is said: The hidden dragon tills the fields, responding to the year’s abundance—who but Yu Shun could achieve this? This hexagram aligns with the first yang line of *Qian*, preserving one’s integrity in reclusion to cultivate the ruler’s virtue within. Whether matters are great or small, acting with benevolence is fitting; seeking through calculation is difficult. The sick will recover only by the end of autumn.\n\nHe says: Suitable for farming and sericulture; what is sought will be obtained. Trade brings profit; households prosper. Travelers return; pregnant women bear sons. Marriages harmonize. This hexagram brings great fortune in all matters.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe accumulated yin above is exhausted, leaving none to accompany him. His virtue flourishes and finds resonance below. When the time arrives, he rises—none can resist. Though this hexagram places a single yang amidst the multitude of yin, the upper yin, having reached its extreme, has exhausted its path. The lesser yin below aligns with me. Though the upper does not regard me, the lower responds—hence the image of Shun plowing Mount Li. Though not loved by his parents, his profound virtue ultimately ascends to renown.\n\n**Beneficial Friend Hexagram: Responsive Divination**  ☷☰☷\n*Four-One-Three*\nA noble scion arrives, knocking at my gate.\nHe speaks of fortune and blessing—going forth, I shall surely receive favor.\n\nYan says: One should go only when summoned. To be called and not go is inauspicious. The words advise going; if a traveler is abroad, calling him will bring his return.\nAgain, it is said: The inner responds to the outer, not remaining within—his aspiration lies in going, for the middle position aids him. When a guest knocks at the gate, who could be nobler than a scion? This hexagram is timely for marriage and all the more favorable for seeking. One version states: Seeking from others brings misfortune.\n\nHe says: Officials gain merit; farming and sericulture are auspicious. The sick recover; legal matters disperse. Travelers return; seekers attain their desires. All matters bring great fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"A noble scion knocks at the gate\"—the response lies without. \"Going forth, I shall surely receive favor\"—the journey brings assistance. In this hexagram, exhausted yin resides above, while flourishing yang lies below. Yin, having reached its extreme, seeks the yang—hence the image of knocking at my gate. The noble scion is a person of high standing. The middle position, a lesser yang, neither competes with me nor aids me, thus going forth brings blessing.\n\nDivination favors advancement, for one shall receive assistance from a noble person. The sick will encounter skilled physicians; in military affairs, allies will respond. All matters bring good fortune.\n\n**Long Treachery Hexagram (Many Difficulties)**\n*Four-One-Four*\nSeparated and distant, with repeated obstructions.\nAll undertakings prove unfavorable; nothing prospers.\n\nYan says: In all endeavors, the heart’s desires remain unfulfilled, and one encounters only alarm and dread, for a single yang cannot prevail alone. Though it occupies the central position, it suffers repeated harm. Retreating into concealment, survival itself becomes difficult. This hexagram is wholly inauspicious—one must maintain the status quo and avoid new ventures, for all new schemes bring misfortune.\n\nHe says: Travelers by land and water meet with repeated setbacks and ruin. The sick recover with difficulty; prisoners remain confined; merchants gain no profit. This hexagram is greatly inauspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nSeparated and distant, one is beset by isolation. Already solitary and weak, how can anything be accomplished? This hexagram shows a lone yang submerged within accumulated yin, unable to rise—thus nearly all matters bring misfortune.\n\n**Divine Assistance Hexagram (Utmost Adversity Reversed)**\n*Four-Two-One*\nFour ghosts and two shamans bow in supplication.\nHeavenly spirits descend to release the imprisoned.\nAfflictions vanish; blessings from Heaven are attained.\n\nYan says: All entanglements dissolve. Heavy yin prevails in the heavens, and ghostly qi transforms. A single yang stands alone—who but the heavenly spirits could respond thus? All matters begin inauspiciously but conclude favorably.\n\nHe says: Collaborating with others brings good fortune. Marriages harmonize; prisoners are freed; the sick recover; travelers return; pregnancies yield sons; silkworms and wheat yield modest harvests; enmities resolve themselves; seeking office or wealth first brings worry, then good fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFour ghosts and two shamans—yin flourishes and ascends. Heavenly spirits descend with blessings, for adversity has reached its extreme and now gives way to prosperity. In this hexagram, yin prevails, assuming the form of ghosts and spirits. A lesser yin occupies the central position, drawn to its own kind. Though the single yang is weak and cannot rise on its own, the young man and young woman will surely unite if they seek it. Thus, they can entreat the spirits above on my behalf, bringing down blessings and dispelling calamities. What was once a surging yin above is no longer a ghost but a heavenly spirit. This is the image of adversity reaching its limit and the Way of Peace returning. Divination indicates reliance on others will prove effective, with initial hardship followed by joy.\n\n**Expiatory Sacrifice Hexagram (Auspicious for Offerings)**\n*Four-Two-Two*\nTombs and high mounds—ghosts and spirits roam above.\nHasten to perform expiatory rites, and you may avoid misfortune.\n\nYan says: Accumulated yin with no yang forms towering, ghostly mounds—the image of tombs. Ghostly and spiritual forces flourish; only wholehearted sacrifice can avert misfortune.\n\nHe says: If one has vowed offerings to spirits but not fulfilled them, doing so now brings good fortune. Should strange omens appear, it is auspicious to sacrifice to the spirits of hills and mounds. This hexagram is middling—official advancement, seeking wealth, recovery from illness, and legal matters all begin with difficulty but conclude favorably. Travelers abroad face obstruction from a yin person but will return by summer; all else remains peaceful.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nTombs and high mounds—ghostly qi thrives. Perform expiatory rites swiftly to accept fate with reverence. In this hexagram, four yin lines occupy the upper position, while the middle and lower positions hold only lesser yin, with no yang—thus the image of tombs and high mounds. Only through reverence and compliance can one avoid disaster. The diviner should avoid contention; in all matters, adopting a gentle, upright, and honest approach brings good fortune.\n\n**Later Laughter Hexagram (Auspicious for Prayers of Blessing)**\n*Four-Two-Three*\nThe essence of metal stirs, but the primal scholar restrains it.\nPressing down with the left hand, one obtains favor and protection.\n\nYan says: Metal belongs to the west, the position of lesser yin, governing weapons and slaughter. The \"primal scholar\" is a great person. The left is yang, meaning that when yin qi stirs to bring harm, the great person assists. Pressing down with the left hand, the harm is dispelled—yang can restrain yin. In this hexagram, worries do not come to pass, and extreme disorder turns auspicious.\n\nHe says: This hexagram brings initial sorrow followed by joy. In all undertakings, one attains good fortune through the assistance of others. In ventures and aspirations, there is first sorrow, then joy. All matters ultimately gain the aid of a noble person, transforming misfortune into blessing. In affairs, good fortune prevails. Those with powerful officials may avoid calamity, but they must remain cautious and adhere to constancy in all things.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nLesser yin ascends, and the essence of metal stirs. The three yang lines restrain it, causing it to halt on its own. In this hexagram, exhausted yin occupies the upper position, while lesser yin resides in the middle—two forms the image of *dui*, hence the \"essence of metal.\" The three yang below correspond to the upper lines. Lesser yin cannot act, for the left is yang. In all matters, one gains assistance from others, first through caution, then through joy.\n\n**Initial Auspiciousness Hexagram (Auspicious for Prayers of Blessing)**\n*Four-Two-Four*\nIn ancestral temple rites, harm ceases and misfortune halts.\nBlessings fill the gate, while calamities flee ten thousand miles.\n\nYan says: The multitude of yin above forms the image of ancestral temples. Official matters disperse, the sick recover—it is fitting to seek blessings and offer sacrifices to the spirits. When encountering omens or in all matters, one should perform rites at the ancestral temple to attain good fortune.\n\nHe says: If a daughter is conceived, guard against great fire.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe ancestral temple rites are where the spirits reside. By reverently upholding them, blessings come without misfortune.\n\nHere is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis divination shows four yin both above and below: the upper as ancestral temples, the lower as burial mounds. The second, with its lesser yin, occupies the central position, like one who serves gods and ghosts. By reverently and obediently upholding the rites without fail, one receives blessings and avoids misfortune. The omens thus mirror this auspiciousness.\n\n**From the Heart Divination (Treading the Peaceful Hexagram)**\n*Four-Three-One*\nThe dark clouds gather above, while below no slanderers remain.\nAll matters flow smoothly, each returning to its true nature.\n\nYan says: In all matters, follow the heart, and others will assist. He also says: Yin occupies the upper position, revered by the multitude of yang. Misfortune departs, blessings arrive—all through ancestral rites. This hexagram favors grand sacrifices at the ancestral temple, ensuring household peace and ultimate safety from blame.\n\nHe says: A son will be conceived; the traveler returns at once; no bitter disputes arise. The sick should perform rites and seek blessings to recover. Fields and silkworms yield harvests—greatly auspicious. This hexagram is most effective in autumn.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe dark clouds above signify yin ascending. Below, no slanderers remain, for the yang path is unimpeded. This divination shows four yin above, while the two lower positions are yang, forming the image of dark clouds. The third, central, and first positions each occupy their rightful place. With yang unobstructed by yin, no slanderers remain—this is the image of all matters flowing smoothly. The omens for all affairs are auspicious; the traveler returns immediately.\n\n**Loss and Gain Divination (Overcoming Strength Hexagram)**\n*Four-Three-Two*\nMy treasured pearl is gone, now lost upon the heavenly thoroughfare.\nUnexpectedly, the thief lurks in hidden malice.\nYet the dark crow comes to my aid, driving the foe away.\nThe wind stills, the waves calm—I return to my home.\n\nYan says: In all matters, one is first restrained, then follows the heart. If objects are obtained through others, they will soon depart. First hardship, then success—such is the nature of most affairs. He also says: Four yin bandits violently steal my rare treasure. Yet yang remains, and in the end, treachery is cut down, like the dark crow pursuing evil birds. The storm subsides, and one may return to the old dwelling. This hexagram is first inauspicious, then auspicious.\n\nHe says: First restraint, then success—all matters follow this pattern. Fields and silkworms prosper; a son is conceived—this is a greatly auspicious hexagram.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"My treasured pearl is gone\" signifies yin’s exhaustion above. This divination shows four yin exhausted above, while two yin grow below, forming the image of my pearl stolen and the thief’s hidden lair. Yet three yang reside in the center, aligned with the upper position. The lesser yin is too weak to oppose them and thus cannot cause harm. The omens promise initial fortune followed by peace, with good fortune attained through others’ assistance.\n\n**Seeking Aid Divination (Receiving Assistance Hexagram)**\n*Four-Three-Three*\nThe Controller of Fate descends, inspecting the threads of destiny.\nThough life’s span is not yet exhausted, one suffers unjustly.\n\nImmediately summon Bian Que to open the jade flask.\nBestow a single pill of medicine, and life is restored.\nYan says: The sick should take nine doses of medicine; what they seek will be obtained, and the traveler will return.\nIt is also said: The Controller of Fate is the Celestial Physician.\nThough the host of yin resides above and the multitude of yang dwells in the center, though they occupy their proper positions, they become obstacles instead. If the innocent are drowned in unjust calamity, Heaven commands Bian Que to save them, and the disaster is dispelled.\nThis hexagram brings fortune through misfortune, life through illness.\nHe says: In official matters, there will be documents and confusion before resolution; it is also called \"rest and dispersal.\"\nIn all affairs of this hexagram, misfortune precedes good fortune; in official matters, one gains the power of a noble.\n**Explanation says:**\nYang is obscured by yin, yet no great guilt exists.\nThe doubled firmness ascends—it cannot ultimately be defiled.\nThis divination shows pure yang in the middle and lower positions, with four yin above, forming the image of the innocent being trapped. Yet yang is in its prime; though momentarily suppressed, it will not sink into ruin. Moreover, yin at its extreme must decline, while the Dao of yang is in full vigor, and one shall receive the aid of celestial spirits.\nThe omens promise initial hardship followed by prosperity, fortune through misfortune.\nThe sick will be weary but not die; in warfare, peril will yield victory; in all matters, initial sorrow will turn to good fortune.\n\n**Great Passage Divination (Unobstructed Hexagram)**\n*Four-Three-Four*\nThe celestial thoroughfare lies smooth and broad,\nFive paths open, six ways connect.\nI travel within it,\nRiding clouds, mounting dragons.\nYan says: The three yang occupy the center, their position noble and virtue abundant—I am yang. The celestial thoroughfare is unobstructed; riding clouds and mounting dragons, one commands the six directions. Like the Nine-Five of *Qian*, if the common people encounter it, they cannot bear it and will instead invite misfortune. Yet if one assists in governing a bright era, one may remain blameless. Whatever is sought will be obtained, following one’s will.\nIt is also said: The sun rises in the east,\nIlluminating my hundred paths.\nIts lingering light extends\nEven to the hidden valleys.\nOfficial matters will disperse; the sick will recover; the traveler will return; merchants will profit greatly; marriages will harmonize—this hexagram is a sign of great good fortune.\nHe says: When the Yellow Bell meets the *zi* hour, the yang qi flourishes.\nGradually, harmony and peace will come—no need for sighs.\nAll affairs follow the heart; all matters bring joy.\n**Explanation says:**\nThe celestial thoroughfare lies smooth and broad—\nthe soft cannot overcome the firm.\nRiding clouds, mounting dragons—\nthe position is central and upright.\nThis divination shows old yin above and below, incapable of action, while three yang reside in the center, firm, bright, and mighty, unstoppable in any direction. Thus it forms the image of the celestial thoroughfare smooth and broad, five paths opening, six ways connecting.\nFor the one who obtains this, it is fitting to govern the state, pacify the common people, eliminate the cruel, and expel the violent—nothing is impossible.\n\n**Obscured Survival Divination (Faint Survival Hexagram)**\n*Four-Four-One*\nBreath comes faintly, lingering,\nWithout strength.\nFace upturned, one calls to Heaven;\nHead bowed, one cowers low.\nSeeking brings no connection;\nSeeing brings no attainment.\nYan says: Only a single yang remains,\nSunken beneath the earth.\nBound by yin’s dark veils,\nHead bowed, cowering low.\nHow much life remains?\nThis hexagram is greatly inauspicious.\nThe sick will be gravely ill; fields and silkworms will yield no profit; on distant journeys, one will encounter bandits.\nHe says: In all matters, nothing is fitting—\nonly sighs remain.\nIn office or private life, one faces slander and disputes,\nDeep and hard to clear.\nGuard stillness and retreat.\nOr travel a thousand *li* to escape disaster.\nOfficial matters are hard to avoid; illness is hard to cure; merchants will lose capital; distant journeys will bring calamity.\nWhatever one plans will be unfavorable—\nit is fitting to cultivate blessings to avert misfortune.\n**Explanation says:**\nBreath comes faintly, lingering in servitude,\nHead bowed, cowering low—\nutter destitution, with none to appeal to.\nThis divination shows a single yang obscured beneath layers of yin, the image of extreme hardship.\nThe sick will surely die; battles will be lost; prisoners will not escape; litigants will not prevail—all matters are inauspicious.\n\n**Yin Growth Divination (Middle Suppression Hexagram)**\n*Four-Four-Two*\nLayers of yin reside above,\nGhostly qi drifts and wanders.\nWater pools in the central courtyard;\nBoats sail beneath the hall.\nYan says: A hexagram of pure yin,\nInner and outer do not respond.\nDisasters of official ghosts all belong to yin.\nIn all matters, this is an omen of misfortune and decline.\nThough inner and outer do not respond,\nIf official power aids it, it may instead turn auspicious.\nA daughter will be born.\nHe says: The traveler will encounter bandits; in all matters, nothing is favorable.\nYin schemes and slander—\none must be cautious.\nIt is also called the \"Enlightenment Hexagram\"—\nin small matters, slight good fortune.\n**Explanation says:**\nLayers of yin reside above—\nthe Dao of yang is blocked.\nWater runs deep in the central courtyard—\nfear of drowning.\nThis divination shows pure yin, the image of misfortune without response.\nFor the one who obtains this,\nYin people, bandits, and thieves will cause harm.\nThe sick face great misfortune.\nIt also portends yin schemes, curses, official ghosts, and slander—\nall matters are inauspicious,\nExcept for seeking rain.\n\n**Worldly Divination (Extreme Hardship Hexagram)**\n*Four-Four-Three*\nTrapped in misfortune,\nOne sits alone behind closed doors.\nFollowers scatter;\nThere is no way to obtain fire.\nYan says: The yang qi has lost its position,\nWith none to follow—\nThus it is called \"sitting alone.\"\nFire is yang, the resource of transformation.\nThe host of yin blocks it—\nthere is no way to obtain it.\nThe household faces ruin;\nIn all matters, nothing goes as desired;\nMarriages will have no descendants.\nThis hexagram is greatly inauspicious—\none must be especially cautious.\nThe sick will not recover; the traveler will not return.\nHe says: The sick have no qi; official matters are hard to resolve.\n**Explanation says:**\nTrapped in misfortune—\nyin rides over yang.\nNo way to obtain fire—\ndarkness and obscurity.\nThis divination shows yang losing its position and lacking support,\nWhile yin ascends and its faction flourishes.\nFor the one who obtains this,\nThere will be unprovoked disaster—\na greatly inauspicious divination.\n\n**Multitude of Misfortunes Divination (Utmost Peace Hexagram)**\n*Four-Four-Four*\nMisfortune strikes violently;\nIn all matters, nothing is favorable.\nIllness lingers endlessly;\nEvery movement brings stumbles.\nYan says: All three positions are yin—\nmisfortune arrives secretly.\nIn action or stillness, speech or silence,\nNothing is auspicious.\nHe says: This hexagram brings a multitude of disasters;\nThe sick face extreme peril.\n\nDesires unfulfilled, all matters unfavorable.\nProceed with caution—gradually, things will stabilize.\nFlowers bloom in frost-laden skies,\nA sight of blossoms fills the eye.\nThough one exhausts all human effort,\nHuman affairs remain fickle.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nUtmost yin with no yang—\nthe extreme of exhaustion.\nIn movement, one stumbles,\nNo strength can be applied.\nThis divination shows all three positions as exhausted yin,\nA multitude of misfortunes arise,\nAll endeavors meet obstruction,\nOne can only await ruin.\n\n**Bitter Endurance Divination (Heavenly Yang Hexagram)**\n*One-One-Zero*\nDwelling in poverty, enduring hardship,\nNo doors or household to call one’s own.\nTrapped within narrow paths,\nNo ground even to plant an awl.\n\nYan says: Standing apart from the crowd,\nOne dwells alone in the outer realm.\nNo inner resonance,\nNo place to settle.\nPoverty and hardship,\nOnly confinement remains.\nThis hexagram brings misfortune in all matters.\n\nHe says: The dwelling has nothing to rely upon,\nThus it is said: *no ground even to plant an awl.*\nThe sick face extreme distress,\nDesires go unfulfilled,\nOfficial matters are hard to resolve,\nLong journeys bring encounters with bandits—\nAll should cultivate blessings.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nDwelling in poverty, enduring hardship—\nNo means to establish a home.\nComing and going along narrow paths,\nOne can only sigh.\nThis divination shows the upper and middle positions isolated,\nWith no lower position,\nThus forming the image of destitution and homelessness—\nAll matters are inauspicious.\n\n**Joyous Harmony Divination (Matched Pair Hexagram)**\n*One-Two-Zero*\nHusband and wife draw close,\nNo others intrude.\nSitting knee to knee,\nOnly joy and contentment.\n\nYan says: Hard and soft in resonance,\nAn image of harmony.\nThis hexagram brings harmony in all matters,\nMarriage is most auspicious.\n\nHe says: The household is at peace,\nAll desires are fulfilled.\nEvery matter follows the heart,\nSilkworms and fields yield great harvest—\nAn omen of great fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHusband and wife draw close—\nA proper household.\nKnee to knee in joy,\nA moment of self-delight.\nThis divination, though lacking a lower position,\nHas yang above and yin in the middle,\nAchieving its pairing,\nWith no one to sow discord.\nThe household is auspicious,\nMarriage most auspicious.\nAll matters proceed smoothly,\nThough only in small affairs—\nGreat undertakings are not favored.\n\n**Fulfillment Divination (Completion Hexagram)**\n*One-Three-Zero*\nAbiding in one’s proper place,\nMatters align with one’s will.\nSet the mind at ease,\nFortune and prosperity arrive in due course.\nCelebration and joy abound,\nAll brings lasting benefit.\n\nYan says: Three yang in the middle,\nAchieving its proper order.\nThis hexagram brings good fortune in all matters,\nThe sick suffer no pain,\nThose seeking office find ever greater success.\n\nHe says: All matters follow the heart,\nMarriage is harmonious.\nOfficial matters resolve easily,\nThe household enjoys wealth and nobility,\nThose in office ascend to higher ranks—\nAll matters are greatly auspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe yang path flourishes,\nAbiding in its proper place.\nNo treachery above or below,\nPreserving fortune and benefit.\nThis divination shows yang in its rightful position—\nAll matters are auspicious.\n\n**Ghostly Omen Divination (Ghostly Relations Hexagram)**\n*One-Four-Zero*\nFood will not pass the lips,\nBreath will not enter the nose,\nThe heart and belly are knotted with vexation,\nSleep eludes the night.\n\nYan says: Soft yin resides within,\nNot in harmony with the initial yang,\nThus bringing harm.\n\nHe says: The sick face misfortune,\nPrisoners find no release.\nOne should reflect on oneself,\nNot blame others.\nOverland travel brings encounters with bandits,\nVoyages meet wind and fire—\nAll matters are inauspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nOne yang amidst four yin—\nThe will cannot flow.\nHeart and belly knotted with vexation—\nThe illness lies within.\nThis divination shows soft yin occupying the human position,\nWhile a solitary yang stands above,\nWith no companions,\nAbove and below out of harmony,\nQi and breath obstructed—\nAn image of worry and illness.\nAll matters are inauspicious.\nBeware of hidden yin threats,\nOn journeys, fear wind, water, and bandits.\n\n**Delayed Fortune Divination (Ultimate Benefit Hexagram)**\n*Two-One-Zero*\nEntrusting matters to others,\nDay by day, one awaits their intent.\n\nUp to the present, only now does one attain fine joy.\nThough matters linger long, in the end one fulfills their will.\n\n**Yan says:**\nAffairs must reverse and intertwine,\nOnly then will aid arrive.\nEntrusting matters to others,\nIn the end one obtains good fortune.\nYet one’s position is solitary and humble,\nUnable to advance on their own—\nThus delay brings goodness.\nThis hexagram responds slowly but auspiciously.\n\n**He says:**\nUsing affairs to entrust others,\nAll accord with the heart’s desire,\nOnly belatedly,\nWith external joy and celebration.\nThe sick suffer from heart and belly ailments, recovery is slow;\nTravelers wishing to return meet with obstruction.\nEvery matter proceeds slowly,\nYet attains its good fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nEntrusting matters to others,\nSeeking without immediate success.\nLingering long, one fulfills their will,\nIn the end there is attainment.\nIn this divination, yin and yang are paired,\nYet the middle and lower positions are intertwined and disordered.\nOne’s position is solitary and humble,\nUnable to advance swiftly—\nThus only after long duration does it come through.\nIn all matters, initial worry gives way to joy,\nUltimately fulfilling what is sought.\nOne should not act with haste.\n\n---\n\n**Anxiety and Separation Divination (Caution and Vigilance Hexagram)**\n*Two-Two-Zero*\nThough at peace, still perilous;\nThough joyful, still sorrowful.\nEver fearing separation,\nUnable to remain together.\n\n**Yan says:**\nTwo yin face each other in residence,\nWith no yang position at all.\nAs if good intentions do not pair,\nEver seeming as if parted.\nMarriage is difficult to unite,\nFor it is pure yin.\nIn all matters, there is no advantage—\nStrictly guard against reckless action.\n\n**He says:**\nDesiring separation,\nUncertain of good or ill.\nWhat is sought is hard to obtain;\nOne’s dwelling should be frugal.\nHousehold members may harbor schemes of hidden yin;\nLegal matters remain unresolved;\nThe sick have not recovered;\nTravelers have not returned;\nCommerce yields no profit;\nMilitary campaigns meet with no victory—\nThere is calamity, no joy.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThough at peace, still perilous—\nThe household is empty.\nEver fearing separation—\nIntentions do not align.\nThis hexagram has two yin residing externally,\nWith no household—\nThus one is at ease yet unaware of danger.\nMoreover, intentions do not pair,\nWith nothing to rely upon.\nThose who obtain this divination\nWill not fulfill their desires.\nThe family’s fortunes dwindle,\nEver burdened with worry that cannot be dispelled.\n\n---\n\n**Central Abundance Divination (Great Completion Hexagram)**\n*Two-Three-Zero*\nEncountering me at the crossroads,\nThe carriage rumbles along.\nWhat treasure is this?\nYellow gold and white silver.\nEver ensuring abundance,\nSeeking without fear of poverty.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThough yin resides above,\nYang dwells in the center.\nIntentions respond externally,\nSupreme prosperity and blessing.\nNo fear of poverty—\nThis hexagram is greatly auspicious.\nWhat is hoped for should be distant,\nThen there will be joy and celebration,\nGreat good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nEither through others’ arrival one obtains goods,\nOr by seeking others one gains wealth.\nLike the flourishing of the myriad things,\nOne reaps double abundance.\nSeeking office brings harmony;\nTravelers gain greatly and return at once.\nLegal matters disperse;\nThe sick recover;\nAll affairs are greatly auspicious—\nEspecially suitable for seeking wealth.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nEncountering me at the crossroads—\nThe firm and yielding respond.\nThe carriage rumbles along—\nThe position is central and correct.\nSeeking without fear of poverty—\nGreat celebration ensues.\nIn this divination, all affairs are auspicious.\nOnly with land and position,\nManaging property and establishing enterprises,\nIs it not advantageous in one’s hometown,\nBut advantageous abroad.\nIn all divinations lacking a lower position,\nThis is generally the case.\n\n---\n\n**Assisting Peril Divination (Upholding Integrity Hexagram)**\n*Two-Four-Zero*\nThe sagely person is refined,\nWhat form do they take?\nWorthy and good respond within,\nFirst weeping, then singing.\n\n**Yan says:**\nWhat sets the sagely person apart from others\nIs their cultivation of both refinement and substance—\nOnly then are they esteemed.\nThis hexagram brings initial sorrow, then joy.\nSeeking to meet the ruler for office and emolument,\nThere is no beginning, but there is an end.\nOne version says:\nYesterday, setting out on a journey,\nI encountered bandits and soldiers.\nA stray arrow struck me,\nBoth eyes now dim and blurred.\n\n**He says:**\nGoing out or staying in is inauspicious;\nOne may meet bandits and soldiers,\nStruck by a flying arrow in the eye.\nTravelers have not arrived;\nThe sick are gravely afflicted;\nPrisoners are difficult to release.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nGoing out and encountering misfortune—\nYin occupies the center.\nA stray arrow strikes the eye—\nThe upper position is exhausted.\nIn this divination, both the upper and middle positions are yin,\nWith no lower position,\nNor proper pairing—\nThey harm one another.\nThose who obtain this divination\nWill be oppressed and violated by petty yin forces.\nTravelers worry over bandits;\nLegal matters are hard to resolve;\nMilitary campaigns suffer defeat;\nMarriages are discordant—\nIn nearly all matters, there is fault.\n\n---\n\n**Flowing Fortune Divination (Attaining Heaven Hexagram)**\n*Three-One-Zero*\nContinuously meeting misfortune,\nNow one joins with good fortune.\nNot merely for a time,\nBlessing shall accumulate for generations.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThree yang above—\nNothing can invade.\nThis brings fortune and celebration.\nIn this hexagram, initially there may be worry,\nBut afterward, no suffering.\nManaging the household brings advantage.\nAnother version says:\nAffairs begin as one wishes,\nOffice and emolument are then obtained.\nTravelers return;\nThe sick recover;\nThe household is at peace—\nAll that is sought is greatly auspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nAffairs begin with worry,\nThen fortune arrives.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nContinuously meeting misfortune—\nFirst there is worry.\nNow one joins with good fortune—\nUltimately attaining what is sought.\nIn this hexagram, above and below are both yang,\nWith no obstruction.\nIntentions align, the Way converges—\nOne may bring about fortune and blessing,\nAn image of attaining Heaven.\nIn all matters, initial regret gives way to good fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Late Arrival Divination (Awaiting the Time Hexagram)**\n*Three-Two-Zero*\nShouldering the plow to till,\nIn the fourth month, one lifts their feet.\nDiligently hastening with the season,\nMillet and sorghum flourish.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYang occupies the upper ranks,\nYin is centered in the correct position—\nThis is the proper principle.\nPlanting with the season,\nThere is much advantage.\nIn the fourth month, the three yang—\nCrops and grains begin to thrive,\nFields and silkworms bring great good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nIn all matters, as one wishes,\nOnly slightly delayed.\nAfter long duration, it comes through.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nIn all matters, initial worry gives way to joy,\nUltimately fulfilling what is sought.\nOne should not act with haste.\n\n---\n\n**Anxiety and Separation Divination (Caution and Vigilance Hexagram)**\n*Two-Two-Zero*\nThough at peace, still perilous;\nThough joyful, still sorrowful.\nEver fearing separation,\nUnable to remain together.\n\n**Yan says:**\nTwo yin face each other in residence,\nWith no yang position at all.\nAs if good intentions do not pair,\nEver seeming as if parted.\nMarriage is difficult to unite,\nFor it is pure yin.\nIn all matters, there is no advantage—\nStrictly guard against reckless action.\n\n**Yan says:**\nDesiring separation, yet not discerning good from ill,\nWhat is sought proves difficult to obtain.\nDwelling places should be guarded against famine.\nWithin the household, there may be schemes of hidden malice.\nOfficial matters remain unresolved,\nThe sick have not recovered,\nTravelers have not returned,\nCommerce yields no profit,\nMilitary campaigns meet no victory—\nOnly misfortune, no joy.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThough at peace, still perilous—\nThe household is empty.\nEver fearing separation—\nIntentions do not align.\nIn this hexagram, two yin reside externally,\nWithout a household to call their own.\nThus, though at ease, one knows not the danger.\nMoreover, intentions fail to pair,\nWith nothing to rely upon.\nFor the one who draws this divination,\nDesires go unfulfilled,\nThe family’s fortunes dwindle,\nAnd constant worry cannot be dispelled.\n\n---\n\n**Abundance Hexagram (Great Success Divination)**\n*Two-Three-Zero*\nI meet my fields and paths,\nChariot wheels rumbling.\nWhat treasures do I hold?\nYellow gold and white silver.\nEver ensuring abundance,\nSeeking without fear of poverty.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThough yin resides above,\nYang dwells within.\nIntentions respond to the external—\nPrimal harmony brings fortune and blessing.\nNo need to fear poverty;\nThis hexagram is greatly auspicious.\nAspirations should be set far—\nThen joy and celebration will come.\nGreatly auspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nEither receiving goods from visitors,\nOr journeying to seek others and gaining wealth.\nLike the sprouting of all things,\nYielding double abundance.\nSeeking office brings harmony,\nTravelers return with great gains.\nLegal matters disperse,\nThe sick recover,\nAll affairs are greatly auspicious—\nEspecially fitting for seeking wealth.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nMeeting my fields and paths—\nHard and soft respond.\nChariot wheels rumbling—\nThe position is central and upright.\nSeeking without fear of poverty—\nGreat celebration ensues.\nThis divination bodes well for all matters.\nYet with earthly positions,\nManaging property or establishing enterprises\nBrings no advantage at home,\nBut profit lies abroad.\nFew are the divinations of lower rank—\nMost follow this pattern.\n\n---\n\n**Upholding Danger Hexagram (Guarding Integrity Divination)**\n*Two-Four-Zero*\nThe sage is refined,\nWhat form does he take?\nWorthy and good respond within,\nFirst weeping, then singing.\n\n**Yan says:**\nWhat sets the sage apart from others\nIs his balanced refinement of culture and substance—\nOnly then is he esteemed.\nThis hexagram brings initial sorrow, then joy.\nSeeking office from the ruler,\nIt begins poorly but ends well.\n*Another version states:*\nYesterday, while traveling,\nBandits and soldiers confronted me.\nA stray arrow struck my eye,\nLeaving both sightless and lost.\n\n**He says:**\nGoing out brings no fortune,\nOr encountering bandits,\nStruck in the eye by an arrow.\nTravelers have not arrived,\nThe sick are gravely afflicted,\nPrisoners remain unresolved.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nTraveling meets with misfortune—\nYin occupies the center.\nA stray arrow strikes the eye—\nThe upper position is exhausted.\nIn this divination, both upper and middle are yin,\nLacking a lower position,\nNor are they a fitting pair—\nThey harm one another.\nFor the one who draws this,\nThey will be oppressed by petty yin forces.\nTravelers fear thieves,\nLegal matters are hard to escape,\nMilitary campaigns end in defeat,\nMarriages fail to harmonize—\nNearly all affairs bring fault.\n\n---\n\n**Flowing Fortune Hexagram (Heaven’s Favor Divination)**\n*Three-One-Zero*\nMeeting misfortune again and again,\nNow it joins with good fortune.\nNot just for a time—\nBlessings shall span generations.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThree yang above—\nNothing can invade,\nThus bringing fortune and celebration.\nThis hexagram brings initial worry,\nBut later no suffering.\nFavorable for household affairs.\n*Another version states:*\nAffairs begin as the heart desires,\nThen office and rank are attained.\nTravelers return,\nThe sick recover,\nThe household is at peace—\nAll seeking is greatly auspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nAffairs begin with worry,\nThen fortune arrives.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nMeeting misfortune again and again—\nFirst there is worry.\nNow it joins with good fortune—\nUltimately obtaining what is sought.\nThis hexagram’s upper and lower are both yang,\nWithout obstruction.\nIntentions align with the Dao,\nBringing fortune and blessing—\nTaking the image of Heaven.\nAll matters bring initial regret, then good fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Timely Action Hexagram (Waiting for the Season Divination)**\n*Three-Two-Zero*\nShouldering the plow to till,\nIn the fourth month, lifting one’s feet.\nDiligently seizing the season,\nMillet and sorghum flourish.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYang occupies the upper ranks,\nYin holds the central position—\nThis is the proper principle.\nPlanting at the right time\nBrings great advantage.\nIn the fourth month, the three yang—\nCrops begin to thrive,\nFields and silkworms bring great good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nIn all matters, as one wishes,\nOnly slightly delayed.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nYin follows yang—\nThe upper position is constant.\nTilling at the proper time—\nFulfilling what is hoped for.\nThis divination’s three yang hold their positions,\nWhile yin follows—\nAn image of compliance without opposition.\nYet lacking earthly position,\nOne must labor diligently and act in season\nTo reap a harvest.\n\n---\n\n**Harmonizing Virtue Hexagram (Equal Power Divination)**\n*Three-Three-Zero*\nThe enlightened lord above,\nBelow, no treachery.\nCourt robes in solemn array,\nGreat brightness dispels darkness.\n\n**Yan says:**\nAbove, a wise ruler;\nBelow, worthy ministers—\nThus no treachery,\nAnd all is in orderly harmony.\nThis hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nInitial worry, then good fortune.\nApproaching office brings even greater benefit.\nPrisoners soon released,\nThis hexagram brings great fortune in all affairs.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe lord is enlightened, the ministers good—\nNo treachery.\nCourt robes in solemn array—\nNot fitting for frequent changes.\n\n**Hexagram of All Yang in Ruler-Minister Positions**\n*Three-Three-Zero*\nHere, all yang occupies the positions of ruler and ministers,\nWith no yin or petty men to intervene.\nThis attains the utmost goodness—\nAll affairs are auspicious.\nOne should uphold the old,\nNot seek change.\nOnly in divining marriage is it auspicious;\nFor two marshes, the outcome is unfavorable.\n\n**Hexagram of Certain Gain**\n*Three-Four-Zero*\nThe Han hound pursues the hare,\nThe flying hawk seizes the pheasant.\nNo venture fails to yield,\nAnd what is gained is fully reliable.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThree yang above,\nResonating within and without—\nA hexagram of orderly compliance.\nWith running hounds and flying hawks,\nNo pursuit fails to capture.\nThis hexagram is especially suited for the hunt.\n\n**He says:**\nAll affairs begin without end,\nLegal troubles disperse,\nSilkworms and fields yield great harvest.\nYet he adds:\nThough aspirations start grand,\nThey end with minor loss.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe Han hound pursues the hare—\nYang rides over yin.\nSuch is the capture,\nA great taking of game.\nThis divination is most favorable for\nPursuing fugitives, quelling rebels,\nManaging property, or seeking office.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Avenge Shame**\n*Four-One-Zero*\nA wife brings food to the fields,\nYet no plowing father appears.\nA thieving crow, shameless,\nPecks at my dried meat.\nI draw my bow and shoot,\nStriking its left wing.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYang’s position is solitary and weak,\nObscured by heavy yin—\nAffairs suffer harm,\nThus the crow steals the meat.\nYet yang’s nature,\nFrom weakness to strength,\nWill ultimately prevail,\nAvenge its shame.\n\n**He says:**\nThis stems from disputes with others,\nBreeding private grievances.\nThe hexagram portends worry:\nTravelers meet misfortune,\nSilkworms and fields yield little,\nAll pursuits prove unfavorable,\nMarriages fail,\nLegal matters remain unresolved.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nNo plowing father appears—\nVeiled by obscuring growth.\nSmall strength bears heavy burdens,\nInviting banditry and harm.\nShooting the wing,\nThough victory comes, it is punitive.\nHere, heavy yin rules above,\nA lone yang within—\nYet treachery and theft will ultimately be defeated.\nIn warfare, initial defeat yields later victory.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Inviting Bandits**\n*Four-Two-Zero*\nDrunken quarrels erupt,\nBlades and staves rise together.\nThe host, seized by terror,\nBinds himself to halt the chaos.\n\n**Yan says:**\nDwelling in a position without rank,\nBeneath a throng of yin—\nGuest and host breach propriety,\nDrunken rage sparks strife.\nOnly when the host humbles himself\nDoes the turmoil cease.\nThis hexagram bodes ill,\nGatherings with guests grow dire.\n\n**He says:**\nFirst, verbal strife,\nBut in the end, no worry.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nDrunken quarrels—\nThe peril of petty men.\nThe host binds himself,\nTo evade their edge.\nThis divination is unfit for action;\nSelf-preservation is best.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Knowing When to Stop**\n*Four-Three-Zero*\nAhead, bandits and thieves;\nBehind, travelers approach.\nWhether to advance or halt,\nOne may yet preserve oneself.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThree yang dwell together,\nYet hold no position below.\nA throng of yin above,\nLike bandits lying in wait.\nYet as the three yang begin to flourish,\nCalmly stepping forward,\nThey cannot be harmed.\nThough no great fortune comes,\nOne may yet preserve oneself.\nThis hexagram favors small journeys.\nHe adds:\nThis hexagram lacks a lower position,\nThus no travelers follow behind.\n\n**He says:**\nFirst, verbal strife,\nA desire to return home—\nOne should pause for now,\nTo avoid calamity.\nAll affairs bear minor fault;\nDo not proceed,\nBut defer to what comes later.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nA throng of yin above—\nBandits lie ahead.\nHaving an upper but no lower position—\nNo one follows behind.\nKnowing peril and halting,\nOne may avoid fault.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Urgent Entanglement**\n*Four-Four-Zero*\nSuspended in urgency like a noose,\nNo rescue arrives in time.\nEven the example of Gaozi of Lu\nCannot compare.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYang’s power and virtue both wane,\nA throng of yin grows ever stronger—\nAn omen of ruin and chaos.\nAs when Duke Min of Lu was slain,\nCheng Ji fled to Ju’s neighbor,\nAnd in that winter, Gaozi of Qi came to盟,\nPacifying Lu’s turmoil.\nThis hexagram foretells initial defeat,\nThen later fortune.\nHe adds:\nAll affairs demand haste;\nDelay brings discord.\n\n**He says:**\nAll matters require swift action,\nNot procrastination.\nAs when Duke Min of Lu was slain,\nAnd Duke Xi, son of Jizi, fled to Ju’s neighbor,\nThat winter Gaozi came to盟—\nThe *Zuo Zhuan* notes: \"Gaozi acted in concert,\"\nTo quell Lu’s chaos, hence his name was not recorded.\nAll affairs begin with defeat,\nThen end in fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nSuspended in urgency—\nLike reaching the utmost extremity.\nNo rescue arrives in time—\nCalamity presses close.\nThe absence of a lower position\nForms the image of high suspension.\nHere, a throng of yin ascends,\nInevitably inviting ruin.\nYet one hopes for rescue from others—\nA dire predicament.\nAll divined affairs bear ill omens.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Reverent Caution**\n*Zero-One-One*\nIlluminating virtue, blocking transgression,\nAffairs lie in following the moment’s flow.\nThe worthy are cautious at the outset,\nThe noble guard against the subtle.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThough the upper position is vacant,\nThe hexagram is wholly yang—\nSufficient to illuminate its great virtue,\nAnd block all wrongdoing.\nHe adds:\nAll affairs should move with the season,\nWhile guarding against the subtle.\n\n**He says:**\nAll affairs should follow the moment’s flow,\nThen one’s aspirations may be fulfilled.\nAs Zang Xi Bo said in the *Zuo Zhuan*:\n\"Illuminate virtue, block transgression,\nTo oversee the hundred officials.\"\nThis hexagram is greatly auspicious for approaching office.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nIlluminating virtue, blocking transgression—\nThis lies in following the season.\nCaution from beginning to end\nRequires guarding against the subtle.\nThis divination favors knowing the moment,\nAnd acting with uprightness.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of the Emperor’s Dao**\n*Zero-One-Two*\nHeaven and earth share their work,\nYin and yang commune.\nEndeavors vast and boundless,\nFrom west to east.\nComing and going, moving and dwelling—\nHard to trace their path.\n\n**Yan says:**\nHeaven and earth first commune,\nGrasses and trees just begin—\nNo tracks yet appear.\nRequests meet no response,\nTravelers have not returned.\n\n**He says:**\nAspirations grand yet hard to achieve,\nBeyond measure.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHeaven and earth share their work—\nYin and yang attain harmony.\nEndeavors vast and boundless—\nProgress knows no limit.\nHard to trace their path—\nBeyond reckoning.\nThis divination is greatly auspicious\nFor establishing merit and undertaking great deeds.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Indecision**\n*Zero-One-Three*\nLike a fox, hesitant and wavering,\nThe mind remains unsettled.\n\n**Hexagram of Hesitation**\n*Zero-One-Three*\nAdvance yields no hope;\nRetreat must follow right.\n**Yan says:**\nThough the superior position is vacant,\nThe host of yang strive in rivalry—\nAn image of indecision.\nInner and outer lack response,\nThus hesitation lingers.\nTo act against reason\nIs not as good as retreating to uphold right.\n\n**He says:**\nAdvance and retreat remain uncertain,\nHard to follow the heart.\nNearly all matters are thus.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHesitant as a fox,\nNo path to follow.\nAdvance yields no hope—\nThe heart wavers.\nRetreat must follow right—\nLest one fall into misfortune.\nThis hexagram depicts a time without a ruler’s position,\nWhile the host of yang lie below,\nWithout fixed direction—\nHence the fox’s hesitation.\nYang exists without yin,\nInner and outer lack response.\nThus advance yields no hope;\nBetter to retreat and follow right.\nIn divination, stillness brings good fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Treacherous Deceit**\n*Zero-One-Four*\nDefying Heaven, betraying the lord,\nDisordering human relations.\nIndulgent and treacherous,\nAll gnash their teeth in rage.\n\n**Yan says:**\nAbove, no heavenly position;\nWithin, solitary and weak.\nThe host of yin usurp command—\nThus arise those who defy and betray,\nTreacherous schemers who shun the upright,\nWhose words target the good.\nHolding office brings greater misfortune;\nLitigation lacks reason.\n\n**He says:**\nOthers blame them,\nFor their own wantonness—\nHence \"gnashing teeth,\"\nSpeaking of deep resentment.\nThis hexagram is greatly inauspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nA lone yang amid the host of yin—\nThe minister loses his place.\nPetty men run rampant,\nNone can restrain them.\nThis divination shows no heavenly position above,\nA weak and solitary center below,\nWhile the host of yin ally below,\nActing wantonly—\nAn image of defying Heaven and betraying the lord.\nIn divination, nothing is not inauspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Reversal**\n*Zero-Two-One*\nAbove and below inverted,\nAll affairs lose propriety.\nEast and west diverge,\nNo longer following one another.\n\n**Yan says:**\nMatters proceed,\nYet none align with the heart—\nFor yin and yang are misplaced.\n\nWhat is done brings no benefit;\nWhat is sought finds no harmony.\n\n**He says:**\nTo advance or act in seeking matters,\nRelying on others, all may succeed—\nBut delay brings fortune.\nThe sick suffer in the heart and belly,\nRecovery will be slow.\nTravelers wish to return;\nIn all things, delay brings good fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nAbove and below are overturned—\nThe soft overcomes the hard.\nEast and west diverge—\nHopes are dashed.\nThis hexagram shows no heavenly position above,\nWhile yin and yang are inverted below.\nAll affairs are perverse and inauspicious.\nThe diviner must act with caution.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Primal Virtue**\n*Zero-Two-Two*\nDeep thought and far-reaching reflection,\nDwelling in peace yet wary of danger.\nThough no harm exists now,\nUltimately, collapse and loss will come.\nAlways follow the right Way;\nBeware of deceit and fraud.\n\n**Yan says:**\nPure yin without yang\nCannot ensure lasting good fortune—\nThus danger and defeat appear.\nThis hexagram brings temporary ease,\nBut later, blame will come.\n\n**He says:**\nIn all matters, deep thought and far-reaching reflection are fitting.\nThough all is peaceful now,\nUltimately, it will not be favorable.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nSoft and weak, resting in ease—\nYet in the end, collapse and loss come,\nFor there is no master.\nAlways follow the right Way,\nThen one does not lose their place.\nThis divination shows two yin in alignment below,\nWith no master above—\nA fleeting peace,\nYet ultimately unable to stand firm.\nThe diviner must uphold rightness\nTo preserve themselves.\nIf they act recklessly,\nDanger and defeat will surely come.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Vigilance**\n*Zero-Two-Three*\nVirtue dispels misfortune;\nReverence and caution are fitting.\nThough now constrained,\nFortune and emolument will come of themselves.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThis hexagram transforms its lower yin into yang—\nVirtue suffices to dispel misfortune,\nUltimately bringing blessed prosperity.\nIn all matters, initial small worries\nWill later yield great good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nFortune and emolument will surely come,\nThough slightly delayed.\nMatters will follow one’s will.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nVirtue dispels misfortune—\nYang rises below yin.\nFortune and emolument come of themselves—\nUltimately, the heart’s desire is attained.\nThis hexagram shows yin and yang misaligned,\nYet the three yang are strong and vigorous,\nYin cannot overcome them—\nThus the image of virtue dispelling misfortune.\nThough misfortune may arise at first,\nUltimately, great good fortune comes.\nIts power is natural,\nNot requiring pursuit.\nIn divination, all matters are auspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Yin Treachery**\n*Zero-Two-Four*\nYin treachery plots rebellion,\nUnfavorable for descendants.\nThough momentarily content,\nLater, no peace will come.\n\n**Yan says:**\nTransforming yang into yin—\nThis is the image of treachery.\nYin treachery schemes harm,\nDescendants will dwindle—\nThus \"unfavorable for descendants.\"\nIn this hexagram, all matters and undertakings\nInitially bring good fortune,\nBut later, harm.\n\n**He says:**\nThough matters may now align with one’s wishes,\nLater, they will not be auspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nYin treachery plots destruction—\nPetty men seize their moment.\nYet in the end, no peace comes—\nUltimately, no refuge remains.\nThis divination brings initial good fortune,\nBut later misfortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Auspicious Encounter**\n*Zero-Three-One*\nStepping out, one meets good fortune,\nAligning with the good.\nA bright pearl shines at night,\nSo I am not led astray.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThis hexagram brings good fortune in all things—\nTravelers, merchants, farming, and sericulture\nAll gain good fortune.\nFor officials, it brings honor and prominence—\nA greatly auspicious hexagram.\n\n**He says:**\nHaving met good fortune,\nAnd illuminated by a bright pearl,\nAll matters are without misfortune;\nAll undertakings succeed.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nStepping out, one meets good fortune—\nFinding one’s kind.\nA bright pearl shines at night—\nThough dark, it is not blind.\nThis divination shows yang finding its kind,\nWithout losing order.\nThe three’s firm brightness\nSuffices to illuminate the dark—\nTruly aligning with the good.\nIn all matters, good fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Peace and Prosperity**\n*Zero-Three-Two*\nHeaven wanes, earth rests;\nThe worthy hold their posts.\nJourneys return, illness fades—\nBoundless benefit, no limit.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin and yang each hold their place;\nThe noble remain still and guard themselves.\nIn all matters, returning to the root brings great good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nWhat is sought cannot be rushed;\nAll matters follow the heart—\nA greatly auspicious hexagram.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe worthy hold their posts—\nPositions are proper and constant.\nJourneys return, illness fades—\nGains without loss.\nIn this divination, what is sought\nCannot be rushed—\nThen all matters follow the heart,\nBringing good fortune.\n\n**Hexagram of Preserving Life**\n*Zero-Three-Three*\nThe phoenix holds a pearl in its beak,\nAlighting in the corner of my courtyard.\nFortune comes to me,\nMisfortune is driven away.\n\n**Yan says:**\nIn an age where the high hold no position,\nOnly one who governs with pure firmness\nSees the omen of good fortune.\nMisfortune dissolves, fortune arrives—\nThe phoenix, most sacred of omens.\nThe pearl, a treasure of delight:\nAll that is sought shall be attained.\n\n**He says:**\nFortune and emolument draw near—\nA greatly auspicious and beneficial hexagram.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe phoenix alights in the courtyard—\nThe radiance of worthy virtue.\nFortune arrives, misfortune departs—\nAll good converges.\nIn this divination, nothing is inauspicious,\nSave for seeking rain, which thwarts desire.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Upholding Worthiness in Decline**\n*Zero-Three-Four*\nThe noble stand firm,\nThe petty bow low.\nA luminous lord governs the age,\nDistinguishing purple from crimson.\n\n**Yan says:**\nAbiding in the stability of a weighty position,\nThey emit the illumination of three yang.\nAs the *Book of Changes* says:\n“This is the time when the petty must not be employed.”\nSeeking office brings great fortune;\nAll other matters attain their proper principle.\n\n**He says:**\nA wise ruler presides above,\nThe noble are employed—\nAll wishes follow the heart.\nThe petty submit in lowliness,\nAs reason dictates.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe noble attain their positions—\nThe petty submit.\nDistinguishing crimson from purple,\nEach holds their proper post.\nIn this hexagram, yin and yang each occupy their rightful place:\nFirm brightness shines from above,\nWhile yielding yin follows below.\nIn divination, matters attain their principle;\nBoth noble and petty know good fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of the Ascending Dragon**\n*Zero-Four-One*\nThe hidden dragon prepares to rise,\nDark clouds gather above.\nThe world receives blessings—\nFirst adversity, then joy.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThough the beginning is inauspicious,\nThe end brings great fortune.\nOne yang lies below—\nAs in the *Book of Changes*, the “hidden dragon” of the first nine,\nPoised to ascend as clouds arise.\nWelcoming it, they soar together,\nRiding the empty sky—\nAn omen of harmony between lord and minister across the land.\n\n**He says:**\nThis hexagram begins in adversity but ends in prosperity;\nAll matters bring good fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe hidden dragon meets the clouds—\nAscending to heaven.\nFirst adversity, then joy—\nAdvance without hindrance.\nThis hexagram has no heaven above,\nOnly one yang beneath four yin—\nThus the image of the hidden dragon meeting clouds.\nThough the beginning is fraught with difficulty,\nThe end brings success—\nA greatly auspicious hexagram.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Overturning and Prosperity**\n*Zero-Four-Two*\nThe celestial dragon rages,\nThe thunder lord beats his drum.\nClouds gather, rain descends,\nFloodwaters surge across the earth.\n\n**Yan says:**\nPure yin occupies a time without response,\nUnable to dispel calamity or avert disaster—\nThus the day when thunder and lightning clash,\nAnd floodwaters bring ruin.\nThis hexagram brings regret in all matters:\nTravelers, marriages, and commerce all meet misfortune.\n\n**He says:**\nRain flows, sweeping all clean—\nA hexagram of instability in all matters.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe celestial dragon rages—\nYin rises above.\nFloodwaters surge across the earth—\nNothing can withstand them.\nIn this divination, all undertakings are inauspicious,\nSave for seeking rain.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Withdrawing from the World**\n*Zero-Four-Three*\nThe petty gain power,\nThe noble lose the Way.\nAbandoning my halls and home,\nI enter the deep grasses.\n\n**Yan says:**\nBright yang virtue retreats to a lowly place,\nWhile dark yin usurps the central position—\nAn image of worthy men suppressed and stagnant.\nThus they forsake their halls,\nDwelling far away in the marshes and grasses,\nCultivating their resolve in seclusion,\nAwaiting their time.\nThis hexagram favors retreat, not advance.\n\n**He says:**\nOverpowered by yin,\nThey lose their rightful place.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe petty gain power—\nYin overcomes yang.\nEntering the deep grasses—\nTheir position is improper.\nIn this hexagram, yin and yang are misaligned;\nAll matters favor retreat and shun advance.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Ghostly Activity**\n*Zero-Four-Four*\nTwo ghosts dwell together,\nEver hungry, ever hollow.\nThey wish to enter the gate,\nBut fear this talisman.\n\n**Yan says:**\nAn image of accumulated yin—\nGhosts are about to bring harm.\nWith no master for sacrifices,\nThey are said to be hungry and hollow.\nThe ghosts dare not approach,\nFearing the talisman.\nThis hexagram favors reciting scriptures and mantras\nTo expel malevolent spirits;\nSacrifices bring good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nFortune departs, misfortune arrives—\nOne should cultivate merit and virtue,\nPerform good deeds to dispel evil.\nThe sick should inscribe talismans\nAnd recite the *Ruan* incantation to recover.\nFields and silkworms yield meager harvests—\nA hexagram of constant hardship.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nTwo ghosts dwell together—\nYin’s malevolence accumulates.\nFearing this sacred talisman,\nThey are left with nowhere to go.\nIn this hexagram, two yin lie below,\nWith no position above—\nNo ancestral temple or master for sacrifices,\nThus they are homeless ghosts.\nThough the celestial position is empty,\nLuminous brightness presides above,\nPreventing the ghosts from approaching,\nAs if a talisman barred their entry.\nIn divination, all matters meet great hardship;\nThe sick should be treated with talismans and incantations.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Slight Loss**\n*One-Zero-One*\nClimbing a tree to pluck mulberry leaves,\nI fall to the ground, sprawled and prone.\nThe eastern neighbor has medicine—\nI rush to ask for the prescription.\nThere I meet a skilled physician,\nAnd escape unbroken, unharmed.\n\n**Yan says:**\nSeeking something, one incurs this affliction;\nProceeding further to make amends brings good fortune.\nAlso:\nYin loses its yin position,\nThe yang line has no response.\nLike ascending high only to fall,\nYet with yang present in the center,\nNo yin disaster befalls.\nSeeking a prescription from the eastern neighbor\nAverts injury—\nFor the east is the beginning of yang,\nAnd supplication brings good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nThe sick should return to where the illness began\nAnd make amends—this brings good fortune.\nTravelers have not returned;\nLegal matters are difficult to resolve.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nClimbing a tree, falling to the ground—\nAscending high brings peril.\nAsking for the prescription, obtaining medicine—\nIn the end, no loss is suffered.\nIn this hexagram, above and below are both yang,\nWith no yin—\nThough disaster strikes, it is not severe.\nThe east is the beginning of yang,\nThus one seeks the prescription from the eastern neighbor\nAnd finds a physician.\nThe sick are in distress—\nThey should return to where they incurred the affliction\nAnd make amends; this brings good fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Initial Harmony**\n*One-Zero-Two*\nLike a newlywed bride,\nUnaccustomed to her home.\nWith diligent effort and self-reliance,\nShe will bear children in time.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThough lacking a central position,\nYin and yang are in harmony,\nInner and outer in accord.\n\n**Like Newlyweds, Harmony Comes Later**\nFirst harmony comes after marriage.\nIn all matters, when responses align,\nOne may rely on oneself.\nBe vigilant day and night, as if facing peril—\nOnly then will fortune come.\nIllness and official matters bring no suffering;\nAll affairs turn auspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nMarriage begins without harmony but ends in accord.\nTrade, business, and all undertakings prosper.\nOfficial matters remain difficult to resolve.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe bride is newly wed, unaccustomed to her home—\nTheir bond is not yet deep.\nWith diligent effort and self-reliance,\nThey build their household.\nIn this hexagram, yang is above and yin below,\nEach in its proper place, yet not yet intimate.\nLike a new bride, their connection exists but is not yet profound.\nYet the central position is unobstructed;\nThough distant at first, they grow close in time.\nThus, with perseverance and effort, harmony is ultimately achieved.\nFor matters facing obstacles, one must apply force—\nEven in military campaigns, resolution comes in the end.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Barren Soil**\n*One-Zero-Three*\nThe earth is high, the stone unyielding;\nOne looks up and pleads to heaven.\nThe plow lies idle, the hoe unused—\nThe fields stand barren, the crops sparse.\n\n**Yan says:**\nWithin and without, all is yang,\nWith no yin qi.\nMoisture cannot penetrate;\nPlowing and sowing are in vain.\n\n**He says:**\nAll matters require action—\nSeek, and you shall attain.\nWithout seeking, it is like famine from no plowing,\nOr drought from no rain.\nOrdinary affairs fare as usual;\nSilkworms and fields follow the same pattern.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe earth is high, the stone unyielding—\nHardness without harmony.\nLooking up to plead to heaven,\nThere is nothing to be done.\nIn this hexagram, three yang lines occupy the earthly positions,\nWith no yang above and no one in the central place—\nIsolated, unable to nurture life.\nAll matters are hollow;\nLabor yields no results.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Malevolent Spirits**\n*One-Zero-Four*\nEvil spirits dwell in the house,\nSitting in pairs, watching.\nThey wait for transgressions,\nCutting off water and fire.\nHeavenly and earthly spirits\nLie in wait for human faults.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin and yang are unobstructed,\nYet cannot restrain one another.\nThe human position is empty,\nLeaving nothing to govern the household—\nThus, malevolent spirits fill the space.\nThis hexagram bodes ill for all matters;\nFor divining residences or illness, it is especially ominous.\n\n**He says:**\nOne should perform rites to cultivate blessings and avert misfortune,\nAnd take great care with water and fire.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nEvil spirits in the house arise from accumulated yin qi.\nYang is solitary and cut off,\nWith no one in the central position.\nWater and fire are severed—\nThe human path withers.\nThis hexagram is inauspicious for all matters.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Emptiness**\n*Two-Zero-One*\nFelling trees in water,\nFishing on a mountain.\nWasted effort, lost strength—\nEmpty hands, hollow words.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe human position is vacant,\nHeaven and earth inverted.\nAttempting deeds or creating things—\nAll come to naught.\nThus it is said:\nFelling trees in water,\nFishing on a mountain—\nNothing is gained.\nThis hexagram portends great misfortune for marriage,\nAnd illness cannot be cured—\nFor yin and yang are overturned.\n\n**He says:**\nTravelers do not return,\nThe ill grow gravely worse,\nMarriages fail to unite,\nOfficial matters are hard to resolve—\nNothing is favorable.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFelling trees in water defies the proper course.\nEmpty hands, hollow words—\nThere is nothing to sustain life.\nIn this hexagram, yin and yang are inverted,\nWith no human position—\nLike fishing on a mountain or felling trees in water.\nWhat is sought cannot be obtained;\nAll matters are inauspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Two Widows**\n*Two-Zero-Two*\nTwo women without husbands,\nQuarreling, living apart.\nThey go out and return by different paths,\nDwelling in separate chambers.\n\n**Yan says:**\nWithin and without, all is yin,\nTheir wills do not align.\nLike two women without husbands,\nThey inevitably contend.\nResidences bring misfortune;\nMarriages do not succeed.\nThis hexagram is inauspicious for all matters—\nTwo yin lack a master.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n\"Two women dwelling together,\nTheir wills do not harmonize.\"\nThis hexagram is greatly inauspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nIt is as if there is an intent to separate,\nLike moving yet not fully moving.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nAbove and below are two yin—\nWomen without husbands.\nGoing out and returning by different paths,\nThe chamber is empty.\nIn this hexagram, above and below are both yin,\nWith no master in the center—\nThus the image of two women without husbands,\nTheir wills unaligned, dwelling apart.\nFor the diviner, all matters run counter;\nWhat is sought brings misfortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Repeated Peril**\n*Two-Zero-Three*\nTwo follow one another,\nSeeking to avoid danger.\nThey encounter calamity and fall into a well—\nStrength and effort are in vain.\n\n**Yan says:**\nSeeking to evade yin’s harm,\nThey lose their position.\nAs if falling into a well in peril,\nHands and feet remain, yet strength cannot be applied.\nNothing is accomplished;\nConstruction and planning often fail.\nTraveling afar is most inauspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nDesiring action, there is nowhere to apply force.\nWhat is sought is not obtained;\nWhat is done does not succeed.\nFor divining illness, it is especially ominous.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nSeeking to avoid danger,\nTheir hearts are suspicious.\nEncountering calamity and falling into a well—\nHow lamentable.\nIn this hexagram, lesser yin is above,\nFirm yang below—\nTheir wills do not align.\nThus, they begin in suspicion and end in mutual ruin.\nThis hexagram is inauspicious for all matters.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Yin’s Depletion**\n*Two-Zero-Four*\nFrost and snow swirl,\nSoaking my robes.\nThe north wind blows upon me—\nI cannot return home.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin qi prevails,\nWithin and without, no master.\nAdrift in wind and snow,\nThe path home is lost.\nThis hexagram brings many faults;\nFor travelers, it is especially inauspicious.\nSeeking office or trade—\nNothing goes as desired.\n\n**He says:**\nNothing is accomplished;\nThere is slander and flattery—\nOne must be cautious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFrost and snow swirl—\nYin qi gathers.\nUnable to return home,\nThere is no household.\nThis hexagram is inauspicious for all matters—\nKeep far from it.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Futile Effort**\n*Three-Zero-One*\nJourneying east to gather herbs,\nOne ascends Mount Tai.\nNo magic mushrooms are found—\nOnly fragrant orchids.\nOrchids are not urgently needed;\nOne returns empty-handed.\n\n**Yan says:**\nWithin and without, pure yang—\nThey do not respond.\nDoubled hardness above,\nLike towering mountains.\nThe central position is discordant—\nDifficult to achieve merit.\nSeeking herbs and finding orchids—\nAn image of hollow beauty.\n\n**Matters of Hollow Repute**\n*Three-Zero-One*\nAll affairs bear names without substance—\nHearing joy, one feels no joy;\nHearing sorrow, one feels no sorrow.\n\n**He says:**\nMarching troops meet no fortune;\nAll pursuits fall short of desire.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nSeeking herbs and finding orchids—\nBeauty without substance.\nReturning empty-handed—\nA cause for shame.\nThis hexagram has three yang above,\nAn image of towering mountains.\nWithin and without, pure yang—\nYet the center holds no position, no resonance.\nThus, hollow beauty yields no effect.\nMerit is difficult to establish;\nOne must not act.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Rain Disaster and Hardship**\n*Three-Zero-Two*\nCeaseless downpours,\nFloodwaters surge to the heavens.\nPeople dwell in nests,\nWithout fire or kinship.\n\n**Yan says:**\nWithin and without, the lines are correct,\nBut the central position is empty.\nYin and yang clash—\nThus, rain falls without end.\nAbove, three lines—\nAn image of nest-dwelling.\nThis hexagram brings manifold faults;\nAll undertakings grow more ominous.\n\n**He says:**\nAn image of impending chaos—\nNothing goes as it should.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFloodwaters surge to the heavens—\nYin qi grows long.\nDwelling in nests without kinship—\nStrife stirs above.\nThis hexagram has three yang above,\nWhile lesser yin lengthens below.\nThe center lacks a master—\nThus, desire manifests as rain and flood.\nYang rules above,\nYet cannot make a home—\nAn image of nest-dwelling without fire.\nTo the diviner, this portends misfortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Rain Disaster and Exhaustion**\n*Three-Zero-Three*\nScorching drought brings calamity—\nHeaven and earth parched.\nOne pleads to the dragon above,\nSeeks springs below.\nAnxious and fearful,\nAll are unsettled.\n\n**Yan says:**\nHeaven and earth are both yang—\nAn image of extreme yang.\nPleading to the dragon, seeking springs—\nYet nothing stirs.\nThis hexagram is greatly inauspicious;\nFields and silkworms yield no profit.\n\n**He says:**\nDrought and scorching bring disaster—\nAbove, no benevolent moisture;\nBelow, resentment festers.\nNothing comes to fruition.\nMarriage, wealth-seeking, construction—\nAll are unfavorable.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHeaven and earth are both yang,\nWithout a human position.\nSolitary yang cannot generate—\nThus, disaster and drought arise.\nIn divination, nothing succeeds.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Distant Pursuit and Flight**\n*Three-Zero-Four*\nChasing fugitive bandits,\nOne reaches Lelang.\n\n**Hexagram of Reclaiming Lost Treasures**\n*Three-Zero-Five*\nThus, my treasured jade is reclaimed,\nMy cattle and sheep are led back.\n\n**Yan says:**\nHeaven and earth correspond,\nYin and yang hold their positions.\nThus, one journeys far to the seas,\nIlluminating and exalting nine generations.\nYet on the road, there is no master—\nThe treasured jade, cattle, and sheep\nInevitably fall to bandits.\nThis hexagram is slightly auspicious.\nFor military campaigns, there is victory;\nLelang lies in the Eastern Sea.\n\n**He says:**\nIf one seizes others’ possessions,\nIt will bring misfortune.\nHasten to return them, and it will be auspicious.\nOr if household items are taken when they should not be,\nThis, too, is inauspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nPursuing bandits and capturing fugitives\nIs a journey to achieve conquest.\nReaching Lelang\nIs the toil of a distant expedition.\nLeading back my cattle and sheep\nIs reclaiming what was lost.\nThis divination shows yin and yang in their proper positions, responding to one another,\nYet lacking a central position—\nThus, it bears the image of being robbed,\nOf suffering loss.\nOne must exert effort in a distant campaign before awaiting success.\nThe diviner labors first, then achieves;\nIn warfare, there is initial hardship, then victory.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Thieves and Bonds**\n*Four-Zero-One*\nThieves seize precious treasures,\nDesiring to make them their own.\nPeople expose their deceit,\nGhosts bind their arms.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin occupies heaven’s position,\nWhile yang is cast below—\nLike petty men usurping the vessels of gentlemen,\nDrawing the censure of both men and spirits.\n\n**He says:**\nIf illness arises from seizing others’ possessions,\nHasten to return them.\nGuard against gossip;\nThis hexagram is greatly inauspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThieves seize precious treasures,\nBut ghosts bind them—\nThey cannot possess them.\nThis, too, is shameful.\nThis divination arises from a single yin residing in heaven’s position,\nWhere it does not belong—\nThis is theft.\nThough yang is solitary and weak,\nIt is not something we can suddenly claim.\nThus, men and spirits both strike,\nAnd there is no escape.\nAll divined matters are inauspicious,\nExcept for capturing thieves, which will surely succeed.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Military Defeat and Calamity**\n*Four-Zero-Two*\nDefying the Dao, violating principle,\nYin and yang wound one another.\nAugust Heaven offers no protection—\nInstead, one reaps disaster.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin usurps yang’s position,\nThus, it is called defiance and rebellion.\nIn all matters, following principle brings auspiciousness;\nViolating principle brings misfortune.\n\n**He says:**\nIllness is difficult to cure,\nLegal matters do not resolve,\nThose who hear lawsuits are harmed,\nMilitary campaigns lose discipline,\nMerchants profit little.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nDefying the Dao, violating principle—\nPositions are improper.\nYin and yang wound one another—\nThis cannot endure.\nThis divination arises from extreme yin occupying the upper position,\nDefying the Dao.\nWith no human position in the center\nAnd no correspondence below,\nThough it may usurp for a time,\nDisaster lurks within.\nAll divined matters are inauspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Cliques and the Suppression of Worthies**\n*Four-Zero-Three*\nThe crooked advance, the upright retreat,\nFailing to hold their rightful posts.\nWorthy men hide in seclusion,\nGentlemen sigh in despair.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin advances, yang retreats—\nThus, it is called loss of office.\nWorthy men and gentlemen\nCannot be employed,\nSo they hide in seclusion and sigh.\nAs the saying goes:\n“Promote the upright, set them above the crooked,\nAnd the people will submit.\nPromote the crooked, set them above the upright,\nAnd the people will not submit.”\n\n**He says:**\nNothing succeeds;\nIt is best to withdraw and act with integrity.\nIf public words go unheeded,\nAdapting to the times brings auspiciousness.\nGentlemen meet misfortune,\nPetty men meet good fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe crooked advance, the upright retreat—\nThis is inversion.\nPetty men seize the moment,\nGentlemen withdraw.\nThis divination shows a host of yin usurping power,\nWhile yang is relegated below,\nFar from intimacy—\nThus, it bears the image of the crooked advancing, the upright retreating,\nWorthy men hiding in seclusion.\nIn all matters, it is best to retreat;\nHolding to integrity brings auspiciousness.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Verbal Strife and Auspicious Expenditure**\n*Four-Zero-Four*\nThe eastern household takes a bride,\nThe western neighbor hosts a feast.\nWith clamor and clatter, they bind the swine,\nWith yelps and barks, they beat the dogs.\nBe vigilant against misfortune,\nTo avoid external calamity.\n\n**Yan says:**\nMatters arise from a single gathering;\nDo not partake in their hall—\nThis is auspicious.\nOr if there is a wedding rite, it is auspicious,\nFor it is a gathering of like-minded friends.\n\n**He says:**\nInner and outer positions are evenly matched:\nThough the eastern household has the joy of a bride,\nThe western neighbor can still host a feast.\nThe two families slaughter dogs and beat swine,\nVying in extravagance,\nFutilely scheming and comparing—\nBoth will face verbal strife.\nIt is also said:\nThis hexagram brings disputes, legal matters, and marriages—\nOnly by yielding possessions will it be auspicious.\nFor the ill, performing good deeds is advised.\nThis hexagram is middling.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nTaking a bride, hosting a feast—\nInner and outer are evenly matched.\nIf they compete without expiation,\nCalamity will surely follow.\nThis divination shows both upper and lower as extreme yin,\nTheir forms evenly matched.\nOne household takes a bride, the other hosts a feast,\nCompeting in revelry,\nIndulging without restraint—\nThis is the nature of petty men:\nJoy reaches its peak, then turns to excess,\nAnd sorrow arises.\nThus, if one can exercise restraint, misfortune may be avoided;\nOtherwise, disputes and violent conflicts will ensue.\nThe diviner must be cautious.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of the Unmanifest**\n*One-Zero-Zero*\nPrimordial qi first stirs,\nThe myriad things are yet unformed.\nLight has not yet merged,\nEntrance and exit are shrouded in darkness.\nJust as it begins to move and take shape,\nNothing comes to fruition.\n\n**Yan says:**\nOne is the beginning of the myriad things,\nYang qi first stirs,\nYet light has not yet emerged.\nIt originates from a single line,\nSeeking the multitude of forms.\nIn all matters, there is delay;\nNothing can be swiftly accomplished.\n\n**He says:**\nAffairs do not succeed,\nThe ill recover on their own,\nAll matters are middling,\nDesires remain unfulfilled.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nPrimordial qi first stirs,\nYet nothing accompanies it.\nEntrance and exit are shrouded in darkness—\nProfound and unfathomable.\nThis hexagram shows that affairs do not succeed;\nAll matters are middling.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Transience and Subtlety**\n*Two-Zero-Zero*\nFrom heaven, images are established,\nQi still drifts and wanders.\nUnable to settle,\nIt flows east and west.\n\n**Yan says:**\nFrom one to two, the steps begin to multiply,\nYet the foundation’s traces have just emerged.\nThe human path is not yet established—\nThus, it drifts and flows,\nUnable to find stability,\nAn image of aimless wandering.\nDesires cannot be fulfilled.\n\n**He says:**\nHuman affairs are unsettled—\nAn omen of incompletion.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFrom heaven, images are established—\nIts Dao is subtle.\nFlowing east and west—\nNo foundation is laid.\n\n**Hexagram of Unsettled Affairs**\n*Three-Zero-Zero*\nHeaven and earth establish forms,\nAnd humans are transformed into life.\nFollowing qi’s ascent and descent,\nThey cannot find peace.\n\n**Yan says:**\nRulers and ministers are intermingled,\nWith no fixed abode.\nLeft to come and go freely,\nNo restraint binds them.\nThough this hexagram bears no great fault,\nAll matters remain discordant.\n\n**He says:**\nIn all affairs, there must be obstruction—\nDesires cannot be fulfilled.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHeaven and earth establish forms—\nThis is the inception of life.\nFollowing qi’s ascent and descent—\nNo settled dwelling is found.\nThis hexagram suggests some direction,\nBut one must not force action.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Death’s Image**\n*Four-Zero-Zero*\nHumans are born to die,\nAnd ghostly qi then arises.\nThe four seasons are complete,\nCold and heat succeed one another.\nSunken and obscured, unseen—\nIts body congeals in yin.\n\n**Yan says:**\nAbove lies layered yin,\nBelow, no yang position—\nThis is the image of death.\nThe dead are cut off from creation,\nYin and yang part ways,\nThe four seasons shift.\nFor the ill, worry deepens;\nIts body is dark yin—\nThe image of ghosts.\n**He says:**\nIn old age, as one nears the end,\nHosts of ghosts return—\nAn omen of misfortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nLayered yin, profound and dark—\nIt reaches its utmost above.\nYang qi is faint and obstructed—\nThe human Dao comes to an end.\nSunken and obscured, unseen—\nHow dire it is!\nThis hexagram foretells death in illness,\nAnd misfortune in all matters.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Radiant Yang**\n*Zero-One-Zero*\nHeaven’s light descends,\nSun and moon shine forth.\nAll things act as clouds,\nAnd all that have feet walk.\n\n**Yan says:**\nA single yang shines alone—\nThus, it is called \"Heaven’s Light.\"\nAll things that live\nMust rely on sun and moon.\nThough this hexagram brings minor difficulties,\nThere is hope in the end.\n\n**He says:**\nIn all matters, one should deliberate carefully—\nDo not rely entirely on others for good fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHeaven’s light descends—\nThe human Dao prospers.\nAll that have feet walk—\nNo darkness remains.\nThis hexagram, with one yang at its center,\nIs the image of sun and moon’s radiance,\nOn which all beings depend.\nIn seeking affairs, success may be hoped for, though delayed.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Year’s Abundance**\n*Zero-Two-Zero*\nHeaven and earth open and connect,\nAll things flourish.\nAffairs are now decided—\nA great harvest in the year.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThis hexagram resembles the one above,\nWith heaven and earth’s power of sowing and planting,\nLeading to great abundance.\nIt portends minor good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nIn all matters, good fortune comes late—\nDo not seek swift results.\nAct with rectitude,\nAnd all will follow suit.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe human Dao approaches prosperity.\nThis hexagram, from one to two,\nShows gradual increase—\nIn seeking affairs, progress comes step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Human Affairs**\n*Zero-Three-Zero*\nHuman affairs arise—\nAuspicious, with no misfortune.\nThose who stay gain fortune,\nThose who travel will arrive.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThree yangs reside in the center—\nThe human Dao begins to flourish.\nThough lacking support,\nGreat good fortune will ultimately come.\n\n**He says:**\nIn all matters that arise,\nAll will be unimpeded.\nTravelers will return as scheduled.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHuman affairs arise—\nYang stands at the center.\nAuspicious, with no misfortune—\nGreat success in the end.\nThis hexagram, with three yangs emerging from earth,\nIs the time of the *jianyin* month,\nWhen human affairs begin.\nHeaven and earth unite in harmony—\nAuspicious, with no misfortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Preserving the Self**\n*Zero-Four-Zero*\nGhostly qi is not yet formed,\nPerilous toxins have no shape.\nGuard and tend to life,\nAnd the household will be at peace.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe central position holds the human image—\nThus, ghostly qi is not yet formed.\nYet it occupies a weak yin position,\nWith no interaction.\nOne should guard and withdraw cautiously,\nActing in secret, not openly.\nIf assailed by ghostly perils,\nAny action will fail—\nNo good fortune comes.\n\n**He says:**\nOne should preserve the self\nAnd remain tranquil.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nGhostly qi is not yet formed—\nThere is no support.\nGuard and tend to life—\nPeaceful dwelling is fitting.\nThis hexagram, with yin in a yang position,\nHas no firm foundation.\nThe diviner should be prudent,\nWithdrawing and guarding the self in secret—\nThen no fault will arise.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Transformation and Nurturance**\n*Zero-Zero-One*\nBright, bright is the high heaven,\nShining upon the earth below.\nTransforming and nurturing all life,\nOpening and unfolding doors.\nAll affairs become clear,\nMutually gazing upon one another.\n\n**Yan says:**\nEarth, paired with heaven,\nMust receive its radiance,\nMoistening all sprouts below,\nEnabling them to grow.\n**He says:**\nIn all matters, follow the heart’s intent,\nThough progress may be slow—\nThis hexagram bears no fault.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHigh heaven shines upon the earth—\nTo bring forth life.\nMutually gazing in darkness—\nNo thing fails to flourish.\nThis hexagram, with yang coming to dwell in earth’s position,\nIs the image of high heaven’s illumination.\nIn affairs, there is initial success but no great achievement—\nYet no fault arises.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Earth’s Benefit**\n*Zero-Zero-Two*\nFoundations are established, affairs settled,\nHumans and things align in rectitude.\nDrinking pure, eating sweet,\nEach preserves its nature.\n\n**Yan says:**\nHeaven as one, earth as two—\nThus, the foundation is already laid.\nHumans and things, following this,\nEach rectify their natures—\nMinor good fortune in all matters.\n\n**He says:**\nSuccess comes slightly late,\nFor the other has not yet grown—\nAn image of good fortune in all things.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFoundations are established, affairs settled—\nThe Dao of earth is complete.\nDrinking pure, eating sweet—\nEach preserves its nature.\nIn seeking affairs with this hexagram,\nThere is good fortune from beginning to end.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Establishing the Season**\n*Zero-Zero-Three*\nAffairs flourish, works arise,\nHeroes lay foundations.\nSages and worthies save the world,\nLaws and decrees attain principle.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThree yangs occupy the lower position—\nThe image of flourishing works and arising affairs.\nTo create foundations,\nNone but heroes can achieve success.\nThus, they clarify laws to save the world.\n\n**He says:**\nIn all matters, there will be words from others\nTo assist in decision and action.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nAffairs flourish, works arise—\nThe Dao of yang is established.\nSages and worthies save the world—\nAdvancing to accomplish great deeds.\nThis hexagram, with three yangs in earth’s position,\nLays foundations and establishes enterprises.\nIts vigor and strength suffice for action,\nWith none to obstruct it.\n\n**For the Querent: Greatly Fitting to Act**\nAll affairs are wholly auspicious.\n\n**Funeral Hexagram: All Yin**\n*Zero-Zero-Four*\nNurturing life, sending off the dead,\nSacrifices pure and abundant.\nThe filial son leans on his staff,\nClothing coarse, the omen dire.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThis hexagram is of yin numbers—\nThe extreme of the ten thousand things.\nReceiving qi from Heaven,\nBorn to become human, dying to return to earth,\nThus it is called nurturing life and sending off the dead.\nThrough sacrificial rites,\nThe affairs of the filial son are made clear—\nThe passing of kin.\n\n**He says:**\nThis hexagram concerns the filial son with living parents,\nWho must be utmost in devotion,\nFor there may be mourning ahead.\nIn divining illness, it is exceedingly inauspicious;\nAll affairs are unfavorable.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nNurturing life, sending off the dead—\nThe human Dao is exhausted.\nThe bodily form returns to earth,\nTo merge with the indistinct.\nThis hexagram is the image of utter distress;\nIn divination, there is nothing it does not portend as dire.\n\n**Formless Yin Hexagram**\n*Zero-Zero-Zero*\nYin spreads formless,\nThe omen’s shape not yet formed.\nAct and there will be regret;\nRetreat to preserve integrity.\n\n**Yan says:**\nAll twelve pieces are overturned—\nThe characterless hexagram of formless yin.\nOriginally possessing form,\nYet reverting to formlessness,\nThe principle of Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, is exhausted.\nThus, the *Lingqi* begins with the lines of the first hexagram\nAnd ends with the formless body of the pieces.\nSince it lacks written lines or images\nTo constitute a hexagram,\nIt does not fall within the one hundred twenty-four hexagrams.\nThis hexagram is not fit for action;\nThus, retreat to preserve hidden integrity,\nTo dispel great misfortune.\nFor chronic illness, the patient will not die;\nFor sudden illness, the omen is dire.\n\n**He says:**\nUnfavorable for seeking;\nFitting to stay home and guard one’s resolve.\nAll affairs are without worry;\nFitting for official matters.\nIf innocent, the case will be swiftly dismissed;\nIf guilty, the matter will be difficult to resolve.\nUnfavorable for battle;\nUnattainable in seeking.\nThis hexagram brings peace to the household,\nA sign without gain or loss.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nBefore the Great Ultimate divided,\nThere was profound obscurity.\nYin and yang blended,\nTheir forms indistinct.\nRetreat in stillness, abide in silence,\nTo preserve integrity.\nThis hexagram’s fortune is undetermined;\nNo action should be taken.\nAbide in quietude and self-restraint,\nThen good fortune will come without misfortune.\nFor the querent who obtains this,\nHearing sorrow, do not grieve;\nHearing joy, do not rejoice—\nGuard steadfastness, a hexagram without gain or loss.\n\nThe *Lingqi Jing*\n\nIn the third month of the year *xinchou*, the Khitans launched a massive invasion, encircling the city of Yan. The open fields were filled without a single empty space, covered entirely in white earth. The gentry and common folk were struck with terror, while officials and subordinates were seized with confusion. The young and the weak, women and children, could not be secured even from morning to night. With no one to appeal to, I burned incense and consulted the *Lingqi Jing*. The divination yielded a hexagram of three *yang* above, two *yin* in the middle, and two *yin* below, with the following judgment: \"The land is at peace, without hardship or difficulty. Most suitable for sowing and cultivation; advantageous for travel and return.\"\n\nThe next day, the Prefect of the Bureau of Merit, the Lord of Boling, summoned me to drink and discuss the matter. Boling said, \"Yesterday, I too received this same omen.\" At that time, the Khitan siege grew increasingly pressing. A monk from my clan, who had just taken charge of the household, came to offer comfort. We again devoutly prayed and cast the lots, and the previous hexagram reappeared.\n\nBy the fifth month, no relief forces had arrived. I and my peers—Magistrate Zhou of Changping, Magistrate Wu of Huailai, and Chief Captain Zhao Zonggu—lodged at the garrison post. Anxious that the reinforcements were delayed, we spoke of the *Lingqi Jing*. At the group’s request, we devoutly prayed and cast the lots, obtaining a hexagram of two *yang* above and one *yin* in the middle. Seeing the hexagram’s form incomplete, the entire company was stunned and sighed in dismay. The judgment read: \"Entrusting matters to others, one awaits their intent day by day. Only now is joyful news obtained. Affairs will require delay, but the aspiration will ultimately be preserved.\" Yan said: \"Due to its solitary and humble position, it cannot stand alone. If auspicious, it will remain so in the end, though the outcome will be slow.\"\n\nBy the sixth month, the peril and distress had grown even more severe. I again requested to cast the lots, but the group said, \"Enough, enough. Even if a favorable hexagram appears, we dare not trust it. If it turns out ill, our sorrow will only deepen.\" I silently said to myself: \"Just cast them. If the result is good, we will rejoice; if ill, I will devise my own plan to escape.\" Thus, I cast the lots and once more obtained the hexagram of \"the land is at peace, without hardship or difficulty.\"\n\nOn the ninth day of the seventh month, my disciple, the physician Guo Tong, came to visit and offer comfort. I was not at home, so he spoke with my sons about the *Lingqi Jing*. They earnestly prayed again and cast the lots, obtaining once more the hexagram of \"the land is at peace.\" I then made a vow: if I were delivered from this calamity, I would hand-copy ten volumes of the text to transmit to those of like mind.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth day of the eighth month of that year, the great army lifted its siege. Thus did I know that utmost sincerity moves the divine, and utmost sincerity moves the numinous. With reverence, I record this affair and append it to the end of my ten-volume transcription.\n\n—Preface by Han Yun, the Purple-Gathered Mountain Recluse of the Dang Clan\n\nThe name of this scripture appears in the *Tangshu Jingji Zhi*, and the *Nanshi* further records that Hong Mi of the Southern Qi also used it to divine fortune and misfortune. The text it preserves matches this one. In our present dynasty, Yang Wengong’s *Tanyuan* likewise records this scripture, attesting to its divinations as spirit-like in accuracy. My late father once hand-copied it as a treasured family text.\n\nWhen I was still in the womb, my father had just suffered the loss of his teacher, and enemy scouts had already infiltrated our lands. He was ordered to depart with haste. Casting the lots, he obtained the hexagram \"secure as Mount Tai,\" and indeed, no harm came to him afterward. In every divination, the hexagrams proved unfailingly accurate—how numinous this scripture is!\n\nUpon close study of its prognostic verses, one must conclude they were composed by a Han-dynasty hand, not by any diviner of the Three Kingdoms or later. In essence, each divination invariably strikes the mark of affairs, unlike other arts that vaguely foretell fortune or misfortune. Its verses lean more toward the ominous than the auspicious, akin to the *Yijing*’s principle that \"fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation arise from movement.\" In any single inquiry, only one outcome is favorable, while three are fraught with misfortune, regret, or humiliation—is this not the natural principle of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness?\n\nAmong the divination texts of our age, the *Yijing* and *Liuren* are the most reliable for discerning the constant Dao, yet their meanings run deep and obscure, difficult to grasp. At worst, their interpretations branch into myriad possibilities, and their calculations diverge. How could they compare to this scripture, so clear and penetrating, revealing its judgments with simplicity and directness?\n\n—Inscribed by Zhang Shi of Nanxuan",

      "translated_text": "**The Orthodox Classic of the Divine Chess: Preface**\n\nThe *Orthodox Classic of the Divine Chess* is a work of uncertain authorship, annotated by Yan Youming of the Jin dynasty and continued by He Chengtian of the Liu-Song dynasty. It comprises two scrolls. The base text is derived from the *Zhengtong Daoist Canon*, *Tai Xuan* section. Collated versions include Dunhuang manuscript P.4048, volume 719.\n\n**Preface to the *Divine Chess Classic***\n\nThe origins of the *Divine Chess Classic* are unknown. Some say Emperor Wu of Han commanded Dongfang Shuo to employ it, and none of his ancient divinations failed—his art relied on this book. Others claim the Yellow Stone Elder bestowed it upon Zhang Liang. Still others recount the esoteric affairs of the Prince of Huainan, also attributing them to this text. Likely, later admirers embellished its reputation to exalt its art, but how could it truly be the work of all these figures?\n\nThough I had long heard of it, I paid it little mind, deeming it not a classic or historical work. By the end of the Kaicheng era, as I prepared to journey to Min, I heard of the Jian River, where rocks barred the surging rapids, and boatmen scaled perilous crags. Even the bravest warriors would sweat and tremble—how much more so a coward like me? As a scholar, I could not resolve my fear.\n\nUpon reaching Si, I encountered my cousin An and confessed my timidity. An said, \"I’ve heard the Jian River is not so treacherous—those tales are exaggerated.\" He possessed a divination book that could dispel doubt, so I asked him to consult it. The oracle read:\n\n*\"Above and below, the heart is at peace,\nNo treachery arises within.\nStand firm, free from care,\nHeed not idle rumors.\"*\n\nI laughed, and indeed, the rumors proved false. An then entrusted the book to me, and I carried it to Min. My journey was untroubled, and I came to trust its wisdom. Whenever I sought answers to other doubts, they were as clear as if I had witnessed them myself.\n\nAlas! What the world dismisses may yet be a supreme treasure, while what it esteems may not be truly fine. A single volume of this book resolved my uncertainties—how could it not be prized?\n\nFrom this, I understood that a scholar’s rise or fall, wealth or poverty, is fated, and cannot be judged by a single path. Examining the book, it seemed the work of one who had attained the Dao. Twelve chess pieces are divided into three sets of four—upper, middle, and lower—cast to form a hexagram, then matched to the text to reveal its meaning.\n\nThe upper four represent Heaven, the middle four Humanity, and the lower four Earth—the trinity of the Three Powers. Each of the twelve pieces bears an inscription, akin to the judgments of the *Zhou Changes*. Cast together, they form a hexagram, hence the name *Divine Chess*.\n\nLater, while serving as an official in Fuzhou, I had ample leisure. I gathered dozens of versions, collated and corrected them, removing errors and preserving truth, compiling them here. Future scholars may study it without doubt.\n\nDuring my time in Min, the distance from my homeland stretched thousands of miles across land and water, leaving me uneasy. One day, I cast the pieces and obtained the hexagram *\"The Broad Way of Heaven\"*, its words most auspicious. I trusted its promise. Yet, days after leaving Min, an imperial decree summoned me as an imperial censor. The divination had foretold this—was it not divine?\n\nWritten in the ninth month of autumn, the ninth year of Huichang, by Li Yuan, Gentleman for Ceremonial Service of the Ministry of Justice.\n\n---\n\nThe *Divine Chess Classic* is a legacy of the Yellow Stone Elder. Some say it is Dongfang Shuo’s method of divination. Others claim it was composed by Zhang Liang or the Prince of Huainan, Liu An, annotated by Yan Youming of the Jin and He Chengtian of the Song, with a preface by Li Yuan of the Tang. Transmitted through the ages as the Yellow Stone Elder’s work, the *Bibliographic Treatise of the Tang Dynasty*’s *Five Elements* section records only its title.\n\nIts method employs twelve round pieces carved from jujube wood struck by lightning. The oracles number one hundred and twenty-four. Four pieces symbolize Heaven, inscribed with \"upper\"; four symbolize Humanity, inscribed with \"middle\"; and four symbolize Earth, inscribed with \"lower.\" After prayer, they are cast, and the oracle is consulted to determine fortune or misfortune.\n\nThe *History of the Southern Qi* records Jiang Mi’s divination, yielding: *\"A guest comes from the south, bestowing fine wealth—treasures, jewels, golden cups, and jade vessels.\"* Yang Wengong’s *Garden of Talks* records that in the first year of Xianping, while seeking an external appointment, he cast three upper, two middle, and one lower pieces, matching Jiang Mi’s oracle. At the time, the compilation of the *Veritable Records of Taizong* was unfinished, so his request was denied. Soon after, he was appointed as an envoy for a prince’s birthday and received gifts of silver vessels. Later, he cast again, obtaining four middle and three lower pieces, the *\"Avoiding the World\"* oracle, which read:\n\n*\"Petty men prevail,\nNoble ones lose the Way.\nLeave my home,\nEnter the deep grass.\"*\n\nHe indeed fell ill and returned to Yangdi. Other divinations were equally accurate, but each casting pertained to a single matter—repeating it yielded no result. As the saying goes: *\"To profane is to receive no answer; divination is not repeated.\"*\n\nZhu Xi, in his discussions with Lin Zhengqing on the *Changes*, remarked: \"Recently, someone asked about the *Changes*. I replied, 'Have you seen the *Divine Chess* oracles? The *Changes* is much the same.'\" Observing the prefaces and annotations from the Jin, Song, and Tang dynasties, as well as the words of two Song masters, one trusts it as an ancient text. Great sacrifices to the divine tortoise, divination methods—all are preserved. Even methods like milfoil stalks or tile divination are usable; how much more so an ancient text from the Qin and Han?\n\nAlas! The ruler’s mandate extends across the vast heavens; the sun’s brilliance endures as if present. Above, as if present; beside, as if present—such is the power of the spirits. Knock, and they respond; move them, and they commune. Is not the spirit of the heart worthy of reverence?\n\nMaster Zhang Nanxuan, during a drought in Bagui, cast the pieces under the scorching sun and obtained the sixty-second oracle, *\"Yin Prolongs\"*:\n\n*\"Water deep in the courtyard,\nBoats row beneath the hall.\"*\n\nSoon after, heavy rain fell. This is recorded in his *Recorded Sayings*.\n\nThis book was once in my late father’s collection. Its oracles distinguish yin and yang, odd and even; only when yang prevails over yin is it auspicious.",

      "translated_text": "When divining, one must first compose the spirit, purify with incense, don proper attire, and sit in stillness. After a moment of focused contemplation, hold the twelve casting pieces with reverence, exhale upon them, and offer a prayer. Then cast all twelve pieces at once, arranging the resulting *upper*, *middle*, and *lower* characters in sequence to form a hexagram. Discard any scattered pieces and consult the manual to interpret the outcome. For each matter divined, cast the pieces only once—repeated casting renders fortune and misfortune uncertain.\n\nDuring the Song era, Wang Yin and his brothers, along with He Chengtian, deliberated upon this classic. Those who approached it with sincere devotion invariably found its judgments accurate. Yet many, failing to grasp its subtle principles, dismissed it as ineffective and treated it with disdain. He who discerns the incipient knows more than half the truth; he who remains unaware of the incipient misjudges even the slightest movement. To know both the incipient and the movement is to comprehend more than half the Way. Whether one withdraws or advances, accepts or rejects, these paths diverge—one cannot assume that a single auspicious phrase confirms predestined fate.\n\nThus, \"In the northeast, friends are lost,\" yet in the end, there is cause for celebration. \"The traveler gains an ox,\" but this portends disaster for the villagers. \"Darkness in *Mingyi*,\" \"Greatness in *Feng*’s upper trigram\"—these cannot be discussed as equals. The hexagrams, divided into *upper*, *middle*, and *lower*, embody the *Yijing*’s principle of the Three Powers. Through permutations, they yield a total of one hundred twenty-four hexagrams, with odd and even numbers determining fortune and misfortune. Odd numbers are yang, and yang is auspicious; even numbers are yin, and yin is inauspicious. By this method, fortune and misfortune become clear.\n\nThe words accompanying each hexagram are its *yao* text. The diviner must focus solely on their truth or falsehood, for therein virtue and vice are determined. If the meaning of the words does not align with the situation, one should carefully consider their intent. For instance, phrases like \"majestic and resplendent, attaining without seeking\" bode well for matters such as pursuing fugitives or recovering lost items, but not for divining illness or marriage. Similarly, \"A year of prosperity, a month of flourishing—how can one know the stability of Mount Tai?\" suggests that when treading danger, seeking wealth is auspicious, yet for one wandering far from home longing for return, the outcome remains uncertain.\n\nAgain, \"Ruler and minister exchange positions, great fortune arises\"—this is auspicious for the noble person but dire for the petty. Or \"Thieves plunder my home, the worthy conceal themselves and advance\"—this is auspicious for the petty but inauspicious for the noble. All such interpretations must be deduced by analogy. The distinction between noble and petty lies not in rank or power but in orientation: those who turn toward the Dao are noble, while those who turn away are petty. The wise employ this method without confusion.",

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, before the sages composed the *Yi*, the people used spirit divining blocks, which were modeled after the *Yi*. The Way of the *Yi* is profound and difficult to comprehend, thus they created the symbolic system of spirit blocks. Though it does not exhaust the subtleties of the *Yi*, without mastery of the *Yi*, how could one compose the oracles of the spirit blocks?\n\nThe system of spirit blocks takes three as its warp and four as its weft. The three positions—above, middle, and below—represent Heaven, Humanity, and Earth. They also signify the ruler, the minister, and the people. The four configurations—one as *shaoyang*, three as *taiyang*, two as *shaoyin*, and four as *laoyin*—pair *shaoyang* with *shaoyin* as harmonious, while *taiyang* with *taiyang* becomes adversarial. Harmony brings joy, while adversity sparks conflict—this is the constant Way. Yet sometimes, losing the Way, harmony may invert into enmity; or by aligning with its course, adversity may transform into utility—such are its permutations.\n\nWhen yang prevails, paths align and mutual illumination follows. When yin dominates, intentions diverge and discord arises. This marks the division between the noble and the petty. The alternation of yin and yang, the differentiation of forms, and the shifting of names—such is the Way of the *Yi*. The *Yi* draws its symbols from chariots, buckets, arrows, hares, foxes, and the like; yet by extension, it encompasses all things under Heaven. It speaks of a horse yet signifies a dragon, or names water yet implies transformation—this is the meaning of the *Yi*. Without penetrating the mysteries of all under Heaven, one cannot grasp it. Thus, the spirit blocks were created in emulation of the *Yi*, and only those deeply versed in the *Yi* can master them.\n\nI have always admired the accuracy of its divinations but lamented that interpreters fail to fully convey the author’s intent. Therefore, I have expanded upon its principles and elucidated its meaning.\n\n**Method for Crafting the Blocks**\nUse *pili* wood, catalpa, jujube, or white sandalwood, measuring one *cun* and two *fen* in diameter, three *fen* in thickness, and perfectly round, calibrated to the *zhou* ruler. Cut the wood on a *jiazi* day, inscribe it on a *bingzi* day, carve it on a *wuzi* day, apply cinnabar grains on a *gengzi* day, and store it in a case on a *renzi* day. The case should be made of *ziwei* wood.\n\n**Preparation of Pokeweed (Shanglu)**\nTake any quantity of pokeweed root, pare away the thin outer layer with a bronze knife, and slice it thinly. Soak it in east-flowing water for two nights, then steam it in a steamer, layering it with bean leaves. Steam from noon until midnight, remove the bean leaves, dry the root in the sun, and finely chop it for use as sacrificial jerky.\n\n**Invocation and Incantation**\n*\"Heaven is clear, Earth is tranquil; the River Chart holds its numen. A single censer of sacred incense purifies the ten directions. Three rolls of the ritual drum summon all spirits to heed.\"*\n\n**Prayer**\n*\"Heaven and Earth unite their virtue, sun and moon their brightness; the four seasons keep their order, ghosts and spirits align with fortune and misfortune. August Heaven is impartial, aiding only those with virtue. On this day, in this year, this month, this day, [name and native place], I reverently burn incense and invoke the gods of the Four First Months, the Four Middle Months, the Four Seasons, the Twelve Earthly Branches, the Celestial and Terrestrial Parents, the Supreme Primordial Sovereign, the Sun to the left and Moon to the right, the Five Stars and Northern Dipper, the Twenty-Eight Constellations, the Four Seasons and Five Phases, the Six Jia and Yin-Yang, the Hall of Light and Yearly Virtue, the Twelve Celestial Gods, the Twelve Terrestrial Spirits, the Year, Month, Day, and Hour Officers, and the Attendant Messengers of Merit: I, born at this hour, humbly present my purpose regarding [state matter]. My heart holds a wish, my mind harbors doubt; hesitant and uncertain, I seek your judgment. Favor or ill, fortune or misfortune—let the oracle decide. I reverently await your sagely illumination and manifest response.\"*\n\n**Incantation**\n*\"Om hum hum ma-ni da-li hum cha chi.\"*\nRecite three times in a single breath.\n\nThen cast the twelve blocks at once, forming a hexagram according to the upper, middle, and lower positions. Consult the oracle’s words to determine fortune or misfortune.\n\n**Closing Prayer for Sending Forth the Spirits**\n*\"Having invoked your presence and reverently consulted the spirit blocks, I have received your gracious response. Now I humbly send you forth. May you return adorned with clouds and mist, ascending to your palaces in the celestial vault. As you came, you bestowed grace; as you depart, leave blessings behind. Whenever summoned, return as before.\"*\n\n**Sacrificial Rite**\nOn the seventh day of the first lunar month each year, fast and bathe according to the ritual. By the waterside, prepare a mat, wine, fruit, incense, jerky, and paper candles. Invoke the spirits as previously described, then clasp the left hand in a mudra, bow, and sigh:\n*\"Heaven is clear, Earth is numinous; dragons and tigers hold their power. The Six Jia and Six Ding spirits follow my command. Banish evil, uphold the right, emerging from darkness into light.\"*",

If the great aspires to the small, there will be peril and ruin.*\nHe also says: *Heaven and Earth having taken their places, the sage harmonizes with them. Ordering the primordial chaos, inaugurating the origin of creation—thus it is said: from low to high.*\n\n*Establishing merit and creating systems, nothing is not auspicious. Secret schemes and covert plans are inadvisable; the elderly, the ill, and marriage unions are unfavorable, for pure yang is difficult to harmonize. Travelers have not returned; those imprisoned will be released; merchants profit.*\n\nHe says: *For official advancement, visibility is auspicious, concealment inauspicious. The ill should not remain in dark places; it is fortunate to avoid them by going elsewhere. Slander brings no harm; households prosper greatly. Military campaigns are auspicious; battles are victorious. Pregnancies yield sons; fields, silkworms, fishing, and hunting bring great bounty. All is auspicious.*\n\nExplanation: *From small to great—yang begins to grow. Three hearts in accord—journeying forth is fitting. Inauspicious to conceal brilliance—its way is radiant. This divination’s three positions are all yang; lesser yang is just rising, thus the image of ascending from small to great, from low to high. Those who obtain it—whether initiating enterprises, seeking fame, or pursuing profit—all is auspicious. Litigants should seek justice through upright means; travelers are fortunate but have not yet returned. Secretive or deceptive schemes must not be undertaken. The ill will worsen; avoiding them brings fortune.*\n\n**Gradual Peace** Divination – *Receiving Blessings* Hexagram  1-1-2\n*Dwelling in tranquility, establishing one’s enterprise—possessions increase. Both wealthy and noble, though emolument and rank have not yet arrived.*\n\nYan says: *Calm the heart and steady the will to await the seasons—then all will be auspicious. If one seeks hasty fulfillment, it will not come to pass.*\nHe also says: *Yin and yang having taken their rightful places, the Dao of Heaven and Earth is thus attained by humanity. This is the image of settling into one’s vocation. Seeking office, pursuing wealth, managing fields and silkworms—all are auspicious. Marriage is initially difficult but later easy. Travelers will arrive; households are at peace. Legal matters do not come to fruition; imprisoned persons will be released through effort.*\n\nHe says: *Distant travelers arrive; pregnancies yield sons. Legal matters and imprisonment will be absolved by imperial pardon. The ill will not die; all affairs are auspicious.*\n\nExplanation: *Dwelling in tranquility and managing property—firmness and softness are balanced. This is not desired outwardly, yet blessings are received in reality. In this divination, two yang are above and one yin below; the positions of the Three Powers are all fitting. Thus the image of being both wealthy and noble—it is fitting to preserve this and not indulge in insatiable desires, then all will be auspicious. Households and marriages are settled; legal matters encounter no obstruction. Travelers have not returned; seeking office leads to attainment and governance. Hearing of misfortune, one need not grieve; though illness has not yet abated, it brings no harm.*\n\n**Abundant Fortune** Divination – *Auspicious Celebration* Hexagram  1-1-3\n*Resplendent and illustrious, the household possesses gold and silk. Supplies are complete, affairs are settled—without seeking, one obtains.*\n\nYan says: *Having gold and silk, there is no need for seeking. Dwelling at home is auspicious; travelers have not returned.*\nHe also says: *Heaven generates the myriad things—its principle is ever-abundant. Without need for striving, all naturally comes to fruition. This hexagram is pure yang; marriages are not harmonious. The imprisoned are without guilt; fields and silkworms succeed. All other affairs are auspicious.*\n\nHe says: *Travelers are about to arrive; pregnancies yield sons. Merchants profit; legal matters and imprisonment are absolved by pardon. Pursuits and suppressions all succeed.*",

      "translated_text": "**Explication:**\n*Resplendent and illustrious*—this is pure yang. *The household possesses gold and silk*—the earthly Dao shines. *Supplies are complete, affairs are settled*—its power is abundant and strong. *Without seeking, one obtains*—its fruitfulness flourishes. This hexagram has three yang lines with the lower position thriving; the earthly Dao produces things, thus gold and silk overflow and affairs are settled. The fullness of yang is rooted below, while lesser yang rises above—like a tree with a flourishing root and abundant fruit, hence the image of obtaining without seeking. For one who casts this divination, all pursuits are auspicious. Managing property is most favorable; in war, great victory; in pursuit, the fugitive is captured. In litigation, one spends wealth but prevails; in illness, it is inauspicious; those in hiding cannot escape.\n\n---\n\n**Divination – *Abundant Prosperity***\nHexagram 4\n*Abundant wealth, utmost nobility—the Dao of Heaven turns and shifts. Following the course, rising and falling, waxing with the times, waning with the seasons. Descendants by the tens of thousands, by the hundreds of millions.*\n\nYan says: *One who dwells in wealth and nobility yet does not forget poverty and lowliness will have a name that flows to posterity. If one cannot practice humility and retreat, ruin will surely come. Travelers are on the road; it will be long before they return.*\nHe also says: *From the second to the fourth line, the earthly Dao is twice fulfilled. The principle of wealth and nobility reaches its apex here. Yet when fullness is attained, it must wane; when high, it is perilous—hence \"turns and shifts.\" If one follows the ebb and flow of yin and yang, not opposing the times, one can preserve body and reputation, and blessings will extend to descendants. This hexagram favors humility and retreat; prisoners will have difficulty leaving. Those awaiting others will face slight delays; travelers will not depart.*\n\nHe says: *The ill will recover slowly; it is fitting to sacrifice to the heavenly spirits and seek blessings. Marriages and weddings are auspicious; those accumulating wealth should not add further. Distant travel is inadvisable; hasty words may lead to official disputes—it is best to seek those who uphold the law.*\n\n**Explication:**\n*Abundant wealth, utmost nobility*—the household’s enterprise is complete. *Following the course, rising and falling*—to preserve fullness. *Descendants by the tens of thousands*—it is not fitting to contend. This divination has yang above and old yin below, with upper and lower in their proper places. It bears the image of position and substance, wealth and nobility at their peak, with nothing left to add. Thus, one should follow the course of the times, know contentment, and avoid recklessness—then one may preserve one’s own success, and descendants will guard it without loss. Marriages are auspicious; seeking office, pursuing wealth, and awaiting matters have all reached fruition—one must not overreach. Those awaiting travelers should cease, for it is auspicious; in official matters, seek harmony—if pressed further, there will be regret. Illness will recover; in war, one should not act rashly—if an encounter occurs, halting is auspicious. Trust in others is lacking; when matters reach their extreme, they must reverse. What was auspicious may turn inauspicious, and what was inauspicious may turn auspicious. The Dao of joy and harmony leads to the *Surprise and Delight* Hexagram.\n\n---\n\n**Divination – *Surprise and Delight***\nHexagram 1-2-\n*Firm without, yielding within—harmony and unity are all-encompassing. Nurturing nature, preserving life, roaming with the spirits.*\n\nYan says: *What is sought is contrary; one should only preserve oneself. The ill have not recovered; it is fitting to make offerings and pray—there is no cause for worry. Official duties will not advance; matters will not succeed. Prisoners will have difficulty leaving.*\nHe also says: *Marriages are auspicious; pregnancies yield sons. The ill should seek the spirits; merchants profit; in war, great fortune.*\n\nHe says: *Yin occupies a yang position—hence \"firm without.\" One should not force advancement; nurturing nature and preserving life is the image of self-sufficiency.*\n\n**Explication:**\n*Firm without, yielding within*—it is fitting to be in accord with others. *Planning carefully, acting cautiously*—to preserve one’s whole person. *Roaming with the spirits*—this is not inauspicious. This divination has one yin line amid two yang lines, hence the image of firmness without and yielding within. Yin occupies a yang position—it is not fitting to act. Thus, one should harmonize, be circumspect, and preserve—then it is auspicious. In illness, there are malevolent spirits; sacrifices are auspicious. Litigation will not succeed; marriages and commerce are auspicious. In war, do not fight; prisoners will have difficulty leaving. Rumors are often false and deceitful—secret plans are fitting. The *Fright* Hexagram leads to *Minor Peril.*\n\n---\n\n**Divination – *Fright***\nHexagram 1-2-2\n*A rooster crows at noon, climbing the roof and stretching its neck. The hen is below the wall—startled by a fox. Cutting off its cry, it flees—its body is spared harm.*\n\nYan says: *In all matters, initial difficulty and distress will ultimately bring no other misfortune. In all undertakings, there is first ruin, then success. Travelers have not arrived; illness should be treated early.*\nHe also says: *The upper responds to the lower, but is blocked by the middle—unable to aid one another, hence the fright. Yet, dwelling in a high position, it ultimately controls and governs; cutting off its cry, it flees—disaster is averted.*",

      "translated_text": "The male belongs to yang, the female to yin—the natural predator of chickens is none other than the fox. This hexagram portends that official matters will not succeed, and prisoners will only be released with powerful assistance.\n\nHe says: Travelers may encounter bandits; seeking office, marriage, or trade will all be unfavorable. Borrowing or seeking aid will be difficult, and desires will be thwarted. Fields and silkworms will yield no harvest. In all matters, there will first be worry, then good fortune.\n\nExplanation: One male and one female—there is secret contention. The firm and strong reside above, and the yielding cannot overpower them. Moving in accord with the proper response ensures no collapse. This divination shows a young yang occupying the honored position, while the two yin below both desire to act. The upper and lower correspond but are blocked by the middle, hence the image of the rooster crowing atop the roof while the hen below is startled by a fox. Yet, as yang holds the superior position and governs, and the middle yin is not yet dominant, they ultimately unite without harm or ruin. Divined affairs will require effort—first peril, then peace. Travelers will return but face obstacles midway. Military campaigns will bring fear; illness should be treated urgently. Seeking office or marriage will be obstructed by others. One must rely on the powerful—all will first be difficult, then obtained.\n\n**Abundance – *Year of Plenty***\nHexagram 1-2-3\n*First month, noon hour—year in Great Beam. The east wind thaws the ice; plowing and mulberry thrive. By year’s end, the harvest will be abundant, and joy will be boundless.*\n\nYan says: For all endeavors, the years, months, and days of *zi*, *wu*, *mao*, and *you* will be auspicious, though results may come slowly. Without these years, months, or days, fields and silkworms will not prosper, yet no misfortune will arise.\nHe also says: This is the image of yin departing and yang arriving—the year resides in the *you* month, Great Beam.\nThe *Diagnosis* says: When the Great Year is in *you*, even begging for water yields wine—such is its abundance.\nThis hexagram governs fields and silkworms as auspicious. Officials will not yet attain their posts, but those in office will have no worries; the ill will suffer no harm.\n\nHe says: Travel by water or land, marriage, and harmony—all are greatly auspicious, the hexagram of talent.\nExplanation: Heaven and humanity are in harmony, yin following yang. The land is fertile and expansive—fitting for fields and mulberry. At the juncture of *wu* and *you*, fortune is unstoppable. This divination shows young yang above, with young yin in the middle following it—the positions of heaven and humanity are proper. Vigorous yang occupies the earthly position; above is harmony, below is abundance, hence fields and silkworms thrive. The \"first month\" refers to the initial line, and \"Great Beam\" is *you*. The lower three form *Li*, which is *wu*; the middle two form *Dui*, which is *you*. All divined affairs will proceed as desired, with results manifesting in the years, months, or days of *wu* and *you*, or in the *you* direction.\n\n**Minor Excess – *Minor Success***\nHexagram 1-2-4\n*Disaster arises from below—beware a single servant. Secret plots converge, hands and feet poised to act.*\n\nYan says: Though yang holds its position, it is plotted against by the many yin. Thus, a servant harbors secret schemes to cause harm. Be wary of those nearby. This hexagram portends worry in all matters, though no great misfortune will arise. Official affairs will nearly conclude, but prisoners will struggle to be freed—due to yang’s weakness.\n\nHe says: Travelers will encounter bandits; those at home will face troubles. Servants will cause harm; groups will stir gossip. Endeavors will not succeed; the ill will be cursed by subordinates.\nExplanation: A solitary yang above is weak in power. Yin thrives within the household—there is concern over servants. This divination shows one yang above, with strong yin below and young yin in the middle. The weak and yielding cannot control what lies beneath, hence the image of disaster arising from below—beware the servant. All divined affairs will be unfavorable. This and the sixth hexagram both feature one yang above, yet their divinations differ. In the latter, the lower position is young yin, which harbors the intent to follow above but is blocked by the middle. Here, however, the yin is mature, acting wantonly below, and the middle cannot restrain it. It is like a weak husband and young wife managing a household, where fierce servants and defiant maids refuse their master’s commands—its inauspiciousness is self-evident.\n\n**Attaining Aspirations – *Self-Sufficiency***\nHexagram 1-3-1\n*Ambitions clearly attained, in harmony with the times. Wealth and resources are abundant, with no lack of servants.*\n\nYan says: Aspirations are fulfilled, resources are sufficient, and servants are at hand.\nHe also says: Pure yang governs—this is the image of attaining aspirations. With utmost impartiality in heart, wealth and resources are fully provided.\nMaster Han says: When King Wen campaigned against Chong, he reached the ruins of Yellow Crane. His sandal strap broke, and as he turned to fix it, all around him were worthy men—none could be dispatched, so he tied it himself. This is the way of the noble person, holding to the Dao of utmost impartiality.\n\nHe says: Officials will enjoy abundant emoluments; distant travelers will arrive. The ill will recover; prisoners will be freed. Pregnant women will bear sons; trade will be profitable. This is the image of great success in all endeavors.\nExplanation: The dragon attains the proper center—greatly in accord with the times. Above and below harmonize and follow, sufficient for great deeds. This divination shows vigorous yang occupying its position, attaining aspirations and the times, with the young yang above and below united in purpose. What worry could there be over insufficient resources or lack of servants? For the diviner, nothing sought will not be obtained—this is the most auspicious of divinations.\n\n**Fulfillment – *Coming Prosperity***\nHexagram 1-3-2\n*Once desires were unmet—now they are fulfilled. All things attain their proper order; affairs proceed with clarity.*\n\nYan says: First, one attains aspirations, with loyalty and goodness as the foundation. Private matters are not fitting. Travelers will return; the ill will recover.\nHe also says: The positions of the Three Powers are correct; yin and yang are harmonious. This is the Dao of the noble person—here, it is prosperity. Promotion and longevity will increase; trade will be profitable. All affairs will be auspicious.\n\nHe says: Marriage and harmony will unite; undertakings will greatly succeed. Fields and silkworms will thrive; the distressed will attain their aspirations. Prisoners will be freed; endeavors will fulfill desires. Travelers will arrive soon. Affairs proceed with clarity—all things attain their proper order.\nExplanation: *Once desires were unmet*—the yielding was within.",
      "overlap_context": " it flees—its body is spared harm.*\n\nYan says: *In all matters, initial difficulty and distress will ultimately bring no other misfortune. In all undertakings, there is first ruin, then success. Travelers have not arrived; illness should be treated early.*\nHe also says: *The upper responds to the lower, but is blocked by the middle—unable to aid one another, hence the fright. Yet, dwelling in a high position, it ultimately controls and governs; cutting off its cry, it flees—disaster is averted.*",

      "translated_text": "The yang flourishes and acts externally—this is the time of opening and prosperity. Upright and selfless, its Dao thus becomes great. In this divination, the positions of the Three Powers are correct, yin and yang harmonize, and the noble person’s single Dao prospers. One should not engage in private or hidden matters but rather in upright and magnanimous affairs. The diviner who obtains this will find great fortune.\n\n**Talent Flourishes, Divination of Peace and Auspiciousness** *(1-3-3)*\nAbundant are the scholars, their virtuous power shining brightly.\nMeetings bring joy, lasting happiness without misfortune.\n\nYan says: One advances by talent and will receive aid from noble persons. By year’s end, success will come, and its strength will not be singular. The ill will recover, travelers return, and all affairs will be auspicious. If one seeks audience with kings or lords or pursues fame, it will be even better.\n\nHe says: Seeking office will fulfill aspirations; travelers will arrive. Trade, fields, and silkworms will be profitable; marriages will be auspicious. The ill will recover, legal matters will not succeed—this divination is highly favorable.\n\nExplanation: *Abundant are the scholars*—they follow those above. *Meetings bring joy*—the journey will be honored. In this divination, one yang occupies the upper position, while the middle and lower positions are all three yang. This resembles a ruler possessing firm and enlightened virtue, with many worthy followers. For commoners, it signifies the assistance of noble persons and good friends. Divining for office, meeting superiors, marriage, trade, or military affairs—all will be auspicious. In warfare, one will gain worthy allies; in endeavors, one will receive assistance—all is fortunate.\n\n**Leisure Divination, Divination of Joyful Travel** *(1-3-4)*\nRiding dragons and driving steeds, roaming the four directions.\nJoyful and content, boundless delight in travel.\n\nYan says: Follow your heart’s desires—east, west, south, or north—nearly all matters will succeed. Travelers have not yet returned; the ill will recover on their own. *The Book of Changes* says: *At the right time, ride the six dragons to govern the heavens.* It also says: *The mare belongs to the earthly kind, traveling the earth without bounds.*\n\nHe says: Lost thieves and stolen goods will be recovered; a male child will be born. Trade will be profitable; marriage will naturally align. Fields and silkworms will flourish; those in bonds will have no worries—all affairs will be resolved.\n\nExplanation: *Riding dragons and driving steeds*—the lower submits and supports. *Roaming the four directions*—none dare oppose me. In this divination, one yang resides above, while the middle and lower positions are balanced. The three yang are dragons, the four yin are steeds—each finds its proper place and serves me. Thus, one may roam the four directions, delighting without end. The diviner who obtains this should boldly advance. Only in inquiring about travelers will they not return, though they will fare well abroad.\n\n**Worry Divination, Divination of Isolation** *(1-4-1)*\nAbove alone, below solitary—schemed against by the treacherous.\nThe illness of the heart’s chamber cannot be swiftly cured.\nOnly when the season of yang spring arrives will one regain freedom.\n\nYan says: One will constantly harbor fear, dreading harm, but with the rescue of a noble person, all will ultimately be without fault. For the ill, recovery will come in the second or third month. It is also said: Two yang are separated by layers of yin, beyond aid. This resembles treacherous ministers usurping power, first harming petty men. It is an omen of worry and harm—few affairs will be auspicious, and travelers will encounter obstacles.\n\nHe says: Managing property will not be auspicious; one will be plotted against by thieves. The ill will recover slowly; prisoners will not be released—this divination is slightly inauspicious.\n\nExplanation: *Above alone, below solitary*—yin flourishes within. Petty men create barriers, and aspirations cannot be communicated. Upholding integrity and awaiting the right time will preserve the center. In this divination, the upper and lower positions are both one yang, while four yin reside in the middle, forming a clique of petty men. This is the omen of the true Dao being obstructed. All divined matters will face barriers and misfortune. One should uphold integrity to guard against disaster. This resembles the fifth divination, but here, the worry arises because the four yin form a clique, their power vast and difficult to remove. Thus, one must wait for the yang season, when the solitary yang’s assistance arrives, to resolve the crisis.\n\n**Vigilance Divination, Divination of Thieves** *(1-4-2)*\nHeaven and earth are vast and relaxed; petty men act freely.\nProhibitions are unenforced; thieves invade my home.\n\nYan says: One will lose property, and the head of the household will fall ill, recovering only by autumn. This divination greatly favors upholding integrity; it is not suitable for pursuing affairs. Travelers have no set return date; those chasing fugitives will not succeed.\n\nHe says: Medicine will not benefit the ill; legal matters will not be resolved lightly. Seeking wealth will yield little profit; one must guard against thieves at home—this divination is highly inauspicious.\n\nExplanation: *Heaven and earth are vast and relaxed*—laws and orders are implemented. *Thieves invade my home*—one cannot oversee them. The sigh of the noble person is the joy of the petty man. In this divination, a multitude of yin surrounds one yang. Yin flourishes in the middle position, and though the lower originally responds to the upper, it is blocked by the middle and instead allies with it. Thus, the noble person’s chamber is occupied by thieves. The diviner should guard against thieves. Matters of home, property, trade, office, warfare, or travel—all will be inauspicious. Only in fleeing or hiding will one find fortune.\n\n**Destroying Thieves, Divination of Enforcing Orders** *(1-4-3)*\nThe lord’s command oversees affairs, punishing and eliminating treachery and villainy.\nWielding spears and brandishing halberds, great undertakings will follow.\n\nYan says: One should be employed by others or employ others; acting independently will lead to failure. The ill are afflicted by spirits—exorcism is advisable. Travelers are safe; pursuing them will be auspicious. Divining for suppressing rebels or capturing fugitives will ensure victory. Treachery within, villainy without—this divination favors small victories over great ones. Trade will be profitable; seeking office will succeed. Fields, silkworms, and marriages will all be auspicious.\n\nHe says: The king’s punitive expeditions will prove effective. Legal matters will resolve themselves; no affairs will be inauspicious.\n\nExplanation: *Yin obstructs the middle*—seeking to rectify it. *The lord’s command punishes*—military strength is abundant. *Wielding spears and brandishing halberds*—to strike at illness. In this divination, yin obstructs the middle, but the lord’s command to punish it is backed by formidable force. Thus, one wields weapons to eliminate harm. The diviner who obtains this will find great success in advancing.",

      "translated_text": "In this divination, a single yang occupies its proper position above, while three yang forces flourish below, with four yin forces residing in the middle. Though yin seeks to obstruct, the three yang powers unite in virtue. Thus, yin’s treachery is exposed, giving rise to the image of the lord’s command and officers mobilizing to eliminate villainy and calamity. For military campaigns or capturing fugitives, great victory is assured. The sick will recover upon treatment; in legal disputes, the righteous will prevail. Travelers will remain unharmed; obstacles will be overcome. All undertakings will be auspicious.\n\n**Defeated in Battle: The General’s Loss Hexagram**\n*One-Four-Four*\nJackals and tigers roar,\nEndless rains flood the land.\nBattles yield no victory,\nWeak troops and valiant warriors alike.\nOverwhelmed by raiders,\nMany perish or flee.\n\nYan says: To weaken one and strengthen another—both defy principle.

Mid-journey, terror strikes; punitive expeditions are ill-advised.\n\nHe also says: Yin’s influence grows ever stronger, while the lord’s Way daily wanes. Jackals and tigers, external raiders, connect on all sides—enemies cannot be overcome.\n\nHe says: Regional lords guard the borders, yet officials fall prey to bandits. Even atop high ridges, they suffer deluges. The sick grow gravely ill; prisoners remain firmly bound; lawsuits stall. Cycles repeat endlessly. Trade, fields, silkworms, and seeking office—all prove unfavorable.\n\nExplanation: Jackals roar and waters overflow—yang’s path stands alone. Great villains conspire together, their peril beyond rescue. In this divination, a single yang perches atop accumulated yin, hence the images of roaring jackals and ceaseless rain.

      "translated_text": "The Great Unity deploys troops, the Jade Maiden stands beside. The shaman becomes an immortal master, dispelling misfortune.\n\nYan says: The household’s elder will fall ill, for a female ghost brings harm—best to perform exorcism. Most affairs remain obscure; even the traveler cannot return for this reason.\n\nIt is also said: The celestial deity, the Venerable Great Unity, has the Jade Maiden as his aide, while Wu Xian was a worthy minister of Yin. These are but auspicious titles. This hexagram brings fortune through prayers and exorcisms. If the sick are afflicted by spirits, hasten to dispel them. Seeking office, pursuing matters, trade, and marriage—all prove favorable.\n\nHe says: The traveler arrives soon; no harm comes from slander. Legal troubles end without worry, and one gains human aid. Best to seek blessings and avert calamity—what is undertaken will succeed.\n\nExplanation: The Great Unity deploys troops to dispel misfortune. Yang, though solitary amid yin, does not long abide with evil. Here, though yin resides above, two yang lines find fellowship, forming a united resolve to expel wickedness. The upper yin, in turn, serves our purpose—hence the omen of the Great Unity leading troops. The Jade Maiden at his side mirrors the radiant aid of Wu Xian. Though affairs may seem doubtful, one ultimately gains friends’ assistance to succeed. The sick recover through exorcism; the traveler returns; battles end in great victory.\n\n**Decaying Hexagram of the Seduced General**\n*Two-One-Two*\nTwo women, one man—above and below drive each other. Yin’s qi seizes yang, leading to depletion and emptiness.\n\nYan says: Man and woman clash; marriage begins but later dissolves. Though the traveler returns, bandits await on the road.\n\nIt is also said: The outer is no Jade Maiden, the inner betrays the Great Unity. One yang, subdued by two yin, forms a hexagram of depletion. The sick grow worse.\n\nHe says: What is sought brings no benefit; what is done fails to harmonize. The traveler does not arrive; silkworms and fields yield no hope. Legal troubles prove hard to resolve; the sick worsen. All affairs turn greatly inauspicious.\n\nExplanation: Two women, one man—yang is trapped by yin. It resists essence yet surrenders to seduction, leading to depletion and ruin. Here, one yang is ensnared between two yin. Both yin and yang are weak; the lesser seeks union, but yang cannot rise, overpowered by yin, hastening depletion. All matters divined under this sign prove ill-fated.\n\n**Rectifying Hexagram of Disciplined Order**\n*Two-Zero-Three*\nHeaven darkens, clouds ascend; yang stirs from below. The noble governs chaos; the petty fear punishment.\n\nYan says: Yin usurps yang’s place, rising like clouds. Mighty yang lies below, poised to ascend to the ninth five. It quells rebellion and restrains violence—all evil dissipates. Minor punishments serve as great warnings. This hexagram excels in governance; all affairs begin with worry but end in joy.\n\nHe says: What is sought is not obtained; what is done does not succeed. Upholding justice to quell chaos, the petty fear guilt. The sick do not recover; the traveler returns but gains no profit, only slander.\n\nExplanation: Heaven darkens, clouds ascend—like a dragon leaping from the abyss. Using rectitude to expel evil is like water flowing in order. Here, though yin and yang are misplaced, one yang stands at the center, three yang below, forming the image of the noble governing chaos and the firm overcoming the yielding. Divined for governance, civil rule, pursuing fugitives, or quelling rebellion—all prove auspicious. Lawsuits end in righteous victory; secrecy brings no good. For the noble, this is greatly fortunate; for the petty, the opposite holds.\n\n**Unreturned Hexagram of Exile**\n*Two-Zero-Four*\nFields lie barren, earth grows hollow; the people relocate. Awaiting a bountiful year, they return to their homes.\n\nYan says: This hexagram marks yin’s extreme rise, which yang cannot restrain. Fields lie waste, people scatter—only in a year of plenty do they return. The sick recover slowly; silkworms and fields prove unfavorable.\n\nHe says: Officials lose emoluments; travelers do not return. Silkworms and fields lose their capital. Though this hexagram is not auspicious, it cannot harm. Best to endure poverty and remain tranquil—seeking blessings brings good fortune.\n\nExplanation: Fields lie barren, earth grows hollow—nothing to rely upon. The petty harbor divergent desires, never uniting. Upholding rectitude and awaiting the moment, one surely attains their place. Here, yang is trapped by yin, while the lower position teems with yin—hence the image of barren fields, hollow earth, and fleeing people. Yet the lower yin, being mature, does not seek union. The petty, having their way, reach their limit and decline, while the lesser yin above instead aligns with us—thus, one ultimately returns to the old home. All affairs meet obstruction; remaining tranquil and awaiting the right time brings good fortune.\n\n**Cautionary Hexagram of Hoarded Wealth**\n*Two-Two-One*\nBurying gold and hiding jade, one boasts of supreme nobility. Ghostly debts remain unpaid; the spirits withhold blessings.\n\nYan says: Yang is deemed noble, hence \"gold and jade.\" Boasting of supreme nobility, the spirits do not protect. The sick are haunted by ghosts—best to hasten exorcism. Legal troubles require human aid to resolve.\n\nHe says: Hoarding wealth invites calamity. Though treasures exist, one must fear bandits. The sick do not recover; travelers do not return. Prisoners remain confined; silkworms and fields yield no harvest. Deploying troops brings no advantage—one is seized by ghosts. This is ill-fated.\n\nExplanation: Burying gold and hiding treasure—yang lies below. The ghostly path ascends; blessings cannot be borrowed. Here, a solitary yang is suppressed beneath two yang, unable to act. Two yin above, weak and yielding, take this as their treasure—thus, no blessings come, only worries. The diviner must expect ruin from greed.\n\n**Peaceful Hexagram of the Adorned Garden**\n*Two-Two-Two*\nThe year is abundant, the month prosperous; fields and lands expand. Steadfast as Mount Tai, no misfortune befalls in the end.\n\nYan says: Broadly open the fields, awaiting the year’s end. Divide heaven and earth—no calamity or fault arises. Unshaken, steadfast as Mount Tai. At home, all is auspicious; silkworms and fields yield great harvests. The sick suffer no pain; the traveler has not returned.\n\nHe says: Holding office, one enjoys emoluments; wealth and silk come of their own accord. Troops prevail in battle; the pregnant bear sons. Those with learning—this hexagram is greatly auspicious.",
      "overlap_context": "avorable.\n\nExplanation: Jackals roar and waters overflow—yang’s path stands alone. Great villains conspire together, their peril beyond rescue. In this divination, a single yang perches atop accumulated yin, hence the images of roaring jackals and ceaseless rain. All affairs turn inauspicious; deploying troops is most ill-omened. Only in times of great drought will prayers for rain succeed.\n\n**Three Images, Upper Sixteen Hexagrams.**\n**Divine Aid: The Spirit’s Protection Hexagram**\n*Two-One-One*",

      "translated_text": "**Explication:**\n\"Abundant year, prosperous month\"—all share the same aspiration. Gentle and yielding, favorable and upright, blessings know no end. \"Steadfast as Mount Tai\"—beginning and end are as one. This divination’s three positions are all yin, yet attain central correctness, bearing the image of dwelling in peace, abiding in compliance, and harboring no external desires. Thus, fortune prevails, misfortune vanishes. For inquiries into household affairs, fields and silkworms, official posts, or market trade—all are greatly auspicious. In campaigns, land is gained; the sick recover without treatment; lawsuits incur no blame; the traveler has not yet returned.\n\n**Heavenly Emolument Divination: Hexagram of Rising Fortune**\n*Two-Two-Three*\nReceiving Heaven’s emolument, ascending like the sun. From youth in office, rank and stipend flourish.\n\nYan says: Auspicious for seeking wealth at home; the traveler has not returned. The sick should perform exorcisms; offer sacrifices to seek blessings. It is also said: Heavy yin stirs into motion, ascending like the sun—this approaches pure auspiciousness. Not suitable for reclusion or rebellion. In market trade or hiring servants, desires are difficult to fulfill; the rest is auspicious.\n\nHe says: Endeavors are lofty and distant, all coming to fruition. The sick suffer no pain; military campaigns are fortunate. Favorable for praying to the stars; all plans succeed. No matter should be kept secret.\n\n**Explication:**\nYang flourishes below, strength following softness. Cultivating virtue and refining conduct, one receives Heaven’s favor. In this divination, two yin reside above while vigorous yang lies below, advancing upward—an image of the sun’s ascent. For seeking office or advancement, it is greatly auspicious. This divination is purely fortunate, except for reclusion, exile, market trade, or servants.\n\n**Abundant Wealth Divination: Hexagram of Unimpeded Prosperity**\n*Two-Two-Four*\nWealth like a wellspring, though used, never exhausted. All sought is attained; joy knows no end.\n\nYan says: All matters are auspicious; at home, there are celebrations. The traveler returns soon; wealth flows like a wellspring, inexhaustible in use. All desires are fulfilled, bringing unparalleled joy.\n\nHe says: Officials attain high promotion; livelihoods grow rich and ample. Fields and silkworms yield double harvests; good fortune and joy abound. The sick recover; prisoners are released—this hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n**Explication:**\n\"Wealth like a wellspring\"—one gains the advantage of the land. Softness and compliance move above and below; nothing sought goes unfulfilled. In this divination, the lower position is rich in yin, not clashing with the upper, thus forming the image of fertile land. The two yin, gentle and compliant above, do not act recklessly but enjoy peace—hence their prosperity is unceasing. All inquiries into matters are auspicious.\n\n**Later Fortune Divination: Hexagram of Sorrow and Joy**\n*Two-Three-One*\nThe heart bears sorrow, restless and sleepless. Fearing calamity, fortune arrives instead. Celebration and joy bring great benefit.\n\nYan says: Initially there is sorrow, but in the end, joy. It is also said: Yin occupies Heaven’s position, where it does not belong. Thus, though there is sorrow, the three yang unite to resist, unable to cause harm. This hexagram brings minor sorrow first, then great fortune—hence no blame.\n\nHe says: Gossip comes to nothing; the traveler is on the way. In marriage or trade, difficulty precedes ease. The sick first suffer, then recover; legal matters turn from ill to good; lost items are hard to retrieve.\n\n**Explication:**\nYin overpowers yang—its position is not esteemed. Anxiety subsides, and fortune is gained through firmness in the center. In this divination, yin occupies the upper position while yang resides below—an image of misplaced position. Yet one yang lies below, vigorous and centrally situated, while weak yin cannot restrain strength. Initially, there is doubt, but in the end, good fortune prevails. All matters begin with sorrow but conclude with joy—sorrow is empty, fortune is real.\n\n**Peaceful Divination: Hexagram of Latent Flow**\n*Two-Three-Two*\nAbove and below are at peace; the heart harbors no deceit. Upright and free from worry, do not heed rumors.\n\nYan says: A righteous heart brings good fortune; do not believe rumors. The traveler arrives; prisoners are released. Though this hexagram has yin above and below, three yang reside in the center. Initially, there is worry, but each abides in its place—no regrets remain. All matters proceed naturally; sorrow precedes joy. Serving rulers and forming alliances is especially good.\n\nHe says: Marrying brings a fine wife; the traveler is on the way. The pregnant bear sons; the sick encounter strange omens but suffer no harm. Legal matters dissipate; fields and silkworms prosper. In campaigns, trade, and all matters—greatly auspicious.\n\n**Explication:**\nAbove and below are both soft, relying on the central ruler. Upright and unyielding, they gain the people’s support. In this divination, three yang occupy the center while above and below are yin. Lesser yin is not yet dominant, avoiding conflict and fostering harmony. Yang’s vigor and yin’s abundance cannot prevail—thus the image of universal peace, with omens but no misfortune.\n\n**Averting Evil Divination: Hexagram of Flourishing Virtue**\n*Two-Three-Three*\nThe multitude loves me, warding off calamity. Fierce dogs do not bite; ten thousand things come to fruition.\n\nYan says: All matters are auspicious, gaining others’ assistance. The traveler returns; wealth is acquired; at home, all is fortunate. It is also said: Though yin resides above, it is not in its rightful place. Yet yang’s vigor prevails, able to dispel misfortune—all love it. In the three preceding hexagrams, yin usurps yang’s position, but virtue is not lacking. Cultivating it brings good fortune; sorrows cause no suffering.\n\nHe says: High ministers and regional lords gain worthy aides. Marrying secures a virtuous wife. The sick recover; prisoners are released; others lend assistance. In war, victory is won; the pregnant bear sons; trade is profitable.\n\n**Explication:**\nModesty and brilliance reside above—all find them lovable. Worthy aides assist in succession, ensuring no harm.",

      "translated_text": "Here the yin resides in the upper position yet does not wield its power. The host of yang below remains steadfast and upright, free from perversity. Though fierce dogs do not bite, they instead serve to ward off misfortune for me. In divination, one gains the support of many, ensuring success through their aid.\n\n**Hexagram of Great Capture, Governing Things** (2-3-4)\nThe Han Lu hound pursues the hare—its steps cannot stretch forth. The biting dog lies ahead; the pursuer follows behind. Layer upon layer, they press so closely that escape is impossible.\n\nYan says: At home, all is auspicious; the traveler returns, arriving both before and after. It is also said: The three yang reside in the center, able to restrain the multitude of lesser forces. The fierce dog’s pursuit of the hare leaves no room for flight—speaking of success in the turn of a heel. In all matters, what begins small will grow great. This hexagram favors the capture of fugitives, the pursuit of wealth (which will be abundant), and divination concerning property. For illness, it bodes ill.\n\nHe says: Officials and those in sericulture all find their pursuits favorable; travelers meet with good fortune. The sick grow distressed; prisoners remain confined; legal matters prove difficult to resolve; military campaigns return empty-handed. It is also said: Though this path is arduous, why sigh over toil and labor? Cast your line into the deep pool, and you shall surely land a great turtle.\n\n**Explication:**\nThe three yang occupy the center—vigorous Dao prevails. Though the petty man is yielding, he cannot contend. Even if he seeks to leap and surge, in the end, he submits to fate. In this divination, though the three yang are situated amid two yin, with lesser yin above and elder yin below, the desires of old and young differ. They are constrained by the firm and cannot act. Thus, it takes the form of the Han Lu hound pursuing the hare. For the diviner, it is highly auspicious for capturing fugitives, suppressing rebels, seeking wealth, pursuing profit, and marriage. Travel will meet with obstacles; prisoners will find it hard to escape; the sick will be in grave danger; at home, there is no misfortune. Most matters will come to fruition, but attempts at resolution will fail.\n\n**Hexagram of Decline and Revival** (2-4-1)\nThe sagely and the worthy succeed one another; the faint revives and flourishes anew. Like the melon vine stretching endlessly, it gradually ascends.\n\nYan says: Affairs that were askew now reunite; seekers obtain what is hidden; all things follow the heart’s desire. It is also said: Though yang is faint and weak, its aspiration lies in uprightness. Rising from below to above, it resembles the melon vine’s tendrils, extending ceaselessly upward. With a sincere heart in one’s endeavors, one revives what is fading and restores what is broken. This hexagram favors official promotion, the bestowal of grace and fortune, and the seeking of heirs.\n\nHe says: Studies come to fruition; the traveler arrives soon. Sericulture yields great harvests; trade is profitable; the wife one marries is virtuous and fair; officials ascend in rank; all desires are fulfilled. The sick grow distressed—praying to the spirits will bring good fortune. Lost items will not be recovered.\n\n**Explication:**\nYin flourishes in the center, but when it reaches its extreme, it must decline. Like the melon vine stretching endlessly, yang returns. Gradually ascending, the upright Dao is restored. In this divination, lesser yang resides beneath the host of yin, perilously isolated. Yet lesser yin lies above, with elder yin in the center—they lack the will to unite. The petty man, though at his peak, is doomed to discord, while lesser yang rises from below. As they wane, it advances, like the melon vine’s ceaseless ascent—a sign of revival after decline and the restoration of order. All matters bode well.\n\n**Hexagram of Avoiding Disaster** (2-4-2)\nSummer departs, autumn arrives; frost brings calamity. Birds and beasts grow thick fur; grasses and trees shed their leaves.\n\nYan says: In all matters, spring’s beginning follows the heart’s desire; at home, all is auspicious; the traveler has not yet returned. It is also said: Summer emerges, autumn retreats—yang scatters as yin reaches its peak. Thus, birds and beasts shed their fur, grasses and trees fade in color. The noble man, in a time of obscurity and stillness, cannot advance with the affairs of the age. This divination leans toward misfortune.\n\nHe says: Officials face unjust accusations; prisoners and rebels harm one another. The sick grow distressed; military campaigns meet with misfortune; legal matters are hard to resolve; travelers do not return; livelihoods are lost; there is gossip, theft, and banditry.\n\n**Explication:**\nSummer departs, autumn arrives—yin qi flourishes. Grasses and trees wither and yellow; stillness preserves uprightness. In this divination, the host of yin holds sway, with elder yin in the center—a time when the noble man’s Dao is obstructed. The diviner should withdraw, remain still, and guard their integrity; seeking advancement will not bring good fortune. All matters will fail to achieve their aims; the sick will face great distress.\n\n**Hexagram of Enlightening the Obscure** (2-4-3)\nYin at its extreme transforms into yang; hibernating creatures stir and emerge. The imperial pardon is proclaimed; the bells and drums resound grandly.\n\nYan says: Through yin, yang is aroused; reverently employing the multitude of creatures is like striking bells and drums to grant broad amnesty, opening the gates of the dark prison. This is the hexagram governed by the celestial immortals. It is highly auspicious for official advancement but ill-suited for marriage, for yin and yang injure one another and lack harmony.\n\nSunzi says: Do not intercept a formation with banners arrayed in perfect order; do not strike a battle line drawn up in full strength.\n\nHe says: Imperial grace descends; prisoners are released; officials attain high rank; livelihoods multiply tenfold.\n\n**Explication:**\nYin at its extreme transforms into yang—thunder arises from within the earth. The bells and drums resound grandly—the voice of virtue spreads far. In this divination, the three yang succeed the yin at its peak, like the thunderclap that awakens hibernating creatures—a time when the noble man’s Dao flourishes. All matters bode well; when deploying troops, it is fitting to display civil virtue.\n\n**Hexagram of Hidden Illness** (2-4-4)\nYin’s excess brings minor illness; one lies prostrate, filled with sorrow. Gazing upward at the heavens, then bowing low in submission.\n\nYan says: One’s desires are unfulfilled; the traveler faces misfortune. It is also said: Yin’s harm arises subtly, not yet reaching its extreme—hence, it is called minor illness. Yet lying prostrate and gazing at the heavens, one sees no savior; thus, one bows low in submission, consumed by worry. This hexagram bodes ill for all matters; only secrecy is advisable.\n\nHe says: The sick cannot be saved; prisoners’ sentences are sealed; reasoning proves difficult; travelers encounter misfortune—this hexagram is inauspicious.\n\n**Explication:**\nYin’s dominance spreads insidiously—distress and hardship follow. Bowing low and gazing at the heavens, sorrow reaches its extreme.",
      "overlap_context": "receding hexagrams, yin usurps yang’s position, but virtue is not lacking. Cultivating it brings good fortune; sorrows cause no suffering.\n\nHe says: High ministers and regional lords gain worthy aides. Marrying secures a virtuous wife. The sick recover; prisoners are released; others lend assistance. In war, victory is won; the pregnant bear sons; trade is profitable.\n\n**Explication:**\nModesty and brilliance reside above—all find them lovable. Worthy aides assist in succession, ensuring no harm.",

Be vigilant and cautious; do not grow lax or negligent.\nFor the sick, swift recovery. The traveler, though returned, gains something along the way.\n\nIt is also said: Dispelling accumulated yin, one governs the host of yang, doubling brightness and radiance.\nBeholding the beauty of the state, one speaks of position—all affairs are in great harmony.\nOther external matters may also be pursued in season: marriage and official pursuits are especially auspicious.\n\nHe says: For all one seeks, choose an auspicious time.\nFor the sick, offer prayers and supplications for blessings. The traveler will arrive at once.\nFor the imprisoned, seek those who enforce the law—they will surely secure pardon.\n\n*Explanation*: The brilliance of yang is upright and direct; the path of office is greatly flourishing.\nThe noble person’s time for service is to act in due season. In this divination, the three yang lines occupy their rightful positions, while the middle and lower lines are yang in ascent.\nThe Dao of yang is unimpeded; yin’s perversity is cast aside. For those in office or pursuing the Way, this is the moment to act.\nAll matters are highly auspicious—advance without missing the opportunity. Every affair is favorable, save those of secret yin.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Heaven’s Blessing: The Path (312)**\n*Ascend high and gaze afar—above, one sees the celestial thoroughfare.*\nThe Jade Maiden, most sagely, bestows upon me a divine talisman.\nEternal bestowal of agelessness, to preserve my body.\n\nYan says: This is the image of receiving things, matters arising from a woman.\nAt home, all is auspicious. The traveler has not yet returned but will surely obtain rare treasures. The sick will recover of themselves.\n\nIt is also said: Heaven and Earth’s positions are now correct; Heaven and humanity unite in virtue. It is like ascending high to observe the six directions, yet below, one responds to yin.\nWhen one finds their match, the divine talisman may be sought and seen.\nA century of venerable age may be attained in tranquility.\nThis hexagram is an omen for the noble: yin and yang are in their rightful places, without mutual harm. All affairs are auspicious.\n\nHe says: For those at home, fortune. Marriage brings beauty.\nThe traveler’s road is unimpeded; the sick will recover at once. In official matters, seeking high ministers brings good fortune.\nSilkworms and wheat flourish; the pregnant will bear sons. Merchants profit; the traveler returns. This hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n*Explanation*: Ascending high to gaze afar is to occupy the superior position.\nThe Jade Maiden bestows the talisman—yin’s mutual response.\nCentered and correct, one receives Heaven’s blessing.\nHere, a single yang resides in the middle, above supporting the firm and luminous ruler, below responding to the young yin’s match—its fortune is unparalleled.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Nobility: Encountering the Auspicious (313)**\n*Virtue shines brilliantly; ten thousand years without end.*\nThe Seven Stars of the Northern Dipper guard and defend me.\nAttaining promotion and emolument, generation after generation brings prosperity.\n\nYan says: Above and below are both yang; within and without, all is illuminated.\nThis is no hexagram for the common folk—it is the sign of the honored and wise.\nEven those who would meet the lord may draw a comparison.\n\nIt is also said: All one seeks will be obtained; the traveler returns.\n\nHe says: Officials will be promoted; scholarship will bear fruit. Leading troops, one gains advantage; the army suffers no harm.\nFor the sick, pray to the celestial spirits. Marriage is fitting; merchants profit. The traveler returns; silkworms and wheat thrive. Official matters disperse. This hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n*Explanation*: Virtue shines brilliantly—the Dao of yang is manifest.\nThe Northern Dipper guards and defends—yin’s treachery is dispelled.\nIn seeking office or planning affairs, one gains the power of the noble.\nFor grave sites or dwellings, this is an auspicious location.\nFor those at home, movement; for travelers, companionship.

At first, matters do not proceed as desired, but later, all conforms to the heart.\nThe traveler will arrive; there will first be tidings. At home, all is auspicious.\n\nIt is also said: Through accumulated yin encroaching upon extreme yang, one remains still while witnessing anomalies.\nThe so-called shaman responds to the superior position—prayer is fitting.\nBy harmonizing and dispelling misfortune, is this not the protective power of the gods?\nAll affairs are slightly auspicious.\n\nHe says: Fear calamity and misfortune—perform good deeds to avert them.\nThere may be quarrels, disputes, lawsuits, or hardships; evil dreams or strange anomalies. Former misfortune, later fortune; beginning difficult, end easy. Fortune and misfortune are evenly matched—only vigilance and exorcism are fitting.\nFor the sick, sacrifices to the celestial spirits bring good fortune. Marriage will be promptly settled, for within and without, there is response.\n\n*Explanation*: Witnessing anomalies gives rise to doubt.\nThe household harbors an old ghost, whose power cannot be overcome.\nAppeal to the divine—security is preserved without loss.\nHere, accumulated yin resides within, while the superior position is replete with yang. Thus, the middle position speaks of the diviner obtaining it.\nThe household will encounter strange events—exorcism brings good fortune. For illness or lawsuits, prayer and exorcism are fitting. Seeking others, one gains their power. In all matters, initial worry yields to later fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Bestowing Goods: Initial Auspiciousness (321)**\n*A guest arrives from the south, leaving me fine wealth.*\nPrecious goods and rare treasures: a golden platter, a jade cup.\n\nYan says: Someone will send things; at home, all is auspicious. The traveler returns, obtaining treasures and wealth.\n\nIt is also said: Yin occupies the center, responding to external yang—friends arrive from afar, is this not fitting?\nThe south is the position of yang, hence \"from the south.\"\nPrecious goods and rare treasures are the resources of the noble; the golden platter and jade cup, the vessels of a fine feast.\n\nHe says: Marriage is auspicious; all one seeks will be obtained.

      "translated_text": "Here the divination shows Lesser Yin dwelling at the center, with one yang aligned below, while abundant yang holds its proper place above. Yin, through its yielding compliance, responds to external yang—thus obtaining precious goods. The \"south\" refers to the upper three lines forming *Li*, the southern direction. The \"golden bowl and jade cup\" arise from the lower single line as *Qian*, for *Qian* represents gold and jade, and the round vessel—hence the image of a golden bowl and jade cup. The first line corresponds to the upper and aligns with the center; the center is even, signifying a guest’s gift. For the querent, all matters are greatly auspicious, with seeking wealth and marriage most favorable.\n\n**Peaceful Land Hexagram** (3-2-2)\nThe land is at peace, without hardship or difficulty.\nSow and cultivate as you wish; journeys and returns are favorable.\n\nYan says: The lower position does not encroach upon the upper, hence \"the land is at peace.\" Planting is timely, trade is profitable, official ranks advance, illness poses no threat, travelers are safe and will soon arrive, marriages are harmonious, and dwellings are auspicious.\nHe says: Seekers attain their desires, the sick recover lightly, official matters bring no worry, and all affairs are tranquil—this is a hexagram of great fortune.\n\n*Explanation*: \"The land is at peace\" because the yielding dwells in lowliness. \"Without hardship or difficulty\" comes from an untroubled heart. With no deceit between above and below, what could go amiss? Here, firm yang resides above while the middle and lower positions harmonize in compliance—thus the land is at peace and free from difficulty, so movement and stillness, advance and retreat encounter no obstruction. All matters are auspicious.\n\n**Reverent Harmony Hexagram** (3-2-3)\nAbove, one stands upright; below, people fulfill their duties.\nHouseholds live in harmony, young and old unite in effort.\nWith unopposed resolve, all one seeks is obtained.\n\nYan says: Yin occupies the central position, embodying the Way of compliance—hence \"below, people fulfill their duties.\" This hexagram unites the strength of all below, so all requests are fulfilled.\nHe says: Marriages are auspicious, husbands and wives harmonious, dwellings secure, travelers return, business and sericulture prosper, sons are born, and all matters are greatly fortunate.\n\n*Explanation*: Yang’s firmness above is fitting and proper. With vigor and compliance mutually supporting, those below fulfill their duties. Households live in harmony, and nothing sought is denied. This hexagram brings good fortune in office, at home, on journeys, in work, marriage, and trade—nothing is not favorable, making it a greatly auspicious sign for all plans.\n\n**Defiance Hexagram** (3-2-4)\nBelow does not follow above; the center cannot restrain the outer.\nAbove and below clash in defiance, discipline and order collapse in ruin.\n\nYan says: The Yin path steadily grows, while yang cannot contain it—such discord leads to chaos, hence \"ruin.\" The sick grow worse, and medicine proves ineffective. Armies suffer defeat, and travelers do not return. This hexagram bodes ill for all matters.\nHe says: Nothing sought is obtained, nothing undertaken succeeds. One will see households scatter, property lost, armies defeated, distant journeys plagued by disaster, the sick distressed, official matters entangled, legal troubles unavoidable, and all exits leading to death’s gate—nothing is auspicious. Do not act or change course; only with the new year will fortune return. If obtained in the first month, it is inauspicious.\n\n*Explanation*: \"Below does not follow above\" because yin prevails. \"Above and below clash in defiance\" through mutual aggression. \"Discipline and order collapse in ruin\"—they cannot prevail in the end. Here, above and below clash while yielding yin occupies the center, unable to govern the petty yet also unable to rightly follow above—this inevitably leads to ruin. All matters are inauspicious for the querent.\n\n**Hidden Virtue Hexagram** (3-3-1)\nThe Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang,\nCultivating nature and walking the Dao.\nInhaling and exhaling primordial qi,\nOne may attain agelessness.\n\nYan says: Though this hexagram is pure yang, the lower position governs, approaching the image of a noble retreat—thus one may nurture its purity. All matters are secure and auspicious, except marriage, which is unfavorable due to its pure yang nature.\nHe says: Officials ascend to high rank, sericulture and farming should begin early, travelers return at once, official matters disperse immediately, the sick recover on their own, and trade, home life, and all affairs prosper—this is an omen of great fortune.\n\n*Explanation*: The Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang illuminate while dwelling in seclusion. Inhaling and exhaling primordial qi allows for leisurely ease. Here, double yang occupies the upper two positions, a time of brilliance under heaven. Yet with one yang below, only the Four Hoary Ones of Mount Shang can match this. For the querent, it is fitting to dwell in peace and uphold integrity, enjoying the blessings of health and tranquility—do not seek advancement from others.\n\n**Growing Firmness Hexagram** (2-1-3)\nTwo people share one heart,\nBoth as inner and outer.\nDwelling together in one state,\nThey rely on each other like lips and teeth.\n\nYan says: Gain comes from others, loss from oneself. Also: Three yangs reside above yin—hence \"two people share one heart.\" Home life and all other matters are auspicious. Officials fare even better, marriages bear minor flaws, the sick recover slowly, and those seeking counsel find success. Travelers have not returned but will surely receive news.\nHe says: Rulers and ministers observe propriety, friends share one heart. Trade is profitable, sons are born, silkworms and wheat bring minor fortune. Official matters find aid, the sick suffer no harm, and medical treatment is advisable. This hexagram brings no calamity—greatly auspicious.",
      "overlap_context": "he south is the position of yang, hence \"from the south.\"\nPrecious goods and rare treasures are the resources of the noble; the golden platter and jade cup, the vessels of a fine feast.\n\nHe says: Marriage is auspicious; all one seeks will be obtained. The sick will recover; merchants profit. Official matters disperse; the traveler returns. This hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n*Explanation*: A guest arrives from the south—firm and yielding respond.\nThe golden bowl and jade cup express reverence.",

      "translated_text": "**Explanation says:**\n\"Two people share one heart\" signifies doubled firmness. The yielding and compliant reside below, unharmed. Withdrawing to rely on each other like lips and teeth, they form a steadfast barrier. In this configuration, one yin dwells beneath doubled yang—yielding yet without conflict. Two yangs above act in unison, serving as inner and outer, embodying the image of dwelling together in one state. Like lips and teeth, they depend on each other and cannot be separated. For matters concerning rulers and ministers, brothers, husbands and wives, or friends, all are auspicious. One must not harbor groundless suspicions. In household affairs and commerce, great joy prevails. Do not heed slanderous words. Planting yields abundance, and silkworms and wheat bring harvest. Pregnant women will bear sons, official matters find resolution with aid, and the sick should seek medical treatment and perform blessings for protection. Marriages are harmonious, matching fine partners. For travelers, though they have not returned, news will surely arrive. This hexagram, when consulted for affairs, trade, or household matters, is an omen of great fortune. One version states: If one seeks elsewhere, it will not be favorable.\n\n**Hexagram of Strong and Prosperous Forces (3-3-3)**\nA multitude thrives and regains strength,\nAlready wealthy and flourishing.\nFavorable for establishing merit,\nNone can resist or oppose.\n\nYan says: In this hexagram, each of the three positions holds three yangs—truly at the height of prosperity. Thus, in establishing merit and undertaking affairs, none can obstruct. In all matters, one should follow the straight path without partiality, never straying into crookedness—only then will it be auspicious.\nHe says: This hexagram is in its prime. Pregnant women will bear sons, travelers will return at once, business ventures are profitable, fields and silkworms yield double, hunting and fishing bring gains, relocation is auspicious, those raising armies will triumph, and those guarding borders will find peace. Homes are fortunate, illnesses recover, official matters disperse, trade is profitable—this hexagram is greatly auspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThree yangs share the same virtue, thriving and regaining strength. In establishing merit and undertaking affairs, they act with bold resolve. This configuration, with all three positions as yang, is firm, vigorous, and grand, reaching the height of wealth and prosperity. Thus, it is favorable for establishing merit and undertaking affairs. For those who obtain this hexagram, it is greatly auspicious to take action, especially in military matters. However, for illness, it is severe, and for marriage, it is unfavorable—due to its pure yang nature.\n\n**Hexagram of Noble Beauty (3-3-4)**\nGreen windows and purple chambers,\nWithin dwell ladies of grace.\nWith radiant countenances and fragrant hues,\nOrchids and irises bloom.\n\nYan says: The yin position flourishes, and matters arise from women. The sick recover on their own, and all sought-after goals are attained. Also: Pure yin resides below, corresponding above to heaven and humanity. Their essence and qi are fresh and fragrant, like orchids. Travelers return at once, marriages are most favorable, the sick find peace, and all affairs are auspicious.\nHe says: This is the hexagram of inner nobility. For marriage, the noble can be obtained, but the humble cannot. As a yin hexagram, it is unfavorable for yang matters. In planning, litigation, or encounters with influential figures, as well as with inner nobility, monks, nuns, or Daoists, it is auspicious. At home or abroad, financial gains and blessings abound, people admire you, and all matters are peaceful.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nDoubled firmness above shines with the Dao of yang. The multitude of yin below submits, resembling ladies of grace. Their descendants will surely flourish. In this configuration, though the multitude of yin is strong, it resides in the lower position, while the Dao of yang shines brightly above. The yielding dare not encroach, thus forming a proper correspondence. In all consulted matters, there is harmony. Travelers return at once, marriages are greatly auspicious, friendships deepen, and illnesses are not fatal.\n\n**Hexagram of Gaining Emolument and Rising Fortune (3-4-1)**\nRuler and minister exchange positions,\nJust as great fortune arises.\nMessengers and letters travel,\nPeople act with self-indulgence.\n\nYan says: Relocation is auspicious, and this direction brings profit. Pursuits will surely meet success. Travelers have not returned, but news arrives first. For the sick, their dwelling must be changed—moving away will avoid harm. Perhaps perform sacrifices, but do not partake; if one does, it will be auspicious. Also: One yang below, with a multitude of yin above—hence \"exchanging positions.\" As merit and enterprise rise, they rely on others to succeed—hence \"messengers and letters travel.\" In this hexagram, matters initially do not harmonize, but later bring great fortune—difficult at first, easy afterward.\nHe says: The lines of those in office undergo change, and affairs are auspicious. Travelers by water and land all return, livelihoods multiply tenfold, pregnant women bear sons, and marriages secure fine partners.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Ruler and minister exchange positions\" signifies yin submitting to yang. \"Messengers and letters travel with self-indulgence\" means losing their proper allegiance. In this configuration, three yangs reside above, while one yang is below—this is called \"ruler and minister exchanging positions.\" Moreover, four yins occupy the middle, overpowering it, while the three above, firm and strong, dwell externally and cannot attend to their ruler. Instead, they ally with the multitude of yin to pursue great fortune. Messengers and letters travel, acting with self-indulgence—this is extremely inauspicious. This hexagram is the exact opposite of the fifteenth hexagram in the \"Three Images, One Above\" section. Comparing and observing them reveals the author’s intent.\n\n**Hexagram of Doubt and Hesitation (3-4-2)**\nIntentions are glimpsed,\nYet fear they cannot be realized.\nAdvancing and retreating in hesitation,\nUncertain of what to do.\n\nYan says: In all matters, if one wavers in advancing or retreating, affairs will not be single-minded. Without single-mindedness, they cannot succeed. Also: Yin resides in the lower position, corresponding above to yang. Desiring action, the multitude of yin internally obstructs—hence the hesitation. Yet if one strives with determination, there will ultimately be gain. In this hexagram, all matters begin without success but end with it.\nHe says: What is sought is not obtained, what is undertaken does not succeed, livelihoods are unprofitable, officials retreat, travelers are confused, official matters are difficult to resolve, the sick face danger—this hexagram is an image of bewilderment.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Intentions are glimpsed\" because the response lies below. \"Fear they cannot be realized\" due to the obstruction of petty people. \"Advancing and retreating in hesitation\" means doubt prevents resolution. In this configuration, yin resides in the lower position, corresponding above to yang, but is separated by the four yins in the middle.",

      "translated_text": "The upper yang seeks to respond to the lower, yet is constrained by yin—thus doubt arises and cannot be resolved, giving birth to worry and misfortune. Divination reveals confusion without success: the sick waver between improvement and decline, and all matters prove unfavorable.\n\n**Evil-Dispelling, Clarity-Shining Hexagram**  ☰☰☷\n*Three-Four-Three*\nThe sun rises in the eastern sky, blazing with radiant brilliance.\nThough malevolent qi lingers, it is scorched and consumed by the flames.\nThe multitude of worthy ones shatters the yin, and calamities dissolve.\n\nYan says: Amidst the prevailing yin, it is called \"malevolent qi.\" The surrounding yang, through its searing heat, purges it.\nAll matters begin in discord but end in fortune.\n\nHe says: Official matters fail, yet one receives assistance. Prisoners free themselves; the sick first suffer but later recover. Travelers return at once; trade and official pursuits, though initially thwarted, ultimately yield great fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Blazing with radiant brilliance\"—both above and below are luminous. When malevolence reaches its extreme, it declines and cannot persist. The multitude of yin is shattered and dispersed, and the human Dao prevails. In this hexagram, two firm yangs assail a dominant yin: though effort is required at first, success is ultimately assured. All divined matters are auspicious; though perilous, there is no blame. However, divining yin matters brings misfortune.\n\n**Upright Yang Hexagram**  ☰☰☷\n*Three-Four-Four*\nAbove stands a worthy ruler; below lurk slanderous ministers.\nSun and moon cast their light, yet dark dust remains unseen.\n\nYan says: The three yangs above form the image of a worthy ruler. Though sun and moon shine brightly, they do not illuminate the dark dust.\n\nFor those in high positions, fortune prevails; slander does not take root. Marriage brings a virtuous wife, and the sick suffer no distress.\n\nHe says: Though the yang above is luminous, the multitude of yin gazes upward in reflection. Though sun and moon shine, dark dust still arises. This hexagram portends frequent regrets. Seeking office is somewhat difficult, but divining marriage is auspicious, for yin and yang respond to each other. The sick waver between improvement and decline, recovering only at the onset of spring. All matters bring minor fortune, flourishing only when spring stirs.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe firm yang occupies its rightful position—above stands a worthy ruler. The accumulated yin below resembles dark dust. Obstruction lingers unresolved, and aspirations cannot be fulfilled. In this hexagram, the firm yang ascends to the celestial position, yet the middle and lower positions are filled with crooked yin, jointly causing obstruction. There is a ruler but no ministers, hence his will cannot be enacted. Divined matters often bring regret; only marriage, through mutual resonance, is auspicious. This hexagram holds equal measure of fortune and misfortune.\n\n**Orphaned-Poverty Hexagram: Encountering Difficulty**  ☷☰☰\n*Four-One-One*\nEmerging from warmth into cold, clad in thin garments.\nDeparting from my loving mother, I suffer this calamity and transgression.\n\nYan says: Two yangs lie below, obscured by the multitude of yin. It is as if one leaves what is beloved and encounters harsh pity.\nIn this hexagram, all matters are inauspicious. Travelers do not arrive; the sick worsen, bearing the image of separation. It is best to maintain the status quo. Obtaining this in the first or second month brings fortune; in other months, misfortune.\n\nHe says: Officials make no progress; livelihoods yield no profit. Dwelling in solitude and poverty, one endures hardship to the end. Prisoners struggle to be freed; the sick do not recover. Nothing aligns with one’s desires. Marriages lack constancy; all matters demand caution. Only with the arrival of the new year does vitality return.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Clad in thin garments\"—lowly and orphaned. The dominant yin above obscures all, leaving none to accompany him. In this hexagram, two yangs reside beneath the dominant yin yet receive no response, like an orphaned child. Moreover, the fourth line, with its crooked yin above, resembles a jealous wife regarding the orphan—his plight is extreme. Divining illness portends danger; travelers face prolonged hardship; officials encounter obstacles; livelihoods falter; military campaigns meet resistance. All matters are inauspicious.\n\n**Hidden Dragon Hexagram: Awaiting the Hour**  ☷☰☷\n*Four-One-Two*\nShun tilled the fields, reaching Mount Li.\nThe soil was fertile, the harvest abundant—ten thousand measures reaped in a year.\n\nYan says: All matters begin in the third or fourth month and conclude in the eighth or ninth month.\nAgain, it is said: The hidden dragon tills the fields, responding to the year’s abundance—who but Yu Shun could achieve this? This hexagram aligns with the first yang line of *Qian*, preserving one’s integrity in reclusion to cultivate the ruler’s virtue within. Whether matters are great or small, acting with benevolence is fitting; seeking through calculation is difficult. The sick will recover only by the end of autumn.\n\nHe says: Suitable for farming and sericulture; what is sought will be obtained. Trade brings profit; households prosper. Travelers return; pregnant women bear sons. Marriages harmonize. This hexagram brings great fortune in all matters.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe accumulated yin above is exhausted, leaving none to accompany him. His virtue flourishes and finds resonance below. When the time arrives, he rises—none can resist. Though this hexagram places a single yang amidst the multitude of yin, the upper yin, having reached its extreme, has exhausted its path. The lesser yin below aligns with me. Though the upper does not regard me, the lower responds—hence the image of Shun plowing Mount Li. Though not loved by his parents, his profound virtue ultimately ascends to renown.\n\n**Beneficial Friend Hexagram: Responsive Divination**  ☷☰☷\n*Four-One-Three*\nA noble scion arrives, knocking at my gate.\nHe speaks of fortune and blessing—going forth, I shall surely receive favor.\n\nYan says: One should go only when summoned. To be called and not go is inauspicious. The words advise going; if a traveler is abroad, calling him will bring his return.\nAgain, it is said: The inner responds to the outer, not remaining within—his aspiration lies in going, for the middle position aids him. When a guest knocks at the gate, who could be nobler than a scion? This hexagram is timely for marriage and all the more favorable for seeking. One version states: Seeking from others brings misfortune.\n\nHe says: Officials gain merit; farming and sericulture are auspicious. The sick recover; legal matters disperse. Travelers return; seekers attain their desires. All matters bring great fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"A noble scion knocks at the gate\"—the response lies without. \"Going forth, I shall surely receive favor\"—the journey brings assistance. In this hexagram, exhausted yin resides above, while flourishing yang lies below. Yin, having reached its extreme, seeks the yang—hence the image of knocking at my gate. The noble scion is a person of high standing. The middle position, a lesser yang, neither competes with me nor aids me, thus going forth brings blessing.",
      "overlap_context": "treat, travelers are confused, official matters are difficult to resolve, the sick face danger—this hexagram is an image of bewilderment.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"Intentions are glimpsed\" because the response lies below. \"Fear they cannot be realized\" due to the obstruction of petty people. \"Advancing and retreating in hesitation\" means doubt prevents resolution. In this configuration, yin resides in the lower position, corresponding above to yang, but is separated by the four yins in the middle.",

      "translated_text": "Divination favors advancement, for one shall receive assistance from a noble person. The sick will encounter skilled physicians; in military affairs, allies will respond. All matters bring good fortune.\n\n**Long Treachery Hexagram (Many Difficulties)**\n*Four-One-Four*\nSeparated and distant, with repeated obstructions.\nAll undertakings prove unfavorable; nothing prospers.\n\nYan says: In all endeavors, the heart’s desires remain unfulfilled, and one encounters only alarm and dread, for a single yang cannot prevail alone. Though it occupies the central position, it suffers repeated harm. Retreating into concealment, survival itself becomes difficult. This hexagram is wholly inauspicious—one must maintain the status quo and avoid new ventures, for all new schemes bring misfortune.\n\nHe says: Travelers by land and water meet with repeated setbacks and ruin. The sick recover with difficulty; prisoners remain confined; merchants gain no profit. This hexagram is greatly inauspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nSeparated and distant, one is beset by isolation. Already solitary and weak, how can anything be accomplished? This hexagram shows a lone yang submerged within accumulated yin, unable to rise—thus nearly all matters bring misfortune.\n\n**Divine Assistance Hexagram (Utmost Adversity Reversed)**\n*Four-Two-One*\nFour ghosts and two shamans bow in supplication.\nHeavenly spirits descend to release the imprisoned.\nAfflictions vanish; blessings from Heaven are attained.\n\nYan says: All entanglements dissolve. Heavy yin prevails in the heavens, and ghostly qi transforms. A single yang stands alone—who but the heavenly spirits could respond thus? All matters begin inauspiciously but conclude favorably.\n\nHe says: Collaborating with others brings good fortune. Marriages harmonize; prisoners are freed; the sick recover; travelers return; pregnancies yield sons; silkworms and wheat yield modest harvests; enmities resolve themselves; seeking office or wealth first brings worry, then good fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFour ghosts and two shamans—yin flourishes and ascends. Heavenly spirits descend with blessings, for adversity has reached its extreme and now gives way to prosperity. In this hexagram, yin prevails, assuming the form of ghosts and spirits. A lesser yin occupies the central position, drawn to its own kind. Though the single yang is weak and cannot rise on its own, the young man and young woman will surely unite if they seek it. Thus, they can entreat the spirits above on my behalf, bringing down blessings and dispelling calamities. What was once a surging yin above is no longer a ghost but a heavenly spirit. This is the image of adversity reaching its limit and the Way of Peace returning. Divination indicates reliance on others will prove effective, with initial hardship followed by joy.\n\n**Expiatory Sacrifice Hexagram (Auspicious for Offerings)**\n*Four-Two-Two*\nTombs and high mounds—ghosts and spirits roam above.\nHasten to perform expiatory rites, and you may avoid misfortune.\n\nYan says: Accumulated yin with no yang forms towering, ghostly mounds—the image of tombs. Ghostly and spiritual forces flourish; only wholehearted sacrifice can avert misfortune.\n\nHe says: If one has vowed offerings to spirits but not fulfilled them, doing so now brings good fortune. Should strange omens appear, it is auspicious to sacrifice to the spirits of hills and mounds. This hexagram is middling—official advancement, seeking wealth, recovery from illness, and legal matters all begin with difficulty but conclude favorably. Travelers abroad face obstruction from a yin person but will return by summer; all else remains peaceful.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nTombs and high mounds—ghostly qi thrives. Perform expiatory rites swiftly to accept fate with reverence. In this hexagram, four yin lines occupy the upper position, while the middle and lower positions hold only lesser yin, with no yang—thus the image of tombs and high mounds. Only through reverence and compliance can one avoid disaster. The diviner should avoid contention; in all matters, adopting a gentle, upright, and honest approach brings good fortune.\n\n**Later Laughter Hexagram (Auspicious for Prayers of Blessing)**\n*Four-Two-Three*\nThe essence of metal stirs, but the primal scholar restrains it.\nPressing down with the left hand, one obtains favor and protection.",

The noble scion is a person of high standing. The middle position, a lesser yang, neither competes with me nor aids me, thus going forth brings blessing.",

      "translated_text": "Yan says: Metal belongs to the west, the position of lesser yin, governing weapons and slaughter. The \"primal scholar\" is a great person. The left is yang, meaning that when yin qi stirs to bring harm, the great person assists. Pressing down with the left hand, the harm is dispelled—yang can restrain yin. In this hexagram, worries do not come to pass, and extreme disorder turns auspicious.\n\nHe says: This hexagram brings initial sorrow followed by joy. In all undertakings, one attains good fortune through the assistance of others. In ventures and aspirations, there is first sorrow, then joy. All matters ultimately gain the aid of a noble person, transforming misfortune into blessing. In affairs, good fortune prevails. Those with powerful officials may avoid calamity, but they must remain cautious and adhere to constancy in all things.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nLesser yin ascends, and the essence of metal stirs. The three yang lines restrain it, causing it to halt on its own. In this hexagram, exhausted yin occupies the upper position, while lesser yin resides in the middle—two forms the image of *dui*, hence the \"essence of metal.\" The three yang below correspond to the upper lines. Lesser yin cannot act, for the left is yang. In all matters, one gains assistance from others, first through caution, then through joy.\n\n**Initial Auspiciousness Hexagram (Auspicious for Prayers of Blessing)**\n*Four-Two-Four*\nIn ancestral temple rites, harm ceases and misfortune halts.\nBlessings fill the gate, while calamities flee ten thousand miles.\n\nYan says: The multitude of yin above forms the image of ancestral temples.

When encountering omens or in all matters, one should perform rites at the ancestral temple to attain good fortune.\n\nHe says: If a daughter is conceived, guard against great fire.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe ancestral temple rites are where the spirits reside.

      "translated_text": "Here is the translation:\n\n---\n\nThis divination shows four yin both above and below: the upper as ancestral temples, the lower as burial mounds.

The omens thus mirror this auspiciousness.\n\n**From the Heart Divination (Treading the Peaceful Hexagram)**\n*Four-Three-One*\nThe dark clouds gather above, while below no slanderers remain.\nAll matters flow smoothly, each returning to its true nature.\n\nYan says: In all matters, follow the heart, and others will assist. He also says: Yin occupies the upper position, revered by the multitude of yang. Misfortune departs, blessings arrive—all through ancestral rites. This hexagram favors grand sacrifices at the ancestral temple, ensuring household peace and ultimate safety from blame.\n\nHe says: A son will be conceived; the traveler returns at once; no bitter disputes arise. The sick should perform rites and seek blessings to recover. Fields and silkworms yield harvests—greatly auspicious. This hexagram is most effective in autumn.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe dark clouds above signify yin ascending. Below, no slanderers remain, for the yang path is unimpeded. This divination shows four yin above, while the two lower positions are yang, forming the image of dark clouds. The third, central, and first positions each occupy their rightful place.

This hexagram is first inauspicious, then auspicious.\n\nHe says: First restraint, then success—all matters follow this pattern. Fields and silkworms prosper; a son is conceived—this is a greatly auspicious hexagram.\n\n**Explanation says:**\n\"My treasured pearl is gone\" signifies yin’s exhaustion above. This divination shows four yin exhausted above, while two yin grow below, forming the image of my pearl stolen and the thief’s hidden lair. Yet three yang reside in the center, aligned with the upper position. The lesser yin is too weak to oppose them and thus cannot cause harm.

      "translated_text": "**Hexagram of All Yang in Ruler-Minister Positions**\n*Three-Three-Zero*\nHere, all yang occupies the positions of ruler and ministers,\nWith no yin or petty men to intervene.\nThis attains the utmost goodness—\nAll affairs are auspicious.\nOne should uphold the old,\nNot seek change.\nOnly in divining marriage is it auspicious;\nFor two marshes, the outcome is unfavorable.\n\n**Hexagram of Certain Gain**\n*Three-Four-Zero*\nThe Han hound pursues the hare,\nThe flying hawk seizes the pheasant.\nNo venture fails to yield,\nAnd what is gained is fully reliable.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThree yang above,\nResonating within and without—\nA hexagram of orderly compliance.\nWith running hounds and flying hawks,\nNo pursuit fails to capture.\nThis hexagram is especially suited for the hunt.\n\n**He says:**\nAll affairs begin without end,\nLegal troubles disperse,\nSilkworms and fields yield great harvest.\nYet he adds:\nThough aspirations start grand,\nThey end with minor loss.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe Han hound pursues the hare—\nYang rides over yin.\nSuch is the capture,\nA great taking of game.\nThis divination is most favorable for\nPursuing fugitives, quelling rebels,\nManaging property, or seeking office.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Avenge Shame**\n*Four-One-Zero*\nA wife brings food to the fields,\nYet no plowing father appears.\nA thieving crow, shameless,\nPecks at my dried meat.\nI draw my bow and shoot,\nStriking its left wing.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYang’s position is solitary and weak,\nObscured by heavy yin—\nAffairs suffer harm,\nThus the crow steals the meat.\nYet yang’s nature,\nFrom weakness to strength,\nWill ultimately prevail,\nAvenge its shame.\n\n**He says:**\nThis stems from disputes with others,\nBreeding private grievances.\nThe hexagram portends worry:\nTravelers meet misfortune,\nSilkworms and fields yield little,\nAll pursuits prove unfavorable,\nMarriages fail,\nLegal matters remain unresolved.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nNo plowing father appears—\nVeiled by obscuring growth.\nSmall strength bears heavy burdens,\nInviting banditry and harm.\nShooting the wing,\nThough victory comes, it is punitive.\nHere, heavy yin rules above,\nA lone yang within—\nYet treachery and theft will ultimately be defeated.\nIn warfare, initial defeat yields later victory.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Inviting Bandits**\n*Four-Two-Zero*\nDrunken quarrels erupt,\nBlades and staves rise together.\nThe host, seized by terror,\nBinds himself to halt the chaos.\n\n**Yan says:**\nDwelling in a position without rank,\nBeneath a throng of yin—\nGuest and host breach propriety,\nDrunken rage sparks strife.\nOnly when the host humbles himself\nDoes the turmoil cease.\nThis hexagram bodes ill,\nGatherings with guests grow dire.\n\n**He says:**\nFirst, verbal strife,\nBut in the end, no worry.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nDrunken quarrels—\nThe peril of petty men.\nThe host binds himself,\nTo evade their edge.\nThis divination is unfit for action;\nSelf-preservation is best.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Knowing When to Stop**\n*Four-Three-Zero*\nAhead, bandits and thieves;\nBehind, travelers approach.\nWhether to advance or halt,\nOne may yet preserve oneself.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThree yang dwell together,\nYet hold no position below.\nA throng of yin above,\nLike bandits lying in wait.\nYet as the three yang begin to flourish,\nCalmly stepping forward,\nThey cannot be harmed.\nThough no great fortune comes,\nOne may yet preserve oneself.\nThis hexagram favors small journeys.\nHe adds:\nThis hexagram lacks a lower position,\nThus no travelers follow behind.\n\n**He says:**\nFirst, verbal strife,\nA desire to return home—\nOne should pause for now,\nTo avoid calamity.\nAll affairs bear minor fault;\nDo not proceed,\nBut defer to what comes later.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nA throng of yin above—\nBandits lie ahead.\nHaving an upper but no lower position—\nNo one follows behind.\nKnowing peril and halting,\nOne may avoid fault.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Urgent Entanglement**\n*Four-Four-Zero*\nSuspended in urgency like a noose,\nNo rescue arrives in time.\nEven the example of Gaozi of Lu\nCannot compare.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYang’s power and virtue both wane,\nA throng of yin grows ever stronger—\nAn omen of ruin and chaos.\nAs when Duke Min of Lu was slain,\nCheng Ji fled to Ju’s neighbor,\nAnd in that winter, Gaozi of Qi came to盟,\nPacifying Lu’s turmoil.\nThis hexagram foretells initial defeat,\nThen later fortune.\nHe adds:\nAll affairs demand haste;\nDelay brings discord.\n\n**He says:**\nAll matters require swift action,\nNot procrastination.\nAs when Duke Min of Lu was slain,\nAnd Duke Xi, son of Jizi, fled to Ju’s neighbor,\nThat winter Gaozi came to盟—\nThe *Zuo Zhuan* notes: \"Gaozi acted in concert,\"\nTo quell Lu’s chaos, hence his name was not recorded.\nAll affairs begin with defeat,\nThen end in fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nSuspended in urgency—\nLike reaching the utmost extremity.\nNo rescue arrives in time—\nCalamity presses close.\nThe absence of a lower position\nForms the image of high suspension.\nHere, a throng of yin ascends,\nInevitably inviting ruin.\nYet one hopes for rescue from others—\nA dire predicament.\nAll divined affairs bear ill omens.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Reverent Caution**\n*Zero-One-One*\nIlluminating virtue, blocking transgression,\nAffairs lie in following the moment’s flow.\nThe worthy are cautious at the outset,\nThe noble guard against the subtle.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThough the upper position is vacant,\nThe hexagram is wholly yang—\nSufficient to illuminate its great virtue,\nAnd block all wrongdoing.\nHe adds:\nAll affairs should move with the season,\nWhile guarding against the subtle.\n\n**He says:**\nAll affairs should follow the moment’s flow,\nThen one’s aspirations may be fulfilled.\nAs Zang Xi Bo said in the *Zuo Zhuan*:\n\"Illuminate virtue, block transgression,\nTo oversee the hundred officials.\"\nThis hexagram is greatly auspicious for approaching office.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nIlluminating virtue, blocking transgression—\nThis lies in following the season.\nCaution from beginning to end\nRequires guarding against the subtle.\nThis divination favors knowing the moment,\nAnd acting with uprightness.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of the Emperor’s Dao**\n*Zero-One-Two*\nHeaven and earth share their work,\nYin and yang commune.\nEndeavors vast and boundless,\nFrom west to east.\nComing and going, moving and dwelling—\nHard to trace their path.\n\n**Yan says:**\nHeaven and earth first commune,\nGrasses and trees just begin—\nNo tracks yet appear.\nRequests meet no response,\nTravelers have not returned.\n\n**He says:**\nAspirations grand yet hard to achieve,\nBeyond measure.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHeaven and earth share their work—\nYin and yang attain harmony.\nEndeavors vast and boundless—\nProgress knows no limit.\nHard to trace their path—\nBeyond reckoning.\nThis divination is greatly auspicious\nFor establishing merit and undertaking great deeds.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram

retreat remain uncertain,\nHard to follow the heart.\nNearly all matters are thus.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nHesitant as a fox,\nNo path to follow.\nAdvance yields no hope—\nThe heart wavers.\nRetreat must follow right—\nLest one fall into misfortune.\nThis hexagram depicts a time without a ruler’s position,\nWhile the host of yang lie below,\nWithout fixed direction—\nHence the fox’s

says:**\nSoft and weak, resting in ease—\nYet in the end, collapse and loss come,\nFor there is no master.\nAlways follow the right Way,\nThen one does not lose their place.\nThis divination shows two

driven away.\n\n**Yan says:**\nIn an age where the high hold no position,\nOnly one who governs with pure firmness\nSees the omen of good fortune.\nMisfortune dissolves, fortune arrives—\nThe phoenix, most sacred of omens.\nThe pearl, a treasure of delight:\nAll that is sought shall be attained.\n\n**He says:**\nFortune and emolument draw near—\nA greatly auspicious and beneficial hexagram.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe phoenix alights in the courtyard—\nThe radiance of worthy virtue.\nFortune arrives, misfortune departs—\nAll good converges.\nIn this divination, nothing is inauspicious,\nSave for seeking rain, which thwarts desire.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Upholding Worthiness in Decline**\n*Zero-Three-Four*\nThe noble stand firm,\nThe petty bow low.\nA luminous lord governs the age,\nDistinguishing purple from crimson.\n\n**Yan says:**\nAbiding in the stability of a weighty position,\nThey emit the illumination of three yang.\nAs the *Book of Changes* says:\n“This is the time when the petty must not be employed.”\nSeeking office brings great fortune;\nAll other matters attain their proper principle.\n\n**He says:**\nA wise ruler presides above,\nThe noble are employed—\nAll wishes follow the heart.\nThe petty submit in lowliness,\nAs reason dictates.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe noble attain their positions—\nThe petty submit.\nDistinguishing crimson from purple,\nEach holds their proper post.\nIn this hexagram, yin and yang each occupy their rightful place:\nFirm brightness shines from above,\nWhile yielding yin follows below.\nIn divination, matters attain their principle;\nBoth noble and petty know good fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of the Ascending Dragon**\n*Zero-Four-One*\nThe hidden dragon prepares to rise,\nDark clouds gather above.\nThe world receives blessings—\nFirst adversity, then joy.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThough the beginning is inauspicious,\nThe end brings great fortune.\nOne yang lies below—\nAs in the *Book of Changes*, the “hidden dragon” of the first nine,\nPoised to ascend as clouds arise.\nWelcoming it, they soar together,\nRiding the empty sky—\nAn omen of harmony between lord and minister across the land.\n\n**He says:**\nThis hexagram begins in adversity but ends in prosperity;\nAll matters bring good fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe hidden dragon meets the clouds—\nAscending to heaven.\nFirst adversity, then joy—\nAdvance without hindrance.\nThis hexagram has no heaven above,\nOnly one yang beneath four yin—\nThus the image of the hidden dragon meeting clouds.\nThough the beginning is fraught with difficulty,\nThe end brings success—\nA greatly auspicious hexagram.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Overturning and Prosperity**\n*Zero-Four-Two*\nThe celestial dragon rages,\nThe thunder lord beats his drum.\nClouds gather, rain descends,\nFloodwaters surge across the earth.\n\n**Yan says:**\nPure yin occupies a time without response,\nUnable to dispel calamity or avert disaster—\nThus the day when thunder and lightning clash,\nAnd floodwaters bring ruin.\nThis hexagram brings regret in all matters:\nTravelers, marriages, and commerce all meet misfortune.\n\n**He says:**\nRain flows, sweeping all clean—\nA hexagram of instability in all matters.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe celestial dragon rages—\nYin rises above.\nFloodwaters surge across the earth—\nNothing can withstand them.\nIn this divination, all undertakings are inauspicious,\nSave for seeking rain.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Withdrawing from the World**\n*Zero-Four-Three*\nThe petty gain power,\nThe noble lose the Way.\nAbandoning my halls and home,\nI enter the deep grasses.\n\n**Yan says:**\nBright yang virtue retreats to a lowly place,\nWhile dark yin usurps the central position—\nAn image of worthy men suppressed and stagnant.\nThus they forsake their halls,\nDwelling far away in the marshes and grasses,\nCultivating their resolve in seclusion,\nAwaiting their time.\nThis hexagram favors retreat, not advance.\n\n**He says:**\nOverpowered by yin,\nThey lose their rightful place.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe petty gain power—\nYin overcomes yang.\nEntering the deep grasses—\nTheir position is improper.\nIn this hexagram, yin and yang are misaligned;\nAll matters favor retreat and shun advance.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Ghostly Activity**\n*Zero-Four-Four*\nTwo ghosts dwell together,\nEver hungry, ever hollow.\nThey wish to enter the gate,\nBut fear this talisman.\n\n**Yan says:**\nAn image of accumulated yin—\nGhosts are about to bring harm.\nWith no master for sacrifices,\nThey are said to be hungry and hollow.\nThe ghosts dare not approach,\nFearing the talisman.\nThis hexagram favors reciting scriptures and mantras\nTo expel malevolent spirits;\nSacrifices bring good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nFortune departs, misfortune arrives—\nOne should cultivate merit and virtue,\nPerform good deeds to dispel evil.\nThe sick should inscribe talismans\nAnd recite the *Ruan* incantation to recover.\nFields and silkworms yield meager harvests—\nA hexagram of constant hardship.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nTwo ghosts dwell together—\nYin’s malevolence accumulates.\nFearing this sacred talisman,\nThey are left with nowhere to go.\nIn this hexagram, two yin lie below,\nWith no position above—\nNo ancestral temple or master for sacrifices,\nThus they are homeless ghosts.\nThough the celestial position is empty,\nLuminous brightness presides above,\nPreventing the ghosts from approaching,\nAs if a talisman barred their entry.\nIn divination, all matters meet great hardship;\nThe sick should be treated with talismans and incantations.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Slight Loss**\n*One-Zero-One*\nClimbing a tree to pluck mulberry leaves,\nI fall to the ground, sprawled and prone.\nThe eastern neighbor has medicine—\nI rush to ask for the prescription.\nThere I meet a skilled physician,\nAnd escape unbroken, unharmed.\n\n**Yan says:**\nSeeking something, one incurs this affliction;\nProceeding further to make amends brings good fortune.\nAlso:\nYin loses its yin position,\nThe yang line has no response.\nLike ascending high only to fall,\nYet with yang present in the center,\nNo yin disaster befalls.\nSeeking a prescription from the eastern neighbor\nAverts injury—\nFor the east is the beginning of yang,\nAnd supplication brings good fortune.\n\n**He says:**\nThe sick should return to where the illness began\nAnd make amends—this brings good fortune.\nTravelers have not returned;\nLegal matters are difficult to resolve.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nClimbing a tree, falling to the ground—\nAscending high brings peril.\nAsking for the prescription, obtaining medicine—\nIn the end, no loss is suffered.\nIn this hexagram, above and below are both yang,\nWith no yin—\nThough disaster strikes, it is not severe.\nThe east is the beginning of yang,\nThus one seeks the prescription from the eastern neighbor\nAnd finds a physician.\nThe sick are in distress—\nThey should return to where they incurred the affliction\nAnd make amends; this brings good fortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Initial Harmony**\n*One-Zero-Two*\nLike a newlywed bride,\nUnaccustomed to her home.\nWith diligent effort and self-reliance,\nShe will bear children in time.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThough lacking a central position,\nYin and yang are in harmony,\nInner and outer in accord.",

      "translated_text": "**Like Newlyweds, Harmony Comes Later**\nFirst harmony comes after marriage.\nIn all matters, when responses align,\nOne may rely on oneself.\nBe vigilant day and night, as if facing peril—\nOnly then will fortune come.\nIllness and official matters bring no suffering;\nAll affairs turn auspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nMarriage begins without harmony but ends in accord.\nTrade, business, and all undertakings prosper.\nOfficial matters remain difficult to resolve.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe bride is newly wed, unaccustomed to her home—\nTheir bond is not yet deep.\nWith diligent effort and self-reliance,\nThey build their household.\nIn this hexagram, yang is above and yin below,\nEach in its proper place, yet not yet intimate.\nLike a new bride, their connection exists but is not yet profound.\nYet the central position is unobstructed;\nThough distant at first, they grow close in time.\nThus, with perseverance and effort, harmony is ultimately achieved.\nFor matters facing obstacles, one must apply force—\nEven in military campaigns, resolution comes in the end.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Barren Soil**\n*One-Zero-Three*\nThe earth is high, the stone unyielding;\nOne looks up and pleads to heaven.\nThe plow lies idle, the hoe unused—\nThe fields stand barren, the crops sparse.\n\n**Yan says:**\nWithin and without, all is yang,\nWith no yin qi.\nMoisture cannot penetrate;\nPlowing and sowing are in vain.\n\n**He says:**\nAll matters require action—\nSeek, and you shall attain.\nWithout seeking, it is like famine from no plowing,\nOr drought from no rain.\nOrdinary affairs fare as usual;\nSilkworms and fields follow the same pattern.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe earth is high, the stone unyielding—\nHardness without harmony.\nLooking up to plead to heaven,\nThere is nothing to be done.\nIn this hexagram, three yang lines occupy the earthly positions,\nWith no yang above and no one in the central place—\nIsolated, unable to nurture life.\nAll matters are hollow;\nLabor yields no results.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Malevolent Spirits**\n*One-Zero-Four*\nEvil spirits dwell in the house,\nSitting in pairs, watching.\nThey wait for transgressions,\nCutting off water and fire.\nHeavenly and earthly spirits\nLie in wait for human faults.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin and yang are unobstructed,\nYet cannot restrain one another.\nThe human position is empty,\nLeaving nothing to govern the household—\nThus, malevolent spirits fill the space.\nThis hexagram bodes ill for all matters;\nFor divining residences or illness, it is especially ominous.\n\n**He says:**\nOne should perform rites to cultivate blessings and avert misfortune,\nAnd take great care with water and fire.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nEvil spirits in the house arise from accumulated yin qi.\nYang is solitary and cut off,\nWith no one in the central position.\nWater and fire are severed—\nThe human path withers.\nThis hexagram is inauspicious for all matters.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Emptiness**\n*Two-Zero-One*\nFelling trees in water,\nFishing on a mountain.\nWasted effort, lost strength—\nEmpty hands, hollow words.\n\n**Yan says:**\nThe human position is vacant,\nHeaven and earth inverted.\nAttempting deeds or creating things—\nAll come to naught.\nThus it is said:\nFelling trees in water,\nFishing on a mountain—\nNothing is gained.\nThis hexagram portends great misfortune for marriage,\nAnd illness cannot be cured—\nFor yin and yang are overturned.\n\n**He says:**\nTravelers do not return,\nThe ill grow gravely worse,\nMarriages fail to unite,\nOfficial matters are hard to resolve—\nNothing is favorable.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFelling trees in water defies the proper course.\nEmpty hands, hollow words—\nThere is nothing to sustain life.\nIn this hexagram, yin and yang are inverted,\nWith no human position—\nLike fishing on a mountain or felling trees in water.\nWhat is sought cannot be obtained;\nAll matters are inauspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Two Widows**\n*Two-Zero-Two*\nTwo women without husbands,\nQuarreling, living apart.\nThey go out and return by different paths,\nDwelling in separate chambers.\n\n**Yan says:**\nWithin and without, all is yin,\nTheir wills do not align.\nLike two women without husbands,\nThey inevitably contend.\nResidences bring misfortune;\nMarriages do not succeed.\nThis hexagram is inauspicious for all matters—\nTwo yin lack a master.\n\n*The Book of Changes* says:\n\"Two women dwelling together,\nTheir wills do not harmonize.\"\nThis hexagram is greatly inauspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nIt is as if there is an intent to separate,\nLike moving yet not fully moving.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nAbove and below are two yin—\nWomen without husbands.\nGoing out and returning by different paths,\nThe chamber is empty.\nIn this hexagram, above and below are both yin,\nWith no master in the center—\nThus the image of two women without husbands,\nTheir wills unaligned, dwelling apart.\nFor the diviner, all matters run counter;\nWhat is sought brings misfortune.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Repeated Peril**\n*Two-Zero-Three*\nTwo follow one another,\nSeeking to avoid danger.\nThey encounter calamity and fall into a well—\nStrength and effort are in vain.\n\n**Yan says:**\nSeeking to evade yin’s harm,\nThey lose their position.\nAs if falling into a well in peril,\nHands and feet remain, yet strength cannot be applied.\nNothing is accomplished;\nConstruction and planning often fail.\nTraveling afar is most inauspicious.\n\n**He says:**\nDesiring action, there is nowhere to apply force.\nWhat is sought is not obtained;\nWhat is done does not succeed.\nFor divining illness, it is especially ominous.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nSeeking to avoid danger,\nTheir hearts are suspicious.\nEncountering calamity and falling into a well—\nHow lamentable.\nIn this hexagram, lesser

Depletion**\n*Two-Zero-Four*\nFrost and snow swirl,\nSoaking my robes.\nThe north wind blows upon me—\nI cannot return home.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin qi prevails,\nWithin and without, no master.\nAdrift in wind and snow,\nThe path home is lost.\nThis hexagram brings many faults;\nFor travelers, it is especially inauspicious.\nSeeking office or trade—\nNothing goes as desired.\n\n**He says:**\nNothing is accomplished;\nThere is slander and flattery—\nOne must be cautious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFrost and snow swirl—\nYin qi gathers.\nUnable to return home,\nThere is no household.\nThis hexagram is inauspicious for all matters—\nKeep far from it.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Futile Effort**\n*Three-Zero-One*\nJourneying east to gather herbs,\nOne ascends Mount Tai.\nNo magic mushrooms are found—\nOnly fragrant orchids.\nOrchids are not urgently needed;\nOne returns empty-handed.\n\n**Yan says:**\nWithin and without, pure yang—\nThey do not respond.\nDoubled hardness above,\nLike

correspond,\nYin and yang hold their positions.\nThus, one journeys far to the seas,\nIlluminating and exalting nine generations.\nYet on the road, there is no master—\nThe treasured jade, cattle, and sheep\nInevitably fall to bandits.\nThis hexagram is slightly auspicious.\nFor military campaigns, there is victory;\nLelang lies in the Eastern Sea.\n\n**He says:**\nIf one seizes others’ possessions,\nIt will bring misfortune.\nHasten to return them, and it will be auspicious.\nOr if household items are taken when they should not be,\nThis, too, is inauspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nPursuing bandits and capturing fugitives\nIs a journey to achieve conquest.\nReaching Lelang\nIs the toil of a distant expedition.\nLeading back my cattle and sheep\nIs reclaiming what was lost.\nThis divination shows yin and yang in their proper positions, responding to one another,\nYet lacking a central position—\nThus, it bears the image of being robbed,\nOf suffering loss.\nOne must exert effort in a distant campaign before awaiting success.\nThe diviner labors first, then achieves;\nIn warfare, there is initial hardship, then victory.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Thieves and Bonds**\n*Four-Zero-One*\nThieves seize precious treasures,\nDesiring to make them their own.\nPeople expose their deceit,\nGhosts bind their arms.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin occupies heaven’s position,\nWhile yang is cast below—\nLike petty men usurping the vessels of gentlemen,\nDrawing the censure of both men and spirits.\n\n**He says:**\nIf illness arises from seizing others’ possessions,\nHasten to return them.\nGuard against gossip;\nThis hexagram is greatly inauspicious.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThieves seize precious treasures,\nBut ghosts bind them—\nThey cannot possess them.\nThis, too, is shameful.\nThis divination arises from a single yin residing in heaven’s position,\nWhere it does not belong—\nThis is theft.\nThough yang is solitary and weak,\nIt is not something we can suddenly claim.\nThus, men and spirits both strike,\nAnd there is no escape.\nAll divined matters are inauspicious,\nExcept for capturing thieves, which will surely succeed.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Military Defeat and Calamity**\n*Four-Zero-Two*\nDefying the Dao, violating principle,\nYin and yang wound one another.\nAugust Heaven offers no protection—\nInstead, one reaps disaster.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin usurps yang’s position,\nThus, it is called defiance and rebellion.\nIn all matters, following principle brings auspiciousness;\nViolating principle brings misfortune.\n\n**He says:**\nIllness is difficult to cure,\nLegal matters do not resolve,\nThose who hear lawsuits are harmed,\nMilitary campaigns lose discipline,\nMerchants profit little.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nDefying the Dao, violating principle—\nPositions are improper.\nYin and yang wound one another—\nThis cannot endure.\nThis divination arises from extreme yin occupying the upper position,\nDefying the Dao.\nWith no human position in the center\nAnd no correspondence below,\nThough it may usurp for a time,\nDisaster lurks within.\nAll divined matters are inauspicious.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Cliques and the Suppression of Worthies**\n*Four-Zero-Three*\nThe crooked advance, the upright retreat,\nFailing to hold their rightful posts.\nWorthy men hide in seclusion,\nGentlemen sigh in despair.\n\n**Yan says:**\nYin advances, yang retreats—\nThus, it is called loss of office.\nWorthy men and gentlemen\nCannot be employed,\nSo they hide in seclusion and sigh.\nAs the saying goes:\n“Promote the upright, set them above the crooked,\nAnd the people will submit.\nPromote the crooked, set them above the upright,\nAnd the people will not submit.”\n\n**He says:**\nNothing succeeds;\nIt is best to withdraw and act with integrity.\nIf public words go unheeded,\nAdapting to the times brings auspiciousness.\nGentlemen meet misfortune,\nPetty men meet good fortune.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nThe crooked advance, the upright retreat—\nThis is inversion.\nPetty men seize the moment,\nGentlemen withdraw.\nThis divination shows a host of yin usurping power,\nWhile yang is relegated below,\nFar from intimacy—\nThus, it bears the image of the crooked advancing, the upright retreating,\nWorthy men hiding in seclusion.\nIn all matters, it is best to retreat;\nHolding to integrity brings auspiciousness.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Verbal Strife and Auspicious Expenditure**\n*Four-Zero-Four*\nThe eastern household takes a bride,\nThe western neighbor hosts a feast.\nWith clamor and clatter, they bind the swine,\nWith yelps and barks, they beat the dogs.\nBe vigilant against misfortune,\nTo avoid external calamity.\n\n**Yan says:**\nMatters arise from a single gathering;\nDo not partake in their hall—\nThis is auspicious.\nOr if there is a wedding rite, it is auspicious,\nFor it is a gathering of like-minded friends.\n\n**He says:**\nInner and outer positions are evenly matched:\nThough the eastern household has the joy of a bride,\nThe western neighbor can still host a feast.\nThe two families slaughter dogs and beat swine,\nVying in extravagance,\nFutilely scheming and comparing—\nBoth will face verbal strife.\nIt is also said:\nThis hexagram brings disputes, legal matters, and marriages—\nOnly by yielding possessions will it be auspicious.\nFor the ill, performing good deeds is advised.\nThis hexagram is middling.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nTaking a bride, hosting a feast—\nInner and outer are evenly matched.\nIf they compete without expiation,\nCalamity will surely follow.\nThis divination shows both upper and lower as extreme yin,\nTheir forms evenly matched.\nOne household takes a bride, the other hosts a feast,\nCompeting in revelry,\nIndulging without restraint—\nThis is the nature of petty men:\nJoy reaches its peak, then turns to excess,\nAnd sorrow arises.\nThus, if one can exercise restraint, misfortune may be avoided;\nOtherwise, disputes and violent conflicts will ensue.\nThe diviner must be cautious.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of the Unmanifest**\n*One-Zero-Zero*\nPrimordial qi first stirs,\nThe myriad things are yet unformed.\nLight has not yet merged,\nEntrance and exit are shrouded in darkness.\nJust as it begins to move and take shape,\nNothing comes to fruition.\n\n**Yan

delay;\nNothing can be swiftly accomplished.\n\n**He says:**\nAffairs do not succeed,\nThe ill recover on their own,\nAll matters are middling,\nDesires remain unfulfilled.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nPrimordial qi first stirs,\nYet nothing accompanies it.\nEntrance and exit are shrouded in darkness—\nProfound and unfathomable.\nThis hexagram shows that affairs do not succeed;\nAll matters are middling.\n\n---\n\n**Hexagram of Transience and Subtlety**\n*Two-Zero-Zero*\nFrom heaven, images are established,\nQi still drifts and wanders.\nUnable to settle,\nIt flows east and west.\n\n**Yan says:**\nFrom one to two, the steps begin to multiply,\nYet the foundation’s traces have just emerged.\nThe human path is not yet established—\nThus, it drifts and flows,\nUnable to find stability,\nAn image of aimless wandering.\nDesires cannot be fulfilled.\n\n**He says:**\nHuman affairs are unsettled—\nAn omen of incompletion.\n\n**Explanation says:**\nFrom heaven, images are

      "translated_text": "In the third month of the year *xinchou*, the Khitans launched a massive invasion, encircling the city of Yan. The open fields were filled without a single empty space, covered entirely in white earth. The gentry and common folk were struck with terror, while officials and subordinates were seized with confusion. The young and the weak, women and children, could not be secured even from morning to night. With no one to appeal to, I burned incense and consulted the *Lingqi Jing*. The divination yielded a hexagram of three *yang* above, two *yin* in the middle, and two *yin* below, with the following judgment: \"The land is at peace, without hardship or difficulty. Most suitable for sowing and cultivation; advantageous for travel and return.\"\n\nThe next day, the Prefect of the Bureau of Merit, the Lord of Boling, summoned me to drink and discuss the matter. Boling said, \"Yesterday, I too received this same omen.\" At that time, the Khitan siege grew increasingly pressing. A monk from my clan, who had just taken charge of the household, came to offer comfort. We again devoutly prayed and cast the lots, and the previous hexagram reappeared.\n\nBy the fifth month, no relief forces had arrived. I and my peers—Magistrate Zhou of Changping, Magistrate Wu of Huailai, and Chief Captain Zhao Zonggu—lodged at the garrison post. Anxious that the reinforcements were delayed, we spoke of the *Lingqi Jing*. At the group’s request, we devoutly prayed and cast the lots, obtaining a hexagram of two *yang* above and one *yin* in the middle. Seeing the hexagram’s form incomplete, the entire company was stunned and sighed in dismay. The judgment read: \"Entrusting matters to others, one awaits their intent day by day. Only now is joyful news obtained. Affairs will require delay, but the aspiration will ultimately be preserved.\" Yan said: \"Due to its solitary and humble position, it cannot stand alone. If auspicious, it will remain so in the end, though the outcome will be slow.\"\n\nBy the sixth month, the peril and distress had grown even more severe. I again requested to cast the lots, but the group said, \"Enough, enough. Even if a favorable hexagram appears, we dare not trust it. If it turns out ill, our sorrow will only deepen.\" I silently said to myself: \"Just cast them. If the result is good, we will rejoice; if ill, I will devise my own plan to escape.\" Thus, I cast the lots and once more obtained the hexagram of \"the land is at peace, without hardship or difficulty.\"\n\nOn the ninth day of the seventh month, my disciple, the physician Guo Tong, came to visit and offer comfort. I was not at home, so he spoke with my sons about the *Lingqi Jing*. They earnestly prayed again and cast the lots, obtaining once more the hexagram of \"the land is at peace.\" I then made a vow: if I were delivered from this calamity, I would hand-copy ten volumes of the text to transmit to those of like mind.",

Thus did I know that utmost sincerity moves the divine, and utmost sincerity moves the numinous. With reverence, I record this affair and append it to the end of my ten-volume transcription.\n\n—Preface by Han Yun, the Purple-Gathered Mountain Recluse of the Dang Clan\n\nThe name of this scripture appears in the *Tangshu Jingji Zhi*, and the *Nanshi* further records that Hong Mi of the Southern Qi also used it to divine fortune and misfortune. The text it preserves matches this one. In our present dynasty, Yang Wengong’s *Tanyuan* likewise records this scripture, attesting to its divinations as spirit-like in accuracy. My late father once hand-copied it as a treasured family text.\n\nWhen I was still in the womb, my father had just suffered the loss of his teacher, and enemy scouts had already infiltrated our lands. He was ordered to depart with haste. Casting the lots, he obtained the hexagram \"secure as Mount Tai,\" and indeed, no harm came to him afterward. In every divination, the hexagrams proved unfailingly accurate—how numinous this scripture is!\n\nUpon close study of its prognostic verses, one must conclude they were composed by a Han-dynasty hand, not by any diviner of the Three Kingdoms or later. In essence, each divination invariably strikes the mark of affairs, unlike other arts that vaguely foretell fortune or misfortune. Its verses lean more toward the ominous than the auspicious, akin to the *Yijing*’s principle that \"fortune and misfortune, regret and humiliation arise from movement.\" In any single inquiry, only one outcome is favorable, while three are fraught with misfortune, regret, or humiliation—is this not the natural principle of waxing and waning, fullness and emptiness?\n\nAmong the divination texts of our age, the *Yijing* and *Liuren* are the most reliable for discerning the constant Dao, yet their meanings run deep and obscure, difficult to grasp. At worst, their interpretations branch into myriad possibilities, and their calculations diverge. How could they compare to this scripture, so clear and penetrating, revealing its judgments with simplicity and directness?\n\n—Inscribed by Zhang Shi of Nanxuan",
