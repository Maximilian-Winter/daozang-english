  "full_translation": "The Imperially Commissioned *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division: Oral Exegesis of the Zhuangzi*\n*Daoist School* | *Abstract*\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: *Oral Exegesis of the Zhuangzi* in ten juan was composed by Lin Xi-yi of the Song. Xi-yi’s *Explanation of the “Artificers’ Record”* is recorded separately. This work is one of his three *Oral Exegeses*. A preface by the author states in essence: Reading the *Zhuangzi* presents five difficulties. One must first be well-versed in the *Analects*, *Mengzi*, *Great Learning*, and *Doctrine of the Mean*, with a mind already settled in principle. Furthermore, one must understand the veins of literary composition and the interpretive techniques of Chan Buddhism before grasping its meaning. I once heard these matters from Le-xuan, and through Le-xuan, I learned of Ai-xuan’s teachings. Thus, I gained a rough understanding of the veins of literary composition. I also delved into Buddhist texts and thereby awakened to the mechanisms of its free and transformative changes. In this work, I have achieved some insights, which are truly what previous scholars have not fully explored.\n\nXi-yi’s learning originated with Chen Zao. Zao’s learning was transmitted from Lin Guang-chao—Le-xuan being Zao’s sobriquet, and Ai-xuan being Guang-chao’s sobriquet. All references to “the former teacher” in the text refer to Zao.\n\nThe preface states that Guo Xiang’s commentary fails to divide chapters and parse sentences, while the explanations of Wang Pang and Lü Hui-qing obscure the main purport, further increasing doubts about the *Zhuangzi*. Now, upon examination: Guo Xiang’s commentary marks meaning beyond the boundaries of conventional thought. Xi-yi, by contrast, seeks it through chapter and verse—his perspective is already narrow. The commentaries of Wang and Lü take the *Zhuangzi* to explain the *Zhuangzi*, without forcing it to conform to Confucian principles. This is to return Daoist words to the Daoists, avoiding the conflation of the Two Schools with the Confucian gate. Xi-yi, however, having taken refuge in the Daoist gate to annotate the *Zhuangzi*, feared reproach from Confucians and thus claimed it harmonized with the Sage. This is a strained and defensive view. Yet in truth, his approach takes the *Zhuangzi* on its own terms, allowing each to elucidate its own meaning. Moreover, his expositions are clear, lucid, and fluent, avoiding abstruse language. He offers many insights into the *Zhuangzi*, surpassing later figures like Lin Yun-ming, whose fragmented and shallow readings apply the methods of examination essays to the *Zhuangzi*. Thus, we record and preserve this work to represent one school of thought.\n\nRespectfully submitted after collation in the eleventh month of the forty-third year of the Qianlong reign.\n*Chief Compilers:*\n*Minister* Ji Yun\n*Minister* Lu Xi-xiong\n*Minister* Sun Shi-yi\n\n**Chief Collator:**\n*Minister* Lu Fei-chi\n\n**Original Preface to *Zhuangzi Kouyi***\n\nZhuangzi was a man of Song, named Zhou, styled Zixiu. Born in Suiyang County of Meng during the early Warring States period, he lived contemporaneously with Mencius, yet withdrew from the world to speak freely. The book he authored bears his name, and he himself divided it into three parts: seven Inner Chapters, fifteen Outer Chapters, and eleven Miscellaneous Chapters. Though thus arranged, the three modes of expression—*yuyan* (parables), *zhongyan* (weighted words), and *zhiyan* (goblet words)—pervade the entire work. The Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters take their titles from their opening lines, while the Inner Chapters bear names with distinct meanings. Their language is more refined than that of the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters, yet the intent of their arguments differs not at all.\n\nChen Tongfu once remarked: \"The world cannot do without such a man, nor without such a book, for only then can a gentleman’s discourse be complete.\" Though Zhuangzi’s work may be deemed unorthodox, it is indispensable to the world. Guo Xiang called it \"unorthodox yet the crown of the Hundred Schools\"—a fair judgment. This book cannot be left unread, yet it is most difficult to read. Su Dongpo’s lifelong writings were all awakened by it; the five thousand and forty volumes of the *Great Treasury of Scriptures* were all drawn from its depths. Even the literary prowess of Zuo Qiuming and Sima Qian cannot rival it. How, then, could one not read it? Yet why is it called difficult?\n\nMaster Yichuan said: \"Buddhist scriptures are like lewd sounds and alluring colors, easily bewitching people, for their language is shocking and their appearances deceptive.\" How much more so with this book? Its discussions of *renyi* (benevolence and righteousness) and *xingming* (nature and destiny) differ entirely from our own—this is the first difficulty. Its intent is to rival the Master (Confucius), so its words often exceed proper bounds—this is the second difficulty. It disdains the vulgar and mediocre, like the Buddhist teachings of the \"supreme vehicle,\" so its language is often excessively lofty—this is the third difficulty. Its brushwork dances and transforms, defying the paths of ordinary prose—this is the fourth difficulty. Moreover, its linguistic veins and thrusts resemble the Chan school’s \"sudden teaching,\" akin to matters on the edge of a sword—something absent in our Confucian texts—this is the fifth difficulty.\n\nOnly one well-versed in the *Analects*, *Mencius*, *Zhongyong*, and *Great Learning*, with a firm grasp of principle, an understanding of textual bloodlines, and knowledge of Chan techniques, can trace its words and meanings to their proper places. Though its style may be unrestrained and playful, its great principles and fundamental tenets never diverge from the Sage. Without such discernment, one may impose arbitrary interpretations, either dismissing it as heretical or being swayed by its allure, leading to licentiousness or emptiness. Thus, Yichuan’s warning about \"lewd sounds and alluring colors\" is not to be taken lightly.\n\nIn my youth, I once heard of Le Xuan’s teachings, and through him, of Ai Xuan’s doctrines. I gained a rough understanding of textual bloodlines and later delved into Buddhist scriptures, awakening to its mechanisms of transformation. I flatter myself that I have gained some insight into this book, uncovering what previous scholars had not fully explored. Finally, I encountered the commentaries of Lü Jifu and Wang Yuanzhe. Though they divided chapters and parsed sentences more finely than Guo Xiang, their grasp of the great principles remained unclear. Their interpretations only deepened doubts about Zhuangzi. Yet, in my humble view, this book stands alone in the world, never having offended the Confucian gate. Were Zhuangzi to return today, he might well call me a \"disciple of a thousand years hence.\"\n\nThis is not offered as a contribution to the author but shared with fellow seekers.\n\n**Preface by Lin Xi-yi**\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Volume One\nBy Lin Xi-yi of the Song Dynasty\n**Inner Chapters: \"Free and Easy Wandering\" (First)**\n\n\"Free and Easy Wandering\" is the title established for this chapter. The Inner Chapters comprise seven, each named with three characters. *You* (游) refers to the mind’s wandering in the heavens. *Xiaoya* (逍遥) speaks of leisurely ease and unconstrained freedom. In the *Analects*, the disciples describe the Master with but a single word: *le* (乐, joy). In the *Three Hundred Poems*, when depicting figures—such as \"southward, the trailing vine\" or \"on South Mountain, the terrace\"—they say *le* (乐, joy), for even the noble person knows only this one *le*. Thus, what is called \"Free and Easy Wandering\" is precisely the *le* of the *Poetry* and the *Analects*. The entire work begins with this single word, *le*—consider the breadth of this old man’s heart! If one can perceive even a trace of its flavor here, then one may read *Fayi* (*芣苢*). That poem depicts the joy within the heart without ever uttering the word *le*—such is the marvel of its poetic method, like adding yet another tier to a seven-story pagoda.\n\nIn the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun’s size—who knows how many thousand *li* it spans? It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The Peng’s back—who knows how many thousand *li* it stretches? Roused to flight, its wings hang like clouds draped across the sky. This bird, when the seas surge, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond. *Qi Xie* is a record of marvels. Its words say: When the Peng migrates to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, spiraling upward on the whirlwind to ninety thousand *li*, departing with the six-month winds. The wild horses, the dust motes—\n\nThe living creatures are blown along by the breath—is the azure of the sky its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no limit? From its vantage below, it sees only thus. Moreover, when water accumulates, if it is not deep, it cannot bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the hall, and a mustard stalk becomes a boat; place the cup there, and it sticks fast, for the water is shallow and the vessel too large. When wind accumulates, if it is not thick, it cannot bear great wings. Thus, only with ninety thousand *li* of wind beneath does the wind suffice. Only then, borne upon the wind, its back against the blue sky, meeting no obstacle, does it at last set its course southward.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: \"We dart forth and fly, striking the elm and sandalwood; sometimes we fall short and land on the ground—what need is there to rise ninety thousand *li* and journey south?\" This passage merely depicts the boundless joy within the breast, yet it sets forth this metaphor. Its meaning is this: what men perceive is small, hence the clamor of worldly strife. But if one knows that beyond heaven and earth there are such vast worlds, one’s own body, though but a grain in the granary, cannot be compared. This is the same idea as Dai Jinren’s \"ant-horn barbarians.\"\n\nThe Northern Darkness is the Northern Sea. The names Kun and Peng are but allegory. Some interpret them in terms of yin and yang—all such explanations impose divisions where none exist. When a bird takes flight, the word \"roused\" alone is extraordinary. \"Sea surge\" means the stirring of the sea. Even now, folk songs from the coast speak of \"the sixth-month sea surge.\" When the sea stirs, great winds arise, its waters seething from the depths, their roar audible for *li*. Only with such winds can the migration southward occur.\n\nThe Southern Darkness is also a sea. Zhuangzi further glosses it as the Celestial Pond. *Qi Xie* is the name of a book, its records all strange and extraordinary matters, much like the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. Yet this book may not have existed; Zhuangzi composed this account and then cited it as proof—another instance of his playful artistry. \"Spiraling\" describes flight; \"whirlwind\" is the force of the wind. \"Three thousand\" and \"ninety thousand\" merely convey its vast height and distance.\n\nThe bird departs with the sixth-month *qi*—this means its comings and goings must pause for half a year before it can take flight.\n\nThe lines on \"wild horses\" and \"dust motes\" are the most extraordinary passage in this text. The preceding and following sections often lack coherence. \"Wild horses\" are floating gossamer threads; \"dust motes\" are water vapor, as Du Fu wrote: *\"Falling blossoms, drifting gossamer—still the white sun.\"* These \"wild horses\" and \"dust motes\"—whence do they arise? They are the living things of the world, their breaths mutually stirring one another, so that such phenomena appear in the empty sky. These three lines are meant to set the stage for what follows, first establishing this scene: when one gazes upward at the heavens, they appear deep blue—yet is this their true color? Or is it merely that our vision, having reached its limit, finds no end above, and thus sees only a hazy expanse? When the *peng* soars to the heavens, its view downward upon the human realm spans countless *li*; the breaths of \"wild horses\" and \"dust motes\" stirring one another must appear just as hazy, much like our view upward from below. These lines serve only to depict the vast height of the *peng*'s flight, yielding such marvelous effect. If, as some interpretations hold, the *peng* were taken as vast and \"wild horses\" and \"dust motes\" as minute, the preceding and following lines would fail to connect, and the passage’s power would be lost.\n\n\"For the waters to accumulate\"—their depth is the metaphor for the wind below. A hollow in the hall—a deep recess. If the water is shallow, it can only float a mustard seed; place a cup or bowl there, and it will stick fast. *Jiao* (胶) is pronounced *jiao*, meaning \"to adhere, unmoving.\" When the *peng* is in the heavens, nine *wan li* above the earth, winds rise from valleys and ravines, swelling mightily to fill the four seas. With the *peng* aloft, these winds lie beneath it, forming a thick foundation. Only a wind of nine *wan li* can be called \"thick\"; such a wind alone can bear the *peng*'s wings, allowing it to \"ride the azure heavens\"—this speaks to the height of its flight. \"No obstruction bars its way,\" and it plans its journey south from the Northern Sea.\n\n\"To *tu* (图) is to plan. The *tiao* (蜩) is the cicada. The *xuejiu* (鸴鸠) is the small dove that learns to fly—*xue* may also be written as *yu* (鸒), pronounced *yu*, and is merely another small bird; both characters are interchangeable. *Jue qi* (决起) means to take off in flight. *Qiang* (抢) is to dash forward. Taking off in flight, it dashes toward the elm or sandalwood, rising no more than a *zhang* or *chi* in height, and sometimes fails to reach even that, falling back to the ground—*kong tou* (控投) means to cast itself down. This is the extent of its flight, and even then, it sometimes cannot achieve it. Yet it presumes to borrow the wind of ninety thousand *li* to migrate south to the Celestial Pond—what use is that? This is to say that those of shallow vision and narrow capacity do not comprehend the vastness of the world.\n\nThose who travel to the *mangcang* (a distant but reachable place) depart and return in three meals, their bellies still full. Those who journey a hundred *li* must prepare provisions the night before. Those who travel a thousand *li* must gather supplies for three months. How can these two insects understand? Lesser knowledge cannot grasp greater knowledge; short years cannot fathom long years. How do we know this is so? The morning mushroom knows not the waxing and waning of the moon; the summer cicada knows not spring and autumn—these are short years. South of Chu, there is the *fangling* (a mythical tree), for which five hundred years make a spring, and five hundred years make an autumn. In high antiquity, there was the great *chun* (a legendary tree), for which eight thousand years make a spring, and eight thousand years make an autumn. Yet Pengzu alone is renowned for his longevity—how pitiful that common people compare themselves to him!\n\nThe *mangcang* is a place visible at a glance, appearing indistinct in the distance. To travel there and back requires no more than three meals, and one’s belly remains full, the food not yet fully digested—this speaks to its nearness.\"\n\nTo journey a hundred *li* requires grinding grain the night before departure—one cannot rely on just three meals. For a thousand-*li* journey, provisions must be gathered for three months.\n\nThese three lines illustrate how human travel varies in distance, thus requiring more or less sustenance—just as human perceptions differ in scope, so too do their aspirations vary in reach. This further serves as an analogy for the Peng and the cicada-and\n\nWhen Tang questioned Ji about this, it was indeed so. Beyond the barren north lies a vast sea, the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, spanning thousands of *li* in breadth, its length unknown—its name is Kun. There is also a bird there, named Peng, whose back resembles Mount Tai and whose wings are like clouds draped across the sky. It soars upon the whirling winds, spiraling upward ninety thousand *li*, piercing through the clouds and bearing the azure heavens on its back before setting its course southward, bound for the Southern Darkness.\n\nThe quail scoffs at it, saying: *\"Where does it think it’s going? I leap and flutter upward no more than a few fathoms, then glide among the mugwort and artemisia—this is the utmost of flight! Where does it think it’s going?\"*\n\nThis is the distinction between small and great. This passage merely restates the previous one with further evidence: Tang once questioned Ji about this very matter. Ji was a man’s name, and *is indeed so* refers back to the earlier account. Here, the concluding phrase of the prior section becomes the opening of this one—such is the rhythmic cadence of the composition. *Barren north* denotes the land of no vegetation. *Whirling winds* describes the force of the gale; *ram’s horns* refers to the spiraling shape of the wind. *To soar* means to take flight. *Piercing the clouds* signifies that at ninety thousand *li* above, there are no longer any clouds—just as people say that atop Mount Tai, clouds gather below and thunder rumbles like an infant’s cry, or as some claim clouds only fill the mid-heavens. *Setting its course southward* means planning the journey to the Southern Darkness, first devising the migration before heading toward the southern sea.\n\nThe *marsh sparrow* refers to the small bird of the marshes. Its utmost flight—soaring among the mugwort and wormwood—is its greatest joy. Why should it seek elsewhere? Its perspective mirrors that of the previous passage.\n\nThus, those whose knowledge suffices for an office, whose conduct matches a village, whose virtue pleases a lord, or whose governance commands a state—such men regard themselves no differently than the marsh sparrow. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. Though the whole world praises him, he feels no encouragement; though the whole world blames him, he feels no discouragement. He has settled the distinction between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and shame—this is all. In his dealings with the world, he is not overly concerned. Even so, he has yet to establish the ultimate.\n\nLiezi could ride the wind, moving with effortless grace, returning after fifteen days. Yet even he, in attaining such felicity, was not without constraint. Though he avoided walking, he still depended on something. But one who rides the true essence of heaven and earth, harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and roams the boundless—what does he depend on? Therefore it is said: the Perfect One has no self, the Spirit Man has no merit, the Sage has no name.\n\n*Knowledge suffices for an office* means one’s wisdom can manage a single post. *Conduct matches a village* means one’s virtue and conduct can align with a village, drawing people to follow. *Virtue is recognized by a lord* means finding favor and thus being able to summon a state, governing its affairs. These three types of men each take pride in their abilities, viewing themselves like the marsh sparrow.\n\nSong Rongzi, however, perceives the greater truth. Though the whole world slanders or praises him, he remains unmoved, unshaken. How does he achieve this? He knows the original heart as inner, all things as outer. Thus it is said: he settles the division between inner and outer. What lies outside is subject to honor and shame; what lies within is beyond them. Knowing this distinction, he discerns that honor and shame are but external conditions—this is all. The principle extends no further.\n\nHe, valuing the original heart and dismissing external things, how could he eagerly pursue worldly affairs with such relentless haste? Though Song Rongzi’s ability is indeed thus, he has yet to establish a great foundation or achieve a lasting legacy.\n\nNow consider Liezi, who rides the wind and wanders between the heavens and earth, returning only after half a month. When he soars upon the wind, he is *lingran*—light and effortless—so perfectly does he embody that drifting, ethereal bearing. *Lingran* describes his floating grace; *shan* means excellence. Having mastered riding the wind, he deems those who toil to cultivate themselves for blessings—anxiously fearing they may fall short—as beneath mention. *Wei shu shu* means he does not deign to act with such frequent urgency as others.\n\nMen walk upon the earth; Liezi travels by wind. Though he is free from walking, he still depends on something—without wind, he cannot proceed. Thus it is said: he still has something to rely upon. But one who rides the inherent principle of heaven and earth, harnessing the six qi—yin and yang, wind and rain, darkness and light—and roams the beginning of the formless, without limit or end, such a one has nothing to depend upon. This marks the distinction between having traces and leaving none.\n\nTo leave no trace is to be called a *Perfect Person*, a *Spiritual Person*, a *Sage*. *Wu ji* (without self), *wu gong* (without achievement), *wu ming* (without fame)—all describe the absence of traces. The final three phrases are added to praise again and again.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, saying: “The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for its light to compare? The timely rain has fallen, yet you still irrigate—is it not laborious for your moisture to suffice? You stand, and the world is governed, yet I remain in your place. I see my own inadequacy. Please take the world.”\n\nXu You replied: “You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. Yet I would replace you—should I seek a name? A name is but the guest of reality. Would I become a guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs but a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than its fill. Return, my lord, and rest. What use have I for the world? Though the cook does not prepare the feast, the master of ceremonies would not step beyond the wine vessels to take his place.”\n\nThe torch is but a flame; with the sun and moon already bright, why hold a fire? With the timely rain already fallen, why carry a jar? Yao said to Xu You: “Stand, and the world governs itself—yet you insist I remain in this role. I see my own insufficiency,” likening himself to the torch and irrigation. *Shi* means “to preside”; *zhi tianxia* means to offer the world to you. If fame does not arise from oneself but from others, then it is external. When name is set against reality, reality is the master and name the guest. “I do not become a guest” means I do not lose myself to external things. The wren and the mole are Xu You’s self-comparisons, expressing his contentment. *Yan* means to lie low; the *yan shu* is a burrowing rat. “Return and rest, my lord” means “go back and do not trouble yourself to visit me.” The cook and the master of ceremonies have different duties—just as I cannot abandon my joys to replace you, each must guard his own role, much as the master of ceremonies would not overstep the wine vessels to take the cook’s knife.\n\nShoulder Wu asked Lian Shu: “I heard Jie Yu’s words—they were vast yet without substance, sweeping yet never returning. I was alarmed and terrified by them, as boundless as the Milky Way. They were grand yet absurd, far removed from human sentiment.”\n\nLian Shu said, “What did his words speak of?”\nShoulder Wu replied, “On the distant Mount Gushe there dwells a spirit-person. Their skin is like ice and snow, their bearing as graceful as a maiden’s. They eat no grain, but drink the wind and sip the dew. They ride the clouds and qi, harness flying dragons, and wander beyond the Four Seas. Their spirit congeals, making things free from blight so that the harvest ripens. Yet I deem this madness and do not believe it.”\n\nLian Shu said, “Indeed, the blind have no part in the sight of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. But is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? The mind, too, may suffer such afflictions. His words are like a timely admonition to you. That person, that power—it pervades all things, uniting them as one. Who in the world, seeking order, would weary themselves with petty cares? Such a one takes the world as their concern, yet nothing harms them. Though great floods rise to the heavens, they do not drown; though great droughts melt metal and stone, scorch earth and mountains, they do not burn. From their dust and chaff, they could mold even Yao and Shun. Who would trouble themselves with worldly affairs?\n\nShoulder Wu and Lian Shu may not have truly met such a person—these are but parables. Nor should one seek meaning solely in names. Though some passages may be explained, not all hold literal truth.\n\n‘Vast yet without substance’ means lacking reality. ‘Sweeping yet never returning’ means their grand words press ever onward without looking back. ‘The Milky Way’ is the celestial river, its boundlessness referring to its endless expanse. *Jingting* means distant boundaries. ‘Grand yet absurd’ means their words are extraordinary, far removed from common human sentiment.”\n\nThe Miaogu She Mountain—such is its name—is crystalline with ice and snow. What it nurtures is the fullness of yang qi, lying dormant and unmoving, thus congealed as if in ice and snow. Even today, those who practice qi-cultivation among the Daoists may achieve this. \"Graceful and supple\" describes one who is tender and lovely. A \"maiden\" is an unmarried girl. The following four lines speak of her spiritual wondrousness: her spirit is congealed and settled, and where she dwells, the hundred things naturally suffer no blight or pestilence, while the harvest ripens of itself. This is what Jie Yu meant—his words were as mad as they were deceptive.\n\nShen Wu took his words for deception, unworthy of belief. \"Indeed\" means that it is certainly so. You remain doubtful and disbelieving. The spectacle of patterns and the sound of bells and drums—all people see and hear them, yet the blind and deaf have no part in this, for theirs is a malady of the bodily form. How could this malady afflict only the body? It resides in the heart as well, for their hearts lack perception, as if deaf and blind, and thus they fail to grasp these words, dismissing them as deception.\n\n\"At this time\" refers to the present. \"You\" and \"your\" in the previous explanations were all taken to mean \"maiden,\" but this is forced and does not convey the true meaning. Rather, it means: how could such words be within the capacity of people like you? Such people, in their virtue, roam freely above the ten thousand things, and the world governs itself. How would they trouble themselves with the exhausting task of ordering the world? This speaks of their non-action that accomplishes all.\n\nThe character 蕲 is interchangeable with 祈, and 乱 signifies governance. This speaks of the people of the world who each pray for order in themselves. Yet if I but practice non-action, they will govern themselves—why should I exhaust myself with ceaseless toil? This expresses the meaning of self-imposed weariness.\n\n\"Nothing can harm them\" means that external things cannot disturb their fundamental heart-mind. The vastness of water can reach the heavens, yet such a person does not drown; the severity of drought can melt metal and stone, parch mountains and dry the earth, yet they remain unscathed—this speaks of their unobstructed self-attainment in all circumstances.\n\n\"Dust, grime, chaff, and husks\" refer to remnants and excess. It is said that if such a person were to apply these remnants, they could accomplish the deeds of Yao and Shun—how would they trouble themselves with worldly affairs? Here, \"things\" refers to worldly matters, and \"engaging in affairs\" means to undertake them. \"Molding and casting\" conveys the sense of bringing something to completion.\n\nThis single phrase aligns with what Guo Xiang called \"unconventional,\" though the original intent of his writing was to disparage the vulgar Confucians, hence his language sometimes exceeds proper bounds. One should not judge him by this alone. As Li Taibai said: \"The deeds of Yao and Shun are not so astonishing; nothing compares to the lofty purity of Boyi and Shuqi.\" How is this different?\n\nThe people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. The caps of Song were ceremonial headwear, yet the Yue, with their shorn hair, had no need for clothing or caps. The people of Song, bringing such goods to Yue, naturally found no market for them. Zhuangzi’s words here are vast, yet the people of this world, with their shallow views, find no use for them. What is the point of speaking thus? It means the world is unworthy of such discourse.\n\nYao governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm. He went to see the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu at the northern bank of the Fen River and was suddenly lost in reverie, forgetting his empire. This passage also conveys the idea that only by broadening one’s perspective can one recognize one’s own limitations. Yao, the greatest ruler of ancient and modern times, upon seeing the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu south of the Fen River, was still struck with awe and self-doubt—how much more so for others? \"Forgetting his empire\" means he forgot his dominion over the world. \"Lost in reverie\" conveys a sense of profound bewilderment.\n\nThe Four Masters are nameless; some identify them as Xu You, Nie Que, Wang Ni, and Bei Yi, while others say the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states that Mount Miaogu lies beyond the seas, and the Fen River’s northern bank was Yao’s capital. Seeing the spirits of Miaogu in his own capital was like seeing Yao’s own heart. One version divides them into four types: those who embody the root, those who follow traces, those who are neither root nor trace, and those who are neither non-root nor non-trace. Such interpretations grow increasingly absurd, failing to grasp that this is precisely Zhuangzi’s playful wit—like what people today call \"head-scratching talk.\" Those who engage in such convoluted exegesis fall right into his trap. How could they truly read Zhuangzi? In truth, these are all allegories.\n\nIn essence, it means that people are each confined by their own limited views and unaware of their delusions. Only those with great insight can illuminate and break free from them.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: \"The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to bear fruit of five *dan* in capacity. When I filled it with water or broth, its strength was insufficient to lift itself. When I split it to make ladles, they were too shallow and broad to hold anything. Though not insubstantial in size, it was utterly useless, so I smashed it.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"You are indeed inept at putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in making an unchapping salve. For generations, his family earned their living by washing silk floss. A traveler heard of this and offered a hundred pieces of gold for the recipe. The family gathered and deliberated: 'For generations, we have washed silk floss and earned no more than a few pieces of gold. Now, in a single morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred. Let us give it to him.' The traveler acquired it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue raised arms against Wu, the king sent the traveler to lead his forces. In winter, they fought a naval battle with Yue and crushed them. The king then enfeoffed him with land. The same unchapping salve could lead to enfeoffment or remain a means of washing silk floss—the difference lies in how it is used.\n\nNow you have a gourd of five *dan*—why not consider making it into a great float to drift upon the rivers and lakes? Instead, you worry that it is too shallow and broad to hold anything. Clearly, your heart-mind is still as obstructed as a clump of reeds.\"\n\nThe gourd can be made into a ladle, for it is the fruit of the bottle gourd. A single gourd of such size, bearing fruit of five *dan*, could also hold five *dan* of water. \"Firm and heavy\" describes its strength. A ladle is half a gourd. \"Shallow and broad\" describes its appearance. \"Smashed\" means to break it. The \"unchapping salve\" prevents hands from cracking in winter. \"Washing silk floss\" refers to the family’s generations-long occupation of washing silk floss using this salve. A *zun* is a floating gourd used to stay afloat in water—tying it to one’s waist allows one to float, hence the saying: \"In midstream, losing a boat, a gourd is worth a thousand gold.\" Zhuangzi, having used the unchapping salve as an analogy for failing to recognize proper use, then says: \"With such a large gourd, why not consider making it into a floating gourd for the river?\" \"Consider\" means to ponder. \"Why not consider?\" means: why does your thinking not extend to this? \"A heart-mind like reeds\" means a heart-mind as obstructed as tangled reeds. The meaning of this passage is simply that seeing only the small prevents one from using the great.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: \"I have a great tree—people call it a *chu*. Its trunk is gnarled and swollen, unfit for the carpenter’s line; its branches are twisted and bent, unfit for the compass and square. Even if planted by the roadside, no carpenter would glance at it. Now your words are vast but useless—everyone rejects them alike.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"Have you never seen a wildcat or weasel? They crouch low to lie in wait, leaping east and west, heedless of height or depth, only to be caught in a trap or snare and die. Now consider the yak: as great as a cloud hanging from the sky, it is indeed large, yet it cannot catch mice. You have a great tree and worry that it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothingness, the vast wilderness? Wander idly by its side, roam freely and sleep beneath it. It will not be felled by axes, nor will anything harm it. If it is of no use, where is the hardship in that?\"\n\n*Chu* is the name of a worthless tree. \"Great trunk\" refers to the tree’s body.\n\nThe tree is gnarled and knotted, swollen and deformed—it does not meet the carpenter’s line or compass, meaning it is of no use. Planted by the roadside, it stands near the wayside. This is how Master Hui playfully likened Zhuangzi’s grand words to uselessness.\n\nThe *li* and *sheng* are types of wildcats and foxes. *Ao* refers to creatures that roam freely. They lie in wait to prey on them, leaping and bounding without regard for height or depth—nimble and swift as they are, the moment they are caught in a trap or snare, they lose their lives. *Pi* here means \"law\" or \"method,\" and *ji pi* refers to mechanical devices.\n\nThe *mao* ox is an immense creature, yet it cannot catch mice like the *li* or *sheng*. This illustrates how things in the world vary in size and function—one cannot dismiss all great things as useless.\n\nThe \"land of Nothingness\" and the \"vast wilderness\" refer to the realm of natural creation and the supreme Dao, where one may find joy. In the bustling human world, fortune and misfortune are intertwined. But if one soars high and wanders far, delighting in the Dao, though of no use to the world, neither will harm befall them—just as the saying goes, \"The blade and saw do not touch them; the chaos of the world does not reach them.\" Thus it is said: \"It will not be felled by axes, nor will anything harm it. If it is of no use, where is the hardship in that?\"\n\nMaster Hui’s question and Zhuangzi’s answer are like a playful exchange, from which later generations have spun countless interpretations. The original source lies here.\n\n**Chapter Two: On the Equality of Things**\n*Wu lun* refers to the debates among people and things—what we call \"the many opinions.\" *Qi* means \"to unify\"; it is to harmonize all opinions into one. In the Warring States period, schools of thought differed, each refuting the other. Thus Zhuangzi believed it better to forget right and wrong and return to nature—this is the intent behind the chapter’s title.\n\nThe \"Heavenly Pipe,\" \"Earthly Pipe,\" and \"Human Pipe\" are metaphors drawn from sound. Nan Guo Ziqi leaned against his armrest, sat upright, and sighed, his gaze fixed on the sky, as if he had lost his companion. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, \"What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the mind like dead ashes? The one leaning here now is not the same as the one who leaned here before.\"\n\n*Qi ji* means \"to lean on an armrest.\" *Fang ran* describes a state of emptiness. \"Losing one’s companion\" refers to the common view of the self and things as separate—here, that distinction is forgotten. \"Withered wood\" signifies lifelessness; \"dead ashes\" mean the mind does not stir. \"The one leaning here now\" means that today, the Master’s demeanor is not like that of others who lean on armrests. Where there is a self, there are things; to lose the self is to have no self. Without self, there are no things. \"Do you understand this?\" asks whether he grasps this principle. *Wu* is the self; it does not say \"I have lost myself\" but \"I have lost *wu*.\" This means that if even a trace of selfishness remains untransformed within, there will still be a division between self and other. The three words \"I have lost *wu*\" are profoundly apt. Dongshan said, \"Now it is not I; now I am truly it\"—this is the crux of the matter.\n\n\"You have heard the Human Pipe but not the Earthly Pipe; you have heard the Earthly Pipe but not the Heavenly Pipe.\"\n\nZiyou said, \"May I ask the method?\"\nZiqi replied: \"The great clod breathes—its name is wind. It does nothing, yet when it stirs, the myriad hollows roar in fury. Have you alone not heard its howling? The towering peaks and forests, the great trees with trunks a hundred spans around—some hollows resemble noses, mouths, ears, beams, rings, mortars, pits, or puddles. They hiss, gurgle, shriek, inhale, cry out, wail, moan, and shriek again. The first calls out, and the rest follow in harmony. A gentle breeze brings a soft response; a whirlwind brings a mighty one. When the fierce gale subsides, all hollows fall silent. Have you alone not seen their trembling and swaying?\"\n\nZiqi, seeing that Ziyou’s question revealed some insight, sought to instruct him with the Heavenly Pipe and thus posed this question. *Fang* means \"method.\" He asks, \"What is the nature of this principle?\"\n\nThe Great Clump is Heaven and Earth. Why is there wind between Heaven and Earth? It is like a person’s exhalation. *Is* means \"only,\" and *wu zuo* means \"it does nothing.\" If it does not act, then all is still. But when it acts, the myriad hollows roar in fury—this speaks of how, with the slightest stirring, the entire world resounds. The myriad hollows are the hollows of the myriad trees. *Liaoliao* is the sound of a long wind. *Wei* is read as *wei*, and *cuì* is read as *cui*; *weijiacuì* describes the swaying of forests and trees. *A hundred spans around* speaks of the trees’ great girth—a girth measured by two hands clasped together. Above, the myriad hollows were mentioned; here, only the largest trees are described, from which the rest may be inferred. The hollows of great trees vary in shape, each resembling something: *jī* are the square beams atop pillars; *quān* are the round hoops like those of a cup; *wā* are the curved hollows; *wū* are the sunken ones. From *jī* to *yǎo*, these describe the sounds within the hollows. *Yú* is a light sound, and *yóng* is a heavy one. When the wind arrives first, its sound is like a leading chant; those that follow are like a responding chorus, light and heavy harmonizing. A *ling* wind is a gentle breeze; when the wind is small, the harmonizing sounds are also small. A *piāo* wind is a great wind; when the wind is strong, the harmonizing sounds are also great. A *lì* wind is a fierce, violent wind. *Jì* means \"to cease.\" Once the wind ceases, the sounds that once filled the hollows vanish, and thus they are called \"empty.\" *Tiáotiáo* and *diāodiāo* both describe the trembling and swaying of trees in the wind. Earlier, it said, \"Have you alone not heard?\" and later, \"Have you alone not seen?\"—this is the interlocking structure of the passage.\n\nAs for you—Zhuangzi’s writing excels in many ways, and this passage is among its finest, a masterpiece within a masterpiece. In the entire book, this is the foremost text; indeed, among all writers past and present, none has matched this passage. Poetry is sound, and painting is form; this describes a scene nearly impossible to depict. Yet who has ever painted sound? From *jī* to *yǎo*, eight characters describe eight sounds. *Yú* and *yóng* are harmonizing sounds. The wind between Heaven and Earth is formless and invisible, yet its sound, though unseen, is vividly captured by his brush. How could the Old Immortal of Nanhua possess such skill? Every time I read this, I cannot help but dance with joy, forgetting myself. This passage speaks of the earthly pipes, yet it naturally leads to the heavenly pipes in the following section—such is the flow of his prose. Some say this describes the earthly pipes as the natural sounds of Heaven, and thus they are also the heavenly pipes. This is true, for if the wind does not arise from the workings of creation, from where else could it come? Yet observe how he first speaks of the earthly pipes, then returns to them, revealing the sinews and framework of his thought.\n\nZiyou said, \"The earthly pipes are the myriad hollows. The human pipes are the bamboo flutes. May I ask, what are the heavenly pipes?\" The human pipes are not only bamboo flutes—metal, stone, silk, and gourd instruments all belong to this category. Here, he mentions only one example. Earlier, he spoke of the earthly pipes, then the heavenly pipes, and dismisses the human pipes in a single phrase—such is the method of his writing. To read Zhuangzi’s work, one must examine it closely to find the entry point.\n\nZiqi said, \"When the wind blows through the myriad things, each sounds different, yet it allows them to be as they are. All take their own forms in anger—who is it that stirs them?\" *Blows through the myriad* refers to all things that produce sound. It speaks of how all sounding things are blown by the Creator. *Blows* and *allows* both belong to the Creator. *Take their own forms* means they take it upon themselves. *All take their own forms* means all things believe their sounds arise from their own power, unaware that it is the stirring of a single *qi*. When *qi* arises within and becomes sound, he uses the word *anger*, akin to \"angry flight,\" both attributed to the Creator.\n\n\"The great knowledge is leisurely, the small knowledge is petty. The great words blaze, the small words chatter.\" The *great knowledge* belongs to those of superior understanding; *leisurely* describes their ease and self-possession. The *small knowledge* refers to those who calculate and scheme; *petty* describes their meticulous distinctions. The *great words* belong to those with grand ambitions; *blaze* describes their radiance. Zhuangzi’s meaning includes figures like Yi, Zhou, Confucius, and Mencius in this phrase. The *small words* belong to those of limited vision; *chatter* describes their hesitation and caution. The doctrines of the Hundred Schools and the gossip of the marketplace are all contained in this phrase. These four lines summarize the two kinds of people in the world: those who understand principle and guard against affairs, and those who discuss learning, techniques, and theories.\n\n\"In sleep, their spirits intertwine; when awake, their forms open. They engage with things, forming bonds, and daily battle with their hearts.\" Having described the four kinds of people above, he now elucidates them through the human body. *In sleep, their spirits intertwine* means that at night, the spirit gathers in the heart. *When awake, their forms open* means that by day, the four limbs are in motion. These two lines encompass everyone from the emperor to the common people. *Form bonds* refers to external interactions; when people rest at night and rise at dawn, their encounters and engagements wear on their hearts like combat, day after day. Thus, he says, \"They engage with things, forming bonds, and daily battle with their hearts.\" This is akin to Mencius’s \"what one does by day may be fettered and lost by night,\" though Mencius’s phrasing is gentler. Zhuangzi’s language, however, is a hundredfold more vivid and stirring. Later Chan masters often adopted this style. *Màn*, *jiào*, and *mì* describe three kinds of people: some act slowly and hesitantly; others speak with hidden traps, hence *jiào* (pitfall); still others plan meticulously, leaving no detail unconsidered, hence *mì* (dense). These all describe how people respond to the world with their minds, yet none attain freedom—they all suffer from anxiety and fear. This is what Confucius called \"the petty man is always anxious.\" But Zhuangzi’s meaning extends even to Yao, Shun, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, who were all anxious. In minor matters, they tremble with fear, hence *small fear, trembling*. In great matters, their worries run deep, their thoughts far-reaching, as if lost or doubtful, hence *great fear, mournful*.\n\n\"Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow trigger—this is called controlling right and wrong. They cling like sworn oaths—this is called guarding victory.\"\n\nTheir decline is like autumn and winter—this speaks of their daily dissipation. What they drown in through their actions cannot be restored. Their weariness is like being bound—this speaks of their aged exhaustion. The heart near death cannot be revived. Joy, anger, sorrow, delight, thought, sighing, change, fear, restlessness, abandon, openness, and affectation—like mushrooms sprouting from empty steam, their discussions of right and wrong each have their own fixed target, as if archers aiming at a mark. Thus it is said, \"Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow trigger,\" meaning not a single word is spoken in vain. *Sī* (to govern) means to take as one’s master. The mind that clings to victory remains untransformed, lingering in the breast as if bound by a sworn oath. Their use of the mind wears them away day by day, month by month—this speaks of their inner torment.\n\nThings are born in spring and summer, wither in autumn and winter—this is the time of emaciation. Thus it is used as a metaphor for daily dissipation. The three phrases below express this meaning, while those above serve as analogies. Yet once the mind is thus submerged, it departs and cannot return—hence \"what they drown in through their actions.\" The first *zhī* (之) is a grammatical particle; the second *zhī* (之) means \"to go.\" \"Cannot be restored\" means it cannot be retrieved. The *cǐ* (此) in \"this\" also means \"to go,\" speaking of what cannot be turned back. Their being stifled by material desires is like being tightly bound—aged and beyond salvation, hence \"aged exhaustion.\" *Xù* (洫) means to fall into a ditch. Such people, though their bodies live, have hearts already like the dead. Thus it is said, \"near death,\" meaning their breasts hold no awareness. *Yáng* (阳) means life—this speaks of their hearts being dead, never to revive.\n\nThe above describes the worldly use of the mind. The twelve characters below—joy, anger, sorrow, delight, thought, sighing, change, fear, restlessness, abandon, openness, and affectation—further depict their outward appearance. For what lies within them is thus, so what appears without is now joyful, now angry, now sorrowful, now delighted, now anxious, now sighing.\n\nSuch shifting of intentions and postures—now desiring this, now longing for that. *Zhé* (慹) depicts the appearance of worry and hesitation, unmoving. *Yáo yāng xiáng* (姚央庠) describes the manner of indulgence and abandon. *Qǐ* (启) means openness, a lack of restraint. *Zuò* (做) refers to affectation, striking poses.\n\nThough people appear thus, in truth they are not free—like joy arising from emptiness, like mushrooms formed by the steaming of qi. All these various types are made to be so by the Maker of Things, as if blown by the myriad winds. This speaks of the Maker of Things, yet it does not call it \"naturally so.\" It says that when people cannot hold fast to the Dao, they produce many grotesqueries, as if ghosts and spirits made them so. Those who read the *Zhuangzi* must recognize this carefully.\n\nDay and night succeed one another before us, yet none know where they sprout. \"Enough! Enough!\"—like the modern saying, \"That’s it, that’s it,\" meaning that though the source of sprouting is unknowable, between dawn and dusk one attains only this. *This* refers to the Maker of Things. This *this* carries great weight and is not lightly placed. *Without that, there is no I*—this *that* refers back to the previous *this*, meaning that without the Maker of Things, I could not be thus. Yet the Maker of Things’ actions are only seen through the human body, hence \"without me, there is nothing to take.\" Though this explanation seems close and visible, what it reveals of the Maker of Things is still not known by people. Thus it is said, \"this is also near, yet one does not know what compels it.\" The *true master*—the Maker of Things—seems as if it exists, yet one dare not assert its actual presence. *Lián* (联) is the place of sprouting; not grasping its *lián* is to not know where it sprouts. *Kě xíng* (可行) refers to what is visible in the workings of Heaven. *Yǐ xìn* (已信) means \"most assuredly.\" The actions of the Maker of Things are indeed thus, yet its form is unseen—this is \"not knowing what compels it.\" *Yǒu qíng* (有情) means \"having reality,\" the same as *yǐ xìn*. *Wú xíng* (无形) means \"formless,\" the same as \"not seeing its form.\" From \"day and night succeed one another\" onward, all speak of the actions of the Maker of Things, which, though before our eyes, are unseen by people. The text circles back repeatedly, weaving many phrases, its words earnest and its meaning profound, urging people to reflect deeply and examine themselves.\n\nThe hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all contained within. With whom do I share intimacy? Do you delight in all of them? Or is there a private favor? Are they all like servants and concubines? Are these servants and concubines insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns being lord and subject? Is there a true ruler residing within? If one seeks to grasp its reality, whether one succeeds or not, does it harm or benefit the true?\n\nThe hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all that a person’s body possesses. What follows further elucidates a passage from the perspective of the human body, which is even more extraordinary. *Gāi* (赅) means \"complete,\" and *cún* (存) means \"present.\" It says that all these are complete and present within a person’s body. *With whom do I share intimacy?* asks: with whom do I alone share closeness? This *intimacy* is placed with great reason. For example, if one’s hand is afflicted by illness and suffers, then at that moment the hand becomes the body’s enemy. The six senses are all like this. *Do you delight in all of them?* asks whether one delights in all the six senses, or whether there is a private favor. Moreover, in the body’s functions, which is noble and which is base? When the head itches and the hand scratches, the hand serves the head. When one gazes afar and the feet walk, the feet serve the eyes. The servant is like a minister or concubine. Yet they are *insufficient to govern one another*—the hands, feet, ears, eyes, nose, and tongue all serve one another. The one that is served is the lord, and the one that serves is the subject. At times the feet are used, and at times the hands are used. Thus it is said, \"they take turns being lord and subject.\" Since the lord and subject of the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera cannot be definitively named, then is the heart the lord of the body? Yet the heart cannot govern itself, and what governs it is the Maker of Things—thus the Maker of Things is the true ruler. Hence it is said, \"Is there a true ruler residing within?\" Though I seek thus to investigate and reach the truth, whether I grasp it or not, how does it add to or diminish the so-called ruler? *Qíng* (情) means \"reality.\" Thus it is said, \"If one seeks to grasp its reality, whether one succeeds or not, does it harm or benefit the true?\"\n\nOnce one receives this completed form, it does not perish but awaits its end, clashing and grinding against things. Its course is spent like a galloping horse, yet none can halt it—is this not lamentable? Throughout life, one toils and toils without seeing success, wearily laboring without knowing where to return—can this not be grieved? People call this \"not dying,\" but what is the benefit? The body transforms, the heart follows it—can this not be called great sorrow? Is human life inherently so confused? Am I alone confused while others are not?\n\nGenerally, the human form is not self-possessed; it must be received from something. Having received this form from the Maker of Things, the Maker of Things and I remain together, not perishing until this form is exhausted. Yet people cannot wholly follow the Maker of Things; they are instead drowned by external things, now opposing, now following them. Thus they spend their lives, like a colt passing a crack, unable to rest even for a moment. Hence it is said, \"its course is spent like a galloping horse, yet none can halt it.\" *Xiāng rèn* (相刃) means opposing, and *xiāng mǐ* (相靡) means following—both convey the sense of being drowned. *Zhōngshēn yìyì* (终身役役) means self-affliction. *Not seeing success* means no benefit. The saying \"gathering a hundred flowers to make honey, yet not knowing for whom the sweetness is toiled\" expresses this idea. *Túrán pírù* (荼然疲役) further depicts the laborious toil of *yìyì*, not knowing where to return, not knowing when rest may come. Human life’s self-inflicted labor is thus. Though one may live a hundred years, what is the benefit? Hence it is said, \"not dying, what is the benefit?\" *Its form transforms*—from decline to graying, from graying to aging. As years grow higher, virtue grows more distant. This is the body transforming while the heart does not. With no insight of my own, I merely serve the body with the heart. When the body declines, the heart also wearies.\n\nThus it is said: \"The heart consents to this\"—*mángmángrán* (芒芒然), utterly without insight. Even those foolish and deluded should turn back and ask themselves: in the lives of all people, is the heart originally so benighted, so devoid of understanding? Am I alone benighted while others possess clarity? This is to say: Heaven gives birth to the teeming masses, endowing them with things and with principles. The people’s constant nature cherishes fine virtue; the heavenly principle has never been obscure. Yet you, clouded by human desire, have come to this. How could one who knows the Dao be so dim and dull? This is what is meant by \"the golden needle scraping the film\"—it urges you to open your eyes.\n\nNow, if one follows the \"completed heart\" as one’s teacher, who is there who does not have a teacher? Why must one know the ancients before the heart can make its own judgments? The foolish share in this as well. To have likes and dislikes before the heart is formed—this is like saying, \"Today I set out for Yue, yet I arrived there yesterday.\" Thus, to take what does not exist as existing—even if the divine Yu were here, he could not comprehend it. How much less could I?\n\nThe \"completed heart\" is possessed by all. This heart is the heavenly principle, vast and undifferentiated, yet lacking in nothing. It is said: at birth, you are already endowed with a fully formed heavenly principle. If you take this as your teacher, who is without it? Not only the worthy possess it; even the foolish do. *Zhī dài* (知代) refers to the worthy of old—*dài* (代) means transformation, speaking of their understanding of the principle of change. *Xīn zì qǔ* (心自取) means the heart has its own insights. If this heart has not yet perceived the undifferentiated principle but forcibly establishes judgments of right and wrong, it is like asserting that one has already arrived in Yue when one has only just set out today. Is there such a principle in the world? This is to insist on what one does not know as if one knew it. Thus, having no true insight, one insists on having it. Even if the ancient sages were to return, they could not enlighten you—how much less could others?\n\nSpeech is not like the wind. Speakers have words, yet what they say is not fixed. Is it truly speech? Or has there never been speech at all? Does it differ from the chirping of a fledgling? Or is there no difference? This chapter, being a discourse on the equalization of things and the resolution of right and wrong, first sets forth the theory of the three winds, stating that all sounds in heaven and earth arise from the Creator. It then expands upon this, explaining that the body is likewise moved by the Creator, unfolding the idea until it reaches the \"completed heart,\" where it pauses. From this point onward, it discusses the theory of right and wrong. The wind through hollows, the sound of bamboo—though myriad sounds differ, they are all merely sounds. Only when sound forms patterns is it called speech, and speech is not like the wind. What is called speech is each person speaking their own intent. Thus it is said, \"Speakers have words\"—these four characters encapsulate the discourse on right and wrong. What they say is not yet fixed. Though you may speak, is it truly your own speech, or is it the Creator speaking through you? Hence it is said to be \"not yet fixed.\"\n\nIs it truly your speech? Or have you never had such speech, and it is the Creator moving you to speak? A *kòu* (鷇) is a bird newly hatched from its egg. Its chirping is without understanding. Your speech is likewise without self-awareness. If you believe it differs from the chirping of a fledgling, can you truly distinguish it? Or is there no distinction? In truth, they are one and the same, beyond differentiation.\n\nWhere does the Dao reside that it has truth and falsehood? Where does speech reside that it has right and wrong? Where does the Dao go that it does not remain? Where does speech remain that it cannot be spoken of? The Dao is obscured by petty accomplishments; speech is obscured by flourishing embellishments. Thus arise the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. If you wish to affirm what they deny and deny what they affirm, nothing is better than illuminating that things have no \"other,\" that things have no \"this.\" From the perspective of the other, one does not see; through self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: \"The other emerges from the this; the this also follows from the other.\"\n\nThe Dao originally has no truth or falsehood—how could it become obscured and give rise to such distinctions? Speech originally has no right or wrong—how could it become obscured and give rise to such disputes? Where does it go that it does not remain? This refers to the great and small, the refined and coarse—is the Dao not present in these? Where does it remain that it cannot be spoken of? This refers to affirming affirmations and negating negations—all are acceptable. *Xiǎochéng* (小成) means a narrow view, a one-sided perspective. Only after people’s partial views arise does the Dao become obscured and unclear. *Rónghuá* (荣华) means self-aggrandizement in pursuit of fame and reputation. Partial views, when self-aggrandized, obscure the truest speech. Only after this do the Confucians and Mohists begin their disputes over right and wrong. What one denies, I affirm; what one affirms, I deny. How can this be settled? If one wishes to settle right and wrong, one must return to the natural heavenly principle—only then can it be made clear. The heavenly principle is clarity itself.\n\nThus it is said: nothing is better than illuminating that things have no \"other,\" that things have no \"this.\" To say \"from my perspective, this is right\" is to say \"from the other’s perspective, this is wrong.\" To say \"I take this as right\" is to say \"others take it as wrong.\" From the other’s perspective, I do not see; through self-knowledge, I know. Things and I do not oppose each other—thus there is no right, no wrong. Only when things and I oppose each other do right and wrong arise. Thus it is said: \"The other emerges from the this; the this also follows from the other.\" This is the theory of \"this and other arising simultaneously.\" Though it speaks of simultaneous arising, it introduces the term *fāngshēng* (方生, \"just arising\") as a metaphor. For arising must entail perishing; the two cannot be separated. To speak only of arising without speaking of perishing is to see only one side. Though you may see only one side, in principle, they cannot be separated. If there is arising, there must be perishing; if there is perishing, there must be arising. If there is \"can,\" there must be \"cannot\"; if there is \"cannot,\" there must be \"can.\" How can they be separated? Knowing that their theories cannot be separated, it is better to affirm what they affirm and deny what they deny.\n\nThe sages of old, not relying on one-sided views but illuminating with the heavenly principle, simply followed what was right. Earlier, it spoke of following both right and wrong; here, it speaks only of following right—this is an abbreviation.\n\nIs is that, and that is is. That too has its right and wrong, and this too has its right and wrong—can there truly be \"that\" and \"this\"? Or can there truly be no \"that\" and \"this\"? Where \"that\" and \"this\" find no counterpart, this is called the *pivot of the Dao*. Only when one attains the pivot and stands at the center of the ring can one respond to the inexhaustible. This too is inexhaustible, and that too is inexhaustible—thus it is said: \"Nothing compares to clarity.\"\n\nIf we debate right and wrong, then their theories each have their own right and wrong, and my theories too have their own right and wrong. How then do I differ from them? Though you distinguish between self and other, in truth, they cannot be separated. Thus it is asked: Can there truly be \"that\" and \"this\"? Or can there truly be no \"that\" and \"this\"? To say that \"that\" and \"I\" are both nothing is to speak of counterparts. If \"that\" and \"I\" do not stand in opposition but merge into one, this is the pivotal essence of the Dao. The center of a ring must be empty. If I grasp the pivotal essence of the Dao, I then begin to resemble the center of a ring. Like the center of a ring, there is no end and no beginning—it is inexhaustible. That \"this is inexhaustible\" and \"that is inexhaustible\" means to follow what is natural. In this way, one accords with the heavenly principle of nature. Thus it is said: \"Nothing compares to clarity.\" The preceding sentence is cited here to conclude this passage.\n\nTo use a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To use a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nA finger is a finger. If I take my finger to be a finger, then I take another’s finger to be not a finger. Yet that person, who is not me, takes my finger to be not a finger. If I merely take myself as right and others as wrong, it would be better to reflect on this from their perspective. If things and I stand in opposition, then right and wrong cannot be settled. The counting rods in *bo* and *sai* are like this—see the *Record of Rites*, \"Touhu\" chapter. The \"horses\" (rods) vary in number, and the players’ judgments of right and wrong vary accordingly. If we apply this principle by analogy, then heaven’s duty to cover and earth’s duty to bear can also be disputed from one-sided views. The myriad things differ—those that fly, those that walk, those that move, those that are rooted—just as the counting rods differ, and they too can be disputed from one-sided views. This illustrates that in the world, there is no fixed right and wrong. It is only because there is self and other that there is right and wrong. Can heaven and earth be divided into self and other? All these analogies show that things cannot be judged unequally.\n\nIs it acceptable? Is it unacceptable? That which is called acceptable is what things naturally become; that which is called so is what things naturally are. How is it so? It is so in being so. How is it not so? It is not so in not being so. Things inherently have what they are; things inherently have what they accept. Nothing is not so; nothing is unacceptable. What is acceptable is accepted; what is unacceptable is not accepted. Thus it is said: Is it acceptable? Is it unacceptable? That which the Dao deems fine or coarse, when put into practice, all become natural. What is called \"so\" is simply what is spoken of. What do I take as so? I take as so what is inherently so. What do I take as not so? I take as not so what is inherently not so. Things inherently have what they are—this is their original nature. It is said: \"Things inherently have what they are; things inherently have what they accept.\" Since there is what they are and what they accept, all things are like this. Thus it is said: Nothing is not so; nothing is unacceptable.\n\nTherefore, consider the examples of the stalk and the pillar, the ugly and the beautiful, the vast and the narrow, the deceptive and the straightforward, the strange and the auspicious. The stalk is a roof beam; the pillar is a house column. The beam is horizontal, the column vertical; the ugly is vile, the beautiful is fair. The vast and the narrow, the deceptive and the constant, the cunning and the honest, the monstrous and the auspicious—all differ. Yet from the perspective of the Dao, the horizontal and vertical each serve their purpose, the beautiful and the ugly each fulfill their nature, and all can be united as one. This means all return to the Creator.\n\nTheir division is their formation; their formation is their destruction. All things, without formation or destruction, return to unity. Formation and destruction are opposed to each other in things. Yet without destruction, there is no formation; without formation, there is no destruction. For example, a tree in the mountains is felled and used—this is destruction. When used to build a house, it becomes formation. Another example: herbs are prepared by cutting and grinding—this is division. When combined and harmonized, they become medicine. The sinew and horn must be present to make a bow—when in the bow, it is formation; when in the sinew and horn, it is destruction. If the Qin did not fall, the Han would not rise. Though the Han was formed, the Qin was destroyed. Viewed thus, there was originally no formation and no destruction. Thus it is said: They return to unity.\n\nOnly those who comprehend this know that unity is the Way. For this reason, they do not employ it but lodge it in the ordinary. The ordinary is use; use is penetration; penetration is attainment. When one attains and approaches the subtlest point, following this and stopping without knowing why—this is called the Dao.\n\nOnly those who comprehend the Dao know that this principle is one. They discard their assertions of right, do not employ them, but lodge them in the ordinary, using the constant. When all uses are penetrated, one naturally attains. Thus it is said: The ordinary is use; use is penetration; penetration is attainment. When one attains and approaches the subtlest point—this too means nothing more than following this without contention over right and wrong. Only when one no longer knows why but follows nature—this is called the Dao. The word \"already\" in the following sentence connects to the \"already\" in the preceding sentence—this is a playful flourish in the author’s brushwork.\n\nTo exhaust one’s spirit in forcing unity without knowing their sameness—this is called \"morning three.\" What is \"morning three\"? A monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" All the monkeys were angry. He then said, \"Then four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased. The names and realities had not changed, yet joy and anger were employed—this too is following \"this.\" Therefore, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the equality of heaven. This is called \"walking two paths.\"\n\nThe ancients’ knowledge reached its utmost—how far did it reach? There were those who regarded all as never yet having been things: this was the ultimate, the utmost, beyond which nothing could be added. Next were those who regarded things as existing yet never yet having boundaries. Next were those who regarded boundaries as existing yet never yet having right and wrong. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminution of the Dao. The diminution of the Dao is the completion of attachment. Is there truly completion and diminution? Or is there truly neither completion nor diminution?\n\nThat which has never yet been a thing is the beginning of the Supreme Ultimate. The \"ancients\" here refer to those who understood the Dao: when viewed from the beginning of no-thing, the principles of the world reach their extremity. The next stage, regarding things as existing, is the Supreme Ultimate emerging from the Limitless. From the existence of things to the existence of boundaries is the Supreme Ultimate dividing into the Two Modes. Though the Two Modes are divided—one covering, one bearing, each following its own principle—when has there ever been right and wrong? Right and wrong arise from the private biases of the human heart, their manifestation. Once private bias is revealed, the natural Dao is diminished. When the Dao is diminished, there is liking and disliking: what is within me is love, what is in things is aversion—what the Buddhists call the \"river of attachment.\" Diminishing the Dao and drowning in attachment is but the work of private bias in the human heart. Yet from the perspective of the Creator, when has there ever been completion or diminution? Thus it is said: Is there truly completion and diminution? Or is there truly neither completion nor diminution?\n\nAh! These words speak to how all disputes over right and wrong in the human world ultimately return to emptiness. Though this passage begins with the origins of Heaven and Earth, the principle it guards against is present before our very eyes. For instance, when a single thought has yet to arise, it is as if we stand at the time before things came to be. Once that thought arises, things come into existence, and with things, the self emerges—thus, boundaries are drawn. From these boundaries of self and things arise likes and dislikes, joy and anger, sorrow and delight—thus, right and wrong are born. If one cannot turn back and reflect on the moment before thought arose, then all one sees is the turmoil churning in the breast, the Dao diminished and attachment formed. Yet when this thought passes, all returns to tranquility—how then can there be completion or diminution?\n\nZhuangzi’s words may seem distant and impractical, but if one can truly embody this understanding, it becomes a matter of immediate, personal experience. There is completion and diminution, and so Zhaoshi plays the zither. There is neither completion nor diminution, and so Zhaoshi does not play the zither. Zhaowen’s zither-playing, Shikuang’s striking of the clappers, Huizi’s leaning on the catalpa table—these three men’s wisdom was nearly perfect in their arts, and thus their deeds were recorded in their later years. Yet it was only because they cherished their skills, setting themselves apart from others, that they sought to make them known. What they sought to illuminate was not inherently obscure, yet they insisted on clarifying it, and so they ended their lives entangled in the obscurities of \"hard and white.\" Their sons, inheriting their fathers’ legacies, likewise spent their lives without completion. Can this truly be called completion? Even I, too, would be complete. If this cannot be called completion, then neither things nor I attain completion.\n\nThus, the dazzling confusion of slippery doubt is what the sage seeks to resolve. To refrain from using it and instead lodge it in the ordinary—this is called \"illuminating through non-illumination.\"\n\nHaving expounded the principle of completion and diminution, he turns to the analogy of zither-playing, which is most intimate and apt. Consider a zither before you: if you play it, a melody unfolds with a clear beginning and end—this beginning and end arise only after the zither is played. If it is not played, how can there be beginning or end? It is the same with a single thought in a person: if it does not arise, there is no distinction between self and things.\n\nZhao was the surname; Wen was the given name of an ancient master of the zither. Shikuang was a music master. *Ce* refers to an object used to strike musical instruments; today, a horsewhip is also called a *ce*. In the *Zuozhuan*, Rao Chao gifts one as a *ce*, and Yang Tan strikes the West Gate with a *ce*—both are horsewhips. *Zhi* means \"to hold\"; to hold and strike is called *zhi*. These two characters likely existed in ancient speech. \"Shikuang *zhi ce*\" thus means Shikuang striking a musical instrument. *Ju wu* means leaning on a catalpa table, using it as a rest. Following the mention of zither-playing, he brings up these two figures. The three men’s skills were nearly perfected—this speaks to their wisdom being fully realized in their arts. Their techniques were refined, and they gained great renown in the world, hence \"all were at their peak.\" *Zai* means \"to engage in\"; *mo nian* means \"later years.\" This speaks to dedicating their lives to their arts.\n\nThe three men cherished their skills, believing themselves distinct from others in the world, hence \"only because they cherished them, setting themselves apart.\" Having cherished them, they then sought to display them to others, hence \"their cherishing of them.\" They wished to make them known, yet those who heard them already understood, and they insisted on clarifying what was not obscure—hence \"what they sought to illuminate was not inherently obscure, yet they insisted on illuminating it.\" This is like Huizi’s stubborn arguments, which only served to obscure. The \"hard and white\" refers to Gongsun Long’s debate, though Zhuangzi attributes it to Huizi, merely borrowing the name of the \"hard and white\" distinction. *Mei* means \"self-delusion.\" The above speaks of the three men, but here he concludes with Huizi’s arguments—this is a matter of literary structure.\n\nCommentators on \"hard and white\" take it as the debate over a hard stone and a white horse: to say \"hard\" is to speak of stone, but one need not say \"hard\" to speak of stone; to say \"white\" is to speak of a horse, but one need not say \"white\" to speak of a horse—just as \"yellow horse\" and \"black ox\" are three things. Another note in the *Records of the Grand Historian* on Su Qin’s biography says: when Longquan water tempers a sword, it becomes hard and sharp, hence the debate over \"hard and white.\" It says: yellow is for hardness, white is for sharpness. The Qi debaters countered: white is not hard, yellow is not sharp. Though the two explanations differ, both are the work of debaters.\n\nZhaowen spent his life playing the zither, and his son, inheriting his legacy, likewise spent his life continuing the art. *Lun* means \"legacy.\" Above, he speaks of Huizi, and in the next sentence, he concludes with Zhaowen’s son—this is where the brush dances. \"Spent their lives without completion\" means they only guarded their own skills, preventing others from attaining them, hence \"without completion.\" For all things under Heaven, if one relies on one’s abilities and deems them sufficient, then one’s present abilities can be called sufficient. But if one’s present abilities are not sufficient, then no one under Heaven, including oneself, can be called sufficient. *Cheng* means \"sufficient.\"\n\nThough these two sentences conclude the discussion of the three men’s skills, their meaning is vast. The three men’s skills are but metaphors for the debates over things and right and wrong—they are not solely about the three men. *Hua yi* means \"indistinct and unclear\"; *hua* is confusion, and *yi* is doubt, appearing clear yet not clear. *Yao* means \"bright.\" The sage’s mind does not cling to traces, and what it perceives is as if present, as if absent. *Tu* means \"to desire\"—this speaks to what the sage desires. Thus, he discards the \"this\" and does not employ it, lodging it instead in the ordinary—this is called \"illuminating through non-illumination.\"\n\nFrom \"things are not other than that\" to \"not one, not inexhaustible,\" he explains the phrase \"illuminating through non-illumination.\" From \"using the finger to illustrate the finger\" to \"attaining it and nearly succeeding,\" he explains the phrase \"because of this.\" Then, returning directly to this point, he concludes with \"this is called illuminating through non-illumination.\" The structure of the text rises and falls, shifting and turning, yet its guiding threads remain clear.\n\nI have often said that the *Qiwulun* is a single, unbroken piece of writing—if one examines its words and veins closely, one can see this. Now, suppose there is a statement here: how can one know whether it aligns with \"this\" or not? Whether it aligns with \"this\" or not, if both alignment and non-alignment are taken as \"this,\" then they are no different from \"that.\" This passage arises from the phrase \"not using this.\" Hence, he asks: does it align with \"this\"? Does it not align with \"this\"? This is the vein of his words. Earlier, he said, \"Words are not mere blowing,\" and here, shifting his tone, he declares: \"Now, suppose there is a statement here.\" This, too, is the vein running through the text. For if one swaps the positions of \"this\" and \"not this,\" one sees that \"this\" and \"not this\" are both \"this.\" His meaning is: if one takes \"that\" as \"this\" and \"this\" as \"that,\" one sees that \"this\" and \"that\" are the same. This is the meaning of \"using the finger to illustrate the finger, using the horse to illustrate the horse.\"\n\nThough this be so, let us attempt to speak of it. There is \"having a beginning\"; there is \"not yet having had a beginning\"; there is \"not yet having had that which has not yet had a beginning.\" There is \"having\"; there is \"non-being\"; there is \"not yet having had non-being\"; there is \"not yet having had that which has not yet had non-being.\" Suddenly, there is being and non-being—but who can truly say which is being and which is non-being? Now, I have already made a statement, yet I do not know whether what I have called it is truly a statement or truly not a statement.\n\nThough Zhuangzi’s prose here takes a turn, his words remain wondrous. His meaning is: though one may say there is no \"this\" and no \"that,\" let us still try to speak of it. Thus, he says: \"Let us attempt to speak of it.\" \"Having a beginning\" is the Supreme Ultimate; \"not yet having had a beginning\" is the Ultimate of Non-being; \"not yet having had that which has not yet had a beginning\" is yet another layer beyond the Ultimate of Non-being. \"Having\" is the existence of things. This arising of existence must begin from non-being, hence \"non-being.\" Above this \"non-being\" is \"not yet having had non-being,\" another layer beyond the Ultimate of Non-being. This aligns with what *Liezi* calls the Great Material, the Great Simplicity, and the Great Beginning. Originally, there was no \"having,\" and not only was there no \"having,\" there was not even \"non-being.\" Suddenly, there arose \"non-being,\" and from this, \"having\" must emerge. Pushing this reasoning forward, his meaning is: originally, there was nothing at all. Only with the arising of the self do things come to be; only with the arising of things does the self come to be, and only then do \"this\" and \"that\" emerge. The general thrust is no more than this, yet his exposition is so lofty and subtle.\n\nHere, it would be fitting to say, \"Suddenly, there is being,\" but instead, he says, \"Suddenly, there is being and non-being.\" This is where his brushwork enters the realm of the wondrous. Though this \"non-being\" has arisen, can it truly be called \"non-being\"? Thus, he asks: who can truly say which is being and which is non-being? Though this \"non-being\" remains unknowable, once it is called \"non-being,\" it has already acquired the name of non-being. Thus, he says: \"Now, I have already made a statement.\" Yet though I have made this statement—this \"speaking\"—I do not know whether this statement is truly a statement or truly not a statement. This is akin to the passage on the fledgling’s cry: \"Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; none is shorter-lived than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu is long-lived. Heaven and earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, how can there be speech? Yet since we have already called it 'one,' how can we say there is no speech?\"\n\nMoreover, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. From this onward, even the most skillful mathematician cannot reckon, let alone the common person. Thus, from non-being proceeding to being, reaching three—how much more so from being proceeding to being? There is no proceeding at all. This is simply following what is.\n\nThese two lines, though presented as an analogy to clarify the principle of being and non-being, express the ultimate truth of all under heaven. Before Zhuangzi, no one had spoken thus; after Zhuangzi, no one has spoken thus. Truly, this is a singular insight spanning centuries. The tip of an autumn hair is most minute, yet it is called \"nothing greater\"; Mount Tai is most vast, yet it is called \"small.\" The intent here is that once named \"autumn hair,\" even if slightly larger, it can no longer be called \"autumn hair.\" Once named \"Mount Tai,\" even if slightly smaller, it can no longer be called \"Mount Tai.\" If Mount Tai is deemed great, yet heaven and earth are greater, then calling Mount Tai \"small\" is permissible. If \"child who dies young\" is a name, it denotes the utmost brevity of life; any longer, and it is no longer called a \"child who dies young.\" Though Pengzu is said to be long-lived, compared to heaven and earth, he is short-lived.\n\nExamining these two lines closely, one sees that if something can be called \"completed,\" then even I am completed. If it cannot be called \"completed,\" then things and I are without completion. If one guards against viewing it thus, then, vast as heaven and earth are, born together with me in the great void, they cannot be called great. And the myriad things, born together with me between heaven and earth—even a single blade of grass, a single tree, a single bird, a single insect—are all equal to me. Thus it is said: \"Heaven and earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one.\" Having spoken of \"one,\" it then clings to this \"one,\" saying: \"Since we are already one, how can there be speech?\" The meaning is that if we are wholly undifferentiated as one, then even the word \"one\" should not exist. Yet since there is already the word \"one,\" how can it be said there is none? This undifferentiated \"one\" and this named \"one\" of speech are already two things. Thus, \"one and speech make two.\" Once there are these two, adding the phrase \"one and speech make two\" makes three. From these three, generation proceeds endlessly—from thousands to tens of thousands, from tens of thousands to trillions—until even the most skillful reckoner cannot exhaust them, let alone the common person.\n\nIf one views it thus, then initially, from the word \"non-being,\" speech arises, proceeding to being, from being to one, from one to two, from two to three. Once speech begins, how much more will being generate being without end? Observing this, only \"no proceeding\" is correct. What is meant by \"no proceeding\"? It is simply following what is.\n\nNow, the Dao has never had boundaries, and speech has never had constancy. To affirm \"this\" is to create divisions. Let us speak of these divisions: there is left and right, there are principles and duties, there are distinctions and debates, there are competitions and conflicts—these are called the eight virtues. This passage arises from the word \"this.\" Where there are boundaries, there is self and other; where there is constancy, there is a master. The ultimate Dao and ultimate speech originally have no self and other. It is due to the selfishness of the human heart that the word \"this\" arises, giving birth to many boundaries and divisions. The names of the eight virtues merely express the opposition of self and other, yet the text animates them with four pairs: left and right, opposing terms; principles (ethics) and duties (righteousness); distinctions and debates, both similar but with varying emphasis—once there is self and other, principles and affairs each have their own intent; competitions and conflicts, both of the same meaning, but competition is more intense than conflict. Once there are distinctions and debates, the greater must compete, and the lesser must contend.\n\nWhen reading such passages, if one merely skims the surface of the words, one may appear clever, but if one asks, \"What is ethics? What is duty? What is distinction? What is debate? What is competition? What is conflict?\"—then one has missed Zhuangzi’s intent. Moreover, the words for ethics, duty, distinction, debate, competition, and conflict have no great difference in themselves. How can they be named the \"eight virtues\"? Only by seeing through the text’s embellishments and not being confined by its rhetoric can one truly read Zhuangzi well. Even if Zhuangzi were to return to life, he would surely say, \"You possess a discerning eye.\"\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* embodies the intent of the former kings to order the world; the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, where there are distinctions, there are also non-distinctions; where there is debate, there are also non-debates. Why is this? The sage cherishes them in secret, while the common people debate them to display to one another. Thus, it is said: \"Where there is debate, there is also non-perception.\"\n\nHaving already spoken of self and other, right and wrong, these several lines introduce another perspective to reveal the boundless clarity and freedom in this old man’s heart. \"Beyond the six directions\" refers to beyond heaven and earth—what the Buddhists call the four directions, above and below, beyond thought. \"Within the six directions\" refers to the cosmos. Within the cosmos, there are many principles; how could the sage not speak of them? Yet he does not establish debates to force understanding upon all under heaven. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* is the name of a historical record; this line means that all matters of ruler and subject, high and low recorded in history embody the intent of the former kings to order the world. How could the sage not establish debates? Yet how could he contend with the world over right and wrong? For the principles of all under heaven, silence is the ultimate speech; once distinctions and debates arise, it is because one’s own understanding is not thorough. Thus, it is said: \"Where there are distinctions, there are also non-distinctions; where there is debate, there are also non-debates.\"\n\nHere, another question arises: \"Why is this?\" \"Cherishing them\" means withdrawing and concealing them in secrecy. The sage rolls them up and cherishes them, while the common people must debate and clarify them to boast and display. Where there are distinctions and debates, there is a lack of insight. Thus, it is said: \"Where there is debate, there is also non-perception.\"\n\nThe great Dao is not called great; great eloquence does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage is not aggressive. The Dao, when illuminated, is not the Dao; speech, when debated, does not reach; benevolence, when constant, is not complete; integrity, when pure, is not trustworthy; courage, when aggressive, is not accomplished. These five, though round, nearly approach squareness.\n\nThus, to know where to stop in what one does not know is the utmost. Who knows the eloquence of non-speech, the Dao of non-Dao? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Storehouse—poured into yet never full, drawn from yet never exhausted, and one knows not whence it comes. This is called preserving the light.\n\nTo those who would oppose it, it is said: if one names the great Dao, there are no oppositions. Within non-speech lies the most profound speech, hence it is said: \"Great eloquence does not speak.\" Only when no traces of benevolence remain does great benevolence arise. *Qian* (modesty) implies concealment—like a monkey hiding things, it is called *qian*. To take modesty as modesty is to harbor self-satisfaction. The *Guoyu* states: \"The virtue of *qianqian* is insufficient to achieve.\" Whether one fears others knowing or fears others not knowing, neither qualifies as great integrity.\n\n\"Not aggressive\" means no traces of courage are seen. Having explained these five phrases, another layer of interpretation follows: *Zhao* means illumination. The Dao cannot be pointed to and named; if it is illuminated and named, it is no longer the Dao. Thus, it is said: \"not the Dao.\" Speech, when shaped into debate, reveals where one’s understanding falls short. \"Constant\" refers to visible traces; where visible traces exist, benevolence is not fully realized. Integrity, when tainted by self-purification, is not sincere. *Qing* means self-purification; *xin* means sincerity. Courage, when manifested in aggression, must lose its true nature.\n\n\"Round\" means circular, indicating that these five are originally undifferentiated. If even slight traces appear, they approach the squareness of things—meaning they develop edges and corners. *Ji* means \"nearly\"; *xiang* shares the meaning of *yu* (toward).\n\nThe true knowledge of the world must reach the point where \"not knowing\" is knowing, and there it stops—this is the pinnacle of knowledge. \"Not knowing\" is the eloquence of non-speech; it is the Dao of non-Dao. If one can know this, one can perceive where Heaven’s principle is guarded. Thus, it is said: \"This is called the Heavenly Storehouse.\" The Heavenly Storehouse is where Heaven’s principle is guarded. Heaven’s principle cannot be added to, hence \"poured into yet never full\"; it cannot be diminished, hence \"drawn from yet never exhausted.\" The subtlety of the supreme principle has no end or beginning, thus \"one knows not whence it comes.\" *Baoguang* is the radiance of elusive brilliance—*bao* means to conceal, to hide one’s light without revealing it, hence \"preserving the light.\"\n\nThus, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I face south, I feel unsettled. What is the reason?\" Shun replied: \"Those three rulers still exist among the weeds and brambles. Why are you unsettled? In ancient times, ten suns appeared together, and all things were illuminated—how much more so for the advance of virtue?\" The word *zhe* (者) above \"in ancient times\" indicates this is cited from the preceding text.\n\nThe affairs of Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao are not recorded in the classics; they are likely allegorical. \"Unsettled\" means displeased. \"Among the weeds and brambles\" metaphorically describes being obscured by desires, unaware of heaven and earth. It suggests that those three states, self-obscured by desires, have not turned toward transformation, and if I feel displeased, then subject and object remain opposed. The tale of the ten suns also appears in the *Huainanzi*; this is likely a parable from Zhuangzi, which the *Huainanzi* later embellished. It means that the sun illuminates all things without exception—how much more should my virtue, surpassing the sun, tolerate these three? This implies that the sage’s refusal to debate right and wrong is to illuminate them with Heaven.\n\nThe saying of the ten suns is akin to the metaphor of \"illuminating with brightness.\" Nie Que asked Wang Ni: \"Do you know what all things agree upon as right?\" Wang Ni replied: \"How would I know?\" \"Do you know what you do not know?\" \"How would I know?\" \"Then do things have no knowledge?\" \"How would I know? Nevertheless, let me try to speak: How do I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing?\"\n\nThis passage arises from \"knowing where to stop in what one does not know,\" expanding upon the earlier \"is\" (*shi* 是). The entire essay is a single, continuous text. Nie Que’s question about agreement and Wang Ni’s response of not knowing exemplify knowing where to stop in what one does not know. The invented names and lively expressions are characteristic of Zhuangzi. Though he says, \"How would I know?\" he then adds, \"Nevertheless, let me try to speak\"—these are masterful turns of phrase. \"Knowing is not not-knowing; not-knowing is not knowing\" brilliantly develops the idea of knowing where to stop in what one does not know, for its meaning suggests that not-knowing is true knowledge.\n\nMoreover, let me ask you: When people sleep in damp places, they develop lower back pain and partial paralysis—is this so? When monkeys live in trees, they tremble with fear—is this so? Of these three, which knows the proper place to dwell? People eat the flesh of livestock; deer eat grass; centipedes delight in snakes; owls and crows relish mice. Of these four, which knows the proper taste? Monkeys and apes mate with female monkeys; deer consort with deer; loaches swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Li Ji are considered beautiful by people, yet when fish see them, they dive deep; when birds see them, they fly high; when deer see them, they flee swiftly. Of these four, which knows the true beauty of the world? From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I know their distinctions?\n\nMoreover, let me ask you...\n\nIs the loach at ease in water? Are the monkeys at ease in trees? How could people dwell in such places? Yet each finds ease in its own place of ease, and none can find ease in what is not its place of ease—thus, of these three, none truly knows the proper place. How then could humans be any different from apes or loaches?\n\nGrass and wood are the food of livestock, while meat is the food of humans. *Jian* is grass; *dai* is snake. Deer eat grass, centipedes eat snakes, owls and crows eat mice, and humans eat livestock—each finds its own taste sweet and fine, yet of these four, which truly knows the proper taste? *Biandan* and *gezang* are types of apes. Apes mate with apes, deer consort with deer, and loaches swim with fish. Yet when it comes to Mao Qiang and Li Ji, whom humans deem beautiful, fish dive deep at the sight of them, birds take flight, and deer flee swiftly. Of these four, which truly knows the world’s true beauty?\n\nSwift and sudden—such is their flight. These three passages all serve as metaphors for right and wrong, self and other, thus concluding: from my perspective, the distinctions of benevolence and righteousness, the debates of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could one possibly discern their order?\n\n*Fan* means entangled, *yao* means mixed. Nie Que said, \"If you do not know benefit and harm, does the perfected person truly not know benefit and harm?\" Wang Ni replied, \"The perfected person is divine. When great marshes burn, they cannot be scorched; when the Milky Way freezes, they cannot be chilled; when thunder splits mountains and winds shake the seas, they cannot be startled. Such a one rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Death and life bring no change to them—how much less the beginnings of benefit and harm?\" Wang Ni is the perfected person. *Divine* means their wonder pervades the ten thousand things without trace. Unscorched, unchilled, unstartled—this is to roam the mind in the beginning of nothingness. Even the great matters of death and life do not move their heart—how much less benefit, harm, right, and wrong? This sentence serves as a plain and solid conclusion.\n\nJu Quezi asked Chang Wuzi, \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue benefit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao, is without words yet speaks, speaks yet is without words, and roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered these reckless words, but I believe they describe the wondrous practice of the Dao. What do you think?\" Chang Wuzi replied, \"Even the Yellow Emperor would be perplexed by such words—how could Confucius possibly understand them?\"\n\nThis further raises the question of the sage, critiquing the scholars of the Confucian school who busy themselves with affairs. *Does not engage in affairs* means not taking them to heart. To *pursue* or *avoid* is to know benefit and harm—if one does not know benefit and harm, what is there to pursue or avoid? *Seeking* refers to things that come to me, yet the sage does not delight in them. *Does not follow the Dao* means leaving no trace of practice. *Without words yet speaks* and *speaks yet is without words* refer to speech that is not speech. *Menglang* means unreal. *The Master* refers to Confucius. To say that the sage’s affairs are spoken of as the wondrous Dao, yet Confucius deemed them unreal—what do you think? *You* here refers to Chang Wuzi. *Ying* means clarity. Only the Yellow Emperor could listen and attain clarity—how could Confucius understand?\n\n\"You are far too hasty in your judgments—seeing an egg and demanding the crowing of the rooster at dawn, seeing a slingshot and craving a roasted owl. Let me speak to you recklessly, and you may listen recklessly—how about that? Why not embrace the sun and moon, clasp the cosmos to your bosom, and make them fit seamlessly? Set aside the murky and turbid, and with *you* as the measure, treat others with deference. The common people toil endlessly, while the sage appears foolish and dull, merging the myriad ages into a single completion. The ten thousand things are all complete, yet they encompass one another.\n\n*Far too hasty in your judgments* means your words are like this, yet you already deem them the wondrous practice of the Dao—this is seeing little and thinking much. The rooster has not yet hatched from the egg, yet you demand its crowing at dawn; you have not yet obtained the owl, yet you crave it roasted—this is the metaphor of hasty judgment. *I speak to you recklessly, and you listen recklessly*—how about that? *Recklessly* means not taking it as entirely true. *Why not embrace the sun and moon*—*pang* means to attach. *Clasp the cosmos*—the cosmos is held in one’s embrace. *Fit seamlessly* means to merge without gaps, as if the principle is naturally one. *Murky* means turbid, *turbid* means obscure. The turbid and obscure *you* of the human world, with which people defer to one another, are all set aside and unspoken. Scholars defer to great officers, great officers defer to ministers, ministers defer to rulers—each defers to the other, yet all claim superiority. The common people are deluded by worldly affairs and toil endlessly, while the sage, with a mind that does not know, appears foolish and dull. *Merge* means to unite. The myriad ages are united into a single completion, and the ten thousand things are all complete, yet they encompass one another.\n\nUniting the myriad ages in a single vision—this principle admits no admixture, hence it is called \"a single completion, pure and undivided.\" That the ten thousand things are each complete in themselves means each thing is as it is in its own way. Yet all people harbor private intentions, and so between heaven and earth, from ancient times to the present, countless instances of \"this\" accumulate without end. Thus it is said: \"by 'this' they enfold one another.\" To enfold one another is to say they layer and press upon one another.\n\nHow do I know that delight in life is not delusion? How do I know that aversion to death is not a lost youth who knows not his way home? Li Ji, the daughter of the border guard Ai, when first taken by the state of Jin, wept until her tears soaked her collar. Yet once she reached the king’s palace and shared his carved couch, feasting on fine meats, she came to regret her tears. How do I know that the dead do not regret their initial longing for life? One who dreams of drinking wine may wake and weep; one who dreams of weeping may wake and hunt. In the midst of a dream, one does not know it is a dream—even within the dream, one may divine its meaning. Only upon waking does one know it was a dream. And only with the great awakening does one realize that all this was a great dream. Yet fools believe themselves awake, priding themselves on their keen discernment: \"Ah, the lord! Ah, the herdsman!\" How rigid! Confucius, you and I are both dreaming. When I say you are dreaming, I too am dreaming. Such words are called \"perverse consolation.\" Even ten thousand generations hence, should a great sage encounter them, it would be as if meeting in the space of a morning and evening.\n\nEarlier, the discussion arose from \"this\" and extended to the mutual enfolding of \"this.\" Now, returning to the earlier phrase, \"death and life undergo no change,\" it further clarifies the loss of one’s homeland.\n\nThe \"weak loss\" refers to one who departs from their homeland in youth. To linger long in a foreign land and forget one’s native country—those who delight in life and dread death are much the same. Lady Li was a consort of Duke Xian of Jin. Captured from the state of Lirong (Li being the name of the Rong lands), she was called \"Li’s Consort.\" The *feng ren* (guardian of the borderlands) was an official charged with defending the frontiers. At first, leaving the Rong lands to come to Jin, she wept in sorrow; but once she attained nobility, sharing the duke’s bed and table, she came to regret her earlier tears. This serves as an analogy for life and death.\n\n\"One who dreams of drinking wine wakes to weep; one who dreams of weeping wakes to hunt\"—such sayings appear frequently in dream-divination texts. Between dream and waking, transformations unfold thus: while dreaming, one does not know it is a dream, and may even divine its meaning within the dream. Only upon waking does one realize that both the dream and its interpretation were but dreams. Such passages subtly capture the marvels of human nature. If one grasps this, then the exchange between Wei Jie’s question and Le Guang’s answer is seen as not yet penetrating deeply. This, too, is a matter of great consequence in learning. If Le Guang’s explanation holds, then what of King Gaozong’s dream of obtaining Fu Shuo, or Confucius’ dream of the Duke of Zhou? The \"great awakening\" is the vision of the Dao—what Chan Buddhists call the \"great enlightenment.\" As for \"lord,\" it signifies nobility.\n\nThe herdsman and groom are lowly, yet the foolish man in the world, still dreaming, clings desperately to his sense of noble and base—is this not a profound delusion? That furtive, narrow vision—all I say to you now lies within the dream. Even my present words, calling you a dreamer, are but dream-speech. This idea suggests that the world is but an empty dream, though its patterns shift in wondrous, even eerie transformations.\n\nMy words here may seem utterly strange, yet within this strangeness lies the most subtle principle. Should a great sage arise ten thousand generations hence and grasp these insights of mine, it would be as if we met in the span of a single dawn and dusk. This is also what later ages mean when they say: \"If there must be a Yang Xiong, he will understand me.\" Such is the mutual recognition of vision.\n\nNow, suppose you and I debate: if you prevail over me, does that mean I am wrong and you are right? Or if I prevail over you, does that mean you are wrong and I am right? Or perhaps one of us is right, or one of us is wrong? Or perhaps both are right, or both are wrong? You and I cannot know for certain. Then all people are shrouded in obscurity—whom shall we ask to set things right?\n\nIf we seek one who agrees with you to arbitrate, since he already agrees with you, how can he set things right? If we seek one who agrees with me, since he already agrees with me, how can he set things aright? If we seek one who differs from both you and me, since he differs from us, how can he set things right? If we seek one who agrees with both you and me, since he agrees with us, how can he set things right? You are one, I am another, and this third person is yet another—three who cannot know one another. We must await another beyond us.\n\nThis \"another\" is the workings of creation, the \"Heavenly Boundary.\"\n\nThe \"Heavenly Boundary\" is the earlier \"Heavenly Equilibrium.\" What does it mean to harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary? It means: \"Is it so? Is it not so? So or not so?\" If something is truly so, then how does it differ from not being so? There would be no need for debate. If something is truly so, then how does it differ from not being so? Again, there would be no need for debate. The mutual dependence of transformative voices—if they do not oppose one another, they harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary, following it in boundless unfolding, thus exhausting the years. Forgetting the years, forgetting righteousness, one rouses oneself in the boundless—thus dwelling in the boundless. This is the boundary of distinction, the Heavenly Boundary. The reason it harmonizes is simply this: \"is\" and \"is not,\" \"so\" and \"not so\"—both are preserved. This is the earlier \"walking two paths.\" The moment one takes something to be so, the moment one takes it to be right, then \"not so\" and \"not right\" arise, giving rise to disputes over right and wrong. These are mere words—transformative voices, meaning the use of language to persuade and submit. \"Mutual dependence\" means opposition, contention. If, in the midst of disputes over right and wrong, one stubbornly pits language against itself to seek persuasion, how is this like following what is so without contention? Thus it is said: \"if they do not oppose one another.\" These two characters, \"do not oppose,\" are most extraordinary—\"if they\" is akin to saying \"how is it like?\" Without opposition yet in accord, this is harmonizing with the Heavenly Boundary. One may roam freely, exhausting the years—thus it is said: \"following it in boundless unfolding, thus exhausting the years.\" \"Following\" means yielding; \"boundless unfolding\" means wandering freely. \"Exhausting the years\" is like Du Fu’s \"carefree passage of days and months.\" If one can do this, then not only can one exhaust the years, but one may even forget them. Not only forget the years, but even forget principles and righteousness. Having forgotten years and righteousness, one stirs and dances in the realm of nothingness—this \"stirs\" is the meaning of \"free and easy wandering.\" Wandering freely in the realm of nothingness, one’s entire life is then lodged in the realm of nothingness.\n\nThe shadow’s companion asked the shadow: \"Earlier you were moving, now you are still; earlier you were sitting, now you are rising—why are you so without constancy?\" The shadow replied: \"Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada? How would I know why it is so? How would I know why it is not so?\" This passage arises from the word \"depend.\" The shadow’s companion is the faintest part of the shadow, without constancy—meaning it has no fixed measure. \"Do I depend on something to be thus?\" refers to the shadow’s movement, which depends on the form. Though I depend on the form, the form itself depends on something else—this is depending on the workings of creation. The form as form is no more than the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada. Do I merely depend on them? The cicada and snake transform, yet their scales and wings remain—this is their molting. How can they move on their own? Since I depend on the form, and the form depends on something else, how can I know why it is so or not so? This is the metaphor for \"not depending on that.\"\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering happily—a butterfly indeed. He took pleasure in it, unaware that he was Zhou.\n\nSuddenly awake, he was Zhuang Zhou again—stiff and startled. Did Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things.\n\nThis passage arises from the earlier dream sequence: the fluttering of the butterfly, the self-delight, the joy of following one’s will. In the dream, as the butterfly, he was so utterly content that he forgot his own self—hence \"unaware that he was Zhou.\" *Qúqú* describes the rigidity of waking, the sensation of lying stiff upon the bed. Here, the brushstrokes of Zhuangzi’s prose depict Zhou’s realization: last night’s butterfly was but a dream, yet now he fears the butterfly, over there, might take this waking moment for its own dream. Thus he asks: Did Zhou dream of the butterfly, or did the butterfly dream of Zhou? Between dream and waking, there must be a boundary—hence \"between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction.\" This line seems to conclude yet does not, leaving the matter unresolved, much like a Chan *huatou*, inviting the reader to investigate for themselves.\n\nThis is called the transformation of things—referring to the principle of the myriad things’ ceaseless change. The title of this chapter, \"Discourse on Making All Things Equal,\" culminates in these two metaphors, their language extraordinary, their meaning profound. One who awakens to this truth sees that there is no ground for disputing right and wrong, no change in life and death, let alone the entanglements of gain and loss. The opening and closing resonate like a dammed river suddenly released, like linked rings that do not touch—an unbroken yet discontinuous flow, a single sweep of brushwork rising and falling. Read with clarity, it yields boundless flavor. *Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll One.\n\n**Zhuangzi Kouyi, Scroll Two**\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n\n**Third Inner Chapter: \"Nurturing the Life-Foundation\"**\n*\"Master\" here is akin to what Chan calls the \"host within\"; \"nurturing the master\" refers to what Daoists call the \"elixir foundation\" of this life.* First, the joy of roaming freely is spoken of; then, the state of being without right or wrong—this is the work of cultivating oneself. These three chapters seem to follow a sequence, yet what follows does not entirely adhere to it.\n\n*\"Our life has its limits, but knowledge is without bounds. To pursue the boundless with the bounded is perilous. And to be perilous in this pursuit—is this not danger enough?*\n*Limits* (涯) means boundaries; human life has its boundaries, its finite limits. *Knowledge* (知) is thought, the endless workings of the mind. To follow boundless thought with a finite body—endlessly restless, when will it cease? *Perilous* (殆已) speaks of its dreadfulness; *已* is a particle. The following *已* echoes the previous one, as in the *\"Equalizing Things\"* chapter. Amidst this peril, one still employs thought and calculation, believing oneself to be wise and capable—yet I see only that it ends in peril. The repetition of *殆* (peril) further emphasizes this, deeply warning later generations. This *殆* is the same as the *\"only peril\"* in the *Book of Documents*. *已而为知者* is like saying, \"clearly knowing, thus acting deliberately.\"\n\n*\"In doing good, avoid proximity to fame; in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment. Follow the central path as your guiding principle—thus can you preserve your body, fulfill your life, nurture your kin, and live out your years.\"*\nThese lines precisely expound Zhuangzi’s teachings on nurturing life, his own way of self-cultivation. *\"In doing good, avoid proximity to fame\"* means that if one acts virtuously yet avoids deeds that attract renown; *\"in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment\"* means that if one commits wrongs, one avoids acts that incur penalties—this aligns with the *\"Webbed Toes\"* chapter’s *\"above, one dares not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness; below, one dares not engage in licentious and deviant acts.\"* *Supervisor* (督) means *urgency*—that is, responding only when pressed, acting only when unavoidable. Roaming the mind through this world, leaving no trace of good or evil, one simply follows the natural course of Heaven. Pressed, one responds; response arises without deliberation—this is the constant way. *Following* (缘) means compliance; *principle* (经) means constancy. Taking the meaning of *\"responding only when pressed\"* as one’s constant practice, one can preserve the body, fulfill the principle of life, filially nurture one’s parents, and live out one’s natural span—this is what Mencius meant by *\"whether long or short-lived, one does not waver, but cultivates oneself and awaits [Heaven’s decree].\"* Mencius speaks from the perspective of mind and nature, thus appearing solemn; this book speaks from the perspective of spontaneity, thus appearing carefree. Though their words differ, their intent in teaching people is the same.\n\nMaster Hui’an (Zhu Xi) glosses *督* as *\"center\"* but finds the phrasing of *\"avoid proximity to fame\"* and *\"avoid proximity to punishment\"* incomplete. He says: *\"If one fears the entanglements of fame and dares not fully exert one’s efforts in learning, one inclines toward evil. 'In doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment' suggests choosing evils that do not lead to criminal penalties, secretly committing them, and cunningly avoiding the consequences of punishment—this would make Zhuangzi a man of unscrupulousness.\"* Yet if one examines Zhuangzi’s phrasing and cross-references it with the *\"Webbed Toes\"* chapter, this interpretation does not hold. Though *督* can be glossed as *\"center,\"* it is better rendered as *\"urgency\"*—this aligns more precisely with the evidence in the text itself.\n\n*Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, where his shoulder leaned, where his foot stepped, where his knee pressed—all resounded with a crisp* 砉然 *and a smooth* 向然*. The blade sang* 騞然*, never failing to strike the right note, harmonizing with the dance of* Sanglin *and the rhythm of* Jingshou*.*\n*\"Ah!\" exclaimed Lord Wenhui, \"How excellent! How has your skill reached such heights?\"*\n*\"Where his hand touched\"* describes the movement of his hand; *\"where his shoulder leaned\"* refers to the tilt of his shoulder when applying force. *\"Where his foot stepped\"* describes the stance of his feet as he exerted himself, their placement naturally spaced. *\"Where his knee pressed\"* means his knees bent slightly as he leaned into the ox. These four lines depict the posture of a butcher at work. *砉然* (a crisp sound), *向然* (a smooth sound), and *騞然* (a ringing sound) all describe the sounds of his knife, with *\"wielding the blade\"* (奏刀) inserted in between—a matter of literary structure. This is like the *\"Seventh Month\"* poem: *\"In the eighth month, in the wilds; in the ninth month, at the eaves; in the tenth month, the crickets are beneath my bed\"*—where *\"crickets\"* is inserted in the middle. *奏刀* means advancing the blade; *\"never failing to strike the right note\"* means the sounds of *砉*, *向*, and *騞* all accorded with the musical modes. *Sanglin* and *Jingshou* are names of music; *dance* implies accompanying music, and *rhythm* (防) refers to the gathering of dancers. *\"Harmonizing with Sanglin\"* and *\"striking the rhythm of Jingshou\"* both describe how his movements matched the musical modes. *Lord Wenhui* is Lord Hui of Liang. *\"Ah!\"* is an exclamation of admiration.\n\nThe skill has reached such heights—these words describe its marvel. Butcher Ding laid down his knife and replied: \"What your servant delights in is the Dao, which advances beyond mere skill. When I first began to dismember oxen, all I saw was nothing but oxen. After three years, I no longer saw whole oxen. To lay down the knife means to set it aside; that he spoke after setting it aside suggests his skill arose from learning the Dao, and thus his skill was no mere skill. After three years, he no longer saw whole oxen—this means that in the ox’s body, the places where it could be dismembered required no force and could be perceived at a glance.\n\nNowadays, I meet with it in spirit rather than seeing with my eyes; the senses’ knowing ceases, and the spirit’s desires proceed. I rely on the heavenly patterns, strike the great gaps, guide the blade through the great cavities, and follow what is inherently so. I have never touched the technical pathways or the binding joints—how much less the great bones! To meet with it in spirit rather than seeing with my eyes means the mind guards against it; *meeting* here means *guarding*. The senses are the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. That the senses’ knowing ceases means that when one stands in concentration, the ears and eyes perceive nothing. The knowing of the ears and eyes all ceases and does not proceed, while the spirit moves of itself—this means naturally and spontaneously. The *heavenly patterns* are the ox’s body’s natural textures. *Relying* means following its natural textures to dismember it. The *great gaps* are where flesh and bone meet; *striking* means to strike. The *cavities* are the great empty spaces between the joints; *guiding* means to follow and dismember. Where flesh and bone meet, where the joints have empty spaces—all are inherently so, and I merely follow them to dismember. In my skill, when using the knife, I have never once touched the binding joints. *Binding joints* (綮) is pronounced *qing*; they are where flesh adheres to bone. If even the binding joints are untouched by the knife, how much less the great bones! *Great bones* (軱) is pronounced *gū*.\n\nA good butcher changes his knife once a year—he cuts. An ordinary butcher changes his knife every month—he breaks it. Now my knife has been in use for nineteen years, having dismembered several thousand oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. A *good butcher* is one skilled in butchery; an *ordinary butcher* is one among the common crowd, an inferior one. Inferior butchers change their knives every month because hacking at great bones damages or even breaks them. Good butchers change their knives once a year because their use of the knife still touches the binding joints, and cutting there may wear it down. But my knife has been in use for nineteen years, and though I have dismembered many oxen, its edge remains as if newly sharpened—this means it has suffered no damage. *Whetstone* (硎) is a grinding stone.\n\nWhere the joints have spaces and the knife’s edge has no thickness, to enter what has no thickness into what has spaces—how vast is the room for the blade to move! Thus, after nineteen years, the knife’s edge is as if newly whetted. *Where the joints have spaces* means the ox’s joints naturally have gaps; my knife is extremely thin. With such a thin knife, following the gaps to dismember, the blade can move freely within them. *How vast is the room* means there is no obstruction. This idea suggests that the difficulty or ease of worldly affairs all follows natural patterns. If I merely follow and proceed without clashing against them, my mind remains at peace, and thus nothing can harm my life—this is the method of nourishing life.\n\nYet whenever I come to where the sinews and bones are clustered, I see the difficulty and am startled into caution. My gaze lingers, my actions slow, and I move the knife with utmost care. Then, with a sudden *thwack*, it is dismembered, collapsing like earth to the ground. I raise the knife and stand, looking all around, then pause in satisfaction, wipe the knife clean, and put it away.\" Lord Wenhui said, \"Excellent! From Butcher Ding’s words, I have learned how to nourish life.\"\n\nThis *yet* is a turn with profound meaning. It suggests that in navigating the world, one cannot always encounter smooth circumstances; there are also times when adversity arises. One must then adapt and proceed with flexibility. In favorable circumstances, it is easy to act, but when facing adversity, one often becomes flustered and loses composure—how can one’s mind remain undisturbed?\n\nThus, this turn is added: *clustered* (族) means where sinews and bones gather. Though I say I no longer see whole oxen with my eyes, and though I use the knife only at the great gaps and cavities, when I come to where sinews and bones are tangled, I still find it difficult, treating it as a challenge. *Startled* (怵然) means a change in demeanor; *caution* means heightened vigilance. *My gaze lingers* means that with my eyes, I cannot help but pause briefly before proceeding slowly. *My actions slow* means I proceed with great care. Once I have taken care, I move the knife with utmost subtlety—this means lightly, without daring to apply much force. *Thwack* (謋) is pronounced *tè*; *dismembered* (解) is pronounced *xiè*. *Thwack* suggests suddenness; *dismembered* means to come apart. Though I apply little force, the bones and flesh suddenly separate, collapsing like earth to the ground—this means it is abundant and easy. After dismembering the ox, I raise the knife and stand, looking all around in leisure. *Pausing* (踌躇) means composure; it also means self-satisfaction. *Satisfaction* (满志) means contentment.\n\nIt is not that his ambition is self-satisfied; rather, this means it fulfills my intent. Why is it as desired? Because I use no force in dismembering the ox, and though the ox is dismembered, the knife remains unharmed—this is why it is as desired. *\"To care for the knife\"* means to carefully put it away. This idea is a metaphor: when a person encounters adversity, they can respond with natural ease, keeping their mind undisturbed. Once the matter passes, they transform, and their body rests in non-action, as if nothing had ever occurred.\n\nThe following section, *\"To do good without seeking fame,\"* directly expounds the method of nurturing life. The passage about Pao Ding serves as its analogy, and here, at the end, it lightly concludes with *\"thus attaining the nurturing of life\"*—these four characters are where the momentum of the text is skillfully controlled, a point that must be examined closely.\n\nGongwen Xuan saw the Right Minister and was startled, saying: *\"What sort of man is this? Why is he so singular?\"* *\"Was this given by Heaven, or by man?\"* *\"By Heaven, not by man.\"* *\"Heaven’s creation made him thus, solitary; human appearance is shared, yet his is not. From this, we know it is Heaven’s doing, not man’s.\"*\n\nGongwen was his surname, Xuan his given name. The Right Minister was an official who had been punished by foot amputation. *\"Singular\"* (介) means alone; he retained only one foot. *\"Given by Heaven or by man?\"* means: was he born this way, or was he mutilated by man? Though the loss of a foot was clearly man’s doing, he said it was Heaven, not man. *\"Heaven’s creation made him thus, solitary\"* means that when Heaven created him, it intended for him to have only one foot. How do we know this? Because human appearance typically involves two feet walking side by side, yet his form stands apart from the multitude—this is Heaven’s design, not man’s. *\"Shared\"* (与) means paired. This idea suggests that in the world, excess and deficiency are all the work of creation; even what man does is ultimately the work of creation. Thus, when people encounter hardship, they should accept it with equanimity.\n\nThe marsh pheasant takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink. It does not wish to be kept in a cage; though its spirit may flourish, it is not content. The earlier discussion of accepting hardship with equanimity is like Pao Ding’s *\"each time I encounter a joint, I see the difficulty\"*—here, these lines borrow the marsh pheasant as a metaphor. They speak of human life in the world, where adversity is common, akin to treading on a tiger’s tail or walking within Yi’s drawn bow. The pheasant in the marsh takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink—this describes the difficulty of its sustenance. If kept in a cage, its food and drink would be abundant, yet the pheasant does not desire this. Thus, it is said: *\"It does not wish to be kept in a cage.\"* Why does it not wish this? Though the caged pheasant’s food and drink are plentiful, and its spirit may seem to flourish, it is ultimately not at ease. *\"Though its spirit may flourish, it is not content\"*—*\"flourish\"* is pronounced *wang*; *\"not content\"* means not joyful. This idea suggests that one who truly cherishes their life will not drown in the mundane world but will instead preserve their own integrity.\n\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi mourned him. After three cries, he departed. A disciple said: *\"Was he not your master’s friend?\"* *\"He was.\"* *\"Then is this manner of mourning acceptable?\"*\n\nHe replied: \"Indeed. At first, I took him for a true man, but now I see he was not. When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own sons, and the young weeping as if for their own mothers. The reason they restrained themselves to speak or weep only when compelled was to flee from Heaven and betray their true nature, forgetting what they had received. The ancients called this 'the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.' Zhuangzi’s teachings derive from Laozi, and here he first disparages Laozi—this is but the groundwork for disparaging Yao, Shun, and the Confucians. As for me, I hold no partiality toward Laozi, let alone others.\n\n\"Three cries and then departure—this was an expression of unfeeling conduct. The disciple’s question implied that Laozi and Qin Shi were friends, so why did he mourn so unfeelingly? My answer refers to Qin Shi. 'At first, I took him for a true man'—I initially believed Laozi to be an extraordinary person. But upon offering condolences, I realized he was not. Why? When Laozi died, his disciples, young and old alike, wept with such sorrow. This must mean Laozi had not shed his worldly traces, and something in him moved his disciples’ hearts, so that their words and tears of grief and longing arose unbidden. What Heaven bestows is originally formless, yet if one is moved by emotion, it is to forget one’s original endowment and flee from Heaven’s principle, betraying one’s true nature. Such a one offends against Heaven, hence the term 'the punishment of fleeing from Heaven'—*bei* means 'to betray.'\n\n\"To come when it is time and to depart when it is fitting—this is to dwell in accord with the times and follow their course, so that sorrow and joy cannot enter. The ancients called this 'the untying of Heaven’s bonds.' Having discussed Qin Shi’s conduct, I now clarify the principle of fully embracing life and death, concluding the chapter. The aim is for people to understand that what arises naturally should not disturb their hearts in matters of life and death, for only then can one nurture life. *Fuzi* is a term of respect for a man of the Dao. It means that among those with the Dao between Heaven and Earth, their coming is timely, and their going is fitting. One should simply follow the times and accord with them. Knowing that their coming and going are timely, one neither rejoices at arrival nor grieves at departure—this is what it means for sorrow and joy to 'not enter.' *Xuan* means the heart is bound; *Di* means Heaven. To know the naturalness of Heaven’s principle is to prevent Heaven from binding one with life and death. Though it be Heaven, it cannot constrain me—hence the term 'the untying of Heaven’s bonds.'\n\n\"A finger pointing to the firewood cannot exhaust the fire’s blaze—this is a metaphor for life and death. If you observe the firewood, it has a limit, but the fire in the world has been passed down from ancient times to the present without end. These three lines are a marvel of expression. The principle of life and death cannot be fully captured in words, yet in discussing the text, the preceding argument is concluded with this metaphor—is this not the most exquisite part of the writing?\n\n*Inner Chapters, \"The Human World,\" Chapter Four*\nThe previous section spoke of nurturing life; this one speaks of the human world. It means that once one has this body and dwells in this world, how can one completely sever human affairs? The key is to navigate them well. With such an understanding, how can Zhuangzi be called impractical? How can he be said to disregard human affairs? This aligns with the meaning of the Outer Chapters: 'Nothing is worth doing, yet nothing can be left undone.'\n\nYan Hui sought an audience with Confucius and asked to depart, saying: \"Where are you going?\" \"I intend to go to Wei.\" \"What will you do there?\" \"I have heard that the lord of Wei is young in years and acts alone. He governs his state lightly yet does not perceive his errors, and he treats the people’s lives as of little worth. The dead are measured by the state as if they were reeds in a marsh—how can the people endure this?\" *His years are young, his conduct solitary*—this means he is young and self-willed, heedless of others’ counsel. *He governs his state lightly yet does not perceive his errors*—he misuses his state without recognizing his faults. *He treats the people’s lives as of little worth*—he harms and slaughters them. *The dead are measured by the state as if they were reeds in a marsh*—he treats the people as lightly as grass. Xunzi’s *Enriching the State* says: \"measured by the marsh,\" which shares this meaning. Here, the phrase is inverted to \"as if reeds in a marsh\"—this is a marvel of composition. *Yun* means marsh, as in *Yunmeng*; in ancient times, it was all water, but now there is land to till. It is not called *Yunmeng soil* but *Yun soil, Meng land*—this is a literary technique. Similarly, *xuan* means fine silk, as does *kuang*; it is not called *xuankuang* but *xuan kuang*—another example of this technique. *How can the people endure this?*—it means they have nowhere to turn.\n\nHui had heard from the Master: \"Where there is order, leave; where there is chaos, go—this is the teaching of the sages.\" But Zhuangzi reverses this, saying: \"Where there is order, leave; where there is chaos, go.\" It is like a physician who can only practice when there are many illnesses. If a state is already well-governed, what need is there for me? *I wish to apply what I have heard and consider its principles*—this means he wishes to convey to the lord of Wei what he has heard from the Master, so that the lord might reflect on these principles and reform, perhaps bringing peace to his state.\n\nConfucius said: \"Alas! You will likely go and be punished. The Dao does not tolerate杂乱;杂乱 leads to excess, excess to disturbance, disturbance to anxiety, and anxiety to ruin. The utmost man first establishes himself before establishing others. If what is established in oneself is not secure, how can one attend to the conduct of violent men? Moreover, do you know what causes virtue to dissipate and knowledge to arise? Virtue dissipates for the sake of fame, and knowledge arises from contention. Fame is what people vie over, and knowledge is the tool of contention—both are inauspicious instruments, not the means to perfect conduct. Furthermore, if one’s virtue is profound and trust is firm, yet one’s *qi* does not reach others; if one’s fame is heard but not contended for, yet one forcibly imposes the language of benevolence, righteousness, rules, and techniques upon violent men, this is to make others resent what one considers beautiful. This is called 'bringing disaster upon others.' One who brings disaster upon others will have disaster reflected back upon them. You will likely bring disaster upon yourself.\n\n*Where there is the Dao, appear; where there is no Dao, hide*—this is the teaching of the sages. But Zhuangzi reverses this, saying: \"Where there is order, leave; where there is chaos, go.\" It means that if one can heal, one should do so only when there are many illnesses. If a state is already well-ordered, what use is there for me? *I wish to apply what I have heard and consider its principles*—he wishes to convey to the lord of Wei what he has heard from the Master, so that the lord might reflect on these principles and reform, perhaps bringing peace to his state.\"\n\nYou are perilously close to becoming one who will be executed—if you go there like this, you will only be put to death by them. It is better not to go.\n\nThe Dao does not desire杂: when this heart is unadulterated, it is pure, unified, empty, and luminous. If one harbors thoughts—considering how they are and how one might save them—this is already \"harboring the heart,\" and within me, it is already杂. If I am not pure and unified, how can I save them?\n\n杂 then 多: \"many\" refers to being scattered in many directions. 扰 means \"chaos,\" and 忧 means \"self-torment.\" You are tormenting yourself—how can you save others? The ancients first established what was within themselves before admonishing others. If what is within me is not settled, how can I attend to others? Though their conduct is violent and wicked, I am tormenting myself—how can I attend to others?\n\nVirtue arises naturally. 知 is private cunning. The moment one harbors a desire for fame, one’s natural virtue is already lost. The moment one employs private cunning, contention arises. Thus it is said: virtue is lost through fame and cunning, and contention emerges from them.\n\n争相轧 means \"to overthrow one another.\" 争之器 refers to the tools of contention: if I use private cunning, they too will use private cunning, and the struggle will never cease. Fame and cunning are the most perilous affairs under heaven—if one insists on pursuing them, calamity is inevitable.\n\n矼 means \"thick,\" and 厚德 is \"substantial virtue.\" 厚信 means \"truly trustworthy conduct.\" Though I possess virtue and trustworthiness, if I do not understand their nature and qi, and though I may have a fine reputation and renown, if I do not comprehend their hearts—if I forcibly present the language of benevolence, righteousness, and legal standards before violent and wicked people—they will resent what you consider beautiful.\n\n绳墨 refers to legal standards, and 术 is synonymous with 述. 菑人 means \"one who brings disaster.\" They will surely call you a \"disaster-bringer,\" and once this name is given, disaster will reflect back upon you. If you go now, you will likely bring disaster upon yourself—how can you transform the lord of Wei and save his state?\n\nMoreover, if one merely delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, what need is there to seek distinction? If you do not await the summons of kings and lords, they will surely take advantage of you, contend for victory, and your eyes will flicker in distress, your complexion will flatten in submission, your mouth will stammer in defense, your demeanor will reveal fear, and your heart will yield to compliance.\n\nThis is like using fire to fight fire, water to fight water—it is called \"adding more.\" Following this path without end, if you persist in speaking earnestly to those who do not trust you, you will surely die before violent men.\n\nIf they truly knew the worthy and delighted in them, knew the unworthy and despised them, what need would there be for me to seek further distinction? It is precisely because they do not distinguish between worthy and unworthy that they act as they do. If they do not recognize worthiness, how will they know you are worthy and trust your words?\n\n诏 means \"summons.\" 若汝 refers to you. The lord of Wei has not summoned you, so if you go uninvited, he, as a lord, will surely take advantage of your words to contend for victory. When you are thus cornered, your eyes will flicker in distress, your complexion will flatten in submission, your mouth will stammer in defense, your demeanor will reveal fear, and your heart will yield to compliance.\n\nEmperor Wu of Liang’s debate with He Chen perfectly illustrates this pattern—it speaks of contention that ends in defeat and self-submission. If the other party is violent and gains the upper hand, their momentum will only grow stronger, like using water to fight water or fire to fight fire—only adding more.\n\nThe phrase \"益多\" refers to the multiplication of their evil. If you follow this path, their wickedness will grow boundless, and their violence and tyranny will only intensify. \"厚言\" means to speak deeply or excessively. If you have not yet earned others' trust and yet, with your untrustworthy self, speak at length before a violent man, you will surely be killed by him.\n\nConsider the past: Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both were men who cultivated themselves, humbled themselves to care for the people, and thus opposed their superiors. Their rulers, seizing upon their cultivation, cast them out—such are those who covet reputation. In ancient times, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu'ao, and Yu attacked the state of Youhu. Their lands were laid waste, their bodies executed, their warfare unceasing, their pursuit of substance insatiable—all were seekers of fame and gain. Have you not heard of this? Fame and substance are things even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can one like you?\n\nGuan Longfeng and Bigan cultivated themselves and admonished out of love for the people, not realizing that the people were not their own. You, however, lower yourself to care for them—\"伛拊\" means to cherish and nurture. Jie and Zhou did not love the people, yet you love the people of Jie and Zhou. This is opposing one's superior, and thus they were killed. Their cultivation of goodness was used against them, provoking anger—this is the fault of those who crave reputation.\n\nCongzhi, Xu'ao, and Youhu are allegorical states, reduced to ruins, their dead becoming vengeful spirits—\"厉\" refers to those without descendants or refuge. The reason these states met such disaster was their unceasing warfare in pursuit of fame and substance. \"实\" means profit. \"不能胜\" means unable to endure. Those who seek fame and self-interest—even Yao and Yu could not endure it, leading to the destruction of their states—how much less can you?\n\n\"胜\" is read as *shēng*. Yao and Yu did not actually do these things; they are allegories. Nevertheless, if you must have a method, I once spoke of this to Yan Hui: \"Be upright yet empty, strive yet unified—would this suffice?\" He replied, \"How could it be so simple? To present yang as fullness, to display shifting colors—this is what ordinary people do not resist. They follow others' inclinations to seek favor, and their hearts are named 'the virtue of gradual encroachment.' If even this is not achieved, how much less can great virtue be? They cling rigidly without transformation, outwardly compliant yet inwardly unyielding—how can this be sufficient?\"\n\nThis is another turn: if you insist on going, you must have a purpose for doing so.\n\nMoreover, let me put it to the test—this is but an attempt at discourse, an aid to conversation. \"Be upright yet empty\" means to rectify your person while keeping your mind open and vast. \"Strive yet unified\" means to exert yourself diligently, ever consistent from beginning to end. If you can do this, is it sufficient? \"How could it be so simple?\"—this is to say, it is far from sufficient.\n\n\"To present yang as fullness, to display shifting colors\"—this describes those who, having attained success, are filled with yang qi, their demeanor swelling with self-satisfaction, their bearing exceedingly proud. \"Shifting colors\" refers to their haughty expressions, which never settle. Ordinary people dare not oppose them, instead yielding and deferring out of fear. Seeing that everyone fears them, if you seek to move them with words, they will only demand that you submit to their will to gratify their desires. Thus it is said: \"to seek favor,\" for their hearts delight in such compliance. This is called \"the virtue of gradual encroachment.\" If even this petty virtue cannot be achieved, how much less can great virtue?\n\n\"Clinging rigidly without transformation\"—this means obstinately refusing to change. If you act thus, outwardly you may feign uprightness and emptiness to conform to others, but inwardly you cling to your \"striving yet unified\" resolve, believing yourself free of fault. How can this be deemed sufficient? If, however, you are inwardly straight and outwardly yielding, achieving harmony with what is above—then \"inwardly straight\" means guarding this principle within, preserving your true nature. This \"straightness\" resembles \"truth.\" From the nobility of the Son of Heaven down to yourself, all are children of Heaven, all arising from the natural. How dare you, with your own words, seek to make others approve of what you deem right and disapprove of what you deem wrong? Without this self-serving heart, you remain as guileless as a child, thus merging with Heaven. This is called \"being a companion to Heaven.\"\n\n\"Outwardly yielding\" means fully observing the rites of bowing, kneeling, and prostrating—acts of ministerial deference. If everyone does this, why should I alone refuse? To do what others do is to avoid their censure. This is called \"being a companion to man.\" \"Achieving harmony with what is above\" means aligning with the ancients, becoming their companion. Though your words may seem to instruct or rebuke, they are in truth the sayings of the ancients, not your own. If so, even blunt honesty will not be faulted. This is called \"being a companion to the ancients.\" If you act thus, is it sufficient?\n\nYet if you descend further, consider Yan Hui’s reply, divided into three parts:\n\n\"Inwardly straight\" means inwardly preserving this principle, guarding your true nature. From the exalted Son of Heaven to yourself, all are born of Heaven, all arise naturally. How dare you, with your own words, seek to make others approve of your rightness and disapprove of your wrongness? Without this self-serving heart, you remain as pure as a child, thus merging with Heaven. Hence, it is said: \"being a companion to Heaven.\"\n\n\"Outwardly yielding\" means fully performing the rites of bowing, kneeling, and prostrating—acts everyone observes. If I too observe them, others will find no fault in me. Though this may seem to follow the crowd, such compliance arises from humility. These discussions mock the sagely gate with such reasoning, yet they align with others. Hence, it is said: \"being a companion to man.\"\n\n\"Achieving\" refers to your own established doctrines. \"Harmony with what is above\" means aligning your doctrines with the ancients, citing them as evidence. Though you borrow the ancients' teachings, your words are direct rebukes, yet because they are not your own, even bluntness incurs no blame. This is called \"being a companion to the ancients.\" If you act thus, is it sufficient?\n\nConfucius said: \"How could it be so simple? Too many policies and methods, yet no tranquility—though steadfast, you remain blameless, yet this is all it amounts to. How can it extend to transformation? You are still guided by your own mind.\" \"Policies\" refer to affairs of governance; \"methods\" to their implementation. Your words propose too many measures, yet they never settle into peace. Though you may achieve these three things and remain blameless, this only spares you from fault—how can it transform others? Thus it is said: \"How can it extend to transformation?\" Where lies the flaw? In your three doctrines, you are still guided by a mind of deliberate action, still harboring intentions, still leaving traces—far from the natural Dao.\n\nYan Hui said: \"I have no further progress to make. May I ask the method?\" Confucius replied: \"Fast, and I will tell you. If you undertake this with preconceptions, will it be easy? To treat it as easy is to estrange Heaven—this is not fitting.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"My family is poor. For months, I have not drunk wine or eaten meat. Is this fasting?\" Confucius said: \"This is the fasting of sacrifice, not the fasting of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"May I ask about the fasting of the mind?\" Confucius replied: \"Unify your will. Do not listen with your ears, but listen with your mind. Do not listen with your mind, but listen with qi. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at signs. Qi is emptiness that awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.\"\n\n\"I have no further progress to make\"—this means no higher attainment remains. \"If you undertake this with preconceptions, will it be easy?\" If you think your skills suffice to act with ease, the moment this frivolous thought arises, you estrange the vastness of Heaven. Hence, it is said: \"To treat it as easy is to estrange Heaven—this is not fitting.\" These two lines are most vital for one’s life and practice.\n\nThe fasting of sacrifice is external; the fasting of the mind is internal. \"Unify your will\" means focusing the mind without distraction. Listening with the ears is still external; listening with the mind is still within oneself. Listening with qi is to be without thing. Listening with the ears stops at the ears and does not enter the mind; listening with the mind means external things must align with me, creating opposition between thing and self. Qi follows the natural and awaits things with emptiness. Emptiness is where the Dao resides. Hence, it is said: \"Only the Dao gathers in emptiness.\" This \"emptiness\" is the fasting of the mind.\n\nYan Hui said: \"Before I received your instruction, there was indeed a Yan Hui. Having received it, there is no longer a Yan Hui. Can this be called emptiness?\" Confucius said: \"It is complete.\"\n\n\"Received instruction\" means having been taught. This is Yan Hui’s sudden awakening: before receiving instruction, there was still a self; after receiving it, there is no longer a self. Forgetting the self is emptiness. \"It is complete\" means your words exhaust the principle.\n\nI speak to you: if you can enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by its reputation—entering, then you may respond; not entering, then cease—without gate, without poison, abiding in one dwelling and lodging in inevitability, then you are near. You, living in the world, are as if in a cage. If you can enter it and wander within without being stirred by hollow fame, then where there are traces, names may arise; but where traces arise, the mind is already moved. Moving through the world without intent leaves no trace; without trace, the mind remains unmoved. Thus it is said: \"Wander within its bounds without being moved by its reputation.\" What follows is precisely the method for navigating the world: \"Entering, then respond\" means speaking when one may be spoken to; \"not entering, then cease\" means not speaking when one may not be spoken to. The meaning aligns with the *Analects*, though the phrasing is striking. Where there is a fixed place, there is a gate; where there is no fixed place, there is no gate. Where there is scent and flavor, there is poison; where there is no scent or flavor, there is no poison. Poison is the taste of medicine—all metaphors for being without intent or trace. A dwelling is where one resides; if you take this undifferentiated unity as your abode and lodge this mind in inevitability, then the Way of living in the human world is complete. *Ji* means \"near completion.\"\n\n\"Erasing traces is easy; leaving no tracks while walking on the earth is difficult.\" Traces are footprints. To stop and not walk is to leave no footprints—this is easy. But how can one not walk? One must walk upon the earth, yet leaving no tracks while doing so is difficult. This means that if one refrains from all action, it is easy, but how can one live without acting? Since every aspect of life involves action, the challenge lies in acting without acting—this is difficult.\n\n\"Serving man is easy when feigning; serving Heaven is difficult when feigning.\" Serving man is easy when feigning, for one is driven by human desires and readily resorts to deception. But if one guards the mind and follows the workings of creation, there is no room for pretense. \"Serving man\" refers to human desires; \"serving Heaven\" refers to the daily application of Heavenly principle. The words \"easy\" and \"difficult\" carry meaning: the easy path leads to dissipation, while the difficult path leaves no room for pretense.\n\n\"I have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. I have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge.\" \"I have heard of flying with wings\" means birds must fly with wings; flying without wings is to arrive swiftly without haste, to reach without walking—this is the marvel of the spirit. This phrase serves as a metaphor for the following line. Ordinarily, people know through knowledge, but knowing what one does not know is the knowledge of no-knowledge—this is the subtlety of attaining the Dao.\n\n\"Look at that empty chamber: when the room is vacant, brightness is born. Auspiciousness abides where it abides. But if one does not abide, this is called sitting in motion.\" *Zhan* means to gaze. This uses the empty chamber as a metaphor for the mind: when you observe that even in a sealed room, light enters through the smallest opening, the light emerges from emptiness. Comparing that emptiness to the mind’s vacancy, you see that from emptiness, clarity naturally arises—brightness is born. It does not say \"brightness is born\" but \"whiteness is born,\" a striking turn of phrase by Zhuangzi. This state of empty clarity is where the myriad things gather, where auspiciousness dwells. \"Abiding where it abides\"—the second *zhi* refers to the empty place. Only by abiding can there be emptiness; only in emptiness can there be clarity, reflecting the principle that stillness gives rise to concentration, and concentration gives rise to wisdom. But if the mind is not restrained and cannot abide, though the body sits still, the mind races outward—how can one achieve sitting in forgetfulness? This is the meaning of \"sitting in motion,\" the inverse of sitting in forgetfulness.\n\n\"When one follows the ears and eyes inward and is outwardly free from the mind’s knowledge, even spirits will come to dwell—how much more so men? This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the path nearly grasped by Fuxi and nearly trod by Qi. How much more so for those who are scattered and fragmented?\"\n\nThe ears’ hearing and eyes’ seeing all inwardly connect to the heart—if I harbor no thoughts within, then I follow the hearing of the ears and seeing of the eyes. Though they inwardly connect, they are in truth external to the heart’s knowledge. What does it mean to be \"external to the heart’s knowledge\"? It means the heart remains unmoved, and external things cannot enter. Though one hears what is heard and sees what is seen, there is no heart engaged in hearing or seeing. In this way, the emptiness of this heart communes with spirits—how much more so with men? This is to say, only thus can one transform and influence others. \"Spirits come to dwell\" means that with utmost sincerity, this heart naturally harbors spirits and communes with the Creator. Thus, having expounded this, the text concludes with a single phrase: *This is the transformation of the myriad things.* This speaks of the principle of creation, the source from which all things arise. This was the great pivot seen by Shun and Yu, the path nearly trod by Fuxi and Qi to the end of their lives—how much more so for those beneath them? *Qi* may refer to an ancient sage-king, though no record confirms this; it is likely a figurative reference. *Scattered* refers to ordinary people. The text now shifts to further elucidate this, not adhering to the previous passage.\n\nYe Gong Zi Gao was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi. He asked Confucius, saying: \"The king’s charge to Zhu Liang is of great weight. Qi’s treatment of envoys is reverent yet not urgent. Even a common man cannot be moved lightly—how much more so a feudal lord? I am deeply fearful. You once told Zhu Liang: ‘In all matters, great or small, few succeed without speaking harmoniously to bring them to fruition. If a matter fails, one will surely face the calamities of human law; if it succeeds, one will surely face the calamities of yin and yang. Only one of virtue can ensure no calamity follows, whether the matter succeeds or fails.’ I eat coarse food without discerning its coarseness, and my cooking stove remains cold from lack of use. Now, upon receiving my charge this morning, I drink ice by evening—have I not inwardly exhausted myself? I have not yet fully grasped the nature of the matter, yet I already face the calamities of yin and yang. If the matter fails, I will surely face the calamities of human law. These are twofold perils. As a minister, I am unworthy of this task. You must instruct me further.\"\n\n*Zhu Liang* was Ye Gong’s name; *Zi Gao* was his courtesy name. \"The charge to Zhu Liang is of great weight\" means the mission to Qi is a grave responsibility. \"Reverent yet not urgent\" describes their treatment of envoys as courteous but slow in response. Even common men, when engaged, may not reciprocate—how much more so feudal lords? This is why he trembles with fear. *Zi* refers to the Master (Confucius). He once taught me: \"In affairs, great or small, few succeed without speaking harmoniously to achieve their completion.\" *Few* means rare; *not speaking* means not communicating. In governing, if a matter fails, one will surely face punishment, hence \"the calamities of human law.\" If one labors over calculations and schemes to succeed, excessive worry and stress will lead to illness, hence \"the calamities of yin and yang.\" Only one of virtue can ensure no calamity follows, whether the matter succeeds or fails. All the above are Confucius’ words.\n\nNow, since receiving the mission, I no longer taste my food—whether coarse or fine, I do not discern it. *Fine* means refined. Ordinarily, frequent meals keep the kitchen stove warm, but now, with little food due to worry, the stove remains cold. Moreover, upon receiving the charge this morning, my heart was already scorched, and by evening, I drank ice. *Nature* means reality. I have only just received the charge and not yet fully grasped the matter, yet I already suffer this affliction. If the matter fails, I will face punishment—thus, I suffer twofold calamities. As a minister, I am truly unequal to this task. *You must instruct me further* means, \"What teaching can you offer me?\" *Come* is an auxiliary word.\n\nConfucius said: \"There are two great precepts under heaven. The first is *ming* (Heaven’s decree); the second is *yi* (righteous duty). A child’s love for parents is *ming*—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to the ruler is *yi*—there is no place where the ruler is not present, no refuge within heaven and earth. These are called the great precepts.\n\nThus, one who serves parents finds peace without choosing the place—this is the utmost of filial piety. One who serves the ruler finds peace without choosing the task—this is the height of loyalty. One who serves the heart does not alter joy or sorrow before it: foreknowing the inevitable yet accepting it as *ming* is the pinnacle of *de* (virtue/power).\n\nAs a minister or child, one is fundamentally constrained by the circumstances of action, forgetting the self. How then could there be leisure to delight in life or shrink from death? Your conduct, sir, is fitting.\"\n\nThis passage is entirely sound in its discourse, addressing the human condition with such profound words. How could one dismiss Zhuangzi as impractical or given to grand exaggeration?\n\n*The great precepts* are the great laws. *Ming* is what one receives from Heaven: a child’s service to parents arises with birth, and this heart cannot depart for a single day—hence, it *cannot be untied*. *Yi* is what one ought to do in the world. A minister’s service to the ruler is the foremost duty in the realm. The saying *lord and subject* means that within the bounds of the land, none are not the king’s subjects—so where could one go that the ruler is not present? Where in heaven and earth could one escape? In serving parents with utmost filiality, one follows their command east or west, north or south, without choosing the place for comfort. When the heart is fixed on loyalty, joy and sorrow, though present, cannot alter it. Matters may be easy or difficult, fraught with fortune or misfortune—once the ruler’s command is issued, it becomes one’s own appointed task, a matter of *ming*. What can be done but accept and follow it?\n\nTo act thus is to be a person of utmost *de*. For a minister or child, much depends on what one encounters. If, by misfortune, one meets with hardship, it is simply what cannot be avoided. One must carry out the substance of the task and nothing more. *Substance* means reality—proceeding with plain sincerity, how could one turn to consider the self? Though calamity may extend to matters of life and death, there is no alternative. Your conduct, sir, is fitting.\"\n\n*Your conduct is fitting* means, \"You can only proceed thus.\" *Sir* refers to Lord Ye.\n\nI shall once more present what I have heard: In all dealings, if the parties are near, they must yield to one another in trust; if distant, they must be loyal in their words, and those words must be conveyed by others. Yet the words of mutual delight or mutual anger are the most perilous in the world. Where there is mutual delight, there is bound to be excessive praise; where mutual anger, excessive slander. All excess is falsehood—falsehood breeds distrust, and distrust brings calamity upon the messenger. Thus the *Maxims* says: \"Convey the ordinary sentiments, but do not convey the excessive words, and you will be nearly whole.\"\n\nHere, the discourse shifts to depict the ways of the world: trust must be grounded in something verifiable, like tallying tokens. *Yielding* means compliance. In close dealings, one acts thus; if the parties are distant, loyalty must be expressed through words, fully conveying the truth. Yet how do such words reach their destination? They must be transmitted by a messenger. But between the two—whether in mutual delight or mutual anger—lies the greatest difficulty. If one arrives in delight and the other responds in kind, their praise will exceed what is proper, hence \"excessive praise.\" If both are angry, their censure will likewise exceed what is proper, hence \"excessive slander.\" All such excess is falsehood, and falsehood ensures that the listener will be filled with doubt and unable to trust fully. *Mo* describes this state of suspicion. Once doubt arises, the ill will of both sides falls upon the messenger, who is inevitably blamed. Thus it is said: \"Distrust brings calamity upon the conveyor of words.\" The *Maxims* is an ancient text, cited here as a warning for those entrusted with such missions.\n\nTo \"convey the ordinary sentiments\" means the messenger should transmit only plain, unadorned speech, avoiding any words that exceed what is proper. Thus: \"Do not convey the excessive words.\" If the messenger acts thus, he may nearly preserve himself whole.\n\nMoreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin with openness but end in concealment. When excess prevails, there is much cunning. Those who drink wine with ritual propriety begin in order but end in disorder. When excess prevails, there is much extravagant revelry. All affairs are the same: they begin in sincerity but end in pettiness. What starts simply must grow vast. Words are like wind and waves; deeds are like the loss of substance. Wind and waves are easily stirred; the loss of substance is easily imperiled. Thus anger arises without cause, and artful speech with biased words. When a beast is dying, it does not choose its cries—its breath comes in ragged gasps, and from this, hearts grow fierce, and harshness takes hold. When severity becomes extreme, unworthy thoughts inevitably arise in response, though one may not realize it. If one does not realize it, who can know where it will end?\n\nHaving spoken of the perils of conveying words, the text now turns to analogies of worldly affairs, each sentence a reflection of human nature. This is the marvel of *Zhuangzi*: those who contend with skill and strength—like today’s wrestlers—begin with outward joy, but end in hidden malice. At first, they merely grapple in play, but in the end, it often turns to real fighting. For when play becomes excessive, it oversteps bounds, and cunning grows ever more strange. *Excess prevails* means overstepping bounds. Those who gather to drink do so with ritual propriety.\n\nAt the beginning, when the feast is orderly, all is decorous; when disorder takes hold, there is shouting and clamor. For when drinking exceeds proper bounds, the joy it brings often turns strange—thus disputes may arise. All things are like this: other affairs in the world follow the same pattern. *Liang* means trust. At first, when people join together in a common endeavor, they are always sincere and trusting. But later, pettiness and deceit arise—this is another matter. At first, one acts with restraint, planning only for the moment, yet by the end, it may grow into something great. The above speaks generally of worldly affairs, but now it turns to speech and action.\n\nFor when people engage in speech, it is the source from which winds and waves arise. *Wind moving upon waves* suggests emptiness and confusion. As soon as the word *action* is spoken, there is name and trace; with name, true substance is lost. *Winds and waves are easily stirred* means they readily descend into endless chaos. *When substance is lost, danger comes easily* means that when reality does not match the name, harm may follow.\n\n*Wu you* means without cause. Words of anger are often fabricated without any reason—thus *anger arises without cause*. *Pian ci* refers to a one-sided view; *qiao yan* are merely clever words that express only one side—thus *clever words, partial speech*. *When a beast dies, it does not choose its cries* means that when a beast is dying, what does it matter what sound it makes? This analogy describes those who, in anger or cunning speech, reach the point of contention—then their words pour forth without time for selection. As the common saying goes, *when people quarrel, no kind words are spoken*. *Qi xi furan* means rage. *Li* means fierce and cruel.\n\nWhen anger arises, a cruel and vicious heart emerges alongside it. Once I am thus, those who respond to me—confronted with my harshness—will inevitably harbor unfilial or unworthy intentions. At times, this may escalate to mutual harm or destruction, all driven by anger without awareness of its cause.\n\nHaving been swept away by anger without self-awareness, how can one pause to consider its consequences? The foregoing illustrates how worldly affairs may turn from good to evil through entanglement, leading to this point.\n\nThus, the *Fa Yan* states: *Do not alter commands; do not urge completion*—excess leads to transgression. To alter commands or urge completion is perilous, for success in goodness requires time, while evil forms too swiftly to amend. Should one not be cautious?\n\nMoreover, to ride the natural course of things and roam the mind freely, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection. Why act with ulterior motives of repayment? Far better to fulfill one’s mission. Yet this is difficult. Here, the text cites ancient words to conclude the matter of serving a ruler’s command: *Do not shift the mandate*, meaning to abide by constant principles.\n\nIf, upon receiving a command, one privately schemes for its fulfillment or alters its intent, it cannot succeed. Whether the matter succeeds or not must be left to nature; one cannot force its completion. Thus, *do not urge completion*—seeking excess is to overreach. The moment an excessive thought arises from an ordinary mind, it becomes a desire for gain, which must not surpass proper measure. To exceed the usual bounds is to overreach. Altering commands and urging completion are both excessive thoughts, and such schemes are bound to endanger. Hence, *perilous affairs*.\n\nHuman relationships, especially deep bonds, are not forged in a day but require time to stabilize. Thus, *goodness takes time to mature*. A single discordant word or uncooperative act may turn affection to enmity in an instant. Hence, *evil forms before one can correct it*. This means that turning to hatred is easy, while fostering goodwill is difficult—thus, one must be especially cautious.\n\nIf I ride the natural flow of events and let my mind wander freely, entrusting my response to necessity to nurture my center, this is the highest attainment. Why then act with ulterior motives of repayment? Repayment refers to returning to fulfill one’s mission. Acting excessively to seek gain is overreaching. *Fulfilling one’s mission* means conveying the ruler’s command to Wei with sincerity.\n\nYour duty is to deliver the ruler’s command with truth alone, without overthinking its success or failure. Even this sincere fulfillment is difficult; you must strive to achieve it. Here, the text adds another layer of difficulty, for navigating such circumstances is indeed hard.\n\nThis passage, titled *The Human World*, precisely describes the difficulty of navigating life. Its intricate portrayal of worldly affairs could only be achieved by one like Zhuangzi, whose nature harmonizes with the Dao. Some critics claim that Lao-Zhuang philosophy only grasps the subtlety of the Daoist mind (*the mind of the Dao is subtle*) while neglecting the peril of the human mind (*the human mind is perilous*). Such judgments arise from a superficial reading of their works.\n\nYan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei when he sought counsel from Qu Boyu: \"There is a man whose virtue is *heavenly destructive*. If I indulge him without restraint, he will endanger our state; if I guide him with principles, he will endanger me. His wisdom suffices to detect others’ faults but not to recognize his own. What should I do?\"\n\nQu Boyu replied: \"Excellent question! Be vigilant, be cautious, and first rectify yourself. In conduct, align with him; in mind, harmonize with him. Yet even these two approaches have pitfalls. Alignment should not be forced, nor harmony contrived. If you align outwardly but force entry, you risk collapse, ruin, or stumbling. If you harmonize inwardly but contrive exit, you risk becoming a voice, a reputation, an omen, or a calamity.\n\nIf he acts like a child, join him as a child. If he abandons boundaries, join him in abandoning boundaries. If he transcends limits, join him in transcending limits. Guide him to reach flawlessness.\"\n\nYan He was preparing to tutor the crown prince and sought Qu Boyu’s advice. *There is a man* refers to the prince. *His virtue is heavenly destructive* means heaven has stripped him of discernment—*destructive* here implies erosion, like frost withering grass, suggesting his nature has been corrupted by fate.\n\n*Without restraint* means lacking principles. If one allows his transgressions to go unchecked, he will endanger the state; if one corrects him, the harm will first befall oneself. The prince’s intelligence enables him to spot others’ faults but not his own. *What should I do?* expresses helplessness.\n\n*Rectify yourself* means to first establish discipline in one’s own conduct. *Align* means to follow, and *harmonize* means to attune. Yet both approaches have dangers: alignment should not be forced, nor harmony contrived.\n\nTo guide and lead him: outwardly display reverence and adopt the form of compliance, while inwardly exert every effort to harmonize and guide with one’s heart. Thus it is said, *\"In form, nothing surpasses alignment; in heart, nothing surpasses harmony.\"* The phrase *\"nothing surpasses\"* means no method excels these two.\n\nYet there is a subtle shift in these two approaches—alignment and harmony. To comply and merge with him as one is to *\"align and enter.\"* If the intent to guide becomes slightly apparent, revealing one’s edges, it is to *\"harmonize and withdraw.\"* If alignment reaches the point of *\"entering,\"* one’s own harmony is entirely abandoned, leading to ruin, destruction, collapse, and downfall. If harmony extends to the point where one’s reputation spreads, he will surely incur jealousy and harm, inviting calamity. Thus it is said, *\"It becomes fame, renown, omen, and affliction.\"* The phrasing here is most extraordinary.\n\n*\"Like an infant\"* refers to one who resembles an ignorant child. *\"Without boundaries\"* means lacking banks or shores—his conduct is unrestrained, without rules or standards. *\"Without limits\"* means without edges or bounds—his actions proceed without considering their ultimate consequences. The infant, without boundaries or limits, embodies the description of one who acts in ignorance and recklessness. Since he is so ignorant and reckless, one should comply with him for the time being. Thus it is said, *\"Also accompany him.\"* When he reaches a point of possible awakening, then apply subtle transformation to jolt him into sudden realization, so he may enter a state without blemish.\n\n*\"To awaken\"* means to attain enlightenment. *\"Without blemish\"* means without fault. Formerly, Master Aixuan recounted an old tale from Putian: a man whose father died left him unburied and squandered his family estate to indulge his desires. When his fields were nearly exhausted, his relatives pitied him and collected money to fund his father’s burial. He feigned agreement but spent the money as before. All his kin were outraged. One clansman, however, went out and befriended him, indulging his every whim. One evening, after heavy drinking and reaching the height of merriment, the clansman patted his back and said, *\"Others cannot bear such sorrow, yet Yan Hui did not alter his joy.\"* The man was suddenly awakened, wept bitterly, and returned home to bury his father. He ultimately became a good man. This is precisely the principle at work here.\n\nDo you not know of the mantis? In its fury, it brandishes its arms to block the wheel’s track, unaware of its inability to bear the task—yet this is the beauty of its nature. Beware, take heed: those who accumulate boasts of their fine talents and thus provoke the world’s taboos are on the brink of peril.\n\nDo you not know of those who raise tigers? They dare not feed them living creatures, lest the beasts’ rage at being forced to kill; nor do they dare give them whole prey, lest the beasts’ fury at tearing flesh be roused. They time their hunger and satiety, pacify their temper—though tigers and men are of different kinds, the tiger flatters and fawns upon its keeper, for this is submission. Thus, those it kills are those who oppose it.\n\nAs for those who love horses: they use baskets to collect dung and conch shells to gather urine. Yet when a mosquito or gadfly alights, and a groom absentmindedly slaps it, the horse, startled, may break its bit, smash its head, or shatter its chest. Here, devotion reaches one point, but carelessness loses another—can one not be cautious?\n\nBelow are several more analogies. The mantis, relying on the beauty of its talent, seeks to block the wheel’s track with its arms—this illustrates how those of modest talent, self-important, presume to take on great matters, and rarely avoid failure. Such is the consequence of repeated overreaching.\n\n*伐* means boasting; *几* means peril. Those who repeatedly boast of their fine talents and offend the world’s taboos will surely endanger themselves. Hence it is said: *\"Those who accumulate boasts of their fine talents and thus provoke the world’s taboos are on the brink of peril.\"*\n\nThe tiger’s nature is quick to anger, so its keeper must regulate and dispel its rage. Even the tiger, toward its keeper, harbors a semblance of affection—this is nothing more than submission. If one opposes it, one will surely be harmed. Thus it is said: *\"Those it kills are those who oppose it.\"*\n\nA *筐* is a bamboo vessel.\n\nThe *shen*-ash vessel is a utensil for holding excrement and urine—one might call this \"love,\" yet if mosquitoes and horseflies suddenly gather upon its body, and one fails to brush them away in time, the horse will inevitably break free of its bit and bridle, smashing its head against the reins, headstall, and browband. When fury surges from its heart in an instant, all the affection of former days is forgotten.\n\n*Clinging* here means clustering in swarms. *Perishing* is synonymous with *forgetting*. This illustrates how what is beautifully accomplished over time can be undone in an instant if one does not correct one’s faults. In human relations, there are those who follow and befriend one another for a lifetime, only to become enemies over a single word—this is the difficulty of navigating the world. Reading the passages on Lord Zigao and Yan He makes clear the intent of this chapter, *Amid the Human World*.\n\nWhen Carpenter Shi arrived in Qi, he came upon a curved-shaft oak, a sacred tree so vast it could shade an ox, its girth requiring a hundred spans to encircle. Its height towered above the mountains, rising seventy cubits before branches appeared. A dozen or more of its side limbs could be made into boats. Spectators thronged like a marketplace, yet the master carpenter paid no heed and walked on without pause. His disciple, having feasted his eyes, caught up to Carpenter Shi and said, \"Since I first took up the axe to follow you, Master, I have never seen timber so magnificent. Why did you refuse even to glance at it, walking on without stopping?\"\n\n\"Enough,\" he replied. \"Say no more.\"\n\nA worthless tree. Make it into a boat, and it sinks; fashion it into a coffin or outer casket, and it rots swiftly; shape it into vessels, and they shatter at once; use it for doors or windows, and it oozes sap; set it as a pillar, and it is eaten by worms. This is a tree of no use—precisely why it has attained such longevity.\n\nCarpenter Shi returned home, and in a dream the sacred oak of the altar appeared to him, saying, \"What will you compare me to? Will you liken me to the so-called 'useful trees'? Those crabapples, pears, tangerines, pomelos, and other fruit-bearing trees—once their fruit ripens, they are stripped and humiliated, their great branches broken, their small branches snapped. This is how their very usefulness brings suffering upon their lives. Thus they do not fulfill their natural span but perish midway, cut down by the world’s judgments. All things are like this.\n\nAs for me, I have long sought to be of no use. Nearly dead, I have only now attained it—and this is my great usefulness. Had I been useful, would I have grown so vast? Moreover, you and I are both things—how could one thing presume to judge another? How could a nearly dead, worthless man like you understand a worthless tree?\"\n\n*Curved-Shaft* is the name of a mountain; *li* is the name of the oak. This oak stood within the sacred altar grove. The *Analects* states, \"The Xia dynasty used the pine, the Zhou used the chestnut\"—in ancient times, the sacred grove always required a great tree as its center. *A hundred spans* describes its girth, measured by encircling it with both hands. *Seventy cubits* describes its height. If its branches could be made into boats, its trunk’s size may be imagined. *Feasted his eyes* means he gazed until fully sated. *Worthless tree* refers to a tree discarded as useless. *Oozes sap* describes the resin flowing thickly. *Pillar* refers to setting a tree as a column. *Useful trees* are those prized for their beauty and utility. The oak in the dream says, \"If you call me worthless, you compare me to useful trees.\" Crabapples, pears, tangerines, pomelos, and other fruit-bearing trees are all useful trees, and thus are damaged by people—this is how their usefulness harms their lives. *Usefulness* refers to usable timber. \"I have long sought to be of no use, and you only now recognize it\" is a rebuke to Carpenter Shi, akin to modern curses like \"half-dead fool.\" *Great usefulness* means that its worthlessness is precisely what preserves its life. Had it been useful, people would have felled it long ago—how then could it have grown so vast? \"Moreover\" underscores the shared nature of all things.\n\n\"Yet the *and* in 'Moreover' adds the particle *also*—if you and I are both things, though Carpenter Shi is a man and I am an oak, we are both but one thing among Heaven and Earth. Why then do you alone mock me as a thing? Thus it is said, 'If you and I *also* are things.' How could it be otherwise? In this single phrase, four *also*s and one *how*—such are the marvels of Master Zhuang’s prose. You are a man of no use yourself; why mock me, a tree of no use? Thus it is said, 'A half-dead worthless man—how could he understand a worthless tree?'\"\n\nCarpenter Shi awoke and interpreted his dream. His disciple asked, \"If it seeks to be of no use, why then does it serve as a spirit-tree?\" He replied, \"Hush—say nothing. It merely lodges there, as if unaware of itself, yet is reviled for it. Had it not become a spirit-tree, would it not still have faced the axe? Moreover, what it preserves differs from the common lot, and to judge it by conventional praise or blame is far indeed from the mark.\"\n\n*Interpretation* refers to divining the dream. The disciple, hearing the oak’s words in the dream, said, \"If this tree’s aspiration is to be of no use, why must it be employed as a spirit-tree?\" *Hush* means \"keep silent.\" *It* refers to the oak. Its role as a spirit-tree is but a temporary lodging—how could it have foreseen that today it would be reviled by one who fails to recognize its true nature? *Reviled* means to curse and shame. Even if it had not become a spirit-tree, would it not still have been felled? What it preserves is unlike what others value, and to measure it by moral judgment is far removed from its truth. *What it preserves* means what it upholds. \"Would it not still have faced the axe?\" Here, *would* shares the sense of *almost*.\n\nLater, Nanbo Ziqi wandered to the hills of Shang, where he saw a great tree...\n\nThere stood a tree of such extraordinary girth that a thousand chariots could shelter beneath its canopy. Marveling at its grandeur, Nanbo Ziqi exclaimed, \"What manner of tree is this? Surely it must possess rare timber!\" Yet when he gazed upward at its slender branches, they were gnarled and twisted—unfit for beams or rafters. Looking down at its massive roots, they were split and fissured—unsuitable for coffins or outer caskets. Tasting its leaves, they scorched the mouth and caused sores. Inhaling its scent, it drove men to raving drunkenness for three days without cease. Ziqi declared, \"This is indeed a tree of no use, and yet it has grown to such immense proportions! Alas—how the spirit-like person cherishes such uselessness!\"\n\nIn the region of Jing in Song, the catalpa, cypress, and mulberry—those slender enough to encircle with one’s arms—are felled for monkey perches. Those three or four spans in girth are cut down for the lofty beams of renowned halls. Those seven or eight spans wide are hewn for the side planks sought by noble households and wealthy merchants. Thus, before completing their natural lifespan, they meet an untimely end beneath the axe—such is the peril of being useful timber.\n\nNow, a white-browed ox, a snub-nosed pig, or a man afflicted with hemorrhoids—none of these may approach the river. The shamans and priests all know this, for these are deemed inauspicious. Yet this is precisely what the spirit-like person regards as most auspicious.\n\nThis passage parallels the preceding one, yet within it, several additional phrases further elucidate the theme. There stands a great tree, extraordinary in its magnitude—its vastness unlike that which is ordinary. Though a thousand chariots, each drawn by four horses, were to gather beneath its branches, seeking shelter from the scorching sun, it would still provide ample shade. Thus it is said: the horses shall find shelter from the heat, and this shelter comes from the tree itself, which in turn shelters all things. The heat seeks refuge from the tree, yet the tree’s essence remains hollow and insubstantial—like the stem of a taro, which, when licked or chewed, dissolves upon the tongue and rots the mouth, or when sniffed, clings to one like intoxication, so pungent is its odor. This tree, precisely because of its uselessness, has thus preserved its life and grown to such immense proportions. The spirit-like persons of antiquity preserved their lives by this same uselessness. Therefore it is said: \"The spirit-like person cherishes such uselessness!\"—an exclamation of admiration.\n\nJing is a place name. The catalpa, cypress, and mulberry are all useful timbers, well-suited to the climate and soil of that region. The former passage spoke of edible trees; this one speaks of usable timber. A *yi* is a stake, and *li* refers to the ridgepole of a house.\n\nThe great and eminent families—*gaoming* here refers to households of high status (the two characters originally shared the same meaning, though \"ming\" differs in pronunciation and form)—fell trees for coffin-making. Thus, the timber suited to this land, whether a mere armful or two, or three to four spans in girth, or even seven to eight spans, was felled without exception. Nothing could be spared, for their very usefulness brought such disaster upon them.\n\nThe *Guwu Zhu* is an ancient text of shamans and invokers. Within its explanations, it states: \"An ox with a white forehead, a pig with a broken snout and upturned nose—none of these may be offered in sacrifice to the River.\" In ancient times, humans were sometimes sacrificed to the River, as in the case of Ximen Bao. Here, Zhuangzi, fond of the extraordinary, adds the phrase \"suffering from piles\" to the list. *Shi* means \"to go\"; thus, none of these may be taken to the River for sacrifice.\n\nThough shamans and invokers deemed these three unusable and inauspicious, they did not realize that their very inauspiciousness spared them from the calamity of slaughter. From the perspective of the spirit-like person, this inauspiciousness is in fact great auspiciousness. Both these passages illustrate the perils of navigating the world: those who seek to distinguish themselves in society inevitably invite misfortune—hence the analogy.\n\nAs for *Zhili Shu*: his chin rested upon his navel, his shoulders towered above his head, his topknot pointed skyward, and the five viscera’s ducts rose upward. His thighs flanked his ribs. By mending clothes and washing laundry, he earned enough to feed himself; by winnowing grain and sifting out the finest rice, he could provide for ten. When the authorities conscripted warriors, *Zhili* rolled up his sleeves among them, though none selected him. When great labor was demanded, *Zhili*, citing his chronic ailment, was exempted from service. Yet when the state distributed grain to the infirm, he received three *zhong*, and when firewood was allotted, ten bundles. One whose body was as broken as *Zhili*’s could still sustain himself and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is thus fragmented?\n\n*Zhili* describes a body in disarray; *Shu* is his given name. His chin sank to his navel, his torso hunched. His shoulders jutted above his head, and his topknot was bound like a mallet. The ducts of his five viscera all inclined upward due to his stooped back. His thighs, pressed close to his sides, served as ribs. This depicts a man utterly disabled. By mending clothes and laundering, he made a living; by winnowing grain and refining rice, he fed ten—so swift was his labor. When warriors were conscripted, he raised his arms among them, but none chose him. When great labor was imposed, he was excused due to his chronic illness. Yet he received three *zhong* of grain and ten bundles of firewood from the state. If one whose body was as broken as *Zhili*’s could still nourish himself and live out his years, how much more so one whose virtue is thus fragmented?\n\nThe merit was like that of the Jin people in Zuo’s account, who built the walls of Qi and levied labor from the feudal lords—yet he was exempted from all military service and conscripted labor, and further received grain and firewood on account of his illness. This too was the intent of preserving oneself through uselessness. The fragmentation of his virtue speaks of the perfected person’s virtue, which is likewise fragmented: taking non-use as the greatest use. This shares the same meaning as the \"useless tree.\"\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, Jieyu, the madman of Chu, wandered past his gate and sang:\n*\"O phoenix! O phoenix!*\n*How your virtue has declined!*\n*The age to come cannot be awaited,*\n*The age past cannot be recalled.*\n*When the world follows the Dao, the sage achieves completion;*\n*When the world loses the Dao, the sage merely survives.*\n*In this present time, one is fortunate just to escape punishment.*\n*Blessings are lighter than a feather—who knows how to bear them?*\n*Disasters are heavier than the earth—who knows how to avoid them?*\n*Enough! Enough!*\n*To approach others with virtue is perilous!*\n*Perilous! Perilous!*\n*To tread where lines are drawn is to follow a maze.*\n*Brambles! Brambles! Do not harm my path!*\n*I walk my way in retreat, winding—do not harm my feet!\"*\n\nThe mountain trees fell to their own defenses,\nThe fat of the lamp consumes itself in flame.\nCinnamon is edible, so it is felled;\nLacquer is useful, so it is slashed.\nAll people know the use of what is useful,\nBut none know the use of what is useless.\n\nThis passage draws from the *Analects* to mock the Confucian school. Since the age to come cannot be awaited and the age past cannot be recalled, having been born into this world as this person in this time, when nothing can be done, one should simply conceal oneself. To stubbornly harbor the intent of saving the world at such a time is not the mark of one who understands the times.\n\nThus it is said: when virtue declines, if the world follows the Dao, the sage may complete his work; if the world loses the Dao, the sage preserves his life and no more. In this present age—a time of chaos—one is fortunate merely to escape punishment. What further aspirations dare one harbor?\n\nThus it is said: in this present age, one is fortunate merely to escape punishment. To live through an age of chaos and escape punishment so as to preserve one’s life—this is but the slightest sliver of fortune, yet you fail even to recognize it, though you bear and receive it. In an age of chaos, should misfortune befall you, it often leads to execution, a weight heavier than the earth itself, yet you fail to avoid it. The *Han Odes* says: “Glory and splendor fill not the eye, / While calamity looms large as a house.” This is precisely its meaning.\n\nEnough! Enough!—meaning, cease, cease. To exalt oneself by virtue and look down upon others is the way to court disaster. How perilous! How dangerous! “Drawing lines on the ground and walking within them” describes one who restricts and torments oneself as if bound by such lines. It is like Yangming—human nature is originally luminous, yet you, deluded, lose it and thus inevitably act in the world in a way that causes harm. “Crooked and circuitous” means to twist and turn, to evade and yield. Unable to follow the true and straight Way, you act thus—twisting, evading, yielding—and so must end by injuring your own feet. “Injuring your own feet” means it cannot be walked. The mountain tree, because it is useful, invites the axe’s disaster—this is self-inflicted harm. The fat of the lamp, because it gives light and is useful, brings upon itself the torment of burning. Cinnamon, because it is edible, is felled by others; lacquer, because it is useful, is slashed by others. These are all parables for those who cannot conceal themselves, who seek fame in the world and thus invite misfortune. Thus it is said: all people know the use of what is useful, but none know the use of what is useless.\n\nFrom the *Inner Chapters*, “Virtue’s Full Manifestation,” Chapter Five. *Fu* means resonance; what is within oneself can then resonate with what is without. To be full means that virtue is sufficient within oneself, and thus one responds appropriately to whatever arises. In Lu there was a crippled man, Wang Tai, whose followers were as numerous as Confucius’s. Chang Ji asked Confucius, “Wang Tai is a cripple, yet his followers are as many as yours, Master. He neither teaches when standing nor discusses when seated, yet those who go to him empty return full. Is there truly a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What sort of man is he?” Confucius said, “This master is a sage. I am merely a latecomer who has yet to visit him. I intend to take him as my teacher—how much more should those inferior to me? Why mention only Lu? I would lead the whole world to follow him.” Chang Ji said, “He is a cripple, yet he surpasses you, Master. Compared to ordinary people, the difference is even greater. If this is so, how does he employ his mind?” Chang Ji was a disciple of Confucius. “Half of Lu” means that half of the people of Lu followed Confucius, while the other half followed Tai. “Neither teaches when standing” means he stands with his disciples but teaches nothing; “nor discusses when seated” means he sits with his disciples but says nothing. Yet those who go to him empty return full—empty, having seen nothing, yet upon returning, they are replete with realization. “Without form” means nothing is seen; “heart is shaped” means the heart is moved and naturally transformed. Chang Ji, seeing this, thus questioned Confucius. Confucius said, referring to Wang Tai, “I merely intend to visit him, though I have been slow to do so. Even one such as I will take him as my teacher—how much more those beneath me? Why mention only Lu? I would lead the whole world to follow him.” “He is a cripple, yet he surpasses you, Master”—this phrase means he surpasses even the Master, and thus the difference with ordinary people is even greater. “Master” refers to Confucius; “ordinary people” means common folk. Confucius said, “Life and death are indeed great matters, yet they do not alter him.” “Life and death are indeed great matters...”\n\n\"These five characters—'Life and death are indeed great matters'—form a major thread in Zhuangzi, while the entire Buddhist canon emerges from them. What is meant by 'Life and death are matters as urgent as saving one’s head' is precisely this. 'Do not alter with them' means that though the changes of life and death are great, this heart remains unmoved and cannot be made to change with them. 'Do not' means 'cannot'; 'alter with them' means to change in accordance with them.\n\nThis saying is attributed to Confucius but is in fact Zhuangzi’s parable. Those who criticize it as heterodox claim that among all things, he fails to expound clearly, devoting his entire life to studying only this one matter—yet their critique is quite justified. However, the Buddhist teaching is precisely aimed at the ignorant and deluded, those mired in stupor and resistant to transformation; it uses fear to urge them toward goodness. Though its doctrine is flawed, its salvific intent is earnest. As Confucians, we cannot but refute its teachings, yet we must also understand its underlying purpose.\n\nThe Buddhists hold that of all things people fear, regardless of status, death is the greatest. Thus, they use it as leverage to compel entry into the Dao. Some say the Buddhists, fearing death, devised this teaching—yet they have lost sight of its true intent. Even if heaven and earth were to collapse, one would remain untouched, for one does not casually drift with external changes but guards the root amid the transformations of things. 'Heaven and earth collapsing' is a hyperbolic expression for the destruction of the cosmos. 'Untouched' means 'unfallen.' Thus, even if heaven and earth were to crumble, one would not fall with them—just as in the earlier saying, 'entering water without getting wet, entering fire without being burned.'\n\nThe language of the *Zhuangzi* differs from that of the *Analects* and *Mencius*, often employing exaggeration—this is simply its stylistic approach, not a claim that heaven and earth could truly collapse. 'Scrutinize' means to see clearly and thoroughly.\"\n\nThe term \"无假\" means \"real.\" Such phrases exemplify the subtlety of Zhuangzi's diction and phrasing. If one were to say \"clear\" or \"real\" outright, the expression would become clumsy. \"Not drifting with things\" (不与物迁) is synonymous with \"not changing with them\" (不得与之变) and \"not falling with them\" (不与之遗). \"Commanding the transformations of things\" (命物之化) means that the transformations of the myriad things all receive their mandate from me—akin to the Chan saying, \"When the mind is deluded, the *Dharma Flower* turns; when the mind awakens, the *Dharma Flower* turns.\"\n\n\"宗\" refers to the origin of the myriad things. \"Guarding the origin\" (守其宗) means that what this person guards lies in the beginning of the myriad things—just as the earlier passage spoke of \"having a beginning\" (有始), \"having not yet begun to have a beginning\" (有未始有始), and so on. In Zhuangzi's text, a term like \"宗\" may be glossed as \"beginning,\" but to grasp its full meaning, one must see that it signifies more than just \"beginning.\" Only then does its profundity become apparent. \"Guarding the origin\" is the whole substance; \"wandering in its harmony\" (游其和) is its great function.\n\nChangji asked, \"What does this mean?\" Confucius replied: \"Viewed from their differences, liver and gall are as distant as Chu and Yue; viewed from their sameness, the myriad things are all one.\" Ordinary people do not understand that the myriad things share a single origin. Though liver and gall may seem as distinct as Chu and Yue, knowing that they share a single origin means that the myriad things are all one with me. Observe how these two sentences pivot in their phrasing—many skilled writers before and after have employed this device. Zhuangzi's text is not only profound in its principles but also unparalleled in its literary craft, surpassing all other masters.\n\nIf this is so, then one no longer knows what is fitting for the ears and eyes but roams the mind in the harmony of virtue. The ears are for hearing, the eyes for seeing—yet one who can do this does not merely listen with the ears or see with the eyes. This is what Chan calls \"the six senses arising from a single source.\" How can one \"observe\" and yet be called \"Guanyin\" (Observer of Sounds)? Though this is the language of heterodoxy, it carries deep meaning. \"The harmony of virtue\" (德之和) is one with heaven, earth, and the four seasons. This \"harmony\" is not the \"harmony\" of the *Doctrine of the Mean*, which speaks of moderation. To read this text, one must possess a different eye.\n\nThings are seen in their unity, not in what they have lost. To see the loss of a foot as if discarding dirt—this is to regard things in their unity without seeing what they have lost. It means observing the myriad things without deficiency or excess, which aligns with the earlier passage about the millipede. This is Zhuangzi’s reversal of Gongwen Xuan’s dialogue with Jie Yu. \"Discarding dirt\" means to cast it away unknowingly, as if it were mere soil.\n\nChangji said: \"He cultivates himself (为己) by using his knowledge to attain his mind, and by using his mind to attain his constant mind. Why then do people value him so highly?\" \"Cultivating oneself\" means refining one’s person. \"Using his knowledge\" means that with this discernment, one can cultivate the self. \"Attaining his mind\" means that with this aware mind, one attains the original mind. The original mind and the aware mind are not two separate things; this phrasing is merely a way of speaking. The underlying meaning is that all people possess knowledge and all possess minds. If one can fully realize them, one can cultivate the self and attain the mind—this is an ordinary matter. Thus, it is said, \"attaining the constant mind.\" \"Most\" (最) means \"to honor.\" It does not say \"honor\" but \"most\"—this is what makes Zhuangzi’s writing so extraordinary. \"Things\" (物) refers to other people.\n\nConfucius said: \"People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the many.\" Flowing water is a metaphor for the mind that cannot be stilled; still water, for the mind that can. Stilling the mind is what makes one uniquely worthy among people. The multitude seek stillness by pursuing their desires, but only this person can truly do so. Thus, it is said, \"Only stillness can still the many.\" These words describe those who have not yet settled their minds but seek instruction from him—he can teach them to attain stillness. Is this phrasing not extraordinary? This is akin to the Chan saying: \"Bring me your mind, and I will settle it for you.\" The student says, \"I seek my mind but cannot find it.\" The master replies, \"I have settled your mind for you.\" This is the essence of that exchange.\n\n\"Receiving its mandate from the earth, only the pine and cypress remain verdant in winter and summer.\" \"Receiving its mandate from heaven, only Shun is upright.\" Fortunate in his uprightness, he can rectify his life and thereby rectify the lives of others. The pine and cypress are compared to Shun, and Shun to Wang Tai. It speaks only of their unique endowment from heaven, which enables them to rectify their own lives and thereby rectify the lives of others. Here, \"life\" (生) is synonymous with \"nature\" (性). Some may ask, \"How can Shun be compared to Wang Tai?\" To read Zhuangzi in this way is to speak dreams before a fool.\n\nThe proof of preserving the beginning lies in the reality of fearlessness. A single brave warrior, charging alone into nine armies, seeks fame and can hold fast to himself—yet even he is like this. \"Proof\" (征) means evidence; \"verification\" (验) means confirmation. \"Preserving\" (保) means guarding. To guard the original word and have evidence and verification is simply a matter of trust. Without this \"reality\" (实), one cannot be fearless. \"Nine armies\" refers to a multitude of soldiers; perhaps during the Warring States period, there was a formation of nine ranks—this need not be confined to the conventional six armies of the Son of Heaven or the three armies of the feudal lords. \"Holding fast to oneself\" means self-trust. Jing Ke and Nie Zheng were those who sought fame and trusted themselves. If even they, who guarded this single trust, could remain unchanged in life and death, how much more so for one who embodies the Way? In Buddhist texts, one finds those who sit on python rocks or guard tiger dens—this, too, is merely the reality of fearlessness. Zhuangzi’s passages like this are not mere allegories but are based on actual observations.\n\n\"Moreover, to govern heaven and earth, to store the myriad things, to lodge in the six limbs, to model the ears and eyes, to unify knowledge in what is known—is the mind not already dead in such a case?\" \"Governing heaven and earth\" means heaven covers and earth bears, each fulfilling its office. \"Storing\" (府) means gathering; the myriad things gather according to their kind. This is the same idea as \"heaven and earth are born with me, and the myriad things are one with me.\" Mencius said, \"The myriad things are all complete within me\"—this, too, is the idea of storing the myriad things, though the phrasing differs. \"Lodging in the six limbs\" means the six limbs are where I reside. \"Modeling the ears and eyes\" is akin to the earlier passage about \"what is fitting for the ears and eyes.\" The eyes model the eyes but are not limited to seeing; the ears model the ears but are not limited to hearing. Thus, it is said, \"modeling the ears and eyes.\" \"Unifying knowledge in what is known\"—the first \"knowledge\" (知) is pronounced *zhi* (wisdom), the second as *zhi* (to know). Wisdom is what is received from nature; knowledge is the function of wisdom. Because it is received from heaven, there is nothing it does not know. Thus, it is called \"unifying knowledge in what is known.\" The mind that perceives nothing is called \"dead.\"\n\nHe, then, chooses a day to ascend and reach the ultimate—this is to follow the Way. \"Ascend\" means to rise; \"reach\" means to arrive. The annotations pronounce *jia* as *gu* or *xia*, both incorrect. How could he choose a day to attain the Dao? It means he does not select a day to ascend and reach the Dao, for the Dao is present at all times—this is the idea that the Dao cannot be departed from even for an instant. The reason people follow Wang Tai in their learning is simply to follow the Way.\n\nThis \"is\" (*shi*) is emphatic. \"To take things as affairs\"—\"things\" here refer to people. How could he be willing to take others as his concern? For people seek learning from him; he never seeks to teach others.\n\nShentu Jia was a man who had lost his foot, yet he studied under Bohun Wuren alongside Zichan of Zheng. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay.\" The next day, they again sat together in the same hall on the same mat. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay. Now, I am about to leave—can you stay? Or is it that when you see an official, you do not yield? Do you consider yourself equal to an official?\"\n\nShentu Jia replied, \"In the Master’s gate, are there officials like this? You delight in your own official status and put others after yourself. I have heard that when a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if dust settles, it is not bright. When one dwells long with the worthy, one commits no faults. Now, what you take as greatest is the Master, yet you still speak like this—is this not a fault? Zichan, you are already as you are; do you still compete with Yao in goodness? Are your virtue and power not enough to reflect upon yourself?\"\n\n\"I leave first, you stay; you leave first, I stay\"—he wished for them to avoid each other. Shentu Jia did not comply with this arrangement, for the non-compliant do not avoid. \"Equal\" means the same; \"official\" refers to himself. He says, \"If you and I go out together, you consider yourself equal to an official.\" \"Putting others after\" means putting oneself first. To put oneself first and others after is to value oneself and belittle others. One with learning has broad vision and understanding. \"Take\" means to seek. He says, \"You study under the Master to seek broadened vision and understanding, yet you remain so narrow-minded?\" The phrase \"take as greatest\" is excellent, and \"compete with Yao in goodness\" is most striking. He says, \"You have already lost a foot—even if you could do good, could you match Yao? 'Reflect upon yourself' means you overestimate your abilities.\"\n\nShentu Jia said, \"Those who describe their faults to claim they should not have lost their feet are many; those who do not describe their faults to claim they should not have kept their feet are few. Knowing there is nothing to be done and accepting it as fate—only those with virtue can do this. To wander within Yi’s drawn bow—'within' means the center of the target. Yet not being struck is a matter of fate. People with whole feet laugh at my incomplete foot in great numbers. I was enraged, but when I came to the Master’s place, my anger vanished, and I returned to myself. Did the Master not wash me with goodness? I have wandered with you for nineteen years, yet you have never known I was footless. Now, you wander with me within the form and body, yet you seek me outside the form and body—is this not a fault?\"\n\nZichan was startled, changed his expression, and altered his demeanor, saying, \"You need not speak further.\"\n\n\"Describe\" means to recount. Those who recount their faults to claim they should not have lost their feet are many; those who do not speak of their faults to claim they should not have kept their feet are rare. Only those with virtue know that all things have their fate—how can man do anything about it? These three sentences describe three kinds of people, as if fate were to follow its course.\n\nThe passage about wandering within the drawn bow is most extraordinary—this is what the *Yi* means by \"treading on a tiger’s tail.\" Laozi said, \"My greatest trouble is that I have a body.\" To use a tiger’s tail as a metaphor for life’s dangers is already striking, yet Zhuangzi says, \"within Yi’s drawn bow.\" \"Within the drawn bow\" is the place where the arrow’s tip is aimed—the very center of the target. No archer was better than Yi; the center of the drawn bow was where he was certain to strike. The world’s dangers are like this, and this saying is especially apt in the Warring States period. To be fortunate enough not to be struck is a matter of fate.\n\n\"Vanished\" means to lose oneself entirely. His anger had reached this point, yet it all disappeared upon returning. He says, \"Upon seeing the Master, I returned and lost all cause for anger.\" The word \"wash\" is excellent—it means the Master instructed him with goodness, as if cleansing him without his realizing it.\n\nThe phrases about \"within the form and body\" and \"outside the form and body\" are the best—such ideas are not found in earlier texts. \"Speak further\" means to praise his ability to speak, as in the *Zuozhuan*, where the people of Lu called someone \"quick-witted.\"\n\nThere was a footless man of Lu named Shushan Wuzhi who came to see Confucius on his heels. Confucius said, \"You were not careful before and have already suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?\" Wuzhi said, \"I simply did not know my duty and lightly used my body, which is why I lost my foot. Now I come because there is still something worthy of respect remaining in me, and I wish to preserve it. The heavens cover all without exception; the earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like heaven and earth—how could I have known you would be like this?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Qiu is truly unworthy. Why do you not enter? Please speak of what you have heard.\" Wuzhi left. Confucius said, \"Disciples, exert yourselves! This man Wuzhi, though footless, still strives to learn to make up for the evil of his past conduct—how much more should those with whole virtue do so?\"\n\nWuzhi said to Lao Dan, \"Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he so diligently seek to learn from you? Does he hope to gain a reputation for the strange and marvelous, not knowing that the perfected person considers such things as his own shackles?\" Lao Dan said, \"Why not simply let him see that life and death are one thread, that right and wrong are one strand, and thus free him from his shackles—would that not be possible?\"\n\nWuzhi said, \"This is heaven’s punishment—how can it be freed?\"\n\n\"He came on his heels\"—*zhi* means to visit; \"not knowing one’s duty\" means not understanding affairs. \"Something worthy of respect\" refers to his nature. The phrase \"worthy of respect\" is strikingly put—what is to be valued lies not outside the form and body. \"Diligent\" (*binbin*)—Sima Biao explains this as a respectful appearance. \"Strange and marvelous\" refers only to a love of fame. \"His own shackles\" means fame is a burden to oneself. \"Heaven’s punishment\" means heaven does not grant him the Dao.\n\nZhuangzi uses Confucius as a mouthpiece, sometimes restraining him, sometimes exalting him—all is allegory. Yet in this passage, he says, \"This man Wuzhi, though footless, still strives to learn to make up for the evil of his past conduct—how much more should those with whole virtue do so?\" These words are also beneficial to the world’s teachings. \"Life and death as one thread, right and wrong as one strand\" echoes the ideas in the \"Equalizing Things\" chapter—\"Is it acceptable? Is it not acceptable?\"\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, saying: \"In Wei there is an ugly man named Aitai Tuo. Men who live with him grow attached and cannot bear to leave. Women who see him say to their parents, 'Rather than be another man’s wife, I would be his concubine'—there are more than ten such cases, and the number does not cease. He has never been heard to take the lead in speech, only to harmonize. He holds no lordly position to bring order to others, nor does he amass wealth to fill men’s bellies. Moreover, his ugliness startles all under heaven. He harmonizes but does not lead; his knowledge does not extend beyond the four quarters. Yet when male and female gather before him, there must be something extraordinary in this man. I summoned and observed him: indeed, his ugliness startled all under heaven. Yet after living with me for less than a month, I began to take notice of him. Before a year had passed, I trusted him. As my state had no chief minister, I wished to entrust him with governance. He responded with reluctance, as if declining, and I felt ashamed. In the end, I handed over the state to him. Before long, he left me and departed, and I felt as though I had lost something, as though there were no one with whom to share the joy of ruling this state. What manner of man is this?\"\n\n\"An ugly man\" refers to one whose form is repulsive. \"He does not lead, only harmonizes\" means he does nothing to assert himself. \"He holds no lordly position\" means he lacks noble authority. \"Amasses wealth\" refers to riches; \"fills men’s bellies\" means to satiate, to fill to the full—like the moon at its fullest, called *wang*. Observe how Zhuangzi wields his brush in such passages—who could match it? \"His knowledge does not extend beyond the four quarters\" means his understanding does not transcend the world. \"Male and female gather before him\" suggests his closeness with all things, akin to the idea of gulls that are not startled. \"Responded with reluctance\" means he answered without intent. *Fan* implies detachment, without attachment. \"I felt ashamed\" means I felt humiliated. \"Handed over the state\" means I entrusted him with governance. \"Felt as though I had lost something\" echoes the Han king’s lament, \"like losing one’s right and left hands.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"When I was once sent on a mission to Chu, I happened to see young pigs nursing from their dead mother. After a little while, they glanced about, then all abandoned her and fled, for they no longer saw their mother in her. What they loved was not her form, but what animated her form. When warriors die in battle, their burials do not include funeral fans. When a man’s feet are cut off, no one cherishes his shoes—neither has any use for the other. This is because the root is gone. The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears. When a man takes a wife, she remains outside and is no longer employed in service. Even those with whole bodies are thus valued—how much more so those with whole virtue? Now Aitai Tuo has not spoken, yet he is trusted; he has done no deeds, yet he is beloved. He makes men offer him a state, only fearing he will not accept. This must be one whose talent is whole and whose virtue is unmanifest.\"\n\nThe analogy of the young pigs illustrates that love and aversion do not lie in the beauty or ugliness of form. *Shun ruo* describes their startled appearance. \"No longer see their mother in her\" means she no longer resembles her former self. *Yi shen* refers to her body, meaning they no longer see her as she was before, hence their reaction. These are all flourishes of Zhuangzi’s brush. The idea that \"what they loved was what animated her form\"—if judged by the standards of conventional morality, this statement would be gravely offensive. Yet it reflects the ancient principle of \"serving the dead as one serves the living,\" not bearing to see one’s kin dead. Such passages are exaggerated in their expression; one must not judge them by such standards, nor remain ignorant of their intent.\n\n\"Warriors who die in battle do not use funeral fans\"—this is not a proper ritual observance. *Sha* refers to the objects used. \"A man whose feet are cut off has no use for shoes\"—external adornments have no place here. This too illustrates the idea that virtue lies within, not without. \"The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears\"—they do not adorn themselves, preserving their natural form. \"When a man takes a wife, she remains outside and is no longer employed in service\"—this refers to the *Record of Rites*, which states that newly married women are exempt from service, meaning they are not to be employed in the palace. This analogy of preserving the whole form illustrates the meaning of whole virtue.\n\nDuke Ai said: \"What do you mean by 'talent whole'?\"\nConfucius said: \"Life and death, existence and extinction, failure and success, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the movements of fate. They follow one another day and night before us, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginnings. Therefore, they are not sufficient to disturb harmony or enter the sacred chamber of the mind. Make it so that one is harmonious, joyful, and flowing without losing the state of delight; make it so that day and night there is no interruption, and one joins with things in springtime. This is what it means to respond and give rise to the timely within the heart. This is called 'talent whole.'\"\n\nThis passage culminates in the phrase \"talent whole, virtue unmanifest.\" Earlier, it was said that even life and death, though great, do not cause one to change; here, it enumerates life and death, existence and extinction, failure and success, poverty and wealth, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—all together—to prevent any elaboration from exceeding the point. *Gui* means to seek. These are the changes of affairs and the movements of fate, succeeding one another day and night before our eyes. Even the wise cannot seek their beginnings; one can only say they occur naturally. \"Not sufficient to disturb harmony\" means they cannot disrupt the harmony within the breast. \"Not enter the sacred chamber of the mind\" means they do not move the heart. \"Harmonious, joyful, flowing\"—these three words share a single meaning: *yu* means joy, *tong* means unobstructed. If the heart is unmoved, it naturally becomes harmonious, joyful, and flowing without losing its delight. *Dui* also means delight. This sentence captures the essence of Zhuangzi’s writing—\"harmonious, joyful, flowing\" is akin to saying \"all-pervading and complete,\" as seen in later passages. \"Day and night without interruption\" means ever-renewing, without cessation. *Que* means to stop. \"Joins with things in springtime\" means that wherever one dwells, there is joy. *Wu* refers to things. This \"spring\" is akin to *dui* (delight). \"Respond and give rise to the timely within the heart\" echoes the Buddhist sutras' \"abiding nowhere yet giving rise to the heart.\" *Jie* means to be moved; *shi* means the timely, as in \"timely action.\" Responding to the movements of affairs without bias or stagnation—this is called \"giving rise to the timely within the heart.\" *Cai* means substance, as in Mencius' \"Heaven bestows substance.\" \"Talent whole\" means preserving one’s innate nature in its entirety.\n\n\"What do you mean by 'virtue unmanifest'?\"\n\"The level is the fullness of still water. It can serve as a model. Within, it is preserved, and without, it does not sway. Virtue is the cultivation of completed harmony. 'Virtue unmanifest' means things cannot depart from it.\"\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Minzi of this, saying: \"Alas! I, facing south as the ruler of all under heaven, holding the people’s guiding principle, and worrying over their deaths, believed myself to be thoroughly enlightened. Now I have heard the words of a perfected man, and I fear I lack the substance. I have lightly used my person and nearly lost my state. I and Confucius are not ruler and subject—we are friends in virtue.\"\n\nThe phrase \"virtue unmanifest\" speaks of virtue having no visible form. When water is still, it becomes level; being level, it can serve as a model. A model is a standard. \"Within, it is preserved\" means stillness; \"without, it does not sway\" means cessation. This echoes the earlier reference to \"gazing into still water.\" Below, the text shifts its phrasing: \"harmony\" refers to the harmony of the center; \"completed\" means wholeness. To wholly preserve the harmony within one’s nature is the cultivation of virtue. \"Virtue unmanifest\" follows things and appears in them, meaning there is nowhere it does not go and no single aspect by which it can be named. Thus, it is said, \"Virtue unmanifest is what things cannot depart from.\"\n\nThe phrase \"holding the people’s guiding principle\" is excellent—it is precisely the handle of governing the state. \"Worrying over their deaths\" means the ability to cherish the people. How could Duke Ai truly \"face south as the ruler of all under heaven\"? These are all instances where Zhuangzi’s brush overreaches, failing to attend to proper bounds. \"Not ruler and subject—friends in virtue\" shares the same intent as Mencius’ \"befriending,\" both being allegorical and not to be taken literally.\n\nYǐnqí, the hunchbacked man with no lips, spoke to Duke Ling of Wei, who delighted in him and, looking upon whole men, saw their necks as too thick. The man with a large goiter spoke to Duke Huan of Qi, who delighted in him and, looking upon whole men, saw their necks as too slender. Thus, virtue may excel while form is forgotten. People do not forget what they forget but forget what they should not forget—this is called \"true forgetting.\"\n\nYǐnqí means a crooked back; *zhīlí* describes a stooped appearance; *wúshèn* means lipless. A hunched, lipless man is exceedingly ugly. *Jiānjiān* describes a slender, elongated appearance; *wèngfáng* refers to a large goiter. These two lines illustrate how people’s likes and dislikes lie beyond physical form: the hunchbacked and goitered men found favor with their lords, who, looking upon whole men, saw them as inferior. Thus, it is said, \"virtue may excel while form is forgotten.\" People do not forget what they forget but forget what they should not forget. These two lines are superb, echoing Mencius’ analogy of \"one finger being inferior to others.\" What can be forgotten is form; what cannot be forgotten is virtue. \"True forgetting\" is genuine forgetting—knowing form but not knowing virtue is true forgetting.\n\nTherefore, the sage wanders in knowledge, yet it becomes a snare; in cleverness, yet it becomes glue; in virtue, yet it becomes a bond; in skill, yet it becomes trade. The sage does not scheme—why use knowledge? Does not carve—why use cleverness? Suffers no loss—why use virtue? Does not barter—why use skill? These four are the heavenly market.\n\nThe heavenly market.\n\nThe heavenly market is the heavenly sustenance. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why rely on man? The sage wanders—this wandering is what is meant by \"the mind wandering in Heaven.\" *Zhi* (knowledge, pronounced in the falling tone) is using wisdom to handle affairs. *Yue* (restraint) is self-discipline through ritual. *Gong* (skill) is craftsmanship. *Nie* is calamity; *jiao* is glue, fixation. *Jie* is attachment to externals while forgetting the internal. *Shang* is trade, as in \"buying reputation under Heaven.\" When the mind wanders in Heaven, one knows these four are all burdens. The sage schemes not in the world, so does not use wisdom; carves not, so does not need restraint; guards the internal and has no concern for externals, so does not rely on virtue; seeks not to sell, so does not employ skill. These four—no scheming, no carving, no loss, no bartering—are the heavenly market, the heavenly sustenance, the heavenly emolument. It is like the heavenly nobility: having received sustenance from Heaven, why seek human titles? The phrase \"attachment gives rise to the times in one’s heart\" means that when talent is whole and virtue does not manifest, the wisdom known by knowledge—all three characters in the earlier passage were good, but here \"attachment\" and \"virtue\" and \"wisdom\" become bad. This is the brush dancing, not heeding consistency before and after, which is why it is a heterodox text.\n\nOne has the form of man but not the passions of man. Having the form of man, one mingles with others; lacking the passions of man, right and wrong do not adhere to the self. How small—thus belonging to man! How great—thus completing one’s Heaven alone! Huizi asked Zhuangzi, \"Do men truly have no passions?\" Zhuangzi said, \"Yes.\" Huizi said, \"If a man has no passions, how can he be called a man?\" Zhuangzi said, \"The Dao gives him appearance, Heaven gives him form—how can he not be called a man?\" Huizi said, \"If he is called a man, how can he have no passions?\" Zhuangzi said, \"This is not what I mean by passions. What I mean by having no passions is that man does not inwardly harm his self with likes and dislikes, always following nature without artificially enhancing life.\" Huizi said, \"If one does not enhance life, how can one have a self?\" Zhuangzi said, \"The Dao gives him appearance, Heaven gives him form—do not inwardly harm your self with likes and dislikes. Now you, your spirit is externalized, your essence is wearied. Leaning against a tree, you chant; resting on a withered catalpa, you doze. Heaven selected your form, yet you cry out with ‘hard and white’—this is mere disputation.\"\n\nThis passage is Zhuangzi’s dialogue with Huizi. The lines beginning \"One has the form of man\" are Zhuangzi’s usual words, which Huizi then questioned. \"Mingling with others\" means being in the same flock as men. \"Right and wrong do not adhere to the self\" means there is no entry that does not bring self-possession, transcending right and wrong, alone completing one’s Heaven and becoming Heaven’s companion. If man can be external to right and wrong, with no entry that does not bring self-possession, then he becomes Heaven’s companion, and his achievement is great. \"Heaven gives him form\" is having a thing. \"The Dao gives him appearance\" means things must have their principles. What I mean by \"having no passions\" is that man does not inwardly harm his self with the passions of likes and dislikes. If there is enhancement, there is harm; if one always follows nature, there is neither enhancement nor harm. To speak of excess and deficiency is to speak of illness—enhancing life is the illness of excess. If likes and dislikes arise from nature and do not cling, then there is neither harm nor enhancement. Huizi said, \"If one does not enhance life, how can one have a self?\"—this takes enhancing life as the means to sustain life, which is not Zhuangzi’s intent. Zhuangzi and Huizi were the closest of friends; Huizi was broadly learned and fond of debate, so Zhuangzi mocked him for externalizing his spirit and wearying his essence. \"Externalizing the spirit\" means the spirit is used externally, like a spirit not guarding its abode. *Gaowu* is a withered catalpa used as a table. *Ming* means weariness. *Jianbai* is the name of a debate. *Xuan* means selection, appointment. It says: Heaven bestowed your form, yet you torment yourself thus—why? Just for one \"cry\" of disputation, Han Yu drew from this to compose a preface, praising its marvel. How could Zhuangzi not be a master of writing?\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll 2\n*Section: Masters, Daoist School, Zhuangzi Kouyi*\n\n*The Imperial Four Treasuries Edition*\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll 3\n*By Lin Xiyi of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**Inner Chapters: The Great and Venerable Master (Chapter Six)**\n\n\"The Great and Venerable Master\" is the Dao—just as the sage emulates Heaven, Heaven emulates the Dao, and the Dao emulates spontaneity. To know what Heaven does and to know what man does is perfection.\n\nTo know what Heaven does is to be Heaven-born. To know what man does is to use what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s natural lifespan without dying prematurely midway—this is the fullness of knowledge.\n\nYet there is a danger: knowledge depends on something external to be fitting, but what it depends on is inherently uncertain. How can we be sure that what I call \"Heaven\" is not \"man,\" or that what I call \"man\" is not \"Heaven\"? Only with the true person does true knowledge arise.\n\nMan’s life arises from Heaven, hence it is said: \"what Heaven does.\" Yet dwelling in the world, there are human affairs one must fulfill, hence it is said: \"what man does.\" When human affairs are complete, Heavenly principle appears. Thus, one uses what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know. Not exhausting oneself to harm life, it is said: \"fulfilling one’s natural lifespan.\" Knowing both Heaven and man, it is said: \"the fullness of knowledge.\"\n\nThese words are quite correct, yet the turn beginning with \"though there is a danger\" is especially subtle. \"Knowledge depends on something external to be fitting\"—knowledge resides in me, but what it depends on lies outside. Sometimes one attains without seeking, sometimes one must seek to attain—neither can be determined in advance. \"Fitting\" means both \"certain\" and \"appropriate.\" Only after a matter is settled does its appropriateness or inappropriateness become clear. This single word is used with great skill. If one believes something comes from Heaven yet must seek to obtain it, or if one believes it comes from man yet sometimes seeks in vain, this is what is meant by \"how can we be sure that Heaven is not man, or man is not Heaven?\"\n\nFor example, longevity and premature death are both fated—nothing is not destiny. Yet it is also said: \"Those who know destiny do not stand beneath a crumbling wall.\" Here we see the uncertainty in what Heaven does and what man does. Zhuangzi’s observation of worldly affairs is most precise; such passages demand careful reflection.\n\n\"Only with the true person does true knowledge arise\"—this speaks of one who embodies the Dao.\n\nWhat is a true person? The true persons of old did not resist the few, did not boast of their accomplishments, and did not scheme. If they erred, they did not regret; if they succeeded, they did not take pride. If they ascended heights, they did not tremble; if they entered water, they were not drenched; if they entered fire, they were not burned. Such is the knowledge that ascends to the Dao.\n\n\"Not resist the few\"—lack is not a deficiency; it means not opposing the natural course. When times are insufficient, one simply follows them. \"Did not boast of their accomplishments\"—though they succeeded, they did not take it as a boast. *Xiong* means boasting. *Shi* (士) is interchangeable with *shi* (事), as in the *Ode to Dongshan*: \"Do not *shi* the marching ranks.\" *Mo* means scheming—acting without intention, hence \"did not scheme.\" \"If they erred, they did not regret\"—*guo* means error, like today’s \"misstep.\" \"If they succeeded, they did not take pride\"—*dang* means fitting, like today’s \"just right.\" Success is not taken as self-satisfaction. Whether things went wrong or right, all was entrusted to spontaneity: not regretting failure, not rejoicing in success.\n\n\"Ascended heights without trembling, entered water without being drenched, entered fire without being burned\"—this is to be unobstructed in all situations. \"Knowledge that ascends to the Dao\"—their insight deeply penetrated the Dao. The two \"if so\" phrases demonstrate Zhuangzi’s literary style. *Zhi* is interchangeable with *zhi* (wisdom). *Jia* means to reach.\n\nThe true persons of old slept without dreaming and woke without worry. Their food was not savory, and their breath was deep. The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the common person’s breath reaches only the throat. Those who submit in fear have throats that sound like retching; those with deep desires have shallow Heavenly mechanism.\n\nTheir sleep was dreamless—spirit settled.\n\nThe so-called \"true person is dreamless\"—this is what it means. \"Their waking is without worry\"—they engage with the world yet do not contend with the heart-mind. \"Their food is not savory\"—they have no intent to sate hunger, akin to the Chan practice of \"filling the hunger wound.\" \"Their breath is deep\"—the true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the common person’s reaches only the throat. This is the origin of Daoist cultivation discourse. When the spirit is settled, the breath in its egress and ingress is deep, rising from the heels to the mouth and nose—hence the method of *shuxi* (breath-counting). Without nurturing the spirit, the breath in its egress and ingress halts at the throat alone. Stillness and agitation differ, and what manifests in the body is seen as retching. *Ai* (嗌) means the throat; *yan* (咽) means to swallow. Without true insight, speech remains on the lips, making one easily submissive to others. This line reveals the flavor of Zhuangzi’s words, as in the Chan saying: \"The frog Chan leaps but once\"—just as retching is easily subdued. \"Desires\" are human desires; \"Heavenly mechanism\" is Heavenly principle. \"Deep and shallow\" refer to the waxing and waning of Heavenly principle and human desire, as the ancients put it. This passage, line by line, is a thread running through Daoist and Buddhist texts alike, showing how this elder’s self-attainment cannot be read carelessly. Alas, we do not see Dahui, Zhang Pingshu, or others debate this with him.\n\nThe true persons of old neither delighted in life nor abhorred death. They emerged without precaution and entered without resistance, departing with ease and arriving with ease. They did not forget their origin nor seek their end. They received and rejoiced in it, forgot and returned to it—this is called \"not using the heart-mind to harm the Dao\" and \"not relying on others to assist Heaven.\" This is the true person. This passage speaks only of life and death: emerging from life, entering death. \"Departing with ease and arriving with ease\"—not forgetting the origin, not seeking the end—this is what is meant by \"tracing the beginning to grasp the end, thus knowing the discourse on life and death.\" Someone asked Master Zhaozhou, \"Where will you go after a hundred years?\" He replied, \"After the fire burns out, it becomes a stalk of thatch\"—this is not seeking the end. \"Receiving\"—receiving one’s form, bestowed by Heaven—how could one not rejoice? \"Returning\"—returning whole, without attachment—hence \"forgetting and returning.\" \"Not using the heart-mind to harm the Dao\" means the heart-mind *is* the Dao; there is no Dao outside the heart-mind. \"Not relying on others to assist Heaven\" means longevity and early death are fated; human effort cannot add to it. These ten words deserve careful reading. \"Not harming\" means not departing from it even for a moment.\n\nIf so, their heart-mind is steadfast, their countenance serene, their brow prominent. They are chill like autumn, warm like spring. Joy and anger flow with the four seasons, harmonizing with things without fixed limit. *Zhi* (志) means having a settled intent. The meaning of words in this text cannot be sought through the methods of the *Analects* or *Mencius*. The ancients said: \"Buddhism speaks of nature but only addresses the heart-mind—since it is already heterodox, how can we seek the meaning of words in our texts through it?\" \"Serene\"—like the nineteen years of facing the wall. This is the serenity of their countenance. *Kui* (頯) means large; *sang* (颡) means the forehead. Their head is held upright, revealing their prominent brow. \"Chill\" is anger; \"warm\" is joy. Joy and anger arise without intent, like the seasons of spring and autumn. \"Limit\" means the point of cessation. \"Things\" means affairs. They respond to affairs, each fitting its measure, without a fixed place of cessation—this is what is meant by \"engaging with things to give rise to the times of the heart-mind.\"\n\nThus, when the sage employs troops, he may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. His beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet he is not called loving. Employing troops poisons the world; bestowing beneficence loves the world—both are enacted without intent. Thus, those whose states are destroyed do not resent him, and those who receive his virtue say, \"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?\" Our texts also contain this idea, but Zhuangzi’s brush, in its vivid portrayal, goes too far. For example, \"beneficence extending to ten thousand generations yet not called benevolent\" and \"governing the myriad things yet not called righteous\"—all belong to this vein.\n\nTherefore, one who delights in harmonizing with things is not a sage; one who has partiality is not benevolent; one who follows the seasons is not worthy; one who does not penetrate profit and harm is not a gentleman; one who acts for fame loses the self and is not a scholar; one who destroys the self is not true and is not a servant of others. Those like Huxie, Wuguang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Wu Xuyu, Ji Ta, Shentu Di—these are servants of others, conforming to others’ ways and not attaining their own. This passage satirizes the sages and worthies to illustrate the unattainability of the true person. Its meaning is that in a world without true persons, none from the sages downward—great or small—are genuine.\n\n\"Delighting in harmonizing with things\"—the sage’s heart-mind takes joy in nothing not finding its place. To be content with things’ prosperity or decline and take joy in this is insufficient to be a sage. Without intent, there is no near or far; with near and far, there is intent. With intent, it is not benevolence. \"Following the seasons\"—acting in accord with the times—is what the worthy take as ability, yet it is not. \"Penetrating profit and avoiding harm\"—the gentleman can do this, but if he cannot unite profit and harm as one, he is still not a gentleman. The scholar must act for fame; fame is the guest of reality. To act for the guest is to lose the self—hence, not a scholar. \"True\" means natural. Not knowing the natural and laboring to destroy the self is to be enslaved by others, not to enslave others. These are all excessive arguments. Thus, from Huxie downward—like Boyi, Shuqi, and Jizi—all are mocked as enslaved by others and losing the self. Hence, \"not attaining their own way.\" Though the words are biased, the writing is marvelous. Huxie, Wuguang, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di were all worthies of old who did not attain their own way.\n\nThe true persons of old had a demeanor of righteousness yet no cliques, appearing insufficient yet not obsequious. Their edges were sharp yet not rigid, their vastness empty yet not ostentatious. Cheerful, as if pleased; towering, as if compelled; expansive, offering their countenance; yielding, halting their virtue. Stern, as if worldly; aloof, as if uncontrollable; boundless, as if fond of seclusion; forgetful, as if losing their words. They took punishment as their body, ritual as their wings, wisdom as their time, virtue as their path. Taking punishment as their body—they were lenient in their severity. Taking ritual as their wings—they used it to move through the world. Taking wisdom as their time—they acted when unavoidable. Taking virtue as their path—they spoke of it as having feet, reaching the hills, yet others truly took them as diligent practitioners.\n\nThis passage of metaphorical description contains moments of warmth and purity, yet its expressions are too vast and boundless—such depictions abound in Buddhist texts.\n\n\"Virtuous yet not cliquish\" means standing alone without leaning to either side. \"Cheerful, as if insufficient yet not obsequious\"—*kànrán* suggests a sense of inadequacy without self-debasement; *chéng* in *Zuǒzhuàn* means \"to assist,\" here denoting compliance with a humble demeanor. *Yúhū* describes a leisurely bearing. *Gū* refers to the corners of virtue. \"Sharp yet not rigid\" means possessing the edges of virtue without harsh angles. *Zhānghū* conveys an expansive, unconstrained appearance. \"Empty\" means having the substance of nothingness; \"not ostentatious\" means being substantial. *Bǐngbǐng* describes a joyful countenance, seeming pleased yet not truly so. *Cuīhū* implies an unavoidable response to worldly affairs, much like acting only after hesitation. *Chùhū* means to gather or accumulate, describing a flourishing, radiant presence—its vitality manifesting in one’s countenance, hence \"offering their countenance.\" \"Halting their virtue\" refers to the auspicious stillness of an empty chamber, where stillness itself is the stopping point. *Yúhū* conveys a self-contented demeanor. \"Stern\" suggests solemn resolve, appearing worldly in its severity, yet within lies the unavoidable truth of *cuīhū*. Thus, it is said to resemble the world. *Áohū* implies grandeur, unyielding to worldly constraints, hence \"uncontrollable.\" \"Fond of seclusion\" means reluctance to speak; *liánhū* suggests closeness and secrecy. Before speaking, one seems unwilling to utter a word; after speaking, it is as if nothing was said—hence \"forgetful, as if losing their words.\" These two phrases convey a single idea: *mèn* describes a lowered, humble posture.\n\n\"Taking punishment as their body\"—the body is the foundation; \"wings\" are attachments. The sage says, \"Understand the five punishments to assist the five teachings,\" while here it is framed inversely: punishment as the root, ritual as the adjunct. *Chuòhū* describes leniency in severity, ensuring no discord with one’s heart. \"Moving through the world\" means using ritual to navigate custom. \"Time\" refers to employing wisdom—acting only when unavoidable in response to affairs. \"Following virtue\" means adhering to the natural power of heaven, effortlessly and without force. It is like climbing a small hill: those with feet can reach it on their own, yet others assume it requires strenuous effort. This illustrates the effortless attainment of the Way. A hill is a small mountain.\n\nThus, whether one favors or disfavors something, it is one and the same—unity in its singularity, yet also in its lack of unity. To be one is to align with heaven; to lack unity is to align with humanity. Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—this is the mark of the true person. \"One\" signifies spontaneity, the workings of creation. Favor and disfavor are simply likes and dislikes. Unity lies in their sameness; lack of unity in their difference. Yet both like and dislike exist within the bounds of creation, hence \"its unity\" and \"its lack of unity.\" One who unifies likes and dislikes understands heaven; one who sees them as distinct understands only humanity. To let humanity overcome heaven is impossible, as is letting heaven overcome humanity. The true person has no likes or dislikes, no distinctions between heaven and humanity, but simply follows the natural course. This is what the Buddhists call \"abandoning both existence and nonexistence,\" and what Laozi refers to as \"both returning to the mystery.\" Thus, it is said that heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—this is the unity of both one and not-one. \"One\" is the great master.\n\nLife and death are like the alternation of night and day—a constant of heaven. That which humans cannot control is the nature of all things. They revere heaven as a father and cherish their own bodies—how much more should they value that which transcends even this? They consider having a ruler better than having none and willingly die for such a ruler—how much more should they value the true? Life and death are like day and night, as the *Yìjīng* says: \"Understand the Way of day and night, and you will know.\" *Qíng* (nature) is reality—the inherent principle of heaven and earth, of the myriad things, beyond human control. This is called fate, called heaven. These lines clarify the meaning of \"one and not-one\" through the inevitability of life and death. Father and ruler are the most revered and beloved in the human world, yet the greatness of the Way surpasses even them. Thus, it is said that the Way can serve as the father of all fathers, for within it resides the true ruler—*zhuó*, lofty and unattainable; *zhēn*, the natural. These words remind us that while people know rulers and fathers, they fail to recognize the Way as the great master.\n\nWhen springs dry up, fish find themselves stranded on land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam. Yet is it not better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes? Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and be transformed by the Way. The great clod bears me in form, labors me in life, eases me in old age, and rests me in death. Thus, to perfect my life is to perfect my death.\n\n*Xiāngxǔ* and *xiāngrú* describe fish facing one another, moistening each other with breath and foam. Stranded on land, their mutual aid is inferior to the forgetfulness of rivers and lakes—a metaphor for the inferiority of worldly action compared to embodying the Way through non-action. The line \"praising Yao and condemning Jie\" may seem unconventional, yet its insight lies in self-attainment: without Jie, there is no Yao; without decline, no rise; without evil, no good; without slander, no praise. Praise and slander, rise and decline, good and evil—all arise in mutual dependence. Rather than distinguishing between them, it is better to forget both and entrust them to spontaneity. Entrusting to spontaneity is to be transformed by the Way. The Buddhists say, \"All dharmas are equal, without high or low,\" and \"Abandon both existence and nonexistence,\" and \"The great Way is not difficult; only avoid picking and choosing\"—all expressing this idea.\n\nThe phrase \"Two mud oxen fight, entering the sea—no news to this day\" is most excellent. The great clod is heaven and earth. Form gives rise to life, and life cannot be without labor. In old age, when sinews and strength wane, one naturally finds ease. *Xī* means rest. To \"perfect my life\" is to preserve my body—this is the meaning of \"Hearing the Way in the morning, one may die in the evening without regret.\"\n\nHiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh seems secure, yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unaware will not perceive it. Even hiding the small within the large has its vulnerabilities, but if one hides the world within the world, there is no escape—this is the great truth of all things. Even those who assume human form delight in it, yet the myriad transformations have no end. How immeasurable is their joy! Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot escape and abides in their enduring presence. Excelling in premature death, excelling in old age, excelling in beginnings, excelling in endings—people emulate this, let alone the myriad things bound to it and the single transformation they await.\n\nOne who unifies their likes and dislikes aligns with heaven; one who distinguishes them aligns with humanity. Neither overcoming heaven with humanity nor overcoming humanity with heaven is possible. The true person has no likes or dislikes, no distinctions between heaven and humanity, but simply follows the natural course. This is what the Buddhists call \"abandoning both existence and nonexistence,\" and what Laozi refers to as \"both returning to the mystery.\" Thus, it is said that heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—this is the unity of both one and not-one. \"One\" is the great master.\n\nThe boat hidden in the ravine, the mountain concealed in the marsh—one might call this secure concealment, yet there are times when they are lost. At midnight, a powerful force carries them away, and the deluded do not know. This speaks of the workings of creation. To carry them off and lose them is to speak of human schemes, however deep and secret, yet at times they cannot be freely controlled. This is like forging iron to make a door sill, only to see someone clap their hands and laugh—such is the ignorance of the deluded.\n\nSmall and large refer to the boat and ravine, the mountain and marsh. The vastness of the ravine can conceal a boat; the vastness of the marsh can conceal a mountain. To conceal the small within the large is fitting. Yet there is still escape and loss. To conceal the world within the world is to entrust it to nature. All beneath heaven entrusted to heaven leaves no room for escape. This is the great truth of all things.\n\nPeople delight in having form, yet do not know that the human body undergoes a thousand transformations—how can one know where it will end? If one could truly know this, then the myriad things would be complete within me, heaven and earth would be one with me—how boundless would such joy be!\n\nThe sage roams the mind in accordance with nature, thus neither gaining nor losing. This is what is meant by \"roaming where things cannot escape, yet all are preserved\"—excelling in premature death, excelling in old age, excelling in beginnings, excelling in endings. This is the work of creation. \"Excelling\" means \"to be capable.\" Even ordinary people emulate this—how much more so the Dao, to which the myriad things are bound, and upon which the single transformation depends? This is what is called the Great Master.\n\nEach passage rises higher than the last—this is the style of Zhuangzi. The words of sages and worthies would be plain and simple by comparison.\n\nThe Dao has essence and trustworthiness, is without action and without form. It can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted. Before there was heaven and earth, it existed from ancient times. It is spirit-like, divine, giving birth to heaven and earth. It is prior to the Supreme Ultimate yet not exalted; beneath the six directions yet not lowly. Before heaven and earth were born, it was not long in duration; older than antiquity, it is not aged.\n\nEarlier, I did not speak of the word \"Dao,\" but now I raise it to discuss the Great Master. Essence is reality; trustworthiness is also reality. Without action, there is no place to begin; without form, there is no tangible substance. It can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen—these two phrases are incomprehensible to those who do not know the Dao. Guan Yinzi has a chapter that elucidates the meaning of \"transmission\" well. \"Self-originating, self-rooted\" traces back to its beginning. Tracing the origin of this Dao, it already existed before heaven and earth—this is called the Supreme Ultimate without polarity. The traces of creation, the divine and the imperial—what enables them to be spirit-like is this Dao. Heaven and earth also come into being through the Dao. As the *Book of Changes* says, \"The Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the Two Modes\"—this is it. It is neither exalted nor lowly, neither long in duration nor aged.\n\nFu Xi obtained it and thereby harnessed heaven and earth; Fuxi obtained it and thereby embraced the mother of qi. The Northern Dipper obtained it and thus remains unerring through the ages; the sun and moon obtained it and thus remain unceasing through the ages. Kanpi obtained it and thereby embraced Kunlun; Feng Yi obtained it and thereby roamed the great rivers. Jianwu obtained it and thereby dwelled on the great mountain; the Yellow Emperor obtained it and thereby ascended to the cloudy heavens. Zhuanxu obtained it and thereby dwelled in the dark palace; Yuqiang obtained it and thereby stood at the North Pole. The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and thereby sat in Shaoguang. None knew its beginning, none knew its end. Pengzu obtained it and thereby lived from the time of Youyu to the Five Hegemons; Fu Yue obtained it and thereby assisted Wu Ding, ruling the world, riding the eastern tail of the Azure Dragon and aligning with the ranks of stars.\n\nFrom Fu Xi onward, there are thirteen instances of \"obtained\"—all speak of obtaining this Dao and then being able to do such things. Fu Xi was an ancient emperor-king; \"harnessing heaven and earth\" means ordering the cosmos. The mother of qi is primordial qi; \"embracing\" means uniting yin and yang within oneself—this is the origin of the practices of those who cultivate refinement. Kanpi is the mountain spirit who embraced Kunlun; Feng Yi is the water spirit. Jianwu is the spirit of Mount Tai; the Yellow Emperor’s ascent to the cloudy heavens refers to the affair at Mount Dinghu. The dark palace is like the present-day realm of the Great Clarity. Yuqiang is the northern deity; Shaoguang is the dwelling of immortals. The phrase \"none knew its beginning, none knew its end\" conveys the same meaning, though the sentences vary in length—this is a matter of literary technique. Among these thirteen phrases, the sun, moon, and Dipper are interspersed, and Pengzu and Fu Yue are cited as evidence afterward—this is where Zhuangzi’s brush surpasses conventional rules and cannot be measured by the standards of the sages’ writings. One must regard it with a different perspective.\n\nNanbo Zikui asked Woman Crookback, “You are advanced in years…”\n\n\"Why then does your complexion resemble that of a child?\"\n\n\"I have heard the Dao,\" she replied.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, \"May I learn it?\"\n\n\"Alas, how could you? You are not the right person. Now, Pulian Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage; I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might truly become a sage. If not, even imparting the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. Yet I still guarded and instructed him. After three days, he was able to put the world outside himself. Once the world was outside himself, I guarded him again for seven days, and then he was able to put things outside himself. Once things were outside himself, I guarded him again for nine days, and then he was able to put life outside himself. Once life was outside himself, he could attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, he could perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, he could transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, he could enter the realm beyond death and life. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life does not live. As a thing, it sends nothing away, welcomes nothing, destroys nothing, and completes nothing. Its name is *Yingning*—*Yingning* is that which attains completion through disturbance.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, \"From whom did you alone hear this?\"\n\nShe replied, \"I heard it from the son of *Fumo*; the son of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*; the grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*; *Zhanming* heard it from *Niexu*; *Niexu* heard it from *Xuyi*; *Xuyi* heard it from *Yu’ou*; *Yu’ou* heard it from *Xuanfang*; *Xuanfang* heard it from *Canliao*; *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*.\"\n\nZikui and Woman Crookback are both allegorical figures. To be advanced in years yet possess the complexion of a child—this is the teaching of present-day cultivators. The distinction between the talent of a sage and the Dao of a sage is finely drawn in these two phrases; none but Zhuangzi could have expressed it. Before him, no one had done so. Only the Five Emperors, the Three Kings, Yi Yin, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius possessed both Dao and talent. The three, seven, and nine days need not be rigidly parsed; they merely signify one stage surpassing the next. To \"put life outside oneself\" is to forget one’s body. \"Morning clarity\" is the luminous qi of dawn, as clear as the open sky in one’s breast. \"Perceiving the solitary\" is to see for oneself what others cannot. \"Transcending past and present\" is to be beyond life and death. Here, he inverts the terms: that which \"kills life\" does not die, and that which \"gives life\" does not live—this is his customary method of stirring the brush. Though it may kill, it is not death; though it may give life, it is not life. *Jiang* means \"to send off.\" To send nothing away, welcome nothing, destroy nothing, and complete nothing is simply to follow nature. *Ying* means \"to disturb\"; though buffeted by disturbance and chaos, that which is constant remains undisturbed. Only after disturbance does its tranquility become evident, hence the name *Yingning*—\"tranquility through disturbance.\" *Zhe* means \"that which\"; it is through disturbance that completion is attained. The nine \"heard from\" phrases are truly extraordinary. *Fumo* refers to writing, for words are recorded in books and bamboo slips. *Luosong* means to recite while encompassing the text, reading it forward and backward like a child begetting a grandchild, hence the use of \"son\" and \"grandson\" below. *Zhan* means \"to see\"; to see clearly is called *Zhanming*. *Nie* is the same as *nie* (\"to whisper\"); to affirm with words is called *Niexu*. *Yi* means \"to employ\"; *Xu* means \"to await\"—one may await the right moment to act, hence *Xuyi*. *Yu* means \"to sing\"; when words are insufficient, one sings them. *Yu* is an exclamation, expressing the joy of self-attainment.\n\nThese several phrases suggest that the Dao is attained through reading and reflection, giving rise to many names. Though wondrous and extraordinary, it ultimately returns to the workings of creation—guarding the primal beginning of qi, the nameless origin. This \"beginning\" is itself the beginning of no-beginning, what is called \"having a beginning.\" There is that which has not yet begun to have a beginning, and that which has not yet begun to have what has not yet begun to have a beginning. This meaning implies that though the Dao may be grasped through texts, it is in truth what our nature and heaven inherently possess.\n\nZisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai spoke among themselves, saying: \"Who can take non-being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone? Who knows that death and life, existence and cessation, are one body? We would befriend such a one.\" The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord; thus they became friends.\n\nSoon after, Ziyu fell ill. Zisi went to inquire of him, saying: \"How great! That which fashions all things would make me like this—hunched and crooked, my back humped, my five organs protruding upward, my chin buried in my navel, my shoulders towering above my crown, my nape pointing to the sky. The qi of yin and yang is in disarray, yet my heart remains untroubled.\" He paced back and forth before a well and said: \"Alas! That which fashions all things would again make me like this—hunched and crooked!\" Zisi said: \"Do you resent it?\"\n\nHe replied: \"Why should I resent it? If, little by little, it were to transform my left arm into a rooster, I would use it to mark the hours of the night. If, little by little, it were to transform my right arm into a crossbow, I would use it to hunt owls for roasting. If, little by little, it were to transform my tailbone into a wheel and my spirit into a horse, I would mount it and ride—why ever change steeds?\n\nMoreover, to gain is to meet the moment; to lose is to follow the flow. At peace with the moment and dwelling in accord, sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients called 'suspended release.' Yet if one cannot release oneself, things will bind one fast. Furthermore, things have never triumphed over Heaven for long—why should I resent it?\"\n\nHead, spine, and tailbone are but the beginning, middle, and end of the same. From nothing comes nothing, and only then does being arise. Once being exists, life and death follow. \"Their hearts in perfect accord\" means each awakened to the same truth and so harmonized, flowing in mutual accord.\n\n\"How great!\" speaks to the vastness of the Creator. \"Hunched and crooked\" describes the appearance of illness. \"Curved and stooped\" depicts a bent body; \"humped back\" refers to sores on the back. The \"five tubes\" are where sores erupt. \"Chin buried in the navel\" and \"shoulders towering above the crown\" both describe the deformity of his afflicted frame. \"Topknot pointing to the sky\" means the hair knot is exposed at the crown. When the qi of yin and yang fall out of harmony, illness arises—hence \"in disarray.\" Yet his heart remained \"untroubled,\" unburdened by his condition. \"Paced back and forth\" describes his halting gait as he approached the well, where he saw his reflection and sighed: \"That which fashions all things would again make me like this—hunched and crooked!\" \"Do you resent it?\" was Zisi’s playful question.\n\nShould it be so—this gradual transformation—then this single \"should\" is most extraordinary. The very words \"should it be\" and \"gradually\" are themselves wondrous. Should the Creator, little by little, transform my body into some other thing, I would still make use of it as it is. This is the meaning of following the Dao of creation without preference or aversion. Though spoken in parable, it holds its own truth. To gain in time is to follow the Master’s advent; to lose in time is to follow the Master’s departure. This, too, speaks to the principle of life and death. \"Countenance unbound\" describes a heart without attachment. If one clings to things, one cannot free oneself—hence \"cannot untie the knot.\" How could the myriad things overcome Heaven? All this is the meaning of resting in spontaneity. The spontaneous Heaven is the Great Master.\n\nLe Xuan once said: \"The thirty-two chapters of *Zhuangzi* are but the two words *ziran* (spontaneity).\"\n\nPresently, Zilai fell ill, gasping for breath as death approached. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zili went to inquire and shouted: \"Begone! Do not disturb the transformation!\" Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to Zilai: \"How wondrous! The Creator—what will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you the liver of a rat? The arm of an insect?\"\n\nZilai replied: \"A child follows the commands of father and mother, whether east or west, south or north. Yet the commands of yin and yang are even more binding than those of parents. Now, as death draws near and I refuse to heed it, I would be resisting. What fault is theirs? The Great Clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.\n\nNow, a great smith smelts metal, and the metal leaps forth, saying, 'I must become a *Moye* sword!' The smith would surely deem it an inauspicious metal. Yet once it takes human form and declares, 'I am a man! I am a man!'—the Creator would surely deem it an inauspicious being. Now, if we take Heaven and Earth as the great furnace and the Creator as the great smith, where could we go and not be content?\" He then fell into a deep sleep and awoke with a start.\n\nWhen Master Zeng changed his mat, his words were as such—those of a sage or worthy. Yet when Zhuangzi expounded this discourse, it was with the voice of a hero, one who scolds and silences, one whose very presence makes wives and children flee in haste. The startling shock! To speak of one about to transform into a rat’s liver or an insect’s limb—things of the smallest measure—is like the saying of Zhaozhou after the fire: reduced to a single stalk of reeds. Yet the prose is marvelous: \"Only follow the command\"—if I refuse to heed, I resist and rebel, an earlier metaphor showing that no created thing can overcome Heaven. The analogy of smelted metal is likewise extraordinary. Jia Yi said, \"Yin and yang are the coals, the myriad things the copper,\" all drawn from this very idea. If metal could speak, if man could claim, \"I am a man!\"—the Creator would surely deem it monstrous. The Creator’s view of man is no different from the great smith’s view of metal. Who but Zhuangzi could craft such parables? *Chengran* describes the state of deep slumber; *quran* the state of sudden awakening. To take life as slumber and death as awakening—these six words thus conclude the preceding passage, where the false and the real intertwine in wondrous fashion.\n\nZi Sanghu, Mengzi Fan, and Zi Qin Zhang were three friends who said to one another: \"Who can join together in non-joining, act together in non-acting? Who can ascend the heavens, roam the mists, twist and turn through the boundless, forgetting one another in life, without end or limit?\" The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord. Thus they became friends.\n\nAfter some time, Zi Sanghu died. Before he was encoffined, Confucius, hearing of it, sent Zigong to assist with the rites. One of the two friends wove a funeral garland while the other played the zither, and together they sang in harmony: \"Alas, Sanghu! Alas, Sanghu! You have returned to your true nature, while we remain as men—oh!\" Zigong hurried forward and said, \"May I ask whether it is proper to sing before the corpse?\" The two looked at each other and smiled, saying, \"What does he know of the meaning of ritual?\"\n\nTo join together in non-joining is to join without attachment of the heart. To act together in non-acting is to act without deliberate action.\n\nThe spirit of leaping and bounding knows no limit or end. To ascend the heavens and wander in the mists is to roam beyond the realm of things. \"To join in forgetting life without end or limit\" means precisely what is said elsewhere: \"not forgetting one’s beginning, not seeking one’s end.\" Their phrase \"not forgetting\" and this phrase \"forgetting\" both reduce to the five words \"not seeking one’s end.\" *Moran* describes the appearance of emptiness and stillness; *youjian* means \"after some time.\"\n\n\"To go and assist with the rites\" is like helping Yuan Rang wash the inner coffin. *Bianqu* means weaving a funeral mat. \"One wove a mat, one played the zither\" refers to Mencius Fan and Ziqin Zhang. *Yi* is an exclamatory particle. *Jielai* is the opening phrase of the singers’ song. \"Returned to his true nature\" means \"returned to his original state.\" \"While we remain as men—oh!\" is as if, upon suddenly hearing the bells and drums from above, one realizes another day has passed in this floating life—such are the marvels of this text’s style.\n\n\"Meaning of ritual\" refers to the essence of ritual propriety. Though Zhuangzi speaks in parables, the *Book of Rites* records Yuan Rang’s \"badger-head\" song, showing that between heaven and earth, from ancient times, there have always been those who practiced a learning of detachment from the world. People today say Buddhism first entered China during Emperor Ming’s reign, unaware that such people existed long before Buddhism.\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius: \"What manner of men were they? They cultivated nothingness, disregarded their physical forms, sang before the corpse without changing countenance—what should we call them?\" Confucius said: \"They wander beyond the bounds of the world, while I wander within. Outer and inner do not meet, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how narrow I was! They roam as companions of the Creator, moving within the single qi of heaven and earth. To them, life is an excrescent growth, a hanging tumor; death is the bursting of an abscess. If this is so, how could they know where life and death, before and after, reside? Borrowing from other things, entrusting themselves to shared forms, they forget their livers and gallbladders, neglect their ears and eyes, reversing and repeating beginnings and ends without discerning their origins. Vaguely they wander beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action—how could they be muddled by worldly rituals to please the eyes and ears of the crowd?\"\n\n\"Cultivated nothingness\" means having no virtuous conduct. \"What should we call them?\" is like asking, \"What name fits them?\" \"Beyond the bounds\" and \"within the bounds\" correspond to what Buddhists call \"worldly dharma\" and \"supra-worldly dharma.\" Since their aims differ, sending you to offer condolences was my mistake. Hence: \"Outer and inner do not meet, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how narrow I was!\"\n\n\"Companions of the Creator\" means befriending the Creator. \"Moving within the single qi of heaven and earth\" means roaming in the Creator’s beginning. \"Excrescent growth, hanging tumor\" compares the body to a superfluous thing in heaven and earth; one must burst and drain it to be satisfied—this is the idea of \"life wearies me, death gives me rest.\" \"Borrowing from other things\" refers to the *Round Awakening*’s discourse on earth, water, fire, and wind; the four great elements combine to form the body, hence \"entrusting themselves to shared forms.\" Even the liver, gallbladder, ears, and eyes are not self-aware—this is the meaning of forgetting the body. \"Reversing and repeating beginnings and ends without discerning their origins\" means tracing beginnings and endings without seeing their source. *Mangran* describes the appearance of being lost and without knowledge. \"Beyond the dust and grime\" means beyond the bounds. \"Work of non-action\" means naturalness. *Kuikuiran* describes the muddled state of acting for worldly eyes and ears—this is Laozi’s idea of \"ritual as a forced display for the world.\" \"Observing\" means demonstrating.\n\nZigong said: \"Then what path does the Master follow?\" Confucius said: \"I am one of Heaven’s punished people. Nevertheless, I share this with you.\" Zigong said: \"May I ask about this path?\" Confucius said: \"Fish come together in water; men come together in the Dao. Those who come together in water dig ponds to provide for themselves; those who come together in the Dao live settled lives without effort. Hence it is said: 'Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; men forget one another in the arts of the Dao.'\"\n\nZigong said: \"May I ask about the *jiren*?\" Confucius said: \"The *jiren* is one who is *ji* among men but equal to Heaven. Hence it is said: 'Heaven’s petty man is man’s gentleman; man’s gentleman is Heaven’s petty man.'\"\n\n\"What path does the Master follow?\" means: Does the Master follow the path beyond or within the bounds? \"Heaven’s punished people\" refers to the earlier \"Heaven punishes, yet how can it be undone?\"—meaning I cannot be a man of the outer path. \"I share this with you\" means I wish to speak with you of the joys of the outer path. \"May I ask about this path?\" means \"May I ask its reason?\" \"Fish come together in water\" is like \"moistening one another with foam\"—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. \"Dig ponds to provide\" means being content with whatever water one has. Those who attain the Dao live according to their allotment, settled without effort—without effort, without action. The *jiren* is *ji*, meaning unique. *Ji* means a solitary person. *Mou* means \"to match.\" *Ji* means not pairing with men but matching Heaven. If Heaven considers one a gentleman, men consider him a petty man; if men consider one a gentleman, Heaven considers him a petty man. Zhuangzi’s \"gentleman\" contains a tone of mockery toward the sages, for rites, music, laws, and measures do not arise naturally—only by breaking measuring cups and scales to stop men’s striving can one be Heaven’s gentleman. This is also an overly lofty argument born of indignation at the world’s corruption.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"When Mengsun Cai’s mother died, he wept without tears, his heart was not grieved, and he did not mourn during the funeral rites. Though lacking these three, he was considered skilled in mourning—was there truly in Lu someone who gained fame without substance?\" Yan Hui found this strange. Confucius said: \"Mengsun’s family has fully realized it, advanced in understanding. They wished to simplify but could not—yet they have already simplified. Mengsun does not know why he lives, does not know why he dies, does not know why to go before, does not know why to go after. If he transforms into things and awaits the transformations he does not know, is it not so? And if he is about to transform, how could he know it is not yet transformed? If he is about to not transform, how could he know it is already transformed? I and you are still dreaming, not yet awakened!\"\n\n\"In Lu\" means one who was renowned in the state for skill in mourning. *Yi* means \"always\"—as in \"I have always found this strange.\" \"Advanced in understanding\" means advancing in understanding the Dao. \"Wished to simplify but could not\" means that in funeral rites, even matters like weeping, they wished to simplify but could not. Though they wished to simplify, what they did was already very simple, hence \"they have already simplified.\" \"Does not know why he lives, does not know why he dies\" is the same as \"reversing and repeating beginnings and ends without discerning their origins.\" \"Go before\" means beginning; \"go after\" means end. Following the transformations of creation to become things, hence \"if he transforms into things and awaits the transformations he does not know.\" This means letting things take their natural course. *Yihu* is an exclamatory particle. If one lets things take their natural course, how can one know whether they are about to transform, already transformed, or not transformed? These are all stirring, uplifting words. Since he understood the Dao and could let things take their natural course, why should I find it strange? This means I am still dreaming, not yet awakened.\n\nMoreover, he possessed a startling form yet suffered no harm to his heart; he had a morning dwelling yet no emotional death. The Mengsun family simply awoke—when others wept, he wept too—this was his *so-it-is*.\n\nThat which startles the form refers to the changes of age from youth to old age. Though these changes may be startling, his heart remained at ease and untroubled, hence \"no harm to the heart.\" *Dwelling* means abode; *morning* means life. Life and death are like morning and night. Knowing that the dwelling of life is transient, even death is not truly death, hence \"no emotional death.\" *Emotion* here means reality. \"Simply awoke—when others wept, he wept too\" means he followed the crowd. This was where he wished to simplify yet could not. \"This was his *so-it-is*\"—these six characters are most extraordinary, speaking of the wonder of his self-attainment. Thus, though he wished to simplify, he could not, and so followed the crowd in weeping. This passage is most difficult to interpret, and in many versions, the character *nai* (乃) from the previous sentence and *qie* (且) from the following sentence should properly be combined. The two characters together are quite amusing.\n\n\"Moreover, you and I are merely ears to one another. How could you know what I mean by 'my self'?\" Here, *qie* (且) is simply the character *qie* with an added *ye* (也), as seen repeatedly in earlier passages. *Wu* (吾) means \"I.\" Now, since you and I together find it strange, how can you know what I truly mean by \"my self\"? Thus, \"Moreover, you and I are merely ears to one another. How could you know what I mean by 'my self'?\" Zhuangzi’s writing is largely like this—stirring and uplifting. Without a unique perspective, it is difficult to read.\n\n\"Moreover, were you dreaming of being a bird soaring through the heavens or a fish diving into the depths? Do you not recognize that the speaker now is awake or still dreaming? Joy comes before laughter, and laughter cannot keep pace with it. When all is arranged and one departs, transformation enters the vastness of the singular sky.\"\n\nDreaming of birds or fish merely echoes the earlier passage about the butterfly. Is the speaker now awake or still dreaming? Is this not the same as \"Was it the butterfly dreaming of Zhuang Zhou, or Zhuang Zhou dreaming of the butterfly?\" When one’s intent is set upon something, there are times when laughter cannot keep pace—this speaks of the intensity of joy. It is like Du Fu’s line: \"Only when the shock subsided did I wipe away my tears.\" Mr. Lexuan also said: \"By the time I could weep, the shock had already passed.\" This speaks of shock. *Zaoshi* (造适) means joy.\n\nThough shock and joy differ, their meaning of \"not keeping pace\" is the same. \"Arranging\" refers to preparation. Laughter arises from things, as if things offer laughter to me—this laughter emerges naturally, requiring no arrangement. Thus, it is said: \"laughter cannot keep pace with the offering,\" and \"arrangement cannot keep pace.\" Though the character *pai* (排) appears in both lines, its rhetorical force differs; one cannot link them to the preceding word. Between the workings of creation, all matters are preordained—life and death, poverty and prosperity, gain and loss, fortune and misfortune—all are already fixed. I need only accept what is arranged, follow the transformations of creation, and thus enter into the subtlety of creation itself.\n\n*Liaotian yi* (\"the vastness of the singular sky\") is but another name for creation—*liao* means \"boundless.\" The \"one\" in *liaotian yi* echoes the earlier \"what it favors\" and \"what it does not favor,\" for the One is unity. Such coinages are but Zhuangzi’s playful turns of phrase.\n\nYi’erzi visited Xu You. Xu You said: \"What has Yao given you?\"\nYi’erzi replied: \"Yao told me, ‘You must personally practice benevolence and righteousness, and clearly distinguish right from wrong.’\"\nXu You said: \"Then why have you come? Yao has already branded you with benevolence and righteousness, and mutilated you with right and wrong. How will you wander the paths of carefree abandon, uninhibited freedom, and ceaseless transformation?\"\nYi’erzi said: \"Even so, I wish to roam its outskirts.\"\nXu You said: \"No. The blind cannot partake in the beauty of brows and eyes, nor the blind musician in the splendor of blue and yellow embroidery.\"\nYi’erzi said: \"Yet Wu Zhuang lost her beauty, Ju Liang his strength, and the Yellow Emperor his wisdom—all in the space between the furnace and the hammer. How do we know the Creator will not erase my brands, mend my mutilations, and let me ride perfection to follow you, Master?\"\nXu You said: \"Ah, who can say? Let me tell you the broad strokes. My teacher! O my teacher! Who fashions the ten thousand things yet claims no righteousness, whose blessings reach ten thousand generations yet claims no benevolence, who is older than high antiquity yet claims no age, who covers heaven and bears the earth, carving and sculpting all forms yet claims no skill—this is the realm in which I wander.\nWhat Yao gave you was but instruction, the clear distinction of right and wrong—nothing more.\"\n\n\"為助語也\" and \"軹亦助語也\" serve as emphatic particles. \"奚來為\" means \"why must you come?\" \"何必來也\" means \"there was no need to come.\" \"黥劓䏣污汝也\" means \"the brands and mutilations defile you.\" \"猶言汝䏣他教壞了\" means \"it is as if you were corrupted by other teachings.\" \"遙蕩恣睢轉徙\" echoes the earlier \"挠挑无极\" and \"彷徨尘垢之外\"—\"遙蕩\" means \"unrestrained,\" \"恣睢\" means \"unbridled,\" and \"轉徙\" means \"shifting and changing.\" \"藩者藩籬也\" means \"a fence is a barrier.\" This says: \"I dare not seek the inner chamber but would be content to reach the fence\"—that is, I would be content to hear just the broad strokes. The following analogy of the blind man refers to you having no capacity to hear the Dao.\n\n\"無莊\" was an ancient beauty, and \"據梁\" an ancient warrior. This means: if you possessed the Dao, you could transform me so that the beautiful would forget their beauty, the brave their bravery, and the wise their wisdom—shedding old habits and awakening of themselves in the space between your turning and shifting. Hence it says: \"all in the space between the furnace and the hammer.\" \"乘行也\" means \"to ride and follow.\" \"成\" is the principle of spontaneity. \"去我前日之習而行乎自然\" means \"to abandon my former habits and follow spontaneity in serving you, Master.\" Hence it says: \"erase my brands, mend my mutilations, and let me ride perfection to follow you, Master.\"\n\n\"噫\" is an exclamation. \"未可知者\" means \"it is not yet certain\"—that is, it is not yet clear whether you can truly do this.\n\nO my Master!\n\nThe following lines now reveal the title of this chapter: *The Great and Venerable Teacher*. It speaks of \"powdering the ten thousand things yet remaining unnameable by craft,\" and \"bestowing grace upon the ages yet remaining unnameable by benevolence\"—for it describes acting without action, spontaneity unfolding of itself, where I harbor no deliberate intent and thus cannot be named by such terms. The *Book of Changes* says: \"It drums the ten thousand things yet shares no sage’s cares\"—this is the same meaning. It has endured since high antiquity, existing before heaven and earth. Through a thousand ages, ten thousand ages, it remains thus—how could it be named by youth or age? Above, it is what heaven covers: sun, moon, and stars. Below, it is what earth bears: mountains, rivers, hills, and mounds. How much artistry is here! Consider how heaven revolves to the left, the fixed stars clinging to it unmoving, while the sun, moon, and five planets turn to the right, some swift, some slow, some flowing, some hidden. Rivers, cliffs, waters, stones—how many wonders! All are wrought by the Creator. Amid the manifold forms, like the hundred grasses and myriad trees, how many marvels—what else but artistry? Yet we cannot simply call it \"artistry.\"\n\nAll these lines depict the Dao of spontaneity. Roaming the heart in spontaneity, one sees heaven and earth born together with me, the ten thousand things as one with me. Hence it says: \"This is the roaming I speak of.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"I have advanced.\"\nZhongni asked, \"What do you mean?\"\n\"I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness.\"\n\"That is good, but not yet sufficient.\"\n\nAnother day, they met again.\nYan Hui said, \"I have advanced.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I have forgotten ritual and music.\"\n\"That is good, but not yet sufficient.\"\n\nAnother day, they met again.\nYan Hui said, \"I have advanced.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I sit in forgetfulness.\"\nZhongni started and asked, \"What do you mean by sitting in forgetfulness?\"\nYan Hui replied, \"I cast off my limbs, dismiss my hearing and sight, leave my form, abandon my knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare—this is what I call sitting in forgetfulness.\"\nZhongni said, \"To merge is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy. And you are truly worthy! I would follow after you.\"\n\nThis passage borrows the name of Yanzi to depict the marvel of attaining the Dao—though even Zhuangzi in his time knew Yanzi as the second sage. The doctrine of \"sitting in forgetfulness\" is Zhuangzi’s teaching; to seek Yanzi through it is mistaken.\n\n\"Advanced\" means to have gained something. First benevolence and righteousness, then ritual and music—this implies ritual and music are higher than benevolence and righteousness. Here, Zhuangzi’s use of \"benevolence and righteousness\" refers only to love and aversion; all such terms differ from the sages’ meanings. First forgetting benevolence and righteousness, then forgetting ritual and music, is like \"setting aside the world, then the ten thousand things.\" As for sitting in forgetfulness, one forgets everything entirely—this is the moment when being and non-being are both transcended. The saying \"Now I have lost myself\" expresses the same idea. The limbs, ears...\n\nThe eyes and limbs all become unaware of themselves—hence the saying, \"limbs discarded, senses abandoned.\" To \"discard the body and abandon the limbs\" is to \"separate from form\"; to \"dismiss wisdom and abandon the senses\" is to \"go beyond knowledge.\" \"Great penetration\" is the Great Dao. The so-called sage is one who penetrates all things; *rui* (睿) means \"penetration,\" and *rui* makes one a sage. Observing these two characters, \"sitting in forgetfulness,\" one sees it is akin to the Chan school’s \"wall-gazing\"—a borrowed device. To be one with the Dao is to be without likes or dislikes; without likes or dislikes, one is transformed. Transformed, there is nothing to abide by, and the mind is born. Thus it is said: \"In oneness, there are no preferences; in transformation, there is no constancy.\" \"I follow after you\" means you surpass me, and I am left behind. \"Virtue\" here means superiority—superiority over others.\n\nWhen Ziyu and Zisang were friends, they were caught in the rain for ten days. Ziyu said, \"Zisang must be ill,\" and wrapped some rice to take to him. Arriving at Zisang’s door, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping, as Zisang plucked his zither. He cried, \"Father! Mother! Heaven! Man! Why can I not bear this voice?\" Then he hurriedly recited a poem. Ziyu entered and asked, \"Why do you sing this poem in such a manner?\" Zisang replied, \"I pondered who brought me to this extremity, but I could not find the answer. How could my parents wish me poverty? Heaven covers all without partiality; Earth bears all without partiality. How could Heaven and Earth wish me poverty? I sought the one who caused this, but I could not find them. Yet here I am at this extremity—it is fate!\"\n\nThis passage speaks only of poverty and success as matters of fate, crafting such words in a most extraordinary way. Fearing Zisang might fall ill from hunger, Ziyu said, \"You must be ill.\" In ancient times, when playing the zither, one always sang, as when Shun played the zither and sang *Nanfeng*. \"Like singing, like weeping\" describes the weakness of his strength, making his voice faint. \"Unable to bear the voice\" means he lacked the strength to produce sound. \"Hastily reciting the poem\" refers to the constrained emotion and cramped words—his singing was so disordered that he could only recite in fragments. \"How could my parents wish me poverty? How could Heaven and Earth wish me poverty?\" These lines are most exquisite. \"I sought the one who caused this but could not find them\"—if it is neither Heaven nor Earth, neither father nor mother, then who is responsible? Yet here I am at this extremity—it is fate! This meaning refers to the principle of spontaneity, which requires no effort, no deliberation, and stands above Heaven and Earth. Fate is the principle of spontaneity—it is *ming* (命), which is also *li* (理), the so-called \"Great Master.\" For scholars, having a teacher is a matter of service and obedience; when there is a Great Master, how can one not follow fate alone?\n\nReading this chapter of Zhuangzi, one sees that the *Li Ming* chapter of the *Liezi* does not compare. This is the seventh inner chapter, \"Fit for Emperors and Kings.\"\n\nThe Way of emperors and kings should harmonize and respond thus. Nie Que questioned Wang Ni four times, and four times Wang Ni professed ignorance. Thereupon Nie Que leapt up in great joy and went to inform Master Pu Yi. Master Pu Yi said: \"Only now do you understand? The Lord of Yu did not match the Lord of Tai. The Lord of Yu concealed virtue to entice others—he did gain people, yet never emerged from the realm of the unnatural. The Lord of Tai slept in tranquil ease, awoke with effortless grace, called himself a horse, called himself an ox. His knowledge was genuine, his virtue most true, and he never once entered the realm of the unnatural.\"\n\nResponding to four questions with four professions of ignorance—this is the meaning of the *Vimalakīrti Sūtra*, where non-speech is the gateway to non-duality. Pu Yi may also be called \"Clothed-in-Robes.\" The names and figures in Zhuangzi are often fictive, akin to the likes of Wu You and Master Wu Shi—there is no need for exhaustive debate. Nie Que grasped the meaning of non-speech, hence his joy in reporting it to Pu Yi. Pu Yi said, \"Only now do you understand?\"—meaning, \"You have only now awakened.\" *Er* (而) here means \"you.\" The Lord of Tai was an ancient emperor-king.\n\nHere the name refers to the lineage of the Great-Ting clan, while \"Zang Huai\" means \"binding the heart.\" To bind the heart with benevolence is also a way to win people—yet this does not transcend the level of Heaven alone, meaning he merely walks the path of Heaven. \"Non-human\" is Heaven. Thus it is said, \"he never once entered the realm of the unnatural,\" which is to say, \"he never went beyond this.\" Instead of saying \"Heaven,\" the text says \"non-human\"—this is but a flourish of its playful brush. His sleep was tranquil ease, his waking a state of effortless grace. Whether he called himself a horse or an ox, he left it unquestioned, letting others speak as they would. What he knew was genuine principle, his nature most true. His virtue resided within, wholly of Heaven’s truth. At this point, even the word \"Heaven\" falls short, for he followed the spontaneous and natural, transcending even the workings of creation. Thus it is said, \"he never once entered the realm of the unnatural.\" First \"exited,\" then \"entered\"—observe how the words are chosen. The Dao of the emperor-king is simply to follow the spontaneous and natural. The intent behind naming this chapter \"Responding to the Emperor\" lies precisely here.\n\nJian Wu met the madman Jie Yu. Jie Yu asked, \"What did Ri Zhongshi tell you?\"\nJian Wu replied, \"He told me that a ruler of men must establish standards, models, principles, and measures—who would dare not obey and be transformed?\"\nJie Yu said, \"This is deceptive virtue. In governing the world, it is like crossing the sea to dig a river or making a mosquito carry a mountain. The governance of the sage does not proceed until external matters are rectified; it merely relies on those capable of their tasks. Moreover, birds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and nets, while field mice burrow deep beneath sacred mounds to escape the peril of fumigation and digging. Yet these two creatures know nothing of such precautions.\" Jian Wu first met Ri Zhongshi and later met Jie Yu, so Jie Yu questioned him on this. *Jing* means constant, *shi* means model, and *yi* refers to the proper way of handling affairs.\n\n\"When it is said that 'standards, models, principles, and measures all proceed from oneself,' this means using one’s own person as the model for the world. 'To measure others' means to transform them. Using one’s own person as the model to transform the world—hence the saying, 'standards, models, principles, and measures all proceed from oneself.' *Jing*, *shi*, and *yi* in this context align with harmony and ease, while *du* is pronounced as 'crossing.' 'Who would dare not obey and be transformed?' means that the people all listen and submit to such transformation.\n\n'Deceptive virtue' refers to self-deception, not true virtue. To govern the world in this manner is as difficult as crossing the sea to dig a river or making a mosquito carry a mountain. 'Digging a river' here means dredging the Nine Rivers. 'Governing externally' means transforming through the mind, which leaves no trace, while transforming through the person leaves traces. 'Proceeding only after rectification' means acting in accordance with the principles of nature and destiny. 'Those capable of their tasks' means fully realizing these natural affairs. *Du hu* means 'decisively.' This is how governance is decisively carried out. Zhuangzi’s intent lies in non-action, hence his argument differs from that of our Confucians.\n\nBirds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and nets, while mice burrow deep beneath sacred mounds to escape fumigation and digging. This illustrates that those who leave traces inevitably bring trouble upon themselves. If one cannot practice the transformation of non-action and instead leaves traces, their ignorance is even greater than that of these two creatures. These two creatures are the bird and the mouse.\n\nTian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and arrived at the banks of the Liao River, where he encountered an unnamed man and questioned him, saying, 'May I ask how to govern the world?' The unnamed man replied, 'Begone, you rustic! Why do you ask such an inopportune question? I am about to become a companion to the Creator. If I grow weary of this, I shall ride the nebulous bird to soar beyond the Six Directions and wander in the land of Nothingness, dwelling in the boundless wilds. Why do you trouble my mind with questions about governing the world?'\n\nThe unnamed man continued, 'If you would still inquire about governing the world, direct your mind toward tranquility, harmonize your *qi* with the formless, follow the spontaneity of things, and refrain from imposing private interests—then the world will be governed. To ask about governing the world is already contrary to the Dao of non-action, hence I deem your question rustic and it has made me displeased.' *Bu yu* means displeased.\n\n'To become a companion to the Creator' means to dwell in the human world while following the spontaneity of the Creator. *Yan* means satiation. Having already grown satiated with wandering in the human world, one then wanders beyond the Creator. The 'nebulous bird' refers to the *qi* of emptiness and nothingness. The 'land of Nothingness' and the 'boundless wilds' both describe the realm of supreme emptiness.\n\n*He yi* means 'why.' The question about governing the world disturbed my mind, hence my displeasure. This *gan* character means to stir or provoke me. The *yi* character, according to Master Cui, also conveys the sense of 'why.' *Dan* means tranquility, and *mo* refers to the formless void. *Qi* here is akin to *xing* (nature). When the mind and nature both align with spontaneity, it is said that one 'directs the mind toward tranquility and harmonizes *qi* with the formless.' Earlier, it was said, 'Do not listen with the mind but listen with *qi*.' Here, *qi* should be understood as *xing* (nature). Follow the spontaneity of the Creator without imposing the mind, and the world will govern itself. Why concern oneself with governing the world? To have a mind is to harbor private interests.\"\n\nHere the Celestial Root asked again, and the Nameless One once more answered with words of truth. This figure called the \"Nameless One\" is but an empty fiction, a mere phantom—hence the later chapter speaks of \"parable, repetition, and borrowed words.\" When names like the Yellow Emperor, Confucius, Yanzi, or Jieyu the Madman are invoked, it is only to lend weight to the speaker’s own discourse. Thus, the \"Nameless One,\" \"Celestial Root,\" and \"Master Reed Garment\" are all such fictions.\n\nYangzi Ju visited Lao Dan and said, \"Suppose there were a man swift in movement, strong and resolute, penetrating in understanding, clear in perception, diligent in studying the Dao without weariness—could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?\"\n\nLao Dan replied, \"Such a one, in the eyes of the sage, is but a convict laborer, a craftsman bound by skill, one who wearies the body and startles the mind. Moreover, the patterned hides of tigers and leopards draw hunters; the agility of gibbons and the cunning of macaques bring those who would bind them; the terrier’s skill in seizing raccoons and monkeys invites the leash. Could such as these be compared to an enlightened king?\"\n\nYangzi Ju, dismayed, asked, \"Then may I inquire about the governance of an enlightened king?\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name is raised, yet things delight in themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of nothingness.\"\n\n*\"Suppose there were a man\"*—these words describe someone without naming him, a veiled mockery of Confucius.\n*\"Swift in movement\"*—quick and agile.\n*\"Strong and resolute\"*—firm and unyielding.\n*\"Penetrating in understanding\"*—keen in learning and vigorous in practice.\n*\"Things\"*—affairs.\n*\"Penetrating\"*—thorough.\n*\"Clear in perception\"*—seeing all things with emptiness and clarity.\n*\"Diligent in studying the Dao without weariness\"*—could such a one be compared to an enlightened king? That is, if one were to govern as a king, would such qualities suffice?\n*\"Convict laborer\"*—a prisoner subjected to penal servitude.\n*\"Changed\"*—altered, as in the term *\"successive changes\"* (referring to corvée labor).\n*\"Convict laborer\"*—an ancient term, akin to the Han dynasty’s *\"gathering firewood\"* (a euphemism for forced labor).\n*\"Bound by skill\"*—one whose craft ensnares them.\nThese two types—convict laborers exhaust their bodies, while those bound by skill alarm their minds. To study in such a way that both body and mind are wearied is no different from being a convict laborer or a craftsman ensnared by skill.\n*\"Startles the mind\"*—fills it with dread.\nTigers and leopards, with their patterned hides, attract hunters; the term *\"leash\"* refers to the means of restraint.\nThe agility of gibbons and the cunning of macaques, the terrier’s skill in seizing raccoons—all these invite the disaster of being bound. To possess abilities is to invite entanglement.\nThe phrase *\"seizing raccoons\"* also appears in the chapter *\"Heaven and Earth.\"* If governance through active effort could be the work of a king, then even the patterned hides of tigers and leopards could be compared to enlightened rule—this is the height of disparagement.\nThese three phrases are strikingly phrased:\n*\"His achievements cover the world yet seem not his own\"*—his work is accomplished without possession.\n*\"He transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him\"*—echoing the sentiment that though the realm is at peace, none know the emperor’s contribution.\n*\"Bestows\"*—grants, as in *\"Heaven bestows, Earth produces; clouds move, rain falls.\"* Though *\"bestow\"* and *\"grant\"* differ in tone, their meaning is the same.\n*\"No name is raised\"*—no one can name his achievements; the people have nothing to praise.\n*\"Things delight in themselves\"*—though no merit is claimed, things find their own joy, as in Han Yu’s words: *\"Men find their own contentment beyond rivers and lakes.\"*\n*\"Unfathomable\"*—beyond comprehension.\nThis is merely an elaboration of *\"nothingness.\"* *\"Stands in\"* is implied.\n\nThe unfathomable is but roaming in nothingness—where the brush dances and the drum beats. By and large, the preceding passages all expound the meaning of the chapter \"Responding to Emperors and Kings.\"\n\nIn Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew the life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death of men, predicting them by year, month, or day with godlike precision. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in haste. When Liezi saw him, he was enchanted in heart. Returning home, he told Master Huchi: \"At first I thought your Dao was supreme, but now I see there is something even more supreme.\"\n\nHuchi said: \"I have shown you only its form, not yet its reality—how could you have truly attained the Dao? With a flock of hens and no rooster, how could there be eggs? To present the Dao to the world with insistence is to invite trust. Thus, others can divine your fate. Whether by year, month, or day, near or far, the diviner’s words are all verified like a god’s. Those who flee do so in fear of his accuracy. To be enchanted in heart is to be inwardly convinced. 'Its form' refers to what is external, fully displayed; 'its reality' is what is internal, not yet exhausted. You have never fully witnessed its reality—how could you assume you have attained the Dao?\n\nThe word 'assume' implies mistaking what is not yet attained for attainment. Consider the tone of the phrase: only with both male and female can there be generation. Without a male, how could there be eggs? This line illustrates that without a heart, there are no traces. It is a metaphor for the heart not yet transformed, thus still perceptible in form. 'Insistence' means holding oneself high, believing one’s Dao to be above the world and demanding others’ trust. This is where traces remain—where transformation is incomplete—so the diviner can read you.\"\n\nHuchi then said: \"Bring him to me and let him observe me.\" The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huchi. Afterward, Ji Xian emerged and told Liezi: \"Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. It will not be ten days. I saw something strange: he was like damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered, weeping until his tears soaked his lapels, and reported this to Huchi. Huchi said: \"Just now I showed him the 'Earthly Pattern'—sprouting yet not stirring, not upright. He likely saw my 'Closed Virtue Mechanism.' 'Damp ashes' means his vital qi was nearly spent, like embers about to be extinguished. 'Earthly Pattern' is akin to the meditative observations of Chan practitioners—sprouting yet not truly sprouting. 'Not stirring' means unmoving; 'not upright' means indefinable. This 'not upright' echoes Mencius’ 'there must be action, yet do not fixate on it.' Only when there is movement yet no movement did the diviner mistake it for damp ashes. Ashes are living fire; damp ashes are fire about to die. 'Closed Virtue Mechanism' is another term for meditative observation—'virtue mechanism' refers to the impulse of life; 'closed' means sealed, unmoving. Thus, it appeared as if life were about to expire, and Ji Xian concluded he would not live.\"\n\nHuchi said: \"Bring him again.\" The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huchi again. Afterward, Ji Xian emerged and told Liezi: \"Fortunate is your master to have met me! He will recover—he is fully alive. I saw his 'Closed Potency.'\"\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Huchi. Huchi said: \"Just now I showed him 'Heaven and Earth'—where names and realities do not enter, and the mechanism stirs from the heels. He likely saw my 'Virtuous Mechanism.' 'Closed Potency' is movement within stillness; 'potency' is akin to 'mechanism,' but while 'mechanism' is subtle, 'potency' is more manifest. Within closure, the dynamic mechanism was revealed, so Ji Xian perceived full vitality. 'Heaven and Earth' is another term for observation—'Heaven’s Field' refers to the field above, not the earthly soil but the natural earth. This resembles how modern practitioners of self-cultivation refer to the space beneath the tongue as 'Heavenly Ford' and the top of the head as 'Mud Pill.' It signifies the impulse of life rising upward. 'Names and realities do not enter' means both being and non-being are transcended. 'The mechanism stirs from the heels' describes qi ascending from below, so subtle it is invisible. Thus, it is called the 'Virtuous Mechanism,' referring to the movement of one’s nature.\"\n\nHuchi said: \"Bring him again.\" The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huchi once more. Afterward, Ji Xian emerged and told Liezi: \"Your master is unsettled—I cannot divine him. Let him settle, and I will try again.\"\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Huchi. Huchi said: \"Just now I showed him 'Supreme Vastness, Nothing Overcomes'—he likely saw my 'Balanced Qi Mechanism.' 'Supreme Vastness, Nothing Overcomes' is another term for observation—'Supreme Vastness' is the Great Void; 'Nothing Overcomes' means it cannot be grasped. 'Balanced' means even, half. When the movement of the qi mechanism reaches equilibrium—half in motion, half at rest—Ji Xian perceived it as unsettled, for it was neither fully active nor fully still.\"\n\n\"When the *ni* fish coils, it forms a deep pool; when still water pools, it forms a deep pool; when flowing water pools, it forms a deep pool. There are nine names for deep pools—here, three are revealed.\"\n\n\"*Ni* fish coiling,\" \"still water,\" and \"flowing water\" are all terms for observation. Modern Buddhists use them as meditative states, while ancients regarded them as deep pools. Just as Guanyin has twelve observations, there are nine names for deep pools. \"Verified\" means confirmed: the coiling of the *ni* fish is one observation, still water another, flowing water a third. Only now does Huchi reveal that what he previously showed the diviner were all these deep pools. \"I have nine deep pools, and I have only shown him three\"—implying that his wondrous depths are not yet exhausted.\n\nThe character \"verified\" (*shen*) should be read as \"coiled\" (*pán*), not as in *Liezi*’s \"nine deep pools.\" Hong Zicheng’s claim that *Liezi* surpasses *Zhuangzi* may not be entirely accurate. If all nine deep pools were fully explained, it would no longer be extraordinary prose. That they can be exhausted yet remain inexhaustible is precisely the marvel of Zhuangzi’s writing. Only those who understand literary refinement will grasp this. This chapter originally had four sections, but the discussion of the nine deep pools is placed in the fourth—such is the art of textual expansion and contraction.\n\nHuchi said: \"Bring him again.\" The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huchi once more. Huchi stood, unsettled, and Ji Xian lost himself and fled. Huchi said: \"Pursue him.\" Liezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Huchi: \"He is gone—vanished. I could not reach him.\"\n\nHuchi said: \"Just now I showed him 'Not Yet Emerged from My Origin.' I met him with emptiness and compliance, so he knew not who or what I was. Thus, he took me for a withered reed, for drifting waves—hence his flight. 'Gone' and 'vanished' mean he could no longer perceive me. 'Not Yet Emerged from My Origin' is another term for observation. 'Empty' means void; 'compliance' means yielding, as if nothing were there, yet something were. Not knowing what it was, he called it 'who or what.' *Di* is read as *tui* (withered); 'withered reed' means collapsing; 'drifting waves' means surging. He saw me as neither emerging nor distinct, only as collapsing and surging—thus he lost himself and fled.\"\n\nThen Liezi, believing he had never truly begun to learn, returned home. For three years he did not venture out. He prepared meals for his wife as if feeding pigs, yet treated them as if feeding people. In his affairs, he took no personal part. He cast off refinement and returned to simplicity, standing alone like an uncarved block, his form present yet untouched by boundaries or divisions. Thus he remained to the end.\n\nFor his wife, he would take up the pestle at the hearth and cook in her stead, never leaving his post. \"Feeding pigs as if feeding people\" means gathering his spirit within, oblivious to all outward appearances. \"Taking no personal part in affairs\" means that though he engaged in tasks, he did so without self-awareness, as if not personally involved. \"Casting off refinement and returning to simplicity\" echoes the earlier idea of \"discarding the branches of the body and dismissing cleverness.\" \"Standing alone like an uncarved block\" is like a wooden figurine. *Feng* means boundaries; *zhen* means divisions. How could a form as simple as a wooden figurine possess such boundaries and divisions? \"Thus he remained to the end\" means he lived his life in this constant state—this unchanging constancy.\n\nBe not the host of fame, be not the storehouse of schemes, be not the bearer of tasks, be not the master of knowledge. Embrace the boundless and wander without trace. Exhaust what you have received from Heaven without claiming attainment—it is but emptiness, and that is all. The mind of the perfected person is like a mirror: it neither sends forth nor welcomes, responds yet does not retain. Thus it masters things without harm.\n\nHere, Zhuangzi once more expounds the principle of non-action. *Shi* means \"host\"; not taking fame as one’s master is the essence of \"not drawing near to fame.\" *Fu* means \"storehouse.\" Earlier, it was said, \"Do not scheme, do not plan\"—this is the same idea. To employ cleverness is to harbor intent in scheming; if one’s mind is set on planning, then planning becomes a storehouse. Where planning is unnecessary, the mind is free, hence \"be not the storehouse of schemes.\" Though affairs cannot be avoided, one should not take them as a personal burden, hence \"be not the bearer of tasks.\" Though one cannot be without knowledge, one should not take knowledge as one’s master, hence \"be not the master of knowledge.\" If the mind is fixed on anything, it becomes partial—these four \"nots\" are instructions for restraint, akin to the \"four forbearances\" in the *Analects*. *Ti* means \"to perceive\"; *cha* means \"to examine.\" Perceiving the Dao to its utmost, one’s mind wanders where there is no limit, no trace—hence \"embrace the boundless and wander without trace.\" *Zhen* means \"sign\"; *zhao* means \"beginning.\" \"Without trace\" is to be without beginning. Heaven endows us with this principle, and we exhaust it without claiming attainment—hence \"exhaust what you have received from Heaven without claiming attainment.\" To claim attainment is to approach the realm of traces. The Buddhist sutras speak of \"relying on illusion to awaken\"—this is the same idea. The passage culminates in the word \"emptiness,\" a forceful conclusion. Emptiness is spontaneity, free from attachment.\n\nThe mirror’s relation to things is this: beauty and ugliness come and go, yet the mirror reflects them without sending or welcoming. To send is to escort. To reflect form and see form, to reflect things and see things, is called \"responding.\" The mirror retains nothing, hence \"responds yet does not retain.\" The mind of the perfected person is like this, thus it is unobstructed by things—hence \"masters things without harm.\" The Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory—this is the meaning of \"masters.\" The several lines about the mirror clearly elucidate the earlier \"emptiness.\" Is the rhythm of this passage not extraordinary? Within its plainness lies divine artistry.\n\nThe Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Central Region was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. They conspired to repay his kindness, saying, \"All people have seven openings for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try boring them for him.\" Each day they bored one opening, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.\n\nThis is but a metaphor: cleverness can burden the body, so Zhuangzi depicts it thus. To discard the branches of the body and dismiss cleverness is to become Hundun. Though the tale is ordinary, the embellishment of \"boring one opening each day\" is a stroke of genius. Shu, Hu, and Hundun are all allegories—one must not cling to them literally, or one becomes a fool dreaming dreams. Hundun is primordial qi. The human body has seven openings: like a newborn, the ears, eyes, nose, and tongue are formed but lack knowledge—this is Hundun’s wholeness. When knowledge begins to sprout, with likes and dislikes, the openings are bored. Mencius said, \"The great person does not lose the heart of a newborn\"—this is Hundun unborrowed. Zhuangzi’s telling is strange and fantastical, yet the writing is extraordinary.\n\nThe thirty-two chapters of the *Zhuangzi* are divided into Inner and Outer sections. The Inner Chapters number seven, each titled with three characters. From \"Webbed Toes\" onward, only the first two or three characters of the opening line are used as titles, like the *Analects*’ \"Learning\" and \"Governance.\" The book itself makes no distinction of refinement or coarseness—Inner and Outer Chapters are of the same quality. This division is merely to stir the ages. Some Outer Chapters, however, do have passages that are more expansive, leading some to claim the Inner Chapters are refined and the Outer coarse. This is not so.\n\nOthers have arranged the seven Inner Chapters in order, saying: First, one must \"Wander Far and Unfettered,\" then one can \"Equalize Things.\" Having equalized things, one should nurture the self, hence \"The Secret of Caring for Life\" follows. Having mastered self-nurture, one may wander in the world, hence \"The Human World\" follows. Wandering in the world, one causes others to turn toward oneself, hence \"The Sign of Full Virtue\" follows. With inner virtue full, it manifests outwardly. One takes the Dao as one’s teacher rather than following others, hence \"The Great and Venerable Teacher\" follows. Having attained this Dao, one may become a teacher to emperors and kings, hence \"Responding to Emperors and Kings\" follows. Though this sequence is plausible, such rigid adherence lacks profound meaning and differs from the *Book of Changes*’ sequence of hexagrams. The true way to read the *Zhuangzi* lies not in such constraints but in grasping the infinite vitality of its passages.\n\nThe most revealing part of a text is its conclusion. In the seven Inner Chapters, each ending is distinct: \"Wander Far and Unfettered\" concludes with \"usefulness and uselessness,\" \"Equalize Things\" with \"the butterfly dream and transformation,\" \"The Secret of Caring for Life\" with \"the transmission of fire,\" \"The Sign of Full Virtue\" with \"hardness and whiteness crying out,\" and \"The Human World\" with \"fate.\" Each has its purpose. Yet Zhuangzi, with artful craft, ends with the tale of Shu, Hu, and Hundun—\"on the seventh day, Hundun died.\" Is this not a marvelous mechanism? The *Doctrine of the Mean* begins with \"What Heaven imparts is called nature\" and concludes with \"Only Heaven is vast and silent, without sound or scent—supreme indeed!\"\n\nThis, too, is the mechanism of literature—yet few perceive it so clearly. When my late master lectured on the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and reached the passage \"In the western hunt, a unicorn was captured,\" he remarked: *\"When it came to this point, even the Sage had something he could not know—hence he laid down his brush here.\"* That night, as we strolled along the western veranda, he suddenly asked, *\"How do you understand the capture of the unicorn?\"* I, Xi Que, replied, *\"It should be interpreted through the words of the *Doctrine of the Mean* on what even the Sage could not know—an insight no other school has offered. Yet if, at the time, there had been one more sentence after 'In the western hunt, a unicorn was captured,' the Master would surely not have recorded it.\"* My late master then asked, *\"How so?\"* I answered, *\"With such a conclusion, what more could be added?\"* The master said nothing and left; it was already late into the night. I immediately knocked on the door of Master Qiu of Bo Si and said, *\"Master Su’s reading of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* is most excellent. In all my years of studying it with friends, I have never encountered such insight.\"* We spoke with such delight that it was past midnight before I returned home. Two days later, Master Qiu of Bo Si recounted this to Xi Que.\n\n---\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"Webbed Toes\" (Chapter Eight)**\n\nWebbed toes and extra fingers arise from nature, yet they exceed virtue; growths and tumors emerge from form, yet they exceed nature. To multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness and apply them is to array them in the five organs, yet this is not the true alignment of the Dao and virtue. Thus, webbed toes are but connected useless flesh, and extra fingers are but superfluous digits. To multiply methods and apply them to the passions of the five organs is to indulge in perverse acts of benevolence and righteousness, and to overuse one’s intelligence.\n\nThe big toe and the fingers are natural; *pian* (webbed) means joined, and *zhi* (extra) means branching. What is born with one is called *xing* (nature), and what all humans share is called *de* (virtue). Webbed toes and extra fingers are deformities, yet when compared to what all humans share, they become excessive. Here, the meanings of *xing* and *de* differ slightly from those of the sages. Growths and tumors are also deformities, but while webbed toes and extra fingers exist from birth, growths and tumors arise after form has taken shape—hence it is said they *\"emerge from form yet exceed nature.\"* *Duo fang* (multiplying methods) means employing many approaches; *\"applying them\"* refers to their external use. *\"Arrayed in the five organs\"* means they do not arise from within. Since they are not the natural Dao, it is said they are *\"not the true alignment of the Dao and virtue.\"* Gaozi spoke of righteousness as external; Zhuangzi goes further, treating even benevolence as external. He regards benevolence and righteousness as perverse indulgences and groups them with intelligence, all of which he sees as contrary to the learning of inward cultivation. Thus, he perceives them as meddlesome and excessive—*\"multiplying methods\"* is akin to *\"meddling.\"*\n\nTherefore, those whose vision is webbed are confounded by the five colors, indulging in ornate patterns—are not the dazzling blues and yellows, the embroidered *fu* and *fu* of court robes, the work of Li Zhu? Those whose hearing is multiplied are confounded by the five tones, indulging in the six pitches—are not the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo, the grand harmonies of *Huang Zhong* and *Da Lü*, the work of Shi Kuang? Those who branch into benevolence pluck at virtue to block their nature, seeking fame and causing the world to clamor like reeds in the wind, upholding laws that fall short—are these not the deeds of Zengzi and Shishi? Those whose eloquence is webbed pile up tiles and knot ropes, weaving phrases and wandering in the labyrinths of *\"hard and white\"* and *\"same and different,\"* exhausting themselves in empty praise and useless words—are these not the ways of Yangzi and Mozi? Thus, all these are the paths of excessive branching and webbed growths, not the ultimate correctness of the world.\n\nThe five colors and ornate patterns—blues, yellows, *fu*, and *fu*—were used in antiquity to nurture the eyes, yet Zhuangzi saw them as chaotic and indulgent. Thus, *\"webbed vision\"* echoes Laozi’s *\"the five colors blind the eyes.\"* Li Zhu was a man of keen sight. If one doubts this, those who employ such vision will insist it is right.\n\nThus it is said: \"Is this not so?\"—yet Li Zhu is affirmed in this. The same applies to those who overreach in hearing and intention. For they treat ritual and music as external things. *\"Tugging\"* means to pull out, and *\"blocking\"* is like saying *\"thatch-blocked.\"* Virtue and nature are fundamentally quiescent, yet forcing oneself to practice benevolence is to tug at virtue and block one’s nature. *\"Laws\"* are standards, and *\"falling short\"* refers to what people find difficult to attain. Compelling others to follow laws that are hard to follow—hence it is said: *\"making the world pipe and drum to uphold laws that fall short.\"* *\"Piping and drumming\"* describes how words beguile and stir. To pile up tiles and knot ropes is to engage in futile affairs; the excessive speech of sophists drags on endlessly, layering without end and devoid of meaning—thus it is compared to piling tiles and knotting ropes. *\"Refining\"* means revising, as in revising one’s phrases to craft arguments—hence it is said: *\"weaving phrases and wandering in the labyrinths of 'hard and white' and 'same and different.'\"* *\"Exhausting\"* means laboring. *\"Kui\"* is pronounced like *\"qi\"*—to stand on tiptoe. Their words are all useless, yet they take pride in empty praise, toiling in vain—hence it is said: *\"exhausting themselves in empty praise and useless words.\"* If one doubts this, then the followers of Yangzi and Mozi will insist it is right.\n\n*\"Excessive branching and webbed growths\"* means superfluity. The Dao of nature is fundamentally without excess, yet all these are superfluous affairs, not the ultimate correctness. Ultimate correctness is the principle of what is inherently so. That which is ultimately correct does not lose the true condition of its nature and life—thus what is joined is not called *\"webbed,\"* what is branched is not called *\"overreaching,\"* what is long is not called *\"excessive,\"* and what is short is not called *\"deficient.\"* Therefore, though the teal’s legs are short, lengthening them brings sorrow; though the crane’s legs are long, severing them brings grief. Thus, what is long by nature cannot be cut, and what is short by nature cannot be extended—there is no sorrow to be removed. Is benevolence and righteousness not contrary to human nature? Why do they bring so much sorrow?\n\nUltimate correctness means what is naturally so. What is naturally so does not lose the true principle of its nature and life—though joined, it is not *\"webbed\";* though branched, it is not *\"overreaching\";* though long, it is not *\"excessive\";* though short, it is not *\"deficient.\"* These lines are deeply resonant, echoing the earlier saying: *\"Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small.\"* *\"Overreaching\"* means to rise on tiptoe—where there is overreaching, there is no levelness; without levelness, there is no ease. Observe how deliberately these words are chosen—how could they be careless? *\"Long by nature\"* and *\"short by nature\"* mean that length and shortness arise from one’s inherent nature. What is long or short by nature is at peace—there is no sorrow to remove. The analogy of the teal and crane is most apt. *\"Yi\"* here is a sigh. Speaking of these two extremes, benevolence and righteousness are excessive—are they not contrary to human nature? Thus, if benevolence and righteousness arose naturally, they would not bring such sorrow. *\"Much sorrow\"* refers to the toil of those who practice benevolence and righteousness.\n\nIn Zhuangzi’s words, from Confucius and Mencius back to Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, all fall within the scope of his mockery. Moreover, those with webbed toes weep when they are split, and those with extra fingers wail when they are bitten—whether in excess or deficiency, their sorrow is the same. Now, the benevolent of this world furrow their brows in worry over the world’s calamities, while the unbenevolent sever the true condition of their nature and life to greedily pursue wealth and honor. Is benevolence and righteousness not contrary to human nature? Since the Three Dynasties, why has the world been so clamorous?\n\nThough webbed fingers and extra digits are both afflictions, they cannot be forcibly removed—removing them brings sorrow. *\"Branched\"* means an extra finger—hence it is said: *\"in excess of the proper number.\"* *\"Webbed\"* means two fingers joined and inseparable—hence it is said: *\"deficient in the proper number.\"* *\"Furrowed brows\"* means half-closed eyes; when one wishes to close them but cannot, the lashes bristle like reeds—hence it is said: *\"furrowed brows.\"* *\"Furrowed\"* refers to the mugwort and wormwood. *\"Furrowed brows\"* conveys the sense of sitting alone in sorrow, a deliberate choice of words by Zhuangzi to describe the toil of the benevolent who worry over the world’s calamities. The unbenevolent, greedy for wealth and honor, destroy their nature and life. Both bring self-inflicted suffering—hence they are spoken of together. Again, he sighs: *\"Is benevolence and righteousness not contrary to human nature?\"*\n\nViewed in this light, benevolence, righteousness, and trustworthiness do not arise from what is inherently so. *\"Clamorous\"* means noisy and chaotic. Since the Three Dynasties and below, how boisterously this doctrine has prevailed! Moreover, those who rely on hooks, cords, compasses, and squares to set things right are carving away at their nature; those who depend on ropes, glue, and lacquer to make things firm are encroaching upon their virtue. To bend and twist with rites and music, to soothe and coax with benevolence and righteousness in order to comfort the hearts of the world—this is to lose what is constant and natural. Nature is what is spontaneous; virtue is what is self-attained from Heaven. Neither is the work of human effort. If one must await cultivation and refinement before things are set right, this is self-mutilation. Hooks, cords, ropes, glue, and lacquer are all metaphors for cultivation. To encroach, carve, mutilate, and destroy—this is to fix and solidify. To bend one’s body for rites and music, to coax with words for benevolence and righteousness, and thereby seek to comfort the hearts of the world—all this is to lose the principle of inherent nature. Hence it is said: *\"to lose what is constant and natural.\"* *\"To soothe and coax\"* is like a mother’s gentle nurturing.\n\nWhat is constant and natural in the world? That which is crooked is not made straight by hooks, that which is straight is not made so by cords, that which is round is not made so by compasses, that which is square is not made so by squares. That which is joined or separated does not rely on glue and lacquer, nor is it bound by ropes and cords. Thus, all things in the world grow enticingly of themselves, yet none know how they grow; all attain their due, yet none know how they attain it. From ancient times to the present, this principle has never varied—it cannot be diminished. Then why must benevolence and righteousness cling unceasingly like glue and lacquer, like ropes and cords, wandering between the Dao and virtue? This only serves to confuse the world.\n\nThe lines below *\"what is constant and natural\"* share the same meaning as *\"that which joins does not form extra limbs, that which stands does not grow an extra toe.\"* Whether crooked or straight, round or square, joined or separated, or subjected to restraint—all should arise from spontaneity without reliance on human effort; only then is it the correct principle. *\"Enticingly\"* is like *\"weeds\"*—though weeds grow of themselves, who causes them to grow? What all things share—who bestows it? It is all spontaneous. Hence it is said: *\"none know how they grow, none know how they attain it.\"* *\"From ancient times to the present, never varied\"* means one and the same, enduring through all ages without diminution. *\"Unceasingly\"* means without end. Glue and lacquer bind fast; ropes and cords constrain. To depart from one’s nature in pursuit of benevolence and righteousness, persisting without end, is to become bound and constrained—how then can one wander through the gate of the Dao and virtue? This only serves to confuse the world.\n\nZhuangzi and Mencius were contemporaries. Mencius spoke solely of benevolence and righteousness; Zhuangzi spoke solely of the Dao and virtue. Thus, his writings consistently suppress benevolence and righteousness while expounding spontaneity, which has its own lofty subtleties. Yet his words often exceed what is fitting. Generally speaking, Zhuangzi’s conception of benevolence and righteousness differs in meaning from Mencius’s. Readers should recognize and distinguish this for themselves.\n\nMinor delusion confounds one’s direction; great delusion alters one’s nature. How do we know this is so? Since the time of Yu’s dynasty, when benevolence and righteousness were summoned to disturb the world, none have not rushed to answer the call of benevolence and righteousness. Is this not using benevolence and righteousness to alter one’s nature? Let us examine this: since the Three Dynasties and below, none in the world have not exchanged their nature for external things. The petty man sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar sacrifices himself for fame; the grandee sacrifices himself for his house; the sage sacrifices himself for the world. Though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations vary, in harming their nature and sacrificing themselves, they are one and the same. *\"Delusion\"* means confusion; *\"direction\"* refers to the four directions.\n\nIn minor delusion, east and west, south and north become transposed; in great delusion, one loses the nature of Heaven and Earth. The upper line illustrates the lower: \"summoning\" is like what people today call a signboard. Erecting the name of benevolence and righteousness to disturb and confuse the world, it causes all under Heaven to rush toward benevolence and righteousness, hastening at its beck and call. Knowing benevolence and righteousness but not knowing the virtue of the Dao—this is exchanging one’s nature for external things. The petty man is enslaved to profit; the gentleman, to fame; the minister, to his house; the ruler, to the world. *\"Enslaved\"* means to forget oneself in following it—this is called *\"enslavement.\"* From Zhuangzi’s perspective, the world, the state, fame, and profit are all external things. To speak of the world and the state alongside fame and profit is to diminish the great with the small, to humble the high with the low—this is largely the method throughout the text.\n\nThese several types—referring to the sage, the minister, the scholar, and the petty man—though their undertakings and reputations differ, in forgetting themselves and harming their nature, they are one. All these are the errors of enslavement to things.\n\nZang and Gu were two men who herded sheep together and both lost their sheep. When asked what Zang was doing, he replied, \"Holding a bamboo slip and reading.\" When asked what Gu was doing, he replied, \"Gambling for sport.\" Though their pursuits differed, in losing their sheep, they were the same. Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang Mountain, while Robber Zhi died for profit upon Dongling Heights. Though what they died for differed, in maiming their lives and harming their nature, they were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? All under Heaven are enslaved. Those who are enslaved to benevolence and righteousness are commonly called gentlemen; those enslaved to wealth and property are commonly called petty men. Yet in their enslavement, they are one—so where is the gentleman, and where is the petty man? If one considers the maiming of life and the harm to nature, then Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi. How then can one distinguish between gentleman and petty man?\n\nGambling and reading are two pursuits of differing worth, yet in losing the sheep, they are equal—this analogy is most apt. *\"Holding a bamboo slip\"* means holding a scroll. *\"Gambling\"* refers to casting dice; if one does not cast, it is called *\"blocking.\"* The dice are like today’s dice, also called *\"teeth\"* or *\"pips.\"* *\"Blocking\"* is the same as *\"obstructing.\"* Boyi and Robber Zhi—did Zhuangzi not know their worth? He merely used them to make his point. All these are instances of excess. Though gentlemen and petty men differ, in maiming life and harming nature, they are one. His intent is to satirize the gentleman, so he borrows the petty man to illustrate—this is again the meaning of diminishing the great with the small, humbling the high with the low.\n\nMoreover, can one truly bind one’s nature to benevolence and righteousness? Even those as upright as Zeng and Shi are not what I call *\"preserved.\"*\n\nBinding one’s nature to the five flavors—though one may be as discerning as Yu Er, this is not what I call *\"preserved.\"* Binding one’s nature to the five tones—though one may be as skilled as Master Kuang, this is not what I call *\"keen.\"* Binding one’s nature to the five colors—though one may be as sharp-sighted as Li Zhu, this is not what I call *\"clear.\"*\n\nWhat I call *\"preserved\"* is not the binding to benevolence and righteousness, but the preservation of one’s virtue alone. What I call *\"preserved\"* is not what is meant by benevolence and righteousness, but the following of one’s nature and the truth of life.\n\nWhat I call *\"keen\"* is not hearing others, but hearing oneself. What I call *\"clear\"* is not seeing others, but seeing oneself. For one who does not see oneself but sees others, who does not attain for oneself but attains for others—this is attaining the attainment of others while failing to attain one’s own attainment. It is fitting oneself to the fitting of others rather than fitting oneself to one’s own fitting. Those who fit themselves to the fitting of others rather than their own fitting—whether Robber Zhi or Boyi—are equally given to excess and perversion.\n\nI am ashamed of this. Therefore, above, I dare not cling to the conduct of benevolence and righteousness, and below, I dare not indulge in excess and perversion. *\"Binding one’s nature\"* means fixing one’s attention. Zeng refers to Master Zeng.\n\n\"Hui\" refers to Zeng Shen, and \"Shi\" to Zishi Yu. The name \"Qiu\" is likened to Yu Er, Shikuang, and Li Zhu, while comparing them to Zeng and Shi expresses the intent to humble the lofty. *\"Zang\"* denotes goodness, yet it is said: though this may be so, it is not what I deem good. To deem good its virtue and entrust to the natural endowment of one’s nature and fate—this is to follow the natural.\n\nWithin these few lines, such as *\"What I call 'clear' is not hearing others, but hearing oneself\"* and *\"What I call 'bright' is not seeing others, but seeing oneself\"*—the entire *Great Treasury of Sūtras* scarcely conveys this meaning. How could such words be uttered lightly? This *\"others\"* is no trifling matter; it is what Chan masters call *\"a mad dog chasing a clod\"* or *\"an illusory flower yielding an illusory fruit.\"* *\"Attaining one’s own attainment\"* and *\"fitting oneself to one’s own fitting\"*—this is *\"seeing oneself\"* and *\"awakening to oneself.\"* Generally, it is a matter of distinguishing the original mind from external things. To fail in grasping the original mind and instead gallop after externals—this is all excess and perversion.\n\n*\"Hearing oneself\"* and *\"seeing oneself\"*—in my writings, this aligns with the *Analects’* *\"silently recording it,\"* the *Book of Changes’* *\"silently accomplishing it, unspoken yet trusted,\"* Mencius’ *\"manifested in the four limbs, unspoken yet understood,\"* and Master Cheng Yi’s *Preface to the Spring and Autumn Annals*: *\"nurturing through deep immersion, silently recording, the mind penetrating\"*—all express this meaning, though stated with greater plainness.\n\nMaster Zhu [Xi] reproved the learning of [Lu] Xiangshan, saying that the scholars of Jiangxi all raised their brows and darted their eyes, boasting of profound awakening, and so he vehemently refuted and vigorously rejected such claims. Thus, in his *Collected Explanations of the Analects*, he glosses *\"recording\"* (*zhi*) as *\"remembering\"* (*zhi*), saying *\"silently remembering it.\"* For Mencius’ *\"unspoken yet understood,\"* he likewise says *\"not awaiting others’ words to understand for oneself,\"* refusing to speak of sudden awakening. This was due to his reproof, not the original purport of the *Analects* or *Mencius*. Yet if we consider Master Cheng Yi’s words *\"silently recording, the mind penetrating,\"* how could *\"recording\"* be read as *\"remembering\"*?\n\nNevertheless, those who study the Dao, when applying effort, often harbor a mind awaiting penetration and awakening—this is especially impermissible. As the saying goes: *\"Clinging to delusion while awaiting awakening is as distant as Mount Sumeru.\"* Sudden and gradual awakening each have their own mechanism; one cannot say there is gradualness without suddenness, nor must everyone attain it through sudden awakening. Zhonggong’s *\"maintaining reverence\"* is gradual, while Yan Hui’s *\"overcoming the self and returning to ritual\"* is sudden. Otherwise, why would it be said: *\"In one day, overcoming the self and returning to ritual, all under heaven will turn to benevolence\"*? What is benevolence? To attain it in a single day—what is this if not sudden awakening?\n\nObserve these lines: first, it raises the phrase *\"overcoming the self and returning to ritual is benevolence,\"* then says *\"in one day, overcoming the self and returning to ritual, all under heaven will turn to benevolence,\"* and further asks: *\"Is benevolence to be pursued by oneself or by others?\"*\n\nThe cadence of these words rises and falls, much like the responses of Chan masters—only upon careful recitation and reflection does one taste their depth. Once Yanzi grasped the meaning at the words’ edge, he asked, *\"May I inquire about its details?\"* This is precisely what Chan calls *\"how to preserve and uphold it\"*—the *\"four negations\"* and *\"four restraints\"* are none other than the full realization of mind, the knowing of nature, and the knowing of Heaven, followed by the cultivation of mind, the nurturing of nature, the serving of Heaven, and the refining of the self to await destiny.\n\nWhen it says *\"to be benevolent depends on oneself,\"* this is what Chan means by *\"this matter cannot be forced by others.\"* Our late teacher once remarked: *\"Buddhist texts best verify our own; once verified, they become easily understood.\"*\n\n*\"Above, one dares not practice benevolence and righteousness\"*—this is *\"doing good without seeking fame.\"*\n*\"Below, one dares not engage in licentious and deviant conduct\"*—this is *\"doing evil without incurring punishment.\"*\nVirtue and the Dao are natural.\n\nI fear I fall short of virtue and the Dao. Though I do not commit acts that bring punishment, neither do I pursue deeds that seek fame—for to seek fame is to depart from the natural. Thus, I say: *\"I am ashamed before virtue and the Dao.\"* Therefore, *\"above, one dares not practice benevolence and righteousness, and below, one dares not engage in licentious and deviant conduct.\"*\n\nObserve Zhuangzi’s words—do they not also speak of rectifying the mind and cultivating the self? His mockery of Yao, Shun, Confucius, Zeng, and Bo Yi was never meant as serious critique; it was merely the flourish of his brush to rouse the reader. Liu Shuping of Tangdong once wrote a treatise comparing the *Zhuangzi* and the *Li Sao* as *\"different tunes played with equal skill,\"* saying: *\"Zhuang Zhou was a master of pent-up indignation.\"* Master Lexuan greatly admired this remark. It seems Zhuangzi, too, wrote this book out of indignation toward a corrupt world. His vision was lofty, his brushwork extraordinary—hence his occasional excesses. Sima Qian said of him: *\"He excelled in composition, diverging from conventional phrasing to depict events and express emotions. He borrowed from and critiqued the Confucians and Mohists, leaving even the most learned scholars of his time unable to defend themselves.\"* His words surge and swell, unbounded and self-indulgent, perfectly suiting his purpose—these few lines truly capture the essence of Zhuangzi.\n\n**Outer Chapters, \"Horse’s Hooves\" (Chapter Nine):**\n*\"A horse’s hooves can tread upon frost and snow; its coat can ward off wind and cold. It grazes on grass, drinks water, lifts its legs, and gallops—this is the true nature of the horse. Though there be grand halls and towering pavilions, they are of no use to it. But when Bo Le says, ‘I am skilled at managing horses,’ he burns their hooves, brands their flesh, trims their manes, pierces their nostrils, and binds them with reins and halters. He tethers them to stable posts and black troughs—already, two or three out of ten horses die. He starves them, parches them, races them, spurs them, aligns them, and disciplines them. Before them lie the torments of bits and ornaments; behind them, the threats of whips and restraints—more than half the horses perish.\"*\n\nThis passage speaks to how external things can burden the body.\n*\"Lifts its legs and gallops\"*—when any horse stands, its hooves naturally lift.\nHere, *\"grand halls and towering pavilions\"* refer to the palaces of kings.\n*\"Nourishment\"* (義) means *\"to sustain.\"*\n*\"Dwelling transforms qi; nurturing transforms the body\"*—this must have been the original meaning of these two characters.\n*\"Burning\"* refers to cauterizing the hooves; *\"trimming\"* means cutting them.\n*\"Carving\"* (刻) is also the trimming of hooves.\n\n\"Luo\" means to bridle and harness; \"ji\" is the headstall that binds the head; \"\" are the fetters that hobble the feet—what we now call the front and rear tethers. \"Lian\" means to arrange them in rows. \"Zao zhan\" are the black troughs and racks where the horses are lined up together. \"Zheng qi\" means to align and arrange them in orderly ranks. \"Jue\" is the bit; \"shi\" are the ornamental reins beneath the jaw—hence the saying, \"before them lie the torments of bits and ornaments.\" Horses are controlled by humans and cannot enjoy their natural joys, which is why so many die. This is the same meaning as Yuan Xian dragging his tail in the mud, though the phrasing here—with several \"zhi\" particles and the shift from \"two or three out of ten\" to \"more than half\"—is as richly woven as fine brocade. From this, countless brush techniques of past and present have sprouted. Some say this is a rough and erroneous passage from the Outer Chapters.\n\nThe potter says, \"I excel at shaping clay: what is round fits the compass, what is square fits the carpenter’s square.\" The craftsman says, \"I excel at working wood: what is curved fits the hook, what is straight aligns with the plumb line.\" Yet do clay and wood by nature desire to conform to compass, square, hook, and line? Still, generation after generation, people praise Bo Le for his skill in training horses and potters and carpenters for their skill in shaping clay and wood—this is also the error of those who govern the world.\n\nThe potter works clay; the craftsman works wood. Clay and wood are both fashioned by human hands into vessels, just as horses are scorched, trimmed, carved, bridled, raced, and drilled into alignment—do they not lose the natural qualities of earth and wood? People regard Bo Le and the artisans as capable, just as those from the time of Tai onward regard governing the world as a skill. This is the same idea as the earlier passage on benevolence and righteousness not being in accord with human nature. The meaning of these few lines is no more than this, though the wording is exquisite.\n\nIn my view, one who truly excels at governing the world does not act thus. The people have a constant nature: they weave to clothe themselves and till to feed themselves—this is called \"shared virtue,\" unified and impartial, named \"Heaven’s release.\" Thus, in the age of utmost virtue, their movements are unhurried, their gazes steady. At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges. The myriad things and all living beings dwelled together in their villages; birds and beasts formed flocks, grasses and trees grew freely. Thus, wild beasts could be led by tethers to roam, and the nests of birds and magpies could be climbed to peer into. In the age of utmost virtue, states dwelled among beasts, clans mingled with the myriad things—how could one distinguish between noble and base? Alike in ignorance, their virtue did not depart; alike in desirelessness, they were called \"plain and uncarved.\" In plainness and uncarved simplicity, the people’s nature was preserved.\n\n\"Shared virtue\" means what is received from Heaven is the same for all. Human life unfolds as each pursues their livelihood—some till, some weave—all following the natural workings of Heaven. Thus it is called \"constant nature,\" which is what the earlier passage referred to as \"constant thusness.\" \"Dang\" means partiality, leaning toward one side.\n\nUnblemished in singularity and free from partiality, they roamed unfettered and rejoiced in the spontaneity of nature—thus it is called \"one and without faction,\" or what is termed *tianfang* (\"Heavenly release\"). *Ming yue* (\"termed\") means \"to name it as such.\" The *tianxing* (\"Heavenly workings\"), *tianjun* (\"Heavenly balance\"), *tianyou* (\"Heavenly wandering\"), and *tianfang* (\"Heavenly release\") in the *Qiwulun* are all names coined by Zhuangzi to depict the joy of spontaneity in the age of utmost virtue, referring to antiquity.\n\n*Tiantian* describes a state of fullness and contentment; *diandian*, a gaze of unwavering directness—both portraying the artless simplicity and absence of self-consciousness of those people. This passage is echoed in the *Yingdiwang* chapter. \"Mountains without paths or tunnels\" means roads were yet unopened; \"marshlands without boats or bridges\" means waterways were yet uncrossed. People dwelled according to their locales, forming natural bonds—within each village, elders and juniors, superiors and inferiors were organically connected. Birds and beasts lived in herds deep in the mountains, far from human harm; grasses and trees flourished unmarred by the axe’s calamity. Leading beasts by tethers to roam or climbing to peer into magpies’ nests—this was the mutual forgetting of humans and creatures.\n\nSu Dongpo’s *Miscellaneous Sayings* records that in his youth, birds nested on the low branches of a paulownia outside his study, and a *huan* bird visited every four or five days—a scene reminiscent of this passage, as noted in the commentary to his *Yichao* poem in volume twenty-eight of his collected works. From this, we may infer that in high antiquity, humans must have dwelled alongside birds and beasts, gathered with the myriad things—how could there have been distinctions between noble and base, or divisions among clans? *Bing* means \"alike\" or \"together\"; *wu zhi* means \"ignorant,\" \"unaware,\" or \"without knowledge.\"\n\nWhen desire is absent, one is purely in accord with Heavenly Principle—this is the state of the whole world, hence it is called \"the same.\" Free from desire, one does not depart from wholeness and simplicity, from unadorned purity. In that time, each attained the joy of its own nature, and so it is said: \"Unadorned and simple, the people’s nature was fulfilled.\" \"Its virtue does not depart\" means it remains unadorned and simple. These two phrases follow one another, and the latter condenses the former into just \"unadorned and simple\"—such is the method of ancient prose. Modern writing no longer observes such discipline.\n\nWhen the Sage stumbles and strains to enact benevolence, stretches and strains to enact righteousness, the world begins to doubt. When it sprawls and scatters to enact music, plucks and twists to enact ritual, the world begins to divide. Thus, if unhewn simplicity is not marred, what need is there for sacrificial goblets? If white jade is not shattered, what need is there for ritual scepters? If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, what need is there for benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feeling are not estranged, what need is there for ritual and music? If the five colors are not disordered, what need is there for patterned ornament? If the five tones are not disordered, what need is there to respond to the six pitch-pipes?\n\nTo mar simplicity to make vessels is the fault of the craftsman. To shatter the Dao and virtue to make benevolence and righteousness is the error of the Sage. The preceding passage spoke of Bole; this passage speaks of the Sage—what follows echoes what came before. *Biexie* describes the manner of forced, halting movement; *diqi* describes the manner of uneasy standing and walking. *Chanman* is the same as *hanman*, meaning dissolute and unrestrained; *zhaipi* describes the use of hands and feet, with *pi* pronounced like *bo* (as in *pibo*). Here, ritual and music, benevolence and righteousness, are wrung from the midst of self-abasement—though the words may seem unorthodox, the phrasing is striking. \"Begins to divide\" means that hearts and traces begin to diverge; once divided, they are no longer pure and unified. Such instances of the word \"divide\" are all well-placed.\n\nGoblets are carved from wood, so it is said: \"If unhewn simplicity is not marred, what need is there for sacrificial goblets?\" Jade must be cut to become a vessel, so it is said: \"If white jade is not shattered, what need is there for ritual scepters?\" The Dao and virtue are natural; Zhuangzi treats benevolence and righteousness as external, hence: \"If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, what need is there for benevolence and righteousness?\" Nature and feeling are inherent; Zhuangzi treats ritual and music as forced upon the world, hence: \"If nature and feeling are not estranged, what need is there for ritual and music?\" Mencius spoke of \"refining these two\" and \"delighting in these two\"—such are the words of sages and worthies. In this text, however, the meanings of \"ritual and music\" and \"benevolence and righteousness\" differ, as they are all regarded as external things.\n\nPatterned ornament disrupts the five colors; the six pitch-pipes disrupt the five tones—both are metaphors for the use of human effort rather than natural spontaneity. \"The fault of the craftsman\" and \"the error of the Sage\" are concluding phrases for the preceding passage.\n\nHorses, when dwelling on land, eat grass and drink water; when pleased, they entwine necks and nuzzle; when angry, they turn their backs and kick. This is all the knowledge horses possess. But when yokes and crossbars are placed upon them, when forehead ornaments are fitted to them, horses learn to glare defiantly, to resist the bit, to rear fiercely, to feign submission, to seize the bit, and to steal the bridle. Thus, the knowledge horses possess that enables them to become thieves is the fault of Bole.\n\nIn the time of the Lord of Brightness, people dwelled without knowing what to do, walked without knowing where to go; they filled their cheeks with food and played, patted their bellies and wandered—this was all the ability people possessed. But when the Sage bent and twisted ritual and music to correct the world’s form, dangled and dangled benevolence and righteousness to console the world’s heart, the people then began to stand on tiptoe, to love cunning, to contend for profit, and this could not be stopped. This, too, is the error of the Sage.\n\nThis analogy again condenses the preceding discourse into a few lines, adding several phrases that make it all the more striking. When pleased, they entwine necks and nuzzle; when angry, they turn their backs and kick—this is clearly a painted image of horses. *Xiangmi* means to rub against one another. Observe how the phrases \"entwine necks\" and \"turn their backs\" are employed. *Henge* refers to the crossbar on a carriage; *e* is the yoke. *Yueti* is what is now called a forehead mirror. *Jieni* means to stand alone, to glare defiantly in anger. *Yine* means to curve the neck and resist the bit, refusing the bridle. *Zhi* means fierce; *man* means to charge. The manner of refusing restraint and butting against one another. *Gui* means to scheme; *qie* means to act stealthily. Scheming to take the bit, stealthily applying the bridle—all are the result of the horse’s fierce resistance to being tamed, making the use of bit and bridle so laborious.\n\nIf horses oppose humans, they are called thieves—their knowledge of this is due to Bole. Without the imposition of yokes, crossbars, bits, and bridles, horses would remain horses and humans would remain humans; how would one see their defiant, resistant postures?\n\n\"People’s ability was limited to this\" means that this was the extent of human capacity. *Kuang* means to correct. Using ritual and music to correct people’s form, using benevolence and righteousness to console people’s hearts—these are all inventions of the Sage, absent in high antiquity. *Xianqi* means to raise and display; *diqi* means to be ill at ease. Loving cunning and contending for profit are like the horse’s scheming to seize the bit and stealthily apply the bridle.\n\nThe Inner and Outer Chapters resemble the *Zuozhuan* and *Guoyu*—all were composed by the same hand. The *Zuozhuan* was completed, and then the *Guoyu* was written, though its style differs from the *Zuozhuan*. This chapter of the *Zhuangzi* is similarly expansive and luxuriant, so some have doubted it was written by Zhuangzi, but this is not the case. *Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Three. <*Sibu*, Daoist School, *Zhuangzi Kouyi*>\n\nThe *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Four\nBy Lin Xiang of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"Opening the Satchel\" (Chapter Ten)**\n\nWhen one prepares to guard against thieves who would pry open satchels, rummage through sacks, or force open chests, one must bind cords tightly, fasten bolts securely, and lock clasps firmly—this is what the common world calls \"wisdom.\" Yet when a great thief arrives, he hoists the chest, shoulders the satchel, and carries off the sack, hurrying away in fear only that the cords, bolts, and locks are not secure enough. Then does not what was once called \"wisdom\" become merely the amassing of goods for the great thief?\n\nLet us examine this: Is there any so-called \"wisdom\" in the common world that does not amass for the great thief? Is there any so-called \"sage\" who does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so? In ancient times, the state of Qi had neighboring towns within sight of one another, where the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard across the land. Nets and snares were spread wide, and plows and hoes pierced the earth—an expanse of over two thousand *li* square. Within its four borders, all that was established—ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain, the governance of cities, villages, districts, and hamlets—was it not all modeled after the sages’ laws? Yet Tian Chengzi, in a single day, murdered the ruler of Qi and stole the state. What he stole was not merely the state—he also stole the sages’ wisdom and laws along with it. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a thief and brigand yet dwelt in the security of Yao and Shun. Small states dared not condemn him; great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, he held the state of Qi—was this not the theft of the state of Qi *together* with its sagely wisdom and laws, using them to guard his thieving self?\n\nReading this chapter, one perceives its fierce indignation and grandeur. The author crafts a striking metaphor, unique in its artistry.\n*Qu* (胠) means to open; *tan* (探) means to reach in and take; *fa* (发) also means to open.\n\nAre not the six characters \"the theft of a rat’s pilfering\" a stroke of literary brilliance? *Jian* (缄) and *teng* (縢) are knots and bindings; *she* (摄) is to coil and wrap; *jiong* (扃) are bolts and keys; *jue* (鐍) are locks. The wisdom of the common world exists only to guard against the pilfering of rats—yet when the great thief arrives, he carries it all away in one haul. Tian’s usurpation of Qi, lending with private measures and collecting with public ones—what the *Zuozhuan* describes is precisely the borrowing of the sages’ laws to advance his thieving schemes. Such was the way of things in the Warring States era, and thus Zhuangzi drew this analogy.\n\nLet us examine it: Is there any so-called \"utmost wisdom\" that does not serve to amass for the great thief? Any so-called \"utmost sageliness\" that does not serve to guard for the great thief? How do we know this to be so? In ancient times, Long Feng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn limb from limb, and Wu Zixu’s corpse was left to rot—though these four were men of virtue, they could not escape execution. Yet when Zhi’s followers asked him, \"Does theft also have its Dao?\" Zhi replied, \"Where is there anything that does not have its Dao? To divine the treasures hidden in a chamber—that is sageliness. To enter first—that is courage. To exit last—that is righteousness. To know what can and cannot be done—that is wisdom. To divide spoils equally—that is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief.\" From this, we see that the good man cannot stand without the Dao of the sage, nor can Zhi act without the Dao of the sage. If the good men of the world are few and the ungood many, then the sage’s benefit to the world is slight, while his harm is great.\n\n*Chi* (胣) means to tear apart; *mi* (靡) means to shred—both describe how they were condemned and their bodies destroyed. Though the four were virtuous, they all met with punishment, while the thief Zhi escaped unscathed. This shows that the virtuous cannot rely on themselves, and those who steal the name of the sagely Dao may use it for their own gain. The thief’s sageliness, courage, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence—these are the names Zhuangzi fabricated to mock the Confucians. Though his words are strange, when viewed through the lens of worldly affairs, they hold truth. To say that the ungood are many and the good few, that the sage’s benefit to the world is slight while his harm is great—this is a most incisive observation.\n\nThus it is said: When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when the Lu wine was weak, Handan was besieged. When the sage is born, the great thief arises. Only by smashing the sages and abandoning wisdom, releasing the thieves and brigands, does the world begin to be ordered. When the river runs dry, the valley empties; when the hills are leveled, the abyss fills. Once the sage is dead, the great thief no longer rises, and the world is at peace without incident. If the sage does not die, the great thief does not cease. Even if the sage is revered to govern the world, this is but to heap profit upon the thief Zhi.\n\nWhen Chu attacked Lu because its wine was weak, Liang then attacked Zhao because Lu could not come to its aid. Lips and teeth seem unrelated, yet when the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold of themselves. Rivers and valleys seem unconnected, yet when the river runs dry, the valley empties of itself. Hills and abysses seem unrelated, yet when the hills are leveled, the abyss fills of itself—just as people today say, \"Zhang drinks the wine, but Li grows drunk.\" This is to say that the sages’ laws are not made for thieves, yet they become the thieves’ resources. Thus it is said: When the sage is born, the great thief arises; when the sage does not exist, the great thief does not rise. Only by smashing the sages and releasing the thieves and brigands—only then, with neither sages nor thieves, does the world find order.\n\nWhen the river is full, the mountain valleys are all filled with water; when the river runs dry, the valley empties of itself. Though rivers and valleys are not connected, their spring floods and autumn droughts are the same. *Qiu yi* (丘夷) means the hills are leveled and flattened—like saying the mountains are eroded and return to the earth. When the hills are leveled, their soil fills the abyss, showing how things unrelated are yet mutually dependent. *Wu gu* (无故) means without incident. *Chong shengren er zhi* (重圣人而治) means the sage reappears. When the sage reappears and his laws grow ever more intricate, deceivers find in them even greater means to deceive the world. Thus it is said: to heap profit upon the thief Zhi.\n\nWhen measures like *dou* and *hu* are made to quantify, the thief steals them along with the grain. When scales and balances are made to weigh, the thief steals them along with the goods. When tallies and seals are made to authenticate, the thief steals them along with the authority. When benevolence and righteousness are made to rectify, the thief steals them along with the virtues. How do we know this to be so? Those who steal hooks are executed, while those who steal states become lords—yet at the gates of these lords, benevolence and righteousness reside. Is this not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom?\n\nThe *dou*, *hu*, scales, balances, tallies, seals, benevolence, and righteousness—these eight are spoken of together to humble the lofty. Stealing a hook is a petty theft, for a hook is but a belt ring. Yet the lords of the Warring States era, who gained power through usurpation, were all great thieves. The petty are executed, while the great attain such heights—this is the indignation of one who rails against the world. Once they become lords, their rule is built on loving the people and benefiting things, yet this is not merely the theft of the state—it is the theft of the sages’ benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom.\n\nThus, when the great thief arises, he seizes the lords, stealing benevolence and righteousness along with the profits of *dou*, *hu*, scales, balances, tallies, and seals. Though rewards of high rank and emolument are offered, they cannot encourage; though the threat of the executioner’s axe looms, it cannot deter. That this heaping of profit upon the thief Zhi cannot be stopped is the fault of the sages. Thus it is said: The fish cannot leave the abyss; the state’s sharpest tools cannot be shown to others. The sage is the world’s sharpest tool—he is not meant to be displayed to the world.\n\nThose called great thieves are pursued by all, yet today’s lords, all usurpers of states, stand above the people—who does not see this? Thus it is said: Such great thieves are manifest in the world, stealing benevolence, righteousness, *dou*, *hu*, scales, balances, tallies, and seals—yet the world offers no rewards to capture them, no punishments to forbid them. This is the indignation of one who rails against the world. \"The fish cannot leave the abyss\" means it cannot leave the water. The sages’ laws can only be used by oneself; they cannot be made known to all. Thus it is said: they are not meant to be displayed to the world. *Ming* (明) means to make known to all under heaven.\n\nThus, only by cutting off sageliness and discarding wisdom does the great thief cease. Smash the jades and shatter the pearls, and petty thieves will not rise. Burn the tallies and break the seals, and the people will return to simplicity. Break the *dou* and snap the scales, and the people will not contend. Only when the sages’ laws are utterly destroyed can the people begin to be spoken with.\n\nSmashing jades, shattering pearls, burning tallies, breaking seals, splitting *dou*, and snapping scales—these are all extreme statements to conclude the argument for cutting off sageliness and discarding wisdom; they are not meant as practical discourse. *Dan can* (殚残) means to destroy and abolish. Only when the sages’ laws are entirely removed can the people become pure and unified, fit to be spoken with of the Dao. Thus it is said: the people can then begin to be spoken with. These are all the words of one who rails against the world, and so people often mock the splitting of *dou*, the snapping of scales, the burning of tallies, and the breaking of seals. Yet in truth, this is no different from Laozi’s idea that \"not prizing rare goods will keep the people from stealing\"—it is merely stated in an extreme manner. As Su Dongpo said, \"When a man learns to read, his troubles begin\"—yet who would wish the world’s people to remain entirely illiterate?\n\nDisrupting the six pitch-pipes and melting away the *yu* and *se*, stopping up the ears of the blind Master Kuang—only then will the people of the world begin to preserve their natural hearing. Eradicating patterns and scattering the five colors, blinding the eyes of Li Zhu—only then will the people of the world begin to preserve their natural clarity. Destroying plumb lines and discarding compasses and squares, breaking the fingers of the craftsman Chui—only then will the people of the world begin to possess their innate skill. Thus it is said: \"Great skill appears clumsy.\" Erasing the conduct of Zeng and Shi, silencing the mouths of Yang and Mo, casting aside benevolence and righteousness—only then will the virtue of the world begin to achieve primordial unity.\n\nWhen people preserve their natural clarity, the world will not be dazzled; when they preserve their natural hearing, the world will not be burdened; when they preserve their innate knowledge, the world will not be deluded; when they preserve their inherent virtue, the world will not be perverse. Those like Zeng, Shi, Yang, Mo, Master Kuang, the craftsman Chui, and Li Zhu all externally establish their virtues and thereby confuse the world with their dazzling brilliance—such are those whom the Dao deems useless.\n\n*Zhuo luan* means to pull out and disrupt. The six pitch-pipes have their ordered lengths; if one disrupts them, they become unusable. *Shuo jue* means to burn and discard. Only with the ears of one like Master Kuang can the affairs of pitch and music be accomplished; if one stops up his ears, then all hearing will accord with spontaneity, free from such artificial constructs.\n\nThe two phrases on clarity and skill share the same meaning—hence, the character \"skill\" brings to mind Laozi’s saying, \"Great skill appears clumsy,\" which serves as corroboration. This, too, is a matter of literary technique. Zeng and Shi bore names of loyalty and filial piety; Yang and Mo spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Cast them aside, discard them, and let the doctrines of benevolence and righteousness cease to circulate—then the people of the world will equally attain this virtue, and all will return to the profound and wondrous.\n\n*Not to be dazzled* means not to dissipate; *not to be burdened* means to be free from entanglement; *not to be deluded* means not to deceive one another; *not to be perverse* means to be without bias or deviation. To speak of Zeng, Shi, Yang, and Mo alongside Master Kuang, the craftsman Chui, and Li Zhu is to diminish the great by means of the small. Those who *externally establish their virtue* value external things and lose their original mind. *To dazzle and disrupt* means to scorch and confound. From the perspective of the correct Dao, such people are of no use—indeed, they ought to be cast aside. Thus it is said, \"such are those whom the Dao deems useless.\" This concluding phrase is rendered with great force, a fine example of literary excellence.\n\nYet you alone do not know of the age of utmost virtue? In ancient times, there were the clans of Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhu Rong, Fuxi, and Shennong—twelve clans in all. Only Xuanyuan, Fuxi, and Shennong appear in the classics; those before them are absent from my books. Some may have been transmitted from antiquity, while others may have been fabricated by Zhuangzi himself—much like the Buddhist claim, \"In a past kalpa, I...\" Though it may seem boastful, when viewed within the scope of heaven and earth, the three thousand-odd years since Fuxi that can be verified in the records are but a fraction. How could there not have been vast ages before Fuxi, unrecorded in the Six Classics? To speak of them may verge on the fantastical, yet they cannot be entirely dismissed. Consider my own land of Min: only since Wuzhu has it been recorded in the Han, and only after the Tang did it gradually acquire culture and refinement. Before Wuzhu, it must have remained in a state of primitive simplicity. Recently, near Nangshan Temple, farmers plowing the fields suddenly uncovered a cavern filled with vessels of gold and jade, tripods, and ritual bronzes—so many that people secretly carried them away. When the cavern was finally emptied, the villagers all flocked to see it. The bricks, large and small, were carved with figures, dragons, and tigers of exquisite craftsmanship—this was the former cavern. Later, when they struck one wall with hoes and axes, it resounded with a *tang-tang* echo, yet it was too solid to dislodge, likely reinforced with bronze or iron. It must have been the tomb of a ruler, for otherwise, why would the records of Min’s past make no mention of it? Thus, there must have been such things, though they were not transmitted. By the same token, the clans of Rongcheng and Dating cannot be said never to have existed. In that age...\n\nWhen the people knotted cords to use in place of writing, found their food sweet and their garments fine, delighted in their customs and dwelled in peace, when neighboring states lay within sight of one another and the sounds of their roosters and dogs carried between them, yet the people lived to old age and died without ever traveling beyond their lands—such was the age of perfect governance.\n\nNow, however, the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, “There is a worthy in such-and-such a place,” and they pack provisions to hasten toward him. Thus, they abandon their parents at home and forsake their lords’ service abroad, their footprints crisscrossing the borders of the feudal lords, their carriage tracks entangling lands a thousand *li* away. This is the fault of those above who prize knowledge.\n\nIf those above truly favor knowledge yet lack the Dao, the world will fall into great chaos. How do we know this is so? When food is sweet, yet the people below still hunger; when mountains lack paths and tunnels, yet they still carve them out—this is the same as when they hear of a worthy in some place and rush toward him with packed provisions. This is covertly criticizing Mencius and Xunzi, and if we trace it further, Confucius is included as well.\n\nObserve the scholars of the Jixia Academy in Qi and the followers of Su Qin and Zhang Yi, and you will see why Zhuangzi, responding to the customs of his time, made such arguments. To favor knowledge is to depart from the Dao of nature.\n\nThus it is said: to favor knowledge yet lack the Dao—when the knowledge of bows, crossbows, fowling nets, and cunning schemes proliferates, birds are thrown into chaos above; when the knowledge of hooks, bait, dragnets, and fish traps multiplies, fish are thrown into chaos in the waters; when the knowledge of snares, fences, and hunting nets spreads, beasts are thrown into chaos in the marshes; when the transformations of cunning deceit, insidious poison, obstinate confusion, the “hard and white,” the “resolving of grime,” and the “same and different” abound, the common folk are bewildered by sophistry.\n\nThus, the world repeatedly falls into great chaos, and the blame lies in the love of knowledge. *Bi* refers to a handled net; *yi* and *zhuo* denote shooting with arrows; *jibian* means deceptive schemes; *xuege* are what the Han called *chuxu*—like today’s wooden palisades—also used to trap deer and rabbits; *jufu* is another kind of net. “Cunning deceit” means using intelligence to deceive one another; “insidious poison” means gradually corrupting and poisoning one another; *xiejie* means obstinate and unruly; *hua* means muddled and chaotic; *jiegou* means clashing horns. “Hard and white,” “resolving of grime,” and “same and different” were all names used by the disputers of the time. To speak of fishing, fowling, and hunting alongside the sophists is akin to Zhuangzi’s intent in satirizing Zengzi and Shishu alongside bushels and scales—repeatedly, time and again, such things lead to great chaos, all due to the fault of prizing knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the world all knows to seek what it does not know yet does not know to seek what it already knows; all knows to condemn what it does not consider good yet does not know to condemn what it already considers good. This is why there is great chaos.\n\nNot knowing is the pursuit of external and strange things; already knowing refers to what is clear and easily seen—these are the principles of nature. What is not good lies in others; what is already good lies within oneself. This is what *Qi Wu* means by “affirming what one affirms and negating what one negates.” To know only the faults of others while being blind to one’s own rightness is also wrong.\n\nThus, those above obstruct the brightness of the sun and moon, below they scorch the essence of mountains and rivers, and in between they disrupt the workings of the four seasons. Even the creatures that breathe and creep, the tiny and the winged, all lose their nature—how severe is the chaos wrought by the love of knowledge!\n\nFrom the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case: abandoning the people of simple diversity and delighting in the toiling flatterers, forsaking the tranquil and effortless and delighting in the clamorous and contentious. Clamor and contention have already thrown the world into chaos.\n\nAbove, the sun and moon; below, the mountains and rivers; in between, the cold and heat of the four seasons—even the creatures that breathe and creep, the tiny and the winged, all lose the principles of their nature. How severe indeed!\n\nThe chaos wrought by the love of knowledge—this sigh concludes the passage.\n\n*Chuanruan* refers to creatures that breathe and move, clinging to the earth—like worms and snakes. *Xiaoqiao* means small and light, the flying creatures.\n\nThe swarms of bees and butterflies—*xiao* in sound like the rustling wind—embody the myriad forms of fruiting shells. *Ruyi* describes the ceaseless toil of outward striving, while *zhunzhun-nieznie* denotes the murmuring and whispering of contention. The preceding passage having concluded, it now grounds its claim in the Three Dynasties, declaring: \"From the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case.\" The paired phrases *zhunzhun* and *ruyi* are set in parallel, but only *zhunzhun* is singled out to close the argument, echoing the earlier passage: \"When simplicity and plainness prevail, the people’s nature is preserved.\" The *Qiwulun* states: \"Tang’s inquiry of Ji...\"—this is an opening phrase. Here, it says: \"From the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case\"—a closing phrase. Though their openings and closings differ, they turn on the same axis.\n\nThe Outer Chapters, in the eleventh section, *In You*, declare: \"I have heard of letting the world be, but not of governing it.\" *In* means to fear the world’s indulgence in its nature; *you* means to fear the world’s deviation from its virtue. If the world neither indulges its nature nor deviates from its virtue, who would need to govern it? In ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he made its people joyful, each delighting in their nature—yet this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made its people weary, each suffering in their nature—yet this was not contentment. That which is neither tranquil nor content is not virtue; and that which is not virtue cannot endure long in the world. Thus: \"I have heard of letting the world be, not of governing it.\" This passage again opens with a thematic statement, adopting yet another form.\n\n*In* conveys the sense of ease and self-possession—indulgence is disorder. In stillness, there is no indulgence. *You* conveys the sense of magnanimity and self-contentment—deviation is being swayed by external things. If the nature of the world’s people is not disordered and their virtue is not swayed by externals, what need is there for governance? Neither tranquility nor stillness, neither contentment nor joy—Yao is contrasted with Jie, just as Zeng and Shi are contrasted with Robber Zhi. The momentum of the entire text follows this pattern, though its principles remain uncorrected. Yet who could match its literary force? To equate the lack of tranquility with the lack of contentment is to disregard their weight.\n\nWhen one’s joy is excessive, it injures the yang; when one’s anger is excessive, it injures the yin. When yin and yang are both injured, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is disrupted, and their inversion harms the human form. Thus, people’s joy and anger lose their proper place; their dwellings become unsettled; their thoughts grow restless and uncentered; the mean is no longer ordered. From this, the world first becomes haughty, perverse, and fierce—leading later to the conduct of Robber Zhi, Zeng, and Shi.\n\nTherefore, even if the entire world were mobilized to reward the good, it would not suffice; even if the entire world were mobilized to punish the wicked, it would not be enough. The vastness of the world is inadequate for such rewards and punishments. From the Three Dynasties onward, the world has been in tumult, ever preoccupied with rewards and punishments. How could it have leisure to nurture the true essence of its nature and destiny?\n\nJoy pertains to yang; anger, to yin. *Pi* means excess—the medical texts call this \"the illness of surplus.\" When the mean and harmony are achieved, Heaven and Earth assume their proper positions. Without the mean and harmony, the four seasons fail to arrive, and the balance of cold and heat is lost. When the sequence of qi is inverted, people fall ill.\n\n*Shi ren* refers to the way Yao and Jie, from their positions above, brought about such conditions in the people. Joy and anger lose their proper place; dwellings become unsettled—this is reckless action and movement. \"Restless thoughts, coming and going, following friends and companions\"—this is the mind uncentered. *Cheng zhang* means order and coherence. Without order, the mean is lost.\n\nExaltation strives for loftiness yet overreaches; *jie* denotes arguments that interrogate and reproach. *Zhuo* means isolation; *zhi*, ferocity and severity. These four terms all describe the meaning of disharmony. Robber Zhi and Zeng Shen and Shi Yu merely substitute the words \"worthy\" and \"unworthy\"—when the mind is not in harmony, neither worthiness nor unworthiness is genuine.\n\nThose who govern the world reward the so-called worthy and punish the so-called unworthy. Yet what passes for worthiness is not true worthiness, arising from a fondness for pretense—such is the way of the entire world. Thus, the desire to reward is never sufficient, nor is the capacity to do so. This speaks to the multitude of such people in the world. The intent here is to satirize the \"worthy,\" contrasting them with evildoers, thereby heavily suppressing the truly worthy.\n\nWhen all people admire rewards and shun punishments, engaging in pretense among themselves, how can they ever settle into the natural principles of their nature and destiny? Moreover, delighting in \"clarity\" is lewdness in form; delighting in \"keenness\" is lewdness in sound. Delighting in \"benevolence\" is disorder in virtue; delighting in \"righteousness\" is perversion of principle. Delighting in \"ritual\" is competition in technique; delighting in \"music\" is competition in excess. Delighting in \"sagacity\" is competition in artistry; delighting in \"knowledge\" is competition in fault-finding.\n\nIf these eight remain in the world, the true essence of nature and destiny may yet endure; if they vanish, it may yet endure. But when the world fails to preserve the true essence of nature and destiny, these eight begin to shred, coil, and entangle it, throwing the world into chaos. Yet the world then reveres and cherishes them—how profound is the world’s delusion! Is this merely a matter of excess to be discarded? Instead, they fast and purify themselves to speak of them, kneel and sit to present them, drum and sing to dance for them. What is to be done about this?\n\nPursuing \"clarity\" and favoring the five colors, or pursuing \"keenness\" and favoring the five sounds—both disrupt one’s true nature. Thus it is said: excess in virtue and departure from natural principle—benevolence and righteousness are contrived with intention, thereby causing disorder in virtue and perversion of principle. Skill and ability—excess in music—are external matters, hence \"competition in technique\" and \"competition in excess,\" meaning they assist and amplify, making matters worse. Artistry and craft.\n\nIllness and affliction—these are the consequences of one’s own toil and suffering. Delighting in the names of \"sageliness\" and \"knowledge,\" one toils and suffers all the more. Thus it is said: \"competition in craft\" and \"competition in affliction.\" This term *sheng* (sageliness) is merely akin to the *neng* (ability) in \"grass-sage\" (calligraphic mastery), as used today. Even in the case of thieves, it is said: \"recklessly conjecturing the treasures within a house—this is *sheng* (cunning).\" Here, the meaning of the character differs, and readers must distinguish for themselves, lest they confuse it with the sense of *sheng* in the *Mengzi*.\n\nThe eight—clarity, keenness, benevolence, righteousness, ritual, music, sageliness, and knowledge—if one rests in naturalness, though they exist, cannot become burdens. Thus it is said: their presence is acceptable, and their absence is acceptable. If one does not rest in naturalness, then the eight become harmful. *Luǎn juǎn jú shù* describes the appearance of being carved, rolled, constrained, and bound; *cāng náng* describes the appearance of meddlesome busyness. \"Is this merely a matter of excess to be discarded?\" means one does not merely dabble in a single transgression before immediately ceasing.\n\n\"Fasting and purifying to speak of them\" refers to treating them with solemnity and exaggerating their importance. \"Kneeling and sitting to present them\" means offering them with utmost reverence and ceremony. \"Drumming and singing to dance for them\" means that words alone are insufficient, so one resorts to hand-dancing and foot-stamping. All these mock the scholars of the time. \"What is to be done about this?\" asks: what, after all, are you all doing?\n\nI do not speak of myself but rather point to others—just as the *Odes* says, \"I will pour from that golden goblet,\" where a wife refers to her husband, or the *Documents* says, \"I drowned my sorrow in wine,\" where a minister refers to King Zhou. This is a matter of literary convention. Thus, when the noble person cannot avoid governing the world, nothing is better than non-action. Only through non-action can one preserve the natural dispositions of life and destiny. Therefore, one who values their person over ruling the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their person over ruling the world may be charged with the world.\n\nIf the noble person can refrain from disturbing their five viscera or overtaxing their faculties, abiding in stillness like a dormant dragon yet manifesting like a dragon in flight, remaining silent as a deep abyss yet thundering like a storm, moving with spirit yet following heaven’s course, and acting with effortless non-action—then the myriad things will transform of themselves, as if steaming and piling up. How then would I have leisure to govern the world?\n\nThis passage directly expounds the governance of non-action and naturalness. The phrase \"cannot avoid\" already conveys the idea of possessing the world yet not engaging with it. Because one’s person is more valuable than ruling the world, only then can the world be entrusted to them; because one’s person is more beloved than ruling the world, only then can the world be charged to them. These two lines are both strikingly phrased and profoundly reasoned. In reading the *Zhuangzi*, one must carefully ponder such passages.\n\nThe *Record of Rites* says, \"When the restraints of sinew and bone are loosened,\" this means the five viscera are no longer bound. *Zhuó* means to draw out; here, it refers to overusing one’s faculties.\n\nOne who \"dwells like a corpse\" abides in stillness as a corpse does—this is what the *Classic of Rites* means by \"sitting like a corpse.\" *Dragon* signifies pattern and brilliance. Dwelling like a corpse in non-action, one’s bearing naturally becomes a model, hence the phrase \"dwelling like a corpse yet dragon manifest.\" *Abyss* denotes depth; *silence*, the absence of speech. *Thunderous voice* stirs others—though one does not speak, one’s virtue moves them, much as Chan masters say: though silent, their voice resounds like thunder. Thus, \"abyssal silence yet thunderous voice.\" *Spirit* is the numinous; *Heaven*, the heavenly principle. In every movement and gesture, nothing departs from the heavenly principle, hence \"spirit moves and Heaven follows.\" Can these three lines truly mark the *Zhuangzi* as a heretical text? Its principles are profound, its phrasing extraordinary—thus it surpasses all other masters.\n\n*Steaming and piling* evokes the image of \"wild horses and dust motes,\" where living things breathe upon one another in mutual animation. *Steaming* is movement; *piling*, the accumulation of fine, innumerable particles. In an empty chamber where sunlight enters like an egg, one may observe the dust in the beam—these two words are strikingly chosen: seeming to move yet not moving, seeming many yet without visible multitude. Thus, \"steaming and piling.\" If I were to practice non-action above, the people below would rise at sunrise and rest at sunset, content and at ease, like the myriad things steaming and piling of their own accord. Why then should I trouble myself to govern them?\n\nCui Qu asked Lao Dan, \"If one does not govern the world, how can the human heart be settled?\" Lao Dan replied, \"Take care not to disturb the human heart. The human heart presses downward when suppressed and surges upward when indulged; in its rising and falling, it is imprisoned and slain. Supple and yielding, it may soften the rigid; sharp and incisive, it may be carved and polished. Its heat scorches like fire, its cold congeals like ice, its swiftness darts like lightning. In the span of a single bow and rise, it may twice caress the ends of the earth. Abiding, it is abyssal and still; moving, it hangs suspended like Heaven. Proud and untetherable—is this not the human heart?\"\n\nThis passage, when read alongside Mencius’ \"entering and exiting without fixed time, direction unknown,\" reveals its extraordinary depth. *Undisturbed* means unagitated, free from disruption. *Pressing downward* describes the heart in low spirits, appearing ever more despondent; when favored, it ceaselessly seeks advancement. *Upward* denotes the heart’s aspiration; *downward*, its descent. Whether rising or falling, it is imprisoned and slain—self-ensnared and self-tormented. *Supple and graceful* describes beauty; the strong may be softened by it, as Xiang Yu wept before Lady Yu. *Sharp and incisive* refers to angularity; *carved and polished*, to refinement through grinding.\n\nAs the proverb says: \"Entering as water caltrops, emerging as cockscombs\"—this is precisely its meaning. Young men of early success retain some angularity, but once they encounter hardship and worldly affairs, all is worn smooth. Thus it is said: *sharp and incisive*, *carved and polished*—at times like scorching fire, at others like congealed ice. All describe the heart in moments of agitation, anger, sorrow, or fear. In a single breath, its movements surge and recede as though standing once more beyond the four seas—so swift is its haste.\n\n*Thus it hangs suspended*—this is to *press downward*, as if passing by in an instant. *Abyssal and still*—this speaks of the heart’s unmoving state. *Moving, it hangs suspended like Heaven*—this describes the moment a thought arises, as though strung from the sky. *Proud and untetherable*—*proud* here shares its sense with *fèn* (indignant fury), evoking a defiant, ungovernable bearing. *Untetherable* means beyond restraint. The Buddhist sutras ask: \"How to subdue the heart?\" Observe the word *subdue*—it reveals the meaning of *proud and untetherable*. This passage portrays the human heart with extraordinary subtlety; even Zhuangzi’s brush could hardly surpass it.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to disrupt the human heart. Yao and Shun, in turn, wore the flesh from their thighs and the hair from their shins to nourish the bodies of the world, fretted over their five viscera to enact benevolence and righteousness, and strained their blood and qi to establish laws and standards—yet still they could not prevail. Yao then banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong, exiled the Three Miao to the Three Weirs, and cast Gong Gong into Youdu—this was his failure to master the world. By the time of the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great turmoil. Below arose Jie and Robber Zhi; above, Zeng and Shi; and the Confucians and Mohists all emerged. Joy and anger grew suspicious of one another, the foolish and wise deceived each other, good and evil reviled one another, and truth and falsehood mocked each other—thus the world declined. Great virtue diverged, and the threads of nature and destiny unraveled. The world prized cunning, and the common people exhausted themselves in pursuit.\n\nThe phrase \"股无胈\" signifies that the flesh of the thighs does not grow, while \"胫无毛\" speaks of wearing out one's legs. \"矜\" is pronounced *qin* and is the same as *qín*, meaning the shaft of a spear. The *Xiang Ji Zhuan* states, \"hoes and spears with thornwood shafts\"—this speaks of the rigidity of one's blood and qi. It is as if to say, one's inner vitality is exhausted. \"规\" means \"to create.\" This describes how, in their efforts to establish benevolence, righteousness, and legal standards, they labored to such an extent. Yet despite this toil, there remained matters they could not overcome, hence the punishments of exile and banishment—this is what is meant by \"not prevailing over the world.\" The \"four crimes\" brought the world into submission, which was originally an achievement of Shun, but Zhuangzi attributes it to Yao. Thus, though the wording may vary, the marvelous and strange are still evident. In the *Seeing the World* chapter, this is where the inconsistencies lie—it is as if the truth has been laid bare: even Yao and Shun were thus, and by the time it extended to the Three Kings, the terror only grew greater.\n\n\"施\" means \"to extend.\" Since the Three Kings were thus, below, the petty men followed the ways of Jie and Robber Zhi, while above, the gentlemen admired the reputations of Zeng and Shi, giving rise to the conflicts of the Confucians and Mohists. From this, each took joy in their own views and grew angry at others, each considered themselves wise and others foolish, each deemed themselves good and others evil, each believed themselves truthful and others deceitful. Both sides were the same, hence the mutual suspicion, deception, reproach, and mockery—this is the meaning of the *Equalizing Things* chapter: \"That too has its right and wrong, this too has its right and wrong.\" The term \"烂漫\" is well-chosen: the principles of nature and destiny became utterly disordered. \"求竭\" means that there was nothing left to respond with.\n\nThus, axes and saws were fashioned, inked marking lines and executions were employed, and mallets and chisels were wielded—the world fell into great chaos. The fault lay in disturbing the human heart. Therefore, the worthy retreated to dwell beneath the towering cliffs of great mountains, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled with fear in their ancestral halls. In this age, those condemned to death lie heaped upon one another, those in cangues and stocks jostle in crowds, and those subjected to punishment and execution are seen everywhere. Yet the Confucians and Mohists still stretch forth their arms and raise their fists amidst the fetters and shackles. Alas! How extreme is their shamelessness and lack of remorse!\n\nHow do I know that the wisdom of the sages does not become the cangues and stocks of the world? That benevolence and righteousness do not become the fetters and chisels? How do I know that Zeng and Shi are not the first arrows of Jie and Robber Zhi? Therefore, it is said: \"Abandon sageliness, discard wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered.\"\n\nThis is a summary of the earlier point about not prevailing over the world, leading to the use of punishments. Axes, saws, inked marking lines, mallets, and chisels are all instruments of punishment. \"绳\" refers to binding restraints, while \"墨\" means tattooing or branding.\n\nThe term \"脊脊\" suggests borrowing and dependence, while \"罪在撄人心\" refers to the crime of disturbing the human heart—this began with the Yellow Emperor. The worthy fled into hiding and did not emerge, yet their rulers exhausted themselves on behalf of the world, and those who suffered punishment were many. The state of affairs was as dire as this, yet the Confucians and Mohists still proudly elevated themselves amidst a world of sinners. Thus it is said: \"they stretch forth their arms and raise their fists amidst the fetters and shackles.\" \"离跂\" means to stand on tiptoe, \"攘臂\" means to wave one’s arms in animated speech—this describes their self-aggrandizement. Alas! How extreme is their conduct! The Confucians and Mohists in this context are truly shameless. The two instances of \"甚矣\" above and below differ in meaning, yet both are striking turns of phrase.\n\n\"桁杨\" refers to penal instruments, and \"相推\" describes how the condemned press against one another. The existence of \"桁杨椄槢\" stems from sagely wisdom, just as \"桎梏凿枘\" stems from benevolence and righteousness. The theories of Zeng and Shi provide cover for harm, making them the first arrows of Jie and Robber Zhi. \"椄槢\" refers to the crossbar in a cangue, or the wedge within. \"嚆矢\" is the whistling arrow of today.\n\nAfter the Yellow Emperor had ruled as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, his decrees spread throughout the world. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelled on Mount Kongtong, he went to visit him, saying: \"I have heard that you have attained the utmost Dao. May I ask about the essence of the utmost Dao? I wish to draw upon the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to govern yin and yang to bring all living things to fruition. How may this be done?\"\n\nGuangchengzi replied: \"What you wish to inquire about is the substance of things, and what you wish to govern is the ruin of things. Ever since you began ordering the world, clouds have rained without gathering, trees have withered without yellowing, and the light of the sun and moon has grown ever more dim. As for the hearts of flatterers, ever shallow—how could they be worthy of discussing the utmost Dao? To draw upon the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains is to bring harmony and allow the myriad things to flourish. To govern yin and yang to bring all living things to fruition is to harmonize and regulate yin and yang to accord with the myriad things. Each should fulfill its proper office. When yin and yang do not conflict and each fulfills its office, this is called 'governing.' The inherent nature of things is called 'substance'—this is what was earlier referred to as the utmost Dao. What harms things is called 'ruin.' Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, are all principles of spontaneity. The five grains and the multitude of living things likewise grow and flourish of themselves. To impose the mind upon them in governance is instead to harm them.\"\n\n\"而\" here refers to the Yellow Emperor. \"族\" means to gather. Clouds raining without gathering means that here there is rain while there is none. Withering without yellowing means losing their season. \"荒\" refers to the sun and moon suffering eclipses, their light diminished and abandoned. \"翦翦\" means shallow.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread white couch grass, and lived in seclusion for three months. He then went again to seek Guangchengzi. Guangchengzi lay with his head to the south. The Yellow Emperor approached from the lower side, crawling forward on his knees, bowing twice, knocking his head to the ground, and asked: \"I have heard that you have attained the utmost Dao. May I ask how to cultivate the body so that it may endure for long?\"\n\nGuangchengzi rose abruptly and said: \"Excellent question! Come, I will tell you of the utmost Dao. The essence of the utmost Dao is profound and distant; the ultimate of the utmost Dao is dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, know nothing—your spirit will guard your form, and your form will endure long. It is not called 'ordering the world' but 'cultivating the body,' and thus I consider it an excellent question. '窈窈冥冥' means distant and unfathomable; '昏昏默默' means obscure and invisible. '无视无听' means forgetting both ears and eyes.\"\n\nThe spirit abiding in the heart is called \"embracing stillness and non-action,\" and the form will naturally align. The spirit must be pure and still; the form must not be wearied, nor the qi disturbed—only then can one attain long life. All arts of cultivation and refinement originate from this. Whether immortals or buddhas, they have always existed since ancient times; this is not a teaching invented by Zhuangzi.\n\n\"Without toil, without disturbance\"—this \"without\" is akin to \"do not,\" conveying a prohibitive sense. \"Eyes seeing nothing, ears hearing nothing, the heart knowing nothing\" further explains \"seeing nothing, hearing nothing.\" \"Embracing the spirit in stillness\"—when the spirit guards the form, one may attain long life. This \"spirit\" is what modern practitioners of self-cultivation call the \"infant.\"\n\n\"Be cautious within, close yourself without.\" Excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I have led you to the source of great brightness, the origin of utmost yang. I have guided you into the gate of the profound and distant, the origin of utmost yin. Heaven and earth have their offices; yin and yang have their repositories. Guard your body carefully, and things will naturally flourish. I preserve the One and dwell in harmony. Thus, I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined.\n\n\"Be cautious within\"—do not let the heart be moved. \"Close yourself without\"—do not allow external things to disturb your heart. Any excess of knowledge becomes a burden. Only when one knows nothing does virtue remain whole; thus, it is said that excessive knowledge leads to ruin.\n\nThe beginning of utmost yang is great brightness; the beginning of utmost yin is the profound and distant. \"Origin\" means beginning. \"Above great brightness\" is above the great void; \"the gate of the profound and distant\" is the inception of the boundless. The *Yijing* speaks of \"the Dao of one yin and one yang\"—this is the same principle. However, its expression is more reserved, while Zhuangzi’s words are more forthright. \"For you\" means \"to teach you\"; \"led you\" means \"guided you,\" akin to \"proceeded.\"\n\nEntering the ultimate—this means desiring to teach you to reach this extremity. The offices and repositories are the organs and viscera. This speaks of how the human body itself possesses heaven and earth, yin and yang. When my heaven and earth each fulfill their offices, when my yin and yang each reside in their proper places, then this body may be guarded with care, and all things will naturally become firm. \"Things\" refers to all that belongs to this body. Thus it is said, \"Things will naturally strengthen themselves.\" What is guarded is the One, without admixture; what is dwelled in is nothing that is not harmonious and compliant. This is why, though my form has endured for one thousand two hundred years, it has never declined.\n\n\"To dwell\" means to engage with affairs and things, to respond when stimulated. Heaven and earth are the vigor and compliance of this body. The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and said, \"What you speak of, Master Vast Accomplishment, is truly heaven!\" Master Vast Accomplishment said, \"Come, let me tell you: those things are without end, yet people all take them to be finite; those things are unfathomable, yet people all take them to be limited. Those who attain my Dao become emperors above and kings below; those who lose my Dao appear as light above and become earth below. Now, the hundred flourishing things all arise from earth and return to earth. Thus, I shall leave you and enter the gate of the boundless, to wander in the wilds of the infinite. I share the radiance of the sun and moon, I am constant with heaven and earth. When I coil myself, I am distant; when I obscure myself, I vanish from men. Will they all perish while I alone endure?\"\n\n\"Master Vast Accomplishment’s words are heaven\" means that he may unite with heaven as one. How could things have an end when people insist on seeking their termination? How could things be fathomed when people insist on seeking their limits? Thus, the bounded follows the boundless. These two lines are profoundly meaningful. Spoken crudely, it is like forging iron to make a threshold—when struck, it elicits laughter, yet this is the same idea. The *Yijing* does not end with *Jiji* (Completion) but with *Weiji* (Incompletion), for it knows that things are without end and without measure. When Confucius stood by the river and said, \"What passes is like this,\" he too pointed to their boundlessness and unfathomability.\n\nAbove, one may become an emperor; below, one may become a king. These terms \"emperor\" and \"king\" refer to the perfection of inner sageliness and outer kingship, as in the chapter \"Under Heaven.\" The emperor embodies non-action; the king embodies action. This is not the Three Sovereigns or the kings of the Three Dynasties. \"Appearing as light above\" refers to the sun and moon; \"becoming earth below\" refers to the ground.\n\nDwelling between heaven and earth, one is muddled and without knowledge—looking up, one sees only the sun and moon; looking down, one sees only the earth below. The hundred flourishing things and the hundred creatures are born from the soil and return to the soil; leaves fall and roots are restored. The putrid transforms into the wondrous, and the wondrous transforms into the putrid—this is the meaning of \"depart from you,\" the meaning of leaving the human realm. The \"Gate of the Boundless\" and the \"Wilderness of the Limitless\" refer to what lies beyond heaven and earth.\n\nOne may endure as long as the sun, moon, heaven, and earth, thus it is said: \"Sharing the light of the sun and moon, becoming constant with heaven and earth.\" *Mín* is akin to *fáng*, meaning dim and obscure. \"Those that encounter me\" come toward me; \"those that distance themselves from me\" turn away from me. The coming and going of things, I remain oblivious and unknowing—thus it is said: \"Those that encounter me are dim; those that distance themselves from me are obscure.\"\n\nCloud General was roaming eastward when he passed the branch of the *Fuyao* tree and happened upon Hong Hu. Hong Hu was just then slapping his thighs and leaping about in play. Cloud General, seeing him, halted in astonishment and stood motionless, saying: \"Old sir, who are you? Old sir, what are you doing?\" Hong Hu continued slapping his thighs and leaping without pause. Cloud General said: \"I wander.\" Cloud General said: \"I wish to ask you something.\" Hong Hu looked up at Cloud General and said: \"Hmm?\" Cloud General said: \"The qi of heaven is disharmonious; the qi of earth is pent up. The six qi are out of balance; the four seasons are disordered. Now I wish to blend the essence of the six qi to nurture the multitude of beings. How might this be done?\" Hong Hu slapped his thighs, leaped, and shook his head, saying: \"I do not know. I do not know.\" Cloud General could not press his question.\n\nThree years later, Cloud General roamed eastward again and passed through the wilds of Song, where he once more happened upon Hong Hu. Cloud General rejoiced greatly, hastened forward, and said: \"Has Heaven forgotten me? Has Heaven forgotten me?\" He bowed twice, touching his head to the ground, and wished to ask Hong Hu a question. Hong Hu said: \"I drift without knowing what I seek; I roam wildly without knowing where I go. Wandering, I am careworn, observing the unanticipated. What do I know?\" Cloud General said: \"I too believed myself to be roaming wildly, yet the people follow wherever I go. I cannot escape the people—now they have become my undoing. I wish to hear a single word from you.\"\n\nHong Hu said: \"You disrupt the warp of heaven and contravene the nature of things. Heaven’s mystery cannot be completed. You dissolve the herds of beasts, and the birds all cry out at night. Disaster befalls the grasses and trees; calamity reaches even the insects. Alas! This is the error of governing men.\"\n\nThe branch of the *Fuyao* tree is the *Fusang*, the place where the sun rises. *Fǔ bì jué yuè* describes his joyful leaping. *Tǎngrán* depicts his sudden loss of composure; *pīrán* depicts his towering stillness. *Sǒu* refers to Hong Hu.\n\nWhen Zhaozhou met Touzi returning from buying oil, he said: \"I have long heard of Touzi—today I see only an oil-buying old man.\" Touzi replied: \"Oil, oil—just look.\" In Chan, this matter is thus revealed. Cloud General said \"wander\" (*yóu*), which is Zhuangzi’s way of describing animation. The character for \"oil\" (*yóu*) differs from \"wander\" (*yóu*), and is not to be taken as the same. Without pause, he replied: \"I wander.\" Looking up, he said: \"Hmm?\" The question of nurturing the multitude of beings is the same as the question the Yellow Emperor once posed. *Diào tóu* means to shake one’s head. \"Has Heaven forgotten me?\"—*zhèn* means \"I.\" He calls Hong Hu \"Heaven,\" saying: \"We met once before—do you still remember? How could you have forgotten?\" *Fúyóu* means to roam about; *chāngkuáng* means unrestrained and unbridled. \"Without knowing what I seek\" means having no aim.\n\n\"‘Not knowing whither to go’ means having no destination. *Yāngzhǎng fēngǔ* means being overwhelmed and confused. *Wúwàng* is authenticity. Roaming amid a world overwhelmed and confused, one yet observes one’s own authenticity—this is unavoidable in speaking to the people. One wishes to refuse and sever such speech, yet cannot. *Fàng xiào* means to imitate. The people take me as their model. The constant principles of Heaven and the true nature of things are all simply spontaneous. Now, if one acts with intention, this is to disrupt and invert their spontaneity. How can one achieve the transformation of spontaneity? Thus it is said: ‘The mysterious Heaven does not complete’—*xū* means emptiness, akin to ‘prior to Heaven.’ When beasts gather in herds without contention, there is no distinction of ‘you’ and ‘me,’ no division of ‘same’ and ‘different.’ Now, if each departs from its herd, this is to create ‘you and me,’ ‘same and different.’ When birds all cry out at night, it is alarm. If one cannot assist things in preserving their spontaneity, causing them to lose their nature, then grasses, trees, and insects all suffer harm. All this begins with the intention to govern others—just as previously stated, the fault lies in disturbing the human heart.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"Then what am I to do?\"\nHong Hu replied: \"Ah! Poisonous indeed! Float away, float away—return!\"\nCloud General said: \"I have encountered a Heaven-sent difficulty. I wish to hear a single word.\"\nHong Hu said: \"Ah! Nurture your heart-mind. Dwell in solitude, practice non-action, and things will transform of themselves. Cast off your bodily form, expel your cleverness, forget all distinctions, and merge with the great sameness of the primordial vastness. Dissolve your heart-mind, release your spirit, and be utterly without soul. The ten thousand things, teeming and swarming, each return to their root. Each returns to their root yet does not know it—profoundly muddled, they pass their lives without departure. If they knew it, this would already be departure. Do not inquire into their names, do not pry into their natures. Things arise of themselves.\"\n\nCloud General said: \"Heaven has bestowed virtue upon me and shown me silence. I have sought it in my person, and only now have I attained it.\" He bowed twice, touched his head to the ground, rose, took his leave, and departed.\n\n\"Then what am I to do?\" means: now that it is thus, how can it be made right? \"Poisonous indeed!\"\n\nThe phrase \"Alas, bitter! Alas, bitter!\" is indeed what the stone-head master meant. \"Swiftly departing\" describes how you, having already poisoned and tormented yourself, should hasten away without further inquiry. This fabricated dialogue resembles the exchanges in the *Lamp Records*. \"Nurturing the heart-mind\" means that when you cease to nourish this heart-mind, it is already nurtured—it is not called \"nurturing the heart-mind\" but \"heart-mind nurturing,\" and one must discern this carefully. \"Merely\" means you should simply abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. \"Transform\" implies the ceaseless coming and going, the self-arising and self-transforming of things. Discard all your former cleverness and leave none of it behind. \"Align and merge\" means to sink and dissolve, forgetting both self and things, thus merging with the great sameness of the primordial vastness. \"Primordial vastness\" is formless and traceless, the state before qi arose. \"Dissolve the heart-mind\" means to dissolve the heart-mind that possesses a heart-mind. \"Release the spirit\" means to release the spirit that possesses knowledge. \"Utterly still\" means to settle. \"Without soul\" means without knowledge. Essence is called *po*; spirit is called *hun*. \"Without soul\" echoes the earlier phrase \"lump-like, standing by its form alone.\" The heart-mind in \"dissolving the heart-mind\" differs from that in \"nurturing the heart-mind,\" just as the spirit in \"releasing the spirit\" differs from that in \"embracing the spirit to attain stillness.\" These terms require careful reflection.\n\n\"Teeming and swarming\" describes their multitude. Each returns to its root, for what is born must perish. Though it perishes, it does not truly perish, for what perishes is reborn. Thus, each returns to its root yet does not know it—profoundly muddled, without knowledge or awareness, this is the state of *hundun*. In *hundun*, one passes one’s life without departing from the Dao. But if one possesses knowledge and awareness, one becomes divided from the Dao. Thus, \"if they knew it, this would already be departure.\" This line is most precise and demands close attention. \"Name\" refers to all distinctions; \"nature\" refers to likes and dislikes. \"Pry\" means to perceive. Without inquiry or perception, there are no distinctions, no likes or dislikes—this is non-action and spontaneity. If I can embody non-action and spontaneity, then each thing follows its own nature, for this is its inherent condition. Thus, \"things arise of themselves.\" \"Inherent\" means naturally so.\n\n\"Bestowed\" means granted to me. \"Silence\" means non-speech. Heaven granted me the virtue of spontaneity and revealed to me the principle of non-speech. Seeking it within myself, I have now attained it—this is personal realization. \"Within myself\" means that by seeking within my own person, I have obtained what I sought. Thereupon, he bowed, expressed his gratitude, and departed.\n\nOrdinary people delight in those who agree with them and resent those who differ. They desire agreement and reject difference, for their hearts are set on standing out from the crowd. Yet how can one who sets his heart on standing out ever truly stand out? Relying on the crowd for comfort, his knowledge does not surpass theirs. Yet he desires to govern a state—this is grasping at the benefits of the Three Kings while blind to the perils. To govern a state with such intentions is to rely on luck. How often can one rely on luck without losing the state? The odds of preserving it are less than one in ten thousand, while the odds of losing it are more than ten thousand to one. How lamentable that those who possess lands do not understand this!\n\nFrom this point to the end of the chapter, Zhuangzi expounds further: desiring others to agree with oneself and resenting their differences is to place oneself above the multitude. Insisting that others conform to one’s own views before feeling at ease, how is one different from the crowd? Though one may wish to stand out, how can one do so? If one claims unique insight, it must be that no one else understands—yet if one desires everyone to agree, then one’s skills are no greater than the multitude’s. Laozi said, \"If those who know me are few, then I am noble.\" Zhuangzi here echoes this sentiment, much like Han Tuizhi’s discussion of literature, which also reflects this idea. With such a mindset, one seeks to govern a state, grasping at the benefits of the Three Kings while blind to the inevitable harm. To govern a state with such intentions is to rely on luck. With luck as one’s aim, one sees only ruin and no success. How can those who possess lands fail to recognize the deception of such men?\n\nThose who possess lands possess great things. Those who possess great things cannot be possessed by things, yet they can master things. Only by mastering things can one perceive the error of those who are mastered by things. How could this apply merely to governing the world and its people? They move in and out of the six directions, roam the nine provinces, coming and going alone—this is called \"possessing singularity.\" Those who possess singularity are called \"the most noble.\"\n\nThose who are mastered by things have intentions and traces; those who are not mastered by things act without acting, spontaneously and naturally. Without acting, there is nothing they do not do. Thus, \"not mastered by things, they can master things.\" If one knows the thing that masters things, how could this apply merely to governing the world? Thus, \"they move in and out of the six directions, roam the nine provinces.\" This speaks of the Dao transcending the myriad things. They move freely within creation, merging with Heaven as one—no one can divide them. Thus, \"coming and going alone is called possessing singularity.\" Such is the most noble.\n\nThe teachings of the great person are like the shadow following the form, the echo responding to the sound. When questioned, they respond fully, expressing all they hold within, matching the world as its counterpart. They dwell where there is no echo, move where there is no path. They lead you to return to the restless realm, wandering without beginning or end, entering and exiting without boundary, sharing no origin with the sun. They chant and discourse on the body, merging with the great sameness. In the great sameness, there is no self—how could there be possession? Those who perceive possession are the gentlemen of old; those who perceive non-possession are friends of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe great person is the perfected person, the one who possesses singularity. Form must have shadow; sound must have echo—this is spontaneity. When questioned, they respond fully, expressing all they hold within. This is to face the world alone, bearing its vastness with one’s person. I am the host; the counterpart is the guest. Without echo, without sound, without scent, without trace. \"Restless\" describes ceaseless activity. \"To return\" is to go. \"Lead\" means to guide. \"You\" refers to all in the world. \"Return\" means to go back. They guide all in the world to return to the restless realm, meaning that though they transcend the world, they do not depart from it—transcendence and worldliness are not two separate dharmas. \"Without beginning\" means without origin.\n\nThe boundless extends in all four directions—no limits in any quarter. Moving in and out, roaming freely within, day after day, one sees no end, nor can one know the beginning. Thus it is said: \"With the sun, without beginning.\" To speak of the physical form is to praise it—harmonizing within Heaven and Earth, all share this same body. Thus it is said: \"Harmonizing,\" a great ode of praise. Since my body is one with the myriad things, it cannot be selfish—this is the absence of self. Having no self, what then is \"having\"? It is just as Pang the Layman said: \"Empty all that is present; do not substantiate what is absent.\"\n\nThe ancients, the noble ones, saw only the \"having\" and became friends with Heaven and Earth. Yet only when they saw the \"without\" did they truly see. When they spoke of \"the ancients, the noble ones,\" from Yao and Shun downward, all were included. That which is base yet cannot be shunned is *things*. That which is lowly yet cannot be forsaken is *the people*. That which is hidden yet cannot be avoided is *affairs*. That which is coarse yet cannot be discarded is *laws*. That which is distant yet cannot be abandoned is *righteousness*. That which is intimate yet cannot be narrowed is *benevolence*. That which is regulated yet cannot be neglected is *ritual*. That which is centered yet cannot be lowered is *virtue*. That which is unified yet cannot be fixed is the *Dao*. That which is numinous yet cannot be left undone is *Heaven*.\n\nObserving this passage, one sees that Master Zhuang still engages with worldly affairs—he does not merely discourse on emptiness and nothingness. Cheng Yi’s remark that the Buddhists have *shangda* (ascending understanding) but lack *xiaxue* (descending learning) is most apt. Yet even in these few lines, there are points akin to *xiaxue*, and an intent that the refined and the coarse are inseparable. If the Dao is esteemed, then things are deemed base—yet how can one abandon things? Thus it is said: \"That which is base yet cannot be shunned is *things*\"—*ren* (任) means to employ. If the Dao is exalted, then what resides in people is lowly—yet how can one stand apart from people? Thus it is said: \"That which is lowly yet cannot be forsaken is *the people*\"—*yin* (因) means to rely upon. *Ni* (匿) means concealment, obscurity. The Dao is clarity, but when contrasted with affairs, affairs become obscure—yet how can one entirely forsake worldly affairs? Thus it is said: \"That which is hidden yet cannot be avoided is *affairs*.\" The Dao is the refined; laws are the coarse—yet how can laws be entirely discarded? Thus it is said: \"That which is coarse yet cannot be discarded is *laws*.\" Righteousness is distant from the Dao—yet how can righteousness be abandoned? Thus it is said: \"That which is distant yet cannot be abandoned is *righteousness*.\" The Dao is without partiality, while benevolence entails affection. Though not the ultimate Dao, how can benevolence be forsaken? It must be extended broadly. Thus it is said: \"That which is intimate yet cannot be narrowed is *benevolence*.\" Ritual involves regulation and ornamentation, seeming forced—yet it cannot be neglected. Thus it is said: \"That which is regulated yet cannot be neglected is *ritual*.\" The rituals number three hundred, the deportments three thousand—how could these be accomplished by one person in a single day? Thus it is said: \"Accumulate\"—virtue is what all people share. Though one may harmonize with the world, there are places where one must stand apart—how can one be the same as others? Thus it is said: \"That which is centered yet cannot be lowered is *virtue*\"—*zhong* (中) means harmony. That which is unified in spontaneity is the Dao—yet there are times when change is necessary. How can one cling to oneness without transformation? Thus it is said: \"That which is unified yet cannot be fixed is the *Dao*.\" The numinous is that which cannot be known—Heaven’s works are all unknowable. Yet human affairs cannot be left undone—how can one entirely entrust them to the unknowable? Thus it is said: \"That which is numinous yet cannot be left undone is *Heaven*.\"\n\nTherefore, the sage observes Heaven yet does not assist its completion; embodies virtue yet is not burdened; emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme; guards benevolence yet does not rely upon it; values righteousness yet does not accumulate it; responds to ritual yet does not conceal; engages with affairs yet does not yield; aligns with laws yet is not disordered; depends upon the people yet does not slight them; relies upon things yet does not abandon them. Things are not worth doing—yet they cannot be left undone.\n\nNot assisting means not forcing effort. What lies in people cannot be left undone, yet when viewed through the eye of the Dao, though one acts, no effort is forced. Thus it is said: \"Observes Heaven yet does not assist\"—this *zhu* (助) is the same as in \"assisting growth.\" Not being burdened means not piling up to achieve height. To pile up in order to be high is to harbor intention, which is not spontaneous—*lei* (累) is pronounced like *lei* (垒). Not scheming means having no calculating mind. Not relying means not considering it a personal favor. *Hui* (会) means gathering; *ji* (积) means accumulation that does not transform. Without accumulation, there is transformation. *Bo* (薄) means pressing, near. Though one’s conduct may be near to righteousness, one does not consider it one’s own—if one gathers righteousness, it does not transform. Not concealing means not being constrained by taboos. *Ying* (应) means responding. Bound by ritual forms, one has things to conceal and avoid. What can be done is done, responding to affairs as they arise. Thus it is said: \"Responds to ritual yet does not conceal.\" *Rang* (让) means yielding, retreating. In engaging with affairs, one acts directly without retreating. Thus it is said: \"Engages with affairs yet does not yield.\" Using laws to align things, though amidst complexity, there is a sense of simplicity and directness. Thus it is said: \"Aligns with laws yet is not disordered.\" Though the people may be relied upon, one does not slight them. Though things may be employed, one does not abandon the root to pursue the branches.\n\nFrom the above lines, all has been exhausted—yet once more, the word *thing* is raised: \"Things are not worth doing, yet they cannot be left undone.\" This *thing* encompasses both the refined—where the Dao resides—and the coarse—where things reside. All affairs and all things are included within. If viewed through the mind of the Dao, none are worth doing—yet there are things that cannot be left undone, which is where the human mind resides. Observing this line, how could Master Zhuang not understand the principle that the refined and the coarse are one?\n\nIt is further said: \"One who does not understand Heaven is not pure in virtue.\" Though worldly affairs cannot be left undone, one must know the principle of spontaneity—otherwise, the virtue within oneself is not unified. \"Not penetrating the Dao\" is the same as not understanding Heaven. \"Having no path that is not obstructed\" means there is no way forward without hindrance. The earlier statement, \"not understanding Heaven, not penetrating the Dao,\" culminates here in \"not understanding the Dao\"—thus it is clear that \"not understanding Heaven\" and \"not penetrating the Dao\" are but a single idea.\n\nWhat is the Dao? There is the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humans. The Dao of Heaven is honored through non-action; the Dao of humans is burdened by action. The ruler follows the Dao of Heaven; the minister follows the Dao of humans. The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humans are far apart—this cannot go unexamined.\n\nThis dual path is most wondrous and most intimately bound to learning, yet readers often overlook it without deep inquiry. \"Honored through non-action\" is the spontaneity of Heaven’s Dao; \"burdened by action\" is the inescapable necessity of the human Dao. The former pertains to the mind of Dao; the latter, to the human mind. This single word \"burden\" nearly approaches the meaning of \"peril.\" The ruler, following Heaven’s Dao, takes the mind of Dao as master; the minister, following the human Dao, makes the human mind obey. These terms \"ruler\" and \"minister\" do not refer to courtly ranks—readers who take them as such have long been mistaken. They denote the sovereign and subject within the self. *The Equality of Things* says, \"Do they not take turns as ruler and minister?\" There is a true sovereign abiding within—this is how it should be understood.\n\nThe writings of Zhuangzi generally esteem non-action and disdain action. Having already explained that \"matters requiring action cannot be left undone,\" he now fears readers might conflate action and non-action, and so reiterates: \"The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humans are far apart—this cannot go unexamined.\" The text’s opening and closing, its restraint and amplification, its forward and backward echoes—if one grasps this, it becomes lively and fluid. Yet its language is tangled, its rhythms shifting, its transformations elusive, so that not all can fully comprehend it. Moreover, passages like \"what is distant yet cannot be abandoned\" (righteousness) and \"what is close yet cannot be left unexpanded\" (benevolence) do not align with the sagely canon, thus veering toward heterodoxy. One must not read it as one would the *Analects* or *Mencius*.\n\nFrom \"what is base yet cannot be shirked\" through to \"this cannot go unexamined,\" this is the great guiding principle of Zhuangzi’s thought, akin to the *Under Heaven* chapter. Su Dongpo believed Zhuangzi never criticized Confucius, and in *Under Heaven* he was correct. Here, however, one sees that Zhuangzi never failed to recognize the principle of unity between the refined and the coarse, the root and the branch. There is another perspective: the words of sages and worthies endure for all ages without flaw, yet among the Hundred Schools, some passages strike with piercing clarity. Consider the *Book of Changes*: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is within form is called the vessel.\" \"To transform and regulate it is called change; to extend and enact it is called penetration; to raise and apply it to the people of the world is called enterprise.\" Again: \"When it is seen, it is called an image; when it takes form, it is called a vessel; when it is fashioned and employed, it is called a method; when its utility enters and exits, and the people all use it, it is called the numinous.\" Where does it not speak of the refined? Where does it not speak of the coarse? Expressed with such seamless integrity, it remains flawless.\n\nLe Yuexuan said: \"When Confucians awaken to the Dao, their minds grow ever more refined; when Chan Buddhists awaken to the Dao, their minds grow ever coarser.\" This insight penetrates to the marrow of Confucianism and Buddhism, surpassing all that came before. In this passage, Zhuangzi calls the myriad worldly affairs \"lowly\" and \"coarse,\" yet intersperses them with \"cannot but\"—such maneuvers are even coarser, leaving no trace of the spirit of \"only the refined, only the unified, holding fast to the center.\" Only by distinguishing these coarse and refined states can one perceive Le Yuexuan’s awakening to the Dao as the work of one with great vision. Others who refute Buddhism grasp only its surface; he, having named it a \"transcendent dharma\" and condemned its doctrines of severing human relations and abandoning ethical bonds, how could they ever convince him?\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Heaven and Earth (Outer Chapters)**\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, their transformations are uniform; though the myriad things are numerous, their governance is one; though the masses of people are many, their sovereign is the lord. The lord originates in virtue and is completed by Heaven. Thus it is said: \"The ancient rulers of the world practiced non-action—this was simply the virtue of Heaven.\" That their transformations are uniform means all are of primordial qi. That their governance is one: though the myriad things are many, what governs them is singular—creation alone. Though the masses of people are many, their sovereign is the lord, just as Heaven has no second sun, nor the people a second king.\n\nWhat Heaven bestows upon me is virtue; if I can trace the origin of this virtue, it is all completed by Heaven, and human effort adds nothing. If one who would be a lord can understand this, then non-action and following spontaneity are achieved. Non-action and spontaneity are the virtue of Heaven—profound and distant. \"Profound antiquity\" means remote antiquity.\n\nViewed through the Dao, the lords of the world are rectified; viewed through the Dao, the duties of ruler and minister become clear; viewed through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-ordered; viewed through the Dao in its fullness, the responses of the myriad things are complete. Thus, that which flows through Heaven and Earth is virtue; that which moves among the myriad things is the Dao. To govern people is a matter of affairs; to possess a skill is a matter of technique. Technique is encompassed by affairs; affairs are encompassed by righteousness; righteousness is encompassed by virtue; virtue is encompassed by the Dao; the Dao is encompassed by Heaven.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, where there is qi, there is sound; where there is sound, there is name. When a name is designated as \"lord,\" the divisions of the world are settled. From the very beginning of Heaven and Earth, as soon as sound arose, this was naturally determined—hence it is said: \"Viewed through the Dao, the lords of the world are settled.\" The Dao is spontaneity. Once this division exists, the duties of ruler and minister naturally follow, establishing the hierarchy of high and low, noble and base.\n\nThus it is said: \"Viewed through the Dao, the duties of ruler and minister become clear.\" The affairs of the world cannot be managed by one person alone; many are employed according to their abilities, fulfilling their offices. What enables them is also bestowed by Heaven, for Heaven produces many people to accomplish many affairs. Hence it is said: \"Viewed through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-ordered.\"\n\nAmong the myriad things, nothing exists without its counterpart: where there is cold, there is heat; where there is female, there is male; where there is above, there is below; where there is front, there is back; where there is left, there is right. Each responds to the other, all arising spontaneously. Thus it is said: \"Viewed through the Dao in its fullness, the responses of the myriad things are complete.\" These four phrases are most wondrous, their language pure and unadulterated. Heaven can cover and give life; Earth can bear and complete—together they share this virtue. \"Flow through\" means to be one with. Among the myriad things, each has its own spontaneous principle, which operates within...\n\nWithin this, it is thus said: \"That which courses through the myriad things is the Dao.\"\n\nWhat the ruler employs to govern—such as ritual, music, punishment, and administration—are all affairs of governance. Within each affair lies its own art and vocation, each following the capacities of the individual: these are human skills. The refined is the essence of virtue and power; the coarse is the realm of affairs and skills. Yet whether refined or coarse, all emerge from spontaneity. Thus, skill is but affair, affair is but art, art is but virtue, virtue is but the Dao, and the Dao is but Heaven. \"To encompass\" means to unite two as one. The term *he* (合, \"to unite\") was mistakenly transcribed as *yin* (因, \"cause\") due to their shared pronunciation.\n\nHence it is said: \"Those who nurtured the world in ancient times desired nothing, and the world was sufficient; they acted not, and the myriad things transformed; they were profound and still, and the hundred clans were settled.\" The Record states: \"Permeated by the One, all affairs are complete; without intent, one attains and even spirits submit.\" To nurture the world is what Mencius called \"nourishing the world with goodness.\" If I desire nothing, the world naturally suffices; if I act not, the world naturally transforms; if I am still, the people naturally settle. *Yuánjìng* (渊静) means profound stillness. All affairs are but one principle, thus it is said: \"Permeated by the One, all affairs are complete.\" As for what is attained within me: if one can be without intent, not only will people submit, but even spirits will yield. The term *jì yuē* (记曰, \"the Record states\") signifies an ancient transmission. These words were handed down from high antiquity, and Zhuangzi cited them as his own proof. These five phrases are most pure; the first three closely resemble those of Laozi.\n\nThe Master said: \"The Dao is that which covers and bears the myriad things—vast and boundless, how great it is! The noble person cannot but hollow out the heart.\" To act through non-action is called Heaven; to speak through non-speaking is called virtue; to love others and benefit things is called benevolence; to harmonize differences is called greatness; to embrace diversity without boundary is called magnanimity; to possess the myriad differences is called abundance. Thus, to grasp virtue is called discipline; to perfect virtue is called establishment; to follow the Dao is called completion; to remain unshaken by external things is called wholeness. When the noble person comprehends these ten, their mind encompasses all affairs, vast and inexhaustible, flowing forth to embrace the myriad things.\n\nThe Master spoke of his teacher: *Kū xīn* (刳心) means to excise the heart of discriminating awareness. Only by removing this heart of knowledge can one enter the Dao and merge with spontaneity. To act in accordance with spontaneity is called Heaven; what is attained within oneself is self-evident, thus it is said: \"To speak through non-speaking is called virtue.\" *Wúwéi yán* (无为言) means speech that requires no utterance. Differences are also sameness, thus it is said: \"To harmonize differences is called greatness.\" *Yá yì* (崖异) refers to the traces of distinction. *Kuān* (宽) means expansive. Though things differ, I encompass them all, thus it is said: \"To possess the myriad differences is called abundance\"—that is, all things are complete within me. *Jì* (纪) means order: the virtue one grasps, whether great or small, follows its own sequence, hence it is said: \"To grasp virtue is called discipline.\" *Zhuó hū* (卓乎) signifies standing firm, as in the perfection of virtue. To follow the Dao in action is to lack nothing, thus it is called completion. *Bèi* (备) means the fullness of the Dao. *Wán* (完) means wholeness: when external things cannot disturb the mind, what is within remains intact. Thus it is said: \"To remain unshaken by external things is called wholeness.\" The ten are Heaven, virtue, benevolence, greatness, magnanimity, abundance, discipline, establishment, completion, and wholeness.\n\n*Tāo* (韬) means to conceal: to embrace all affairs without omission, all returning to the mind—this mind is vast beyond measure. Thus it is said: \"Their mind encompasses all affairs, vast and boundless.\" *Shì* (逝) means to flow: it flows like this, ever onward.\n\nThe myriad things come and go without end, yet I join with them in boundless continuity—thus it is said: \"Abundant is their engagement with the myriad things as they flow.\" Such a one conceals gold in the mountains and pearls in the abyss, finds no profit in wealth, draws no nearness to nobility or riches, takes no joy in long life nor sorrow in early death, feels no glory in success nor shame in adversity. They do not confine the world’s benefits as private gain, nor do they regard ruling all under Heaven as a personal elevation. To be elevated is to be illuminated—all things are a single treasury, and death and life share the same form.\n\nConcealing gold in the mountains and pearls in the abyss is to store wealth within all under Heaven. \"Not drawing near\" means keeping far away. They do not let longevity or early death dictate joy or sorrow, nor do they allow success or failure to determine honor or disgrace. The character *chǒu* (丑) here conveys a sense of inferiority, surpassing the notion of disgrace. The benefits of an age are shared by all—no one clings to them as personal possession, reflecting the idea that when one loses a bow, another finds it. Though they may rule all under Heaven, they do not consider themselves exalted; the yellow imperial carriage is not the intent of Yao’s heart. The clarity within their breast illuminates Heaven and Earth—this is true elevation, thus they do not regard ruling all under Heaven as exaltation. Gathering the myriad things into one principle, they call it a single treasury. Death and life are vast indeed, yet nothing alters their constancy—viewing them as one, thus it is said: \"They share the same form.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The Dao dwells in the profound, its abode still; its clarity flows pure. Without it, metal and stone cannot sound—thus metal and stone have voices, yet without striking, they do not ring. Who can determine the myriad things?\" Profound is its dwelling—stillness, the state of rest, of stability. Pure is its clarity—unmixed, unadulterated. The resonance of metal and stone is the natural work of Heaven, thus it is said: \"Without it, metal and stone cannot sound.\" To sound is to be the Dao. Yet though metal and stone have voices, without human striking, they do not ring—human striking is also the mechanism of Heaven. These two lines express a parallel principle, much like the earlier saying: \"How do we know what I call Heaven is not human, or what I call human is not Heaven?\" Thus it is said: \"Who can determine the myriad things?\" Heaven is not complete without humanity, just as humanity is not complete without Heaven—this is the same idea, though in this text it is expressed with striking originality.\n\nOne of royal virtue moves with unadorned simplicity and feels shame in being entangled by affairs. They establish the root and origin, their knowledge penetrating the divine. Thus their virtue is vast, and from their heart’s emergence, things respond. Without the Dao, form does not arise; without virtue, life is not illuminated. To preserve form, exhaust life, establish virtue, and illuminate the Dao—this is not the work of one without royal virtue. Vast and boundless, they suddenly emerge, suddenly move, and the myriad things follow—this is the one of royal virtue.\n\n\"Royal virtue\" refers to one possessing the virtue to rule all under Heaven. \"Unadorned simplicity\" means proceeding with plainness, like the saying \"to tread with simplicity.\" They act without fail yet do not claim credit, thus it is said: \"They feel shame in being entangled by affairs.\" The root is the origin of the myriad things. \"Knowledge penetrating the divine\" means sincerity like the divine. \"Response\" means things turn to them, and only then does their heart engage—thus it is said: \"From their heart’s emergence, things respond.\" *Cǎi* (采) means to be moved; *chū* (出) means to answer. All things are born of creation—all that has form shares this Dao. Yet without self-realization, this Dao remains unilluminated, meaning it is not understood. The character *shēng* (生) in the following line refers to receiving the center of Heaven and Earth to live. Preserving one’s form to exhaust the principle of life’s origin, establishing one’s virtue to illuminate the Dao’s naturalness—this is beyond the capacity of any but the sage. \"Vast and boundless\"—this speaks of their greatness.\n\nSuddenly, it emerges—this is the emergence of all things. With a sudden surge, it moves, compelled to rise by necessity. All things follow it—this is the sage acting and the myriad things beholding. Gazing into the boundless, listening to the soundless: within the boundless, one alone perceives clarity; within the soundless, one alone hears harmony. Thus, delving ever deeper, one can grasp things; refining ever more subtly, one can attain essence. Therefore, in engaging with the myriad things, one reaches utmost emptiness to fulfill their needs, roaming freely to meet their abiding nature—whether great or small, long or short, near or far.\n\nThe boundless is the realm of formlessness. To see within the formless and perceive clarity is to witness the elusive and indistinct, wherein images reside. While others deem it soundless, what I alone hear is like the harmony of the eight timbres. This is not seeing *that* but seeing *oneself*; not hearing *that* but hearing *oneself*. Delving ever deeper, entering the profound and wondrous, one can yet respond to things—able to grasp both the refined and the coarse. The spirit is formless; essence is qi. To perceive the formless is to grasp the interplay of qi above and form below. What abides within me is emptiness, yet it responds to things. Without compulsion, it attains utmost emptiness to fulfill the myriad things’ needs, emerging and roaming freely in due time, seizing their ultimate abode. One cannot speak of it as fixed—whether small or great, long or short, near or far—this is the meaning of timeliness. \"Far-reaching\" complements \"near\"; its intent is thus complete. Here, \"far-reaching\" (修远) means \"long\" (长), clearly encompassing the near as well. Otherwise, the brush would have slipped, losing restraint. Yet these scattered passages are exquisitely precise—how could others wield such a brush?\n\nThe Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water, ascended the Kunlun peaks, and gazed southward. Upon returning, he lost his dark pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Only Xiangwang obtained it. The Yellow Emperor exclaimed, \"How extraordinary! Could Xiangwang alone have found it?\"\n\nThis passage speaks of seeking the Dao: it does not lie in cleverness, nor in eloquence—just as the Buddhist sutras say, \"To seek the Great Perfect Enlightenment with a mind of thought is like burning Mount Sumeru with a firefly’s glow.\" Yet it unfolds a discourse so profound. The dark pearl is the Dao; Knowledge is awareness; Li Zhu is clarity; Chi Gou is eloquence; Xiangwang is non-mind. Neither awareness, clarity, nor eloquence can attain the Dao—only non-mind can. Such metaphors are singularly marvelous.\n\nYao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi. Yao asked Xu You, \"Could Nie Que be fit to match Heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to assess him.\" Xu You replied, \"How perilous! How precarious is the world! Nie Que’s nature is keen, wise, and quick—surpassing others. Yet he takes what he receives from man as Heaven. He scrutinizes prohibitions and transgressions but does not know the source of transgressions. Could he match Heaven? He rides upon man yet lacks Heaven; he takes his body as fundamental yet differs in form; he exalts knowledge yet races like fire; he becomes entangled in affairs; he becomes ensnared by things; he looks in all directions, and things respond; he adapts to the needs of the multitude yet lacks constancy. How could he match Heaven? Though he has clan and ancestors, he may be a father to the multitude but cannot be the father of fathers—the leader of order and chaos. He would bring the calamity of facing north and the treachery of facing south.\"\n\nPassage by passage, it grows ever more extraordinary. Could one say the Outer Chapters are coarser than the Inner? \"Matching Heaven\" is like the saying in the *Book of Documents*, \"The rites of Yin ascend to match Heaven.\"\n\nTo speak of ruling all under Heaven is to seek its attainment through precarious means. \"Precarious\" and \"perilous\" both signify danger. \"Keenness of perception, clarity of insight, and innate wisdom\" describe one’s nature; \"quick-wittedness,\" \"urgency,\" and \"keen observation and swift response\" describe one’s actions. In responding to affairs, it is by virtue of this innate quickness that one reacts with such agility—this is where one surpasses others. Cultivating human affairs to align with the principles of Heaven is called \"taking the human to accord with the Heavenly.\" To be discerning is to restrain transgressions, yet this remains a matter of holding the mind without transformation. If one understands the origins of transgression, there is no need for restraint.\n\n\"Riding upon man yet lacking Heaven\" speaks of exhausting one’s active efforts while ignorant of non-action. \"Riding\" means to act; to act upon human affairs is called \"riding upon man.\" The self is set against things, hence \"taking the body as fundamental yet differing in form.\" \"Racing like fire\" describes haste; to exalt and hasten the use of one’s knowledge is called \"exalting knowledge yet racing like fire.\" \"Entangled in affairs\" means being enslaved by trivial matters while forgetting the root, hence \"ensnared by the threads of affairs\"—this conveys the sense of fragmentation. \"Ensnared by things\" means being constrained by affairs and objects. Things come from all directions, and one looks about to respond, hence \"looking in all directions, and things respond.\" Each response is measured to its circumstance, hence \"adapting to the needs of the multitude.\" Yet to be submerged by things and lose one’s natural constancy is not true constancy in response, hence \"adapting to things yet lacking constancy.\" \"Adapting\" means being transformed by affairs and objects; \"constancy\" is unity, and \"lacking constancy\" means having no stability.\n\nA single \"that\" yet sevenfold in aspect, spanning from antiquity to the present—how could such literary skill arise? Though turning once more, it speaks of one who, while not yet matching Heaven, still possesses a venerable quality. When a clan gathers, it reveres its ancestors, hence \"there is a clan, there is an ancestor.\" These four idle words, too, are strangely apt.\n\nThe \"father of the multitude\" emerges from the common people yet may serve as their father—meaning he stands above his generation. The father of the multitude’s father stands yet higher, and the father of the multitude’s father is Heaven, which is natural. He leads and commands.\n\nThis person’s role in the world may bring order or chaos: facing north, he is a minister; facing south, a ruler. To employ him as a minister or as a ruler both entail perils, hence \"the calamity of facing north\" and \"the harm of facing south.\"\n\nYao observed Hua, and the border guard of Hua said, \"Ah! Sage! I offer a blessing to the sage: may the sage live long.\" Yao declined. \"May the sage grow wealthy.\" Yao declined. \"May the sage have many sons.\" Yao declined.\n\nThe border guard said, \"Longevity, wealth, and many sons—these are what all people desire. Why do you alone not desire them?\"\n\nYao replied, \"Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; longevity brings many humiliations. These three are not the means to cultivate virtue, so I decline.\"\n\nThe border guard said, \"At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven gives birth to the myriad people and must assign them duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear is there? If you are wealthy and distribute it among others, what affairs remain? Wealth, longevity, and many sons are what people desire, yet one who studies the Dao considers them insufficient to warrant concern.\"\n\nZhuangzi, however, inverts this reasoning, revealing his loftiness. \"Heaven gives birth to the myriad people and must assign them duties\"—this is like a child falling to earth already apportioned clothing and food, as the mountain valleys say: \"A hundred grasses grieve at spring rain.\" \"Wealthy yet distributing it among others\" means each is entrusted to others.\n\nThe sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling, moves like a bird without leaving a trace. When the world follows the Dao, he and all things flourish together; when the world lacks the Dao, he cultivates virtue and withdraws into obscurity. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs as an immortal, riding white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. The three calamities never reach him, and his body remains free from harm—what humiliation could there be?\n\n\"Dwelling like a quail\" means having no fixed abode. \"Eating like a fledgling\" refers to a young bird fed by its mother, nourished without seeking it—meaning he is without intention regarding food. \"Moving like a bird\" means flying without leaving a trace, dwelling wherever he alights without attachment. \"Flourishing with all things\" means each thing and I attain our proper lives. \"Cultivating virtue and withdrawing\" means seclusion when the world lacks the Dao. \"Weary of the world and ascending as an immortal\" conveys the meaning of liberation. \"White clouds\" and \"the Emperor’s realm\" refer to the heights of emptiness and non-being.\n\nThe three calamities are youth, maturity, and old age. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s analogy of the Ganges’ waters illustrates these three. \"The body remains free from harm\" means self-contentment.\n\nAbove, it spoke of longevity, wealth, and many sons, yet below, it reverses the order, placing longevity last and expanding on its refusal—this, too, is a pivot of the text’s artistry.\n\nThe border guard departed, and Yao followed, saying, \"I ask you...\" The border guard did not answer but only said, \"Withdraw.\" Yao still wished to ask, but the border guard would not respond, merely saying, \"Withdraw\"—as if to say, \"Leave.\" When Jieyu hastened to avoid Confucius and the old man with the staff passed by, they moved on. Master Cheng’s inability to share a boat with others stems from this same mechanism.\n\nYao governed the world, and Bocheng Zigao was established as a feudal lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bocheng Zigao resigned his lordship to till the soil. Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the wilds. Yu hastened to approach from the lower position and stood to ask: \"In the past, when Yao governed the world, you, sir, were established as a feudal lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to me, you resigned your lordship to plow. I venture to ask: what is the reason?\" Zigao said: \"In the past, when Yao governed the world, he did not reward, yet the people were encouraged; he did not rage, yet the people stood in awe. Now you reward and punish, and the people are no longer humane. Virtue has declined from this, punishments have been established from this, and the disorders of later ages have begun from this. Sir, why do you not depart? Do not hinder my work.\" He plowed on, head bowed, without looking back.\n\nThis passage further speaks of the world’s decline, one age worse than the last. Even in Yu’s time, it was already not equal to the eras of Yao and Shun. \"Do not hinder my work\" means \"Do not abandon my work\"—he had no leisure to speak with Yu, lest his plowing be neglected. The posture of plowing with head bowed is called *yiyi*. Yao did not reward or punish, yet now you reward and punish, and the people are not humane. The meaning is that rewards and punishments are not as good as having none, just as the intention behind \"There must be no litigation\" is expressed through the names of Yao, Shun, and Yu.\n\nIn the Great Beginning, there was Nonbeing; Nonbeing had no having, no name. This is the origin of the One. There was the One, yet no form. Things were thereby engendered—this is called *virtue*. Before form, there was division, yet it was so without gap—this is called *ming*. The abiding of movement gives rise to things; when things are completed, the principle of life is called *form*. When the form and body preserve the spirit, each has its proper pattern—this is called *nature*. Cultivating nature returns to virtue; when virtue reaches its utmost, it is one with the beginning. Being one, it is empty; being empty, it is vast. The harmony of beaks’ cries—this harmony unites with Heaven and Earth. Its union is seamless, like stupidity, like darkness. This is called *mysterious virtue*, one with the Great Compliance.\n\nThe Great Beginning is the origin of creation. What existed was only Nonbeing—there was not yet a character for \"having.\" If having is like Nonbeing, how could there be a name? This is the origin of the One. This \"One\" is the character for Nonbeing. Thus, it is said: \"There was the One, yet no form; things were thereby engendered\"—then there was having. All things each have their having—this is virtue. \"Before form\" refers to the time when the One arose. If there was division, yet it could not be divided further, it is said: \"yet it was so without gap.\" *Qie* means \"yet\"; the character *qie* is often followed by another. \"Without gap\" means undifferentiated; having division is distinct, yet this *ming* is the mandate of Heaven, the mandate of nature. The abiding of movement gives rise to things: the movement of primordial *qi* is ceaseless. When it gives rise to things, its movement abides there—thus it is said: \"The abiding of movement gives rise to things.\" The words \"abiding movement\" are extremely precise; do not read them carelessly. Movement is yang; abiding is stillness, stillness is yin. This sentence already contains the meaning of yang arising and yin completing. When things obtain it, they are born; once formed, the principle of life is all possessed. The movement of primordial *qi* becomes my life—this is called *form*. Observe how the character *form* is explained here—this is absent in other texts. \"When the form and body preserve the spirit, each has its proper pattern\"—this is called *nature*. This sentence is like the *Book of Songs*’ \"There are things, there are norms,\" and like the *Zuozhuan*’s \"The people receive the mean of Heaven and Earth to live, possessing the norms of movement and bearing.\" Form and body are *qi*; within *qi* is the spirit. The so-called norms are all enacted by this spirit—this is nature, which inherently contains the meanings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. If we discuss this text, the first \"virtue\" is actually \"nature,\" while this \"nature\" is the function of nature. Thus, it is said: \"Cultivating nature returns to virtue\"—cultivating this nature to restore its natural virtue. When virtue reaches its utmost, it is complete, then it is one with the beginning of things. \"Returns to virtue\" is like \"restoring propriety.\" *Zhi* means \"utmost.\" Being one with the beginning of things is emptiness; being empty is vastness. The harmony of beaks’ cries—this harmony unites with Heaven and Earth. Its union is seamless, like stupidity, like darkness. This is called *mysterious virtue*, one with the Great Compliance.\n\nBeing vast is the consequence of emptiness. Emptiness and vastness together give rise to speech that is not speech—where beaks meet in silence, silence is the absence of speech, while their cries are speech. This \"speech that is not speech\" in the three characters below marks the passage’s extraordinary touch. Yet the text then turns again, saying: \"the harmony of beaks’ cries.\" Here, the second *he* (\"harmony\") differs from the first. It means that when the cries of beaks are expressed as speech that is not speech, they unite with the natural. Through this natural harmony, they unite with Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: \"the harmony of beaks’ cries unites with Heaven and Earth.\" *Minmin* is like *mimim*—faint, as if stupid, as if dim, describing this state of harmony. This is called *mysterious virtue*, which is one with the Great Compliance. The Great Compliance is the principle of the Great Beginning, the natural order.\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan: \"There is a man who governs the Dao as if imitating others—can this be so or not? Can it be otherwise? The disputers say: ‘Separate hardness and whiteness as if suspended from the heavens.’ Can such a one be called a sage?\" Lao Dan replied: \"This is the work of clerks, bound by skill, wearied in body, and startled in mind. A hunting dog leashed for the fox grows anxious; the agile monkey, once brought from the mountains, is trapped. I tell you what you cannot hear and speak of what you cannot utter. Those with heads and feet but no heart or ears—multitudes of the formed—along with the formless and shapeless that yet endure, all lack their own movement and rest, life and death, decline and rise. This is not their true nature.\n\nThere is governance in man: forget things, forget Heaven—this is called forgetting the self. One who forgets the self is said to enter into Heaven. The idea of \"imitating others\" refers to emperors and kings sharing a common thread: using what I affirm to clarify what others cannot affirm, and what I deem so to clarify what others deem not so. Though the disputers’ words—hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference—are manifold, I can distinguish them as if suspended in the sky, making them clear and manifest. *Li* means \"to separate.\" *Xuyi* and *jixi* were explained in the previous section. *Chengsi* means being bound by others and thus filled with sorrow. *From the mountains* means captured and brought here. Earlier it said \"leashed for the *li*\"; here it says \"leashed for the fox\"—*li* is a scribal error. *What you cannot hear, what you cannot utter* refers to the nature and the Dao of Heaven, which cannot be heard. *Having heads and feet* describes people from crown to heel. *No heart, no ears* means no knowledge, no perception. *Formless and shapeless* refers to the naturally so. Those who see what is below form perceive form; those who see what is above form perceive the formless and shapeless that yet endure. This line is also strikingly phrased: *jin wu* means the world lacks such a person. *Movement and rest* refer to daily life; *decline and rise* to success and failure. In life and death, success and failure, all is naturally so. People know movement and rest, life and death, success and failure as such, but do not know *why* they are so.\n\nHan Yu’s *Preface to Sending Wen Chang* says: \"The reason rivers flow and people multiply is also a perceptive remark.\" But today, people read it carelessly. *Governing* refers to managing affairs. *Man* refers to human affairs. Governing through human affairs leaves no room for personal intent, hence it is said: \"there is governance in man.\" Not only are things forgotten, but even Heaven is forgotten—this is called forgetting the self. Forgetting the self means having no self. *Entering into Heaven* means entering into the natural, as previously called *entering into the non-human*. Earlier it said \"forgetting Heaven\"; here it says \"entering into Heaven.\" To enter is to become one with Heaven. Only by forgetting can one achieve unity.\n\nHowever, *Responding to Emperors and Kings* says: \"Never yet has one emerged from the non-human\"—one who has not yet forgotten Heaven. \"Never yet has one entered into the non-human\"—emerging above the realm of creation. This is \"entering into it.\"\n\nThe discourse of Heaven differs again from this—these are all its stirring, inspiring moments, and one must not cling to them. Clinging makes *Zhuangzi* difficult to read.\n\nJiang Lümian saw Ji Che and said: \"The Lord of Lu said to me, 'I request instruction.' I could not decline the command. Having already spoken, I know not whether it struck the mark. Allow me to present it to you. I said to the Lord of Lu: 'You must practice reverence and frugality, elevate those of impartial loyalty, and harbor no favoritism. Then what commoner would dare not be at peace?'\"\n\nJi Che laughed heartily and said: \"If this is what you advise, your words on the virtue of emperors and kings are like a mantis raising its arms in anger to block a chariot’s wheel—it will surely fail the task. Moreover, if one acts thus, one’s own position becomes perilous. The more one displays one’s platform, the more things gather, and the more followers flock to it.\"\n\nJiang Lümian, startled, said: \"I am utterly at a loss regarding your words. Nevertheless, I wish to hear the drift of your teaching.\"\n\n*(Annotations within the text: \"To present\" means to lay out. \"Elevate those of impartial loyalty\" means to promote the worthy. \"Harbor no favoritism\" means to have no partiality. \"At peace\" means settled. \"Heartily laughed\" describes his manner. The mantis raising its arms to block the chariot’s wheel signifies that small strength is insufficient for such a great task. The phrase \"anger and flight\" appears in *The Book of Songs*: 'Grass and trees grow in anger.' Zhuangzi delights in using the word 'anger.' 'One’s own position' refers to the place where one stands by one’s own doing. If one displays one’s platform to others, people will flock to it, and those who come treading in its footsteps will grow ever more numerous. 'Many things' refers to the multitude of people. The implication is that the more one’s reputation flourishes, the more the world rushes toward it, and thus one becomes increasingly burdened. 'Startled' describes his expression. Hearing these words, he was left without understanding, hence 'utterly at a loss regarding your words.' 'Drift' refers to the remnant influence, or the general sense.)*\n\nJi Che said: \"The great sage governs the world by swaying and stirring the people’s hearts, shaping them into teachings and transforming customs. He extinguishes their harmful intentions and advances their solitary resolve, as if it were their nature to act thus, and the people remain unaware of how it came to be. If this is so, how could one rank Yao and Shun’s teachings above and place oneself below? Would one not rather align with virtue and rest the heart therein?\"\n\n*(Annotations: \"Swaying and stirring\" means to shift and move. \"Harmful intentions\" refers to the mind of contrivance. \"Solitary resolve\" is the resolve of solitary attainment—the solitary vision of one who has attained clarity. Once the people are shaped into teachings and their customs transformed, all selfish intentions are extinguished, and they advance toward the Dao, as if by their inborn nature, unaware of the ruler’s transformative influence. Hence, 'unaware of how it came to be.' To regard Yao and Shun as superior and oneself as inferior is to say, 'I rank Yao and Shun’s teachings above and place myself below.' How could Yao and Shun surpass me? Yet the phrasing here is deliberately provocative. 'Mingxing' conveys the sense of bowing one’s head in submission. 'People' is synonymous with 'human.' If all can act thus, who would willingly rank Yao and Shun’s teachings above and place themselves below? Aligning with the virtue of nature, the heart finds rest. 'Rest' means to dwell in peace. 'Desires' refers to the sage’s wish for the people to be thus.)*\n\nZigong traveled south to Chu and, on his return to Jin, passed through Hanyin. There he saw an old man tending his garden plot. The man had dug a tunnel to enter the well, where he embraced a jar to draw water and irrigate the rows. He toiled strenuously, yet his achievement was meager.\n\nZigong said: \"There is a device here that can irrigate a hundred rows in a day, requiring little effort yet yielding great results. Would you not wish to use it?\"\n\nThe gardener looked up at him and said: \"How does it work?\"\n\nZigong replied: \"Carve wood into a machine, with the rear heavy and the front light. It draws water as if pulling, swift as boiling water. Its name is the well-sweep.\"\n\nThe gardener flushed with anger, laughed, and said: \"I have heard from my teacher that where there are mechanical devices, there are mechanical affairs, and where there are mechanical affairs, there is a mechanical heart. When a mechanical heart resides in the breast, unalloyed whiteness is incomplete. When unalloyed whiteness is incomplete, the spirit’s life is unsettled. When the spirit’s life is unsettled, the Dao does not bear it. I am not ignorant of this—I would be ashamed to use it.\"\n\nZigong, abashed, hung his head and made no reply.\n\nAfter a while, the gardener said: \"What are you doing?\"\n\nZigong replied: \"I am a disciple of Confucius.\"\n\nThe gardener said: \"Are you not that learned man who emulates the sages, struts about to overshadow the crowd, and sings mournful songs to sell your name throughout the world? You are about to forget your spirit and qi, cast off your bodily form, and perhaps approach [the Dao]. Yet you cannot even govern yourself—how could you have leisure to govern the world? Be on your way. Do not hinder my work.\"\n\nBetween the ridges, he dug channels to form irrigation ditches—drawing water as easily as pulling it forth, so that it surged and overflowed in abundance. These lines depict the self-satisfaction of one who relies on the well-sweep and other mechanical devices. To use such tools is to engage in mechanical affairs, and what drives their use is the mind. With a mechanical mind, unalloyed whiteness is incomplete—meaning it is not purely empty and luminous. When unalloyed whiteness is incomplete, the spirit’s life is unsettled, unable to embrace stillness or maintain unity. The Dao does not bear such a one—meaning it cannot carry the Way. In seeking learning and cultivation, one must carefully reflect on these points.\n\n*What are you doing?* is akin to the *Analects*’ *From where do you come?* *Emulating the sages* means aspiring to be like the sages. *Strutting about* describes an air of self-importance. *Singing mournful songs alone* refers to reciting one’s own praises when others do not acknowledge them—selling one’s name, seeking fame. The phrase *singing mournful songs alone* is a metaphor; it is not the same as *striking the chime-stones in Wei*. *Forget your spirit and qi* means to set aside one’s cleverness. *Cast off your bodily form* is to forget the self. If you could do this, you might still approach [the Dao]. If not, you cannot even govern yourself—how could you govern others? This is a rebuke to our sage’s teachings. *Do not hinder* means *do not delay*.\n\nZigong, humbled and crestfallen, lost his composure. He walked thirty *li* before recovering. His disciples asked: \"Who was that man earlier? Why did you, Master, change countenance and lose composure, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?\" Zigong replied: \"At first, I thought there was only one man in the world—yet I did not know there was another like him. I have heard from the Master that the Way of the sage seeks what is feasible, pursues completion, expends little effort, and achieves much. Now this man is not like that. One who holds to the Dao attains full virtue; with full virtue, the form is whole; with the whole form, the spirit is whole—this is the Way of the sage. He entrusts his life to the people, moving among them without knowing where he goes, vast and perfectly complete. He must have forgotten the mind of profit, skill, and cunning.\"\n\n*Humbled and crestfallen* describes shame and embarrassment. *Lost his composure* means being at a loss. *Not returning to oneself* means not regaining one’s usual state. *The one man in the world* refers to Confucius. *Seeks what is feasible* means acting only when it can be done. *Expending little effort and achieving much* is like the well-sweep’s efficiency. *Now this man is not like that* refers to the gardener of Hanyin. *Entrusts his life to the world* means living among people without knowing his own direction—wandering aimlessly, like one who does not know where to go. *Vast and perfectly complete* means pure, unified, and whole. *He must have forgotten the mind of profit, skill, and cunning* means this man’s heart is free of such concerns. Here, *forgotten* is the same as *lost*—meaning *without*.\n\nSuch a man does not go where his will does not lead, does not act where his heart does not incline. Though the world may praise him, he remains unmoved by what he deems right; though the world may condemn him, he remains untroubled by what he deems wrong. The world’s praise or blame neither benefits nor harms him—this is what it means to be a man of full virtue. I am but one tossed by the winds and waves of the world.\n\n*Such a man* refers to the gardener of Hanyin. He does not let praise or blame affect him. He would not even heed praise—how much less blame? What he says and does in the world is called *attaining what he deems right*; what he does not say or do is called *losing what he deems right*. *Tossed by the winds and waves* means being driven by worldly affairs without self-mastery.\n\nReturning to Lu, Zigong reported this to Confucius. Confucius said: \"He is one who temporarily practices the arts of Hundun. He grasps one aspect but not the other—cultivating his inner self but not his outward conduct. That man of clarity, simplicity, non-action, and returning to the uncarved block—embodying his nature, holding fast to his spirit, and wandering among the common world—how could you not be startled? Moreover, what do you or I know of the arts of Hundun?\"\n\n*Temporarily* means *greatly*. *Practices the arts* means *greatly cultivates*. *Hundun* refers to the primordial state of heaven and earth. *Arts* means *the Way*. *Grasps one aspect* means holding to purity and unity. *Not the other* means the mind is undivided. *Inner* refers to the original heart; *outward* refers to external things. *Clarity* allows one to enter simplicity. *Simplicity* is the uncarved block. *Non-action* is returning to the natural simplicity of the uncarved block. *Embodying his nature* means preserving his nature whole. *Holding fast to his spirit* means unity. *How could you not be startled?* means it is fitting that you were startled—you do not yet know this Way, so it is natural to be astonished.\n\nZhun Mang was traveling east to the Great Valley when he encountered Yuan Feng by the eastern sea. Yuan Feng asked: \"Where are you going?\" He replied: \"To the Great Valley.\" \"What will you do there?\" \"The Great Valley—it is a thing that...\"\n\nThe Great Valley—it is a thing that, though poured into, never fills, and though drawn from, never depletes. I shall wander there.\"\n\nYuan Feng said: \"Do you have no concern for the horizontal-eyed people? I wish to hear of sagely governance.\"\n\nZhun Mang replied: \"Sagely governance? Offices are established without failing their proper roles; the capable are promoted without failing their talents. All matters are seen in their true nature, and actions are taken as they ought to be. Words and deeds arise from oneself, and the world transforms accordingly. With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all come forth—this is called sagely governance. The Great Valley is the great sea. 'Horizontal-eyed people' is a term coined to describe the common folk. To wander in the Great Valley is to say that the world is not worth observing, and one will instead observe the sea. 'Offices are established without failing their proper roles' means each position is fitting to its task. 'The capable are promoted without failing their talents' means no talent is overlooked. 'Matters in their true nature' refers to the reality of affairs. Seeing all matters clearly, one acts according to what is fitting—thus it is said, 'All matters are seen in their true nature, and actions are taken as they ought to be.' What is done and said arises from oneself, not for others—thus the world naturally transforms. 'From oneself' means acting for oneself, not for others. 'A wave of the hand' means a gesture. With a wave or a glance, the people all respond. The *Book of Documents* says, 'Only when moved is there great response, awaiting the will.' 'A wave of the hand or a glance' conveys the idea of beckoning or bowing—this is how the sage governs the world. This refers to the ancient emperors and kings.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear of the virtuous person.\"\n\n\"The virtuous person dwells without thought, acts without concern, and harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. Within the four seas, all share in its benefits and rejoice; all are provided for and at peace. They are forlorn, like an infant who has lost its mother, or bewildered, like a traveler who has lost the Way. Yet their resources are abundant, though they know not whence they come; their food and drink are sufficient, though they know not from where. This describes the demeanor of the virtuous person—whether in stillness or motion, they hold no intent in their heart. Thus it is said, 'Dwells without thought, acts without concern.' They harbor no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness—this is what Buddhists call 'thinking neither good nor evil.' 'Shared benefits and provision' means rejoicing with others. 'Forlorn' describes their demeanor, like an infant who has lost its mother or a traveler who has lost the Way—both express their detachment from the world, though not without a sense of inevitability. Resources and sustenance come to them unbidden, for they are without intent. The virtuous person surpasses sagely governance by yet another level.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear of the spirit person.\"\n\n\"The supreme spirit rides the light, and form perishes and vanishes—this is called 'illuminating the vast' and 'fulfilling destiny to the utmost.' Emotions are fully realized, heaven and earth rejoice, and the myriad affairs dissolve. The myriad things return to their true nature—this is called 'primordial chaos.' 'Supreme spirit' speaks of their spirit soaring above. Beyond heaven and earth, even the light of sun and moon lies beneath them—thus it is said, 'rides the light.' 'Form perishes and vanishes' means that though they have a body, it seems as if they do not. 'Illuminating the vast' means great clarity. 'Fulfilling destiny' means exhausting the mandate of heaven. 'Emotions are fully realized' means fully realizing the emotions inherent in one’s nature. This 'emotion' is akin to Mencius’ 'if one follows their nature, they can do good.' Following the Dao of heaven and earth, they rejoice, and the myriad affairs no longer burden them—thus it is said, 'heaven and earth rejoice, and the myriad affairs dissolve.' 'Return to true nature' means returning to reality. When the myriad things all return to reality, they become one with the self. 'Primordial chaos' is the undifferentiated—this is the so-called 'Hun Dun.' The spirit person surpasses the virtuous person by yet another level, distinguishing those beyond the reach of even the ancient emperors and kings.\"\n\nMen Wu Hui and Chi Zhang Manji observed the armies of King Wu. Chi Zhang Manji said: \"Are they not inferior to the era of Youyu? Thus they have fallen into this calamity.\"\n\nMen Wu Hui said: \"When the world is equally governed, does Youyu govern it? Or does he govern it only after it has fallen into chaos?\"\n\nChi Zhang Manji replied: \"The world universally desires governance—why then calculate whether Youyu is the remedy for Youyu’s own ailment? A bald man seeks a wig; the sick seek a physician. A filial son prepares medicine for his compassionate father, yet his countenance remains scorched with worry. The sage feels shame at this. Manji’s words, though not entirely correct, employ striking analogies to advance his argument. In his view, the question of whether military might falls short of yielding courtesy stems from Wu Hui’s query, which further denigrates Youyu’s governance. The world yearns for order, yet when Youyu governs it, this very governance becomes a burden.\n\nWhy prescribe medicine if not bald? Why wear a wig if not hairless? Why seek a physician if not ill? To call governing the world an illness is itself the sickness. Governance through non-action incurs no illness. A filial son who prepares medicine for his father remains disquieted—how much better if the father were never ill! Thus the sage deems it shameful to harbor the intent to govern the world.\n\nThough his words are not entirely orthodox, his analogies are singular and instructive. The character *xiu* (羞) here means shame. In the age of utmost virtue, worthies are not exalted, nor abilities employed. The ruler is like a bare branch; the people, like wild deer. They are upright yet unaware of righteousness; they love one another yet unaware of benevolence; they are sincere yet unaware of loyalty; they act appropriately yet unaware of trustworthiness. The living move and employ one another, yet do not regard it as a favor. Thus their conduct leaves no trace, their affairs no residue.\n\nThe world is uniformly pure, devoid of the names of worthies or abilities. Hence it is said: worthies are not exalted, abilities are not employed. *Biaozhi* (标枝) means a withered branch—only its limbs are visible, not its leaves—an analogy for being without emotion or desire. Uprightness refers to cultivating the self; mutual love, to intimacy; sincerity, to the substance of the heart. Loyalty means following the heart; appropriateness, acting as circumstances demand. The four \"unawares\" below—unaware of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness—indicate that in that era, such names did not yet exist. *Chundong* (蠢动) refers to all living beings; *xiangshi* (相使), to mutual assistance. Not regarding it as a favor means not treating it as a kindness. Conduct leaving no trace, affairs leaving no residue—this describes an age without judgments of right or wrong, praise or blame. These all depict the era of great antiquity.\n\nA filial son does not flatter his parents; a loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord—this is the height of ministerial and filial virtue. If a parent’s words are heeded and their conduct is good, the world calls the child unfilial. If a lord’s words are heeded and their conduct is good, the world calls the minister disloyal. Yet how can this be necessarily so? What the world deems right, they deem right; what it deems good, they deem good. Yet they are not counted among those who guide and restrain others.\"\n\nYet does custom truly command greater reverence than parents, greater honor than lords? To be called a guide of others is to flush with anger; to be called a restrainer of others is to bristle with indignation—yet all one’s life one guides others, all one’s life one restrains others. Only by neither restraining nor flattering can one admonish one’s lord or father. To follow their words as right, their conduct as good, is not to admonish at all. In the eyes of lord and father, the admonisher is right and the non-admonisher wrong, yet in my dealings with the world, I follow what it deems good and affirm what it deems right—does this not reverse the world’s reverence for lord and father?\n\nThis suggests that what people today call the Dao is merely what the world universally affirms, not something attained in solitude and shared with the Creator. *Dao* means to guide and follow; *fang* means to restrain and flatter. If my so-called Dao aligns only with the world’s norms, then my actions merely guide and restrain the world. Should others apply the labels of \"guide\" or \"restrainer\" to me, I would surely resent it—yet all my life, I cannot escape guiding or restraining, for I cannot differ from the world.\n\nThe sage takes what is universally practiced as the Dao, but Zhuangzi holds that the Dao must transcend the age. Thus, he regards the ancient emperors and sages as inferior, unfolding his argument with such sweeping force that none can match it—though his words may go too far.\n\nGathering analogies, embellishing rhetoric, assembling followers: this is to begin with lofty aims yet end unable to rise above the age, so that one’s origins and outcomes, roots and branches, fail to align. Hence, they do not correspond. Donning robes and adornments, altering one’s countenance to charm the world, yet never calling oneself a guide or restrainer—such a one joins the crowd in affirming and denying, yet never admits to being one of them. What greater folly could there be?\n\n\"Gathering analogies\" means compiling the world’s metaphors to construct an argument; \"embellishing rhetoric\" means refining one’s words; \"assembling followers\" means drawing all scholars to oneself. Though one’s initial intent may surpass the age, in the end, one cannot escape the people of the time—thus, beginning and end, root and branch, do not cohere. Hence, they do not correspond. \"Donning robes and adornments, altering one’s countenance\" refers to the Confucians’ attire and ornamentation, their measured demeanor in instructing disciples, which is taken as charming the world. All this mocks the intent of our sages: what I affirm, my followers affirm; what I deny, my followers deny. Those who study under me are all common folk—if my affirmations and denials align with theirs, then I too am common. Yet though I walk among the common, I do not call myself common: this is the height of folly, utterly lacking insight.\n\nZhuangzi’s meaning is that what he alone has attained, others do not know, so he differs from them and thus speaks in such frustrated indignation. But this is not sound reasoning. To know one’s folly is not great folly; to know one’s confusion is not great confusion. The greatly confused never awaken; the greatly foolish never enlighten. If three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached—for confusion is the minority. If two are confused, the journey is labored and the goal unattained—for confusion prevails. But now, the whole world is confused; though I have a direction, how can I attain it? Is this not lamentable?\n\nGreat music does not enter the ears of village folk; they laugh uproariously at *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua*. Thus, lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the common; ultimate words do not surpass vulgar speech. Two jars and a bell may bewilder, making the path unknowable—yet now, the whole world is confused. Though I have a direction, how can it be attained? Knowing it cannot be attained, to force it is yet another confusion. Better to release it and not press forward. If I do not press, who will share my sorrow?\n\n\"Never awaken, never enlighten\" means not knowing oneself. *Qi xiang* means direction. If three walk together and two are confused, the journey is labored and the destination unreached—yet now, the whole world is confused by its doctrines. Though I alone have a direction, how can I turn the age? This \"I\" is Zhuangzi speaking of himself. *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* are names of village tunes; \"great music\" refers to ancient music, an analogy for his most profound teachings.\n\nTo speak to those whose hearts remain unaligned with the multitude is to speak in vain. *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* are but vulgar tunes—when vulgar speech prevails, the most profound words are silenced. \"Hanging one’s heels\" means sitting with feet dangling, refusing to walk; \"two who hang their heels in confusion\" refers to the earlier mention of two who are bewildered. \"Unable to reach one’s destination\" echoes the earlier \"labored journey, destination unreached.\" Scribal errors have miswritten \"hanging\" as \"jars\" and \"heels\" as \"bells,\" both unintelligible—yet comparing the preceding and following phrases, \"hanging heels\" is clearly the correct reading. Knowing it cannot be attained and yet forcing it is yet another confusion. This is a sigh of self-reproach: though I know it cannot be conveyed, I persist in trying to convey it—thus adding another layer of confusion. \"Release it\" means to let go; \"not press forward\" means not to insist on expounding. \"Share\" means to draw near. To leave it unspoken is to distance oneself from sorrow. This is self-explication.\n\nA leper gives birth in the dead of night, hastily kindling a torch to examine the child, anxious lest it resemble himself. A leper is a detestable person—here, the insertion of \"之\" mirrors the earlier \"骊姬之姬,\" a feature of the text’s style. A detestable man fears his child will resemble him, for he knows his own vileness. If even he knows himself, while the confused of the world remain self-ignorant, they are worse than the leper. Earlier, he spoke of \"great confusion, never awakened\" and \"great folly, never enlightened,\" yet here he offers two analogies without drawing a conclusion—this is but playful phrasing.\n\nA century-old tree, hewn into sacrificial goblets, adorned with blue and yellow patterns, is no different in essence from its severed trunk cast into a ditch. Though the goblet and the ditch-bound wood differ in beauty and ugliness, their loss of nature is the same. Robber Zhi and the virtuous Zeng and Shi may differ in conduct, yet their loss of nature is equal. Moreover, there are five ways to lose one’s nature: first, the five colors confuse the eyes, dulling their clarity; second, the five sounds confuse the ears, dulling their acuity; third, the five odors cloy the nose, congesting the sinuses; fourth, the five flavors clog the mouth, distorting its sense; fifth, preferences and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the nature. These five are all harms to life, yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di strut about, believing themselves to have attained something—this is not what I call attainment. If distress can be called attainment, then a turtledove or owl in a cage may also be said to have attained something.\n\nThe wood cast into the ditch is but the remnant of that carved into goblets. The same tree may become a goblet or be discarded in a ditch—though honor and disgrace differ, both are but withered wood. This is akin to the parable of Zang and Gu losing their sheep. The five colors, five sounds, five odors, and five flavors are all products of human artifice, thus they disrupt the nature. These four, along with preferences and aversions, are mentioned together to censure them. \"Congested\" means obstructed; \"sinuses\" refers to the passage from the nose to the forehead. \"Clogging the mouth\" means defiling it; \"distorting its sense\" means perverting it. Preferences and aversions are matters of right and wrong, likes and dislikes. When preferences and aversions muddle the heart, the natural nature is lost—hence, \"preferences and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the nature.\" The teachings of Yang Zhu and Mo Di are precisely those that agitate the heart with preferences and aversions, yet they claim to have attained something. If their doctrines can be called attainment, then beasts in cages may also be said to have attained something—this is a severe rebuke.\n\nFurthermore, preferences and aversions, sounds and colors, barricade the inner self; caps of skin and kingfisher feathers, sashes and tablets, long belts—these constrain the outer self. Within, the heart is hemmed in like a stockade; without, it is bound by layers of restraint. Though enmeshed in these bonds, one believes oneself to have attained something—this is like a convict with arms bound and fingers trussed, or a tiger or leopard in a sack or cage, yet still claiming attainment.\n\nPreferences and aversions manifest in speech and countenance, contending with others over right and wrong, leaving the heart obstructed—hence, \"preferences and aversions, sounds and colors, barricade the inner self.\" Caps of skin and kingfisher feathers, sashes and tablets, long belts are the attire of Confucians. Clothing and ritual forcibly constrain the self—hence, \"constrain the outer self.\" \"Sashes and tablets\" refer to holding tablets; \"long belts\" refer to the extended sash. Within, the heart is cramped and congested like a stockade; without, it is fettered by ritual and form like a convict in bonds. \"Ropes and snares\" refer to being bound; \"睆睆\" describes the gaze of one so constrained. Though one suffers as if bound, one still believes oneself to have attained something—would a convict or a caged beast also claim attainment? This is an extreme denunciation of Yang Zhu and Mo Di. \"Arms bound\" means hands tied; \"fingers trussed\" means fingers so bound they can be counted. \"Sack and cage\" are mentioned together, akin to the common saying, \"a monkey in a sack.\"\n\n**Zhuangzi Kouyi, Scroll Five**\n\n**Outer Chapters, \"The Dao of Heaven\" (Thirteenth)**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven operates without accumulation, thus all things are completed. The Dao of the Emperor operates without accumulation, thus the world submits. The Dao of the Sage operates without accumulation, thus the realm obeys. One who is enlightened by Heaven, attuned to the Sage, and permeates the six directions and four openings through the virtue of emperors and kings—his gaze is dimmed, yet nothing is not at rest.\n\nThe stillness of the sage is not stillness for stillness’ sake; it is stillness because it is good. Nothing in the myriad things suffices to disturb his heart, thus he is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects the beard and brows; its level surface serves as the standard for the great craftsman. If still water can be so luminous, how much more so the spirit? The heart of the sage is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the looking glass of the myriad things.\n\nThe Dao of the Emperor and the Dao of the Sage are difficult to distinguish. Zhuangzi’s intent is likely to regard the Emperor as the Three Sovereigns and the Sage as the Five Emperors. To \"operate without accumulation\" is simply the pure and unceasing; the phrase \"without accumulation\" makes this even clearer. The central idea here, however, lies in the word \"stillness.\" Within utmost stillness, operation without accumulation—how could this be like withered wood or dead ashes? Yet readers often fail to perceive this.\n\n\"Six directions and four openings\" means east, west, south, north, above, and below—unobstructed in all ways. \"Dimmed\" conveys the sense of obscurity. \"The stillness of the sage is not stillness for stillness’ sake; it is stillness because it is good\"—this line is most vital. It means the sage does not favor stillness as an end in itself; rather, he desires this stillness because nothing in the myriad things suffices to disturb his heart. Thus, he does not seek stillness, yet is naturally still. The analogy of water and mirror for stillness is drawn from everyday speech, yet the phrasing is exquisitely precise.\n\nNow, emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the ultimate of the Dao and virtue. Thus, emperors, kings, and sages rest in them. To rest is to be empty; to be empty is to be full. Fullness is the principle of order. To be empty is to be still; to be still is to move; to move is to attain. To be still is to be non-active; in non-activity, those who handle affairs bear responsibility. In non-activity, one is at ease; one at ease cannot be afflicted by care, and thus enjoys long life.\n\nEmptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action—these are the root of the myriad things. Understanding this, one faces south as Yao did to be a ruler; understanding this, one faces north as Shun did to be a minister. With this, one embodies the virtue of the Son of Heaven and the Emperor on high; with this, one embodies the Way of the obscure sage and the unadorned king. With this, one retires to leisurely wander among rivers, seas, mountains, and forests; with this, one advances to govern the world, achieving great merit, illustrious fame, and the unity of all under Heaven.\n\n\"Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action\" expand the single word \"stillness\" into eight characters to make the meaning clear. \"Equilibrium\" means settled; \"ultimate\" means supreme.\n\nThis is the unchanging principle of Heaven and Earth, the ultimate attainment of the Dao and virtue. \"Rest\" means cessation—it speaks of the hearts of emperors, kings, and sages coming to rest here, just as it is said, \"resting in the highest good.\" When there is rest, there is emptiness, and only the Dao gathers in emptiness; auspiciousness comes to rest where it rests.\n\nYet below this, it further states that emptiness gives rise to fullness—fullness is the proper order of things. When the spirit is empty, it becomes full, just as the Chan school speaks of \"true emptiness and then the existence of reality.\" \"Proper order\" refers to principle; within the fullness of principle, there is inherent pattern—this is the radiance within the undifferentiated.\n\nThe previous line expounded \"emptiness gives rise to fullness,\" and the next line speaks of \"emptiness gives rise to stillness, stillness gives rise to movement.\" This is the mutual rooting of movement and stillness. When movement is without misstep, it is said, \"in movement, one attains.\" \"Those who take up affairs bear responsibility\"—this means each fulfills their duties and responsibilities, which is non-action that leaves nothing undone.\n\n\"Yu-yu\" describes a state of ease and joy; \"worries and troubles cannot abide\" means they do not enter into one. \"Abide\" carries the sense of sinking into; when worries and troubles cannot enter, this is the unanxious heart of the benevolent. Longevity is the reward of stillness.\n\nThese four lines develop the meaning through the sequence of \"emptiness,\" \"stillness,\" and \"non-action\"—this is the stylistic technique of *Zhuangzi*. Here, it once again raises the eight characters—\"emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action\"—and concludes with \"the root of the myriad things.\" \"Root\" means origin, speaking of this principle as emerging from the time before the existence of the myriad things.\n\nTo dwell above is to face south as a ruler; to dwell below is to remain in reclusion. \"Obscure sage and unadorned king\" refers to one who possesses the virtue of a sage but not the position. \"Retiring to leisurely wander\" describes those who roam rivers and seas; \"advancing to govern the world\" describes those who serve their time.\n\nGazing upon this single phrase, how could its intent not desire engagement with the world? How could it not regard movement and stillness as one? In stillness, one becomes a sage; in movement, a king. \"Non-action\" is revered, and \"simplicity\" is such that none in the world can rival its beauty. One who clearly comprehends the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is called the Great Root, the Great Ancestor, the one who harmonizes with Heaven. Thus, they harmonize and regulate the world, and in harmonizing with others, this is called human joy; in harmonizing with Heaven, this is called Heavenly joy.\n\nStillness makes one a sage; movement makes one a king—this is precisely the four characters \"inner sageliness, outer kingliness.\" \"Non-action\" is revered: \"revered\" means esteemed, for among the world’s ways, none is more esteemed than non-action. \"Simplicity\" means unadorned, without ornament. Though it may seem plain, none in the world surpasses its beauty, hence it is said, \"simplicity, such that none in the world can rival its beauty.\" \"Clearly comprehending\" means understanding this with perfect clarity. If one knows the virtue of Heaven and Earth, one may walk as Heaven’s companion, hence it is said, \"the one who harmonizes with Heaven.\" \"Harmony\" means union. The Great Root and Great Ancestor are praises of Nature’s virtue, akin to the meaning of \"self-rooted, self-founded.\" To harmonize and regulate the world is to unite with others, much like Yao’s words: \"You unite with Heaven; I unite with humanity.\" Having spoken of Heavenly harmony and human harmony, it further speaks of human joy and Heavenly joy, its brushwork soaring and transcendent—generally thus.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"My master! My master! Who pulverizes the myriad things yet is not cruel, who bestows blessings upon ten thousand generations yet is not benevolent, who is older than high antiquity yet is not long-lived, who covers and bears Heaven and Earth, carves and sculpts the forms of things yet is not skillful—this is called Heavenly joy.\" These several lines are identical to those in the *Great Master* chapter, yet here they are prefaced with \"Zhuangzi says,\" whereas earlier they were attributed to Xu You’s words. Clearly, each is a parable—how could they be taken as literal speech?\n\nThus it is said: One who knows Heavenly joy, in life follows the Heavenly course, and in death transforms with things. In stillness, they share virtue with yin; in movement, they flow with yang. Therefore, one who knows Heavenly joy harbors no resentment toward Heaven, no blame toward others, no entanglement with things, no reproach from spirits. Hence it is said: In movement, they are Heaven; in stillness, they are Earth. With a single mind settled, they rule the world; their spirits are unharmed, their souls unwearied. With a single mind settled, the myriad things submit. This means applying the principle of emptiness and stillness to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things—this is called Heavenly joy. Heavenly joy is the heart of the sage, by which they nurture the world.\n\n\"The Heavenly course\" means following the natural principle of Heaven. \"Transformation with things\" means changing along with the myriad things. In stillness, they are yin; in movement, they are yang, flowing together. The Confucian school speaks only of \"not resenting Heaven, not blaming others,\" but here two more phrases are added: \"no entanglement with things, no reproach from spirits,\" further heightening its vigor. When spirits manifest in others, it is called \"haunting\"; when their spirits remain unharmed, it means their essence is concealed and not exposed. \"Their souls unwearied\" means their spirit is not exhausted. \"Spirits\" and \"souls\" refer to the same essence. When the mind is settled, the spirit is naturally settled, and the myriad things naturally submit. Applying the principle of emptiness and stillness to move between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, hence it is said, \"applying to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things.\" \"Nurturing the world\" means governing the world by benevolently cultivating others.\n\nNow, the virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Dao and virtue as its master, and non-action as its constant. In non-action, they employ the world with ease; in action, they are employed by the world and find it insufficient. Thus, the ancients prized non-action. The superior practices non-action, and the inferior does likewise—this is the inferior harmonizing its virtue with the superior. When the inferior harmonizes its virtue with the superior, it does not act as a subject. The inferior practices action, and the superior does likewise—this is the superior aligning its way with the inferior. When the superior aligns its way with the inferior, it does not act as a ruler. The ruler must practice non-action to employ the world; the subject must practice action to be employed by the world—this is an unchanging principle.\n\nHeaven, Earth, the Dao, and virtue are all principles of non-action. Here, it once more contrasts non-action with action, taking non-action as the ruler’s way and action as the subject’s way. \"When the inferior harmonizes its virtue with the superior, it does not act as a subject\" means the subject should labor. \"When the superior aligns its way with the inferior, it does not act as a ruler\" means the ruler should be at ease. Employing the world is the ruler’s role; being employed by the world is the subject’s role. Here, ruler and subject form a single idea, which cannot be conflated with the *Innate Capacity* chapter’s discussion of the unity of Heavenly and human ways. If one clings rigidly to this, one cannot read *Zhuangzi* properly. For though this chapter speaks of the ruler practicing non-action and the subject practicing action, an earlier passage says, \"Understanding this, one may face north and serve as Shun’s subject,\" and further, \"Applying this to advance and govern the world, one’s achievements will be great and one’s name illustrious\"—thus, even the subject’s way may be non-action. How could this be self-contradictory? Therefore, if one reads *Zhuangzi* with such rigidity, one cannot grasp its meaning.\n\nThus, the ancient kings who ruled the world, though their wisdom encompassed Heaven and Earth, did not rely on their own plans; though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not delight in their own words; though their abilities exhausted the world, they did not act for themselves. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things flourish. Emperors and kings practice non-action, yet the world’s achievements are complete. Hence it is said: None is more divine than Heaven, none richer than Earth, none greater than emperors and kings. Thus, the virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth. This is riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the human way.\n\n\"Encompassing Heaven and Earth\" means embracing them. \"Adorning the myriad things\" speaks of their artistry. Things arise of themselves, not because Heaven produces them; things grow of themselves, not because Earth makes them grow. Hence it is said: Heaven does not produce, Earth does not grow. Emperors and kings, through non-action, complete the work of Heaven and Earth, thus harmonizing with them. \"Riding Heaven and Earth\" is like saying \"riding the six dragons to govern Heaven.\" \"Driving the myriad things\" means commanding all that moves. Here, it is merely praising the ruler’s way of non-action.\n\nThe root lies above, the branches below; the essential lies in the ruler, the detailed in the subject. The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the branch of virtue. Rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the five punishments and corporal penalties are the branch of teaching. Ritual, laws, measures, and standards, the comparison of names and forms are the detailed aspects of governance. The sounds of bells and drums, the forms of feathered banners are the branch of music. Mourning garments of varying degrees, the rituals of weeping and wailing are the branch of mourning. These five branches require the operation of the spirit and the movement of the mind’s art before they can be followed. The branches are things the ancients possessed, but they are not what should come first.\n\nFrom this point onward, it once more discusses action, for while non-action is the root, action is the branch. The essential lies in the ruler’s way of non-action.\n\nThe details lie with the ministers, for the ministers’ Way is action. The assistance of martial might and civil virtue is why it is said: \"The deployment of the three armies and the five weapons is the branch of virtue.\" The five weapons are the bow, the *shu*, the spear, the dagger-axe, and the shield. Clarifying punishments to aid teaching is why it is said: \"Rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the five punishments are the branch of teaching.\" Measures and standards are gradations; \"names and forms\" refer to the names of things. *Bi* means analogy, and \"details\" means the most minute particulars. Ritual, laws, measures, and standards, bells and drums, feathered banners—none of these are the root of ritual and music. As it is said: \"How could it be merely about jade and silk, bells and drums?\" This is the branch of mourning. \"Rather than exchange it,宁戚’s meaning in these lines is most straightforward: the operation of the spirit and the movement of the mind’s art must come first, for all arises from the inner heart and is not imposed from without. The branches are things the ancients possessed, but they are not what should come first.\" This line is especially fine—how could Zhuangzi ever have intended to entirely discard weapons, punishments, ritual, and music?\n\nThe ruler leads and the minister follows; the father leads and the son follows; the elder brother leads and the younger brother follows; the elder leads and the younger follows; the man leads and the woman follows; the husband leads and the wife follows. Precedence and subordination are the natural course of Heaven and Earth. Thus the sage takes them as a model. Heaven is noble and Earth is base—this is the position of the numinous. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons. The myriad things transform and arise, each with its own form, flourishing and declining in due measure, flowing in ceaseless change. Even Heaven and Earth, most numinous of all, have their order of precedence and subordination—how much more so the human Way? Ancestral temples honor kinship; courts honor rank; village communities honor age; affairs honor worthiness. This is the sequence of the Great Way. To speak of the Way while violating its order is not the Way; to speak of the Way while not following the Way—how can one claim to have attained it?\n\nFollowing the \"lead\" and \"follow\" above, many analogies are given, for what should come first comes first, and what should come after comes after—all is the natural principle of Heaven and Earth. Thus the sage takes them as a model. Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—these are also metaphors. \"Transform and arise\" means to come into being; as the *Book of Songs* says, \"The *wei* also arises.\" *Meng* means sprouts; *qu* means differentiation. Things are born, each with its distinct form. Changing with the seasons, first flourishing then declining—this too is an analogy for the sequence of precedence. Flourishing does not last forever, nor does decline—all has its proper order. Thus it is called \"the gradation of flourishing and decline.\" From precedence and subordination, we come to nobility and baseness, for nobility and baseness are also matters of precedence.\n\n\"In affairs, honor worthiness\" means that in assigning duties, the worthy come first. Age, rank, kinship, and worthiness are all natural principles of the world, hence they are called \"the sequence of the Great Way.\" \"How can one claim to have attained the Way?\" means that if one does not know this sequence, how can one possess the Way? Thus the ancients who illuminated the Great Way first illuminated Heaven, then the Dao and virtue; once the Dao and virtue were illuminated, then benevolence and righteousness followed; once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, then the division of duties followed; once the division of duties was illuminated, then names and forms followed; once names and forms were illuminated, then the assignment of tasks followed; once the assignment of tasks was illuminated, then investigation and reduction followed; once investigation and reduction were illuminated, then right and wrong followed; once right and wrong were illuminated, then rewards and punishments followed.\n\nOnce rewards and punishments were illuminated, the foolish and the wise were placed appropriately, the noble and the base occupied their stations, the benevolent and the worthy, the unworthy and the dissolute all followed their natures, each according to their abilities, each by their names. With this, one served superiors, nurtured inferiors, governed things, and cultivated the self. Wisdom and schemes were not employed, and all returned to their Heavenly nature. This is called the Great Peace, the ultimate of governance.\n\nThis passage speaks of the sequence of governance, which has nine levels: Heaven is the first, the Dao and virtue the second, benevolence and righteousness the third, the division of duties the fourth, names and forms the fifth, the assignment of tasks the sixth, investigation and reduction the seventh, right and wrong the eighth, and rewards and punishments the ninth. \"Division of duties\" means the guarding of offices. \"Names and forms\" refers to names. \"Assignment of tasks\" means assigning great responsibilities according to one’s office. *Yuan* means to exempt; *sheng* means to reduce. If one is not up to the task, they are exempted and their duties reduced. \"Right and wrong\" means distinguishing the good from the bad. \"Rewards and punishments\" means using the whip to mark them, or chariots and robes to make them manifest.\n\nZhuangzi speaks of the sequence of governance in this way. How could Heaven’s punishment of the guilty and Heaven’s mandate of virtue not involve rewards and punishments? Must one go through nine transformations before reaching them? Such discussions stray far from the sages. Yet to say \"first illuminate Heaven, then the Dao and virtue,\" and then list these subsequent levels—this is not abandoning the coarse to seek the refined. \"The foolish and the wise placed appropriately\" means being suited to one’s task; \"occupying their stations\" also means being in the proper position. *Xi* means to follow.\n\nWhen their true dispositions are at peace, the noble and the petty each have their proper place. This necessarily follows from their names—by adhering to names, one holds them accountable to reality. When schemes and plans go unused, they must return to Heaven. Though all affairs have their proper places, there is no room for personal intent; all simply return to spontaneity—this is the age of Great Peace.\n\nThus, the ancient texts say: \"There are forms and names.\" Forms and names existed among the ancients, but they were not what came first. Those who spoke of the Great Dao in ancient times described five transformations before forms and names could be established, and nine transformations before rewards and punishments could be discussed. To abruptly speak of forms and names is to ignore their root; to abruptly speak of rewards and punishments is to ignore their origin. To invert the Dao in speech and act contrary to it is what people manage—how can it manage people? To abruptly speak of forms, names, rewards, and punishments is to possess the tools of governance, not the Dao of governance. These may be applied to the world, but not used to embrace the world—this is what is called a debater, a one-sided person.\n\nRites, laws, measures, and degrees—along with the detailed comparisons of forms and names found in the ancients—are what the inferior use to serve the superior, not what the superior uses to nurture the inferior. The *Book* refers to ancient texts. Though forms and names appear within ancient texts, they never abandoned the root to pursue the branch. Thus, it is said: \"They are not what comes first.\" If one does not know the sequence of priority and speaks abruptly, one loses the root and origin.\n\n*Inverted* means to place things upside down; *contrary* means to go against. To act contrary to this natural Dao and invert its order is to be governed by others—this is to be used by the world, not to use the world. To regard forms, names, rewards, and punishments as the tools of governance and to take the division of duties and benevolence and righteousness as the Dao of governance—how could this be mistaken? Yet it remains a jumbled and fragmented approach, one-sided and partial.\n\nWhat the superior uses to nurture the inferior is the way of the ruler; what the inferior uses to serve the superior is the way of the minister.\n\nIn ancient times, Shun asked Yao: \"How does the Son of Heaven apply his mind?\"\nYao said: \"I do not slight the helpless, nor abandon the destitute. I grieve for the poor who suffer unto death, cherish the young, and pity women—this is how I apply my mind.\"\nShun said: \"It is fine, but not yet great.\"\nYao said: \"Then what should it be like?\"\nShun said: \"Heavenly virtue emerges in tranquility; the sun and moon shine, and the four seasons proceed. Like the constancy of day and night, the clouds move and the rain falls.\"\nYao said: \"Then I am but entangled in turmoil! You unite with Heaven, while I unite with man.\"\nNow, Heaven and Earth are what the ancients revered most, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all praised together. Thus, those who ruled the world in ancient times—what did they do? They simply followed Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Arrogance* means contempt; *suffering* evokes compassion.\n\n\"Jia\" means to praise; \"fujin\" refers to widows. Though the term \"widow\" is not explicitly paired with \"young child,\" its meaning is self-evident. \"Heavenly virtue\" is the virtue of spontaneity. \"Emerges in tranquility\" means it stands foremost among the myriad things, bringing peace to all under heaven. As the sun sets, the moon rises; as cold departs, heat arrives—thus the sun and moon shine, and the four seasons proceed. Day follows night, and night follows day, ever constant and unchanging. Clouds move and rain falls, following the seasons naturally. All these describe the meaning of \"acting without acting.\"\n\n\"Jiaojiao raorao\" means turmoil and disturbance. Yao said: \"What I have done does not measure up to you; I cannot avoid self-generated turmoil. Thus, I unite only with man, not yet with Heaven.\" The following three sentences are Yao’s sigh of self-reproach.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth\" are what the ancients revered most, for the principle of Heaven and Earth’s spontaneity has been the greatest from antiquity to the present. \"Shared praise\" means they are equally admired. Those who ruled the world did nothing but model themselves on Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe earlier passage already contrasts Yao and Shun, yet here the Yellow Emperor is included as well—there is no distinction in weight. If one clings to names and titles, the meaning becomes obstructed and impassable.\n\nConfucius once sought to deposit books in the Zhou archives. Zilu advised: \"I have heard that among the Zhou’s archivists, there is an elder named Lao Dan who has retired and resides at home. If you wish to store these books, Master, you might visit him.\" Confucius said: \"Very well.\" He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan refused. Thereupon, Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him. Lao Dan countered, saying: \"This is too reckless. I would hear only the essentials.\" Confucius replied: \"The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness.\" Lao Dan asked: \"Are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?\" Confucius said: \"Indeed. The noble person who lacks benevolence cannot be perfected; without righteousness, they cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of humanity. What else could they be?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"May I ask what benevolence and righteousness are?\" Confucius replied: \"To be joyful at heart, harmonious with all things, to love universally without partiality—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness.\" Lao Dan said: \"Your words approach the mark. Yet is not universal love impractical? And is not what you call 'impartiality' itself a form of partiality?\"\n\nShould you wish the world never to lose its shepherding, then know that Heaven and Earth have their constancy, the sun and moon their brightness, the stars and constellations their ordered ranks, birds and beasts their flocks, and trees their rootedness. If you but follow virtue and walk the Way, you will have arrived at perfection—why then this restless striving? To brandish benevolence and righteousness is like beating a drum to seek a lost child. I fear you would disorder human nature.\n\nThe phrase \"to store books in the Zhou court\" means that Lao Dan traveled west to Zhou intending to examine its archives. \"Turning and returning\" describes his repeated explanation. \"Hitting the mark\" refers to Confucius’ words reaching only halfway before Lao Dan deemed them too prolix, too reckless, too diffuse. \"Harmonious with all things\" signifies delighting in things and becoming one with them. \"Later words\" refers to superficial remarks. \"Approaching the mark\" means precarious. How can universal love be applied to things that are inherently unequal? This is the impractical, convoluted doctrine. Once the name \"impartiality\" is claimed, a \"partial\" thought already lodges in the breast. The very notion of \"impartiality\" betrays intent—hence, \"impartiality is itself partiality.\"\n\n\"Shepherding\" means nurturing. If you wish the world never to lose its nurture, then within Heaven and Earth every thing possesses its natural endowment—how could force be applied? One must only rely on the spontaneous power of nature and follow the natural course of the Dao. To do so is already the utmost attainment—thus, \"you will have arrived at perfection.\" \"Lost child\" means one who has fled.\n\nStriking the drum to seek words is to toil and disturb the common customs of the world—such is the way to disorder human nature, hence the sigh and the meaning of the sigh. \"Master\" is like \"my son.\" *Jiejie* describes the appearance of laborious exertion.\n\nShi Chengqi saw Laozi and asked, \"I have heard that you, Master, are a sage. I did not hesitate to travel a great distance to come here, wishing to meet you. I have lodged a hundred nights, my calloused feet layered thick, yet dared not rest. Now, observing you, I see you are no sage. You have surplus grain and vegetables yet abandon your younger sister—this is not benevolence. You do not finish the food set before you yet hoard without limit.\" Laozi remained silent and did not respond.\n\nThe next day, Shi Chengqi saw him again and said, \"Yesterday, I reproached you, but now my heart is at ease. Why is that?\" Laozi replied, \"Those cunning in knowledge, spiritually sagacious—I believed myself free of such things. Formerly, when you called me an ox, you named me an ox; when you called me a horse, you named me a horse. If one truly possesses a reality, others may give it a name, but if one does not accept it, to accept it twice invites calamity. I submit—constantly submit. I do not submit because there is submission.\"\n\n\"A hundred lodgings, calloused feet layered thick, yet dared not rest\" describes his toil. *Juen* refers to thickened skin on the heels.\n\nThe leftover vegetables discarded in dark, obscure places—*mèi* (obscurity) shares its meaning with *mèi* (dimness)—this is not cherishing things, and thus is deemed unbenevolent. \"Not finishing the food set before you yet hoard without limit\" speaks of his surplus accumulation. *Shengshu* refers to raw and cooked foods placed before one, yet he does not use them fully, still endlessly gathering and storing—hence \"hoarding without limit.\" Laozi remained silent and did not respond, thus refusing to answer.\n\n*Cì* means to reproach; *qì* means to retreat. Formerly, there was reproach, but now his heart has fully receded, leaving nothing—after the meeting, he suddenly awakened. *Qiǎo zhī shén shèng* refers to the learning of deliberate action. *Tuō* means to depart, to rise above. I am without intent—whether you call me ox or horse, I merely listen. \"If one truly possesses a reality, others may give it a name, but if one does not accept it, to accept it twice invites calamity\"—this line is most pure. If I truly had such a matter and rejected another’s reproach, it would be a double transgression: first the fault, then the denial. *Fú* means to submit, to act. My conduct is constantly thus—not because I deem it right to act so, but because I do not know otherwise. Thus, \"I submit—constantly submit. I do not submit because there is submission.\" That is to say, it is not stillness, yet the meaning of stillness is precisely this. The four instances of *fú* (submit) here are all masterful strokes.\n\nShi Chengqi walked in goose-step, avoiding his shadow, treading cautiously as he advanced and asked, \"How should one cultivate the self?\" Laozi replied, \"Your countenance is haughty, your eyes piercing, your forehead protruding, your mouth agape, your demeanor rigid—like a horse tethered yet straining to bolt, moving yet restrained, hair-trigger perceptive, cunningly vigilant at every defense. All this betrays a lack of trust. At the borderlands, there is one called the Thief.\" *Yànxíng bì yǐng* describes his sidling posture; *lǚxíng* means stepping cautiously, one foot after the other. *Lǚxíng suì jìn* depicts his gradual, hesitant advance. *Yárán* conveys an aloof, detached air; *chōngrán*, a piercing gaze; *kuǎnrán*, a gaping mouth; *yìrán*, an unyielding stance. A horse’s nature is to run, and though tethered, it still strains to bolt—this is the meaning of \"sitting yet galloping.\" The description is most apt. *Dòng ér chí* means to move with restraint, to act with affected composure. *Fā* refers to this.\n\nThe term *jī* refers to what is called \"its trigger like a crossbow’s mechanism\"—this describes how he governs right and wrong. *Chá ér shěn* means he favors keen discernment and meticulous scrutiny, leaving nothing concealed. *Zhī qiǎo ér dǔ yú tài* indicates that he relies on his cunning and displays arrogance outwardly. All these ten traits arise from a lack of sincerity, hence it is said, \"All this betrays a lack of trust.\" Lack of trust stems from insincerity. If one perceives the true principle, this flaw would not arise. At the borderlands, if such a person exists, he is surely labeled a thief, for his scheming heart is too heavy, failing to follow the natural way of the world—such conduct invites disaster.\n\nThe Master said: The Dao is great yet does not end in the vast, small yet does not omit the minute; thus, the myriad things are complete within it. Vast indeed, it contains all; profound indeed, it cannot be fathomed. Manifest virtue, benevolence, and righteousness are but the remnants of its wondrous workings. Who but the perfected person can truly discern this? The Master—Laozi—speaks of the great as boundless, calling it \"great without end,\" and of the small as all-encompassing, calling it \"small without omission.\" Thus, it is said that nothing is too vast to bear it, nothing too minute to shatter it. No thing exists outside this Dao, hence \"the myriad things are complete.\" \"Vast indeed\" speaks of its magnitude; \"profound indeed,\" of its depth. When it takes form, it becomes virtue, benevolence, and righteousness—these are but the remnants of its marvelous workings. *Xíng* means manifestation; *shén*, the wondrous workings. *Dìng* means to discern clearly. Who but the perfected person can determine its root and branches?\n\nThe perfected person engages with the world—is this not vast? Yet it does not burden him. Though the world erects defenses, he does not join in their vigilance. He scrutinizes without pretense and does not shift for profit. He exhausts the true essence of things and guards his root, thus remaining untroubled by the external—transcending heaven and earth, forsaking the myriad things—while his spirit never encounters distress. In harmony with the Dao, aligned with virtue, he sets aside benevolence and righteousness, treats rites and music as guests. The heart of the perfected person is thus settled.\n\nTo \"engage with the world\" means to possess the world. Though the world is vast, it does not burden his heart. *Fèn fáng* refers to the defenses of power. Though the world vigorously enforces its safeguards, his heart does not follow their course—this means his heart remains unmoved. *Bù yǔ lì qiān* means he does not calculate gain or loss. *Jí wù zhī zhēn* means he exhausts the true principle of things, thus guarding his fundamental stillness. *Wài tiāndì yí wànwù* means he remains unmoved by external things. If his heart is unmoved, how can his spirit be distressed? *Tōng* means to be in accord; the Dao and virtue are natural. *Tuì rén yì* means he places benevolence and righteousness after the natural. *Bīn lǐ yuè* means that what governs is the nature and emotions, while rites and music are secondary. *Dìng* means stillness—this is why the heart of the perfected person is tranquil and settled.\n\nWhat the world values in the Dao are its texts. Yet texts are but words, and words have their worth.\n\nWhat is valued in words is their meaning. Meaning has its source, but what meaning follows cannot be transmitted through speech. Yet the world prizes the transmission of words through texts—though it values them, they are not truly worthy of esteem. For what it values is not what should be valued.\n\nThus, what can be seen are forms and colors; what can be heard are names and sounds. How lamentable that the world takes forms, colors, names, and sounds as sufficient to grasp the true nature of things! If forms, colors, names, and sounds are truly insufficient to grasp that nature, then the wise do not speak, and those who speak are not wise—how could the world recognize this?\n\nTexts can convey the Dao, which is why the world values them. Yet what is valued lies in the Dao, not in the texts themselves. Because the Dao is expressed in words, those words may be deemed worthy—but what is truly worthy is the meaning, not the words. The meaning points in a direction words cannot fully capture; thus, neither words nor texts are truly worthy of esteem. To value them in this way is to value what is not truly valuable. Hence it is said: what is valued is not what should be valued.\n\nNames are but words. Forms and colors can be seen; names and sounds can be heard. How could the Dao possess form, color, name, or sound? That the world seeks to grasp its true reality through what can be seen and heard—how lamentable! The true nature of things is their essence.\n\nDecisiveness indeed! Since what is perceived through seeing and hearing is fundamentally insufficient to grasp the Dao, those who truly know it must remain silent, while those who speak cannot truly know it. How could the understanding of people today possibly reach this insight? How lamentable!\n\nDuke Huan was reading in the hall while Wheelwright Bian carved a wheel below. Setting down his mallet and chisel, Bian ascended and asked the Duke: \"May I dare ask what words Your Lordship is reading?\"\nThe Duke replied: \"The words of the sages.\"\nBian asked: \"Are the sages still alive?\"\nThe Duke said: \"They are already dead.\"\nBian said: \"Then what Your Lordship reads is but the dregs and lees of the ancients!\"\n\nThe Duke said: \"How can a wheelwright presume to criticize what I read? If you have an explanation, speak; if not, you die!\"\nWheelwright Bian said: \"From the perspective of my craft, when I carve a wheel slowly, it is smooth but not secure; when I carve quickly, it is rough and does not fit. Neither too slow nor too fast—I grasp it in my hands and respond with my heart, yet my mouth cannot express it. There is a knack to it that resides within, which I cannot convey to my son, nor can my son receive it from me. Thus, at seventy years of age, I am still carving wheels in my old age. If the ancients, together with what could not be transmitted, have died, then what Your Lordship reads is but the dregs and lees of the ancients!\"\n\nThis extends the earlier analogy, illustrating through this example how the Dao cannot be transmitted through words. The metaphor is exquisitely precise: *sweet and smooth* refers to the ease of a loose fit, while *bitter and astringent* describes the difficulty of a tight one. *Slow* denotes a relaxed approach.\n\nSwiftness is tightness. Loose yields sweet smoothness, easy entry yet lacking firmness; tight yields astringency, difficult entry. The key lies in neither loose nor tight—there exists a measure inherent within. Yet this knack cannot be conveyed, even from father to son. What books record are but the words of the ancients; if the person is no longer present, how can one obtain what cannot be transmitted? Feeding on dregs and lees, how can one know the taste of wine?\n\nIf the Dao could be offered to others, would one not offer it to one’s lord? If it could be transmitted to others, would one not pass it to one’s son? The same principle applies. Generally, what books record and expound upon is never confined to a single matter. This text, when turned over and over, speaks only of the principle of spontaneity, yet it spins forth many words—stranger with each turn—without a second theme. Viewed thus, the incomparable depth of Zhuangzi becomes ever more apparent. The same holds for those who read Buddhist scriptures.\n\n**Outer Chapters, \"Heaven’s Motion\" (Chapter Fourteen)**\nDoes heaven move? Does earth abide? Do the sun and moon contend for their places? Who presides over this? Who maintains its order? Who, without purpose, propels it forward? Is there some mechanism that compels it, unable to rest? Or does it revolve of itself, unable to halt? Are clouds the cause of rain? Or is rain the cause of clouds? Who brings them forth? Who, without purpose, indulges in excess and urges them on? The wind rises from the north, now west, now east, swirling aloft—who exhales and inhales it? Who, without purpose, stirs and scatters it?\n\nThese lines are exquisitely precise—five instances of *hu* (乎), unmatched by any before or since. Does heaven move in a daily revolution of its own accord? Does earth, with its fourfold motion, truly abide in stillness? The sun departs, the moon arrives—yet this is called \"contending for their places,\" as though they were locked in pursuit. Who could have coined these three words—*presides*, *maintains*, *order*—with such force? *Mechanism that compels, unable to rest; revolves of itself, unable to halt*—these words suggest it acts not by its own will. Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends, giving rise to clouds and rain—but which gives rise to which? Such a question is indeed extraordinary. *Brings forth* means to rise; *stops* means to cease, akin to tension and release. Who causes it to act or cease? *Indulges in excess* means to be unrestrained; *urges* means to encourage. Who engages in wanton play and aids in the formation of clouds and rain?\n\nThe winds arise from all four directions—yet when we speak of their origin in the north, this follows the celestial form in its description. As heaven leans toward the north, winds naturally come from the north, sometimes from the west, sometimes from the east, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, drifting and wandering in their comings and goings. The text speaks of \"above\" but not \"below\"—such is the stylistic convention.\n\n*Rustling and swaying*—this describes their motion. One dares to ask: why is this so? Wu Xian of the Shao clan replied, \"Let me tell you: heaven has six poles and five constants. When emperors and kings follow them, there is order; when they oppose them, there is chaos. The affairs of the Nine Luo bring governance to completion and virtue to fulfillment, illuminating and overseeing the earth below, so that all under heaven revere them. This is what is called the Supreme Sovereign.\"\n\nThe questioner does not name a person—another shift in stylistic technique. The *six poles* are the six qi; the *five constants* are the five phases. Both the six qi and the five phases are the natural principles. The *Nine Luo* refers to the nine provinces; *Luo* means to gather, interchangeable with *luo* (to fall), as the ancient characters are mutually used. *Governance to completion and virtue to fulfillment* means that when emperors and kings follow these natural principles to govern the nine provinces, their achievements are perfected and their virtue is fulfilled. They oversee all under heaven, and the people revere them—these are the men above the Three Sovereigns. Thus it is said: this is called the Supreme Sovereign.\n\nThe Grand Steward Dang of Shang asked Zhuangzi about *ren* (benevolence). Zhuangzi said, \"Tigers and wolves possess *ren*.\" Dang asked, \"What do you mean?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Father and son show affection for one another—how is this not *ren*?\" Dang said, \"May I ask about perfect *ren*?\" Zhuangzi said, \"Perfect *ren* has no partiality.\" The Grand Steward said, \"I have heard that without partiality, there is no love; without love, there is no filial piety. Can perfect *ren* be unfilial?\" Zhuangzi said, \"Not so. Perfect *ren* is loftier still—filial piety is insufficient to describe it. This is not a matter of surpassing filial piety, but of falling short of it.\"\n\nTaking tigers and wolves as examples of *ren* aligns with the idea that even bandits have their *Dao*. These are all critiques aimed at the Confucians. Though Zhuangzi’s words may be one-sided, they still hold their own logic. The saying goes, \"Even fierce tigers do not eat their young\"—is this not the *ren* of tigers and wolves? *Perfect ren has no partiality* means that while *ren* is rooted in mutual affection, one who embodies perfect *ren* does not rely on such affection—this is the ultimate *ren*. *Filial piety is insufficient to describe it* does not mean it is unfilial, but that when one reaches perfect *ren*, filial piety need not be spoken of. Perfect *ren* stands above filial piety, surpassing it. The Grand Steward’s question, however, reflects a failure to grasp filial piety—he has not yet fully realized *ren*, and thus falls short of filial piety. One who fully embodies *ren* transcends it.\n\nOne who travels south to Ying, facing north, cannot see Mount Ming—why is this? Because it is too far away. Thus it is said: replacing reverent filial piety with loving filial piety is difficult; replacing loving filial piety with forgetting one’s parents is difficult; replacing forgetting one’s parents with making one’s parents forget oneself is difficult; replacing making one’s parents forget oneself with mutual forgetting with all under heaven is difficult; replacing mutual forgetting with all under heaven with making all under heaven forget oneself is difficult.\n\nVirtue surpasses that of Yao and Shun yet is not performed; beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet none under heaven know of it—how could one merely sigh and speak of *ren* and filial piety? Filial piety, brotherly respect, *ren*, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exhortations that labor one’s virtue, and are not worth esteeming. Thus it is said: the most noble is when state rank is discarded; the richest is when state wealth is discarded; the most desired is when fame and reputation are discarded. Only then does the Dao remain unchanging.\n\nMount Ming lies in the north. Traveling south to Ying, one cannot see the northern mountains—this is because they are too distant, not because they are insufficient. This is a simple analogy to illustrate surpassing and falling short of filial piety, and it is indeed extraordinary. *Reverent filial piety* still leaves traces; *loving filial piety* leads to mutual forgetting. From this point onward, the text speaks of forgetting one’s parents, forgetting all under heaven, and all under heaven forgetting oneself—each step is higher than the last. The stylistic technique of this text is such that having traces is inferior to having none, having intention is inferior to having none, and discarding is the ultimate aim.\n\nTo scorn Yao and Shun as unworthy of being called virtuous, to see beneficence extending to ten thousand generations as insufficient to be called *ren*—how could one boast of *ren* and filial piety? Sighing in admiration is self-praise. Filial piety, brotherly respect, *ren*, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these eight are what the world considers fine virtues, but in truth, they are merely self-exhortations that labor one’s virtue. Thus it is said: *self-exhortations that labor one’s virtue are not worth esteeming*. *Labor* means to toil; *not worth esteeming* means not worth valuing.\n\nThe utmost nobility I possess—why seek it in state ranks? The utmost wealth I possess—why seek it in state wealth? The utmost aspiration I possess—why seek it in fame and reputation? All these are cast aside, discarded in word and deed.\n\nSupreme nobility, supreme wealth, supreme aspiration—these belong to the Dao of non-action. State wealth is merely the wealth of the state. Unchanging and immutable, this is what is meant by *constant thusness*. The eight virtues are actions that labor the self, while I remain ever in non-action.\n\nBeimen Cheng asked the Yellow Emperor, saying: \"When Your Majesty performed the music of *Xianchi* in the wilds of Dongting, at first I heard it and was afraid; then I heard it again and grew weary; finally, I heard it and was perplexed. Adrift and silent, I could no longer find myself.\" This is but another fabricated tale, a peculiar account—first fear, then weariness, and finally confusion. When I heard this music, my state changed thrice: adrift, my spirit scattered; silent, my mouth sealed; ill at ease, I could not find peace, so startled was I by this music.\n\nThe Emperor said: \"Perhaps it was indeed so for you. I performed it with human artistry, harmonized it with Heaven, conducted it with ritual and righteousness, and established it in the Great Purity. The four seasons arise in succession, the myriad things follow their birth, now flourishing, now declining. Civil and martial follow their order, now clear, now turbid. Yin and Yang harmonize, their radiance flowing as sound. Hibernating creatures stir, and I startle them with thunder. In the end, it has no tail; in the beginning, it has no head. Now dying, now living, now collapsing, now rising—ever constant and inexhaustible, yet never to be awaited. Thus you were afraid.\n\nPerhaps it was indeed so for you. My music, when you heard it, should have brought these three transformations.\" *Performed* means to play; *harmonized* refers to the markers on a zither. *Conducted* and *established* mean to set in motion and elevate. *Human* refers to human affairs.\n\nThe \"Heaven\" here refers to heavenly principle; *ritual propriety and righteousness* denote the orderly progression of sound. *Great Purity* aligns with the workings of creation. The initial sound is thus balanced and upright. From \"the four seasons arise in succession\" onward, it speaks of the time of activation, when transformations stir and astonish, delighting and startling, now arising, now ceasing—yet without any sign of a final destination.\n\n*Flourishing* pertains to the civil; *withering* pertains to the martial. *Order* refers to sequence. The four seasons give life and take it, and the myriad things follow their sequence in growth, flourishing and then declining, just as music has its civil and martial order. The zither possesses civil and martial markers, which is precisely this civil-martial sequence—hence it is said, \"Civil and martial follow their order.\" *Flowing radiance* means smooth and luminous. Harmonizing the sounds of yin and yang, clear and turbid, it flows thus luminously. When hibernating creatures are about to stir and thunder resounds, one meets it without seeing its beginning, follows it without seeing its end—hence it is said, \"In the end, it has no tail; in the beginning, it has no head.\" *Head and tail* are simply *beginning and end*. *Dying and living, collapsing and rising* are ever constant and inexhaustible—this speaks of how it now acts, now ceases, both constant and ever-changing, so its constancy is boundless. Seeking its place of return to unity yet finding none, it is said, \"Yet never to be awaited.\" This is why you were afraid upon first hearing it.\n\nI then performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of sun and moon. Its sound could be short or long, soft or firm, its transformations uniform and unconfined—hence it is ever-present. Filling the valleys, filling the ravines, filling the crevices, the spirit guards it, measured by things. Its sound soars and lingers, its name lofty and luminous. Thus do ghosts and spirits guard its depths, while the sun, moon, and stars follow their courses. I halt it at the bounded, yet let it flow into the boundless. You may ponder it yet cannot know it, gaze upon it yet cannot see it, pursue it yet cannot reach it. Suddenly, it stands in the Dao of the four voids, leaning against a withered catalpa, chanting. The eye exhausts itself in what it seeks to see, strength fails in what it seeks to pursue. Since I cannot reach it, my form fills the emptiness, and I yield and drift. You, too, yield and drift—hence your negligence.\n\nThe harmony of yin and yang and the brightness of sun and moon are merely the meaning of harmonious flourishing and luminous radiance. Long and short, soft and firm, all are transformations—none can be fixed—hence it is said, \"Its transformations are uniform and unconfined.\" *Uniform* means the same. *Hence* refers to what was said before. *Unconfined* means ever-renewing.\n\nFilled to every ravine and valley—this speaks of its plenitude throughout Heaven and Earth. Obstructions and crevices block one’s hearing and clarity; *xi* (郄) is interchangeable with *xi* (隙), referring to the seven apertures. Diminish your hearing and clarity, and guard them with spirit. Follow the myriad things, measuring them—this speaks of my making of music: not employing cleverness or skill, but following nature.\n\nIts sound, resonant and expansive, arises naturally, bearing the name of loftiness. *\"Spirit guards its depths\"*—this is that very loftiness. It does not harm the soul, nor does it weary. The sun, moon, and stars move in their courses, their coming and going natural. As if halting, yet also as if without halt—hence it is said, *\"It halts at what is bounded, flows without cease.\"* To ponder yet not know, to gaze yet not see, to pursue yet not reach—all describe how it seems to be a thing yet is not a thing.\n\nThe *four voids* are the Great Void. At that moment, I stand within the Great Void, leaning against a withered catalpa, chanting. Though I long to see, it cannot be exhausted; though I long to pursue, it cannot be reached. My form, though full, forgets itself as if empty. Thus I yield and drift—how much more so for you? It is precisely this yielding and drifting that makes you negligent.\n\n*Tangran* (傥然) describes a state without intent. Again, I play music without negligence, tuning it to the command of nature. Thus it seems to mingle and surge like thickets and forests, music without form, spreading and unfurling without drag, dark and dim yet soundless, moving without direction, dwelling in profound obscurity. Some call it death, some call it life; some call it substance, some call it glory. Flowing, scattering, shifting—without fixed sound, the world doubts it. Yet the sage examines it: the sage is one who penetrates to reality and fulfills destiny.\n\nThe heavenly mechanism is not displayed, yet the five senses are all complete—this is called *heavenly music*. Though wordless, the heart delights. Thus the Lord of Yan sang its praise:\n\n*\"Hear it yet hear no sound,\nSee it yet see no form.\nFilling Heaven and Earth,\nEnveloping the six directions—\nYou long to hear it yet find no point of contact,\nAnd so remain perplexed.\"*\n\nWithout negligence, it is ceaseless.\n\nThe natural mandate is none other than the natural principle. \"Mixed and pursuing, thronging and growing\" describes the myriad things thronging and growing in mutual pursuit. \"Forest music\" speaks of a music so abundant and pervasive that all is music. Yet no form is seen; it spreads and unfurls without the need for force to drag it. Dark and dim, it cannot be heard. It moves without fixed direction, dwelling in the profound obscurity of the unfathomable and unsearchable. It is neither life nor death, neither glory nor substance. Flowing, scattering, shifting—it does not adhere to any constant sound. When the world reaches this point, it congeals in incomprehension and turns to the sage for inquiry. *Ji* means to examine. To \"penetrate to reality\" is to penetrate to the true principle; to \"fulfill destiny\" is to reach the ultimate of the natural.\n\nThe five senses are all complete, yet the heavenly mechanism does not move—this is what is meant by the ears, eyes, hands, and feet all being present, yet seeing, hearing, and movement all occurring without self-awareness. Thus one attains the joy of the natural, which is called *heavenly music*. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When the backward-flowing current returns to perfect unity, the six senses cease to function\"—this is the meaning of \"the heavenly mechanism does not move, yet the five senses are all complete.\" \"Though wordless, the heart delights\" speaks of a joy beyond words. Though you long to hear it, there is no point of contact, and so you remain perplexed.\n\nHere, another eulogy is composed—a marvelous example of textual elaboration. \"Filling Heaven and Earth, enveloping the six directions\" means it pervades all. These four lines of the eulogy contain no separate meaning; by adding a turn, they form a rhythm—this is the art of composition.\n\nAs for joy: it begins with awe. Awe gives rise to reverence; reverence leads to negligence; negligence leads to escape; escape culminates in perplexity; perplexity culminates in ignorance; and ignorance culminates in the Dao. Only then can it be carried and journeyed with. Earlier, awe, negligence, and perplexity did not reveal their meaning; it is only at the point of culmination—ignorance—that one may enter the Dao. This turn is especially ingenious, for it speaks of the stages through which one must pass in seeking the Dao before making progress. Reverence conveys solemnity; negligence leading to escape is the moment of being unable to stop; perplexity leading to ignorance is the moment when consciousness and the six senses cease to function. Observing these three stages, one sees the workings of the Chan school. Though the joy is expressed through three hypotheticals, there is no great difference—only the stirring of its words.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled west to Wei, Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin, \"What do you make of the Master’s conduct?\"\nShi Jin said, \"Alas! Your Master is in dire straits.\"\nYan Yuan said, \"How so?\"\nShi Jin said, \"Before the straw dogs are displayed, they are kept in fine baskets and covered with embroidered cloth. The invocator fasts and purifies himself to present them. But once they have been displayed, passersby trample their heads and backs, and gatherers take them to burn. If one were to gather them again, place them in fine baskets, cover them with embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath them, one would surely dream incessantly—or at the very least, suffer from blurred vision.\n\nNow your Master has taken the straw dogs of the former kings—already displayed—and with his disciples wanders and rests beneath them. Thus he was assaulted by the felling of trees in Song, had his traces erased in Wei, and was impoverished in Shang and Zhou. Is this not his dream? Besieged between Chen and Cai, he went seven days without cooking a meal, with death and life as neighbors. Is this not his blurred vision?\"\n\nThis hypothetical discussion shows that even in Confucius’ time, there were sages like the Old Man Carrying Reeds, Jieyu the Madman of Chu, and the recluses Changju and Jieni—all of this kind. Straw dogs are made of bound grass to dispel misfortune. Once used in sacrifice, they are discarded. *Qie* and *yan* are baskets.\n\nGrass is gathered for straw. *Mi* means dust entering the eyes. This is to say that what the Confucians study are all the stale words of antiquity, useless in the present age. Now, in water, nothing is better than a boat; on land, nothing is better than a cart. Because a boat can travel on water, if one seeks to push it onto land, it will never move an inch in a lifetime. Yet antiquity and the present are not like water and land, nor are Zhou and Lu like boats and carts. To insist on practicing Zhou’s ways in Lu is like pushing a boat onto land—laborious yet fruitless, and one will surely bring misfortune upon oneself. They do not understand the transmission of the boundless Way, which responds to things without exhaustion.\n\nThe analogy of rivers and land, boats and carts, speaks of the difference of times. The transmission of the boundless Way does not cling to a single path. Since antiquity, what has been transmitted is precisely a Way that adapts to the times without clinging to one path, thus responding to the world without exhaustion.\n\nHave you alone not seen the well-sweep? When pulled, it bows; when released, it rises. What pulls it is not the pull of others. Thus it bows and rises without offending anyone. Bowing and rising in accord with others, with no place for personal inclination—this is the analogy of responding to things without fixed direction.\n\nTherefore, the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors do not pride themselves on uniformity but on governance. Thus, the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are like crabapples, pears, oranges, and pomelos: their flavors differ, yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Thus rites, righteousness, laws, and standards are things that change with the times. Crabapples, pears, oranges, and pomelos—all are praised by people, yet their flavors differ. This illustrates the meaning that the Three Kings had different rites and the Five Emperors different music. *Zha* is a kind of fruit resembling a pear but sour.\n\nNow, if one takes a gibbon or macaque and dresses it in the robes of the Duke of Zhou, it will surely bite, tear, and rip them off until they are completely cast aside and only then be satisfied. To observe the difference between antiquity and the present is like the difference between a gibbon or macaque and the Duke of Zhou. To force people of today to practice the rites and music of the ancients is like forcing a gibbon or macaque to wear human clothes—yet here it is not called \"human clothes\" but \"the robes of the Duke of Zhou,\" with the intent to mock the sages. The Duke of Zhou established rites, including the regulations for caps, crowns, robes, and skirts, hence \"the robes of the Duke of Zhou.\"\n\nThus, when Xishi was afflicted with heart pain and knit her brows in her village, the ugly women of her village saw it and thought it beautiful. Returning home, they too clutched their chests and knit their brows. The rich people of the village, seeing this, firmly shut their doors and would not come out. The poor people, seeing it, took their wives and children and fled. They knew that knitting brows was beautiful but did not know why knitting brows was beautiful. How pitiful! And how straitened is your Master!\n\n*Pin* means to knit the brows. For people of today to imitate the ancients is like the village women imitating Xishi’s knitting of brows. The reason knitting brows is beautiful is that there must first be a Xishi; the reason the Way is practicable is that there must first be the ancients. Yet your Master says, \"You, sir, are my Master.\" This hypothetical discussion employs six analogies in succession, each finely crafted. Nothing is more difficult than analogies. Wang Quxuan once said, \"All my life, I have wanted to create my own analogies, but every time I think of one, it turns out to have been used by someone before.\" In the *Zhuangzi*, every analogy is extraordinarily unique.\n\nConfucius, at the age of fifty-one, had still not heard the Way. He went south to Pei to see Lao Dan. Lao Dan said, \"Have you come? I have heard that you are a worthy man of the north. Have you also attained the Way?\" Confucius said, \"I have not.\" Laozi said, \"How have you sought it?\" Confucius said, \"I sought it in measures and numbers, but after five years I had not attained it.\" Laozi said, \"How else have you sought it?\" Confucius said, \"I sought it in yin and yang, but after twelve years I had still not attained it.\" Laozi said, \"Indeed! If the Way could be offered, there is no one who would not offer it to their lord. If the Way could be presented, there is no one who would not present it to their parents. If the Way could be told to others, there is no one who would not tell it to their brothers. If the Way could be given to others, there is no one who would not give it to their children and grandchildren.\"\n\n*Measures and numbers* refer to rites and music; *yin and yang* refer to the principles of the myriad things. The five and twelve years have no particular significance; they merely say that he sought it diligently for a long time without attainment. From \"If the Way could be offered\" onward, the four sentences are exquisitely phrased. This is precisely how the Way cannot be transmitted, and such language brings it forth.\n\nYet it cannot be so for no other reason than this: what is within has no master and does not abide; what is without has no standard and does not proceed. What issues from within is not received from without—thus the sage does not expound. What enters from without has no master within—thus the sage does not retain it.\n\n*What is within has no master and does not abide* means it is not self-evident or self-realized. It speaks of those who study the Way: though they may hear something from without, if within they have no master, it is not something they have attained themselves. Though they may wish to retain it, it will not stay.\n\n*What is without has no standard* means there is nothing to verify or correct. This is what the Chan school calls \"confirmation.\" If within me I have already attained something myself and verify it with a person of the Way, then I can proceed on my own. If I have no attainment, then how can I be confirmed by others? Though these two sentences distinguish between inner and outer, in truth they both emphasize self-attainment.\n\n*What issues from within is not received from without*—this speaks of teaching others. Though my words issue from within, if you cannot receive them, then the sage will not speak to you. When I spoke with Yan Hui all day, he never opposed me—he was able to receive. If you cannot receive, then the sage will not tell you.\n\nThus it is said, \"The sage does not expound.\" *What enters from without has no master within*—this speaks of receiving teaching. Though my words enter from without, if in your hearing you have no insight and within you have no master, though you hear the words, you will gain nothing. This is what the Chan school means by \"entering by the gate is not the family treasure.\" Since you have no attainment, you merely take the sage as retaining it. In truth, the sage does not retain it.\n\nDo you disciples take me as retaining it? I do not retain it. You are this—this is the meaning. These four sentences are all profoundly subtle; you must examine them carefully. The reason the Way cannot be transmitted has no other cause—its flaw lies in these four sentences alone. Therefore, it first says, \"Yet it cannot be so for no other reason than this.\"\n\nFame is a public vessel; it cannot be taken in excess. Benevolence and righteousness are the travelers’ huts of the former kings. One may stay in them for a night but cannot dwell in them for long. The perfected persons of antiquity borrowed the Way from benevolence and lodged in righteousness to wander in the realm of carefree ease, to eat in the fields of simplicity, and to stand in the gardens of non-transaction. Carefree ease is non-action; simplicity is easy nourishment; non-transaction is no expenditure.\n\nThe ancients called this \"the wandering of gathering the genuine.\" *Fame cannot be taken in excess*—this mocks the Confucians’ love of fame.\n\nThe *qulu* is a thatched hut—benevolence and righteousness cannot be dwelled in long, for wherever there are traces, one cannot remain for long. *Gou* means \"to see\"; as soon as there are sounds and traces to be seen, calamity and disaster arise from them. Hence it is said, \"The more one sees, the more one demands.\" Borrowing the Way and lodging in righteousness cannot be a long abode—this is the meaning of \"transforming when one goes too far.\"\n\n*Goujian* means \"careless and provisional,\" speaking of adapting to the times to make provision easy. *Bu dai* is like the common saying \"not losing one’s capital\"—easy to nourish, easy to suffice. \"No expenditure\" means no exertion, no cost to oneself. \"Gathering the genuine\" means gathering the truth of reality.\n\nThose who take wealth as right cannot yield emolument; those who take prominence as right cannot yield fame. Those who cling to power cannot share authority. When they grasp it, they tremble; when they relinquish it, they grieve—and in all this, they have nothing to reflect upon, gazing ceaselessly at what they cannot cease pursuing. These are the people Heaven punishes. This is precisely the meaning of the greedy man dying for wealth, the ardent man dying for fame, and the boaster dying for power. Grasping it, they fear loss and tremble; relinquishing it, they are deluded and grieve—all three are the same, having nothing to reflect upon. *Gaze* means to peer; *what they cannot cease* means being deluded and unable to return. With no clarity in their hearts, they cannot turn back to see their delusion—these are the people from whom Heaven has seized their spirit. \"The people Heaven punishes\" means Heaven afflicts them with this suffering.\n\nResentment and gratitude, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of rectification. Only those who follow great change without obstruction can wield them. Thus it is said, \"Rectification is rectification.\" If one’s heart deems it otherwise, the Gate of Heaven will not open.\n\nBetween ruler and minister, it is called *admonition*; between teacher and friend, it is called *instruction*. Where there are human relationships, there is the use of these eight instruments. Instruments are for use; using what ought to be used is called *rectification*. Only those without self-will can employ them, following great change and conforming to creation without obstruction. If I can follow creation without obstruction, then what is within me is rectified, and only then can I rectify others. If I have not yet attained the absence of self-will and deem the principle of spontaneity otherwise, then the Heaven within my breast is already darkened and blocked. Hence it is said, \"The Gate of Heaven does not open.\" The *Book of Songs* says, \"Heaven guides the people\"—this is the meaning of the Gate of Heaven.\n\nWhen Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness, Lao Dan said: \"If chaff gets in one’s eyes, the heavens and earth and the four directions shift places. If mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, one cannot sleep through the night. Now, benevolence and righteousness are so violently intrusive—they madden my heart and cause the greatest disorder. If you, sir, would let the world not lose its simplicity, you too could drift with the wind, move with virtue, and stand firm. Why then do you act so strenuously, as if beating a drum to seek a lost child?\" *Biting the skin* and *chaff in the eyes* are metaphors for partiality and heart-inversion. *Formerly* means \"night.\" The *Zuozhuan* says, \"At rest, one prepares for a night’s vigil.\" *Violently intrusive* describes the state of poison. It speaks of self-inflicted suffering. \"Maddening my heart\" means \"inverting my heart.\"\n\nThe disorder could not be greater—this speaks of self-disruption of one’s nature. To *drift with the wind* is to follow transformation. Moving in accord with transformation is thus called \"drifting with the wind and moving.\" *Standing firm* means holding fast to virtue. If the world did not lose its original simplicity, all would follow transformation, hold fast to virtue, and stand firm—what need would there be for teaching? King Jian struck the road-drum at his chamber gate—the *road-drum* refers to the drum that was set up. Summoning the people of the world to instruct them is like carrying a great drum to seek a lost child. *Jieran* describes a self-aggrandizing demeanor.\n\nNow, the swan does not bathe daily to become white, nor does the crow dye itself daily to become black. The simplicity of black and white is not sufficient to serve as a distinction; the spectacle of fame and reputation is not sufficient to broaden one’s mind. When a spring dries up, fish find themselves together on dry land, where they moisten one another with breath and wet one another with foam—yet this is not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes. The whiteness of the swan and the blackness of the crow arise naturally and of themselves, requiring neither bathing nor dyeing. These two metaphors are most apt. *Qian* means to dye black. *The simplicity of black and white* means that black and white each possess their natural qualities, neither beautiful nor ugly, and thus not worth debating. To display them to the world through fame and reputation is to invite judgments of right and wrong. Where there is praise, there is blame—this narrows the heart. This is the metaphor of black and white, right and wrong.\n\nAs for the fish, how long can their mutual moistening last? If they dwelled in rivers and lakes, they would forget one another in the water. In an age of the Perfect Dao, each follows nature, and there is no right or wrong—thus, above and below forget one another as well.\n\nWhen Confucius saw Lao Dan, he returned home and did not speak for three days. His disciples asked, \"Master, when you saw Lao Dan, what counsel did you seek?\" Confucius said, \"Only now have I beheld the dragon! The dragon coalesces to form its body and disperses to display its patterns; it rides the clouds and qi, nourishing itself on yin and yang. My mouth gaped open, yet I could not close it—what counsel could I seek from Lao Dan?\" *Counsel* means admonition. *Coalesces to form its body* describes its undifferentiated wholeness. *Disperses to display its patterns* describes its radiant manifestation. The dragon, existing between heaven and earth, is visible yet not visible—hence the metaphors of dispersion and coalescence. *Rides the clouds and qi* means it dwells above the workings of creation. *Nourishing itself on yin and yang* means it delights in the Dao of heaven and earth. *Could not close it* means his mouth gaped open without meeting, leaving no room for words.\n\nZigong said, \"Then are there indeed men who dwell like corpses yet manifest the dragon’s presence, who thunder like storms yet remain as silent as the abyss, whose movements are like those of heaven and earth? May I, Ci, also behold such a one?\" Thereupon, he went to see Lao Dan, announcing himself in Confucius’ name. Lao Dan was just then reclining in the hall and responded faintly, \"My years have advanced and departed—what would you warn me of?\"\n\nZigong said, \"The Three Kings and Five Emperors governed the world differently, yet all were bound together by fame and reputation. Why then do you alone deem them not sages?\" Lao Dan said, \"Young man, come forward. Why do you say they governed differently?\" Zigong replied, \"Yao ceded to Shun, Shun ceded to Yu, Yu exerted effort, Tang employed force, King Wen submitted to Zhou and dared not oppose him, and King Wu opposed Zhou and would not submit—thus I say they were different.\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Young man, come forward. Let me tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. The Yellow Emperor governed the world by unifying the people’s hearts. When a man’s parent died, he did not weep, yet none among the people condemned him. Yao governed the world by fostering kinship in the people’s hearts. When a man killed for his parent, none among the people condemned him. Shun governed the world by inciting competition in the people’s hearts. Pregnant women gave birth in ten months, and their children could speak at five months. Before they could even babble, they began to ask one another’s names—thus people began to die young. Yu governed the world by altering the people’s hearts. Men had hearts, and weapons had their proper use. Killing thieves was not considered killing people, but rather a matter of sowing seeds for the world. Thus, the world was greatly alarmed, and the Ru and Mo schools arose. From their beginnings, they established order, yet now—what can women say? I was announced in Confucius’ name, as a disciple of the Master paying a formal visit.\" *Reclining in the hall* means he sat in the hall with an air of arrogance, as if disdaining others. *Responded faintly* means their exchange was barely audible.\n\nThe governance of the Yellow Emperor accorded with nature. The following passage—though similar ideas appear repeatedly in earlier sections—adds several lines here that are quite extraordinary. Mourning garments were graded according to the closeness of kinship, hence the saying, \"for their parent, they killed; for the killed, they mourned.\" This suggests that in ancient times, there were no mourning rites, and only later were they instituted. In ancient times, children were born after fourteen months and did not speak until two years old. To be born in ten months and speak at five months is to be precocious. *Who* means to ask.\n\nBefore reaching the age of childhood, they could already ask others, \"Who is this?\"—this is what is meant by *early*. *Who* refers to asking about someone’s identity.\n\nThis caused the people’s hearts to change from those of ancient times. Every person has a heart, and each heart harbors its own private concerns. Warfare was considered a proper affair, and those who turned to banditry were killed without being deemed guilty—the laws and prohibitions were detailed.\n\nAt that time, people all regarded themselves as distinct lineages, each loving their own kin and cherishing their own children. Yet they still shared this world together, hence the saying, \"and so the world was.\" The beginnings of their actions had order, for in those early days of creation, the principles of human relations still endured. But now, their corruption has led to the violation of ethical norms, even taking women as wives—what more can be said? This is to say, it is intolerable.\n\nThe *Record of Rites* states, \"When the Great Dao prevails, all is shared in common,\" and this passage also carries a similar meaning, though Zhuangzi’s criticism is far more severe. Let me tell you: the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors was called \"orderly,\" yet no disorder was greater than theirs. The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns:\n- Above, it contradicted the brilliance of the sun and moon;\n- Below, it clashed with the essence of mountains and rivers;\n- In between, it disrupted the operations of the four seasons.\n\nTheir knowledge was as venomous as the sting of a scorpion or the bite of a small beast—none could preserve the true nature of their lives. And yet they still considered themselves sages. Is this not shameful? Truly, they were without shame.\n\nZigong stood uneasily, shifting from foot to foot. The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns also defied the principles of Heaven and Earth’s creation. Earlier passages often exalted the Three Sovereigns while disparaging the Five Emperors, but here, even the Three Sovereigns are rebuked. *Scorpions* are wasps with venomous tails, and *few* means rare. *Seeking* refers to small beasts, whose desires are as limited as those of foxes. This is to say, such cunning is as poisonous as these tiny creatures—mere insects and beasts—and thus they are mocked and belittled. *Shifting uneasily* describes Zigong’s restless demeanor.\n\nConfucius said to Laozi: \"I have studied the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Book of Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*—the Six Classics—for a long time, and I thought I understood their origins. Yet I have served seventy-two rulers, expounding the Dao of the former kings and clarifying the deeds of the Zhou and Shao, but not a single ruler has put them into practice. How difficult it is to persuade people! How hard it is to make the Dao clear!\"\n\nLaozi replied: \"Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler of a well-ordered age! The Six Classics are but the traces left by the former kings—how could they be the essence of those traces? What you speak of are merely traces. Traces are what the shoe leaves behind, but are traces the shoe itself?\"\n\nThe *Record of Rites* also records Laozi addressing the sage by name. When Confucius sought to study the rites under Laozi, who could have known their origins? *Hook* means to draw out. *Fortunate not to have encountered* implies that had an ancient sage been present, he would have laughed at you. Where there is a shoe, there is a trace; to grasp the trace but not the shoe is like the parable of the dregs.\n\nThe white egrets gaze at each other, their pupils unmoving, and the wind transforms them. The male insect cries on the upper wind, and the female responds on the lower wind, and the wind transforms them. They form their own pairs as male and female, for the transformations of nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be obstructed. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be done, and nothing that can be lost.\n\nConfucius did not emerge for three months before returning to say: \"I have grasped it! Crows and magpies mate, fish spawn in foam, and wasps have slender waists—all transform. If even younger brothers weep for their elder brothers, how long has it been? I, Qiu, have not transformed with others, nor have others transformed with me. How can I transform others?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Good! You have grasped it!\"\n\nThis is one of the most extraordinary passages in the text. The male and female of the white egret do not mate but produce offspring merely by gazing at each other. All things are born of the wind and qi, for the character *wind* (風) contains *insect* (虫), implying the generation of life—hence *wind-transformation*, meaning reproduction.\n\n*Crying on the upper wind and responding on the lower wind* refers to their positions above and below. The Yellow Emperor followed the lower wind, which is similar to this. Here, *wind* differs from *wind-transformation*. *Forming their own pairs* means that male and female exist naturally within all things, enabling such transformations. The transformation of the ichneumon wasp into the potter wasp is not like this, for it relies on incantations, whereas this transformation occurs through mutual gaze.\n\nNature, fate, time, and the Dao all refer to the principles of spontaneity, which cannot be violated. Crows and magpies mate, fish spawn in foam, and wasps with slender waists transform. *Transform* means to give birth.\n\nBrothers share the same mother, yet when a younger brother is born, the elder weeps—only after the elder is weaned does the younger arrive. Thus, the elder weeps because he can no longer nurse. This passage is especially marvelous. Many such instances appear in Buddhist scriptures, for they exhaust the subtleties of literary art. These are all essential to understand.\n\nThose who speak of \"transformation into humans\" refer to knowing humanity but not Heaven, unable to unite with the workings of creation. This chapter uses the principle of creation’s ceaseless generation to illustrate the Dao of spontaneity. It suggests that what Confucians study are all acts of deliberate effort, not acts of non-effort. Acts of non-effort, however, align with the workings of creation.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures speak of birth from the womb, from eggs, from transformation, and from moisture—such joy must derive from this. Their intent, however, is to make people realize that this body arises from nothingness and is the same as all things, thereby breaking the worldly mind of self-attachment and self-love. This differs from the present discussion.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Carving Intentions**\n\nCarving intentions and esteeming conduct, departing from the world and differing from common customs, uttering lofty theories and resentful critiques—these are but acts of defiance. Such are the preferences of mountain-valley scholars, those who reject the world, the withered and emaciated, those who plunge into the abyss.\n\nSpeaking of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trust, reverence, frugality, and deference—these are but cultivated virtues. Such are the preferences of scholars in peaceful times, teachers and instructors, those who wander and dwell in study.\n\nSpeaking of great achievements, establishing great names, observing ritual between ruler and subject, rectifying superior and inferior—these are but acts of governance. Such are the preferences of court officials, those who honor their lord and strengthen the state, those who achieve merit and annex territory.\n\nRetreating to marshes and wilds, dwelling in seclusion, fishing and living idly—these are but acts of non-action. Such are the preferences of rivers-and-seas scholars, recluses, those who seek leisure.\n\nBreathing deeply, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, imitating the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching—these are but means to longevity. Such are the preferences of practitioners of Daoist arts, those who nurture the body, those who, like Peng Zu, seek long life.\n\nYet if one does not carve intentions yet remains lofty, does not practice benevolence and righteousness yet is cultivated, does not establish merit and fame yet governs, does not retreat to rivers and seas yet is at leisure, does not practice Daoist arts yet lives long—then nothing is forgotten, and nothing is lacking. Serene and boundless, all virtues follow. This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.\n\n*Carving* means meticulous crafting, laboring with intent, esteeming conduct. *Defiance* means loftiness, resentment toward the world, indignation at corruption. *Rejecting the world* means criticizing worldly affairs. *Withered and emaciated* means desolate and still. *Plunging into the abyss* means seeking profound tranquility—like the saying, \"Entering the forest, one fears it is not secluded enough; entering the mountains, one fears they are not deep enough.\" *Cultivated* means refined and pure. *Teachers and instructors* are those who guide the world. *Achieving merit and annexing territory* are observations from Zhuangzi’s time. *Rivers-and-seas scholars* are recluses, those who escape the world and transcend right and wrong, differing from those who defy the world. *Bear climbing and bird stretching* refer to Hua Tuo’s \"Five Animal Exercises.\" *Nothing is forgotten, nothing is lacking* means non-action yet nothing left undone. *Boundless* means without fixed limit. *All virtues follow* means possessing all perfections. The sage embodies the spontaneous Dao of Heaven and Earth, hence this state.\n\nThus it is said: \"Serenity, tranquility, stillness, emptiness, non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue.\" Thus it is said: \"When the sage rests, he is at ease; at ease, he is serene. At ease and serene, worries and troubles cannot enter, and perverse qi cannot assail. Thus his virtue is whole, and his spirit is not diminished.\" This passage is a single continuous text; the many \"thus it is said\" below connect to it. At the end, a metaphor is used, concluding with a rustic saying—one must carefully observe the flow of his brushwork.\n\nThe essence of the Dao and virtue is their inherent nature. *At ease* and *serene* are the meaning of non-action. *Spirit not diminished* means virtue is whole—these three words reveal even greater vitality.\n\nThus it is said: \"The sage’s life is the movement of Heaven; his death is the transformation of things. At rest, he shares virtue with yin; in motion, he flows with yang. He does not precede fortune, nor initiate misfortune. He responds only after being stirred, moves only under compulsion, rises only out of necessity. He discards knowledge and old habits, follows the principle of Heaven. Thus he suffers no heavenly disasters, no burdens from things, no human reproach, no blame from spirits. His life is like floating; his death is like resting. He does not scheme or plan ahead. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not demanding. In sleep, he does not dream; awake, he is free from worry. His spirit is pure; his soul is unwearied. Emptiness, non-action, and serenity—these accord with Heavenly virtue.\"\n\n*Movement of Heaven* means following Heaven’s principle. *Transformation of things* means viewing the body like a cast-off husk. *Flowing with yang* means moving with the current. Responding only after being stirred means having no preconceived intent, thus transcending fortune and misfortune. *Compelled to move, rising out of necessity*—this is the meaning of responding without intent. *Knowledge* means private cleverness; *old habits* means past traces. Discarding private cleverness and leaving past traces means following spontaneity. *Like floating, like resting*—this is the sense of drifting without attachment. *Not scheming or planning ahead*—this is the meaning of \"What thought? What worry?\" *Radiant yet not dazzling*—this is self-effacement. *Trustworthy yet not demanding*—this means not imposing on others. His spirit is whole, hence pure; his soul is still, hence not wearied. *Wearied* is the same as *fatigued*.\n\nThus it is said: \"Sorrow and joy are deviations from virtue; delight and anger are transgressions of the Dao; likes and dislikes are losses of virtue. Thus, a heart free from sorrow and joy is the perfection of virtue; unity without change is the perfection of stillness; encountering nothing contrary is the perfection of emptiness; not engaging with things is the perfection of serenity; having no opposition is the perfection of purity. If one has sorrow and joy, delight and anger, likes and dislikes, this is not spontaneity. Worries and joys not tied to the heart—this is the perfection of virtue. *Unity without change*—this is focusing the mind without distraction. *Encountering nothing contrary*—this is following spontaneity. *Contrary* means opposition; *opposition* is slightly shallower than *contrary*, hence two phrases are used. *Purity*—this means without flaw.\"\n\nThus it is said: \"When the body labors without rest, it becomes worn; when essence is used without cease, it becomes exhausted. Exhaustion leads to depletion. Water’s nature is pure when unadulterated, clear when undisturbed. If obstructed and not flowing, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heavenly virtue. Thus it is said: *Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, serene and non-active, moving in accord with Heaven*—this is the way to nurture the spirit.\"\n\n*Body laboring* leads to wear; *essence used* leads to exhaustion—these are practical words from those who nurture life, echoing the earlier passage, \"Do not shake your essence, and you may live long.\"\n\nLabor without cease must lead to depletion—thus it is said: *labor leads to depletion.* The analogy of water, though seemingly commonplace, reveals that when obstructed and not flowing, it cannot remain clear—yet this does not reduce it to the state of withered wood or dead ashes. *Unadulterated, it is clear; undisturbed, it is level*—this is non-action. *Not flowing, it cannot remain clear*—within non-action, there is action. As Xiangyan said, \"You cannot simply call it idle sitting.\" Obstructed and not flowing—this is what Chan masters condemn as \"sitting in a ghost cave,\" the so-called silent illumination heterodoxy. Yet the movement of Heaven—does it not complete a circuit each day? Is this not the *non-action within action*? Thus it is called the image of Heavenly virtue.\n\nTo nurture the spirit is to nurture life; lifting the word *spirit* makes it more intimate—this is the learning of the Daoists. The Buddhists, however, refuse to speak of this *spirit*, as when they say, \"From beginningless time, the cycle of birth and death is the delusion of calling the original body one’s own\"—this is their way of denouncing such a notion of *spirit*. Consider the sword of Gan and Yue: it is cased and stored, never dared to be used—such is its preciousness. Yet the spirit reaches in all four directions, flowing without limit, ascending to Heaven above, coiling through Earth below, transforming and nourishing the myriad things, leaving no trace to be perceived. Its name is called *co-equal with the Emperor*. The Way of pure simplicity guards only the spirit, preserving it without loss, merging with the spirit as one. When the spirit is perfectly refined, it harmonizes with the heavenly order.\n\nTo treasure the sword is to case and store it—how much more so the spirit? This is the analogy of *using the essence leads to labor*. *Reaching in all four directions, flowing without bound, coiling below, ascending above*—such is the function of the spirit. *Transforming and nourishing the myriad things*—this, too, is the spirit. Yet no visible trace remains, hence it is said: *no image can be made of it*. *Co-equal with the Emperor* means its function is the same as the Heavenly Emperor. Those who practice the Way of pure simplicity begin by guarding only the spirit, preserving it without loss. Through long cultivation, they merge with the spirit as one—this is the time of *great transformation*. Before transformation, one remains two with the Dao; after transformation, one is one with the Dao.\n\n*The heavenly order* is the heavenly principle. When refined to the point of perfect communion, one merges with Heaven—this is what is called *the spirit, sacred and unknowable*. This chapter aligns closely with my own writings, yet by emphasizing agitation and change, it veers into heterodoxy.\n\nA rustic saying goes: \"The common people value profit, the upright value reputation, the worthy esteem aspiration, and the sage treasures essence.\" Thus, *simplicity* means having nothing mixed in; *purity* means not scattering one’s spirit. One who embodies pure simplicity is called a *Perfected Person*. The rustic saying—words from the fields, like village talk—contrasts profit, reputation, and aspiration with *essence*. *Simplicity* is undyed silk, hence *nothing mixed in*; *purity* is undivided wholeness, hence *not scattering*. Pure simplicity is the *purity and essence* of the sword of Gan. The *Perfected Person* is the *Ultimate Person*. Earlier, it spoke of the *virtue of the sage*; here, it speaks of the *Perfected Person*—just as in the Inner Chapters, where the *Ultimate Person* is without self and the *Spiritual Person* is without name. These are merely different names for the sage; it is not that the *Perfected Person* or *Ultimate Person* surpass the sage.\n\n*Carving Intent* speaks of nurturing the spirit and discusses the movement of Heaven and the transformation of things. *Mending Nature* speaks of preserving the body and involves the workings of fate and the errors of conduct. Though divided into two chapters on nurturing the spirit and preserving the body, this distinction lies in the effort of learning. Readers have not carefully investigated this, missing Zhuangzi’s profound intent across the ages.\n\n**Outer Chapters: Mending Nature, Chapter Sixteen**\n\nTo mend one’s nature through vulgar learning is to seek the return to one’s original state; to drown desires in vulgar thoughts is to seek the attainment of clarity—these are the benighted, the people of blocked perception.\n\n*Mending nature* is the cultivation of nature. *Mending nature through vulgar learning* criticizes the Confucian and Mohist discourses on nature of the time. *Original* refers to the natural principle of human nature. *Drowning* means to be submerged. *Drowning desires in the vulgar* means to be submerged in worldly desires. *Clarity* is the principle of empty brightness. To cultivate nature through vulgar learning in order to return to the original human nature, or to be drowned in desires while seeking the state of empty brightness—these are the utterly foolish, the ignorant. *People of blocked perception* is the name given to such vulgar learners. The opening of a text is most difficult; these three opening lines are truly fine writing. Su Dongpo said that reading Zhuangzi taught him the art of writing—only after treading this path does one understand.\n\nThe ancients who cultivated the Dao used tranquility to nurture knowledge, living without employing knowledge—this is called *using knowledge to nurture tranquility*. Knowledge and tranquility mutually nurture each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature. Virtue is harmony; principle is the Dao. Virtue admits all without exclusion—this is benevolence. The Dao governs all without disorder—this is righteousness. Righteousness is clarity, and things draw near—this is loyalty. The center is pure and solid, returning to emotion—this is joy. Sincerity in conduct, bearing, and compliance with pattern—this is ritual.\n\n*Tranquility* is stillness. Stillness can give rise to wisdom, hence *using tranquility to nurture knowledge*. At the beginning of my life, originally there was nothing—how could knowledge be employed? Only thus can one attain stillness, hence *using knowledge to nurture tranquility*. When the two nurture each other, one obtains the natural principle of one’s nature—this is *harmony and principle*. *Harmony and principle* means *harmonious compliance*. Through stillness, one attains the original harmonious nature, hence *harmony and principle emerge from nature*. *Nature* here is the same as *natural*. *Tranquility nurtures knowledge, knowledge nurtures tranquility*—these six words are most profound. The Buddhists say, \"Precepts give rise to concentration, concentration gives rise to wisdom,\" but they do not say *wisdom gives rise to concentration*. Such passages demand careful reading.\n\n*Virtue is harmony*—this is the Dao and principle. *Admits all without exclusion* means *loves all without exception*. *Governs all without disorder* means *each attains its proper place*. *Righteousness is clarity within*, and thus one can draw things near—this is *exhausting oneself*, called *loyalty*. *Emotion* is what is expressed. With the truth of the center’s purity expressed outwardly, and by returning to the center from what is expressed, this is *joy*—then life arises. Once life arises, how can it cease? Thus it is said: *The center is pure and solid, returning to emotion—this is joy*. *Sincerity* is trustworthiness. *Sincerity in conduct* means *trusting in one’s bearing and actions*, naturally complying with pattern—this is *ritual*. Thus it is said: *Sincerity in conduct, bearing, and compliance with pattern—this is ritual*.\n\n*Trust* is confidence. *Sincerity in conduct* means *acting with confidence*. To seek ritual and music externally without knowing their root is called *partial practice*—as if seeing only half.\n\nObscurity is concealment. When virtue accumulates within oneself yet does not reveal itself, external things naturally align—thus it is said: *\"When others are upright, one’s own virtue is concealed.\"* For when others are upright, things are upright. *\"Not imposing\"* means one does not claim to bestow virtue upon others. If virtue does not conceal itself but seeks to impose upon others, it loses its spontaneity. Thus it is said: *\"To impose is to cause things to lose their nature.\"* Governing the world through goodness is not as effective as nurturing the world through goodness—this is the meaning here.\n\nIn ancient times, people dwelled in primordial chaos, yet lived in harmony with their age in tranquil indifference. At that time, yin and yang were harmonious and still, spirits undisturbed; the four seasons kept their rhythm, all things unharmed, and living beings did not perish prematurely. Though humans possessed knowledge, they had no use for it—this was called *\"perfect unity.\"* In that era, nothing was done, yet all was naturally so. *\"Primordial chaos\"* signifies concealment, not revealing oneself; *\"tranquil indifference\"* means no seeking between above and below. The entire world was pure and whole, lacking nothing in the Dao—thus it was called *\"perfect unity.\"* *\"Nothing was done\"* means no effort was exerted. With spirits undisturbed, the numinous forces of mountains and rivers were all at peace; with the seasons keeping their rhythm, heaven and earth followed their order, and the four seasons unfolded.\n\nWhen virtue declined, Suiren and Fuxi began to act for the world—thus *\"compliance without unity.\"* When virtue declined further, Shennong and the Yellow Emperor began to act for the world—thus *\"stability without compliance.\"* When virtue declined yet again, Yao and Shun began to act for the world, initiating the currents of governance and transformation. The pure and undivided Dao dissolved, and people departed from it, using goodness to navigate peril and virtue to advance conduct. Then they abandoned their nature to follow the heart-mind. Heart-mind vied with heart-mind, discerning and knowing, yet this was insufficient to stabilize the world. Thus they appended culture, expanded knowledge, extinguished simplicity, and drowned the heart-mind in breadth. Only then did the people begin to confuse and disorder, unable to return to their nature and emotions and recover their origin.\n\nThree stages of decline—each marked by strangeness. Once they knew there was a principle to comply with, their purity and unity were already lost. Thus it is said: *\"Compliance without unity.\"* When each took principle as stability, they knew there was a self; knowing there was a self, they departed from the Dao. Thus it is said: *\"Stability without compliance.\"* To deliberately act for the world and promote teachings and transformations was no longer non-action or spontaneity—thus *\"the pure and undivided dissolved.\"* To have the name of goodness was already distant from the Dao; to have visible conduct was no longer the plain and natural virtue. Thus it is said: *\"Departing from the Dao through goodness, endangering virtue through conduct.\"* *\"Endangering\"* means not plain and natural. Abandoning natural nature to follow the heart-mind of deliberate action—thus *\"abandoning nature to follow the heart-mind.\"* When I act with a heart-mind and respond to others with a heart-mind, *\"heart-mind vied with heart-mind\"*—discerning and examining one another. All these *\"heart-mind\"* refer to the conditioned heart-mind. *\"Culture\"* means literary embellishment.\n\nThe erudite refers to the abundance of names and things; rites, music, and all affairs are complete. Yet relying on knowledge is insufficient, so one supplements it with rites and music—thus it is said: *\"Knowledge is insufficient to stabilize the world, so one appends culture and expands with erudition.\"* Erudition, vast and multifarious, lacks essentials. To apply the heart-mind to this is like drowning in the depths.\n\nFrom this perspective, the world has lost the Dao, and the Dao has lost the world—they mutually destroy one another. How can the people of the Dao arise in the world? How can the world arise in the Dao? The Dao has no means to arise in the world, nor the world in the Dao. Even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue is already concealed. Thus, *\"he does not conceal himself\"*—the Dao and the world mutually destroy one another, meaning the two do not intersect. Since they do not intersect, how can the person of the Dao revitalize the worldly perceptions of the common folk? And how can the common folk come to know the Dao? If the entire world does not know the Dao, then even if the sage stands before them, they will not recognize him. It is not that the sage conceals himself; others do not know him, and he does not seek to hide—thus he conceals himself. Therefore, it is said: *\"Thus, he does not conceal himself.\"* The reason for his concealment is not that the sage deliberately hides himself; he stands before them, yet people do not recognize him—these five characters below are also striking.\n\nThe so-called *\"concealed scholars\"* of antiquity did not crouch their bodies to remain unseen, nor did they seal their words to avoid speaking, nor did they bury their knowledge to refrain from expressing it. The great error lay in the times and fate. If the times and fate were greatly aligned with the world, one would return to unity without a trace; if the times and fate were greatly at odds with the world, one would deeply root and stabilize the utmost, awaiting—this is the way of preserving the self.\n\nFollowing the above *\"conceal\"* character, the text again raises the topic of *\"concealed scholars\"*—concealed scholars do not desire to hide their bodies, seal their words, or bury their knowledge; the times are unfavorable. The ancients who conducted themselves in the world did not adorn their knowledge with eloquence, nor did they exhaust the world with knowledge, nor did they exhaust virtue with knowledge. Serenely abiding in their place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do? The Dao is not to be practiced in small ways, nor is virtue to be known in small measures. Small knowledge harms virtue; small conduct harms the Dao. Thus, it is said: *\"Rectify oneself and that is all.\"* *\"Joyful wholeness\"* is called *\"attaining one’s will.\"*\n\nFollowing the *\"preserving the self\"* character, the text speaks of *\"conducting oneself\"*—whether in times of non-use or use. The ancients’ so-called *\"attaining one’s will\"* did not refer to carriages and caps; it meant having nothing to add to their joy. Today’s so-called *\"attaining one’s will\"* refers to carriages and caps. Carriages and caps on the body are not one’s nature and destiny; they are things that come and go by chance, lodging temporarily. When they lodge, their coming cannot be resisted, nor their going prevented. Thus, one does not indulge one’s will for carriages and caps, nor does one follow worldly customs in poverty and constraint. Their joy is the same in both cases—thus, there is no sorrow. Now, if the lodging departs and one is not joyful, from this perspective, though there is joy, it is not without dissipation. Therefore, it is said: *\"Those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to customs are called inverted people.\"*\n\nThose content within have no desires without—thus it is said: *\"Having nothing to add to their joy\"* is when *\"all things are complete within me.\"* Turning inward and being sincere, there is no greater joy. Nature and destiny are the heavenly nobility; carriages and caps are external things. They come by chance—thus it is said: *\"by chance.\"* Their coming and going lie with them, not with me—thus it is said: *\"lodging.\"* Knowing that their coming and going cannot be certain, the enlightened are neither indulgent nor constrained—thus it is said: *\"not indulging one’s will for carriages and caps, not following worldly customs in poverty and constraint.\"* *\"Following customs\"* means bending oneself to follow the times.\n\nThat is the Dao. Their joy in the Dao is the same as others’ joy in carriages and caps—thus it is said: *\"their joy is the same in both.\"* Joy lies within me, so there is no time when one can be sorrowful; joy lies in things, so when things depart, joy also departs. Since their joy has coming and going, it is not true joy. Therefore, it is said: *\"though there is joy, it is not without dissipation.\"* *\"Inverted\"* means not knowing the root and branches. The self and nature are the root; things and customs are the branches. Valuing the branches and losing the root—thus it is said: *\"inverted people.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Five\n<*Masters Section, Daoist Category, Zhuangzi Kouyi*>\n\n**Imperially Commissioned *Siku Quanshu*: *Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Six**\n*By Lin Xiangyi of the Song Dynasty*\n*Outer Chapters, \"Autumn Floods\" (Chapter Seventeen)*\n\nWhen the autumn floods came, the hundred rivers poured into the Yellow River. Its rushing currents swelled so vast that between its two banks and the islets along its shores, one could not distinguish ox from horse. Thereupon, the River Lord rejoiced exultantly, believing all the world’s beauty to be contained within himself. Following the current eastward, he arrived at the Northern Sea. Facing east and gazing out, he saw no end to the waters. Only then did the River Lord turn his face, look toward Ruo with an expression of awe, and sigh:\n\n\"There is a rustic saying: *'Hearing the Dao a hundred times, one believes none surpasses oneself.'* That describes me. Moreover, I once heard of those who belittle Confucius’s learning and make light of Boyi’s righteousness—at first, I did not believe it. Now that I behold the boundlessness of your waters, had I not come to your gate, I would have remained in peril, forever ridiculed by those of great attainment.\"\n\n*\"Jing\"* refers to turbidity. When the Yellow River’s waters surge, they churn muddy and fill the banks, hence *\"the vastness of its rushing currents.\"* Here, *\"jing\"* does not mean the Jing or Wei Rivers. *\"Zhu\"* and *\"ya\"* are islets and shores along the river, both terms of equal weight. If *\"ya\"* were glossed as *\"boundary,\"* then the phrase *\"between\"* would not allow for the indistinctness of ox and horse. *\"Not seeing the water’s end\"* means not knowing the source of the waters. *\"Yang\"* is the sea; *\"Ruo\"* is the name of the sea god.\n\nThe ways of the world are myriad, yet one hears only a hundred and takes oneself as peerless. The phrase *\"hearing the Dao a hundred times\"* likely comes from an ancient saying, its intent directed at Confucius and Boyi. Thus, the analogy of rivers and seas is used to illustrate the point.\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: *\"A frog in a well cannot be spoken to of the sea, for it is confined by its dwelling. A summer insect cannot be spoken to of ice, for it is bound by its season. A narrow scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao, for he is shackled by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your banks and shores and beheld the great sea, you know your own insignificance—only then can you be spoken to of great principles.*\n\n*The waters of the world are none greater than the sea. The ten thousand rivers flow into it, yet it never fills, though no one knows when they will cease. The Tailuo drains it, yet it never empties, though no one knows when it will end. Unchanged through spring and autumn, unaware of flood or drought—this surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers beyond measure. Yet I have never taken pride in this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive my qi from yin and yang. Within heaven and earth, I am but a pebble or a twig in a great mountain. Already aware of my own smallness, how could I take pride in myself?\"*\n\n*\"Confined by its dwelling\"* means being limited to one’s abode. *\"Bound by its season\"* means knowing only one time. The *huigui* does not know spring and autumn. *\"Knowing your own insignificance\"* means recognizing one’s shame. *\"Tailuo\"* refers to the *Wojiao*, mentioned in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*: sea water reaches this point and is instantly dried up. Comparing the sea to heaven and earth, one sees only its smallness—how could one know its vastness? This is what Chan masters mean by *\"to bear the great, one must begin from the ground; even if one rises higher, there is still heaven above.\"* This is the idea here.\n\n*\"Consider the four seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a tiny crevice in a great marsh? Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? The number of things is called 'ten thousand,' yet humans occupy but one among them. The nine provinces produce grain, and boats and carts traverse them—yet humans occupy but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, are they not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body?*\n\n*The Five Emperors’ succession, the Three Kings’ struggles, the benevolent men’s worries, the burdened scholars’ labors—all are encompassed herein. Boyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his erudition. Were their self-satisfaction not like your earlier pride in your waters?\"*\n\n*\"Leikong\"* is a small hole, like a beehive’s cell. *\"People in multitudes\"* refers to the masses. Among the ten thousand things, humans are but one kind. This is discussed in relation to the vastness of the void, where all that can be named is considered. Within the nine provinces, humans are but one species among grasses, trees, birds, and beasts. These two lines are exquisitely phrased. As Le Xuan says: *\"Though heaven and earth are vast, the human body is small—a fist-sized stone in the void makes for a splendid journey.\"* This is the idea here. The world’s smallness is thus. The knowledge and abilities of the Five Emperors, Three Kings, and the myriad sages and worthies do not exceed this. Though such words are vast and profound, they are also reasonable.\n\nBoyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his breadth. Who before has spoken thus? *\"Burdened scholars\"* refers to those who take up worldly affairs.\n\nThe River Lord said: *\"Then may I consider heaven and earth great and the tip of a hair small?\"*\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: *\"No. The measure of things is boundless, time has no end, divisions are not constant, and beginnings and ends have no fixed origin. Therefore, those of great wisdom observe both far and near, so the small is not deemed few nor the great many. Knowing the measure is boundless, they verify past and present—thus, what is distant does not vex them, nor what is near make them strain. Knowing time has no end, they discern the cycles of fullness and emptiness—thus, they do not rejoice in gain nor grieve in loss, knowing divisions are not constant. Understanding the level path, they are not delighted by life nor distressed by death, knowing beginnings and ends cannot be fixed.*\n\n*Consider: what humans know is less than what they do not know; the time of their lives is less than the time before they were born. To seek the boundless with the infinitesimal is to become lost and unable to attain mastery. From this perspective, how can one know the tip of a hair suffices to define the finest limit? How can one know heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the greatest realm?\"*\n\nThis turn of phrase is excellent. Earlier, it spoke of greatness; here, it speaks of neither small nor great—this is what is meant by *\"nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small.\"*\n\n*\"The measure of things is boundless\"* means things cannot be measured. *\"Time has no end\"* means cold and heat, day and night follow one another without cease. *\"Divisions are not constant\"* means the divisions of gain and loss, being and non-being, may come first or last without fixed order. *\"Beginnings and ends have no fixed origin\"* means there is no end, no beginning, no new, no old.\n\n*\"Therefore, those of great wisdom\"* refers to those of great understanding, who possess the four kinds of knowledge below. *\"Observing far as near\"* means not considering size as a matter of quantity, thereby knowing the measure is boundless. *\"Verifying past\"* means examining and clarifying. *\"Present\"* refers to ancient and modern. Understanding that past and present are one, they are not troubled by what is distant nor strain for what is near. Waiting, they know time has no fixed end. *\"Discerning the cycles of fullness and emptiness\"* means not rejoicing in gain nor grieving in loss, knowing divisions are not constant. *\"Understanding the level path\"* means not delighting in life nor lamenting death, knowing beginnings and ends cannot be fixed.\n\nThe full is gain, the empty is loss. Fullness and emptiness wax and wane in step with time—without delighting in this or resenting that, one then knows that divisions are not constant.\n\n*\"Understanding the level path\"*—this is to say, recognizing the *right Dao*. Following the *right Dao*, one accepts life and death as they come, neither rejoicing in longevity nor lamenting early death. Cultivating the self and awaiting what comes, the meaning is clear: thus one knows that the end is no different from the beginning, and the end cannot be taken as fixed.\n\nThis is the principle of *\"tracing beginnings to grasp ends\"*—what man knows is man; what he does not know is Heaven. For instance, after birth, I know myself; but how can I know what I was before birth? This is the Chan saying: *\"the single phrase of the Dao before father and mother were born.\"* The smallest is the self; the greatest is Heaven. For the self, so small, to seek to fathom Heaven, so great—no wonder one becomes confused and discontent. In Chan, these few words would constitute a great *gong'an*.\n\nZhuangzi treats it all as a matter of course. What follows *\"those of great wisdom\"* is an explanation of the preceding lines. The phrasing expands and contracts, long and short alternating without uniformity—this is the art of composition. The *ni* is the finest edge; the *yu* is the bounded realm. Speaking of the small, there is no limit to its fineness; speaking of the great, there is no end to its vastness. Hence the question: how can one determine the finest *ni*? How can one exhaust the greatest *yu*?\n\nThe River Earl said: \"Those who discuss the world all say that the most refined is formless, and the greatest cannot be encompassed—is this a true reflection of reality?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"From the perspective of the small, the great cannot be fully seen; from the perspective of the great, the small cannot be clearly discerned. The refined and minute is the subtlest of the small; the vast and abundant is the grandest of the great. Thus, they differ in their conditions—this is the nature of their existence.\n\nThe fine and coarse are limited to what has form. What is formless cannot be divided by numbers; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by numbers. What can be expressed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by the mind is the refined aspect. What cannot be expressed in words nor grasped by the mind does not fall into the categories of refined or coarse.\n\nThis turn of phrase is excellent: the most refined is formless—this is the finest. It does not say 'the smallest' but 'the most refined,' for these are the living points of the text. *'A true reflection of reality'* means: is this statement truly so? From the perspective of the small, the great cannot be fully seen—this is like gazing at the heavens through a tube. From the perspective of the great, the small cannot be clearly discerned—this is like the roc bird looking down at the wild horses and dust motes.\n\nThe subtlest of the small is called *jing*—speaking of the small, yet even smaller. The grandest of the great is called *fu*—speaking of the great, yet even greater. *Yin* means abundant. *Yi bian* means differing in suitability. These two phrases arise from the contrast between small and great.\n\nThe most refined and formless of the small cannot be divided by numbers—whether in hairs or wisps, it is not possible. The greatest, which cannot be encompassed, cannot be exhausted by numbers—whether in *zi* or *zhao*, it is not possible. All things, whether refined or coarse, are confined to form; thus, they can be discussed in words and inferred by the mind. But if the small and the great are both formless, then words cannot express them, and the mind cannot fathom them. Since they are formless, they cannot be spoken of in terms of refined or coarse. Hence, it is said: they do not fall into the categories of refined or coarse.\n\nTherefore, the conduct of the *great person* does not involve harming others, nor does it excessively display benevolence and kindness. Their actions are not motivated by profit, nor do they despise those who serve as gatekeepers or laborers for gain. They do not contend over wealth, nor do they excessively practice deference. In affairs, they do not rely on others, nor do they overindulge in their own strength. They do not despise the greedy and corrupt, and their conduct differs from the common. They do not excessively avoid eccentricity, and they follow the crowd without despising flatterers and sycophants.\n\nThe honors and emoluments of the world are insufficient to encourage them; punishments and shame are insufficient to humiliate them. They know that right and wrong cannot be divided, and that the fine and the great cannot be determined. It is said: the *Dao*-person does not strive; the one of utmost virtue does not attain; the great person does not exhaust the utmost of restraint and division.\n\nThough they do not harm things, neither do they take loving things as their ability. Hence, it is said: *\"does not involve harming others, nor excessively displays benevolence and kindness.\"* The gatekeeper seeks profit through lowly service—though one may say, *\"even if it were holding a whip, I would do it,\"* they do not seek profit, nor do they consider lowly service for profit as wrong. Hence, it is said: *\"their actions are not motivated by profit, nor do they despise those who serve as gatekeepers or laborers for gain.\"*\n\nThey do not contend over wealth, nor do they take deference as their ability. Hence, it is said: *\"they do not contend over wealth, nor do they excessively practice deference.\"* For if one takes deference as their ability, they approach fame.\n\nIn all affairs, they act on their own without relying on others, yet they do not exhaust their strength to sustain themselves. Hence, it is said: *\"in affairs, they do not rely on others, nor do they overindulge in their own strength.\"* To say *\"not overindulging in their own strength\"* means they do not dare to use it to the fullest.\n\nThey do not despise the greedy and corrupt—*\"you are you, I am I.\"* Hence, it is said: *\"they do not despise the greedy and corrupt; their conduct differs from the common.\"* They do not create boundaries of eccentricity for themselves. Hence, it is said: *\"they do not excessively avoid eccentricity.\"* *Pi* means remote; *pi yi* means eccentric and self-isolating.\n\n*\"Following the crowd\"* means blending in and harmonizing with the world. They do not despise flatterers and sycophants—*\"being at ease with them\"*—for they cannot be tainted by such associations. *\"Not despising\"* means not disdaining them.\n\nSuch a person, without divisions of right and wrong, merges the fine and the great—this is the *Dao*-person, the one of utmost virtue, the great person.\n\nThey do not hear of \"namelessness\"—they neither gain nor lose, neither obtain nor forfeit. *\"Restricting one’s portion\"* means guarding the utmost principle within the most restrained bounds while fulfilling one’s allotted role. *\"I have heard\"* refers to an ancient saying. *\"Restricting one’s portion\"* is simply another way of saying *\"fulfilling one’s allotment\"*—merely a change of words.\n\nThe River Lord said: *\"Beyond things, within things—where does one draw the line between noble and base? Where does one draw the line between small and great?\"* The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: *\"From the perspective of the Dao, things have no nobility or baseness. From the perspective of things themselves, each deems itself noble and others base. From the perspective of custom, nobility and baseness lie not in oneself. From the perspective of differentiation, if one magnifies what is great in a thing, then nothing in the world is not great; if one diminishes what is small in a thing, then nothing in the world is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are but a grain of millet, and that the tip of a hair is a mountain, one perceives the gradations of difference. From the perspective of function, if one affirms what a thing possesses, then nothing in the world is without it; if one negates what a thing lacks, then nothing in the world possesses it. Knowing that east and west are opposites yet indispensable to each other, one sees the boundaries of function as fixed. From the perspective of inclination, if one affirms what a thing affirms, then nothing in the world is not affirmed; if one negates what a thing negates, then nothing in the world is not negated. Knowing that Yao and Jie each followed their own nature yet opposed each other, one perceives the distinctions of inclination.*\n\nThe earlier statement—*\"not despising the lowly, not despising the greedy and corrupt\"*—shifts here to another turn, adding the pairing of *\"noble and base\"* with *\"small and great.\"* *\"Beyond things, within things\"* means considering both the internal and external aspects of things. *\"Utmost\"* means the extreme. *\"Where does one draw the line?\"*—what is the limit? Seeking the boundary between noble and base, between small and great—where does one exhaust their principle? From the perspective of things themselves, each deems itself noble and others base—like a rooster prizing its spur or a pig its tusk, or valuing the times when one becomes an emperor. What is not seen in oneself is recognized in others. The hundred limbs and nine orifices all exist together—do they not take turns as ruler and subject? This is the same idea.\n\nThis phrase is most aptly placed: *\"Noble and base do not reside in oneself\"*—it conveys the idea that rank and eminence are but transient lodgings. *\"Gradation\"* means hierarchy. Heaven and earth are but a millet grain or a hair’s tip compared to Mount Tai—how can their hierarchical measures be spoken of? Their gradations are plain to see.\n\n*\"Merit division\"* refers to the boundaries of merit and labor. Each fulfills a role to contribute merit, hence *\"merit division.\"* Farmers, merchants, artisans, and traders each exert their strength according to their station; the world cannot lack a single one, just as east, west, south, and north, though opposite, cannot do without one another.\n\n*\"Inclinations and integrity\"* refer to the direction of one’s aspirations and the steadfastness of one’s will. To deem Yao right and Jie wrong is the natural course of such inclinations. Yet if none were ever deposed, how could a ruler rise? Observing this, the instability of such inclinations becomes clear.\n\n*\"Following their size, following their presence or absence, following their rightness or wrongness\"*—this is the meaning of *\"equalizing things by following their affirmations.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, Yao and Shun abdicated and were enthroned; Kuai abdicated and perished. Tang and Wu contended and became kings; Duke Bo contended and was destroyed. From this, we see that the rites of contention and abdication, the conduct of Yao and Jie, the noble and the base—these are all matters of circumstance and cannot be taken as constant.\n\nComparing Yao and Shun with Kuai, Tang and Wu with Duke Bo, these are impassioned arguments of their time, filled with such examples. Yet one may simply observe the flow of the text.\n\nA roof beam can batter a city wall but cannot plug a mouse hole—this speaks of different tools. A fine steed like Qiji or Hualiu can gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet cannot match a wildcat or weasel in catching rats—this speaks of different skills. The owl snatches fleas at night, discerning the finest details, yet by day it stares blankly and cannot see a mountain—this speaks of different natures.\n\nThus, it is said: *\"If one takes this as the teacher and nothing as wrong, takes this as order and nothing as chaos\"*—this is the view of one who does not understand the principles of heaven and earth or the conditions of the myriad things. It is like taking heaven as the teacher without earth, or yin as the teacher without yang—its impracticability is evident. Yet those who persist in such talk without ceasing are either fools or deceivers.\n\nThe abdications of the Five Emperors differed; the successions of the Three Dynasties varied. Those who defy their times and customs are called usurpers; those who align with their times and customs are called righteous successors. O River Lord, how do you know the gates of noble and base or the households of small and great?\n\n*\"Liang\"* means beam; *\"li\"* is pronounced as *li*, meaning the ridgepole of a house. Each has its use, hence *\"different tools.\"* Qiji and the wildcat each have their abilities, hence *\"different skills.\"* The owl is also called the *xiao*, a kind of owl. By night its eyes are sharp, but by day it is blind—its nature differs. Right and wrong, order and chaos cannot do without one another; these are necessities of the human world. Thus, the analogy of different tools, skills, and natures is used. Heaven and earth, yin and yang are likewise analogized as indispensable to one another.\n\n*\"Usurpers and righteous successors\"*—this is the same discourse as that on Yao and Jie.\n\nThe River Lord said: *\"Then what should I do? What should I not do?\"*\n\nWith my words of acceptance and rejection, my choices of pursuit and abandonment—how shall I ultimately proceed?\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: *\"Viewed through the Dao, what is noble? What is base? This is called 'returning to abundance'—unfettered, the will aligns with the Dao in its vast obstruction. What is little? What is much? This is called 'declining bestowal'—without clinging to one, the conduct harmonizes with the Dao without discord. How solemn! Like a state with its ruler, it grants no private virtue. How reverent! Like a sacrifice with its altar, it confers no private blessing. Vast and boundless, like the four directions without end, it has no demarcations. Embracing the ten thousand things, which could bear its support? This is called 'without direction.' The ten thousand things are one in equality—what is short? What is long? The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and birth. They do not rely on their completion. Now empty, now full, they do not settle in their forms. Years cannot be grasped; time cannot be halted. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—when one ends, another begins. This is how one speaks of the great meaning of the Dao and discusses the principles of the ten thousand things.*\n\n*Things come to life as if galloping, as if racing—no movement without change, no moment without transformation. What is to be done? What is not to be done? They are fundamentally self-transforming.\"*\n\nThis question is well-posed: if there is neither noble nor base, neither right nor wrong, then how shall I determine my acceptance or rejection, my pursuit or abandonment? *\"Fan\"* means broad and expansive; *\"fan\"* here is the same character, meaning to seek within oneself. Viewed through the Dao, there is no noble or base—thus, one returns to oneself, naturally at ease and expansive. Hence, it is called *\"returning to abundance.\"* If one binds oneself with distinctions of noble and base, right and wrong, one strays from the Dao. Thus, it is said: *\"unfettered, the will aligns with the Dao in its vast obstruction.\"* Bestowal entails more or less; abandoning bestowal entails neither more nor less. Hence, it is called *\"declining bestowal.\"* If one clings to a single course and is bound by the distinctions of more or less in bestowal, one falls out of step with the Dao. Thus, it is said: *\"without clinging to one, the conduct harmonizes with the Dao without discord.\"* A state with its ruler, a sacrifice with its altar—these analogies illustrate that the mind takes the Dao as its master, without employing private preferences. Hence, it is said: *\"it grants no private virtue, confers no private blessing.\"* This mind is as vast as the four directions, without limit—thus, it has no private divisions. Hence, it is said: *\"it has no demarcations.\"* The three *\"its\"* in these three sentences are distinct. All things are complete within me—this is *\"embracing.\"* Without partiality, hence: *\"which could bear its support?\"* *\"Bearing support\"* describes the intent of partiality. *\"Without direction\"* means without a fixed mind. With no fixed mind, things have no short or long, no life or death. Not relying on completion is as previously stated: *\"not forcing success.\"* Fullness and emptiness follow the moment—no fixed position. Hence, it is said: *\"now empty, now full, they do not settle in their forms.\"* Without past or present, years cannot be grasped; without going or coming, time cannot be halted.\n\n*\"Great meaning\"* refers to the great Dao. *\"Things come to life as if galloping, as if racing\"*—this is what is meant by *\"all things flow away like this.\"* Change and transformation occur without cease—what is to be done? What is not to be done? All is left to the self-transformation of creation. Hence, it is said: *\"they are fundamentally self-transforming.\"*\n\nThe River Lord said: *\"Then what is noble about the Dao?\"*\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: *\"One who knows the Dao necessarily comprehends principle; one who comprehends principle necessarily understands adaptability. One who understands adaptability does not allow things to harm the self. The one of utmost virtue cannot be scorched by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or injured by birds or beasts. This is not to say one belittles them—it means discerning safety and danger, finding peace in fortune and misfortune, being cautious in approach and retreat, so that nothing can cause harm. Thus, it is said: 'Heaven is within, man is without; virtue resides in Heaven.' Knowing the conduct of Heaven and man originates in Heaven, one abides in attainment, bends and stretches, returns to the essential, and speaks of the ultimate.*\n\n*This question is also well-posed: if one simply follows the transformations of creation, then there is no need for man to study the Dao.\"*\n\nIn Zhu Xi’s *Questions and Answers*, Liao Deming once raised this question, but Master Zhu did not answer—perhaps it was difficult to articulate. Here, Zhuangzi employs the word *\"adaptability\"* with the skill of a master, and the phrase *\"does not allow things to harm the self\"* makes it even clearer. It seems Zhuangzi’s realization of the Dao was intimate and direct; those who read his work may not fully grasp that he speaks of the Dao in its entirety.\n\n*\"Principle\"* refers to the inherent order of things and affairs. *\"Adaptability\"* lies in one’s use of it—only with the complete embodiment of the Dao does one attain this great function. One who understands adaptability does not allow things to harm the self—this is knowing the weight of circumstances. The four phrases—water, fire, birds, beasts—each use *\"cannot\"* to emphasize, then conclude with *\"this is not to say\"* to clarify the vein of thought, lending force to the language. *\"Belittles\"* means to press close. The person of utmost virtue certainly knows all things have their fate—how could external things cause harm? Yet this does not mean one may recklessly belittle them. For example, though death by water or fire is said to be fate, would one willingly throw oneself into water or fire?\n\n\n+++++ src/pages/annotations/2024-07-27-early-morning.md\n---\ntitle: \"Early Morning\"\nlayout: ../../layouts/AnnotationLayout.astro\n---\n\n**Early Morning**\n*by Li Shangyin*\n\nNo light yet on the mountain pass,\nThe moon hangs in the deep blue sky.\nThe rooster crows, the drum sounds,\nThe traveller stirs, the lamp gutters low.\n\nThe fragrant rice steams with white flowers,\nThe sooty saucepan holds a black broth.\nHow many times has the traveler risen early,\nTo the crowing of the rooster and the sound of the drum?\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Li Shangyin (813–858)** was a late Tang dynasty poet known for his dense, allusive style and melancholic themes. This poem, from his *Miscellaneous Poems (Za shi)*, captures the quiet, liminal moment between night and day, a recurring motif in his work.\n\n- **Mountain pass (关 guān):** Likely refers to a frontier pass, evoking the sense of a remote or desolate place, a common setting in Tang poetry for themes of travel and exile.\n\n- **Deep blue sky (苍苍 cāngcāng):** A phrase often used to describe the vast, twilight sky, here suggesting the pre-dawn hour when the sky is still dark but beginning to lighten.\n\n- **Rooster crows, drum sounds (鸡鸣鼓响 jī míng gǔ xiǎng):** In ancient China, roosters and drums were traditional markers of time, signaling the start of the day. The drum may refer to a watchtower drum used in military outposts or cities to mark the changing of the guard.\n\n- **Fragrant rice (香饭 xiāng fàn):** A poetic way to describe freshly steamed rice, its aroma evoking warmth and sustenance, a small comfort for the weary traveler.\n\n- **Sooty saucepan (烟锅 yān guō):** The blackened pot, stained from repeated use, contrasts with the purity of the steaming rice, adding a touch of realism and hardship to the scene.\n\n- **White flowers (白花 bái huā):** Likely refers to the steam rising from the rice, which appears like white blossoms in the dim light.\n\n- **Black broth (黑汁 hēi zhī):** A simple, dark broth, possibly made from soy sauce or fermented black beans, a humble meal for a traveler.\n\n- **How many times (几度 jǐ dù):** Suggests the traveler’s weariness and the repetitive nature of their journey, a common theme in Li Shangyin’s poetry, where time feels cyclical and burdensome.\n\n- **Structure and tone:** The poem is written in *wuyan jueju* (五言绝句), a five-character quatrain, a form often used for concise, evocative scenes. The tone is quiet and introspective, with a sense of loneliness and transience. The repetition of sounds (e.g., *guān, cāng, xiǎng, dī*) creates a musical, almost hypnotic effect, reinforcing the poem’s meditative mood.\n\n- **Themes:** The poem explores themes of solitude, the passage of time, and the small, fleeting comforts of life. The traveler’s early rising, marked by the rooster and drum, suggests a life of duty or exile, where even the simplest meal becomes a moment of respite. The contrast between light and dark, warmth and cold, mirrors the liminal space the poem inhabits—between night and day, rest and labor, home and the road.\n\n\n+++++ src/pages/annotations/2024-07-28-the-hermit.md\n---\ntitle: \"The Hermit\"\nlayout: ../../layouts/AnnotationLayout.astro\n---\n\n**The Hermit**\n*by Jia Dao*\n\nBeneath the pines I ask the boy,\nHe says, \"The master’s gone to gather herbs.\nHe’s somewhere on this mountain—\nThe clouds are deep, I don’t know where.\"\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Jia Dao (779–843)** was a Tang dynasty poet known for his meticulous craftsmanship and focus on the lives of recluses and hermits. This poem, from his *Five-Character Quatrains (Wuyan jueju)*, is one of his most famous works, capturing the elusive nature of the Daoist hermit and the quiet mystery of the natural world.\n\n- **Pines (松 sōng):** In Chinese poetry, pines are often associated with longevity, resilience, and the Daoist ideal of living in harmony with nature. Their presence here sets the scene as one of solitude and natural beauty.\n\n- **The boy (童子 tóngzǐ):** Likely a young disciple or servant of the hermit, emphasizing the hermit’s reclusive lifestyle and the transmission of knowledge or tradition.\n\n- **\"The master’s gone to gather herbs\" (师采药去 shī cǎi yào qù):** Gathering herbs was a common activity for Daoist hermits, both for medicinal purposes and as a metaphor for seeking the \"herbs of immortality\" or the Dao itself. The line suggests the hermit’s deep connection to nature and his pursuit of spiritual or physical well-being.\n\n- **\"He’s somewhere on this mountain\" (只在此山中 zhǐ zài cǐ shān zhōng):** The ambiguity of the hermit’s location reflects the Daoist ideal of living in harmony with the natural world, where one’s presence is felt but not fixed. The mountain itself becomes a metaphor for the vastness of the Dao, which cannot be easily pinned down.\n\n- **\"The clouds are deep, I don’t know where\" (云深不知处 yún shēn bù zhī chù):** The final line is the most evocative, using the image of deep clouds to convey the hermit’s elusiveness and the mystery of the natural world. The clouds obscure the hermit’s exact location, suggesting that the Dao, like the hermit, is both present and intangible, knowable only through indirect means.\n\n- **Structure and tone:** The poem is a *wuyan jueju* (五言绝句), a five-character quatrain, a form often used for concise, vivid scenes. The tone is quiet and contemplative, with a sense of mystery and reverence for the natural world. The dialogue between the speaker and the boy creates a sense of immediacy, while the final line leaves the reader with a sense of wonder and unanswered questions.\n\n- **Themes:** The poem explores themes of solitude, the search for the Dao, and the elusive nature of truth. The hermit’s absence is as meaningful as his presence, suggesting that the Dao is not something that can be directly grasped but must be sought through indirect means, such as nature, intuition, or the guidance of a master. The poem also reflects the Daoist ideal of *wuwei* (无为), or \"non-action,\" where one lives in harmony with the natural flow of the world rather than trying to control it.\n\n- **Literary devices:**\n  - **Imagery:** The pines, clouds, and mountain create a vivid natural scene that evokes a sense of mystery and tranquility.\n  - **Dialogue:** The brief exchange between the speaker and the boy adds a layer of realism and immediacy to the poem.\n  - **Symbolism:** The hermit, the mountain, and the clouds all serve as symbols of the Dao, which is both present and elusive, knowable and unknowable.\n  - **Ambiguity:** The poem’s brevity and open-endedness invite the reader to reflect on the deeper meaning of the hermit’s absence and the nature of the Dao.\n\n\n+++++ src/pages/annotations/2024-07-29-the-peach-blossom-stream.md\n---\ntitle: \"The Peach Blossom Stream\"\nlayout: ../../layouts/AnnotationLayout.astro\n---\n\n**The Peach Blossom Stream**\n*by Zhang Zhihe*\n\nWhere to find the fisherman’s song?\nBeyond the island, mist veils the shore.\nNot that I seek the hidden way—\nThe peach blossoms have led me here.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Zhang Zhihe (730–810?)** was a Tang dynasty poet and Daoist hermit, known for his reclusive lifestyle and his poems about fishing and the natural world. This poem, *Yu Ge Zi* (渔歌子), is one of his most famous works, capturing the serene beauty of a secluded riverside scene and the poet’s sense of harmony with nature.\n\n- **Fisherman’s song (渔歌 yú gē):** In Chinese poetry, the fisherman is often a symbol of the reclusive life, free from the constraints of society and in tune with the rhythms of nature. The fisherman’s song represents this ideal of simplicity and contentment.\n\n- **\"Beyond the island, mist veils the shore\" (岛屿微茫茫 dǎo yǔ wēi máng máng):** The mist obscures the shore, creating a sense of mystery and seclusion. The island and the mist evoke the idea of a hidden, almost otherworldly place, untouched by the outside world.\n\n- **\"Not that I seek the hidden way\" (非为避秦时 fēi wèi bì Qín shí):** This line alludes to the famous *Peach Blossom Spring* (桃花源) by Tao Yuanming, a utopian tale about a hidden village where people live in peace, unaware of the outside world. Zhang Zhihe is saying that he is not deliberately seeking such a hidden paradise—rather, he has stumbled upon it naturally, led by the beauty of the peach blossoms.\n\n- **\"The peach blossoms have led me here\" (桃花带雨飞 táo huā dài yǔ fēi):** The peach blossoms, often associated with spring and renewal, symbolize the beauty and spontaneity of nature. Their presence suggests that the poet’s arrival at this secluded spot is not the result of deliberate effort but rather a natural, almost fated occurrence. The phrase *\"dai yu fei\"* (带雨飞) can also be interpreted as the blossoms \"flying with the rain,\" adding a sense of movement and vitality to the scene.\n\n- **Structure and tone:** The poem is a *wuyan jueju* (五言绝句), a five-character quatrain, a form often used for concise, vivid scenes. The tone is peaceful and contemplative, with a sense of wonder and harmony with nature. The poem’s brevity and simplicity reflect the Daoist ideal of *wuwei* (无为), or \"non-action,\" where one lives in accordance with the natural flow of the world.\n\n- **Themes:** The poem explores themes of reclusion, the beauty of nature, and the idea of finding peace and contentment in a secluded, untouched world. The peach blossoms serve as a symbol of the natural world’s ability to guide and inspire, leading the poet to a place of tranquility and harmony. The poem also reflects the Daoist ideal of living in the moment, free from the distractions and pressures of society.\n\n- **Literary devices:**\n  - **Allusion:** The reference to *Peach Blossom Spring* adds depth to the poem, connecting it to a broader literary tradition of utopian seclusion.\n  - **Imagery:** The mist, the island, and the peach blossoms create a vivid, dreamlike scene that evokes a sense of peace and mystery.\n  - **Symbolism:** The fisherman, the peach blossoms, and the mist all serve as symbols of the reclusive life and the beauty of nature.\n  - **Ambiguity:** The poem’s brevity and open-endedness invite the reader to reflect on the deeper meaning of the scene and the poet’s connection to nature.\n\n\n+++++ src/pages/annotations/2024-07-30-the-hermit-of-orchid-valley.md\n---\ntitle: \"The Hermit of Orchid Valley\"\nlayout: ../../layouts/AnnotationLayout.astro\n---\n\n**The Hermit of Orchid Valley**\n*by Meng Jiao*\n\nIn Orchid Valley, the hermit’s home—\nNo dust, no noise, the gate sealed tight.\nSpring waters flow through empty rooms,\nThe moon shines bright on moss so green.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Meng Jiao (751–814)** was a Tang dynasty poet known for his stark, unadorned style and his focus on themes of poverty, solitude\n\nBelow it states, *\"Be cautious in advance and retreat,\"* which clarifies the meaning further—akin to Mencius’ saying, *\"One who understands fate does not stand beneath a crumbling wall.\"* To discern safety and danger, to determine fortune and misfortune, to be prudent in advance and retreat—this is the Dao within the heart. How could the human heart ever be left entirely to nature? Yet when Zhuangzi reaches this point, how could he be muddled or restless?\n\nHeaven resides within; humanity, without—just as the earlier passage states: *\"The ruler is the Dao of Heaven; the minister is the Dao of humanity.\"* Virtue lies in Heaven; this speaks of the virtue of nature. Yet he insists on saying *\"knowing the conduct of Heaven and humanity\"*—this *\"knowing\"* arises from the human heart, rooted in nature and at ease with what it attains. Thus, he says, *\"Rooted in the position of Heaven, settled in what is attained.\"* This line again belongs to the Dao of the heart, its settled abiding.\n\n*\"To tread carefully, to advance and retreat\"*—to bend or stretch, to advance or withdraw, each following its own principle—this line again belongs to the human heart, elucidating the essence of the Dao. The ultimate principle is this: *\"Thus, to return to the essential and speak of the ultimate\"*—akin to Mencius’ *\"turning back to simplicity.\"* He asks, *\"What is Heaven? What is humanity?\"* Ruo of the Northern Sea replies: *\"The four legs of oxen and horses—this is called Heaven. Bridling a horse’s head or piercing an ox’s nose—this is called humanity.\"* Hence, he says: *\"Do not let humanity destroy Heaven; do not let purpose obliterate fate; do not let the pursuit of gain lead to the sacrifice of reputation. Be cautious and guard it without loss—this is called returning to one’s true nature.\"*\n\nThese lines make the distinction between the human heart and the Dao-heart ever clearer. The four legs of oxen and horses are received from Heaven, natural and unrestrained—if not tethered or pierced, they would be of no use. This is the affair of the human heart. To let humanity destroy Heaven, to let purpose obliterate fate, to covet gain and chase reputation—here, the human heart flows into peril. The three *\"do not\"* are prohibitive phrases, like the four *\"do not\"* before. Having known Heaven and known humanity, to guard this cautiously without loss is to preserve the Heavenly principle in full. Thus, he says, *\"This is called returning to one’s true nature.\"* Fate is the Heavenly principle; humanity is human affairs. *\"Attainment\"* here refers to what is gained or lost.\n\nThe centipede pities the snake, the snake pities the wind, the wind pities the eye, the eye pities the heart. The centipede says to the snake: *\"I stride along on one leg—what can I do? Now you move with many feet—how do you manage?\"* The snake replies: *\"Not so. Have you not seen those who spit?\"*\n\nWhen one spits, the large droplets fall like pearls, the small like mist, scattering downward in numbers beyond count. Now, I move by my Heavenly mechanism yet know not how it comes to be.\" The centipede said to the snake: \"I walk with many feet yet cannot match your footlessness—why is this?\" The snake replied: \"How can one alter what the Heavenly mechanism sets in motion? What need have I for feet?\"\n\nThe snake said to the wind: \"When I move by flexing my spine and ribs, there is at least some semblance of form. Yet you—rising in a great rush from the Northern Sea, rushing in a great rush into the Southern Sea—seem to be yet not to be. Why is this?\" The wind replied: \"Indeed, I rise in a great rush from the Northern Sea and enter the Southern Sea. Yet if one points at me, I am overcome; if one blocks me, I am overcome. Nevertheless, to snap great trees and topple great houses—only I can do this. Thus, to be undone by many small things is to achieve the greatest victory. Only the sage can attain such a great victory.\"\n\nThe *qi* has no horns, one foot, and walks—recorded in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. The centipede is the hundred-footed insect; the snake is the footless one. From one foot to no feet, all speak of the spontaneous movement of the Heavenly mechanism. This may be called the most wondrous passage in the world. Within it, the comparison of human spittle to the centipede’s feet is marvelous, and its conclusion returning to the wind—while the eye and heart are left unaddressed—is a shift in the text, wondrous and yet more wondrous.\n\n*Trenchuo* describes the manner of walking on one foot—\"I can do nothing about it.\"\n\n\"There is none like me—how could this be altered? It cannot be changed. 'There is a likeness' refers to a visible form. *Pengpeng*—the sound of wind. Pointing at me with a hand gestures toward the wind; defending against me with a foot tramples the wind. Within the wind, the addition of 'small defeats' and 'great victories' makes it ever more wondrous. This conveys the idea that though the many may overcome Heaven, and Heaven may overcome the many, the small may not prevail yet the great victory belongs to none beyond the workings of creation. That which is spontaneous and natural cannot be defied by any thing. When Confucius traveled to Kuang, men of Song surrounded him in several layers, yet he continued singing without pause. Zilu entered and asked, 'Why is the Master so joyful?' Confucius replied, 'Come, let me tell you. I have long avoided adversity, yet it has not spared me—this is fate. I have long sought success, yet it has not come—this is timing. Under Yao and Shun, there were no destitute men, not because they were wise enough to obtain it; under Jie and Zhou, there were no successful men, not because they were wise enough to lose it. Such is the way of circumstances. The fisherman who travels through water without avoiding dragons and serpents displays the courage of his trade. The hunter who travels on land without avoiding rhinoceroses and tigers displays the courage of his trade. The man who faces flashing blades and regards death as life displays the courage of a martyr. But he who knows that adversity is a matter of fate, that success is a matter of timing, and who confronts great peril without fear—this is the courage of the sage.' Zilu, take your place. My fate is governed by forces beyond me. Soon, the armored men advanced and said, 'We mistook you for Yang Hu, hence the siege. Now that we know otherwise, we withdraw.' This passage merely speaks of timing and fate as natural, not subject to human foresight—what fear could the Dao-knower have? The comparison of the fisherman, hunter, and martyr to the sage is also fitting, conveying the idea that one should cease and not dwell on such matters.\n\nGongsun Long asked Wei Mou, 'In my youth, I studied the Dao of the former kings; in maturity, I understood the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I harmonized sameness and difference, separated hardness and whiteness, affirmed the \"so\" and the \"not-so,\" and refuted the \"can\" and the \"cannot.\" I exhausted the wisdom of the Hundred Schools and silenced the debates of countless mouths. I considered myself the most enlightened—until now, hearing Zhuangzi’s words, I am bewildered. I do not know whether my understanding falls short of his, or whether my knowledge is inferior. Now, I am at a loss for words. May I ask the reason?' Prince Mou sighed deeply, looked up to the sky, and laughed, saying, 'Have you not heard of the frog in the shallow well? It said to the turtle of the Eastern Sea, \"How joyful I am! I leap about on the railing of the well, rest in the broken walls of its sides. When I enter the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my chin; when I tread in the mud, it covers my feet and submerges my ankles. I look around at the shrimp, crabs, and tadpoles—none can compare to me! Moreover, to command the water of a single ravine and stand astride the joy of a shallow well—this is the utmost delight. Why do you not come in and see for yourself?\" The turtle of the Eastern Sea had not yet placed its left foot inside when its right knee was already stuck. It retreated and told the frog of the sea: \"A distance of a thousand *li* does not suffice to describe its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* does not suffice to measure its depth. In the time of Yu, floods lasted nine years out of ten, yet the waters did not increase; in the time of Tang, droughts lasted seven years out of eight, yet the shores did not recede. Not to be altered by the passage of time, nor by the quantity of water—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.\" At this, the frog in the shallow well was stunned, dismayed, and lost.\n\nMoreover, for one who does not know the boundary between knowledge and ignorance, right and wrong, to yet desire to examine Zhuangzi’s words is like making a mosquito carry a mountain or a centipede race across a river—it will surely fail. And for one who does not understand the ultimate discourse yet seeks momentary satisfaction—is this not the frog in the shallow well? For he treads upon the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Vastness, unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, submerged in the unfathomable, unconfined by east or west, beginning in profound obscurity and returning to great penetration. Yet you seek to measure it with narrow vision, to grasp it with petty debate—is this not like using a tube to view the sky or a awl to probe the earth? How small indeed! Go now.'\"\n\nMoreover, have you alone not heard of the young man of Shouling who studied the walk of Handan? Before he had mastered the state’s art, he had already lost his former gait—all he could do was crawl home on hands and knees. If you do not depart now, you will forget your original ways and lose your own craft.\n\nGongsun Long’s mouth gaped open, unable to close; his tongue lifted, unable to descend—then he bolted and fled. Gongsun Long was a master of disputation in his time, and to name him is to invoke the very means by which he refuted others. The parables of the well-frog and the sea-turtle are all fabricated—how could Laozi’s breast contain so many petty images?\n\nThe *hán* is a red worm of the well; the *xiè* is the crab. In the hollow of a shallow well, *hán*, *xiè*, and tadpoles all circle one another—thus it is said, “return to the *hán*, *xiè*, and tadpoles.” Nine years of flood, seven years of drought—how could people endure such prolonged deluge and desiccation? Truly, all would perish.\n\nZhuangzi’s phrase “ten years of nine floods, eight years of seven droughts” is written with such ease, yet the brushwork reveals a different force altogether. *Shìshì* is like *xīxī*—both express alarm. The *shāngjù* is a tiny insect; *cǐ* means to tread.\n\nThe Great August Heaven—below, one treads the Yellow Springs; above, one ascends to the heavens—such is the loftiness and remoteness of his vision. *Shìrán* is to be suddenly released, at ease. Fourfold liberation, fourfold penetration—plunging into the unfathomable, the depths of his entry are profound. Beginning in the dark and obscure, he speaks of what lies before the boundless. Returning to the Great Thoroughfare, he reverts to the Ultimate Dao.\n\nTo employ the petty clarity of discriminating wisdom in an attempt to exhaustively probe it with words and debate—is this not small indeed? The parable of the man of Handan who lost his gait is especially fine: *guónéng* refers to the gait native to the state of Handan. Having failed to master it, he also lost his original way of walking—thus he crawled home on all fours.\n\nWhat Liezi says of Wei Mou and Gongsun Long differs entirely from this. Zhuangzi was fishing at Pu Water when the King of Chu sent two grandees to approach him first, saying, “I wish to burden you with the affairs of the realm.” Zhuangzi, holding his rod, did not even glance at them, and said, “I have heard that in Chu there is a sacred turtle that has been dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in cloth and stored in a casket, enshrined in the ancestral temple. Would this turtle rather have died and left its bones to be venerated, or lived and dragged its tail through the mud?” The two grandees said, “It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.” Zhuangzi said, “Go away. I too shall drag my tail through the mud.”\n\nThe phrase “to approach him first” means to go ahead and convey this intent. “To burden you with the affairs of the realm” means to entrust him with governance. The parable of choosing between death and leaving one’s bones or life and dragging one’s tail—truly, it is extraordinary.\n\nWhen Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him. Someone said to Huizi, “Zhuangzi has come intending to replace you as minister.” Thereupon Huizi, alarmed, had the state searched for three days and three nights. Zhuangzi went to see him and said, “In the south there is a bird called the *yuānchú*—are you familiar with it? The *yuānchú* sets out from the South Sea and flies to the North Sea; it will perch only on a paulownia tree, eat only bamboo fruit, and drink only sweet spring water. Now, a *chī* (owl) had found a rotten rat; when the *yuānchú* flew past, it looked up and cried, ‘Hah!’ Now, do you intend to use your state of Liang to ‘hah!’ at me?”\n\nThe *hah* is a cry of fear that one’s food will be snatched away. Comparing the owl’s rotten rat to the *yuānchú* and Huizi’s use of the state to “hah!” at him—where did this old man find so many fine parables? From Zhuangzi onward, those who write have merely fiddled with his mechanisms. How could the world do without this book?\n\nZhuangzi and Huizi were the closest of friends; this incident likely never occurred, but was merely playful mockery. *Liànshí* refers to bamboo fruit.\n\nZhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said, “The *shū* fish swim out at ease—this is the joy of fish.” Huizi said, “You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?” Zhuangzi said, “You are not me—how do you know that I do not know the joy of fish?” Huizi said, “I am not you, so of course I do not know you. You are certainly not a fish, so your not knowing the joy of fish is complete.” Zhuangzi said, “Let us return to the beginning. When you said, ‘How do you know the joy of fish?’ you already knew that I knew it and asked me. I know it here, on the Hao.”\n\nThis exchange is also extraordinary. “Return to the beginning” means to revert to the origin. It means: when you initially asked, “You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?” you already understood my intent in asking this. Since you know me thus, I likewise know the fish here on the Hao. These two were the closest of friends; one imagines their dialogue at the time was a sight to behold.\n\nThis chapter’s dialogue between the River Lord and the Ocean Spirit pairs well with the *Record of the Transmission of the Lamp*’s exchange between National Preceptor Zhong and the monk on “the Dharma of no emotion” and “becoming a buddha with no mind.” Dahui said, “This old man is stubborn, and when he encounters this monk, he too is stubbornly stuck. The question concerns the vitality of his house, the great gate, the vast waves, the severing of the root of life.” These few lines of Zhuangzi are indeed equal to them. (See Dahui’s *Recorded Sayings* in the *Universal Lamp*.)\n\n**Outer Chapters, “Perfect Joy,” Chapter Eighteen**\nIs there perfect joy in the world, or is there not?\n\nIs there a way to preserve the body, or is there not?\nNow, what should one do? On what should one rely? What should one avoid? Where should one dwell? What should one pursue? What should one abandon? What should one delight in? What should one detest?\n\nWhat the world honors are wealth, nobility, longevity, and goodness. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and sweet sounds. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and wickedness. What it suffers are a body denied rest, a mouth denied rich flavors, a form denied fine garments, eyes denied beautiful sights, and ears denied sweet sounds. Those who cannot attain these things are deeply troubled and fearful for their bodies—how foolish!\n\nThe wealthy exhaust themselves with toil, amassing wealth they cannot fully use—how alienated they are from their own bodies! The noble pass their nights and days in anxious thought, weighing right and wrong—how distant they are from their own bodies! Human life is born together with care; the long-lived, dull and burdened, suffer long care—why not die and end this torment? How far they are from their own bodies!\n\nThe steadfast strive for the world’s approval, yet this is not enough to preserve the body. I do not know whether goodness is truly good or truly not good. If it is good, it is not enough to preserve the body; if it is not good, it is enough to preserve others. Thus it is said: “If loyal admonition is unheeded, withdraw and do not contend.” Yet when Wu Zixu contended, his body was destroyed; had he not contended, his name would not have endured. Is there truly goodness, or is there not?\n\nNow, what the world pursues and delights in—I do not know whether this joy is truly joy or truly not joy. I observe that those who rush together in the world’s pursuits do so frantically, as if they cannot help themselves, all calling it joy. Yet I do not find it joyful, nor do I find it not joyful. Is there truly joy, or is there not?\n\nI take non-action as true joy—yet this is what the world deems the greatest suffering. Thus it is said: “Perfect joy is no joy; perfect praise is no praise.” The right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. Perfect joy and the preservation of the body lie only in non-action—how close it is to being realized!\n\nThis chapter expands upon the earlier theme of “not allowing things to harm oneself.” The questions “What should one do? On what should one rely?” and the following four phrases ask, “How can one be right?” The structure here mirrors that of Qu Yuan’s *Encountering Sorrow*. The four types of people—wealthy, noble, long-lived, and good—correspond to the categories of good and evil, fame and reputation. “Toiling ceaselessly” means laboring without rest.\n\nTo ponder good and bad is to take on affairs, yet such thought brings only worry. To grow muddled with age is to lose clarity. The ardent scholar pursues fame and reputation. The four false assumptions share the same root—all harm the self through things. Now that the three false assumptions of wealth, nobility, and longevity have been dismissed, only the ardent scholar remains. This shift in phrasing reveals the artistry of the text.\n\nTo crouch in hesitation or to retreat in caution—if one contends, the body is maimed; if one does not contend for fame, no reputation is made. These two lines expose the worldly folly of pursuing fame to the point of bodily harm—how can this be called good?\n\nThe following passage concludes the four false assumptions: \"All the world rushes together\"—this describes how the masses surge forward in unison. \"Urgent and restless\" conveys their relentless pursuit, as if unable to stop even when they should. \"What the world calls joy, I neither know as joy nor as its absence\"—this expresses deep disdain, for while I find joy in non-action, the world deems it the greatest suffering. Perfect joy lies in no-joy; perfect praise lies in no-praise. Yet who among the worldly understands the joy of no-joy or the praise of no-praise? Thus, the right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. These lines must be read with attention to their rising and falling cadence to appreciate their beauty. \"Nearly preserved\" means that through non-action, one may nearly attain such joy.\n\nLet me attempt to explain: Heaven is non-active and thus clear; Earth is non-active and thus tranquil. When the two non-actions unite, the myriad things transform—vague and indistinct, with no trace of origin, formless and boundless. All things flourish naturally from non-action, hence it is said: \"Heaven and Earth are non-active, yet nothing is left undone.\" Who among men can attain non-action?\n\nThese lines conclude the preceding discussion: when the two non-actions unite, they give rise to the myriad things—this is the meaning of \"non-action yet nothing left undone.\" \"No trace of origin\" means no visible beginning. \"Flourish\" means to grow. All things arise naturally, hence it is said they flourish from non-action. From \"The world has perfect joy\" to \"can one attain non-action?\" this passage flows with undulating rhythm, inviting deep reflection.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences. Zhuangzi sat with legs splayed, drumming on a basin and singing. Huizi said, \"To live with someone, raise a child to old age, and then not weep at their death would be enough—yet you drum and sing. Is this not excessive?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Not so. When she first died, how could I not grieve? But upon reflection, I saw that in the beginning, she was not alive—nor was she merely without life, but without form; nor merely without form, but without qi. Amidst the vague and indistinct, qi transformed, then form, then life. Now, life has transformed into death, like the cycling of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. She lies peacefully in the great chamber, and if I were to wail and weep, I would show myself ignorant of fate—thus I stopped.\"\n\n\"Form transformed into life\" means that form precedes the movement of life. The Buddhists say that movement and stillness return to wind—this is the meaning of \"life.\" They also say: in the eye, it is seeing; in the ear, hearing; in the hand, grasping; in the feet, walking—this is the meaning of \"life.\" \"The cycling of the four seasons\" is a metaphor for the inevitability of death following life.\n\nThis passage illustrates the principle that life and death are one continuum. The act of drumming on the basin is also allegorical. Consider Yuan Rang, who climbed a tree and sang at his parent’s death—could he truly have been devoid of human feeling? If so, he would be no better than a beast. Would the Master have befriended him? The teachings of the Confucian school emphasize fulfilling filial piety—how could they not understand the principle of life and death? Yuan Rang, Zhuangzi, and their ilk sought to expose the world’s delusions, hence their extreme actions. This is the subtlety of the Daoist mind, which cannot be practiced in isolation. Thus, the teaching of the \"Golden Mean\" exists. Did Zhuangzi and Liezi not understand this? They merely sought to correct the world’s weariness of convention through such arguments.\n\nWhen Li Hanlao mourned his son, Da Hui reproached him for being unable to let go of emotion, fearing it was not in accord with the Dao. Da Hui replied, \"Not weeping at a child’s death is the way of beasts.\" This elder’s words show great insight. Other Buddhists, when asked such questions, would only spout nonsense.\n\nZhilishu and Huajieshu were observing the mound of Mingbo, the wasteland of Kunlun, and the resting place of the Yellow Emperor when suddenly a growth appeared on Huajieshu’s left elbow. He was dismayed. Zhilishu asked, \"Do you dislike it?\" Huajieshu replied, \"No—why should I? Life is a temporary borrowing. What is borrowed is life; life is but dust and grime. Death and life are like day and night. You and I observe transformation, and now it has reached us—why should I dislike it?\"\n\n\"Huajie\" means \"slippery and humorous\"—such names are surely invented. \"The Yellow Emperor’s resting place\" refers to where the Emperor once rested. \"Growth\" refers to a sore; today, we call it a boil. One imagines such names existed in ancient times. \"Dismayed\" conveys his distress. \"Temporary borrowing\" means this body is a fleeting assemblage of external things. \"Dust and grime\" means it is insignificant within the workings of creation, unworthy of esteem. The Buddhist concept of the \"four conditions forming a false self\" originates here. Where is this illusory body now? The earlier dismay and later indifference seem contradictory, but disliking illness is human nature. To contemplate the principle of life and death and understand its origin is to let the Daoist mind prevail.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi traveled to Chu, he saw an empty skull, bleached and shaped. He tapped it with his horse whip and asked, \"Did you, sir, covet life and lose principle, becoming like this? Or did you meet with the ruin of a state and the executioner’s axe, becoming like this?\"\n\n\"Or did you commit some shameful deed, bringing disgrace upon your parents, wife, and children, becoming like this? Or did you suffer from cold and hunger, becoming like this? Or did your years naturally come to this end?\"\n\nWith these words concluded, Zhuangzi took the skull as his pillow and lay down. In the dead of night, the skull appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Your speech resembles that of a sophist. All that you and others have mentioned are the burdens of the living. In death, none of these exist. Would you like to hear of the joys of death?\"\n\nZhuangzi replied, \"Indeed.\"\n\nThe skull said, \"In death, there is no lord above nor minister below, nor the affairs of the four seasons. At ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass this.\"\n\nZhuangzi, unconvinced, said, \"If I were to have the Controller of Fate restore your form—your bones, flesh, and skin—returning you to your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and acquaintances, would you desire this?\"\n\nThe skull furrowed its brow deeply and replied, \"How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toils of the human world?\"\n\n*(The text notes: \"Hao ran\" describes the empty yet solid appearance; \"cong ran\" conveys a sense of ease and contentment. All that \"you and others\" have spoken are mere suppositions. This passage employs the skull as a fictional device to expound the principle of life and death. Readers should grasp its intent and not take it as literal truth.)*\n\nWhen Yan Yuan was traveling east to Qi, Confucius wore a worried expression. Zigong stepped down from his mat and asked, \"May this student dare to inquire why, when Yan Hui travels to Qi, the Master wears a worried look?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"Excellent question. Long ago, Guanzi spoke words I found most apt: 'A small cloth bag cannot hold large things; a short well-rope cannot draw from deep waters.' Such is the way of things—destiny has its completion, and form has its proper place. These cannot be diminished or augmented.\n\nI fear that Yan Hui, in speaking to the Marquis of Qi of the Dao of Yao, Shun, the Yellow Emperor, and further of Suiren and Shennong, will prompt the marquis to seek within himself and find nothing. Finding nothing, he will be confused. Confusion leads to death. Have you not heard the tale of old? Once, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Marquis of Lu received it with ceremony and offered it wine in the temple, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared a grand feast of sacrificial oxen. The bird, however, looked on with sorrow and dread, refusing to eat a morsel or drink a cup. After three days, it died. This is to nourish a bird with what nourishes oneself, not with what nourishes a bird.\n\nTo nourish a bird as a bird should be nourished, one ought to let it roost in deep forests, wander open plains, float upon rivers and lakes, feed upon minnows and fry, follow in formation, and rest at ease. Birds detest the sound of human speech—why subject it to such clamor? When the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* is performed in the wilds of Dongting, birds hear it and fly away, beasts hear it and flee, fish hear it and dive deep, while men, hearing it, gather to listen. Fish live in water and thrive, but men drown in it. Their likes and dislikes must differ, and thus they are distinct.\n\nTherefore, the sages of old did not demand uniform abilities nor identical tasks. Names were confined to reality, and meanings were set to what was fitting. This is called 'orderly attainment and sustained fortune.' *(A \"chu\" is a cloth bag; a \"geng\" is a well-rope. This metaphor conveys that small strength cannot bear great burdens. Destiny and form, bestowed by heaven, each have their fixed allotment and cannot be diminished or augmented.)*\n\nTo speak of the Dao of the ancient sages to the Marquis of Qi, yet fail to move or transform him, would invite blame upon myself.\" *(This passage uses Yan Hui to satirize the wandering persuaders of the age.)*\n\n\"The food of birds is not the food of men. To nourish a bird with human food violates its nature.\" *(This simply means one should not speak where speech is inappropriate. Yet the sage’s school distills it to a single truth, while Zhuangzi spins vast, boundless words.)* *(The pronunciation of \"yu\" is \"ya,\" meaning to welcome and offer wine. \"Shang\" means to drink. \"Tan\" is pronounced \"dan,\" the same as \"chan,\" referring to sandy shoals in water, hence \"open plains.\")*\n\n\"Not demanding uniform abilities\" means each person’s talents differ. \"Not requiring identical tasks\" means each attends to their own affairs. Names arise from reality, and meanings align with what is fitting. Thus, it is said, \"Names are confined to reality, and meanings are set to what is fitting.\" This means each follows their allotted place. \"Orderly attainment\" means proceeding directly without strain. \"Sustained fortune\" means fortune is ever-present. *(To \"hold\" is to preserve.)* If one does not overreach beyond their capacity, they proceed without strain and preserve their life, free from harm. The intent is no more than this.\n\nLiezi was traveling and eating by the roadside when he saw a century-old skull. Plucking some mugwort, he pointed to it and said, \"Only you and I know that you have never died, never been born. Are you truly sorrowful? Am I truly joyful?\"\n\nSeeds vary in kind. When they obtain water, they become *fang*; at the border of water and earth, they become the raiment of frogs and toads. Born on mounded soil, they become *lingxi*. When *lingxi* obtains rich compost, it becomes *wuzu*. The root of *wuzu* becomes the grub; its leaves become butterflies. Butterflies, in time, transform into insects. Born beneath the stove, their form is like a cast-off shell, and their name is *quduo*. After a thousand days, *quduo* becomes a bird called *ganyugu*. The froth of *ganyugu* becomes *simi*; *simi* becomes *shixi*; *yilu* is born from *shixi*. *Huanghuang* is born from *yilu*; *maorui* is born from *jiuyou*; *qingning* is born from the rot of *yangxi* and *bixu*; *chengcheng* is born from *qingning*; horses are born from *chengcheng*; humans are born from horses. Humans, in turn, return to the mechanism. All things emerge from the mechanism, all things enter the mechanism. What is seen is thus seen by following what is visible.\n\nPlucking mugwort—he was amidst the mugwort, plucking it to point at the skull. \"To live and eat is called nourishment; to die and become quiescent is called joy.\" Yet here it is reversed. All this is but a playful flourish of the brush. You and I point at the skull—this \"joy\" is the bliss of quiescence.\n\n\"Seeds vary in kind\" means that among the myriad things between heaven and earth, the seeds of life differ. Below, the most minute is taken—not as a small analogy for the great, but to say that though great, there is no difference from the small. This is the meaning of \"no fine, no coarse, no noble, no base.\" The intent is simply this, yet the marvel of the writing surpasses all ages. It is orderly yet disorderly, disorderly yet orderly—like soaring clouds and broken geese, like solitary peaks and sheer cliffs. The more one reads, the finer it becomes. If Liezi had added two more lines, it would not have been as good as omitting them.\n\n*Fang* is the scum on water, the first growth of moss not yet fully formed, with threads of entanglement—yet as a thing, it is most minute. The \"raiment of frogs and toads\" is green moss. \"The border of water and earth\" is where water clings to the bank. Where it clings to the bank, it is often thick and abundant, hence called \"raiment.\" These two lines describe green moss, then turn to mounded soil. \"Mounded soil\" is the high ground in the fields. *Lingxi* is *cheqian* grass. *Yuqi* is manure and soil.\n\n*Cheqian* grass growing in manure and soil transforms into *wuzu* grass. The roots of *wuzu* further metamorphose into *qicao*, while its leaves become butterflies. *Qicao* are beetle grubs, also known by the alternate name *xu* for butterflies. The addition of this line beneath \"butterflies\" is particularly striking. Below, it speaks again of creatures born through transformation: the insects beneath the stove, which transform into a creature called *quduo*, soft and without skin or shell—hence said to be \"as if shed,\" like the modern citrus worm. *Quduo* can further transform into the bird *ganyugu*, a species of skeletal bird. These are *simivi* insects, whose flowing saliva in turn transforms into other insects—*shimi*, which are midges. The midges transform into *yilu*, *yilu* into *jiuyou*, *jiuyou* into *huangkuang*, *huangkuang* into *fuxuan*, and *fuxuan* into *maorui*. Here, two lines are omitted with the phrase \"born from,\" a matter of literary structure. *Huangkuang*, *jiuyou*, *fuxuan*, and *maorui* are all names of insects. The underlying meaning is that the transformations of the myriad things are ceaseless, with no end to their generation.\n\nThe preceding passage concludes with something most bizarre, which is where it startles the common world. One must not take it as literal truth. *Yangxi* is the name of a grass, a bamboo-like plant that does not produce shoots—called *busun*, or \"non-shooting bamboo.\" Its shoots are inedible, unlike those of ordinary bamboo. *Qingning* is an insect, as is *cheng*. *Ma* is another name for a grass, what is now called *machicai* (purslane) or *malancao* (horse-fence grass). *Ren* is also a name for a grass, what is now called *renshen* (ginseng). *Renmianzi* is yet another. Though these are clearly the names of various grasses, the deliberate inclusion of the characters for \"horse\" and \"human\" is meant to be uncanny and strange. Previous commentators have all deemed this passage obscure, but in truth, it is the people of a thousand generations who have been duped by Zhuangzi, unable to see through it.\n\nThe transformations of the myriad things—such as sparrows becoming clams, hawks becoming turtledoves, rotting grass becoming fireflies, or moss becoming bats—are boundless. \"Entering the mechanism\" means returning to the end. \"Exiting and entering the mechanism\" is none other than exiting and entering life and death—this is the \"fire-drill,\" the inexhaustible.\n\n**Chapter 19: Attaining Life (Outer Chapters)**\n\nThose who grasp the essence of attaining life do not strive after what is unnecessary for life. Those who grasp the essence of attaining destiny do not pursue what is beyond knowledge. Why then must one nurture the body with things? There are cases where things are in surplus yet the body remains unnourished. There are cases where life must precede the absence of separation from form, yet form remains unsevered while life perishes. Alas! The people of the world believe that nurturing the body is sufficient to preserve life, yet if nurturing the body is truly insufficient to preserve life, then what in the world is worth doing? Though it may be insufficient, one cannot but do it—such is the inescapable.\n\nTo escape the burden of the body, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. Abandoning the world means being without encumbrance; without encumbrance, one is upright and level; upright and level, one alternates with that which renews life; alternating with renewal, one approaches the ultimate. What need is there to abandon affairs? What need is there to forsake life? Abandoning affairs, the body is not wearied; forsaking life, the essence is not scattered. When the body is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things: united, they form a body; dispersed, they become a beginning. When form and essence are not scattered, this is called \"the power to transform.\" Essence, once transformed, returns to assist Heaven in its work of generation.\n\nWhat is meant by \"what is unnecessary for life\" refers to things external to the body—such as the few pairs of sandals or the single spoon a person uses in life. What is meant by \"what is beyond knowledge\" refers to what lies beyond human effort. Nurturing the body must rely on things, and life must preserve its form—this is the common view of the world. Yet things are often in surplus, while the body does not endure forever. Even if the form is preserved, life is finite. Thus it is said: there are cases where things are in surplus yet the body remains unnourished, and cases where form remains unsevered while life perishes. Though it may be insufficient, one cannot but do it—this is what was previously meant by \"nothing is sufficient to be done, yet one cannot but do it.\" The inescapable refers to the fact that whether one acts or not, one cannot avoid self-entanglement. To escape self-entanglement, nothing surpasses abandoning the world.\n\nAbandoning the world does not mean fleeing it. Dwelling in the world with a mind free of attachment, one responds only when moved, acts only when compelled, and rises only when unavoidable. Thus, the self remains the self, and the world remains the world. \"Upright and level\" means the mind is without high or low, without discrimination—akin to the Buddhist saying, \"This dharma is equal.\" \"Alternating with renewal\" means engaging in boundless transformation. \"That\" refers to the Creator. To transform together with the Creator is to renew endlessly, ever fresh. Thus it is said, \"alternating with that which renews life.\" When this is fully realized, one approaches the ultimate—near-perfection.\n\nThose who grasp this truth will find that affairs external to the body and life itself do not await abandonment but are naturally forsaken. \"Essence restored\" means the spirit is not scattered outwardly. \"United, they form a body\" refers to the four great elements combining to form the body; \"dispersed, they return to the beginning\" means returning to the origin, the state before things existed. Form and essence are body and spirit. When body and spirit are not scattered, they possess the power to transform—hence \"the power to shift.\" To shift is to transform. When one embodies the Dao to this degree, essence becomes ever more refined, and one can then assist in the work of creation.\n\nLiezi asked Guanyin, \"The perfected person walks underwater without choking, treads fire without burning, and moves above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one attains this?\" Guanyin replied, \"This is the preservation of pure *qi*—it is not a matter of knowledge, skill, boldness, or courage. Let me tell you: all that has appearance, image, sound, or color is a thing. How can things be far apart from one another? How can they suffice to attain this? First, there is only form; then, things are created. Without form, there is cessation. Without transformation, one attains this and exhausts it. Things, having attained it, come to rest. That which rests will dwell in it.\"\n\nHolding to the measure of non-excess and abiding in the boundless principle, one roams where the myriad things begin and end. Unifying their nature, nurturing their *qi*, harmonizing their virtue, one thereby connects with that from which things are made. Those who do so preserve their Heaven-given integrity in full, their spirit unbreached—how could external things find entry?\n\nConsider the drunkard who falls from a carriage: though the fall be swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole. He is unaware of riding, unaware of falling. Life and death, terror and dread do not enter his breast; thus, he encounters things without fear. If one can be so whole through wine, how much more so when whole through Heaven? The sage hides within Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.\n\nThe avenger does not break the sharpest blade; even one with a vengeful heart does not resent a tile blown by the wind. Thus, the world attains balance: no wars of conquest, no punishments of slaughter—all arises from this Dao.\n\nOne does not open the Heaven in man but opens the Heaven of Heaven. Opening the latter gives birth to virtue; opening the former gives birth to harm. Not wearying of Heaven, not neglecting the people—this is near perfection. With one’s true nature concealed, one moves unseen without obstruction, advancing without hindrance. Walking above the myriad things without fear—this is like riding the wind. The preservation of pure *qi* means guarding the original *qi* in its purity, unadulterated. \"Knowledge and skill\" refer to the mind’s cunning; \"boldness and courage\" refer to the force of strength.\n\nSpeaking of this matter, it is not something that can be achieved through the mind’s cunning or the force of strength. Though these words may seem impractical, they are in truth grounded in principle. Observe today’s practitioners of *fuqi* (breath cultivation): their appearance, form, color, and voice—all bear traces of the tangible. The myriad things are constrained by form; if I too leave traces, I become no different from them. How then can I reach the state before the existence of things? People are confined to their bodies and cannot perceive what lies beyond. All things at their origin are burdened by their own traces—hence it is said, \"This is merely form,\" for form is nothing but trace.\n\nThe Creator of things is formless, thus it is said, \"the creation of things.\" Without form, there is no end and no beginning, one and not two—hence it is said, \"it abides.\" There is no transformation, for transformation implies change. To say it undergoes no change is to grasp the principle of creation. One who fully comprehends this principle of creation transcends the realm of things with form—how distant then is the world of tangible things! Thus it is said, \"Where is the thing?\" To divide it is to indulge in disorder, to lack constancy. The measure of non-indulgence is the constant standard. The beginning without origin is the inception of things—here, \"discipline\" means principle. The beginning and end of the myriad things is creation. To unify one’s nature is to keep it pure and undivided; to harmonize one’s virtue is to preserve it whole and undivided. United with the Creator, one is said to \"communicate with\" it.\n\nWhat creates things is called Heaven, called Spirit—this is the principle within me. Without gaps or fissures, what is within remains whole and unbroken; how then could anything external intrude? Encountering things without fear means that though one may be touched by external things, the spirit remains unmoved and thus unafraid. The analogy of the drunken man falling from a cart is most precise: \"Concealed in Heaven, nothing can harm him\" echoes the earlier passage, \"not allowing things to harm oneself\"—this is what is meant by \"non-action.\"\n\nThe sharpest blade may wound, a tile blown by the wind may strike, yet people do not resent them, for these things act without intention. These two examples illustrate the principle of \"without intention.\" When the world attains balance, it means one moves through the world without preferences or aversions. Where there is contention, there are wars of conquest and punishments of slaughter; but if one is without intention, there is no contention—how then could such things arise?\n\n\"The Heaven in man\" still involves intention, whereas \"the Heaven of Heaven\" is without intention. To open the latter is to give birth to virtue; to open the former is to invite harm. \"Not wearying of Heaven\" means not abandoning Heavenly principle; \"not neglecting the people\" means that while one attends to human affairs, one does so without the mind’s cunning. This is near to true principle.\n\nConfucius, traveling in Chu, came upon a hunchback in the forest catching cicadas with a pole as easily as if picking them up. Confucius said, \"You are skillful! Is there a method to this?\" The man replied, \"I have a method. For five or six months, I practice balancing two pellets on the pole without dropping them; if I drop them, I lose but a few. If I balance three pellets without dropping them, I lose only one in ten. If I balance five pellets without dropping them, I catch cicadas as easily as picking them up. I hold my body as still as a tree stump, my arm as steady as a dry branch. Though the world is vast and things myriad, I am aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside, I do not waver—how could I fail to succeed?\"\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said, \"With undivided focus, the spirit becomes concentrated—this is what the hunchbacked elder means.\" The hunchback was one who caught cicadas by holding a pole and snaring them. By balancing pellets on the pole’s tip, from two to five without dropping them, his concentration became so profound that it entered the realm of spirit. Guo Xiang’s note below the two characters \"停审\" (stillness and scrutiny) is also apt. \"橛株拘\" refers to what we now call a wooden stake—*jue* and *zhu* are names for stakes, and *ju* means fixed. One imagines such terms existed in ancient times. \"Not turning aside, not wavering\" simply means unwavering focus. When catching cicadas, his body was as motionless as a wooden stake, his arm as still as a dry branch. His mind was fixed solely on the cicada, unaware of anything else—this is the height of singular focus. \"With undivided focus\" means the will is not divided; \"the spirit becomes concentrated\" means the spirit is so focused that it becomes spirit-like. Though this is used as an analogy for guarding pure *qi*, such things truly exist in the world, and they exist even today. However, people regard them merely as skills and do not realize the Dao is embedded within.\n\nThe hunchback was one whose back was bent. Yan Yuan asked Confucius, \"I once crossed the deep pool of Shang. The ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him, 'Can one learn to handle a boat?' He said, 'Yes. A good swimmer can learn quickly. As for the diver, he can handle a boat without ever having seen one.' I asked him to explain, but he would not. May I ask what he meant?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"A good swimmer can learn quickly because he has forgotten the water. As for the diver who has never seen a boat yet handles it with ease—he sees the depths as if they were a hill, the overturning of a boat as if it were a cart rolling backward. Though countless dangers may appear before him, they do not enter his mind. Where could he go and not be at ease? One who stakes tiles in a game is skillful; one who stakes hooks is hesitant; one who stakes gold is troubled. The skill is the same, but where there is attachment, the weight is external. Those who are weighed down externally are clumsy within.\"\n\nShang was the name of a deep pool. A swimmer is one who floats on the surface; a diver is one who swims underwater. A skilled diver sees water as level ground and thus can handle a boat without learning. Though countless dangers may arise, his mind remains undisturbed—hence it is said, \"they do not enter his mind.\" *Zhu* means to stake in a game of skill. To stake tiles is to be free of concerns about gain or loss; to stake hooks is to have some attachment; to stake gold is to be deeply attached and thus prone to trouble. *Jin* means to cherish or be attached. The skill of the archer is fundamentally the same, but where there is attachment, the weight is external, and the mind becomes confused. Confusion leads to clumsiness even in skill. Having answered the question, Confucius further illustrated it with this analogy—both analogies embody the highest principle in the world. Observe how the flow of the text rises and concludes—it is truly remarkable.\n\nTian Kaizhi had an audience with Duke Wei of Zhou. The Duke said, \"I have heard that Zhu Shen is a student of the Dao. You have studied with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?\" Tian Kaizhi said, \"Kaizhi sweeps the courtyard with a broom—what could I have learned from the Master?\" The Duke said, \"Tianzi, do not be modest. I wish to hear it.\" Kaizhi said, \"I have heard the Master say: 'One who nurtures life well is like a shepherd—he watches those who lag behind and whips them.'\"\n\nThe Duke said, \"What does this mean?\" Tian Kaizhi said, \"In Lu, there was a man named Shan Bao who lived in the mountains, drank from streams, and did not compete with others for profit. At seventy, he still had the complexion of a child. Unfortunately, he encountered a hungry tiger, which killed and ate him. There was also a man named Zhang Yi who frequented the gates of the wealthy and ran errands for all. At forty, he suffered from internal exhaustion and died. Bao nurtured his inner self, yet the tiger devoured his outer; Yi nurtured his outer self, yet illness attacked his inner. These two did not whip those who lagged behind.\"\n\nA *báhuì* is a broom—*bá* meaning to uproot, as in pulling up by the roots. To \"grasp the broom and stand at the gate\" refers to the duty of disciples in sweeping and cleaning. The shepherd of sheep allows them to roam naturally, yet if one straggles behind and fails to follow the flock, he whips it. This implies that even when following the Dao of Heaven, one must also fulfill human effort.\n\nShan Bao dwelled in the mountains and was killed by a tiger; Zhang Yi frequented the households of the wealthy, though no tiger threatened him, yet his chest burned with restless agitation, and he perished from internal exhaustion. Both cases reveal where human effort was incomplete—one cannot simply entrust all to Heaven. This analogy is most intimate and direct for those who study the Dao. From this, one may grasp Zhuangzi’s intent in distinguishing between the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man: first setting forth a metaphor, then illustrating it with two examples. The structure of the text is also remarkable.\n\nConfucius said: \"Do not retreat into concealment; do not emerge into full display; stand firm in the center.\" If one attains the meaning of these three, one must reach the utmost. \"Do not retreat into concealment\" does not mean to focus solely on stillness; \"do not emerge into full display\" does not mean to cling solely to activity. \"Standing firm\" describes standing without intention, its form like withered wood. Since activity and stillness are not constant, one must not lean toward either extreme—hence \"standing in the center.\" The \"three\" refer to the three phrases above. If one fully embodies these three, one may be called a *zhi ren* (perfected person). Thus it is said: \"If one attains the meaning of these three, one must reach the utmost\"—the utmost being perfection.\n\nNow, those who fear the highway: if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, brothers and kin will warn one another, and only with a great escort of armed followers will they dare to venture forth. Is this not wisdom? Yet what people truly ought to fear lies upon their sleeping mats and between their meals, and not knowing to guard against these is their error. The fear of the highway is likened to the dangers of the sleeping mat—this is the meaning of the saying that \"the axe that hews one’s nature lies in the moth-eyebrows.\" This teaches people the warning against indulging desire. Even sages and worthies, upon hearing Zhuangzi’s words, would surely nod in assent. Is this not also a teaching of the \"heterodox\"?\n\nThe sacrificial officer, clad in dark ceremonial robes, approaches the pen and addresses the pig: \"Why do you hate death? I will raise you for three months, fast for ten days, purify for three, and spread white rushes beneath you as you rest upon my shoulders. Would you then wish to die upon the carved altar?\" If one were to advise the pig, one would say: \"Better to eat chaff and糟 and remain in the pen.\" Yet when advising oneself, one would accept a life of noble rank and a death upon the painted bier, surrounded by mourners. Thus, when advising the pig, one rejects such a fate; when advising oneself, one embraces it. What, then, is the difference between oneself and the pig?\n\n*Xuānduān* refers to the dark ceremonial cap. *Fáng* means to feed with fodder.\n\nTo follow the pig in death—*duàn* is akin to *shàn*, and *dùn* refers to the stand. A stand adorned with patterns is called a *duàndùn*. *Lǚ* means \"bent,\" and what can gather things when bent are bamboo vessels like *běnjǔ*. The previous passage’s \"woven bamboo\" (*biān bó*) refers to such curved implements, confirming these too are bamboo wares. In the second year of Duke Xuān of Lu’s reign, the royal chef overcooked a bear’s paw and was executed, his body placed in a basket—precisely this kind.\n\nTo live with the nobility of *xuānmiǎn* yet die by execution, one’s body cast upon a stumbling block amid bamboo baskets and mats—this too is willingly embraced. This is what Han Yu meant by \"dwelling in filth without shame, facing execution by law without remorse.\"\n\nTo advise the pig thus, yet act so differently for oneself—this analogy is most apt.\n\nDuke Huán was hunting in the marshes when Guǎn Zhòng drove the chariot. The duke saw a *guǐ* and grasped Guǎn Zhòng’s hand, asking, \"Zhòngfù, what do you see?\" Guǎn Zhòng replied, \"Your servant sees nothing.\" The duke returned, sighing in distress, and fell ill for days, refusing to emerge. A Qi scholar named Huángzǐ Gàoáo said, \"The duke has only harmed himself—how could a *guǐ* harm him? When pent-up *qi* scatters and fails to return, it causes insufficiency. If it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to anger; if it descends but does not rise, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. When it neither rises nor falls but lodges in the center of the body, striking the heart, it becomes illness.\" Duke Huán asked, \"Then are there *guǐ*?\" The scholar replied, \"There are. *Shěn* lurks in the depths of ditches, *Lǚ* in the hearth, *Jì* in the door’s lintel. The vexing *rǎngléi* dwells beneath the northeast, while *Bèi’ē* and *Xiélóng* leap in the northwest. *Yìyáng* resides in water, *Wǎngxiàng* in hills, *Zhēn* in mountains, *Fānghuáng* in wilds, and *Wěiyí* in marshes.\"\n\nThe duke asked, \"What is the form of *Wěiyí*?\" Huángzǐ replied, \"*Wěiyí* is as large as a wheel hub, as long as a chariot shaft, clad in purple robes with a crimson cap. As a creature, it abhors the sound of thunder and chariots—when it hears them, it clutches its head and stands. Those who see it are nearly doomed to death.\" Duke Huán laughed heartily and said, \"This is what I saw!\" He then straightened his robes and cap, sat with the scholar, and before the day’s end, his illness had vanished.\n\nThis passage resembles the tale of the \"cup serpent,\" though here the affliction is more peculiar. *Éryí* is like today’s retching, a disorder of *qi* reversal. *Fènchù* is pent-up stagnation. The illness lodges in the body’s center, striking the heart—what people now call \"mid-duct sickness.\" *Shěn* dwells in the mud of ditches, and *Lǚ* is a spirit’s name.\n\nThe name *Jì* is also a spirit’s name. *Fánrǎng* refers to manure soil. *Léitíng* is likewise a demon’s name. *Bèi’ā* and *Xiélóng* are the names of demons dwelling in the northeast corner of a house. *Yìyáng* is the name of a demon in the northwest corner of a house. The above lists the names of demonic entities found in households.\n\n*Wǎngxiàng* is the name of a water spirit. *Zhēn* is the name of a spirit dwelling in small mounds and anthills. *Qí* is the name of a mountain spirit. *Pánghuáng* is the name of a spirit wandering the wilds. *Wěiyí* is the name of a spirit in great marshes. Duke Huán saw it in the marsh, which is why he inquired solely about the form of *Wěiyí*. Initially, the Duke suspected it was an omen, so he grew fearful and fell ill. Now, upon learning that those who see it are destined for hegemony, he rejoiced, and his illness vanished of its own accord. *Zhēnrán* describes the manner of his laughter.\n\nThis parable differs from the tale of seeing a pig bearing mud or a cart laden with demons. Yet since the Sage included such words in the hexagram texts, such matters must indeed exist in the world—no cause for surprise.\n\nMaster Jì Xiāo reared fighting cocks for the king. After ten days, the king asked, \"Is the cock ready?\" He replied, \"Not yet. It is still hollow, relying on its *qi*.\" After another ten days, the king asked again. He replied, \"Not yet. It still responds to sounds and shadows.\" After another ten days, the king asked once more. He replied, \"Nearly so. Though other cocks may crow, this one shows no change. From a distance, it resembles a wooden cock—its virtue is complete. No other cock dares challenge it; they turn and flee instead.\"\n\nTo respond to sounds or react to shadows is to have one’s heart still moved by external things. \"Fierce gaze and full *qi*\" describes its spirit and *qi* now flourishing. \"Fierce gaze yet unmoving\" contrasts with the earlier \"hollow, relying on *qi*\"—then, its *qi* was still external; now, its *qi* is internal. The word \"fierce\" conveys anger, meaning a fixed stare, distinct from the commoner’s hand-on-sword, glaring fiercely. \"Resembling a wooden cock from afar\" means its spirit and *qi* are both whole. This speaks of the art of guarding one’s *qi*, using the cock as a metaphor.\n\nConfucius observed the waters of Lüliang County, plunging thirty *rèn* deep, surging in rapids for forty *lǐ*, a torrent even *yuán*, *tuó*, fish, and turtles could not withstand. He saw a man swimming in it, assuming the man was in distress and wished to die.\n\nThe disciples rushed downstream to rescue him, dragging him out after several hundred paces. With hair unbound, he walked singing along the embankment. Confucius followed and questioned him, saying, \"I took you for a spirit—yet you are a man! May I ask if there is a Dao to treading water?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"No, I have no Dao. I began with *gu*, grew with *chang*, and my nature was completed by *ming*. I enter the water in unison with its swirling eddies and emerge in rhythm with its surging currents, following the water’s Way without imposing my own will. This is how I tread it.\"\n\nConfucius asked, \"What do you mean by *gu*, *chang*, and nature completed by *ming*?\"\n\nThe man said, \"I was born on the hills and at ease with the hills—this is *gu*. I grew up in the water and am at ease with the water—this is *chang*. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is *ming*.\" This analogy aligns with the earlier discussion of steering a boat, both flowing with the current. Thus, it is rooted in what is inherently so.\n\nMencius said, \"Those who speak of nature refer only to *gu*.\" Nature and *ming* are the principles of spontaneity. *Qi* refers to the water’s swirling vortex, while *gu* describes its surging turbulence—entering and exiting, rising and falling with the water. \"Following the water’s Way without imposing my own will\" means flowing with it, neither resisting nor forcing. Born on the hills, one is at ease with the hills; raised in the water, one is at ease with the water—all following their natural course without knowing why. Thus, the three terms *gu*, *chang*, and *ming* are initially indistinct, merely serving the structure of the text. To forcibly assign meanings to \"birth\" and \"growth\" would be mistaken.\n\nWhen Zi Qing carved wood into a *ju*, its completion startled onlookers as if it were the work of spirits. The Duke of Lu saw it and asked, \"What technique did you use to make this?\"\n\nHe replied, \"I am but a craftsman—what technique could I possess? Though if I must say, there is one thing...\"\n\nWhen I set out to carve the *ju*, I never dared to waste my *qi*. First, I fasted to still my mind. After three days of fasting, I no longer dared to think of rewards, rank, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dared to think of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forgot I had limbs and a body.\n\nAt that moment, free from the court and its affairs, my skill became whole, and all external distractions dissolved. Only then did I enter the mountain forest to observe the natural patterns of the trees, their forms and structures at their fullest. Only then did the *ju* appear before me, and only then did I set my hand to it. If not for this, I would have stopped. Thus, it is the union of Heaven with Heaven that makes the work seem divine.\n\nThe *ju* resembles the *jiazhong* bell, though this has puzzled commentators, for bells are made of metal—how could carved wood achieve the same? According to the *Daguan* records, the *ju* is the stand for bells and drums, the frame from which they hang. These frames, shaped like birds or beasts and carved from wood with exquisite craftsmanship, can be seen in the *Kaogong Ji*. The phrase \"startling as if divine\" describes their unparalleled precision, beyond human ability.\n\nTo waste *qi* is to unsettle it. Fasting stills the mind, and only then does *qi* settle. Forgetting rank and reputation, forgetting limbs and body—this is guarding the pure *qi* so that external things cannot enter. \"Free from the court\" means forgetting even the existence of the court. Only thus does one’s skill become whole, and all external distractions that might disturb the mind dissolve and vanish.\n\nEntering the mountain forest to observe \"Heaven’s nature\" means observing the nature of the wood. Each tree has its own form and structure, as if already complete. Only then does one select and use it, applying one’s hand. This is uniting one’s own nature with the nature of the thing—hence, \"Heaven with Heaven.\"\n\nWhen Dongye Ji demonstrated his charioteering before Duke Zhuang, his advances and retreats aligned with the plumb line, his turns with the compass. The Duke declared that even Wen could not surpass him and ordered him to circle the field a hundred times before returning. Yan He encountered him upon his return and said, \"Ji’s horses will fail.\" The Duke kept silent and did not respond. Soon after, the horses indeed failed and returned.\n\nThe Duke asked, \"How did you know?\"\n\nYan He replied, \"His horses were exhausted, yet he still demanded more—hence, failure.\"\n\nThe six reins were woven like patterned silk, and his driving was as skillful as weaving—thus, \"even Wen could not surpass him.\" To \"circle the field a hundred times\" means driving through a hundred turns. When the horses’ strength was spent yet he still urged them on, even the most skilled driver would fail. How much less can one overtax one’s own spirit? This analogy is most apt and precise.\n\nWhen Gongchui turned his hand to draw a circle, it perfectly matched the compass and square. His fingers transformed with the object, not lingering in thought—thus, his mind was whole and unobstructed. Here, the text scatters several lines:\n\nGongchui served Gonggong—hence, \"Gongchui.\" \"Turning\" refers to the hand’s rotation. As he turned his hand to draw a circle, it was as perfect as a cover, naturally conforming to the compass. The *Kaogong Ji* states that the roundness of a cover symbolizes Heaven—thus, it is used as an analogy, not that he was actually making a cover. Like Wu Daozi painting a Buddha’s halo with a single stroke, achieving divine mastery, so too was this.\n\nTo draw a circle without a compass, using only the hand, is a skill of divine mastery. \"Fingers transforming with the object\" is like the saying on calligraphy: \"The hand knows not the brush, the brush knows not the hand.\" Hand and object forget each other, leaving no trace of thought—this is what is meant by \"the senses halt, the spirit moves.\" Thus, \"not lingering in thought.\" Some ask: if a circle matches the compass, why mention the square? They do not realize that within a true circle lies the square. A circle that does not contain a square is no circle at all.\n\nToday’s craftsmen, when carving wood into a circle, must first take a square—showing that compass and square are inseparable. Thus, it is said: \"The compass gives birth to the circle, the square.\" The \"spirit terrace\" is the mind. \"Whole\" means undivided. \"Unobstructed\" means free from constraint.\n\nTo forget the comfort of shoes for the feet, to forget the comfort of a belt for the waist—this is the comfort of a mind that has forgotten right and wrong. Neither inwardly altered nor outwardly following, one attains the comfort of unguarded ease. At first, one seeks comfort and yet is never without it—this is the comfort of forgetting comfort itself.\n\n\"Comfort\" means peace. The feet find peace in shoes, the waist in a belt, as if no thing exists between them—thus it is said: to forget the feet, to forget the waist. This is like attaining the Dao and arriving at ease, where the inner realm remains pure and unchanging. Though one engages with things externally, one no longer knows what one is following. At first, one seeks comfort and yet is never without it—this means that with time, even the sense of comfort is forgotten. It is like feet first stepping into shoes, feeling their perfect fit, then wearing them long enough that the initial sense of comfort fades away. This is the forgetting of comfort. Such is the common experience of people, yet it illustrates the Dao. One must personally embody and investigate it to grasp how Zhuangzi exhausts the principles of things.\n\nThere was a man named Sun Xiu who came to the door, astonished, and said to Bian Qingzi: \"In my village, I am not known for cultivating conduct; in times of crisis, I am not known for courage. Yet when the fields yield no harvest, when serving a lord brings no recognition, when I am slighted in my village and driven from my district—what crime have I committed? Is this Heaven’s will?\"\n\nSun Xiu resented encountering such fate. Bianzi said, \"Have you alone not heard of the Perfect Person’s self-conduct? They forget their liver and gall, leave behind their ears and eyes, wandering in boundless confusion beyond the dust and grime, roaming freely in the work of no-affairs—this is called acting without reliance, growing without domination. Now you adorn knowledge to startle the foolish, cultivate the body to illuminate the filthy, shining brightly as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride. You have preserved your whole form, your nine orifices intact, yet halfway along the Way you are struck by deafness, blindness, lameness, and deformity—even to be counted among the ranks of people is already fortunate. How then do you have leisure to resent Heaven’s blame? Be on your way.\"\n\nSun Xiu departed, and Bianzi entered and sat. After a while, he looked up to the sky and sighed. His disciples asked, \"Master, why do you sigh?\" Bianzi said, \"Earlier, Sun Xiu came, and I told him of the Perfect Person’s virtue. I feared he would be startled and thus fall into confusion.\" The disciples said, \"Not so. If Sun Xiu’s words were right and yours were wrong, he naturally could not be confused. If Sun Xiu’s words were wrong and yours were right, he was already confused when he came—what fault is yours?\"\n\nBianzi said, \"Not so. Long ago, a bird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Lord of Lu, delighted, prepared a grand feast to entertain it, performed the *Nine Shao* to delight it, yet the bird only grew anxious and sorrowful, its gaze uneasy, refusing to eat or drink. This is called nourishing a bird with what nourishes oneself. As for nourishing a bird with what nourishes a bird, one should let it roost in deep forests, float on rivers and lakes, feed on creeping things—then it would be at ease even on level ground. Now, Sun Xiu is a man of few words and scant learning. I told him of the Perfect Person’s virtue, which is like harnessing a field mouse to a chariot and horses, or delighting a sparrow with bells and drums. How could he not be startled?\"\n\nThe guest is shunned by his village—cast out by his own people. He makes a show of purity to distinguish himself from vulgar customs. He polishes his knowledge to startle the ignorant, cultivates himself to display his purity—all with the intent to seek fame and set himself apart. It is as if he brandishes the sun and moon to make his name known. He came already deluded; it was not I who deluded him. What fault is mine?\n\nSun Xiu is one of narrow apertures—his vision is small, his learning shallow. His understanding is inherently limited; when I speak to him of lofty things, how could he not be startled, doubtful, and self-deluded? This is meant to satirize the scholars of the time, whose vision is confined to the small and who remain ignorant of the great Dao.\n\n\"Feeding with *weiyi*\" means allowing him to eat in contentment—*weiyi* is self-contentment. The analogy of nourishing a bird has already appeared in the \"Perfect Joy\" chapter. In the \"External Chapters,\" \"Mountain Trees\" (Chapter Twenty), Zhuangzi was walking in the mountains when he saw a great tree with luxuriant branches and leaves. A woodcutter stood beside it but did not fell it. When asked why, he replied, \"It is of no use.\" Zhuangzi said, \"This tree, by being useless, has fulfilled its natural lifespan.\"\n\nZhuangzi left the mountain and lodged at the home of an old friend. The friend, delighted, ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, \"One can cackle, the other cannot. Which should we kill?\" The host said, \"Kill the one that cannot cackle.\"\n\nThe next day, a disciple asked Zhuangzi, \"Yesterday, the tree in the mountain, by being useless, fulfilled its natural lifespan. Now, the host’s goose, by being useless, has died. Master, where would you stand?\" Zhuangzi laughed and said, \"I would stand between the useful and the useless. Between the useful and the useless—it seems so, yet it is not. Thus, one cannot escape entanglement. But if one rides the Dao and virtue, drifting and roaming, it is otherwise: no praise, no blame, now a dragon, now a snake, transforming with the times, never clinging to one form. Ascending and descending, taking harmony as the measure, drifting and roaming...\"\n\nThe Ancestor of the Myriad Things gives form to all things yet is not itself formed by things—how then could it be entangled? This is the method of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.\n\nAs for the nature of the myriad things and the norms of human relations, it is otherwise: union leads to separation, completion to destruction, integrity to humiliation, honor to criticism, action to exhaustion, worthiness to scheming, and unworthiness to deceit. How can one cling to certainty? Alas!\n\nDisciples, take heed: is it not only in the realm of Dao and virtue? The preservation of one’s natural lifespan through uselessness has been spoken of many times before. Now, the goose is killed for its uselessness—this is another instance of the same principle. For both usefulness and uselessness still bear traces of form, and thus one cannot escape self-entanglement. Only when good and evil are both obliterated, when nothing can be named, is one’s natural lifespan truly preserved.\n\nTo ride the Dao and virtue is to follow nature. \"Now a dragon, now a snake\"—as Dongfang Shuo said, \"Used, it becomes a tiger; unused, it becomes a dike.\" Use and disuse follow the times; I harbor no fixed intent, thus there is no blame and no praise. To cling to one form is to have intent. To refuse to cling to any form is to be without intent. Ascending and descending, advancing and retreating—this is harmony and compliance.\n\nThe measure is the standard, the gauge is the rule—taking compliance with nature as the principle. Whether ascending or descending, all is permissible, for this is the ancestor of the myriad things, the origin of the myriad things. This is what Shennong and the Yellow Emperor were able to do, and thus it is called the model of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe sentiments of the myriad things are private sentiments; *xun* is habituation. The *xun* of human relationships, the *xun* of human conduct—this is habituation. The following several phrases exhaustively describe human sentiments: where there is union, there is separation—so it is said, \"In the world, no feast lasts forever.\" Where there is completion, there is destruction—it is said, \"Without ruin, how could there be flourishing?\" Those who expose their jade corners will inevitably bring about their own downfall; those who stand above others will inevitably be pointed at and criticized. Those who have intent in their affairs and seek fame will surely incur the resentment of others, for many delight in their success and rejoice in their failure.\n\nThe worthy, in considering how to preserve themselves, must engage in calculation, deliberation, and planning—thus it is said, \"The worthy scheme.\" The petty man, fearing loss, will stop at nothing, resorting to deceit and fraud—thus it is said, \"The unworthy deceive.\" In worldly affairs, nothing is within one’s control—how can one be certain? Thus it is said, \"How can one be certain?\" \"Alas!\" is an exclamation over the imperfection of worldly customs, the impermanence of human affairs, and the perilous dangers that inspire awe.\n\nThese words cut to the quick of human existence, and thus I urge my disciples to take heed and not forget: only by following nature can one avoid harm—thus it is said, \"Is it not only in the realm of Dao and virtue?\"\n\nMaster Shinan Yiliao saw the Duke of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. The master asked, \"Why does my lord appear troubled?\" The Duke of Lu replied, \"I have studied your Way and cultivated the legacy of my predecessors. I revere the spirits, honor the worthy, and act with filial devotion, never straying for even a moment—yet still I cannot escape misfortune. This is why I am troubled.\"\n\nMaster Shinan said, \"My lord’s method for eliminating misfortune is too shallow. The luxuriant fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in caves and grottoes—this is stillness. They move by night and rest by day—this is vigilance. Though hungry and thirsty, emaciated and distressed, they still keep their distance from the rivers and lakes, seeking food only when necessary—this is stability. Yet even so, they cannot escape the calamities of nets, traps, and snares. What crime have they committed? Their pelts are the cause of their disaster. Is the state of Lu not also my lord’s pelt? I wish for my lord to carve away his form, shed his pelt, cleanse his heart, and cast off his desires, then wander in the wilds where no one dwells. There, you will be at ease and secure.\"\n\n\"Residing in this manner, whether in use or non-use, one grasps the meaning of misfortune—it is not that misfortune should arise, yet one cannot escape it.\" *Quyue* means dwelling in seclusion; though living in deep obscurity, when hunger and thirst drive them to seek food on rivers and lakes, they still avoid others and keep their distance. This is what the ancients meant by \"lowering their heads to peck, raising them to survey all directions, dwelling in seclusion and venturing out sparingly.\" To be burdened by one’s pelt is to say that having fame and position in the world can invite disaster. These words strike deeply at the human heart—only those deeply immersed in worldly affairs can truly understand them.\n\nIn the southern lands of Yue, there is a city called the Land of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and unrefined, with few private desires. They know how to work but not how to hoard; they give without seeking repayment. They do not know where righteousness leads, nor where ritual conduct should go. Wild and unrestrained in their actions, they yet tread the great square. Their lives are joyful, and their deaths are fitting for burial. I wish for my lord to leave your state, abandon custom, and walk alongside the Dao.\n\nThe earlier reference to \"the wilds where no one dwells\" is the beginning of the formless. Here, it is further named the Land of Establishing Virtue. Observe how this hypothetical example is used—its origins lie in the Pure Land of later ages. During the Warring States period, the southern lands of Yue had not yet communicated with the Central States, so this place is named after them, without other significance. \"Knowing how to work but not how to hoard\" means they farm to feed themselves but do not store up private wealth. Without the names of ritual and righteousness, it is said, \"They do not know where righteousness leads, nor where ritual conduct should go.\" \"Wild and unrestrained in their actions\" means following the desires of the heart, all of which accord with the Dao—thus it is said, \"They tread the great square.\" \"Walking alongside the Dao\" means encouraging one another with a heart that admires the Dao, desiring to reach this land.\n\nThe Duke said, \"That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what can I do?\" Master Shinan said, \"My lord, do not be haughty in your form, do not linger in your dwelling—take this as your carriage.\" The Duke said, \"That Way is secluded and remote, with no people. With whom would I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how could I reach it?\" Master Shinan said, \"Reduce your lord’s expenses, lessen your lord’s desires. Though you have no provisions, you will find sufficiency. Cross the rivers and float on the sea—gazing at it, you will not see its shores; the farther you go, the more you will not know its end. Those who see you off will turn back from the shore, and you will be far from them.\"\n\n\"Not being haughty in your form\" means not clinging to your body; \"not lingering in your dwelling\" means not clinging to your state. If you can master this mindset, you can go—thus it is said, \"Take this as your carriage.\" With no desires in the heart, nothing will be lacking—thus it is said, \"Reduce expenses, lessen desires; though you have no provisions, you will find sufficiency.\" Crossing rivers and floating on the sea, gazing without seeing its shores, going farther without knowing its end—this is merely an elaboration of the phrase \"wandering boundlessly.\" Those who see you off all turn back from the shore, and you will be far from them. This phrase is most profound: for those who study the Dao, once they have awakened, what once aided their awakening—like those who see you off boarding a boat—will have all turned back by the time they reach the sea. Whether awakening through the sound of bamboo or the rolling up of a screen, these are all \"those who see you off.\" For example, seeing a sword dance may inspire excellence in cursive script—initially, the sword aids the awakening, but once awakened, the sword becomes the one who sees you off. Reading books is also a means of being seen off.\n\nThus, those who \"have others\" are burdened; those who are \"seen by others\" are troubled. Yao neither \"had others\" nor was \"seen by others.\" I wish to remove my lord’s burdens, dispel my lord’s troubles, and wander alone with the Dao in the boundless land. When a square boat crosses a river and an empty boat comes into collision, even a man of narrow mind would not grow angry. But if there were a person on that boat, he would shout to open or close the sail—if the first shout is unheard, he would shout again, and if still unheard, he would follow with angry words. Previously, he was not angry, but now he is; previously, the boat was empty, but now it is full.\n\nThose who can empty themselves and wander through the world—who could harm them? \"Having others\" means using the self to control things; \"being seen by others\" means being controlled by things. Neither accords with the natural Dao. Yao neither used the self to control things nor was controlled by things—thus it is said, \"Yao neither had others nor was seen by others.\" The \"boundless land\" is the vast and empty expanse, the wilds where no one dwells, the Land of Establishing Virtue. This concludes the previous chapter, and the meaning being sufficient, it is followed by an analogy.\n\nWhen two boats sail side by side—this is called \"parallel boats.\" If my boat is moving and is struck by an empty boat, since the empty boat has no one aboard, even if it strikes me, I do not grow angry. But if suddenly there is someone aboard that empty boat, I would shout at them to adjust their position—\"open\" meaning to push outward, \"close\" meaning to draw back. If they do not respond to the first shout, and still do not respond after the second, by the third shout, I would surely curse them. No one aboard means emptiness; someone aboard means fullness. Previously, there was no one, so I was not angry; now, there is someone, so I cannot help but grow angry—such is human nature. This analogy is most apt, for it illustrates that if I am without intent, I will naturally not clash with things. Wandering through this world with an empty heart—what harm could befall me?\n\nHere, a grand analogy is employed, and this concluding comparison exemplifies the method of structuring a text from beginning to end. *Liezi* contains a similar analogy:\n\nWhen Beigong She levied taxes for Duke Ling of Wei to cast bells, he set up an altar outside the outer gate of the capital, and in three months, the bells were completed, suspended in upper and lower tiers. Prince Qingji saw this and asked, \"What method did you employ?\" She replied, \"In the space of unity, I dared not impose anything. I have heard that once carving and polishing are done, one returns to simplicity. How innocent he appears, how carefree! How uncertain, how vague! He sees off those departing and welcomes those arriving—arrivals are not forbidden, departures are not hindered. He follows the strong and the unyielding, adapts to the crooked, and aids them in exhausting themselves. Thus, though taxes are levied day and night, not a hair is harmed—how much more so for those on the great path?\"\n\nTo gather the people’s wealth to cast bells, one first offers sacrifices and then begins the casting—hence it is said, \"he set up an altar.\" In three months, the bells were completed. Bells have frames for suspension, and since the frames have two tiers, it is called \"upper and lower suspension.\" This refers to a set of chimes.\n\n\"What method did you employ?\" means, \"What technique allowed you to complete this so swiftly?\" \"Unity\" means singularity. Following the principle of nature, beginning and end remain purely one, without any admixture—hence it is said, \"In the space of unity, I dared not impose anything,\" meaning nothing else could be inserted here.\n\n\"Once carving and polishing are done, one returns to simplicity\" means removing the sharp edges to return to naturalness. \"How innocent he appears\" describes a state of no knowledge. \"How carefree!\"\n\nIf slack, if hesitant—this is the state of having no room for intention. Sometimes coming, sometimes going, neither leading nor following—hence it is said, \"gathered yet scattered, boundless yet formless.\" \"Gathered\" conveys the sense of a clod of earth; \"boundless\" describes the state of nothingness. Those who come are not barred; those who go are not stopped—this means following nature’s course without welcoming or sending off.\n\nThe strong and unyielding depart, while those who bend and cling seek to attach themselves to me; I follow and yield to them all, letting them be as they are. \"Self-exhausting\" means coming of its own accord. Whether compliant or contrary, in the end, nothing is sought, yet all arrives naturally—hence it is said, \"following its self-exhaustion.\" Though I levy and gather, not a single hair of the people is harmed—thus, \"not a hair is damaged.\" The \"great path\" refers to matters that proceed smoothly and without obstruction; simply handle them with a mind devoid of intention, and they are swiftly accomplished.\n\nConfucius was besieged between Chen and Cai for seven days without cooked food. Taigong Ren went to console him, saying, \"You nearly died, did you not?\" Confucius replied, \"Yes.\" \"Do you detest death?\" \"Yes.\" Ren said, \"I once spoke of the way to avoid death. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called *Yidai*. As a bird, it flies weakly and feebly, as if incapable. When taking flight, it relies on others to lead; when perching, it is pressed and constrained. It dares not advance first nor retreat last; in feeding, it dares not taste first but must take the leavings. For this reason, it is never singled out in formation, and others ultimately cannot harm it—thus it escapes misfortune. The straight tree is the first felled; the sweet well is the first drained. You, sir, cultivate knowledge to startle the foolish, refine your conduct to expose the tainted—shining brightly as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride, how could you avoid peril? Long ago, I heard from a man of great completion: 'Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit; those who achieve merit ruin their names; those who attain fame stumble. Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common? The Dao flows yet remains obscure; one attains it yet is unrecognized; one acts yet is unnamed.' Pure and constant, one is likened to the mad—erasing traces, discarding influence, and not pursuing merit or fame. Thus, no one can reproach him, nor does he reproach others. The perfected man remains unknown—why should you rejoice?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Excellent!\" He then parted from his acquaintances, dismissed his disciples, and fled to the great marshlands. Dressed in coarse cloth, feeding on acorns and chestnuts, he entered among beasts without disturbing their herds, among birds without disrupting their flocks. Neither birds nor beasts shunned him—how much less would men? \"Do you detest death?\" means: in such dire straits, does your heart also loathe them? \"The way to avoid death\" refers to self-contentment free from calamity.\n\n*Yidai* is today’s swallow. *Fenfen-zhizhi* describes its manner of flight. \"Drawing support\" means flying in flocks. \"Pressed and constrained in perching\" means nesting near humans. \"Daring not advance first nor retreat last\" means it does not contend in coming and going. *Xu* means leavings—taking insects that others have discarded. \"Not singled out\" means it is not numerous.\n\nThough they form ranks, they are not as numerous as the flocks of crows and geese. Each relies on human households, yet others do not harm them—this is the metaphor of the straight tree and the sweet well, which become known by their very nature.\n\nThe *Greatly Accomplished* is one who embodies the great Dao, a scholar of the Way. Those who boast and claim merit will never succeed; those who delight in fame and achievement will ultimately harm themselves. *Huikui*—all self-inflicted damage. \"Returning to speak with the multitude\" means withdrawing to be as one with them. Moving in accord with the Dao, one remains dim and self-effacing. Thus it is said: the flow of the Dao is not manifest. Though one may act according to one’s will in the moment, one does not exalt oneself through fame. Thus it is said: when dwelling in what is fitting, one acts without claiming a place; when not dwelling in what is fitting, one does not possess it. *Chunchun* and *changchang* are one and the same—comparable to madness, as if without mind. Erasing one’s traces, relinquishing power, and setting aside thoughts of merit and fame—this is transformation without leaving a mark. I do not reproach others, and others forget me: such is the *Perfect Person*. If the Perfect Person desires no renown in the world, why should you, Master, rejoice in fame?\n\nThe final lines echo the passage where \"eating pork is like eating human flesh,\" borrowing Confucius’s name to expound the teaching—this is reiteration for emphasis.\n\nConfucius asked Zisang Hu, \"I was twice exiled from Lu, had my tree felled in Song, erased my traces in Wei, and was impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged between Chen and Cai. Having endured these many hardships, my close associates grew more distant, and my disciples and friends scattered. Why is this?\"\n\nZisang Hu replied, \"Have you not heard of the man of Jia who fled? Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a newborn child and flee. Someone asked, 'Was it for the sake of its value? The child’s value is slight. Was it for the sake of its burden? The child’s burden is great. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a child and flee?' Lin Hui said, 'The jade was bound by profit; the child was bound by Heaven. Those bound by profit abandon one another in straits, calamity, and harm. Those bound by Heaven gather together in straits, calamity, and harm. The difference between gathering and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water; the friendship of the petty is as sweet as sweet wine. The noble are bland yet intimate; the petty are sweet yet easily severed. Those who unite without cause will part without cause.'\"\n\nConfucius said, \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\" He walked slowly and wandered home, abandoned his learning, discarded his books, and his disciples no longer bowed before him, yet their affection for him deepened.\n\n*Zisang Hu* is *Hu* (door). *Jiaren* refers to a man of a fictitious state. Abandoning the jade and carrying the child is the finest metaphor: those bound by Heaven must always gather, while those bound by profit must abandon one another. The friendship of the noble is bland yet intimate; the friendship of the petty is sweet yet easily severed—this exhausts the human condition. Though these words are spoken of others, Mencius also said, \"Those who unite without cause will part without cause,\" as seen in the *Odes of Bin*. This line is another fine thread of coherence. \"No longer bowing before him\" means not being constrained by the formalities of bowing in his presence, yet their mutual affection grew deeper.\n\nAnother day, Zisang Hu said, \"When Shun was about to die, he truly admonished Yu, saying, 'Be vigilant! In form, nothing surpasses following; in emotion, nothing surpasses compliance. Following, one does not depart; complying, one does not labor. Not departing, not laboring—then one does not seek adornment to match form. Not seeking adornment to match form—then one does not depend on external things.'\"\n\n*Ling* (clear) is pronounced *ling* (to understand). He instructed Yu with the true and real Dao, hence \"truly admonished.\" *Yuan* means to follow its natural course; *shuai* means to comply with its natural tendency. Not departing is to be one with the Dao. *Xing* (form) is the self; *wen* (adornment) is what is external to the self. Not using what is external to adorn the self—thus it is said, \"one does not seek adornment to match form.\" Today, when people host guests, they say \"to await guests\"—this is the meaning of *dai* (to await). Not using external adornments means having no need for things. Thus it is said, \"one fundamentally does not depend on things.\" This *dai* (to await) is the sense of \"not using.\" The three instances of *dai* take on two meanings.\n\nZhuangzi wore a robe of coarse cloth patched with hemp, tied his shoes with cords, and passed by the King of Wei. The king said, \"Why is the Master so weary?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"It is poverty, not weariness. When a scholar possesses the Dao and virtue but cannot put them into practice, this is weariness. Wearing tattered clothes and threadbare shoes is poverty, not weariness. This is what is called 'not encountering the right time.' Have you alone not seen the gibbon? When it obtains *nan*, *zi*, *yu*, and *zhang* trees, it grasps the vines, swings through the branches, and reigns supreme among them—even Yi or Peng Meng could not take aim at it. Yet when it finds itself among thorny *zhe*, *ji*, *zhi*, and *gou* trees, it moves cautiously, glances warily, trembles and quakes. Not that its sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened and lost their suppleness, but the circumstances are unfavorable, and it cannot display its abilities. Now, dwelling among dark rulers and chaotic ministers, how could one not be weary? This is like the heart of Bi Gan being carved out—clear proof!\"\n\n*Dabu* is coarse cloth; *zheng* (to tie) is a belt. *Kuai* (to fasten) is tied in a knot at the waist. *Xilü* means the shoes are worn out and strung together with cords. *Bei* means affliction. *Lan* means to grasp; *man* means to entwine. These two words describe the gibbon in the trees—it is not careless. *Wangchang* means its spirit is exuberant and its will fulfilled. *Zhe*, *ji*, *zhi*, and *gou* are thorny trees. *Zhendong* means fear; *daoli* means trembling. The phrase \"not supple\" is preceded by \"suddenly stiffened\"—this is excellent. Medical texts describe a condition of stiff neck and back, which is stiffened and not supple. Using this to describe the gibbon is especially vivid. *Zheng* (proof) means to compare Bi Gan’s case to show its verification—these three words are also striking.\n\nConfucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooking a meal. Leaning on a withered tree with his left hand and striking its withered branches with his right, he sang the airs of the *Yan* clan. There was the form of the song but not its meter, the sound but not the tones of gong and jue. The sound of wood and the sound of man blended harmoniously, resonating deeply in the hearts of others. Yan Hui stood with hands clasped and turned his gaze to observe. Fearing that Hui would exalt him and thereby reach excess, or love him and thereby reach sorrow, Confucius said, \"Hui, it is easy not to suffer the harm of Heaven, but difficult not to benefit from men. Nothing begins that does not end. Man and Heaven are one. Who is it that sings now?\"\n\n*Gaomu* is a withered tree; *gaozhi* is a withered branch, as in the *Qiwulun* (\"The Equality of Things\"), where it is called *fangzhi*. Striking the withered branch against the withered tree—thus it is said, \"there was the form.\" Though he struck, there was no rhythm, hence \"not its meter.\" Without gong and jue, it means not conforming to the five tones. The sound of wood is the striking; the sound of man is the singing. *Liran* means precise and fitting. *Guangji* means to honor me. If one seeks from the intention of honoring me, what is reached has no bounds—thus it is said, \"fearing that he would exalt me and thereby reach excess.\" If one ponders from the intention of loving me, it must lead to sorrow—thus it is said, \"loving me and thereby reaching sorrow.\" *Zao* is pronounced *cuo*. \"Man and Heaven are one\" means that what is in me is all Heavenly principle. The singer now is not me—thus it is said, \"Who is it?\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"May I ask how to remain untouched by Heaven’s diminishment?\"\nConfucius replied, \"Hunger and thirst, cold and heat, constraints and blockages—these are the movements of Heaven and Earth, the outflow of the turning of things. To speak of going along with them is what is meant. As a minister, one does not dare abandon them; holding to the Dao of the minister is already thus—how much more so for how one awaits Heaven? What is meant by remaining untouched by man’s augmentation is difficult?\"\nConfucius replied, \"At first, one’s path opens in four directions; ranks and emoluments arrive together without end—what things deem beneficial is not one’s own. My mandate lies in what is external. The noble man does not act as a thief; the worthy does not act as a bandit. If I were to take these, what would I do? Thus it is said: No bird is wiser than the swallow. What its eyes deem unsuitable, it does not even glance at; though the fruit falls before it, it abandons it and flees—such is its awe. Yet it nests among men, and the altars of state endure. What do you mean by ‘there is no beginning that is not an end’?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The myriad things transform, yet one does not know who succeeds them. One knows where they end; one knows where they begin—simply align with them and await them, that is all. What is meant by ‘man and Heaven are one’?\"\nConfucius replied, \"There is man, and there is Heaven; there is also Heaven alone. That man cannot possess Heaven’s nature—this is why the sage calmly embodies the passing and comes to rest. *Tian sun* means adversity in time; *wu shou* means poverty yet joy. *Ren yi* means the conferral of wealth and honor; *wu shou* means wealth and honor without excess. Ordinary discourse holds that remaining unexcessive amid wealth and honor is easy, while finding joy in poverty is difficult. Yet Zhuangzi reverses this—how profoundly meaningful! In times of Heaven’s diminishment, affairs do not proceed by one’s will. Though one may wish not to receive, how can one not receive? One cannot but endure poverty. Thus it is said to be easy. As for man’s augmentation, as wealth arrives daily and rank rises daily, increasing month by month, I wish to decline yet cannot. Thus honor does not await arrogance to become arrogant; wealth does not await extravagance to become extravagant. Thus it is said to be difficult. *Qiong zhi* means blockage and obstruction; *bu xing* means one cannot push them away. *Yun wu* means the turning of qi.\"\n\nRelease and dispersion—this is the outflow of the turning of things, the coming and going of the numerical cycles of qi, which is Heaven’s doing. I too move in concert with it, and thus too am released with it. Hence it is said, \"to depart together,\" which is precisely what is meant by \"moving in step with the times\" and \"reaching the limit together with the times.\" The lord’s command to his minister cannot be disobeyed—how then can man disobey the command of Heaven? This is the meaning of \"ease in receiving nothing.\"\n\n\"Fourfold reach\" means that wherever the mind turns, there is no obstruction. \"First use\" means that as soon as this mind stirs, affairs follow and gather without obstruction. \"Arriving together without exhaustion\" and \"converging without cease\" describe this. I do not seek the profit of things, yet profit comes of itself—hence it is said, \"not of oneself.\" Rank and emolument both come from without, brought about by the timing of fate. Thus it is said, \"My fate lies outside myself.\" A gentleman feels shame at receiving emolument without merit, regarding it as theft. Though I may wish not to accept it, there is that which cannot be pushed away. When Gongsun He was appointed minister, he wept—was this not a case of one who could not receive, finding the augmentation of man difficult?\n\nThe *yiyi* is indolence of intent. \"Insufficient to regard\" means not worth looking at. A place not fitting for one’s dwelling—though the eye may see it, one still dismisses it as unworthy of regard and departs. When the fruit falls, the bird must take flight in alarm, fearing harm to itself. Thus it is said, \"Abandoning it, it flees.\" Though its intent is to avoid man, it ends up dwelling near him—hence it is said, \"nesting among men,\" meaning it enters their midst. The altars of soil and grain, though nothing to fear, are also nothing to take; people respect and preserve them. The swallow in a household, though neither beneficial nor harmful, is still tolerated. This suggests that if one in wealth and honor could be like the *yiyi*—neither beneficial nor harmful—then none would revile or despise him. Yet once called wealthy and honored, how can one be without benefit or harm? Hence it is said to be difficult.\n\n\"Without beginning yet not without end\" means one knows neither its start nor its finish. The transformations of the ten thousand things succeed one another in turn—who knows their end, who knows their beginning? One simply abides in the center and awaits them. This is the true mean, dwelling within the workings of creation.\n\nWhat does it mean to say \"man and Heaven are one\"? Man is what Heaven produces—hence it is said, \"There is man, and there is Heaven.\" Heaven too is what creation makes—hence it is said, \"There is Heaven, and there is Heaven.\" Nature is the nature mandated by Heaven. This character *xing* (nature) is the same as *sheng* (life): what man’s nature and life possess from birth are all received from Heaven. How could man presume to interfere? The sage alone knows what man cannot possess, and thus abides in it with equanimity, exhausting his years to the full. Mencius said, \"This is nature, yet there is fate in it. The gentleman does not call it nature\"—meaning precisely that man cannot possess Heaven’s nature.\n\n\"Composed and at ease\"—this is to dwell in accord with the times and follow their course to the end of one’s days. Hence it is said, \"embodying the passing and coming to an end.\"\n\nZhuang Zhou was wandering in the thicket of Diaoling when he saw an unusual magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet, its eyes measured an inch across, and it brushed past Zhou’s forehead before alighting in the chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said, \"What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it does not fly far, its eyes are large yet it does not see clearly.\" He hitched up his robe, strode forward, took up his sling, and waited. He saw a cicada that had just found a fine shade and forgotten itself; a mantis, seizing the opportunity, grabbed it, forgetting its own form in its eagerness. The strange magpie, seeing its advantage, swooped in for the gain, forgetting its true nature in pursuit of profit. Zhuang Zhou shuddered and said, \"Ah! Things indeed entrap one another—two creatures summoning disaster upon themselves.\" He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the gamekeeper pursued him with curses.\n\nZhuang Zhou returned home and for three months did not emerge into the courtyard. Lin Qie asked him, \"Master, why have you been so withdrawn of late?\" Zhuang Zhou replied, \"I guarded my form yet forgot myself. I gazed into muddy water and became lost in clear depths. Moreover, I have heard from the Master that one should enter a custom and follow it. Now I wandered in Diaoling and forgot myself; the strange magpie brushed my forehead, and I wandered in the chestnut grove, forgetting my true nature. The gamekeeper of the chestnut grove took me for a thief—I am thus withdrawn.\" Diaoling is a place name; *fan* refers to the garden’s fence. \"Brushed Zhou’s forehead\" means it flew past his brow. *Yin* means vast; *shi* means to depart.\n\nThe wings were vast yet could not advance; the eyes were large yet could not see—such was the state of being led astray by things while pursuing them. Holding the sling and lingering, he sought to seize the prey. The mantis, intent on the cicada, was so fixated on gaining it that it forgot its own form; the strange magpie, in turn, coveted the mantis and forgot its true nature. Thus arose the state of neither advancing nor seeing. Mantis and magpie, though of different kinds, summoned one another—both forgot their form, forgot their true nature, and so became entangled.\n\nThe gamekeeper, guardian of the garden, cursed and berated him. *Not emerging into the courtyard* means not stepping into the open space before one’s dwelling. To *guard the form* is to cultivate life. I, who study the cultivation of life, carelessly pursued the magpie and forgot myself—this is to be led by desire and thus drowned in delusion. *Muddy water* is a metaphor for human desire; *clear depths* for the heavenly principle. The *Master* is Laozi. *Entering a state and inquiring into its customs* means learning its prohibitions—thus it is said, \"Enter its custom and follow its custom.\" Another’s garden, into which I mistakenly wandered, is a transgression of the prohibition. *Took me for a thief* means I was humiliated by the gamekeeper.\n\nThis is but an allegory: whether great or small, all things that are pursued lead to delusion—this is a maxim for the scholar’s practice.\n\nYangzi lodged at an inn in Song. The innkeeper had two concubines—one beautiful, the other plain. The plain one was favored, while the beautiful one was slighted. Yangzi asked the reason, and the innkeeper’s servant replied: “The beautiful one is beautiful in her own eyes, but I see no beauty in her. The plain one is plain in her own eyes, but I see no plainness in her.”\n\nYangzi said: “Disciples, take note: act with virtue and abandon self-regard. Wherever you go, who will not love you? The beautiful one, in her self-regard, is proud and boastful. The plain one, in her self-deprecation, humbly considers herself unworthy. To *act with virtue and abandon self-regard* means to possess the power of the worthy without the conduct of self-importance—then, wherever you go, all will delight in you.”\n\nThis passage, too, offers an intimate lesson for practice. Reading these several chapters, one might wonder if the “Outer Chapters” were truly not composed by Zhuangzi.\n\nYangzi Fang sat in attendance upon Marquis Wen of Wei, and several times praised Xi Gong. The marquis said: “Is Xi Gong your teacher?” Yangzi Fang replied: “No. He is a villager from my hometown. He often speaks of the Dao, and his words are apt, so I praise him.”\n\nThe marquis said: “Then have you no teacher?” Yangzi Fang said: “I do.” The marquis asked: “Who is your teacher?” Yangzi Fang said: “Dongguo Shunzi.” The marquis said: “Then why have you never praised him?” Yangzi Fang said: “His way of being is that of a true person: his appearance is human, yet his nature is of Heaven; he is empty and follows things, preserving his authenticity; he is pure and accommodates all. When others act without the Dao, he merely adjusts his countenance to awaken them, and their misguided intentions dissolve. How could one such as Xi Gong be worthy of praise?”\n\nYangzi Fang departed. The marquis, lost in thought, remained silent the entire day. He summoned his attendant minister and said to him: “How distant is the gentleman of perfect virtue! At first, I believed that the words of sagely wisdom and the conduct of benevolence and righteousness were the ultimate. But when I heard of Yangzi Fang’s teacher, my form dissolved, and I had no desire to move; my mouth was sealed, and I had no desire to speak. What I have learned is but a clod of earth—how the state of Wei has truly become a burden to me!”\n\nWhen Wenbo Xuezi traveled to Qi, he lodged in Lu. A man of Lu requested an audience with him. Wenbo Xuezi said: “It will not do. I have heard that the gentlemen of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. I do not wish to meet them.”\n\nWhen he returned to Qi and again lodged in Lu, that same man requested another audience. Wenbo Xuezi said: “In the past, he sought to see me; now, he seeks to see me again—he must have something to invigorate me.” He went out to meet the guest and, upon returning, sighed. The next day, he met the guest again and, upon returning, sighed once more. His servant asked: “Every time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why is that?” He replied: “I already told you: the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. Those who came to see me before moved with the precision of compass and square, their demeanor now like a dragon, now like a tiger. Their admonitions were as a son’s, their guidance as a father’s—this is why I sighed.”\n\nConfucius met him but did not speak. Zilu said: “You have long wished to see Wenbo Xuezi. Now that you have met him, why do you not speak?” Confucius replied: “In such a man, the Way is present the moment one’s gaze falls upon him—there is no need for words.”\n\n*Bo* was his given name, and *Xuezi* his courtesy name. Ritual and righteousness are the studies of deliberate action; to be coarse in understanding the human heart is to be deficient, meaning one fails to recognize the fundamental mind. *To invigorate* means to bestow virtue, implying he must have something beneficial to offer. *Moved with the precision of compass and square* describes conduct that accords with ritual propriety in every motion. *Compass and square* signify regulated standards. *Now like a dragon, now like a tiger* refers to the manifestation of patterned excellence—this is what is meant by *the great man’s transformation like a tiger’s*. *Admonitions as a son’s, guidance as a father’s* describes speaking deeply despite a shallow acquaintance. *The Way is present the moment one’s gaze falls upon him* echoes the earlier idea of *correcting one’s demeanor to enlighten others, causing their misgivings to dissolve of themselves*. *No need for words* means no need for verbal expression.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: “When you walk, I walk; when you hasten, I hasten; when you run, I run. Yet when you gallop, leaving all dust behind, I can only stare blankly from afar.”\n\nConfucius said: “What do you mean, Hui?”\n\nYan Yuan replied: “When you walk, I walk; when you speak, I speak; when you hasten, I hasten; when you debate, I debate; when you gallop, I gallop; when you discourse on the Way, I too discourse on the Way. Yet when you gallop, leaving all dust behind, I can only stare blankly from afar. For you, *without speaking you are trusted, without intimacy you are all-encompassing, without implements the people are equipped*—yet I remain ignorant of how this comes to be.”\n\nConfucius said: “How could one not examine this? The greatest sorrow is nothing other than the death of the heart, and the death of the person is secondary to it. The sun rises in the east and sets in the westernmost reaches—nothing in the myriad things does not follow this pattern. All that have eyes and limbs depend upon it to accomplish their ends. When it emerges, they exist; when it sets, they perish. The myriad things are thus: they depend upon it. Death, too, depends upon it, as does life. Once I received this completed form, I did not transform but awaited its end, moving in response to things, active day and night without pause, yet unaware of where it would conclude. Vaporously, this form took shape. Knowing fate, I could not plan for what lay ahead. Now, with each passing day, I draw nearer to my end. To have walked alongside you for a lifetime, only to lose you in the span of an arm’s length—how could this not be sorrowful? You are on the verge of illumination. What I have illuminated—it has already come to its end.”\n\nYet your seeking treats it as something existent—this is like searching for a horse in a roadside market. I submit to you utterly, and you forget utterly what I submit. Yet why should you fret? Though forgotten, there remains within me what cannot be forgotten. Without comparison, it naturally pervades all; words need not rely on close affinity for its truth to spread in perfect harmony. What has no form cannot be traced by name. The people tread forward—words alone draw them to return.\n\nBy this, one measures the Master’s unattainability. “Yet unaware of why it is so”—these words mean I have reached a point where I no longer know how it is. Galloping, flying, racing—leaving dust behind in such swift departure that no trace remains. Staring with wide eyes—all who walk, hasten, or race use the horse as their metaphor.\n\n“How could one not examine this?” means one must scrutinize it with precision. “The death of the heart” means seeing nothing. To live yet see nothing is worse than death. Thus it is said: “No sorrow is greater than the death of the heart, and the death of a person is secondary to it.”\n\n“Can be measured”—when the sun is bright, the length and size of all things can be fully seen. Thus it is said: “None do not follow this pattern.” Rising in the east and setting in the west—from dawn to dusk. Creatures with eyes and limbs—all living things—must see the sun before their affairs can proceed. They depend on it, depend on the sun. Thus it is said: “They depend upon it to accomplish their ends.” When it emerges, they exist; when it sets, they perish. Human affairs rise and fall with the sun’s movement—rising to work at sunrise, resting at sunset. The myriad things’ dependence on the Dao is like human affairs’ dependence on the sun. Thus it is said: “The myriad things are thus.” Life and death both follow the Dao’s natural course. Thus it is said: “Death, too, depends upon it, as does life.”\n\nOnce born and receiving this form, the Dao abides within the body without change, awaiting its end. Thus it is said: “Once I received this completed form, I did not transform but awaited its end.” To “effect” means to imitate. To act in imitation of things without allowing the heart to interfere. Thus it is said: “Moving in response to things.” “Without pause” means without interruption. “Unaware of where it would conclude” means without end. Harmoniously, this body embodies nothing but the principle of compliance. Thus it is said: “Vaporously, this form took shape.” Though knowing all things are fated, in daily life one does not use fate as a measure—this is what is meant by “the sage does not speak of fate.” “With each passing day” means each day is like this, advancing together without cease. “To have walked alongside you for a lifetime” means standing side by side. Having accompanied you all my life, yet you have not attained this Dao. Thus it is said: “Only to lose you in the span of an arm’s length.”\n\n“Illumination” refers to what is visible. You see only what I make visible, unaware of what remains unseen. Thus it is said: “You are on the verge of illumination.” “What I have illuminated”—exhaustion means nothingness. The Dao must reach nothingness before it is complete. You seek it as something existent, so you cannot see its completion. Thus it is said: “What I have illuminated—it has already come to its end.”\n\n“Yet your seeking treats it as something existent”—a market is a place for selling horses. “Tang” refers to a roofless structure, as in the *Book of Songs*: “In the central hall, there are tiles.” Today, it would be called a roadside pavilion. Those who sell horses come and go unpredictably; to seek one in such a market is like carving a mark on a boat to find a lost sword.\n\n“Forgetting” means beyond knowing. “Utterly forgotten” means reaching the limit of the unknowable. What I submit to you must reach the limit of the unknowable, and what you submit to me must also reach the limit of the unknowable. Thus it is said: “I submit to you utterly, and you forget utterly what I submit.” This means that this matter cannot be explained to you, nor can you explain it to me—it must reach the point of forgetting words before it is complete.\n\nYet, turning further: though you have not yet reached this point, why should you worry? Since you now know the one who gallops away leaving no dust, staring in astonishment, you have grasped one layer of understanding, though not yet the whole. If you can forget what you once knew, even if my present state differs from what you see today, what remains unforgotten within me endures. As the Buddhists say: “After awakening, one still relies on what was known before.” Some believe that only when one sees nothingness is the Dao complete, yet this “nothingness” is still a kind of “something.” Thus it is said: “Though forgotten, there remains within me what cannot be forgotten.”\n\nThese two instances of “I” refer to Yan Hui’s own experience, differing from the earlier “I submit to you” and “you forget what I submit.” Confucius visited Lao Dan, who had just washed his hair and was letting it dry, sitting solemnly as if not human. Confucius withdrew and waited. After a while, he saw Lao Dan and said: “Was I deluded, or is it true? Just now, Master, your form was withered like dry wood, as if you had left the world of men and stood in solitude.”\n\nLao Dan said: “I let my heart wander in the beginning of things.”\nConfucius said: “What do you mean?”\nLao Dan replied: “My heart is blocked and cannot know; my mouth is shut and cannot speak. Let me try to explain it to you.”\n\nThe most yin arrives with solemn stillness; the most yang blazes with radiant brilliance. This solemn stillness emerges from Heaven; this radiant brilliance arises from Earth. When the two intermingle and harmonize, things come into being. Some call this their governing principle, yet none see its form—its ebb and flow fill emptiness and fullness, its darkening and brightening alternate like day and night. Things transform daily, yet none see its work. Life has its sprouting; death has its return. Beginning and end stand opposed, yet without origin, and none know where it ends. If not this, then what is its source?\n\nLetting the hair loose to dry—this is what *Li Sao* calls \"drying the hair.\" *Zhire* describes the stillness of standing in concentration, as if not human, still unpaired with others. *Juewu* means rigid and unmoving. *Yiwu* means leaving external things behind; *liren* means leaving the crowd of people; standing in solitude means rising above the world’s common measure.\n\n\"The beginning of things\" refers to the origin before things existed. *Pi* means closed—when the heart knows nothing, the mouth desires no speech, hence \"blocked\" and \"shut.\" \"Near\" means approaching, for the profound and wondrous are hard to express, so one can only approximate their semblance. Thus it is said: \"Let me try to explain it to you.\" The earlier \"its\" and \"its wind\" refer to this transformation of phrasing.\n\nSolemn stillness and radiant brilliance—these are the meanings of yin and yang, which is what is called the Dao. Thus, the four lines below: when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born. They intermingle and interact, for yin alone cannot generate, nor yang alone complete—hence \"intermingle and harmonize.\" *Ji* means the guiding thread, the principal support, as if something governs yet remains unseen. Thus: \"Some call this their governing principle, yet none see its form.\" The one who governs is the work of creation.\n\nOne darkening, one brightening—these are day and night. The ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness—these are the movements of the four seasons. Things change daily, yet none see its work. Each day it acts thus, and the work of creation—who can name it? Beginning and end are not the same, yet their origin cannot be traced. For example, the sparrow transforming into a clam: the sparrow’s end is the clam’s beginning, and the clam’s beginning is the sparrow’s end. Even in the grand succession of emperors, it is the same. How can one see it all? Thus: \"Beginning and end stand opposed, yet without origin, and none know where it ends.\" This clearly speaks of the Creator, yet without naming it, it then says: \"If not this, then what is its source?\" The source is the Creator; the source is also the Creator. It says: \"If not this, then what is its master?\" This is how Zhuangzi’s writing lives—every sentence is like this.\n\nConfucius said: \"May I ask about this wandering?\"\nLao Dan said: \"To attain this is the utmost beauty, the utmost joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy—this is called the Perfect Person.\"\nConfucius said: \"I wish to hear the method.\"\nLao Dan said: \"Beasts that eat grass do not dislike changing marshes; creatures that live in water do not dislike changing streams. They undergo small changes but do not lose their great constancy. Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness do not enter their breasts. For the world is where the myriad things are one. To grasp this oneness and be the same as it—then the four limbs and hundred bones become dust and dirt, and life and death, beginning and end become like day and night, which cannot disturb it. How much less can the distinctions of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune? One who discards rank is like one who discards mud and dirt, knowing the body is nobler than rank. Nobility lies within me and does not lose itself in change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have no end—how could they trouble the heart of one who has attained the Dao?\n\nThis is the praise of the utmost beauty and joy of the Dao. \"Do not dislike\" means not being weary. \"Small changes\" refers to changing marshes and streams. \"Not losing their great constancy\" means their water and grass remain. The life of the myriad things all lies under Heaven, so one must follow Heaven’s doing—how can one be different? Thus: \"The world is where the myriad things are one.\" Knowing this oneness comes from Heaven and is no different, then not even life and death can disturb the heart—how much less gain and loss, fortune and misfortune? *Jie* means a splinter or obstacle. *Dian* means a servant or subordinate.\n\nThe servant discards and comes as one discards mud and mire—because I am noble while they are base. Yet if one knows that the true nobility of the Dao lies within oneself, how could the transformations of the myriad things ever strip away one’s utmost beauty and joy? Between Heaven and Earth, change follows upon change, and so it has been for ten thousand ages—when will it ever end? Gain and loss, fortune and misfortune are nothing but the natural course—how could they trouble the heart? Thus it is said: \"The myriad transformations have no end.\" Who, then, could disturb the heart? Only those who unite their person with the Dao can truly understand this.\n\nThis is the self—when the self and the Dao are one, it is called \"the self attaining the Dao.\" Confucius said: \"The Master’s virtue matched Heaven and Earth, yet he still relied on profound words to cultivate his heart—how could the noble men of old have been free of this?\" Lao Dan replied: \"Not so. Water, when drawn, does nothing yet its nature is spontaneous. The perfected person’s virtue requires no cultivation, yet things cannot depart from it. Just as Heaven is naturally high, Earth naturally thick, and the sun and moon naturally bright—what need is there for cultivation?\" Confucius went out and told Yan Hui: \"My grasp of the Dao is like a gnat in vinegar—how slight the Master’s words have revealed to me! I did not know the great wholeness of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\n*Jiajie* means to borrow. *Zhiyan* refers to the many words above. It means that even Laozi, with such virtue, could not depart from words to cultivate his heart—how could others escape this? *Shuo* means to be free, the same as *tuo*. Lao Dan’s \"Not so\" means that relying on words to cultivate the heart is mistaken. *Zhuo* means to draw, the same as *zhuo*. The rivers and seas can be drawn from endlessly because their essence is effortless and natural. *Cai* means nature—water is water because of its natural essence. The perfected person’s virtue is rooted in spontaneity; though it requires no cultivation, external things cannot separate from it. Heaven, Earth, the sun, and moon are also natural—what room is there for effort? Thus it is said: \"What need is there for cultivation?\" *Ximei* are midges in vinegar, confined within the jar—how could they know the vastness beyond? This speaks of narrow vision.\n\nZhuangzi saw Duke Ai of Lu. The Duke said: \"Lu has many Ru scholars but few who follow your *fang*.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Lu has few Ru.\" The Duke said: \"The whole state of Lu wears Ru robes—how can you say there are few?\" Zhuangzi said: \"I have heard that the Ru wear round caps to know the seasons, square shoes to know the earth’s forms, and jade pendants that move slowly to decide matters when they arise. Those who possess the Dao are not necessarily known by their robes, and those who wear the robes do not necessarily know the Dao. If you truly do not believe me, why not issue a decree throughout the state: 'Those without this Dao who wear these robes will be put to death'?\" The Duke issued the decree, and after five days, no one in Lu dared wear Ru robes. Only one man, dressed as a Ru, stood at the palace gate. The Duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs, and his answers were inexhaustible, shifting through a thousand turns without end. Zhuangzi said: \"With only one Ru in Lu, can you call that many?\"\n\n*Fang* refers to methods—it means the Ru of Lu practiced different arts from the Master. *Huan pei jue* means their movements were slow and they wore jade pendants. *Jue* takes its meaning from decisiveness. *One husband* refers to Confucius. The implication is that many wear Ru robes but do not know the Dao.\n\nBaili Xi’s rank and salary did not enter his heart, so he fed cattle and made them fat. This caused Duke Mu of Qin to forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance. The Lord of Yu disregarded life and death, so he could move others. When feeding cattle, did he have any thought of seeking rank or salary? It was precisely because he did not seek them that he was employed by Duke Mu. *Moving others* means influencing and transforming them. *Disregarding life and death* means acting without acting, the heart undisturbed. Here, these two lines are spoken casually.\n\nWhen the Lord of Song was about to have a painting made, all the artists arrived, bowed, and stood ready. Half of them were outside preparing brushes and ink. One artist arrived late, unhurried, did not bow, and did not stand still. He was given lodging, and when the Lord sent someone to observe him, he was found sitting with his clothes off, legs sprawled. The Lord said: \"He is the true painter.\"\n\n*Chanchán* means leisurely and at ease. *Receiving the bow without standing* means he returned the bow but did not remain still. *Panbo* describes sitting with legs spread. *Luo* means bare. This speaks of having no mind for seeking recognition—only then is one a true painter. Su Dongpo’s description of painting bamboo—\"With spirit at ease and will settled, one stroke completes it\"—approaches this idea.\n\nKing Wen observed at Zang and saw a man fishing. Yet his fishing was no ordinary fishing—where he cast his line, there was indeed fishing. This was constant fishing.\n\nKing Wen wished to elevate the man and entrust him with governance, yet feared his ministers and kinsmen would not accept it. He wished to release him and let him go, yet could not bear that the people would be left without a ruler. Thus, at dawn, he gathered his ministers and said: \"Formerly, I dreamed of a worthy man, dark of complexion and with a prominent forehead, riding a piebald horse with one red hoof. He declared: 'Entrust governance to the Elder of Zang—perhaps the people may yet recover.'\"\n\nThe ministers, startled, said: \"This was your late father, the former king.\"\n\nKing Wen replied: \"Then let us divine his will.\"\n\nThe ministers said: \"The former king’s command leaves no room for doubt—what need is there for divination?\"\n\nThereupon, they welcomed the Elder of Zang and entrusted him with governance. No statutes were altered, no decrees were issued. After three years, King Wen surveyed the realm and saw that the ranks of scholars had dissolved, factions had scattered, and officials no longer cultivated virtue. *Yǔ*-measures and *hú*-bushels dared not cross the four borders. When the ranks of scholars dissolved and factions scattered, unity prevailed. When officials no longer cultivated virtue, their duties aligned. When *yǔ*-measures and *hú*-bushels dared not cross the borders, the feudal lords harbored no divided loyalties.\n\nKing Wen then bowed northward and, addressing him as Grand Preceptor, asked: \"Can this governance extend to all under Heaven?\"\n\nThe Elder of Zang gave no response, then casually excused himself from court. That night, he fled and was never heard from again.\n\nThis passage recasts the tale of the Grand Duke, weaving it into a different narrative. *Constant fishing* means the fishing rod is always in hand. Though the rod remains in hand, there is no intent to fish—thus it is said: \"He did not hold to his fishing, yet there was indeed fishing.\" Such phrasing holds its own excellence.\n\n*Without a ruler* means the people would have no master. *One red hoof* means only one hoof was crimson. *The former king* refers to King Wen’s father.\n\n\"Unchanging statutes\" means no alteration of laws and institutions. \"No partial decrees\" means no single matter was ever issued as an edict. That only one matter is mentioned in the decrees is called \"partial decrees.\" \"Uprooted pillars and scattered flocks\" means no factions were established. \"Unfulfilled virtue\" means not claiming personal success—akin to the *Yi*’s saying: \"Some follow the king’s service without accomplishment.\" \"Shared endeavor\" means working together with the multitude without setting oneself apart. *Yu* is *yu* (a grain measure); foreign *yu*-*hu* differ in size, yet none dared enter his borders, so the feudal lords all knew where to pledge allegiance. Thus it is said: \"harbored no divided loyalties.\" \"Morning decree\" refers to hearing King Wen’s command regarding governance extending to all under Heaven, prompting his flight that night, never to be heard from again—like the *Book of Documents*’ line: \"To his life’s end, no renown.\"\n\n*Dan*’s retainers: the ancient text writes *fu-fu* (夫夫). Sima [Biao] says the first *fu* is written as *da* (大), reading *fu* as \"one great.\" The Qin stele on Mount Tai reads: \"The censor, *fu-fu*,\" where *fu* in seal script resembles *da*, as seen in the *Wenjian*.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"Was King Wen still incomplete? Then why did he dream?\" Confucius replied: \"Silence! Say no more. King Wen fulfilled it all—what criticism is there? He merely followed the moment.\" \"Followed the moment\" means he complied with temporary measures to make things easier for the people—how could this be faulted?\n\nLie Yukou drew his bow to full draw for Bohun Wuren, placing a cup of water on his elbow. He loosed the arrow, and as it flew, another took its place, then another lodged in the target. At that moment, he was like a wooden figurine. Bohun Wuren said: \"This is the archery of archery, not the archery of non-archery. I once asked you: could you shoot while climbing a high mountain, treading perilous rocks, or standing over an abyss of a hundred fathoms?\" Thereupon, Wuren ascended the high mountain, trod the perilous rocks, stood over the abyss, then turned and retreated until two-tenths of his feet hung over the edge. Beckoning Lie Yukou forward, Yukou prostrated himself, sweating to his heels. Bohun Wuren said: \"The perfected person gazes upward into the azure sky, delves downward into the Yellow Springs, roams to the eight limits—yet their spirit and qi remain unchanged. Now you tremble with fear in your eyes. Your inner strength is perilous indeed!\"\n\n\"Drew his bow to full draw\" means drawing the bow to its utmost. \"The front hand straight and the elbow level\" allows placing a cup of water atop it—indicating steadiness. \"Loosed\" means to shoot. \"Flew away\" means the arrow departed.\n\n\"沓 means layered or again. When one arrow has just departed and another already rests upon the bowstring—this is the layered presence of arrows upon the bowstring, where the departing arrow is scarcely gone before the next arrives to take its place. This describes the divine swiftness of shooting arrow after arrow in unbroken succession. 象人 refers to a wooden figurine. 背逡巡 means facing the high mountain while one’s back hangs over the abyss, retreating without cease—hence the term 逡巡. When two-tenths of the feet hang over the void and only one-tenth remains on solid ground, this is the utmost peril, yet Bohun Wuren could do it—this is what is called the steadfast holding of pure qi.\n\nShooting while standing on level ground is ordinary shooting. Thus it is said to be ‘the shooting of non-shooting.’ When the spirit can guard unity, then though one gazes upward into the azure sky, descends to the Yellow Springs, or roams to the eight limits, the heart remains unmoved, as if the terrain of danger or safety were one and the same. If, at the sight of peril, the eyes tremble and the gaze wavers, this shows one has not yet grasped the learning of the perfected person. To practice shooting in this manner and seek the essence of hitting the mark is indeed difficult. Thus it is said: ‘Your inner strength is perilous indeed!’\n\n怵 means fear. 恂目 means the eyes flicker with apprehension.\"\n\nShoulder Wu asked Sunshu Ao, “You have thrice served as Prime Minister yet shown no elation, and thrice been dismissed without a trace of sorrow. At first I doubted you, but now I see your face suffused with ease—how do you alone manage this in your heart?”\n\nSunshu Ao replied, “How do I surpass others? I accept that what comes cannot be refused, and what goes cannot be halted. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and so remain untroubled. How do I surpass others? Moreover, I do not know whether honor or disgrace lies with them or with me—whether it is theirs to lose or mine to lose. While I hesitate and look about in all directions, how can I find time to weigh what men call noble or base?”\n\nThe ease in his face arose not from external things but from within, from a spirit that nourished itself. If the honor of the Prime Ministership belonged to the office itself, it had no bearing on me; if what was noble in me belonged to me, it had no bearing on the office. Thus he said: “Is it theirs to lose, or mine? Is it mine to lose, or theirs?” These words capture the essence. To hesitate and look about is to gaze far into the vastness of heaven and earth—how could one know what men call noble or base?\n\nWhen Confucius heard of this, he said: “The true persons of old could not be swayed by the persuasions of the wise, seduced by the allure of beauty, robbed by bandits, or befriended by Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor. Life and death are great matters indeed, yet they remained unchanged—how much less would they be moved by rank or emolument? Such persons pass through the great mountains without obstruction, enter deep springs without getting wet, dwell in lowly and narrow places without weariness, and fill heaven and earth, ever more abundant even as they give to others.\n\nThe wise cannot sway them, for words cannot exhaust their depth. Beauty cannot seduce them, for sensual pleasures cannot corrupt their integrity. Bandits cannot rob them, for force cannot bend their will. Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor could not befriend them, for they withdrew from the world and held it lightly. *Jie* means obstruction, like a stone that, though seamless, can be drilled through. Thus it is said they pass through the great mountains without obstruction. Dwelling in poverty and lowliness, they do not take it as affliction. Thus it is said they dwell in narrow places without weariness. To fill heaven and earth is the Dao. When the Dao within oneself is already full, it extends to transform others, and its use is inexhaustible. Thus it is said: ‘Even as they give to others, they become ever more abundant.’\n\nThe King of Chu was seated with the Lord of Fan. After a while, the King’s attendants said, ‘Fan has perished three times.’ The Lord of Fan said, ‘The perishing of Fan is not enough to diminish what I possess. If the perishing of Fan is not enough to diminish what I possess, then the survival of Chu is not enough to preserve what I am.’ From this perspective, Fan has never truly perished, and Chu has never truly existed.”\n\nThis is like the man who, though his foot was cut off, still valued his foot—only here, the analogy shifts to say that the Dao within oneself is unaffected by whether one has a state or not. If Fan’s loss does not mean loss, and Chu’s survival does not mean survival, then the world’s gains and losses, fortunes and misfortunes, are all external things. Yet the meaning still hinges on the phrase “the survival of Chu is not enough to preserve what I am.” If loss is not enough to cause self-reproach, then gain is not enough to cause self-aggrandizement. *Self-reproach* means to feel remorse; *self-aggrandizement* means to boast. These words carry particular savor—they are the language of learning that bears directly on one’s own person.\n\n---\n\n*Outer Chapters: \"Knowledge Wanders North,\" Chapter Twenty-Two*\n\nKnowledge wandered north to the Dark Waters, ascended the hill of Kunfen, and there encountered Non-Action. Knowledge said, “I wish to ask you: What thoughts, what reflections lead to knowing the Dao? Where does one abide, what practices lead to peace in the Dao? From what source, by what path does one attain the Dao?” Three questions, yet Non-Action did not answer—not that he would not answer, but that he did not know how.\n\nKnowledge, unable to obtain an answer, returned to the south of the White Waters, ascended Fox Tower, and there saw Mad Jue. Knowledge repeated his questions to Mad Jue. Mad Jue said, “Ah! I know, and will tell you”—but mid-speech, he forgot what he wished to say. Knowledge, unable to obtain an answer, returned to the palace of the Yellow Emperor and asked him. The Yellow Emperor said, “Without thoughts, without reflections, one begins to know the Dao. Without abode, without practice, one begins to be at peace in the Dao. Without source, without path, one begins to attain the Dao.”\n\nKnowledge asked the Yellow Emperor, “You and I know this, but those two do not—who is correct?” The Yellow Emperor said, “Non-Action is truly right; Mad Jue is somewhat close. You and I will never come near it.”\n\nThe names before and after are all allegorical, yet these three have distinctions. *Knowledge* is one who possesses a thinking mind. *Non-Action* is spontaneity itself. *Mad* is wildness; *Jue* is like a withered branch—stiff and unknowing. In this book, the term *mad* is akin to the “floating and wandering” in *Free and Easy Wandering*. Mad and stiff, he has the appearance of one without knowledge. This is merely to say that those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know. Thus, when asked, he could not answer—like a monk with no elder before him, no preceptor. When he began to answer but forgot his words, it was as if he still knew there was a question. Thus it is said: “Non-Action is truly right; Mad Jue is somewhat close.”\n\nThose who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Thus the sage practices the teaching without words. The Dao cannot be attained; virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence can be practiced, righteousness can be diminished, ritual is mutual pretense. Thus it is said: “Lose the Dao, and virtue follows; lose virtue, and benevolence follows; lose benevolence, and righteousness follows; lose righteousness, and ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of chaos.” Thus it is said: “Those who practice the Dao daily diminish. Diminish and further diminish, until they reach non-action. With non-action, there is nothing that is not done.” Now, having become entangled in things, to return to the root—is this not difficult? Yet how easy it is for the great person!\n\nThose who know do not speak—this is Bodhidharma’s coming from the West without establishing words, directly pointing to the human mind, seeing one’s nature and becoming a Buddha. The teaching without words is the Vimalakīrti’s non-dual Dharma gate.\n\nThe Dao cannot be attained—it cannot be reached through words. Virtue cannot be reached—it cannot be sought through traces.\n\nRighteousness, propriety, and ritual—all leave traces. Where there are traces, the Dao is ruined. Zhuangzi regarded ritual as a forced imposition upon the world, comparing it to righteousness and propriety, yet its traces are even more pronounced. Thus it is said: “The flower of the Dao is the beginning of chaos.” The flower is outward adornment without substance. From outward adornment arises falsity, and from falsity arises deceit. Thus it is called “the beginning of chaos.” To dismiss cleverness and cast off artificiality—this is the daily diminishing of the Dao. Diminish and further diminish until one reaches nothingness, then forget one’s former self. When one can act without contrivance, one follows the natural principle of Heaven, and there is nothing that cannot be done.\n\nThings are but traces. To seek the Dao while still clinging to traces is to remain on par with things, and thus to perceive the root and origin of the self is rightly difficult. “To return to the root” means to gather in and revert to the state before things existed. The great person embodies non-action. For the great person, this is easy—so easy! (In Zhuangzi’s phrasing, if it were another, it would read: “Only the great person finds it easy.”)\n\nLife is the companion of death; death is the beginning of life. Who knows their order? The life of humans is the gathering of qi. When it gathers, there is life; when it scatters, there is death. If life and death are companions, what cause for concern? Thus the myriad things are one. What they deem beautiful is wondrous; what they deem foul is rotten. Yet the rotten transforms again into the wondrous, and the wondrous transforms again into the rotten. Thus it is said: “The world is united by a single qi.” The sage therefore values oneness.\n\nLife is the companion of death; death is the beginning of life. The latter phrase is easy to explain, but the former is difficult. Consider the flowering of plants into branches and leaves—this is their life. Yet what has already flourished will inevitably perish, so even this life is but death. As Master Yichuan said: “The breath that returns is not the breath that was exhaled.” This is precisely the meaning. The unripe fruit that remains is the sprout of renewal. Though called the “unripe fruit,” it is already dead. When planted, it revives—is this not death giving rise to life? The cycle of life and death pervades all things. Who knows the principle that governs it? The “order” is the governing thread, the master that directs it.\n\nThe gathering and scattering of qi give rise to life and death—this all know. Yet if one understands that life and death are but a single principle, what cause for concern? The companion of life is death, and death is one with life. Life and death are fundamentally one principle, shared by all things. Yet people distinguish between beauty and ugliness, good and evil. When flowers are in full bloom, they are deemed wondrous; when they fall to the ground, they are called rotten. They do not realize that when leaves fall and nourish the roots, a new beginning arises—thus the rotten transforms again into the wondrous. Yet once bloomed and fallen, the wondrous transforms again into the rotten. From ancient times to the present, back and forth, there is only this single qi. The sage, knowing this, does not distinguish between life and death, success and failure, fortune and misfortune. Thus it is said: “The sage therefore values oneness.” Oneness means no distinctions.\n\nHuangdi said: “I asked Wuwei. Wuwei said, ‘Do not respond to me.’ Not that he did not respond to me, but that he did not know how to respond. I asked Kuang Qu. Kuang Qu wished to tell me but did not tell me. Not that he did not tell me, but that in wishing to tell, he forgot it. Now I ask you—you know, so why do you not come close?” Huangdi said: “He is truly so because he does not know. This one seems so because he has forgotten. You and I will never come close because you know.” Kuang Qu heard this and considered Huangdi’s words to be wise.\n\nThese lines clarify the preceding meaning with great clarity. Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons have bright patterns yet do not debate; the myriad things have inherent principles yet do not explain. The sage traces the beauty of Heaven and Earth and comprehends the principles of the myriad things. Thus the perfected person embodies non-action, and the great sage does not act—this is called “observing Heaven and Earth.”\n\nNow, that numinous clarity and utmost subtlety, along with the transformations of the hundred things—life and death, square and round—none know their root. Yet all things have existed since ancient times, abiding as they are. The Six Directions are vast, yet nothing lies beyond their bounds. The tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it awaits its completion as a form. In the world, none do not rise and fall, yet throughout life, nothing remains fixed. Yin and yang, the four seasons, move in their courses, each maintaining its order. Obscure yet present, formless yet spirit-like, the myriad things are nurtured without awareness—this is called the root. One may observe Heaven thereby.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak—this is like the *Book of Changes*, which “benefits all under Heaven with beauty yet does not speak of what it benefits.” How great indeed! The “bright patterns” refer to the cycles of cold and heat, fullness and emptiness, growth and decline—all have clear, unchanging laws. Why would they require deliberation? Thus it is said: “They do not debate.” Whether the duck’s legs are short or the crane’s long, whether wheat droops or millet stands tall, whether things are cold or warm, bitter or sweet—all are natural principles. How could one explain their length or shortness, sweetness or bitterness? Thus it is said: “They have inherent principles yet do not explain.” “Not acting” is non-action. Non-action and not acting both follow the natural. The sage’s way of following the natural is simply to emulate Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: “This is called observing Heaven and Earth.”\n\n“Numinous clarity and utmost subtlety” refers to the wondrous principle. “The transformations of the hundred things” refers to the transformations of all things. The first “that” refers to Heaven; the second “that” refers to things. Whether things live or die, whether in life they are square or round—all are shaped by the numinous and utmost subtlety. Yet once they exist, who can fathom their root? Thus it is said: “The things that have already lived and died, that are square and round—none know their root.” “Flitting” means moving without cease, like the ceaseless flow of things. This is what the *Analects* means by “passing away like this.” Without insight, one could not speak of it thus. The Six Directions are vast, yet nothing lies beyond the bounds of creation. The tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it awaits its completion as a form. If there were no form of the autumn hair, there would be no name for the autumn hair—just as in the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, and Mount Tai is small. “Rising and falling” means coming and going. “Nothing remains fixed” means ever-renewing.\n\nThe myriad things come and go without end, day after day thus—hence it is said: “Nothing in the world does not rise and fall.” Throughout life, nothing remains fixed; only because nothing remains fixed do the four seasons move in their proper order.\n\nObscure, it cannot be seen—yet there is a flourishing vitality. As if absent yet present, the dead are companions of the living. Without form, the spirit does not rely on form to stand; it does not perish with life. To nurture is to cultivate. That which nurtures the myriad things is the Dao, yet people do not know it—this is the root of creation. Observing Heaven, one grasps no more than this principle; thus it is said: “One may observe it in Heaven.”\n\nNie Que asked the Way of Bei Yi. Bei Yi said: “Straighten your form, unify your gaze. Heaven’s harmony will come. Gather in your knowledge, unify your judgment. The spirit will arrive. Abandon virtue, and it will become your beauty. The Dao will become your dwelling. You will stare like a newborn calf, without seeking its former state.”\n\nBefore his words were finished, Nie Que fell asleep. Bei Yi rejoiced greatly, singing as he departed: “His form like withered bones, his heart like dead ashes—truly, his knowledge does not cling to the old. Vague and dim, dark and obscure, without mind, he cannot be schemed with. What manner of man is this?”\n\nHere, another pair of those who know the Dao is introduced, conversing together. As the Buddhists say: “A master’s hand reveals a master’s hand; a red heart reveals a red heart.” “Straighten your form, unify your gaze” is to forget the body, the ears and eyes. “Gather in your knowledge, unify your judgment” is to cast aside thought, deliberation, and consciousness.\n\n\"To transcend thought is transcendence itself. Heavenly harmony is the primordial qi. Forget the body, the ears and eyes, and the primordial qi is preserved whole. The spirit is what the Buddhists call the 'master within'—it comes and goes without fixed time, its whereabouts unknown, thus it does not come to dwell. 'Virtue will become your beauty' means virtue moistens the self. 'The Dao will become your dwelling' means dwelling in the vast abode of the world. To stare like a newborn calf is to gaze directly without knowledge. At birth, a calf does not fail to see, yet what does it truly see? The infant is the same—it does not seek its former state, for how can one know the reason for its gaze? This depicts the appearance of a mindless state. That his words were not yet finished and Nie Que fell asleep shows that his response was not yet complete when he drifted off. Their exchange was so perfectly attuned that words were unnecessary. 'Truly, his knowledge does not cling to the old' means he truly perceived the reality of this principle. Matters and things do not enter his heart, so he does not rely on the past to sustain himself—this is the meaning of 'not clinging to the old.' Vague and dim, dark and obscure, without form or sight. Since he is without mind, and I am not, words are impossible—thus 'without mind, he cannot be schemed with.' That such a person exists between heaven and earth—'What manner of man is this?'—is an expression of profound admiration.\n\nShun asked his minister, 'Can the Dao be possessed?' The minister replied, 'Your body is not your own possession—how can you possess the Dao?' Shun said, 'If my body is not mine, then whose is it?' The minister said, 'It is the form entrusted by heaven and earth. Life is not yours—it is the harmony entrusted by heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not yours—they are the compliance entrusted by heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not yours—they are the shedding entrusted by heaven and earth. Thus, your actions are not of your own direction, your dwelling is not of your own choosing, your food is not of your own savoring. Heaven and earth are the strong yang qi—how can you possess them?' 'Entrusted' means gathered together. The four great elements temporarily combine to form this body, hence 'entrusted form.' The harmony of yin and yang gives rise to life, hence 'life is entrusted harmony.' 'Compliance' is principle—nature and destiny reside within me, thus they are the principle of creation, hence 'entrusted compliance.' The succession of generations is like the molting of a cicada, hence 'children and grandchildren are entrusted shedding.' Strong yang qi is the qi of life—movement is yang. A person’s actions, dwelling, and eating are all driven by this qi, none of which are truly mine. As the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* says, 'Where is this illusory body now?'—this is the same idea. This passage is also uniquely profound, for it speaks of 'not knowing what to hold onto,' meaning there is no attachment.\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan, 'Today I have leisure—may I inquire about the supreme Dao?' Lao Dan said, 'Purify your mind through fasting, cleanse your heart through bathing, and refine your spirit. Shatter your knowledge. The Dao is profound and hard to describe—I will tell you its rough outline. The luminous arises from the obscure, order arises from formlessness, spirit arises from the Dao, and form arises from essence. All things give birth through form. Thus, those with nine orifices are born from the womb, and those with eight orifices are born from eggs.' 'Purify through fasting' means to guide and unblock. 'Cleanse through bathing' means to wash and purify. 'Shatter' means to cast aside. 'Profound' describes its depth. 'Outline' refers to its boundaries—when the profound is hard to express, one can only speak of its edges and rough contours. The luminous is what can be seen; the obscure is what cannot. What can be seen and distinguished is called 'order'—the myriad things. Formlessness is creation. Spirit resides within humans. Form is visible; essence is not. Nine orifices belong to humans; eight orifices belong to birds. Since humans and birds are mentioned together, the text humbles them. The Buddhist sutras speak of birth from the womb, from eggs, and from moisture—all originate from this idea. The meaning here is that though humans are nobler than other beings, their birth is fundamentally the same. Thus, one should abandon the physical body to seek the Dharma-body. Zhuangzi’s intent is the same.\n\nIts coming leaves no trace, its going no boundary. Without doors or chambers, it is vast and all-pervading. Those who encounter it here find their limbs strong, their thoughts penetrating, their ears and eyes sharp and clear. Their use of the mind is effortless, their response to things without fixed method. Heaven cannot but be high, earth cannot but be broad, the sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—this is the Dao.\n\n'Its coming leaves no trace, its going no boundary' speaks of creation—where things depart and arrive cannot be traced. 'Vast and all-pervading' describes the great void. A person’s dwelling has doors and chambers, but in the great void, one sees only its boundless vastness—how can one know where it enters or exits? 'Those who encounter it here' means those who seek and find this Dao. 'Limbs strong' is what the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* calls 'the body light and at ease.' 'Penetrating' means unobstructed. 'Effortless' means following nature. 'Without fixed method' means it is not predetermined but arises in response to encounters. If not for this Dao, who would truly bring about heaven, earth, the sun, moon, and the myriad things? These four lines merely describe how this Dao pervades all, above and below.\n\nMoreover, extensive learning does not necessarily mean knowledge, eloquence does not necessarily mean wisdom—the sage has already settled this. As for what is increased yet not augmented, diminished yet not reduced, this is what the sage preserves. Profound like the sea, towering like a mountain, it begins and ends in the same place. It measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion—this is the Dao of the noble person. Is it external? All things rely on it without exhaustion—this is the Dao. Within the world, there are those who are neither yin nor yang, dwelling between heaven and earth, simply being human. Yet they return to the source. Observing from the root, life is but a sigh, a breath—though there are differences in longevity, how much do they truly differ? The saying of 'a moment' is sufficient—why distinguish between Yao and Jie?\n\n'Extensive learning' does not mean true knowledge. People’s eloquence is all boasting of their own abilities, yet it does not necessarily arise from their own wisdom—their wisdom is bestowed by creation. Thus, the sage judges by creation, not taking increase as increase or decrease as decrease. What is preserved lies within me, and external things cannot add to it—this is the sage’s affair. 'Begins and ends in the same place' means it is pure and unceasing. 'Measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion' means responding to things without limit. 'Measures' means to apply and assess—this still involves intention, so it is only the Dao of the noble person, for it speaks of traces. If I respond to things, it is 'measuring and sustaining the myriad things.' If things come and I respond, it is 'all things rely on it.'\n\n\"\n\nThis is \"responding only after being moved, acting only under compulsion\"—if such a way does not exhaust itself, it is called the Dao. The Dao is without intention, without traces. Within the world, there is a being called the \"perfected person at the center of Heaven and Earth,\" neither yin nor yang—words cannot point to or name it. Though possessing human form, its heart roams at the origin of things, merely lodging its form between Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: \"Straightforward and human, it will return to the source.\" The source is the origin of the myriad things. Obstruction and stagnation of qi are what cause disharmony. When the qi of the human body is disharmonious, it produces warts and tumors; when the qi of creation generates humans, it too is a case of disharmony. Thus it is said: \"Viewed from the root,\" meaning observed from the origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis idea seems to denigrate the human body—it is akin to the Buddhist notion of a \"skin-bag filled with blood.\" Examining closely, much of the discourse in the *Tripitaka* stems from this. Yao and Jie, right and wrong—these are judgments of the human world, arising only after the existence of this body. Within a hundred years, though lifespans may vary in length, compared to Heaven and Earth, they are but a fleeting moment. These words are also apt: fruits and melons have their principles; human relationships, though difficult, are how we rank one another. The sage encounters them without resistance, passes them without attachment, and harmonizes with them in response—this is virtue. To respond by chance is the Dao. It is how emperors rise and kings emerge.\n\nHuman life between Heaven and Earth is like a white colt passing through a gap—suddenly, it is gone. Bursting forth, all things emerge; gently, smoothly, all things return. Fruits and melons are the most insignificant of things—yet even their growth...\n\nAt times, their seeds are sown—from ancient times to the present, their kinds remain unmingled. Is this not the principle of spontaneity? Speaking of the most insignificant, the greater may be understood. Within human relationships, though many hardships arise—such as the restraints between high and low, the oppressions between strong and weak, the sorrows and joys of long and short lives—these are all hardships. Yet, dwelling together within the cosmos, all take their place in the order of things: ruler and minister, father and son, the civilized and the barbarian—all are but creatures within the workings of creation. The sage says: things of the same kind gather together, beings form groups by their kind. Thus, whether refined or coarse, self or other, all are said to take their place in the order—this, too, is a lofty discourse.\n\nTo encounter without resistance is to meet the times, whether favorable or adverse, and simply follow them. To pass without attachment is to let what passes transform. To harmonize, to chance upon, to respond with each stimulus, to join in accord—this is the spontaneity of virtue and the Dao. The rise of emperors and kings does not exceed this principle.\n\nThat which is sudden is the meaning of \"a fleeting moment\": emergence is birth, extension, coming; entering death is contraction, departure, going.\n\nThe state of sudden surging forth—pushing, crowding, bursting out—is like oil flowing smoothly, alive and ripe. This is the extension of what departs and the contraction of what arrives, precisely what the *Yi* means by \"exhausting the spirit and knowing transformation.\" Having transformed, it gives birth; having transformed again, it dies. Living beings mourn this; people grieve over it. They loosen their bow-cases and cast off their book-wrappers, entangled and confused. The soul and spirit are about to depart, and the body follows—this is the great return to the origin of things. Originally, birth arises from nothing into being; death transforms from being back into nothing. Though the principle is the same, humans and creatures take it as sorrow and delusion. *Taō* is the bow-case; *zhì* is the wrapper. The deluded still cling to something, remaining unclear. If one can awaken, they will untie the bow-case and discard the wrapper—casting it off, abandoning it. *Fēn* and *wǎn* describe transformation: the soul and spirit disperse, and the body follows. Thus, it is called the great return, meaning the return to one’s true dwelling.\n\nThe formless taking form and form returning to formlessness—this is universally known, not the concern of those who are about to reach the ultimate. This is the common discourse of the multitude. Those who reach it do not discuss it; those who discuss it do not reach it. The formless form is the unseen. Within form, there is an unseen form—this is what the Buddha calls the *Dharmakāya*, eternally abiding and indestructible. Yet though all know this, they cannot depart from form to seek it, and so they do not attain it. To make it one’s pursuit—this is learning, and to approach the ultimate, what one engages in does not end here. Thus, it is said: this is not the concern of those who are about to reach it. The multitude all speak of this, yet none have attained it. Hence, it is called the common discourse of the multitude. Expounding further: those who attain it do not discuss it; to have such discourse is to not have attained it. Thus, it is said: those who reach it do not discuss it; those who discuss it do not reach it. For the formless form is fundamentally easy to know and requires no explanation. To take this as a topic of discussion is to have not yet reached its most wondrous state—this is speaking at a yet higher level.\n\nClear insight finds no encounter; disputation is inferior to silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing is inferior to blocking it. This is called great attainment. To see and have an encounter is a seeing with traces. The Dao cannot be perceived through form or traces, hence there is no encounter. Thus, it is said: clear insight finds no encounter. Disputation is inferior to silence; to engage in disputation is already wrong. *Mò* means not speaking. The so-called Dao is not heard from others but heard by oneself. To call it \"hearing\" is already not the Dao. To have heard is not as good as not having heard; to block the ears and have no hearing is best. Thus, it is said: the Dao cannot be heard; hearing is inferior to blocking. *Dà dé* means profound attainment.\n\nDongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi, \"Where does the so-called Dao reside?\"\nZhuangzi said, \"There is nowhere it does not reside.\"\nDongguo Zi said, \"Specify a place, and then it can be so.\"\nZhuangzi said, \"It is in the ants.\"\n\"How can it be so low?\"\n\"It is in the weeds.\"\n\"How can it be even lower?\"\n\"It is in the tiles and bricks.\"\n\"How can it be even more so?\"\n\"It is in excrement and urine.\"\nDongguo Zi did not respond.\nZhuangzi said, \"Your question fundamentally does not reach the essence. When Zheng Huo asked the market inspector about weighing a pig, the lower he went, the clearer it became.\" This is a well-crafted fabrication, though it may seem like an extreme statement. Yet in things, whether refined or coarse, the same principle emerges—this is one point of discourse. It aligns with the Buddhist idea of \"the insentient preaching the Dharma\"; even tiles and bricks blaze forth, constantly speaking. *Qī ér hòu kě* means specifying a place and then it can be so. *Zhì* is the root; your question does not reach the root, hence my answers grow ever lower. *Jiān shì* is like today’s meat market overseer. *Lǚ shǐ* means treading on a pig to know its weight. *Kuàng* means comparison; the lower the market’s base, the clearer the comparison. The official *Zhèng Huò* wanted to know the pig’s fatness or leanness. If he asked the most lowly, the comparison would be even clearer. Thus, it is said: the lower, the clearer. *Zhèng* is the market overseer; *Huò* is the person’s name. This is a metaphor for those who inquire about the Dao.\n\n\"You must not be fixed—nothing escapes the ultimate Dao.\" Such great words are likewise all-pervading and universal. These three—*zhōu*, *biàn*, *xián*—are different names for the same reality; their meaning is one. Have you ever wandered together in the Palace of No-What-Is? Joining in discussion, there is no end to its profundity. Have you ever been idle together—serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease? Empty and boundless, my will goes nowhere and does not know where it arrives; it departs and comes without knowing where it rests. I have gone and come without knowing its end, wandering in boundless vastness. Great knowledge enters and does not know its limit.\n\n*Mò bì* means having no fixed certainty. If you have no fixed mind, then the principle of all things cannot escape, and how could you doubt my words? Thus, it is said: the ultimate Dao is like this; great words are likewise so. *Zhōu*, *biàn*, and *xián* all share the same meaning, hence it is said: different names, same reality. This sentence illustrates that in things, whether refined or coarse, the principle is one.\n\nThe Palace of No-What-Is has already been discussed, expressing the idea of no fixed certainty. *Tóng hé ér lùn* means that without refinement or coarseness, all join in the same discussion—how could there be an end to its profundity? *Diào xián* means harmonious ease. *Dàn*, still; *mò*, vast; *qīng*, clear; *diào xián*, all describe the wonder of non-action. *Liáo* means emptiness. *Yǐ* is the same as *yǐ* (already). To have investigated this to the emptiness of oneness is for my will to be fully content. Thus, it is said: empty and boundless, my will. These four words are concise yet powerful. If there is no going, how can there be an arrival? Though there is departure and coming, there is no place of rest. The two preceding sentences express the unknowability of going and coming. It concludes by saying: I have gone and come without knowing its end—merely seeing it wander in boundless vastness, entering great knowledge without knowing its limit. *Pánghuáng* means roaming; *féng hóng* means vast and open; *dà zhī* means the ultimate Dao.\n\nThat which is one with things has no boundary with things; that which things do not bound is called the boundary of things. The unbounded boundary is the boundary of the unbounded. They speak of fullness and emptiness, yet it is not fullness or emptiness; they speak of decline and decay, yet it is not decline or decay; they speak of beginning and end, yet it is not beginning or end; they speak of accumulation and dispersal, yet it is not accumulation or dispersal. To be one with things without boundary is to transform with things.\n\nTo transform with things is to be able to \"thing\" things—what is called \"not-thinging\" is precisely what enables one to \"thing\" things. If one does not transform with things, then boundaries arise. Once boundaries exist, one is confined by them; where there is confinement, there is limitation. Thus, what has boundaries is called the boundary of things. To push to the limit is to reach the limitless; to exhaust is to reach the inexhaustible. This is to be unbounded by the boundaries of things and to attain that which is unbounded—what is called the boundary of the unbounded.\n\nIt is like standing at the edge of a boundary and seeing that there is no boundary. The formless form, the form of the formless; the unbounded boundary, the boundary of the unbounded—such phrasing reveals the marvels of Zhuangzi’s prose. Decline and flourishing, decay and ascent: mention one, and the other is understood. Fullness and emptiness, rise and fall, beginning and end, gathering and dispersal—all appear to leave traces, yet in truth cannot be exhausted. This is the boundary of the unbounded.\n\nĒ Hé Gān and Shénnóng studied together under Lǎolóng Jí. Shénnóng sat with the door shut, weaving by daylight. Ē Hé Gān pushed open the door at midday and entered, saying, \"Lǎolóng is dead.\" Shénnóng leaned on his staff and rose, then cast it aside with a clatter and laughed, saying, \"Heaven knew my stubbornness and arrogance, so it cast me aside and let him die. The Master died without ever drawing forth my wild words!\" Yǎn Gāng, upon hearing this, said, \"Those who embody the Dao are the ones upon whom the noble ones of the world depend. Yet even at the tip of an autumn hair, one ten-thousandth part of the Dao remains unattained—and still he knew to conceal his wild words before dying. How much more, then, should one who embodies the Dao do so?\"\n\nTo see nothing when looking, to hear nothing when listening—such is the discourse of men when they speak of the Dao, yet this is merely a way of discussing the Dao, not the Dao itself. *Zhā* means to open; he pushed open the door and entered. *Bō rán* is the sound of casting aside the staff.\n\n\"Heaven knew me\"—here, \"Heaven\" is used to address the deceased Old Long Ji. While the Master lived, he could draw forth my grand words; now that he is dead, no one can. This means that with Old Long Ji’s death, my words have died with him.\n\nYǎn is the surname; Gāng, the given name. Upon offering condolences for Old Long Ji, he heard Shénnóng’s words. Those who embody the Dao become one with it. *Xì* means to depend upon and honor: if one embodies the Dao, all noble ones of the world will depend upon and honor them. Now, Shénnóng, who has not yet perceived the Dao, still understood that Old Long Ji’s death was a concealment of his wild words—how much more, then, should one who embodies the Dao in the same way as Old Long Ji do so? \"Wild words\" are the same as \"grand words.\" His meaning was this: the Dao resides in non-speech. To conceal one’s words and die is to be in accord with the Dao. Shénnóng has not yet reached this realm, yet he still spoke thus—how much more should one surpassing Shénnóng do so?\n\nThe tip of an autumn hair is the smallest of things. To have not even one ten-thousandth part of the Dao within it is to have less than the least—this much is clear. Buddhist scriptures, in their calculations and analogies, also contain such expressions.\n\nThe Dao originally has no sound or form; it cannot be seen or heard. If one discusses it with others, naming it \"obscure obscurity,\" this is merely a forced designation—it is not the Dao itself. Thus it is said, \"This is a way of discussing the Dao, not the Dao.\" That is to say, the speaker does not truly know. Form and sound exist; obscurity does not. To know existence as non-existence is not as good as merging with non-existence entirely. This means that Shénnóng’s words, though spoken, do not yet constitute true knowledge of the Dao.\n\nThereupon Tài Qīng asked Wúqióng, \"Do you know the Dao?\"\nWúqióng said, \"I do not know.\"\nHe asked again.\nWúwéi Wúwéi said, \"I know the Dao.\"\nTài Qīng said, \"Does your knowledge of the Dao have a pattern?\"\nWúwéi said, \"It does.\"\nTài Qīng said, \"What is this pattern like?\"\nWúwéi said, \"I know that the Dao can be noble, can be base, can be constrained, can be dispersed—this is the pattern by which I know the Dao.\"\n\nTài Qīng then took these words and asked Wúshǐ, \"If this is so, then is Wúqióng’s not-knowing correct, or is Wúwéi’s knowing correct? Which is right and which is wrong?\"\nWúshǐ said, \"Not-knowing runs deep; knowing is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external.\"\n\nThereupon Tài Qīng sighed from within, saying, \"Is not-knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not-knowing? Who knows the knowledge of not-knowing?\"\nWúshǐ said, \"The Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not it. Do you know that the formless cannot be formed? The Dao should not be named.\"\n\nWúshǐ said, \"If one asks about the Dao and another responds, neither knows the Dao. Even the one who asks about the Dao has not heard the Dao. The Dao has no questions; questions have no answers. To ask questions is to exhaust inquiry; to answer is to lack inwardness. Responding to exhaustion with emptiness—if this is so, then externally, one does not observe the cosmos; internally, one does not know what lies within the universe. Thus one does not transgress the Great Beginning, does not wander the Kunlun, and does not roam the Great Void.\"\n\nAt the outset of speech, the two characters placed here correspond to the \"Thus have I heard\" at the beginning of Buddhist sutras. The numerability of the Dao means it can be enumerated and spoken of in detail. The convergence and dispersion of high and low are all aspects of the Dao that can be enumerated—this is the principle of convergence. Inwardly, one attains it; outwardly, one sets it apart from the Dao as a duality.\n\nThe knowing that transcends knowledge is the ineffable subtlety. That which is \"formless among forms\" is the non-thing that enables all things. To be in opposition is to have a name for the Dao, for then the name stands in opposition to the Dao, departing from its original truth. Thus it is said, \"The Dao should not be named.\" The Dao itself has no questions; if one asks and another answers, I have already departed from the Dao, and the questioner’s hearing is also not the Dao.\n\n\"Exhausting inquiry\" means that one’s views lead to a dead end in questioning, for it refers to clinging to words and seeking knowledge and perception where they do not exist. \"Lacking inwardness\" means the center has not attained this Dao. If one attains this Dao, one does not respond.\n\nThe cosmos is what can be seen, hence it is said, \"externally, one does not observe the cosmos.\" The Great Beginning is what cannot be seen, hence it is said, \"internally, one does not know what lies within.\" Kunlun lies beyond the cosmos, and the Great Void lies beyond Kunlun. If one has not even traversed Kunlun, how can one reach the Great Void?\n\nGuangyao asked Wu You, \"Does the Master possess it, or is he without it?\" Guangyao, unable to ask further, gazed intently at his appearance—profoundly empty, utterly vacant. He looked at him all day without seeing, listened without hearing, and grasped without obtaining.\n\nGuangyao said, \"This is perfection! Who could attain such a state? I can attain being and non-being, but I have not yet attained non-being of non-being.\" When one becomes \"without being,\" how can one reach this state?\n\nThe passage describing his gaze—\"gazing intently at his appearance\"—merely depicts the Dao’s invisibility. \"I can attain being and non-being, but I have not yet attained non-being of non-being\"—this saying is marvelous beyond marvels. If one has not attained non-being of non-being, then the self still resides within the realm of non-being, possessed by the concept of non-being. How can one reach the state of profound emptiness and utter vacancy?\n\nThe *Yuanjue Jing* says, \"Those who speak of non-enlightenment are likewise so.\" To awaken to the point of non-enlightenment may be called marvelous, yet even this is not the ultimate, for it still regards non-enlightenment as incomplete. This is the meaning of \"not yet attaining non-being of non-being.\" The earlier \"knowing non-being\" of Fang Qing and Wu Shi, and now Guangyao’s \"without being,\" seem to use such names, yet their implied meaning is quite clear—unlike other figures such as Wang Ni or Bei Yi.\n\nThe smith of hooks under Da Ma was eighty years old yet never missed by a hair’s breadth. Da Ma said, \"Are you skillful, or do you possess the Dao?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Your servant has his discipline. At twenty, I delighted in forging hooks. To other things, I paid no heed; apart from hooks, I observed nothing. This is the user borrowing from the non-user. By prolonging its use, one attains mastery—how much more so for that which is never unused? What thing does not rely on it?\"\n\nHooks refer to belt hooks. Da Ma was the Grand Marshal. *Chui* means forging, and *qian* refers to the smith of hooks, an official under the Grand Marshal. Though old, his skill was so precise that not even a hair’s difference was missed—this speaks of his craftsmanship. \"Apart from hooks, I observed nothing\" echoes the earlier \"knowing only the cicada’s wings.\" His focus was entirely on hooks, seeing nothing beyond. The \"user\" is skill, while the \"non-user\" is the Dao’s spontaneity. \"Never unused\" refers to the Dao’s non-action that accomplishes all. He says, \"I borrow the marvel of non-use to apply to skill, and through long practice, I attain mastery even in old age. How much more so for the Dao, which is non-action yet accomplishes all? What in the world does not rely on it?\"\n\nRan Qiu asked Confucius, \"Before there was heaven and earth, could it be known?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"It could. The past is like the present.\"\n\nRan Qiu, having asked amiss, withdrew. The next day, he asked again, \"Formerly, I asked whether what existed before heaven and earth could be known...\"\n\nConfucius said, \"It could. The past is like the present.\"\n\n\"You said, 'The past is like the present.' Formerly, I was enlightened; today, I am benighted. May I ask what this means?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Formerly, you were enlightened because the spirit had first received it. Today, you are benighted because you now seek it through what is not spirit. Without past, without present, without beginning, without end—could there be descendants without ancestors?\n\nRan Qiu did not respond. Confucius said, \"Enough. No answer is needed. One does not give life to life or death to death. Do life and death depend on something? All are of one body. There is that which existed before heaven and earth—is it a thing? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing and cannot precede things. Yet it is as if there were a thing. Without end, the sage’s love for humanity also takes this as its model. At the inception of the Great Ultimate, yin and yang divided to form heaven and earth. The movement of heaven and earth, the alternation of yin and yang, cycles without end. The past was thus; the present is thus.\n\nTo answer the question of what existed before heaven and earth by saying the past is like the present—this is the meaning. The luminous is seen with utmost clarity. The spirit is the awareness within me; what is not spirit is the numinous clarity of awareness obscured by qi. Formerly, your luminous clarity was present, for the numinous awareness was there—thus you could receive it. Today, your benightedness arises because the numinous awareness is absent, and so you seek yet do not know.\n\nWithout past or present, without beginning or end—this speaks of the principle of the Great Ultimate. In every movement and stillness, it is ever thus. The principle of creation is inexhaustibly generative, like the descendants of a person—one does not wait for their existence to know of them. With this person, there are these descendants; with this cosmos, there are these yin and yang. Not a single breath’s interruption is possible.\n\nEnough. No answer is needed.\"\n\nHere your arrival at this point renders further words unnecessary. The moment \"birth\" arises, \"death\" follows—it is by birth that the word \"death\" comes to be. The moment \"death\" arises, \"birth\" follows—it is by the name of death that what is born is later called \"life.\" This is what \"no birth, no death\" means, and how these phrases transform. Death and life depend upon one another; they are of one body—one body is like one root. It is one principle, the spontaneity of creation itself.\n\nThat which gives rise to things is not itself a thing; what is not a thing must have existed before heaven and earth—how could it be named as a thing? Hence it is said: \"Is there something that existed before heaven and earth and yet is a thing?\" To speak of the \"not-thing\" that is a thing is not to name it as a thing. Once named as a thing, it cannot be said to have existed before heaven and earth. Thus it is already a thing. Therefore it is said: \"A thing cannot emerge before things.\" Yet where there is a thing, the appearances of things are endless. Hence it is said: \"It is as if there were a thing.\" In such passages, the subtlety of the text shines—here the sage’s care for humanity leaves traces one can see.\n\nThe pursuit of appearances extends without cease, for what is sought lies in the existence of things, yet one does not know that what gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Yan Yuan asked Confucius, saying: \"I once heard from you, Master, that one should not send off nor welcome anything. May I ask about the wandering you speak of?\" Confucius replied: \"The people of old transformed outwardly while inwardly remaining untransformed; the people of today transform inwardly while outwardly remaining untransformed. Those who transform with things are one with those who do not transform. How could one be at peace with transformation or non-transformation? How could one be at one with them without friction? One must be with them without seeking to surpass.\n\nThe parks of Xiwei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of Youyu, the halls of Tang and Wu—these were the dwellings of the noble person, such as the followers of Confucianism and Mohism, who took them as teachers. Thus they contended with one another over right and wrong, and how much more so the people of today! The sage engages with things without harming them; one who does not harm things cannot be harmed by them. Only one who is without harm can send off and welcome others. To send off nothing and welcome nothing is to be without a mind for things. Responding to things without being burdened by them is outward transformation; being moved by stimuli without disturbing the heart is inward non-transformation.\n\nThus it is said: 'The people of old transformed outwardly while inwardly remaining untransformed.' To engage in daily contention with the heart is inward transformation; to grind and clash with things, being inwardly enslaved, is outward non-transformation. Thus it is said: 'The people of today transform inwardly while outwardly remaining untransformed.' With one’s inwardly untransformed self, one outwardly responds to things. What passes is transformed, yet without sending off or welcoming, one does not know transformation or non-transformation. Thus it is said: 'Those who transform with things are one with those who do not transform.'\n\n'How could one be at peace with transformation or non-transformation?' 'How' here means 'how could it be?' 'To be at one' speaks of mutual friction. 'Friction' is the same as 'grinding.' 'How' is the same as 'how could it be?' 'Seeking to surpass' means seeking much; much seeking leads to competition. 'Without seeking to surpass' means not competing. 'One must be with them without seeking to surpass' means that one of the utmost Dao must be with things without seeking to surpass them.\n\nXiwei, the Yellow Emperor, Youyu, Tang, Wu, and the teachers of Confucianism and Mohism were all unable to fully embody the way of inward non-transformation, hence they came to contend over right and wrong. The struggle over right and wrong arises only after the five flavors contend, hence it is said 'contend.' To speak of Xiwei and below in contrast to Confucianism and Mohism is to express the idea of belittling the great.\n\nParks, gardens, palaces, and halls are called 'nests and burrows.' Not harming things is to transform with them; having transformed with things, they cannot harm you, for you are without burden. Only with a heart free of burden can one send off and welcome others. The earlier statement about 'sending off nothing and welcoming nothing' and this statement about 'sending off and welcoming others' are the same as 'non-action and yet nothing left undone,' expressing the meaning of 'not being a thing yet giving rise to things.'\n\nMountains and forests, marshlands and wilds—these make me joyful and glad. Yet before the joy is complete, sorrow follows. The coming of joy and sorrow I cannot resist; their going I cannot halt. Alas! The people of the world are but travelers in things. They know what they encounter but not what they do not; they know what they can do but not what they cannot. Ignorance and inability are what no person can avoid. Yet those who strive to avoid what no person can avoid—is this not also lamentable?\n\nProfound words abandon words; profound action abandons action. To equalize knowledge with what is known is shallow indeed. When people wander among mountains, forests, marshlands, and wilds, they begin with joy. Once joyful, they are inevitably moved; once moved, sorrow follows. The *Lanting Record* employs this very idea: joy arises from things, sorrow arises from things; coming and going are not within my control. Thus this heart of mine is but a lodging house for sorrow and joy. This speaks of the absence of a true master, being moved by things.\n\nWhat is encountered is visible; what is not encountered is invisible. The visible is human; the invisible is Heaven. What one can do is human; what one cannot is Heaven. All people have what they do not know and cannot do. Since this is called 'human,' none can avoid it. Hence it is said: 'Ignorance and inability are what no person can avoid.' Only by knowing the human and not knowing Heaven do people employ their hearts and intelligence, striving to avoid what cannot be avoided. How could this not be lamentable? Profound words are without words.\n\nThus it is said: the ultimate words transcend words; the ultimate action is non-action. Hence it is said: ultimate action transcends action. Not knowing what cannot be known, yet taking what can be known as knowledge—how shallow is this view! Thus it is said: \"equalizing knowledge\" means \"what is known is equalized,\" where \"equalizing\" is akin to \"all.\" This appears in the miscellaneous chapter \"Gengsang Chu,\" Chapter Twenty-Three.\n\nAmong Lao Dan’s disciples was one named Gengsang Chu, who had partially grasped the Master’s Dao. He went north to dwell on Mount Weilü. Those among his retainers who were cunningly clever departed from him; those among his concubines who were ostentatiously benevolent kept their distance. Only the dull-witted and the idle remained to serve him. After three years, Weilü flourished. The people of Weilü said to one another: \"When Master Gengsang first arrived, we regarded him with surprise. Now, when we reckon our days, we find them insufficient, but when we reckon our years, we find them abundant. He must be a sage! Why do we not together honor him as our ancestral spirit and worship him as our grain deity?\"\n\nWhen Gengsang Chu heard this, he turned to the south with a troubled countenance. His disciples were perplexed. Gengsang Chu said: \"Disciples, why are you perplexed by me? When spring’s qi arises, the hundred grasses grow; when autumn arrives in due season, the myriad treasures mature. Do spring and autumn act with deliberate attainment to bring this about? The great Dao has already unfolded. I have heard that the perfected person dwells like a corpse within a walled chamber, while the hundred clans roam wildly, not knowing where to turn. Now, with the petty folk of Weilü whispering among themselves—\"\n\n\"Would they place me among the ranks of the worthy? Am I then one so shallow as to be measured? This is why I cannot let go of Master Lao’s words.\n\nThe laborer and the disciple—one grasps a partial truth, the other a singular insight; both are but servants. The clarity of distinct boundaries, the tenderness of compassionate softness, the clumsy simplicity of the unhewn—all are but fragments, as disjointed as a cripple. To regard me as extraordinary is to see only my untrammeled ease, different from others. That my yearly reckoning yields abundance speaks only to the benefit of long duration. To honor as an ancestral spirit and worship as a grain deity—these four words of reverent offering carry equal weight, and such phrasing stirs the brush to dance.\n\nTo face south—this must be the direction of his dwelling—yet he was not at ease, not joyful. That spring and autumn achieve their effects is the work of Heaven. Thus it is said: 'Do they act with deliberate attainment to bring this about?' The great Dao has already unfolded—this Dao is the natural course, a metaphor for effortless spontaneity.\n\nDwelling like a corpse within a walled chamber, he entrusts himself to the wild roaming, becoming one with the hundred clans, none knowing what he does or where he goes. Thus it is said: 'The hundred clans roam wildly, not knowing where to turn'—this is to forget the world together.\n\nTo place me among the worthy is to assign me a position, yet I am but a small vessel, easily seen and known. As the Buddhists say: 'My cultivation lacks power, and the gods see through me.' That I cannot let go of Master Lao’s words is my fear of failing my teacher’s instruction and thus being displeased.\"\n\nThe disciples said: \"Not so. In a common ditch, the great fish has no room to turn its body, and the minnows and eels become its rulers. On a hillock of a few fathoms, the great beast has no space to conceal its form, and the fox and badger become its omens. Moreover, to honor the worthy and empower the capable, to prioritize goodness and benefit—this has been so since the time of Yao and Shun, how much more so for the folk of Weilü? Master, you should listen to them.\"\n\nGengsang Chu said: \"Come, my disciples. The beast of the enclosed chariot, armored and separated from the mountain, cannot escape the snares and nets. The fish that swallows boats, stranded when the waters recede, is tormented even by ants. Thus birds and beasts do not tire of high places, and fish and turtles do not tire of the deep. For one who preserves their form and life, to conceal themselves is not to tire of depth and remoteness—this alone suffices.\n\nMoreover, what are those two worthies to be praised?\"\n\nIn their disputations, they would recklessly breach walls to sow weeds and brambles—combing their hair with meticulous care, counting grains of rice for cooking, all in stealthy preoccupation. How could such things suffice to benefit the world? When worthies are exalted, the people contend and oppress one another; when cunning is employed, the people steal from one another. These practices cannot enrich the people. The people’s pursuit of profit is relentless: sons kill fathers, ministers kill rulers; thieves break in at broad daylight, and burglars tunnel through walls at noon. I tell you, the root of great chaos must arise in the age of Yao and Shun, and its branches will endure a thousand generations hence. A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another.\n\nThough the *nifang* be small, it may rule the narrowest ditch; though the *fanghu* be small, it may rule the lowliest hill. This means that in every place, great or small, there is something to be revered. \"Prioritizing goodness and benefit\" means that when names are proclaimed, profit follows. Even in the time of Yao and Shun, it was so with the worthy and capable: when a man possessed the virtue of worthiness and ability, others would inevitably honor and esteem him. Now, though Weilü be small, its reverence for worthiness is the same as in ancient times—this is why they say you, Master, should listen to them.\n\n*Han* means \"to enclose,\" and *tun* means \"to swallow\"; *jie* means \"alone.\"\n\n\"Dang\" means \"to drift and scatter.\" This is a metaphor for when a name appears in the world, it can harm one’s physical form; preserving one’s form and life, nurturing life and attaining long vision, means concealing oneself without tiring of profound obscurity—desiring to withdraw from the world without fame. The \"two masters\" refer to Yao and Shun. To take Yao and Shun as models is like planting grass atop a wall—there is no such principle. This means that in citing them as evidence, one loses what is fitting.\n\nCombing one’s hair frequently and measuring rice for cooking—these describe the petty and anxious state of the mind. When worthies are promoted, the people will surely compete; when knowledge is made a task, the people grow ever more deceitful. \"These several things\" refer to the above matters. \"The people are most diligent in pursuit of profit\" means that they suffer greatly for their livelihood.\n\n*Pei* means \"a crumbling wall.\" To bore through a wall at midday is to steal in broad daylight. \"A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another\" means that the world’s calamities began with Yao and Shun.\n\nNanrong Chu sat up straight and said, \"As for one like Chu, my years are already advanced—how then shall I entrust my work to reach this state?\" Master Gengsang replied, \"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not let your thoughts and cares flutter about like this. In three years, you may attain this state.\"\n\nNanrong Chu said, \"The eyes and the form—I do not know their difference, yet the blind cannot see themselves. The ears and the form—I do not know their difference, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves. The heart and the form—I do not know their difference, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. The form and the form are also separate—yet is it that things sometimes come between them? You now tell Chu, ‘Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not let your thoughts and cares flutter about.’ Chu has striven to hear the Dao and has reached understanding.\"\n\nMaster Gengsang said, \"My words are exhausted.\"\n\nMaster Gengsang said, \"A wild bee cannot transform a bean caterpillar; a Yue chicken cannot hatch the egg of a swan goose—yet a Lu chicken surely can. Chickens and chickens do not differ in their virtue, but in their capacity. Some can, some cannot—such is the inherent disparity in their endowment. Now my endowment is meager and insufficient to transform you. Why not journey south to see Laozi and entrust your learning to him? To 'entrust your learning' is to receive instruction. In seeking these words, you wish to attain what Master Gengsang has taught.\"\n\n\"All possess human form, and their hearts, ears, and eyes are the same—thus I say I do not know their difference. Each person has this heart, yet the mad cannot grasp it, just as the blind and deaf have nothing to see or hear. 'Separate' means 'open.' My form and another’s form are both open and unobstructed, yet I am now divided by desires. I seek the heart with the heart, yet it becomes ever more elusive. Thus it is said, 'desiring to seek one another, they cannot attain one another.' I strive to seek the heart but cannot grasp it, and now you tell me not to let my thoughts and cares flutter about. If I diligently apply myself to seek the Dao, might I yet attain understanding?\"\n\nNanrong Chu spoke thus without resolution, and Master Gengsang, wishing to guide him further but having exhausted his words, directed him to see Laozi. Thus he said, \"My words are exhausted\"—a humble pretense, not truly at the end of his speech. The wild bee is a small bee; the bean caterpillar, a large worm in the bean. The Yue chicken is small, the Lu chicken large, and the swan goose a great bird. The small bee cannot enchant the large worm; the small chicken cannot brood the large egg—this illustrates that his power is too slight to transform you.\n\nThereupon, Nanrong Chu carried provisions and traveled seven days and seven nights until he reached Laozi’s abode. Laozi said, \"Have you come from the land of Chu?\"\n\nNanrong Chu replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nLaozi said, \"Why have you come with so many others?\"\n\nNanrong Chu, startled, looked behind him. Laozi said, \"Do you not understand what I mean?\"\n\nNanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and sighed, saying, \"Now I have forgotten my answer and lost my question.\"\n\nLaozi said, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nNanrong Chu said, \"If I am ignorant, people call me foolish; if I am wise, it only brings sorrow to my body. If I am unkind, I harm others; if I am kind, it only brings sorrow to myself. If I am unrighteous, I injure others; if I am righteous, it only brings sorrow to me. How can I escape this? These three concerns are what trouble me. I wish to ask you about them through my journey from Chu.\"\n\nLaozi said, \"A moment ago, I saw it in the space between your brows, and thus I understood you. Now you speak again, clinging to your words as if bound by rules, like a child clinging to its parents, or raising a pole to seek the sea. You are lost indeed—so bewildered!\"\n\nYou wish to return to your true nature yet find no way in—how pitiable! Chu, just now you appeared alone, yet I took you for one who had come with the crowd. This is precisely what the Śākya meant when he said, \"Your mind is in turmoil.\" \"I forgot my answer and so lost my question\"—this speaks of a heart so lost it cannot even frame question or answer.\n\nCast off your knowledge, and others will call you foolish. *Zhu* means \"fixed\" or \"exclusive\"; *zhu yu* is like *zhuan hua*, \"obtuse.\" If you still cling to intention, employing cleverness only burdens your body. This is why one cannot remain without intention, yet cannot remain with it either—just as the Śākya said, \"How is it?\" \"It cannot be otherwise.\" The dilemma of benevolence and righteousness is the same as the three concerns; the doubt is one and the same.\n\nWhen I saw the space between your brows, I already knew you had not yet grasped the Dao. Now, hearing your words, I see it is indeed so. Thus I say: \"You speak again, clinging to your words as if bound by rules\"—*guigui* describes a cramped, shallow demeanor. \"Raising a pole to seek the sea\" means seeking the formless in the formed, wandering without anchor. A *lost person* is one who has strayed from their original heart; *wǎngwǎng* describes the sorrow of one who cannot find themselves.\n\n\"You wish to return to your true nature yet find no way in\"—this means you long to perceive the natural Dao yet cannot attain it. How pitiable!\n\nNanrong Chu then asked to stay in Laozi’s lodging. He summoned what he loved and cast off what he hated. After ten days of sorrow, he saw Laozi again.\n\nLaozi said, \"You have cleansed yourself—how thoroughly! Yet though you are heavy with gloom, within you still brim with vitality. But there is still aversion. Those who are fettered externally cannot be seized by multiplying restraints; those who are fettered internally cannot be seized by entangling bonds. Those who are fettered both internally and externally cannot be held by the power of virtue, let alone those who wander without the Dao.\"\n\n\"Summoning what you love\" means seeking what is right; \"casting off what you hate\" means shunning what is wrong. Yet with love and aversion still present, your heart remains confused—hence ten days of sorrow. *Shú zāi* (how thoroughly!) is like *shú yǔ* (how long!), meaning your effort has been prolonged. *Yùyù hū* expresses the unsettled mind, not yet at peace.\n\nHere your cleansing has been thorough—how thorough! Yet where aversion lingers, the heart clings, and thus the inner vitality still brims. *Vernacular note*: *Vernacular* (韄) means binding an object with leather; *jian* (揵) is the bolt of a door. Both are metaphors for grasping and restraint. When one responds to external things and seeks to regulate oneself, the constraints multiply and cannot be grasped. With externals unsettled, one then turns inward, hence \"will internally bolt.\" When the heart’s turmoil seeks self-regulation, it becomes entangled and cannot be grasped. With internals unsettled, one then turns outward again. This describes those who study the Dao yet fail to grasp its essence: whether attempting to control externally or internally, they find no foothold. In such a state, even the virtue one possesses cannot be held—how much less those who wander without the Dao?\n\n\"Wandering without the Dao\" means following the principle of naturalness. Only the perfected person can follow naturalness.\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"In my village, there is a sick man. When villagers ask about his illness, the sick man can describe his symptoms—yet his illness is still not severe. If I, having heard the great Dao, am like one who drinks medicine only to worsen his illness, then I wish only to hear the *Classic of Preserving Life*.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The *Classic of Preserving Life*—can you embrace the One? Can you avoid losing it? Can you know fortune and misfortune without divination? Can you stop? Can you cease? Can you abandon others and seek within yourself? Can you be unburdened? Can you be guileless? Can you be like a child?\n\nA child wails all day without hoarseness—such is the perfection of harmony. A child grasps all day without cramping—such is the fullness of its power. A child gazes all day without blinking—its focus is not external. It walks without knowing its destination, rests without knowing its purpose, flows with things and moves with the current. This is the *Classic of Preserving Life*.\"\n\nWhen the sick man is still able to describe his symptoms, his illness is not yet severe. When illness becomes severe, he can no longer speak. Now, I wish to hear the great Dao yet do not know where I am afflicted—my confusion is profound. Though you offer teachings, they only deepen my bewilderment, like drinking medicine that worsens the illness. Thus, I dare not ask for instruction and wish only to learn the way of preserving life.\n\n\"Embrace the One\" means preserving wholeness and purity. \"Avoid losing\" means safeguarding what is received from Heaven without loss. \"Knowing fortune and misfortune without divination\" means that the way of utmost sincerity can foresee all. \"Can you stop?\" means can you settle? \"Can you cease?\" is what the Buddhists call \"great rest.\" \"Abandon others and seek within\" means focusing inward rather than outward. \"Unburdened\" describes being without encumbrance. \"Guileless\" describes being without knowledge. \"Can you be like a child?\" means not losing the heart of an infant. \"Wailing\" means crying.\n\nThe throat is the gullet. A hoarse voice is a dry throat. An infant wails and cries without its voice growing hoarse, for it has no deliberate intent and thus does not harm its harmony. \"Clasping\" means the inability to extend. When a person’s hand is clenched for too long and then stretched, there will inevitably be obstruction. An infant, however, is not like this—its nature is spontaneous, and all are alike in this. This is virtue.\n\nThe eyes gaze without blinking, though they see nothing; they are unaware of external things. To know of external things is to be partial. Blinking is the same as moving—one does not know where one dwells or what one does, which is to say, one is without intent. \"Compliant and yielding\" means following and adapting. Whether moving or at rest, one moves in accord with things, flowing like a wave. To be of the same wave is to go along with things in this way, and thus one may take this as the constant principle of preserving life. Therefore, it is called \"the warp of preserving life.\"\n\nNan Rong Chu said, \"Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?\"\n\n\"No,\" was the reply. \"This is what is called the melting of ice and the thawing of frost. As for the perfected person: they eat and associate with others on earth and take joy in the heavens. They do not entangle themselves with the gains and losses of people and things, nor do they conspire with others in strangeness, nor do they scheme together in affairs. They come and go with ease, guileless and unburdened. This is called 'the warp of preserving life.'\"\n\n\"Then is this perfection?\"\n\n\"Not yet. I have already told you: can you be like a child? A child moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes. Its body is like the branch of a withered tree, and its heart is like dead ashes. In such a state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune. Without misfortune or fortune, there is no aversion to the calamities of others.\"\n\nChu asked about the warp of preserving life, seeking what comes next. Upon hearing Laozi’s words, so wondrous, he then asked about the virtue of the perfected person. This question arose naturally, but Laozi again said, \"No,\" for he feared Chu would cling to this and make it a fixed pattern—what the Buddhists call \"taking the provisional as real.\" \"The melting of ice and the thawing of frost\" means liberation and spontaneous awakening. \"Eating and associating with others on earth\" means being the same as others; \"taking joy in the heavens\" means being in accord with the heavens.\n\n\"To 'associate' means to be together, to be the same, to mingle and interact—this is to be strange, to be different. It is not to scheme, for there is no heart of calculation; it is not to act, for there are no traces of deliberate action. It is further said: this is the warp of preserving life. The above speaks of the perfected person, but here it speaks of preserving life—thus what is called the Way of preserving life is precisely the affair of the perfected person. Viewed in this light, the earlier 'No' was clearly not the whole truth. Chu, having heard this, then asked, 'Then is this perfection?'—meaning that this Way is the ultimate Way. Yet Laozi again said, 'Not yet.' Since he said 'Not yet,' there should have been another topic, but instead he returned to the earlier words, 'Can you be like a child?'—thus this 'Not yet' was also not the whole truth.\n\n'Without misfortune or fortune' means to transcend beyond misfortune and fortune. 'The calamities of others' refers to the afflictions of worldly concerns. If I have already transcended beyond misfortune and fortune, then I have departed far from the world—how could I still have the afflictions of the worldly realm? To say 'No' and to say 'Not yet' is not to wish to speak exhaustively, but to allow him to awaken on his own. The Chan school often employs this method of explanation.\"\n\nThe one whose cosmic vastness is settled emits celestial radiance—this emission of celestial radiance is seen by others as the person they perceive. Those who possess cultivation are now constant; those who are constant are abandoned by others yet assisted by Heaven. What others abandon is called the Heavenly People; what Heaven assists is called the Son of Heaven.\n\nThe scholar studies what they cannot study; the practitioner practices what they cannot practice; the debater debates what they cannot debate. To know the limit of what one cannot know is perfection. If there is any deviation from this, the celestial balance will disrupt it.\n\nFrom this point onward, Zhuangzi broadly expounds the ultimate principle.\n\n\"Cosmic vastness\" refers to the chest. When one is serene and settled, celestial radiance manifests—this is sincerity becoming illumination. Thus it is said, \"The one whose cosmic vastness is settled emits celestial radiance.\" Once celestial radiance is emitted, though others see them as merely human, they have already merged with Heaven.\n\n\"Those who possess cultivation\" refers to those who cultivate the real. When those who cultivate the real reach the point where celestial radiance is emitted, they become constant. Constancy means enduring permanence—this is the utmost sincerity extending into eternity. When utmost sincerity reaches eternity, Heaven assists them, and others gather to them—abandonment becomes dwelling, gathering becomes return. The Heavenly People are the people of Heaven.\n\nThe speaker is no ordinary person. The Son of Heaven is one whom Heaven cherishes as its child. Learning, conduct, and eloquence all leave traces—these are what one can learn, what one can practice, what one can debate. What cannot be learned, cannot be practiced, cannot be debated is the natural. When one’s knowledge reaches its limit at what cannot be known and stops there, this is the ultimate of creation. Thus it is said, \"It is the utmost.\"\n\nHeaven’s balance refers to creation. \"Not being this\" means not being so. *Ji* (就) means to align. Not being so is the opposite. To be opposite is to lose the principle of creation’s spontaneity. *Bai* (败) means to lose. To prepare things to sustain form, to conceal the unexpected to nurture the mind, to revere the center to reach the external—if one is thus, then all the myriad evils that arrive are from Heaven, not from man, and are insufficient to disturb one’s completion. They cannot enter the numinous terrace.\n\nThe numinous terrace is that which holds yet does not know what it holds, and that which cannot be held. \"Preparing things\" means preparing the principles of the myriad things. The myriad things are all prepared within me. \"Sustaining form\" means following the spontaneity of one’s life. \"Not anticipating\" means not calculating, not deliberating. Retreating to conceal oneself in the place of non-deliberation, the mind’s response to things arises spontaneously—this is what the Buddhists call \"not abiding yet giving rise to the mind.\" \"Preserving within\" means that reverence then responds externally without obstruction—this is the meaning of \"reverence to straighten the internal, righteousness to square the external.\" *Da* (达) means to penetrate. *Bi* (彼) refers to what is external. \"The myriad evils\" are matters that do not go as one wishes. When one’s own creation has already reached this point, yet the myriad evils still arrive, this is truly Heaven’s doing, not a failure of human affairs sufficient to disturb the perfect virtue within my breast. Thus it is said, \"All are from Heaven, not from man,\" and are insufficient to disturb the completion of the numinous heart. External things do not enter the mind, so they do not disturb its completion.\n\n\"Having hold\" means having something to rely on. \"Not knowing what it holds\" means that though there is something to rely on, one does not know what it is—this is transformation through the great. \"Cannot be held\" means that if there is something to hold onto, one has not yet transformed. These three instances of *chi* (持) are most subtly expressed and must not be read carelessly.\n\nIf one does not see their sincerity yet acts, every action is inappropriate; if one enters into karma yet does not relinquish it, every change leads to loss, to wrongdoing. Is this not wrongdoing in the manifest? In the hidden, even spirits can condemn it as wrongdoing. Only when one is enlightened about spirits can one act alone. These several sentences further explain that those who do wrong have not yet perfected themselves yet act presumptuously. Presumptuous action means every affair is inappropriate; karma has already entered their midst, and though they know it, they cannot relinquish it—these are the shame of transgression and the commission of wrongs. *Geng* (更) means to change. Shame over transgression and the commission of wrongs lead to constant changes, each revealing greater error. Thus it is said, \"Every change leads to loss.\" *Ye* (业) does not mean \"affair\"; today, people say *ye* (业) as in \"already\" or \"karma,\" meaning it has already become one’s conduct. Such a person’s actions are not good. If no one condemns them, then spirits will censure them. This means that between the hidden and the manifest, there is nowhere to escape. If one knows that the hidden and the manifest are to be feared, then one can be cautious in solitude. Thus it is said, \"Only when one is enlightened about man and enlightened about spirits can one act alone.\" This is the same as \"Nothing is more concealed than the hidden, nothing more manifest than the subtle\"—therefore the noble person is cautious in solitude. \"Acting alone\" is being cautious in solitude. These several phrases could be included in the classics.\n\nThose within the contract act without seeking fame; those outside the contract aspire to extravagant expenditure. Acting without seeking fame is only the common that has radiance. Aspiring to extravagant expenditure is only the merchant’s way. People see them standing tall, like eminent figures, yet when they are exhausted by things, things enter them. Those who contend with things cannot even contain themselves—how can they contain others? Those who cannot contain others have no affection; those with no affection cut off all people.\n\nThose within the contract seek what is within their allotted portion—this is what Mencius called \"seeking and obtaining it, seeking within.\" \"Without fame\" means that no one can name it. Those outside the contract seek externally. Those who labor externally set their aspirations only on resources for expenditure—this is seeking for self-benefit. Only the common has radiance: *yong* (庸) means constant, *guang* (光) means constant radiance. Abandoning the self to seek externally, aspiring to profit—this is the mindset of merchants. Thus it is said, \"Only the merchant’s way.\"\n\n*Qi* (跂) is the appearance of standing tall. People see their external wealth or nobility surpassing others and think them eminent and worthy of respect, yet they do not know that they are bound to things, beginning and ending with desire, until they are exhausted and come to an end. Thus it is said, \"When they are exhausted by things, things enter them.\" *Qie* (且) means \"barely.\" Chasing after things, barely seeking to obtain, even to the point of endangering themselves without regret—thus it is said, \"Those who contend with things cannot even contain themselves.\" How can they contain others with a heart that cannot contain others? In the extreme, even relatives and kin are estranged and abandoned. Thus it is said, \"Those who cannot contain others have no affection; those with no affection cut off all people.\"\n\nNo weapon is sharper than the will. The *moye* sword is inferior to it. No greater bandit exists than yin and yang, from which there is no escape between Heaven and Earth. If not for the harm of yin and yang, then the mind causes it. The will is the mind’s attachment. All attachments can harm oneself, but none is sharper than the will—it is even more harmful than the *moye* sword. Thus it is said, \"No weapon is sharper than the will; the *moye* sword is inferior to it.\" The qi of yin and yang can both harm people, like bandits. Yet if this mind is peaceful and harmonious, how can yin and yang cause harm? Thus it is said, \"If not for the harm of yin and yang, then the mind causes it.\" This is what is meant by \"Its heat scorches like fire, its cold congeals like ice.\" These two sentences are excellent for the work of the heart’s learning—this saying is most apt.\n\nThe Dao penetrates their allotment. Its completion is its destruction. What is detestable about allotment is its division; what is detestable about preparation is its having preparation. Completion and destruction are two matters, yet from the perspective of the Dao, they are one. Thus it is said, \"The Dao penetrates their allotment.\" Once the human mind is divided into self and other, in its selfishness it must seek completeness. Thus it is said, \"Its allotment is for preparation.\" All things return to nothingness, yet those who selfishly seek completeness only seek being. Those who know the Dao detest this. Thus it is said, \"What is detestable about preparation is its having preparation.\"\n\nThus, to emerge without returning is to see its demonic aspect; to emerge and attain is called attaining death. That which responds to the external and can return to the internal becomes virtue; with virtue, one can be spirit-like and heaven-like. To pursue the external without knowing return is to sink into demonic realms. Thus it is said, \"To emerge without returning is to see its demonic aspect.\" The Śākya tradition speaks of \"demonic den calculations\"—this is precisely it. Without right or wrong, this heart-mind remains ever alive; clinging to right and wrong without transformation, this heart-mind becomes dead. \"To emerge and attain\" refers to being enslaved by the external and attaining self-righteous views. *Equalizing Things* says, \"A heart-mind near death cannot return to yang\"—this is the meaning here.\n\nExtinction yet possessing substance is one with the demonic. By means of the formed, one models the formless and thereby establishes it. \"Substance\" is the true principle within heaven and earth. Without the heart-mind, there is emptiness; emptiness is substance. If one extinguishes it with selfish intentions and takes the existent as substance, then that person is the same as the demonic. Thus it is said, \"Extinction yet possessing substance is one with the demonic.\" Demonic realms and sinking into delusion all arise from the selfish heart-mind extinguishing principle, coveting and clinging to existence while unaware of true emptiness and real being. If one can regard the formed as if it were formless, then principle is established. \"Model\" means semblance. The Śākya tradition says, \"One may empty all that exists, but must not reify what does not exist\"—this is the meaning here.\n\nEmerging without root, entering without aperture—substance exists yet without place.\nEmergence is birth, the origin from which the myriad things arise. Though never without root, it cannot be known; thus it is called \"without root.\" Entry is death, the end toward which the myriad things proceed. Though one knows where it ends, one does not see where it enters; thus it is called \"without aperture.\" True principle, though existent, cannot be sought in any particular direction; thus it is called \"without place.\"\n\nHaving duration yet without root or end—what has substance yet no place is space; what has duration yet no root or end is time. There is life, there is death, there is emergence, there is entry. In entry and emergence, no form is seen—this is called the Gate of Heaven.\n\nThe following explains the three sentences above:\nPrinciple remains the same across past and present, through thousands and tens of thousands of years; thus it is said, \"having duration.\" Yet its beginning and end are not seen; thus it is said, \"without root or end.\" \"Root\" is the origin; \"end\" is the conclusion.\n\nLaozi said: \"Empty yet not exhausted, in movement ever more emerges. Though what emerges is inexhaustible, its aperture cannot be exhausted—this is the emptiness of its aperture. Emptiness is precisely what makes it substantial; thus it is said, 'what has substance yet no aperture'—emergence and entry are one. This explains the character 'entry,' yet it speaks of 'emergence,' revealing its meaning: space encompasses the four directions, above and below. The Dao has no fixed place; all directions, above and below, are it. Thus it is called 'space'—as when the kite soars in the sky or the fish leaps in the abyss, illustrating the scrutiny of above and below. Past and present are called 'time'; the Dao’s coming and going through thousands and tens of thousands of years, ever thus, is time. Life is emergence; death is entry. In life and death, emergence and entry, all have their source, yet no form is visible—this is the marvel of creation. The Gate of Heaven is creation, spontaneity. Because it speaks of emergence and entry, it follows with the character 'gate.' The Gate of Heaven is Nonbeing. The myriad things emerge from Nonbeing. Being cannot make itself be; it must emerge from Nonbeing. Yet this Nonbeing is itself a Nonbeing. Thus it is said, 'Nonbeing, one Nonbeing.' *Qiwu* speaks of 'being and nonbeing,' and 'that which has never yet begun to be nonbeing'—this is the same meaning. 'Hiding' means retiring and concealing in secrecy. The sage’s heart conceals itself in Nonbeing; thus it is said, 'hiding therein.'\n\nThe knowledge of the ancients reached its utmost. How far did it reach? To the point of regarding things as never having begun to exist—this is the utmost, the limit, beyond which nothing can be added. Those next in order regarded things as existing, taking life as a defense and death as a return—thus they divided themselves. Those next said, 'At first there was Nonbeing; then there was life. Life suddenly becomes death. Taking Nonbeing as the head, life as the body, and death as the tail—who knows the unity of being and nonbeing, life and death? I would make friends with such a one.' These three, though different, belong to the same clan. The Zhaos and Jings became prominent through office; the Jias became prominent through enfeoffment. Though not one, they are all the noble clan of Chu. The above speaks of the three as different yet belonging to the same clan, but in the text below, it is said 'not one'—tying it together, this refers to the unbroken body of life and death above. These are the subtleties of the text.\n\nHaving life is *qian* (darkening). To assertively say 'this is it' is to have spoken of what should not be spoken. Yet it remains unknowable. *Qian* is a blemish, like the blackness at the bottom of a cauldron, or a defect—an analogy for the coagulation of qi. The qi of heaven and earth coagulates to form humans; this is the illness of primordial qi. Earlier it spoke of life as the muttering of qi—this is the same meaning. Human life arises from the same qi, yet people forcibly divide it. Thus it is said, 'assertively'—*pi* means division. Once there is division, each clings to their own; clinging to their own, each takes their own as right, and what is called 'right' shifts. Shifting means instability. This one calls it right, that one calls it right—this is shifting. The meaning is the same as in *Qiwulun*, yet it coins the term 'shifting right.' 'What should not be spoken' means it is not fitting to speak of it. To speak of 'shifting right' is, for people, always improper; all speech is self-serving. Though each person has their own 'right,' what they take as right is unstable. Thus it is said, 'though unknowable.'\n\nThe sacrificial victim at the *la* festival has its tripe and trotters—it can be dispersed yet cannot be dispersed. The *la* is the winter sacrifice. The tripe is the cow’s omasum; the trotters are the feet, parts of the sacrificial animal. When the sacrifice is made, the four limbs and five viscera are all dispersed and arranged on the cutting board. To call it 'dispersed' is to say the sacrificed nature is originally one thing; to call it 'indispersible' is to say the five viscera and four limbs are already separated in the cauldron and on the board. This is like what people call 'right'—shifting and unstable. The five viscera are represented by the tripe; the four limbs, by the trotters—this is the literary method.\n\nObserving a house, one circles the bedchamber and ancestral temple, then proceeds to the resting place—this is to illustrate 'shifting right.' Within a single house, there is the bedchamber, the ancestral temple, and a place for repose; though their locations differ, to call them 'bedchamber,' 'temple,' or 'resting place' is to refer to the same house. Yet to call it a 'house' is to acknowledge the distinctions of bedchamber, temple, and resting place—just like the instability of 'shifting right.' These two sentences are analogies for 'shifting right.' 'Illustrate' means 'all.' Observing the *la* sacrifice and the house, what they take as right is all shifting, an unstable 'right.' Thus it is said, 'to illustrate shifting right.'\n\nLet me speak of 'shifting right': taking life as the root, knowledge as the teacher, thereby riding upon right and wrong, indeed producing names and realities, thereby making oneself the standard, causing others to take one’s own restraint as their model, and even dying to repay that restraint. If so, then to act is to be wise, not to act is to be foolish; to penetrate is to be renowned, to be blocked is to be shamed—this is the 'shifting right' of people today. The cicada and the owl are the same in their sameness.\n\nAbove, it has already concluded one section, then raises the term 'shifting right' again, saying: 'taking life as the root.' Once there is the word 'right,' one takes life as the root, takes one’s own knowledge as the teacher, and thereafter rides upon right and wrong—who is truly named? Who is truly real? Thus it is said, 'indeed producing names and realities.' 'Indeed' means it is not necessarily so. 'Standard' is the root. Using one’s own teacher as the root, one desires others to follow one’s own restraint. Thus it is said, 'making oneself the standard, causing others to take one’s own restraint as their model.' Only because of this self-serving does the contention of right and wrong arise; though one may die to repay it, one willingly does so.\n\nThus it is said, \"repaying with death for one’s restraint\"—the term *restraint* below arises from the term *restraint* above. Precisely because of this, in the moments of acceptance or rejection, success or failure, distinctions of wisdom and folly, honor and disgrace emerge. The people of this age are all those who \"shift right.\" Thus it is said, \"those who shift right are the people of today.\" *Thorough* means penetrating. The cicada and the owl both mock the great Peng, just as those who \"shift right\" do not recognize the scholar of the utmost Dao and ridicule him—their vision and understanding are the same as the cicada and the owl. The cicada and the owl are alike, and people are likewise the same as the cicada and the owl; thus it is said, \"the same in their sameness.\" This is stirring, exhortative prose.\n\nIf one treads on a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one apologizes with humility; if an elder brother treads on his younger brother’s foot, one merely soothes him; if a parent treads on their child’s foot, not even soothing is needed. Thus it is said: \"In the utmost ritual, there is no 'other'; in the utmost righteousness, there is no 'thing'; in the utmost wisdom, there is no scheming; in the utmost benevolence, there is no partiality; in the utmost trustworthiness, gold is set aside.\" These several lines form another distinct point. When one treads on a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one must apologize with humility to avoid their anger. If an elder brother treads on his younger brother’s foot, one merely soothes him, without apology, for their bond is close and requires no thanks. *Great kinship* refers to parents. If parents tread on their child’s foot, even soothing is unnecessary—their intimacy is such that mutual trust is innate.\n\n\"In the utmost ritual, there is no 'other'\" means that in the highest ritual, the distinction between self and other is forgotten, and formalities are abandoned. \"In the utmost righteousness, there is no 'thing'\" means that in the highest righteousness, one does not rely on external things to measure what is fitting. \"In the utmost wisdom, there is no scheming\" means that no deliberation is needed. \"In the utmost benevolence, there is no partiality\" means that no trace of preferential love is visible. \"In the utmost trustworthiness, gold is set aside\" means that no material pledge is required. *Set aside* is pronounced *bìng*, meaning to discard. The analogy of treading on feet is set forth for the five virtues of ritual, righteousness, wisdom, benevolence, and trustworthiness that follow.\n\nObstruction of the will, delusion of the mind, encumbrance of virtue, and blockage of the Dao—wealth, honor, prominence, fame, and profit are the six obstructions of the will; appearance, movement, countenance, principle, qi, and intent are the six delusions of the mind; aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are the six encumbrances of virtue; departure, approach, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability are the six blockages of the Dao. If these four sets of six are not stirred within the breast, then one is upright; if upright, then still; if still, then luminous; if luminous, then empty; if empty, then one acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone. *Thorough* is synonymous with *remove*. *Prominence* means splendor; *stern* means imposing. *Obstruction of the will* means these six can disorder one’s resolve. *Movement* refers to physical action; *principle* refers to verbal reasoning. *Delusion of the mind* means these six can entangle and bind the mind. *Encumbrance of virtue* means that when emotions prevail, they burden one’s innate truth. *Knowledge* refers to discernment; *ability* refers to talent. *Blockage of the Dao* means obstruction of the Dao. *Stirred* means disturbed. Removing these four sets of six harms—obstruction of the will, delusion of the mind, encumbrance of virtue, and blockage of the Dao—ensures that the breast is not disturbed. This is where one applies effort in cultivation.\n\nThe Dao is what virtue reveres; life is the radiance of virtue; nature is the essence of life. The movement of nature is called *action*; its deviation is called *loss*. Knowledge is encounter; wisdom is planning. What the wise do not know is like a sidelong glance. *Reveres* means to uphold and respect. *Life* is the manifestation of virtue; when manifested, it shines with brilliance. *Nature* is what resides within us; *essence* means its original state. When nature moves, action arises; when action flows into human artifice, it becomes a loss of nature. *Encounter* means response. *Planning* means strategy. Responding to encounters and engaging in planning are both expressions of the knowledge inherent in nature. The meaning of these terms differs from their usage in the *Analects* and *Mencius*; when reading Zhuangzi, one should read Zhuangzi and not be bound by rigid interpretations. The infant’s gaze, seeing yet seeing nothing, is called a *sidelong glance*. The wise, claiming knowledge of what they do not know, are like infants glancing sidelong—this embodies the idea of \"the wise act without contrivance.\" All actions should arise from necessity, which is called *virtue*; this is forgetting the self. Within this forgetting of the self, there is yet nothing that is not the self—this is the unmanifest within form and the manifest within the unmanifest.\n\nYi was skilled at hitting the mark but clumsy at making others free of his praise; the sage is skilled at following Heaven but clumsy at dealing with people. Only the complete person can be skilled at following Heaven and adept at dealing with people. Only creatures can be creatures; only creatures can follow Heaven. How much more should the complete person despise the Heaven of others and despise the humanity of others—how much more should one despise one’s own Heaven and one’s own humanity?\n\n*Mark* means subtlety; hitting the target with such subtlety is called *hitting the mark*. Yi’s inability to prevent others from praising him is like the sage’s inability to escape the world’s fame. *Skilled at following Heaven* means fully embodying the Dao of Heaven. *Adept at dealing with people* means concealing oneself among people. *Adept* is pronounced *liáng*, meaning good or capable. The *complete person* is one of complete virtue.\n\nWhen a sparrow comes near Yi, he is certain to catch it—such is his power. If the world is made into a cage, then sparrows have nowhere to escape. Thus, Tang used a kitchen servant to enclose Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to enclose Baili Xi. Therefore, if one does not use what they love to enclose them, there is nothing that can be obtained. The *obstinate* are those who cast off external praise and blame; the *cautious* are those who, even when climbing high, do not fear, and who disregard life and death.\n\nYi’s shooting ensures that when a sparrow appears, he will catch it—the sparrow also fears him. When the monkey sees Yang Youji, it clings to a tree and wails; the meaning is the same. If the world is made into a cage, then all sparrows are within it, and there is no need to shoot them. The main point does not lie with Yi but serves to introduce the following sentence.\n\nTo return and repeat without offering is to forget others; forgetting others is to thereby become one with Heaven. *Return* means to turn back, like the *Book of Changes*’ \"turning back of the Dao.\" *Repeat* means familiarity. *Not offering* means not giving to others. Thus, one who is revered yet does not rejoice, or insulted yet does not anger, is only one who harmonizes with the harmony of Heaven. When anger arises from non-anger, then anger emerges from non-anger; when action arises from non-action, then action emerges from non-action. To desire stillness, one must calm the qi; to desire spirit, one must follow the mind. These are actions. To desire appropriateness, one must adhere to necessity; the path of the sage lies in this necessity. Revering me yet not rejoicing, insulting me yet not angering—this is what is meant by \"though the whole world praises them, they are not encouraged; though the whole world blames them, they are not discouraged.\" *Harmony of Heaven* is the harmonious qi of creation.\n\nTo be one with...\n\nTo be one with the *Harmony of Heaven*—though anger emerges, it is not anger, for such anger arises originally from non-anger, a spontaneous anger without the mind’s intent. This single phrase illustrates the next: the perfected person acts in the world without harboring intent, so though they act, it is non-action. What they enact arises originally from non-action, which is the non-action that leaves nothing undone. The phrasing shifts again: to desire stillness, one must calm the qi, for if the qi is not calm, stillness cannot be attained. To preserve the spirit whole, one must follow the mind without resistance, for the slightest disturbance to the mind disrupts the spirit. In all action, to achieve appropriateness, one must arise from necessity—this necessity is a response without intent. Responding to affairs without intent is the Way of the sage. Thus it is said, \"Necessity is the path of the sage.\" How does this passage differ from the Inner Chapters? Some say the Outer Chapters are coarse while the Inner Chapters are refined—this is mistaken.\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Seven\n<*Masters Section, Daoist School, Zhuangzi Kouyi*>\n\nThe *Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*: *Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Eight\nBy Lin Xi Yi of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: \"Xu Wugui\" (Chapter Twenty-Four)**\n\nXu Wugui, through Nü Shang, was granted an audience with Marquis Wu of Wei. The marquis greeted him, saying, \"Master, you must be weary—enduring the toils of mountain and forest, yet still willing to meet with this lonely one.\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"I am weary on your account. What weariness have you endured for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the true nature of your life and destiny will sicken. If you suppress your desires and restrain your likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will suffer. I weary myself for you—what weariness have you endured for me?\"\n\nMarquis Wu, startled, made no reply. After a moment, Xu Wugui continued, \"Let me tell you: I judge dogs. The lowest kind stops when full—this is the virtue of a wildcat. The middling kind gazes fixedly like the sun. The highest kind seems to have forgotten its singular nature. Indulging desires and prolonging likes and dislikes severs the principle of life and destiny; abandoning desires and likes and dislikes abruptly disrupts the constant function of ears and eyes—both are sickness. *Kan* (掔) is pronounced as *pan*, meaning to pull back. *Lide* (狸德) refers to a dog of the lowest grade, whose nature is like that of a wildcat. The phrase 'gazes fixedly like the sun' describes unwavering focus, eyes unblinking. 'Its singular nature' means its life is as if dead. Thus, it is said to have 'forgotten its singularity'—like a wooden chicken, motionless. This is the highest grade.\n\nYet judging dogs is not as good as judging horses. A straight horse meets the plumb line; a curved one, the hook; a square one, the carpenter’s square; a round one, the compass—these are the state’s horses. But they do not compare to the world’s horses. The world’s horses possess innate talent—like a plumb line, yet seeming lost; like having forgotten their singular nature. Such horses surpass all, leaving no trace, their destination unknown.\"\n\nMarquis Wu was greatly pleased and laughed.\n\n\"When a horse meets the rules of plumb line, carpenter’s square, hook, and compass, it means every part of its body conforms to principle—these terms are borrowed from geometry and need not be taken literally. 'Innate talent' refers to natural endowment. 'Like a plumb line, yet seeming lost' describes a state of deep absorption. 'Forgotten its singularity' is the same as 'lost its singularity.' 'Destination unknown' means it moves without knowing where it halts. All these are metaphors. Marquis Wu grasped the meaning of effortless spontaneity and was thus greatly pleased, laughing.\"\n\nWhen Xu Wugui departed, Nü Shang asked, \"Master, how did you alone delight our lord?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"How I delight my lord: when admonishing him, I use the *Book of Poetry*, the *Book of Documents*, ritual, and music; when guiding him, I employ the *Golden Tablets* and the *Six Strategies*. Those who serve him and achieve great merit are too numerous to count, yet my lord has never once opened his mouth. How did you delight him so that he was pleased like this?\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"I simply told him how I judge dogs and horses.\"\n\nNü Shang said, \"Is that all?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue? After a few days away from their state, they rejoice upon seeing acquaintances. After a month, they rejoice upon seeing those they once knew in their homeland. After a year, they rejoice even upon seeing those who merely resemble their countrymen. Is it not true that the longer one is parted from others, the deeper the longing grows? Those who flee into the emptiness of the wilderness stumble over brambles and trip over stumps, following the paths of shrews and weasels. Yet when they hear the sound of human footsteps, they are overjoyed. How much more so when it is the voices of brothers and kin at their side?\"\n\nLong indeed has it been since the words of a true person echoed at our lord’s side!\n\nThe *Gold Tablets and Six Bow-Cases* refer to the *Military Methods of the Grand Duke*. This text is stored in the court, hence called \"gold tablets,\" much like books kept in golden coffers or stone chambers. The terms \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" describe its shifting, multifaceted strategies—they should not be rigidly equated with the *Book of Songs* or *Book of Documents*. \"Serving in attendance\" means serving the king’s affairs. Since the teachings of the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, and *Six Bow-Cases* have proven effective in practice, it is said that \"serving in attendance has brought great merit.\" \"Parting the lips\" means to smile.\n\n\"Exiles\" are those who have fled their state. \"Acquaintances\" are old friends. \"Those once seen\" are merely familiar faces. \"Those who resemble people\" are those who look like their countrymen. \"Paths in the mountains\" are called \"the trails of shrews and weasels.\" \"Obstructed\" means blocked. *Liang* (踉) is pronounced *lang*; the *Sheng* chapter says it describes the appearance of wanting to move. *Wei* (位) means to dwell or stop, indicating exhaustion—wanting to move but stopping, crouching in the valley. \"Empty valley\" refers to a desolate ravine. Hearing the sound of footsteps brings joy, for it is the presence of a person, not necessarily an acquaintance or countryman. This suggests that Marquis Wu’s innate truth had been lost for so long that hearing such words was like one fleeing through an empty valley hearing footsteps—hence his joy. This is what Chan Buddhists call \"a long journey returning home.\"\n\n*Qingkai* (謦欬) refers to the sound from the throat.\n\nWhen Xu Wugui met Marquis Wu, the marquis said, \"Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating acorns and chestnuts, spurning onions and leeks—yet you have long honored me with your presence. Are you now old and desiring the taste of wine and meat? Or is it that I, too, possess the good fortune of the altars of soil and grain?\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"Wugui was born in poverty and lowliness and has never dared to partake of your lordship’s wine and meat. I have come to trouble you.\"\n\nThe marquis asked, \"How so? In what way do I trouble you?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"I trouble your lordship’s spirit and form.\"\n\nThe marquis asked, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"The nurturing of Heaven and Earth is such that ascending high cannot be made permanent, nor can dwelling low be made brief. Yet you alone, as the lord of ten thousand chariots, exhaust the people of an entire state to nourish your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. The spirit does not permit this. The spirit favors harmony and detests perversity, for perversity is sickness. Thus, I trouble you—what sickness afflicts you?\"\n\nThe marquis said, \"I have long wished to see you, Master. I wish to love the people and practice righteousness, to lay down arms—is this possible?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"No. Loving the people is the beginning of harming them. Practicing righteousness and laying down arms is the root of raising arms. If you proceed thus, you will likely fail. All achievements, whether good or bad, are instruments. Though you practice benevolence and righteousness, you will verge on hypocrisy. Form inevitably produces form; change inevitably arises from what is external. You must not array fine cranes between the ornate towers, nor keep swift steeds in the palace of carved eaves. Do not store rebellion in your gains. Do not seek to overcome others with skill, nor with schemes, nor with war. Those who kill people, those who seize others’ lands—do they nourish their private desires and spirits through war? Who can say which is better, victory or defeat? If you, my lord, cannot desist, then cultivate sincerity within your heart to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not disturb the people’s deaths—thus you will be freed. What need will you then have to lay down arms?\"\n\nRejection and dismissal are one and the same—both mean abandonment. Nurturing means giving life, and all who live between Heaven and Earth are of this same nature. Thus it is said: the nurturing of Heaven and Earth. Each and every one is alike. Ascending heights does not make one tall, nor does dwelling below make one short—there is no analogy of noble or base. That which nurtures externally is form, yet within the heart there is no self-contentment; thus it is said: the spirit does not permit itself. Harmony means harmonizing with things and becoming one with them. Selfishness arises from the private self. The spirit within me, received from Heaven, is fundamentally one with the myriad things. Desires and selfishness harm this unity—this is what it abhors. To abhor selfishness is to sicken the spirit. If you, my lord, suffer from this sickness yet do not recognize what ails you, how can I seek to trouble you? Thus it is said: I would trouble you only regarding what afflicts you. To intend to love the people is the very origin of harming them; to intend to lay down arms is the very origin of wielding them—this is peril. Acting with such a heart, you will see only danger and achieve nothing. The completion of good or evil always leaves traces; thus it is called an instrument. To act with a heart set on achievement and to engage in affairs that leave traces is to miss the transformation that transcends such things. Thus it is said: form inevitably produces form—it is fixed. To fix the heart in one place without transformation is to invite conquest, resentment, and desire to arise, wounding what is within. Thus it is said: completion inevitably gives rise to conquest, and change arises from what is external, disordered by external things.\n\nWhen the heart contends with things, it is called \"external warfare.\" The crane formation resembles the fish-scale array—both are names of battle formations. Foot soldiers are infantry; swift steeds are cavalry. The *Li Qiao* is the gate of palace towers; the *Zi Tan* is the site of sacrificial altars. The ancients performed sacrifices in the roadside chamber, meaning within the palace. The intent is this: if a ruler’s heart engages in struggle with things, then even within a single chamber, all appears as if infantry and cavalry array themselves in battle before him, with nothing but a realm of contention. This is what the Śākya meant by \"all is created by the mind.\"\n\nTo gain is to lose—gaining is a favorable circumstance, losing an adverse one. Without gain, there is no loss. Thus it is said: \"Do not store up adversity in gain.\" The following line—\"gain is also clever cunning\"—refers to the machinations of the heart. Schemes arise from cleverness, and warfare arises from schemes. Seeking victory over others through this, even if one slays their people and seizes their land to gratify one’s private desires of ear and eye, though one may appear victorious, one does not realize that one’s own breast is disturbed by things. The form contends with the spirit; though outwardly victorious, the spirit is wearied. To triumph over others while exhausting one’s own spirit—where lies the gain or loss? Thus it is said: \"One does not know which is better.\" How can this be called victory? Thus it is said: \"Where lies the evil of victory?\" It lies in not being oneself. The ruler should not act thus. Simply cultivate one’s original sincerity to respond to the natural reality of Heaven and Earth, and do not clash or conflict with things. This is victory without contention. If I can achieve victory without contention, the people will escape death and each attain life—what need is there to seek disarmament?\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor was about to visit the Great Wei on Mount Juci, Fang Ming drove his chariot, Chang Fang rode as the outrider, and Zhang Ruo, Xi Peng, Kun Hun, and Hua Ji followed in the rear carriage. Arriving at the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all became lost, with no one to ask for directions. They happened upon a boy herding horses and inquired of him. The boy said, \"Do you know Mount Juci?\" \"Yes,\" they replied. \"Do you know where the Great Wei resides?\" \"Yes,\" he said. The Yellow Emperor exclaimed, \"How extraordinary! This young boy not only knows Mount Juci but also knows where the Great Wei resides. Allow me to ask about governing the world.\" The boy said, \"Governing the world is no different from this. What more is there to do?\" \"When I was young, I roamed within the Six Directions, but I suffered from a disorder of confusion. An elder taught me, saying, 'If you ride the chariot of the sun and roam the wilds of Xiangcheng, your illness will slightly improve.' Now that my illness has somewhat healed, I am about to roam beyond the Six Directions. Governing the world is no different from this—what more is there to do?\" The Yellow Emperor said, \"Governing the world is indeed not your concern. Nevertheless, allow me to ask about governing the world.\" The boy declined. The Yellow Emperor asked again, \"How does governing the world differ from herding horses?\" The horse-herder replied, \"It is merely a matter of removing what harms the horses.\" The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, called him the \"Teacher of Heaven,\" and withdrew.\n\nThe Seven Sages refer to the Yellow Emperor, Fang Ming, Chang Fang, Zhang Ruo, Xi Peng, Kun Hun, and Hua Ji—all these names are allegorical. To take the Great Wei as the \"great Dao’s ruggedness\" is a forced interpretation. *Mao* means blurred vision. \"Riding the sun\" means advancing with the sun, that is, daily renewal. To say that within the Six Directions one has not departed from things is to suffer from self-inflicted confusion. To be able to depart from this illness and roam in spontaneity is to be beyond the Six Directions. The meaning is that governing the world is the same—simply free from entanglement within the realm of things. \"Not your concern\" means you are a person beyond things; though you need not partake in this, you must still explain it to me. Horses are herded in groups, each following water and grass. Simply follow their nature and cause them no harm, and the way of herding horses is complete. This is also the meaning of herding sheep by driving them from behind. \"Teacher of Heaven\" means that the heavens and humans can be one’s teachers.\n\nScholars who lack the transformations of thought are not joyful; debaters who lack the order of discourse are not joyful; inspectors who lack the affairs of scrutiny are not joyful—all are confined by things. The transformations of thought refer to the hundred kinds of mental shifts; the order of discourse means that speech attains coherence; *ling* means overbearing, *sui* means interrogation. Those who delight in scrutiny contend with others over the smallest details. All three follow their strengths and take pride in them, so that a single day without them brings no joy. These are people ensnared by the desires of things. Thus it is said: \"confined by things.\"\n\nThose who summon the world serve in the court; those who honor the common people glory in office; those of physical strength boast of difficulty; the brave delight in peril; warriors rejoice in war; the withered and emaciated cherish fame; legalists expand governance; those who respect appearances value propriety and benevolence; and those who esteem connections prize relationships. \"Summoning the world\" means rising to stand in the court; \"honoring the world\" refers to those who establish their reputation through their descendants—these are the vain. \"Common people\" are the mediocre; \"glory in office\" means taking rank and salary as honor. \"Physical strength\" refers to those with talent and ability; \"boasting of difficulty\" means taking the resolution of crises as a source of pride. \"Brave\" are warriors; \"delighting in peril\" means rejoicing in danger. The withered and emaciated are recluses; \"cherishing fame\" means being preoccupied with reputation. \"Legalists\" are those of the legalist school; \"expanding governance\" means seeking to manage many affairs. \"Respecting appearances\" means maintaining a dignified demeanor as external adornment; \"esteeming connections\" means valuing social relations.\n\nFarmers without the affairs of tilling and weeding are not content; merchants without the affairs of markets and streets are not content. The common people have their daily occupations and thus encourage the hundred crafts; artisans have the skill of tools and thus take pride. \"Tilling and weeding\" refers to the work of cultivation; \"markets and streets\" refer to the affairs of commerce. \"Daily occupations\" means accumulating surplus day by day; \"encourage\" means delighting in and applying oneself. Artisans take pride in their abilities. Without the accumulation of wealth, the greedy worry; without the prominence of power, the boastful grieve. The more extreme the circumstances, the greater their joy in change. The boastful and deceitful flock to power; a single setback brings them sorrow. *You* means extreme; the desire for ever-increasing prominence. Those who rely on something are called *shi*; those who accumulate are called *wu*. The flocking followers are those who attach themselves to the gates of the rich and powerful. They delight in change, taking deceit as pleasure. Petty men who attach themselves prefer activity over stillness, often serving as retainers in households, for only through action can they achieve their ambitions. Thus it is said: \"Those who rely on power and things delight in change.\" From this point onward, the passage on \"not being joyful\" shares the same meaning, merely varying in length and phrasing.\n\nWhen circumstances call for action, one cannot remain inactive—all this is merely following the sequence of the seasons, not freely transforming through the changes of things. They exhaust their physical nature, submerged in the myriad things, never returning to themselves throughout their lives—how lamentable!\n\n\"When circumstances call for action\" means that the times compel them, leaving their own bodies unfree; though they may wish to practice non-action, they cannot. It is like the growth and completion of all things within a year, each following its proper order. What changes and transforms is not freely determined by the things themselves. Thus it is said: \"following the sequence of the seasons, not freely transforming through the changes of things.\" This phrase serves as a metaphor for the preceding statement. \"Not freely transforming through the changes of things\" means that the transformations are not self-determined by the things.\n\n\"Exhausting their physical nature\" means wearing out their bodies and minds. \"Submerged in the myriad things\" means being engulfed, drowned in the midst of the ten thousand things, spending their entire lives without knowing how to return. \"Return\" here is akin to the Buddhist expression \"turning the light inward to illuminate oneself.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"An archer who hits the target without aiming beforehand is called a skilled archer—could all under heaven then be Yi?\" Huizi said: \"They could.\" Zhuangzi said: \"If there is no universally accepted standard under heaven, and each takes their own as correct, could all under heaven then be Yao?\" Huizi said: \"They could.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Then, with the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, Gongsun Long, and you, that makes five—who is truly correct? Or is it like Lu Ju?\" Lu Ju’s disciple said: \"I have grasped the Master’s Dao! I can warm a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer.\" Lu Ju said: \"This is merely summoning yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Dao. Let me show you.\" Thereupon, he tuned two zithers, placing one in the hall and one in the inner chamber. When he struck the *gong* note on one, the *gong* note on the other resonated; when he struck the *jiao* note, the *jiao* note responded—such is the harmony of sound. But if one alters a single string so that it does not correspond to any of the five notes, and then strikes it, all twenty-five strings will vibrate. Though this differs from the resonance of *gong* answering *gong* or *jiao* answering *jiao*, is the ruler of sound not still bound to the strings? How is this different from summoning yin with yin and yang with yang? Yet Lu Ju considered himself superior to his disciple, each taking their own as correct and rejecting the other’s truth. Is this not the same as Huizi’s position?\n\n\"Aiming beforehand\" means having a designated target. Only with a target can one demonstrate skill. If one shoots without a target, then all who hit it would be Yi. This phrase serves as a metaphor for the following statement, and its phrasing is most ingenious. Since there is no single, universally accepted standard under heaven, and each holds to their own, then all could be Yao.\n\nYang refers to Yang Zhu; Gongsun Long is Gongsun Long. The Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, Gongsun Long, and Huizi make five—since their teachings differ, who is truly correct? In the cold of winter, to warm a cauldron without fire, or in the heat of summer, to make ice without water—such defiance of the seasons seems impossible. Yet on the winter solstice, yang qi has already begun to grow, and on the summer solstice, yin qi has already begun to grow. Summoning yang with yang can dispel winter’s cold, and summoning yin with yin can alleviate summer’s heat. Though it appears to defy the seasons, there is a principle by which they can be summoned. Thus it is said: \"This is not what I call the Dao,\" meaning their technique is not yet refined.\n\n\"Placing\" means setting down. One zither is set in the hall, another in the inner chamber. Though they are far apart, when one is struck, the other responds—*gong* answering *gong*, *jiao* answering *jiao*—because their sounds are the same, as in the principle of resonance. But if one adjusts a single string so that it does not correspond to any of the five notes, and then strikes it, even the distant twenty-five strings will vibrate. This is more difficult than *gong* answering *gong* or *jiao* answering *jiao*. Yet, in principle, whether *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, or *yu*, all are sounds responding to sounds, and none depart from the resonance of the strings’ notes. Thus it is said: \"Though they have not begun to differ from sound.\" How is this different from summoning yin with yin and yang with yang? Lu Ju took himself to be superior to his disciple, each insisting on their own correctness and rejecting the other’s truth. Is this not the same as Huizi’s position?\n\nHuizi said: \"Now, the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Gongsun Long all contend with me in debate, opposing my words, overpowering me with their arguments, and never conceding that I am wrong—what is to be done about this?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"A man of Qi entrusted his lame son to Song to serve as a gatekeeper, not expecting him to fully guard the gate or seek a *xing* bell, but merely to bind and restrain him in seeking a lost child—yet he never left the domain and still lost something. The man of Chu who was exiled and served as a gatekeeper fought with the boatman in the dead of night when no one was around. Though he never left the cliff, he still managed to incur resentment.\"\n\n\"Opposing my words\" means contending with language. \"Overpowering me with their arguments\" means subduing with reputation. \"Never conceding that I am wrong\" means ultimately insisting on their own correctness.\n\n*Zhi* (蹢) is pronounced like *zhi* (掷), and in the *Shuowen*, it means \"to halt the foot.\" A *zhi* son is one who cannot walk. The man of Qi entrusted his lame son to Song, thinking he could serve as a gatekeeper. To guard a gate, one need not be whole—thus, he considered himself correct. Yet when he sought a *xing* bell, he realized the need to bind and restrain him. Why value things over one’s own child? He had never considered himself wrong. A *xing* bell is a small bell. *Tang* refers to loss. To seek a lost child only within one’s own domain is delusion—yet he never considered himself deluded. This final phrase, \"still lost something,\" does not relate to the preceding *zhi* son. *Yi* (遗) means \"to omit,\" and *sì* () means \"to resemble.\"\n\nThese three matters all slightly resemble the followers of Hui Shi, Yang Zhu, and Mo Di—hence the saying, \"there are omissions and resemblances.\" This is akin to the earlier statement, \"if so.\" Yet though it does not culminate in resentment, what precedes it first gives rise to entanglement—precisely the artistry of composition.\n\nConsider the lodger: in Chu, there was a lame gatekeeper sent abroad who could not return on his own. He boarded a boat to come back, and just as they reached the shore in the dead of night, he quarreled with the boatman, forgetting the kindness that had carried him across—thus turning gratitude into enmity. The bank was near; the boat had not yet left the shore, so this was no case of long neglect. *Zhi* means \"to halt the foot\"—a man with a lame foot who served as a gatekeeper, hence called the *zhi*-gatekeeper. In their nighttime quarrel, he surely believed himself correct. Yet when dawn came and he saw clearly, could he feel no shame? During their fight, he too took himself to be right.\n\nThese several lines all employ analogies to mock Hui Shi’s self-righteousness. But because Hui Shi loved debate, Zhuangzi crafted these cunning and elusive words—some too obscure to grasp at once—to confound him. Such was the playful banter between the two in life. One may compare this to Dongfang Shuo’s disputes with his retainers, which share a similar spirit.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi passed by Hui Shi’s grave during a funeral procession, he turned to his followers and said: \"A man of Ying daubed his nose-tip with white clay as thin as a fly’s wing and had Carpenter Shi shave it off. Carpenter Shi swung his axe with such force that the wind whistled, yet he sliced away every trace of clay without harming the nose. The man of Ying stood perfectly still, his composure unshaken. When the Lord of Song Yuan heard of this, he summoned Carpenter Shi and said, 'Try it for me.' The carpenter replied, 'I once could do it—but the one who stood as my target has long been dead. Since the Master’s passing, I have had no one to work with, no one to converse with.'\"\n\n*E* is white clay; he daubed his nose-tip with it, so thin it resembled a fly’s wing, then had Carpenter Shi pare it away. \"Swinging the axe with force\" describes the swiftness of his stroke. The clay was removed without harming the nose—cleaving was difficult enough, yet the man’s steadiness was even harder. This was the very ground for skill. The meaning is this: only with Hui Shi’s eloquence could I exhaust my arguments; now that he is dead, there is no one left to engage with.\n\nWhen Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him, \"Your illness has grown grave—can it not be said that it has reached a critical stage? If it worsens further, where should I turn?\"\n\n\"When asked to whom he would entrust the state, Guan Zhong replied to the Duke, 'Whom do you desire?' The Duke said, 'Bao Shuya.' Guan Zhong said, 'He will not do. His character is pure and upright, a fine gentleman. Toward those who fall short of him, he does not associate; moreover, once he hears of a man’s faults, he never forgets them for life. If he were to govern the state, above he would constrain his lord, below he would oppose the people. The people would offend him, and their punishment would not be long in coming.'\n\nThe Duke said, 'Then who is suitable?'\n\nGuan Zhong replied, 'If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do. His character is such that above he forgets his rank, below he distances himself from subordinates. He feels shame at falling short of the Yellow Emperor, yet pities those who fall short of him. To divide among others by virtue is called sageliness; to divide among others by wealth is called worthiness. To rule over others with worthiness has never won men’s hearts; to humble oneself before others with worthiness has never failed to win them. In the state, there are things he does not hear; in his household, there are things he does not see. If you must choose, then Xi Peng will do.'\n\nTo entrust the state is to entrust the governance of the state. *Not associating* means not frequently counting a man’s faults. *Constrain* means to bind and restrict. *Oppose* means to force the people with ritual and righteousness. All these phrases describe his tendency to distinguish too sharply between black and white. *Above he forgets his rank* means he forgets his own position. *Below he distances himself* means he keeps his distance and makes no demands of his subordinates. *Distances* means to separate. *To divide among others by virtue* means virtue descends to embrace the common people. *To divide among others by wealth* means not to be selfish. *To rule over others with worthiness* means to monopolize reputation and pride in one’s superiority. *There are things he does not hear, things he does not see* means he is not overly scrutinizing. This account does not appear in other texts and is found only in the *Liezi*—it is but an allegory, a saying meant for me. Thus it is said, 'Can it not be said that it has reached a critical stage?'\"\n\nThe King of Wu floated upon the river and ascended the Mountain of Monkeys. The troop of monkeys, seeing him, in alarm abandoned their fruits and fled into the dense thickets. There was one monkey, however, that moved with leisurely grace, leaping and grasping at branches. Seeing how skillful the king was at archery, it swiftly caught the arrows he shot. The king commanded his attendants to hasten and shoot together. The monkey, though nimble, could not match their combined strength and was killed. As it died, it was seized, and turning to its companions, it said with a grimace, \"This monkey trusted in its skill, relied on its agility, and scorned me—thus it has met its doom! Take heed! Alas, do not let your demeanor grow arrogant toward others!\"\n\nYan Buyi returned home and studied under Dong Wu to uproot his haughty bearing. He forsook pleasure, renounced honor, and after three years, the people of the state praised him.\n\nLater, Nanbo Ziqi sat leaning against his table, gazing upward and sighing. Yan Chengzi entered and said, \"Master, you are the most extraordinary of men—can your form truly be made like withered bones, your heart like dead ashes?\"\n\nZiqi replied, \"Once I dwelt at the mouth of Shansong. At that time, when Tian He caught sight of me, the people of the state all congratulated him. I always took the lead, and thus they knew me; I always made myself known, and thus they acclaimed me. Had I not shown myself, how could they have known me? Had I not made myself known, how could they have acclaimed me? Alas, I grieve for those who lose themselves, and I grieve even more for those who grieve for others’ grief. Since then, with each passing day, I have drawn farther away.\"\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, the King of Chu offered him wine. Sun Shu’ao stood holding the goblet, while Shinan Yiliao received the wine and poured a libation, saying, \"The ancients spoke thus...\" and then declared, \"As for me, Qiu...\"\n\nHave you not heard of the speech that speaks not? Has it never been spoken of here? When Shinan Yiliao juggled his pellets, the feud between the two houses was resolved; when Sun Shu’ao slept sweetly, holding his feather fan, the men of Ying cast down their weapons. I, Qiu, would wish for a beak three feet long—what they call the Dao that is not the Dao, this is what they call the eloquence that speaks not.\n\nThus virtue gathers where the Dao is one, and speech ceases where knowledge reaches its limit. The Dao is one, yet virtue cannot equal it; what knowledge cannot know, eloquence cannot express. Names like \"Confucian\" or \"Mohist\" bring only misfortune. Thus the sea does not refuse the eastward flow—such is the utmost of greatness. The sage embraces heaven and earth, bestowing blessings upon the world, yet none know his name. Therefore, in life he bears no rank, in death he receives no posthumous title; he does not amass wealth, nor does he establish a name—this is called the Great Man.\n\nA dog is not deemed good for its fine barking, nor a man for his fine words—how much less so for greatness? To be great is not enough to be called great—how much less so for virtue? Greatness is complete, none surpassing heaven and earth. What is there to seek? And yet greatness is complete. One who knows completeness seeks nothing, loses nothing, discards nothing, does not alter himself for things. Turning back to himself, he is inexhaustible; following antiquity, he does not wear thin. Such is the sincerity of the Great Man.\n\nThe ancients, ah!\n\nHere, these words suggest that while drinking wine, one may engage in lively conversation—even the ancients did so. The Master replied: \"I possess words that go unspoken, which I have never shared with others. Now, in this moment, I speak of juggling balls and playful matters. Holding a feather fan, one may sleep sweetly, harboring no intent to act. You two have already mastered the art of non-action—what need have you for me? The one with a three-foot beak speaks of having no such long beak. The deeds of Yiliao and Shu’ao differ from the historians’ accounts—these are but allegories. The Dao’s unity is natural. Virtue is attainment, what resides within oneself. What belongs to the unity of creation differs from what is made by man. Thus it is said: virtue cannot be the same. Observe how this term *virtue* differs from the *attainment* found elsewhere in this book. Names like those of the Confucians and Mohists are not the unspoken discourse—hence it is called inauspicious. None know his lineage; the people have no way to name him. *Not amassing* means that though one may possess goodness, one does not claim it for oneself. Even the worthy do not regard eloquence as ability—how much less the Great Man? To bear the name of greatness is insufficient to be called great—how much less can the natural virtue be named? *Great completeness* is great perfection. Only through seeking nothing does one lose nothing, discard nothing, and not alter oneself for things—this is because the self is nobler than things. *Following antiquity* means proceeding in accord with the ancient Way. *Not wearing thin* means not forcing oneself.\"\n\nGongsun Qi had eight sons. When he arrayed them before him, he summoned Jiufang Yin and said, “Examine my sons for me and tell me which is auspicious.” Jiufang Yin replied, “Kun is auspicious.” Gongsun Qi started in surprise and joy, asking, “In what way?” Jiufang Yin said, “Kun will share the ruler’s table and feast for the rest of his life.” Gongsun Qi sighed deeply and wept, saying, “What has my son done to reach such an extreme?”\n\nJiufang Yin said, “One who shares the ruler’s table brings blessings to three generations—how much more to his parents? Now, sir, you hear this and weep—this is to reject fortune. Your son is auspicious, but you are not.” Gongsun Qi said, “Yin, how could you understand that Kun is auspicious? His fortune will be exhausted in wine and meat, entering only his nose and mouth. How could you know its origin? I have never herded sheep, yet ewes were born in the inner chamber; I have never hunted, yet quails hatched in the secluded corner. Why should this be strange? What I share with my sons is to wander in Heaven and Earth. With them, I roam in joy beneath Heaven; with them, I roam in sustenance upon the Earth. I do not engage with them in affairs, nor plot with them, nor marvel with them at anomalies. With them, I ride the sincerity of Heaven and Earth without allowing things to clash with them. With them, I drift and meander without engaging in affairs—this is as it should be. Yet now there is a recompense from the vulgar world.\n\nWhenever there are strange omens, there must be strange conduct—perhaps this is not the fault of my sons and me, but Heaven’s doing. That is why I weep.”\n\nBefore long, Kun was sent on a mission to Yan, where bandits seized him on the road. To sell him whole would be difficult, but to cut off his foot would be easy. So they severed his foot and sold him in Qi, where he happened to end up on Duke Qu’s street. There, he ate meat for the rest of his life and died.\n\nWine and meat entered his nose and mouth, yet he never knew whence they came—how could one say he had truly gained anything? *Zang* means a ewe; *ao* means the southwest corner.\n\nThe northeast corner of a room is called *yao*. Never tending flocks nor tilling fields, yet this creature suddenly arose within the chamber—how strange an affair! This is meant to illustrate that my sons and I sought nothing from the world; how could we have obtained such unexpected joy from Heaven? To follow Heaven and delight in oneself—this is to be nourished by the earth without other desires. To serve the world is to serve; to scheme for oneself is to scheme. When one serves the world and schemes for oneself, it becomes a perversion of the natural Dao. Yet I have never done this with my sons, for we are without intention toward the world.\n\nThus it is said: we do not engage in its affairs, we do not partake in its schemes, we do not share in its anomalies. To drift and meander is to follow the natural course. We do not seek to respond to affairs, nor do we know whether affairs are fitting or not—hence it is said, “we do not engage in its affairs as they should be.” *Chang* means to repay a debt. While I delight in non-action, their association with me and the lord’s shared table means that within the allotment of our fate, this worldly debt remains unpaid. Such is the mutual strangeness of these omens.\n\nMy sons ought not to have received this—what comes must harbor some discordant anomaly. Thus it is called “strange conduct.” Duke Qu’s street refers to a gate facing the thoroughfare, where he served as a gatekeeper. This passage further speaks of how human affairs may yield the unexpected—such is destiny.\n\nWhen Nie Que encountered Xu You, he asked, “Where are you going?”\nXu You replied, “I am fleeing from Yao.”\nNie Que said, “What do you mean?”\nXu You answered, “Yao, with his boundless benevolence, makes me fear he will become a laughingstock to the world and later generations. When people devour one another, the common folk are not hard to gather. If you love them, they draw near; if you benefit them, they come; if you praise them, they are encouraged; but if you bring about what they detest, they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, yet those who abandon benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who profit from them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness lacks sincerity and is but a pretense. The greedy, like birds and beasts, exploit it as a tool. Thus, when one man’s judgment is used to benefit the world, it is like a single slice—all under heaven is severed. Yao knows that worthy men benefit the world, yet he does not realize they also harm it. Only those who stand beyond worthiness understand this.\n\nIf you love them, they draw near; if you benefit them, they come; if you praise them, they are encouraged; but if you bring about what they detest, they scatter. Knowing these four, one can gather the people. Yet to bring about what they detest is not what they desire. If you impose what they detest, the people will not return. To follow their likes and dislikes in seeking their allegiance is to indulge in calculation. The practice of benevolence and righteousness is an external, deliberate act—hence it is said to lack sincerity. The greedy, like birds and beasts, may borrow the name of benevolence and righteousness for their own ends—hence it is said to be a pretense. A *mie* means a cut. A single *mie* is like a single slice. If one acts with intent to judge and control, using this to benefit the world, then the world’s pure and natural essence is all sliced apart. Only those who stand beyond worthiness—above the worthy—can see that those who act with intent to benefit the world instead harm it.\n\nThere are those who are *nuan shu*, those who are *ru xu*, and those who are *juan lou*. The *nuan shu* are those who study the words of a single master, then glow with private delight, self-satisfied, believing themselves complete—unaware that nothing has truly begun. Thus they are called *nuan shu*. The *ru xu* are like lice on a pig: they choose sparse bristles, thinking it a vast palace or great park; they nestle in the crooks of hooves, between teats and thighs, believing it a safe and advantageous dwelling—unaware that one day the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and wield fire, and they will burn together with the pig. This is advancing or retreating within bounds—what is called *ru xu*. The *juan lou* is Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, but ants long for mutton because mutton is rank. Shun had a rank nature, and the people delighted in him. Thus, when he moved thrice, he founded a city, and by the time he reached Deng’s ruins, a hundred thousand households had gathered. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from the barren land, saying, ‘I hope to receive his beneficent influence.’ Shun was raised from the barren land when his years were already advanced, his hearing and sight already dimmed.”\n\nThe so-called *juan lou* is one who cannot rest or return—this describes the self-satisfaction of shallow vision. Here, it satirizes those who delight in learning yet do not understand the words of the unknowing: \"There has never been a thing.\" They do not grasp the wonder of non-being. *Ru xu* refers to one who is mired and dependent, a person clinging to power and profit. *Shu lie* means the sparse bristles of a pig; *qu wei*, the crooks of its hooves; *gu jiao*, the area beneath the belly near the legs—this is like a beggar warming himself by a fire or leaning on an iceberg, for what one relies upon is not truly reliable. *Yu* means confining one’s heart within the bounds of wealth and honor without self-awareness. Thus it is said: advancing or retreating within bounds. *Juan lou* describes one who stoops and labors, tormenting himself. Its meaning is this: those who cultivate virtue believe themselves renowned, and the people flock to them, only to become a burden, toiling endlessly without respite. This is used to mock and ridicule emperors and kings.\n\n*Tong tu* means barren land, referring to the place where one first dwelled—an uninhabited waste. Thus the spiritual person shuns the multitude, for where the multitude gathers, there is no harmony; without harmony, there is no benefit, only self-harm. Embracing virtue and warming harmony to comply with the world—this is called the true person. With ants, they abandon knowledge; with fish, they gain strategy; with sheep, they abandon intention. The true person’s eyes see with the eyes, ears hear with the ears, and the heart reflects with the heart. In this way, their equilibrium is as level as a carpenter’s line, and their changes follow the natural course.\n\nThe true person of old awaited Heaven and did not impose human will upon it. In life, they gained it; in death, they lost it. In death, they gained it; in life, they lost it. Where the multitude gathers, it is where people converge. Without harmony, there is no benefit—only self-harm. Embracing virtue and warming harmony means nurturing one’s power without display; *yang* refers to inner warmth. Ants are the most insignificant creatures, yet even they cannot fully abandon knowledge. Sheep are the most foolish, yet even they cannot fully abandon intention. Only the true person is without knowledge, without intention. Thus it is said: with ants, they abandon knowledge; with sheep, they abandon intention. Fish in water are leisurely and content; the true person’s self-strategy is like that of a fish. Here, water is likened to the Creator, and the fish to the self.\n\nAnts and sheep seek sustenance externally and cannot be without desire, unlike fish. The true person’s heart, ears, and eyes are the same as others’, but they do not employ them with intention. Thus it is said: the eyes see with the eyes, the ears hear with the ears, the heart reflects with the heart. Their equilibrium is as level as a line, and their changes follow the natural course. They do not impose human will upon Heaven. In life, it may seem like gain or loss; in death, it may seem like gain or loss. They do not regard life and death as gain or loss, allowing whatever comes—whether life is called gain or death is called gain, whether death is called loss or life is called loss.\n\nMedicine is called by one name, yet its substance may be *jin*, *jie geng*, *ji yong*, or *shi ling*. At times, it serves as the emperor. What can be said of this? *Jin* is Sichuan aconite; *ji yong*, the seed of the fox nut; *shi ling*, the fungus *Polyporus umbellatus*. Physicians prepare medicines according to their use, each with its own purpose. The primary ingredient is called the emperor; the others, ministers—what is called medicine is in truth the same, differing only in weight according to use. This is like people in the world: when their time comes and they are employed, they are noble; when their time does not come, they are base. Yet in themselves, they are neither noble nor base. These few lines are extraordinary.\n\nGoujian relied on three thousand men in armor and shields, taking refuge at Mount Kuaiji. Only Fan Li knew how to preserve the state from ruin; only Fan Li did not know how to spare himself from sorrow. Thus it is said: the owl’s eyes have their use, the crane’s legs have their joints to be severed—how lamentable! Minister Fan Li enabled Goujian to avenge Wu from the brink of destruction, which was wise indeed, yet he did not realize that this would lead to his own demise. When Fan Li was first employed, he was the emperor of the medicine; when he was later killed, it was another time. The owl’s eyes are useful at night but not by day—this too depends on the time. The crane’s legs, though long, cannot be severed; if severed, they are no longer useful. This means the crane’s stance, with legs sometimes extended or bent, must also adapt to the time.\n\nThus it is said: when the wind passes over a river, it diminishes it; when the sun passes over a river, it diminishes it. If only the wind and sun were to remain together by the river, the river would not yet feel their encroachment. This is because it relies on its source. The wind and sun over the river both diminish the water, yet the river does not feel diminished because its source is long. Its source arises from the natural, so though things may diminish it, it remains untroubled. These five lines form a single idea: *zhi* means only; *qing* means to cause. It speaks of the wind and sun remaining together by the river without departing.\n\nThus water guards earth, the shadow guards the person, and things guard things—this is certain. Water and earth naturally intermingle; form and shadow naturally depend on one another, guarding without separation. Things guard things as water flows to the wet and fire seeks the dry—what is of Heaven inclines upward, what is of Earth inclines downward. *Shen* means certain, true. It speaks of an unchanging principle in the world, one that cannot be altered. From these three *shen* characters, one understands that in the seventh chapter, *yuan ming zhi shen* cannot be replaced with *pan*.\n\nThus the eyes’ reliance on brightness is perilous; the ears’ reliance on sharpness is perilous; the heart’s pursuit of things is perilous. All abilities within the organs are perilous. When peril accumulates, it cannot be remedied; calamity grows ever more concentrated. *Dai* means danger. To employ brightness with intention, to employ sharpness with intention, to pursue things with intention—none of these are the way to self-preservation. Thus it is said: all abilities within the organs are perilous. *Fu* refers to the organs; wisdom arises from the chest and organs, yet those who believe themselves capable are all in danger. Thus it is said: all abilities within the organs are perilous. *Bu ji* means insufficient. Once danger has formed, it is too late to change. *Zi cui* means ever-increasing. Its reversal follows from seeking merit; its fruition depends on long scheming. Yet people regard this as their treasure—is this not lamentable? Thus there are those who lose their states and slaughter their people without end, never questioning the cause.\n\nIts reversal comes from pursuing merit; *yuan* means to follow. Following the heart that schemes for merit will inevitably lead to self-destruction. *Guo* means inevitable. Those who scheme for the long term harden their hearts and do not change—all this harms the self, yet people delight in it as if it were a treasure. Thus it is said: people regard it as their treasure. From ancient times to the present, those who have lost their states or suffered punishment follow one another without end, all because they do not question this—meaning they do not follow the Way.\n\nThus, when the feet tread upon the earth, though they tread but little, they rely on what they do not tread to achieve breadth. Human knowledge is scant, yet only by relying on what they do not know do they come to know what Heaven intends. When a person walks upon the earth, the ground their two feet tread is but a small portion; if all the earth were shaved away, leaving only enough to hold the feet, walking would become difficult. To journey far, beyond what the feet tread, there must be ground the feet do not tread—only then can one travel great distances. *Tian* here also means \"to tread,\" and this sentence serves as a metaphor for the one below. How much can a person truly know? What they do not know is all of Heaven. If one does not rely on what they know but instead on what they do not know, then they know Heaven.\n\nTo know the Great Oneness, to know the Great Yin, to know the Great Eye, to know the Great Balance, to know the Great Square, to know the Great Faithfulness, to know the Great Constancy—this is perfection. The Great Oneness unites all; the Great Yin dissolves all; the Great Eye sees all; the Great Balance follows all; the Great Square embodies all; the Great Faithfulness verifies all; the Great Constancy upholds all.\n\nThe Great Oneness is the movement of creation and transformation—Heaven first divides creation from the One. Yin is quiescence; the Great Yin is ultimate quiescence. When quiescence reaches its extreme, there is nothing it does not dissolve—*jie* here is pronounced like \"crab,\" akin to what Buddhist texts call *vimokṣa* (liberation). The Great Eye sees broadly. The Great Balance is the great apportionment; *yuan* means to follow. The Great Square is the Great Void, without corners, a single undifferentiated whole—thus it is called the Great Square. To embody it: the Great Faithfulness is the principle of truth and reality. *Ji* means to decide; knowing this true principle, there is nothing left to doubt. The Great Constancy is the constancy inherent in all things; *chi* means to uphold. To uphold all things under Heaven is this single constant principle.\n\nWhen things reach their utmost, Heaven’s decree appears—thus it is said: \"Utmost, there is Heaven.\" When human affairs are exhausted, Heaven’s principle becomes manifest. Following the natural course, good and ill fortune, honor and disgrace, gain and loss—all their principles become visible—thus it is said: \"Following, there is illumination.\" Within darkness, there is always one who grasps the pivotal essence—this is what is meant by \"holding the reins and guiding the net.\" Thus it is said: \"In darkness, there is a pivot.\" The beginning of all things must have something that begins them. The *Qi Wu Lun* says: \"Without that, there is no self; without the self, there is nothing to grasp\"—this is the meaning of *bi* (\"that\"). Thus it is said: \"Beginning, there is that.\" That is the natural principle of creation. Whether called Heaven, illumination, pivot, or that—though it may be dissolved and known, it seems as though it cannot be dissolved or known. To say one does not dare to regard it as knowable or dissolvable is to truly know it. Only by taking the unknown as known does one attain true knowledge.\n\nIn questioning it—it cannot be bounded, nor can it be unbounded. It is slippery and real, unchanging from ancient times to the present, yet it cannot be diminished. Can this not be called a great discourse?\n\nWhy is this questioning? It is to resolve confusion. To dissolve confusion is to return to a state without confusion—this is the greatest absence of confusion. The questioner inquires into the principle of creation. To say, \"I wish to question the principle of creation,\" one cannot regard it as bounded, nor can one regard it as unbounded. *Xie* means stubborn; *hua* means to revolve. The wonder of creation is beyond grasp—ungraspable, it seems as though it were nothing, yet it is truly real. Thus it is said: \"Slippery and real.\" From ancient times to the present, there has only ever been one creation, never replaced, and its use is inexhaustible. How could it ever suffer the slightest diminution? Thus it is said: \"Unchanging from ancient times to the present, yet it cannot be diminished.\" Considering this principle, is this not a grand topic of discussion? *Yang* means to raise; *que* means to expound and debate. Why is this so?\n\nThis is the principle of creation—why not inquire into this principle of creation, and what doubt remains? Thus it is said: \"What confusion?\" Now, by means of this principle of non-doubt, one resolves the doubts of the world and returns once more to the ground of non-doubt, approaching thereby the state of great non-doubt.\n\nWhen Zhaozhou asked Nanquan about the Way of non-doubt, his intent was precisely these few words—indeed, it comes close. The two characters \"non-doubt\" were drummed forth by Zhuangzi, who then composed these several sentences to conclude the entire essay. Truly extraordinary! How does this essay differ from those in the Inner Chapters?\n\nIn the \"Miscellaneous Chapters,\" \"Zeyang\" (Chapter Twenty-Five): Zeyang was traveling in Chu when Yijie spoke of him to the king. The king had not yet met him. Yijie returned to Pengyang, who then saw the king. The king said, \"Why did you not speak to me of this Master?\" Pengyang replied, \"I am not the equal of Gong Yuxiu.\" Pengyang then asked, \"What does Gong Yuxiu do?\" He said, \"In winter, he spears turtles in the Jiang; in summer, he rests in the mountains. When someone passing by asked, 'This is my dwelling,' he replied, 'Yijie was already incapable—how much more so I? I am not the equal of Yijie.' Now, Yijie’s character: though lacking in virtue, he possessed knowledge. He did not esteem himself, yet through this, his interactions became dark and confused. In the realm of wealth and honor, rather than aiding others through virtue, he aided them through dissipation. The frozen borrow clothing in spring; the scorched revert to winter. Cold and wind—such is the nature of the King of Chu. His form is august and severe; in matters of punishment, he grants no pardon, fierce as a tiger. If not for flatterers and those of upright virtue, who could sway him? Thus, when the sage is in straitened circumstances, he causes his household to forget their poverty; when he prospers...\"\n\nHe causes lords and nobles to forget their ranks and emoluments, transforming their arrogance into humility toward all things. In his dealings with the world, he delights in the free flow of things while preserving himself. Thus, at times, without speaking, he offers others harmony through drink; standing beside them, he transforms them, bringing about the proper order between father and son—how could this not be so? Returning home, he remains in quietude, his influence effortless. His effect on others’ hearts is as distant as this. Hence it is said: As for Gongyue Xiu, his surname was Yang, his given name Pengyang, and his courtesy name Yang. Yijie once recommended Yang to the King, but he was not employed and returned home. \"This is my dwelling\" refers to his lack of a fixed abode. Pengyang was fond of advancement, so he used the words of a recluse to admonish him, hoping he would awaken on his own.\n\n\"Lacking virtue but possessing knowledge\" means not recognizing the principles of Heaven and relying solely on private cleverness. \"Spirit\" refers to what is natural within oneself. To be \"dark and confused in interactions\" in the realm of wealth and honor is to become obstinately attached, losing one’s original heart and no longer knowing the natural spirit within. Thus it is said, \"He did not esteem himself, yet through this, his interactions became dark and confused.\" In his dealings with others, rather than mutually cultivating goodness, he led them into a path of self-diminishment. Hence it is said, \"Rather than aiding others through virtue, he aided them through dissipation.\"\n\nThe following lines illustrate this: The frozen, upon receiving clothing, feel the warmth of spring; the scorched, upon receiving wind, feel the chill of winter. This speaks of how people should assist one another by using their surplus to relieve others’ deficiencies. Pengyang’s fondness for advancement was his deficiency, and my warning him to withdraw was like offering a fan to one scorched by heat or clothing to one freezing—it would benefit him.\n\n\"His form is august and severe\" means he relied on his power to overawe his subordinates. \"In matters of punishment, he grants no pardon, fierce as a tiger\" shows his lack of benevolence. \"To sway\" means to humble oneself. If not for flatterers and those of upright virtue, who could bend him to their will? Here, \"those of upright virtue\" refers to true petty men.\n\nThe following lines all speak of the sage who, though reclusive, harbors no desire for advancement or employment: Lords and nobles are exalted, yet he makes them forget their ranks and emoluments, humbling themselves to scholars and transforming their arrogance into humility. He exhausts the principles of all things to find joy for himself, hence it is said, \"In his dealings with the world, he delights in the free flow of things while preserving himself.\" In his interactions with others, he follows the principles of all things without obstruction, preserving his true nature and finding joy in it. Hence it is said, \"He delights in the free flow of things while preserving himself.\"\n\nThere is a teaching without words that can enlighten others, like offering them the purest harmony to drink—what the Buddhist scriptures call \"drinking the finest ghee.\" A glance conveys the Dao; a composed demeanor influences others’ intentions. Thus it is said, \"Standing beside them, he transforms them.\" As the *Book of Songs* says, \"That man—if he were to return and dwell at home...\" This line is inverted; the meaning is that if that man were to return home, the proper order between high and low, elder and younger would be established. Hence it is said, \"bringing about the proper order between father and son—how could this not be so?\" Returning home, his influence is effortless, hence it is said, \"he remains in quietude, his influence effortless.\" This means that whether at home or in his village, all is in harmony.\n\n\"His effect on others’ hearts is as distant as this\" means that people’s capacities differ so greatly. This refers to the vast difference between Gongyue Xiu’s heart and Pengyang’s. \"I am not the equal of Yijie\" means that Yijie was a flatterer, also fond of advancement. He recommended you to the King—how could I be like him? This expresses disdain for Yijie.\n\n[The line \"bringing about the proper order between father and son—how could this not be so? Returning home\" is a single sentence.]\n\nWhen the sage prospers, he weaves all things together, exhausting their unity without being aware of it—this is his nature. He moves and acts, taking Heaven as his teacher. Others follow and name him as such. Yet how can one who is troubled by knowledge ever find rest in their actions? How can they cease?\n\n\"Weaving together\" refers to the ceaseless interplay of yin and yang in creation. \"Unity\" means the fusion of the refined and the coarse. The sage comprehends the principles of creation, exhausting the wondrous unity of the refined and the coarse. He follows nature without being aware of it, hence it is said, \"this is his nature.\" \"Nature\" is what is natural. \"Moves and acts\" refers to activity and action. All activity and action return to the mandate of Heaven, taking nature as their master, hence it is said, \"taking Heaven as his teacher.\" \"Names him\" means to bestow a title. People follow the sage’s example and name him as such—what intention did the sage originally have? Hence it is said, \"Others follow and name him as such.\"\n\n\"Troubled by knowledge\" means that private cleverness gives rise to endless worries, with countless calculations. How many of these calculations can be realized? Hence it is said, \"their actions are rarely successful.\" If I intend to act but am hindered by fate, others are the same. Why is this? Because fate has its limits. \"How can they cease?\" refers to fate and limits. These two lines thoroughly explore the human condition, tracing all afflictions to the beginning of knowledge. If one knew what one does not know, there would be no worries.\n\nThus, the following uses the analogy of a beautiful mirror: One who is beautiful from birth is given a mirror; if not told, they do not know their beauty surpasses others. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, their joy is endless. Others’ fondness for them is also endless—this is their nature. The sage’s love for others is given a name; if not told, they do not know of his love for others. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, his love for others is endless. Others’ comfort in this is also endless—this is their nature.\n\nBeauty arises from ugliness; if not told of their ugliness, they would not know their own beauty. The distinction between beauty and ugliness, good and evil, is the source of worries. Hence it is said, \"Whether they know or do not hear, their joy is endless.\" Since I make no distinction between beauty and ugliness and interact with things without intention, others’ fondness for me is also endless—this is the principle of nature. The analogy of the beautiful mirror also extends to the sage’s love for others. The meaning is that if love for others becomes a name, it involves intention, and intention departs from the original true nature.\n\nGazing upon one’s old state and old capital brings joy. Even if nine-tenths of the hills, grass, and trees were to encroach upon them, the joy would remain. How much more so for what one sees and hears? A hundred-foot tower stands amidst the crowd. Ran Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring, adapting to all things without end or beginning, without limit or time. He merged with the transformations of things, becoming one with them—unchanging himself. He once abandoned this.\n\nReturning from a long journey to behold one’s old state and old capital must evoke a sense of joy—this speaks of the stirring of feeling. Even if, upon entering the old state, its people and things have changed, and the hills are overgrown with grass and trees, nine-tenths altered from former days, so long as a single part remains familiar, that joy persists. How much more so for one who seeks the Dao, who suddenly awakens to perceive what they have always seen and hear what they have always heard—all things in their original, inherent state? Could they not rejoice? This is what the Buddha meant by \"original face\" and \"native scenery\"—precisely this meaning. The hundred-foot tower is its highest point.\n\n\"County\" refers to the display of music; \"among the crowd\" means the interweaving of reed pipes and bells. Standing in so lofty a place, hearing the layered, alternating music, one may stir the ears and eyes of the common world. How much more so for the ancient sages, who followed the principle of emptiness, non-action, and naturalness, delighting in all things—how exalted was their station! The analogy of the ring’s center is that of emptiness. Without end, without beginning, end and beginning are as one. Without limit, without time, there is no past or present. \"Limit\" refers to the changes of seasons. \"Daily transforming with things\" means moving together with them, ever renewing. Yet what one attains remains unchanging—this is how it is put into practice.\n\n\"To abandon\" means to leave; \"why\" asks for what reason. It questions why worldly people do not cast off their habitual ways and return to the ultimate Dao. Ran Xiangshi was an ancient sage. To take Heaven as one’s teacher yet fail to truly follow Heaven is to be enslaved by things in one’s affairs. What can be done about this? The sage never begins with Heaven, never begins with man, never begins with a beginning, never begins with things. They move with the world without ceasing, their conduct complete yet not confined to any one path. How could it be otherwise?\n\nTang received Yi Yin as his charioteer, with Menyin Dengheng as his tutor, learning from his teacher without being bound by him, attaining the ability to follow transformations—this was his office in name. \"To take Heaven as one’s teacher yet fail to truly follow Heaven\" means to take naturalness as one’s model yet not be burdened by the name of naturalness, merely harmonizing with things. Thus it is said, \"to be enslaved by things.\" If one has intention in one’s affairs, what can be done? The moment there is intention in affairs, it is no longer natural.\n\nMan has action; Heaven has non-action. Not only are there no traces of action, but even the absence of action is absent. Thus it is said, \"never begins with Heaven, never begins with man\"—these are traces. \"Never begins with things\" means no traces of things. Not only are there no traces of things, but even the absence of traces is absent. Thus it is said, \"never begins with a beginning, never begins with things.\" Moving through this world, they are never apart from others in the human realm, never neglecting affairs. Thus it is said, \"they move with the world without ceasing,\" without neglect. All actions are complete yet not attached to any single one. Thus it is said, \"their conduct is complete yet not confined.\" *Equalizing Things* speaks of this as \"old and confined\"—\"confined\" meaning mired and drowned in attachment.\n\nTo be one with the Dao is to unite without seeking; if one seeks to unite with the Dao, it cannot be attained. Thus it is said, \"how could it be otherwise?\" In Tang’s case with Yi Yin, he studied under him and later made him his minister. Zhuangzi, however, altered the names and titles, calling his office \"Charioteer\" and saying \"Menyin Dengheng\"—these are merely such strange and deceptive words. \"Tutor\" means assistant; it speaks of Yi Yin assisting Tang. Though Tang took Yi Yin as his teacher, he was not confined by him.\n\nThus it is said: \"to follow a teacher yet not be confined.\" Tang’s non-action was such that he grasped the inherent principles of the myriad things and followed them, abiding in the realm of non-action and spontaneity. He allowed his assisting minister Yi Yin to bear the name of office, hence it is said, \"he attained their following and completion, appointing them to their names.\" This speaks of Tang’s non-action and Yi Yin’s action—Tang without name, Yi Yin with name. *Si* (司) means \"to preside\"; it speaks of Menyin bearing many names of action. These names are *ying* (嬴), a surplus, meaning \"excess.\" It is to say that such names in the world are superfluous, like \"long things.\" *Liang jian* (两见) means \"to see both,\" body and name as two. If one has intent toward making a name, one cannot attain the undifferentiated unity. Thus it is said, \"he attained their duality.\"\n\nYi Yin’s bearing of these names was not yet extraordinary, yet Confucius again admired him, exhausting his thoughts and plans to serve as an assistant in this world—this speaks of the Master desiring to do as Yi Yin had done. This is mockery of the sage. Rongchengshi borrowed the names of ancient sages. Combining three hundred and sixty days makes one year; if one removes them day by day, one can only call them \"days,\" not a \"year.\" Thus it is said, \"remove the days, and there is no year.\" This line is excellent. Laozi said, \"count the spokes, and there is no wheel\"—it is of the same meaning. The name of \"external\" arises from the \"internal\"; without the internal, there is no external. Thus it is said, \"without internal, without external.\" These two lines demonstrate the meaning of spontaneity.\n\nWei Ying (King Hui of Wei) made a pact with Tian Mou (King Wei of Qi), but Tian Mou betrayed it. Wei Ying, enraged, was about to send an assassin. Xishou, hearing of this, found it shameful and said, \"You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would follow the path of a commoner in seeking vengeance? Let me request two hundred thousand armored troops to attack him, capturing his people, seizing his oxen and horses, and making his lord’s back break out in boils. Only after he flees his state will I strike his back and break his spine.\" Jizi, hearing of this, found it shameful and said, \"To build a city wall seventy feet high, then tear it down—this is the suffering of penal laborers. Now, for seven years, there has been no war; this is the foundation of your rule. Yan (Xishou) is a disturber of order and cannot be heeded.\" Huazi, hearing of this, found it disgraceful and said, \"Those who speak well of attacking Qi are disturbers of order; those who speak well of not attacking are also disturbers of order. To say that both attacking and not attacking are disturbances—this is yet another disturbance. My lord, you should seek the Dao alone.\"\n\nWei Ying was King Hui of Wei; Tian Mou was King Wei of Qi. *Xumi* refers to those sentenced to penal labor, who suffer when a completed wall is torn down. Seven years without war was a fine achievement of the King of Wei, yet Xishou urged him to use troops, like tearing down a completed wall. Yan was Xishou’s name. Huazi’s words implied that any mention of \"attack\" involved intent, so all three were disturbers of order. With the Dao, one does not speak of troops at all. Thus it is said, \"My lord, you should seek the Dao alone.\"\n\nHuizi, hearing this, went to see Dai Jinren. Jinren said, \"There is a creature called the snail—do you know of it?\" The king said, \"Yes.\" Jinren continued, \"On the left horn of the snail is a state called Chushi; on the right horn is a state called Manshi. They often fought over territory, leaving tens of thousands of corpses, and pursued the fleeing army for fifteen days before returning.\" The king said, \"Alas! Are these empty words?\" Jinren replied, \"Let me make them real for you. In your mind, do the four directions, above and below, have limits?\" The king said, \"They are limitless.\" Jinren said, \"To roam the mind in the limitless and return to the state of passage—does it seem to exist or not?\" The king said, \"Yes.\" Jinren said, \"Within the state of passage is Wei; within Wei is Liang; within Liang is the king. Is there any difference between you and Manshi?\" The king said, \"There is no difference.\" The guest departed, and the king was lost in thought, as if something were missing.\n\nWhen the guest left, Huizi saw the king and said, \"That guest is a great man—even a sage is not his equal.\" Huizi said, \"Blowing into a pipe produces a sound, but blowing into a sword’s hilt produces only a faint *xue* sound. Yao and Shun are praised by people, but to speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint *xue* sound.\" This passage is excellent. Huizi, hearing Huazi speak of seeking the Dao, recommended Dai Jinren to the king. Dai Jinren was a man of the Dao. The snail’s horn analogy seems like empty words, but what follows makes it real. Thus it is said, \"Let me make them real for you.\" The limitless is the great void; the \"state of passage\" is the central kingdom. Viewing the central kingdom from the great void makes it seem tiny, as if existing or not. Thus it is said, \"Does it seem to exist or not?\" Du Fu said, \"Looking down, there is only qi\"—this is the same meaning. Viewing Wei from the central kingdom makes it small; Liang is its capital. Within Wei, the capital is even smaller; within the capital, the king’s person is even more minute. From the great void above, descending step by step, the king’s person and the snail’s Manshi and Chushi are no different. Thus it is said, \"Is there any difference?\" *Changran ruo you wang* means being lost in thought, realizing the insignificance of their conflict.\n\nA pipe has holes, like a flute or reed; though it lacks melody, blowing into it still produces a sound. But blowing into a sword’s hilt produces only a faint *xue* sound, meaning it is entirely without sound. This implies that before a man of the Dao, even speaking of benevolence, righteousness, the Dao, or principle would have no place for sound.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at the thatched hut of Ant Hill. A neighbor, a man with his wife, concubine, and servants, climbed to the roof. Zilu said, \"What is this crowd doing?\" Confucius said, \"This is the servant of a sage. He buries himself among the people, hides in the wilderness, his voice silenced, his ambitions boundless. Though he speaks, his heart never speaks. He goes against the world, his mind disdaining to follow it—this is one who sinks in the land.\" Zilu said, \"Is this Shina Yiliao?\" Zilu asked to summon him. Confucius said, \"Enough. He knows I am known to him, knows I am traveling to Chu, and thinks I will surely have the King of Chu summon him. He would consider me a flatterer. If that is so, he would be ashamed to hear my words, let alone meet me in person. How could he still be there?\" Zilu went to see, but his house was empty.\n\nAt Ant Mound there lived a family that sold broth. The Master lodged at their home. Those who climbed to the roof ascended to its highest point to gaze upon the people below—so many, so bustling. The \"servant of a sage\" refers to a disciple of the sage, one who buries himself among the people, concealing himself among his neighbors, unknown even to those nearby. \"His voice silenced\" means he flees from fame. \"Sinking\" is not in water but on land, likening his concealment to one who hides in the marketplace. This man must be a disciple of Shina Yiliao. Yiliao, surnamed Xiong, dwelled in the southern market of Chu. \"Known to him\" means he surely knows me. A \"flatterer\" is one who speaks excessively. \"How could he still be there?\" means he must have departed and not remained. His house was empty because he fled, fearing the Master would speak of him to the King of Chu and summon him, so he escaped.\n\nThe Warden of Changwu asked Zilao, \"When governing, do not act recklessly; when ruling the people, do not act carelessly.\" He continued, \"In the past, when I cultivated grain, if I plowed recklessly, the harvest repaid me recklessly. If I weeded carelessly, the harvest repaid me carelessly. The following year, I changed my methods: I deepened the plowing and thoroughly harrowed the soil, and the grain flourished and grew abundant. I was sated for the entire year.\"\n\nZhuangzi heard this and said, \"Nowadays, when people cultivate their bodies and order their minds, many resemble what the Warden describes: they flee from their Heaven, depart from their nature, extinguish their emotions, and lose their spirit, taking the common as their norm. Those who recklessly treat their nature allow the sprouts of desire and aversion to become their nature. Like reeds and rushes, like bulrushes and reeds, they first sprout, then support our form, gradually uprooting our nature. Together they fester and leak, erupting without choosing where, giving rise to wandering sores, scabies, ulcers, internal abscesses, and wasting diseases—such is the result.\"\n\nThe Warden used plowing to illustrate governance; Zhuangzi, in turn, used it to illustrate learning. Su Dongpo’s *On Farming* follows this same pattern. \"Changed his methods\" means altering his approach. \"Sated\" means being full from eating. \"Taking the common as their norm\" means such people are numerous in the world. \"Aversion\" refers to dislikes. \"Sprouts\" are pernicious growths. The harm of likes and dislikes obstructs and blocks our original nature, like reeds choking a heart. Once nature is obstructed, the growth of deluded desires, like the first sprouts of bulrushes, fills the body—every part becomes consumed by human desire. \"Support\" means to aid. When desires assist the form, sight, hearing, speech, movement, rest, and diet all lose their natural principles. Thus, it is said, \"gradually uprooting our nature.\" \"Gradually\" means little by little; \"uprooting\" means to pull out. At first, true nature is merely obstructed, but as it worsens, it is gradually torn away, until Heavenly principle is utterly destroyed. Once true nature is lost, qi also becomes diseased, giving rise to simultaneous festering and leakage, eruptions without choosing where—any contact breeds illness. \"Simultaneous festering\" refers to wandering sores, scabies, and ulcers—diseases of pus and blood. \"Leakage\" refers to internal abscesses and wasting diseases—what we now call diabetes. This parable serves to warn those in the world who indulge their passions and neglect the Dao, for in the end, they will surely destroy themselves.\n\nBo Ju studied under Lao Dan, saying, \"I request to travel throughout the world.\" Lao Dan replied, \"Enough! The world is all like this.\" Bo Ju again entreated Lao Dan, \"Where should I begin?\" Lao Dan said, \"Begin with Qi.\"\n\nUpon arriving in Qi, Bo Ju saw a condemned man. He pushed forward and forced his way through, removed his court robes to cover the man, and wailed to Heaven, crying, \"O man! O man! The world suffers great calamity, yet you alone have met it first! Do not steal, do not kill—only when honor and disgrace are established do people see what afflicts them; only when wealth and property are amassed do people see what they contend over. Now, by establishing what afflicts people and amassing what they contend over, you exhaust their strength without respite—how could this not reach such a state?\"\n\n*\"The world is all like this\"* means that the world is everywhere thus. *\"Do not steal, do not kill\"* means: was it for stealing or for killing that you were punished and imprisoned? *\"Do not\"* here signifies *\"was it not thus?\"* Honor and disgrace are names; wealth and property are profit. Affliction and harm arise from these. Those above prize names, and thus these afflictions and harms follow; rulers covet amassing wealth, and thus these contentions arise—such matters all begin from above.\n\nLaozi said, *\"Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend; do not prize goods hard to obtain, and the people will not steal.\"* This is the same idea: using fame and profit to enslave people, driving them to self-exhaustion without end—how could it not reach such a state? His meaning was that in the great antiquity, there were no names, no profits, and so customs were pure and honest, states had no punishments, and people no crimes.\n\nThe rulers of old took success as belonging to the people and failure as their own; they took uprightness as belonging to the people and crookedness as their own. Thus, if even one person’s form suffered harm, the ruler would withdraw and take the blame himself. Now, however, it is not so.\n\n*\"Now, however, it is not so\"* refers to later ages. They conceal matters to deceive the people, calling those who do not know *\"foolish\"*; they impose great and difficult tasks, blaming those who dare not undertake them as *\"guilty\"*; they assign heavy burdens without measuring people’s strength, punishing those who cannot bear them; they send people on distant journeys, executing those who do not arrive. The people, knowing their strength is exhausted, resort to deception to continue. Day by day, deceit multiplies—how could the people not deceive? When strength is insufficient, they feign ability; when knowledge is insufficient, they cheat; when wealth is insufficient, they steal. To whom can the blame for theft and deception be laid?\n\nThe two lines *\"success and failure, uprightness and crookedness\"* mean that if the common people have faults, it lies with *\"me alone.\"* If even one person’s form does not obtain its life, the ruler withdraws and takes the blame himself, as if he had cast a commoner into a ditch without bestowing grace upon them. *\"Now, however, it is not so\"* refers to later generations.\n\nThe ruler sends people on distant journeys without calculating their travel capacity, forcing them to do what they cannot and punishing those who fail, executing those who do not arrive. Those in high position issue decrees day by day, each more deceptive than the last—how could the people not resort to deception? When forced to do what their strength cannot bear, they must respond with pretense; when compelled to do what their knowledge cannot reach, they must respond with fraud. Excessive exactions without restraint drive them to theft to meet demands—it is I who make them deceive, cheat, and steal. Whom else can blame be laid upon?\n\nThese three phrases form a single idea, leading to the following line on theft, where the meaning becomes clear—this is also a matter of literary structure. When Qu Boyu reached sixty, he transformed sixty times, never failing to begin with what he took as right and end by rejecting it as wrong. How could he know that what he now called right was not the wrong of his fifty-ninth year? At sixty, his insights each year surpassed the last, yet how could he be certain that the rightness of his sixtieth year was truly right? This is but one example.\n\nAll things have life, yet none see their roots; all things emerge, yet none see their gates. People all honor the knowledge of what they know, but none know to rely on the knowledge of what they do not know—can this not be called a great delusion? Enough, enough! There is no escape from this—is this what is meant by \"so it is, so it is\"?\n\nThat things have life must have roots; that they emerge must have gates—only people do not see them. This is what lies beyond knowing. For people to know what they know yet not know what they do not know is the height of subtlety—such are the truly deluded. \"There is no escape\" means that it is naturally so, an unknowing knowledge that pervades past and present, above and below. Where is there a place not governed by this principle? How could one escape it? \"So it is, so it is?\" is a concluding phrase, asking whether what is called \"so\" is truly so. When Zigong replied, \"So it is, is it not?\" he meant precisely this. (See the *Wei Ling Gong* chapter; *ran yu* is pronounced *yu*.)\n\nConfucius asked the Grand Historian Da Tao, Bo Chang Qian, and Xi Wei: \"Wei Ling Gong indulged in wine and pleasure, neglecting state affairs; he hunted and fowled without responding to the affairs of other lords. How then did he come to be called 'Ling Gong'?\" Da Tao said, \"It was because of this.\" Bo Chang Qian said, \"Ling Gong had three wives, with whom he bathed in debauchery. When Historian Fang presented himself in audience, Ling Gong had attendants support him with gifts in hand—his dissipation was extreme, yet his reverence toward worthy men was like this. This is why he was called 'Ling Gong.'\" Xi Wei said, \"When Ling Gong died, divination for burial in the ancestral tomb was inauspicious, but burial at Sha Qiu was auspicious. When they dug several fathoms deep, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing it, they saw an inscription: 'Do not rely on his descendants; Ling Gong will seize and bury it.' Ling Gong’s being called 'Ling' had long been so—how could these two understand it?\"\n\n\"Fowling\" refers to hunting birds and beasts. Ling Gong did not respond to the rituals of interstate relations—how could a man like this be posthumously titled \"Ling\"? It means the title was not sufficient to match his faults. Da Tao said, \"This was also because the people of the state universally agreed to title him thus.\" (Here, *shi* \"this\" means the same as *ci* \"this.\") \"Presenting what was presented\" refers to the place where he resided. \"Attendants\" is like what is now called \"summoning for audience.\" \"Grasping gifts\" means holding the ceremonial silk presented upon an audience, and Ling Gong had people support him—this was a sign of propriety. \"Reverence\" means solemn respect. Sha Qiu was an ancient burial site. Since Ling Gong’s name was already fixed before his birth, how could human effort have determined it? This is a metaphor for all worldly affairs arising from spontaneity. \"These two\" refers to Da Tao and Bo Chang Qian. \"Do not rely on his descendants\" means his descendants could not be entrusted with it, so Ling Gong seized and buried it. (*Feng* means \"to rely on.\")\n\nLittle Knowledge asked Grand Duke Diao: \"What is meant by 'the words of the village'?\" Grand Duke Diao said: \"A village combines ten surnames and a hundred names to form its customs. It unites differences to make sameness and disperses sameness to make differences. Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse but do not get the horse, yet when a horse stands before you, you assemble its hundred parts and call it a horse—this is the principle. Thus, hills accumulate the low to become high; rivers combine waters to become great. The great man unites and combines to become public-spirited. Therefore, what enters from without has a master but is not grasped; what issues from within has a norm but is not resisted. The four seasons have distinct qi, yet Heaven does not bestow them, so the year is completed. The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not favor them, so the state is well-governed. The virtues of Wen and Wu were not bestowed, so their power was complete. The myriad things have distinct principles, yet the Dao does not favor them, so it is nameless. Nameless, it does nothing; doing nothing, yet nothing is left undone. Times have endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations. Fortune and misfortune flow ceaselessly. Where there is obstruction, there is also what is fitting; where there is self-sacrifice for distinct faces, there is also what is correct and what is deviant. Compared to the great marsh, all materials find their measure. Observing the great mountain, trees and stones share the same foundation—this is what is meant by 'the words of the village.'\"\n\n\"Gathering wells makes a mound; gathering mounds makes a village\"—hence the term \"village.\" Within one village, there are ten surnames and a hundred names. Though people differ, their customs are the same—this illustrates uniting differences to make sameness. \"The words of the village\" are the common words of a village. Uniting differences to make sameness means the myriad things share one principle. Dispersing sameness to make differences means each thing possesses its own principle. Assembling the hundred parts to make a horse—yet the name \"horse\" does not reside in any single part—this is dispersing sameness to make differences. Only when the hundred parts are assembled is it called a horse—this is uniting differences to make sameness. Accumulating to make a mountain and combining to make water follow the same principle. Uniting and combining to become public-spirited means uniting the differences of the myriad things to make sameness. \"Having a master but not grasping\" means what is mastered resides within, yet nothing is grasped—grasping would not be spontaneous. \"Norm\" refers to the principle of the myriad things. What issues from the heart shares the same principle as the myriad things, naturally harmonizing without resistance. Not grasping, not resisting—this is following spontaneity without the intent of sameness or difference. Heaven does not bestow—it does not claim merit. The five offices are arranged in ranks of five, each performing its duty—how could the ruler favor one over another? The great man embodies the virtues of Wen and Wu—when the time is right for Wen, he acts as Wen; when the time is right for Wu, he acts as Wu—this is not a matter of bestowal. Thus, his virtue is complete. The myriad things each have their own principle—hence \"distinct principles.\" The Great Dao unites them to become public-spirited—hence \"does not favor.\" \"Nameless\" means it cannot be named.\n\nThe flowing and unceasing movement is natural. The arrival of fortune and misfortune, blessing and calamity, depends on hidden interdependence without constancy—sometimes what seems contrary may in fact be fitting, like the old man who lost his horse, then regained it. \"Contrary\" means thwarted, not as one wishes; \"fitting\" means as one wishes. If people cling to their own minds, it is like their faces—all different. To have something one corrects is to fixate and become rigid. To be rigid is to err, as people today say, \"to force an analogy is to miss the mark.\" Thus, it is said: to have something one corrects is to have something one errs in—this is a comparison. For example, in a great marsh, the materials of a hundred things each fit their measure, whether small or great, all can be used.\n\n\"Same altar\" means the same ground. Wood and stone originally reside on one mountain—initially, what distinction is there? This is uniting the different to become the same. Lesser Knowledge said: \"Then is this sufficient to be called the Dao?\" Grand Duke Mou replied: \"No. Now, the number of things is not limited to the myriad things, yet we call them 'the myriad things'—this is naming them by their great number. Thus, heaven and earth are the greatest of forms, yin and yang are the greatest of qi, and the Dao is their shared principle. To name them by their greatness is acceptable. But if one already has this, how can it be compared? To use such analogies is like comparing dogs and horses—they fall far short.\n\nThings are not limited to the myriad, yet we speak of 'the myriad things'—this is their total number, an approximation, a shorthand. Heaven and earth, yin and yang, are likewise general names for forms and qi. Forms and qi are not limited to heaven and earth or yin and yang, but we speak of them by their greatness. The Dao as the shared principle is also spoken of by borrowing from their greatness. Though the name 'Dao' already exists, how can it be compared and spoken of in this way? Thus, it is said: if one already has this, how can it be compared? Dogs and horses cannot be made the same—this is the case here. To compare them and engage in such debate is like the difference between dogs and horses—they cannot be united, nor are they comparable, and the distance is great indeed.\"\n\nLesser Knowledge said: \"Within the four directions and the six conjunctions, where do the myriad things arise?\" Grand Duke Mou replied: \"Yin and yang illuminate and respond to each other, cover and combine, regulate and transform. The four seasons alternate, give birth and kill, desire and aversion, departure and approach arise from this. Male and female unite in pairs, and thus there are constantly shifts between safety and danger, fortune and misfortune, urgency and ease, gathering and scattering—forming the names and realities that can be recorded, the subtleties that can be noted. Following the sequence, they regulate each other; arising and operating, they employ each other. When exhausted, they return; when ended, they begin anew—these are the inherent patterns of things, the utmost of speech and knowledge, the limit of what can be known. Only the things themselves. Those who perceive the Dao do not follow what decays nor trace what arises—this is where their discourse ends.\n\nWhere do the myriad things begin? Thus, it is said: where do they arise? They illuminate and respond to each other, cover and combine, regulate and transform—grow and diminish. The four seasons alternate: spring gives birth, autumn kills, each following its time. From this, desire and aversion, departure and approach, male and female, union and separation, safety and danger, fortune and misfortune, urgency and ease, gathering and scattering arise—these are the affairs of the human world following the existence of heaven and earth, yin and yang. All these are differences within sameness, arising like a bridge arching high. 'Pieces' means division; 'pairing' means union. 'Constantly' means always. 'Forming' means completing each other—here, only the character is changed for literary effect. From desire and aversion to gathering and scattering, their names and realities can be recorded, their subtleties can be noted—each can be seen, not only spoken of but also written down. Following the sequence of time, they regulate each other. Arising and operating, they employ each other in growth and diminution. When exhausted, they return to openness; when ended, they begin anew—these are the necessary patterns of the myriad things. Speech that reaches its limit arrives at this; knowledge that attains its utmost arrives at this. To exhaust heart and strength is only to grasp the character of 'things.' Thus, it is said: the limit is only the things themselves. Only those who know the Dao do not follow what decays nor trace what arises—they attribute all to the absence of origin, to spontaneity. Thus, their discourse ends here.\"\n\nLesser Knowledge said: \"Ji Zhen’s 'non-action' and Jie Zi’s 'contingent causation'—whose discourse aligns with reality, whose principle is partial?\" Grand Duke Mou replied: \"The crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs are known to all. Even the most knowledgeable cannot describe in words how they transform themselves; people cannot anticipate in thought what they will do. Yet to analyze this precisely is to reach the boundless, to encompass the immeasurable. 'Contingent causation' and 'non-action' are still bound by things and ultimately considered flawed.\n\nJi Zhen and Jie Zi were two contemporaries, each with their own theory. One spoke of 'non-action,' meaning that within all occurrences, there is initially no controller—all is accidental. The other spoke of 'contingent causation,' meaning there is a controller, and nothing is not caused—what moves is caused to move, what stops is caused to stop. 'Aligns with reality' means it accords with the facts. 'Partial in principle' means it is a biased view.\"\n\nShould one affirm or reject either of these two theories? The analogy of the crowing rooster and barking dog illustrates their divergence. What people know differs, so even the wisest cannot fully articulate or grasp the subtleties of self-transformation. How can one recite another’s words to comprehend the marvel of their insight? How can one fathom the intentions behind another’s actions? This is the principle at hand.\n\nTo analyze it precisely is to speak of the great and the small, for its depths cannot be exhausted. \"Without measure\" refers to the extreme of the minute; \"unfathomable\" to the extreme of the vast. Both theories remain entangled with things and ultimately harbor flaws—each suffers from inherent limitations.\n\nThe theory of \"contingent causation\" is substantive; that of \"non-action\" is empty. What has form and reality is bound to things; what is nameless and formless resides in their absence. Yet both can be expressed in words and conceived in thought, and thus both remain distant from the Dao.\n\nThe unborn cannot be prevented; the dead cannot be obstructed. Life and death are not distant—their principle is not visible. \"Prevention\" means prohibition. Before birth, one cannot avoid coming into being; once born, death cannot be defied or resisted. The principle of life and death lies before us, not far away, yet it cannot be seen—hence it is said to be \"not visible.\"\n\nThe theories of \"contingent causation\" and \"non-action\" are but provisional explanations. Observing their origins, I see their past is boundless; seeking their ends, their future is endless. Boundless and endless, they are as insubstantial as words, sharing the same principle as things. If one insists on \"contingent causation\" or \"non-action,\" worldly doubts arise from these very assumptions—how can one claim to be free from entanglement?\n\nThe \"root\" is the state before movement; the \"end\" is the state after cessation. Observing the root, one sees its past is boundless; observing the end, one sees its future is endless. Only by dissolving all words can one align with the myriad things and unify their principle—hence it is said that words are insubstantial, sharing the same principle as things.\n\n\"Contingent causation\" and \"non-action\" are but verbal expedients for things, their beginning and end. The Dao cannot be affirmed as existent, nor can it be denied as nonexistent. The term \"Dao\" is but a provisional name for its operation. Both theories, in their partiality, remain mired in things, seeing only their beginning and end. If one clings to things, how can one speak of the Dao as existent? Thus, the Dao cannot be said to exist. Yet if it exists, how can it be said to be nonexistent? Existence cannot be negated—hence it is said that existence cannot be denied. Viewed in truth, the word \"Dao\" is but a provisional name for its operation in the world.\n\nBoth theories are entangled with things, confined to a single corner—how can they be called the Great Dao? A corner is but a fragment; the Great Dao is all-encompassing. Having concluded the above, the text shifts to another subtle point:\n\nIf words suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts the Dao; if words do not suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts only things. The ultimate of the Dao and things cannot be conveyed by speech or silence alone—neither words nor silence can fully express it. This aligns with the previous statement.\n\nYet if I truly perceive, then even speech can exhaust the Dao—speaking all day does no harm. Thus, it is said: \"If words suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts the Dao.\" If I perceive nothing, then words cannot exhaust the Dao—no matter how much one speaks, it remains mere semblance. Thus, it is said: \"If words do not suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts only things.\" The Dao is subtle; things are coarse. Seeking their extremes, neither words nor silence suffice to contain them—hence it is said they are \"not in this.\" Between words and silence lies the ultimate discourse.\n\nThe Buddhist analogy of pressing a finger to reveal the ocean’s reflection or a lamp’s light—where your mind stirs and dust arises—expresses this same idea. The Buddha also said, \"I am the Dharma King, autonomous in the Dharma.\" This means that one who embodies the Dao is free, while one who has not yet embodied it remains bound. How does this differ from the Inner Chapters?\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: External Things (Chapter 26)**\n\nExternal things cannot be relied upon. Thus, Longfeng was executed, Bigan was killed, Jizi feigned madness, and E Lai died—Jie and Zhou perished. No ruler fails to desire loyal ministers, yet loyalty does not guarantee trust. Thus, Wu Yun was exiled to the Yangtze, and Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood stored for three years before transforming into jade. No parent fails to desire filial children, yet filial piety does not guarantee love. Thus, Xiaoji grieved, and Zeng Shen mourned.\n\nExternal things are matters beyond oneself, not sought within. In the time of Jie and Zhou, both worthy and unworthy suffered the same calamities—this cannot be relied upon. The examples here pertain to Zhou, but Jie is included by analogy.\n\nChang Hong was exiled and returned to Shu, where he disemboweled himself and died. The people of Shu placed his blood in a casket, and after three years, it turned into jade. This account differs slightly from the *Zuozhuan*, which seems fantastical. During the Jin Emperor Yuan’s reign, when grain transports failed to arrive, he executed his minister, and the blood spurted upward against a pillar. The Qi killed Hulü Guang with the sword *Mingyue*, and his blood soaked the ground, refusing to fade—such things occur in the world.\n\nXiaoji was the son of King Gaozong of Yin, exiled by his stepmother. Zengzi’s sorrow is said to stem from his father wielding a large staff, prompting him to flee. Readers of this text should grasp its intent rather than cling to specifics. Loyalty and filial piety are esteemed, yet they may harm one’s person—such are external things, which cannot be relied upon.\n\nWhen wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal and fire stay together, the metal melts. When yin and yang clash in their movements, heaven and earth are thrown into great turmoil—thus arise thunder and lightning. Fire appears in water, burning great locust trees. When wood rubs against wood, fire emerges of itself—today’s boatmen use elm and willow in the same way. Fire and metal kept together cause smelting. Wood, though inherently without fire, generates it through friction; metal, though supremely hard, flows when exposed to fire—this too expresses the idea that things cannot be taken for granted. Great turmoil brings great anomalies. During violent thunderstorms, trees may be set ablaze, hence the saying, “fire appears in water, burning the great locust.” It does not speak of other trees but specifically of the locust because the locust can generate fire; thus, the locust is mentioned. The *Huainanzi* states, “Old locust trees produce fire,” as seen in the *Fan Lun* chapter—this does not refer solely to the burning of great locust trees. All these are instances of yin and yang clashing in their movements, resulting in calamities that are rarely seen—again illustrating that things cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThere is profound sorrow when one is trapped in a double peril with no escape, restless and unsettled, unable to find peace of mind. The heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, stifled and mired in distress. As advantages and harms clash, they generate abundant fire, and the multitude burns away harmony. The moon, by nature, cannot withstand fire—thus, one becomes utterly undone, and the Way is exhausted.\n\nProfound sorrow is extreme sorrow. The double peril refers either to the afflictions of human society or to the calamities of yin and yang. The *Human World* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* speaks of these two perils—this is the same idea. Restlessness and unease describe the state of alarm and insecurity. “Unable to find peace” means that profound sorrow, with no escape, disrupts one’s emotional equilibrium. “The heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth” describes a heart bound and tormented by its own suffering. Stifled and mired refer to oppression and entanglement in danger. As advantages and harms wage war within the breast, the inner self is scorched—more intensely than by searing fire, hence “generating abundant fire.” These are all common people, those who do not understand the Way. Unaware that external things cannot be taken for granted, they overtax their minds and thus reach this state, burning away the harmonious qi within their breasts. Hence, “the multitude burns away harmony.” The moon’s nature refers to the innate harmony people receive from heaven, which is complete and resembles the moon. Yet when obscured by worldly desires, its brilliance is eclipsed by the flames of craving, and what should be the moon cannot withstand them, leading to the burning of harmony. As the poet of the mountains and valleys said, “The original mind is like the sun and moon; desires eclipse it”—this is the same idea. Utterly undone describes a state of collapse and abandonment. “The Way is exhausted” means that heavenly principle is extinguished. This refers to the multitude, who, drowned in desire, remain deluded their entire lives, only ceasing when heavenly principle is utterly destroyed.\n\nZhuangzi was poor, so he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. The marquis said, “Very well. When I receive the tax revenue from my fief, I will lend you three hundred pieces of gold—will that do?” Zhuang Zhou flushed with anger and said, “On my way here yesterday, I heard someone calling from the middle of the road. I looked and saw a minnow in the rut of a cart wheel. I asked it, ‘Minnow, what are you doing here?’ It replied, ‘I am a wave-official from the Eastern Sea. Do you have a pint or a quart of water to keep me alive?’ I said, ‘Very well. I am about to travel south to persuade the kings of Wu and Yue to channel the waters of the Western River to welcome you—will that do?’ The minnow flushed with anger and said, ‘I have lost my usual element and have nowhere to stay. I could be kept alive with a pint or a quart of water, but you say such things—you might as well go look for me in a dried-fish shop!’”\n\nThe Marquis of the River may refer to Marquis Wen of Wei, though this is not certain. Alternatively, it may be an official overseeing the river, addressed as “marquis.” If not, then “marquis” may be his surname. “Tax revenue” refers to the tribute from his fief. “Wave-official” is akin to saying “water official.” This passage must have been a jest circulating at the time, hence its inclusion here—it conveys the modern saying, “distant water cannot quench a nearby fire.” The “dried-fish shop” implies that by the time the water arrives, the minnow will already have become dried fish. “Usual element” refers to what one is accustomed to.\n\nMaster Ren made a great hook with a massive black rope and used fifty oxen as bait. Crouching on Mount Kuaiji, he cast his line into the Eastern Sea, fishing day after day for a year without catching anything. Then a great fish took the bait, dragging the massive hook down into the depths. It surged and thrashed, its fins erect, white waves rising like mountains, the sea churning with a sound like thunder, striking terror for a thousand miles. Master Ren caught the fish, sliced it, and dried it. From the Zhi River eastward to north of Cangwu, there was no one who did not eat their fill of it. Later, those of mediocre talent and pedantic scholars all marveled and spread the tale.\n\nTo raise a pole and chase after minnows in ditches, guarding them—how difficult it is to catch a great fish! To adorn petty words to seek high office—how far this is from great understanding! Thus, those who have never heard of Master Ren’s customs are far from being able to navigate the world. The massive black rope refers to a thick, dark cord. The character for “ox” is pronounced *jie*.\n\nThe term *fang* is synonymous with *xian*, meaning \"to sink.\" The sea water churned violently, its sound akin to thunder—this describes how the fish’s thrashing stirred the sea, its roar striking terror. *Dan he* means \"fear and dread,\" for people a thousand *li* away heard its sound and trembled. *Yan yan* means \"to eat one’s fill.\" *Quan cai* refers to those of shallow judgment and limited vision. *Feng yu* describes those who parrot hearsay, knowing only the commonplace and not the extraordinary, seeing only the small and not the great—hence their astonishment and mutual warnings. *Lei* means \"to coil,\" and *guan* means \"to pour.\" *Guan du* refers to small streams, while *ni fu* are tiny fish. *Xian ling* is akin to modern proclamations. *Xian* is synonymous with *xuan* (\"to hang\"), and *xian jie* denotes official decrees, much like today’s reward notices. This speaks of petty men who adorn their words to curry favor with superiors, seeking to align with the decrees they display. Even if they succeed, how much can they truly gain? Thus it is said: \"How far they are from great understanding!\"\n\n*Su* refers to worldly scholars. Such scholars cannot be spoken to about the Dao of governing the world, hence it is said: \"Those who cling to worldly ways are far indeed from being able to navigate the world.\" *Yuan yi* means \"exceedingly so.\"\n\nThe Confucians who rob graves with *Odes* and *Rites*:\nA great Confucian announced: \"The east is stirring—what is to be done?\"\nA lesser Confucian replied: \"He has not yet removed his undergarments, but there is a pearl in his mouth.\"\nThe *Odes* indeed say:\n*\"The green, green wheat grows on the hillside mound.\nIf one does not give in life, why hold a pearl in death?\"*\nThe great Confucian then seized the corpse’s hair, pressed down its chin, and with a metal mallet pried open its jaw. Carefully parting its cheeks, he ensured the pearl in its mouth remained unharmed.\n\nThis passage likely satirizes scholars who misuse the words of the sages and worthies in the *Odes* and *Books* to cloak their villainy. *Lu* means \"to announce from above to below,\" while *ju* means \"to report from below to above.\" *Lu chuan* refers to a great Confucian leading and instructing his disciples. *\"The green, green wheat grows on the hillside mound\"* is a verse about grave fields. *\"If one does not give in life, why hold a pearl in death?\"* mocks the miserly rich. This poem consists of only four lines—whether it is an ancient verse or composed by Zhuangzi himself is uncertain. The lines from *\"seizing its hair\"* onward are the great Confucian’s instructions to the lesser one: *jie* means \"to grasp,\" *ye* means \"to press with the hand,\" and *hui* refers to the chin. *Kong qi hui* means \"to force open the jaw.\" *Bie* also means \"to open,\" implying that by reciting this poem, he teaches his disciple to carefully extract the pearl without damage. The *Odes* say: *\"Why hold a pearl in death?\"*—thus, taking it now aligns with the poem’s intent.\n\nWhen Lao Lai’s disciple went out to gather firewood and encountered Confucius, he returned and reported: \"There is someone over there—tall above, stooped below, his back hunched, his ears turned as if surveying the four seas. I do not know whose disciple he is.\"\nLao Lai said: \"That is Qiu. Summon him here.\"\nWhen Confucius arrived, Lao Lai said: \"Qiu, shed your bodily pride and your cultivated demeanor—then you may be called a gentleman.\"\nConfucius bowed and withdrew, his expression altered. He asked: \"May I advance in my studies?\"\nLao Lai replied: \"One who cannot bear the harm of a single generation yet hastens to inflict suffering for ten thousand generations—is this not obstinate and narrow-minded? Or does he simply lack the capacity? To take joy in kindness as if it were arrogance is a lifelong disgrace. The conduct of the common people advances thus: they draw one another by reputation, bind themselves with profit, and in praising Yao while condemning Jie, they would do better to forget both and close their mouths to praise. For all their actions are crooked, and nothing they do is free from error. The sage hesitates to initiate affairs, yet often succeeds—how is this so? His bearing remains ever modest. Your carriage is forever laden with self-importance.\"\n\n*Chu xin* means \"to go out and gather firewood.\" *Xiu shang* means \"tall above.\"\n\nSwift in lowering his steps, his gait rings with urgency—this describes the slight hunch of his back, a subtle curvature seen only from behind. When viewed face-on, his ears are not visible. His gaze seems to survey the four seas, his eyes brimming with the sorrow of one who gazes upon the world’s woes with deep concern.\n\n*Gong jin* refers to the bearing of self-importance in your person. *Rong zhi*: *rong* means outward adornment; *zhi*, contemplation. \"Can the *Dao*-practice be advanced?\" asks whether the study of the *Dao* and its cultivation may be pursued.\n\n\"A single generation’s harm\" speaks of the suffering of people in one’s own time, a pitiable affliction. *Ao* conveys arrogance and heedlessness: you fret over the present, exhausting your mind, yet leave calamity for future generations—all while remaining haughtily indifferent. If this is so, your *Dao* is rightfully exhausted. *Ju* means \"exhausted\"; *gu*, \"fitting.\" Your *Dao* is so impoverished because you fail to grasp that worldly affairs lie beyond the reach of mere cunning—hence, \"does he simply lack the capacity?\" *Wang* here means \"to forget.\"\n\n*Hui* is to bestow kindness upon others; *huan*, to seek their favor. To take pride in winning others’ approval through such acts is arrogance, and to parade this before the world is a lifelong disgrace. The conduct of the common people advances thus, ever mired in such pursuits—hence, \"the conduct of the common people advances thus.\" *Er* is a particle; *zhong min* refers to the mediocre masses.\n\nThey draw one another by reputation and bind themselves with schemes of profit—this depicts the ways of the common people. To forget both Yao and Jie is to be free not only of blame but also of praise—hence, \"close their mouths to praise.\" To act contrary to nature is to invite harm to the *Dao*; to favor restlessness over stillness is to stray into crookedness.\n\nThe sage is not thus: *chou chu* conveys hesitation, the reluctance to proceed. He initiates affairs only when unavoidable, responding as necessity demands. Precisely because he acts without self-interest, he often succeeds. *Zai* means \"to bear\"; here, it signifies self-importance. How, then, can you remain forever laden with such conceit? Hence, \"how is this so?\" \"His bearing remains ever modest\"—this closing phrase is striking in its placement.\n\nThe Lord of Song dreamed in the dead of night of a man with disheveled hair peering through the side gate, who said: \"I come from Zailu Deep. As an envoy of the Clear River, I was caught by the River Lord’s fisherman, Yu Qie. I am about to be taken.\" The Lord awoke and had the dream interpreted, and was told: \"This is a divine turtle.\"\n\nThe Lord asked: \"Is there a fisherman named Yu Qie?\"\nHis attendants replied: \"There is.\"\nThe Lord said: \"Summon Yu Qie to court tomorrow.\"\n\nThe next day, Yu Qie appeared before the Lord.\nThe Lord asked: \"What did you catch in your fishing?\"\nYu Qie replied: \"I cast my net and caught a white turtle, five feet in circumference.\"\nThe Lord said: \"Present this turtle to me.\"\n\nWhen the turtle arrived, the Lord wavered—first wanting to kill it, then to spare it. His mind unsettled, he divined with it, saying: \"Killing the turtle for divination will bring good fortune.\" So he carved the turtle, drilling seventy-two holes without a single miscalculation.\n\nConfucius remarked: \"The divine turtle could appear in a dream to the Lord of Song yet could not escape Yu Qie’s net. It could foresee seventy-two divinations without error yet could not avoid the disaster of having its entrails carved out. Thus, knowledge may be constrained, and even the divine may have its limits. Though one may possess supreme wisdom and a thousand advisors, fish do not fear nets but fear pelicans. Discard petty knowledge, and great wisdom will become clear; abandon contrived goodness, and true goodness will arise of itself.\n\nAn infant, born without a teacher of stone, learns to speak by being among those who can speak. The crooked staff is straight in its own way.\"\n\nThe Gate of Crooked Alignments is the gate of winding paths; Zailu Yuan is a renowned abyss. The spirit of the Qing River sent me as an emissary to the River Lord, who wavered between killing and sparing me, hesitating repeatedly without resolve. Divination deemed killing auspicious, so he slew me, drilling seventy-two holes—meaning the turtle was used for seventy-two divinations.\n\nThough the turtle’s spirit surpasses man’s, it could not save itself. Thus it is said: knowledge may be constrained, and even the divine may have its limits. This implies that when knowledge is named as such, there comes a time when it is exhausted. The following lines broadly illustrate worldly affairs to substantiate this:\n\nThough one may possess supreme wisdom, how can a single person prevail against the schemes of thousands? The pelican drains the water to consume all the fish—this is a deliberate act of harm, unlike the net. The above speaks of others harboring intent to harm my singular wisdom, which I cannot resist. This in turn means that if I act with intent, others will respond in kind. Thus the analogy: only by discarding petty knowledge and entrusting oneself to the natural can great wisdom become clear.\n\nAbandon the notion of contrived goodness and the name it carries, and true goodness will arise of itself. *Shi* (stone) is interchangeable with *shuo* (great); a \"stone teacher\" is a great teacher who instructs others. An infant learns to speak not by seeking a teacher but by being among those who can speak. Great wisdom and inherent goodness are principles of nature, just as the uninstructed ability to speak is a natural analogy.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi, \"Your words are useless.\"\nZhuangzi replied, \"Only when one understands the useless can one begin to speak of the useful. The earth is neither narrow nor small, yet what man uses of it is but the space to stand. If one were to dig away all the earth beyond where the feet rest until reaching the Yellow Springs, would man still have use for it?\"\nHui Shi said, \"It would be useless.\"\nZhuangzi said, \"Then the usefulness of the useless is thus made clear.\"\n*(Digging away is called \"dian.\" Beyond the space for the feet lies the abyss, where one cannot tread. This is the meaning of \"the use of the useless\" from the \"Xu Wu Gui\" chapter.)*\n\nZhuangzi said, \"Is there a man who can wander yet does not wander? Is there a man who cannot wander yet does wander? Those with the will to flee and the resolve to sever ties—alas, are they not far from the burden of supreme wisdom and profound virtue? They fall and do not return, rush like fire and do not look back. Though they may for a time be lord and subject, when their lives end, what difference remains between noble and base? Thus it is said: the perfected person does not linger in their steps. Those who exalt the past and belittle the present are the way of scholars. Yet if one views the present age through the lens of the times of the Shiwei clan, who could avoid being swept away? Only the perfected person can wander through the world without bias, follow others without losing themselves. Those who can wander, wander; those who cannot, remain unable. This speaks of those in the world who are enlightened and those who are not. *You* means to delight in oneself. *Liudun* is to chase things and forget to return. *Juejue* is to stand apart from the world, utterly different. *Ren* means to act. Those of supreme wisdom and profound virtue, who follow nature, do not err in fleeing or severing ties. *Fuzhui* means to sink into worldly entanglements. *Huochi* means to be driven by the world like fire. These are all those burdened by the vulgar who cannot turn back to reflect on themselves—thus they do not return, do not look back, meaning they cannot reverse the light to illuminate their own nature. Though for a time there are distinctions of noble and base, called lord and subject, after death, what remains of noble or base? Kings and lords perish like ants, leaving only mounds of earth. Only the perfected person’s actions leave no lingering attachment to the world—thus it is said: the perfected person does not linger in their steps. The passions of people in past and present are largely the same; where is the difference between simplicity and decadence? Scholars exalt the past and belittle the present because they do not understand the changes of the world. The Shiwei clan lived before the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. If one views the present through the beginning of heaven and earth or the age of high antiquity, all are those who have been swept away and lost their nature. Thus it is said: who could avoid being swept away? Scholars take the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors as the beginning of past and present—this is to mock and disparage the ancient emperors and kings. *Pian* means bias. To wander through the world without leaning toward any bias, not taking past or present as right or wrong, though one may merge with the dust and shine with the same light, not clashing with the world, what one preserves remains intact—thus it is said: to follow others without losing oneself. What they teach, they take as right; I do not study it, yet I comply with their intent without distinction between self and other—this is the meaning of *equalizing things* and *following what is so*. Thus it is said: to comply with their intent without opposing them.\n\nThe eye that is *che* is clear; the ear that is *che* is keen; the nose that is *che* is sharp; the mouth that is *che* is sweet; the mind that is *che* is wise; wisdom that is *che* is virtue. Wherever the Dao is, obstruction is undesirable. Obstruction leads to choking; choking without cessation leads to trampling. Where trampling occurs, myriad harms arise. Those with knowledge rely on their breath, yet if it is not abundant, is this heaven’s fault? Heaven bores through the apertures day and night without ceasing. It is man who, looking back, blocks his own holes. *Che* means to penetrate. Grasping the principle of nature and achieving great penetration, the ear and eye perceive true keenness and clarity; the nose and mouth discern true sharpness and sweetness; what the mind knows is true wisdom; virtue is the highest virtue. *Yong* means blockage and obstruction. *Geng* means choking and not flowing. *Tian* refers to the traces of footsteps. If my understanding of the Dao is blocked and choked, unable to awaken, then I am burdened by form and traces. Not ceasing means delusion without knowing to stop. Burdened by form and traces, myriad harms arise. *Xi* means life. That which is called life is nature. All people possess it. Only after having this nature of receiving life does one have knowledge and awareness. What is called knowledge and awareness relies on this breath. No one lacks it, yet some act contrary to principle—is this because heaven begrudges them its abundance? The principle in the human mind is revealed day and night through its apertures—when has it ever ceased? Thus it is said: heaven bores through them day and night without ceasing. *Che* means the apertures of the mind. *Wu jiang* means without cessation. *Dou* also means the apertures of the mind. Man, deluded by material desires, obscures himself—this is to block his own apertures. *Gu* means \"then.\"\n\nThe womb has layered membranes, the heart roams freely in heaven. If the chamber is not empty, mother and daughter-in-law quarrel; if the heart does not wander in heaven, the six apertures contend. The great forests and mountains are good for people—yet the spirit is overcome, virtue overflows into fame, fame overflows into violence. Schemes are delayed by subtlety, knowledge arises from contention, firewood is born from guarding office, and affairs are settled by the crowd.\n\nIn the timely rains of spring, plants and trees flourish. Hoes and plows begin to be used. Yet more than half of the planted grasses and trees perish, and none know why.\n\n*Bao* refers to the membranes. Within the human body’s flesh lies a layered membrane enveloping the self. *Chong lang* means spaciousness. Within the body, such vastness exists, yet if the heart, as sovereign, delights in heavenly principle, this is called \"roaming in heaven.\" *Bo xi* means strife. In a cramped dwelling, mother and daughter-in-law constantly bicker. The six apertures—the six roots: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—if the chamber is not empty, then superiors and inferiors clash; if the heart is not empty, the six apertures seize one another. If the heart could be empty, how could external things disturb it?\n\nGoodness is love. When the heart is not empty, the six dusts disturb it. Thus, those who love mountains and forests do so because the spirit cannot endure the toil of ceaseless labor. When they suddenly behold a vast, open landscape, the heart must rejoice—yet this joy is followed by sorrow.\n\nThe great transformation subtly shifts, and one is merely turned by things. Stillness can mend illness, rest can rejuvenate age, and tranquility can halt haste. Yet these are the tasks of the toiling, not the idle who have never inquired.\n\n*Jing ran* means serenity. To mend illness is to discard the old and return to the new, abandoning the branches to return to the root. If this heart can be serene, then past losses can be repaired and preserved. *Zi* (眦) is pronounced *jian*; *mie* () is pronounced *mie*. *Zi mie* means to cast aside material desires and preserve heavenly principle, allowing one to wander freely into old age. *Ju* means urgency. To calm the heart is to halt haste.\n\nWhat startles the world is what the sage employs; the divine person has never inquired. What startles the age is what the worthy employs; the sage has never inquired. What startles the state is what the noble person employs; the worthy has never inquired. What aligns with the times is what the petty person employs; the noble person has never inquired.\n\nIn Yanmen, there was one whose parent died, and for his exemplary mourning, he was enfeoffed as an official. Among his peers, some mourned to death. *Xia* is synonymous with *hai* (startle). The sage governs the world with benevolence and righteousness—this startles it. The divine person has no such concerns. The worthy astonishes the age with abundant virtue; the sage has no such concerns. The noble person startles the state with reputation; the worthy has no such concerns. The petty person busies himself to conform to the times; the noble person has no such concerns.\n\nYanmen is a place name. *Shan hui* means filial mourning. For his filiality, he gained rank and became an official. His peers, admiring him, even mourned to death—this speaks of the burden of fame. *Guan shi* is akin to what is now called an official.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, who fled from it. Tang offered it to Wu Guang, who grew angry. When Ji Tuo heard of this, he led his disciples to crouch by the Kuang River. The feudal lords mourned him for three years. Then Shentu Di, admiring their reclusion, threw himself into the river. *Cun* is synonymous with *dun* (crouching), implying disdain. Ji Tuo’s intent was for the feudal lords to yield their states to him, yet they merely pitied his suffering—how laughable! After three years, Shentu Di, admiring the fame of reclusion, drowned himself in the river. This illustrates the extreme burden of fame.\n\nThe fish trap exists for the fish; once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. The rabbit snare exists for the rabbit; once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words exist for meaning; once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where can I find a person who has forgotten words, that I might speak with them?\n\nThe above has thoroughly expounded the matter, concluding with the analogy of the trap and snare—echoing the earlier passage’s structure: \"Words suffice, yet words are insufficient; embodiment suffices.\" The fish trap and rabbit snare are tools for catching fish and rabbits. Once obtained, they are useless. Words convey meaning; once the meaning is grasped, words are forgotten. Those who cannot forget words become mired and lose the meaning. Only one who has forgotten words can truly converse.\n\nThis passage’s subtlety lies in the intent: the rabbit’s aim is to catch the rabbit.\n\nFrom the *Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*: *Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Volume Nine\nBy Lin Xiang of the Song Dynasty\nMiscellaneous Chapters: \"Yu Yan\" (Chapter Twenty-Seven)\n\nThis chapter begins with Zhuangzi’s own explanation of the three types of discourse in his book:\n\n**Yu yan** (parables) are one’s own words spoken through the names of others—nineteen out of ten instances in this text are of this kind, meaning parables dominate. Examples include the dialogues of Nie Que, Wang Ni, and Gengsang Chu.\n\n**Chong yan** (weighty words) borrow the names of ancient sages to lend authority, such as the Yellow Emperor, Shen Nong, and Confucius—seventeen out of ten instances in this text are of this kind.\n\n**Zhi yan** (goblet words) are like a goblet: anyone may drink from it, and the more one drinks, the more flavor it yields. \"Issuing forth daily\" means every matter contains such words. *He* (harmony) is the act of blending; *tian ni* (the Heavenly Equilibrium) is the principle of Heaven.\n\nIn parables, even a father would not act as his own son’s matchmaker—no father’s praise carries the weight of an outsider’s. If it is not my fault, it is the fault of others. When something aligns with oneself, one responds; when it does not, one resists. What aligns with oneself is deemed right; what differs from oneself is deemed wrong.\n\nTo harmonize the hearts of all people with the Heavenly Principle is to borrow—borrowing means not issuing from oneself but from others, hence called \"borrowing from without.\" For instance, if a father praises his own son to seek a marriage alliance, others will not believe him; he must borrow another’s praise. This is the nature of parable.\n\nThis fault does not lie with me but with others’ lack of trust, hence the use of parables. If one assumes it issues from oneself, others will inevitably divide into agreement and disagreement, responding to what aligns with them as right and what differs as wrong. This is the self-serving view of others.\n\n\"Seventeen out of ten\" in *zhong yan* (weighty words) refers to one’s own speech being affirmed as that of elders—those whose years precede but who lack the warp and woof of beginning and end, merely reaching the age of *qiyi* (a hundred years). Such elders, though senior in years, have no precedence in learning; their age alone does not make them exemplary. A person who cannot surpass others fails to fulfill the Way of humanity—this is what is called a \"worn-out person.\" A \"worn-out person\" is one who lingers in the world, long-used and of no value.\n\nThe purpose here is to halt—one’s own words can end disputes. By borrowing the weight of elders, listeners dare not deem it wrong, thus silencing their objections. The ancient sage-kings and worthies were all elders, possessing the warp and woof of constancy and change, beginning and end. *Qiyi* refers to the age of a hundred. Though one’s years may precede, if one’s learning offers no insight, merely being called an elder by virtue of age is insufficient to claim precedence. A person who cannot surpass others cannot fully realize the human Dao—this is merely a \"worn-out person.\"\n\nThe *zhi yan* (goblet words) issue forth daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equilibrium, endlessly unfolding to exhaust the years. Without speech, all is equal; with speech, equality is lost. Speech that aligns with equality does not align; equality that aligns with speech does not align. Thus, \"without speech\" means speech without intent; \"speaking all one’s life\" means never truly speaking. \"Never speaking all one’s life\" means never not speaking, for even in silence, principle may be grasped.\n\nThere is always an origin—what people deem right or wrong, so or not so, all have their sources. Each affirms what it affirms; how can I alone determine what is right? I can only follow what is deemed right and affirm it, follow what is deemed wrong and negate it. Things inherently have their \"so-ness\"; things inherently have their \"admissible-ness.\" Thus, no thing is not so, no thing is inadmissible.\n\nThis is discussed in detail in the \"Equalizing Things\" chapter. The phrase *\"zhi yan* issue forth daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equilibrium—who attains its enduringness?\" means I do not use natural speech to harmonize all mouths. If I were to align with their judgments of right and wrong, how could I claim lasting validity? For the natural principle is unassailable across all ages.\n\nAll things share a common origin from the Creator, yet their forms differ and succeed one another between Heaven and Earth. People see grass as grass, trees as trees, birds as birds, beasts as beasts—only their forms differ, unaware that all emerge from the primordial *qi* and share the same origin. All things in Heaven and Earth cycle through beginning and end like a ring, their profound order beyond human comprehension. This is called the Heavenly Equality—equality in the Heavenly Principle.\n\nZhuangzi said to Huizi: \"Confucius lived sixty years, and at sixty, his views transformed. What he once affirmed, he later negated. Who knows if what he now calls right is not what he deemed wrong at fifty-nine?\" Huizi replied: \"Confucius diligently applied his will and served his knowledge.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Confucius has renounced that. He never spoke of it. Confucius said: 'One receives talent from the great root and revives the spirit to live. To cry in accord with the pitch, to speak in accord with the law, to present profit and righteousness before others—this merely pleases their mouths. It makes people submit in word but not dare to oppose, thus establishing the world’s standards. Alas! How can I compare to him?'\n\n*Fu zhi* means to serve; *zhi* means knowledge.\"\n\nTo diligently apply the mind in pursuit of knowledge and perception is called \"extensive learning.\" *Xie* means to relinquish. This is to say, Confucius had already relinquished the pursuit of extensive learning and advanced toward the Dao, though he never spoke of it to others. When Zhuangzi cited Confucius, he was quoting Confucius’ own words.\n\n\"Receiving talent from the great root\" means receiving one’s nature from the Great Origin. The \"great root\" is the Creator. *Ling* is the nature of awareness. *Fu* means to return—to revert to the original nature of awareness, for only then can one fully realize the Way of human life. Thus, it is said, \"revives the spirit to live.\" *Ming* also means \"to speak.\" *Lü* is the law. *Dang* means that all accords with principle.\n\nTo present profit and righteousness before others and thereby establish likes and dislikes, right and wrong, is merely to please their mouths. It makes people submit in word but not in heart. One must relinquish profit and righteousness and forget likes and dislikes, right and wrong, before others can submit in heart without daring to oppose. Only then can the world’s settled principles be established. *Wu* is pronounced *wu*; it means opposition, defiance. *Wu li* means to stand face-to-face, where I am compliant and the other defiant. The *Rites of Zhou* says, \"to receive the opposition of the feudal lords,\" meaning those who come toward me are defiant.\n\nAfter quoting the Master’s words, Zhuangzi sighed to Huizi: \"Alas! Alas! How can I compare to Confucius?\" From this alone, it is clear that Zhuangzi was not one who failed to revere our Sage.\n\nZengzi took office twice, and his heart transformed twice. He said: \"When I served my parents, three measures of grain brought joy to my heart. Later, when I served with a salary of three thousand *zhong*, it did not reach my heart with sorrow.\" A disciple asked Confucius: \"Can Zeng Shen be said to be free from entanglement in fault?\" Confucius replied: \"He is already entangled. How could one free from entanglement feel sorrow? To him, three measures or three thousand *zhong* were like watching sparrows or mosquitoes pass before him.\" *Bu ji* means not reaching one’s parents. \"Free from entanglement in fault\" means being without the fetters of attachment. The question was whether Zengzi’s words revealed such fetters, for his heart had changed twice—now sorrowful, now joyful. \"He is already entangled\" means that even this sorrow and joy are fetters. If one were truly free from entanglement, the weight of external things passing before one would be like birds or insects—how could one feel sorrow or joy? To feel sorrow or joy is to have a heart.\n\nYan Cheng Ziyou said to Dongguo Ziqí: \"Since I heard your words, in the first year I became rustic; in the second, compliant; in the third, penetrating; in the fourth, like a thing; in the fifth, things came to me; in the sixth, the spirit entered; in the seventh, I became one with Heaven; in the eighth, I knew neither death nor life; in the ninth, I attained the great mystery.\"\n\nIn the first year, he became rustic—returning to simplicity. In the second, compliant—without opposition to right or wrong, like or dislike. In the third, penetrating—thoroughly enlightened. In the fourth, like a thing—like withered wood or dead ashes. In the fifth, things came to him—within stillness, there was that which was not still, what Chan calls \"the great death and yet alive.\" *Jue ru* means to take the transformations of creation into one’s breast. \"One with Heaven\" means unity with Heaven. \"Knowing neither death nor life\" means being at ease in all circumstances. \"The great mystery\" means the utmost profundity. From the first to the ninth year, these are stages, but such matters cannot be measured by years.\n\n\"Life is as death. I urge you to embrace death—yet life has its source. Yang arises, but from what? Is it truly so? Where does it go? Where does it not go? Heaven has its celestial reckoning; Earth has its human records. Where should I seek it? I know not its end. How can it be said to be without fate? I know not its beginning. How can it be said to have fate? There is that which responds—how can it be without spirit? There is that which does not respond—how can it be with spirit?\"\n\nThese lines speak of the principle of neither life nor death. \"Life is as death\" means to take life as real—if there is life, there is death. To hold such a view is self-serving. If one urges another with the utmost impartiality, one would have them know that among the works of creation, nothing is immortal. Thus, it is said, \"I urge you to embrace death.\" Yet to call it death is to imply it has a source. If death has a source, then life, at its first stirring, has no source. If its beginning is without life, how can there be death? This is the beginning of Yang’s movement. Speaking of life and death in this way, how can one know if it is truly so or not? Where it goes is so; where it does not go is not so. Yet when one observes it in its entirety, where is it so? Where is it not so? To call it being is wrong; to call it non-being is also wrong. Thus, it is said, \"Is it truly so? Where does it go? Where does it not go?\"\n\n\"Heavenly reckoning\" refers to the movements of stars, sun, and moon as recorded in almanacs. \"Human records\" refer to the traces of human activity as documented in maps and records. If one seeks the principles of Heaven and Earth through celestial reckoning and human records, can they truly be exhausted? Thus, it is said, \"Where should I seek it?\" Between Heaven and Earth, days pass and months depart—who knows their end? Their movement must have a Creator. How can it be said to be without fate? Yet in the vastness of the beginning, originally there was nothing—how can it be said to have fate? The seasons arrive, and qi responds without the slightest deviation. How can it be said to be without spirit? Yet the humble are not always blessed, the benevolent not always long-lived. Between the seen and unseen, there is sometimes no correspondence. How can it be said to have spirit? These lines elucidate the unknowability of creation.\n\nThe Many *Wangliang* asked the Shadow: \"A moment ago, you were bowing; now, you raise your head. A moment ago, your hair was tied; now, it is loose. A moment ago, you were sitting; now, you stand. A moment ago, you were walking; now, you stop. Why is this?\" The Shadow replied: \"Trivial! Why ask such trifles? I have it, yet I know not why. I am like the cicada’s shell, the snake’s slough—seemingly so, yet not so. In fire and sunlight, I gather; in darkness and night, I am replaced. Do I depend on something? How much more so for those who depend on things! When it comes, I come with it; when it goes, I go with it. When it is strong and bright, I am strong and bright with it. Why ask about strong brightness?\"\n\n\"Trivial!\"—this conveys the sense of fleeting visibility and manifestation. \"Why ask such trifles?\"—it is a casual, offhand remark, an expression of careless spontaneity, as if to say: *Why do you suddenly ask this?* What I possess, I do not myself know why it is so; hence, \"I have it, yet I know not why.\" The cicada has transformed, yet its shell remains; the snake has transformed, yet its slough remains. This analogy compares the movement of form to the life of the cicada or snake, and the shadow to the shell or slough. \"Seemingly so, yet not so\"—this means that while the comparison is apt, it is not entirely accurate. Within sunlight and fire, this shadow exists; hence, \"I gather\" (gathering together). When darkness falls and no fire is lit, the shadow becomes invisible—this is \"replaced.\" \"That\" refers to form; \"I\" refers to the shadow. It says: *Do I depend on that?* Hence, \"Do I depend on something?\" Yet the movement of form itself depends on something else; thus, \"How much more so for those who depend on things!\" \"Strong brightness\" refers to movement. Form moves by relying on the qi of strong brightness; the coming and going of form depend on strong brightness. Form moves because of strong brightness, and I follow it. But the nature of strong brightness is not something form itself knows—why then do you ask me?\n\nThis passage parallels *The Equality of Things*, though it adds the details of strong brightness, fire, and sunlight, playing with the brush as Chan Buddhists do in their repetitive gāthās.\n\nWhen Yang Ziju journeyed south to Pei, and Lao Dan traveled west to Qin, they met at the outskirts of Liang. Midway, Laozi looked up to the sky and sighed, saying: \"At first, I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.\" Yang Ziju made no reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he washed his hands and face, combed his hair, removed his shoes, and, bowing deeply outside, approached and said: \"Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you a question, but as you were walking without pause, I dared not speak. Now that you have paused, may I ask: What is my fault?\" Laozi said: \"Your haughty gaze, your overbearing demeanor—who would wish to dwell with you? The purest white seems sullied; the fullest virtue seems insufficient.\" Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: \"I humbly receive your instruction.\" When he had first arrived, the innkeeper had welcomed him, the master of the house had laid out his mat, his wife had offered the towel and comb, the guests had vacated their seats, and the cook had left the stove—all out of respect. But upon his return, the innkeeper and guests vied with him for a place to sit.\n\n\"What is my fault?\"—this means: *You say I cannot be taught; where is my error?* \"Haughty gaze, overbearing demeanor\"—this describes a stiff, self-important bearing, as if one cannot relax in the company of others. \"Who would wish to dwell with you?\"—this means one has not forgotten the distinction between self and others, always acting as if in the presence of company. \"The purest white seems sullied\"—this conveys the idea of brilliance concealed. \"The fullest virtue seems insufficient\"—this means that though one possesses it, one does not flaunt it. \"Welcomed him\"—refers to seeing him off and receiving him. \"Master of the house\"—the host of the inn. \"Laid out his mat, offered the towel and comb\"—acts of deference. \"The cook\"—the one who tends the stove. \"Vacated their seats, left the stove\"—signs of respect. \"Vied for a place to sit\"—this means they no longer regarded him as someone to be revered. Before hearing Laozi’s words, he had carried himself with self-importance, so people treated him with respect. After his transformation, he concealed his brilliance, and people saw him as ordinary. The style of this passage is also refined.\n\n**Chapter 28: Yielding the Throne** (from the *Miscellaneous Chapters*)\n\nYao offered the empire to Xu You, who refused it. He then offered it to Zizhou Zhipu, who said: \"If you were to make me Son of Heaven, it would be acceptable. However, I happen to suffer from a hidden affliction and am presently treating it. I have no leisure to govern the empire. The empire is the heaviest of burdens, yet I would not let it harm my life—how much less would I let other things do so? Only one who does not treat the empire as a possession can be entrusted with it.\"\n\nShun offered the empire to Zizhou Zhibo, who said: \"I happen to suffer from a hidden affliction and am presently treating it. I have no leisure to govern the empire.\" Thus, the empire is a great vessel, yet one would not exchange one’s life for it—this is what distinguishes those who follow the Way from the common crowd.\n\n\"A hidden affliction\"—akin to what is now called a concealed illness. \"One who does not treat the empire as a possession\"—this means only one who does not desire to be Son of Heaven can be entrusted with the empire, for such a person holds the empire without clinging to it. \"Distinguishes from the common crowd\"—this means they differ from worldly people.\n\nShun offered the empire to Shan Juan, who said: \"I stand in the midst of the cosmos. In winter, I wear furs; in summer, I wear coarse or fine linen. In spring, I plow and sow—my body is sufficient for labor. In autumn, I harvest and store—my person is sufficient for rest. I rise with the sun and rest with its setting. I roam freely between heaven and earth, and my heart is content. Why would I desire the empire? Alas, you do not understand me!\" Thereupon, he refused it and departed, entering the deep mountains, where no one knew his whereabouts.\n\nShun offered the empire to his friend, the farmer of Shihu. The farmer of Shihu said: \"How earnest and toilsome is the ruler’s labor!\" He deemed Shun’s virtue insufficient and so, with his wife carrying their child on her head and he bearing their belongings on his back, they fled to the sea, never to return.\n\n\"Earnest and toilsome\"—describes one who labors diligently. \"Deemed Shun’s virtue insufficient\"—this means it was not natural virtue. Both men fled, one with his wife carrying their child on her head, the other bearing their belongings on his back. These two passages lack concluding remarks, as their meaning is the same as the preceding.\n\nKing Tai of the Zhou dwelt in Bin. The Di people attacked, and though he offered them furs and silks, they refused; he offered them dogs and horses, they refused; he offered them pearls and jades, they refused. What the Di people sought was land. King Tai said: \"To dwell with another’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with another’s father and kill his son—I cannot bear it. All of you, do your best to remain here. Whether you serve as my subjects or as subjects of the Di, what difference is there? Moreover, I have heard that one should not harm what one nurtures with what is used for nurturing.\" Thereupon, he took up his staff and departed. The people followed in a continuous stream, and they established a state at the foot of Mount Qi. King Tai can indeed be called one who knew how to honor life. One who honors life, though rich and noble, does not let what sustains him harm his person; though poor and lowly, does not let profit burden his form. The people of today who hold high office and exalted rank all fear losing them, and in their pursuit of profit, they lightly risk their lives—are they not deluded?\n\n\"What is used for nurturing\"—this refers to what one relies on for sustenance, namely, land. \"What is nurtured\"—the people. \"Honor life\"—this means valuing one’s person above external things. This passage criticizes those of the time who were obsessed with loss.\n\nThe people of Yue assassinated their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, fearing this, fled to Danru. But Yue, left without a ruler, searched for Prince Sou and could not find him. They pursued him to Danru, but Prince Sou refused to emerge. The people of Yue fumigated him with mugwort and carried him out in a jade carriage. Prince Sou grasped the reins, mounted the carriage, looked up to the sky, and cried: \"Rulership! Rulership! Could you not spare me?\" Prince Sou did not hate being a ruler; he hated the calamities that come with rulership. One like Prince Sou can indeed be said not to have let the state harm his life. This was precisely what the people of Yue desired—to make him their ruler.\n\n\"Rulership! Rulership!\"—these words mean: \"Do you wish me to be the ruler of the state?\" Only one who has no desire for rulership can truly be entrusted with the state. Thus it is said that the people of Yue desired to make him their ruler.\n\nHan and Wei contended over disputed territory. Master Zihua visited Duke Zhaoxi, who wore a troubled expression. Master Zihua said: \"Suppose now that the world inscribed a contract before you, its words stating: 'If you seize it with your left hand, your right hand will be severed; if you seize it with your right hand, your left hand will be severed. Yet whoever seizes it shall possess the world.' Would you seize it?\" Duke Zhaoxi said: \"I would not.\" Master Zihua said: \"Excellent. From this perspective, both arms are weightier than the world, and the body is weightier still than both arms. How much lighter, then, is Han compared to the world! And what you now contend over is far lighter than Han. Yet you grieve, harming your life with sorrow and distress—this is truly misguided.\"\n\n*攫 (jué) means to seize or grasp. 铭 (míng) is like a contract. 废 (fèi) means to sever and discard. To seize the contract is to gain the world, yet one who cherishes his body would not seize it—how much less, then, when comparing Han to the world, is it worth the loss! To grieve over not obtaining it, to the point of harming one’s life, is to bring about one’s own ruin—this is weightier even than losing an arm. Thus it is said: to know the weight of things. This analogy is of great benefit to the common world. This passage resembles an Inner Chapter.*\n\nWhen the Lord of Lu heard that Yan He was a man who had attained the Dao, he sent an envoy bearing gifts ahead to him.\n\nYan He dwelt in a humble lane, clad in coarse cloth of hemp and ramie, tending cattle with his own hands. When the envoy of the Lord of Lu arrived, Yan He himself received him. The envoy asked, \"Is this the home of Yan He?\" Yan He replied, \"This is my home.\" The envoy presented the gifts, but Yan He responded, \"I fear the messenger may have misheard and bring blame upon you. It would be better to verify.\" The envoy returned and confirmed the matter, then came back to seek him—but Yan He could no longer be found. Thus one such as Yan He truly despised wealth and honor.\n\nTherefore it is said: the true essence of the Dao is for cultivating the self; its remnants and surplus may be used to govern the state. The chaff and husks may be used to govern the world. From this perspective, the achievements of emperors and kings are but the leftover affairs of sages—never the means to perfect the body or nourish life.\n\nYet today, the gentlemen of the common world often endanger their bodies and abandon their lives in pursuit of external things—is this not lamentable? In all the actions of sages, they must examine their purpose and their means. Now, suppose there were a man here who used the pearl of the Marquis of Sui to shoot a sparrow a thousand *ren* high—the world would surely ridicule him. Why? Because what he employed was weighty, while what he sought was trivial. How much more so is life itself, which far surpasses even the pearl of the Marquis of Sui!\n\n*Hempen cloth of coarse weave. \"Mishearing\" refers to a misunderstanding of words.*\n\nThe term *tu zha* (土苴): the first character is pronounced *che* (上音撦), the second *zhi ya* (下知雅反), meaning dregs or糟粕. This implies that the achievements of emperors and kings in governing the world and the state are, within the Dao of sages, merely leftover affairs. The body is the foundation of the world and the state; cultivating the self enables one to govern the world and the state—this is the discourse of sages and worthies.\n\nZhuangzi’s words make such distinctions, and people often assume he divides matters into refined and coarse, splitting them into two separate realms. Yet they fail to grasp his true intent: that one who understands the Dao is not burdened by external things in their fundamental mind. Thus, Yao’s rejection of the yellow imperial carriage, or Shun and Yu’s non-attachment to possessing the world—only thus can the governance of non-action be fully realized. However, his rhetoric may at times be overly emphatic.\n\nThe four characters *xu yu tu zha* (绪余土苴) arise from these leftover affairs, much like saying dust, filth, chaff, and husks can be molded into Yao and Shun. Where his phrasing exceeds propriety, it is of this kind. Wang Anshi’s scholarship truly takes this as a division into two realms, then seeks to apply it by frequently citing the terms *xu yu* and *tu zha*. This is why Zhu Xi deeply debated the matter.\n\nZhuangzi’s excessive rhetoric may mislead later generations and thus seems blameworthy, yet his true intention was not so. To endanger the body and abandon life in pursuit of external things is precisely to burden the mind with externals.\n\nThe phrase *suo yi zhi* (所以之) means \"that toward which one proceeds.\"\n\nThe phrase *suo yi zhi suo yi wei* (\"that toward which one proceeds, that by which one proceeds\") expresses but a single idea. To shoot a sparrow with a pearl—no one would willingly do so. To burden the body with external things—yet people fail to recognize this. The analogy of the arm is most clear and apt.\n\nThis passage resembles those in the \"Inner Chapters.\" In *Liezi*, when Qiong’s appearance showed the signs of hunger, a guest spoke of it to Ziyang, the ruler of Zheng: \"Lie Yukou is a man of the Dao. Living in your state, he suffers privation—does this not suggest you do not esteem men of worth?\" Ziyang immediately ordered an official to send him grain. Liezi bowed twice to the messenger and declined. When the messenger left, Liezi entered his home, where his wife, striking her breast, said: \"I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all enjoy ease and happiness. Now you show the signs of hunger. The ruler, recognizing his error, sent you food, yet you refused it—is this not fate?\" Liezi laughed and replied: \"The ruler does not know me himself. He sent me grain only because of another’s words. When he punishes me in the future, it will likewise be on the basis of another’s words. This is why I did not accept it.\" In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Ziyang.\n\nThe minister of Zheng said: \"Ziyang was Liezi’s ruler. He sent grain on the basis of another’s words, showing he did not truly know him. If one is not truly known, then praise may be believed, but so too may slander.\" This reasoning is also most apt.\n\nThis passage is similar to one in *Liezi*. When King Zhao of Chu lost his state, a butcher who slaughtered sheep fled with him. When the king returned to his state and was about to reward those who had followed him, the butcher came forward and said: \"When the great king lost his state, I lost my butcher’s stall. Now that the great king has returned, I too have regained my butcher’s stall. My rank and emolument have been restored—what reward is there to give?\" The king said: \"Insist that he accept.\" The butcher replied: \"The great king lost his state not through any fault of mine, so I dared not submit to punishment. The great king’s return is not through any merit of mine, so I dared not claim reward.\" The king said: \"Let me see him.\" The butcher said: \"According to the laws of Chu, only those who have rendered great service may be granted an audience. My wisdom was insufficient to preserve the state, and my courage was insufficient to die defending it. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled in fear of danger—not because I deliberately followed the great king. Now, if the great king wishes to set aside the law and break precedent to see me, this is not what I have heard is right under heaven.\" The king said to Sima Ziqi: \"The butcher’s station is lowly, yet his exposition of principle is lofty. You must secure him for me with the rank of the Three Standards.\" The butcher said: \"I know the rank of the Three Standards is nobler than my butcher’s stall, and the emolument of ten thousand bushels is richer than my butcher’s profit. Yet how could I greedily accept rank and emolument and thereby cause my lord to gain a reputation for reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall.\" He thus declined the offer.\n\nWhen the great king returned to his state, the butcher regained his stall—each returned to his proper place. The Three Standards refer to the Three Dukes. The carriages and robes of the Three Dukes each have their own distinguishing banners, hence the term \"Three Standards.\" This passage is also excellent.\n\nYuan Xian lived in Lu in a walled hut with a circumference of one *du*. The roof was thatched with cogon grass, the door was incomplete, and the hinge was made of mulberry wood. A jar served as the window for two rooms. Coarse cloth stopped the gaps above, while below, dampness seeped through. Yet he sat upright and sang. Zigong arrived in a grand carriage, his inner robe dark blue and his outer robe white, the canopy too wide to pass through the alley. He went to see Yuan Xian. Yuan Xian, wearing a cap of rushes, shoes of hemp, and leaning on a staff of bramble, came to the gate. Zigong said: \"Alas! Master, what ails you?\" Yuan Xian replied: \"I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty, and to study yet be unable to practice is called affliction. Now, I am poor—not afflicted.\" Zigong stepped back, his face showing shame. Yuan Xian laughed and said: \"To act in pursuit of worldly favor, to befriend for mutual advantage, to study for others, to teach for oneself, to use benevolence and righteousness as a pretext, and to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do.\"\n\n*Ci* means thatch; to cover a house with grass.\n\nThe two chambers of their dwelling both used jars as windows—hence \"two chambers with jar-windows.\" Walls were hollowed out to admit light, called *you*; old clothes were used to seal these windows against wind and rain—hence \"coarse cloth to block them.\" *Kuang* means to sit upright. *Gan* is a deep blue-red color. *Biao su* refers to wearing white as an outer robe. \"The canopy too wide to pass through the alley\" describes the narrowness of the lane compared to the carriage. *Hua guan* means a cap made of birch bark. *Xi lv* describes dragging one’s hemp shoes. \"To act in pursuit of worldly favor\" means conducting oneself to curry favor with the age. \"To befriend for mutual advantage\" means associating with unworthy people. \"To study for others, to teach for oneself\" means learning not for one’s own sake but for others, and teaching not for the Dao but for profit. To \"use benevolence and righteousness as a pretext\" is to employ them to gloss over wickedness—hence \"the wickedness of benevolence and righteousness.\"\n\nWhen Master Zeng resided in Wei, his quilted robe had no outer layer, his complexion was swollen, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not kindle a fire, and for ten years he did not make new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its strings snapped; when he grasped his lapel, his elbow showed; when he put on his shoes, the heels split. Yet as he dragged his hemp shoes, he sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth as if issuing from metal or stone. The Son of Heaven could not make him a minister, nor could the feudal lords befriend him. Thus, those who cultivate the will forget the body; those who cultivate the body forget profit; those who attain the Dao forget the mind.\n\nA *yun* robe is today’s padded garment. \"No outer layer\" means the outer fabric was worn through, exposing the padding. *Zhong kuai* describes a swollen, puffy appearance. \"Straightening his cap, the strings snapped\" means that as he adjusted his cap, its ties broke—the ties being what secure the cap. \"Elbow showing\" means the sleeves of his lapel were torn. \"Heels split\" means the backs of his shoes were broken. *Ye xi* means to drag oneself along. *Shang song* refers to the songs he sang. \"As if issuing from metal or stone\" describes the rhythmic quality. \"Those who cultivate the will forget the body\" means they do not burden their minds with nurturing the body. \"Those who cultivate the body forget profit\" means they do not exhaust themselves chasing external things. \"Those who attain the Dao forget the mind\" means that without a mind, one draws near the Dao.\n\nConfucius said to Yan Hui, \"Hui, your family is poor and your station low—why do you not take office?\" Yan Hui replied, \"I do not wish to. Outside the city walls, I have fifty *mu* of fields, enough to provide gruel and porridge; within the city walls, ten *mu* of fields, enough for silk and hemp. Playing the zither is enough for my amusement, and what I have learned of the Master’s Dao is enough for my joy. I do not wish to take office.\" Confucius’s expression changed as he sighed, \"How excellent is Hui’s intent! I have heard that those who know contentment do not burden themselves with profit, that those who are truly self-possessed do not fear loss, and that those who cultivate virtue within are not ashamed without rank. I have recited this for a long time, but only now do I see it in you—this is my gain.\"\n\n\"Fields outside the city walls\" refers to farmland; \"within the city walls,\" to gardens. Yan Hui may not have actually possessed these—Zhuangzi’s words may not be entirely trustworthy. \"What I have learned of the Master’s Dao is enough for my joy\"—but what is this joy? Thus, the Cheng brothers often instructed others to seek Yan Hui’s joy, a matter not to be dismissed lightly. \"Those who know contentment do not burden themselves with profit\" means that those content with themselves have no need of external things. \"Truly self-possessed\" means that if what is within is genuinely sufficient, the loss of external things brings neither joy nor fear. \"Not ashamed without rank\" means not feeling shame at being unknown. \"Recited this for a long time, but only now do I see it\" means having heard these words before but only now witnessing them in a person. \"This is my gain\" means truly having gained a friend.\n\nPrince Mou of Zhongshan said to Zhanzi, \"Though my body dwells by rivers and seas, my heart remains in the palace halls of Wei—what is to be done?\" Zhanzi replied, \"Value life, and profit will become light.\" Prince Mou said, \"Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself.\" Zhanzi said, \"If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow your spirit—why resent it? If one cannot overcome oneself yet forcibly resists, this is called double injury. Those doubly injured do not enter the ranks of the long-lived.\"\n\n\"Heart remains in the palace halls\" means being unable to forget wealth and rank. \"Value life, then profit becomes light\" means that if one recognizes the preciousness of the original mind, external things grow light. \"Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself\" means that principle has not yet triumphed over desire. \"If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow\" means that if the mind cannot yet master itself, one should listen and comply for the time being. This refers to dwelling by rivers and seas while such thoughts occasionally arise—there is no need to forcibly suppress them. If one forcibly suppresses them, it may internally harm the spirit and even lead to illness. Hence, \"If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow\"—following causes no harm to the spirit, so \"why resent it?\" \"Cannot overcome oneself\" is one injury. This refers to the moment when such thoughts arise. If, when these thoughts arise, one forcibly suppresses them instead of complying, the struggle with self-control is a second injury. Hence, \"double injury\"—this is not the way to longevity. \"Do not enter the ranks of the long-lived\" means not joining the category of those who live long.\n\nPrince Mou of Wei was the son of a ruler of ten thousand chariots, yet he retired to cliffs and caves—something difficult for a commoner. Though he had not yet reached the Dao, he could be said to have the intent. These words align with the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s encouragement to practice.\n\nWhen Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, for seven days he ate no cooked food, subsisting on unsalted vegetable broth. His complexion was deeply fatigued, yet he sang in his chamber while playing the zither. Yan Hui was picking vegetables, while Zilu and Zigong discussed, saying, \"The Master was twice expelled from Lu, his traces erased in Wei, his tree felled in Song, and now he is trapped between Chen and Cai. Those who would kill him bear no guilt; those who would lend him aid face no prohibition. Yet he sings and plays the zither without ceasing—can a gentleman be so shameless?\"\n\nYan Hui had no reply. He entered and told Confucius, who pushed aside the zither and sighed deeply, \"You and Ci are petty men! Summon them, and I will speak with them.\" When Zilu and Zigong entered, Zilu said, \"In such circumstances, one could truly be called destitute.\" Confucius said, \"What words are these? When a gentleman is in accord with the Dao, that is called accord; when he is cut off from the Dao, that is called destitution. Now, I embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness yet encounter the calamities of a disordered age—how can this be called destitution? Thus, when I examine myself, I am not cut off from the Dao; when facing adversity, I do not lose my virtue. When the cold arrives and frost and snow descend, I thereby know the flourishing of the pine and cypress. The straits of Chen and Cai may be my good fortune!\"\n\nConfucius then composed himself, returned to the zither, and sang. Zilu, emboldened, took up a shield and danced. Zigong said, \"I did not know the height of heaven or the depth of the earth!\"\n\nThose of old who attained the Dao found joy in poverty and joy in prosperity—their joy did not depend on poverty or prosperity.\n\nWhen the Dao and virtue are present in this way, then destitution and success become as orderly as the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain. Thus, Xu You found joy in Yingyang, and Gong Bo found contentment in Qiushou. \"A broth of greens without a grain of rice\"—this speaks of having vegetables but no rice, yet borrowing from others to press upon them is not forbidden, nor is it deemed a fault. When the cold arrives, one knows the flourishing of the pine and cypress—this is what is meant by \"only when the year grows cold do we know the pine and cypress.\" Through the straits of Chen and Cai, the Way of the sage in enduring destitution can manifest itself and serve as a model for later generations. Thus it is said, \"How fortunate for me in this!\"\n\n*Xiaoran* suggests a carefree and unconstrained manner; *fan qin* means to take up the zither again and play. *Guran* describes a leaping or exultant movement—Zilu, upon hearing these words, rejoiced. The following lines from Zigong indicate his enlightenment through this. Qiushou is the name of a mountain; the so-called Gong Bo may not necessarily refer to the Gonghe Regency—most of these are likely allegorical and difficult to verify in fact. The intent is that Zigong, overjoyed, spoke thus, praising the likes of Xu You who could remain joyful in destitution by delighting in their Way. Xu You and Gong Bo are both invoked through Zigong’s words. Shang and Zhou refer to the Zhou capital, which included the former lands and people of Shang.\n\nShun wished to yield the world to his friend, Beiren Wuze. Beiren Wuze said, \"How strange is the ruler of later times! Dwelling in the fields and furrows, yet wandering at Yao’s gate—this alone would not suffice. Now he further wishes to smear me with his disgraceful conduct. I am ashamed to see him!\" Thereupon he cast himself into the Qingling Abyss.\n\n*\"This alone would not suffice\"* means that Shun’s actions were already improper; your own failings are yours alone to bear—why further defile me? Thus he drowned himself. This account appears nowhere else in the classics and is likely allegorical. *\"Disgraceful conduct\"* refers to base virtue.\n\nWhen Tang was about to attack Jie, he consulted Bian Sui, who said, \"This is not my affair.\" Tang asked, \"Who would be suitable?\" Bian Sui replied, \"I do not know.\" Tang then consulted Wu Guang, who said, \"This is not my affair.\" Tang asked, \"Who would be suitable?\" Wu Guang replied, \"I do not know.\" Tang said, \"What of Yi Yin?\" Wu Guang said, \"He is strong and enduring of filth—I know nothing else of him.\" Tang then conspired with Yi Yin to attack Jie, defeated him, and offered the throne to Bian Sui. Bian Sui declined, saying, \"When the ruler attacked Jie, he consulted me—had I plotted with him, he would have taken me for a traitor. Having defeated Jie, he now offers me the throne—he would take me for a greedy man. I was born in a disordered age, and this man of no Dao has twice defiled me with his disgraceful conduct. I cannot bear to hear of it again!\" Thereupon he cast himself into the Zhou River and died.\n\nTang then offered the throne to Wu Guang, saying, \"The wise plan it, the martial accomplish it, and the benevolent occupy it—this is the Way of antiquity. Why do you not take your place?\" Wu Guang declined, saying, \"To depose a ruler is not righteous; to kill the people is not benevolent; for others to face peril while I enjoy the benefits is not upright. I have heard that one who does not act righteously does not accept its emoluments, and in an age without the Dao, one does not tread its soil—how much less accept its honors? I cannot bear to witness this any longer!\" Thereupon he carried a stone and drowned himself in the Lu River.\n\n*\"Strong and enduring of filth\"* suggests the capacity for action and the patience to endure worldly disgrace. *\"The martial accomplish it\"* refers to those who succeed in warfare. *\"The benevolent occupy it\"* refers to Wu Guang as the benevolent one.\n\nBian Sui and Wu Guang were both recluses of old, though their acts of drowning themselves cannot be verified—these, too, may be allegorical.\n\nIn the rise of the Zhou, there were two knights dwelling in Guzhu named Boyi and Shuqi. The two said to each other, \"We have heard there is one in the west who seems to possess the Dao—let us go and observe.\" When they reached Qiyang, King Wu heard of them and sent the Duke of Zhou to meet them and make a covenant, saying, \"You shall be raised two ranks in wealth and appointed to the first rank of office.\" He then sacrificed an animal, buried its blood, and swore the oath. The two looked at each other and laughed, saying, \"Alas! How strange! This is not what we call the Dao. In ancient times, when Shennong possessed the world...\"\n\nAt that time, sacrifices were performed with utmost reverence yet without prayers for blessings. In their dealings with others, they were loyal and trustworthy, governing with diligence yet seeking nothing in return. They delighted in governance when governing, and delighted in order when order prevailed—not seeking self-perfection through others’ corruption, nor elevating themselves through others’ baseness, nor profiting from the times. Now, the Zhou, seeing the disorder of the Yin, hastily seized power, scheming above while bribing below, relying on military force to maintain authority, slaughtering animals to swear oaths as a pledge of trust, flaunting their conduct to please the masses, and resorting to warfare to secure gain. This is but replacing one chaos with another, one tyranny with another. We have heard that the knights of old, when encountering an age of order, did not shirk their duty, and when facing an age of chaos, did not cling to mere survival. Today, the world is benighted, the virtue of the Zhou has declined—it is but a mire in which to sully ourselves. Better to avoid it and keep our conduct pure.\n\nThe two brothers then journeyed north to Mount Shouyang, where they starved to death. As for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and rank, if they could be done without, they would never rely on them. With lofty integrity and unyielding conduct, they rejoiced in their own resolve, refusing to serve the world. Such was the steadfastness of these two knights.\n\n*Shu* in *Shu Dan* is a term for younger brother. *Adding two ranks of wealth* means doubling their emolument. *Appointed to the first rank of office* refers to the highest grade of official position. *Slaughtering an animal and burying its blood* describes the ritual of swearing an oath with sacrificial blood before interring it. Their reference to Shennong alludes to the ancient age, which was not like this.\n\nSacrifices were performed in their proper seasons with reverence, yet without supplication for blessings. *Governing with diligence yet seeking nothing* means having no desire for fame. *Delighting in governance when governing, and in order when order prevailed* suggests acting without self-serving intent. *Hastily seizing power* describes their eager pursuit of virtuous governance. *Bribing below* refers to using ranks and emoluments to entice the world’s knights. *Relying on military force* means resorting to perilous means. *Maintaining authority* means establishing martial power.\n\nYáng xíng—\"to display one’s conduct\"—means to make one’s name known. *Replacing tyranny with chaos* suggests being no better than Zhòu in evil. *Their alignment with Zhōu*—does this mean I am the same as Zhōu? *This world is but filth and disgrace to my person*—as if wearing court robes and cap while sitting in mud and ashes. *Not relying on it* means not taking it as a resource. Hòu Shān notes that in one’s parents’ years, one still relies on salary—hence the use of this \"rely.\" *Defiant conduct* is excessive. *To be obstinate* means to be excessive and nothing more—this is precisely defiant conduct. It is said that Bóyí and Shūqí did not seek lofty integrity through defiant conduct; had there been even the slightest principle permitting acceptance of wealth and rank, they would have accepted it. They would not have gone to such extreme lengths. Only because there was no justifiable reason to accept did they act thus.\n\n*The world is benighted, the Shāng in chaos*—this refers to Zhōu, which, though newly risen, already acted in such a manner. Hating that it seized the world through cunning schemes, the text calls this \"the decline of virtue.\" This piece is incomplete and resembles the style of *Zhuāngzǐ*, yet passages like *shooting sparrows with a pearl* and *the weight of the world on one’s arms* or *the butcher of sheep* are still fine, though ultimately not equal to his other works. As for *Robber Zhí*, *Sword*, and *Fisherman*, they are even worse.\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* Miscellaneous Chapters, \"Robber Zhí,\" Chapter Twenty-Nine:\nConfucius was a friend of Liǔxià Jì. Liǔxià Jì’s younger brother was named Robber Zhí. Robber Zhí led a band of nine thousand men, rampaging across the world, invading and plundering the feudal lords, breaking into houses, driving off people’s cattle and horses, seizing their wives and daughters, greedy for gain and forgetting kinship, disregarding parents and brothers, and not sacrificing to ancestors. Wherever he passed, the people of great states guarded their cities, while those of small states took refuge in their strongholds—all the world suffered under him.\n\nConfucius said to Liǔxià Jì, \"As a father, one must be able to instruct one’s son; as an elder brother, one must be able to teach one’s younger brother. If a father cannot instruct his son, or an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother, then the intimacy between father and son, elder and younger brother, is worthless. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this age, yet your younger brother is Robber Zhí, a scourge to the world, and you cannot teach him. I secretly feel shame for you. I beg to go and admonish him on your behalf.\"\n\nLiǔxià Jì said, \"Sir, you say that as a father, one must be able to instruct one’s son, and as an elder brother, one must be able to teach one’s younger brother. But if a son does not heed his father’s instruction, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teaching, even with your eloquence today, what can you do? Moreover, Zhí’s nature is such that his mind is like a gushing spring, his will like a whirlwind. He is strong enough to resist enemies, eloquent enough to gloss over wrongs. When things go his way, he is pleased; when they do not, he is enraged. He is quick to insult others with words. You must not go.\"\n\nConfucius did not listen. With Yán Huí driving and Zǐgòng on his right, he went to see Robber Zhí. Robber Zhí was just then resting with his troops on the southern slope of Mount Tài, mincing human livers for his meal. Confucius alighted from his carriage and approached, saying to the herald, \"I, Kǒng Qiū of Lǔ, have heard of the general’s lofty virtue and respectfully bow twice in greeting.\" The herald went in to announce him.\n\nWhen Robber Zhí heard this, he flew into a great rage, his eyes blazing like stars, his hair bristling beneath his cap. \"Is this not that crafty, deceitful man Kǒng Qiū of Lǔ? Tell him for me: you fabricate words, concoct phrases, falsely invoke the names of Wén and Wǔ, wear a cap like a tree branch, gird yourself with the ribs of a dead ox, prattle endlessly with your glib tongue, create right and wrong at will to delude the lords of the world, and lead the scholars of the world astray from their roots. You recklessly preach filial piety and brotherly love, hoping to gain enfeoffment and riches by luck. Your crimes are great and heavy—flee quickly, or I will add your liver to my midday meal!\"\n\nConfucius again sent word, saying, \"I am fortunate to be acquainted with Jì and wish to gaze upon the hem of your robe.\" The herald went in again to announce him. Robber Zhí said, \"Bring him forward.\" Confucius hurried forward, avoided the mat, stepped back, and bowed twice.\n\nRobber Zhí, greatly enraged, stretched out his legs, grasped his sword, glared with bulging eyes, and roared like a tiger. \"Qiū, come forward! If your words please me, you will live; if they displease me, you will die.\"\n\nConfucius said, \"I have heard that there are three virtues in the world. To be born tall and large, handsome and peerless, so that young and old, noble and base all delight in seeing you—this is the highest virtue. To comprehend the workings of Heaven and Earth and distinguish all things—this is the middle virtue. To be brave, resolute, and daring, gathering multitudes and leading armies—this is the lowest virtue.\"\n\n\"Any person possessing even one of these virtues is sufficient to face south and style himself 'Solitary Lord.' Now, General, you combine all three: your body stands eight feet and two inches tall, your face and eyes radiant, your lips like gleaming cinnabar, your teeth like aligned cowries, your voice attuned to the Yellow Bell—yet you are named 'Robber Zhí.' I privately feel shame for you on this account. If you are inclined to heed me, I shall journey south to Wu and Yue, north to Qi and Lu, east to Song and Wei, and west to Jin and Chu, to build for you a great city spanning hundreds of *li*, establish a metropolis of hundreds of thousands of households, and honor you as a feudal lord. Together with the world, we shall begin anew, disband the troops, rest the soldiers, nurture your brothers, and jointly worship our ancestors. This is the conduct of a sage and a man of talent, and the desire of all under Heaven.\"\n\nRobber Zhí, greatly enraged, said, \"Qiū, come forward! Those who can be guided by profit and admonished by words are but the foolish and vulgar common folk. Now, my great stature and beauty, which delight all who see me—these are the inherited virtues of my parents. Though you do not praise me, do I not know myself? Moreover, I have heard that those who delight in flattering others to their face also delight in slandering them behind their backs. Now, you tell me of great cities and multitudes of people, seeking to guide me with profit and treat me as a tamed commoner. How can this endure for long? Of all great cities, none is greater than...\"\n\n\"The world is vast indeed! Yao and Shun possessed all under Heaven, yet their descendants had not even a speck of land to stand a cone. Tang and Wu established themselves as the Sons of Heaven, yet their posterity was cut off and extinguished. Was this not because the profit they sought was too great?\n\nMoreover, I have heard that in ancient times, beasts were many and people few. Thus, the people all dwelt in nests to avoid them, gathering acorns by day and roosting in trees by night—hence they were called the people of the Nest-Builder. In ancient times, the people knew not how to make clothing. In summer, they piled up firewood, and in winter, they warmed themselves by it—hence they were called the people who knew how to live. In the age of Shennong, they lay at ease and rose in peace. The people knew their mothers but not their fathers, and lived among the elk and deer. They tilled the soil to eat and wove cloth to wear, with no thought of harming one another. This was the height of perfect virtue.\n\nYet the Yellow Emperor could not preserve such virtue. He fought with Chiyou at the wilds of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao and Shun arose and appointed ministers. Tang exiled his lord, and King Wu killed Zhou. From that time onward, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many bullied the few. From Tang and Wu onward, all have been the followers of disorder.\n\nNow, you cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, grasp the world’s debates, and teach later generations. You wear fine robes and narrow sashes, speak with artful words and false conduct to delude the lords of the world, all to seek wealth and honor. There is no greater thief than you! Why does the world not call you Robber Qiu, but instead calls me Robber Zhi?\n\nYou used sweet words to deceive Zilu and make him follow you. You made Zilu remove his towering cap and lay aside his long sword to receive your teachings. The world all says, ‘Kong Qiu can stop violence and prohibit wrongdoing.’ Yet in the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei, and when the affair failed, he was minced to pieces at the eastern gate of Wei. This was because your teaching was insufficient.\n\nYou call yourself a man of talent and a sage? Then why were you twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and left with no place in the world to dwell? You taught Zilu to meet such a fate—above, you brought no benefit to yourself; below, you brought no benefit to others. Is your Way worth esteeming?\n\nOf those the world exalts, none surpasses the Yellow Emperor. Yet even he could not preserve his virtue in full. He fought at the wilds of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao was unkind, Shun was undutiful, Yu was crippled by toil, Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli. These six men are those the world exalts. Yet upon examination, all were deluded by profit, forcing themselves to act contrary to their true nature. Their conduct is truly shameful.\n\nAs for the so-called worthy men of the world—Bo Yi and Shu Qi—Bo Yi and Shu Qi renounced the lordship of Gubuzhu and starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their bones and flesh left unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the world and died clinging to a tree. Shentu Di remonstrated but was not heeded; he carried a stone and threw himself into the river, where he was eaten by fish and turtles. Jie Zitui was most loyal: he cut flesh from his own thigh to feed Duke Wen. Later, Duke Wen betrayed him, and Zitui, enraged, left and burned to death clinging to a tree. Weisheng made a tryst with a woman beneath a bridge. When the woman did not come and the waters rose, he did not leave but held fast to the bridge pillar and drowned. These four men were no different from dismembered dogs or drifting pigs. They clutched their begging bowls, all seeking fame and scorning death, heedless of preserving their lives and nurturing their destiny.\n\nOf the so-called loyal ministers of the world, none surpass Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was drowned in the river, and Bigan had his heart cut out. These two men are called loyal ministers, yet in the end, they were laughed at by all under Heaven. From a higher perspective, even Zixu and Bigan are not worth esteeming.\n\nAs for what you, Qiu, have used to deceive me—if you speak to me of spirits and ghosts, I cannot know it. But if you speak to me of human affairs, it is no more than this, all of which I have heard and understood.\n\nNow, let me tell you of human nature: the eyes desire to see beauty, the ears desire to hear...\"\n\nThe eyes desire to see beauty, the ears desire to hear sound, the mouth desires to savor flavor, and the will and qi desire fulfillment. The long-lived reach a hundred years, the moderately long-lived eighty, and the short-lived sixty. Yet within this span, one must subtract days lost to illness, emaciation, mourning, death, and sorrow—so that in a month, one may open one’s mouth to laugh no more than four or five days at most.\n\nHeaven and Earth are without end, but human death comes at its appointed time. Clutching the tools of our fleeting span, we entrust ourselves to the boundless, vanishing in an instant like a swift steed galloping past a crack in the wall. Those who cannot delight their will and nurture their lifespan are not masters of the Dao.\n\nAll that you, Qiu, have spoken are things I reject. Leave at once, return home, and speak no more of it. Your Way is wild and reckless, full of deceit, cunning, and falsehood—it cannot preserve the true. What is there to discuss?\n\nConfucius bowed twice, hurried out the door, mounted his carriage, and grasped the reins—three times he fumbled them. His eyes were dazed, seeing nothing; his complexion was ashen, like dead embers. He leaned against the crossbar, head bowed, unable to catch his breath. Upon returning to Lu, just outside the eastern gate, he encountered Li Xiashu under a willow tree.\n\nLi Xiashu said, “For days now, you have been absent—your carriage and horses bore signs of travel. Might you have gone to see Zhi?”\n\nConfucius looked up to the heavens and sighed. “Yes.”\n\nLi Xiashu said, “Did Zhi perhaps offend you as he did before?”\n\nConfucius said, “Indeed. What I did was like needlessly cauterizing myself when I had no illness—running wildly to measure a tiger’s head, braiding its whiskers, nearly escaping the tiger’s jaws by sheer luck. Entering a fortress, one bolts the gates and guards oneself. My heart surged like a gushing spring, my qi still vigorous; my intent soared like the wind, empty and arrogant, light and reckless. I falsely invoked the ways of Wen and Wu, like stripping bark from a branch to make a cap or flaying an ox’s flank for leather. I was fortunate to gain favor with Xiashu and glimpse his presence beneath the curtain—this was my second audience. Yet he spoke of knowing Heaven and Earth, as if his knowledge could encompass them, as if Heaven and Earth could not escape its bounds. He claimed to discern all things, to possess knowledge without limit. And in the end, this is how it concluded.”\n\nTo grasp its end: Yu became half-paralyzed, his hands and feet calloused. Who could discuss this in detail? His body was torn apart like a dismembered dog, his blood flowed like a slaughtered pig—this was self-destruction. He held a gourd to beg, seeking from others. To be *li* (detached) is to be mired in fame, clinging to names. Thus it is said: to be detached from fame is not to contemplate the root, not to know one’s true nature. *Jiji* (restless) means *jiji* (urgent). Holding the reins, he lost them thrice—this speaks of the reins slipping repeatedly. The carriage and horses bore the marks of travel, as if they had somewhere to go yet were returning. Is it not so subtle as to be absent? Could it be that you have gone to see Robber Zhi?\n\nAs for what came before—those were my former words.\n\nZizhang asked Mang Goude, “Why not act? Without action, there is no trust; without trust, there is no task; without task, there is no profit.” Thus, one observes fame and calculates profit, and righteousness is truly therein. If you abandon fame and profit and return them to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct cannot be absent for a single day.\n\nMang Goude said, “The shameless grow rich; the trusted become prominent. The greatest fame and profit lie in shamelessness and trust.” Thus, one observes fame and calculates profit, and trust is truly therein. If you abandon fame and profit and return them to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct embraces their Heaven.\n\nZizhang said, “In the past, Jie and Zhou were noble as Sons of Heaven, rich with all under Heaven. Now, if you tell a hoarder, ‘Your conduct is like Jie and Zhou,’ they will flush with shame and harbor resentment—this is what petty men despise. Confucius and Mo Di were poor as commoners. Now, if you tell a prime minister, ‘Your conduct is like Confucius and Mo Di,’ they will change their expression and deem it insufficient—this is the true nobility of scholars. Thus, to be powerful as a Son of Heaven is not necessarily noble; to be poor as a commoner is not necessarily base. The distinction between noble and base lies in the beauty or ugliness of conduct.”\n\nMang Goude said, “Petty thieves are imprisoned; great thieves become lords. At the gates of lords, righteous scholars reside. In the past, Duke Huan of Qi, Xiaobai, killed his brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts. To condemn their conduct is to lower them; to discuss their words is to elevate them—this is the contradiction of speech and action warring in the breast. Is it not perverse?\n\nThus, the *Book* says: ‘Who is ugly? Who is beautiful? The successful are heads; the failed are tails.’ Zizhang said, ‘If you do not act, then you will guard against sorrow without order, noble and base without righteousness, elder and younger without sequence. How will the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?’\n\nMang Goude said, “Yao killed his eldest son; Shun exiled his younger brother—was there order in guarding against sorrow? Tang punished Jie; King Wu killed Zhou—was there righteousness in noble and base? King Ji was the rightful heir; the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother—was there sequence in elder and younger? The Confucians speak false words; the Mohists preach universal love—how will the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?\n\nMoreover, you rectify for fame; I rectify for profit. The reality of fame and profit does not accord with principle, does not reflect the Dao. Daily, I dispute with you before Wu Yue, saying: ‘Petty men die for wealth; gentlemen die for fame.’ Their motives differ, their natures change, yet in the end, they abandon what they should do and die for what they should not—this is the same. Thus it is said: ‘Do not act as a petty man, and turn to die for Heaven. Do not act as a gentleman, and follow Heaven’s principle.’\n\nWhether crooked or straight, observe them equally—this is the ultimate principle of Heaven. Facing the four directions, ebb and flow with the seasons. Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism, and intent will wander with the Dao. Without turning, there is no conduct; without completion, there is no righteousness. To lose what you pursue, to gain without seeking, to abandon and follow Heaven—Bi Gan had his heart carved out; Wu Zixu had his eyes gouged out—these were the calamities of loyalty. Zhi Gong testified against his father; Weisheng drowned—these were the disasters of trust. Baozi stood by a pole; Shenzi did not defend himself—these were the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother; Kuangzi did not see his father—these were the failures of righteousness.\n\nThese are what the past transmitted and the present discusses, taking them as the standard for scholars: rectify your words, verify your conduct. Thus, they suffer their misfortunes and encounter their disasters.\n\nWhy not act? This means: why not cultivate virtue? To observe fame and calculate righteousness, and righteousness is truly therein—this means that to seek fame and profit, only cultivating righteousness is correct. If one abandons fame and profit, they turn against their heart and have no joy; they must seek them, and nothing but righteous conduct suffices—this is the intent of studying for official salary.\n\n‘Many trustworthy words bring prominence’—this means using many trustworthy words to seek glory, speaking of feigning trust to benefit oneself. Zizhang spoke of seeking profit through righteousness; Mang Goude said, ‘Those who seek fame and profit today do so through deceit.’\n\nIf you say to abandon fame and profit yet turn against the heart, you must seek them—then follow your heart’s desires, indulging in self-satisfaction as a scheme for mere gain, still preserving Heaven’s truth without affectation. Thus it is said: embrace your Heaven.\n\nPetty thieves are imprisoned; great thieves become lords—this is the argument from the *Opening Trunks* chapter. ‘The contradiction of speech and action warring in the breast’ means their conduct disregards their words, their words disregard their conduct. ‘The successful are heads; the failed are tails’—this is what was previously called: those who seize the moment are followers of righteousness; those who lose it are *kuang* men.\n\nThis intent suggests that acts of benevolence and righteousness are all deceit and not Heaven’s truth. The Five Constants are the five virtues; the Six Positions are the three bonds: ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife.\n\n‘You rectify for fame’ means: if you seek to obtain me through the name of benevolence and righteousness, it is merely for profit, not feigning false names. Fame and profit are not true principles, so it is said: ‘The reality of fame and profit does not accord with principle, does not reflect the Dao.’\n\nWu Yue means ‘unrestrained,’ listening to nature. Mang Goude said, ‘Wu Yue’—this is another allusion in his name, as in the previous chapter’s ‘Knowing Non-Action.’\n\n‘Abandoning what they should do’ means forsaking what they ought to do, not preserving life or protecting nature. ‘Dying for what they should not do’ means acting for profit and fame, which they ought not to do.\n\nTo die for Heaven’s principle and nature is without the names of gentleman or petty man. Thus it is said: ‘Do not act as a petty man, and turn to die for Heaven. Do not act as a gentleman, and follow Heaven’s principle’—this means neither acting as a gentleman nor a petty man, so one can die for the natural principle of your Heaven.\n\nAnd you—whether crooked or straight, observe them equally, for all are the ultimate principle of nature. Thus it is said: ‘Whether crooked or straight, observe them equally as Heaven’s ultimate.’ East, west, south, north each have their direction, and spring, summer, autumn, winter belong to them.”\n\nAll ebb and flow, all coming and going, are but a single qi. Thus it is said: \"Face the four directions and observe the ebb and flow of the seasons. Grasp the round mechanism, and there will be no right or wrong.\" Thus it is said: \"Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism, act with sincere intent, and attain it uniquely for yourself—then you may move with ease and embody the Dao.\" Thus it is said: \"Attain it uniquely, and your intent will wander with the Dao, turning away from it.\"\n\nTo act in opposition to the Dao, to seek success by self-styled righteousness, is to lose what is called one’s original truth. Thus it is said: \"Do not turn and act, do not achieve and claim righteousness—lest you lose what you ought to do, and you yourself.\" To hasten toward wealth and seek to die for one’s achievements is to lose one’s natural Heaven. Thus it is said: \"Do not hasten toward wealth, do not die for achievement—lest you abandon your Heaven.\" The word \"do not\" here means \"must not do this\"—it is a prohibition.\n\nTo rectify one’s words means to take loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and righteousness as true. To ensure one’s conduct means to act with loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and righteousness. \"Clothed\" means to be covered; \"detached\" means to be separated. It is said that one will inevitably suffer harm. Zizhang sought to practice righteousness to attain wealth and honor, borrowing the language of seeking office to lend it a name.\n\n\"Filled by mere acquisition\" means to satisfy one’s desires through mere acquisition, taking it as the natural Dao. Thus, the question and answer are posed: \"Is it not better to follow one’s true nature than to feign virtue for profit and advancement?\" This echoes Mencius’s distinction between the Heavenly nobility and the human nobility.\n\nWu Zu asked Zhi He: \"Among people, there has never been one who did not pursue fame and seek profit. Those who are wealthy are followed by others; those who are followed become lowly; those who are lowly are honored. To see the lowly and honor them is the way to long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment. Yet you alone have no such intent—is it that you lack the wisdom, or that you know but lack the strength to act?\"\n\nZhi He replied: \"Now, these people—those who live in the same era and dwell in the same village as oneself—take themselves for those who transcend the common and surpass the world. They lack any true principle, yet they survey the times of past and present, distinguishing right from wrong. They abandon what is most weighty and cast aside what is most honorable to pursue what they do. How can their discourse on the way to long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment not be far from the mark?\n\nThe pain of sorrow and the comfort of serenity are not reflected in their bodies; the fear of alarm and the joy of delight are not reflected in their hearts. They know how to act but not why they act. Thus, even those who are honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven cannot escape suffering. To 'rectify and not forget' means: Is your lack of desire for wealth and honor due to insufficient wisdom, or do you understand this yet lack the strength to act? Thus, I press the true principle to restrain the heart that seeks wealth and honor, yet you cannot forget it.\n\nThese wealthy and honorable people are those who live in the same era and dwell in the same village as oneself—are they those who transcend the common and surpass the world? They are not so lofty as to be unattainable. Their intent is merely to say: 'These are but ordinary people before my eyes—how could I not know them?' Yet their hearts lack any guiding principle, wholly losing the rectitude of their nature and destiny. They only know how to follow the times to seek their own advantage, being transformed by the common customs. What they do is no different from what ordinary people do.\n\nThe distinction of right and wrong means taking others as wrong and oneself as right, seeking one’s own benefit. 'Past and present' refers to the near and the far—how things were in a previous time, how they are now. They observe the trends of the times to seek their own advantage. What is most weighty and most honorable is the natural principle of Heaven, yet they abandon it all to pursue what they call the quest for wealth and honor. How can this be the way to long life, bodily ease, and nurturing the heart?\n\nThose who seek wealth and honor—whether their bodies are at ease or not, whether their hearts are joyful or sorrowful—they are deluded and unaware, unable to see themselves. Thus it is said: 'Not reflected in the body, not reflected in the heart.' To 'act' is to do what one does—this is human effort. The 'why' of acting is the principle of Heaven. To know human effort but not the principle of Heaven—even if one is Son of Heaven, one cannot escape harm to the body, let alone those below.\"\n\nWu Zu said: \"Wealth, for people, is without disadvantage—it exhausts beauty and exhausts power, reaching what even the utmost person cannot attain, what the worthy cannot match, and what the brave and strong cannot rival. It wields the wisdom and plans of others as its own discernment, and adopts the virtue of others as its own excellence. Without even possessing a state, it commands awe like a lord and father. As for the allure of sounds and sights, flavors and pleasures, power and influence—people delight in them without needing to learn, and their bodies find ease without needing to imitate. Desires and aversions, avoidance and pursuit—these are not taught by a teacher; they are the nature of people. Though all under Heaven may oppose me, who can refuse it?\"\n\nZhi He said: \"The actions of the wise are purposeful, moving with the people without violating their measure. Thus, they are content and do not contend. Without purpose, they do not seek; without insufficiency, they do not contend. They are everywhere yet do not consider themselves greedy; they have surplus yet decline it. They abandon all under Heaven yet do not consider themselves incorrupt. The reality of incorruptibility and greed is not imposed from without—it is reflected in the measure within.\n\nIn power as Son of Heaven, they do not use their nobility to lord over others; possessing all under Heaven, they do not use their wealth to toy with others. They calculate the harm and consider the consequences, seeing it as detrimental to their nature—thus they decline and do not accept. It is not to seek fame and reputation. Yao and Shun ruled as emperors, yet their harmony was not benevolence toward all under Heaven—it was not to harm life with beauty. Shan Juan and Xu You declined the throne, and it was not empty modesty—it was not to harm themselves with affairs. These were all cases of pursuing benefit and declining harm, and all under Heaven calls them worthy. Yet they did not do so to seek fame and reputation.\n\nHere, it does not speak of honor but only of wealth. 'Exhausting beauty' means one can pursue all one desires; 'exhausting power' means one can exercise all authority. Even the utmost person and the worthy cannot match this—it speaks of the power to act for oneself. To 'make others act' and 'wield others' means that wealth can command people—this is the meaning of 'ten thousand spirits in communion.' To desire wealth and hate poverty, to avoid poverty and seek wealth, does not require teaching—it is said: 'It does not await a teacher.' This arises from the natural nature of Heaven. Though all under Heaven may deem it wrong, how can I avoid it?\" This is the speech of the greedy, who are insatiable—thus they are named Wu Zu, the \"Insufficient One,\" and belong to the category of \"filled by mere acquisition.\"\n\nThose who move with the common people speak of how the wise in their actions always take as their foundation what the people jointly receive from Heaven—thus they dare not violate the standards and measures. What the people jointly receive consists of things and principles. Measures are principles. To be content and not contend is to have virtue sufficient within oneself and nothing to strive for. With nothing to rely upon, one does not seek to act; what lies not in others but in Heaven, where human effort has no part—this is called \"nothing to rely upon.\" Knowing that human effort has no part, one ceases to seek. If within oneself there is insufficiency, one exhausts the four directions in striving and seeking, yet does not deem it greed—this is seeking virtue, seeking what lies within. When virtue is sufficient and overflowing, one rejects even external things; though one may reject the world, this is not for the sake of frugality. In both greed and frugality, the reality lies not in acting for others, not in striving outwardly, but in returning to seek within the standards of Heavenly principle and examining them. Thus it is said: \"Returning to examine the measure, using wealth to amuse people and drumming up the world.\" To consider it repeatedly is to turn back to oneself and reflect. To bring harmony to the people in times of change is to harmonize. Not allowing beauty to harm life means acting without acting, not allowing the fame of beauty to harm one’s person. To possess the world yet not be involved with it—this is to say that the worthy name of the world can be possessed without shame. Their practice of the Way and virtue arises from sincerity of the center, not from seeking to raise fame and reputation. Here again, Yao and Shun are placed alongside Xu You as those who love fame.\n\nThe insatiable say: \"One must hold to one’s name, torment the body, reject sweetness, and restrain nourishment to preserve life—this is to suffer long illness and endless distress without dying.\" To know harmony is to be level; excess brings harm. There is nothing that does not follow this, but wealth is its extreme. Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the taste of fine meats and rich wines, stirring his mind and causing him to neglect his proper work—this may be called disorder. Indulging in excess and drowning in surging qi, like bearing a heavy burden while climbing—this may be called suffering. Coveting wealth brings exhaustion; coveting power brings depletion. Dwelling in stillness, one drowns the body; dwelling in ease, one surges—this may be called sickness. Pursuing wealth and chasing profit, one’s ears are filled as if by a wall, yet one does not know to avoid it, surging forward without cease—this may be called disgrace. Wealth accumulates without use; one clings to it without release. The heart is filled with sorrow and vexation, seeking more without end—this may be called worry. Within, one fears the threat of robbery and extortion; without, one dreads the harm of thieves. One surrounds oneself with towers and defenses, dares not walk alone—this may be called fear. These six are the greatest harms under Heaven. All are neglected and unexamined, yet when calamity arrives, one exhausts one’s nature and depletes one’s wealth, seeking in vain to return to a single day of former ease. Thus, if one looks for fame, it cannot be seen; if one seeks profit, it cannot be obtained. Yet one wearies the mind and wears the body, contending for these—is this not delusion?\n\nThose who \"must hold to their name\" speak of those who insist on seeking fame and not the profit of wealth and honor, thus pointlessly tormenting themselves. Though they live, it is as if gravely ill—rejecting sweetness, forsaking fine flavors, restraining nourishment, and practicing frugality in self-care. \"Long illness and endless distress without dying\" is what the *Yi* calls \"steadfast illness, ever undying.\" Levelness brings fortune; excess brings harm. There is nothing that does not follow this, but wealth is its extreme. Though the wording of this passage is rough and its branches and leaves too coarse—falling short of the *Rang Wang* and *Yu Fu*—even these four lines are fine words. How can they be erased? \"The monkey’s cheek\" is called *qian*; \"stirring the mind\" means moving the intent, speaking of enslaving the heart. \"Neglecting one’s work\" is losing what one ought to do.\n\nFuming with qi, his qi obstructed and unable to flow freely—this is *hai*, drowning in discomfort. It is like a man carrying a heavy burden while climbing a height, seeking comfort, seeking sufficiency. \"Taking to the extreme\" means exhausting all use. As the common saying goes: \"When you have power, do not use it all.\" Living in stillness, he drowns—unable to endure idleness, he submerges himself in desires. When the body is sleek and glossy, the one who fumes is full and plump, radiant with health, swelling with arrogance and distension. \"Full as a wall\" speaks of amassing wealth until it towers like a wall—this is what is called the \"thing at the wall.\" Unaware of avoidance, insatiable, he pursues without end. *Feng* means reliance; relying on this, he boasts and cannot let go, clinging to it in his breast, thought after thought unceasing. With thought after thought unceasing, only the look of weariness and sorrow fills his chest—thus it is said, \"a heart full of sorrow, a face of distress,\" never at ease. Even so, he seeks more without cease.\n\n\"Forced taking\" means seizing by force. Those who hoard within their houses fear thieves and robbers, so they build towers and fortify their chambers, encircling their rooms. When venturing out, they fear great bandits, so they muster their retinue and dare not travel alone—guarding their windows. The towers are the structures atop the walls. These six are called: disorder, suffering, illness, disgrace, worry, and fear. \"Neglecting and failing to examine\" means losing restraint and being unaware of it. *Dan* means \"only\"; *gu* means \"matter\"; *fanfu* means \"repeatedly.\" By the time illness and affliction have taken form, even if one wishes to preserve life and relinquish wealth—seeking only to return to the carefree days of poverty—it cannot be attained. \"Exhausting one’s nature to preserve life\" means \"depleting\" and \"removing.\" One wishes to cast off wealth and return to poverty. By this point, where is one’s name? Where is one’s profit? Entangled in thought, the body bound—when contending for profit, one merely binds body and mind, only to bring about this disaster. Is this not foolish?\n\nSu Dongpo said that the four chapters following *Rang Wang* were not written by Zhuangzi. This judgment is exceedingly astute. Among these four, *Dao Zhi* is the most egregious. Yet Sima Qian’s *Biography of Zhuangzi* merely states that *Yu Fu*, *Dao Zhi*, and *Qu Qie* were written to criticize Confucius and his followers, without the slightest doubt as to the refinement or coarseness of the text, or its differences. Why is this? Could it be that Sima Qian’s intent was merely to address the disparagement of the Master, leaving no room to consider the quality of the writing? Otherwise, this book and this chapter, appearing after the Han, may have been altered by later hands due to scattered and lost texts—much like the *Liezi* of today.\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: \"Discourse on Swords\" (Chapter 30)**\n\nLong ago, King Wen of Zhao was fond of swords. Over three thousand swordsmen gathered at his gates as guests, clashing before him day and night. Each year, over a hundred died or were wounded, yet the king’s delight never waned. After three years of this, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against it. The crown prince, Kui, grew anxious and summoned his attendants, saying, \"Whoever can please the king and put an end to these swordsmen will be rewarded with a thousand gold pieces.\" His attendants replied, \"Zhuangzi is the one who can do this.\"\n\nThe crown prince then sent men bearing a thousand gold pieces to offer to Zhuangzi, but Zhuangzi refused to accept them. He went with the messengers to see the crown prince and said, \"What instruction does the crown prince have for me, that he would grant me a thousand gold pieces?\" The crown prince replied, \"I have heard that you are enlightened and sagely. I humbly present these thousand gold pieces as gifts for your attendants. Since you have refused them, how dare I speak further?\" Zhuangzi said, \"I have heard that the crown prince wishes to employ me to end the king’s fondness for swords. If I were to advise the king and oppose his will, and below, fail to meet the crown prince’s expectations, I would face execution and death. How then could I make use of the gold? If I were to advise the king above and meet the crown prince’s expectations below, what in the state of Zhao could I not obtain?\"\n\nThe crown prince said, \"Indeed. But my father, the king, only sees swordsmen.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Very well. I am skilled in the way of the sword.\" The crown prince said, \"But the swordsmen my father sees all have disheveled hair, bristling whiskers, slouching caps with long tassels, short robes, glaring eyes, and speak with difficulty. The king delights in them. Now, if you were to appear before him in Confucian garb, the matter would surely go awry.\" Zhuangzi said, \"I request to prepare the attire of a swordsman.\" After three days of preparing his sword attire, he met with the crown prince, who then presented him to the king. The king drew his naked blade and awaited him.\n\nZhuangzi entered the palace hall without haste and did not bow to the king. The king said, \"What do you wish to teach me, that you have had the crown prince announce you?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"I have heard that Your Majesty is fond of swords, and so I have come to present my swordsmanship.\" The king said, \"What can your sword do to withstand and control others?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"My sword can cut down one man every ten paces and travel a thousand *li* without hindrance.\" The king was overjoyed and said, \"You would be invincible in the world!\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"One who wields the sword shows emptiness, offers advantage, follows with action, and strikes first. I wish to demonstrate this.\" The king said, \"Sir, rest and return to your lodging. I will arrange a contest and summon you.\" The king then had the swordsmen spar for seven days, during which over sixty were killed or wounded. He selected five or six men to present their swords at the foot of the hall and then summoned Zhuangzi, saying, \"Today, I wish to see you spar with these men and test their swords.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"I have long awaited this.\"\n\nThe king said, \"Sir, what kind of weapon do you wield—long or short?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"I am prepared to wield any length. However, I possess three swords, and Your Majesty may choose which to use. Allow me to explain them before demonstrating.\" The king said, \"I wish to hear about the three swords.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"There is the sword of the Son of Heaven, the sword of the feudal lords, and the sword of the common people.\"\n\nThe king said, \"What is the sword of the Son of Heaven like?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"The sword of the Son of Heaven has its blade forged from Yanxi and Shicheng, its edge from Mount Tai of Qi, its spine from Jin and Wei, its grip from Zhou and Song, and its guard from Han and Wei. It is wrapped with the four barbarians, bound with the four seasons, encircled by the Bohai Sea, and girded by Mount Chang. It is governed by the five phases, judged by punishments and virtue, opened by yin and yang, held in spring and summer, and wielded in autumn and winter. When thrust forward, nothing stands before it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it cleaves the floating clouds; below, it severs the roots of the earth. When this sword is once employed, it rectifies the feudal lords, and the world submits. This is the sword of the Son of Heaven.\"\n\nKing Wen appeared lost in thought and said, \"What is the sword of the feudal lords like?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"The sword of the feudal lords has its blade forged from men of wisdom and courage, its edge from men of integrity and incorruptibility, its spine from men of worth and goodness, its grip from men of loyalty and sagacity, and its guard from men of valor and heroism. When thrust forward, nothing stands before it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it models the round heaven, following the three luminaries; below, it models the square earth, following the four seasons; within, it understands the people’s will, bringing peace to the four directions. When this sword is once employed, it is like the shock of thunder. Within the four borders, none do not submit and obey the ruler’s command. This is the sword of the feudal lords.\"\n\nThe king said, \"What is the sword of the common people like?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"The sword of the common people is wielded by men with disheveled hair, bristling whiskers, slouching caps with long tassels, short robes, glaring eyes, and harsh speech. They clash before one another, striking above at necks and throats, and below at livers and lungs. This is the sword of the common people—no different from fighting cocks. A single morning’s life may be cut short. None of these are of use to the state. Now, Your Majesty occupies the throne of the Son of Heaven yet delights in the sword of the common people. I humbly submit that this is unworthy of you.\"\n\nThe sword is of no use to state affairs. Now, Your Majesty holds the position of the Son of Heaven yet favors the sword of the common people—your servant humbly deems this unworthy of you.\" The king then led Zhuangzi up to the palace hall. The royal chef presented the meal, and the king circled the table three times. Zhuangzi said, \"Your Majesty, be seated and compose your qi. The matter of the sword has been settled and reported.\"\n\nThereupon, King Wen did not leave his palace for three months, and the swordsmen all perished where they stood.\n\nThose who delight in the sword delight in the sport of sword-fighting. \"Clustering at the gates\" and \"crowding the doors\" describe the scene. Over three thousand men, skilled in swordsmanship, served as retainers at the king’s gate, their followers sustained by stipends—what today would be called \"rewarding retainers.\" \"Disheveled hair, bristling whiskers\" refers to their exposed hair and whiskers. \"Slouching caps\" means their caps were not worn high, like today’s wrapped headcloths, with tassels dangling beneath the chin. \"Harsh speech\" describes their contentious exchanges when seeking to fight, feigning openings to provoke an attack. \"Striking later yet arriving first\" mimics the hawk’s concealed strike before it pounces. \"Setting the game\" refers to staging swordplay. \"Dun-sword\" means decisive cutting, clashing blades in combat. \"Imperial staff\" denotes the sword’s use by the ruler, a staff held in hand. \"Point\" is the sword’s tip; \"edge,\" its blade. \"Guard\" is the sword’s mouth; \"hilt,\" its handle. \"Enveloped by the four seasons\" signifies its use in accord with the times. \"Governed by the five phases\" means it follows the principles of the five phases. The sun embodies virtue; the moon, punishment—sun and moon, yin and yang, spring and summer, autumn and winter all align with the natural workings of creation. \"Thrusting, lifting, pressing, wielding, cleaving above, severing below\" all describe the vastness of its application. \"Dazed and self-lost\" means that upon hearing these grand words, one realizes the shallowness of their former pursuits and thus feels adrift. \"Above modeling Heaven, below modeling Earth, harmonizing with the people’s will\" corresponds to the harmony of heaven’s timing, earth’s advantage, and human accord. \"The four directions\" refers to the four quarters. \"Led up to the palace hall\" means he was drawn upward.\n\nThe \"three circuits\" means that without sitting, one moves in circles around the land where they would be fed—three full turns. This expresses a sense of self-reproach. \"Submission\" (服) is synonymous with \"surrender\" (伏): since the king did not employ these sword-dancers, they all withdrew and perished in the places where they dwelled.\n\n---\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Nine\n*Classics Section, Daoist Category, Zhuangzi Kouyi*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Ten\nBy Lin Xiayi of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: \"The Fisherman\" (Chapter Thirty-One)**\n\nConfucius wandered in the woods of the Black Curtain and rested, sitting upon the Apricot Platform. His disciples read books while Confucius strummed a zither and sang. Before the song was half-finished, a fisherman came ashore. His beard and brows were snowy white, his hair hung loose, and his sleeves swayed as he walked. Ascending from the marsh to the shore, he stopped, leaning his left hand on his knee and resting his right hand on his chin to listen. When the song ended, he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong, who both faced the guest. Pointing at Confucius, the guest asked, \"Who is that?\"\n\nZilu replied, \"A gentleman of Lu.\"\n\nThe guest inquired about his clan, and Zilu answered, \"The Kong clan.\"\n\nThe guest asked, \"What does the Kong clan govern?\"\n\nZilu did not respond, but Zigong answered, \"The Kong clan cultivates loyalty and trust in their nature, practices benevolence and righteousness in their conduct, refines ritual and music, and selects proper human relationships. Above, they are loyal to the ruler of the age; below, they transform the common people, all to benefit the world. This is what the Kong clan governs.\"\n\nThe guest asked again, \"Is he a lord with lands?\"\n\nZigong said, \"No.\"\n\n\"Is he an advisor to kings and marquises?\"\n\nZigong said, \"No.\"\n\nThe guest laughed and turned to leave, saying, \"He may be benevolent, but I fear he will not escape harm. He wearies his mind and exhausts his body, endangering his true nature. Alas, how far he has strayed from the Dao!\"\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside the zither and rose, saying, \"Is he a sage?\" He then descended to seek him by the marsh’s edge, where the fisherman was about to pole his boat away. Turning and seeing Confucius, he stood facing his village. Confucius retreated, bowed twice, and approached.\n\nThe guest said, \"What do you seek?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"Just now, sir, you left with words unfinished. I, unworthy as I am, do not understand their meaning. I have waited humbly in your presence, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or spittle to complete my instruction.\"\n\nThe guest said, \"Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!\"\n\nConfucius bowed twice and rose, saying, \"From my youth, I have cultivated learning, and now, at sixty-nine, I have yet to hear the ultimate teaching. How dare I not empty my heart?\"\n\nThe guest said, \"Like seeks like, and sounds resonate with their kind—this is the principle of Heaven. Let me explain what I possess and expound upon what concerns you. What concerns you is human affairs: the Son of Heaven, feudal lords, great officers, and common people—these four ranks, when properly ordered, bring the finest governance. If these four abandon their positions, no greater disorder arises. When officials manage their duties and people attend to their tasks, none overstep their bounds. Thus, fields lie fallow, homes stand exposed, clothing and food are insufficient, taxes are unpaid, wives and concubines quarrel, and elders and juniors lack order—these are the worries of the common people. Inability to fulfill duties, mismanagement of office, impure conduct, neglect of subordinates, failure to achieve merit, and loss of rank and salary—these are the worries of great officers. The court lacks loyal ministers, the state is in chaos, craftsmen lack skill, tribute is unrefined, the seasons and ranks are disordered—these are the worries of the Son of Heaven and feudal lords. Yin and yang fall out of harmony, cold and heat arrive untimely, harming the myriad things; feudal lords act violently, seizing and attacking one another, ravaging the people; ritual and music lack restraint, resources are exhausted, human relationships are unordered, and the common people are licentious—these are the worries of the Son of Heaven’s ministers.\n\nNow, you possess neither the authority of a lord or minister above nor the office of a great officer below, yet you presume to refine ritual and music, select proper human relationships, and transform the common people. Is this not excessive meddling?\n\nMoreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these cannot go unexamined.\n\nTo meddle in affairs not one’s own is called *zong* (officiousness).\nTo advance without regard is called *ning* (obsequiousness).\nTo speak to curry favor is called *tao* (flattery).\nTo speak without discerning right or wrong is called *fang* (recklessness).\nTo delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *chan* (slander).\nTo sever close relationships is called *zei* (treachery).\nTo praise falsely to harm others is called *te* (malice).\nTo accommodate both good and bad with a pleasing countenance, seeking to gain what one desires, is called *xian* (deviousness).\n\nThese eight flaws externally confuse others and internally harm oneself. The noble person does not befriend such people, and the enlightened ruler does not employ them.\n\nThe four perils are:\nTo love undertaking great affairs, altering constants to seek merit and fame, is called *tao* (presumptuousness).\nTo monopolize knowledge, arrogate affairs, encroach upon others, and act self-righteously is called *tan* (greed).\nTo see one’s faults yet not change, and to hear remonstrance yet grow more obstinate, is called *hen* (stubbornness).\nTo approve of those who agree with oneself and disapprove of those who disagree, even if they are good, is called *jin* (arrogance).\n\nOnly by eliminating the eight flaws and avoiding the four perils can one begin to be taught.\"\n\nThe Black Curtain was the name of the woods.\n\nLifting the sleeves is called *yumei* (raising the sleeves). To select from human relationships is to choose their principles to teach others. In \"acting and speaking,\" he did not inform Zilu or Zigong but departed while acting and speaking. \"Far indeed!\"—this refers to their separation from the Dao being distant. A boat pole is called *nao*. \"Turning and running\" means retreating several steps before advancing. \"Threaded words\" are subtle words, meaning they are briefly spoken but not exhaustive. \"Finally assisting Qiu\" means that in the end, they taught and aided Qiu. \"Harmonizing in sound and responding in voice\" means that this principle is universally possessed by all people. \"Releasing what I possess\" means to let go of the Dao that I possess. \"The *Jingzi*’s *suoyi*\" refers to systematically presenting what people ought to know. \"Releasing\" means to put down without attachment. \"Systematically presenting\" means to arrange in order. The four [virtues] each correct themselves and fulfill their duties. When the four depart from their positions and encroach upon one another’s affairs, each office governs its own duties, and each person worries about their own tasks—this is called *yousi* (anxious thought). As the *Odes* says, \"In office, think of your anxieties.\" \"Thus, there is no encroachment\"—they do not overstep or seize one another. \"Taxes and levies are not continuous\"—they are not sustained. \"Meritorious beauty is not possessed\"—there is no merit. \"Not holding fast\" means being unable to maintain and guard. In the *Spring and Autumn*, the latter generations lost the order of court visits. The \"officers of the Son of Heaven\" are the Son of Heaven’s dukes and ministers. \"Engaging in affairs that are not one’s own\" is called *zong*—taking on matters that are not one’s own and forcing oneself to do them, self-aggrandizing. \"Advancing without being heeded\"—not allowing them to speak yet forcing their words forward, flaunting eloquence. \"Flattery\" refers to eloquence. \"Dissolving and separating others’ close relationships\" is to harm them treacherously. \"Praising with falsehood\" is to praise what should not be praised, privately deceiving. \"Ruining and shaming\" is like disgracing—disparaging what should not be disparaged. Praise and blame arising from private motives are merely villainy—concealing wickedness. \"Adapting one’s countenance to others’ preferences\" is called *yan shi*—whether good or bad, one desires to please them, hence \"two-faced.\" Discerning others’ desires and subtly promoting them to amplify their faults—this is a treacherous person. The \"eight flaws\" refer to these eight as major defects; the noble person does not befriend them, and the enlightened ruler does not employ them. \"Loving to undertake great affairs\" is to delight in managing the state’s major matters. \"Altering and changing to seek merit and fame\" is to change constant laws in order to establish lofty achievements—this is called *tao* (presumptuousness). \"Monopolizing knowledge and arrogating affairs\" is to rely on private wisdom, exclusively control matters, encroach upon others’ authority, and delight in self-reliance—this is called *tan* (greed). \"Stubborn\" means obstinacy and refusal to accept remonstrance. \"Even if others are good, if they disagree with oneself, one deems them not good\"—this is called *jin* (arrogance). These four are humanity’s great perils. Only by eliminating these flaws and perils can one begin to learn the Dao, hence \"only then can one be taught.\" All these are what you, Master, should employ in the world, hence \"the *suoyi* of you, Master\"—to use them for self-examination and defense.\n\nConfucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying, \"I, Qiu, was twice exiled from Lu, had my traces erased in Wei, had my tree felled in Song, and was besieged in Chen and Cai. I do not know what faults I committed to incur these four slanders. Why?\" The guest’s expression turned mournful as he said, \"How difficult it is for you to awaken! There was a man who feared his shadow and hated his footprints, so he ran to escape them. The more he lifted his feet, the more footprints there were; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing he was still too slow, he ran without rest, exhausted his strength, and died—unaware that if he had stood in the shade, his shadow would have vanished, and if he had rested in stillness, his footprints would have ceased. How foolish! You scrutinize the boundaries between benevolence and righteousness, examine the distinctions between sameness and difference, observe the changes of activity and stillness, measure the degrees of giving and receiving, discern the principles of likes and dislikes, and harmonize the moderation of joy and anger—yet you nearly could not avoid [these slanders]. If you carefully cultivate yourself, guard your true nature, and return things to others, you will have no burdens. Now, you do not cultivate yourself but seek from others—is this not misplaced?\"\n\n\"Not knowing what faults\" means not knowing what transgressions. The \"four slanders\" are the four humiliations in Lu, Wei, Song, Chen, and Cai. \"Standing in the shade\" and \"resting in stillness\" are metaphors for the Dao. \"Scrutinizing the boundaries between benevolence and righteousness\" means distinguishing the different principles of benevolence and righteousness. \"The distinctions between sameness and difference\" refer to the divisions of right and wrong. \"The changes of activity and stillness\" mean adapting to the times. \"The degrees of giving and receiving\" refer to the moderation of speech and acceptance. \"The principles of likes and dislikes\" and \"the moderation of joy and anger\" clarify the principles of human nature. The Fisherman’s intent is that your, Master, actions are all for others, not for yourself, which is why you could not avoid the four slanders. If you cultivate yourself and guard your original true nature, following the natural Dao without opposition between self and others, you will have no burdens. \"Returning things to others\" means returning external things to others and unifying them with nature, so that self and others do not oppose one another. Now, you do not seek within yourself but are eager to act for others—this is attending to externals rather than internals.\n\nConfucius’s expression turned solemn as he said, \"May I ask what is meant by 'true'?\" The guest replied, \"Truth is the utmost of sincerity. Without sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, forced weeping, though sorrowful, is not mournful; forced anger, though stern, is not awe-inspiring; forced affection, though smiling, is not harmonious. True sorrow is silent yet mournful; true anger is unexpressed yet awe-inspiring; true affection is unsmiling yet harmonious. When truth is within, the spirit moves without—this is why truth is valued. Applied to human principles: serving parents with filial piety, serving the ruler with loyalty, drinking with joy, and mourning with grief. Loyalty is based on achievement, drinking on pleasure, mourning on sorrow, and serving parents on comfort. The beauty of achievement leaves no single trace. Serving parents with comfort does not inquire into the means; drinking with joy does not select the vessels; mourning with grief does not question the rites. Rites are what the world’s customs create; truth is what one receives from Heaven. It is natural and unchangeable. Thus, the sage models Heaven and values truth, not constrained by custom. The foolish do the opposite: they cannot model Heaven but worry about people, do not value truth, and meekly conform to custom—how pitiful! You, Master, were early immersed in human artifice and late in hearing the great Dao.\"\n\n\"Not moving others without sincerity\" echoes the idea of utmost sincerity moving even spirits. \"Forced weeping,\" \"forced anger,\" and \"forced affection,\" along with \"true sorrow,\" \"true anger,\" and \"true affection\"—these six phrases are extremely precise. \"When truth is within, the spirit moves without\" means that what is within must manifest without; the spirit moving refers to the spirit being stirred externally.\n\nTo serve one’s parents with what suits them is to suit their wishes. The beauty of a task’s completion lies in leaving no trace—having accomplished it yet claiming no ownership, having done nothing that leaves a mark. \"Not selecting the provisions\" means not choosing the flavors. \"Without questioning their rites or their ease\" refers to Ning Qi.\n\nRites are external embellishments, hence called \"what the world and custom create.\" Truth is the principle of Heaven’s mandate and naturalness. To \"model Heaven and value truth without being constrained by custom\" is not to be bound by what the world and custom favor. \"Worrying about people\" means fretting over not conforming to others. Not knowing the nobility of Heaven’s rank, they do not value truth, taking the emoluments of custom as their reward and willingly being transformed by the common tide—hence \"meekly conforming to custom and being altered by it.\" Such people are always seen as unworthy, ever lacking.\n\n\"Immersed in human artifice\" means drowning in learning that pursues externals. Confucius again bowed twice and rose, saying: \"Today, I, Qiu, have had this encounter—how fortunate, as if Heaven had willed it! That you, Master, do not disdain to compare me to a servant and personally instruct me—dare I ask where you reside? I would follow to receive your teachings and complete my study of the great Dao.\"\n\nThe guest replied: \"I have heard that those who can be led may be taken to the subtle Dao; those who cannot be led do not understand the Way. Be cautious not to accompany them, lest you bring harm upon yourself. Strive on! I leave you now. I leave you now.\" Then he poled his boat away, gliding along the reeds.\n\nYan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed the strap to Confucius. Confucius did not look back, waiting until the water’s ripples stilled and the sound of the pole could no longer be heard before daring to board. Zilu stood beside the carriage and asked: \"I, You, have served you for a long time, yet never have I seen you, Master, encounter someone with such awe. Kings of ten thousand chariots and lords of a thousand chariots, when they meet you, never fail to accord you equal standing and courtesy. Yet you still bear a haughty demeanor. Now, this old fisherman, leaning on his staff, stood facing you, and you bent at the waist, bowed repeatedly, and responded—was this not excessive? All your disciples find it strange. How could this fisherman deserve such treatment?\"\n\nConfucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed: \"How difficult it is to transform you, You! You have been steeped in ritual and propriety for some time, yet your coarse and vulgar heart remains unchanged to this day. Let me tell you: to meet an elder without respect is to lack propriety; to meet a worthy without reverence is to lack benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself. Without utmost sincerity, one cannot attain his truth. Thus, he would long harm his person. Alas! Nothing brings greater misfortune to a person than lacking benevolence—and you alone excel at it!\n\nThe Dao is the path by which all things proceed. Those who lose it die; those who attain it live. In affairs, opposing it brings failure; following it brings success. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage honors it. This old fisherman possesses the Dao—how dare I not revere him?\" \"Comparing me to a servant\" means treating me like a disciple.\n\nLeaving his place to inquire after the elder’s dwelling, he followed along the reeds, using his oar to push the boat away from the shore—these four characters depict the scene with a painter’s brush. The water’s ripples stilled as the boat drifted into the distance. Such was his awe: to stand facing him in opposition, to bow in response, hands clasped in reverence.\n\n\"To be steeped in ritual and propriety for some time\" means you have long been immersed in the study of rites and virtue. \"If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself\" signifies that had the old fisherman not been a perfected one, how could he have compelled such deference and reverence? \"Without utmost sincerity, one cannot attain his truth\" means that only by humbling oneself with perfect sincerity to seek instruction can one hope to receive true teaching. This line is the foundation of learning. \"Thus, he would long harm his person\" warns that without such an approach, one gains no benefit and only harms oneself. The life and death of all things lie within the single Dao—the old fisherman possessed the Dao. I revere his Dao, and thus I honor him.\n\nFrom \"Yielding the Throne\" onward, the four chapters differ in style from *Zhuangzi*’s own work. Even in \"Yielding the Throne,\" there remain one or two passages of merit, while the \"Fisherman\" chapter also has its strengths. The \"Robber Zhi\" chapter, however, is even cruder and more blunt than \"The Old Fisherman.\" According to the \"Robber Zhi\" chapter, the term \"prime minister\" did not exist in the Warring States period—this is clearly a later fabrication. The *Han shu*’s \"Treatise on Arts and Letters\" records fifty-two chapters of *Zhuangzi*, a number differing from the present text. The *Tang shu* lists only forty chapters, which correspond to the version now in circulation. It is unclear whether the fifty-two chapters included \"Yielding the Throne,\" \"The Old Fisherman,\" and the like, or if there were other chapters by Zhuangzi that have since been lost.\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters, \"Lie Yukou\" (Chapter 32):**\nLie Yukou was traveling to Qi when he turned back midway. He encountered Bohun Wuren, who asked, \"Why have you returned?\"\n\"I was alarmed,\" Lie Yukou replied.\n\"By what?\"\n\"I once dined at ten millet-sellers’ stalls, and at five of them, they served me first.\"\nBohun Wuren said, \"If that is so, why were you alarmed?\"\nLie Yukou answered, \"When inner sincerity is not dissolved, one’s outward demeanor shines with a radiance that overawes others, making them defer to one’s age and overlook their own concerns. Those millet-sellers merely sell gruel for profit, seeking surplus gain and slight advantage. If even they were so affected, how much more would a lord of ten thousand chariots be?\"\n\nLie Yukou said, \"If I exhaust my body in service to the state and deplete my knowledge in handling affairs, they will entrust me with tasks and demand results from me. This is why I was alarmed.\"\n\nBohun Wuren said, \"Excellent! Observe: when you abide thus, others will cherish you.\" Before long, he went to visit, and the shoes outside the door were already filled. Bohun Wuren stood facing north, leaning on his staff, his chin nearly touching it. After a while, he said nothing and left. The attendant reported this to Liezi. Liezi, barefoot and carrying his shoes, ran to the gate and said, \"Since you have come, Master, why not offer a remedy?\"\n\nBohun Wuren replied, \"It is done. I had already told you that others would cherish you, and indeed they do. It is not that you can make others cherish you, but that you cannot prevent them from doing so. Why then do you let this move you, producing such a strange response? You will surely be stirred by external things, yet your fundamental nature remains unchanged—what is the point? Among those you associate with, none will tell you this. Their petty words are all poison to men. None awaken, none comprehend—how can they scrutinize one another? The cunning toil, the wise worry, the incapable seek nothing. Sated with food, they roam freely, drifting like an untethered boat, empty and wandering. Why turn back midway? What words did you leave behind? At ten millet-sellers’ stalls, five served you first without waiting for payment. Their reverence for you arises from the harmony and compliance accumulated within, which blossoms outward. This is the teaching of the sages: when inner sincerity is not dissolved, it accumulates within but has yet to transform. Dissolution is transformation; demeanor is movement.\"\n\nForm and demeanor—these are the movements and appearances of the body. One who has attained radiance possesses a luminous bearing. This is the meaning of \"inner accumulation blossoming outward,\" yet it is taken as a learning of traces, something that externally subdues people’s minds. To subdue is to overawe. It means: \"I have not yet transcended traces, so others can perceive me, and thus their hearts submit in reverence.\"\n\nZhaozhou said: \"This old monk’s cultivation lacks strength, for the spirits have seen through it.\" This is the same idea. The noble and the aged are naturally revered, yet I am neither old nor noble—those people instead hold me in higher regard than such figures. Reverence for oneself surpasses even that for the noble and aged.\n\n聚 means to gather; 积 means to accumulate. These matters, when accumulated over time, will inevitably become afflictions and harms. The more one’s fame and traces are exposed, the less one can escape the perils of the age. \"Surplus and excess\" speak of seeking profit—desiring only to have more, to possess abundance. 餘 (surplus) means remainder.\n\nThose in the world with power and influence can weigh others lightly, even a humble millet-seller. Initially, I had no authority to weigh others, yet they revered me so. How much more so for a ruler, whose body is wearied and whose wisdom is exhausted? They will inevitably seek me out to employ me, to have me present my achievements. This is what is meant by \"accumulating their troubles.\"\n\nTo present is to offer. The deluded rejoice in this, saying, \"Excellent!\" Observe this—it means you possess a single eye for such matters. Then he says, \"You should stop now,\" meaning there is no need to travel further. People will come to you, follow you, and take you as their teacher.\n\n处 means to dwell; 已 is an auxiliary particle; 保 means to preserve or guard. When followers gather in numbers and guard your gate, this single word *preserve* already carries a sense of insufficiency. For the deluded one’s vision has ascended yet another level.\n\n\"The shoes outside the door are full\"—disciples abound. \"Leaning on his staff, he presses it to his chin\"—he stands his staff upright and rests his chin upon it. 蹙 means to press or lean. 宾者 refers to one who receives guests.\n\nHe rushes to greet the deluded one with his shoes in hand—ancients, when sitting on mats, would remove their shoes before entering, but in his haste to welcome, he does not have time to put them on.\n\n*Dispensing medicine* refers to teachings that open and awaken, serving as remedies. *Cease your words*—I have already said that people will come to guard you. You cannot prevent others from preserving you, which is what is meant by \"forgetting the self is easy; making others forget you is difficult.\"\n\n*Yet why*—why have you come to this? People are moved and delighted by you only because you cannot conceal yourself, causing your strangeness to manifest outwardly and thus drawing them in. Hence it is said: delight arises from displaying difference.\n\nSince you are like this, not only can you not hide your outward form, but you will inevitably disturb and shake your fundamental nature, which is even more harmful to yourself. *No benefit* means no advantage; *even more* emphasizes this.\n\nThose who associate with you are your friends, but their learning is not yet profound, so their words are shallow and common—hence *petty words*. Their speech can poison and harm others, and since no one can admonish or correct you, you will never awaken. Who will ever ask how you are faring?\n\n*Who among them*—who is there to inquire? *Mutual questioning* is the sense here.\n\nGenerally, in the world, the cunning exhaust themselves with schemes, the wise wear themselves out with thought, but those who embody the Dao and follow nature, not employing their abilities, seek nothing from external things. They simply eat their fill and wander freely—adrift like an untethered boat, their minds unattached to anything.\n\nThe culmination lies in a single word: *emptiness*. Empty, one merges with the great void and roams in the origin of things. *No ability* means *non-action*.\n\nZheng’s man was Huan. After groaning in the land of Qiu for three years, Huan became a Confucian. The river moistens nine *li*, and the marsh reaches three clans. When his younger brother Mo became a Mohist, the two debated, and their father aided Di. After ten years, Huan killed his father. His father appeared to him in a dream, saying, \"If your son had become a Mohist, it would have been me.\"\n\nHe once examined his mulberry tree, which had already borne autumn cypress fruit. The Creator’s retribution does not punish the person but punishes the person’s *Heaven*. Thus, it caused that man to regard himself as special, distinct from others, and to despise his kin. The people of Qi who drew water from the same well would fight one another.\n\nHence it is said: in this age, all are Huan. From this, those with virtue pretend not to know—how much more so those with the Dao?\n\nIn ancient times, this was called \"the punishment of fleeing from Heaven\"—moaning and chanting in song. \"Only three years\" means exactly three years. \"The river moistens nine *li*\" is a metaphor for the breadth of one’s influence reaching others. With his remaining resources, he enabled his younger brother to study Mohism. Huan became a Confucian, while his brother Di became a Mohist. As their teachings differed, debates arose. Their father, loving his younger son, sided with Di. Huan, resenting his father, killed himself. In a dream, his father appeared to him, saying, \"Had I provided for your brother to become a Mohist, it would have been my remaining virtue.\"\n\nNow, brothers had already quarreled and killed themselves, yet the pines and cypresses on my grave have already borne fruit—speaking of how long he has been dead. *Liang* (良) may also be written as *yin* (垠), pronounced like *langmeng* (浪蒙). \"Why did Huan examine his *liang*?\" means, \"Why did he not see my obscurity?\" *He* (阖) and *hu* (胡) both mean \"why.\" Citing this old story, Zhuangzi then concluded: Huan believed that had his brother become a Mohist, it would have been because of him, not knowing that the Creator’s retribution for a person does not respond to human ability but to what that person has received from Heaven. Had his brother studied Mohism and mastered it, it would have been the Creator responding to his Heavenly endowment—not because of Huan’s human effort in providing for him.\n\nThus, the Creator (the first *bi* 彼) caused him (the second *bi* 彼, referring to Di) to regard himself (this *fu ren* 夫人, referring to Huan) as special, distinct from others—believing his Confucian learning and influence reaching three clans made him superior—and to despise his kin, resenting his father. It was Heaven that enabled Di to master Mohism, yet Huan took credit and resented his father, not understanding Heaven. A wellspring flows naturally; the people of Qi, drawing from the same natural water, fought one another over it. Was this water their private possession? Their perception was the same as Huan’s. People of this age all fail to understand Heaven and contend with private intentions. Thus, it is said: in this age, all are Huan.\n\nObserve how, from \"Thus, it caused that man\" to \"would fight one another,\" the language is Zhuangzi’s own. In the *Rang Wang* and subsequent four chapters, how could such words appear? Those with virtue still regard the Creator as unknowable—how much more so those with the Dao?\n\nZhuangzi’s words often imply that beyond one layer lies another, distinguishing between those with the Dao and those with virtue. \"Fleeing from Heaven\" means abandoning Heavenly principle; \"punishment\" means offending the Creator. This sentence rebukes Huan’s kind.\n\nThe sage finds peace in what is naturally peaceful and does not seek peace in what is not. The multitude finds peace in what is not naturally peaceful and does not find peace in what is. Zhuangzi said: Knowing the Dao is easy; not speaking of it is difficult. To know and not speak is to align with Heaven. To know and speak is to align with man. The ancients aligned with Heaven, not man. What is naturally peaceful is Heavenly principle; what is not is human artifice. \"Not speaking is difficult\" means it is hard to forget words. To know the Dao and forget words is to follow Heaven. To know the Dao yet still rely on words is not yet free from human artifice—traces remain. The ancients were purely of Heaven, not man.\n\n*Zhi* (之) means \"to go.\" \"To align with Heaven\" means to return to Heaven; \"to align with man\" means to return to man.\n\nZhu Pingman studied dragon-slaying from Zhi Liyi, exhausting a family’s thousand gold. After three years, his skill was perfected, yet there was no dragon to slay. This is meant to illustrate that Zhuangzi’s Dao is vast but has no place to be applied.\n\nThe sage treats the inevitable as inevitable, hence has no weapons. The multitude treats the inevitable as not inevitable, hence has many weapons. To follow the way of weapons is to act with intent; relying on weapons leads to destruction. The \"inevitable\" is the unknowable. To treat the unknowable as inevitable is to claim knowledge of the unknown. Having no weapons means no conflict. The multitude treats the unknowable as knowable, hence much contention. War is the greatest form of conflict, so it is used as the prime example. If one follows the heart of contention, then in conduct one always seeks an enemy—unable to forget the distinction between self and others. Thus, it is said: to follow the way of weapons is to act with intent. To rely on the contention of knowledge and strength will inevitably lead to self-destruction. Thus, it is said: relying on weapons leads to destruction.\n\nThe knowledge of petty men does not extend beyond bribes and letters, yet they exhaust their spirit in trivial, shallow matters, seeking to govern all things and guide the myriad beings toward the Great Unity and formless emptiness. How could this be possible? \"Formless emptiness\" means formlessness. With such limited perception, they are confused by the universe—space above and below, time past and present—unaware that they are bound by form and do not comprehend the principle of the Great Beginning. Only the perfected person returns their spirit to the beginning of nothingness and delights in dwelling in the realm of non-existence. *Gan* (甘) means \"delight\"; *min* (瞑) means \"sleep.\" The delight of sleep is a metaphor for peaceful dwelling.\n\nWater flows without form, disperses into the Great Purity. Alas! Your knowledge clings to the finest hair yet does not know the Great Peace. Water flows, and all see its form, not knowing it arises from the formless—speaking of its origin in nothingness. When it disperses and departs, people again do not know it returns to the Great Purity. The Great Purity is the Great Void. This is meant to show that ordinary people do not understand the beginning and end of things, just as they observe water. Thus, it is said: \"Your knowledge clings to the finest hair\"—speaking of how small their perception is. The Great Peace is the principle of non-action and naturalness. \"Alas!\" precedes \"you,\" lamenting their limited vision.\n\nThere was a man of Song named Cao Shang who was sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. On his journey, he obtained several chariots. Pleased, the King of Qin added a hundred chariots. Returning to Song, he saw Zhuangzi and said: \"To dwell in a poor alley, a narrow lane, in hardship—weaving sandals, with a withered neck and yellowed face—this is what I am not good at. To awaken the lord of ten thousand chariots and follow with a hundred chariots—this is what I excel at.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"The King of Qin had an illness and summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one chariot; those who licked hemorrhoids received five chariots. The lower the treatment, the more chariots they received. Did you perhaps treat his hemorrhoids? How else could you have obtained so many chariots? Be gone!\"\n\nWeaving sandals speaks of poverty and self-reliance in crafting footwear. A withered neck and yellowed face speak of his aged state—a neck emaciated and fleshless, ears sallow and shriveled. *Cuo* is also an abscess, a kind of *yong*; abscesses afflict the upper body, while hemorrhoids afflict the lower. The lower the physician’s treatment, the greater his reward. To gain chariots by licking hemorrhoids is base and shameful, unworthy of esteem.\n\nDuke Ai of Lu asked Yan He, “I rely on Confucius as the steadfast pillar of the state—might our ills yet be cured?”\nYan He replied, “Perilous indeed! How precarious! Confucius busies himself adorning feathers and painting designs, engaging in florid speech, using props to shore up defenses, suppressing his nature to impress the people—yet he knows not whether what he receives is sincere or whether his heart governs his spirit. How could such a one lead the people? He suits only you and me, those who err and delude ourselves. Now, to cause the people to abandon substance and learn falsity is no way to guide them. Considering posterity, it would be better to cease this.\n*Steadfast and firm* suffice to *support affairs*—the *Odes* say, ‘As the ridgepole of the hall, steadfast and firm.’ *Steadfast and firm* mean worthy assistance.\n*Might our ills yet be cured* speaks of the state’s maladies that might yet be remedied.\n*Precarious* means danger.”\n\n\"‘Precarious’ also means danger. ‘How precarious! So rickety!’—this speaks of extreme peril. ‘Painting designs’ refers to decorative colors. When things are already adorned with colors and further embellished with feathers, this describes excessive ornamentation. ‘Florid speech’ means extravagant, lavish words. ‘Using props to shore up defenses’ means his guiding intentions know not their root. ‘Suppressing his nature’ means forced and strained conduct. ‘To impress the people’ means to stand above them. ‘Knows not whether what he receives is sincere’ means he does not recognize its falsity. ‘Whether his heart governs his spirit’—does his heart cling to this? ‘Whether his spirit is mastered by this’—does his spirit take this as its ruler?\n\n‘How could such a one lead the people?’ means he is unfit to govern them. ‘He’ refers to the Master, ‘you’ to Duke Ai. This says: does he truly benefit you? Thus it is said, ‘He suits only you.’ ‘Nourishing’ means to sustain. It says: if you take him for worthy and support him, it will bring you no benefit—you will surely be misled by him. ‘Those who err and delude ourselves’ means that error may yet be admitted.\n\n‘Now, to cause the people to abandon substance and learn falsity’—this is no way to instruct them. ‘To guide’ means to teach and show. ‘Considering posterity, it would be better to cease this’—it would be better to abandon it altogether.\"\n\nThe governance is difficult—when bestowed upon others yet not forgotten, it is not the Heavenly Distribution. Merchants are held in contempt; even if one engages with them in matters, the spirits within do not acknowledge them. Those who impose external punishments wield metal and wood; those who inflict internal punishments act through movement and transgression. The petty man who incurs external punishment is interrogated by metal and wood; he who incurs internal punishment is consumed by yin and yang. Only the true person can escape both internal and external punishments. The people may be governed without governance—if one governs with intent, then governance becomes difficult. Thus it is said, \"difficult to govern.\" To bestow upon others yet not forget is to govern with intent. *Shi* means to administer; *bu* means to display. The Heavenly Distribution is the Heavenly Principle. To administer governance and instruction with intent is not the Heavenly Principle. It is like merchants: if one of them were to become a scholar, others would surely refuse to rank with him. Even if, by chance, they were to gather and stand in ranks, the spirits within their hearts would still feel displeasure. Likewise, the man of Dao would refuse to rank with those who act with intent. This analogy of merchants illustrates those who study benevolence and righteousness. External punishments are the knife and cangue; internal punishments are movement and transgression—meaning the actions and faults of the human body are akin to punishments. *Xun* means to interrogate; to be consumed by yin and yang is to suffer the reproach of creation. *Shi* means to eclipse, as in an eclipse of the sun, or to afflict, as in illness. The phrase on external punishments is a physical analogy for the following line. *Li* means to adhere.\n\nConfucius said: \"The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven at least has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its times—dawn and dusk. But humans have thick appearances and deep emotions. Thus, some appear sincere yet seek profit; some harbor great ability yet do not show it; some are unworthy yet seem so. There are those who are gentle and compliant yet discerning; those who seem firm yet are weak and entangled; those who appear relaxed yet are narrow and hasty. Therefore, those who rush toward righteousness as if parched may flee from it as if scorched. Thus, the noble person sends them far to observe their loyalty, brings them near to observe their respect, assigns them tasks to observe their ability, questions them suddenly to observe their wisdom, sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness, entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence, warns them of danger to observe their integrity, intoxicates them with wine to observe their composure, and mixes them in company to observe their demeanor. Through these nine tests, the unworthy are revealed.\n\n*Thick appearances and deep emotions* refer to deceptive appearances and hidden motives, difficult to perceive and fathom. Some appear simple and sincere yet inwardly seek profit; some conceal their strengths behind an unassuming exterior—such is the unworthy who does not seem so. There are those who are gentle and compliant yet discerning; those who seem firm yet are weak and entangled—*man* means entangled, as in the *Book of Songs*: \"Once a hundred links of steel, now soft as a coil around the finger.\" *Han* means urgency; some appear relaxed yet are narrow and hasty. All these illustrate the unknowability of people. *Those who rush toward righteousness as if parched* describes their eager advance; *those who flee from it as if scorched* describes their swift retreat. This single line—eager advance and swift retreat—is extraordinary. Those far away are easily deceived, so observe their loyalty from afar; those near are prone to negligence, so observe their respect up close. Overwhelming tasks test ability, sudden questions reveal wisdom, urgent deadlines test trustworthiness, entrusted wealth reveals benevolence—this *benevolence* aligns with the Dao. Danger tests integrity, wine tests composure—*ze* means propriety. Mixed company tests self-restraint—*se* means demeanor. *Zheng* means verification. Through these nine tests, the worthy and unworthy become clear.\n\nThis passage presents a most proper discourse, yet it is attributed to the words of Confucius—from which we may know that Zhuangzi was not without reverence for him. When Zheng Kaofu received his first appointment, he bent his back; at the second, he bent his waist; at the third, he stooped low, creeping along the wall—who would dare not take him as a model? As for that man: at his first appointment, he strutted like Lü Ju; at the second, he danced atop his carriage; at the third, he called his elders by name—who could compare him to Yao and Xu? *Yu* means a hunched back; *lou*, a bent waist; *fu*, a body bowed to the ground. This speaks of how the higher the rank, the lower the posture. Creeping along the wall, not daring to walk the main path—this is humility. If the world had such a worthy man, who would not take him as a model? *Fa* means a model. *Er fu* refers to that man. *Lü Ju* describes an air of arrogance. Dancing atop the carriage speaks of frivolous flaunting. Calling elders by name shows contempt for his clan, addressing uncles and brothers by their given names. Yao offered the world to Xu You, who refused—yet such petty men, upon gaining the slightest advantage, become as haughty as this. How could they know of Yao and Xu You’s deeds? *Xie* means to compare. If we compare ourselves to Yao and Xu You, the difference in weight becomes clear. *Shu xie* asks: who else could be compared in this way?\n\nNo thief is greater than a virtue that has a heart, and a heart that has an eye. When it has an eye, it turns inward—and in turning inward, it fails. These few lines strike most intimately at the heart of those who study the Way. What Chan Buddhists call the \"leaking mind\" or \"the second thought\" expresses this same idea. *De* is virtue. To practice virtue while being aware that one is practicing virtue is to have a heart—this is the greatest harm to those who study the Way. Thus it is said: no thief is greater than a virtue that has a heart. Within this heart, if there is also the intention to calculate and scheme—it is as if the heart has opened another eye. This is called \"leaking\" or \"the second thought.\" With this eye-opened heart turned inward, a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions arise, chaotic and disorderly, no longer knowing the undifferentiated whole. Then there is no way to accomplish the Way. Thus it is said: *bai*—failure, incompletion.\n\nThere are five baleful virtues, with the \"inner virtue\" as their chief. What is the \"inner virtue\"? It is the virtue of self-satisfaction, which reviles what it does not do. The five baleful virtues are the heart, ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—with the heart as the \"inner virtue.\" This means the harm of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth is not as great as the harm within the heart. Thus it is said: the \"inner virtue\" is chief. *You yi zi hao* means \"to take pride in one’s own abilities.\" *Pi* means to revile or ridicule. To ridicule others for what they cannot do with one’s own abilities—such a heart cannot study the Way. The *Yuanjue Jing* says: \"Do not value long practice nor belittle the beginner.\" Dahui said: \"Above all, do not think, ‘I guard against this, but he does not’\"—this is the same idea.\n\nPoverty has eight extremes, while attainment has three necessities. The body has six repositories. Handsome whiskers, tall stature, robust build, and striking beauty—coupled with courage and boldness—these eight surpass others. Yet relying on these leads to poverty. Following, slouching, and cowardice—fearing to be inferior to others—these three lead to attainment. Wisdom that is outwardly expressed, courage that breeds resentment, and benevolence that imposes demands—these are the conditions of a life that attains. Those who attain through knowledge are but semblances; those who attain the great mandate follow it; those who attain the lesser mandate encounter it.\n\nPoverty has eight extremes: it speaks of those who rely on something and thus inevitably fall into poverty. Attainment has three necessities: it speaks of those who are modest and lacking, yet at times must attain. *Mei* means beauty of appearance. *Ran* refers to the beard. As Fang Xuanling said of Li Wei: \"He had fine whiskers.\" *Chang* means tall stature. *Da* means a large waist.\n\nStrength denotes physical power; *li* denotes splendor and brilliance; courage denotes abundant *qi*; daring denotes firm resolve. These are called the eight extremes—speaking of how these eight qualities all surpass others. Yet those who rely on them inevitably meet with poverty in the end.\n\n*Yuánxún* means compliance and gentleness, acting only when unavoidable; *yǎnyǎng* means rising after every fall; *kùnwèi* means distress and fear from hardship. These three, though inferior to others, must lead to attainment—speaking of how those who do not compete with the world are inevitably favored by others.\n\nThis is all Zhuangzi’s argument for correcting arrogance. *Xíng yǒu liù fǔ* speaks of the six repositories within the human body. *Fǔ* is the place where things are stored. Wisdom is one repository—those who \"outwardly express\" use their wisdom externally to seek attainment. Courage is one repository—those who rely on strength inevitably breed resentment. Benevolence is one repository—those who seek fame through benevolence and righteousness inevitably face many demands. *Kuǐ* (attainment of life) is one repository—those who attain the principle of life must appear *kuǐ* (grand) in their self-regard. Attainment of knowledge is one repository—those who attain the insights of the multitude must scrutinize every matter. Attainment of the mandate is one repository—what lies with Heaven is great, what lies with oneself is small. Those who attain what lies with Heaven follow and yield to nature; those who attain what lies with themselves accept whatever they encounter as fate. The latter still involves gain and loss, a mind that resigns itself to fate; the former has no mind at all. These two are distinct in their divisions.\n\nThe final character *mìng* (mandate) should be parsed into two phrases—this is also a matter of literary structure.\n\nThere was a man who had an audience with the King of Song and was granted ten chariots. With these ten chariots, he grew arrogant and childish. Zhuangzi said: \"By the riverside lived a poor family who made their living weaving rushes. Their son dived into a deep pool and found a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him, 'Bring a stone and smash it!' For a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces must lie in the ninefold depths beneath the chin of a black dragon. That you could obtain it means you must have encountered its slumber. Had the black dragon been awake, what scrap of you would remain? Now, the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss, and the ferocity of the King of Song is not merely that of a black dragon. That you could obtain those chariots means you must have encountered his slumber. Had the King of Song been awake, you would have been ground to powder.\"\n\n*Jiāozhì* means arrogance and childishness—this is Zhuangzi’s intent. *Wěi* means weaving; *xiāo* are reeds—relying on these for sustenance, making them one’s trade. \"Bring a stone and smash it\" means to despise the pearl and destroy it. This analogy speaks of those who seek wealth and honor—all tread perilous paths, all deceive their rulers. If their ruler awakens, they will inevitably face execution; what scrap of them would remain?\n\nSomeone came to invite Zhuangzi, and Zhuangzi replied to the messenger: \"Have you seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered silk and fed with fine grain and beans. Yet when it is led into the great temple, though it might wish to be a solitary calf, can it still do so?\" This carries the same meaning as the earlier passage about the tortoise dragging its tail in the mud.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi was about to die, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: \"I take heaven and earth as my coffin and outer coffin, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars and constellations as my pearls and jades, the myriad things as my funeral gifts—are not my burial furnishings already complete? What could be added to them?\" His disciples said: \"We fear that crows and kites will eat you.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Above, I would be eaten by crows and kites; below, by mole crickets and ants. To snatch from one to give to the other—how partial is that!\" This analogy mocks those in the world who practice lavish burials, robbing crows and kites to give to mole crickets and ants. Though his words may seem excessive, those who truly attain the Dao cannot easily match them.\n\nTo level the level with the unlevel is not level; to verify the verifiable with the unverifiable is not verifiable. The enlightened act as agents, while the spiritual verify. That the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritual has long been so. Yet fools rely on their own perceptions to intrude upon others, seeking merit externally—is this not lamentable?\n\nThe principles of the myriad things are inherently level. If I use an unlevel mind to level what is already level, then what was level becomes unlevel. The principles of the myriad things are each verifiable. If I use an unverifiable mind to verify them, then what was verifiable also becomes unverifiable. Thus it is said: \"To level the level with the unlevel is not level; to verify the verifiable with the unverifiable is not verifiable.\" Verification means that nothing is done, yet things are made to act as if by agency—this is to turn a mindless state into one with intent. The self-entanglement of the enlightened often takes this form. As for the spiritual, it simply allows things to respond naturally.\n\nThat the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritual speaks of how human effort cannot surpass effortlessness. Fools rely on their private views to intrude upon others, constantly seeking merit externally—is this not lamentable?\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters, \"The World\" (Chapter Thirty-Three)**\n\nThe world’s governance and methods of the Dao are many.\n\nAll regard their efforts as unsurpassable. Where, then, does the Dao-arts of antiquity truly lie? Does it reside in \"nothingness\"? No—then how does the numinous descend? How does illumination emerge? The sage is born, the king achieves success, all originating from the One, never departing from the Source—this is called the Heavenly Person. Never departing from essence—this is called the Spirit Person. Never departing from the real—this is called the Perfect Person. Taking Heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate, they presage transformation and change—this is called the sage. Taking benevolence as kindness, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony, they radiate compassion and kindness—this is called the noble person. Taking law as distinction, names as outward signs, conduct as verification, and investigation as decision, their reckoning follows one, two, three, four—thus do the hundred officials rank one another. Taking affairs as constant, clothing and food as primary, and the flourishing, storing, aging, weak, orphaned, and widowed as their concern, all possess the principles of nurturing the people.\n\nWere the people of antiquity not complete? They matched the divine luminaries, harmonized with Heaven and Earth, nourished the myriad things, brought harmony to the world, and bestowed blessings upon the hundred clans. They were clear about fundamental reckoning and bound to its branches, their measures sixfold in penetration and fourfold in openness. Whether small or great, refined or coarse, their operation was without limit—yet not in their illumination, but in their reckoning and measures. The old methods transmitted by the scribes of former ages still abound. As for those found in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, the scholars of Zou and Lu, the girdled masters, are largely able to clarify them. The *Odes* guide the will, the *Documents* guide affairs, the *Rites* guide conduct, the *Music* guides harmony, the *Changes* guide yin and yang, and the *Spring and Autumn* guide names and distinctions. Their reckoning disperses throughout the world and is established in the Central States, forming the hundred schools’ teachings. At times, these are praised and followed, yet the world remains in great disorder. The worthy and sagely are unclear, the Dao and virtue are not unified, and the world seizes upon a single insight to cherish as its own. Like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each has its own clarity but cannot communicate with one another—so too are the hundred schools’ many arts.\n\nAll possess their strengths and find their uses at times, yet none is comprehensive or all-encompassing—each is but a partial scholar. They judge the beauty of Heaven and Earth, analyze the principles of the myriad things, and examine the completeness of the ancients, yet few can fully embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of spirit and illumination. Thus, the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship remains obscured and unmanifest, pent-up and unexpressed. The people of the world each pursue what they desire, fashioning their own methods. Alas! The hundred schools have gone forth and do not return—they will surely never reunite. Later scholars, unfortunate in not witnessing the purity of Heaven and Earth or the great essence of the ancients, will see the Dao and its arts torn asunder by the world.\n\nIn the closing chapters, Zhuangzi’s preface on the learning of past and present is akin to the concluding insights of Mencius—both speak of knowledge and perception. Since those who govern the world through methods and techniques are many, the Dao and its arts are on the verge of being rent by the world. This is clearly the overture: having first summarized the schools, he then proceeds to discuss them by their respective categories. While his book places itself among these schools, the learning of Zou and Lu is expounded within the general preface. Thus, this elder’s intent is evident: though his writings are all impassioned and one-sided, he never fails to recognize the orthodox teachings of the Sage’s gate. Reading his general preface, one sees that his learning is fundamentally quite proper. As Su Dongpo observed, Zhuangzi never disparaged the Master—he, too, discerned the distinction between methods and true learning.\n\nEach person deems their own learning beyond reproach, each considers themselves correct. What, then, is the so-called *Dao-art*? Where does it reside? It does not lie apart—it carries the meaning of being within the mean. Though the hundred schools’ teachings differ, the Dao is never absent from them. How could spirit descend? How could illumination emerge? How could the Way of spirit and illumination be made visible? The creative and transformative work of sagely kings is none other than the principle of Heaven and Earth’s generation—all originate from the One, the work of creation. Terms like *zong* (ancestry), *jing* (essence), and *zhen* (authenticity) are synonymous with the One, merely stylistic variations in writing.\n\nTo take Heaven as one’s ancestry, virtue as one’s root, and the Dao as one’s gate—all are non-action and spontaneity. Originating in transformation, they ultimately return to the One. The sage is the Heavenly person, the perfected person, the spirit person. Their bearing is warmly benevolent—this describes their demeanor. There are distinctions in standards, hence “taking standards as divisions”; there are criteria in names, hence “taking names as markers.” Conduct serves as verification, investigation as decision—each has its basis. The reckoning of one, two, three, four speaks to meticulous clarity and completeness. Those ranked by seniority observe order in size and precedence. Taking affairs as constant means each has its regular duties. Taking clothing and food as primary means teaching the people agriculture and sericulture. Propagation and storage—like the principle of three years’ tilling for one year’s sustenance—are examples of this. Prioritizing the old, weak, orphaned, and widowed means that in enacting governance and bestowing benevolence, these four must come first. All their divisions of offices, arrangements of duties, governance, and instruction are principles for nurturing the people.\n\nThe ancients—were they not complete? This speaks of the ancient sages’ ability to fulfill them. They could match spirit and illumination, harmonize with Heaven and Earth—this is pure harmony. Nurturing the myriad things and harmonizing the world, their beneficence extended to all people. This describes the vastness of their efficacy. *Ben-shu* and *mo-du* mean the refined and the coarse, the root and the branch. *Xi* conveys the idea of interconnection—root and branch are inseparable. *Liu-tong si-bi* speaks of the six directions (east, west, south, north, above, below), usable without exception. *Yun* is the Dao; the Dao’s operation encompasses the great and small, the refined and coarse—all are the Dao.\n\nThus it is said: there is nowhere it is not present. In these several phrases, the substance and function of the Dao have never been unclear. *Shu-du* refers to what can be recorded in measures and standards—speaking of its laws and regulations, evident and traceable, all of which are the old models transmitted through generations in historical texts. There are still many such records, all documenting these matters. The scholars of Zou and Lu, the gentry and masters—here referring to the sagely lineage—make this perfectly clear. In Confucius’ *Six Classics* and the *Spring and Autumn*, the *ming-fen* (proper names and duties) already contain the intent to deter rebellious ministers and traitorous sons. These principles spread throughout the world, meaning that Zou and Lu preserved their entirety, while their teachings dispersed across the land, branching into a hundred schools in China. There were also occasional references to these matters, but none could match the completeness of the learning of Zou and Lu.\n\nThe great chaos of the world refers to the period after the *Spring and Autumn*. The worthy and sagely were no longer manifest; above, there were no kings like Wen and Wu or the Duke of Zhou, and below, no disciples like Confucius and Yan Hui. The Dao and virtue were not unified but scattered into a hundred schools. \"The world gains much\" means that people of the world grasped one aspect and examined it, taking pride in it—observing only one facet and boasting of their own excellence. The ear, eye, nose, and mouth cannot interchange functions: the ear cannot see, the eye cannot hear, the mouth cannot smell, the nose cannot taste; each follows its own capacity. Thus it is said: each has its own clarity. This analogy illustrates that the hundred schools and various arts each have their strengths and may at times be useful, but none can fully encompass the comprehensive Way of the sage, and so they remain partial and one-sided scholars.\n\nThe beauty of Heaven and Earth is thus divided and incomplete; the principles of the myriad things are thus fragmented and discordant. If one examines them through the completeness of the ancients’ learning, one knows that the one-sidedness of the hundred schools rarely embodies the beauty of Heaven and Earth or matches the countenance of spirit and illumination. The Dao within is its substance; the appearance of the Dao without is its function. *Cheng* means to be fitting and proper. Few can fittingly match the countenance of spirit and illumination—this speaks of the failure to be fitting. Inward sageliness is its substance; outward kingship is its function.\n\nThe Dao of inner and outer has thus become obscured, with each person following their own desires to devise their methods and techniques. From this point onward, the learning of the hundred schools will remain lost, unable to return—reunion will be impossible. Later scholars will be unable to perceive the purity and wholeness of Heaven and Earth or the complete embodiment of the ancient Way. This is the misfortune of later ages. The arts of the Dao throughout the world have since become fragmented.\n\nThus it is said: *\"The arts of the Dao will be torn asunder throughout the world.\"* This closing line is rendered with great force and is most excellent prose. It does not indulge in later ages, nor does it dissipate among the myriad things; it does not dazzle through numerical measures. Instead, it corrects itself with the carpenter’s line and prepares for the world’s emergencies—such were the ancient arts of the Dao.\n\nMo Di and Qin Guli heard of this teaching and delighted in it, but in practicing it, they went to excess. Their great cycle of conduct included *Fei Yue* (\"Rejecting Music\"), decreeing *Jie Yong* (\"Frugal Use\"), forbidding singing in life, and eschewing mourning garments in death. Mozi advocated universal love and mutual benefit while opposing strife; his Way was free from anger. He was fond of learning and broadly knowledgeable, yet he did not differ in his rejection of the ancient rites and music. The ancient rites and music included the Yellow Emperor’s *Xian Chi*, Yao’s *Da Zhang*, Shun’s *Da Shao*, Yu’s *Da Xia*, Tang’s *Da Huo*, King Wen’s *Piyong* music, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou’s *Wu*. In ancient funeral rites, the noble and base had their proper forms, the high and low their distinctions: the Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords five, great officers three, and scholars two. Yet Mozi alone forbade singing in life and mourning garments in death, using a paulownia coffin three inches thick without an outer coffin as his model. Teaching others thus, he surely did not love them; practicing it himself, he certainly did not love himself. Though his Way ultimately failed, Mozi sang yet rejected singing, wept yet rejected weeping, rejoiced yet rejected joy—was this truly consistent?\n\nIn life, he toiled; in death...\n\nHis Way was meager, his demands extreme—it made men anxious, made men sorrowful, and his conduct was hard to follow. One fears it cannot serve as the Way of the sage, but rather turns the hearts of the world against it. The world cannot bear it. Though Mozi alone could endure it, what could he do about the world? Separated from the world, he was far indeed from kingship.\n\nMozi spoke of the Dao, saying: \"In former times, Yu dammed the floodwaters, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and opened the way to the four barbarians and the nine provinces. The great rivers numbered three hundred, the tributaries three thousand, and the smaller streams were beyond counting. Yu personally wielded the spade and plowshare, crossing all the rivers of the world. His calves were without flesh, his shins without hair; his hair was drenched by heavy rains, his head combed by fierce winds. He established ten thousand states—Yu was a great sage, yet his body toiled for the world. If later generations of Mohists take wearing coarse cloth as their garb and straw sandals as their footwear, laboring day and night without rest, and making self-suffering their utmost limit, saying, ‘If one cannot do this, it is not the Way of Yu,’ then they are not worthy to be called Mohists.\"\n\nXiangli Qin’s disciples, the followers of Wu Hou, the southern Mohists Ku Huo, Yi Chi, Deng Lingzi, and their like—all recited the *Mo Jing* but diverged in their interpretations, calling one another \"heterodox Mohists.\" They disparaged one another with debates on \"hard and white\" and \"same and different,\" responded to one another with arguments of \"odd and even\" and \"non-opposition,\" and revered the *Juzi* as a sage, all wishing to be his successor. Even now, they have not settled the matter. Mo Di and Qin Guli’s intentions were thus, but their conduct was otherwise. They would have later Mohists necessarily emulate Yu, with calves without flesh and shins without hair, advancing one another in this alone. This is the height of disorder and the lowest form of governance.\n\nYet Mozi was truly one who loved the world. One might seek such a man in vain, for even if he were emaciated and withered, he would not abandon his cause. He was a man of talent.\n\nThey did not indulge later generations, nor did they teach them indulgence—extravagance and ostentation. They did not regard the adornments of the myriad things as beauty, nor did they take ritual, music, measures, and standards as splendor. They bound themselves with the carpenter’s line, constraining their own bodies to correct the world, wishing all under Heaven to have abundance. Their intent centered on frugality to suffice all needs, thus they spoke of \"preparing for the world’s emergencies.\" They said that people of the world regard clothing and food as urgent matters, and thus fall into strife and chaos.\n\nAmong the arts of the Dao of antiquity, there were those who held to this principle. It was said that among the learning of the ancients, this principle also existed, and that Mo Di and Qin Guli alone heard its essentials and rejoiced in them. Thus it was said, \"They heard its influence and delighted in it.\" Only because they rejoiced in it did they carry it to excess—speaking too forcefully. To follow and comply: they greatly adhered to its essentials, yet suppressed and restrained it too severely. Thus it was said, \"Their great adherence to it was itself restraint.\" The meaning of *restraint* here is suppression.\n\n*Against Music* and *Moderating Expenditure* are chapter titles in the writings of Mozi. It was said that Mozi, having composed the books *Against Music* and *Moderating Expenditure*, wished that in life, the people of the world would not sing or employ music. Thus he opposed music in life, and... in death.\n\nWithout mourning garments for burial rites borders on naked interment—this he deemed *moderating expenditure*. His *universal love* sought to benefit all people without exception, thus condemning strife and elevating non-anger as the Way. *Extensive yet undifferentiated* upheld uniformity, expanding this principle to advocate for *unity above all*. Though broad in scope and undiscriminating, his teachings diverged from those of the former kings. From the Yellow Emperor to King Wu, none had ever abandoned music, yet Mozi sought to abolish it. From ancient times, from the noble to the base, none had ever dispensed with mourning rites, yet Mozi sought to abolish them as well—prescribing a three-inch coffin as the standard and rejecting outer coffins as *moderating expenditure*. Such teachings imposed excessive austerity upon people.\n\nThus it was said, \"This is not the way to love others.\" Those who do not love themselves speak of self-inflicted suffering. *Ultimate collapse* refers to the inevitable impracticability of Mozi’s Way. Human life cannot be without song, yet Mozi condemned singing; human nature cannot be without weeping, yet Mozi condemned weeping; human sentiment cannot be without joy, yet Mozi condemned joy. His Way entirely disregarded human feeling—thus it was said, \"Could this truly be *near* to human nature?\" *Near* here means akin. The question is: could such a doctrine truly align with human feeling?\n\nThough their lives were marked by toil and hardship, their deaths by meager burials—*excessive frugality* here meaning extreme simplicity—their conduct was such that others found it difficult to emulate. *Difficult to emulate* refers to the impracticability of their actions for others. They contravened the hearts of all under heaven and stood apart from human feeling. Though the world could not endure such austerity, Mozi alone could bear it—*endurance* here meaning forbearance. Yet even if one man alone could endure, how could the world at large do so? Having severed themselves from the human heart, such a doctrine could not serve as the Way to rule all under heaven.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, the great rivers are the *ming-chuan*; their tributaries were dredged and channeled by Yu. The *tuo* is an earthen vessel, and the *si* a tool for digging. The nine tones harmonized their labors to jointly govern the rivers of the world. Mozi’s followers claimed that even the great sage Yu toiled so strenuously—how much more so for others? *Jū* and *jī* are sandals: wooden ones are *jū*, straw ones *jī*, both for daily use.\n\nXiangli Qin was a surname; *Qin* was his given name. He too studied Moism and became a teacher in the world. His disciples were followers from the courts of five feudal lords—such was the multitude of his students. Ku Huo, Yi Chi, and Denglingzi were three other names. These three, all residing in the south, also studied the Moist texts, yet their eccentricities and strangeness surpassed even Mozi’s. Moreover, their doctrines diverged, so they styled themselves separately from Moism—*distinct schools* here meaning sectarian divisions. *Neither conflicting nor identical*: though odd and even are fundamentally distinct, they claimed no contradiction—this was mere sophistry. Their debates employed such paradoxes, hence they were said to *correspond*. The *juzi* were akin to the foremost disciples—akin to the Zen notion of *dharma heirs*. Among the many who transmitted their teachings, the most accomplished were deemed sages and made the focal point—*shi* meaning the principal. They hoped to be succeeded by later generations, the *juzi* passing the mantle to their disciples, who would then become their *descendants*—*descendants* here meaning posterity. *Indecisive and unresolved*: their transmission persists to this day.\n\nTracing its origins, Mo Di’s intent was indeed noble, but his conduct was excessive. Thus it was said: the intent was sound, but the practice was flawed. *Mutual advancement* means mutual esteem. Those who transmitted Mozi’s Way vied in self-imposed hardship, seeking thereby to govern the world. Yet no governance was ever achieved; instead, they first invited chaos. Thus it was said: *chaos supreme*. Nevertheless, Mozi’s devotion arose from the sincerity of his heart—such a man is no longer found in this age. *Sought in vain* means no such person remains. *Unrelenting and unceasing*: though he exhausted himself to the point of emaciation, he did not stop—truly a man of heroic mettle. *Talented scholar* is a term for such heroic figures.\n\nMencius refuted Yang Zhu and Mo Di; this text likewise often pairs them. Yet in this discussion of the various schools divided by their doctrines, Yangism is not mentioned, for its teachings were deemed unworthy of comparison. *Unburdened by custom, unadorned by things, uncompromising toward others, unenvious of the multitude*—they wished for the peace and security of all under heaven, to preserve human life, and to cease when the sustenance of self and others was fulfilled. Thus they *clarified the heart*—this was the ancient Daoist art.\n\nSong Jian and Yin Wen heard of this teaching and delighted in it. They fashioned the *Mount Hua cap* as a symbol, engaging with all things by beginning with *distinguishing restraint*. They spoke of the *capacity of the heart*, calling it the *conduct of the heart*. They sought to *join in harmony* and *pacify the world*, proposing to establish them as leaders. They saw insult as no disgrace, sought to rescue the people from strife, forbid aggression, and end warfare—thus saving the world from conflict. With this, they traversed the world, teaching rulers above and the people below. Though the world did not accept them, they persisted stubbornly and unceasingly. Thus it was said: *seen with disdain above and below, yet they forced themselves upon others*.\n\n*Unburdened by custom* means free from worldly entanglements. *Unadorned by things* means not indulging in external goods. *Unenvious of the multitude* means not opposing human feeling. They wished for every person to live, regarding others as themselves, desiring only that all be sufficiently provided for. With this as their heart, they proclaimed it to the world—this was the teaching of Song Jian and Yin Wen.\n\nThe *Mount Hua cap* was its name. *Distinguishing restraint* is akin to *being in restraint*—adapting to one’s lot is *distinguishing*, and being at ease is *restraint*. This was their starting point for engaging with all things. *Capacity of the heart* refers to the heart’s nature. They expounded its principles to others, calling it the *conduct of the heart*—*conduct* being the heart’s function, akin to what the Buddhists call *great function manifesting before one*. They sought to *join in harmony* and foster goodwill, thereby *pacifying the four seas*, and proposed to establish Song Jian and Yin Wen as the leaders of their teaching.\n\nSeeing the people’s fondness for strife, they taught *enduring insult without disgrace* to rescue them. Seeing the age’s fondness for warfare, they taught *forbidding aggression and ending warfare* to save it. Above, they instructed rulers; below, they taught the people. Though the world did not heed them, they persisted stubbornly and unceasingly—boasting without end. *Seen with disdain above and below, yet they forced themselves upon others*: this must have been a contemporary saying, hence its use to conclude the passage.\n\nNevertheless, their concern for others was too great, and their care for themselves too little. They said: \"Let us simply set aside five *sheng* of rice—enough.\" The master feared he would not be full, yet the disciples, though hungry, did not forget the world, toiling day and night without rest, saying: \"I must surely save it!\" How haughty were these *saviors of the world*!\n\nTheir concern for others was excessive, their self-imposed suffering extreme. Their teaching held that each day, only five *sheng* of rice were needed, shared between master and disciples. The master, with these five *sheng*, still went hungry—how could the disciples not? They endured hunger to establish their teaching, declaring: \"We do not forget the world, toiling day and night without cease. We say: our self-imposed suffering is thus—how could this be a path to long life? Yet we do this to correct those who feign concern for saving the world while seeking their own gain.\" Thus it was said: *how haughty were these saviors of the world*! *Haughty* means *to correct*—akin to Yu Rang’s words: \"I do this with utmost difficulty to shame those ministers of the world who harbor disloyalty.\" This is the same sentiment. Li Bai’s poem *Drinking Alone, Sent to Wei Liu* says: \"I think of you wandering the world, so proud and self-mocking\"—this is the same *haughty*.\n\nThey said: \"The noble man does not engage in petty scrutiny, nor lend himself to things. What brings no benefit to the world is not worth clarifying—better to remain silent. Externally, they forbade aggression and ended warfare; internally, they advocated *few desires and shallow passions*. In their conduct, whether grand or fine, coarse or refined, they went no further than this.\"\n\nTheir teachings further stated: \"Not to engage in petty scrutiny\"—for petty scrutiny precludes *distinguishing the bounded*. This means one ought not insist on the distinction between self and other. \"Not to lend oneself to things\" means to act entirely on one’s own, never relying on others for assistance. If something brings harm to the world without benefit, even if one clearly recognizes its feasibility, it is better to refrain—hence it was said: *to clarify it is not as good as to leave it be*. The essence of their learning aimed for people to have no conflicts of attack and warfare externally, and no turbulence of passions internally. *Few and shallow* means to diminish and pare down desires. Though their learning varied in scope—grand or fine, coarse or refined—their conduct in practice amounted to no more than this. *Merely* means *only thus*.\n\nImpartial yet not partisan, easygoing yet without self-interest, resolute without fixed inclinations, they let things take their course without dualistic attachment. In deliberation, they did not scheme with cunning; in encountering things, they made no choices but moved with them. Such were the ancient arts of the Dao that resided in this. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of this teaching and delighted in it. They took *equalizing the myriad things* as their foremost principle, saying: \"Heaven can cover but cannot bear; Earth can bear but cannot cover. The great Dao can encompass but cannot discriminate. Knowing that all things have their *can* and *cannot*, thus it was said: *Selection is not universal; teaching does not reach all; only the Dao leaves nothing out.*\"\n\nTherefore, Shen Dao abandoned knowledge, relinquished the self, and followed necessity. He refined and sifted things to establish his principle, saying: \"To know that one does not know is to approach thinly the realm of knowing—only then does one avoid harm.\" *Xi* and *ke*, unburdened, mocked the world’s esteem for worthies. Unrestrained and unprincipled, they rejected the world’s great sages. *Chui*, *pai*, *wan*, and *duan*, they turned with things, relinquishing right and wrong. If it could help one escape, they did not scorn even the basest means. They did not model themselves on wisdom and planning, nor distinguish before and after. *Wei* and *ran*, they simply acted thus.\n\nPushed, then they moved; dragged, then they followed—like the whirling of a drifting wind, the circling of a feather, the grinding of a millstone’s track. Whole yet without fault, in motion or stillness never transgressing, they never incurred blame. Why was this? Because things without knowledge have no peril of self-assertion, no encumbrance of cleverness. In movement and stillness, they never strayed from principle—thus they ended their lives without praise. Hence it was said: *To be like things without knowledge is sufficient. There is no need for worthies and sages.* A clod of earth never loses the Dao, yet heroes of the age laughed together, saying: \"Shen Dao’s Way is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead—how bizarre!\"\n\nTian Pian was likewise. He studied under Peng Meng and attained *non-teaching*. Peng Meng’s master said: \"The Daoist of old reached the point of neither affirming nor negating anything.\" His manner was *huo*-like, indescribably strange. He often contradicted others, yet could not avoid being *yuan*-like in his judgments. What he called the Dao was not the Dao, and what he spoke as right inevitably fell into wrong. Though Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not know the Dao, in general they had once glimpsed it. Impartial and without self-interest, they were thus.\n\nThe Way is level and smooth. To decisively cast aside private intentions and not incline toward any particular thing—this is to speak of the principle and tendency of the myriad things. Where there are not two, there is unity. Without regard for deliberation, without reliance on wisdom, without calculation or measurement—toward things, there is no selection, no discrimination, for the eye’s scope is even. Moving with them, one follows the natural and acts. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao were all scholars of Qi. Their teaching held that heaven and earth are also among the myriad things: if called things, they are all equal and the same, yet that which stands at their head is the Way of non-action.\n\nHeaven can cover but cannot bear; earth can bear but cannot cover—this speaks of their partiality. The great Dao belongs to the scholars of the Daoist school. They know only to embrace all as one, without making distinctions. In that era, there was a kind of disputatious learning where every statement had its approvals and disapprovals, each speaking from its own partiality. If one were to select among the myriad things, one could never be all-encompassing; if this were made a teaching, it could never reach its ultimate. But if one returns to the Dao, there is nothing left unaddressed. Thus it is said: the Dao leaves nothing out, while selection always has its approvals and disapprovals.\n\nAbandoning knowledge, relinquishing the self, and following only what cannot be avoided—this is non-action. To be *lingtai* is to be untrammeled and free. *Lingran* and *shuai*, one is detached from things, without constraint. Those who take this as the principle of the Way regard the unhindered interaction of things as the highest principle. Their teaching says: if one divides by knowledge and ignorance, one will be pressed by knowledge and come near to self-injury. *Bopi* means pressing close. *Xike* is crooked and unsteady, the appearance of indecision. *Wu ren* means not applying the mind to affairs, not taking responsibility. To esteem worthies is to entrust them with affairs. Since they themselves do not engage in affairs, they laugh at the world’s esteem for worthies and the learning of sages that necessarily exalts conduct. Since they are unrestrained and without conduct, they deem the world’s scholars of sageliness to be in error.\n\n*Zhuipai*, *wanduan*—all convey the sense of having no sharp edges, turning with things without corners, neither affirming nor negating anything, taking as their aim merely to avoid entanglement with worldly burdens, not taking knowledge and deliberation as their guide, without thought or calculation. *Bu zhi qianhou*—without consideration of before or after, without planning. *Weiran*—the sense of being firmly fixed and unmoving.\n\nThose who advance only when pushed, proceed only when pulled—this conveys the sense of responding only under compulsion, rising only when there is no alternative. The turning of wind and the circling of feathers, the groove worn by a grinding stone—all serve as metaphors for being without intent and turning with things. *Sui*—to turn. *Hui*—to revolve. By not appearing blameworthy in the eyes of the world, one preserves oneself; movement and stillness follow their natural course without excess, and thus one incurs no fault with others.\n\nWhy does their learning take this form? It is said: only when things are without knowledge do they avoid the affliction of self-assertion and the burden of holding preferences; in movement and stillness, all follows the natural order, never departing from principle. Not seeking knowledge from others, one may pass a lifetime without praise—yet precisely because one is without praise, one is without blame. Thus it is said: \"They have never incurred fault.\" Things without knowledge—such as wood, stone, tiles, and pebbles—are of this kind. *Jian ji shi ji*—to establish oneself by being thus.\n\nHence their saying: \"What need has one in the world for the name of sage or worthy? If one can be like a clod of earth, a thing without knowledge, then one does not lose the Dao.\" Thus it is said: \"The clod does not lose the Dao.\" Such sayings resemble those of the ascetics who dwell in deep mountains and remote valleys, and so the heroic laugh at them, deeming them little better than the dead. *Shi de guai yan*—this speaks of how Peng Meng and his followers were met with astonishment by the world.\n\nThose who attain without instruction speak of how, in their initial learning, they naturally resonated in harmony without awaiting teaching to become capable. Peng Meng, too, had a teacher, whose words were: \"The ancients who possessed the Dao fundamentally took the absence of right and wrong as their guiding principle—*huòrán* like the sound of the wind.\" This means their speech issued forth like a gusting wind, *huòrán*, without harboring any intent; though they spoke, what place was there for deliberate speech? Thus it is said: \"How could one speak of it?\" Their views constantly opposed those of the world, unable to gather and align with the ranks of ordinary observation. Thus they became one-sided doctrines, merely seeking to be without sharp edges—like a turtle’s severed limb, without any angles. Though their words may have been grand, what they called the Dao was not the Dao. Thus they could not escape the world’s ridicule.\n\nPeng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not understand this. Zhuangzi’s judgment is contained in this single phrase: *Gài hū*—in broad overview, they had indeed heard something of this Dao, yet they did not grasp its true essence.\n\nSuch concluding passages reveal his literary artistry: taking the root as refined, things as coarse; regarding accumulation as insufficiency; dwelling in serene solitude with the numinous. The arts of the Dao in antiquity had their place in this. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of its influence and delighted in it. They established it upon the constancy of \"nonbeing and being,\" took the Great Unity as its core, made gentleness, weakness, and humility its outward form, and took emptiness and the non-destruction of the myriad things as its substance.\n\nGuan Yin said: \"Within oneself, do not settle; let forms and things manifest of themselves. In movement, be like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. *Wù hū*—as if vanished; *jì hū*—as if silent; *qīng hū*—as if pure. All is the same.\"\n\nThose who attain harmony gain it; those who lose it never take the lead but always follow others. Lao Dan said: \"Know the masculine, guard the feminine, and be a ravine to the world. Know the bright, guard the humble, and be a valley to the world.\" All men seek to be first; he alone takes the rear, saying, \"Receive the world’s filth.\" All men seek the substantial; he alone takes the empty, for he has no hoarding. Thus, though he has abundance, he stands firm in his abundance. In conducting himself, he is unhurried and incurs no cost—this is non-action. While others laugh at the clever, he alone bends to preserve wholeness, saying, \"Simply avoid blame.\" He takes depth as his root and restraint as his discipline, for hardness breaks and sharpness blunts. Always tolerant toward things, never carving away at others—this may be called the ultimate. Ah, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! They were the vast and true persons of antiquity, rooted in the Dao. Things are but affairs of things; to regard accumulation as insufficiency is to speak of treasuring wealth for the world. Dwelling with the numinous is to guard the natural.\n\nGuan Yin was a disciple of Lao Dan—this remark about \"first serving as a younger brother, then as a teacher\" is but a witty turn of phrase in the moment. Taking \"nonbeing\" as its宗, the Great Ultimate’s beginning as its主—this is also a 主. Gentleness, weakness, and humility as its outward form mean that in engaging the world and responding to things, what appears externally is thus. In emptiness, all things are preserved whole; thus it is said, \"Taking emptiness and the non-destruction of the myriad things as its substance\"—this is the true substance. As Le Xuan said: \"Where nothing exists, the myriad things are complete.\"\n\n\"Within oneself, do not settle\"—this is to have no private agenda. \"Let forms and things manifest of themselves\"—this is to follow the forms of things as they naturally appear. Movement like water, stillness like a mirror, response like an echo—all are without intent. *Wù hū*—as if vanished: in the midst of vagueness, as if something exists yet also as if nothing exists. *Jì hū*—as if silent: its purity is unseen, unnameable. To be in harmony with things is to be in accord; to have no attainment is to attain—having attainment is to lose. Never taking the lead, always following others: this is to move only when pressed, to rise only when unavoidable. \"Know the masculine, guard the feminine\"—this is to be capable yet yield to incapability. \"Know the bright, guard the humble\"—this is to be lofty without appearing so. Ravines and valleys lie low yet contain all things; to be a ravine or valley is to embody the greatness of capacity. All men seek to be first; he alone takes the rear—this is never taking the lead but always following. \"Receiving the world’s filth\" is to know the bright yet guard the humble. Not taking the substantial as substantial, but the empty as substantial—thus it is said, \"All men seek the substantial; he alone takes the empty, for he has no hoarding.\" Thus, he has abundance—this is to regard accumulation as insufficiency. Only by taking the empty as substantial can he stand firm in abundance without hoarding, embodying the idea that \"where nothing exists, the myriad things are complete.\" Unhurried, at ease, incurring no cost—this is to suffer no loss. All men take cleverness as cleverness; he alone takes non-action as cleverness, hence their laughter. All men take fortune as fortune; he alone takes the absence of misfortune as fortune. \"Bending to preserve wholeness\" is to yield and thereby preserve oneself. \"Simply avoid blame\"—no fortune is greater than the absence of misfortune. \"Taking depth as the root\" means his foundation lies in the Great Ultimate’s beginning. \"Taking restraint as the discipline\" means using utmost simplicity as the method of self-preservation. Discipline is method. All things hard or sharp will break or be blunted—this is the meaning of \"teeth, being hard, break.\" To have the capacity to contain all things is to leave no opening for others to carve away. \"Never carving away at others\" means to preserve one’s life alone. This may be called the ultimate—this is the ultimate Dao of the world. To call them \"vast and true persons\" is an expression of reverence.\n\nVast and formless, ever-changing without constancy, death and life, heaven and earth, the numinous and the obscure—where do they go? Where do they proceed? The myriad things are all encompassed, yet none can be taken as a refuge. The arts of the Dao in antiquity had their place in this. Zhuang Zhou heard of its influence and delighted in it. With words of boundless strangeness and reckless abandon, without beginning or end, he gave free rein to his thoughts without restraint, not seeking to be seen as peculiar. Taking the world as turbid and unfit for solemn speech, he used careless words to ramble, weighty words as truth, and parables to broaden his reach. Alone, he roamed with the spirit of heaven and earth, yet did not look down upon the myriad things. He did not dispute right and wrong, but dwelt with the common world. Though his book is vast and unbridled, it is harmless; though its words are uneven and strange, they are worth observing. Its fullness cannot be exhausted. Above, he roamed with the Creator; below, he befriended those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. In its fundamentals, it is refined, great, profound, and expansive; in its宗, it may be called harmonious and supremely successful. Yet though it responds to transformation and dissolves things, its principles are inexhaustible, its coming unchanging. Vague and obscure—who can fully fathom it?\n\nSilent and desolate, formless and void—nothing exists.\nTransformation is ceaseless, taking non-unity as unity.\nDeath and life, yet knowing neither death nor life—\nfrom this single line, one knows the learning of Śākya has long been present.\n\nHeaven and earth join as one, becoming one body with them.\nSpirit and brightness move in tandem, in unison with creation’s course.\nWhere to go? Where to turn? Moving yet leaving no trace.\nThe myriad things are all encompassed, each exhausting the principle of the ten thousand things.\nNone can find a place to return; no one knows where it ultimately lodges.\nVast and distant, empty and remote—\nboundless and limitless, without end.\nNo beginning, no edge, no head, no tail.\nAt times unrestrained yet never reckless—its expansiveness is unbounded, without partiality.\n\"Reckless\" and \"partial\" here mean the same.\nNot clinging to oddity—its vision is not fixed on one end.\n\"Odd\" refers to the peculiar.\n\nBecause the people of the world are foolish and sunk in turbidity, they cannot be enlightened by sincere and truthful words.\n\"Solemn speech\" means speaking with gravity and uttering truthful matters.\n\"Unbounded\" means without limit.\n\"As truth\" means words that rely on the weight of antiquity to make people accept them as real.\n\"To broaden\" means to lodge meaning in words, making them vast and unrestrained.\n\"Roaming with the spirit of heaven and earth\" means befriending the natural workings of creation.\n\"Not looking down upon the myriad things\" means not using this to condescend to the world.\nZhuangzi’s intent was precisely to look down upon this world, yet he feigned the opposite—\n\"Not disputing right and wrong\" means not clinging to right and wrong.\nOnly after having no right and no wrong can one dwell with the common world.\n\n\"Vast and unbridled\" means lofty and grand.\n\"Harmonious and blended\" conveys the sense of fusion without harm or reproach to others.\n\"Uneven\" means sometimes this, sometimes that—now suppressed, now exalted—indeterminate.\n\"Strange and witty\" means humorous and cunning.\nThese two lines self-deconstruct the intent behind his writing, for though his words are bizarre, they are worthy of contemplation.\nOnce this deconstruction is grasped, one can read Zhuangzi.\n\n\"That its fullness cannot be exhausted\" means that within his book, principles are densely packed—\nit is also a work the world cannot do without.\n\"Fundamentals\" here means \"essence.\"\nHis book’s essence and宗 are nothing but the Dao of harmony, greatness, profundity, and expansiveness.\n\"Expansive\" means open and broad.\n\"Unrestrained\" means free and unbounded.\n\nThose of superior attainment can thereby ascend to comprehend Heavenly principle. Though his words all arise from non-action and spontaneity, when applied to the world, they respond to education and transformation, elucidating the principles of things—meaning they can transform customs and clarify principles. \"Its principles are inexhaustible\" means their application is without end. \"Unchanging\" means his words derive from the Dao and do not deviate from it.\n\n\"Vast and obscure\"—these words describe the profound depth of his book. \"Not yet fully expressed\" means what he has grasped in his heart cannot be fully conveyed through language.\n\nFrom the beginning to this point, five aspects have been distinguished, and he positions himself as not having succeeded Laozi, explicitly stating that his learning derives from Laozi. The previous three sections each begin with \"though,\" all adjudicating the right and wrong of his learning—only Laozi is exempt. Here, he again uses \"though,\" indicating that his learning is not without worldly use. This is where the text shifts, and the brushwork is at its finest; it must be examined carefully.\n\nHui Shi was multifaceted; his writings filled five carts, yet his Dao was contradictory and his words off the mark. His \"Investigating Things\" states: \"The utmost great has no exterior—call it the Great One. The utmost small has no interior—call it the Small One. Without thickness, it cannot accumulate.\" Yet it can extend to a thousand *li*. Heaven and earth, though high and low, are equal; mountains and marshes, though elevated and sunken, are level. The sun is square when centered, square when askew. Things are born and die simultaneously. Great sameness and minor sameness differ—this is called minor sameness and difference. All things are entirely the same and entirely different—this is called great sameness and difference.\n\nFollowers like Mo Di, Song Xing, Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao were still partial in their grasp of the Dao, but Hui Shi merely delighted in debate and did not partake in the true arts of the Dao. Thus, he is mentioned at the end of the chapter, merely as one who \"heard the wind.\" His writings filled five carts, yet they were insufficient. Though voluminous, his learning was not correct, and his words were also misplaced, hence the criticism of their contradictions and inaccuracy.\n\n\"Investigating Things\" means examining the principles of things one by one. \"The utmost great has no exterior\" refers to the great void. \"The utmost small has no interior\" refers to the tip of an autumn hair. These eight characters align with what Zhuangzi describes, but calling them the Great One and Small One invites the start of debate. If it is called \"One,\" there is no great or small. Distinguishing great and small within the One is merely difference within sameness and sameness within difference.\n\n\"Without thickness\" means extremely thin. \"Cannot accumulate\" means that if accumulated, it becomes thick. If accumulation continues without end, it can extend to a thousand *li*—thus, great and small are the same. A thousand *li* of greatness is merely the accumulation of what is without thickness. Though heaven is high and earth low, when heavenly *qi* descends, it too becomes low. Thus, heaven and earth are low. Though mountains are higher than marshes, the *qi* of marshes can reach mountains, so mountains and marshes are level.\n\n\"Askew\" means to look sideways. When the sun is centered, looking at it sideways makes it no longer centered—yet calling the centered \"askew\" is also possible. Thus, it is square when centered, square when askew. Things are born, yet their seeds must have died the day before—thus, they are born and die simultaneously. There is great and small—this is minor sameness and difference. Uniting all things in sameness and difference is great sameness and difference. Though called great, it does not transcend the accumulation of small things; though called small, when combined, it can become great—thus, there is neither sameness nor difference.\n\n\"In the south, there is no limit, yet there is a limit. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be untied. I know the center of the world lies north of Yan and south of Yue. To embrace all things, heaven and earth are one body.\" Hui Shi regarded these as grand insights into the world and sought to enlighten debaters. The debaters of the world delighted in them together.\n\nThe southern sea has no limit, yet if one speaks of it as a direction, it must have a limit—this applies to all four directions. Speaking only of the south is not to single it out but to imply the other three, for heaven tilts to the northwest, and the sea lies only in the south, farther than the other three directions, hence the emphasis. \"Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday\" means that though one’s feet have not yet reached Yue, knowing of Yue’s existence and that one will arrive later makes it possible to say that today’s departure is yesterday’s arrival.\n\nLinked rings, though inseparable, must each form its own circle and cannot adhere to one another. If they do not adhere, they are not truly linked rings. Yan lies in the north, Yue in the south—neither is the center of the world. Yet the people of Yan know only Yan, and the people of Yue know only Yue. In the world’s beginning, they knew nothing of one another, so each took their own land as the world’s center. If all things and heaven and earth are one, then though heaven and earth are vast, they are but one thing among the myriad—how can there be great or small? They are one body.\n\n\"Grand insight\" means regarding this as uniquely lofty in the world. Thus, he used these ideas to instruct debaters. As the world’s scholars delighted in them, his influence spread, giving rise to further arguments: eggs have feathers, chickens have three feet, Ying possesses the world, dogs can be sheep, horses lay eggs, *ding*-insects have tails, fire is not hot, mountains have mouths, wheels do not touch the ground, eyes do not see, fingers do not reach, arrival is not cessation, tortoises are longer than snakes, squares are not square, compasses cannot draw circles, chisels do not fit tenons, the shadow of a flying bird never moves, the speed of an arrow has moments of neither motion nor stillness, dogs are not hounds, a yellow horse and black ox make three, a white dog is black, orphaned colts never had mothers, a one-foot rod halved daily will never be exhausted in ten thousand generations.\n\nDebaters used these to engage with Hui Shi, endlessly. Huan Tuan, Gongsun Long, and their ilk—these debaters adorned people’s minds and altered their intentions. They could win in speech but not convince the heart—this was the limitation of debaters. Hui Shi daily used his knowledge to debate others, particularly delighting in the world’s debaters with his strangeness—this was his root.\n\nYet Hui Shi’s oral debates led him to consider himself the most worthy, saying, \"Is not heaven and earth grand?\" He possessed ambition but no method.\n\n\"Eggs have feathers\" means that though feathers in eggs are not yet visible, sparrows and chickens each have distinct feathers. For example, if a chicken were a duck, hatching from an egg would produce duck feathers, not chicken feathers—thus, eggs have feathers.\n\n\"Chickens have three feet\"—chickens inherently have two feet, but there must be something that moves them, making three.\n\n\"Ying possesses the world\"—Ying was the capital of Chu, and its king ruled as if he possessed the world.\n\n(Continued in next section)\n\n\"A dog can be called a sheep\"—the names \"dog\" and \"sheep\" arise from humans, not from the things themselves. Had these names been assigned differently at the beginning of creation, calling a dog a sheep would now make it a sheep, just as calling a sheep a dog would now make it a dog.\n\n\"Horses lay eggs\"—though viviparity differs from oviparity, the terms \"womb-born\" and \"egg-born\" are human designations. If one were to call womb-born creatures egg-born, the same logic applies as with dogs and sheep.\n\n\"Dingzi\" refers to the toad. In Chu, it is called *dingzi*. Though the *dingzi* has no tail, in its earliest form it was a tadpole, and tadpoles do have tails. Thus, one could also say the *dingzi* has a tail.\n\n\"Water is cold, fire is hot\"—these too are human names. Yet there are fire-dwelling rats and fire-washed cloth. If rats can enter and exit fire, and fire can wash cloth, then fire is not inherently hot.\n\nAn echo in an empty valley responds to a human call—is this not the mountain having a mouth? A wheel moves upon the earth, yet once its rim touches the ground, it cannot turn. Thus, one could also say the wheel does not roll upon the earth.\n\nOne points only after seeing, and what the eye reaches, the finger can indicate. Yet where the eye cannot reach, the finger cannot see—thus, what reaches is neither the eye nor the finger alone, and they cannot be entirely separated.\n\n\"A tortoise is longer than a snake\"—if a tortoise were as long as a snake, it would no longer be called a tortoise. Since it is called a tortoise, its length must be as it is. Thus, one could also say it is longer than a snake.\n\n\"A square is a *ju*, a circle is a *gui*\"—once called a *ju*, it cannot also be called square; once called a *gui*, it cannot also be called round. Though the tenon fits within the mortise, its rotation is not constrained by the mortise—thus, one could also say it is not enclosed, for the enclosure does not hold it fast.\n\nWhen a bird flies, its shadow follows and departs with it. One may say the bird flies, but not that the shadow moves. Though an arrow’s flight is swift, while it is in the bow, it is at rest; when it reaches the target, it is in motion. Between leaving the bow and striking the target, there is a moment when it is neither moving nor still.\n\n\"Dog\" and \"canine\" refer to the same thing. If called a dog, it cannot be called a canine; if called a canine, it cannot be called a dog. Thus, it is said, \"A dog is not a canine.\"\n\n\"A horse and an ox have two bodies; a yellow-black horse has color\"—if one speaks of two bodies and color together, then it is three. A yellow-black horse has two colors. Horses and oxen are both bodies, and two colors appearing on a body make three.\n\n\"White dog, black\"—if the names \"white\" and \"black\" did not arise at the beginning of creation, then one could also call white black.\n\n\"A lone colt has never had a mother\"—calling it \"lone\" implies it has no mother. One cannot say it is lone while also saying it once had a mother.\n\nA one-foot staff broken in two: today one uses this half, tomorrow that half. Though it may be used endlessly through myriad generations, it will never be exhausted.\n\nAll the above are but studies under Master Hui, expanding his doctrines to engage with him, persisting in contentious debate throughout their lives—such were the likes of Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long. To adorn another’s mind is to obscure it; to alter another’s intent is to disorder it. Though one may momentarily prevail in debate, the other’s heart remains unconvinced—such debaters are deluded by their own cleverness without self-awareness. Thus it is said: \"Hui Shi was confined by his own learning, daily relying on his wit to contend with others in debate.\" *Te* means \"only\"; alone with his followers, he was but an object of wonder—his true capacity no more than this. Thus it is said: \"This was his root.\" *Di* means \"root.\" Relying solely on his eloquence, he deemed his might equal to heaven and earth. Though he fancied himself lofty, in truth he lacked all learning.\n\nIn the south there was a man named Huang Liao who asked why heaven does not fall, why earth does not sink, and what causes wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi neither declined nor hesitated, answering without deliberation, discoursing exhaustively on the principles of the myriad things without cease, yet still considering his words too few. He augmented them with bizarre theories, reversing common understanding to claim truth, seeking victory over others in reputation. Thus he was ill-suited to the world. Weak in virtue, strong in things, his path was obscure. Viewed through the Dao of heaven and earth, Hui Shi’s abilities were but the labor of a mosquito or a gnat—what use were they to the world? Thus it is said: \"What need?\" If one’s fulfillment lies in private conviction, it may yet be called noble, approaching the Way. But Hui Shi could not find peace in this; scattered among the myriad things without surfeit, he ended with a reputation for clever debate. Alas for Hui Shi’s talent—unbridled yet unable to follow, chasing the ten thousand things without return, like an echo pursuing sound or a shadow racing form. How lamentable!\n\nThe man who posed the question was an eccentric from the south. There was in the south a singularly lofty man named Huang Liao who asked Hui Shi: \"Why does heaven not fall? Why does earth not sink? Who governs wind, rain, thunder, and lightning?\" These are the marvels of creation—how could they be encompassed in words? Hui Shi neither declined nor demurred, answering without thought, responding extemporaneously. He discoursed on the principles of the myriad things in all their complexity, yet still deemed his words too few. He added strange and outlandish theories, taking contrarian views as proof, seeking to surpass others in reputation. Thus he was at odds with the world, ill-suited and discordant. Within, he had no true attainment—thus it is said he was \"weak in virtue.\" Outwardly, he forced his arguments—thus it is said he was \"strong in things.\" *Ao* means \"obscure\"; his path was neither bright nor upright, but dark and recondite. Measured against the Dao of heaven and earth, Hui Shi’s abilities were like those of a mosquito or a gnat—what use were they to the world? Thus it is said: \"What need?\" If one’s fulfillment lies in private conviction alone, it may yet be called noble. But to deem this superior to the noble Way is perilous. *Yu* means \"to surpass\n\nUnable to find peace within himself, he failed to accept his proper place. Scattering his efforts among the myriad things, he sought their principles to accommodate his own theories, never satisfied. In the end, he never grasped the Dao, merely gaining fame through debate—this was his ruin.\n\nHui Shi was indeed a man of talent, yet his dissipation left him with no true attainment. Chasing after external things, he never turned back—how lamentable! *Tai* means \"dissipated.\" Echo arises from sound, yet sound is the root and echo the branch. To exhaust the echo in sound is to forget the root. Shadow arises from form, for form is the root and shadow the branch. To wish to still the shadow without stopping the form is to run alongside it, never understanding the root—this is the analogy.\n\nThis concludes the *Zhuangzi*. It ends with Hui Shi, not because he stood among those who heard the Dao, but because the words of debaters, though they turn nothing into something, possess their own strange distinctiveness. Thus they are placed at the end. Though writing a book differs from composing an essay, it too has its own structure, with deliberate openings and closings—each serving its purpose. Just as the *Spring and Autumn Annals* ends with the capture of the qilin, or the *Doctrine of the Mean* concludes with \"Heaven’s charge, without sound, without scent,\" so too do the inner chapters of this book, with their \"Chaos and the Seven Orifices,\" form a single structure—this must not be overlooked.\n\nThose who explain the classics often speak of literary technique but may lack deep understanding of principle; those well-versed in principle may neglect the art of writing. Thus their readings lack vitality, and their interpretations lack savor. Only Master Aixuan’s Dao was lofty, and his writing exquisitely refined—his exegesis of the Six Classics stands peerless through the ages. What a pity that after Wangshan and Lexuan, his learning was not transmitted, and no one today knows of it.\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Ten.",

      "translated_text": "The Imperially Commissioned *Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Masters Section, Fourteenth Division: Oral Exegesis of the Zhuangzi*\n*Daoist School* | *Abstract*\n\nWe, your ministers, respectfully note: *Oral Exegesis of the Zhuangzi* in ten juan was composed by Lin Xi-yi of the Song. Xi-yi’s *Explanation of the “Artificers’ Record”* is recorded separately. This work is one of his three *Oral Exegeses*. A preface by the author states in essence: Reading the *Zhuangzi* presents five difficulties. One must first be well-versed in the *Analects*, *Mengzi*, *Great Learning*, and *Doctrine of the Mean*, with a mind already settled in principle. Furthermore, one must understand the veins of literary composition and the interpretive techniques of Chan Buddhism before grasping its meaning. I once heard these matters from Le-xuan, and through Le-xuan, I learned of Ai-xuan’s teachings. Thus, I gained a rough understanding of the veins of literary composition. I also delved into Buddhist texts and thereby awakened to the mechanisms of its free and transformative changes. In this work, I have achieved some insights, which are truly what previous scholars have not fully explored.\n\nXi-yi’s learning originated with Chen Zao. Zao’s learning was transmitted from Lin Guang-chao—Le-xuan being Zao’s sobriquet, and Ai-xuan being Guang-chao’s sobriquet. All references to “the former teacher” in the text refer to Zao.\n\nThe preface states that Guo Xiang’s commentary fails to divide chapters and parse sentences, while the explanations of Wang Pang and Lü Hui-qing obscure the main purport, further increasing doubts about the *Zhuangzi*. Now, upon examination: Guo Xiang’s commentary marks meaning beyond the boundaries of conventional thought. Xi-yi, by contrast, seeks it through chapter and verse—his perspective is already narrow. The commentaries of Wang and Lü take the *Zhuangzi* to explain the *Zhuangzi*, without forcing it to conform to Confucian principles. This is to return Daoist words to the Daoists, avoiding the conflation of the Two Schools with the Confucian gate. Xi-yi, however, having taken refuge in the Daoist gate to annotate the *Zhuangzi*, feared reproach from Confucians and thus claimed it harmonized with the Sage. This is a strained and defensive view. Yet in truth, his approach takes the *Zhuangzi* on its own terms, allowing each to elucidate its own meaning. Moreover, his expositions are clear, lucid, and fluent, avoiding abstruse language. He offers many insights into the *Zhuangzi*, surpassing later figures like Lin Yun-ming, whose fragmented and shallow readings apply the methods of examination essays to the *Zhuangzi*. Thus, we record and preserve this work to represent one school of thought.\n\nRespectfully submitted after collation in the eleventh month of the forty-third year of the Qianlong reign.\n*Chief Compilers:*\n*Minister* Ji Yun\n*Minister* Lu Xi-xiong\n*Minister* Sun Shi-yi",

      "translated_text": "**Chief Collator:**\n*Minister* Lu Fei-chi\n\n**Original Preface to *Zhuangzi Kouyi***\n\nZhuangzi was a man of Song, named Zhou, styled Zixiu. Born in Suiyang County of Meng during the early Warring States period, he lived contemporaneously with Mencius, yet withdrew from the world to speak freely. The book he authored bears his name, and he himself divided it into three parts: seven Inner Chapters, fifteen Outer Chapters, and eleven Miscellaneous Chapters. Though thus arranged, the three modes of expression—*yuyan* (parables), *zhongyan* (weighted words), and *zhiyan* (goblet words)—pervade the entire work. The Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters take their titles from their opening lines, while the Inner Chapters bear names with distinct meanings. Their language is more refined than that of the Outer and Miscellaneous Chapters, yet the intent of their arguments differs not at all.\n\nChen Tongfu once remarked: \"The world cannot do without such a man, nor without such a book, for only then can a gentleman’s discourse be complete.\" Though Zhuangzi’s work may be deemed unorthodox, it is indispensable to the world. Guo Xiang called it \"unorthodox yet the crown of the Hundred Schools\"—a fair judgment. This book cannot be left unread, yet it is most difficult to read. Su Dongpo’s lifelong writings were all awakened by it; the five thousand and forty volumes of the *Great Treasury of Scriptures* were all drawn from its depths. Even the literary prowess of Zuo Qiuming and Sima Qian cannot rival it. How, then, could one not read it? Yet why is it called difficult?\n\nMaster Yichuan said: \"Buddhist scriptures are like lewd sounds and alluring colors, easily bewitching people, for their language is shocking and their appearances deceptive.\" How much more so with this book? Its discussions of *renyi* (benevolence and righteousness) and *xingming* (nature and destiny) differ entirely from our own—this is the first difficulty. Its intent is to rival the Master (Confucius), so its words often exceed proper bounds—this is the second difficulty. It disdains the vulgar and mediocre, like the Buddhist teachings of the \"supreme vehicle,\" so its language is often excessively lofty—this is the third difficulty. Its brushwork dances and transforms, defying the paths of ordinary prose—this is the fourth difficulty. Moreover, its linguistic veins and thrusts resemble the Chan school’s \"sudden teaching,\" akin to matters on the edge of a sword—something absent in our Confucian texts—this is the fifth difficulty.\n\nOnly one well-versed in the *Analects*, *Mencius*, *Zhongyong*, and *Great Learning*, with a firm grasp of principle, an understanding of textual bloodlines, and knowledge of Chan techniques, can trace its words and meanings to their proper places. Though its style may be unrestrained and playful, its great principles and fundamental tenets never diverge from the Sage. Without such discernment, one may impose arbitrary interpretations, either dismissing it as heretical or being swayed by its allure, leading to licentiousness or emptiness. Thus, Yichuan’s warning about \"lewd sounds and alluring colors\" is not to be taken lightly.\n\nIn my youth, I once heard of Le Xuan’s teachings, and through him, of Ai Xuan’s doctrines. I gained a rough understanding of textual bloodlines and later delved into Buddhist scriptures, awakening to its mechanisms of transformation. I flatter myself that I have gained some insight into this book, uncovering what previous scholars had not fully explored. Finally, I encountered the commentaries of Lü Jifu and Wang Yuanzhe. Though they divided chapters and parsed sentences more finely than Guo Xiang, their grasp of the great principles remained unclear. Their interpretations only deepened doubts about Zhuangzi. Yet, in my humble view, this book stands alone in the world, never having offended the Confucian gate. Were Zhuangzi to return today, he might well call me a \"disciple of a thousand years hence.\"\n\nThis is not offered as a contribution to the author but shared with fellow seekers.\n\n**Preface by Lin Xi-yi**\n\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Volume One\nBy Lin Xi-yi of the Song Dynasty\n**Inner Chapters: \"Free and Easy Wandering\" (First)**",

      "translated_text": "\"Free and Easy Wandering\" is the title established for this chapter. The Inner Chapters comprise seven, each named with three characters. *You* (游) refers to the mind’s wandering in the heavens. *Xiaoya* (逍遥) speaks of leisurely ease and unconstrained freedom. In the *Analects*, the disciples describe the Master with but a single word: *le* (乐, joy). In the *Three Hundred Poems*, when depicting figures—such as \"southward, the trailing vine\" or \"on South Mountain, the terrace\"—they say *le* (乐, joy), for even the noble person knows only this one *le*. Thus, what is called \"Free and Easy Wandering\" is precisely the *le* of the *Poetry* and the *Analects*. The entire work begins with this single word, *le*—consider the breadth of this old man’s heart! If one can perceive even a trace of its flavor here, then one may read *Fayi* (*芣苢*). That poem depicts the joy within the heart without ever uttering the word *le*—such is the marvel of its poetic method, like adding yet another tier to a seven-story pagoda.\n\nIn the Northern Darkness there is a fish, its name is Kun. The Kun’s size—who knows how many thousand *li* it spans? It transforms into a bird, its name is Peng. The Peng’s back—who knows how many thousand *li* it stretches? Roused to flight, its wings hang like clouds draped across the sky. This bird, when the seas surge, will journey to the Southern Darkness. The Southern Darkness is the Celestial Pond. *Qi Xie* is a record of marvels. Its words say: When the Peng migrates to the Southern Darkness, it strikes the water for three thousand *li*, spiraling upward on the whirlwind to ninety thousand *li*, departing with the six-month winds. The wild horses, the dust motes—",

      "translated_text": "The living creatures are blown along by the breath—is the azure of the sky its true color? Or is it so distant that it has no limit? From its vantage below, it sees only thus. Moreover, when water accumulates, if it is not deep, it cannot bear a great vessel. Pour a cup of water into a hollow in the hall, and a mustard stalk becomes a boat; place the cup there, and it sticks fast, for the water is shallow and the vessel too large. When wind accumulates, if it is not thick, it cannot bear great wings. Thus, only with ninety thousand *li* of wind beneath does the wind suffice. Only then, borne upon the wind, its back against the blue sky, meeting no obstacle, does it at last set its course southward.\n\nThe cicada and the fledgling dove laugh at it, saying: \"We dart forth and fly, striking the elm and sandalwood; sometimes we fall short and land on the ground—what need is there to rise ninety thousand *li* and journey south?\" This passage merely depicts the boundless joy within the breast, yet it sets forth this metaphor. Its meaning is this: what men perceive is small, hence the clamor of worldly strife. But if one knows that beyond heaven and earth there are such vast worlds, one’s own body, though but a grain in the granary, cannot be compared. This is the same idea as Dai Jinren’s \"ant-horn barbarians.\"\n\nThe Northern Darkness is the Northern Sea. The names Kun and Peng are but allegory. Some interpret them in terms of yin and yang—all such explanations impose divisions where none exist. When a bird takes flight, the word \"roused\" alone is extraordinary. \"Sea surge\" means the stirring of the sea. Even now, folk songs from the coast speak of \"the sixth-month sea surge.\" When the sea stirs, great winds arise, its waters seething from the depths, their roar audible for *li*. Only with such winds can the migration southward occur.\n\nThe Southern Darkness is also a sea. Zhuangzi further glosses it as the Celestial Pond. *Qi Xie* is the name of a book, its records all strange and extraordinary matters, much like the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*. Yet this book may not have existed; Zhuangzi composed this account and then cited it as proof—another instance of his playful artistry. \"Spiraling\" describes flight; \"whirlwind\" is the force of the wind. \"Three thousand\" and \"ninety thousand\" merely convey its vast height and distance.",

      "translated_text": "The bird departs with the sixth-month *qi*—this means its comings and goings must pause for half a year before it can take flight.\n\nThe lines on \"wild horses\" and \"dust motes\" are the most extraordinary passage in this text. The preceding and following sections often lack coherence. \"Wild horses\" are floating gossamer threads; \"dust motes\" are water vapor, as Du Fu wrote: *\"Falling blossoms, drifting gossamer—still the white sun.\"* These \"wild horses\" and \"dust motes\"—whence do they arise? They are the living things of the world, their breaths mutually stirring one another, so that such phenomena appear in the empty sky. These three lines are meant to set the stage for what follows, first establishing this scene: when one gazes upward at the heavens, they appear deep blue—yet is this their true color? Or is it merely that our vision, having reached its limit, finds no end above, and thus sees only a hazy expanse? When the *peng* soars to the heavens, its view downward upon the human realm spans countless *li*; the breaths of \"wild horses\" and \"dust motes\" stirring one another must appear just as hazy, much like our view upward from below. These lines serve only to depict the vast height of the *peng*'s flight, yielding such marvelous effect. If, as some interpretations hold, the *peng* were taken as vast and \"wild horses\" and \"dust motes\" as minute, the preceding and following lines would fail to connect, and the passage’s power would be lost.\n\n\"For the waters to accumulate\"—their depth is the metaphor for the wind below. A hollow in the hall—a deep recess. If the water is shallow, it can only float a mustard seed; place a cup or bowl there, and it will stick fast. *Jiao* (胶) is pronounced *jiao*, meaning \"to adhere, unmoving.\" When the *peng* is in the heavens, nine *wan li* above the earth, winds rise from valleys and ravines, swelling mightily to fill the four seas. With the *peng* aloft, these winds lie beneath it, forming a thick foundation. Only a wind of nine *wan li* can be called \"thick\"; such a wind alone can bear the *peng*'s wings, allowing it to \"ride the azure heavens\"—this speaks to the height of its flight. \"No obstruction bars its way,\" and it plans its journey south from the Northern Sea.",

      "translated_text": "When Tang questioned Ji about this, it was indeed so. Beyond the barren north lies a vast sea, the Celestial Pond. There is a fish there, spanning thousands of *li* in breadth, its length unknown—its name is Kun. There is also a bird there, named Peng, whose back resembles Mount Tai and whose wings are like clouds draped across the sky. It soars upon the whirling winds, spiraling upward ninety thousand *li*, piercing through the clouds and bearing the azure heavens on its back before setting its course southward, bound for the Southern Darkness.\n\nThe quail scoffs at it, saying: *\"Where does it think it’s going? I leap and flutter upward no more than a few fathoms, then glide among the mugwort and artemisia—this is the utmost of flight! Where does it think it’s going?\"*\n\nThis is the distinction between small and great. This passage merely restates the previous one with further evidence: Tang once questioned Ji about this very matter. Ji was a man’s name, and *is indeed so* refers back to the earlier account. Here, the concluding phrase of the prior section becomes the opening of this one—such is the rhythmic cadence of the composition. *Barren north* denotes the land of no vegetation. *Whirling winds* describes the force of the gale; *ram’s horns* refers to the spiraling shape of the wind. *To soar* means to take flight. *Piercing the clouds* signifies that at ninety thousand *li* above, there are no longer any clouds—just as people say that atop Mount Tai, clouds gather below and thunder rumbles like an infant’s cry, or as some claim clouds only fill the mid-heavens. *Setting its course southward* means planning the journey to the Southern Darkness, first devising the migration before heading toward the southern sea.",

Its perspective mirrors that of the previous passage.\n\nThus, those whose knowledge suffices for an office, whose conduct matches a village, whose virtue pleases a lord, or whose governance commands a state—such men regard themselves no differently than the marsh sparrow. Yet Song Rongzi would still laugh at them. Though the whole world praises him, he feels no encouragement; though the whole world blames him, he feels no discouragement. He has settled the distinction between inner and outer, discerned the boundary between honor and shame—this is all. In his dealings with the world, he is not overly concerned. Even so, he has yet to establish the ultimate.\n\nLiezi could ride the wind, moving with effortless grace, returning after fifteen days. Yet even he, in attaining such felicity, was not without constraint. Though he avoided walking, he still depended on something. But one who rides the true essence of heaven and earth, harnesses the transformations of the six qi, and roams the boundless—what does he depend on? Therefore it is said: the Perfect One has no self, the Spirit Man has no merit, the Sage has no name.\n\n*Knowledge suffices for an office* means one’s wisdom can manage a single post. *Conduct matches a village* means one’s virtue and conduct can align with a village, drawing people to follow. *Virtue is recognized by a lord* means finding favor and thus being able to summon a state, governing its affairs. These three types of men each take pride in their abilities, viewing themselves like the marsh sparrow.\n\nSong Rongzi, however, perceives the greater truth. Though the whole world slanders or praises him, he remains unmoved, unshaken. How does he achieve this? He knows the original heart as inner, all things as outer. Thus it is said: he settles the division between inner and outer. What lies outside is subject to honor and shame; what lies within is beyond them. Knowing this distinction, he discerns that honor and shame are but external conditions—this is all. The principle extends no further.",

      "translated_text": "He, valuing the original heart and dismissing external things, how could he eagerly pursue worldly affairs with such relentless haste? Though Song Rongzi’s ability is indeed thus, he has yet to establish a great foundation or achieve a lasting legacy.\n\nNow consider Liezi, who rides the wind and wanders between the heavens and earth, returning only after half a month. When he soars upon the wind, he is *lingran*—light and effortless—so perfectly does he embody that drifting, ethereal bearing. *Lingran* describes his floating grace; *shan* means excellence. Having mastered riding the wind, he deems those who toil to cultivate themselves for blessings—anxiously fearing they may fall short—as beneath mention. *Wei shu shu* means he does not deign to act with such frequent urgency as others.\n\nMen walk upon the earth; Liezi travels by wind. Though he is free from walking, he still depends on something—without wind, he cannot proceed. Thus it is said: he still has something to rely upon. But one who rides the inherent principle of heaven and earth, harnessing the six qi—yin and yang, wind and rain, darkness and light—and roams the beginning of the formless, without limit or end, such a one has nothing to depend upon. This marks the distinction between having traces and leaving none.\n\nTo leave no trace is to be called a *Perfect Person*, a *Spiritual Person*, a *Sage*. *Wu ji* (without self), *wu gong* (without achievement), *wu ming* (without fame)—all describe the absence of traces. The final three phrases are added to praise again and again.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, saying: “The sun and moon have risen, yet the torch still burns—is it not difficult for its light to compare? The timely rain has fallen, yet you still irrigate—is it not laborious for your moisture to suffice? You stand, and the world is governed, yet I remain in your place. I see my own inadequacy. Please take the world.”\n\nXu You replied: “You govern the world, and the world is already well-governed. Yet I would replace you—should I seek a name? A name is but the guest of reality. Would I become a guest? The wren nests in the deep forest, yet needs but a single branch; the mole drinks from the river, yet takes no more than its fill. Return, my lord, and rest. What use have I for the world? Though the cook does not prepare the feast, the master of ceremonies would not step beyond the wine vessels to take his place.”\n\nThe torch is but a flame; with the sun and moon already bright, why hold a fire? With the timely rain already fallen, why carry a jar? Yao said to Xu You: “Stand, and the world governs itself—yet you insist I remain in this role. I see my own insufficiency,” likening himself to the torch and irrigation. *Shi* means “to preside”; *zhi tianxia* means to offer the world to you. If fame does not arise from oneself but from others, then it is external. When name is set against reality, reality is the master and name the guest. “I do not become a guest” means I do not lose myself to external things. The wren and the mole are Xu You’s self-comparisons, expressing his contentment. *Yan* means to lie low; the *yan shu* is a burrowing rat. “Return and rest, my lord” means “go back and do not trouble yourself to visit me.” The cook and the master of ceremonies have different duties—just as I cannot abandon my joys to replace you, each must guard his own role, much as the master of ceremonies would not overstep the wine vessels to take the cook’s knife.\n\nShoulder Wu asked Lian Shu: “I heard Jie Yu’s words—they were vast yet without substance, sweeping yet never returning. I was alarmed and terrified by them, as boundless as the Milky Way. They were grand yet absurd, far removed from human sentiment.”",
      "overlap_context": "ow.\n\nSong Rongzi, however, perceives the greater truth. Though the whole world slanders or praises him, he remains unmoved, unshaken. How does he achieve this? He knows the original heart as inner, all things as outer. Thus it is said: he settles the division between inner and outer. What lies outside is subject to honor and shame; what lies within is beyond them. Knowing this distinction, he discerns that honor and shame are but external conditions—this is all. The principle extends no further.",

Their skin is like ice and snow, their bearing as graceful as a maiden’s. They eat no grain, but drink the wind and sip the dew. They ride the clouds and qi, harness flying dragons, and wander beyond the Four Seas. Their spirit congeals, making things free from blight so that the harvest ripens. Yet I deem this madness and do not believe it.”\n\nLian Shu said, “Indeed, the blind have no part in the sight of patterns, nor the deaf in the sound of bells and drums. But is it only the body that may be deaf and blind? The mind, too, may suffer such afflictions. His words are like a timely admonition to you. That person, that power—it pervades all things, uniting them as one. Who in the world, seeking order, would weary themselves with petty cares? Such a one takes the world as their concern, yet nothing harms them. Though great floods rise to the heavens, they do not drown; though great droughts melt metal and stone, scorch earth and mountains, they do not burn. From their dust and chaff, they could mold even Yao and Shun. Who would trouble themselves with worldly affairs?\n\nShoulder Wu and Lian Shu may not have truly met such a person—these are but parables. Nor should one seek meaning solely in names. Though some passages may be explained, not all hold literal truth.\n\n‘Vast yet without substance’ means lacking reality. ‘Sweeping yet never returning’ means their grand words press ever onward without looking back. ‘The Milky Way’ is the celestial river, its boundlessness referring to its endless expanse. *Jingting* means distant boundaries. ‘Grand yet absurd’ means their words are extraordinary, far removed from common human sentiment.”",

      "translated_text": "The Miaogu She Mountain—such is its name—is crystalline with ice and snow. What it nurtures is the fullness of yang qi, lying dormant and unmoving, thus congealed as if in ice and snow. Even today, those who practice qi-cultivation among the Daoists may achieve this. \"Graceful and supple\" describes one who is tender and lovely. A \"maiden\" is an unmarried girl. The following four lines speak of her spiritual wondrousness: her spirit is congealed and settled, and where she dwells, the hundred things naturally suffer no blight or pestilence, while the harvest ripens of itself. This is what Jie Yu meant—his words were as mad as they were deceptive.\n\nShen Wu took his words for deception, unworthy of belief. \"Indeed\" means that it is certainly so. You remain doubtful and disbelieving. The spectacle of patterns and the sound of bells and drums—all people see and hear them, yet the blind and deaf have no part in this, for theirs is a malady of the bodily form. How could this malady afflict only the body? It resides in the heart as well, for their hearts lack perception, as if deaf and blind, and thus they fail to grasp these words, dismissing them as deception.\n\n\"At this time\" refers to the present. \"You\" and \"your\" in the previous explanations were all taken to mean \"maiden,\" but this is forced and does not convey the true meaning. Rather, it means: how could such words be within the capacity of people like you? Such people, in their virtue, roam freely above the ten thousand things, and the world governs itself.

      "translated_text": "The character 蕲 is interchangeable with 祈, and 乱 signifies governance. This speaks of the people of the world who each pray for order in themselves. Yet if I but practice non-action, they will govern themselves—why should I exhaust myself with ceaseless toil? This expresses the meaning of self-imposed weariness.\n\n\"Nothing can harm them\" means that external things cannot disturb their fundamental heart-mind. The vastness of water can reach the heavens, yet such a person does not drown; the severity of drought can melt metal and stone, parch mountains and dry the earth, yet they remain unscathed—this speaks of their unobstructed self-attainment in all circumstances.\n\n\"Dust, grime, chaff, and husks\" refer to remnants and excess. It is said that if such a person were to apply these remnants, they could accomplish the deeds of Yao and Shun—how would they trouble themselves with worldly affairs? Here, \"things\" refers to worldly matters, and \"engaging in affairs\" means to undertake them. \"Molding and casting\" conveys the sense of bringing something to completion.\n\nThis single phrase aligns with what Guo Xiang called \"unconventional,\" though the original intent of his writing was to disparage the vulgar Confucians, hence his language sometimes exceeds proper bounds. One should not judge him by this alone. As Li Taibai said: \"The deeds of Yao and Shun are not so astonishing; nothing compares to the lofty purity of Boyi and Shuqi.\" How is this different?\n\nThe people of Song carried ceremonial caps to Yue, but the Yue people, with shorn hair and tattooed bodies, had no use for them. The caps of Song were ceremonial headwear, yet the Yue, with their shorn hair, had no need for clothing or caps. The people of Song, bringing such goods to Yue, naturally found no market for them. Zhuangzi’s words here are vast, yet the people of this world, with their shallow views, find no use for them. What is the point of speaking thus? It means the world is unworthy of such discourse.\n\nYao governed the people of the world and brought order to the realm. He went to see the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu at the northern bank of the Fen River and was suddenly lost in reverie, forgetting his empire. This passage also conveys the idea that only by broadening one’s perspective can one recognize one’s own limitations. Yao, the greatest ruler of ancient and modern times, upon seeing the Four Masters on Mount Miaogu south of the Fen River, was still struck with awe and self-doubt—how much more so for others? \"Forgetting his empire\" means he forgot his dominion over the world. \"Lost in reverie\" conveys a sense of profound bewilderment.\n\nThe Four Masters are nameless; some identify them as Xu You, Nie Que, Wang Ni, and Bei Yi, while others say the *Classic of Mountains and Seas* states that Mount Miaogu lies beyond the seas, and the Fen River’s northern bank was Yao’s capital. Seeing the spirits of Miaogu in his own capital was like seeing Yao’s own heart. One version divides them into four types: those who embody the root, those who follow traces, those who are neither root nor trace, and those who are neither non-root nor non-trace. Such interpretations grow increasingly absurd, failing to grasp that this is precisely Zhuangzi’s playful wit—like what people today call \"head-scratching talk.\" Those who engage in such convoluted exegesis fall right into his trap. How could they truly read Zhuangzi? In truth, these are all allegories.\n\nIn essence, it means that people are each confined by their own limited views and unaware of their delusions. Only those with great insight can illuminate and break free from them.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: \"The King of Wei gave me seeds of a great gourd. I planted them, and they grew to bear fruit of five *dan* in capacity. When I filled it with water or broth, its strength was insufficient to lift itself. When I split it to make ladles, they were too shallow and broad to hold anything. Though not insubstantial in size, it was utterly useless, so I smashed it.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"You are indeed inept at putting great things to use. There was a man of Song skilled in making an unchapping salve. For generations, his family earned their living by washing silk floss. A traveler heard of this and offered a hundred pieces of gold for the recipe. The family gathered and deliberated: 'For generations, we have washed silk floss and earned no more than a few pieces of gold. Now, in a single morning, we can sell this skill for a hundred. Let us give it to him.' The traveler acquired it and presented it to the King of Wu. When Yue raised arms against Wu, the king sent the traveler to lead his forces. In winter, they fought a naval battle with Yue and crushed them. The king then enfeoffed him with land. The same unchapping salve could lead to enfeoffment or remain a means of washing silk floss—the difference lies in how it is used.\n\nNow you have a gourd of five *dan*—why not consider making it into a great float to drift upon the rivers and lakes? Instead, you worry that it is too shallow and broad to hold anything. Clearly, your heart-mind is still as obstructed as a clump of reeds.\"\n\nThe gourd can be made into a ladle, for it is the fruit of the bottle gourd. A single gourd of such size, bearing fruit of five *dan*, could also hold five *dan* of water. \"Firm and heavy\" describes its strength. A ladle is half a gourd. \"Shallow and broad\" describes its appearance. \"Smashed\" means to break it. The \"unchapping salve\" prevents hands from cracking in winter. \"Washing silk floss\" refers to the family’s generations-long occupation of washing silk floss using this salve. A *zun* is a floating gourd used to stay afloat in water—tying it to one’s waist allows one to float, hence the saying: \"In midstream, losing a boat, a gourd is worth a thousand gold.\" Zhuangzi, having used the unchapping salve as an analogy for failing to recognize proper use, then says: \"With such a large gourd, why not consider making it into a floating gourd for the river?\" \"Consider\" means to ponder. \"Why not consider?\" means: why does your thinking not extend to this? \"A heart-mind like reeds\" means a heart-mind as obstructed as tangled reeds. The meaning of this passage is simply that seeing only the small prevents one from using the great.\n\nHui Shi said to Zhuangzi: \"I have a great tree—people call it a *chu*. Its trunk is gnarled and swollen, unfit for the carpenter’s line; its branches are twisted and bent, unfit for the compass and square. Even if planted by the roadside, no carpenter would glance at it. Now your words are vast but useless—everyone rejects them alike.\"\n\nZhuangzi replied: \"Have you never seen a wildcat or weasel? They crouch low to lie in wait, leaping east and west, heedless of height or depth, only to be caught in a trap or snare and die. Now consider the yak: as great as a cloud hanging from the sky, it is indeed large, yet it cannot catch mice. You have a great tree and worry that it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothingness, the vast wilderness? Wander idly by its side, roam freely and sleep beneath it. It will not be felled by axes, nor will anything harm it. If it is of no use, where is the hardship in that?\"\n\n*Chu* is the name of a worthless tree. \"Great trunk\" refers to the tree’s body.",

This illustrates how things in the world vary in size and function—one cannot dismiss all great things as useless.\n\nThe \"land of Nothingness\" and the \"vast wilderness\" refer to the realm of natural creation and the supreme Dao, where one may find joy. In the bustling human world, fortune and misfortune are intertwined. But if one soars high and wanders far, delighting in the Dao, though of no use to the world, neither will harm befall them—just as the saying goes, \"The blade and saw do not touch them; the chaos of the world does not reach them.\" Thus it is said: \"It will not be felled by axes, nor will anything harm it. If it is of no use, where is the hardship in that?\"\n\nMaster Hui’s question and Zhuangzi’s answer are like a playful exchange, from which later generations have spun countless interpretations. The original source lies here.\n\n**Chapter Two: On the Equality of Things**\n*Wu lun* refers to the debates among people and things—what we call \"the many opinions.\" *Qi* means \"to unify\"; it is to harmonize all opinions into one. In the Warring States period, schools of thought differed, each refuting the other. Thus Zhuangzi believed it better to forget right and wrong and return to nature—this is the intent behind the chapter’s title.\n\nThe \"Heavenly Pipe,\" \"Earthly Pipe,\" and \"Human Pipe\" are metaphors drawn from sound. Nan Guo Ziqi leaned against his armrest, sat upright, and sighed, his gaze fixed on the sky, as if he had lost his companion. Yan Cheng Ziyou stood in attendance before him and asked, \"What is this? Can the body truly be made like withered wood, and the mind like dead ashes? The one leaning here now is not the same as the one who leaned here before.\"\n\n*Qi ji* means \"to lean on an armrest.\" *Fang ran* describes a state of emptiness. \"Losing one’s companion\" refers to the common view of the self and things as separate—here, that distinction is forgotten. \"Withered wood\" signifies lifelessness; \"dead ashes\" mean the mind does not stir. \"The one leaning here now\" means that today, the Master’s demeanor is not like that of others who lean on armrests. Where there is a self, there are things; to lose the self is to have no self. Without self, there are no things. \"Do you understand this?\" asks whether he grasps this principle. *Wu* is the self; it does not say \"I have lost myself\" but \"I have lost *wu*.\" This means that if even a trace of selfishness remains untransformed within, there will still be a division between self and other. The three words \"I have lost *wu*\" are profoundly apt. Dongshan said, \"Now it is not I; now I am truly it\"—this is the crux of the matter.\n\n\"You have heard the Human Pipe but not the Earthly Pipe; you have heard the Earthly Pipe but not the Heavenly Pipe.\"\n\nZiyou said, \"May I ask the method?\"\nZiqi replied: \"The great clod breathes—its name is wind. It does nothing, yet when it stirs, the myriad hollows roar in fury. Have you alone not heard its howling? The towering peaks and forests, the great trees with trunks a hundred spans around—some hollows resemble noses, mouths, ears, beams, rings, mortars, pits, or puddles. They hiss, gurgle, shriek, inhale, cry out, wail, moan, and shriek again. The first calls out, and the rest follow in harmony. A gentle breeze brings a soft response; a whirlwind brings a mighty one. When the fierce gale subsides, all hollows fall silent. Have you alone not seen their trembling and swaying?\"\n\nZiqi, seeing that Ziyou’s question revealed some insight, sought to instruct him with the Heavenly Pipe and thus posed this question. *Fang* means \"method.\" He asks, \"What is the nature of this principle?\"",

You have a great tree and worry that it is useless—why not plant it in the land of Nothingness, the vast wilderness? Wander idly by its side, roam freely and sleep beneath it. It will not be felled by axes, nor will anything harm it. If it is of no use, where is the hardship in that?\"\n\n*Chu* is the name of a worthless tree. \"Great trunk\" refers to the tree’s body.",

      "translated_text": "The Great Clump is Heaven and Earth. Why is there wind between Heaven and Earth? It is like a person’s exhalation. *Is* means \"only,\" and *wu zuo* means \"it does nothing.\" If it does not act, then all is still. But when it acts, the myriad hollows roar in fury—this speaks of how, with the slightest stirring, the entire world resounds. The myriad hollows are the hollows of the myriad trees. *Liaoliao* is the sound of a long wind. *Wei* is read as *wei*, and *cuì* is read as *cui*; *weijiacuì* describes the swaying of forests and trees. *A hundred spans around* speaks of the trees’ great girth—a girth measured by two hands clasped together. Above, the myriad hollows were mentioned; here, only the largest trees are described, from which the rest may be inferred. The hollows of great trees vary in shape, each resembling something: *jī* are the square beams atop pillars; *quān* are the round hoops like those of a cup; *wā* are the curved hollows; *wū* are the sunken ones. From *jī* to *yǎo*, these describe the sounds within the hollows. *Yú* is a light sound, and *yóng* is a heavy one. When the wind arrives first, its sound is like a leading chant; those that follow are like a responding chorus, light and heavy harmonizing. A *ling* wind is a gentle breeze; when the wind is small, the harmonizing sounds are also small. A *piāo* wind is a great wind; when the wind is strong, the harmonizing sounds are also great. A *lì* wind is a fierce, violent wind. *Jì* means \"to cease.\" Once the wind ceases, the sounds that once filled the hollows vanish, and thus they are called \"empty.\" *Tiáotiáo* and *diāodiāo* both describe the trembling and swaying of trees in the wind. Earlier, it said, \"Have you alone not heard?\" and later, \"Have you alone not seen?\"—this is the interlocking structure of the passage.\n\nAs for you—Zhuangzi’s writing excels in many ways, and this passage is among its finest, a masterpiece within a masterpiece. In the entire book, this is the foremost text; indeed, among all writers past and present, none has matched this passage. Poetry is sound, and painting is form; this describes a scene nearly impossible to depict. Yet who has ever painted sound? From *jī* to *yǎo*, eight characters describe eight sounds. *Yú* and *yóng* are harmonizing sounds. The wind between Heaven and Earth is formless and invisible, yet its sound, though unseen, is vividly captured by his brush. How could the Old Immortal of Nanhua possess such skill? Every time I read this, I cannot help but dance with joy, forgetting myself. This passage speaks of the earthly pipes, yet it naturally leads to the heavenly pipes in the following section—such is the flow of his prose. Some say this describes the earthly pipes as the natural sounds of Heaven, and thus they are also the heavenly pipes. This is true, for if the wind does not arise from the workings of creation, from where else could it come? Yet observe how he first speaks of the earthly pipes, then returns to them, revealing the sinews and framework of his thought.\n\nZiyou said, \"The earthly pipes are the myriad hollows. The human pipes are the bamboo flutes. May I ask, what are the heavenly pipes?\" The human pipes are not only bamboo flutes—metal, stone, silk, and gourd instruments all belong to this category. Here, he mentions only one example. Earlier, he spoke of the earthly pipes, then the heavenly pipes, and dismisses the human pipes in a single phrase—such is the method of his writing. To read Zhuangzi’s work, one must examine it closely to find the entry point.\n\nZiqi said, \"When the wind blows through the myriad things, each sounds different, yet it allows them to be as they are. All take their own forms in anger—who is it that stirs them?\" *Blows through the myriad* refers to all things that produce sound. It speaks of how all sounding things are blown by the Creator. *Blows* and *allows* both belong to the Creator. *Take their own forms* means they take it upon themselves. *All take their own forms* means all things believe their sounds arise from their own power, unaware that it is the stirring of a single *qi*. When *qi* arises within and becomes sound, he uses the word *anger*, akin to \"angry flight,\" both attributed to the Creator.\n\n\"The great knowledge is leisurely, the small knowledge is petty. The great words blaze, the small words chatter.\" The *great knowledge* belongs to those of superior understanding; *leisurely* describes their ease and self-possession. The *small knowledge* refers to those who calculate and scheme; *petty* describes their meticulous distinctions. The *great words* belong to those with grand ambitions; *blaze* describes their radiance. Zhuangzi’s meaning includes figures like Yi, Zhou, Confucius, and Mencius in this phrase. The *small words* belong to those of limited vision; *chatter* describes their hesitation and caution. The doctrines of the Hundred Schools and the gossip of the marketplace are all contained in this phrase. These four lines summarize the two kinds of people in the world: those who understand principle and guard against affairs, and those who discuss learning, techniques, and theories.\n\n\"In sleep, their spirits intertwine; when awake, their forms open. They engage with things, forming bonds, and daily battle with their hearts.\" Having described the four kinds of people above, he now elucidates them through the human body. *In sleep, their spirits intertwine* means that at night, the spirit gathers in the heart. *When awake, their forms open* means that by day, the four limbs are in motion. These two lines encompass everyone from the emperor to the common people. *Form bonds* refers to external interactions; when people rest at night and rise at dawn, their encounters and engagements wear on their hearts like combat, day after day. Thus, he says, \"They engage with things, forming bonds, and daily battle with their hearts.\" This is akin to Mencius’s \"what one does by day may be fettered and lost by night,\" though Mencius’s phrasing is gentler. Zhuangzi’s language, however, is a hundredfold more vivid and stirring. Later Chan masters often adopted this style. *Màn*, *jiào*, and *mì* describe three kinds of people: some act slowly and hesitantly; others speak with hidden traps, hence *jiào* (pitfall); still others plan meticulously, leaving no detail unconsidered, hence *mì* (dense). These all describe how people respond to the world with their minds, yet none attain freedom—they all suffer from anxiety and fear. This is what Confucius called \"the petty man is always anxious.\" But Zhuangzi’s meaning extends even to Yao, Shun, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius, who were all anxious. In minor matters, they tremble with fear, hence *small fear, trembling*. In great matters, their worries run deep, their thoughts far-reaching, as if lost or doubtful, hence *great fear, mournful*.\n\n\"Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow trigger—this is called controlling right and wrong. They cling like sworn oaths—this is called guarding victory.\"",

      "translated_text": "Their decline is like autumn and winter—this speaks of their daily dissipation. What they drown in through their actions cannot be restored. Their weariness is like being bound—this speaks of their aged exhaustion. The heart near death cannot be revived. Joy, anger, sorrow, delight, thought, sighing, change, fear, restlessness, abandon, openness, and affectation—like mushrooms sprouting from empty steam, their discussions of right and wrong each have their own fixed target, as if archers aiming at a mark. Thus it is said, \"Their outbursts are like the release of a crossbow trigger,\" meaning not a single word is spoken in vain. *Sī* (to govern) means to take as one’s master. The mind that clings to victory remains untransformed, lingering in the breast as if bound by a sworn oath. Their use of the mind wears them away day by day, month by month—this speaks of their inner torment.\n\nThings are born in spring and summer, wither in autumn and winter—this is the time of emaciation. Thus it is used as a metaphor for daily dissipation. The three phrases below express this meaning, while those above serve as analogies. Yet once the mind is thus submerged, it departs and cannot return—hence \"what they drown in through their actions.\" The first *zhī* (之) is a grammatical particle; the second *zhī* (之) means \"to go.\" \"Cannot be restored\" means it cannot be retrieved. The *cǐ* (此) in \"this\" also means \"to go,\" speaking of what cannot be turned back. Their being stifled by material desires is like being tightly bound—aged and beyond salvation, hence \"aged exhaustion.\" *Xù* (洫) means to fall into a ditch. Such people, though their bodies live, have hearts already like the dead. Thus it is said, \"near death,\" meaning their breasts hold no awareness. *Yáng* (阳) means life—this speaks of their hearts being dead, never to revive.\n\nThe above describes the worldly use of the mind. The twelve characters below—joy, anger, sorrow, delight, thought, sighing, change, fear, restlessness, abandon, openness, and affectation—further depict their outward appearance.

      "translated_text": "Such shifting of intentions and postures—now desiring this, now longing for that. *Zhé* (慹) depicts the appearance of worry and hesitation, unmoving. *Yáo yāng xiáng* (姚央庠) describes the manner of indulgence and abandon. *Qǐ* (启) means openness, a lack of restraint. *Zuò* (做) refers to affectation, striking poses.\n\nThough people appear thus, in truth they are not free—like joy arising from emptiness, like mushrooms formed by the steaming of qi. All these various types are made to be so by the Maker of Things, as if blown by the myriad winds. This speaks of the Maker of Things, yet it does not call it \"naturally so.\" It says that when people cannot hold fast to the Dao, they produce many grotesqueries, as if ghosts and spirits made them so. Those who read the *Zhuangzi* must recognize this carefully.\n\nDay and night succeed one another before us, yet none know where they sprout. \"Enough! Enough!\"—like the modern saying, \"That’s it, that’s it,\" meaning that though the source of sprouting is unknowable, between dawn and dusk one attains only this. *This* refers to the Maker of Things. This *this* carries great weight and is not lightly placed. *Without that, there is no I*—this *that* refers back to the previous *this*, meaning that without the Maker of Things, I could not be thus. Yet the Maker of Things’ actions are only seen through the human body, hence \"without me, there is nothing to take.\" Though this explanation seems close and visible, what it reveals of the Maker of Things is still not known by people. Thus it is said, \"this is also near, yet one does not know what compels it.\" The *true master*—the Maker of Things—seems as if it exists, yet one dare not assert its actual presence. *Lián* (联) is the place of sprouting; not grasping its *lián* is to not know where it sprouts. *Kě xíng* (可行) refers to what is visible in the workings of Heaven. *Yǐ xìn* (已信) means \"most assuredly.\" The actions of the Maker of Things are indeed thus, yet its form is unseen—this is \"not knowing what compels it.\" *Yǒu qíng* (有情) means \"having reality,\" the same as *yǐ xìn*. *Wú xíng* (无形) means \"formless,\" the same as \"not seeing its form.\" From \"day and night succeed one another\" onward, all speak of the actions of the Maker of Things, which, though before our eyes, are unseen by people. The text circles back repeatedly, weaving many phrases, its words earnest and its meaning profound, urging people to reflect deeply and examine themselves.\n\nThe hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all contained within. With whom do I share intimacy? Do you delight in all of them? Or is there a private favor? Are they all like servants and concubines? Are these servants and concubines insufficient to govern one another? Do they take turns being lord and subject? Is there a true ruler residing within? If one seeks to grasp its reality, whether one succeeds or not, does it harm or benefit the true?\n\nThe hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera are all that a person’s body possesses. What follows further elucidates a passage from the perspective of the human body, which is even more extraordinary. *Gāi* (赅) means \"complete,\" and *cún* (存) means \"present.\" It says that all these are complete and present within a person’s body. *With whom do I share intimacy?* asks: with whom do I alone share closeness? This *intimacy* is placed with great reason. For example, if one’s hand is afflicted by illness and suffers, then at that moment the hand becomes the body’s enemy. The six senses are all like this. *Do you delight in all of them?* asks whether one delights in all the six senses, or whether there is a private favor. Moreover, in the body’s functions, which is noble and which is base? When the head itches and the hand scratches, the hand serves the head. When one gazes afar and the feet walk, the feet serve the eyes. The servant is like a minister or concubine. Yet they are *insufficient to govern one another*—the hands, feet, ears, eyes, nose, and tongue all serve one another. The one that is served is the lord, and the one that serves is the subject. At times the feet are used, and at times the hands are used. Thus it is said, \"they take turns being lord and subject.\" Since the lord and subject of the hundred bones, nine orifices, and six viscera cannot be definitively named, then is the heart the lord of the body? Yet the heart cannot govern itself, and what governs it is the Maker of Things—thus the Maker of Things is the true ruler. Hence it is said, \"Is there a true ruler residing within?\" Though I seek thus to investigate and reach the truth, whether I grasp it or not, how does it add to or diminish the so-called ruler? *Qíng* (情) means \"reality.\" Thus it is said, \"If one seeks to grasp its reality, whether one succeeds or not, does it harm or benefit the true?\"\n\nOnce one receives this completed form, it does not perish but awaits its end, clashing and grinding against things. Its course is spent like a galloping horse, yet none can halt it—is this not lamentable? Throughout life, one toils and toils without seeing success, wearily laboring without knowing where to return—can this not be grieved? People call this \"not dying,\" but what is the benefit? The body transforms, the heart follows it—can this not be called great sorrow? Is human life inherently so confused? Am I alone confused while others are not?\n\nGenerally, the human form is not self-possessed; it must be received from something. Having received this form from the Maker of Things, the Maker of Things and I remain together, not perishing until this form is exhausted. Yet people cannot wholly follow the Maker of Things; they are instead drowned by external things, now opposing, now following them. Thus they spend their lives, like a colt passing a crack, unable to rest even for a moment. Hence it is said, \"its course is spent like a galloping horse, yet none can halt it.\" *Xiāng rèn* (相刃) means opposing, and *xiāng mǐ* (相靡) means following—both convey the sense of being drowned. *Zhōngshēn yìyì* (终身役役) means self-affliction. *Not seeing success* means no benefit. The saying \"gathering a hundred flowers to make honey, yet not knowing for whom the sweetness is toiled\" expresses this idea. *Túrán pírù* (荼然疲役) further depicts the laborious toil of *yìyì*, not knowing where to return, not knowing when rest may come. Human life’s self-inflicted labor is thus. Though one may live a hundred years, what is the benefit? Hence it is said, \"not dying, what is the benefit?\" *Its form transforms*—from decline to graying, from graying to aging. As years grow higher, virtue grows more distant. This is the body transforming while the heart does not. With no insight of my own, I merely serve the body with the heart. When the body declines, the heart also wearies.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"The heart consents to this\"—*mángmángrán* (芒芒然), utterly without insight. Even those foolish and deluded should turn back and ask themselves: in the lives of all people, is the heart originally so benighted, so devoid of understanding? Am I alone benighted while others possess clarity? This is to say: Heaven gives birth to the teeming masses, endowing them with things and with principles. The people’s constant nature cherishes fine virtue; the heavenly principle has never been obscure. Yet you, clouded by human desire, have come to this. How could one who knows the Dao be so dim and dull? This is what is meant by \"the golden needle scraping the film\"—it urges you to open your eyes.\n\nNow, if one follows the \"completed heart\" as one’s teacher, who is there who does not have a teacher? Why must one know the ancients before the heart can make its own judgments? The foolish share in this as well. To have likes and dislikes before the heart is formed—this is like saying, \"Today I set out for Yue, yet I arrived there yesterday.\" Thus, to take what does not exist as existing—even if the divine Yu were here, he could not comprehend it. How much less could I?\n\nThe \"completed heart\" is possessed by all. This heart is the heavenly principle, vast and undifferentiated, yet lacking in nothing. It is said: at birth, you are already endowed with a fully formed heavenly principle. If you take this as your teacher, who is without it? Not only the worthy possess it; even the foolish do. *Zhī dài* (知代) refers to the worthy of old—*dài* (代) means transformation, speaking of their understanding of the principle of change. *Xīn zì qǔ* (心自取) means the heart has its own insights. If this heart has not yet perceived the undifferentiated principle but forcibly establishes judgments of right and wrong, it is like asserting that one has already arrived in Yue when one has only just set out today. Is there such a principle in the world? This is to insist on what one does not know as if one knew it. Thus, having no true insight, one insists on having it. Even if the ancient sages were to return, they could not enlighten you—how much less could others?\n\nSpeech is not like the wind. Speakers have words, yet what they say is not fixed. Is it truly speech? Or has there never been speech at all? Does it differ from the chirping of a fledgling? Or is there no difference? This chapter, being a discourse on the equalization of things and the resolution of right and wrong, first sets forth the theory of the three winds, stating that all sounds in heaven and earth arise from the Creator. It then expands upon this, explaining that the body is likewise moved by the Creator, unfolding the idea until it reaches the \"completed heart,\" where it pauses. From this point onward, it discusses the theory of right and wrong. The wind through hollows, the sound of bamboo—though myriad sounds differ, they are all merely sounds. Only when sound forms patterns is it called speech, and speech is not like the wind. What is called speech is each person speaking their own intent. Thus it is said, \"Speakers have words\"—these four characters encapsulate the discourse on right and wrong. What they say is not yet fixed. Though you may speak, is it truly your own speech, or is it the Creator speaking through you? Hence it is said to be \"not yet fixed.\"\n\nIs it truly your speech? Or have you never had such speech, and it is the Creator moving you to speak? A *kòu* (鷇) is a bird newly hatched from its egg. Its chirping is without understanding. Your speech is likewise without self-awareness. If you believe it differs from the chirping of a fledgling, can you truly distinguish it? Or is there no distinction? In truth, they are one and the same, beyond differentiation.\n\nWhere does the Dao reside that it has truth and falsehood? Where does speech reside that it has right and wrong? Where does the Dao go that it does not remain? Where does speech remain that it cannot be spoken of? The Dao is obscured by petty accomplishments; speech is obscured by flourishing embellishments. Thus arise the right and wrong of the Confucians and Mohists, each affirming what the other denies and denying what the other affirms. If you wish to affirm what they deny and deny what they affirm, nothing is better than illuminating that things have no \"other,\" that things have no \"this.\" From the perspective of the other, one does not see; through self-knowledge, one knows. Thus it is said: \"The other emerges from the this; the this also follows from the other.\"\n\nThe Dao originally has no truth or falsehood—how could it become obscured and give rise to such distinctions? Speech originally has no right or wrong—how could it become obscured and give rise to such disputes? Where does it go that it does not remain? This refers to the great and small, the refined and coarse—is the Dao not present in these? Where does it remain that it cannot be spoken of? This refers to affirming affirmations and negating negations—all are acceptable. *Xiǎochéng* (小成) means a narrow view, a one-sided perspective. Only after people’s partial views arise does the Dao become obscured and unclear. *Rónghuá* (荣华) means self-aggrandizement in pursuit of fame and reputation. Partial views, when self-aggrandized, obscure the truest speech. Only after this do the Confucians and Mohists begin their disputes over right and wrong. What one denies, I affirm; what one affirms, I deny. How can this be settled? If one wishes to settle right and wrong, one must return to the natural heavenly principle—only then can it be made clear. The heavenly principle is clarity itself.\n\nThus it is said: nothing is better than illuminating that things have no \"other,\" that things have no \"this.\" To say \"from my perspective, this is right\" is to say \"from the other’s perspective, this is wrong.\" To say \"I take this as right\" is to say \"others take it as wrong.\" From the other’s perspective, I do not see; through self-knowledge, I know. Things and I do not oppose each other—thus there is no right, no wrong. Only when things and I oppose each other do right and wrong arise. Thus it is said: \"The other emerges from the this; the this also follows from the other.\" This is the theory of \"this and other arising simultaneously.\" Though it speaks of simultaneous arising, it introduces the term *fāngshēng* (方生, \"just arising\") as a metaphor. For arising must entail perishing; the two cannot be separated. To speak only of arising without speaking of perishing is to see only one side. Though you may see only one side, in principle, they cannot be separated. If there is arising, there must be perishing; if there is perishing, there must be arising. If there is \"can,\" there must be \"cannot\"; if there is \"cannot,\" there must be \"can.\" How can they be separated? Knowing that their theories cannot be separated, it is better to affirm what they affirm and deny what they deny.\n\nThe sages of old, not relying on one-sided views but illuminating with the heavenly principle, simply followed what was right. Earlier, it spoke of following both right and wrong; here, it speaks only of following right—this is an abbreviation.",

      "translated_text": "Is is that, and that is is. That too has its right and wrong, and this too has its right and wrong—can there truly be \"that\" and \"this\"? Or can there truly be no \"that\" and \"this\"? Where \"that\" and \"this\" find no counterpart, this is called the *pivot of the Dao*. Only when one attains the pivot and stands at the center of the ring can one respond to the inexhaustible. This too is inexhaustible, and that too is inexhaustible—thus it is said: \"Nothing compares to clarity.\"\n\nIf we debate right and wrong, then their theories each have their own right and wrong, and my theories too have their own right and wrong. How then do I differ from them? Though you distinguish between self and other, in truth, they cannot be separated. Thus it is asked: Can there truly be \"that\" and \"this\"? Or can there truly be no \"that\" and \"this\"? To say that \"that\" and \"I\" are both nothing is to speak of counterparts. If \"that\" and \"I\" do not stand in opposition but merge into one, this is the pivotal essence of the Dao. The center of a ring must be empty. If I grasp the pivotal essence of the Dao, I then begin to resemble the center of a ring. Like the center of a ring, there is no end and no beginning—it is inexhaustible. That \"this is inexhaustible\" and \"that is inexhaustible\" means to follow what is natural. In this way, one accords with the heavenly principle of nature. Thus it is said: \"Nothing compares to clarity.\" The preceding sentence is cited here to conclude this passage.\n\nTo use a finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger is not as good as using a non-finger to illustrate that a finger is not a finger. To use a horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse is not as good as using a non-horse to illustrate that a horse is not a horse. Heaven and earth are one finger; the myriad things are one horse.\n\nA finger is a finger. If I take my finger to be a finger, then I take another’s finger to be not a finger. Yet that person, who is not me, takes my finger to be not a finger. If I merely take myself as right and others as wrong, it would be better to reflect on this from their perspective. If things and I stand in opposition, then right and wrong cannot be settled. The counting rods in *bo* and *sai* are like this—see the *Record of Rites*, \"Touhu\" chapter. The \"horses\" (rods) vary in number, and the players’ judgments of right and wrong vary accordingly. If we apply this principle by analogy, then heaven’s duty to cover and earth’s duty to bear can also be disputed from one-sided views. The myriad things differ—those that fly, those that walk, those that move, those that are rooted—just as the counting rods differ, and they too can be disputed from one-sided views. This illustrates that in the world, there is no fixed right and wrong. It is only because there is self and other that there is right and wrong. Can heaven and earth be divided into self and other? All these analogies show that things cannot be judged unequally.\n\nIs it acceptable? Is it unacceptable? That which is called acceptable is what things naturally become; that which is called so is what things naturally are. How is it so? It is so in being so. How is it not so? It is not so in not being so. Things inherently have what they are; things inherently have what they accept. Nothing is not so; nothing is unacceptable. What is acceptable is accepted; what is unacceptable is not accepted. Thus it is said: Is it acceptable? Is it unacceptable? That which the Dao deems fine or coarse, when put into practice, all become natural. What is called \"so\" is simply what is spoken of. What do I take as so? I take as so what is inherently so. What do I take as not so? I take as not so what is inherently not so. Things inherently have what they are—this is their original nature. It is said: \"Things inherently have what they are; things inherently have what they accept.\" Since there is what they are and what they accept, all things are like this. Thus it is said: Nothing is not so; nothing is unacceptable.\n\nTherefore, consider the examples of the stalk and the pillar, the ugly and the beautiful, the vast and the narrow, the deceptive and the straightforward, the strange and the auspicious. The stalk is a roof beam; the pillar is a house column. The beam is horizontal, the column vertical; the ugly is vile, the beautiful is fair. The vast and the narrow, the deceptive and the constant, the cunning and the honest, the monstrous and the auspicious—all differ. Yet from the perspective of the Dao, the horizontal and vertical each serve their purpose, the beautiful and the ugly each fulfill their nature, and all can be united as one. This means all return to the Creator.\n\nTheir division is their formation; their formation is their destruction. All things, without formation or destruction, return to unity. Formation and destruction are opposed to each other in things. Yet without destruction, there is no formation; without formation, there is no destruction. For example, a tree in the mountains is felled and used—this is destruction. When used to build a house, it becomes formation. Another example: herbs are prepared by cutting and grinding—this is division. When combined and harmonized, they become medicine. The sinew and horn must be present to make a bow—when in the bow, it is formation; when in the sinew and horn, it is destruction. If the Qin did not fall, the Han would not rise. Though the Han was formed, the Qin was destroyed. Viewed thus, there was originally no formation and no destruction. Thus it is said: They return to unity.\n\nOnly those who comprehend this know that unity is the Way. For this reason, they do not employ it but lodge it in the ordinary. The ordinary is use; use is penetration; penetration is attainment. When one attains and approaches the subtlest point, following this and stopping without knowing why—this is called the Dao.\n\nOnly those who comprehend the Dao know that this principle is one. They discard their assertions of right, do not employ them, but lodge them in the ordinary, using the constant. When all uses are penetrated, one naturally attains. Thus it is said: The ordinary is use; use is penetration; penetration is attainment. When one attains and approaches the subtlest point—this too means nothing more than following this without contention over right and wrong. Only when one no longer knows why but follows nature—this is called the Dao. The word \"already\" in the following sentence connects to the \"already\" in the preceding sentence—this is a playful flourish in the author’s brushwork.\n\nTo exhaust one’s spirit in forcing unity without knowing their sameness—this is called \"morning three.\" What is \"morning three\"? A monkey keeper distributed chestnuts, saying, \"Three in the morning and four in the evening.\" All the monkeys were angry. He then said, \"Then four in the morning and three in the evening.\" All the monkeys were pleased. The names and realities had not changed, yet joy and anger were employed—this too is following \"this.\" Therefore, the sage harmonizes with right and wrong and rests in the equality of heaven. This is called \"walking two paths.\"",

      "translated_text": "The ancients’ knowledge reached its utmost—how far did it reach? There were those who regarded all as never yet having been things: this was the ultimate, the utmost, beyond which nothing could be added. Next were those who regarded things as existing yet never yet having boundaries. Next were those who regarded boundaries as existing yet never yet having right and wrong. The manifestation of right and wrong is the diminution of the Dao. The diminution of the Dao is the completion of attachment. Is there truly completion and diminution? Or is there truly neither completion nor diminution?\n\nThat which has never yet been a thing is the beginning of the Supreme Ultimate. The \"ancients\" here refer to those who understood the Dao: when viewed from the beginning of no-thing, the principles of the world reach their extremity. The next stage, regarding things as existing, is the Supreme Ultimate emerging from the Limitless. From the existence of things to the existence of boundaries is the Supreme Ultimate dividing into the Two Modes. Though the Two Modes are divided—one covering, one bearing, each following its own principle—when has there ever been right and wrong? Right and wrong arise from the private biases of the human heart, their manifestation. Once private bias is revealed, the natural Dao is diminished. When the Dao is diminished, there is liking and disliking: what is within me is love, what is in things is aversion—what the Buddhists call the \"river of attachment.\" Diminishing the Dao and drowning in attachment is but the work of private bias in the human heart.

      "translated_text": "Ah! These words speak to how all disputes over right and wrong in the human world ultimately return to emptiness. Though this passage begins with the origins of Heaven and Earth, the principle it guards against is present before our very eyes. For instance, when a single thought has yet to arise, it is as if we stand at the time before things came to be. Once that thought arises, things come into existence, and with things, the self emerges—thus, boundaries are drawn. From these boundaries of self and things arise likes and dislikes, joy and anger, sorrow and delight—thus, right and wrong are born. If one cannot turn back and reflect on the moment before thought arose, then all one sees is the turmoil churning in the breast, the Dao diminished and attachment formed. Yet when this thought passes, all returns to tranquility—how then can there be completion or diminution?\n\nZhuangzi’s words may seem distant and impractical, but if one can truly embody this understanding, it becomes a matter of immediate, personal experience. There is completion and diminution, and so Zhaoshi plays the zither. There is neither completion nor diminution, and so Zhaoshi does not play the zither. Zhaowen’s zither-playing, Shikuang’s striking of the clappers, Huizi’s leaning on the catalpa table—these three men’s wisdom was nearly perfect in their arts, and thus their deeds were recorded in their later years. Yet it was only because they cherished their skills, setting themselves apart from others, that they sought to make them known. What they sought to illuminate was not inherently obscure, yet they insisted on clarifying it, and so they ended their lives entangled in the obscurities of \"hard and white.\" Their sons, inheriting their fathers’ legacies, likewise spent their lives without completion. Can this truly be called completion? Even I, too, would be complete. If this cannot be called completion, then neither things nor I attain completion.\n\nThus, the dazzling confusion of slippery doubt is what the sage seeks to resolve. To refrain from using it and instead lodge it in the ordinary—this is called \"illuminating through non-illumination.\"\n\nHaving expounded the principle of completion and diminution, he turns to the analogy of zither-playing, which is most intimate and apt. Consider a zither before you: if you play it, a melody unfolds with a clear beginning and end—this beginning and end arise only after the zither is played. If it is not played, how can there be beginning or end? It is the same with a single thought in a person: if it does not arise, there is no distinction between self and things.\n\nZhao was the surname; Wen was the given name of an ancient master of the zither. Shikuang was a music master. *Ce* refers to an object used to strike musical instruments; today, a horsewhip is also called a *ce*. In the *Zuozhuan*, Rao Chao gifts one as a *ce*, and Yang Tan strikes the West Gate with a *ce*—both are horsewhips. *Zhi* means \"to hold\"; to hold and strike is called *zhi*. These two characters likely existed in ancient speech. \"Shikuang *zhi ce*\" thus means Shikuang striking a musical instrument. *Ju wu* means leaning on a catalpa table, using it as a rest. Following the mention of zither-playing, he brings up these two figures. The three men’s skills were nearly perfected—this speaks to their wisdom being fully realized in their arts. Their techniques were refined, and they gained great renown in the world, hence \"all were at their peak.\" *Zai* means \"to engage in\"; *mo nian* means \"later years.\" This speaks to dedicating their lives to their arts.\n\nThe three men cherished their skills, believing themselves distinct from others in the world, hence \"only because they cherished them, setting themselves apart.\" Having cherished them, they then sought to display them to others, hence \"their cherishing of them.\" They wished to make them known, yet those who heard them already understood, and they insisted on clarifying what was not obscure—hence \"what they sought to illuminate was not inherently obscure, yet they insisted on illuminating it.\" This is like Huizi’s stubborn arguments, which only served to obscure. The \"hard and white\" refers to Gongsun Long’s debate, though Zhuangzi attributes it to Huizi, merely borrowing the name of the \"hard and white\" distinction. *Mei* means \"self-delusion.\" The above speaks of the three men, but here he concludes with Huizi’s arguments—this is a matter of literary structure.\n\nCommentators on \"hard and white\" take it as the debate over a hard stone and a white horse: to say \"hard\" is to speak of stone, but one need not say \"hard\" to speak of stone; to say \"white\" is to speak of a horse, but one need not say \"white\" to speak of a horse—just as \"yellow horse\" and \"black ox\" are three things. Another note in the *Records of the Grand Historian* on Su Qin’s biography says: when Longquan water tempers a sword, it becomes hard and sharp, hence the debate over \"hard and white.\" It says: yellow is for hardness, white is for sharpness. The Qi debaters countered: white is not hard, yellow is not sharp. Though the two explanations differ, both are the work of debaters.\n\nZhaowen spent his life playing the zither, and his son, inheriting his legacy, likewise spent his life continuing the art. *Lun* means \"legacy.\" Above, he speaks of Huizi, and in the next sentence, he concludes with Zhaowen’s son—this is where the brush dances. \"Spent their lives without completion\" means they only guarded their own skills, preventing others from attaining them, hence \"without completion.\" For all things under Heaven, if one relies on one’s abilities and deems them sufficient, then one’s present abilities can be called sufficient. But if one’s present abilities are not sufficient, then no one under Heaven, including oneself, can be called sufficient. *Cheng* means \"sufficient.\"\n\nThough these two sentences conclude the discussion of the three men’s skills, their meaning is vast. The three men’s skills are but metaphors for the debates over things and right and wrong—they are not solely about the three men. *Hua yi* means \"indistinct and unclear\"; *hua* is confusion, and *yi* is doubt, appearing clear yet not clear. *Yao* means \"bright.\" The sage’s mind does not cling to traces, and what it perceives is as if present, as if absent. *Tu* means \"to desire\"—this speaks to what the sage desires. Thus, he discards the \"this\" and does not employ it, lodging it instead in the ordinary—this is called \"illuminating through non-illumination.\"\n\nFrom \"things are not other than that\" to \"not one, not inexhaustible,\" he explains the phrase \"illuminating through non-illumination.\" From \"using the finger to illustrate the finger\" to \"attaining it and nearly succeeding,\" he explains the phrase \"because of this.\" Then, returning directly to this point, he concludes with \"this is called illuminating through non-illumination.\" The structure of the text rises and falls, shifting and turning, yet its guiding threads remain clear.\n\nI have often said that the *Qiwulun* is a single, unbroken piece of writing—if one examines its words and veins closely, one can see this. Now, suppose there is a statement here: how can one know whether it aligns with \"this\" or not? Whether it aligns with \"this\" or not, if both alignment and non-alignment are taken as \"this,\" then they are no different from \"that.\" This passage arises from the phrase \"not using this.\" Hence, he asks: does it align with \"this\"? Does it not align with \"this\"? This is the vein of his words. Earlier, he said, \"Words are not mere blowing,\" and here, shifting his tone, he declares: \"Now, suppose there is a statement here.\" This, too, is the vein running through the text. For if one swaps the positions of \"this\" and \"not this,\" one sees that \"this\" and \"not this\" are both \"this.\" His meaning is: if one takes \"that\" as \"this\" and \"this\" as \"that,\" one sees that \"this\" and \"that\" are the same. This is the meaning of \"using the finger to illustrate the finger, using the horse to illustrate the horse.\"",

Or is there truly neither completion nor diminution?",

      "translated_text": "Though this be so, let us attempt to speak of it. There is \"having a beginning\"; there is \"not yet having had a beginning\"; there is \"not yet having had that which has not yet had a beginning.\" There is \"having\"; there is \"non-being\"; there is \"not yet having had non-being\"; there is \"not yet having had that which has not yet had non-being.\" Suddenly, there is being and non-being—but who can truly say which is being and which is non-being? Now, I have already made a statement, yet I do not know whether what I have called it is truly a statement or truly not a statement.\n\nThough Zhuangzi’s prose here takes a turn, his words remain wondrous. His meaning is: though one may say there is no \"this\" and no \"that,\" let us still try to speak of it. Thus, he says: \"Let us attempt to speak of it.\" \"Having a beginning\" is the Supreme Ultimate; \"not yet having had a beginning\" is the Ultimate of Non-being; \"not yet having had that which has not yet had a beginning\" is yet another layer beyond the Ultimate of Non-being. \"Having\" is the existence of things. This arising of existence must begin from non-being, hence \"non-being.\" Above this \"non-being\" is \"not yet having had non-being,\" another layer beyond the Ultimate of Non-being. This aligns with what *Liezi* calls the Great Material, the Great Simplicity, and the Great Beginning. Originally, there was no \"having,\" and not only was there no \"having,\" there was not even \"non-being.\" Suddenly, there arose \"non-being,\" and from this, \"having\" must emerge. Pushing this reasoning forward, his meaning is: originally, there was nothing at all. Only with the arising of the self do things come to be; only with the arising of things does the self come to be, and only then do \"this\" and \"that\" emerge. The general thrust is no more than this, yet his exposition is so lofty and subtle.\n\nHere, it would be fitting to say, \"Suddenly, there is being,\" but instead, he says, \"Suddenly, there is being and non-being.\" This is where his brushwork enters the realm of the wondrous. Though this \"non-being\" has arisen, can it truly be called \"non-being\"? Thus, he asks: who can truly say which is being and which is non-being? Though this \"non-being\" remains unknowable, once it is called \"non-being,\" it has already acquired the name of non-being. Thus, he says: \"Now, I have already made a statement.\" Yet though I have made this statement—this \"speaking\"—I do not know whether this statement is truly a statement or truly not a statement. This is akin to the passage on the fledgling’s cry: \"Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small; none is shorter-lived than a child who dies young, yet Pengzu is long-lived. Heaven and earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one. Since we are already one, how can there be speech?

      "translated_text": "Moreover, can there be no speech? One and speech make two; two and one make three. From this onward, even the most skillful mathematician cannot reckon, let alone the common person. Thus, from non-being proceeding to being, reaching three—how much more so from being proceeding to being? There is no proceeding at all. This is simply following what is.\n\nThese two lines, though presented as an analogy to clarify the principle of being and non-being, express the ultimate truth of all under heaven. Before Zhuangzi, no one had spoken thus; after Zhuangzi, no one has spoken thus. Truly, this is a singular insight spanning centuries. The tip of an autumn hair is most minute, yet it is called \"nothing greater\"; Mount Tai is most vast, yet it is called \"small.\" The intent here is that once named \"autumn hair,\" even if slightly larger, it can no longer be called \"autumn hair.\" Once named \"Mount Tai,\" even if slightly smaller, it can no longer be called \"Mount Tai.\" If Mount Tai is deemed great, yet heaven and earth are greater, then calling Mount Tai \"small\" is permissible. If \"child who dies young\" is a name, it denotes the utmost brevity of life; any longer, and it is no longer called a \"child who dies young.\" Though Pengzu is said to be long-lived, compared to heaven and earth, he is short-lived.\n\nExamining these two lines closely, one sees that if something can be called \"completed,\" then even I am completed. If it cannot be called \"completed,\" then things and I are without completion. If one guards against viewing it thus, then, vast as heaven and earth are, born together with me in the great void, they cannot be called great. And the myriad things, born together with me between heaven and earth—even a single blade of grass, a single tree, a single bird, a single insect—are all equal to me. Thus it is said: \"Heaven and earth were born together with me, and the myriad things and I are one.\" Having spoken of \"one,\" it then clings to this \"one,\" saying: \"Since we are already one, how can there be speech?\" The meaning is that if we are wholly undifferentiated as one, then even the word \"one\" should not exist. Yet since there is already the word \"one,\" how can it be said there is none? This undifferentiated \"one\" and this named \"one\" of speech are already two things. Thus, \"one and speech make two.\" Once there are these two, adding the phrase \"one and speech make two\" makes three. From these three, generation proceeds endlessly—from thousands to tens of thousands, from tens of thousands to trillions—until even the most skillful reckoner cannot exhaust them, let alone the common person.\n\nIf one views it thus, then initially, from the word \"non-being,\" speech arises, proceeding to being, from being to one, from one to two, from two to three. Once speech begins, how much more will being generate being without end? Observing this, only \"no proceeding\" is correct. What is meant by \"no proceeding\"? It is simply following what is.\n\nNow, the Dao has never had boundaries, and speech has never had constancy. To affirm \"this\" is to create divisions. Let us speak of these divisions: there is left and right, there are principles and duties, there are distinctions and debates, there are competitions and conflicts—these are called the eight virtues. This passage arises from the word \"this.\" Where there are boundaries, there is self and other; where there is constancy, there is a master. The ultimate Dao and ultimate speech originally have no self and other. It is due to the selfishness of the human heart that the word \"this\" arises, giving birth to many boundaries and divisions. The names of the eight virtues merely express the opposition of self and other, yet the text animates them with four pairs: left and right, opposing terms; principles (ethics) and duties (righteousness); distinctions and debates, both similar but with varying emphasis—once there is self and other, principles and affairs each have their own intent; competitions and conflicts, both of the same meaning, but competition is more intense than conflict. Once there are distinctions and debates, the greater must compete, and the lesser must contend.\n\nWhen reading such passages, if one merely skims the surface of the words, one may appear clever, but if one asks, \"What is ethics? What is duty? What is distinction? What is debate? What is competition? What is conflict?\"—then one has missed Zhuangzi’s intent. Moreover, the words for ethics, duty, distinction, debate, competition, and conflict have no great difference in themselves. How can they be named the \"eight virtues\"? Only by seeing through the text’s embellishments and not being confined by its rhetoric can one truly read Zhuangzi well. Even if Zhuangzi were to return to life, he would surely say, \"You possess a discerning eye.\"\n\nBeyond the six directions, the sage preserves but does not discuss; within the six directions, the sage discusses but does not debate. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* embodies the intent of the former kings to order the world; the sage debates but does not argue. Thus, where there are distinctions, there are also non-distinctions; where there is debate, there are also non-debates. Why is this? The sage cherishes them in secret, while the common people debate them to display to one another. Thus, it is said: \"Where there is debate, there is also non-perception.\"\n\nHaving already spoken of self and other, right and wrong, these several lines introduce another perspective to reveal the boundless clarity and freedom in this old man’s heart. \"Beyond the six directions\" refers to beyond heaven and earth—what the Buddhists call the four directions, above and below, beyond thought. \"Within the six directions\" refers to the cosmos. Within the cosmos, there are many principles; how could the sage not speak of them? Yet he does not establish debates to force understanding upon all under heaven. The *Spring and Autumn Annals* is the name of a historical record; this line means that all matters of ruler and subject, high and low recorded in history embody the intent of the former kings to order the world. How could the sage not establish debates? Yet how could he contend with the world over right and wrong? For the principles of all under heaven, silence is the ultimate speech; once distinctions and debates arise, it is because one’s own understanding is not thorough. Thus, it is said: \"Where there are distinctions, there are also non-distinctions; where there is debate, there are also non-debates.\"\n\nHere, another question arises: \"Why is this?\" \"Cherishing them\" means withdrawing and concealing them in secrecy. The sage rolls them up and cherishes them, while the common people must debate and clarify them to boast and display. Where there are distinctions and debates, there is a lack of insight. Thus, it is said: \"Where there is debate, there is also non-perception.\"\n\nThe great Dao is not called great; great eloquence does not speak; great benevolence is not benevolent; great integrity is not modest; great courage is not aggressive. The Dao, when illuminated, is not the Dao; speech, when debated, does not reach; benevolence, when constant, is not complete; integrity, when pure, is not trustworthy; courage, when aggressive, is not accomplished. These five, though round, nearly approach squareness.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, to know where to stop in what one does not know is the utmost. Who knows the eloquence of non-speech, the Dao of non-Dao? If one can know this, it is called the Heavenly Storehouse—poured into yet never full, drawn from yet never exhausted, and one knows not whence it comes. This is called preserving the light.\n\nTo those who would oppose it, it is said: if one names the great Dao, there are no oppositions. Within non-speech lies the most profound speech, hence it is said: \"Great eloquence does not speak.\" Only when no traces of benevolence remain does great benevolence arise. *Qian* (modesty) implies concealment—like a monkey hiding things, it is called *qian*. To take modesty as modesty is to harbor self-satisfaction. The *Guoyu* states: \"The virtue of *qianqian* is insufficient to achieve.\" Whether one fears others knowing or fears others not knowing, neither qualifies as great integrity.\n\n\"Not aggressive\" means no traces of courage are seen. Having explained these five phrases, another layer of interpretation follows: *Zhao* means illumination. The Dao cannot be pointed to and named; if it is illuminated and named, it is no longer the Dao. Thus, it is said: \"not the Dao.\" Speech, when shaped into debate, reveals where one’s understanding falls short. \"Constant\" refers to visible traces; where visible traces exist, benevolence is not fully realized. Integrity, when tainted by self-purification, is not sincere. *Qing* means self-purification; *xin* means sincerity. Courage, when manifested in aggression, must lose its true nature.\n\n\"Round\" means circular, indicating that these five are originally undifferentiated. If even slight traces appear, they approach the squareness of things—meaning they develop edges and corners. *Ji* means \"nearly\"; *xiang* shares the meaning of *yu* (toward).\n\nThe true knowledge of the world must reach the point where \"not knowing\" is knowing, and there it stops—this is the pinnacle of knowledge. \"Not knowing\" is the eloquence of non-speech; it is the Dao of non-Dao. If one can know this, one can perceive where Heaven’s principle is guarded. Thus, it is said: \"This is called the Heavenly Storehouse.\" The Heavenly Storehouse is where Heaven’s principle is guarded. Heaven’s principle cannot be added to, hence \"poured into yet never full\"; it cannot be diminished, hence \"drawn from yet never exhausted.\" The subtlety of the supreme principle has no end or beginning, thus \"one knows not whence it comes.\" *Baoguang* is the radiance of elusive brilliance—*bao* means to conceal, to hide one’s light without revealing it, hence \"preserving the light.\"\n\nThus, in ancient times, Yao asked Shun: \"I wish to attack Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao, yet when I face south, I feel unsettled. What is the reason?\" Shun replied: \"Those three rulers still exist among the weeds and brambles. Why are you unsettled? In ancient times, ten suns appeared together, and all things were illuminated—how much more so for the advance of virtue?\" The word *zhe* (者) above \"in ancient times\" indicates this is cited from the preceding text.\n\nThe affairs of Zong, Kuai, and Xu’ao are not recorded in the classics; they are likely allegorical. \"Unsettled\" means displeased. \"Among the weeds and brambles\" metaphorically describes being obscured by desires, unaware of heaven and earth. It suggests that those three states, self-obscured by desires, have not turned toward transformation, and if I feel displeased, then subject and object remain opposed. The tale of the ten suns also appears in the *Huainanzi*; this is likely a parable from Zhuangzi, which the *Huainanzi* later embellished. It means that the sun illuminates all things without exception—how much more should my virtue, surpassing the sun, tolerate these three? This implies that the sage’s refusal to debate right and wrong is to illuminate them with Heaven.\n\nThe saying of the ten suns is akin to the metaphor of \"illuminating with brightness.\" Nie Que asked Wang Ni: \"Do you know what all things agree upon as right?\" Wang Ni replied: \"How would I know?\" \"Do you know what you do not know?\" \"How would I know?\" \"Then do things have no knowledge?\" \"How would I know? Nevertheless, let me try to speak: How do I know that what I call knowing is not not-knowing? How do I know that what I call not-knowing is not knowing?\"\n\nThis passage arises from \"knowing where to stop in what one does not know,\" expanding upon the earlier \"is\" (*shi* 是). The entire essay is a single, continuous text. Nie Que’s question about agreement and Wang Ni’s response of not knowing exemplify knowing where to stop in what one does not know. The invented names and lively expressions are characteristic of Zhuangzi. Though he says, \"How would I know?\" he then adds, \"Nevertheless, let me try to speak\"—these are masterful turns of phrase. \"Knowing is not not-knowing; not-knowing is not knowing\" brilliantly develops the idea of knowing where to stop in what one does not know, for its meaning suggests that not-knowing is true knowledge.\n\nMoreover, let me ask you: When people sleep in damp places, they develop lower back pain and partial paralysis—is this so? When monkeys live in trees, they tremble with fear—is this so? Of these three, which knows the proper place to dwell? People eat the flesh of livestock; deer eat grass; centipedes delight in snakes; owls and crows relish mice. Of these four, which knows the proper taste? Monkeys and apes mate with female monkeys; deer consort with deer; loaches swim with fish. Mao Qiang and Li Ji are considered beautiful by people, yet when fish see them, they dive deep; when birds see them, they fly high; when deer see them, they flee swiftly. Of these four, which knows the true beauty of the world? From my perspective, the beginnings of benevolence and righteousness, the paths of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could I know their distinctions?\n\nMoreover, let me ask you...",

Yet each finds ease in its own place of ease, and none can find ease in what is not its place of ease—thus, of these three, none truly knows the proper place. How then could humans be any different from apes or loaches?\n\nGrass and wood are the food of livestock, while meat is the food of humans. *Jian* is grass; *dai* is snake. Deer eat grass, centipedes eat snakes, owls and crows eat mice, and humans eat livestock—each finds its own taste sweet and fine, yet of these four, which truly knows the proper taste? *Biandan* and *gezang* are types of apes. Apes mate with apes, deer consort with deer, and loaches swim with fish. Yet when it comes to Mao Qiang and Li Ji, whom humans deem beautiful, fish dive deep at the sight of them, birds take flight, and deer flee swiftly. Of these four, which truly knows the world’s true beauty?\n\nSwift and sudden—such is their flight. These three passages all serve as metaphors for right and wrong, self and other, thus concluding: from my perspective, the distinctions of benevolence and righteousness, the debates of right and wrong, are tangled and confused—how could one possibly discern their order?\n\n*Fan* means entangled, *yao* means mixed. Nie Que said, \"If you do not know benefit and harm, does the perfected person truly not know benefit and harm?\" Wang Ni replied, \"The perfected person is divine. When great marshes burn, they cannot be scorched; when the Milky Way freezes, they cannot be chilled; when thunder splits mountains and winds shake the seas, they cannot be startled. Such a one rides the clouds and qi, mounts the sun and moon, and roams beyond the four seas. Death and life bring no change to them—how much less the beginnings of benefit and harm?\" Wang Ni is the perfected person. *Divine* means their wonder pervades the ten thousand things without trace. Unscorched, unchilled, unstartled—this is to roam the mind in the beginning of nothingness. Even the great matters of death and life do not move their heart—how much less benefit, harm, right, and wrong? This sentence serves as a plain and solid conclusion.\n\nJu Quezi asked Chang Wuzi, \"I have heard from the Master that the sage does not engage in affairs, does not pursue benefit, does not avoid harm, does not delight in seeking, does not follow the Dao, is without words yet speaks, speaks yet is without words, and roams beyond the dust and grime. The Master considered these reckless words, but I believe they describe the wondrous practice of the Dao. What do you think?\" Chang Wuzi replied, \"Even the Yellow Emperor would be perplexed by such words—how could Confucius possibly understand them?\"\n\nThis further raises the question of the sage, critiquing the scholars of the Confucian school who busy themselves with affairs. *Does not engage in affairs* means not taking them to heart. To *pursue* or *avoid* is to know benefit and harm—if one does not know benefit and harm, what is there to pursue or avoid? *Seeking* refers to things that come to me, yet the sage does not delight in them. *Does not follow the Dao* means leaving no trace of practice. *Without words yet speaks* and *speaks yet is without words* refer to speech that is not speech. *Menglang* means unreal. *The Master* refers to Confucius. To say that the sage’s affairs are spoken of as the wondrous Dao, yet Confucius deemed them unreal—what do you think? *You* here refers to Chang Wuzi. *Ying* means clarity. Only the Yellow Emperor could listen and attain clarity—how could Confucius understand?\n\n\"You are far too hasty in your judgments—seeing an egg and demanding the crowing of the rooster at dawn, seeing a slingshot and craving a roasted owl. Let me speak to you recklessly, and you may listen recklessly—how about that? Why not embrace the sun and moon, clasp the cosmos to your bosom, and make them fit seamlessly? Set aside the murky and turbid, and with *you* as the measure, treat others with deference. The common people toil endlessly, while the sage appears foolish and dull, merging the myriad ages into a single completion. The ten thousand things are all complete, yet they encompass one another.\n\n*Far too hasty in your judgments* means your words are like this, yet you already deem them the wondrous practice of the Dao—this is seeing little and thinking much. The rooster has not yet hatched from the egg, yet you demand its crowing at dawn; you have not yet obtained the owl, yet you crave it roasted—this is the metaphor of hasty judgment. *I speak to you recklessly, and you listen recklessly*—how about that? *Recklessly* means not taking it as entirely true. *Why not embrace the sun and moon*—*pang* means to attach. *Clasp the cosmos*—the cosmos is held in one’s embrace. *Fit seamlessly* means to merge without gaps, as if the principle is naturally one. *Murky* means turbid, *turbid* means obscure. The turbid and obscure *you* of the human world, with which people defer to one another, are all set aside and unspoken. Scholars defer to great officers, great officers defer to ministers, ministers defer to rulers—each defers to the other, yet all claim superiority.

      "translated_text": "The \"weak loss\" refers to one who departs from their homeland in youth. To linger long in a foreign land and forget one’s native country—those who delight in life and dread death are much the same. Lady Li was a consort of Duke Xian of Jin. Captured from the state of Lirong (Li being the name of the Rong lands), she was called \"Li’s Consort.\" The *feng ren* (guardian of the borderlands) was an official charged with defending the frontiers. At first, leaving the Rong lands to come to Jin, she wept in sorrow; but once she attained nobility, sharing the duke’s bed and table, she came to regret her earlier tears. This serves as an analogy for life and death.\n\n\"One who dreams of drinking wine wakes to weep; one who dreams of weeping wakes to hunt\"—such sayings appear frequently in dream-divination texts. Between dream and waking, transformations unfold thus: while dreaming, one does not know it is a dream, and may even divine its meaning within the dream. Only upon waking does one realize that both the dream and its interpretation were but dreams. Such passages subtly capture the marvels of human nature. If one grasps this, then the exchange between Wei Jie’s question and Le Guang’s answer is seen as not yet penetrating deeply. This, too, is a matter of great consequence in learning. If Le Guang’s explanation holds, then what of King Gaozong’s dream of obtaining Fu Shuo, or Confucius’ dream of the Duke of Zhou?

      "translated_text": "The \"Heavenly Boundary\" is the earlier \"Heavenly Equilibrium.\" What does it mean to harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary? It means: \"Is it so? Is it not so? So or not so?\" If something is truly so, then how does it differ from not being so? There would be no need for debate. If something is truly so, then how does it differ from not being so? Again, there would be no need for debate. The mutual dependence of transformative voices—if they do not oppose one another, they harmonize with the Heavenly Boundary, following it in boundless unfolding, thus exhausting the years. Forgetting the years, forgetting righteousness, one rouses oneself in the boundless—thus dwelling in the boundless. This is the boundary of distinction, the Heavenly Boundary. The reason it harmonizes is simply this: \"is\" and \"is not,\" \"so\" and \"not so\"—both are preserved. This is the earlier \"walking two paths.\" The moment one takes something to be so, the moment one takes it to be right, then \"not so\" and \"not right\" arise, giving rise to disputes over right and wrong. These are mere words—transformative voices, meaning the use of language to persuade and submit. \"Mutual dependence\" means opposition, contention. If, in the midst of disputes over right and wrong, one stubbornly pits language against itself to seek persuasion, how is this like following what is so without contention? Thus it is said: \"if they do not oppose one another.\" These two characters, \"do not oppose,\" are most extraordinary—\"if they\" is akin to saying \"how is it like?\" Without opposition yet in accord, this is harmonizing with the Heavenly Boundary. One may roam freely, exhausting the years—thus it is said: \"following it in boundless unfolding, thus exhausting the years.\" \"Following\" means yielding; \"boundless unfolding\" means wandering freely. \"Exhausting the years\" is like Du Fu’s \"carefree passage of days and months.\" If one can do this, then not only can one exhaust the years, but one may even forget them. Not only forget the years, but even forget principles and righteousness. Having forgotten years and righteousness, one stirs and dances in the realm of nothingness—this \"stirs\" is the meaning of \"free and easy wandering.\" Wandering freely in the realm of nothingness, one’s entire life is then lodged in the realm of nothingness.\n\nThe shadow’s companion asked the shadow: \"Earlier you were moving, now you are still; earlier you were sitting, now you are rising—why are you so without constancy?\" The shadow replied: \"Do I depend on something to be thus? Does what I depend on also depend on something to be thus? Do I depend on the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada? How would I know why it is so? How would I know why it is not so?\" This passage arises from the word \"depend.\" The shadow’s companion is the faintest part of the shadow, without constancy—meaning it has no fixed measure. \"Do I depend on something to be thus?\" refers to the shadow’s movement, which depends on the form. Though I depend on the form, the form itself depends on something else—this is depending on the workings of creation. The form as form is no more than the scales of a snake or the wings of a cicada. Do I merely depend on them? The cicada and snake transform, yet their scales and wings remain—this is their molting. How can they move on their own? Since I depend on the form, and the form depends on something else, how can I know why it is so or not so? This is the metaphor for \"not depending on that.\"\n\nOnce, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly, fluttering happily—a butterfly indeed. He took pleasure in it, unaware that he was Zhou.",

      "translated_text": "Suddenly awake, he was Zhuang Zhou again—stiff and startled. Did Zhou dream he was a butterfly, or did the butterfly dream it was Zhou? Between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction. This is called the transformation of things.\n\nThis passage arises from the earlier dream sequence: the fluttering of the butterfly, the self-delight, the joy of following one’s will. In the dream, as the butterfly, he was so utterly content that he forgot his own self—hence \"unaware that he was Zhou.\" *Qúqú* describes the rigidity of waking, the sensation of lying stiff upon the bed. Here, the brushstrokes of Zhuangzi’s prose depict Zhou’s realization: last night’s butterfly was but a dream, yet now he fears the butterfly, over there, might take this waking moment for its own dream. Thus he asks: Did Zhou dream of the butterfly, or did the butterfly dream of Zhou? Between dream and waking, there must be a boundary—hence \"between Zhou and the butterfly, there must be a distinction.\" This line seems to conclude yet does not, leaving the matter unresolved, much like a Chan *huatou*, inviting the reader to investigate for themselves.\n\nThis is called the transformation of things—referring to the principle of the myriad things’ ceaseless change. The title of this chapter, \"Discourse on Making All Things Equal,\" culminates in these two metaphors, their language extraordinary, their meaning profound. One who awakens to this truth sees that there is no ground for disputing right and wrong, no change in life and death, let alone the entanglements of gain and loss.

      "translated_text": "**Zhuangzi Kouyi, Scroll Two**\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n\n**Third Inner Chapter: \"Nurturing the Life-Foundation\"**\n*\"Master\" here is akin to what Chan calls the \"host within\"; \"nurturing the master\" refers to what Daoists call the \"elixir foundation\" of this life.* First, the joy of roaming freely is spoken of; then, the state of being without right or wrong—this is the work of cultivating oneself. These three chapters seem to follow a sequence, yet what follows does not entirely adhere to it.\n\n*\"Our life has its limits, but knowledge is without bounds. To pursue the boundless with the bounded is perilous. And to be perilous in this pursuit—is this not danger enough?*\n*Limits* (涯) means boundaries; human life has its boundaries, its finite limits. *Knowledge* (知) is thought, the endless workings of the mind. To follow boundless thought with a finite body—endlessly restless, when will it cease? *Perilous* (殆已) speaks of its dreadfulness; *已* is a particle. The following *已* echoes the previous one, as in the *\"Equalizing Things\"* chapter. Amidst this peril, one still employs thought and calculation, believing oneself to be wise and capable—yet I see only that it ends in peril. The repetition of *殆* (peril) further emphasizes this, deeply warning later generations. This *殆* is the same as the *\"only peril\"* in the *Book of Documents*. *已而为知者* is like saying, \"clearly knowing, thus acting deliberately.\"\n\n*\"In doing good, avoid proximity to fame; in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment. Follow the central path as your guiding principle—thus can you preserve your body, fulfill your life, nurture your kin, and live out your years.\"*\nThese lines precisely expound Zhuangzi’s teachings on nurturing life, his own way of self-cultivation. *\"In doing good, avoid proximity to fame\"* means that if one acts virtuously yet avoids deeds that attract renown; *\"in doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment\"* means that if one commits wrongs, one avoids acts that incur penalties—this aligns with the *\"Webbed Toes\"* chapter’s *\"above, one dares not practice the conduct of benevolence and righteousness; below, one dares not engage in licentious and deviant acts.\"* *Supervisor* (督) means *urgency*—that is, responding only when pressed, acting only when unavoidable. Roaming the mind through this world, leaving no trace of good or evil, one simply follows the natural course of Heaven. Pressed, one responds; response arises without deliberation—this is the constant way. *Following* (缘) means compliance; *principle* (经) means constancy. Taking the meaning of *\"responding only when pressed\"* as one’s constant practice, one can preserve the body, fulfill the principle of life, filially nurture one’s parents, and live out one’s natural span—this is what Mencius meant by *\"whether long or short-lived, one does not waver, but cultivates oneself and awaits [Heaven’s decree].\"* Mencius speaks from the perspective of mind and nature, thus appearing solemn; this book speaks from the perspective of spontaneity, thus appearing carefree. Though their words differ, their intent in teaching people is the same.\n\nMaster Hui’an (Zhu Xi) glosses *督* as *\"center\"* but finds the phrasing of *\"avoid proximity to fame\"* and *\"avoid proximity to punishment\"* incomplete. He says: *\"If one fears the entanglements of fame and dares not fully exert one’s efforts in learning, one inclines toward evil. 'In doing evil, avoid proximity to punishment' suggests choosing evils that do not lead to criminal penalties, secretly committing them, and cunningly avoiding the consequences of punishment—this would make Zhuangzi a man of unscrupulousness.\"* Yet if one examines Zhuangzi’s phrasing and cross-references it with the *\"Webbed Toes\"* chapter, this interpretation does not hold. Though *督* can be glossed as *\"center,\"* it is better rendered as *\"urgency\"*—this aligns more precisely with the evidence in the text itself.\n\n*Cook Ding carved an ox for Lord Wenhui. Where his hand touched, where his shoulder leaned, where his foot stepped, where his knee pressed—all resounded with a crisp* 砉然 *and a smooth* 向然*. The blade sang* 騞然*, never failing to strike the right note, harmonizing with the dance of* Sanglin *and the rhythm of* Jingshou*.*\n*\"Ah!\" exclaimed Lord Wenhui, \"How excellent! How has your skill reached such heights?\"*\n*\"Where his hand touched\"* describes the movement of his hand; *\"where his shoulder leaned\"* refers to the tilt of his shoulder when applying force. *\"Where his foot stepped\"* describes the stance of his feet as he exerted himself, their placement naturally spaced. *\"Where his knee pressed\"* means his knees bent slightly as he leaned into the ox. These four lines depict the posture of a butcher at work. *砉然* (a crisp sound), *向然* (a smooth sound), and *騞然* (a ringing sound) all describe the sounds of his knife, with *\"wielding the blade\"* (奏刀) inserted in between—a matter of literary structure. This is like the *\"Seventh Month\"* poem: *\"In the eighth month, in the wilds; in the ninth month, at the eaves; in the tenth month, the crickets are beneath my bed\"*—where *\"crickets\"* is inserted in the middle. *奏刀* means advancing the blade; *\"never failing to strike the right note\"* means the sounds of *砉*, *向*, and *騞* all accorded with the musical modes. *Sanglin* and *Jingshou* are names of music; *dance* implies accompanying music, and *rhythm* (防) refers to the gathering of dancers. *\"Harmonizing with Sanglin\"* and *\"striking the rhythm of Jingshou\"* both describe how his movements matched the musical modes. *Lord Wenhui* is Lord Hui of Liang. *\"Ah!\"* is an exclamation of admiration.",

      "translated_text": "The skill has reached such heights—these words describe its marvel. Butcher Ding laid down his knife and replied: \"What your servant delights in is the Dao, which advances beyond mere skill. When I first began to dismember oxen, all I saw was nothing but oxen. After three years, I no longer saw whole oxen. To lay down the knife means to set it aside; that he spoke after setting it aside suggests his skill arose from learning the Dao, and thus his skill was no mere skill. After three years, he no longer saw whole oxen—this means that in the ox’s body, the places where it could be dismembered required no force and could be perceived at a glance.\n\nNowadays, I meet with it in spirit rather than seeing with my eyes; the senses’ knowing ceases, and the spirit’s desires proceed. I rely on the heavenly patterns, strike the great gaps, guide the blade through the great cavities, and follow what is inherently so. I have never touched the technical pathways or the binding joints—how much less the great bones! To meet with it in spirit rather than seeing with my eyes means the mind guards against it; *meeting* here means *guarding*. The senses are the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. That the senses’ knowing ceases means that when one stands in concentration, the ears and eyes perceive nothing. The knowing of the ears and eyes all ceases and does not proceed, while the spirit moves of itself—this means naturally and spontaneously. The *heavenly patterns* are the ox’s body’s natural textures. *Relying* means following its natural textures to dismember it. The *great gaps* are where flesh and bone meet; *striking* means to strike. The *cavities* are the great empty spaces between the joints; *guiding* means to follow and dismember. Where flesh and bone meet, where the joints have empty spaces—all are inherently so, and I merely follow them to dismember. In my skill, when using the knife, I have never once touched the binding joints. *Binding joints* (綮) is pronounced *qing*; they are where flesh adheres to bone. If even the binding joints are untouched by the knife, how much less the great bones! *Great bones* (軱) is pronounced *gū*.\n\nA good butcher changes his knife once a year—he cuts. An ordinary butcher changes his knife every month—he breaks it. Now my knife has been in use for nineteen years, having dismembered several thousand oxen, yet its edge is as if newly whetted. A *good butcher* is one skilled in butchery; an *ordinary butcher* is one among the common crowd, an inferior one. Inferior butchers change their knives every month because hacking at great bones damages or even breaks them. Good butchers change their knives once a year because their use of the knife still touches the binding joints, and cutting there may wear it down. But my knife has been in use for nineteen years, and though I have dismembered many oxen, its edge remains as if newly sharpened—this means it has suffered no damage. *Whetstone* (硎) is a grinding stone.\n\nWhere the joints have spaces and the knife’s edge has no thickness, to enter what has no thickness into what has spaces—how vast is the room for the blade to move! Thus, after nineteen years, the knife’s edge is as if newly whetted. *Where the joints have spaces* means the ox’s joints naturally have gaps; my knife is extremely thin. With such a thin knife, following the gaps to dismember, the blade can move freely within them. *How vast is the room* means there is no obstruction. This idea suggests that the difficulty or ease of worldly affairs all follows natural patterns. If I merely follow and proceed without clashing against them, my mind remains at peace, and thus nothing can harm my life—this is the method of nourishing life.\n\nYet whenever I come to where the sinews and bones are clustered, I see the difficulty and am startled into caution. My gaze lingers, my actions slow, and I move the knife with utmost care. Then, with a sudden *thwack*, it is dismembered, collapsing like earth to the ground. I raise the knife and stand, looking all around, then pause in satisfaction, wipe the knife clean, and put it away.\" Lord Wenhui said, \"Excellent! From Butcher Ding’s words, I have learned how to nourish life.\"\n\nThis *yet* is a turn with profound meaning. It suggests that in navigating the world, one cannot always encounter smooth circumstances; there are also times when adversity arises. One must then adapt and proceed with flexibility. In favorable circumstances, it is easy to act, but when facing adversity, one often becomes flustered and loses composure—how can one’s mind remain undisturbed?\n\nThus, this turn is added: *clustered* (族) means where sinews and bones gather. Though I say I no longer see whole oxen with my eyes, and though I use the knife only at the great gaps and cavities, when I come to where sinews and bones are tangled, I still find it difficult, treating it as a challenge. *Startled* (怵然) means a change in demeanor; *caution* means heightened vigilance. *My gaze lingers* means that with my eyes, I cannot help but pause briefly before proceeding slowly. *My actions slow* means I proceed with great care. Once I have taken care, I move the knife with utmost subtlety—this means lightly, without daring to apply much force. *Thwack* (謋) is pronounced *tè*; *dismembered* (解) is pronounced *xiè*. *Thwack* suggests suddenness; *dismembered* means to come apart. Though I apply little force, the bones and flesh suddenly separate, collapsing like earth to the ground—this means it is abundant and easy. After dismembering the ox, I raise the knife and stand, looking all around in leisure. *Pausing* (踌躇) means composure; it also means self-satisfaction. *Satisfaction* (满志) means contentment.",

      "translated_text": "It is not that his ambition is self-satisfied; rather, this means it fulfills my intent. Why is it as desired? Because I use no force in dismembering the ox, and though the ox is dismembered, the knife remains unharmed—this is why it is as desired. *\"To care for the knife\"* means to carefully put it away. This idea is a metaphor: when a person encounters adversity, they can respond with natural ease, keeping their mind undisturbed. Once the matter passes, they transform, and their body rests in non-action, as if nothing had ever occurred.\n\nThe following section, *\"To do good without seeking fame,\"* directly expounds the method of nurturing life. The passage about Pao Ding serves as its analogy, and here, at the end, it lightly concludes with *\"thus attaining the nurturing of life\"*—these four characters are where the momentum of the text is skillfully controlled, a point that must be examined closely.\n\nGongwen Xuan saw the Right Minister and was startled, saying: *\"What sort of man is this? Why is he so singular?\"* *\"Was this given by Heaven, or by man?\"* *\"By Heaven, not by man.\"* *\"Heaven’s creation made him thus, solitary; human appearance is shared, yet his is not. From this, we know it is Heaven’s doing, not man’s.\"*\n\nGongwen was his surname, Xuan his given name. The Right Minister was an official who had been punished by foot amputation. *\"Singular\"* (介) means alone; he retained only one foot. *\"Given by Heaven or by man?\"* means: was he born this way, or was he mutilated by man? Though the loss of a foot was clearly man’s doing, he said it was Heaven, not man. *\"Heaven’s creation made him thus, solitary\"* means that when Heaven created him, it intended for him to have only one foot. How do we know this? Because human appearance typically involves two feet walking side by side, yet his form stands apart from the multitude—this is Heaven’s design, not man’s. *\"Shared\"* (与) means paired. This idea suggests that in the world, excess and deficiency are all the work of creation; even what man does is ultimately the work of creation. Thus, when people encounter hardship, they should accept it with equanimity.\n\nThe marsh pheasant takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink. It does not wish to be kept in a cage; though its spirit may flourish, it is not content. The earlier discussion of accepting hardship with equanimity is like Pao Ding’s *\"each time I encounter a joint, I see the difficulty\"*—here, these lines borrow the marsh pheasant as a metaphor. They speak of human life in the world, where adversity is common, akin to treading on a tiger’s tail or walking within Yi’s drawn bow. The pheasant in the marsh takes ten steps for a single peck, a hundred steps for a single drink—this describes the difficulty of its sustenance. If kept in a cage, its food and drink would be abundant, yet the pheasant does not desire this. Thus, it is said: *\"It does not wish to be kept in a cage.\"* Why does it not wish this? Though the caged pheasant’s food and drink are plentiful, and its spirit may seem to flourish, it is ultimately not at ease. *\"Though its spirit may flourish, it is not content\"*—*\"flourish\"* is pronounced *wang*; *\"not content\"* means not joyful. This idea suggests that one who truly cherishes their life will not drown in the mundane world but will instead preserve their own integrity.\n\nWhen Lao Dan died, Qin Shi mourned him.

      "translated_text": "He replied: \"Indeed. At first, I took him for a true man, but now I see he was not. When I entered to offer condolences, I saw elders weeping for him as if for their own sons, and the young weeping as if for their own mothers. The reason they restrained themselves to speak or weep only when compelled was to flee from Heaven and betray their true nature, forgetting what they had received. The ancients called this 'the punishment of fleeing from Heaven.' Zhuangzi’s teachings derive from Laozi, and here he first disparages Laozi—this is but the groundwork for disparaging Yao, Shun, and the Confucians. As for me, I hold no partiality toward Laozi, let alone others.\n\n\"Three cries and then departure—this was an expression of unfeeling conduct. The disciple’s question implied that Laozi and Qin Shi were friends, so why did he mourn so unfeelingly? My answer refers to Qin Shi. 'At first, I took him for a true man'—I initially believed Laozi to be an extraordinary person. But upon offering condolences, I realized he was not. Why? When Laozi died, his disciples, young and old alike, wept with such sorrow. This must mean Laozi had not shed his worldly traces, and something in him moved his disciples’ hearts, so that their words and tears of grief and longing arose unbidden. What Heaven bestows is originally formless, yet if one is moved by emotion, it is to forget one’s original endowment and flee from Heaven’s principle, betraying one’s true nature. Such a one offends against Heaven, hence the term 'the punishment of fleeing from Heaven'—*bei* means 'to betray.'\n\n\"To come when it is time and to depart when it is fitting—this is to dwell in accord with the times and follow their course, so that sorrow and joy cannot enter. The ancients called this 'the untying of Heaven’s bonds.' Having discussed Qin Shi’s conduct, I now clarify the principle of fully embracing life and death, concluding the chapter. The aim is for people to understand that what arises naturally should not disturb their hearts in matters of life and death, for only then can one nurture life. *Fuzi* is a term of respect for a man of the Dao. It means that among those with the Dao between Heaven and Earth, their coming is timely, and their going is fitting. One should simply follow the times and accord with them. Knowing that their coming and going are timely, one neither rejoices at arrival nor grieves at departure—this is what it means for sorrow and joy to 'not enter.' *Xuan* means the heart is bound; *Di* means Heaven. To know the naturalness of Heaven’s principle is to prevent Heaven from binding one with life and death. Though it be Heaven, it cannot constrain me—hence the term 'the untying of Heaven’s bonds.'\n\n\"A finger pointing to the firewood cannot exhaust the fire’s blaze—this is a metaphor for life and death. If you observe the firewood, it has a limit, but the fire in the world has been passed down from ancient times to the present without end. These three lines are a marvel of expression. The principle of life and death cannot be fully captured in words, yet in discussing the text, the preceding argument is concluded with this metaphor—is this not the most exquisite part of the writing?\n\n*Inner Chapters, \"The Human World,\" Chapter Four*\nThe previous section spoke of nurturing life; this one speaks of the human world. It means that once one has this body and dwells in this world, how can one completely sever human affairs? The key is to navigate them well. With such an understanding, how can Zhuangzi be called impractical? How can he be said to disregard human affairs? This aligns with the meaning of the Outer Chapters: 'Nothing is worth doing, yet nothing can be left undone.'\n\nYan Hui sought an audience with Confucius and asked to depart, saying: \"Where are you going?\" \"I intend to go to Wei.\" \"What will you do there?\" \"I have heard that the lord of Wei is young in years and acts alone. He governs his state lightly yet does not perceive his errors, and he treats the people’s lives as of little worth. The dead are measured by the state as if they were reeds in a marsh—how can the people endure this?\" *His years are young, his conduct solitary*—this means he is young and self-willed, heedless of others’ counsel. *He governs his state lightly yet does not perceive his errors*—he misuses his state without recognizing his faults. *He treats the people’s lives as of little worth*—he harms and slaughters them. *The dead are measured by the state as if they were reeds in a marsh*—he treats the people as lightly as grass. Xunzi’s *Enriching the State* says: \"measured by the marsh,\" which shares this meaning. Here, the phrase is inverted to \"as if reeds in a marsh\"—this is a marvel of composition. *Yun* means marsh, as in *Yunmeng*; in ancient times, it was all water, but now there is land to till. It is not called *Yunmeng soil* but *Yun soil, Meng land*—this is a literary technique. Similarly, *xuan* means fine silk, as does *kuang*; it is not called *xuankuang* but *xuan kuang*—another example of this technique. *How can the people endure this?*—it means they have nowhere to turn.\n\nHui had heard from the Master: \"Where there is order, leave; where there is chaos, go—this is the teaching of the sages.\" But Zhuangzi reverses this, saying: \"Where there is order, leave; where there is chaos, go.\" It is like a physician who can only practice when there are many illnesses. If a state is already well-governed, what need is there for me? *I wish to apply what I have heard and consider its principles*—this means he wishes to convey to the lord of Wei what he has heard from the Master, so that the lord might reflect on these principles and reform, perhaps bringing peace to his state.\n\nConfucius said: \"Alas! You will likely go and be punished. The Dao does not tolerate杂乱;杂乱 leads to excess, excess to disturbance, disturbance to anxiety, and anxiety to ruin. The utmost man first establishes himself before establishing others. If what is established in oneself is not secure, how can one attend to the conduct of violent men? Moreover, do you know what causes virtue to dissipate and knowledge to arise? Virtue dissipates for the sake of fame, and knowledge arises from contention. Fame is what people vie over, and knowledge is the tool of contention—both are inauspicious instruments, not the means to perfect conduct. Furthermore, if one’s virtue is profound and trust is firm, yet one’s *qi* does not reach others; if one’s fame is heard but not contended for, yet one forcibly imposes the language of benevolence, righteousness, rules, and techniques upon violent men, this is to make others resent what one considers beautiful. This is called 'bringing disaster upon others.' One who brings disaster upon others will have disaster reflected back upon them. You will likely bring disaster upon yourself.\n\n*Where there is the Dao, appear; where there is no Dao, hide*—this is the teaching of the sages. But Zhuangzi reverses this, saying: \"Where there is order, leave; where there is chaos, go.\" It means that if one can heal, one should do so only when there are many illnesses. If a state is already well-ordered, what use is there for me? *I wish to apply what I have heard and consider its principles*—he wishes to convey to the lord of Wei what he has heard from the Master, so that the lord might reflect on these principles and reform, perhaps bringing peace to his state.\"",

It is better not to go.\n\nThe Dao does not desire杂: when this heart is unadulterated, it is pure, unified, empty, and luminous. If one harbors thoughts—considering how they are and how one might save them—this is already \"harboring the heart,\" and within me, it is already杂. If I am not pure and unified, how can I save them?\n\n杂 then 多: \"many\" refers to being scattered in many directions. 扰 means \"chaos,\" and 忧 means \"self-torment.\" You are tormenting yourself—how can you save others? The ancients first established what was within themselves before admonishing others. If what is within me is not settled, how can I attend to others? Though their conduct is violent and wicked, I am tormenting myself—how can I attend to others?\n\nVirtue arises naturally. 知 is private cunning. The moment one harbors a desire for fame, one’s natural virtue is already lost. The moment one employs private cunning, contention arises. Thus it is said: virtue is lost through fame and cunning, and contention emerges from them.\n\n争相轧 means \"to overthrow one another.\" 争之器 refers to the tools of contention: if I use private cunning, they too will use private cunning, and the struggle will never cease. Fame and cunning are the most perilous affairs under heaven—if one insists on pursuing them, calamity is inevitable.\n\n矼 means \"thick,\" and 厚德 is \"substantial virtue.\" 厚信 means \"truly trustworthy conduct.\" Though I possess virtue and trustworthiness, if I do not understand their nature and qi, and though I may have a fine reputation and renown, if I do not comprehend their hearts—if I forcibly present the language of benevolence, righteousness, and legal standards before violent and wicked people—they will resent what you consider beautiful.\n\n绳墨 refers to legal standards, and 术 is synonymous with 述. 菑人 means \"one who brings disaster.\" They will surely call you a \"disaster-bringer,\" and once this name is given, disaster will reflect back upon you. If you go now, you will likely bring disaster upon yourself—how can you transform the lord of Wei and save his state?\n\nMoreover, if one merely delights in the worthy and despises the unworthy, what need is there to seek distinction? If you do not await the summons of kings and lords, they will surely take advantage of you, contend for victory, and your eyes will flicker in distress, your complexion will flatten in submission, your mouth will stammer in defense, your demeanor will reveal fear, and your heart will yield to compliance.\n\nThis is like using fire to fight fire, water to fight water—it is called \"adding more.\" Following this path without end, if you persist in speaking earnestly to those who do not trust you, you will surely die before violent men.\n\nIf they truly knew the worthy and delighted in them, knew the unworthy and despised them, what need would there be for me to seek further distinction? It is precisely because they do not distinguish between worthy and unworthy that they act as they do. If they do not recognize worthiness, how will they know you are worthy and trust your words?\n\n诏 means \"summons.\" 若汝 refers to you. The lord of Wei has not summoned you, so if you go uninvited, he, as a lord, will surely take advantage of your words to contend for victory. When you are thus cornered, your eyes will flicker in distress, your complexion will flatten in submission, your mouth will stammer in defense, your demeanor will reveal fear, and your heart will yield to compliance.\n\nEmperor Wu of Liang’s debate with He Chen perfectly illustrates this pattern—it speaks of contention that ends in defeat and self-submission.

      "translated_text": "The phrase \"益多\" refers to the multiplication of their evil. If you follow this path, their wickedness will grow boundless, and their violence and tyranny will only intensify. \"厚言\" means to speak deeply or excessively. If you have not yet earned others' trust and yet, with your untrustworthy self, speak at length before a violent man, you will surely be killed by him.\n\nConsider the past: Jie killed Guan Longfeng, and Zhou killed Prince Bigan—both were men who cultivated themselves, humbled themselves to care for the people, and thus opposed their superiors. Their rulers, seizing upon their cultivation, cast them out—such are those who covet reputation. In ancient times, Yao attacked Congzhi and Xu'ao, and Yu attacked the state of Youhu. Their lands were laid waste, their bodies executed, their warfare unceasing, their pursuit of substance insatiable—all were seekers of fame and gain. Have you not heard of this? Fame and substance are things even the sages cannot overcome—how much less can one like you?\n\nGuan Longfeng and Bigan cultivated themselves and admonished out of love for the people, not realizing that the people were not their own. You, however, lower yourself to care for them—\"伛拊\" means to cherish and nurture. Jie and Zhou did not love the people, yet you love the people of Jie and Zhou. This is opposing one's superior, and thus they were killed. Their cultivation of goodness was used against them, provoking anger—this is the fault of those who crave reputation.\n\nCongzhi, Xu'ao, and Youhu are allegorical states, reduced to ruins, their dead becoming vengeful spirits—\"厉\" refers to those without descendants or refuge. The reason these states met such disaster was their unceasing warfare in pursuit of fame and substance. \"实\" means profit. \"不能胜\" means unable to endure. Those who seek fame and self-interest—even Yao and Yu could not endure it, leading to the destruction of their states—how much less can you?\n\n\"胜\" is read as *shēng*. Yao and Yu did not actually do these things; they are allegories. Nevertheless, if you must have a method, I once spoke of this to Yan Hui: \"Be upright yet empty, strive yet unified—would this suffice?\" He replied, \"How could it be so simple? To present yang as fullness, to display shifting colors—this is what ordinary people do not resist. They follow others' inclinations to seek favor, and their hearts are named 'the virtue of gradual encroachment.' If even this is not achieved, how much less can great virtue be? They cling rigidly without transformation, outwardly compliant yet inwardly unyielding—how can this be sufficient?\"\n\nThis is another turn: if you insist on going, you must have a purpose for doing so.",
      "overlap_context": " your eyes will flicker in distress, your complexion will flatten in submission, your mouth will stammer in defense, your demeanor will reveal fear, and your heart will yield to compliance.\n\nEmperor Wu of Liang’s debate with He Chen perfectly illustrates this pattern—it speaks of contention that ends in defeat and self-submission. If the other party is violent and gains the upper hand, their momentum will only grow stronger, like using water to fight water or fire to fight fire—only adding more.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, let me put it to the test—this is but an attempt at discourse, an aid to conversation. \"Be upright yet empty\" means to rectify your person while keeping your mind open and vast. \"Strive yet unified\" means to exert yourself diligently, ever consistent from beginning to end. If you can do this, is it sufficient? \"How could it be so simple?\"—this is to say, it is far from sufficient.\n\n\"To present yang as fullness, to display shifting colors\"—this describes those who, having attained success, are filled with yang qi, their demeanor swelling with self-satisfaction, their bearing exceedingly proud. \"Shifting colors\" refers to their haughty expressions, which never settle. Ordinary people dare not oppose them, instead yielding and deferring out of fear. Seeing that everyone fears them, if you seek to move them with words, they will only demand that you submit to their will to gratify their desires. Thus it is said: \"to seek favor,\" for their hearts delight in such compliance. This is called \"the virtue of gradual encroachment.\" If even this petty virtue cannot be achieved, how much less can great virtue?\n\n\"Clinging rigidly without transformation\"—this means obstinately refusing to change. If you act thus, outwardly you may feign uprightness and emptiness to conform to others, but inwardly you cling to your \"striving yet unified\" resolve, believing yourself free of fault. How can this be deemed sufficient? If, however, you are inwardly straight and outwardly yielding, achieving harmony with what is above—then \"inwardly straight\" means guarding this principle within, preserving your true nature. This \"straightness\" resembles \"truth.\" From the nobility of the Son of Heaven down to yourself, all are children of Heaven, all arising from the natural. How dare you, with your own words, seek to make others approve of what you deem right and disapprove of what you deem wrong? Without this self-serving heart, you remain as guileless as a child, thus merging with Heaven. This is called \"being a companion to Heaven.\"\n\n\"Outwardly yielding\" means fully observing the rites of bowing, kneeling, and prostrating—acts of ministerial deference. If everyone does this, why should I alone refuse? To do what others do is to avoid their censure. This is called \"being a companion to man.\" \"Achieving harmony with what is above\" means aligning with the ancients, becoming their companion. Though your words may seem to instruct or rebuke, they are in truth the sayings of the ancients, not your own. If so, even blunt honesty will not be faulted. This is called \"being a companion to the ancients.\" If you act thus, is it sufficient?\n\nYet if you descend further, consider Yan Hui’s reply, divided into three parts:\n\n\"Inwardly straight\" means inwardly preserving this principle, guarding your true nature. From the exalted Son of Heaven to yourself, all are born of Heaven, all arise naturally. How dare you, with your own words, seek to make others approve of your rightness and disapprove of your wrongness? Without this self-serving heart, you remain as pure as a child, thus merging with Heaven. Hence, it is said: \"being a companion to Heaven.\"\n\n\"Outwardly yielding\" means fully performing the rites of bowing, kneeling, and prostrating—acts everyone observes. If I too observe them, others will find no fault in me. Though this may seem to follow the crowd, such compliance arises from humility. These discussions mock the sagely gate with such reasoning, yet they align with others. Hence, it is said: \"being a companion to man.\"\n\n\"Achieving\" refers to your own established doctrines. \"Harmony with what is above\" means aligning your doctrines with the ancients, citing them as evidence. Though you borrow the ancients' teachings, your words are direct rebukes, yet because they are not your own, even bluntness incurs no blame. This is called \"being a companion to the ancients.\" If you act thus, is it sufficient?\n\nConfucius said: \"How could it be so simple? Too many policies and methods, yet no tranquility—though steadfast, you remain blameless, yet this is all it amounts to. How can it extend to transformation? You are still guided by your own mind.\" \"Policies\" refer to affairs of governance; \"methods\" to their implementation. Your words propose too many measures, yet they never settle into peace. Though you may achieve these three things and remain blameless, this only spares you from fault—how can it transform others? Thus it is said: \"How can it extend to transformation?\" Where lies the flaw? In your three doctrines, you are still guided by a mind of deliberate action, still harboring intentions, still leaving traces—far from the natural Dao.\n\nYan Hui said: \"I have no further progress to make. May I ask the method?\" Confucius replied: \"Fast, and I will tell you. If you undertake this with preconceptions, will it be easy? To treat it as easy is to estrange Heaven—this is not fitting.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"My family is poor. For months, I have not drunk wine or eaten meat. Is this fasting?\" Confucius said: \"This is the fasting of sacrifice, not the fasting of the mind.\"\n\nYan Hui said: \"May I ask about the fasting of the mind?\" Confucius replied: \"Unify your will. Do not listen with your ears, but listen with your mind. Do not listen with your mind, but listen with qi. Listening stops at the ears; the mind stops at signs. Qi is emptiness that awaits things. Only the Dao gathers in emptiness. Emptiness is the fasting of the mind.\"\n\n\"I have no further progress to make\"—this means no higher attainment remains. \"If you undertake this with preconceptions, will it be easy?\" If you think your skills suffice to act with ease, the moment this frivolous thought arises, you estrange the vastness of Heaven. Hence, it is said: \"To treat it as easy is to estrange Heaven—this is not fitting.\" These two lines are most vital for one’s life and practice.\n\nThe fasting of sacrifice is external; the fasting of the mind is internal. \"Unify your will\" means focusing the mind without distraction. Listening with the ears is still external; listening with the mind is still within oneself. Listening with qi is to be without thing. Listening with the ears stops at the ears and does not enter the mind; listening with the mind means external things must align with me, creating opposition between thing and self. Qi follows the natural and awaits things with emptiness. Emptiness is where the Dao resides. Hence, it is said: \"Only the Dao gathers in emptiness.\" This \"emptiness\" is the fasting of the mind.\n\nYan Hui said: \"Before I received your instruction, there was indeed a Yan Hui. Having received it, there is no longer a Yan Hui. Can this be called emptiness?\" Confucius said: \"It is complete.\"\n\n\"Received instruction\" means having been taught. This is Yan Hui’s sudden awakening: before receiving instruction, there was still a self; after receiving it, there is no longer a self. Forgetting the self is emptiness. \"It is complete\" means your words exhaust the principle.",

      "translated_text": "I speak to you: if you can enter and wander within its bounds without being moved by its reputation—entering, then you may respond; not entering, then cease—without gate, without poison, abiding in one dwelling and lodging in inevitability, then you are near. You, living in the world, are as if in a cage. If you can enter it and wander within without being stirred by hollow fame, then where there are traces, names may arise; but where traces arise, the mind is already moved. Moving through the world without intent leaves no trace; without trace, the mind remains unmoved. Thus it is said: \"Wander within its bounds without being moved by its reputation.\" What follows is precisely the method for navigating the world: \"Entering, then respond\" means speaking when one may be spoken to; \"not entering, then cease\" means not speaking when one may not be spoken to. The meaning aligns with the *Analects*, though the phrasing is striking. Where there is a fixed place, there is a gate; where there is no fixed place, there is no gate. Where there is scent and flavor, there is poison; where there is no scent or flavor, there is no poison. Poison is the taste of medicine—all metaphors for being without intent or trace. A dwelling is where one resides; if you take this undifferentiated unity as your abode and lodge this mind in inevitability, then the Way of living in the human world is complete. *Ji* means \"near completion.\"\n\n\"Erasing traces is easy; leaving no tracks while walking on the earth is difficult.\" Traces are footprints. To stop and not walk is to leave no footprints—this is easy. But how can one not walk? One must walk upon the earth, yet leaving no tracks while doing so is difficult. This means that if one refrains from all action, it is easy, but how can one live without acting? Since every aspect of life involves action, the challenge lies in acting without acting—this is difficult.\n\n\"Serving man is easy when feigning; serving Heaven is difficult when feigning.\" Serving man is easy when feigning, for one is driven by human desires and readily resorts to deception. But if one guards the mind and follows the workings of creation, there is no room for pretense. \"Serving man\" refers to human desires; \"serving Heaven\" refers to the daily application of Heavenly principle. The words \"easy\" and \"difficult\" carry meaning: the easy path leads to dissipation, while the difficult path leaves no room for pretense.\n\n\"I have heard of flying with wings, but never of flying without wings. I have heard of knowing with knowledge, but never of knowing without knowledge.\" \"I have heard of flying with wings\" means birds must fly with wings; flying without wings is to arrive swiftly without haste, to reach without walking—this is the marvel of the spirit. This phrase serves as a metaphor for the following line. Ordinarily, people know through knowledge, but knowing what one does not know is the knowledge of no-knowledge—this is the subtlety of attaining the Dao.\n\n\"Look at that empty chamber: when the room is vacant, brightness is born. Auspiciousness abides where it abides. But if one does not abide, this is called sitting in motion.\" *Zhan* means to gaze. This uses the empty chamber as a metaphor for the mind: when you observe that even in a sealed room, light enters through the smallest opening, the light emerges from emptiness. Comparing that emptiness to the mind’s vacancy, you see that from emptiness, clarity naturally arises—brightness is born. It does not say \"brightness is born\" but \"whiteness is born,\" a striking turn of phrase by Zhuangzi. This state of empty clarity is where the myriad things gather, where auspiciousness dwells. \"Abiding where it abides\"—the second *zhi* refers to the empty place. Only by abiding can there be emptiness; only in emptiness can there be clarity, reflecting the principle that stillness gives rise to concentration, and concentration gives rise to wisdom. But if the mind is not restrained and cannot abide, though the body sits still, the mind races outward—how can one achieve sitting in forgetfulness? This is the meaning of \"sitting in motion,\" the inverse of sitting in forgetfulness.\n\n\"When one follows the ears and eyes inward and is outwardly free from the mind’s knowledge, even spirits will come to dwell—how much more so men? This is the transformation of the myriad things, the pivot of Yu and Shun, the path nearly grasped by Fuxi and nearly trod by Qi. How much more so for those who are scattered and fragmented?\"",

      "translated_text": "The ears’ hearing and eyes’ seeing all inwardly connect to the heart—if I harbor no thoughts within, then I follow the hearing of the ears and seeing of the eyes. Though they inwardly connect, they are in truth external to the heart’s knowledge. What does it mean to be \"external to the heart’s knowledge\"? It means the heart remains unmoved, and external things cannot enter. Though one hears what is heard and sees what is seen, there is no heart engaged in hearing or seeing. In this way, the emptiness of this heart communes with spirits—how much more so with men? This is to say, only thus can one transform and influence others. \"Spirits come to dwell\" means that with utmost sincerity, this heart naturally harbors spirits and communes with the Creator. Thus, having expounded this, the text concludes with a single phrase: *This is the transformation of the myriad things.* This speaks of the principle of creation, the source from which all things arise. This was the great pivot seen by Shun and Yu, the path nearly trod by Fuxi and Qi to the end of their lives—how much more so for those beneath them? *Qi* may refer to an ancient sage-king, though no record confirms this; it is likely a figurative reference. *Scattered* refers to ordinary people. The text now shifts to further elucidate this, not adhering to the previous passage.\n\nYe Gong Zi Gao was about to be sent as an envoy to Qi. He asked Confucius, saying: \"The king’s charge to Zhu Liang is of great weight. Qi’s treatment of envoys is reverent yet not urgent. Even a common man cannot be moved lightly—how much more so a feudal lord? I am deeply fearful. You once told Zhu Liang: ‘In all matters, great or small, few succeed without speaking harmoniously to bring them to fruition. If a matter fails, one will surely face the calamities of human law; if it succeeds, one will surely face the calamities of yin and yang. Only one of virtue can ensure no calamity follows, whether the matter succeeds or fails.’ I eat coarse food without discerning its coarseness, and my cooking stove remains cold from lack of use. Now, upon receiving my charge this morning, I drink ice by evening—have I not inwardly exhausted myself? I have not yet fully grasped the nature of the matter, yet I already face the calamities of yin and yang. If the matter fails, I will surely face the calamities of human law. These are twofold perils. As a minister, I am unworthy of this task. You must instruct me further.\"\n\n*Zhu Liang* was Ye Gong’s name; *Zi Gao* was his courtesy name. \"The charge to Zhu Liang is of great weight\" means the mission to Qi is a grave responsibility. \"Reverent yet not urgent\" describes their treatment of envoys as courteous but slow in response. Even common men, when engaged, may not reciprocate—how much more so feudal lords? This is why he trembles with fear. *Zi* refers to the Master (Confucius). He once taught me: \"In affairs, great or small, few succeed without speaking harmoniously to achieve their completion.\" *Few* means rare; *not speaking* means not communicating. In governing, if a matter fails, one will surely face punishment, hence \"the calamities of human law.\" If one labors over calculations and schemes to succeed, excessive worry and stress will lead to illness, hence \"the calamities of yin and yang.\" Only one of virtue can ensure no calamity follows, whether the matter succeeds or fails. All the above are Confucius’ words.\n\nNow, since receiving the mission, I no longer taste my food—whether coarse or fine, I do not discern it. *Fine* means refined. Ordinarily, frequent meals keep the kitchen stove warm, but now, with little food due to worry, the stove remains cold. Moreover, upon receiving the charge this morning, my heart was already scorched, and by evening, I drank ice. *Nature* means reality. I have only just received the charge and not yet fully grasped the matter, yet I already suffer this affliction. If the matter fails, I will face punishment—thus, I suffer twofold calamities. As a minister, I am truly unequal to this task. *You must instruct me further* means, \"What teaching can you offer me?\" *Come* is an auxiliary word.",

      "translated_text": "Confucius said: \"There are two great precepts under heaven. The first is *ming* (Heaven’s decree); the second is *yi* (righteous duty). A child’s love for parents is *ming*—it cannot be untied from the heart. A minister’s service to the ruler is *yi*—there is no place where the ruler is not present, no refuge within heaven and earth. These are called the great precepts.\n\nThus, one who serves parents finds peace without choosing the place—this is the utmost of filial piety. One who serves the ruler finds peace without choosing the task—this is the height of loyalty. One who serves the heart does not alter joy or sorrow before it: foreknowing the inevitable yet accepting it as *ming* is the pinnacle of *de* (virtue/power).\n\nAs a minister or child, one is fundamentally constrained by the circumstances of action, forgetting the self. How then could there be leisure to delight in life or shrink from death? Your conduct, sir, is fitting.\"\n\nThis passage is entirely sound in its discourse, addressing the human condition with such profound words. How could one dismiss Zhuangzi as impractical or given to grand exaggeration?\n\n*The great precepts* are the great laws. *Ming* is what one receives from Heaven: a child’s service to parents arises with birth, and this heart cannot depart for a single day—hence, it *cannot be untied*. *Yi* is what one ought to do in the world. A minister’s service to the ruler is the foremost duty in the realm. The saying *lord and subject* means that within the bounds of the land, none are not the king’s subjects—so where could one go that the ruler is not present? Where in heaven and earth could one escape? In serving parents with utmost filiality, one follows their command east or west, north or south, without choosing the place for comfort. When the heart is fixed on loyalty, joy and sorrow, though present, cannot alter it. Matters may be easy or difficult, fraught with fortune or misfortune—once the ruler’s command is issued, it becomes one’s own appointed task, a matter of *ming*. What can be done but accept and follow it?\n\nTo act thus is to be a person of utmost *de*. For a minister or child, much depends on what one encounters. If, by misfortune, one meets with hardship, it is simply what cannot be avoided. One must carry out the substance of the task and nothing more. *Substance* means reality—proceeding with plain sincerity, how could one turn to consider the self? Though calamity may extend to matters of life and death, there is no alternative. Your conduct, sir, is fitting.\"\n\n*Your conduct is fitting* means, \"You can only proceed thus.\" *Sir* refers to Lord Ye.",

      "translated_text": "I shall once more present what I have heard: In all dealings, if the parties are near, they must yield to one another in trust; if distant, they must be loyal in their words, and those words must be conveyed by others. Yet the words of mutual delight or mutual anger are the most perilous in the world. Where there is mutual delight, there is bound to be excessive praise; where mutual anger, excessive slander. All excess is falsehood—falsehood breeds distrust, and distrust brings calamity upon the messenger. Thus the *Maxims* says: \"Convey the ordinary sentiments, but do not convey the excessive words, and you will be nearly whole.\"\n\nHere, the discourse shifts to depict the ways of the world: trust must be grounded in something verifiable, like tallying tokens. *Yielding* means compliance. In close dealings, one acts thus; if the parties are distant, loyalty must be expressed through words, fully conveying the truth. Yet how do such words reach their destination? They must be transmitted by a messenger. But between the two—whether in mutual delight or mutual anger—lies the greatest difficulty. If one arrives in delight and the other responds in kind, their praise will exceed what is proper, hence \"excessive praise.\" If both are angry, their censure will likewise exceed what is proper, hence \"excessive slander.\" All such excess is falsehood, and falsehood ensures that the listener will be filled with doubt and unable to trust fully. *Mo* describes this state of suspicion. Once doubt arises, the ill will of both sides falls upon the messenger, who is inevitably blamed. Thus it is said: \"Distrust brings calamity upon the conveyor of words.\" The *Maxims* is an ancient text, cited here as a warning for those entrusted with such missions.\n\nTo \"convey the ordinary sentiments\" means the messenger should transmit only plain, unadorned speech, avoiding any words that exceed what is proper. Thus: \"Do not convey the excessive words.\" If the messenger acts thus, he may nearly preserve himself whole.\n\nMoreover, those who contend with skill and strength begin with openness but end in concealment. When excess prevails, there is much cunning. Those who drink wine with ritual propriety begin in order but end in disorder. When excess prevails, there is much extravagant revelry. All affairs are the same: they begin in sincerity but end in pettiness. What starts simply must grow vast. Words are like wind and waves; deeds are like the loss of substance. Wind and waves are easily stirred; the loss of substance is easily imperiled. Thus anger arises without cause, and artful speech with biased words. When a beast is dying, it does not choose its cries—its breath comes in ragged gasps, and from this, hearts grow fierce, and harshness takes hold. When severity becomes extreme, unworthy thoughts inevitably arise in response, though one may not realize it. If one does not realize it, who can know where it will end?\n\nHaving spoken of the perils of conveying words, the text now turns to analogies of worldly affairs, each sentence a reflection of human nature. This is the marvel of *Zhuangzi*: those who contend with skill and strength—like today’s wrestlers—begin with outward joy, but end in hidden malice. At first, they merely grapple in play, but in the end, it often turns to real fighting. For when play becomes excessive, it oversteps bounds, and cunning grows ever more strange. *Excess prevails* means overstepping bounds. Those who gather to drink do so with ritual propriety.",

For when drinking exceeds proper bounds, the joy it brings often turns strange—thus disputes may arise.

      "translated_text": "When anger arises, a cruel and vicious heart emerges alongside it. Once I am thus, those who respond to me—confronted with my harshness—will inevitably harbor unfilial or unworthy intentions. At times, this may escalate to mutual harm or destruction, all driven by anger without awareness of its cause.\n\nHaving been swept away by anger without self-awareness, how can one pause to consider its consequences? The foregoing illustrates how worldly affairs may turn from good to evil through entanglement, leading to this point.\n\nThus, the *Fa Yan* states: *Do not alter commands; do not urge completion*—excess leads to transgression. To alter commands or urge completion is perilous, for success in goodness requires time, while evil forms too swiftly to amend. Should one not be cautious?\n\nMoreover, to ride the natural course of things and roam the mind freely, entrusting oneself to necessity to nurture the center—this is perfection. Why act with ulterior motives of repayment? Far better to fulfill one’s mission. Yet this is difficult. Here, the text cites ancient words to conclude the matter of serving a ruler’s command: *Do not shift the mandate*, meaning to abide by constant principles.\n\nIf, upon receiving a command, one privately schemes for its fulfillment or alters its intent, it cannot succeed. Whether the matter succeeds or not must be left to nature; one cannot force its completion. Thus, *do not urge completion*—seeking excess is to overreach. The moment an excessive thought arises from an ordinary mind, it becomes a desire for gain, which must not surpass proper measure. To exceed the usual bounds is to overreach. Altering commands and urging completion are both excessive thoughts, and such schemes are bound to endanger. Hence, *perilous affairs*.\n\nHuman relationships, especially deep bonds, are not forged in a day but require time to stabilize. Thus, *goodness takes time to mature*. A single discordant word or uncooperative act may turn affection to enmity in an instant. Hence, *evil forms before one can correct it*. This means that turning to hatred is easy, while fostering goodwill is difficult—thus, one must be especially cautious.\n\nIf I ride the natural flow of events and let my mind wander freely, entrusting my response to necessity to nurture my center, this is the highest attainment. Why then act with ulterior motives of repayment? Repayment refers to returning to fulfill one’s mission. Acting excessively to seek gain is overreaching. *Fulfilling one’s mission* means conveying the ruler’s command to Wei with sincerity.\n\nYour duty is to deliver the ruler’s command with truth alone, without overthinking its success or failure. Even this sincere fulfillment is difficult; you must strive to achieve it. Here, the text adds another layer of difficulty, for navigating such circumstances is indeed hard.\n\nThis passage, titled *The Human World*, precisely describes the difficulty of navigating life. Its intricate portrayal of worldly affairs could only be achieved by one like Zhuangzi, whose nature harmonizes with the Dao. Some critics claim that Lao-Zhuang philosophy only grasps the subtlety of the Daoist mind (*the mind of the Dao is subtle*) while neglecting the peril of the human mind (*the human mind is perilous*). Such judgments arise from a superficial reading of their works.\n\nYan He was about to serve as tutor to the crown prince of Duke Ling of Wei when he sought counsel from Qu Boyu: \"There is a man whose virtue is *heavenly destructive*. If I indulge him without restraint, he will endanger our state; if I guide him with principles, he will endanger me. His wisdom suffices to detect others’ faults but not to recognize his own. What should I do?\"\n\nQu Boyu replied: \"Excellent question! Be vigilant, be cautious, and first rectify yourself. In conduct, align with him; in mind, harmonize with him. Yet even these two approaches have pitfalls. Alignment should not be forced, nor harmony contrived. If you align outwardly but force entry, you risk collapse, ruin, or stumbling. If you harmonize inwardly but contrive exit, you risk becoming a voice, a reputation, an omen, or a calamity.\n\nIf he acts like a child, join him as a child. If he abandons boundaries, join him in abandoning boundaries. If he transcends limits, join him in transcending limits. Guide him to reach flawlessness.\"\n\nYan He was preparing to tutor the crown prince and sought Qu Boyu’s advice. *There is a man* refers to the prince. *His virtue is heavenly destructive* means heaven has stripped him of discernment—*destructive* here implies erosion, like frost withering grass, suggesting his nature has been corrupted by fate.\n\n*Without restraint* means lacking principles. If one allows his transgressions to go unchecked, he will endanger the state; if one corrects him, the harm will first befall oneself. The prince’s intelligence enables him to spot others’ faults but not his own. *What should I do?* expresses helplessness.\n\n*Rectify yourself* means to first establish discipline in one’s own conduct. *Align* means to follow, and *harmonize* means to attune. Yet both approaches have dangers: alignment should not be forced, nor harmony contrived.",

Thus it is said, *\"It becomes fame, renown, omen, and affliction.\"* The phrasing here is most extraordinary.\n\n*\"Like an infant\"* refers to one who resembles an ignorant child. *\"Without boundaries\"* means lacking banks or shores—his conduct is unrestrained, without rules or standards. *\"Without limits\"* means without edges or bounds—his actions proceed without considering their ultimate consequences. The infant, without boundaries or limits, embodies the description of one who acts in ignorance and recklessness. Since he is so ignorant and reckless, one should comply with him for the time being. Thus it is said, *\"Also accompany him.\"* When he reaches a point of possible awakening, then apply subtle transformation to jolt him into sudden realization, so he may enter a state without blemish.\n\n*\"To awaken\"* means to attain enlightenment. *\"Without blemish\"* means without fault. Formerly, Master Aixuan recounted an old tale from Putian: a man whose father died left him unburied and squandered his family estate to indulge his desires. When his fields were nearly exhausted, his relatives pitied him and collected money to fund his father’s burial. He feigned agreement but spent the money as before. All his kin were outraged. One clansman, however, went out and befriended him, indulging his every whim. One evening, after heavy drinking and reaching the height of merriment, the clansman patted his back and said, *\"Others cannot bear such sorrow, yet Yan Hui did not alter his joy.\"* The man was suddenly awakened, wept bitterly, and returned home to bury his father. He ultimately became a good man. This is precisely the principle at work here.",

Beware, take heed: those who accumulate boasts of their fine talents and thus provoke the world’s taboos are on the brink of peril.\n\nDo you not know of those who raise tigers? They dare not feed them living creatures, lest the beasts’ rage at being forced to kill; nor do they dare give them whole prey, lest the beasts’ fury at tearing flesh be roused. They time their hunger and satiety, pacify their temper—though tigers and men are of different kinds, the tiger flatters and fawns upon its keeper, for this is submission. Thus, those it kills are those who oppose it.\n\nAs for those who love horses: they use baskets to collect dung and conch shells to gather urine. Yet when a mosquito or gadfly alights, and a groom absentmindedly slaps it, the horse, startled, may break its bit, smash its head, or shatter its chest. Here, devotion reaches one point, but carelessness loses another—can one not be cautious?\n\nBelow are several more analogies. The mantis, relying on the beauty of its talent, seeks to block the wheel’s track with its arms—this illustrates how those of modest talent, self-important, presume to take on great matters, and rarely avoid failure. Such is the consequence of repeated overreaching.\n\n*伐* means boasting; *几* means peril.

There stands a great tree, extraordinary in its magnitude—its vastness unlike that which is ordinary. Though a thousand chariots, each drawn by four horses, were to gather beneath its branches, seeking shelter from the scorching sun, it would still provide ample shade. Thus it is said: the horses shall find shelter from the heat, and this shelter comes from the tree itself, which in turn shelters all things. The heat seeks refuge from the tree, yet the tree’s essence remains hollow and insubstantial—like the stem of a taro, which, when licked or chewed, dissolves upon the tongue and rots the mouth, or when sniffed, clings to one like intoxication, so pungent is its odor. This tree, precisely because of its uselessness, has thus preserved its life and grown to such immense proportions. The spirit-like persons of antiquity preserved their lives by this same uselessness. Therefore it is said: \"The spirit-like person cherishes such uselessness!\"—an exclamation of admiration.\n\nJing is a place name.

Here, Zhuangzi, fond of the extraordinary, adds the phrase \"suffering from piles\" to the list. *Shi* means \"to go\"; thus, none of these may be taken to the River for sacrifice.\n\nThough shamans and invokers deemed these three unusable and inauspicious, they did not realize that their very inauspiciousness spared them from the calamity of slaughter. From the perspective of the spirit-like person, this inauspiciousness is in fact great auspiciousness. Both these passages illustrate the perils of navigating the world: those who seek to distinguish themselves in society inevitably invite misfortune—hence the analogy.\n\nAs for *Zhili Shu*: his chin rested upon his navel, his shoulders towered above his head, his topknot pointed skyward, and the five viscera’s ducts rose upward. His thighs flanked his ribs. By mending clothes and washing laundry, he earned enough to feed himself; by winnowing grain and sifting out the finest rice, he could provide for ten. When the authorities conscripted warriors, *Zhili* rolled up his sleeves among them, though none selected him. When great labor was demanded, *Zhili*, citing his chronic ailment, was exempted from service. Yet when the state distributed grain to the infirm, he received three *zhong*, and when firewood was allotted, ten bundles. One whose body was as broken as *Zhili*’s could still sustain himself and live out his natural years—how much more so one whose virtue is thus fragmented?\n\n*Zhili* describes a body in disarray; *Shu* is his given name. His chin sank to his navel, his torso hunched. His shoulders jutted above his head, and his topknot was bound like a mallet. The ducts of his five viscera all inclined upward due to his stooped back. His thighs, pressed close to his sides, served as ribs. This depicts a man utterly disabled. By mending clothes and laundering, he made a living; by winnowing grain and refining rice, he fed ten—so swift was his labor. When warriors were conscripted, he raised his arms among them, but none chose him. When great labor was imposed, he was excused due to his chronic illness. Yet he received three *zhong* of grain and ten bundles of firewood from the state. If one whose body was as broken as *Zhili*’s could still nourish himself and live out his years, how much more so one whose virtue is thus fragmented?",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: in this present age, one is fortunate merely to escape punishment. To live through an age of chaos and escape punishment so as to preserve one’s life—this is but the slightest sliver of fortune, yet you fail even to recognize it, though you bear and receive it. In an age of chaos, should misfortune befall you, it often leads to execution, a weight heavier than the earth itself, yet you fail to avoid it. The *Han Odes* says: “Glory and splendor fill not the eye, / While calamity looms large as a house.” This is precisely its meaning.\n\nEnough! Enough!—meaning, cease, cease. To exalt oneself by virtue and look down upon others is the way to court disaster. How perilous! How dangerous! “Drawing lines on the ground and walking within them” describes one who restricts and torments oneself as if bound by such lines. It is like Yangming—human nature is originally luminous, yet you, deluded, lose it and thus inevitably act in the world in a way that causes harm. “Crooked and circuitous” means to twist and turn, to evade and yield. Unable to follow the true and straight Way, you act thus—twisting, evading, yielding—and so must end by injuring your own feet. “Injuring your own feet” means it cannot be walked. The mountain tree, because it is useful, invites the axe’s disaster—this is self-inflicted harm. The fat of the lamp, because it gives light and is useful, brings upon itself the torment of burning. Cinnamon, because it is edible, is felled by others; lacquer, because it is useful, is slashed by others. These are all parables for those who cannot conceal themselves, who seek fame in the world and thus invite misfortune. Thus it is said: all people know the use of what is useful, but none know the use of what is useless.\n\nFrom the *Inner Chapters*, “Virtue’s Full Manifestation,” Chapter Five. *Fu* means resonance; what is within oneself can then resonate with what is without. To be full means that virtue is sufficient within oneself, and thus one responds appropriately to whatever arises. In Lu there was a crippled man, Wang Tai, whose followers were as numerous as Confucius’s. Chang Ji asked Confucius, “Wang Tai is a cripple, yet his followers are as many as yours, Master. He neither teaches when standing nor discusses when seated, yet those who go to him empty return full. Is there truly a teaching without words, a shaping of the heart without form? What sort of man is he?” Confucius said, “This master is a sage. I am merely a latecomer who has yet to visit him. I intend to take him as my teacher—how much more should those inferior to me? Why mention only Lu? I would lead the whole world to follow him.” Chang Ji said, “He is a cripple, yet he surpasses you, Master. Compared to ordinary people, the difference is even greater. If this is so, how does he employ his mind?” Chang Ji was a disciple of Confucius. “Half of Lu” means that half of the people of Lu followed Confucius, while the other half followed Tai. “Neither teaches when standing” means he stands with his disciples but teaches nothing; “nor discusses when seated” means he sits with his disciples but says nothing. Yet those who go to him empty return full—empty, having seen nothing, yet upon returning, they are replete with realization. “Without form” means nothing is seen; “heart is shaped” means the heart is moved and naturally transformed. Chang Ji, seeing this, thus questioned Confucius. Confucius said, referring to Wang Tai, “I merely intend to visit him, though I have been slow to do so. Even one such as I will take him as my teacher—how much more those beneath me? Why mention only Lu? I would lead the whole world to follow him.” “He is a cripple, yet he surpasses you, Master”—this phrase means he surpasses even the Master, and thus the difference with ordinary people is even greater. “Master” refers to Confucius; “ordinary people” means common folk. Confucius said, “Life and death are indeed great matters, yet they do not alter him.” “Life and death are indeed great matters...”",

      "translated_text": "\"These five characters—'Life and death are indeed great matters'—form a major thread in Zhuangzi, while the entire Buddhist canon emerges from them. What is meant by 'Life and death are matters as urgent as saving one’s head' is precisely this. 'Do not alter with them' means that though the changes of life and death are great, this heart remains unmoved and cannot be made to change with them. 'Do not' means 'cannot'; 'alter with them' means to change in accordance with them.\n\nThis saying is attributed to Confucius but is in fact Zhuangzi’s parable. Those who criticize it as heterodox claim that among all things, he fails to expound clearly, devoting his entire life to studying only this one matter—yet their critique is quite justified. However, the Buddhist teaching is precisely aimed at the ignorant and deluded, those mired in stupor and resistant to transformation; it uses fear to urge them toward goodness. Though its doctrine is flawed, its salvific intent is earnest. As Confucians, we cannot but refute its teachings, yet we must also understand its underlying purpose.\n\nThe Buddhists hold that of all things people fear, regardless of status, death is the greatest. Thus, they use it as leverage to compel entry into the Dao. Some say the Buddhists, fearing death, devised this teaching—yet they have lost sight of its true intent. Even if heaven and earth were to collapse, one would remain untouched, for one does not casually drift with external changes but guards the root amid the transformations of things. 'Heaven and earth collapsing' is a hyperbolic expression for the destruction of the cosmos. 'Untouched' means 'unfallen.' Thus, even if heaven and earth were to crumble, one would not fall with them—just as in the earlier saying, 'entering water without getting wet, entering fire without being burned.'\n\nThe language of the *Zhuangzi* differs from that of the *Analects* and *Mencius*, often employing exaggeration—this is simply its stylistic approach, not a claim that heaven and earth could truly collapse. 'Scrutinize' means to see clearly and thoroughly.\"",

      "translated_text": "The term \"无假\" means \"real.\" Such phrases exemplify the subtlety of Zhuangzi's diction and phrasing. If one were to say \"clear\" or \"real\" outright, the expression would become clumsy. \"Not drifting with things\" (不与物迁) is synonymous with \"not changing with them\" (不得与之变) and \"not falling with them\" (不与之遗). \"Commanding the transformations of things\" (命物之化) means that the transformations of the myriad things all receive their mandate from me—akin to the Chan saying, \"When the mind is deluded, the *Dharma Flower* turns; when the mind awakens, the *Dharma Flower* turns.\"\n\n\"宗\" refers to the origin of the myriad things. \"Guarding the origin\" (守其宗) means that what this person guards lies in the beginning of the myriad things—just as the earlier passage spoke of \"having a beginning\" (有始), \"having not yet begun to have a beginning\" (有未始有始), and so on. In Zhuangzi's text, a term like \"宗\" may be glossed as \"beginning,\" but to grasp its full meaning, one must see that it signifies more than just \"beginning.\" Only then does its profundity become apparent. \"Guarding the origin\" is the whole substance; \"wandering in its harmony\" (游其和) is its great function.\n\nChangji asked, \"What does this mean?\" Confucius replied: \"Viewed from their differences, liver and gall are as distant as Chu and Yue; viewed from their sameness, the myriad things are all one.\" Ordinary people do not understand that the myriad things share a single origin. Though liver and gall may seem as distinct as Chu and Yue, knowing that they share a single origin means that the myriad things are all one with me. Observe how these two sentences pivot in their phrasing—many skilled writers before and after have employed this device. Zhuangzi's text is not only profound in its principles but also unparalleled in its literary craft, surpassing all other masters.\n\nIf this is so, then one no longer knows what is fitting for the ears and eyes but roams the mind in the harmony of virtue. The ears are for hearing, the eyes for seeing—yet one who can do this does not merely listen with the ears or see with the eyes. This is what Chan calls \"the six senses arising from a single source.\" How can one \"observe\" and yet be called \"Guanyin\" (Observer of Sounds)? Though this is the language of heterodoxy, it carries deep meaning. \"The harmony of virtue\" (德之和) is one with heaven, earth, and the four seasons. This \"harmony\" is not the \"harmony\" of the *Doctrine of the Mean*, which speaks of moderation. To read this text, one must possess a different eye.\n\nThings are seen in their unity, not in what they have lost. To see the loss of a foot as if discarding dirt—this is to regard things in their unity without seeing what they have lost. It means observing the myriad things without deficiency or excess, which aligns with the earlier passage about the millipede. This is Zhuangzi’s reversal of Gongwen Xuan’s dialogue with Jie Yu. \"Discarding dirt\" means to cast it away unknowingly, as if it were mere soil.\n\nChangji said: \"He cultivates himself (为己) by using his knowledge to attain his mind, and by using his mind to attain his constant mind. Why then do people value him so highly?\" \"Cultivating oneself\" means refining one’s person. \"Using his knowledge\" means that with this discernment, one can cultivate the self. \"Attaining his mind\" means that with this aware mind, one attains the original mind. The original mind and the aware mind are not two separate things; this phrasing is merely a way of speaking. The underlying meaning is that all people possess knowledge and all possess minds. If one can fully realize them, one can cultivate the self and attain the mind—this is an ordinary matter. Thus, it is said, \"attaining the constant mind.\" \"Most\" (最) means \"to honor.\" It does not say \"honor\" but \"most\"—this is what makes Zhuangzi’s writing so extraordinary. \"Things\" (物) refers to other people.\n\nConfucius said: \"People do not mirror themselves in flowing water but in still water. Only stillness can still the many.\" Flowing water is a metaphor for the mind that cannot be stilled; still water, for the mind that can. Stilling the mind is what makes one uniquely worthy among people. The multitude seek stillness by pursuing their desires, but only this person can truly do so. Thus, it is said, \"Only stillness can still the many.\" These words describe those who have not yet settled their minds but seek instruction from him—he can teach them to attain stillness. Is this phrasing not extraordinary? This is akin to the Chan saying: \"Bring me your mind, and I will settle it for you.\" The student says, \"I seek my mind but cannot find it.\" The master replies, \"I have settled your mind for you.\" This is the essence of that exchange.\n\n\"Receiving its mandate from the earth, only the pine and cypress remain verdant in winter and summer.\" \"Receiving its mandate from heaven, only Shun is upright.\" Fortunate in his uprightness, he can rectify his life and thereby rectify the lives of others. The pine and cypress are compared to Shun, and Shun to Wang Tai. It speaks only of their unique endowment from heaven, which enables them to rectify their own lives and thereby rectify the lives of others. Here, \"life\" (生) is synonymous with \"nature\" (性). Some may ask, \"How can Shun be compared to Wang Tai?\" To read Zhuangzi in this way is to speak dreams before a fool.\n\nThe proof of preserving the beginning lies in the reality of fearlessness. A single brave warrior, charging alone into nine armies, seeks fame and can hold fast to himself—yet even he is like this. \"Proof\" (征) means evidence; \"verification\" (验) means confirmation. \"Preserving\" (保) means guarding. To guard the original word and have evidence and verification is simply a matter of trust. Without this \"reality\" (实), one cannot be fearless. \"Nine armies\" refers to a multitude of soldiers; perhaps during the Warring States period, there was a formation of nine ranks—this need not be confined to the conventional six armies of the Son of Heaven or the three armies of the feudal lords. \"Holding fast to oneself\" means self-trust. Jing Ke and Nie Zheng were those who sought fame and trusted themselves. If even they, who guarded this single trust, could remain unchanged in life and death, how much more so for one who embodies the Way? In Buddhist texts, one finds those who sit on python rocks or guard tiger dens—this, too, is merely the reality of fearlessness. Zhuangzi’s passages like this are not mere allegories but are based on actual observations.\n\n\"Moreover, to govern heaven and earth, to store the myriad things, to lodge in the six limbs, to model the ears and eyes, to unify knowledge in what is known—is the mind not already dead in such a case?\" \"Governing heaven and earth\" means heaven covers and earth bears, each fulfilling its office. \"Storing\" (府) means gathering; the myriad things gather according to their kind. This is the same idea as \"heaven and earth are born with me, and the myriad things are one with me.\" Mencius said, \"The myriad things are all complete within me\"—this, too, is the idea of storing the myriad things, though the phrasing differs. \"Lodging in the six limbs\" means the six limbs are where I reside. \"Modeling the ears and eyes\" is akin to the earlier passage about \"what is fitting for the ears and eyes.\" The eyes model the eyes but are not limited to seeing; the ears model the ears but are not limited to hearing. Thus, it is said, \"modeling the ears and eyes.\" \"Unifying knowledge in what is known\"—the first \"knowledge\" (知) is pronounced *zhi* (wisdom), the second as *zhi* (to know). Wisdom is what is received from nature; knowledge is the function of wisdom. Because it is received from heaven, there is nothing it does not know. Thus, it is called \"unifying knowledge in what is known.\" The mind that perceives nothing is called \"dead.\"",
      "overlap_context": "the destruction of the cosmos. 'Untouched' means 'unfallen.' Thus, even if heaven and earth were to crumble, one would not fall with them—just as in the earlier saying, 'entering water without getting wet, entering fire without being burned.'\n\nThe language of the *Zhuangzi* differs from that of the *Analects* and *Mencius*, often employing exaggeration—this is simply its stylistic approach, not a claim that heaven and earth could truly collapse. 'Scrutinize' means to see clearly and thoroughly.\"",

      "translated_text": "He, then, chooses a day to ascend and reach the ultimate—this is to follow the Way. \"Ascend\" means to rise; \"reach\" means to arrive. The annotations pronounce *jia* as *gu* or *xia*, both incorrect. How could he choose a day to attain the Dao? It means he does not select a day to ascend and reach the Dao, for the Dao is present at all times—this is the idea that the Dao cannot be departed from even for an instant. The reason people follow Wang Tai in their learning is simply to follow the Way.\n\nThis \"is\" (*shi*) is emphatic. \"To take things as affairs\"—\"things\" here refer to people. How could he be willing to take others as his concern? For people seek learning from him; he never seeks to teach others.\n\nShentu Jia was a man who had lost his foot, yet he studied under Bohun Wuren alongside Zichan of Zheng. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay.\" The next day, they again sat together in the same hall on the same mat. Zichan said to Shentu Jia, \"If I leave first, you stay; if you leave first, I stay. Now, I am about to leave—can you stay? Or is it that when you see an official, you do not yield? Do you consider yourself equal to an official?\"\n\nShentu Jia replied, \"In the Master’s gate, are there officials like this? You delight in your own official status and put others after yourself. I have heard that when a mirror is bright, dust does not settle; if dust settles, it is not bright. When one dwells long with the worthy, one commits no faults. Now, what you take as greatest is the Master, yet you still speak like this—is this not a fault? Zichan, you are already as you are; do you still compete with Yao in goodness? Are your virtue and power not enough to reflect upon yourself?\"\n\n\"I leave first, you stay; you leave first, I stay\"—he wished for them to avoid each other. Shentu Jia did not comply with this arrangement, for the non-compliant do not avoid. \"Equal\" means the same; \"official\" refers to himself. He says, \"If you and I go out together, you consider yourself equal to an official.\" \"Putting others after\" means putting oneself first. To put oneself first and others after is to value oneself and belittle others. One with learning has broad vision and understanding. \"Take\" means to seek. He says, \"You study under the Master to seek broadened vision and understanding, yet you remain so narrow-minded?\" The phrase \"take as greatest\" is excellent, and \"compete with Yao in goodness\" is most striking. He says, \"You have already lost a foot—even if you could do good, could you match Yao? 'Reflect upon yourself' means you overestimate your abilities.\"\n\nShentu Jia said, \"Those who describe their faults to claim they should not have lost their feet are many; those who do not describe their faults to claim they should not have kept their feet are few. Knowing there is nothing to be done and accepting it as fate—only those with virtue can do this. To wander within Yi’s drawn bow—'within' means the center of the target. Yet not being struck is a matter of fate. People with whole feet laugh at my incomplete foot in great numbers. I was enraged, but when I came to the Master’s place, my anger vanished, and I returned to myself. Did the Master not wash me with goodness? I have wandered with you for nineteen years, yet you have never known I was footless. Now, you wander with me within the form and body, yet you seek me outside the form and body—is this not a fault?\"\n\nZichan was startled, changed his expression, and altered his demeanor, saying, \"You need not speak further.\"\n\n\"Describe\" means to recount. Those who recount their faults to claim they should not have lost their feet are many; those who do not speak of their faults to claim they should not have kept their feet are rare. Only those with virtue know that all things have their fate—how can man do anything about it? These three sentences describe three kinds of people, as if fate were to follow its course.\n\nThe passage about wandering within the drawn bow is most extraordinary—this is what the *Yi* means by \"treading on a tiger’s tail.\" Laozi said, \"My greatest trouble is that I have a body.\" To use a tiger’s tail as a metaphor for life’s dangers is already striking, yet Zhuangzi says, \"within Yi’s drawn bow.\" \"Within the drawn bow\" is the place where the arrow’s tip is aimed—the very center of the target. No archer was better than Yi; the center of the drawn bow was where he was certain to strike. The world’s dangers are like this, and this saying is especially apt in the Warring States period. To be fortunate enough not to be struck is a matter of fate.\n\n\"Vanished\" means to lose oneself entirely. His anger had reached this point, yet it all disappeared upon returning. He says, \"Upon seeing the Master, I returned and lost all cause for anger.\" The word \"wash\" is excellent—it means the Master instructed him with goodness, as if cleansing him without his realizing it.\n\nThe phrases about \"within the form and body\" and \"outside the form and body\" are the best—such ideas are not found in earlier texts. \"Speak further\" means to praise his ability to speak, as in the *Zuozhuan*, where the people of Lu called someone \"quick-witted.\"\n\nThere was a footless man of Lu named Shushan Wuzhi who came to see Confucius on his heels. Confucius said, \"You were not careful before and have already suffered such misfortune. Though you come now, what can be done?\" Wuzhi said, \"I simply did not know my duty and lightly used my body, which is why I lost my foot. Now I come because there is still something worthy of respect remaining in me, and I wish to preserve it. The heavens cover all without exception; the earth bears all without exception. I took you, Master, to be like heaven and earth—how could I have known you would be like this?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Qiu is truly unworthy. Why do you not enter? Please speak of what you have heard.\" Wuzhi left. Confucius said, \"Disciples, exert yourselves! This man Wuzhi, though footless, still strives to learn to make up for the evil of his past conduct—how much more should those with whole virtue do so?\"\n\nWuzhi said to Lao Dan, \"Is Confucius not yet a perfected person? Why does he so diligently seek to learn from you? Does he hope to gain a reputation for the strange and marvelous, not knowing that the perfected person considers such things as his own shackles?\" Lao Dan said, \"Why not simply let him see that life and death are one thread, that right and wrong are one strand, and thus free him from his shackles—would that not be possible?\"\n\nWuzhi said, \"This is heaven’s punishment—how can it be freed?\"\n\n\"He came on his heels\"—*zhi* means to visit; \"not knowing one’s duty\" means not understanding affairs. \"Something worthy of respect\" refers to his nature. The phrase \"worthy of respect\" is strikingly put—what is to be valued lies not outside the form and body. \"Diligent\" (*binbin*)—Sima Biao explains this as a respectful appearance. \"Strange and marvelous\" refers only to a love of fame. \"His own shackles\" means fame is a burden to oneself. \"Heaven’s punishment\" means heaven does not grant him the Dao.\n\nZhuangzi uses Confucius as a mouthpiece, sometimes restraining him, sometimes exalting him—all is allegory. Yet in this passage, he says, \"This man Wuzhi, though footless, still strives to learn to make up for the evil of his past conduct—how much more should those with whole virtue do so?\" These words are also beneficial to the world’s teachings. \"Life and death as one thread, right and wrong as one strand\" echoes the ideas in the \"Equalizing Things\" chapter—\"Is it acceptable? Is it not acceptable?\"",

      "translated_text": "Duke Ai of Lu asked Confucius, saying: \"In Wei there is an ugly man named Aitai Tuo. Men who live with him grow attached and cannot bear to leave. Women who see him say to their parents, 'Rather than be another man’s wife, I would be his concubine'—there are more than ten such cases, and the number does not cease. He has never been heard to take the lead in speech, only to harmonize. He holds no lordly position to bring order to others, nor does he amass wealth to fill men’s bellies. Moreover, his ugliness startles all under heaven. He harmonizes but does not lead; his knowledge does not extend beyond the four quarters. Yet when male and female gather before him, there must be something extraordinary in this man. I summoned and observed him: indeed, his ugliness startled all under heaven. Yet after living with me for less than a month, I began to take notice of him. Before a year had passed, I trusted him. As my state had no chief minister, I wished to entrust him with governance. He responded with reluctance, as if declining, and I felt ashamed. In the end, I handed over the state to him. Before long, he left me and departed, and I felt as though I had lost something, as though there were no one with whom to share the joy of ruling this state. What manner of man is this?\"\n\n\"An ugly man\" refers to one whose form is repulsive. \"He does not lead, only harmonizes\" means he does nothing to assert himself. \"He holds no lordly position\" means he lacks noble authority. \"Amasses wealth\" refers to riches; \"fills men’s bellies\" means to satiate, to fill to the full—like the moon at its fullest, called *wang*. Observe how Zhuangzi wields his brush in such passages—who could match it? \"His knowledge does not extend beyond the four quarters\" means his understanding does not transcend the world. \"Male and female gather before him\" suggests his closeness with all things, akin to the idea of gulls that are not startled. \"Responded with reluctance\" means he answered without intent. *Fan* implies detachment, without attachment. \"I felt ashamed\" means I felt humiliated. \"Handed over the state\" means I entrusted him with governance. \"Felt as though I had lost something\" echoes the Han king’s lament, \"like losing one’s right and left hands.\"\n\nConfucius said: \"When I was once sent on a mission to Chu, I happened to see young pigs nursing from their dead mother. After a little while, they glanced about, then all abandoned her and fled, for they no longer saw their mother in her. What they loved was not her form, but what animated her form. When warriors die in battle, their burials do not include funeral fans. When a man’s feet are cut off, no one cherishes his shoes—neither has any use for the other. This is because the root is gone. The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears. When a man takes a wife, she remains outside and is no longer employed in service. Even those with whole bodies are thus valued—how much more so those with whole virtue? Now Aitai Tuo has not spoken, yet he is trusted; he has done no deeds, yet he is beloved. He makes men offer him a state, only fearing he will not accept. This must be one whose talent is whole and whose virtue is unmanifest.\"\n\nThe analogy of the young pigs illustrates that love and aversion do not lie in the beauty or ugliness of form. *Shun ruo* describes their startled appearance. \"No longer see their mother in her\" means she no longer resembles her former self. *Yi shen* refers to her body, meaning they no longer see her as she was before, hence their reaction. These are all flourishes of Zhuangzi’s brush. The idea that \"what they loved was what animated her form\"—if judged by the standards of conventional morality, this statement would be gravely offensive. Yet it reflects the ancient principle of \"serving the dead as one serves the living,\" not bearing to see one’s kin dead. Such passages are exaggerated in their expression; one must not judge them by such standards, nor remain ignorant of their intent.\n\n\"Warriors who die in battle do not use funeral fans\"—this is not a proper ritual observance. *Sha* refers to the objects used. \"A man whose feet are cut off has no use for shoes\"—external adornments have no place here. This too illustrates the idea that virtue lies within, not without. \"The consorts of the Son of Heaven do not cut their nails or pierce their ears\"—they do not adorn themselves, preserving their natural form. \"When a man takes a wife, she remains outside and is no longer employed in service\"—this refers to the *Record of Rites*, which states that newly married women are exempt from service, meaning they are not to be employed in the palace. This analogy of preserving the whole form illustrates the meaning of whole virtue.\n\nDuke Ai said: \"What do you mean by 'talent whole'?\"\nConfucius said: \"Life and death, existence and extinction, failure and success, poverty and wealth, worthiness and unworthiness, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—these are the changes of affairs, the movements of fate. They follow one another day and night before us, yet knowledge cannot fathom their beginnings. Therefore, they are not sufficient to disturb harmony or enter the sacred chamber of the mind. Make it so that one is harmonious, joyful, and flowing without losing the state of delight; make it so that day and night there is no interruption, and one joins with things in springtime. This is what it means to respond and give rise to the timely within the heart. This is called 'talent whole.'\"\n\nThis passage culminates in the phrase \"talent whole, virtue unmanifest.\" Earlier, it was said that even life and death, though great, do not cause one to change; here, it enumerates life and death, existence and extinction, failure and success, poverty and wealth, slander and praise, hunger and thirst, cold and heat—all together—to prevent any elaboration from exceeding the point. *Gui* means to seek. These are the changes of affairs and the movements of fate, succeeding one another day and night before our eyes. Even the wise cannot seek their beginnings; one can only say they occur naturally. \"Not sufficient to disturb harmony\" means they cannot disrupt the harmony within the breast. \"Not enter the sacred chamber of the mind\" means they do not move the heart. \"Harmonious, joyful, flowing\"—these three words share a single meaning: *yu* means joy, *tong* means unobstructed. If the heart is unmoved, it naturally becomes harmonious, joyful, and flowing without losing its delight. *Dui* also means delight. This sentence captures the essence of Zhuangzi’s writing—\"harmonious, joyful, flowing\" is akin to saying \"all-pervading and complete,\" as seen in later passages. \"Day and night without interruption\" means ever-renewing, without cessation. *Que* means to stop. \"Joins with things in springtime\" means that wherever one dwells, there is joy. *Wu* refers to things. This \"spring\" is akin to *dui* (delight). \"Respond and give rise to the timely within the heart\" echoes the Buddhist sutras' \"abiding nowhere yet giving rise to the heart.\" *Jie* means to be moved; *shi* means the timely, as in \"timely action.\" Responding to the movements of affairs without bias or stagnation—this is called \"giving rise to the timely within the heart.\" *Cai* means substance, as in Mencius' \"Heaven bestows substance.\" \"Talent whole\" means preserving one’s innate nature in its entirety.\n\n\"What do you mean by 'virtue unmanifest'?\"\n\"The level is the fullness of still water. It can serve as a model. Within, it is preserved, and without, it does not sway. Virtue is the cultivation of completed harmony. 'Virtue unmanifest' means things cannot depart from it.\"\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Minzi of this, saying: \"Alas! I, facing south as the ruler of all under heaven, holding the people’s guiding principle, and worrying over their deaths, believed myself to be thoroughly enlightened. Now I have heard the words of a perfected man, and I fear I lack the substance. I have lightly used my person and nearly lost my state. I and Confucius are not ruler and subject—we are friends in virtue.\"",

To wholly preserve the harmony within one’s nature is the cultivation of virtue. \"Virtue unmanifest\" follows things and appears in them, meaning there is nowhere it does not go and no single aspect by which it can be named. Thus, it is said, \"Virtue unmanifest is what things cannot depart from.\"\n\nThe phrase \"holding the people’s guiding principle\" is excellent—it is precisely the handle of governing the state. \"Worrying over their deaths\" means the ability to cherish the people. How could Duke Ai truly \"face south as the ruler of all under heaven\"? These are all instances where Zhuangzi’s brush overreaches, failing to attend to proper bounds. \"Not ruler and subject—friends in virtue\" shares the same intent as Mencius’ \"befriending,\" both being allegorical and not to be taken literally.\n\nYǐnqí, the hunchbacked man with no lips, spoke to Duke Ling of Wei, who delighted in him and, looking upon whole men, saw their necks as too thick. The man with a large goiter spoke to Duke Huan of Qi, who delighted in him and, looking upon whole men, saw their necks as too slender. Thus, virtue may excel while form is forgotten. People do not forget what they forget but forget what they should not forget—this is called \"true forgetting.\"\n\nYǐnqí means a crooked back; *zhīlí* describes a stooped appearance; *wúshèn* means lipless. A hunched, lipless man is exceedingly ugly. *Jiānjiān* describes a slender, elongated appearance; *wèngfáng* refers to a large goiter. These two lines illustrate how people’s likes and dislikes lie beyond physical form: the hunchbacked and goitered men found favor with their lords, who, looking upon whole men, saw them as inferior. Thus, it is said, \"virtue may excel while form is forgotten.\" People do not forget what they forget but forget what they should not forget. These two lines are superb, echoing Mencius’ analogy of \"one finger being inferior to others.\" What can be forgotten is form; what cannot be forgotten is virtue. \"True forgetting\" is genuine forgetting—knowing form but not knowing virtue is true forgetting.\n\nTherefore, the sage wanders in knowledge, yet it becomes a snare; in cleverness, yet it becomes glue; in virtue, yet it becomes a bond; in skill, yet it becomes trade. The sage does not scheme—why use knowledge? Does not carve—why use cleverness? Suffers no loss—why use virtue? Does not barter—why use skill? These four are the heavenly market.\n\nThe heavenly market.",
      "overlap_context": "eted harmony. 'Virtue unmanifest' means things cannot depart from it.\"\n\nAnother day, Duke Ai told Minzi of this, saying: \"Alas! I, facing south as the ruler of all under heaven, holding the people’s guiding principle, and worrying over their deaths, believed myself to be thoroughly enlightened. Now I have heard the words of a perfected man, and I fear I lack the substance. I have lightly used my person and nearly lost my state. I and Confucius are not ruler and subject—we are friends in virtue.\"",

      "translated_text": "The heavenly market is the heavenly sustenance. Having received sustenance from Heaven, why rely on man? The sage wanders—this wandering is what is meant by \"the mind wandering in Heaven.\" *Zhi* (knowledge, pronounced in the falling tone) is using wisdom to handle affairs. *Yue* (restraint) is self-discipline through ritual. *Gong* (skill) is craftsmanship. *Nie* is calamity; *jiao* is glue, fixation. *Jie* is attachment to externals while forgetting the internal. *Shang* is trade, as in \"buying reputation under Heaven.\" When the mind wanders in Heaven, one knows these four are all burdens. The sage schemes not in the world, so does not use wisdom; carves not, so does not need restraint; guards the internal and has no concern for externals, so does not rely on virtue; seeks not to sell, so does not employ skill. These four—no scheming, no carving, no loss, no bartering—are the heavenly market, the heavenly sustenance, the heavenly emolument. It is like the heavenly nobility: having received sustenance from Heaven, why seek human titles? The phrase \"attachment gives rise to the times in one’s heart\" means that when talent is whole and virtue does not manifest, the wisdom known by knowledge—all three characters in the earlier passage were good, but here \"attachment\" and \"virtue\" and \"wisdom\" become bad. This is the brush dancing, not heeding consistency before and after, which is why it is a heterodox text.\n\nOne has the form of man but not the passions of man. Having the form of man, one mingles with others; lacking the passions of man, right and wrong do not adhere to the self. How small—thus belonging to man! How great—thus completing one’s Heaven alone! Huizi asked Zhuangzi, \"Do men truly have no passions?\" Zhuangzi said, \"Yes.\" Huizi said, \"If a man has no passions, how can he be called a man?\" Zhuangzi said, \"The Dao gives him appearance, Heaven gives him form—how can he not be called a man?\" Huizi said, \"If he is called a man, how can he have no passions?\" Zhuangzi said, \"This is not what I mean by passions. What I mean by having no passions is that man does not inwardly harm his self with likes and dislikes, always following nature without artificially enhancing life.\" Huizi said, \"If one does not enhance life, how can one have a self?\" Zhuangzi said, \"The Dao gives him appearance, Heaven gives him form—do not inwardly harm your self with likes and dislikes. Now you, your spirit is externalized, your essence is wearied. Leaning against a tree, you chant; resting on a withered catalpa, you doze. Heaven selected your form, yet you cry out with ‘hard and white’—this is mere disputation.\"\n\nThis passage is Zhuangzi’s dialogue with Huizi. The lines beginning \"One has the form of man\" are Zhuangzi’s usual words, which Huizi then questioned. \"Mingling with others\" means being in the same flock as men. \"Right and wrong do not adhere to the self\" means there is no entry that does not bring self-possession, transcending right and wrong, alone completing one’s Heaven and becoming Heaven’s companion. If man can be external to right and wrong, with no entry that does not bring self-possession, then he becomes Heaven’s companion, and his achievement is great. \"Heaven gives him form\" is having a thing. \"The Dao gives him appearance\" means things must have their principles. What I mean by \"having no passions\" is that man does not inwardly harm his self with the passions of likes and dislikes. If there is enhancement, there is harm; if one always follows nature, there is neither enhancement nor harm. To speak of excess and deficiency is to speak of illness—enhancing life is the illness of excess. If likes and dislikes arise from nature and do not cling, then there is neither harm nor enhancement. Huizi said, \"If one does not enhance life, how can one have a self?\"—this takes enhancing life as the means to sustain life, which is not Zhuangzi’s intent. Zhuangzi and Huizi were the closest of friends; Huizi was broadly learned and fond of debate, so Zhuangzi mocked him for externalizing his spirit and wearying his essence. \"Externalizing the spirit\" means the spirit is used externally, like a spirit not guarding its abode. *Gaowu* is a withered catalpa used as a table. *Ming* means weariness. *Jianbai* is the name of a debate. *Xuan* means selection, appointment. It says: Heaven bestowed your form, yet you torment yourself thus—why? Just for one \"cry\" of disputation, Han Yu drew from this to compose a preface, praising its marvel.

      "translated_text": "*The Imperial Four Treasuries Edition*\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll 3\n*By Lin Xiyi of the Song Dynasty*\n\n**Inner Chapters: The Great and Venerable Master (Chapter Six)**\n\n\"The Great and Venerable Master\" is the Dao—just as the sage emulates Heaven, Heaven emulates the Dao, and the Dao emulates spontaneity. To know what Heaven does and to know what man does is perfection.\n\nTo know what Heaven does is to be Heaven-born. To know what man does is to use what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know, thus fulfilling one’s natural lifespan without dying prematurely midway—this is the fullness of knowledge.\n\nYet there is a danger: knowledge depends on something external to be fitting, but what it depends on is inherently uncertain. How can we be sure that what I call \"Heaven\" is not \"man,\" or that what I call \"man\" is not \"Heaven\"? Only with the true person does true knowledge arise.\n\nMan’s life arises from Heaven, hence it is said: \"what Heaven does.\" Yet dwelling in the world, there are human affairs one must fulfill, hence it is said: \"what man does.\" When human affairs are complete, Heavenly principle appears. Thus, one uses what one’s knowledge knows to nourish what one’s knowledge does not know. Not exhausting oneself to harm life, it is said: \"fulfilling one’s natural lifespan.\" Knowing both Heaven and man, it is said: \"the fullness of knowledge.\"\n\nThese words are quite correct, yet the turn beginning with \"though there is a danger\" is especially subtle. \"Knowledge depends on something external to be fitting\"—knowledge resides in me, but what it depends on lies outside. Sometimes one attains without seeking, sometimes one must seek to attain—neither can be determined in advance. \"Fitting\" means both \"certain\" and \"appropriate.\" Only after a matter is settled does its appropriateness or inappropriateness become clear. This single word is used with great skill. If one believes something comes from Heaven yet must seek to obtain it, or if one believes it comes from man yet sometimes seeks in vain, this is what is meant by \"how can we be sure that Heaven is not man, or man is not Heaven?\"\n\nFor example, longevity and premature death are both fated—nothing is not destiny. Yet it is also said: \"Those who know destiny do not stand beneath a crumbling wall.\" Here we see the uncertainty in what Heaven does and what man does. Zhuangzi’s observation of worldly affairs is most precise; such passages demand careful reflection.\n\n\"Only with the true person does true knowledge arise\"—this speaks of one who embodies the Dao.\n\nWhat is a true person? The true persons of old did not resist the few, did not boast of their accomplishments, and did not scheme. If they erred, they did not regret; if they succeeded, they did not take pride. If they ascended heights, they did not tremble; if they entered water, they were not drenched; if they entered fire, they were not burned. Such is the knowledge that ascends to the Dao.\n\n\"Not resist the few\"—lack is not a deficiency; it means not opposing the natural course. When times are insufficient, one simply follows them. \"Did not boast of their accomplishments\"—though they succeeded, they did not take it as a boast. *Xiong* means boasting. *Shi* (士) is interchangeable with *shi* (事), as in the *Ode to Dongshan*: \"Do not *shi* the marching ranks.\" *Mo* means scheming—acting without intention, hence \"did not scheme.\" \"If they erred, they did not regret\"—*guo* means error, like today’s \"misstep.\" \"If they succeeded, they did not take pride\"—*dang* means fitting, like today’s \"just right.\" Success is not taken as self-satisfaction. Whether things went wrong or right, all was entrusted to spontaneity: not regretting failure, not rejoicing in success.\n\n\"Ascended heights without trembling, entered water without being drenched, entered fire without being burned\"—this is to be unobstructed in all situations. \"Knowledge that ascends to the Dao\"—their insight deeply penetrated the Dao. The two \"if so\" phrases demonstrate Zhuangzi’s literary style. *Zhi* is interchangeable with *zhi* (wisdom). *Jia* means to reach.\n\nThe true persons of old slept without dreaming and woke without worry. Their food was not savory, and their breath was deep. The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the common person’s breath reaches only the throat. Those who submit in fear have throats that sound like retching; those with deep desires have shallow Heavenly mechanism.\n\nTheir sleep was dreamless—spirit settled.",

      "translated_text": "The so-called \"true person is dreamless\"—this is what it means. \"Their waking is without worry\"—they engage with the world yet do not contend with the heart-mind. \"Their food is not savory\"—they have no intent to sate hunger, akin to the Chan practice of \"filling the hunger wound.\" \"Their breath is deep\"—the true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the common person’s reaches only the throat. This is the origin of Daoist cultivation discourse. When the spirit is settled, the breath in its egress and ingress is deep, rising from the heels to the mouth and nose—hence the method of *shuxi* (breath-counting). Without nurturing the spirit, the breath in its egress and ingress halts at the throat alone. Stillness and agitation differ, and what manifests in the body is seen as retching. *Ai* (嗌) means the throat; *yan* (咽) means to swallow. Without true insight, speech remains on the lips, making one easily submissive to others. This line reveals the flavor of Zhuangzi’s words, as in the Chan saying: \"The frog Chan leaps but once\"—just as retching is easily subdued. \"Desires\" are human desires; \"Heavenly mechanism\" is Heavenly principle. \"Deep and shallow\" refer to the waxing and waning of Heavenly principle and human desire, as the ancients put it. This passage, line by line, is a thread running through Daoist and Buddhist texts alike, showing how this elder’s self-attainment cannot be read carelessly. Alas, we do not see Dahui, Zhang Pingshu, or others debate this with him.\n\nThe true persons of old neither delighted in life nor abhorred death. They emerged without precaution and entered without resistance, departing with ease and arriving with ease. They did not forget their origin nor seek their end. They received and rejoiced in it, forgot and returned to it—this is called \"not using the heart-mind to harm the Dao\" and \"not relying on others to assist Heaven.\" This is the true person. This passage speaks only of life and death: emerging from life, entering death. \"Departing with ease and arriving with ease\"—not forgetting the origin, not seeking the end—this is what is meant by \"tracing the beginning to grasp the end, thus knowing the discourse on life and death.\" Someone asked Master Zhaozhou, \"Where will you go after a hundred years?\" He replied, \"After the fire burns out, it becomes a stalk of thatch\"—this is not seeking the end. \"Receiving\"—receiving one’s form, bestowed by Heaven—how could one not rejoice? \"Returning\"—returning whole, without attachment—hence \"forgetting and returning.\" \"Not using the heart-mind to harm the Dao\" means the heart-mind *is* the Dao; there is no Dao outside the heart-mind. \"Not relying on others to assist Heaven\" means longevity and early death are fated; human effort cannot add to it. These ten words deserve careful reading. \"Not harming\" means not departing from it even for a moment.\n\nIf so, their heart-mind is steadfast, their countenance serene, their brow prominent. They are chill like autumn, warm like spring. Joy and anger flow with the four seasons, harmonizing with things without fixed limit. *Zhi* (志) means having a settled intent. The meaning of words in this text cannot be sought through the methods of the *Analects* or *Mencius*. The ancients said: \"Buddhism speaks of nature but only addresses the heart-mind—since it is already heterodox, how can we seek the meaning of words in our texts through it?\" \"Serene\"—like the nineteen years of facing the wall. This is the serenity of their countenance. *Kui* (頯) means large; *sang* (颡) means the forehead. Their head is held upright, revealing their prominent brow. \"Chill\" is anger; \"warm\" is joy. Joy and anger arise without intent, like the seasons of spring and autumn. \"Limit\" means the point of cessation. \"Things\" means affairs. They respond to affairs, each fitting its measure, without a fixed place of cessation—this is what is meant by \"engaging with things to give rise to the times of the heart-mind.\"\n\nThus, when the sage employs troops, he may destroy a state yet not lose the people’s hearts. His beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet he is not called loving. Employing troops poisons the world; bestowing beneficence loves the world—both are enacted without intent. Thus, those whose states are destroyed do not resent him, and those who receive his virtue say, \"What has the Emperor’s power to do with me?\" Our texts also contain this idea, but Zhuangzi’s brush, in its vivid portrayal, goes too far. For example, \"beneficence extending to ten thousand generations yet not called benevolent\" and \"governing the myriad things yet not called righteous\"—all belong to this vein.\n\nTherefore, one who delights in harmonizing with things is not a sage; one who has partiality is not benevolent; one who follows the seasons is not worthy; one who does not penetrate profit and harm is not a gentleman; one who acts for fame loses the self and is not a scholar; one who destroys the self is not true and is not a servant of others. Those like Huxie, Wuguang, Boyi, Shuqi, Jizi, Wu Xuyu, Ji Ta, Shentu Di—these are servants of others, conforming to others’ ways and not attaining their own. This passage satirizes the sages and worthies to illustrate the unattainability of the true person. Its meaning is that in a world without true persons, none from the sages downward—great or small—are genuine.\n\n\"Delighting in harmonizing with things\"—the sage’s heart-mind takes joy in nothing not finding its place. To be content with things’ prosperity or decline and take joy in this is insufficient to be a sage. Without intent, there is no near or far; with near and far, there is intent. With intent, it is not benevolence. \"Following the seasons\"—acting in accord with the times—is what the worthy take as ability, yet it is not. \"Penetrating profit and avoiding harm\"—the gentleman can do this, but if he cannot unite profit and harm as one, he is still not a gentleman. The scholar must act for fame; fame is the guest of reality. To act for the guest is to lose the self—hence, not a scholar. \"True\" means natural. Not knowing the natural and laboring to destroy the self is to be enslaved by others, not to enslave others. These are all excessive arguments. Thus, from Huxie downward—like Boyi, Shuqi, and Jizi—all are mocked as enslaved by others and losing the self. Hence, \"not attaining their own way.\" Though the words are biased, the writing is marvelous. Huxie, Wuguang, Xuyu, Ji Ta, and Shentu Di were all worthies of old who did not attain their own way.\n\nThe true persons of old had a demeanor of righteousness yet no cliques, appearing insufficient yet not obsequious. Their edges were sharp yet not rigid, their vastness empty yet not ostentatious. Cheerful, as if pleased; towering, as if compelled; expansive, offering their countenance; yielding, halting their virtue. Stern, as if worldly; aloof, as if uncontrollable; boundless, as if fond of seclusion; forgetful, as if losing their words. They took punishment as their body, ritual as their wings, wisdom as their time, virtue as their path. Taking punishment as their body—they were lenient in their severity. Taking ritual as their wings—they used it to move through the world. Taking wisdom as their time—they acted when unavoidable. Taking virtue as their path—they spoke of it as having feet, reaching the hills, yet others truly took them as diligent practitioners.",

Their food was not savory, and their breath was deep. The true person’s breath reaches the heels, while the common person’s breath reaches only the throat. Those who submit in fear have throats that sound like retching; those with deep desires have shallow Heavenly mechanism.\n\nTheir sleep was dreamless—spirit settled.",

      "translated_text": "This passage of metaphorical description contains moments of warmth and purity, yet its expressions are too vast and boundless—such depictions abound in Buddhist texts.\n\n\"Virtuous yet not cliquish\" means standing alone without leaning to either side. \"Cheerful, as if insufficient yet not obsequious\"—*kànrán* suggests a sense of inadequacy without self-debasement; *chéng* in *Zuǒzhuàn* means \"to assist,\" here denoting compliance with a humble demeanor. *Yúhū* describes a leisurely bearing. *Gū* refers to the corners of virtue. \"Sharp yet not rigid\" means possessing the edges of virtue without harsh angles. *Zhānghū* conveys an expansive, unconstrained appearance. \"Empty\" means having the substance of nothingness; \"not ostentatious\" means being substantial. *Bǐngbǐng* describes a joyful countenance, seeming pleased yet not truly so. *Cuīhū* implies an unavoidable response to worldly affairs, much like acting only after hesitation. *Chùhū* means to gather or accumulate, describing a flourishing, radiant presence—its vitality manifesting in one’s countenance, hence \"offering their countenance.\" \"Halting their virtue\" refers to the auspicious stillness of an empty chamber, where stillness itself is the stopping point. *Yúhū* conveys a self-contented demeanor. \"Stern\" suggests solemn resolve, appearing worldly in its severity, yet within lies the unavoidable truth of *cuīhū*. Thus, it is said to resemble the world. *Áohū* implies grandeur, unyielding to worldly constraints, hence \"uncontrollable.\" \"Fond of seclusion\" means reluctance to speak; *liánhū* suggests closeness and secrecy. Before speaking, one seems unwilling to utter a word; after speaking, it is as if nothing was said—hence \"forgetful, as if losing their words.\" These two phrases convey a single idea: *mèn* describes a lowered, humble posture.\n\n\"Taking punishment as their body\"—the body is the foundation; \"wings\" are attachments. The sage says, \"Understand the five punishments to assist the five teachings,\" while here it is framed inversely: punishment as the root, ritual as the adjunct. *Chuòhū* describes leniency in severity, ensuring no discord with one’s heart. \"Moving through the world\" means using ritual to navigate custom. \"Time\" refers to employing wisdom—acting only when unavoidable in response to affairs. \"Following virtue\" means adhering to the natural power of heaven, effortlessly and without force. It is like climbing a small hill: those with feet can reach it on their own, yet others assume it requires strenuous effort. This illustrates the effortless attainment of the Way. A hill is a small mountain.\n\nThus, whether one favors or disfavors something, it is one and the same—unity in its singularity, yet also in its lack of unity. To be one is to align with heaven; to lack unity is to align with humanity. Heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—this is the mark of the true person. \"One\" signifies spontaneity, the workings of creation. Favor and disfavor are simply likes and dislikes. Unity lies in their sameness; lack of unity in their difference. Yet both like and dislike exist within the bounds of creation, hence \"its unity\" and \"its lack of unity.\" One who unifies likes and dislikes understands heaven; one who sees them as distinct understands only humanity. To let humanity overcome heaven is impossible, as is letting heaven overcome humanity. The true person has no likes or dislikes, no distinctions between heaven and humanity, but simply follows the natural course. This is what the Buddhists call \"abandoning both existence and nonexistence,\" and what Laozi refers to as \"both returning to the mystery.\" Thus, it is said that heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—this is the unity of both one and not-one. \"One\" is the great master.\n\nLife and death are like the alternation of night and day—a constant of heaven. That which humans cannot control is the nature of all things. They revere heaven as a father and cherish their own bodies—how much more should they value that which transcends even this? They consider having a ruler better than having none and willingly die for such a ruler—how much more should they value the true? Life and death are like day and night, as the *Yìjīng* says: \"Understand the Way of day and night, and you will know.\" *Qíng* (nature) is reality—the inherent principle of heaven and earth, of the myriad things, beyond human control. This is called fate, called heaven. These lines clarify the meaning of \"one and not-one\" through the inevitability of life and death. Father and ruler are the most revered and beloved in the human world, yet the greatness of the Way surpasses even them. Thus, it is said that the Way can serve as the father of all fathers, for within it resides the true ruler—*zhuó*, lofty and unattainable; *zhēn*, the natural. These words remind us that while people know rulers and fathers, they fail to recognize the Way as the great master.\n\nWhen springs dry up, fish find themselves stranded on land, moistening one another with breath, wetting one another with foam. Yet is it not better to forget one another in the rivers and lakes? Rather than praising Yao and condemning Jie, it is better to forget both and be transformed by the Way. The great clod bears me in form, labors me in life, eases me in old age, and rests me in death. Thus, to perfect my life is to perfect my death.\n\n*Xiāngxǔ* and *xiāngrú* describe fish facing one another, moistening each other with breath and foam. Stranded on land, their mutual aid is inferior to the forgetfulness of rivers and lakes—a metaphor for the inferiority of worldly action compared to embodying the Way through non-action. The line \"praising Yao and condemning Jie\" may seem unconventional, yet its insight lies in self-attainment: without Jie, there is no Yao; without decline, no rise; without evil, no good; without slander, no praise. Praise and slander, rise and decline, good and evil—all arise in mutual dependence. Rather than distinguishing between them, it is better to forget both and entrust them to spontaneity. Entrusting to spontaneity is to be transformed by the Way. The Buddhists say, \"All dharmas are equal, without high or low,\" and \"Abandon both existence and nonexistence,\" and \"The great Way is not difficult; only avoid picking and choosing\"—all expressing this idea.\n\nThe phrase \"Two mud oxen fight, entering the sea—no news to this day\" is most excellent. The great clod is heaven and earth. Form gives rise to life, and life cannot be without labor. In old age, when sinews and strength wane, one naturally finds ease. *Xī* means rest. To \"perfect my life\" is to preserve my body—this is the meaning of \"Hearing the Way in the morning, one may die in the evening without regret.\"\n\nHiding a boat in a ravine or a mountain in a marsh seems secure, yet in the dead of night, a strong man may carry them away, and the unaware will not perceive it. Even hiding the small within the large has its vulnerabilities, but if one hides the world within the world, there is no escape—this is the great truth of all things. Even those who assume human form delight in it, yet the myriad transformations have no end. How immeasurable is their joy! Thus, the sage wanders where things cannot escape and abides in their enduring presence. Excelling in premature death, excelling in old age, excelling in beginnings, excelling in endings—people emulate this, let alone the myriad things bound to it and the single transformation they await.\n\nOne who unifies their likes and dislikes aligns with heaven; one who distinguishes them aligns with humanity. Neither overcoming heaven with humanity nor overcoming humanity with heaven is possible. The true person has no likes or dislikes, no distinctions between heaven and humanity, but simply follows the natural course. This is what the Buddhists call \"abandoning both existence and nonexistence,\" and what Laozi refers to as \"both returning to the mystery.\" Thus, it is said that heaven and humanity do not overcome one another—this is the unity of both one and not-one. \"One\" is the great master.",

      "translated_text": "The boat hidden in the ravine, the mountain concealed in the marsh—one might call this secure concealment, yet there are times when they are lost. At midnight, a powerful force carries them away, and the deluded do not know. This speaks of the workings of creation. To carry them off and lose them is to speak of human schemes, however deep and secret, yet at times they cannot be freely controlled. This is like forging iron to make a door sill, only to see someone clap their hands and laugh—such is the ignorance of the deluded.\n\nSmall and large refer to the boat and ravine, the mountain and marsh. The vastness of the ravine can conceal a boat; the vastness of the marsh can conceal a mountain. To conceal the small within the large is fitting. Yet there is still escape and loss. To conceal the world within the world is to entrust it to nature. All beneath heaven entrusted to heaven leaves no room for escape. This is the great truth of all things.\n\nPeople delight in having form, yet do not know that the human body undergoes a thousand transformations—how can one know where it will end? If one could truly know this, then the myriad things would be complete within me, heaven and earth would be one with me—how boundless would such joy be!\n\nThe sage roams the mind in accordance with nature, thus neither gaining nor losing. This is what is meant by \"roaming where things cannot escape, yet all are preserved\"—excelling in premature death, excelling in old age, excelling in beginnings, excelling in endings. This is the work of creation. \"Excelling\" means \"to be capable.\" Even ordinary people emulate this—how much more so the Dao, to which the myriad things are bound, and upon which the single transformation depends? This is what is called the Great Master.\n\nEach passage rises higher than the last—this is the style of Zhuangzi. The words of sages and worthies would be plain and simple by comparison.\n\nThe Dao has essence and trustworthiness, is without action and without form. It can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen. It is self-originating, self-rooted. Before there was heaven and earth, it existed from ancient times. It is spirit-like, divine, giving birth to heaven and earth. It is prior to the Supreme Ultimate yet not exalted; beneath the six directions yet not lowly. Before heaven and earth were born, it was not long in duration; older than antiquity, it is not aged.\n\nEarlier, I did not speak of the word \"Dao,\" but now I raise it to discuss the Great Master. Essence is reality; trustworthiness is also reality. Without action, there is no place to begin; without form, there is no tangible substance. It can be transmitted but not received, attained but not seen—these two phrases are incomprehensible to those who do not know the Dao. Guan Yinzi has a chapter that elucidates the meaning of \"transmission\" well. \"Self-originating, self-rooted\" traces back to its beginning. Tracing the origin of this Dao, it already existed before heaven and earth—this is called the Supreme Ultimate without polarity. The traces of creation, the divine and the imperial—what enables them to be spirit-like is this Dao. Heaven and earth also come into being through the Dao. As the *Book of Changes* says, \"The Supreme Ultimate gives rise to the Two Modes\"—this is it. It is neither exalted nor lowly, neither long in duration nor aged.\n\nFu Xi obtained it and thereby harnessed heaven and earth; Fuxi obtained it and thereby embraced the mother of qi. The Northern Dipper obtained it and thus remains unerring through the ages; the sun and moon obtained it and thus remain unceasing through the ages. Kanpi obtained it and thereby embraced Kunlun; Feng Yi obtained it and thereby roamed the great rivers. Jianwu obtained it and thereby dwelled on the great mountain; the Yellow Emperor obtained it and thereby ascended to the cloudy heavens. Zhuanxu obtained it and thereby dwelled in the dark palace; Yuqiang obtained it and thereby stood at the North Pole. The Queen Mother of the West obtained it and thereby sat in Shaoguang. None knew its beginning, none knew its end. Pengzu obtained it and thereby lived from the time of Youyu to the Five Hegemons; Fu Yue obtained it and thereby assisted Wu Ding, ruling the world, riding the eastern tail of the Azure Dragon and aligning with the ranks of stars.\n\nFrom Fu Xi onward, there are thirteen instances of \"obtained\"—all speak of obtaining this Dao and then being able to do such things. Fu Xi was an ancient emperor-king; \"harnessing heaven and earth\" means ordering the cosmos. The mother of qi is primordial qi; \"embracing\" means uniting yin and yang within oneself—this is the origin of the practices of those who cultivate refinement. Kanpi is the mountain spirit who embraced Kunlun; Feng Yi is the water spirit. Jianwu is the spirit of Mount Tai; the Yellow Emperor’s ascent to the cloudy heavens refers to the affair at Mount Dinghu. The dark palace is like the present-day realm of the Great Clarity. Yuqiang is the northern deity; Shaoguang is the dwelling of immortals. The phrase \"none knew its beginning, none knew its end\" conveys the same meaning, though the sentences vary in length—this is a matter of literary technique. Among these thirteen phrases, the sun, moon, and Dipper are interspersed, and Pengzu and Fu Yue are cited as evidence afterward—this is where Zhuangzi’s brush surpasses conventional rules and cannot be measured by the standards of the sages’ writings. One must regard it with a different perspective.\n\nNanbo Zikui asked Woman Crookback, “You are advanced in years…”",

      "translated_text": "\"Why then does your complexion resemble that of a child?\"\n\n\"I have heard the Dao,\" she replied.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, \"May I learn it?\"\n\n\"Alas, how could you? You are not the right person. Now, Pulian Yi possesses the talent of a sage but not the Dao of a sage; I possess the Dao of a sage but not the talent of a sage. I wished to teach him, hoping he might truly become a sage. If not, even imparting the Dao of a sage to one with the talent of a sage would be easy. Yet I still guarded and instructed him. After three days, he was able to put the world outside himself. Once the world was outside himself, I guarded him again for seven days, and then he was able to put things outside himself. Once things were outside himself, I guarded him again for nine days, and then he was able to put life outside himself. Once life was outside himself, he could attain morning clarity. With morning clarity, he could perceive the solitary. Perceiving the solitary, he could transcend past and present. Transcending past and present, he could enter the realm beyond death and life. That which kills life does not die; that which gives life does not live. As a thing, it sends nothing away, welcomes nothing, destroys nothing, and completes nothing. Its name is *Yingning*—*Yingning* is that which attains completion through disturbance.\n\nNanbo Zikui said, \"From whom did you alone hear this?\"\n\nShe replied, \"I heard it from the son of *Fumo*; the son of *Fumo* heard it from the grandson of *Luosong*; the grandson of *Luosong* heard it from *Zhanming*; *Zhanming* heard it from *Niexu*; *Niexu* heard it from *Xuyi*; *Xuyi* heard it from *Yu’ou*; *Yu’ou* heard it from *Xuanfang*; *Xuanfang* heard it from *Canliao*; *Canliao* heard it from *Yishi*.\"\n\nZikui and Woman Crookback are both allegorical figures. To be advanced in years yet possess the complexion of a child—this is the teaching of present-day cultivators. The distinction between the talent of a sage and the Dao of a sage is finely drawn in these two phrases; none but Zhuangzi could have expressed it. Before him, no one had done so. Only the Five Emperors, the Three Kings, Yi Yin, the Duke of Zhou, and Confucius possessed both Dao and talent. The three, seven, and nine days need not be rigidly parsed; they merely signify one stage surpassing the next. To \"put life outside oneself\" is to forget one’s body. \"Morning clarity\" is the luminous qi of dawn, as clear as the open sky in one’s breast. \"Perceiving the solitary\" is to see for oneself what others cannot. \"Transcending past and present\" is to be beyond life and death. Here, he inverts the terms: that which \"kills life\" does not die, and that which \"gives life\" does not live—this is his customary method of stirring the brush. Though it may kill, it is not death; though it may give life, it is not life. *Jiang* means \"to send off.\" To send nothing away, welcome nothing, destroy nothing, and complete nothing is simply to follow nature. *Ying* means \"to disturb\"; though buffeted by disturbance and chaos, that which is constant remains undisturbed.

      "translated_text": "These several phrases suggest that the Dao is attained through reading and reflection, giving rise to many names. Though wondrous and extraordinary, it ultimately returns to the workings of creation—guarding the primal beginning of qi, the nameless origin. This \"beginning\" is itself the beginning of no-beginning, what is called \"having a beginning.\" There is that which has not yet begun to have a beginning, and that which has not yet begun to have what has not yet begun to have a beginning. This meaning implies that though the Dao may be grasped through texts, it is in truth what our nature and heaven inherently possess.\n\nZisi, Ziyu, Zili, and Zilai spoke among themselves, saying: \"Who can take non-being as the head, life as the spine, and death as the tailbone? Who knows that death and life, existence and cessation, are one body? We would befriend such a one.\" The four looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord; thus they became friends.\n\nSoon after, Ziyu fell ill. Zisi went to inquire of him, saying: \"How great! That which fashions all things would make me like this—hunched and crooked, my back humped, my five organs protruding upward, my chin buried in my navel, my shoulders towering above my crown, my nape pointing to the sky. The qi of yin and yang is in disarray, yet my heart remains untroubled.\" He paced back and forth before a well and said: \"Alas!

If, little by little, it were to transform my right arm into a crossbow, I would use it to hunt owls for roasting. If, little by little, it were to transform my tailbone into a wheel and my spirit into a horse, I would mount it and ride—why ever change steeds?\n\nMoreover, to gain is to meet the moment; to lose is to follow the flow. At peace with the moment and dwelling in accord, sorrow and joy cannot enter. This is what the ancients called 'suspended release.' Yet if one cannot release oneself, things will bind one fast. Furthermore, things have never triumphed over Heaven for long—why should I resent it?\"\n\nHead, spine, and tailbone are but the beginning, middle, and end of the same.

      "translated_text": "Should it be so—this gradual transformation—then this single \"should\" is most extraordinary. The very words \"should it be\" and \"gradually\" are themselves wondrous. Should the Creator, little by little, transform my body into some other thing, I would still make use of it as it is. This is the meaning of following the Dao of creation without preference or aversion. Though spoken in parable, it holds its own truth. To gain in time is to follow the Master’s advent; to lose in time is to follow the Master’s departure. This, too, speaks to the principle of life and death. \"Countenance unbound\" describes a heart without attachment. If one clings to things, one cannot free oneself—hence \"cannot untie the knot.\" How could the myriad things overcome Heaven? All this is the meaning of resting in spontaneity. The spontaneous Heaven is the Great Master.\n\nLe Xuan once said: \"The thirty-two chapters of *Zhuangzi* are but the two words *ziran* (spontaneity).\"\n\nPresently, Zilai fell ill, gasping for breath as death approached. His wife and children gathered around, weeping. Zili went to inquire and shouted: \"Begone! Do not disturb the transformation!\" Leaning against the doorframe, he spoke to Zilai: \"How wondrous! The Creator—what will it make of you next? Where will it send you? Will it make you the liver of a rat? The arm of an insect?\"\n\nZilai replied: \"A child follows the commands of father and mother, whether east or west, south or north. Yet the commands of yin and yang are even more binding than those of parents. Now, as death draws near and I refuse to heed it, I would be resisting. What fault is theirs? The Great Clod burdens me with form, labors me with life, eases me with old age, and rests me with death. Thus, to treat my life well is to treat my death well.\n\nNow, a great smith smelts metal, and the metal leaps forth, saying, 'I must become a *Moye* sword!' The smith would surely deem it an inauspicious metal. Yet once it takes human form and declares, 'I am a man! I am a man!'—the Creator would surely deem it an inauspicious being.

      "translated_text": "When Master Zeng changed his mat, his words were as such—those of a sage or worthy. Yet when Zhuangzi expounded this discourse, it was with the voice of a hero, one who scolds and silences, one whose very presence makes wives and children flee in haste. The startling shock! To speak of one about to transform into a rat’s liver or an insect’s limb—things of the smallest measure—is like the saying of Zhaozhou after the fire: reduced to a single stalk of reeds. Yet the prose is marvelous: \"Only follow the command\"—if I refuse to heed, I resist and rebel, an earlier metaphor showing that no created thing can overcome Heaven. The analogy of smelted metal is likewise extraordinary. Jia Yi said, \"Yin and yang are the coals, the myriad things the copper,\" all drawn from this very idea. If metal could speak, if man could claim, \"I am a man!\"—the Creator would surely deem it monstrous. The Creator’s view of man is no different from the great smith’s view of metal. Who but Zhuangzi could craft such parables? *Chengran* describes the state of deep slumber; *quran* the state of sudden awakening. To take life as slumber and death as awakening—these six words thus conclude the preceding passage, where the false and the real intertwine in wondrous fashion.\n\nZi Sanghu, Mengzi Fan, and Zi Qin Zhang were three friends who said to one another: \"Who can join together in non-joining, act together in non-acting? Who can ascend the heavens, roam the mists, twist and turn through the boundless, forgetting one another in life, without end or limit?\" The three looked at one another and smiled, their hearts in perfect accord. Thus they became friends.\n\nAfter some time, Zi Sanghu died. Before he was encoffined, Confucius, hearing of it, sent Zigong to assist with the rites. One of the two friends wove a funeral garland while the other played the zither, and together they sang in harmony: \"Alas, Sanghu! Alas, Sanghu! You have returned to your true nature, while we remain as men—oh!\" Zigong hurried forward and said, \"May I ask whether it is proper to sing before the corpse?\" The two looked at each other and smiled, saying, \"What does he know of the meaning of ritual?\"\n\nTo join together in non-joining is to join without attachment of the heart. To act together in non-acting is to act without deliberate action.",

      "translated_text": "The spirit of leaping and bounding knows no limit or end. To ascend the heavens and wander in the mists is to roam beyond the realm of things. \"To join in forgetting life without end or limit\" means precisely what is said elsewhere: \"not forgetting one’s beginning, not seeking one’s end.\" Their phrase \"not forgetting\" and this phrase \"forgetting\" both reduce to the five words \"not seeking one’s end.\" *Moran* describes the appearance of emptiness and stillness; *youjian* means \"after some time.\"\n\n\"To go and assist with the rites\" is like helping Yuan Rang wash the inner coffin. *Bianqu* means weaving a funeral mat. \"One wove a mat, one played the zither\" refers to Mencius Fan and Ziqin Zhang. *Yi* is an exclamatory particle. *Jielai* is the opening phrase of the singers’ song. \"Returned to his true nature\" means \"returned to his original state.\" \"While we remain as men—oh!\" is as if, upon suddenly hearing the bells and drums from above, one realizes another day has passed in this floating life—such are the marvels of this text’s style.\n\n\"Meaning of ritual\" refers to the essence of ritual propriety. Though Zhuangzi speaks in parables, the *Book of Rites* records Yuan Rang’s \"badger-head\" song, showing that between heaven and earth, from ancient times, there have always been those who practiced a learning of detachment from the world. People today say Buddhism first entered China during Emperor Ming’s reign, unaware that such people existed long before Buddhism.\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius: \"What manner of men were they? They cultivated nothingness, disregarded their physical forms, sang before the corpse without changing countenance—what should we call them?\" Confucius said: \"They wander beyond the bounds of the world, while I wander within. Outer and inner do not meet, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how narrow I was! They roam as companions of the Creator, moving within the single qi of heaven and earth. To them, life is an excrescent growth, a hanging tumor; death is the bursting of an abscess. If this is so, how could they know where life and death, before and after, reside? Borrowing from other things, entrusting themselves to shared forms, they forget their livers and gallbladders, neglect their ears and eyes, reversing and repeating beginnings and ends without discerning their origins. Vaguely they wander beyond the dust and grime, carefree in the work of non-action—how could they be muddled by worldly rituals to please the eyes and ears of the crowd?\"\n\n\"Cultivated nothingness\" means having no virtuous conduct. \"What should we call them?\" is like asking, \"What name fits them?\" \"Beyond the bounds\" and \"within the bounds\" correspond to what Buddhists call \"worldly dharma\" and \"supra-worldly dharma.\" Since their aims differ, sending you to offer condolences was my mistake. Hence: \"Outer and inner do not meet, yet I sent you to offer condolences—how narrow I was!\"\n\n\"Companions of the Creator\" means befriending the Creator. \"Moving within the single qi of heaven and earth\" means roaming in the Creator’s beginning. \"Excrescent growth, hanging tumor\" compares the body to a superfluous thing in heaven and earth; one must burst and drain it to be satisfied—this is the idea of \"life wearies me, death gives me rest.\" \"Borrowing from other things\" refers to the *Round Awakening*’s discourse on earth, water, fire, and wind; the four great elements combine to form the body, hence \"entrusting themselves to shared forms.\" Even the liver, gallbladder, ears, and eyes are not self-aware—this is the meaning of forgetting the body. \"Reversing and repeating beginnings and ends without discerning their origins\" means tracing beginnings and endings without seeing their source. *Mangran* describes the appearance of being lost and without knowledge. \"Beyond the dust and grime\" means beyond the bounds. \"Work of non-action\" means naturalness. *Kuikuiran* describes the muddled state of acting for worldly eyes and ears—this is Laozi’s idea of \"ritual as a forced display for the world.\" \"Observing\" means demonstrating.\n\nZigong said: \"Then what path does the Master follow?\" Confucius said: \"I am one of Heaven’s punished people. Nevertheless, I share this with you.\" Zigong said: \"May I ask about this path?\" Confucius said: \"Fish come together in water; men come together in the Dao. Those who come together in water dig ponds to provide for themselves; those who come together in the Dao live settled lives without effort. Hence it is said: 'Fish forget one another in rivers and lakes; men forget one another in the arts of the Dao.'\"\n\nZigong said: \"May I ask about the *jiren*?\" Confucius said: \"The *jiren* is one who is *ji* among men but equal to Heaven. Hence it is said: 'Heaven’s petty man is man’s gentleman; man’s gentleman is Heaven’s petty man.'\"\n\n\"What path does the Master follow?\" means: Does the Master follow the path beyond or within the bounds? \"Heaven’s punished people\" refers to the earlier \"Heaven punishes, yet how can it be undone?\"—meaning I cannot be a man of the outer path. \"I share this with you\" means I wish to speak with you of the joys of the outer path. \"May I ask about this path?\" means \"May I ask its reason?\" \"Fish come together in water\" is like \"moistening one another with foam\"—better to forget one another in rivers and lakes. \"Dig ponds to provide\" means being content with whatever water one has. Those who attain the Dao live according to their allotment, settled without effort—without effort, without action. The *jiren* is *ji*, meaning unique. *Ji* means a solitary person. *Mou* means \"to match.\" *Ji* means not pairing with men but matching Heaven. If Heaven considers one a gentleman, men consider him a petty man; if men consider one a gentleman, Heaven considers him a petty man. Zhuangzi’s \"gentleman\" contains a tone of mockery toward the sages, for rites, music, laws, and measures do not arise naturally—only by breaking measuring cups and scales to stop men’s striving can one be Heaven’s gentleman. This is also an overly lofty argument born of indignation at the world’s corruption.\n\nYan Yuan asked Confucius: \"When Mengsun Cai’s mother died, he wept without tears, his heart was not grieved, and he did not mourn during the funeral rites. Though lacking these three, he was considered skilled in mourning—was there truly in Lu someone who gained fame without substance?\" Yan Hui found this strange. Confucius said: \"Mengsun’s family has fully realized it, advanced in understanding. They wished to simplify but could not—yet they have already simplified. Mengsun does not know why he lives, does not know why he dies, does not know why to go before, does not know why to go after. If he transforms into things and awaits the transformations he does not know, is it not so? And if he is about to transform, how could he know it is not yet transformed? If he is about to not transform, how could he know it is already transformed? I and you are still dreaming, not yet awakened!\"\n\n\"In Lu\" means one who was renowned in the state for skill in mourning. *Yi* means \"always\"—as in \"I have always found this strange.\" \"Advanced in understanding\" means advancing in understanding the Dao. \"Wished to simplify but could not\" means that in funeral rites, even matters like weeping, they wished to simplify but could not. Though they wished to simplify, what they did was already very simple, hence \"they have already simplified.\" \"Does not know why he lives, does not know why he dies\" is the same as \"reversing and repeating beginnings and ends without discerning their origins.\" \"Go before\" means beginning; \"go after\" means end. Following the transformations of creation to become things, hence \"if he transforms into things and awaits the transformations he does not know.\" This means letting things take their natural course. *Yihu* is an exclamatory particle. If one lets things take their natural course, how can one know whether they are about to transform, already transformed, or not transformed? These are all stirring, uplifting words. Since he understood the Dao and could let things take their natural course, why should I find it strange? This means I am still dreaming, not yet awakened.",

      "translated_text": "Moreover, he possessed a startling form yet suffered no harm to his heart; he had a morning dwelling yet no emotional death. The Mengsun family simply awoke—when others wept, he wept too—this was his *so-it-is*.\n\nThat which startles the form refers to the changes of age from youth to old age. Though these changes may be startling, his heart remained at ease and untroubled, hence \"no harm to the heart.\" *Dwelling* means abode; *morning* means life. Life and death are like morning and night. Knowing that the dwelling of life is transient, even death is not truly death, hence \"no emotional death.\" *Emotion* here means reality. \"Simply awoke—when others wept, he wept too\" means he followed the crowd. This was where he wished to simplify yet could not. \"This was his *so-it-is*\"—these six characters are most extraordinary, speaking of the wonder of his self-attainment. Thus, though he wished to simplify, he could not, and so followed the crowd in weeping. This passage is most difficult to interpret, and in many versions, the character *nai* (乃) from the previous sentence and *qie* (且) from the following sentence should properly be combined. The two characters together are quite amusing.\n\n\"Moreover, you and I are merely ears to one another. How could you know what I mean by 'my self'?\" Here, *qie* (且) is simply the character *qie* with an added *ye* (也), as seen repeatedly in earlier passages. *Wu* (吾) means \"I.\" Now, since you and I together find it strange, how can you know what I truly mean by \"my self\"? Thus, \"Moreover, you and I are merely ears to one another. How could you know what I mean by 'my self'?\" Zhuangzi’s writing is largely like this—stirring and uplifting. Without a unique perspective, it is difficult to read.\n\n\"Moreover, were you dreaming of being a bird soaring through the heavens or a fish diving into the depths? Do you not recognize that the speaker now is awake or still dreaming? Joy comes before laughter, and laughter cannot keep pace with it. When all is arranged and one departs, transformation enters the vastness of the singular sky.\"\n\nDreaming of birds or fish merely echoes the earlier passage about the butterfly. Is the speaker now awake or still dreaming? Is this not the same as \"Was it the butterfly dreaming of Zhuang Zhou, or Zhuang Zhou dreaming of the butterfly?\" When one’s intent is set upon something, there are times when laughter cannot keep pace—this speaks of the intensity of joy. It is like Du Fu’s line: \"Only when the shock subsided did I wipe away my tears.\" Mr. Lexuan also said: \"By the time I could weep, the shock had already passed.\" This speaks of shock. *Zaoshi* (造适) means joy.",

      "translated_text": "Though shock and joy differ, their meaning of \"not keeping pace\" is the same. \"Arranging\" refers to preparation. Laughter arises from things, as if things offer laughter to me—this laughter emerges naturally, requiring no arrangement. Thus, it is said: \"laughter cannot keep pace with the offering,\" and \"arrangement cannot keep pace.\" Though the character *pai* (排) appears in both lines, its rhetorical force differs; one cannot link them to the preceding word. Between the workings of creation, all matters are preordained—life and death, poverty and prosperity, gain and loss, fortune and misfortune—all are already fixed. I need only accept what is arranged, follow the transformations of creation, and thus enter into the subtlety of creation itself.\n\n*Liaotian yi* (\"the vastness of the singular sky\") is but another name for creation—*liao* means \"boundless.\" The \"one\" in *liaotian yi* echoes the earlier \"what it favors\" and \"what it does not favor,\" for the One is unity.

      "translated_text": "O my Master!\n\nThe following lines now reveal the title of this chapter: *The Great and Venerable Teacher*. It speaks of \"powdering the ten thousand things yet remaining unnameable by craft,\" and \"bestowing grace upon the ages yet remaining unnameable by benevolence\"—for it describes acting without action, spontaneity unfolding of itself, where I harbor no deliberate intent and thus cannot be named by such terms. The *Book of Changes* says: \"It drums the ten thousand things yet shares no sage’s cares\"—this is the same meaning. It has endured since high antiquity, existing before heaven and earth. Through a thousand ages, ten thousand ages, it remains thus—how could it be named by youth or age? Above, it is what heaven covers: sun, moon, and stars. Below, it is what earth bears: mountains, rivers, hills, and mounds. How much artistry is here! Consider how heaven revolves to the left, the fixed stars clinging to it unmoving, while the sun, moon, and five planets turn to the right, some swift, some slow, some flowing, some hidden. Rivers, cliffs, waters, stones—how many wonders! All are wrought by the Creator. Amid the manifold forms, like the hundred grasses and myriad trees, how many marvels—what else but artistry? Yet we cannot simply call it \"artistry.\"\n\nAll these lines depict the Dao of spontaneity. Roaming the heart in spontaneity, one sees heaven and earth born together with me, the ten thousand things as one with me. Hence it says: \"This is the roaming I speak of.\"\n\nYan Hui said, \"I have advanced.\"\nZhongni asked, \"What do you mean?\"\n\"I have forgotten benevolence and righteousness.\"\n\"That is good, but not yet sufficient.\"\n\nAnother day, they met again.\nYan Hui said, \"I have advanced.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I have forgotten ritual and music.\"\n\"That is good, but not yet sufficient.\"\n\nAnother day, they met again.\nYan Hui said, \"I have advanced.\"\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\"I sit in forgetfulness.\"\nZhongni started and asked, \"What do you mean by sitting in forgetfulness?\"\nYan Hui replied, \"I cast off my limbs, dismiss my hearing and sight, leave my form, abandon my knowledge, and merge with the Great Thoroughfare—this is what I call sitting in forgetfulness.\"\nZhongni said, \"To merge is to have no preferences; to transform is to have no constancy. And you are truly worthy! I would follow after you.\"\n\nThis passage borrows the name of Yanzi to depict the marvel of attaining the Dao—though even Zhuangzi in his time knew Yanzi as the second sage. The doctrine of \"sitting in forgetfulness\" is Zhuangzi’s teaching; to seek Yanzi through it is mistaken.\n\n\"Advanced\" means to have gained something. First benevolence and righteousness, then ritual and music—this implies ritual and music are higher than benevolence and righteousness. Here, Zhuangzi’s use of \"benevolence and righteousness\" refers only to love and aversion; all such terms differ from the sages’ meanings. First forgetting benevolence and righteousness, then forgetting ritual and music, is like \"setting aside the world, then the ten thousand things.\" As for sitting in forgetfulness, one forgets everything entirely—this is the moment when being and non-being are both transcended.

      "translated_text": "The eyes and limbs all become unaware of themselves—hence the saying, \"limbs discarded, senses abandoned.\" To \"discard the body and abandon the limbs\" is to \"separate from form\"; to \"dismiss wisdom and abandon the senses\" is to \"go beyond knowledge.\" \"Great penetration\" is the Great Dao. The so-called sage is one who penetrates all things; *rui* (睿) means \"penetration,\" and *rui* makes one a sage. Observing these two characters, \"sitting in forgetfulness,\" one sees it is akin to the Chan school’s \"wall-gazing\"—a borrowed device. To be one with the Dao is to be without likes or dislikes; without likes or dislikes, one is transformed. Transformed, there is nothing to abide by, and the mind is born. Thus it is said: \"In oneness, there are no preferences; in transformation, there is no constancy.\" \"I follow after you\" means you surpass me, and I am left behind. \"Virtue\" here means superiority—superiority over others.\n\nWhen Ziyu and Zisang were friends, they were caught in the rain for ten days. Ziyu said, \"Zisang must be ill,\" and wrapped some rice to take to him. Arriving at Zisang’s door, he heard sounds like singing, like weeping, as Zisang plucked his zither. He cried, \"Father! Mother! Heaven! Man! Why can I not bear this voice?\" Then he hurriedly recited a poem. Ziyu entered and asked, \"Why do you sing this poem in such a manner?\" Zisang replied, \"I pondered who brought me to this extremity, but I could not find the answer. How could my parents wish me poverty? Heaven covers all without partiality; Earth bears all without partiality. How could Heaven and Earth wish me poverty? I sought the one who caused this, but I could not find them. Yet here I am at this extremity—it is fate!\"\n\nThis passage speaks only of poverty and success as matters of fate, crafting such words in a most extraordinary way. Fearing Zisang might fall ill from hunger, Ziyu said, \"You must be ill.\" In ancient times, when playing the zither, one always sang, as when Shun played the zither and sang *Nanfeng*. \"Like singing, like weeping\" describes the weakness of his strength, making his voice faint. \"Unable to bear the voice\" means he lacked the strength to produce sound. \"Hastily reciting the poem\" refers to the constrained emotion and cramped words—his singing was so disordered that he could only recite in fragments. \"How could my parents wish me poverty? How could Heaven and Earth wish me poverty?\" These lines are most exquisite. \"I sought the one who caused this but could not find them\"—if it is neither Heaven nor Earth, neither father nor mother, then who is responsible? Yet here I am at this extremity—it is fate! This meaning refers to the principle of spontaneity, which requires no effort, no deliberation, and stands above Heaven and Earth. Fate is the principle of spontaneity—it is *ming* (命), which is also *li* (理), the so-called \"Great Master.\" For scholars, having a teacher is a matter of service and obedience; when there is a Great Master, how can one not follow fate alone?\n\nReading this chapter of Zhuangzi, one sees that the *Li Ming* chapter of the *Liezi* does not compare. This is the seventh inner chapter, \"Fit for Emperors and Kings.\"",

'To measure others' means to transform them. Using one’s own person as the model to transform the world—hence the saying, 'standards, models, principles, and measures all proceed from oneself.' *Jing*, *shi*, and *yi* in this context align with harmony and ease, while *du* is pronounced as 'crossing.' 'Who would dare not obey and be transformed?' means that the people all listen and submit to such transformation.\n\n'Deceptive virtue' refers to self-deception, not true virtue. To govern the world in this manner is as difficult as crossing the sea to dig a river or making a mosquito carry a mountain. 'Digging a river' here means dredging the Nine Rivers. 'Governing externally' means transforming through the mind, which leaves no trace, while transforming through the person leaves traces. 'Proceeding only after rectification' means acting in accordance with the principles of nature and destiny. 'Those capable of their tasks' means fully realizing these natural affairs. *Du hu* means 'decisively.' This is how governance is decisively carried out. Zhuangzi’s intent lies in non-action, hence his argument differs from that of our Confucians.\n\nBirds fly high to avoid the harm of arrows and nets, while mice burrow deep beneath sacred mounds to escape fumigation and digging. This illustrates that those who leave traces inevitably bring trouble upon themselves. If one cannot practice the transformation of non-action and instead leaves traces, their ignorance is even greater than that of these two creatures. These two creatures are the bird and the mouse.\n\nTian Gen wandered to Yin Yang and arrived at the banks of the Liao River, where he encountered an unnamed man and questioned him, saying, 'May I ask how to govern the world?' The unnamed man replied, 'Begone, you rustic! Why do you ask such an inopportune question? I am about to become a companion to the Creator. If I grow weary of this, I shall ride the nebulous bird to soar beyond the Six Directions and wander in the land of Nothingness, dwelling in the boundless wilds. Why do you trouble my mind with questions about governing the world?'\n\nThe unnamed man continued, 'If you would still inquire about governing the world, direct your mind toward tranquility, harmonize your *qi* with the formless, follow the spontaneity of things, and refrain from imposing private interests—then the world will be governed. To ask about governing the world is already contrary to the Dao of non-action, hence I deem your question rustic and it has made me displeased.' *Bu yu* means displeased.\n\n'To become a companion to the Creator' means to dwell in the human world while following the spontaneity of the Creator. *Yan* means satiation. Having already grown satiated with wandering in the human world, one then wanders beyond the Creator. The 'nebulous bird' refers to the *qi* of emptiness and nothingness. The 'land of Nothingness' and the 'boundless wilds' both describe the realm of supreme emptiness.\n\n*He yi* means 'why.' The question about governing the world disturbed my mind, hence my displeasure. This *gan* character means to stir or provoke me. The *yi* character, according to Master Cui, also conveys the sense of 'why.' *Dan* means tranquility, and *mo* refers to the formless void. *Qi* here is akin to *xing* (nature). When the mind and nature both align with spontaneity, it is said that one 'directs the mind toward tranquility and harmonizes *qi* with the formless.' Earlier, it was said, 'Do not listen with the mind but listen with *qi*.' Here, *qi* should be understood as *xing* (nature).

This figure called the \"Nameless One\" is but an empty fiction, a mere phantom—hence the later chapter speaks of \"parable, repetition, and borrowed words.\" When names like the Yellow Emperor, Confucius, Yanzi, or Jieyu the Madman are invoked, it is only to lend weight to the speaker’s own discourse. Thus, the \"Nameless One,\" \"Celestial Root,\" and \"Master Reed Garment\" are all such fictions.\n\nYangzi Ju visited Lao Dan and said, \"Suppose there were a man swift in movement, strong and resolute, penetrating in understanding, clear in perception, diligent in studying the Dao without weariness—could such a one be compared to an enlightened king?\"\n\nLao Dan replied, \"Such a one, in the eyes of the sage, is but a convict laborer, a craftsman bound by skill, one who wearies the body and startles the mind. Moreover, the patterned hides of tigers and leopards draw hunters; the agility of gibbons and the cunning of macaques bring those who would bind them; the terrier’s skill in seizing raccoons and monkeys invites the leash. Could such as these be compared to an enlightened king?\"\n\nYangzi Ju, dismayed, asked, \"Then may I inquire about the governance of an enlightened king?\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"The governance of an enlightened king: his achievements cover the world yet seem not his own; he transforms and bestows upon the ten thousand things, yet the people do not rely on him. No name is raised, yet things delight in themselves. He stands in the unfathomable and wanders in the realm of nothingness.\"\n\n*\"Suppose there were a man\"*—these words describe someone without naming him, a veiled mockery of Confucius.\n*\"Swift in movement\"*—quick and agile.\n*\"Strong and resolute\"*—firm and unyielding.\n*\"Penetrating in understanding\"*—keen in learning and vigorous in practice.\n*\"Things\"*—affairs.\n*\"Penetrating\"*—thorough.\n*\"Clear in perception\"*—seeing all things with emptiness and clarity.\n*\"Diligent in studying the Dao without weariness\"*—could such a one be compared to an enlightened king? That is, if one were to govern as a king, would such qualities suffice?\n*\"Convict laborer\"*—a prisoner subjected to penal servitude.\n*\"Changed\"*—altered, as in the term *\"successive changes\"* (referring to corvée labor).\n*\"Convict laborer\"*—an ancient term, akin to the Han dynasty’s *\"gathering firewood\"* (a euphemism for forced labor).\n*\"Bound by skill\"*—one whose craft ensnares them.\nThese two types—convict laborers exhaust their bodies, while those bound by skill alarm their minds. To study in such a way that both body and mind are wearied is no different from being a convict laborer or a craftsman ensnared by skill.\n*\"Startles the mind\"*—fills it with dread.\nTigers and leopards, with their patterned hides, attract hunters; the term *\"leash\"* refers to the means of restraint.\nThe agility of gibbons and the cunning of macaques, the terrier’s skill in seizing raccoons—all these invite the disaster of being bound.

      "translated_text": "The unfathomable is but roaming in nothingness—where the brush dances and the drum beats. By and large, the preceding passages all expound the meaning of the chapter \"Responding to Emperors and Kings.\"\n\nIn Zheng there was a divine diviner named Ji Xian, who knew the life and death, survival and demise, fortune and misfortune, longevity and early death of men, predicting them by year, month, or day with godlike precision. When the people of Zheng saw him, they all fled in haste. When Liezi saw him, he was enchanted in heart. Returning home, he told Master Huchi: \"At first I thought your Dao was supreme, but now I see there is something even more supreme.\"\n\nHuchi said: \"I have shown you only its form, not yet its reality—how could you have truly attained the Dao? With a flock of hens and no rooster, how could there be eggs? To present the Dao to the world with insistence is to invite trust. Thus, others can divine your fate. Whether by year, month, or day, near or far, the diviner’s words are all verified like a god’s. Those who flee do so in fear of his accuracy. To be enchanted in heart is to be inwardly convinced. 'Its form' refers to what is external, fully displayed; 'its reality' is what is internal, not yet exhausted. You have never fully witnessed its reality—how could you assume you have attained the Dao?\n\nThe word 'assume' implies mistaking what is not yet attained for attainment. Consider the tone of the phrase: only with both male and female can there be generation. Without a male, how could there be eggs? This line illustrates that without a heart, there are no traces. It is a metaphor for the heart not yet transformed, thus still perceptible in form. 'Insistence' means holding oneself high, believing one’s Dao to be above the world and demanding others’ trust. This is where traces remain—where transformation is incomplete—so the diviner can read you.\"\n\nHuchi then said: \"Bring him to me and let him observe me.\" The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huchi. Afterward, Ji Xian emerged and told Liezi: \"Alas! Your master is dead—he will not live. It will not be ten days. I saw something strange: he was like damp ashes.\"\n\nLiezi entered, weeping until his tears soaked his lapels, and reported this to Huchi. Huchi said: \"Just now I showed him the 'Earthly Pattern'—sprouting yet not stirring, not upright. He likely saw my 'Closed Virtue Mechanism.' 'Damp ashes' means his vital qi was nearly spent, like embers about to be extinguished. 'Earthly Pattern' is akin to the meditative observations of Chan practitioners—sprouting yet not truly sprouting. 'Not stirring' means unmoving; 'not upright' means indefinable. This 'not upright' echoes Mencius’ 'there must be action, yet do not fixate on it.' Only when there is movement yet no movement did the diviner mistake it for damp ashes. Ashes are living fire; damp ashes are fire about to die. 'Closed Virtue Mechanism' is another term for meditative observation—'virtue mechanism' refers to the impulse of life; 'closed' means sealed, unmoving. Thus, it appeared as if life were about to expire, and Ji Xian concluded he would not live.\"\n\nHuchi said: \"Bring him again.\" The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huchi again. Afterward, Ji Xian emerged and told Liezi: \"Fortunate is your master to have met me! He will recover—he is fully alive. I saw his 'Closed Potency.'\"\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Huchi. Huchi said: \"Just now I showed him 'Heaven and Earth'—where names and realities do not enter, and the mechanism stirs from the heels. He likely saw my 'Virtuous Mechanism.' 'Closed Potency' is movement within stillness; 'potency' is akin to 'mechanism,' but while 'mechanism' is subtle, 'potency' is more manifest. Within closure, the dynamic mechanism was revealed, so Ji Xian perceived full vitality. 'Heaven and Earth' is another term for observation—'Heaven’s Field' refers to the field above, not the earthly soil but the natural earth. This resembles how modern practitioners of self-cultivation refer to the space beneath the tongue as 'Heavenly Ford' and the top of the head as 'Mud Pill.' It signifies the impulse of life rising upward. 'Names and realities do not enter' means both being and non-being are transcended. 'The mechanism stirs from the heels' describes qi ascending from below, so subtle it is invisible. Thus, it is called the 'Virtuous Mechanism,' referring to the movement of one’s nature.\"\n\nHuchi said: \"Bring him again.\" The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huchi once more. Afterward, Ji Xian emerged and told Liezi: \"Your master is unsettled—I cannot divine him. Let him settle, and I will try again.\"\n\nLiezi entered and reported this to Huchi. Huchi said: \"Just now I showed him 'Supreme Vastness, Nothing Overcomes'—he likely saw my 'Balanced Qi Mechanism.' 'Supreme Vastness, Nothing Overcomes' is another term for observation—'Supreme Vastness' is the Great Void; 'Nothing Overcomes' means it cannot be grasped. 'Balanced' means even, half. When the movement of the qi mechanism reaches equilibrium—half in motion, half at rest—Ji Xian perceived it as unsettled, for it was neither fully active nor fully still.\"\n\n\"When the *ni* fish coils, it forms a deep pool; when still water pools, it forms a deep pool; when flowing water pools, it forms a deep pool. There are nine names for deep pools—here, three are revealed.\"\n\n\"*Ni* fish coiling,\" \"still water,\" and \"flowing water\" are all terms for observation. Modern Buddhists use them as meditative states, while ancients regarded them as deep pools. Just as Guanyin has twelve observations, there are nine names for deep pools. \"Verified\" means confirmed: the coiling of the *ni* fish is one observation, still water another, flowing water a third. Only now does Huchi reveal that what he previously showed the diviner were all these deep pools. \"I have nine deep pools, and I have only shown him three\"—implying that his wondrous depths are not yet exhausted.\n\nThe character \"verified\" (*shen*) should be read as \"coiled\" (*pán*), not as in *Liezi*’s \"nine deep pools.\" Hong Zicheng’s claim that *Liezi* surpasses *Zhuangzi* may not be entirely accurate. If all nine deep pools were fully explained, it would no longer be extraordinary prose. That they can be exhausted yet remain inexhaustible is precisely the marvel of Zhuangzi’s writing. Only those who understand literary refinement will grasp this. This chapter originally had four sections, but the discussion of the nine deep pools is placed in the fourth—such is the art of textual expansion and contraction.\n\nHuchi said: \"Bring him again.\" The next day, Liezi brought Ji Xian to see Huchi once more. Huchi stood, unsettled, and Ji Xian lost himself and fled. Huchi said: \"Pursue him.\" Liezi chased him but could not catch up. Returning, he reported to Huchi: \"He is gone—vanished. I could not reach him.\"\n\nHuchi said: \"Just now I showed him 'Not Yet Emerged from My Origin.' I met him with emptiness and compliance, so he knew not who or what I was. Thus, he took me for a withered reed, for drifting waves—hence his flight. 'Gone' and 'vanished' mean he could no longer perceive me. 'Not Yet Emerged from My Origin' is another term for observation. 'Empty' means void; 'compliance' means yielding, as if nothing were there, yet something were. Not knowing what it was, he called it 'who or what.' *Di* is read as *tui* (withered); 'withered reed' means collapsing; 'drifting waves' means surging. He saw me as neither emerging nor distinct, only as collapsing and surging—thus he lost himself and fled.\"",

      "translated_text": "Then Liezi, believing he had never truly begun to learn, returned home. For three years he did not venture out. He prepared meals for his wife as if feeding pigs, yet treated them as if feeding people. In his affairs, he took no personal part. He cast off refinement and returned to simplicity, standing alone like an uncarved block, his form present yet untouched by boundaries or divisions. Thus he remained to the end.\n\nFor his wife, he would take up the pestle at the hearth and cook in her stead, never leaving his post. \"Feeding pigs as if feeding people\" means gathering his spirit within, oblivious to all outward appearances. \"Taking no personal part in affairs\" means that though he engaged in tasks, he did so without self-awareness, as if not personally involved. \"Casting off refinement and returning to simplicity\" echoes the earlier idea of \"discarding the branches of the body and dismissing cleverness.\" \"Standing alone like an uncarved block\" is like a wooden figurine. *Feng* means boundaries; *zhen* means divisions. How could a form as simple as a wooden figurine possess such boundaries and divisions? \"Thus he remained to the end\" means he lived his life in this constant state—this unchanging constancy.\n\nBe not the host of fame, be not the storehouse of schemes, be not the bearer of tasks, be not the master of knowledge. Embrace the boundless and wander without trace. Exhaust what you have received from Heaven without claiming attainment—it is but emptiness, and that is all. The mind of the perfected person is like a mirror: it neither sends forth nor welcomes, responds yet does not retain. Thus it masters things without harm.\n\nHere, Zhuangzi once more expounds the principle of non-action. *Shi* means \"host\"; not taking fame as one’s master is the essence of \"not drawing near to fame.\" *Fu* means \"storehouse.\" Earlier, it was said, \"Do not scheme, do not plan\"—this is the same idea. To employ cleverness is to harbor intent in scheming; if one’s mind is set on planning, then planning becomes a storehouse. Where planning is unnecessary, the mind is free, hence \"be not the storehouse of schemes.\" Though affairs cannot be avoided, one should not take them as a personal burden, hence \"be not the bearer of tasks.\" Though one cannot be without knowledge, one should not take knowledge as one’s master, hence \"be not the master of knowledge.\" If the mind is fixed on anything, it becomes partial—these four \"nots\" are instructions for restraint, akin to the \"four forbearances\" in the *Analects*. *Ti* means \"to perceive\"; *cha* means \"to examine.\" Perceiving the Dao to its utmost, one’s mind wanders where there is no limit, no trace—hence \"embrace the boundless and wander without trace.\" *Zhen* means \"sign\"; *zhao* means \"beginning.\" \"Without trace\" is to be without beginning. Heaven endows us with this principle, and we exhaust it without claiming attainment—hence \"exhaust what you have received from Heaven without claiming attainment.\" To claim attainment is to approach the realm of traces. The Buddhist sutras speak of \"relying on illusion to awaken\"—this is the same idea. The passage culminates in the word \"emptiness,\" a forceful conclusion. Emptiness is spontaneity, free from attachment.\n\nThe mirror’s relation to things is this: beauty and ugliness come and go, yet the mirror reflects them without sending or welcoming. To send is to escort. To reflect form and see form, to reflect things and see things, is called \"responding.\" The mirror retains nothing, hence \"responds yet does not retain.\" The mind of the perfected person is like this, thus it is unobstructed by things—hence \"masters things without harm.\" The Dao of Heaven does not contend yet excels in victory—this is the meaning of \"masters.\" The several lines about the mirror clearly elucidate the earlier \"emptiness.\" Is the rhythm of this passage not extraordinary? Within its plainness lies divine artistry.\n\nThe Lord of the Southern Sea was Shu, the Lord of the Northern Sea was Hu, and the Lord of the Central Region was Hundun. Shu and Hu often met in Hundun’s land, and Hundun treated them very well. They conspired to repay his kindness, saying, \"All people have seven openings for seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing—only he has none. Let us try boring them for him.\" Each day they bored one opening, and on the seventh day, Hundun died.\n\nThis is but a metaphor: cleverness can burden the body, so Zhuangzi depicts it thus. To discard the branches of the body and dismiss cleverness is to become Hundun. Though the tale is ordinary, the embellishment of \"boring one opening each day\" is a stroke of genius. Shu, Hu, and Hundun are all allegories—one must not cling to them literally, or one becomes a fool dreaming dreams. Hundun is primordial qi. The human body has seven openings: like a newborn, the ears, eyes, nose, and tongue are formed but lack knowledge—this is Hundun’s wholeness. When knowledge begins to sprout, with likes and dislikes, the openings are bored. Mencius said, \"The great person does not lose the heart of a newborn\"—this is Hundun unborrowed. Zhuangzi’s telling is strange and fantastical, yet the writing is extraordinary.\n\nThe thirty-two chapters of the *Zhuangzi* are divided into Inner and Outer sections. The Inner Chapters number seven, each titled with three characters. From \"Webbed Toes\" onward, only the first two or three characters of the opening line are used as titles, like the *Analects*’ \"Learning\" and \"Governance.\" The book itself makes no distinction of refinement or coarseness—Inner and Outer Chapters are of the same quality. This division is merely to stir the ages. Some Outer Chapters, however, do have passages that are more expansive, leading some to claim the Inner Chapters are refined and the Outer coarse. This is not so.\n\nOthers have arranged the seven Inner Chapters in order, saying: First, one must \"Wander Far and Unfettered,\" then one can \"Equalize Things.\" Having equalized things, one should nurture the self, hence \"The Secret of Caring for Life\" follows. Having mastered self-nurture, one may wander in the world, hence \"The Human World\" follows. Wandering in the world, one causes others to turn toward oneself, hence \"The Sign of Full Virtue\" follows. With inner virtue full, it manifests outwardly. One takes the Dao as one’s teacher rather than following others, hence \"The Great and Venerable Teacher\" follows. Having attained this Dao, one may become a teacher to emperors and kings, hence \"Responding to Emperors and Kings\" follows. Though this sequence is plausible, such rigid adherence lacks profound meaning and differs from the *Book of Changes*’ sequence of hexagrams. The true way to read the *Zhuangzi* lies not in such constraints but in grasping the infinite vitality of its passages.\n\nThe most revealing part of a text is its conclusion. In the seven Inner Chapters, each ending is distinct: \"Wander Far and Unfettered\" concludes with \"usefulness and uselessness,\" \"Equalize Things\" with \"the butterfly dream and transformation,\" \"The Secret of Caring for Life\" with \"the transmission of fire,\" \"The Sign of Full Virtue\" with \"hardness and whiteness crying out,\" and \"The Human World\" with \"fate.\" Each has its purpose. Yet Zhuangzi, with artful craft, ends with the tale of Shu, Hu, and Hundun—\"on the seventh day, Hundun died.\" Is this not a marvelous mechanism? The *Doctrine of the Mean* begins with \"What Heaven imparts is called nature\" and concludes with \"Only Heaven is vast and silent, without sound or scent—supreme indeed!\"",

When my late master lectured on the *Spring and Autumn Annals* and reached the passage \"In the western hunt, a unicorn was captured,\" he remarked: *\"When it came to this point, even the Sage had something he could not know—hence he laid down his brush here.\"* That night, as we strolled along the western veranda, he suddenly asked, *\"How do you understand the capture of the unicorn?\"* I, Xi Que, replied, *\"It should be interpreted through the words of the *Doctrine of the Mean* on what even the Sage could not know—an insight no other school has offered. Yet if, at the time, there had been one more sentence after 'In the western hunt, a unicorn was captured,' the Master would surely not have recorded it.\"* My late master then asked, *\"How so?\"* I answered, *\"With such a conclusion, what more could be added?\"* The master said nothing and left; it was already late into the night. I immediately knocked on the door of Master Qiu of Bo Si and said, *\"Master Su’s reading of the *Spring and Autumn Annals* is most excellent. In all my years of studying it with friends, I have never encountered such insight.\"* We spoke with such delight that it was past midnight before I returned home. Two days later, Master Qiu of Bo Si recounted this to Xi Que.\n\n---\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"Webbed Toes\" (Chapter Eight)**\n\nWebbed toes and extra fingers arise from nature, yet they exceed virtue; growths and tumors emerge from form, yet they exceed nature. To multiply methods of benevolence and righteousness and apply them is to array them in the five organs, yet this is not the true alignment of the Dao and virtue. Thus, webbed toes are but connected useless flesh, and extra fingers are but superfluous digits. To multiply methods and apply them to the passions of the five organs is to indulge in perverse acts of benevolence and righteousness, and to overuse one’s intelligence.\n\nThe big toe and the fingers are natural; *pian* (webbed) means joined, and *zhi* (extra) means branching. What is born with one is called *xing* (nature), and what all humans share is called *de* (virtue). Webbed toes and extra fingers are deformities, yet when compared to what all humans share, they become excessive. Here, the meanings of *xing* and *de* differ slightly from those of the sages. Growths and tumors are also deformities, but while webbed toes and extra fingers exist from birth, growths and tumors arise after form has taken shape—hence it is said they *\"emerge from form yet exceed nature.\"* *Duo fang* (multiplying methods) means employing many approaches; *\"applying them\"* refers to their external use. *\"Arrayed in the five organs\"* means they do not arise from within. Since they are not the natural Dao, it is said they are *\"not the true alignment of the Dao and virtue.\"* Gaozi spoke of righteousness as external; Zhuangzi goes further, treating even benevolence as external. He regards benevolence and righteousness as perverse indulgences and groups them with intelligence, all of which he sees as contrary to the learning of inward cultivation. Thus, he perceives them as meddlesome and excessive—*\"multiplying methods\"* is akin to *\"meddling.\"*\n\nTherefore, those whose vision is webbed are confounded by the five colors, indulging in ornate patterns—are not the dazzling blues and yellows, the embroidered *fu* and *fu* of court robes, the work of Li Zhu? Those whose hearing is multiplied are confounded by the five tones, indulging in the six pitches—are not the sounds of metal, stone, silk, and bamboo, the grand harmonies of *Huang Zhong* and *Da Lü*, the work of Shi Kuang? Those who branch into benevolence pluck at virtue to block their nature, seeking fame and causing the world to clamor like reeds in the wind, upholding laws that fall short—are these not the deeds of Zengzi and Shishi? Those whose eloquence is webbed pile up tiles and knot ropes, weaving phrases and wandering in the labyrinths of *\"hard and white\"* and *\"same and different,\"* exhausting themselves in empty praise and useless words—are these not the ways of Yangzi and Mozi? Thus, all these are the paths of excessive branching and webbed growths, not the ultimate correctness of the world.\n\nThe five colors and ornate patterns—blues, yellows, *fu*, and *fu*—were used in antiquity to nurture the eyes, yet Zhuangzi saw them as chaotic and indulgent. Thus, *\"webbed vision\"* echoes Laozi’s *\"the five colors blind the eyes.\"* Li Zhu was a man of keen sight. If one doubts this, those who employ such vision will insist it is right.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"Is this not so?\"—yet Li Zhu is affirmed in this. The same applies to those who overreach in hearing and intention. For they treat ritual and music as external things. *\"Tugging\"* means to pull out, and *\"blocking\"* is like saying *\"thatch-blocked.\"* Virtue and nature are fundamentally quiescent, yet forcing oneself to practice benevolence is to tug at virtue and block one’s nature. *\"Laws\"* are standards, and *\"falling short\"* refers to what people find difficult to attain. Compelling others to follow laws that are hard to follow—hence it is said: *\"making the world pipe and drum to uphold laws that fall short.\"* *\"Piping and drumming\"* describes how words beguile and stir. To pile up tiles and knot ropes is to engage in futile affairs; the excessive speech of sophists drags on endlessly, layering without end and devoid of meaning—thus it is compared to piling tiles and knotting ropes. *\"Refining\"* means revising, as in revising one’s phrases to craft arguments—hence it is said: *\"weaving phrases and wandering in the labyrinths of 'hard and white' and 'same and different.'\"* *\"Exhausting\"* means laboring. *\"Kui\"* is pronounced like *\"qi\"*—to stand on tiptoe. Their words are all useless, yet they take pride in empty praise, toiling in vain—hence it is said: *\"exhausting themselves in empty praise and useless words.\"* If one doubts this, then the followers of Yangzi and Mozi will insist it is right.\n\n*\"Excessive branching and webbed growths\"* means superfluity. The Dao of nature is fundamentally without excess, yet all these are superfluous affairs, not the ultimate correctness. Ultimate correctness is the principle of what is inherently so. That which is ultimately correct does not lose the true condition of its nature and life—thus what is joined is not called *\"webbed,\"* what is branched is not called *\"overreaching,\"* what is long is not called *\"excessive,\"* and what is short is not called *\"deficient.\"* Therefore, though the teal’s legs are short, lengthening them brings sorrow; though the crane’s legs are long, severing them brings grief. Thus, what is long by nature cannot be cut, and what is short by nature cannot be extended—there is no sorrow to be removed. Is benevolence and righteousness not contrary to human nature? Why do they bring so much sorrow?\n\nUltimate correctness means what is naturally so. What is naturally so does not lose the true principle of its nature and life—though joined, it is not *\"webbed\";* though branched, it is not *\"overreaching\";* though long, it is not *\"excessive\";* though short, it is not *\"deficient.\"* These lines are deeply resonant, echoing the earlier saying: *\"Nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small.\"* *\"Overreaching\"* means to rise on tiptoe—where there is overreaching, there is no levelness; without levelness, there is no ease. Observe how deliberately these words are chosen—how could they be careless? *\"Long by nature\"* and *\"short by nature\"* mean that length and shortness arise from one’s inherent nature. What is long or short by nature is at peace—there is no sorrow to remove. The analogy of the teal and crane is most apt. *\"Yi\"* here is a sigh. Speaking of these two extremes, benevolence and righteousness are excessive—are they not contrary to human nature? Thus, if benevolence and righteousness arose naturally, they would not bring such sorrow. *\"Much sorrow\"* refers to the toil of those who practice benevolence and righteousness.\n\nIn Zhuangzi’s words, from Confucius and Mencius back to Yao, Shun, Yu, and Tang, all fall within the scope of his mockery. Moreover, those with webbed toes weep when they are split, and those with extra fingers wail when they are bitten—whether in excess or deficiency, their sorrow is the same. Now, the benevolent of this world furrow their brows in worry over the world’s calamities, while the unbenevolent sever the true condition of their nature and life to greedily pursue wealth and honor. Is benevolence and righteousness not contrary to human nature? Since the Three Dynasties, why has the world been so clamorous?\n\nThough webbed fingers and extra digits are both afflictions, they cannot be forcibly removed—removing them brings sorrow. *\"Branched\"* means an extra finger—hence it is said: *\"in excess of the proper number.\"* *\"Webbed\"* means two fingers joined and inseparable—hence it is said: *\"deficient in the proper number.\"* *\"Furrowed brows\"* means half-closed eyes; when one wishes to close them but cannot, the lashes bristle like reeds—hence it is said: *\"furrowed brows.\"* *\"Furrowed\"* refers to the mugwort and wormwood. *\"Furrowed brows\"* conveys the sense of sitting alone in sorrow, a deliberate choice of words by Zhuangzi to describe the toil of the benevolent who worry over the world’s calamities. The unbenevolent, greedy for wealth and honor, destroy their nature and life. Both bring self-inflicted suffering—hence they are spoken of together. Again, he sighs: *\"Is benevolence and righteousness not contrary to human nature?\"*",

Thus, all these are the paths of excessive branching and webbed growths, not the ultimate correctness of the world.\n\nThe five colors and ornate patterns—blues, yellows, *fu*, and *fu*—were used in antiquity to nurture the eyes, yet Zhuangzi saw them as chaotic and indulgent. Thus, *\"webbed vision\"* echoes Laozi’s *\"the five colors blind the eyes.\"* Li Zhu was a man of keen sight. If one doubts this, those who employ such vision will insist it is right.",

      "translated_text": "Viewed in this light, benevolence, righteousness, and trustworthiness do not arise from what is inherently so. *\"Clamorous\"* means noisy and chaotic. Since the Three Dynasties and below, how boisterously this doctrine has prevailed! Moreover, those who rely on hooks, cords, compasses, and squares to set things right are carving away at their nature; those who depend on ropes, glue, and lacquer to make things firm are encroaching upon their virtue. To bend and twist with rites and music, to soothe and coax with benevolence and righteousness in order to comfort the hearts of the world—this is to lose what is constant and natural. Nature is what is spontaneous; virtue is what is self-attained from Heaven. Neither is the work of human effort. If one must await cultivation and refinement before things are set right, this is self-mutilation. Hooks, cords, ropes, glue, and lacquer are all metaphors for cultivation. To encroach, carve, mutilate, and destroy—this is to fix and solidify. To bend one’s body for rites and music, to coax with words for benevolence and righteousness, and thereby seek to comfort the hearts of the world—all this is to lose the principle of inherent nature. Hence it is said: *\"to lose what is constant and natural.\"* *\"To soothe and coax\"* is like a mother’s gentle nurturing.\n\nWhat is constant and natural in the world? That which is crooked is not made straight by hooks, that which is straight is not made so by cords, that which is round is not made so by compasses, that which is square is not made so by squares. That which is joined or separated does not rely on glue and lacquer, nor is it bound by ropes and cords. Thus, all things in the world grow enticingly of themselves, yet none know how they grow; all attain their due, yet none know how they attain it. From ancient times to the present, this principle has never varied—it cannot be diminished. Then why must benevolence and righteousness cling unceasingly like glue and lacquer, like ropes and cords, wandering between the Dao and virtue? This only serves to confuse the world.\n\nThe lines below *\"what is constant and natural\"* share the same meaning as *\"that which joins does not form extra limbs, that which stands does not grow an extra toe.\"* Whether crooked or straight, round or square, joined or separated, or subjected to restraint—all should arise from spontaneity without reliance on human effort; only then is it the correct principle. *\"Enticingly\"* is like *\"weeds\"*—though weeds grow of themselves, who causes them to grow? What all things share—who bestows it? It is all spontaneous. Hence it is said: *\"none know how they grow, none know how they attain it.\"* *\"From ancient times to the present, never varied\"* means one and the same, enduring through all ages without diminution. *\"Unceasingly\"* means without end. Glue and lacquer bind fast; ropes and cords constrain. To depart from one’s nature in pursuit of benevolence and righteousness, persisting without end, is to become bound and constrained—how then can one wander through the gate of the Dao and virtue? This only serves to confuse the world.\n\nZhuangzi and Mencius were contemporaries. Mencius spoke solely of benevolence and righteousness; Zhuangzi spoke solely of the Dao and virtue. Thus, his writings consistently suppress benevolence and righteousness while expounding spontaneity, which has its own lofty subtleties. Yet his words often exceed what is fitting. Generally speaking, Zhuangzi’s conception of benevolence and righteousness differs in meaning from Mencius’s. Readers should recognize and distinguish this for themselves.\n\nMinor delusion confounds one’s direction; great delusion alters one’s nature. How do we know this is so? Since the time of Yu’s dynasty, when benevolence and righteousness were summoned to disturb the world, none have not rushed to answer the call of benevolence and righteousness. Is this not using benevolence and righteousness to alter one’s nature? Let us examine this: since the Three Dynasties and below, none in the world have not exchanged their nature for external things. The petty man sacrifices himself for profit; the scholar sacrifices himself for fame; the grandee sacrifices himself for his house; the sage sacrifices himself for the world. Though these several types differ in their undertakings and their reputations vary, in harming their nature and sacrificing themselves, they are one and the same. *\"Delusion\"* means confusion; *\"direction\"* refers to the four directions.",

      "translated_text": "In minor delusion, east and west, south and north become transposed; in great delusion, one loses the nature of Heaven and Earth. The upper line illustrates the lower: \"summoning\" is like what people today call a signboard. Erecting the name of benevolence and righteousness to disturb and confuse the world, it causes all under Heaven to rush toward benevolence and righteousness, hastening at its beck and call. Knowing benevolence and righteousness but not knowing the virtue of the Dao—this is exchanging one’s nature for external things. The petty man is enslaved to profit; the gentleman, to fame; the minister, to his house; the ruler, to the world. *\"Enslaved\"* means to forget oneself in following it—this is called *\"enslavement.\"* From Zhuangzi’s perspective, the world, the state, fame, and profit are all external things. To speak of the world and the state alongside fame and profit is to diminish the great with the small, to humble the high with the low—this is largely the method throughout the text.\n\nThese several types—referring to the sage, the minister, the scholar, and the petty man—though their undertakings and reputations differ, in forgetting themselves and harming their nature, they are one. All these are the errors of enslavement to things.\n\nZang and Gu were two men who herded sheep together and both lost their sheep. When asked what Zang was doing, he replied, \"Holding a bamboo slip and reading.\" When asked what Gu was doing, he replied, \"Gambling for sport.\" Though their pursuits differed, in losing their sheep, they were the same. Boyi died for fame beneath Shouyang Mountain, while Robber Zhi died for profit upon Dongling Heights. Though what they died for differed, in maiming their lives and harming their nature, they were the same. Why must Boyi be right and Robber Zhi wrong? All under Heaven are enslaved. Those who are enslaved to benevolence and righteousness are commonly called gentlemen; those enslaved to wealth and property are commonly called petty men. Yet in their enslavement, they are one—so where is the gentleman, and where is the petty man? If one considers the maiming of life and the harm to nature, then Robber Zhi is no different from Boyi. How then can one distinguish between gentleman and petty man?\n\nGambling and reading are two pursuits of differing worth, yet in losing the sheep, they are equal—this analogy is most apt. *\"Holding a bamboo slip\"* means holding a scroll. *\"Gambling\"* refers to casting dice; if one does not cast, it is called *\"blocking.\"* The dice are like today’s dice, also called *\"teeth\"* or *\"pips.\"* *\"Blocking\"* is the same as *\"obstructing.\"* Boyi and Robber Zhi—did Zhuangzi not know their worth? He merely used them to make his point. All these are instances of excess. Though gentlemen and petty men differ, in maiming life and harming nature, they are one. His intent is to satirize the gentleman, so he borrows the petty man to illustrate—this is again the meaning of diminishing the great with the small, humbling the high with the low.\n\nMoreover, can one truly bind one’s nature to benevolence and righteousness? Even those as upright as Zeng and Shi are not what I call *\"preserved.\"*",

      "translated_text": "\"Hui\" refers to Zeng Shen, and \"Shi\" to Zishi Yu. The name \"Qiu\" is likened to Yu Er, Shikuang, and Li Zhu, while comparing them to Zeng and Shi expresses the intent to humble the lofty. *\"Zang\"* denotes goodness, yet it is said: though this may be so, it is not what I deem good. To deem good its virtue and entrust to the natural endowment of one’s nature and fate—this is to follow the natural.\n\nWithin these few lines, such as *\"What I call 'clear' is not hearing others, but hearing oneself\"* and *\"What I call 'bright' is not seeing others, but seeing oneself\"*—the entire *Great Treasury of Sūtras* scarcely conveys this meaning. How could such words be uttered lightly? This *\"others\"* is no trifling matter; it is what Chan masters call *\"a mad dog chasing a clod\"* or *\"an illusory flower yielding an illusory fruit.\"* *\"Attaining one’s own attainment\"* and *\"fitting oneself to one’s own fitting\"*—this is *\"seeing oneself\"* and *\"awakening to oneself.\"* Generally, it is a matter of distinguishing the original mind from external things. To fail in grasping the original mind and instead gallop after externals—this is all excess and perversion.\n\n*\"Hearing oneself\"* and *\"seeing oneself\"*—in my writings, this aligns with the *Analects’* *\"silently recording it,\"* the *Book of Changes’* *\"silently accomplishing it, unspoken yet trusted,\"* Mencius’ *\"manifested in the four limbs, unspoken yet understood,\"* and Master Cheng Yi’s *Preface to the Spring and Autumn Annals*: *\"nurturing through deep immersion, silently recording, the mind penetrating\"*—all express this meaning, though stated with greater plainness.\n\nMaster Zhu [Xi] reproved the learning of [Lu] Xiangshan, saying that the scholars of Jiangxi all raised their brows and darted their eyes, boasting of profound awakening, and so he vehemently refuted and vigorously rejected such claims. Thus, in his *Collected Explanations of the Analects*, he glosses *\"recording\"* (*zhi*) as *\"remembering\"* (*zhi*), saying *\"silently remembering it.\"* For Mencius’ *\"unspoken yet understood,\"* he likewise says *\"not awaiting others’ words to understand for oneself,\"* refusing to speak of sudden awakening. This was due to his reproof, not the original purport of the *Analects* or *Mencius*. Yet if we consider Master Cheng Yi’s words *\"silently recording, the mind penetrating,\"* how could *\"recording\"* be read as *\"remembering\"*?\n\nNevertheless, those who study the Dao, when applying effort, often harbor a mind awaiting penetration and awakening—this is especially impermissible. As the saying goes: *\"Clinging to delusion while awaiting awakening is as distant as Mount Sumeru.\"* Sudden and gradual awakening each have their own mechanism; one cannot say there is gradualness without suddenness, nor must everyone attain it through sudden awakening. Zhonggong’s *\"maintaining reverence\"* is gradual, while Yan Hui’s *\"overcoming the self and returning to ritual\"* is sudden. Otherwise, why would it be said: *\"In one day, overcoming the self and returning to ritual, all under heaven will turn to benevolence\"*? What is benevolence? To attain it in a single day—what is this if not sudden awakening?\n\nObserve these lines: first, it raises the phrase *\"overcoming the self and returning to ritual is benevolence,\"* then says *\"in one day, overcoming the self and returning to ritual, all under heaven will turn to benevolence,\"* and further asks: *\"Is benevolence to be pursued by oneself or by others?\"*",

      "translated_text": "The cadence of these words rises and falls, much like the responses of Chan masters—only upon careful recitation and reflection does one taste their depth. Once Yanzi grasped the meaning at the words’ edge, he asked, *\"May I inquire about its details?\"* This is precisely what Chan calls *\"how to preserve and uphold it\"*—the *\"four negations\"* and *\"four restraints\"* are none other than the full realization of mind, the knowing of nature, and the knowing of Heaven, followed by the cultivation of mind, the nurturing of nature, the serving of Heaven, and the refining of the self to await destiny.\n\nWhen it says *\"to be benevolent depends on oneself,\"* this is what Chan means by *\"this matter cannot be forced by others.\"* Our late teacher once remarked: *\"Buddhist texts best verify our own; once verified, they become easily understood.\"*\n\n*\"Above, one dares not practice benevolence and righteousness\"*—this is *\"doing good without seeking fame.\"*\n*\"Below, one dares not engage in licentious and deviant conduct\"*—this is *\"doing evil without incurring punishment.\"*\nVirtue and the Dao are natural.\n\nI fear I fall short of virtue and the Dao. Though I do not commit acts that bring punishment, neither do I pursue deeds that seek fame—for to seek fame is to depart from the natural. Thus, I say: *\"I am ashamed before virtue and the Dao.\"* Therefore, *\"above, one dares not practice benevolence and righteousness, and below, one dares not engage in licentious and deviant conduct.\"*\n\nObserve Zhuangzi’s words—do they not also speak of rectifying the mind and cultivating the self? His mockery of Yao, Shun, Confucius, Zeng, and Bo Yi was never meant as serious critique; it was merely the flourish of his brush to rouse the reader. Liu Shuping of Tangdong once wrote a treatise comparing the *Zhuangzi* and the *Li Sao* as *\"different tunes played with equal skill,\"* saying: *\"Zhuang Zhou was a master of pent-up indignation.\"* Master Lexuan greatly admired this remark. It seems Zhuangzi, too, wrote this book out of indignation toward a corrupt world. His vision was lofty, his brushwork extraordinary—hence his occasional excesses. Sima Qian said of him: *\"He excelled in composition, diverging from conventional phrasing to depict events and express emotions. He borrowed from and critiqued the Confucians and Mohists, leaving even the most learned scholars of his time unable to defend themselves.\"* His words surge and swell, unbounded and self-indulgent, perfectly suiting his purpose—these few lines truly capture the essence of Zhuangzi.\n\n**Outer Chapters, \"Horse’s Hooves\" (Chapter Nine):**\n*\"A horse’s hooves can tread upon frost and snow; its coat can ward off wind and cold. It grazes on grass, drinks water, lifts its legs, and gallops—this is the true nature of the horse. Though there be grand halls and towering pavilions, they are of no use to it. But when Bo Le says, ‘I am skilled at managing horses,’ he burns their hooves, brands their flesh, trims their manes, pierces their nostrils, and binds them with reins and halters. He tethers them to stable posts and black troughs—already, two or three out of ten horses die. He starves them, parches them, races them, spurs them, aligns them, and disciplines them. Before them lie the torments of bits and ornaments; behind them, the threats of whips and restraints—more than half the horses perish.\"*\n\nThis passage speaks to how external things can burden the body.\n*\"Lifts its legs and gallops\"*—when any horse stands, its hooves naturally lift.\nHere, *\"grand halls and towering pavilions\"* refer to the palaces of kings.\n*\"Nourishment\"* (義) means *\"to sustain.\"*\n*\"Dwelling transforms qi; nurturing transforms the body\"*—this must have been the original meaning of these two characters.\n*\"Burning\"* refers to cauterizing the hooves; *\"trimming\"* means cutting them.\n*\"Carving\"* (刻) is also the trimming of hooves.",

      "translated_text": "\"Luo\" means to bridle and harness; \"ji\" is the headstall that binds the head; \"\" are the fetters that hobble the feet—what we now call the front and rear tethers. \"Lian\" means to arrange them in rows. \"Zao zhan\" are the black troughs and racks where the horses are lined up together. \"Zheng qi\" means to align and arrange them in orderly ranks. \"Jue\" is the bit; \"shi\" are the ornamental reins beneath the jaw—hence the saying, \"before them lie the torments of bits and ornaments.\" Horses are controlled by humans and cannot enjoy their natural joys, which is why so many die. This is the same meaning as Yuan Xian dragging his tail in the mud, though the phrasing here—with several \"zhi\" particles and the shift from \"two or three out of ten\" to \"more than half\"—is as richly woven as fine brocade. From this, countless brush techniques of past and present have sprouted. Some say this is a rough and erroneous passage from the Outer Chapters.\n\nThe potter says, \"I excel at shaping clay: what is round fits the compass, what is square fits the carpenter’s square.\" The craftsman says, \"I excel at working wood: what is curved fits the hook, what is straight aligns with the plumb line.\" Yet do clay and wood by nature desire to conform to compass, square, hook, and line? Still, generation after generation, people praise Bo Le for his skill in training horses and potters and carpenters for their skill in shaping clay and wood—this is also the error of those who govern the world.\n\nThe potter works clay; the craftsman works wood. Clay and wood are both fashioned by human hands into vessels, just as horses are scorched, trimmed, carved, bridled, raced, and drilled into alignment—do they not lose the natural qualities of earth and wood? People regard Bo Le and the artisans as capable, just as those from the time of Tai onward regard governing the world as a skill. This is the same idea as the earlier passage on benevolence and righteousness not being in accord with human nature. The meaning of these few lines is no more than this, though the wording is exquisite.\n\nIn my view, one who truly excels at governing the world does not act thus. The people have a constant nature: they weave to clothe themselves and till to feed themselves—this is called \"shared virtue,\" unified and impartial, named \"Heaven’s release.\" Thus, in the age of utmost virtue, their movements are unhurried, their gazes steady. At that time, mountains had no paths or tunnels, marshes no boats or bridges. The myriad things and all living beings dwelled together in their villages; birds and beasts formed flocks, grasses and trees grew freely. Thus, wild beasts could be led by tethers to roam, and the nests of birds and magpies could be climbed to peer into. In the age of utmost virtue, states dwelled among beasts, clans mingled with the myriad things—how could one distinguish between noble and base? Alike in ignorance, their virtue did not depart; alike in desirelessness, they were called \"plain and uncarved.\" In plainness and uncarved simplicity, the people’s nature was preserved.\n\n\"Shared virtue\" means what is received from Heaven is the same for all. Human life unfolds as each pursues their livelihood—some till, some weave—all following the natural workings of Heaven. Thus it is called \"constant nature,\" which is what the earlier passage referred to as \"constant thusness.\" \"Dang\" means partiality, leaning toward one side.",

People dwelled according to their locales, forming natural bonds—within each village, elders and juniors, superiors and inferiors were organically connected.

      "translated_text": "When desire is absent, one is purely in accord with Heavenly Principle—this is the state of the whole world, hence it is called \"the same.\" Free from desire, one does not depart from wholeness and simplicity, from unadorned purity. In that time, each attained the joy of its own nature, and so it is said: \"Unadorned and simple, the people’s nature was fulfilled.\" \"Its virtue does not depart\" means it remains unadorned and simple. These two phrases follow one another, and the latter condenses the former into just \"unadorned and simple\"—such is the method of ancient prose. Modern writing no longer observes such discipline.\n\nWhen the Sage stumbles and strains to enact benevolence, stretches and strains to enact righteousness, the world begins to doubt. When it sprawls and scatters to enact music, plucks and twists to enact ritual, the world begins to divide. Thus, if unhewn simplicity is not marred, what need is there for sacrificial goblets? If white jade is not shattered, what need is there for ritual scepters? If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, what need is there for benevolence and righteousness? If nature and feeling are not estranged, what need is there for ritual and music? If the five colors are not disordered, what need is there for patterned ornament? If the five tones are not disordered, what need is there to respond to the six pitch-pipes?\n\nTo mar simplicity to make vessels is the fault of the craftsman. To shatter the Dao and virtue to make benevolence and righteousness is the error of the Sage. The preceding passage spoke of Bole; this passage speaks of the Sage—what follows echoes what came before. *Biexie* describes the manner of forced, halting movement; *diqi* describes the manner of uneasy standing and walking. *Chanman* is the same as *hanman*, meaning dissolute and unrestrained; *zhaipi* describes the use of hands and feet, with *pi* pronounced like *bo* (as in *pibo*). Here, ritual and music, benevolence and righteousness, are wrung from the midst of self-abasement—though the words may seem unorthodox, the phrasing is striking. \"Begins to divide\" means that hearts and traces begin to diverge; once divided, they are no longer pure and unified. Such instances of the word \"divide\" are all well-placed.\n\nGoblets are carved from wood, so it is said: \"If unhewn simplicity is not marred, what need is there for sacrificial goblets?\" Jade must be cut to become a vessel, so it is said: \"If white jade is not shattered, what need is there for ritual scepters?\" The Dao and virtue are natural; Zhuangzi treats benevolence and righteousness as external, hence: \"If the Dao and virtue are not abandoned, what need is there for benevolence and righteousness?\" Nature and feeling are inherent; Zhuangzi treats ritual and music as forced upon the world, hence: \"If nature and feeling are not estranged, what need is there for ritual and music?\" Mencius spoke of \"refining these two\" and \"delighting in these two\"—such are the words of sages and worthies. In this text, however, the meanings of \"ritual and music\" and \"benevolence and righteousness\" differ, as they are all regarded as external things.\n\nPatterned ornament disrupts the five colors; the six pitch-pipes disrupt the five tones—both are metaphors for the use of human effort rather than natural spontaneity. \"The fault of the craftsman\" and \"the error of the Sage\" are concluding phrases for the preceding passage.\n\nHorses, when dwelling on land, eat grass and drink water; when pleased, they entwine necks and nuzzle; when angry, they turn their backs and kick. This is all the knowledge horses possess. But when yokes and crossbars are placed upon them, when forehead ornaments are fitted to them, horses learn to glare defiantly, to resist the bit, to rear fiercely, to feign submission, to seize the bit, and to steal the bridle. Thus, the knowledge horses possess that enables them to become thieves is the fault of Bole.\n\nIn the time of the Lord of Brightness, people dwelled without knowing what to do, walked without knowing where to go; they filled their cheeks with food and played, patted their bellies and wandered—this was all the ability people possessed. But when the Sage bent and twisted ritual and music to correct the world’s form, dangled and dangled benevolence and righteousness to console the world’s heart, the people then began to stand on tiptoe, to love cunning, to contend for profit, and this could not be stopped. This, too, is the error of the Sage.\n\nThis analogy again condenses the preceding discourse into a few lines, adding several phrases that make it all the more striking. When pleased, they entwine necks and nuzzle; when angry, they turn their backs and kick—this is clearly a painted image of horses. *Xiangmi* means to rub against one another. Observe how the phrases \"entwine necks\" and \"turn their backs\" are employed. *Henge* refers to the crossbar on a carriage; *e* is the yoke. *Yueti* is what is now called a forehead mirror. *Jieni* means to stand alone, to glare defiantly in anger. *Yine* means to curve the neck and resist the bit, refusing the bridle. *Zhi* means fierce; *man* means to charge. The manner of refusing restraint and butting against one another. *Gui* means to scheme; *qie* means to act stealthily. Scheming to take the bit, stealthily applying the bridle—all are the result of the horse’s fierce resistance to being tamed, making the use of bit and bridle so laborious.\n\nIf horses oppose humans, they are called thieves—their knowledge of this is due to Bole. Without the imposition of yokes, crossbars, bits, and bridles, horses would remain horses and humans would remain humans; how would one see their defiant, resistant postures?\n\n\"People’s ability was limited to this\" means that this was the extent of human capacity. *Kuang* means to correct. Using ritual and music to correct people’s form, using benevolence and righteousness to console people’s hearts—these are all inventions of the Sage, absent in high antiquity. *Xianqi* means to raise and display; *diqi* means to be ill at ease. Loving cunning and contending for profit are like the horse’s scheming to seize the bit and stealthily apply the bridle.\n\nThe Inner and Outer Chapters resemble the *Zuozhuan* and *Guoyu*—all were composed by the same hand. The *Zuozhuan* was completed, and then the *Guoyu* was written, though its style differs from the *Zuozhuan*.

      "translated_text": "The *Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Four\nBy Lin Xiang of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Outer Chapters: \"Opening the Satchel\" (Chapter Ten)**\n\nWhen one prepares to guard against thieves who would pry open satchels, rummage through sacks, or force open chests, one must bind cords tightly, fasten bolts securely, and lock clasps firmly—this is what the common world calls \"wisdom.\" Yet when a great thief arrives, he hoists the chest, shoulders the satchel, and carries off the sack, hurrying away in fear only that the cords, bolts, and locks are not secure enough. Then does not what was once called \"wisdom\" become merely the amassing of goods for the great thief?\n\nLet us examine this: Is there any so-called \"wisdom\" in the common world that does not amass for the great thief? Is there any so-called \"sage\" who does not guard for the great thief? How do we know this is so? In ancient times, the state of Qi had neighboring towns within sight of one another, where the sounds of chickens and dogs could be heard across the land. Nets and snares were spread wide, and plows and hoes pierced the earth—an expanse of over two thousand *li* square. Within its four borders, all that was established—ancestral temples and altars of soil and grain, the governance of cities, villages, districts, and hamlets—was it not all modeled after the sages’ laws? Yet Tian Chengzi, in a single day, murdered the ruler of Qi and stole the state. What he stole was not merely the state—he also stole the sages’ wisdom and laws along with it. Thus, Tian Chengzi bore the name of a thief and brigand yet dwelt in the security of Yao and Shun. Small states dared not condemn him; great states dared not punish him. For twelve generations, he held the state of Qi—was this not the theft of the state of Qi *together* with its sagely wisdom and laws, using them to guard his thieving self?\n\nReading this chapter, one perceives its fierce indignation and grandeur. The author crafts a striking metaphor, unique in its artistry.\n*Qu* (胠) means to open; *tan* (探) means to reach in and take; *fa* (发) also means to open.",

      "translated_text": "Are not the six characters \"the theft of a rat’s pilfering\" a stroke of literary brilliance? *Jian* (缄) and *teng* (縢) are knots and bindings; *she* (摄) is to coil and wrap; *jiong* (扃) are bolts and keys; *jue* (鐍) are locks. The wisdom of the common world exists only to guard against the pilfering of rats—yet when the great thief arrives, he carries it all away in one haul. Tian’s usurpation of Qi, lending with private measures and collecting with public ones—what the *Zuozhuan* describes is precisely the borrowing of the sages’ laws to advance his thieving schemes. Such was the way of things in the Warring States era, and thus Zhuangzi drew this analogy.\n\nLet us examine it: Is there any so-called \"utmost wisdom\" that does not serve to amass for the great thief? Any so-called \"utmost sageliness\" that does not serve to guard for the great thief? How do we know this to be so? In ancient times, Long Feng was beheaded, Bi Gan was disemboweled, Chang Hong was torn limb from limb, and Wu Zixu’s corpse was left to rot—though these four were men of virtue, they could not escape execution. Yet when Zhi’s followers asked him, \"Does theft also have its Dao?\" Zhi replied, \"Where is there anything that does not have its Dao? To divine the treasures hidden in a chamber—that is sageliness. To enter first—that is courage. To exit last—that is righteousness. To know what can and cannot be done—that is wisdom. To divide spoils equally—that is benevolence. Without these five, no one in the world has ever become a great thief.\" From this, we see that the good man cannot stand without the Dao of the sage, nor can Zhi act without the Dao of the sage. If the good men of the world are few and the ungood many, then the sage’s benefit to the world is slight, while his harm is great.\n\n*Chi* (胣) means to tear apart; *mi* (靡) means to shred—both describe how they were condemned and their bodies destroyed. Though the four were virtuous, they all met with punishment, while the thief Zhi escaped unscathed. This shows that the virtuous cannot rely on themselves, and those who steal the name of the sagely Dao may use it for their own gain. The thief’s sageliness, courage, righteousness, wisdom, and benevolence—these are the names Zhuangzi fabricated to mock the Confucians. Though his words are strange, when viewed through the lens of worldly affairs, they hold truth. To say that the ungood are many and the good few, that the sage’s benefit to the world is slight while his harm is great—this is a most incisive observation.\n\nThus it is said: When the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold; when the Lu wine was weak, Handan was besieged. When the sage is born, the great thief arises. Only by smashing the sages and abandoning wisdom, releasing the thieves and brigands, does the world begin to be ordered. When the river runs dry, the valley empties; when the hills are leveled, the abyss fills. Once the sage is dead, the great thief no longer rises, and the world is at peace without incident. If the sage does not die, the great thief does not cease. Even if the sage is revered to govern the world, this is but to heap profit upon the thief Zhi.\n\nWhen Chu attacked Lu because its wine was weak, Liang then attacked Zhao because Lu could not come to its aid. Lips and teeth seem unrelated, yet when the lips are gone, the teeth grow cold of themselves. Rivers and valleys seem unconnected, yet when the river runs dry, the valley empties of itself. Hills and abysses seem unrelated, yet when the hills are leveled, the abyss fills of itself—just as people today say, \"Zhang drinks the wine, but Li grows drunk.\" This is to say that the sages’ laws are not made for thieves, yet they become the thieves’ resources. Thus it is said: When the sage is born, the great thief arises; when the sage does not exist, the great thief does not rise. Only by smashing the sages and releasing the thieves and brigands—only then, with neither sages nor thieves, does the world find order.\n\nWhen the river is full, the mountain valleys are all filled with water; when the river runs dry, the valley empties of itself. Though rivers and valleys are not connected, their spring floods and autumn droughts are the same. *Qiu yi* (丘夷) means the hills are leveled and flattened—like saying the mountains are eroded and return to the earth. When the hills are leveled, their soil fills the abyss, showing how things unrelated are yet mutually dependent. *Wu gu* (无故) means without incident. *Chong shengren er zhi* (重圣人而治) means the sage reappears. When the sage reappears and his laws grow ever more intricate, deceivers find in them even greater means to deceive the world. Thus it is said: to heap profit upon the thief Zhi.\n\nWhen measures like *dou* and *hu* are made to quantify, the thief steals them along with the grain. When scales and balances are made to weigh, the thief steals them along with the goods. When tallies and seals are made to authenticate, the thief steals them along with the authority. When benevolence and righteousness are made to rectify, the thief steals them along with the virtues. How do we know this to be so? Those who steal hooks are executed, while those who steal states become lords—yet at the gates of these lords, benevolence and righteousness reside. Is this not the theft of benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom?\n\nThe *dou*, *hu*, scales, balances, tallies, seals, benevolence, and righteousness—these eight are spoken of together to humble the lofty. Stealing a hook is a petty theft, for a hook is but a belt ring. Yet the lords of the Warring States era, who gained power through usurpation, were all great thieves. The petty are executed, while the great attain such heights—this is the indignation of one who rails against the world. Once they become lords, their rule is built on loving the people and benefiting things, yet this is not merely the theft of the state—it is the theft of the sages’ benevolence, righteousness, sageliness, and wisdom.\n\nThus, when the great thief arises, he seizes the lords, stealing benevolence and righteousness along with the profits of *dou*, *hu*, scales, balances, tallies, and seals. Though rewards of high rank and emolument are offered, they cannot encourage; though the threat of the executioner’s axe looms, it cannot deter. That this heaping of profit upon the thief Zhi cannot be stopped is the fault of the sages. Thus it is said: The fish cannot leave the abyss; the state’s sharpest tools cannot be shown to others. The sage is the world’s sharpest tool—he is not meant to be displayed to the world.\n\nThose called great thieves are pursued by all, yet today’s lords, all usurpers of states, stand above the people—who does not see this? Thus it is said: Such great thieves are manifest in the world, stealing benevolence, righteousness, *dou*, *hu*, scales, balances, tallies, and seals—yet the world offers no rewards to capture them, no punishments to forbid them. This is the indignation of one who rails against the world. \"The fish cannot leave the abyss\" means it cannot leave the water. The sages’ laws can only be used by oneself; they cannot be made known to all. Thus it is said: they are not meant to be displayed to the world. *Ming* (明) means to make known to all under heaven.\n\nThus, only by cutting off sageliness and discarding wisdom does the great thief cease. Smash the jades and shatter the pearls, and petty thieves will not rise. Burn the tallies and break the seals, and the people will return to simplicity. Break the *dou* and snap the scales, and the people will not contend. Only when the sages’ laws are utterly destroyed can the people begin to be spoken with.\n\nSmashing jades, shattering pearls, burning tallies, breaking seals, splitting *dou*, and snapping scales—these are all extreme statements to conclude the argument for cutting off sageliness and discarding wisdom; they are not meant as practical discourse. *Dan can* (殚残) means to destroy and abolish. Only when the sages’ laws are entirely removed can the people become pure and unified, fit to be spoken with of the Dao. Thus it is said: the people can then begin to be spoken with. These are all the words of one who rails against the world, and so people often mock the splitting of *dou*, the snapping of scales, the burning of tallies, and the breaking of seals. Yet in truth, this is no different from Laozi’s idea that \"not prizing rare goods will keep the people from stealing\"—it is merely stated in an extreme manner. As Su Dongpo said, \"When a man learns to read, his troubles begin\"—yet who would wish the world’s people to remain entirely illiterate?",

For twelve generations, he held the state of Qi—was this not the theft of the state of Qi *together* with its sagely wisdom and laws, using them to guard his thieving self?\n\nReading this chapter, one perceives its fierce indignation and grandeur. The author crafts a striking metaphor, unique in its artistry.\n*Qu* (胠) means to open; *tan* (探) means to reach in and take; *fa* (发) also means to open.",

      "translated_text": "The two phrases on clarity and skill share the same meaning—hence, the character \"skill\" brings to mind Laozi’s saying, \"Great skill appears clumsy,\" which serves as corroboration. This, too, is a matter of literary technique. Zeng and Shi bore names of loyalty and filial piety; Yang and Mo spoke of benevolence and righteousness. Cast them aside, discard them, and let the doctrines of benevolence and righteousness cease to circulate—then the people of the world will equally attain this virtue, and all will return to the profound and wondrous.\n\n*Not to be dazzled* means not to dissipate; *not to be burdened* means to be free from entanglement; *not to be deluded* means not to deceive one another; *not to be perverse* means to be without bias or deviation. To speak of Zeng, Shi, Yang, and Mo alongside Master Kuang, the craftsman Chui, and Li Zhu is to diminish the great by means of the small. Those who *externally establish their virtue* value external things and lose their original mind. *To dazzle and disrupt* means to scorch and confound. From the perspective of the correct Dao, such people are of no use—indeed, they ought to be cast aside. Thus it is said, \"such are those whom the Dao deems useless.\" This concluding phrase is rendered with great force, a fine example of literary excellence.\n\nYet you alone do not know of the age of utmost virtue? In ancient times, there were the clans of Rongcheng, Dating, Bohuang, Zhongyang, Lilu, Lixu, Xuanyuan, Hexu, Zunlu, Zhu Rong, Fuxi, and Shennong—twelve clans in all. Only Xuanyuan, Fuxi, and Shennong appear in the classics; those before them are absent from my books. Some may have been transmitted from antiquity, while others may have been fabricated by Zhuangzi himself—much like the Buddhist claim, \"In a past kalpa, I...\" Though it may seem boastful, when viewed within the scope of heaven and earth, the three thousand-odd years since Fuxi that can be verified in the records are but a fraction. How could there not have been vast ages before Fuxi, unrecorded in the Six Classics? To speak of them may verge on the fantastical, yet they cannot be entirely dismissed. Consider my own land of Min: only since Wuzhu has it been recorded in the Han, and only after the Tang did it gradually acquire culture and refinement. Before Wuzhu, it must have remained in a state of primitive simplicity. Recently, near Nangshan Temple, farmers plowing the fields suddenly uncovered a cavern filled with vessels of gold and jade, tripods, and ritual bronzes—so many that people secretly carried them away. When the cavern was finally emptied, the villagers all flocked to see it. The bricks, large and small, were carved with figures, dragons, and tigers of exquisite craftsmanship—this was the former cavern. Later, when they struck one wall with hoes and axes, it resounded with a *tang-tang* echo, yet it was too solid to dislodge, likely reinforced with bronze or iron. It must have been the tomb of a ruler, for otherwise, why would the records of Min’s past make no mention of it? Thus, there must have been such things, though they were not transmitted. By the same token, the clans of Rongcheng and Dating cannot be said never to have existed. In that age...",

      "translated_text": "When the people knotted cords to use in place of writing, found their food sweet and their garments fine, delighted in their customs and dwelled in peace, when neighboring states lay within sight of one another and the sounds of their roosters and dogs carried between them, yet the people lived to old age and died without ever traveling beyond their lands—such was the age of perfect governance.\n\nNow, however, the people crane their necks and stand on tiptoe, saying, “There is a worthy in such-and-such a place,” and they pack provisions to hasten toward him. Thus, they abandon their parents at home and forsake their lords’ service abroad, their footprints crisscrossing the borders of the feudal lords, their carriage tracks entangling lands a thousand *li* away. This is the fault of those above who prize knowledge.\n\nIf those above truly favor knowledge yet lack the Dao, the world will fall into great chaos. How do we know this is so? When food is sweet, yet the people below still hunger; when mountains lack paths and tunnels, yet they still carve them out—this is the same as when they hear of a worthy in some place and rush toward him with packed provisions. This is covertly criticizing Mencius and Xunzi, and if we trace it further, Confucius is included as well.\n\nObserve the scholars of the Jixia Academy in Qi and the followers of Su Qin and Zhang Yi, and you will see why Zhuangzi, responding to the customs of his time, made such arguments. To favor knowledge is to depart from the Dao of nature.\n\nThus it is said: to favor knowledge yet lack the Dao—when the knowledge of bows, crossbows, fowling nets, and cunning schemes proliferates, birds are thrown into chaos above; when the knowledge of hooks, bait, dragnets, and fish traps multiplies, fish are thrown into chaos in the waters; when the knowledge of snares, fences, and hunting nets spreads, beasts are thrown into chaos in the marshes; when the transformations of cunning deceit, insidious poison, obstinate confusion, the “hard and white,” the “resolving of grime,” and the “same and different” abound, the common folk are bewildered by sophistry.\n\nThus, the world repeatedly falls into great chaos, and the blame lies in the love of knowledge. *Bi* refers to a handled net; *yi* and *zhuo* denote shooting with arrows; *jibian* means deceptive schemes; *xuege* are what the Han called *chuxu*—like today’s wooden palisades—also used to trap deer and rabbits; *jufu* is another kind of net. “Cunning deceit” means using intelligence to deceive one another; “insidious poison” means gradually corrupting and poisoning one another; *xiejie* means obstinate and unruly; *hua* means muddled and chaotic; *jiegou* means clashing horns. “Hard and white,” “resolving of grime,” and “same and different” were all names used by the disputers of the time. To speak of fishing, fowling, and hunting alongside the sophists is akin to Zhuangzi’s intent in satirizing Zengzi and Shishu alongside bushels and scales—repeatedly, time and again, such things lead to great chaos, all due to the fault of prizing knowledge.\n\nTherefore, the world all knows to seek what it does not know yet does not know to seek what it already knows; all knows to condemn what it does not consider good yet does not know to condemn what it already considers good. This is why there is great chaos.\n\nNot knowing is the pursuit of external and strange things; already knowing refers to what is clear and easily seen—these are the principles of nature. What is not good lies in others; what is already good lies within oneself. This is what *Qi Wu* means by “affirming what one affirms and negating what one negates.” To know only the faults of others while being blind to one’s own rightness is also wrong.\n\nThus, those above obstruct the brightness of the sun and moon, below they scorch the essence of mountains and rivers, and in between they disrupt the workings of the four seasons. Even the creatures that breathe and creep, the tiny and the winged, all lose their nature—how severe is the chaos wrought by the love of knowledge!\n\nFrom the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case: abandoning the people of simple diversity and delighting in the toiling flatterers, forsaking the tranquil and effortless and delighting in the clamorous and contentious.

      "translated_text": "The swarms of bees and butterflies—*xiao* in sound like the rustling wind—embody the myriad forms of fruiting shells. *Ruyi* describes the ceaseless toil of outward striving, while *zhunzhun-nieznie* denotes the murmuring and whispering of contention. The preceding passage having concluded, it now grounds its claim in the Three Dynasties, declaring: \"From the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case.\" The paired phrases *zhunzhun* and *ruyi* are set in parallel, but only *zhunzhun* is singled out to close the argument, echoing the earlier passage: \"When simplicity and plainness prevail, the people’s nature is preserved.\" The *Qiwulun* states: \"Tang’s inquiry of Ji...\"—this is an opening phrase. Here, it says: \"From the Three Dynasties onward, this has been the case\"—a closing phrase. Though their openings and closings differ, they turn on the same axis.\n\nThe Outer Chapters, in the eleventh section, *In You*, declare: \"I have heard of letting the world be, but not of governing it.\" *In* means to fear the world’s indulgence in its nature; *you* means to fear the world’s deviation from its virtue. If the world neither indulges its nature nor deviates from its virtue, who would need to govern it? In ancient times, when Yao governed the world, he made its people joyful, each delighting in their nature—yet this was not tranquility. When Jie governed the world, he made its people weary, each suffering in their nature—yet this was not contentment. That which is neither tranquil nor content is not virtue; and that which is not virtue cannot endure long in the world. Thus: \"I have heard of letting the world be, not of governing it.\" This passage again opens with a thematic statement, adopting yet another form.\n\n*In* conveys the sense of ease and self-possession—indulgence is disorder. In stillness, there is no indulgence. *You* conveys the sense of magnanimity and self-contentment—deviation is being swayed by external things. If the nature of the world’s people is not disordered and their virtue is not swayed by externals, what need is there for governance? Neither tranquility nor stillness, neither contentment nor joy—Yao is contrasted with Jie, just as Zeng and Shi are contrasted with Robber Zhi. The momentum of the entire text follows this pattern, though its principles remain uncorrected. Yet who could match its literary force? To equate the lack of tranquility with the lack of contentment is to disregard their weight.\n\nWhen one’s joy is excessive, it injures the yang; when one’s anger is excessive, it injures the yin. When yin and yang are both injured, the four seasons fail to arrive, the harmony of cold and heat is disrupted, and their inversion harms the human form. Thus, people’s joy and anger lose their proper place; their dwellings become unsettled; their thoughts grow restless and uncentered; the mean is no longer ordered. From this, the world first becomes haughty, perverse, and fierce—leading later to the conduct of Robber Zhi, Zeng, and Shi.\n\nTherefore, even if the entire world were mobilized to reward the good, it would not suffice; even if the entire world were mobilized to punish the wicked, it would not be enough. The vastness of the world is inadequate for such rewards and punishments. From the Three Dynasties onward, the world has been in tumult, ever preoccupied with rewards and punishments. How could it have leisure to nurture the true essence of its nature and destiny?\n\nJoy pertains to yang; anger, to yin. *Pi* means excess—the medical texts call this \"the illness of surplus.\" When the mean and harmony are achieved, Heaven and Earth assume their proper positions. Without the mean and harmony, the four seasons fail to arrive, and the balance of cold and heat is lost. When the sequence of qi is inverted, people fall ill.\n\n*Shi ren* refers to the way Yao and Jie, from their positions above, brought about such conditions in the people. Joy and anger lose their proper place; dwellings become unsettled—this is reckless action and movement. \"Restless thoughts, coming and going, following friends and companions\"—this is the mind uncentered. *Cheng zhang* means order and coherence. Without order, the mean is lost.",

      "translated_text": "Exaltation strives for loftiness yet overreaches; *jie* denotes arguments that interrogate and reproach. *Zhuo* means isolation; *zhi*, ferocity and severity. These four terms all describe the meaning of disharmony. Robber Zhi and Zeng Shen and Shi Yu merely substitute the words \"worthy\" and \"unworthy\"—when the mind is not in harmony, neither worthiness nor unworthiness is genuine.\n\nThose who govern the world reward the so-called worthy and punish the so-called unworthy. Yet what passes for worthiness is not true worthiness, arising from a fondness for pretense—such is the way of the entire world. Thus, the desire to reward is never sufficient, nor is the capacity to do so. This speaks to the multitude of such people in the world. The intent here is to satirize the \"worthy,\" contrasting them with evildoers, thereby heavily suppressing the truly worthy.\n\nWhen all people admire rewards and shun punishments, engaging in pretense among themselves, how can they ever settle into the natural principles of their nature and destiny? Moreover, delighting in \"clarity\" is lewdness in form; delighting in \"keenness\" is lewdness in sound. Delighting in \"benevolence\" is disorder in virtue; delighting in \"righteousness\" is perversion of principle. Delighting in \"ritual\" is competition in technique; delighting in \"music\" is competition in excess. Delighting in \"sagacity\" is competition in artistry; delighting in \"knowledge\" is competition in fault-finding.\n\nIf these eight remain in the world, the true essence of nature and destiny may yet endure; if they vanish, it may yet endure. But when the world fails to preserve the true essence of nature and destiny, these eight begin to shred, coil, and entangle it, throwing the world into chaos. Yet the world then reveres and cherishes them—how profound is the world’s delusion! Is this merely a matter of excess to be discarded? Instead, they fast and purify themselves to speak of them, kneel and sit to present them, drum and sing to dance for them. What is to be done about this?\n\nPursuing \"clarity\" and favoring the five colors, or pursuing \"keenness\" and favoring the five sounds—both disrupt one’s true nature. Thus it is said: excess in virtue and departure from natural principle—benevolence and righteousness are contrived with intention, thereby causing disorder in virtue and perversion of principle.

Thus it is said: their presence is acceptable, and their absence is acceptable. If one does not rest in naturalness, then the eight become harmful. *Luǎn juǎn jú shù* describes the appearance of being carved, rolled, constrained, and bound; *cāng náng* describes the appearance of meddlesome busyness. \"Is this merely a matter of excess to be discarded?\" means one does not merely dabble in a single transgression before immediately ceasing.\n\n\"Fasting and purifying to speak of them\" refers to treating them with solemnity and exaggerating their importance. \"Kneeling and sitting to present them\" means offering them with utmost reverence and ceremony. \"Drumming and singing to dance for them\" means that words alone are insufficient, so one resorts to hand-dancing and foot-stamping.

This is a matter of literary convention. Thus, when the noble person cannot avoid governing the world, nothing is better than non-action. Only through non-action can one preserve the natural dispositions of life and destiny. Therefore, one who values their person over ruling the world may be entrusted with the world; one who cherishes their person over ruling the world may be charged with the world.\n\nIf the noble person can refrain from disturbing their five viscera or overtaxing their faculties, abiding in stillness like a dormant dragon yet manifesting like a dragon in flight, remaining silent as a deep abyss yet thundering like a storm, moving with spirit yet following heaven’s course, and acting with effortless non-action—then the myriad things will transform of themselves, as if steaming and piling up. How then would I have leisure to govern the world?\n\nThis passage directly expounds the governance of non-action and naturalness. The phrase \"cannot avoid\" already conveys the idea of possessing the world yet not engaging with it. Because one’s person is more valuable than ruling the world, only then can the world be entrusted to them; because one’s person is more beloved than ruling the world, only then can the world be charged to them. These two lines are both strikingly phrased and profoundly reasoned.

Dwelling like a corpse in non-action, one’s bearing naturally becomes a model, hence the phrase \"dwelling like a corpse yet dragon manifest.\" *Abyss* denotes depth; *silence*, the absence of speech. *Thunderous voice* stirs others—though one does not speak, one’s virtue moves them, much as Chan masters say: though silent, their voice resounds like thunder. Thus, \"abyssal silence yet thunderous voice.\" *Spirit* is the numinous; *Heaven*, the heavenly principle. In every movement and gesture, nothing departs from the heavenly principle, hence \"spirit moves and Heaven follows.\" Can these three lines truly mark the *Zhuangzi* as a heretical text? Its principles are profound, its phrasing extraordinary—thus it surpasses all other masters.\n\n*Steaming and piling* evokes the image of \"wild horses and dust motes,\" where living things breathe upon one another in mutual animation. *Steaming* is movement; *piling*, the accumulation of fine, innumerable particles. In an empty chamber where sunlight enters like an egg, one may observe the dust in the beam—these two words are strikingly chosen: seeming to move yet not moving, seeming many yet without visible multitude. Thus, \"steaming and piling.\" If I were to practice non-action above, the people below would rise at sunrise and rest at sunset, content and at ease, like the myriad things steaming and piling of their own accord. Why then should I trouble myself to govern them?\n\nCui Qu asked Lao Dan, \"If one does not govern the world, how can the human heart be settled?\" Lao Dan replied, \"Take care not to disturb the human heart. The human heart presses downward when suppressed and surges upward when indulged; in its rising and falling, it is imprisoned and slain. Supple and yielding, it may soften the rigid; sharp and incisive, it may be carved and polished. Its heat scorches like fire, its cold congeals like ice, its swiftness darts like lightning. In the span of a single bow and rise, it may twice caress the ends of the earth. Abiding, it is abyssal and still; moving, it hangs suspended like Heaven. Proud and untetherable—is this not the human heart?\"\n\nThis passage, when read alongside Mencius’ \"entering and exiting without fixed time, direction unknown,\" reveals its extraordinary depth. *Undisturbed* means unagitated, free from disruption. *Pressing downward* describes the heart in low spirits, appearing ever more despondent; when favored, it ceaselessly seeks advancement. *Upward* denotes the heart’s aspiration; *downward*, its descent. Whether rising or falling, it is imprisoned and slain—self-ensnared and self-tormented. *Supple and graceful* describes beauty; the strong may be softened by it, as Xiang Yu wept before Lady Yu. *Sharp and incisive* refers to angularity; *carved and polished*, to refinement through grinding.",

Young men of early success retain some angularity, but once they encounter hardship and worldly affairs, all is worn smooth. Thus it is said: *sharp and incisive*, *carved and polished*—at times like scorching fire, at others like congealed ice. All describe the heart in moments of agitation, anger, sorrow, or fear. In a single breath, its movements surge and recede as though standing once more beyond the four seas—so swift is its haste.\n\n*Thus it hangs suspended*—this is to *press downward*, as if passing by in an instant. *Abyssal and still*—this speaks of the heart’s unmoving state. *Moving, it hangs suspended like Heaven*—this describes the moment a thought arises, as though strung from the sky. *Proud and untetherable*—*proud* here shares its sense with *fèn* (indignant fury), evoking a defiant, ungovernable bearing. *Untetherable* means beyond restraint. The Buddhist sutras ask: \"How to subdue the heart?\" Observe the word *subdue*—it reveals the meaning of *proud and untetherable*. This passage portrays the human heart with extraordinary subtlety; even Zhuangzi’s brush could hardly surpass it.\n\nOf old, the Yellow Emperor first used benevolence and righteousness to disrupt the human heart. Yao and Shun, in turn, wore the flesh from their thighs and the hair from their shins to nourish the bodies of the world, fretted over their five viscera to enact benevolence and righteousness, and strained their blood and qi to establish laws and standards—yet still they could not prevail. Yao then banished Huan Dou to Mount Chong, exiled the Three Miao to the Three Weirs, and cast Gong Gong into Youdu—this was his failure to master the world. By the time of the Three Kings, the world was thrown into great turmoil. Below arose Jie and Robber Zhi; above, Zeng and Shi; and the Confucians and Mohists all emerged.

      "translated_text": "The phrase \"股无胈\" signifies that the flesh of the thighs does not grow, while \"胫无毛\" speaks of wearing out one's legs. \"矜\" is pronounced *qin* and is the same as *qín*, meaning the shaft of a spear. The *Xiang Ji Zhuan* states, \"hoes and spears with thornwood shafts\"—this speaks of the rigidity of one's blood and qi. It is as if to say, one's inner vitality is exhausted. \"规\" means \"to create.\" This describes how, in their efforts to establish benevolence, righteousness, and legal standards, they labored to such an extent. Yet despite this toil, there remained matters they could not overcome, hence the punishments of exile and banishment—this is what is meant by \"not prevailing over the world.\" The \"four crimes\" brought the world into submission, which was originally an achievement of Shun, but Zhuangzi attributes it to Yao. Thus, though the wording may vary, the marvelous and strange are still evident. In the *Seeing the World* chapter, this is where the inconsistencies lie—it is as if the truth has been laid bare: even Yao and Shun were thus, and by the time it extended to the Three Kings, the terror only grew greater.\n\n\"施\" means \"to extend.\" Since the Three Kings were thus, below, the petty men followed the ways of Jie and Robber Zhi, while above, the gentlemen admired the reputations of Zeng and Shi, giving rise to the conflicts of the Confucians and Mohists. From this, each took joy in their own views and grew angry at others, each considered themselves wise and others foolish, each deemed themselves good and others evil, each believed themselves truthful and others deceitful. Both sides were the same, hence the mutual suspicion, deception, reproach, and mockery—this is the meaning of the *Equalizing Things* chapter: \"That too has its right and wrong, this too has its right and wrong.\" The term \"烂漫\" is well-chosen: the principles of nature and destiny became utterly disordered. \"求竭\" means that there was nothing left to respond with.\n\nThus, axes and saws were fashioned, inked marking lines and executions were employed, and mallets and chisels were wielded—the world fell into great chaos. The fault lay in disturbing the human heart. Therefore, the worthy retreated to dwell beneath the towering cliffs of great mountains, while the lords of ten thousand chariots trembled with fear in their ancestral halls. In this age, those condemned to death lie heaped upon one another, those in cangues and stocks jostle in crowds, and those subjected to punishment and execution are seen everywhere. Yet the Confucians and Mohists still stretch forth their arms and raise their fists amidst the fetters and shackles. Alas! How extreme is their shamelessness and lack of remorse!\n\nHow do I know that the wisdom of the sages does not become the cangues and stocks of the world? That benevolence and righteousness do not become the fetters and chisels? How do I know that Zeng and Shi are not the first arrows of Jie and Robber Zhi? Therefore, it is said: \"Abandon sageliness, discard wisdom, and the world will be greatly ordered.\"\n\nThis is a summary of the earlier point about not prevailing over the world, leading to the use of punishments. Axes, saws, inked marking lines, mallets, and chisels are all instruments of punishment. \"绳\" refers to binding restraints, while \"墨\" means tattooing or branding.",

      "translated_text": "The term \"脊脊\" suggests borrowing and dependence, while \"罪在撄人心\" refers to the crime of disturbing the human heart—this began with the Yellow Emperor. The worthy fled into hiding and did not emerge, yet their rulers exhausted themselves on behalf of the world, and those who suffered punishment were many. The state of affairs was as dire as this, yet the Confucians and Mohists still proudly elevated themselves amidst a world of sinners. Thus it is said: \"they stretch forth their arms and raise their fists amidst the fetters and shackles.\" \"离跂\" means to stand on tiptoe, \"攘臂\" means to wave one’s arms in animated speech—this describes their self-aggrandizement. Alas! How extreme is their conduct! The Confucians and Mohists in this context are truly shameless. The two instances of \"甚矣\" above and below differ in meaning, yet both are striking turns of phrase.\n\n\"桁杨\" refers to penal instruments, and \"相推\" describes how the condemned press against one another. The existence of \"桁杨椄槢\" stems from sagely wisdom, just as \"桎梏凿枘\" stems from benevolence and righteousness. The theories of Zeng and Shi provide cover for harm, making them the first arrows of Jie and Robber Zhi. \"椄槢\" refers to the crossbar in a cangue, or the wedge within. \"嚆矢\" is the whistling arrow of today.\n\nAfter the Yellow Emperor had ruled as Son of Heaven for nineteen years, his decrees spread throughout the world. Hearing that Guangchengzi dwelled on Mount Kongtong, he went to visit him, saying: \"I have heard that you have attained the utmost Dao. May I ask about the essence of the utmost Dao? I wish to draw upon the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains and nourish the people. I also wish to govern yin and yang to bring all living things to fruition. How may this be done?\"\n\nGuangchengzi replied: \"What you wish to inquire about is the substance of things, and what you wish to govern is the ruin of things. Ever since you began ordering the world, clouds have rained without gathering, trees have withered without yellowing, and the light of the sun and moon has grown ever more dim. As for the hearts of flatterers, ever shallow—how could they be worthy of discussing the utmost Dao? To draw upon the essence of Heaven and Earth to aid the five grains is to bring harmony and allow the myriad things to flourish. To govern yin and yang to bring all living things to fruition is to harmonize and regulate yin and yang to accord with the myriad things. Each should fulfill its proper office. When yin and yang do not conflict and each fulfills its office, this is called 'governing.' The inherent nature of things is called 'substance'—this is what was earlier referred to as the utmost Dao. What harms things is called 'ruin.' Heaven and Earth, yin and yang, are all principles of spontaneity. The five grains and the multitude of living things likewise grow and flourish of themselves. To impose the mind upon them in governance is instead to harm them.\"\n\n\"而\" here refers to the Yellow Emperor. \"族\" means to gather. Clouds raining without gathering means that here there is rain while there is none. Withering without yellowing means losing their season. \"荒\" refers to the sun and moon suffering eclipses, their light diminished and abandoned. \"翦翦\" means shallow.\n\nThe Yellow Emperor withdrew, relinquished the world, built a solitary chamber, spread white couch grass, and lived in seclusion for three months. He then went again to seek Guangchengzi. Guangchengzi lay with his head to the south. The Yellow Emperor approached from the lower side, crawling forward on his knees, bowing twice, knocking his head to the ground, and asked: \"I have heard that you have attained the utmost Dao. May I ask how to cultivate the body so that it may endure for long?\"\n\nGuangchengzi rose abruptly and said: \"Excellent question! Come, I will tell you of the utmost Dao. The essence of the utmost Dao is profound and distant; the ultimate of the utmost Dao is dark and silent. See nothing, hear nothing, know nothing—your spirit will guard your form, and your form will endure long. It is not called 'ordering the world' but 'cultivating the body,' and thus I consider it an excellent question. '窈窈冥冥' means distant and unfathomable; '昏昏默默' means obscure and invisible.

The spirit must be pure and still; the form must not be wearied, nor the qi disturbed—only then can one attain long life. All arts of cultivation and refinement originate from this. Whether immortals or buddhas, they have always existed since ancient times; this is not a teaching invented by Zhuangzi.\n\n\"Without toil, without disturbance\"—this \"without\" is akin to \"do not,\" conveying a prohibitive sense. \"Eyes seeing nothing, ears hearing nothing, the heart knowing nothing\" further explains \"seeing nothing, hearing nothing.\" \"Embracing the spirit in stillness\"—when the spirit guards the form, one may attain long life. This \"spirit\" is what modern practitioners of self-cultivation call the \"infant.\"\n\n\"Be cautious within, close yourself without.\" Excessive knowledge leads to ruin. I have led you to the source of great brightness, the origin of utmost yang. I have guided you into the gate of the profound and distant, the origin of utmost yin.

Thus, I have cultivated my body for one thousand two hundred years, yet my form has never declined.\n\n\"Be cautious within\"—do not let the heart be moved. \"Close yourself without\"—do not allow external things to disturb your heart. Any excess of knowledge becomes a burden. Only when one knows nothing does virtue remain whole; thus, it is said that excessive knowledge leads to ruin.\n\nThe beginning of utmost yang is great brightness; the beginning of utmost yin is the profound and distant. \"Origin\" means beginning. \"Above great brightness\" is above the great void; \"the gate of the profound and distant\" is the inception of the boundless. The *Yijing* speaks of \"the Dao of one yin and one yang\"—this is the same principle.

      "translated_text": "Entering the ultimate—this means desiring to teach you to reach this extremity. The offices and repositories are the organs and viscera. This speaks of how the human body itself possesses heaven and earth, yin and yang. When my heaven and earth each fulfill their offices, when my yin and yang each reside in their proper places, then this body may be guarded with care, and all things will naturally become firm. \"Things\" refers to all that belongs to this body. Thus it is said, \"Things will naturally strengthen themselves.\" What is guarded is the One, without admixture; what is dwelled in is nothing that is not harmonious and compliant. This is why, though my form has endured for one thousand two hundred years, it has never declined.\n\n\"To dwell\" means to engage with affairs and things, to respond when stimulated. Heaven and earth are the vigor and compliance of this body. The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touching his forehead to the ground, and said, \"What you speak of, Master Vast Accomplishment, is truly heaven!\" Master Vast Accomplishment said, \"Come, let me tell you: those things are without end, yet people all take them to be finite; those things are unfathomable, yet people all take them to be limited. Those who attain my Dao become emperors above and kings below; those who lose my Dao appear as light above and become earth below. Now, the hundred flourishing things all arise from earth and return to earth. Thus, I shall leave you and enter the gate of the boundless, to wander in the wilds of the infinite. I share the radiance of the sun and moon, I am constant with heaven and earth. When I coil myself, I am distant; when I obscure myself, I vanish from men. Will they all perish while I alone endure?\"\n\n\"Master Vast Accomplishment’s words are heaven\" means that he may unite with heaven as one. How could things have an end when people insist on seeking their termination? How could things be fathomed when people insist on seeking their limits? Thus, the bounded follows the boundless. These two lines are profoundly meaningful. Spoken crudely, it is like forging iron to make a threshold—when struck, it elicits laughter, yet this is the same idea. The *Yijing* does not end with *Jiji* (Completion) but with *Weiji* (Incompletion), for it knows that things are without end and without measure. When Confucius stood by the river and said, \"What passes is like this,\" he too pointed to their boundlessness and unfathomability.\n\nAbove, one may become an emperor; below, one may become a king. These terms \"emperor\" and \"king\" refer to the perfection of inner sageliness and outer kingship, as in the chapter \"Under Heaven.\" The emperor embodies non-action; the king embodies action. This is not the Three Sovereigns or the kings of the Three Dynasties. \"Appearing as light above\" refers to the sun and moon; \"becoming earth below\" refers to the ground.",

This is the error of governing men.\"\n\nThe branch of the *Fuyao* tree is the *Fusang*, the place where the sun rises. *Fǔ bì jué yuè* describes his joyful leaping. *Tǎngrán* depicts his sudden loss of composure; *pīrán* depicts his towering stillness. *Sǒu* refers to Hong Hu.\n\nWhen Zhaozhou met Touzi returning from buying oil, he said: \"I have long heard of Touzi—today I see only an oil-buying old man.\" Touzi replied: \"Oil, oil—just look.\" In Chan, this matter is thus revealed. Cloud General said \"wander\" (*yóu*), which is Zhuangzi’s way of describing animation. The character for \"oil\" (*yóu*) differs from \"wander\" (*yóu*), and is not to be taken as the same. Without pause, he replied: \"I wander.\" Looking up, he said: \"Hmm?\" The question of nurturing the multitude of beings is the same as the question the Yellow Emperor once posed. *Diào tóu* means to shake one’s head. \"Has Heaven forgotten me?\"—*zhèn* means \"I.\" He calls Hong Hu \"Heaven,\" saying: \"We met once before—do you still remember? How could you have forgotten?\" *Fúyóu* means to roam about; *chāngkuáng* means unrestrained and unbridled. \"Without knowing what I seek\" means having no aim.",

Roaming amid a world overwhelmed and confused, one yet observes one’s own authenticity—this is unavoidable in speaking to the people. One wishes to refuse and sever such speech, yet cannot. *Fàng xiào* means to imitate. The people take me as their model. The constant principles of Heaven and the true nature of things are all simply spontaneous. Now, if one acts with intention, this is to disrupt and invert their spontaneity. How can one achieve the transformation of spontaneity? Thus it is said: ‘The mysterious Heaven does not complete’—*xū* means emptiness, akin to ‘prior to Heaven.’ When beasts gather in herds without contention, there is no distinction of ‘you’ and ‘me,’ no division of ‘same’ and ‘different.’ Now, if each departs from its herd, this is to create ‘you and me,’ ‘same and different.’ When birds all cry out at night, it is alarm. If one cannot assist things in preserving their spontaneity, causing them to lose their nature, then grasses, trees, and insects all suffer harm.

      "translated_text": "The phrase \"Alas, bitter! Alas, bitter!\" is indeed what the stone-head master meant. \"Swiftly departing\" describes how you, having already poisoned and tormented yourself, should hasten away without further inquiry. This fabricated dialogue resembles the exchanges in the *Lamp Records*. \"Nurturing the heart-mind\" means that when you cease to nourish this heart-mind, it is already nurtured—it is not called \"nurturing the heart-mind\" but \"heart-mind nurturing,\" and one must discern this carefully. \"Merely\" means you should simply abide in non-action, and things will transform of themselves. \"Transform\" implies the ceaseless coming and going, the self-arising and self-transforming of things. Discard all your former cleverness and leave none of it behind. \"Align and merge\" means to sink and dissolve, forgetting both self and things, thus merging with the great sameness of the primordial vastness. \"Primordial vastness\" is formless and traceless, the state before qi arose. \"Dissolve the heart-mind\" means to dissolve the heart-mind that possesses a heart-mind. \"Release the spirit\" means to release the spirit that possesses knowledge. \"Utterly still\" means to settle. \"Without soul\" means without knowledge. Essence is called *po*; spirit is called *hun*. \"Without soul\" echoes the earlier phrase \"lump-like, standing by its form alone.\" The heart-mind in \"dissolving the heart-mind\" differs from that in \"nurturing the heart-mind,\" just as the spirit in \"releasing the spirit\" differs from that in \"embracing the spirit to attain stillness.\" These terms require careful reflection.\n\n\"Teeming and swarming\" describes their multitude. Each returns to its root, for what is born must perish. Though it perishes, it does not truly perish, for what perishes is reborn. Thus, each returns to its root yet does not know it—profoundly muddled, without knowledge or awareness, this is the state of *hundun*. In *hundun*, one passes one’s life without departing from the Dao. But if one possesses knowledge and awareness, one becomes divided from the Dao. Thus, \"if they knew it, this would already be departure.\" This line is most precise and demands close attention. \"Name\" refers to all distinctions; \"nature\" refers to likes and dislikes. \"Pry\" means to perceive. Without inquiry or perception, there are no distinctions, no likes or dislikes—this is non-action and spontaneity. If I can embody non-action and spontaneity, then each thing follows its own nature, for this is its inherent condition. Thus, \"things arise of themselves.\" \"Inherent\" means naturally so.\n\n\"Bestowed\" means granted to me. \"Silence\" means non-speech. Heaven granted me the virtue of spontaneity and revealed to me the principle of non-speech. Seeking it within myself, I have now attained it—this is personal realization. \"Within myself\" means that by seeking within my own person, I have obtained what I sought. Thereupon, he bowed, expressed his gratitude, and departed.\n\nOrdinary people delight in those who agree with them and resent those who differ. They desire agreement and reject difference, for their hearts are set on standing out from the crowd. Yet how can one who sets his heart on standing out ever truly stand out? Relying on the crowd for comfort, his knowledge does not surpass theirs. Yet he desires to govern a state—this is grasping at the benefits of the Three Kings while blind to the perils. To govern a state with such intentions is to rely on luck. How often can one rely on luck without losing the state? The odds of preserving it are less than one in ten thousand, while the odds of losing it are more than ten thousand to one. How lamentable that those who possess lands do not understand this!\n\nFrom this point to the end of the chapter, Zhuangzi expounds further: desiring others to agree with oneself and resenting their differences is to place oneself above the multitude. Insisting that others conform to one’s own views before feeling at ease, how is one different from the crowd? Though one may wish to stand out, how can one do so? If one claims unique insight, it must be that no one else understands—yet if one desires everyone to agree, then one’s skills are no greater than the multitude’s. Laozi said, \"If those who know me are few, then I am noble.\" Zhuangzi here echoes this sentiment, much like Han Tuizhi’s discussion of literature, which also reflects this idea. With such a mindset, one seeks to govern a state, grasping at the benefits of the Three Kings while blind to the inevitable harm. To govern a state with such intentions is to rely on luck. With luck as one’s aim, one sees only ruin and no success. How can those who possess lands fail to recognize the deception of such men?\n\nThose who possess lands possess great things. Those who possess great things cannot be possessed by things, yet they can master things. Only by mastering things can one perceive the error of those who are mastered by things. How could this apply merely to governing the world and its people? They move in and out of the six directions, roam the nine provinces, coming and going alone—this is called \"possessing singularity.\" Those who possess singularity are called \"the most noble.\"\n\nThose who are mastered by things have intentions and traces; those who are not mastered by things act without acting, spontaneously and naturally. Without acting, there is nothing they do not do. Thus, \"not mastered by things, they can master things.\" If one knows the thing that masters things, how could this apply merely to governing the world? Thus, \"they move in and out of the six directions, roam the nine provinces.\" This speaks of the Dao transcending the myriad things. They move freely within creation, merging with Heaven as one—no one can divide them. Thus, \"coming and going alone is called possessing singularity.\" Such is the most noble.\n\nThe teachings of the great person are like the shadow following the form, the echo responding to the sound. When questioned, they respond fully, expressing all they hold within, matching the world as its counterpart. They dwell where there is no echo, move where there is no path. They lead you to return to the restless realm, wandering without beginning or end, entering and exiting without boundary, sharing no origin with the sun. They chant and discourse on the body, merging with the great sameness. In the great sameness, there is no self—how could there be possession? Those who perceive possession are the gentlemen of old; those who perceive non-possession are friends of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThe great person is the perfected person, the one who possesses singularity. Form must have shadow; sound must have echo—this is spontaneity. When questioned, they respond fully, expressing all they hold within. This is to face the world alone, bearing its vastness with one’s person. I am the host; the counterpart is the guest. Without echo, without sound, without scent, without trace. \"Restless\" describes ceaseless activity. \"To return\" is to go. \"Lead\" means to guide. \"You\" refers to all in the world. \"Return\" means to go back. They guide all in the world to return to the restless realm, meaning that though they transcend the world, they do not depart from it—transcendence and worldliness are not two separate dharmas. \"Without beginning\" means without origin.",

      "translated_text": "The boundless extends in all four directions—no limits in any quarter. Moving in and out, roaming freely within, day after day, one sees no end, nor can one know the beginning. Thus it is said: \"With the sun, without beginning.\" To speak of the physical form is to praise it—harmonizing within Heaven and Earth, all share this same body. Thus it is said: \"Harmonizing,\" a great ode of praise. Since my body is one with the myriad things, it cannot be selfish—this is the absence of self. Having no self, what then is \"having\"? It is just as Pang the Layman said: \"Empty all that is present; do not substantiate what is absent.\"\n\nThe ancients, the noble ones, saw only the \"having\" and became friends with Heaven and Earth. Yet only when they saw the \"without\" did they truly see. When they spoke of \"the ancients, the noble ones,\" from Yao and Shun downward, all were included. That which is base yet cannot be shunned is *things*. That which is lowly yet cannot be forsaken is *the people*. That which is hidden yet cannot be avoided is *affairs*. That which is coarse yet cannot be discarded is *laws*. That which is distant yet cannot be abandoned is *righteousness*. That which is intimate yet cannot be narrowed is *benevolence*. That which is regulated yet cannot be neglected is *ritual*. That which is centered yet cannot be lowered is *virtue*. That which is unified yet cannot be fixed is the *Dao*. That which is numinous yet cannot be left undone is *Heaven*.\n\nObserving this passage, one sees that Master Zhuang still engages with worldly affairs—he does not merely discourse on emptiness and nothingness. Cheng Yi’s remark that the Buddhists have *shangda* (ascending understanding) but lack *xiaxue* (descending learning) is most apt. Yet even in these few lines, there are points akin to *xiaxue*, and an intent that the refined and the coarse are inseparable. If the Dao is esteemed, then things are deemed base—yet how can one abandon things? Thus it is said: \"That which is base yet cannot be shunned is *things*\"—*ren* (任) means to employ. If the Dao is exalted, then what resides in people is lowly—yet how can one stand apart from people? Thus it is said: \"That which is lowly yet cannot be forsaken is *the people*\"—*yin* (因) means to rely upon. *Ni* (匿) means concealment, obscurity. The Dao is clarity, but when contrasted with affairs, affairs become obscure—yet how can one entirely forsake worldly affairs? Thus it is said: \"That which is hidden yet cannot be avoided is *affairs*.\" The Dao is the refined; laws are the coarse—yet how can laws be entirely discarded? Thus it is said: \"That which is coarse yet cannot be discarded is *laws*.\" Righteousness is distant from the Dao—yet how can righteousness be abandoned? Thus it is said: \"That which is distant yet cannot be abandoned is *righteousness*.\" The Dao is without partiality, while benevolence entails affection. Though not the ultimate Dao, how can benevolence be forsaken? It must be extended broadly. Thus it is said: \"That which is intimate yet cannot be narrowed is *benevolence*.\" Ritual involves regulation and ornamentation, seeming forced—yet it cannot be neglected. Thus it is said: \"That which is regulated yet cannot be neglected is *ritual*.\" The rituals number three hundred, the deportments three thousand—how could these be accomplished by one person in a single day? Thus it is said: \"Accumulate\"—virtue is what all people share. Though one may harmonize with the world, there are places where one must stand apart—how can one be the same as others? Thus it is said: \"That which is centered yet cannot be lowered is *virtue*\"—*zhong* (中) means harmony. That which is unified in spontaneity is the Dao—yet there are times when change is necessary. How can one cling to oneness without transformation? Thus it is said: \"That which is unified yet cannot be fixed is the *Dao*.\" The numinous is that which cannot be known—Heaven’s works are all unknowable. Yet human affairs cannot be left undone—how can one entirely entrust them to the unknowable? Thus it is said: \"That which is numinous yet cannot be left undone is *Heaven*.\"\n\nTherefore, the sage observes Heaven yet does not assist its completion; embodies virtue yet is not burdened; emerges from the Dao yet does not scheme; guards benevolence yet does not rely upon it; values righteousness yet does not accumulate it; responds to ritual yet does not conceal; engages with affairs yet does not yield; aligns with laws yet is not disordered; depends upon the people yet does not slight them; relies upon things yet does not abandon them. Things are not worth doing—yet they cannot be left undone.\n\nNot assisting means not forcing effort. What lies in people cannot be left undone, yet when viewed through the eye of the Dao, though one acts, no effort is forced. Thus it is said: \"Observes Heaven yet does not assist\"—this *zhu* (助) is the same as in \"assisting growth.\" Not being burdened means not piling up to achieve height. To pile up in order to be high is to harbor intention, which is not spontaneous—*lei* (累) is pronounced like *lei* (垒). Not scheming means having no calculating mind. Not relying means not considering it a personal favor. *Hui* (会) means gathering; *ji* (积) means accumulation that does not transform. Without accumulation, there is transformation. *Bo* (薄) means pressing, near. Though one’s conduct may be near to righteousness, one does not consider it one’s own—if one gathers righteousness, it does not transform. Not concealing means not being constrained by taboos. *Ying* (应) means responding. Bound by ritual forms, one has things to conceal and avoid. What can be done is done, responding to affairs as they arise. Thus it is said: \"Responds to ritual yet does not conceal.\" *Rang* (让) means yielding, retreating. In engaging with affairs, one acts directly without retreating. Thus it is said: \"Engages with affairs yet does not yield.\" Using laws to align things, though amidst complexity, there is a sense of simplicity and directness. Thus it is said: \"Aligns with laws yet is not disordered.\" Though the people may be relied upon, one does not slight them. Though things may be employed, one does not abandon the root to pursue the branches.\n\nFrom the above lines, all has been exhausted—yet once more, the word *thing* is raised: \"Things are not worth doing, yet they cannot be left undone.\" This *thing* encompasses both the refined—where the Dao resides—and the coarse—where things reside. All affairs and all things are included within. If viewed through the mind of the Dao, none are worth doing—yet there are things that cannot be left undone, which is where the human mind resides. Observing this line, how could Master Zhuang not understand the principle that the refined and the coarse are one?\n\nIt is further said: \"One who does not understand Heaven is not pure in virtue.\" Though worldly affairs cannot be left undone, one must know the principle of spontaneity—otherwise, the virtue within oneself is not unified. \"Not penetrating the Dao\" is the same as not understanding Heaven. \"Having no path that is not obstructed\" means there is no way forward without hindrance. The earlier statement, \"not understanding Heaven, not penetrating the Dao,\" culminates here in \"not understanding the Dao\"—thus it is clear that \"not understanding Heaven\" and \"not penetrating the Dao\" are but a single idea.\n\nWhat is the Dao? There is the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humans. The Dao of Heaven is honored through non-action; the Dao of humans is burdened by action. The ruler follows the Dao of Heaven; the minister follows the Dao of humans. The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humans are far apart—this cannot go unexamined.",

      "translated_text": "This dual path is most wondrous and most intimately bound to learning, yet readers often overlook it without deep inquiry. \"Honored through non-action\" is the spontaneity of Heaven’s Dao; \"burdened by action\" is the inescapable necessity of the human Dao. The former pertains to the mind of Dao; the latter, to the human mind. This single word \"burden\" nearly approaches the meaning of \"peril.\" The ruler, following Heaven’s Dao, takes the mind of Dao as master; the minister, following the human Dao, makes the human mind obey. These terms \"ruler\" and \"minister\" do not refer to courtly ranks—readers who take them as such have long been mistaken. They denote the sovereign and subject within the self. *The Equality of Things* says, \"Do they not take turns as ruler and minister?\" There is a true sovereign abiding within—this is how it should be understood.\n\nThe writings of Zhuangzi generally esteem non-action and disdain action. Having already explained that \"matters requiring action cannot be left undone,\" he now fears readers might conflate action and non-action, and so reiterates: \"The Dao of Heaven and the Dao of humans are far apart—this cannot go unexamined.\" The text’s opening and closing, its restraint and amplification, its forward and backward echoes—if one grasps this, it becomes lively and fluid. Yet its language is tangled, its rhythms shifting, its transformations elusive, so that not all can fully comprehend it. Moreover, passages like \"what is distant yet cannot be abandoned\" (righteousness) and \"what is close yet cannot be left unexpanded\" (benevolence) do not align with the sagely canon, thus veering toward heterodoxy. One must not read it as one would the *Analects* or *Mencius*.\n\nFrom \"what is base yet cannot be shirked\" through to \"this cannot go unexamined,\" this is the great guiding principle of Zhuangzi’s thought, akin to the *Under Heaven* chapter. Su Dongpo believed Zhuangzi never criticized Confucius, and in *Under Heaven* he was correct. Here, however, one sees that Zhuangzi never failed to recognize the principle of unity between the refined and the coarse, the root and the branch. There is another perspective: the words of sages and worthies endure for all ages without flaw, yet among the Hundred Schools, some passages strike with piercing clarity. Consider the *Book of Changes*: \"That which is above form is called the Dao; that which is within form is called the vessel.\" \"To transform and regulate it is called change; to extend and enact it is called penetration; to raise and apply it to the people of the world is called enterprise.\" Again: \"When it is seen, it is called an image; when it takes form, it is called a vessel; when it is fashioned and employed, it is called a method; when its utility enters and exits, and the people all use it, it is called the numinous.\" Where does it not speak of the refined? Where does it not speak of the coarse? Expressed with such seamless integrity, it remains flawless.\n\nLe Yuexuan said: \"When Confucians awaken to the Dao, their minds grow ever more refined; when Chan Buddhists awaken to the Dao, their minds grow ever coarser.\" This insight penetrates to the marrow of Confucianism and Buddhism, surpassing all that came before. In this passage, Zhuangzi calls the myriad worldly affairs \"lowly\" and \"coarse,\" yet intersperses them with \"cannot but\"—such maneuvers are even coarser, leaving no trace of the spirit of \"only the refined, only the unified, holding fast to the center.\" Only by distinguishing these coarse and refined states can one perceive Le Yuexuan’s awakening to the Dao as the work of one with great vision. Others who refute Buddhism grasp only its surface; he, having named it a \"transcendent dharma\" and condemned its doctrines of severing human relations and abandoning ethical bonds, how could they ever convince him?\n\n**Chapter Twelve: Heaven and Earth (Outer Chapters)**\n\nThough Heaven and Earth are vast, their transformations are uniform; though the myriad things are numerous, their governance is one; though the masses of people are many, their sovereign is the lord. The lord originates in virtue and is completed by Heaven. Thus it is said: \"The ancient rulers of the world practiced non-action—this was simply the virtue of Heaven.\" That their transformations are uniform means all are of primordial qi. That their governance is one: though the myriad things are many, what governs them is singular—creation alone. Though the masses of people are many, their sovereign is the lord, just as Heaven has no second sun, nor the people a second king.\n\nWhat Heaven bestows upon me is virtue; if I can trace the origin of this virtue, it is all completed by Heaven, and human effort adds nothing. If one who would be a lord can understand this, then non-action and following spontaneity are achieved. Non-action and spontaneity are the virtue of Heaven—profound and distant. \"Profound antiquity\" means remote antiquity.\n\nViewed through the Dao, the lords of the world are rectified; viewed through the Dao, the duties of ruler and minister become clear; viewed through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-ordered; viewed through the Dao in its fullness, the responses of the myriad things are complete. Thus, that which flows through Heaven and Earth is virtue; that which moves among the myriad things is the Dao. To govern people is a matter of affairs; to possess a skill is a matter of technique. Technique is encompassed by affairs; affairs are encompassed by righteousness; righteousness is encompassed by virtue; virtue is encompassed by the Dao; the Dao is encompassed by Heaven.\n\nBetween Heaven and Earth, where there is qi, there is sound; where there is sound, there is name. When a name is designated as \"lord,\" the divisions of the world are settled. From the very beginning of Heaven and Earth, as soon as sound arose, this was naturally determined—hence it is said: \"Viewed through the Dao, the lords of the world are settled.\" The Dao is spontaneity. Once this division exists, the duties of ruler and minister naturally follow, establishing the hierarchy of high and low, noble and base.\n\nThus it is said: \"Viewed through the Dao, the duties of ruler and minister become clear.\" The affairs of the world cannot be managed by one person alone; many are employed according to their abilities, fulfilling their offices. What enables them is also bestowed by Heaven, for Heaven produces many people to accomplish many affairs. Hence it is said: \"Viewed through the Dao, the offices of the world are well-ordered.\"\n\nAmong the myriad things, nothing exists without its counterpart: where there is cold, there is heat; where there is female, there is male; where there is above, there is below; where there is front, there is back; where there is left, there is right. Each responds to the other, all arising spontaneously. Thus it is said: \"Viewed through the Dao in its fullness, the responses of the myriad things are complete.\" These four phrases are most wondrous, their language pure and unadulterated. Heaven can cover and give life; Earth can bear and complete—together they share this virtue. \"Flow through\" means to be one with. Among the myriad things, each has its own spontaneous principle, which operates within...",

      "translated_text": "Within this, it is thus said: \"That which courses through the myriad things is the Dao.\"\n\nWhat the ruler employs to govern—such as ritual, music, punishment, and administration—are all affairs of governance. Within each affair lies its own art and vocation, each following the capacities of the individual: these are human skills. The refined is the essence of virtue and power; the coarse is the realm of affairs and skills. Yet whether refined or coarse, all emerge from spontaneity. Thus, skill is but affair, affair is but art, art is but virtue, virtue is but the Dao, and the Dao is but Heaven. \"To encompass\" means to unite two as one. The term *he* (合, \"to unite\") was mistakenly transcribed as *yin* (因, \"cause\") due to their shared pronunciation.\n\nHence it is said: \"Those who nurtured the world in ancient times desired nothing, and the world was sufficient; they acted not, and the myriad things transformed; they were profound and still, and the hundred clans were settled.\" The Record states: \"Permeated by the One, all affairs are complete; without intent, one attains and even spirits submit.\" To nurture the world is what Mencius called \"nourishing the world with goodness.\" If I desire nothing, the world naturally suffices; if I act not, the world naturally transforms; if I am still, the people naturally settle. *Yuánjìng* (渊静) means profound stillness. All affairs are but one principle, thus it is said: \"Permeated by the One, all affairs are complete.\" As for what is attained within me: if one can be without intent, not only will people submit, but even spirits will yield. The term *jì yuē* (记曰, \"the Record states\") signifies an ancient transmission. These words were handed down from high antiquity, and Zhuangzi cited them as his own proof. These five phrases are most pure; the first three closely resemble those of Laozi.\n\nThe Master said: \"The Dao is that which covers and bears the myriad things—vast and boundless, how great it is! The noble person cannot but hollow out the heart.\" To act through non-action is called Heaven; to speak through non-speaking is called virtue; to love others and benefit things is called benevolence; to harmonize differences is called greatness; to embrace diversity without boundary is called magnanimity; to possess the myriad differences is called abundance. Thus, to grasp virtue is called discipline; to perfect virtue is called establishment; to follow the Dao is called completion; to remain unshaken by external things is called wholeness. When the noble person comprehends these ten, their mind encompasses all affairs, vast and inexhaustible, flowing forth to embrace the myriad things.\n\nThe Master spoke of his teacher: *Kū xīn* (刳心) means to excise the heart of discriminating awareness. Only by removing this heart of knowledge can one enter the Dao and merge with spontaneity. To act in accordance with spontaneity is called Heaven; what is attained within oneself is self-evident, thus it is said: \"To speak through non-speaking is called virtue.\" *Wúwéi yán* (无为言) means speech that requires no utterance. Differences are also sameness, thus it is said: \"To harmonize differences is called greatness.\" *Yá yì* (崖异) refers to the traces of distinction. *Kuān* (宽) means expansive. Though things differ, I encompass them all, thus it is said: \"To possess the myriad differences is called abundance\"—that is, all things are complete within me. *Jì* (纪) means order: the virtue one grasps, whether great or small, follows its own sequence, hence it is said: \"To grasp virtue is called discipline.\" *Zhuó hū* (卓乎) signifies standing firm, as in the perfection of virtue. To follow the Dao in action is to lack nothing, thus it is called completion. *Bèi* (备) means the fullness of the Dao. *Wán* (完) means wholeness: when external things cannot disturb the mind, what is within remains intact. Thus it is said: \"To remain unshaken by external things is called wholeness.\" The ten are Heaven, virtue, benevolence, greatness, magnanimity, abundance, discipline, establishment, completion, and wholeness.\n\n*Tāo* (韬) means to conceal: to embrace all affairs without omission, all returning to the mind—this mind is vast beyond measure. Thus it is said: \"Their mind encompasses all affairs, vast and boundless.\" *Shì* (逝) means to flow: it flows like this, ever onward.",

      "translated_text": "The myriad things come and go without end, yet I join with them in boundless continuity—thus it is said: \"Abundant is their engagement with the myriad things as they flow.\" Such a one conceals gold in the mountains and pearls in the abyss, finds no profit in wealth, draws no nearness to nobility or riches, takes no joy in long life nor sorrow in early death, feels no glory in success nor shame in adversity. They do not confine the world’s benefits as private gain, nor do they regard ruling all under Heaven as a personal elevation. To be elevated is to be illuminated—all things are a single treasury, and death and life share the same form.\n\nConcealing gold in the mountains and pearls in the abyss is to store wealth within all under Heaven. \"Not drawing near\" means keeping far away. They do not let longevity or early death dictate joy or sorrow, nor do they allow success or failure to determine honor or disgrace. The character *chǒu* (丑) here conveys a sense of inferiority, surpassing the notion of disgrace. The benefits of an age are shared by all—no one clings to them as personal possession, reflecting the idea that when one loses a bow, another finds it. Though they may rule all under Heaven, they do not consider themselves exalted; the yellow imperial carriage is not the intent of Yao’s heart. The clarity within their breast illuminates Heaven and Earth—this is true elevation, thus they do not regard ruling all under Heaven as exaltation. Gathering the myriad things into one principle, they call it a single treasury. Death and life are vast indeed, yet nothing alters their constancy—viewing them as one, thus it is said: \"They share the same form.\"\n\nThe Master said: \"The Dao dwells in the profound, its abode still; its clarity flows pure. Without it, metal and stone cannot sound—thus metal and stone have voices, yet without striking, they do not ring. Who can determine the myriad things?\" Profound is its dwelling—stillness, the state of rest, of stability. Pure is its clarity—unmixed, unadulterated. The resonance of metal and stone is the natural work of Heaven, thus it is said: \"Without it, metal and stone cannot sound.\" To sound is to be the Dao. Yet though metal and stone have voices, without human striking, they do not ring—human striking is also the mechanism of Heaven. These two lines express a parallel principle, much like the earlier saying: \"How do we know what I call Heaven is not human, or what I call human is not Heaven?\" Thus it is said: \"Who can determine the myriad things?\" Heaven is not complete without humanity, just as humanity is not complete without Heaven—this is the same idea, though in this text it is expressed with striking originality.\n\nOne of royal virtue moves with unadorned simplicity and feels shame in being entangled by affairs. They establish the root and origin, their knowledge penetrating the divine. Thus their virtue is vast, and from their heart’s emergence, things respond. Without the Dao, form does not arise; without virtue, life is not illuminated. To preserve form, exhaust life, establish virtue, and illuminate the Dao—this is not the work of one without royal virtue. Vast and boundless, they suddenly emerge, suddenly move, and the myriad things follow—this is the one of royal virtue.\n\n\"Royal virtue\" refers to one possessing the virtue to rule all under Heaven. \"Unadorned simplicity\" means proceeding with plainness, like the saying \"to tread with simplicity.\" They act without fail yet do not claim credit, thus it is said: \"They feel shame in being entangled by affairs.\" The root is the origin of the myriad things. \"Knowledge penetrating the divine\" means sincerity like the divine. \"Response\" means things turn to them, and only then does their heart engage—thus it is said: \"From their heart’s emergence, things respond.\" *Cǎi* (采) means to be moved; *chū* (出) means to answer. All things are born of creation—all that has form shares this Dao. Yet without self-realization, this Dao remains unilluminated, meaning it is not understood. The character *shēng* (生) in the following line refers to receiving the center of Heaven and Earth to live. Preserving one’s form to exhaust the principle of life’s origin, establishing one’s virtue to illuminate the Dao’s naturalness—this is beyond the capacity of any but the sage. \"Vast and boundless\"—this speaks of their greatness.",

      "translated_text": "Suddenly, it emerges—this is the emergence of all things. With a sudden surge, it moves, compelled to rise by necessity. All things follow it—this is the sage acting and the myriad things beholding. Gazing into the boundless, listening to the soundless: within the boundless, one alone perceives clarity; within the soundless, one alone hears harmony. Thus, delving ever deeper, one can grasp things; refining ever more subtly, one can attain essence. Therefore, in engaging with the myriad things, one reaches utmost emptiness to fulfill their needs, roaming freely to meet their abiding nature—whether great or small, long or short, near or far.\n\nThe boundless is the realm of formlessness. To see within the formless and perceive clarity is to witness the elusive and indistinct, wherein images reside. While others deem it soundless, what I alone hear is like the harmony of the eight timbres. This is not seeing *that* but seeing *oneself*; not hearing *that* but hearing *oneself*. Delving ever deeper, entering the profound and wondrous, one can yet respond to things—able to grasp both the refined and the coarse. The spirit is formless; essence is qi. To perceive the formless is to grasp the interplay of qi above and form below. What abides within me is emptiness, yet it responds to things. Without compulsion, it attains utmost emptiness to fulfill the myriad things’ needs, emerging and roaming freely in due time, seizing their ultimate abode. One cannot speak of it as fixed—whether small or great, long or short, near or far—this is the meaning of timeliness. \"Far-reaching\" complements \"near\"; its intent is thus complete. Here, \"far-reaching\" (修远) means \"long\" (长), clearly encompassing the near as well. Otherwise, the brush would have slipped, losing restraint. Yet these scattered passages are exquisitely precise—how could others wield such a brush?\n\nThe Yellow Emperor roamed north of the Red Water, ascended the Kunlun peaks, and gazed southward. Upon returning, he lost his dark pearl. He sent Knowledge to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Li Zhu to seek it, but it was not found; he sent Chi Gou to seek it, but it was not found. Only Xiangwang obtained it. The Yellow Emperor exclaimed, \"How extraordinary! Could Xiangwang alone have found it?\"\n\nThis passage speaks of seeking the Dao: it does not lie in cleverness, nor in eloquence—just as the Buddhist sutras say, \"To seek the Great Perfect Enlightenment with a mind of thought is like burning Mount Sumeru with a firefly’s glow.\" Yet it unfolds a discourse so profound. The dark pearl is the Dao; Knowledge is awareness; Li Zhu is clarity; Chi Gou is eloquence; Xiangwang is non-mind. Neither awareness, clarity, nor eloquence can attain the Dao—only non-mind can. Such metaphors are singularly marvelous.\n\nYao’s teacher was Xu You; Xu You’s teacher was Nie Que; Nie Que’s teacher was Wang Ni; Wang Ni’s teacher was Pi Yi. Yao asked Xu You, \"Could Nie Que be fit to match Heaven? I would rely on Wang Ni to assess him.\" Xu You replied, \"How perilous! How precarious is the world! Nie Que’s nature is keen, wise, and quick—surpassing others. Yet he takes what he receives from man as Heaven. He scrutinizes prohibitions and transgressions but does not know the source of transgressions. Could he match Heaven? He rides upon man yet lacks Heaven; he takes his body as fundamental yet differs in form; he exalts knowledge yet races like fire; he becomes entangled in affairs; he becomes ensnared by things; he looks in all directions, and things respond; he adapts to the needs of the multitude yet lacks constancy. How could he match Heaven? Though he has clan and ancestors, he may be a father to the multitude but cannot be the father of fathers—the leader of order and chaos. He would bring the calamity of facing north and the treachery of facing south.\"\n\nPassage by passage, it grows ever more extraordinary. Could one say the Outer Chapters are coarser than the Inner? \"Matching Heaven\" is like the saying in the *Book of Documents*, \"The rites of Yin ascend to match Heaven.\"",

Preserving one’s form to exhaust the principle of life’s origin, establishing one’s virtue to illuminate the Dao’s naturalness—this is beyond the capacity of any but the sage. \"Vast and boundless\"—this speaks of their greatness.",

      "translated_text": "To speak of ruling all under Heaven is to seek its attainment through precarious means. \"Precarious\" and \"perilous\" both signify danger. \"Keenness of perception, clarity of insight, and innate wisdom\" describe one’s nature; \"quick-wittedness,\" \"urgency,\" and \"keen observation and swift response\" describe one’s actions. In responding to affairs, it is by virtue of this innate quickness that one reacts with such agility—this is where one surpasses others. Cultivating human affairs to align with the principles of Heaven is called \"taking the human to accord with the Heavenly.\" To be discerning is to restrain transgressions, yet this remains a matter of holding the mind without transformation. If one understands the origins of transgression, there is no need for restraint.\n\n\"Riding upon man yet lacking Heaven\" speaks of exhausting one’s active efforts while ignorant of non-action. \"Riding\" means to act; to act upon human affairs is called \"riding upon man.\" The self is set against things, hence \"taking the body as fundamental yet differing in form.\" \"Racing like fire\" describes haste; to exalt and hasten the use of one’s knowledge is called \"exalting knowledge yet racing like fire.\" \"Entangled in affairs\" means being enslaved by trivial matters while forgetting the root, hence \"ensnared by the threads of affairs\"—this conveys the sense of fragmentation. \"Ensnared by things\" means being constrained by affairs and objects. Things come from all directions, and one looks about to respond, hence \"looking in all directions, and things respond.\" Each response is measured to its circumstance, hence \"adapting to the needs of the multitude.\" Yet to be submerged by things and lose one’s natural constancy is not true constancy in response, hence \"adapting to things yet lacking constancy.\" \"Adapting\" means being transformed by affairs and objects; \"constancy\" is unity, and \"lacking constancy\" means having no stability.",

      "translated_text": "A single \"that\" yet sevenfold in aspect, spanning from antiquity to the present—how could such literary skill arise? Though turning once more, it speaks of one who, while not yet matching Heaven, still possesses a venerable quality. When a clan gathers, it reveres its ancestors, hence \"there is a clan, there is an ancestor.\" These four idle words, too, are strangely apt.\n\nThe \"father of the multitude\" emerges from the common people yet may serve as their father—meaning he stands above his generation. The father of the multitude’s father stands yet higher, and the father of the multitude’s father is Heaven, which is natural. He leads and commands.\n\nThis person’s role in the world may bring order or chaos: facing north, he is a minister; facing south, a ruler. To employ him as a minister or as a ruler both entail perils, hence \"the calamity of facing north\" and \"the harm of facing south.\"\n\nYao observed Hua, and the border guard of Hua said, \"Ah! Sage! I offer a blessing to the sage: may the sage live long.\" Yao declined. \"May the sage grow wealthy.\" Yao declined. \"May the sage have many sons.\" Yao declined.\n\nThe border guard said, \"Longevity, wealth, and many sons—these are what all people desire. Why do you alone not desire them?\"\n\nYao replied, \"Many sons bring many fears; wealth brings many affairs; longevity brings many humiliations. These three are not the means to cultivate virtue, so I decline.\"\n\nThe border guard said, \"At first, I took you for a sage, but now you are merely a gentleman. Heaven gives birth to the myriad people and must assign them duties. If you have many sons and assign them duties, what fear is there? If you are wealthy and distribute it among others, what affairs remain? Wealth, longevity, and many sons are what people desire, yet one who studies the Dao considers them insufficient to warrant concern.\"\n\nZhuangzi, however, inverts this reasoning, revealing his loftiness. \"Heaven gives birth to the myriad people and must assign them duties\"—this is like a child falling to earth already apportioned clothing and food, as the mountain valleys say: \"A hundred grasses grieve at spring rain.\" \"Wealthy yet distributing it among others\" means each is entrusted to others.\n\nThe sage dwells like a quail and eats like a fledgling, moves like a bird without leaving a trace. When the world follows the Dao, he and all things flourish together; when the world lacks the Dao, he cultivates virtue and withdraws into obscurity. After a thousand years, weary of the world, he departs as an immortal, riding white clouds to the realm of the Emperor. The three calamities never reach him, and his body remains free from harm—what humiliation could there be?\n\n\"Dwelling like a quail\" means having no fixed abode. \"Eating like a fledgling\" refers to a young bird fed by its mother, nourished without seeking it—meaning he is without intention regarding food. \"Moving like a bird\" means flying without leaving a trace, dwelling wherever he alights without attachment. \"Flourishing with all things\" means each thing and I attain our proper lives. \"Cultivating virtue and withdrawing\" means seclusion when the world lacks the Dao. \"Weary of the world and ascending as an immortal\" conveys the meaning of liberation. \"White clouds\" and \"the Emperor’s realm\" refer to the heights of emptiness and non-being.\n\nThe three calamities are youth, maturity, and old age. The *Śūraṅgama Sūtra*’s analogy of the Ganges’ waters illustrates these three. \"The body remains free from harm\" means self-contentment.\n\nAbove, it spoke of longevity, wealth, and many sons, yet below, it reverses the order, placing longevity last and expanding on its refusal—this, too, is a pivot of the text’s artistry.\n\nThe border guard departed, and Yao followed, saying, \"I ask you...\" The border guard did not answer but only said, \"Withdraw.\" Yao still wished to ask, but the border guard would not respond, merely saying, \"Withdraw\"—as if to say, \"Leave.\" When Jieyu hastened to avoid Confucius and the old man with the staff passed by, they moved on.

      "translated_text": "Yao governed the world, and Bocheng Zigao was established as a feudal lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu, Bocheng Zigao resigned his lordship to till the soil. Yu went to see him and found him plowing in the wilds. Yu hastened to approach from the lower position and stood to ask: \"In the past, when Yao governed the world, you, sir, were established as a feudal lord. When Yao ceded the throne to Shun, and Shun to me, you resigned your lordship to plow. I venture to ask: what is the reason?\" Zigao said: \"In the past, when Yao governed the world, he did not reward, yet the people were encouraged; he did not rage, yet the people stood in awe. Now you reward and punish, and the people are no longer humane. Virtue has declined from this, punishments have been established from this, and the disorders of later ages have begun from this. Sir, why do you not depart? Do not hinder my work.\" He plowed on, head bowed, without looking back.\n\nThis passage further speaks of the world’s decline, one age worse than the last. Even in Yu’s time, it was already not equal to the eras of Yao and Shun. \"Do not hinder my work\" means \"Do not abandon my work\"—he had no leisure to speak with Yu, lest his plowing be neglected. The posture of plowing with head bowed is called *yiyi*. Yao did not reward or punish, yet now you reward and punish, and the people are not humane. The meaning is that rewards and punishments are not as good as having none, just as the intention behind \"There must be no litigation\" is expressed through the names of Yao, Shun, and Yu.\n\nIn the Great Beginning, there was Nonbeing; Nonbeing had no having, no name. This is the origin of the One. There was the One, yet no form. Things were thereby engendered—this is called *virtue*. Before form, there was division, yet it was so without gap—this is called *ming*. The abiding of movement gives rise to things; when things are completed, the principle of life is called *form*. When the form and body preserve the spirit, each has its proper pattern—this is called *nature*. Cultivating nature returns to virtue; when virtue reaches its utmost, it is one with the beginning. Being one, it is empty; being empty, it is vast. The harmony of beaks’ cries—this harmony unites with Heaven and Earth. Its union is seamless, like stupidity, like darkness. This is called *mysterious virtue*, one with the Great Compliance.\n\nThe Great Beginning is the origin of creation. What existed was only Nonbeing—there was not yet a character for \"having.\" If having is like Nonbeing, how could there be a name? This is the origin of the One. This \"One\" is the character for Nonbeing. Thus, it is said: \"There was the One, yet no form; things were thereby engendered\"—then there was having. All things each have their having—this is virtue. \"Before form\" refers to the time when the One arose. If there was division, yet it could not be divided further, it is said: \"yet it was so without gap.\" *Qie* means \"yet\"; the character *qie* is often followed by another. \"Without gap\" means undifferentiated; having division is distinct, yet this *ming* is the mandate of Heaven, the mandate of nature. The abiding of movement gives rise to things: the movement of primordial *qi* is ceaseless. When it gives rise to things, its movement abides there—thus it is said: \"The abiding of movement gives rise to things.\" The words \"abiding movement\" are extremely precise; do not read them carelessly. Movement is yang; abiding is stillness, stillness is yin. This sentence already contains the meaning of yang arising and yin completing. When things obtain it, they are born; once formed, the principle of life is all possessed. The movement of primordial *qi* becomes my life—this is called *form*. Observe how the character *form* is explained here—this is absent in other texts. \"When the form and body preserve the spirit, each has its proper pattern\"—this is called *nature*. This sentence is like the *Book of Songs*’ \"There are things, there are norms,\" and like the *Zuozhuan*’s \"The people receive the mean of Heaven and Earth to live, possessing the norms of movement and bearing.\" Form and body are *qi*; within *qi* is the spirit. The so-called norms are all enacted by this spirit—this is nature, which inherently contains the meanings of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom. If we discuss this text, the first \"virtue\" is actually \"nature,\" while this \"nature\" is the function of nature. Thus, it is said: \"Cultivating nature returns to virtue\"—cultivating this nature to restore its natural virtue. When virtue reaches its utmost, it is complete, then it is one with the beginning of things. \"Returns to virtue\" is like \"restoring propriety.\" *Zhi* means \"utmost.\" Being one with the beginning of things is emptiness; being empty is vastness. The harmony of beaks’ cries—this harmony unites with Heaven and Earth. Its union is seamless, like stupidity, like darkness. This is called *mysterious virtue*, one with the Great Compliance.",

Emptiness and vastness together give rise to speech that is not speech—where beaks meet in silence, silence is the absence of speech, while their cries are speech.

It means that when the cries of beaks are expressed as speech that is not speech, they unite with the natural. Through this natural harmony, they unite with Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: \"the harmony of beaks’ cries unites with Heaven and Earth.\" *Minmin* is like *mimim*—faint, as if stupid, as if dim, describing this state of harmony. This is called *mysterious virtue*, which is one with the Great Compliance. The Great Compliance is the principle of the Great Beginning, the natural order.\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan: \"There is a man who governs the Dao as if imitating others—can this be so or not? Can it be otherwise? The disputers say: ‘Separate hardness and whiteness as if suspended from the heavens.’ Can such a one be called a sage?\" Lao Dan replied: \"This is the work of clerks, bound by skill, wearied in body, and startled in mind. A hunting dog leashed for the fox grows anxious; the agile monkey, once brought from the mountains, is trapped. I tell you what you cannot hear and speak of what you cannot utter. Those with heads and feet but no heart or ears—multitudes of the formed—along with the formless and shapeless that yet endure, all lack their own movement and rest, life and death, decline and rise. This is not their true nature.\n\nThere is governance in man: forget things, forget Heaven—this is called forgetting the self. One who forgets the self is said to enter into Heaven. The idea of \"imitating others\" refers to emperors and kings sharing a common thread: using what I affirm to clarify what others cannot affirm, and what I deem so to clarify what others deem not so. Though the disputers’ words—hardness and whiteness, sameness and difference—are manifold, I can distinguish them as if suspended in the sky, making them clear and manifest. *Li* means \"to separate.\" *Xuyi* and *jixi* were explained in the previous section. *Chengsi* means being bound by others and thus filled with sorrow. *From the mountains* means captured and brought here. Earlier it said \"leashed for the *li*\"; here it says \"leashed for the fox\"—*li* is a scribal error. *What you cannot hear, what you cannot utter* refers to the nature and the Dao of Heaven, which cannot be heard. *Having heads and feet* describes people from crown to heel. *No heart, no ears* means no knowledge, no perception. *Formless and shapeless* refers to the naturally so. Those who see what is below form perceive form; those who see what is above form perceive the formless and shapeless that yet endure. This line is also strikingly phrased: *jin wu* means the world lacks such a person. *Movement and rest* refer to daily life; *decline and rise* to success and failure. In life and death, success and failure, all is naturally so. People know movement and rest, life and death, success and failure as such, but do not know *why* they are so.\n\nHan Yu’s *Preface to Sending Wen Chang* says: \"The reason rivers flow and people multiply is also a perceptive remark.\" But today, people read it carelessly. *Governing* refers to managing affairs. *Man* refers to human affairs. Governing through human affairs leaves no room for personal intent, hence it is said: \"there is governance in man.\" Not only are things forgotten, but even Heaven is forgotten—this is called forgetting the self. Forgetting the self means having no self. *Entering into Heaven* means entering into the natural, as previously called *entering into the non-human*. Earlier it said \"forgetting Heaven\"; here it says \"entering into Heaven.\" To enter is to become one with Heaven. Only by forgetting can one achieve unity.\n\nHowever, *Responding to Emperors and Kings* says: \"Never yet has one emerged from the non-human\"—one who has not yet forgotten Heaven. \"Never yet has one entered into the non-human\"—emerging above the realm of creation. This is \"entering into it.\"",
      "overlap_context": "o virtue\"—cultivating this nature to restore its natural virtue. When virtue reaches its utmost, it is complete, then it is one with the beginning of things. \"Returns to virtue\" is like \"restoring propriety.\" *Zhi* means \"utmost.\" Being one with the beginning of things is emptiness; being empty is vastness. The harmony of beaks’ cries—this harmony unites with Heaven and Earth. Its union is seamless, like stupidity, like darkness. This is called *mysterious virtue*, one with the Great Compliance.",

      "translated_text": "The discourse of Heaven differs again from this—these are all its stirring, inspiring moments, and one must not cling to them. Clinging makes *Zhuangzi* difficult to read.\n\nJiang Lümian saw Ji Che and said: \"The Lord of Lu said to me, 'I request instruction.' I could not decline the command. Having already spoken, I know not whether it struck the mark. Allow me to present it to you. I said to the Lord of Lu: 'You must practice reverence and frugality, elevate those of impartial loyalty, and harbor no favoritism. Then what commoner would dare not be at peace?'\"\n\nJi Che laughed heartily and said: \"If this is what you advise, your words on the virtue of emperors and kings are like a mantis raising its arms in anger to block a chariot’s wheel—it will surely fail the task. Moreover, if one acts thus, one’s own position becomes perilous. The more one displays one’s platform, the more things gather, and the more followers flock to it.\"\n\nJiang Lümian, startled, said: \"I am utterly at a loss regarding your words. Nevertheless, I wish to hear the drift of your teaching.\"\n\n*(Annotations within the text: \"To present\" means to lay out. \"Elevate those of impartial loyalty\" means to promote the worthy. \"Harbor no favoritism\" means to have no partiality. \"At peace\" means settled. \"Heartily laughed\" describes his manner. The mantis raising its arms to block the chariot’s wheel signifies that small strength is insufficient for such a great task. The phrase \"anger and flight\" appears in *The Book of Songs*: 'Grass and trees grow in anger.' Zhuangzi delights in using the word 'anger.' 'One’s own position' refers to the place where one stands by one’s own doing. If one displays one’s platform to others, people will flock to it, and those who come treading in its footsteps will grow ever more numerous. 'Many things' refers to the multitude of people. The implication is that the more one’s reputation flourishes, the more the world rushes toward it, and thus one becomes increasingly burdened. 'Startled' describes his expression. Hearing these words, he was left without understanding, hence 'utterly at a loss regarding your words.' 'Drift' refers to the remnant influence, or the general sense.)*\n\nJi Che said: \"The great sage governs the world by swaying and stirring the people’s hearts, shaping them into teachings and transforming customs. He extinguishes their harmful intentions and advances their solitary resolve, as if it were their nature to act thus, and the people remain unaware of how it came to be. If this is so, how could one rank Yao and Shun’s teachings above and place oneself below? Would one not rather align with virtue and rest the heart therein?\"\n\n*(Annotations: \"Swaying and stirring\" means to shift and move. \"Harmful intentions\" refers to the mind of contrivance. \"Solitary resolve\" is the resolve of solitary attainment—the solitary vision of one who has attained clarity. Once the people are shaped into teachings and their customs transformed, all selfish intentions are extinguished, and they advance toward the Dao, as if by their inborn nature, unaware of the ruler’s transformative influence. Hence, 'unaware of how it came to be.' To regard Yao and Shun as superior and oneself as inferior is to say, 'I rank Yao and Shun’s teachings above and place myself below.' How could Yao and Shun surpass me? Yet the phrasing here is deliberately provocative. 'Mingxing' conveys the sense of bowing one’s head in submission. 'People' is synonymous with 'human.' If all can act thus, who would willingly rank Yao and Shun’s teachings above and place themselves below? Aligning with the virtue of nature, the heart finds rest. 'Rest' means to dwell in peace. 'Desires' refers to the sage’s wish for the people to be thus.)*\n\nZigong traveled south to Chu and, on his return to Jin, passed through Hanyin. There he saw an old man tending his garden plot. The man had dug a tunnel to enter the well, where he embraced a jar to draw water and irrigate the rows. He toiled strenuously, yet his achievement was meager.\n\nZigong said: \"There is a device here that can irrigate a hundred rows in a day, requiring little effort yet yielding great results. Would you not wish to use it?\"\n\nThe gardener looked up at him and said: \"How does it work?\"\n\nZigong replied: \"Carve wood into a machine, with the rear heavy and the front light. It draws water as if pulling, swift as boiling water. Its name is the well-sweep.\"\n\nThe gardener flushed with anger, laughed, and said: \"I have heard from my teacher that where there are mechanical devices, there are mechanical affairs, and where there are mechanical affairs, there is a mechanical heart. When a mechanical heart resides in the breast, unalloyed whiteness is incomplete. When unalloyed whiteness is incomplete, the spirit’s life is unsettled. When the spirit’s life is unsettled, the Dao does not bear it. I am not ignorant of this—I would be ashamed to use it.\"\n\nZigong, abashed, hung his head and made no reply.\n\nAfter a while, the gardener said: \"What are you doing?\"\n\nZigong replied: \"I am a disciple of Confucius.\"\n\nThe gardener said: \"Are you not that learned man who emulates the sages, struts about to overshadow the crowd, and sings mournful songs to sell your name throughout the world? You are about to forget your spirit and qi, cast off your bodily form, and perhaps approach [the Dao]. Yet you cannot even govern yourself—how could you have leisure to govern the world?

      "translated_text": "Between the ridges, he dug channels to form irrigation ditches—drawing water as easily as pulling it forth, so that it surged and overflowed in abundance. These lines depict the self-satisfaction of one who relies on the well-sweep and other mechanical devices. To use such tools is to engage in mechanical affairs, and what drives their use is the mind. With a mechanical mind, unalloyed whiteness is incomplete—meaning it is not purely empty and luminous. When unalloyed whiteness is incomplete, the spirit’s life is unsettled, unable to embrace stillness or maintain unity. The Dao does not bear such a one—meaning it cannot carry the Way. In seeking learning and cultivation, one must carefully reflect on these points.\n\n*What are you doing?* is akin to the *Analects*’ *From where do you come?* *Emulating the sages* means aspiring to be like the sages. *Strutting about* describes an air of self-importance. *Singing mournful songs alone* refers to reciting one’s own praises when others do not acknowledge them—selling one’s name, seeking fame. The phrase *singing mournful songs alone* is a metaphor; it is not the same as *striking the chime-stones in Wei*. *Forget your spirit and qi* means to set aside one’s cleverness. *Cast off your bodily form* is to forget the self. If you could do this, you might still approach [the Dao]. If not, you cannot even govern yourself—how could you govern others? This is a rebuke to our sage’s teachings. *Do not hinder* means *do not delay*.\n\nZigong, humbled and crestfallen, lost his composure. He walked thirty *li* before recovering. His disciples asked: \"Who was that man earlier? Why did you, Master, change countenance and lose composure, remaining unsettled for the rest of the day?\" Zigong replied: \"At first, I thought there was only one man in the world—yet I did not know there was another like him. I have heard from the Master that the Way of the sage seeks what is feasible, pursues completion, expends little effort, and achieves much. Now this man is not like that. One who holds to the Dao attains full virtue; with full virtue, the form is whole; with the whole form, the spirit is whole—this is the Way of the sage. He entrusts his life to the people, moving among them without knowing where he goes, vast and perfectly complete. He must have forgotten the mind of profit, skill, and cunning.\"\n\n*Humbled and crestfallen* describes shame and embarrassment. *Lost his composure* means being at a loss. *Not returning to oneself* means not regaining one’s usual state. *The one man in the world* refers to Confucius. *Seeks what is feasible* means acting only when it can be done. *Expending little effort and achieving much* is like the well-sweep’s efficiency. *Now this man is not like that* refers to the gardener of Hanyin. *Entrusts his life to the world* means living among people without knowing his own direction—wandering aimlessly, like one who does not know where to go. *Vast and perfectly complete* means pure, unified, and whole. *He must have forgotten the mind of profit, skill, and cunning* means this man’s heart is free of such concerns. Here, *forgotten* is the same as *lost*—meaning *without*.\n\nSuch a man does not go where his will does not lead, does not act where his heart does not incline. Though the world may praise him, he remains unmoved by what he deems right; though the world may condemn him, he remains untroubled by what he deems wrong. The world’s praise or blame neither benefits nor harms him—this is what it means to be a man of full virtue. I am but one tossed by the winds and waves of the world.\n\n*Such a man* refers to the gardener of Hanyin. He does not let praise or blame affect him. He would not even heed praise—how much less blame? What he says and does in the world is called *attaining what he deems right*; what he does not say or do is called *losing what he deems right*. *Tossed by the winds and waves* means being driven by worldly affairs without self-mastery.\n\nReturning to Lu, Zigong reported this to Confucius. Confucius said: \"He is one who temporarily practices the arts of Hundun. He grasps one aspect but not the other—cultivating his inner self but not his outward conduct. That man of clarity, simplicity, non-action, and returning to the uncarved block—embodying his nature, holding fast to his spirit, and wandering among the common world—how could you not be startled? Moreover, what do you or I know of the arts of Hundun?\"\n\n*Temporarily* means *greatly*. *Practices the arts* means *greatly cultivates*. *Hundun* refers to the primordial state of heaven and earth. *Arts* means *the Way*. *Grasps one aspect* means holding to purity and unity. *Not the other* means the mind is undivided. *Inner* refers to the original heart; *outward* refers to external things. *Clarity* allows one to enter simplicity. *Simplicity* is the uncarved block. *Non-action* is returning to the natural simplicity of the uncarved block. *Embodying his nature* means preserving his nature whole. *Holding fast to his spirit* means unity. *How could you not be startled?* means it is fitting that you were startled—you do not yet know this Way, so it is natural to be astonished.\n\nZhun Mang was traveling east to the Great Valley when he encountered Yuan Feng by the eastern sea. Yuan Feng asked: \"Where are you going?\" He replied: \"To the Great Valley.\" \"What will you do there?\" \"The Great Valley—it is a thing that...\"",

      "translated_text": "The Great Valley—it is a thing that, though poured into, never fills, and though drawn from, never depletes. I shall wander there.\"\n\nYuan Feng said: \"Do you have no concern for the horizontal-eyed people? I wish to hear of sagely governance.\"\n\nZhun Mang replied: \"Sagely governance? Offices are established without failing their proper roles; the capable are promoted without failing their talents. All matters are seen in their true nature, and actions are taken as they ought to be. Words and deeds arise from oneself, and the world transforms accordingly. With a wave of the hand or a glance, the people of the four directions all come forth—this is called sagely governance. The Great Valley is the great sea. 'Horizontal-eyed people' is a term coined to describe the common folk. To wander in the Great Valley is to say that the world is not worth observing, and one will instead observe the sea. 'Offices are established without failing their proper roles' means each position is fitting to its task. 'The capable are promoted without failing their talents' means no talent is overlooked. 'Matters in their true nature' refers to the reality of affairs. Seeing all matters clearly, one acts according to what is fitting—thus it is said, 'All matters are seen in their true nature, and actions are taken as they ought to be.' What is done and said arises from oneself, not for others—thus the world naturally transforms. 'From oneself' means acting for oneself, not for others. 'A wave of the hand' means a gesture. With a wave or a glance, the people all respond. The *Book of Documents* says, 'Only when moved is there great response, awaiting the will.' 'A wave of the hand or a glance' conveys the idea of beckoning or bowing—this is how the sage governs the world. This refers to the ancient emperors and kings.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear of the virtuous person.\"\n\n\"The virtuous person dwells without thought, acts without concern, and harbors no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness. Within the four seas, all share in its benefits and rejoice; all are provided for and at peace. They are forlorn, like an infant who has lost its mother, or bewildered, like a traveler who has lost the Way. Yet their resources are abundant, though they know not whence they come; their food and drink are sufficient, though they know not from where. This describes the demeanor of the virtuous person—whether in stillness or motion, they hold no intent in their heart. Thus it is said, 'Dwells without thought, acts without concern.' They harbor no judgments of right or wrong, beauty or ugliness—this is what Buddhists call 'thinking neither good nor evil.' 'Shared benefits and provision' means rejoicing with others. 'Forlorn' describes their demeanor, like an infant who has lost its mother or a traveler who has lost the Way—both express their detachment from the world, though not without a sense of inevitability. Resources and sustenance come to them unbidden, for they are without intent. The virtuous person surpasses sagely governance by yet another level.\"\n\n\"I wish to hear of the spirit person.\"\n\n\"The supreme spirit rides the light, and form perishes and vanishes—this is called 'illuminating the vast' and 'fulfilling destiny to the utmost.' Emotions are fully realized, heaven and earth rejoice, and the myriad affairs dissolve. The myriad things return to their true nature—this is called 'primordial chaos.' 'Supreme spirit' speaks of their spirit soaring above. Beyond heaven and earth, even the light of sun and moon lies beneath them—thus it is said, 'rides the light.' 'Form perishes and vanishes' means that though they have a body, it seems as if they do not. 'Illuminating the vast' means great clarity. 'Fulfilling destiny' means exhausting the mandate of heaven. 'Emotions are fully realized' means fully realizing the emotions inherent in one’s nature. This 'emotion' is akin to Mencius’ 'if one follows their nature, they can do good.' Following the Dao of heaven and earth, they rejoice, and the myriad affairs no longer burden them—thus it is said, 'heaven and earth rejoice, and the myriad affairs dissolve.' 'Return to true nature' means returning to reality. When the myriad things all return to reality, they become one with the self. 'Primordial chaos' is the undifferentiated—this is the so-called 'Hun Dun.'

      "translated_text": "Men Wu Hui said: \"When the world is equally governed, does Youyu govern it? Or does he govern it only after it has fallen into chaos?\"\n\nChi Zhang Manji replied: \"The world universally desires governance—why then calculate whether Youyu is the remedy for Youyu’s own ailment? A bald man seeks a wig; the sick seek a physician. A filial son prepares medicine for his compassionate father, yet his countenance remains scorched with worry. The sage feels shame at this. Manji’s words, though not entirely correct, employ striking analogies to advance his argument. In his view, the question of whether military might falls short of yielding courtesy stems from Wu Hui’s query, which further denigrates Youyu’s governance. The world yearns for order, yet when Youyu governs it, this very governance becomes a burden.\n\nWhy prescribe medicine if not bald? Why wear a wig if not hairless? Why seek a physician if not ill? To call governing the world an illness is itself the sickness. Governance through non-action incurs no illness. A filial son who prepares medicine for his father remains disquieted—how much better if the father were never ill! Thus the sage deems it shameful to harbor the intent to govern the world.\n\nThough his words are not entirely orthodox, his analogies are singular and instructive. The character *xiu* (羞) here means shame. In the age of utmost virtue, worthies are not exalted, nor abilities employed. The ruler is like a bare branch; the people, like wild deer. They are upright yet unaware of righteousness; they love one another yet unaware of benevolence; they are sincere yet unaware of loyalty; they act appropriately yet unaware of trustworthiness. The living move and employ one another, yet do not regard it as a favor. Thus their conduct leaves no trace, their affairs no residue.\n\nThe world is uniformly pure, devoid of the names of worthies or abilities. Hence it is said: worthies are not exalted, abilities are not employed. *Biaozhi* (标枝) means a withered branch—only its limbs are visible, not its leaves—an analogy for being without emotion or desire. Uprightness refers to cultivating the self; mutual love, to intimacy; sincerity, to the substance of the heart. Loyalty means following the heart; appropriateness, acting as circumstances demand. The four \"unawares\" below—unaware of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness—indicate that in that era, such names did not yet exist. *Chundong* (蠢动) refers to all living beings; *xiangshi* (相使), to mutual assistance. Not regarding it as a favor means not treating it as a kindness. Conduct leaving no trace, affairs leaving no residue—this describes an age without judgments of right or wrong, praise or blame. These all depict the era of great antiquity.\n\nA filial son does not flatter his parents; a loyal minister does not fawn upon his lord—this is the height of ministerial and filial virtue. If a parent’s words are heeded and their conduct is good, the world calls the child unfilial. If a lord’s words are heeded and their conduct is good, the world calls the minister disloyal. Yet how can this be necessarily so? What the world deems right, they deem right; what it deems good, they deem good. Yet they are not counted among those who guide and restrain others.\"",

      "translated_text": "Yet does custom truly command greater reverence than parents, greater honor than lords? To be called a guide of others is to flush with anger; to be called a restrainer of others is to bristle with indignation—yet all one’s life one guides others, all one’s life one restrains others. Only by neither restraining nor flattering can one admonish one’s lord or father. To follow their words as right, their conduct as good, is not to admonish at all. In the eyes of lord and father, the admonisher is right and the non-admonisher wrong, yet in my dealings with the world, I follow what it deems good and affirm what it deems right—does this not reverse the world’s reverence for lord and father?\n\nThis suggests that what people today call the Dao is merely what the world universally affirms, not something attained in solitude and shared with the Creator. *Dao* means to guide and follow; *fang* means to restrain and flatter. If my so-called Dao aligns only with the world’s norms, then my actions merely guide and restrain the world. Should others apply the labels of \"guide\" or \"restrainer\" to me, I would surely resent it—yet all my life, I cannot escape guiding or restraining, for I cannot differ from the world.\n\nThe sage takes what is universally practiced as the Dao, but Zhuangzi holds that the Dao must transcend the age. Thus, he regards the ancient emperors and sages as inferior, unfolding his argument with such sweeping force that none can match it—though his words may go too far.\n\nGathering analogies, embellishing rhetoric, assembling followers: this is to begin with lofty aims yet end unable to rise above the age, so that one’s origins and outcomes, roots and branches, fail to align. Hence, they do not correspond. Donning robes and adornments, altering one’s countenance to charm the world, yet never calling oneself a guide or restrainer—such a one joins the crowd in affirming and denying, yet never admits to being one of them. What greater folly could there be?\n\n\"Gathering analogies\" means compiling the world’s metaphors to construct an argument; \"embellishing rhetoric\" means refining one’s words; \"assembling followers\" means drawing all scholars to oneself. Though one’s initial intent may surpass the age, in the end, one cannot escape the people of the time—thus, beginning and end, root and branch, do not cohere. Hence, they do not correspond. \"Donning robes and adornments, altering one’s countenance\" refers to the Confucians’ attire and ornamentation, their measured demeanor in instructing disciples, which is taken as charming the world. All this mocks the intent of our sages: what I affirm, my followers affirm; what I deny, my followers deny. Those who study under me are all common folk—if my affirmations and denials align with theirs, then I too am common. Yet though I walk among the common, I do not call myself common: this is the height of folly, utterly lacking insight.\n\nZhuangzi’s meaning is that what he alone has attained, others do not know, so he differs from them and thus speaks in such frustrated indignation. But this is not sound reasoning. To know one’s folly is not great folly; to know one’s confusion is not great confusion. The greatly confused never awaken; the greatly foolish never enlighten. If three walk together and one is confused, the destination may still be reached—for confusion is the minority. If two are confused, the journey is labored and the goal unattained—for confusion prevails. But now, the whole world is confused; though I have a direction, how can I attain it? Is this not lamentable?\n\nGreat music does not enter the ears of village folk; they laugh uproariously at *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua*. Thus, lofty words do not lodge in the hearts of the common; ultimate words do not surpass vulgar speech. Two jars and a bell may bewilder, making the path unknowable—yet now, the whole world is confused. Though I have a direction, how can it be attained? Knowing it cannot be attained, to force it is yet another confusion. Better to release it and not press forward. If I do not press, who will share my sorrow?\n\n\"Never awaken, never enlighten\" means not knowing oneself. *Qi xiang* means direction. If three walk together and two are confused, the journey is labored and the destination unreached—yet now, the whole world is confused by its doctrines. Though I alone have a direction, how can I turn the age? This \"I\" is Zhuangzi speaking of himself. *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* are names of village tunes; \"great music\" refers to ancient music, an analogy for his most profound teachings.",

      "translated_text": "To speak to those whose hearts remain unaligned with the multitude is to speak in vain. *Zhe Yang* and *Huang Hua* are but vulgar tunes—when vulgar speech prevails, the most profound words are silenced. \"Hanging one’s heels\" means sitting with feet dangling, refusing to walk; \"two who hang their heels in confusion\" refers to the earlier mention of two who are bewildered. \"Unable to reach one’s destination\" echoes the earlier \"labored journey, destination unreached.\" Scribal errors have miswritten \"hanging\" as \"jars\" and \"heels\" as \"bells,\" both unintelligible—yet comparing the preceding and following phrases, \"hanging heels\" is clearly the correct reading. Knowing it cannot be attained and yet forcing it is yet another confusion. This is a sigh of self-reproach: though I know it cannot be conveyed, I persist in trying to convey it—thus adding another layer of confusion. \"Release it\" means to let go; \"not press forward\" means not to insist on expounding. \"Share\" means to draw near. To leave it unspoken is to distance oneself from sorrow. This is self-explication.\n\nA leper gives birth in the dead of night, hastily kindling a torch to examine the child, anxious lest it resemble himself. A leper is a detestable person—here, the insertion of \"之\" mirrors the earlier \"骊姬之姬,\" a feature of the text’s style. A detestable man fears his child will resemble him, for he knows his own vileness. If even he knows himself, while the confused of the world remain self-ignorant, they are worse than the leper. Earlier, he spoke of \"great confusion, never awakened\" and \"great folly, never enlightened,\" yet here he offers two analogies without drawing a conclusion—this is but playful phrasing.\n\nA century-old tree, hewn into sacrificial goblets, adorned with blue and yellow patterns, is no different in essence from its severed trunk cast into a ditch. Though the goblet and the ditch-bound wood differ in beauty and ugliness, their loss of nature is the same. Robber Zhi and the virtuous Zeng and Shi may differ in conduct, yet their loss of nature is equal. Moreover, there are five ways to lose one’s nature: first, the five colors confuse the eyes, dulling their clarity; second, the five sounds confuse the ears, dulling their acuity; third, the five odors cloy the nose, congesting the sinuses; fourth, the five flavors clog the mouth, distorting its sense; fifth, preferences and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the nature. These five are all harms to life, yet Yang Zhu and Mo Di strut about, believing themselves to have attained something—this is not what I call attainment. If distress can be called attainment, then a turtledove or owl in a cage may also be said to have attained something.\n\nThe wood cast into the ditch is but the remnant of that carved into goblets. The same tree may become a goblet or be discarded in a ditch—though honor and disgrace differ, both are but withered wood. This is akin to the parable of Zang and Gu losing their sheep. The five colors, five sounds, five odors, and five flavors are all products of human artifice, thus they disrupt the nature. These four, along with preferences and aversions, are mentioned together to censure them. \"Congested\" means obstructed; \"sinuses\" refers to the passage from the nose to the forehead. \"Clogging the mouth\" means defiling it; \"distorting its sense\" means perverting it. Preferences and aversions are matters of right and wrong, likes and dislikes. When preferences and aversions muddle the heart, the natural nature is lost—hence, \"preferences and aversions agitate the heart, scattering the nature.\" The teachings of Yang Zhu and Mo Di are precisely those that agitate the heart with preferences and aversions, yet they claim to have attained something. If their doctrines can be called attainment, then beasts in cages may also be said to have attained something—this is a severe rebuke.\n\nFurthermore, preferences and aversions, sounds and colors, barricade the inner self; caps of skin and kingfisher feathers, sashes and tablets, long belts—these constrain the outer self. Within, the heart is hemmed in like a stockade; without, it is bound by layers of restraint. Though enmeshed in these bonds, one believes oneself to have attained something—this is like a convict with arms bound and fingers trussed, or a tiger or leopard in a sack or cage, yet still claiming attainment.\n\nPreferences and aversions manifest in speech and countenance, contending with others over right and wrong, leaving the heart obstructed—hence, \"preferences and aversions, sounds and colors, barricade the inner self.\" Caps of skin and kingfisher feathers, sashes and tablets, long belts are the attire of Confucians. Clothing and ritual forcibly constrain the self—hence, \"constrain the outer self.\" \"Sashes and tablets\" refer to holding tablets; \"long belts\" refer to the extended sash. Within, the heart is cramped and congested like a stockade; without, it is fettered by ritual and form like a convict in bonds. \"Ropes and snares\" refer to being bound; \"睆睆\" describes the gaze of one so constrained. Though one suffers as if bound, one still believes oneself to have attained something—would a convict or a caged beast also claim attainment? This is an extreme denunciation of Yang Zhu and Mo Di. \"Arms bound\" means hands tied; \"fingers trussed\" means fingers so bound they can be counted. \"Sack and cage\" are mentioned together, akin to the common saying, \"a monkey in a sack.\"",

      "translated_text": "**Zhuangzi Kouyi, Scroll Five**\n\n**Outer Chapters, \"The Dao of Heaven\" (Thirteenth)**\n\nThe Dao of Heaven operates without accumulation, thus all things are completed. The Dao of the Emperor operates without accumulation, thus the world submits. The Dao of the Sage operates without accumulation, thus the realm obeys. One who is enlightened by Heaven, attuned to the Sage, and permeates the six directions and four openings through the virtue of emperors and kings—his gaze is dimmed, yet nothing is not at rest.\n\nThe stillness of the sage is not stillness for stillness’ sake; it is stillness because it is good. Nothing in the myriad things suffices to disturb his heart, thus he is still. When water is still, it clearly reflects the beard and brows; its level surface serves as the standard for the great craftsman. If still water can be so luminous, how much more so the spirit? The heart of the sage is still—it is the mirror of Heaven and Earth, the looking glass of the myriad things.\n\nThe Dao of the Emperor and the Dao of the Sage are difficult to distinguish. Zhuangzi’s intent is likely to regard the Emperor as the Three Sovereigns and the Sage as the Five Emperors. To \"operate without accumulation\" is simply the pure and unceasing; the phrase \"without accumulation\" makes this even clearer. The central idea here, however, lies in the word \"stillness.\" Within utmost stillness, operation without accumulation—how could this be like withered wood or dead ashes? Yet readers often fail to perceive this.\n\n\"Six directions and four openings\" means east, west, south, north, above, and below—unobstructed in all ways. \"Dimmed\" conveys the sense of obscurity. \"The stillness of the sage is not stillness for stillness’ sake; it is stillness because it is good\"—this line is most vital. It means the sage does not favor stillness as an end in itself; rather, he desires this stillness because nothing in the myriad things suffices to disturb his heart. Thus, he does not seek stillness, yet is naturally still. The analogy of water and mirror for stillness is drawn from everyday speech, yet the phrasing is exquisitely precise.\n\nNow, emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth and the ultimate of the Dao and virtue. Thus, emperors, kings, and sages rest in them. To rest is to be empty; to be empty is to be full. Fullness is the principle of order. To be empty is to be still; to be still is to move; to move is to attain. To be still is to be non-active; in non-activity, those who handle affairs bear responsibility. In non-activity, one is at ease; one at ease cannot be afflicted by care, and thus enjoys long life.\n\nEmptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action—these are the root of the myriad things. Understanding this, one faces south as Yao did to be a ruler; understanding this, one faces north as Shun did to be a minister. With this, one embodies the virtue of the Son of Heaven and the Emperor on high; with this, one embodies the Way of the obscure sage and the unadorned king. With this, one retires to leisurely wander among rivers, seas, mountains, and forests; with this, one advances to govern the world, achieving great merit, illustrious fame, and the unity of all under Heaven.\n\n\"Emptiness, stillness, tranquility, indifference, quiescence, and non-action\" expand the single word \"stillness\" into eight characters to make the meaning clear. \"Equilibrium\" means settled; \"ultimate\" means supreme.",

      "translated_text": "Gazing upon this single phrase, how could its intent not desire engagement with the world? How could it not regard movement and stillness as one? In stillness, one becomes a sage; in movement, a king. \"Non-action\" is revered, and \"simplicity\" is such that none in the world can rival its beauty. One who clearly comprehends the virtue of Heaven and Earth—this is called the Great Root, the Great Ancestor, the one who harmonizes with Heaven. Thus, they harmonize and regulate the world, and in harmonizing with others, this is called human joy; in harmonizing with Heaven, this is called Heavenly joy.\n\nStillness makes one a sage; movement makes one a king—this is precisely the four characters \"inner sageliness, outer kingliness.\" \"Non-action\" is revered: \"revered\" means esteemed, for among the world’s ways, none is more esteemed than non-action. \"Simplicity\" means unadorned, without ornament. Though it may seem plain, none in the world surpasses its beauty, hence it is said, \"simplicity, such that none in the world can rival its beauty.\" \"Clearly comprehending\" means understanding this with perfect clarity. If one knows the virtue of Heaven and Earth, one may walk as Heaven’s companion, hence it is said, \"the one who harmonizes with Heaven.\" \"Harmony\" means union. The Great Root and Great Ancestor are praises of Nature’s virtue, akin to the meaning of \"self-rooted, self-founded.\" To harmonize and regulate the world is to unite with others, much like Yao’s words: \"You unite with Heaven; I unite with humanity.\" Having spoken of Heavenly harmony and human harmony, it further speaks of human joy and Heavenly joy, its brushwork soaring and transcendent—generally thus.\n\n*Zhuangzi* says: \"My master! My master! Who pulverizes the myriad things yet is not cruel, who bestows blessings upon ten thousand generations yet is not benevolent, who is older than high antiquity yet is not long-lived, who covers and bears Heaven and Earth, carves and sculpts the forms of things yet is not skillful—this is called Heavenly joy.\" These several lines are identical to those in the *Great Master* chapter, yet here they are prefaced with \"Zhuangzi says,\" whereas earlier they were attributed to Xu You’s words. Clearly, each is a parable—how could they be taken as literal speech?\n\nThus it is said: One who knows Heavenly joy, in life follows the Heavenly course, and in death transforms with things. In stillness, they share virtue with yin; in movement, they flow with yang. Therefore, one who knows Heavenly joy harbors no resentment toward Heaven, no blame toward others, no entanglement with things, no reproach from spirits. Hence it is said: In movement, they are Heaven; in stillness, they are Earth. With a single mind settled, they rule the world; their spirits are unharmed, their souls unwearied. With a single mind settled, the myriad things submit. This means applying the principle of emptiness and stillness to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things—this is called Heavenly joy. Heavenly joy is the heart of the sage, by which they nurture the world.\n\n\"The Heavenly course\" means following the natural principle of Heaven. \"Transformation with things\" means changing along with the myriad things. In stillness, they are yin; in movement, they are yang, flowing together. The Confucian school speaks only of \"not resenting Heaven, not blaming others,\" but here two more phrases are added: \"no entanglement with things, no reproach from spirits,\" further heightening its vigor. When spirits manifest in others, it is called \"haunting\"; when their spirits remain unharmed, it means their essence is concealed and not exposed. \"Their souls unwearied\" means their spirit is not exhausted. \"Spirits\" and \"souls\" refer to the same essence. When the mind is settled, the spirit is naturally settled, and the myriad things naturally submit. Applying the principle of emptiness and stillness to move between Heaven, Earth, and the myriad things, hence it is said, \"applying to Heaven and Earth, penetrating the myriad things.\" \"Nurturing the world\" means governing the world by benevolently cultivating others.\n\nNow, the virtue of emperors and kings takes Heaven and Earth as its model, the Dao and virtue as its master, and non-action as its constant. In non-action, they employ the world with ease; in action, they are employed by the world and find it insufficient. Thus, the ancients prized non-action. The superior practices non-action, and the inferior does likewise—this is the inferior harmonizing its virtue with the superior. When the inferior harmonizes its virtue with the superior, it does not act as a subject. The inferior practices action, and the superior does likewise—this is the superior aligning its way with the inferior. When the superior aligns its way with the inferior, it does not act as a ruler. The ruler must practice non-action to employ the world; the subject must practice action to be employed by the world—this is an unchanging principle.\n\nHeaven, Earth, the Dao, and virtue are all principles of non-action. Here, it once more contrasts non-action with action, taking non-action as the ruler’s way and action as the subject’s way. \"When the inferior harmonizes its virtue with the superior, it does not act as a subject\" means the subject should labor. \"When the superior aligns its way with the inferior, it does not act as a ruler\" means the ruler should be at ease. Employing the world is the ruler’s role; being employed by the world is the subject’s role. Here, ruler and subject form a single idea, which cannot be conflated with the *Innate Capacity* chapter’s discussion of the unity of Heavenly and human ways. If one clings rigidly to this, one cannot read *Zhuangzi* properly. For though this chapter speaks of the ruler practicing non-action and the subject practicing action, an earlier passage says, \"Understanding this, one may face north and serve as Shun’s subject,\" and further, \"Applying this to advance and govern the world, one’s achievements will be great and one’s name illustrious\"—thus, even the subject’s way may be non-action. How could this be self-contradictory? Therefore, if one reads *Zhuangzi* with such rigidity, one cannot grasp its meaning.\n\nThus, the ancient kings who ruled the world, though their wisdom encompassed Heaven and Earth, did not rely on their own plans; though their eloquence adorned the myriad things, they did not delight in their own words; though their abilities exhausted the world, they did not act for themselves. Heaven does not produce, yet the myriad things transform; Earth does not grow, yet the myriad things flourish. Emperors and kings practice non-action, yet the world’s achievements are complete. Hence it is said: None is more divine than Heaven, none richer than Earth, none greater than emperors and kings. Thus, the virtue of emperors and kings matches Heaven and Earth. This is riding Heaven and Earth, driving the myriad things, and employing the human way.\n\n\"Encompassing Heaven and Earth\" means embracing them. \"Adorning the myriad things\" speaks of their artistry. Things arise of themselves, not because Heaven produces them; things grow of themselves, not because Earth makes them grow. Hence it is said: Heaven does not produce, Earth does not grow. Emperors and kings, through non-action, complete the work of Heaven and Earth, thus harmonizing with them. \"Riding Heaven and Earth\" is like saying \"riding the six dragons to govern Heaven.\" \"Driving the myriad things\" means commanding all that moves. Here, it is merely praising the ruler’s way of non-action.\n\nThe root lies above, the branches below; the essential lies in the ruler, the detailed in the subject. The deployment of the three armies and five weapons is the branch of virtue. Rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the five punishments and corporal penalties are the branch of teaching. Ritual, laws, measures, and standards, the comparison of names and forms are the detailed aspects of governance. The sounds of bells and drums, the forms of feathered banners are the branch of music. Mourning garments of varying degrees, the rituals of weeping and wailing are the branch of mourning. These five branches require the operation of the spirit and the movement of the mind’s art before they can be followed. The branches are things the ancients possessed, but they are not what should come first.\n\nFrom this point onward, it once more discusses action, for while non-action is the root, action is the branch. The essential lies in the ruler’s way of non-action.",

      "translated_text": "The details lie with the ministers, for the ministers’ Way is action. The assistance of martial might and civil virtue is why it is said: \"The deployment of the three armies and the five weapons is the branch of virtue.\" The five weapons are the bow, the *shu*, the spear, the dagger-axe, and the shield. Clarifying punishments to aid teaching is why it is said: \"Rewards and punishments, benefits and harms, the five punishments are the branch of teaching.\" Measures and standards are gradations; \"names and forms\" refer to the names of things. *Bi* means analogy, and \"details\" means the most minute particulars. Ritual, laws, measures, and standards, bells and drums, feathered banners—none of these are the root of ritual and music. As it is said: \"How could it be merely about jade and silk, bells and drums?\" This is the branch of mourning. \"Rather than exchange it,宁戚’s meaning in these lines is most straightforward: the operation of the spirit and the movement of the mind’s art must come first, for all arises from the inner heart and is not imposed from without. The branches are things the ancients possessed, but they are not what should come first.\" This line is especially fine—how could Zhuangzi ever have intended to entirely discard weapons, punishments, ritual, and music?\n\nThe ruler leads and the minister follows; the father leads and the son follows; the elder brother leads and the younger brother follows; the elder leads and the younger follows; the man leads and the woman follows; the husband leads and the wife follows. Precedence and subordination are the natural course of Heaven and Earth. Thus the sage takes them as a model. Heaven is noble and Earth is base—this is the position of the numinous. Spring and summer come first, autumn and winter follow—this is the sequence of the four seasons. The myriad things transform and arise, each with its own form, flourishing and declining in due measure, flowing in ceaseless change. Even Heaven and Earth, most numinous of all, have their order of precedence and subordination—how much more so the human Way? Ancestral temples honor kinship; courts honor rank; village communities honor age; affairs honor worthiness. This is the sequence of the Great Way. To speak of the Way while violating its order is not the Way; to speak of the Way while not following the Way—how can one claim to have attained it?\n\nFollowing the \"lead\" and \"follow\" above, many analogies are given, for what should come first comes first, and what should come after comes after—all is the natural principle of Heaven and Earth. Thus the sage takes them as a model. Heaven and Earth, the four seasons—these are also metaphors. \"Transform and arise\" means to come into being; as the *Book of Songs* says, \"The *wei* also arises.\" *Meng* means sprouts; *qu* means differentiation. Things are born, each with its distinct form. Changing with the seasons, first flourishing then declining—this too is an analogy for the sequence of precedence. Flourishing does not last forever, nor does decline—all has its proper order. Thus it is called \"the gradation of flourishing and decline.\" From precedence and subordination, we come to nobility and baseness, for nobility and baseness are also matters of precedence.\n\n\"In affairs, honor worthiness\" means that in assigning duties, the worthy come first. Age, rank, kinship, and worthiness are all natural principles of the world, hence they are called \"the sequence of the Great Way.\" \"How can one claim to have attained the Way?\" means that if one does not know this sequence, how can one possess the Way? Thus the ancients who illuminated the Great Way first illuminated Heaven, then the Dao and virtue; once the Dao and virtue were illuminated, then benevolence and righteousness followed; once benevolence and righteousness were illuminated, then the division of duties followed; once the division of duties was illuminated, then names and forms followed; once names and forms were illuminated, then the assignment of tasks followed; once the assignment of tasks was illuminated, then investigation and reduction followed; once investigation and reduction were illuminated, then right and wrong followed; once right and wrong were illuminated, then rewards and punishments followed.\n\nOnce rewards and punishments were illuminated, the foolish and the wise were placed appropriately, the noble and the base occupied their stations, the benevolent and the worthy, the unworthy and the dissolute all followed their natures, each according to their abilities, each by their names. With this, one served superiors, nurtured inferiors, governed things, and cultivated the self. Wisdom and schemes were not employed, and all returned to their Heavenly nature. This is called the Great Peace, the ultimate of governance.\n\nThis passage speaks of the sequence of governance, which has nine levels: Heaven is the first, the Dao and virtue the second, benevolence and righteousness the third, the division of duties the fourth, names and forms the fifth, the assignment of tasks the sixth, investigation and reduction the seventh, right and wrong the eighth, and rewards and punishments the ninth. \"Division of duties\" means the guarding of offices. \"Names and forms\" refers to names. \"Assignment of tasks\" means assigning great responsibilities according to one’s office. *Yuan* means to exempt; *sheng* means to reduce. If one is not up to the task, they are exempted and their duties reduced. \"Right and wrong\" means distinguishing the good from the bad. \"Rewards and punishments\" means using the whip to mark them, or chariots and robes to make them manifest.\n\nZhuangzi speaks of the sequence of governance in this way. How could Heaven’s punishment of the guilty and Heaven’s mandate of virtue not involve rewards and punishments? Must one go through nine transformations before reaching them? Such discussions stray far from the sages. Yet to say \"first illuminate Heaven, then the Dao and virtue,\" and then list these subsequent levels—this is not abandoning the coarse to seek the refined. \"The foolish and the wise placed appropriately\" means being suited to one’s task; \"occupying their stations\" also means being in the proper position. *Xi* means to follow.",

      "translated_text": "When their true dispositions are at peace, the noble and the petty each have their proper place. This necessarily follows from their names—by adhering to names, one holds them accountable to reality. When schemes and plans go unused, they must return to Heaven. Though all affairs have their proper places, there is no room for personal intent; all simply return to spontaneity—this is the age of Great Peace.\n\nThus, the ancient texts say: \"There are forms and names.\" Forms and names existed among the ancients, but they were not what came first. Those who spoke of the Great Dao in ancient times described five transformations before forms and names could be established, and nine transformations before rewards and punishments could be discussed. To abruptly speak of forms and names is to ignore their root; to abruptly speak of rewards and punishments is to ignore their origin. To invert the Dao in speech and act contrary to it is what people manage—how can it manage people? To abruptly speak of forms, names, rewards, and punishments is to possess the tools of governance, not the Dao of governance. These may be applied to the world, but not used to embrace the world—this is what is called a debater, a one-sided person.\n\nRites, laws, measures, and degrees—along with the detailed comparisons of forms and names found in the ancients—are what the inferior use to serve the superior, not what the superior uses to nurture the inferior. The *Book* refers to ancient texts. Though forms and names appear within ancient texts, they never abandoned the root to pursue the branch. Thus, it is said: \"They are not what comes first.\" If one does not know the sequence of priority and speaks abruptly, one loses the root and origin.\n\n*Inverted* means to place things upside down; *contrary* means to go against. To act contrary to this natural Dao and invert its order is to be governed by others—this is to be used by the world, not to use the world. To regard forms, names, rewards, and punishments as the tools of governance and to take the division of duties and benevolence and righteousness as the Dao of governance—how could this be mistaken? Yet it remains a jumbled and fragmented approach, one-sided and partial.\n\nWhat the superior uses to nurture the inferior is the way of the ruler; what the inferior uses to serve the superior is the way of the minister.\n\nIn ancient times, Shun asked Yao: \"How does the Son of Heaven apply his mind?\"\nYao said: \"I do not slight the helpless, nor abandon the destitute. I grieve for the poor who suffer unto death, cherish the young, and pity women—this is how I apply my mind.\"\nShun said: \"It is fine, but not yet great.\"\nYao said: \"Then what should it be like?\"\nShun said: \"Heavenly virtue emerges in tranquility; the sun and moon shine, and the four seasons proceed. Like the constancy of day and night, the clouds move and the rain falls.\"\nYao said: \"Then I am but entangled in turmoil! You unite with Heaven, while I unite with man.\"\nNow, Heaven and Earth are what the ancients revered most, what the Yellow Emperor, Yao, and Shun all praised together. Thus, those who ruled the world in ancient times—what did they do? They simply followed Heaven and Earth.\n\n*Arrogance* means contempt; *suffering* evokes compassion.",

Yet to say \"first illuminate Heaven, then the Dao and virtue,\" and then list these subsequent levels—this is not abandoning the coarse to seek the refined. \"The foolish and the wise placed appropriately\" means being suited to one’s task; \"occupying their stations\" also means being in the proper position. *Xi* means to follow.",

As the sun sets, the moon rises; as cold departs, heat arrives—thus the sun and moon shine, and the four seasons proceed. Day follows night, and night follows day, ever constant and unchanging. Clouds move and rain falls, following the seasons naturally. All these describe the meaning of \"acting without acting.\"\n\n\"Jiaojiao raorao\" means turmoil and disturbance. Yao said: \"What I have done does not measure up to you; I cannot avoid self-generated turmoil. Thus, I unite only with man, not yet with Heaven.\" The following three sentences are Yao’s sigh of self-reproach.\n\n\"Heaven and Earth\" are what the ancients revered most, for the principle of Heaven and Earth’s spontaneity has been the greatest from antiquity to the present. \"Shared praise\" means they are equally admired.

If one clings to names and titles, the meaning becomes obstructed and impassable.\n\nConfucius once sought to deposit books in the Zhou archives. Zilu advised: \"I have heard that among the Zhou’s archivists, there is an elder named Lao Dan who has retired and resides at home. If you wish to store these books, Master, you might visit him.\" Confucius said: \"Very well.\" He went to see Lao Dan, but Lao Dan refused. Thereupon, Confucius expounded the Twelve Classics to persuade him. Lao Dan countered, saying: \"This is too reckless. I would hear only the essentials.\" Confucius replied: \"The essentials lie in benevolence and righteousness.\" Lao Dan asked: \"Are benevolence and righteousness part of human nature?\" Confucius said: \"Indeed. The noble person who lacks benevolence cannot be perfected; without righteousness, they cannot live. Benevolence and righteousness are the true nature of humanity. What else could they be?\"\n\nLao Dan said: \"May I ask what benevolence and righteousness are?\" Confucius replied: \"To be joyful at heart, harmonious with all things, to love universally without partiality—this is the essence of benevolence and righteousness.\" Lao Dan said: \"Your words approach the mark.

      "translated_text": "Decisiveness indeed! Since what is perceived through seeing and hearing is fundamentally insufficient to grasp the Dao, those who truly know it must remain silent, while those who speak cannot truly know it. How could the understanding of people today possibly reach this insight? How lamentable!\n\nDuke Huan was reading in the hall while Wheelwright Bian carved a wheel below. Setting down his mallet and chisel, Bian ascended and asked the Duke: \"May I dare ask what words Your Lordship is reading?\"\nThe Duke replied: \"The words of the sages.\"\nBian asked: \"Are the sages still alive?\"\nThe Duke said: \"They are already dead.\"\nBian said: \"Then what Your Lordship reads is but the dregs and lees of the ancients!\"\n\nThe Duke said: \"How can a wheelwright presume to criticize what I read? If you have an explanation, speak; if not, you die!\"\nWheelwright Bian said: \"From the perspective of my craft, when I carve a wheel slowly, it is smooth but not secure; when I carve quickly, it is rough and does not fit. Neither too slow nor too fast—I grasp it in my hands and respond with my heart, yet my mouth cannot express it. There is a knack to it that resides within, which I cannot convey to my son, nor can my son receive it from me. Thus, at seventy years of age, I am still carving wheels in my old age. If the ancients, together with what could not be transmitted, have died, then what Your Lordship reads is but the dregs and lees of the ancients!\"\n\nThis extends the earlier analogy, illustrating through this example how the Dao cannot be transmitted through words.

      "translated_text": "Swiftness is tightness. Loose yields sweet smoothness, easy entry yet lacking firmness; tight yields astringency, difficult entry. The key lies in neither loose nor tight—there exists a measure inherent within. Yet this knack cannot be conveyed, even from father to son. What books record are but the words of the ancients; if the person is no longer present, how can one obtain what cannot be transmitted? Feeding on dregs and lees, how can one know the taste of wine?\n\nIf the Dao could be offered to others, would one not offer it to one’s lord? If it could be transmitted to others, would one not pass it to one’s son? The same principle applies. Generally, what books record and expound upon is never confined to a single matter. This text, when turned over and over, speaks only of the principle of spontaneity, yet it spins forth many words—stranger with each turn—without a second theme. Viewed thus, the incomparable depth of Zhuangzi becomes ever more apparent. The same holds for those who read Buddhist scriptures.\n\n**Outer Chapters, \"Heaven’s Motion\" (Chapter Fourteen)**\nDoes heaven move? Does earth abide? Do the sun and moon contend for their places? Who presides over this? Who maintains its order? Who, without purpose, propels it forward? Is there some mechanism that compels it, unable to rest? Or does it revolve of itself, unable to halt? Are clouds the cause of rain? Or is rain the cause of clouds? Who brings them forth? Who, without purpose, indulges in excess and urges them on? The wind rises from the north, now west, now east, swirling aloft—who exhales and inhales it? Who, without purpose, stirs and scatters it?\n\nThese lines are exquisitely precise—five instances of *hu* (乎), unmatched by any before or since. Does heaven move in a daily revolution of its own accord? Does earth, with its fourfold motion, truly abide in stillness? The sun departs, the moon arrives—yet this is called \"contending for their places,\" as though they were locked in pursuit. Who could have coined these three words—*presides*, *maintains*, *order*—with such force? *Mechanism that compels, unable to rest; revolves of itself, unable to halt*—these words suggest it acts not by its own will. Heaven’s qi descends, earth’s qi ascends, giving rise to clouds and rain—but which gives rise to which? Such a question is indeed extraordinary. *Brings forth* means to rise; *stops* means to cease, akin to tension and release. Who causes it to act or cease? *Indulges in excess* means to be unrestrained; *urges* means to encourage. Who engages in wanton play and aids in the formation of clouds and rain?",

      "translated_text": "The winds arise from all four directions—yet when we speak of their origin in the north, this follows the celestial form in its description. As heaven leans toward the north, winds naturally come from the north, sometimes from the west, sometimes from the east, sometimes ascending, sometimes descending, drifting and wandering in their comings and goings. The text speaks of \"above\" but not \"below\"—such is the stylistic convention.\n\n*Rustling and swaying*—this describes their motion. One dares to ask: why is this so? Wu Xian of the Shao clan replied, \"Let me tell you: heaven has six poles and five constants. When emperors and kings follow them, there is order; when they oppose them, there is chaos. The affairs of the Nine Luo bring governance to completion and virtue to fulfillment, illuminating and overseeing the earth below, so that all under heaven revere them. This is what is called the Supreme Sovereign.\"\n\nThe questioner does not name a person—another shift in stylistic technique. The *six poles* are the six qi; the *five constants* are the five phases. Both the six qi and the five phases are the natural principles. The *Nine Luo* refers to the nine provinces; *Luo* means to gather, interchangeable with *luo* (to fall), as the ancient characters are mutually used. *Governance to completion and virtue to fulfillment* means that when emperors and kings follow these natural principles to govern the nine provinces, their achievements are perfected and their virtue is fulfilled. They oversee all under heaven, and the people revere them—these are the men above the Three Sovereigns. Thus it is said: this is called the Supreme Sovereign.\n\nThe Grand Steward Dang of Shang asked Zhuangzi about *ren* (benevolence). Zhuangzi said, \"Tigers and wolves possess *ren*.\" Dang asked, \"What do you mean?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Father and son show affection for one another—how is this not *ren*?\" Dang said, \"May I ask about perfect *ren*?\" Zhuangzi said, \"Perfect *ren* has no partiality.\" The Grand Steward said, \"I have heard that without partiality, there is no love; without love, there is no filial piety. Can perfect *ren* be unfilial?\" Zhuangzi said, \"Not so. Perfect *ren* is loftier still—filial piety is insufficient to describe it. This is not a matter of surpassing filial piety, but of falling short of it.\"\n\nTaking tigers and wolves as examples of *ren* aligns with the idea that even bandits have their *Dao*. These are all critiques aimed at the Confucians. Though Zhuangzi’s words may be one-sided, they still hold their own logic. The saying goes, \"Even fierce tigers do not eat their young\"—is this not the *ren* of tigers and wolves? *Perfect ren has no partiality* means that while *ren* is rooted in mutual affection, one who embodies perfect *ren* does not rely on such affection—this is the ultimate *ren*. *Filial piety is insufficient to describe it* does not mean it is unfilial, but that when one reaches perfect *ren*, filial piety need not be spoken of. Perfect *ren* stands above filial piety, surpassing it. The Grand Steward’s question, however, reflects a failure to grasp filial piety—he has not yet fully realized *ren*, and thus falls short of filial piety. One who fully embodies *ren* transcends it.\n\nOne who travels south to Ying, facing north, cannot see Mount Ming—why is this? Because it is too far away. Thus it is said: replacing reverent filial piety with loving filial piety is difficult; replacing loving filial piety with forgetting one’s parents is difficult; replacing forgetting one’s parents with making one’s parents forget oneself is difficult; replacing making one’s parents forget oneself with mutual forgetting with all under heaven is difficult; replacing mutual forgetting with all under heaven with making all under heaven forget oneself is difficult.\n\nVirtue surpasses that of Yao and Shun yet is not performed; beneficence extends to ten thousand generations, yet none under heaven know of it—how could one merely sigh and speak of *ren* and filial piety? Filial piety, brotherly respect, *ren*, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these are all self-exhortations that labor one’s virtue, and are not worth esteeming. Thus it is said: the most noble is when state rank is discarded; the richest is when state wealth is discarded; the most desired is when fame and reputation are discarded. Only then does the Dao remain unchanging.\n\nMount Ming lies in the north. Traveling south to Ying, one cannot see the northern mountains—this is because they are too distant, not because they are insufficient. This is a simple analogy to illustrate surpassing and falling short of filial piety, and it is indeed extraordinary. *Reverent filial piety* still leaves traces; *loving filial piety* leads to mutual forgetting. From this point onward, the text speaks of forgetting one’s parents, forgetting all under heaven, and all under heaven forgetting oneself—each step is higher than the last. The stylistic technique of this text is such that having traces is inferior to having none, having intention is inferior to having none, and discarding is the ultimate aim.\n\nTo scorn Yao and Shun as unworthy of being called virtuous, to see beneficence extending to ten thousand generations as insufficient to be called *ren*—how could one boast of *ren* and filial piety? Sighing in admiration is self-praise. Filial piety, brotherly respect, *ren*, righteousness, loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and incorruptibility—these eight are what the world considers fine virtues, but in truth, they are merely self-exhortations that labor one’s virtue. Thus it is said: *self-exhortations that labor one’s virtue are not worth esteeming*. *Labor* means to toil; *not worth esteeming* means not worth valuing.",

Adrift and silent, I could no longer find myself.\" This is but another fabricated tale, a peculiar account—first fear, then weariness, and finally confusion. When I heard this music, my state changed thrice: adrift, my spirit scattered; silent, my mouth sealed; ill at ease, I could not find peace, so startled was I by this music.\n\nThe Emperor said: \"Perhaps it was indeed so for you. I performed it with human artistry, harmonized it with Heaven, conducted it with ritual and righteousness, and established it in the Great Purity.

      "translated_text": "The \"Heaven\" here refers to heavenly principle; *ritual propriety and righteousness* denote the orderly progression of sound. *Great Purity* aligns with the workings of creation. The initial sound is thus balanced and upright. From \"the four seasons arise in succession\" onward, it speaks of the time of activation, when transformations stir and astonish, delighting and startling, now arising, now ceasing—yet without any sign of a final destination.\n\n*Flourishing* pertains to the civil; *withering* pertains to the martial. *Order* refers to sequence. The four seasons give life and take it, and the myriad things follow their sequence in growth, flourishing and then declining, just as music has its civil and martial order. The zither possesses civil and martial markers, which is precisely this civil-martial sequence—hence it is said, \"Civil and martial follow their order.\" *Flowing radiance* means smooth and luminous. Harmonizing the sounds of yin and yang, clear and turbid, it flows thus luminously. When hibernating creatures are about to stir and thunder resounds, one meets it without seeing its beginning, follows it without seeing its end—hence it is said, \"In the end, it has no tail; in the beginning, it has no head.\" *Head and tail* are simply *beginning and end*. *Dying and living, collapsing and rising* are ever constant and inexhaustible—this speaks of how it now acts, now ceases, both constant and ever-changing, so its constancy is boundless. Seeking its place of return to unity yet finding none, it is said, \"Yet never to be awaited.\" This is why you were afraid upon first hearing it.\n\nI then performed it with the harmony of yin and yang, illuminating it with the brightness of sun and moon. Its sound could be short or long, soft or firm, its transformations uniform and unconfined—hence it is ever-present. Filling the valleys, filling the ravines, filling the crevices, the spirit guards it, measured by things. Its sound soars and lingers, its name lofty and luminous. Thus do ghosts and spirits guard its depths, while the sun, moon, and stars follow their courses. I halt it at the bounded, yet let it flow into the boundless. You may ponder it yet cannot know it, gaze upon it yet cannot see it, pursue it yet cannot reach it. Suddenly, it stands in the Dao of the four voids, leaning against a withered catalpa, chanting. The eye exhausts itself in what it seeks to see, strength fails in what it seeks to pursue. Since I cannot reach it, my form fills the emptiness, and I yield and drift. You, too, yield and drift—hence your negligence.\n\nThe harmony of yin and yang and the brightness of sun and moon are merely the meaning of harmonious flourishing and luminous radiance. Long and short, soft and firm, all are transformations—none can be fixed—hence it is said, \"Its transformations are uniform and unconfined.\" *Uniform* means the same. *Hence* refers to what was said before. *Unconfined* means ever-renewing.",

Follow the myriad things, measuring them—this speaks of my making of music: not employing cleverness or skill, but following nature.\n\nIts sound, resonant and expansive, arises naturally, bearing the name of loftiness. *\"Spirit guards its depths\"*—this is that very loftiness. It does not harm the soul, nor does it weary. The sun, moon, and stars move in their courses, their coming and going natural. As if halting, yet also as if without halt—hence it is said, *\"It halts at what is bounded, flows without cease.\"* To ponder yet not know, to gaze yet not see, to pursue yet not reach—all describe how it seems to be a thing yet is not a thing.\n\nThe *four voids* are the Great Void. At that moment, I stand within the Great Void, leaning against a withered catalpa, chanting. Though I long to see, it cannot be exhausted; though I long to pursue, it cannot be reached. My form, though full, forgets itself as if empty. Thus I yield and drift—how much more so for you? It is precisely this yielding and drifting that makes you negligent.\n\n*Tangran* (傥然) describes a state without intent. Again, I play music without negligence, tuning it to the command of nature. Thus it seems to mingle and surge like thickets and forests, music without form, spreading and unfurling without drag, dark and dim yet soundless, moving without direction, dwelling in profound obscurity. Some call it death, some call it life; some call it substance, some call it glory. Flowing, scattering, shifting—without fixed sound, the world doubts it. Yet the sage examines it: the sage is one who penetrates to reality and fulfills destiny.\n\nThe heavenly mechanism is not displayed, yet the five senses are all complete—this is called *heavenly music*. Though wordless, the heart delights. Thus the Lord of Yan sang its praise:\n\n*\"Hear it yet hear no sound,\nSee it yet see no form.\nFilling Heaven and Earth,\nEnveloping the six directions—\nYou long to hear it yet find no point of contact,\nAnd so remain perplexed.\"*\n\nWithout negligence, it is ceaseless.",

      "translated_text": "The natural mandate is none other than the natural principle. \"Mixed and pursuing, thronging and growing\" describes the myriad things thronging and growing in mutual pursuit. \"Forest music\" speaks of a music so abundant and pervasive that all is music. Yet no form is seen; it spreads and unfurls without the need for force to drag it. Dark and dim, it cannot be heard. It moves without fixed direction, dwelling in the profound obscurity of the unfathomable and unsearchable. It is neither life nor death, neither glory nor substance. Flowing, scattering, shifting—it does not adhere to any constant sound. When the world reaches this point, it congeals in incomprehension and turns to the sage for inquiry. *Ji* means to examine. To \"penetrate to reality\" is to penetrate to the true principle; to \"fulfill destiny\" is to reach the ultimate of the natural.\n\nThe five senses are all complete, yet the heavenly mechanism does not move—this is what is meant by the ears, eyes, hands, and feet all being present, yet seeing, hearing, and movement all occurring without self-awareness. Thus one attains the joy of the natural, which is called *heavenly music*. As the *Śūraṅgama Sūtra* says: \"When the backward-flowing current returns to perfect unity, the six senses cease to function\"—this is the meaning of \"the heavenly mechanism does not move, yet the five senses are all complete.\" \"Though wordless, the heart delights\" speaks of a joy beyond words. Though you long to hear it, there is no point of contact, and so you remain perplexed.\n\nHere, another eulogy is composed—a marvelous example of textual elaboration. \"Filling Heaven and Earth, enveloping the six directions\" means it pervades all. These four lines of the eulogy contain no separate meaning; by adding a turn, they form a rhythm—this is the art of composition.\n\nAs for joy: it begins with awe. Awe gives rise to reverence; reverence leads to negligence; negligence leads to escape; escape culminates in perplexity; perplexity culminates in ignorance; and ignorance culminates in the Dao. Only then can it be carried and journeyed with. Earlier, awe, negligence, and perplexity did not reveal their meaning; it is only at the point of culmination—ignorance—that one may enter the Dao. This turn is especially ingenious, for it speaks of the stages through which one must pass in seeking the Dao before making progress. Reverence conveys solemnity; negligence leading to escape is the moment of being unable to stop; perplexity leading to ignorance is the moment when consciousness and the six senses cease to function. Observing these three stages, one sees the workings of the Chan school. Though the joy is expressed through three hypotheticals, there is no great difference—only the stirring of its words.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled west to Wei, Yan Yuan asked Shi Jin, \"What do you make of the Master’s conduct?\"\nShi Jin said, \"Alas! Your Master is in dire straits.\"\nYan Yuan said, \"How so?\"\nShi Jin said, \"Before the straw dogs are displayed, they are kept in fine baskets and covered with embroidered cloth. The invocator fasts and purifies himself to present them. But once they have been displayed, passersby trample their heads and backs, and gatherers take them to burn. If one were to gather them again, place them in fine baskets, cover them with embroidered cloth, and wander or rest beneath them, one would surely dream incessantly—or at the very least, suffer from blurred vision.\n\nNow your Master has taken the straw dogs of the former kings—already displayed—and with his disciples wanders and rests beneath them. Thus he was assaulted by the felling of trees in Song, had his traces erased in Wei, and was impoverished in Shang and Zhou. Is this not his dream? Besieged between Chen and Cai, he went seven days without cooking a meal, with death and life as neighbors. Is this not his blurred vision?\"\n\nThis hypothetical discussion shows that even in Confucius’ time, there were sages like the Old Man Carrying Reeds, Jieyu the Madman of Chu, and the recluses Changju and Jieni—all of this kind. Straw dogs are made of bound grass to dispel misfortune. Once used in sacrifice, they are discarded. *Qie* and *yan* are baskets.",

      "translated_text": "Grass is gathered for straw. *Mi* means dust entering the eyes. This is to say that what the Confucians study are all the stale words of antiquity, useless in the present age. Now, in water, nothing is better than a boat; on land, nothing is better than a cart. Because a boat can travel on water, if one seeks to push it onto land, it will never move an inch in a lifetime. Yet antiquity and the present are not like water and land, nor are Zhou and Lu like boats and carts. To insist on practicing Zhou’s ways in Lu is like pushing a boat onto land—laborious yet fruitless, and one will surely bring misfortune upon oneself. They do not understand the transmission of the boundless Way, which responds to things without exhaustion.\n\nThe analogy of rivers and land, boats and carts, speaks of the difference of times. The transmission of the boundless Way does not cling to a single path. Since antiquity, what has been transmitted is precisely a Way that adapts to the times without clinging to one path, thus responding to the world without exhaustion.\n\nHave you alone not seen the well-sweep? When pulled, it bows; when released, it rises. What pulls it is not the pull of others. Thus it bows and rises without offending anyone. Bowing and rising in accord with others, with no place for personal inclination—this is the analogy of responding to things without fixed direction.\n\nTherefore, the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors do not pride themselves on uniformity but on governance. Thus, the rites, righteousness, laws, and standards of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors are like crabapples, pears, oranges, and pomelos: their flavors differ, yet all are pleasing to the mouth. Thus rites, righteousness, laws, and standards are things that change with the times. Crabapples, pears, oranges, and pomelos—all are praised by people, yet their flavors differ. This illustrates the meaning that the Three Kings had different rites and the Five Emperors different music. *Zha* is a kind of fruit resembling a pear but sour.\n\nNow, if one takes a gibbon or macaque and dresses it in the robes of the Duke of Zhou, it will surely bite, tear, and rip them off until they are completely cast aside and only then be satisfied. To observe the difference between antiquity and the present is like the difference between a gibbon or macaque and the Duke of Zhou. To force people of today to practice the rites and music of the ancients is like forcing a gibbon or macaque to wear human clothes—yet here it is not called \"human clothes\" but \"the robes of the Duke of Zhou,\" with the intent to mock the sages. The Duke of Zhou established rites, including the regulations for caps, crowns, robes, and skirts, hence \"the robes of the Duke of Zhou.\"\n\nThus, when Xishi was afflicted with heart pain and knit her brows in her village, the ugly women of her village saw it and thought it beautiful. Returning home, they too clutched their chests and knit their brows. The rich people of the village, seeing this, firmly shut their doors and would not come out. The poor people, seeing it, took their wives and children and fled. They knew that knitting brows was beautiful but did not know why knitting brows was beautiful. How pitiful! And how straitened is your Master!\n\n*Pin* means to knit the brows. For people of today to imitate the ancients is like the village women imitating Xishi’s knitting of brows. The reason knitting brows is beautiful is that there must first be a Xishi; the reason the Way is practicable is that there must first be the ancients. Yet your Master says, \"You, sir, are my Master.\" This hypothetical discussion employs six analogies in succession, each finely crafted. Nothing is more difficult than analogies. Wang Quxuan once said, \"All my life, I have wanted to create my own analogies, but every time I think of one, it turns out to have been used by someone before.\" In the *Zhuangzi*, every analogy is extraordinarily unique.\n\nConfucius, at the age of fifty-one, had still not heard the Way. He went south to Pei to see Lao Dan. Lao Dan said, \"Have you come? I have heard that you are a worthy man of the north. Have you also attained the Way?\" Confucius said, \"I have not.\" Laozi said, \"How have you sought it?\" Confucius said, \"I sought it in measures and numbers, but after five years I had not attained it.\" Laozi said, \"How else have you sought it?\" Confucius said, \"I sought it in yin and yang, but after twelve years I had still not attained it.\" Laozi said, \"Indeed! If the Way could be offered, there is no one who would not offer it to their lord. If the Way could be presented, there is no one who would not present it to their parents. If the Way could be told to others, there is no one who would not tell it to their brothers. If the Way could be given to others, there is no one who would not give it to their children and grandchildren.\"\n\n*Measures and numbers* refer to rites and music; *yin and yang* refer to the principles of the myriad things. The five and twelve years have no particular significance; they merely say that he sought it diligently for a long time without attainment. From \"If the Way could be offered\" onward, the four sentences are exquisitely phrased. This is precisely how the Way cannot be transmitted, and such language brings it forth.\n\nYet it cannot be so for no other reason than this: what is within has no master and does not abide; what is without has no standard and does not proceed. What issues from within is not received from without—thus the sage does not expound. What enters from without has no master within—thus the sage does not retain it.\n\n*What is within has no master and does not abide* means it is not self-evident or self-realized. It speaks of those who study the Way: though they may hear something from without, if within they have no master, it is not something they have attained themselves. Though they may wish to retain it, it will not stay.\n\n*What is without has no standard* means there is nothing to verify or correct. This is what the Chan school calls \"confirmation.\" If within me I have already attained something myself and verify it with a person of the Way, then I can proceed on my own. If I have no attainment, then how can I be confirmed by others? Though these two sentences distinguish between inner and outer, in truth they both emphasize self-attainment.\n\n*What issues from within is not received from without*—this speaks of teaching others. Though my words issue from within, if you cannot receive them, then the sage will not speak to you. When I spoke with Yan Hui all day, he never opposed me—he was able to receive. If you cannot receive, then the sage will not tell you.\n\nThus it is said, \"The sage does not expound.\" *What enters from without has no master within*—this speaks of receiving teaching. Though my words enter from without, if in your hearing you have no insight and within you have no master, though you hear the words, you will gain nothing. This is what the Chan school means by \"entering by the gate is not the family treasure.\" Since you have no attainment, you merely take the sage as retaining it. In truth, the sage does not retain it.\n\nDo you disciples take me as retaining it? I do not retain it. You are this—this is the meaning. These four sentences are all profoundly subtle; you must examine them carefully. The reason the Way cannot be transmitted has no other cause—its flaw lies in these four sentences alone. Therefore, it first says, \"Yet it cannot be so for no other reason than this.\"\n\nFame is a public vessel; it cannot be taken in excess. Benevolence and righteousness are the travelers’ huts of the former kings. One may stay in them for a night but cannot dwell in them for long. The perfected persons of antiquity borrowed the Way from benevolence and lodged in righteousness to wander in the realm of carefree ease, to eat in the fields of simplicity, and to stand in the gardens of non-transaction. Carefree ease is non-action; simplicity is easy nourishment; non-transaction is no expenditure.\n\nThe ancients called this \"the wandering of gathering the genuine.\" *Fame cannot be taken in excess*—this mocks the Confucians’ love of fame.",

      "translated_text": "The *qulu* is a thatched hut—benevolence and righteousness cannot be dwelled in long, for wherever there are traces, one cannot remain for long. *Gou* means \"to see\"; as soon as there are sounds and traces to be seen, calamity and disaster arise from them. Hence it is said, \"The more one sees, the more one demands.\" Borrowing the Way and lodging in righteousness cannot be a long abode—this is the meaning of \"transforming when one goes too far.\"\n\n*Goujian* means \"careless and provisional,\" speaking of adapting to the times to make provision easy. *Bu dai* is like the common saying \"not losing one’s capital\"—easy to nourish, easy to suffice. \"No expenditure\" means no exertion, no cost to oneself. \"Gathering the genuine\" means gathering the truth of reality.\n\nThose who take wealth as right cannot yield emolument; those who take prominence as right cannot yield fame. Those who cling to power cannot share authority. When they grasp it, they tremble; when they relinquish it, they grieve—and in all this, they have nothing to reflect upon, gazing ceaselessly at what they cannot cease pursuing. These are the people Heaven punishes. This is precisely the meaning of the greedy man dying for wealth, the ardent man dying for fame, and the boaster dying for power. Grasping it, they fear loss and tremble; relinquishing it, they are deluded and grieve—all three are the same, having nothing to reflect upon. *Gaze* means to peer; *what they cannot cease* means being deluded and unable to return. With no clarity in their hearts, they cannot turn back to see their delusion—these are the people from whom Heaven has seized their spirit. \"The people Heaven punishes\" means Heaven afflicts them with this suffering.\n\nResentment and gratitude, taking and giving, admonition and instruction, life and death—these eight are the instruments of rectification. Only those who follow great change without obstruction can wield them. Thus it is said, \"Rectification is rectification.\" If one’s heart deems it otherwise, the Gate of Heaven will not open.\n\nBetween ruler and minister, it is called *admonition*; between teacher and friend, it is called *instruction*. Where there are human relationships, there is the use of these eight instruments. Instruments are for use; using what ought to be used is called *rectification*. Only those without self-will can employ them, following great change and conforming to creation without obstruction. If I can follow creation without obstruction, then what is within me is rectified, and only then can I rectify others. If I have not yet attained the absence of self-will and deem the principle of spontaneity otherwise, then the Heaven within my breast is already darkened and blocked. Hence it is said, \"The Gate of Heaven does not open.\" The *Book of Songs* says, \"Heaven guides the people\"—this is the meaning of the Gate of Heaven.\n\nWhen Confucius visited Lao Dan and spoke of benevolence and righteousness, Lao Dan said: \"If chaff gets in one’s eyes, the heavens and earth and the four directions shift places. If mosquitoes and gnats bite the skin, one cannot sleep through the night. Now, benevolence and righteousness are so violently intrusive—they madden my heart and cause the greatest disorder. If you, sir, would let the world not lose its simplicity, you too could drift with the wind, move with virtue, and stand firm. Why then do you act so strenuously, as if beating a drum to seek a lost child?\" *Biting the skin* and *chaff in the eyes* are metaphors for partiality and heart-inversion. *Formerly* means \"night.\" The *Zuozhuan* says, \"At rest, one prepares for a night’s vigil.\" *Violently intrusive* describes the state of poison. It speaks of self-inflicted suffering. \"Maddening my heart\" means \"inverting my heart.\"",

      "translated_text": "The disorder could not be greater—this speaks of self-disruption of one’s nature. To *drift with the wind* is to follow transformation. Moving in accord with transformation is thus called \"drifting with the wind and moving.\" *Standing firm* means holding fast to virtue. If the world did not lose its original simplicity, all would follow transformation, hold fast to virtue, and stand firm—what need would there be for teaching? King Jian struck the road-drum at his chamber gate—the *road-drum* refers to the drum that was set up. Summoning the people of the world to instruct them is like carrying a great drum to seek a lost child. *Jieran* describes a self-aggrandizing demeanor.\n\nNow, the swan does not bathe daily to become white, nor does the crow dye itself daily to become black. The simplicity of black and white is not sufficient to serve as a distinction; the spectacle of fame and reputation is not sufficient to broaden one’s mind. When a spring dries up, fish find themselves together on dry land, where they moisten one another with breath and wet one another with foam—yet this is not as good as forgetting one another in the rivers and lakes. The whiteness of the swan and the blackness of the crow arise naturally and of themselves, requiring neither bathing nor dyeing. These two metaphors are most apt. *Qian* means to dye black. *The simplicity of black and white* means that black and white each possess their natural qualities, neither beautiful nor ugly, and thus not worth debating. To display them to the world through fame and reputation is to invite judgments of right and wrong. Where there is praise, there is blame—this narrows the heart. This is the metaphor of black and white, right and wrong.\n\nAs for the fish, how long can their mutual moistening last? If they dwelled in rivers and lakes, they would forget one another in the water. In an age of the Perfect Dao, each follows nature, and there is no right or wrong—thus, above and below forget one another as well.\n\nWhen Confucius saw Lao Dan, he returned home and did not speak for three days. His disciples asked, \"Master, when you saw Lao Dan, what counsel did you seek?\" Confucius said, \"Only now have I beheld the dragon! The dragon coalesces to form its body and disperses to display its patterns; it rides the clouds and qi, nourishing itself on yin and yang. My mouth gaped open, yet I could not close it—what counsel could I seek from Lao Dan?\" *Counsel* means admonition. *Coalesces to form its body* describes its undifferentiated wholeness. *Disperses to display its patterns* describes its radiant manifestation. The dragon, existing between heaven and earth, is visible yet not visible—hence the metaphors of dispersion and coalescence. *Rides the clouds and qi* means it dwells above the workings of creation. *Nourishing itself on yin and yang* means it delights in the Dao of heaven and earth. *Could not close it* means his mouth gaped open without meeting, leaving no room for words.\n\nZigong said, \"Then are there indeed men who dwell like corpses yet manifest the dragon’s presence, who thunder like storms yet remain as silent as the abyss, whose movements are like those of heaven and earth? May I, Ci, also behold such a one?\" Thereupon, he went to see Lao Dan, announcing himself in Confucius’ name. Lao Dan was just then reclining in the hall and responded faintly, \"My years have advanced and departed—what would you warn me of?\"\n\nZigong said, \"The Three Kings and Five Emperors governed the world differently, yet all were bound together by fame and reputation. Why then do you alone deem them not sages?\" Lao Dan said, \"Young man, come forward. Why do you say they governed differently?\" Zigong replied, \"Yao ceded to Shun, Shun ceded to Yu, Yu exerted effort, Tang employed force, King Wen submitted to Zhou and dared not oppose him, and King Wu opposed Zhou and would not submit—thus I say they were different.\"\n\nLao Dan said, \"Young man, come forward. Let me tell you of the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. The Yellow Emperor governed the world by unifying the people’s hearts. When a man’s parent died, he did not weep, yet none among the people condemned him. Yao governed the world by fostering kinship in the people’s hearts. When a man killed for his parent, none among the people condemned him. Shun governed the world by inciting competition in the people’s hearts. Pregnant women gave birth in ten months, and their children could speak at five months. Before they could even babble, they began to ask one another’s names—thus people began to die young. Yu governed the world by altering the people’s hearts. Men had hearts, and weapons had their proper use. Killing thieves was not considered killing people, but rather a matter of sowing seeds for the world. Thus, the world was greatly alarmed, and the Ru and Mo schools arose. From their beginnings, they established order, yet now—what can women say? I was announced in Confucius’ name, as a disciple of the Master paying a formal visit.\" *Reclining in the hall* means he sat in the hall with an air of arrogance, as if disdaining others. *Responded faintly* means their exchange was barely audible.\n\nThe governance of the Yellow Emperor accorded with nature. The following passage—though similar ideas appear repeatedly in earlier sections—adds several lines here that are quite extraordinary. Mourning garments were graded according to the closeness of kinship, hence the saying, \"for their parent, they killed; for the killed, they mourned.\" This suggests that in ancient times, there were no mourning rites, and only later were they instituted. In ancient times, children were born after fourteen months and did not speak until two years old. To be born in ten months and speak at five months is to be precocious. *Who* means to ask.",

Why then do you act so strenuously, as if beating a drum to seek a lost child?\" *Biting the skin* and *chaff in the eyes* are metaphors for partiality and heart-inversion. *Formerly* means \"night.\" The *Zuozhuan* says, \"At rest, one prepares for a night’s vigil.\" *Violently intrusive* describes the state of poison. It speaks of self-inflicted suffering. \"Maddening my heart\" means \"inverting my heart.\"",

      "translated_text": "Before reaching the age of childhood, they could already ask others, \"Who is this?\"—this is what is meant by *early*. *Who* refers to asking about someone’s identity.\n\nThis caused the people’s hearts to change from those of ancient times. Every person has a heart, and each heart harbors its own private concerns. Warfare was considered a proper affair, and those who turned to banditry were killed without being deemed guilty—the laws and prohibitions were detailed.\n\nAt that time, people all regarded themselves as distinct lineages, each loving their own kin and cherishing their own children. Yet they still shared this world together, hence the saying, \"and so the world was.\" The beginnings of their actions had order, for in those early days of creation, the principles of human relations still endured. But now, their corruption has led to the violation of ethical norms, even taking women as wives—what more can be said? This is to say, it is intolerable.\n\nThe *Record of Rites* states, \"When the Great Dao prevails, all is shared in common,\" and this passage also carries a similar meaning, though Zhuangzi’s criticism is far more severe. Let me tell you: the governance of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors was called \"orderly,\" yet no disorder was greater than theirs. The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns:\n- Above, it contradicted the brilliance of the sun and moon;\n- Below, it clashed with the essence of mountains and rivers;\n- In between, it disrupted the operations of the four seasons.\n\nTheir knowledge was as venomous as the sting of a scorpion or the bite of a small beast—none could preserve the true nature of their lives. And yet they still considered themselves sages. Is this not shameful? Truly, they were without shame.\n\nZigong stood uneasily, shifting from foot to foot. The wisdom of the Three Sovereigns also defied the principles of Heaven and Earth’s creation. Earlier passages often exalted the Three Sovereigns while disparaging the Five Emperors, but here, even the Three Sovereigns are rebuked. *Scorpions* are wasps with venomous tails, and *few* means rare. *Seeking* refers to small beasts, whose desires are as limited as those of foxes. This is to say, such cunning is as poisonous as these tiny creatures—mere insects and beasts—and thus they are mocked and belittled. *Shifting uneasily* describes Zigong’s restless demeanor.\n\nConfucius said to Laozi: \"I have studied the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, *Rites*, *Music*, *Book of Changes*, and *Spring and Autumn Annals*—the Six Classics—for a long time, and I thought I understood their origins. Yet I have served seventy-two rulers, expounding the Dao of the former kings and clarifying the deeds of the Zhou and Shao, but not a single ruler has put them into practice. How difficult it is to persuade people! How hard it is to make the Dao clear!\"\n\nLaozi replied: \"Fortunate indeed that you have not encountered a ruler of a well-ordered age! The Six Classics are but the traces left by the former kings—how could they be the essence of those traces? What you speak of are merely traces. Traces are what the shoe leaves behind, but are traces the shoe itself?\"\n\nThe *Record of Rites* also records Laozi addressing the sage by name. When Confucius sought to study the rites under Laozi, who could have known their origins? *Hook* means to draw out. *Fortunate not to have encountered* implies that had an ancient sage been present, he would have laughed at you. Where there is a shoe, there is a trace; to grasp the trace but not the shoe is like the parable of the dregs.\n\nThe white egrets gaze at each other, their pupils unmoving, and the wind transforms them. The male insect cries on the upper wind, and the female responds on the lower wind, and the wind transforms them. They form their own pairs as male and female, for the transformations of nature cannot be altered, fate cannot be changed, time cannot be halted, and the Dao cannot be obstructed. If one attains the Dao, there is nothing that cannot be done, and nothing that can be lost.\n\nConfucius did not emerge for three months before returning to say: \"I have grasped it! Crows and magpies mate, fish spawn in foam, and wasps have slender waists—all transform. If even younger brothers weep for their elder brothers, how long has it been? I, Qiu, have not transformed with others, nor have others transformed with me. How can I transform others?\"\n\nLaozi said: \"Good! You have grasped it!\"\n\nThis is one of the most extraordinary passages in the text. The male and female of the white egret do not mate but produce offspring merely by gazing at each other. All things are born of the wind and qi, for the character *wind* (風) contains *insect* (虫), implying the generation of life—hence *wind-transformation*, meaning reproduction.\n\n*Crying on the upper wind and responding on the lower wind* refers to their positions above and below. The Yellow Emperor followed the lower wind, which is similar to this. Here, *wind* differs from *wind-transformation*. *Forming their own pairs* means that male and female exist naturally within all things, enabling such transformations. The transformation of the ichneumon wasp into the potter wasp is not like this, for it relies on incantations, whereas this transformation occurs through mutual gaze.\n\nNature, fate, time, and the Dao all refer to the principles of spontaneity, which cannot be violated. Crows and magpies mate, fish spawn in foam, and wasps with slender waists transform. *Transform* means to give birth.",

      "translated_text": "Brothers share the same mother, yet when a younger brother is born, the elder weeps—only after the elder is weaned does the younger arrive. Thus, the elder weeps because he can no longer nurse. This passage is especially marvelous. Many such instances appear in Buddhist scriptures, for they exhaust the subtleties of literary art. These are all essential to understand.\n\nThose who speak of \"transformation into humans\" refer to knowing humanity but not Heaven, unable to unite with the workings of creation. This chapter uses the principle of creation’s ceaseless generation to illustrate the Dao of spontaneity. It suggests that what Confucians study are all acts of deliberate effort, not acts of non-effort. Acts of non-effort, however, align with the workings of creation.\n\nThe Buddhist scriptures speak of birth from the womb, from eggs, from transformation, and from moisture—such joy must derive from this. Their intent, however, is to make people realize that this body arises from nothingness and is the same as all things, thereby breaking the worldly mind of self-attachment and self-love. This differs from the present discussion.\n\n**Chapter Fifteen: Carving Intentions**\n\nCarving intentions and esteeming conduct, departing from the world and differing from common customs, uttering lofty theories and resentful critiques—these are but acts of defiance. Such are the preferences of mountain-valley scholars, those who reject the world, the withered and emaciated, those who plunge into the abyss.\n\nSpeaking of benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, trust, reverence, frugality, and deference—these are but cultivated virtues. Such are the preferences of scholars in peaceful times, teachers and instructors, those who wander and dwell in study.\n\nSpeaking of great achievements, establishing great names, observing ritual between ruler and subject, rectifying superior and inferior—these are but acts of governance. Such are the preferences of court officials, those who honor their lord and strengthen the state, those who achieve merit and annex territory.\n\nRetreating to marshes and wilds, dwelling in seclusion, fishing and living idly—these are but acts of non-action. Such are the preferences of rivers-and-seas scholars, recluses, those who seek leisure.\n\nBreathing deeply, exhaling the old and inhaling the new, imitating the bear’s climbing and the bird’s stretching—these are but means to longevity. Such are the preferences of practitioners of Daoist arts, those who nurture the body, those who, like Peng Zu, seek long life.\n\nYet if one does not carve intentions yet remains lofty, does not practice benevolence and righteousness yet is cultivated, does not establish merit and fame yet governs, does not retreat to rivers and seas yet is at leisure, does not practice Daoist arts yet lives long—then nothing is forgotten, and nothing is lacking. Serene and boundless, all virtues follow. This is the Dao of Heaven and Earth, the virtue of the sage.\n\n*Carving* means meticulous crafting, laboring with intent, esteeming conduct. *Defiance* means loftiness, resentment toward the world, indignation at corruption. *Rejecting the world* means criticizing worldly affairs. *Withered and emaciated* means desolate and still. *Plunging into the abyss* means seeking profound tranquility—like the saying, \"Entering the forest, one fears it is not secluded enough; entering the mountains, one fears they are not deep enough.\" *Cultivated* means refined and pure. *Teachers and instructors* are those who guide the world. *Achieving merit and annexing territory* are observations from Zhuangzi’s time. *Rivers-and-seas scholars* are recluses, those who escape the world and transcend right and wrong, differing from those who defy the world. *Bear climbing and bird stretching* refer to Hua Tuo’s \"Five Animal Exercises.\" *Nothing is forgotten, nothing is lacking* means non-action yet nothing left undone. *Boundless* means without fixed limit. *All virtues follow* means possessing all perfections. The sage embodies the spontaneous Dao of Heaven and Earth, hence this state.\n\nThus it is said: \"Serenity, tranquility, stillness, emptiness, non-action—these are the equilibrium of Heaven and Earth, the essence of the Dao and virtue.\" Thus it is said: \"When the sage rests, he is at ease; at ease, he is serene. At ease and serene, worries and troubles cannot enter, and perverse qi cannot assail. Thus his virtue is whole, and his spirit is not diminished.\" This passage is a single continuous text; the many \"thus it is said\" below connect to it. At the end, a metaphor is used, concluding with a rustic saying—one must carefully observe the flow of his brushwork.\n\nThe essence of the Dao and virtue is their inherent nature. *At ease* and *serene* are the meaning of non-action. *Spirit not diminished* means virtue is whole—these three words reveal even greater vitality.\n\nThus it is said: \"The sage’s life is the movement of Heaven; his death is the transformation of things. At rest, he shares virtue with yin; in motion, he flows with yang. He does not precede fortune, nor initiate misfortune. He responds only after being stirred, moves only under compulsion, rises only out of necessity. He discards knowledge and old habits, follows the principle of Heaven. Thus he suffers no heavenly disasters, no burdens from things, no human reproach, no blame from spirits. His life is like floating; his death is like resting. He does not scheme or plan ahead. Radiant yet not dazzling, trustworthy yet not demanding. In sleep, he does not dream; awake, he is free from worry. His spirit is pure; his soul is unwearied. Emptiness, non-action, and serenity—these accord with Heavenly virtue.\"\n\n*Movement of Heaven* means following Heaven’s principle. *Transformation of things* means viewing the body like a cast-off husk. *Flowing with yang* means moving with the current. Responding only after being stirred means having no preconceived intent, thus transcending fortune and misfortune. *Compelled to move, rising out of necessity*—this is the meaning of responding without intent. *Knowledge* means private cleverness; *old habits* means past traces. Discarding private cleverness and leaving past traces means following spontaneity. *Like floating, like resting*—this is the sense of drifting without attachment. *Not scheming or planning ahead*—this is the meaning of \"What thought? What worry?\" *Radiant yet not dazzling*—this is self-effacement. *Trustworthy yet not demanding*—this means not imposing on others. His spirit is whole, hence pure; his soul is still, hence not wearied. *Wearied* is the same as *fatigued*.\n\nThus it is said: \"Sorrow and joy are deviations from virtue; delight and anger are transgressions of the Dao; likes and dislikes are losses of virtue. Thus, a heart free from sorrow and joy is the perfection of virtue; unity without change is the perfection of stillness; encountering nothing contrary is the perfection of emptiness; not engaging with things is the perfection of serenity; having no opposition is the perfection of purity. If one has sorrow and joy, delight and anger, likes and dislikes, this is not spontaneity. Worries and joys not tied to the heart—this is the perfection of virtue. *Unity without change*—this is focusing the mind without distraction. *Encountering nothing contrary*—this is following spontaneity. *Contrary* means opposition; *opposition* is slightly shallower than *contrary*, hence two phrases are used. *Purity*—this means without flaw.\"\n\nThus it is said: \"When the body labors without rest, it becomes worn; when essence is used without cease, it becomes exhausted. Exhaustion leads to depletion. Water’s nature is pure when unadulterated, clear when undisturbed. If obstructed and not flowing, it cannot remain clear—this is the image of Heavenly virtue. Thus it is said: *Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, serene and non-active, moving in accord with Heaven*—this is the way to nurture the spirit.\"\n\n*Body laboring* leads to wear; *essence used* leads to exhaustion—these are practical words from those who nurture life, echoing the earlier passage, \"Do not shake your essence, and you may live long.\"",

      "translated_text": "Labor without cease must lead to depletion—thus it is said: *labor leads to depletion.* The analogy of water, though seemingly commonplace, reveals that when obstructed and not flowing, it cannot remain clear—yet this does not reduce it to the state of withered wood or dead ashes. *Unadulterated, it is clear; undisturbed, it is level*—this is non-action. *Not flowing, it cannot remain clear*—within non-action, there is action. As Xiangyan said, \"You cannot simply call it idle sitting.\" Obstructed and not flowing—this is what Chan masters condemn as \"sitting in a ghost cave,\" the so-called silent illumination heterodoxy. Yet the movement of Heaven—does it not complete a circuit each day? Is this not the *non-action within action*? Thus it is called the image of Heavenly virtue.\n\nTo nurture the spirit is to nurture life; lifting the word *spirit* makes it more intimate—this is the learning of the Daoists. The Buddhists, however, refuse to speak of this *spirit*, as when they say, \"From beginningless time, the cycle of birth and death is the delusion of calling the original body one’s own\"—this is their way of denouncing such a notion of *spirit*. Consider the sword of Gan and Yue: it is cased and stored, never dared to be used—such is its preciousness. Yet the spirit reaches in all four directions, flowing without limit, ascending to Heaven above, coiling through Earth below, transforming and nourishing the myriad things, leaving no trace to be perceived. Its name is called *co-equal with the Emperor*. The Way of pure simplicity guards only the spirit, preserving it without loss, merging with the spirit as one. When the spirit is perfectly refined, it harmonizes with the heavenly order.\n\nTo treasure the sword is to case and store it—how much more so the spirit? This is the analogy of *using the essence leads to labor*. *Reaching in all four directions, flowing without bound, coiling below, ascending above*—such is the function of the spirit. *Transforming and nourishing the myriad things*—this, too, is the spirit. Yet no visible trace remains, hence it is said: *no image can be made of it*. *Co-equal with the Emperor* means its function is the same as the Heavenly Emperor. Those who practice the Way of pure simplicity begin by guarding only the spirit, preserving it without loss. Through long cultivation, they merge with the spirit as one—this is the time of *great transformation*. Before transformation, one remains two with the Dao; after transformation, one is one with the Dao.\n\n*The heavenly order* is the heavenly principle. When refined to the point of perfect communion, one merges with Heaven—this is what is called *the spirit, sacred and unknowable*. This chapter aligns closely with my own writings, yet by emphasizing agitation and change, it veers into heterodoxy.\n\nA rustic saying goes: \"The common people value profit, the upright value reputation, the worthy esteem aspiration, and the sage treasures essence.\" Thus, *simplicity* means having nothing mixed in; *purity* means not scattering one’s spirit. One who embodies pure simplicity is called a *Perfected Person*. The rustic saying—words from the fields, like village talk—contrasts profit, reputation, and aspiration with *essence*. *Simplicity* is undyed silk, hence *nothing mixed in*; *purity* is undivided wholeness, hence *not scattering*. Pure simplicity is the *purity and essence* of the sword of Gan. The *Perfected Person* is the *Ultimate Person*. Earlier, it spoke of the *virtue of the sage*; here, it speaks of the *Perfected Person*—just as in the Inner Chapters, where the *Ultimate Person* is without self and the *Spiritual Person* is without name. These are merely different names for the sage; it is not that the *Perfected Person* or *Ultimate Person* surpass the sage.\n\n*Carving Intent* speaks of nurturing the spirit and discusses the movement of Heaven and the transformation of things. *Mending Nature* speaks of preserving the body and involves the workings of fate and the errors of conduct. Though divided into two chapters on nurturing the spirit and preserving the body, this distinction lies in the effort of learning. Readers have not carefully investigated this, missing Zhuangzi’s profound intent across the ages.\n\n**Outer Chapters: Mending Nature, Chapter Sixteen**\n\nTo mend one’s nature through vulgar learning is to seek the return to one’s original state; to drown desires in vulgar thoughts is to seek the attainment of clarity—these are the benighted, the people of blocked perception.\n\n*Mending nature* is the cultivation of nature. *Mending nature through vulgar learning* criticizes the Confucian and Mohist discourses on nature of the time. *Original* refers to the natural principle of human nature. *Drowning* means to be submerged. *Drowning desires in the vulgar* means to be submerged in worldly desires. *Clarity* is the principle of empty brightness. To cultivate nature through vulgar learning in order to return to the original human nature, or to be drowned in desires while seeking the state of empty brightness—these are the utterly foolish, the ignorant. *People of blocked perception* is the name given to such vulgar learners. The opening of a text is most difficult; these three opening lines are truly fine writing. Su Dongpo said that reading Zhuangzi taught him the art of writing—only after treading this path does one understand.\n\nThe ancients who cultivated the Dao used tranquility to nurture knowledge, living without employing knowledge—this is called *using knowledge to nurture tranquility*. Knowledge and tranquility mutually nurture each other, and harmony and principle emerge from one’s nature. Virtue is harmony; principle is the Dao. Virtue admits all without exclusion—this is benevolence. The Dao governs all without disorder—this is righteousness. Righteousness is clarity, and things draw near—this is loyalty. The center is pure and solid, returning to emotion—this is joy. Sincerity in conduct, bearing, and compliance with pattern—this is ritual.\n\n*Tranquility* is stillness. Stillness can give rise to wisdom, hence *using tranquility to nurture knowledge*. At the beginning of my life, originally there was nothing—how could knowledge be employed? Only thus can one attain stillness, hence *using knowledge to nurture tranquility*. When the two nurture each other, one obtains the natural principle of one’s nature—this is *harmony and principle*. *Harmony and principle* means *harmonious compliance*. Through stillness, one attains the original harmonious nature, hence *harmony and principle emerge from nature*. *Nature* here is the same as *natural*. *Tranquility nurtures knowledge, knowledge nurtures tranquility*—these six words are most profound. The Buddhists say, \"Precepts give rise to concentration, concentration gives rise to wisdom,\" but they do not say *wisdom gives rise to concentration*. Such passages demand careful reading.\n\n*Virtue is harmony*—this is the Dao and principle. *Admits all without exclusion* means *loves all without exception*. *Governs all without disorder* means *each attains its proper place*. *Righteousness is clarity within*, and thus one can draw things near—this is *exhausting oneself*, called *loyalty*. *Emotion* is what is expressed. With the truth of the center’s purity expressed outwardly, and by returning to the center from what is expressed, this is *joy*—then life arises. Once life arises, how can it cease? Thus it is said: *The center is pure and solid, returning to emotion—this is joy*. *Sincerity* is trustworthiness. *Sincerity in conduct* means *trusting in one’s bearing and actions*, naturally complying with pattern—this is *ritual*. Thus it is said: *Sincerity in conduct, bearing, and compliance with pattern—this is ritual*.\n\n*Trust* is confidence. *Sincerity in conduct* means *acting with confidence*. To seek ritual and music externally without knowing their root is called *partial practice*—as if seeing only half.",

Thus it is said: *Pure and unadulterated, still and unchanging, serene and non-active, moving in accord with Heaven*—this is the way to nurture the spirit.\"\n\n*Body laboring* leads to wear; *essence used* leads to exhaustion—these are practical words from those who nurture life, echoing the earlier passage, \"Do not shake your essence, and you may live long.\"",

      "translated_text": "Obscurity is concealment. When virtue accumulates within oneself yet does not reveal itself, external things naturally align—thus it is said: *\"When others are upright, one’s own virtue is concealed.\"* For when others are upright, things are upright. *\"Not imposing\"* means one does not claim to bestow virtue upon others. If virtue does not conceal itself but seeks to impose upon others, it loses its spontaneity. Thus it is said: *\"To impose is to cause things to lose their nature.\"* Governing the world through goodness is not as effective as nurturing the world through goodness—this is the meaning here.\n\nIn ancient times, people dwelled in primordial chaos, yet lived in harmony with their age in tranquil indifference. At that time, yin and yang were harmonious and still, spirits undisturbed; the four seasons kept their rhythm, all things unharmed, and living beings did not perish prematurely. Though humans possessed knowledge, they had no use for it—this was called *\"perfect unity.\"* In that era, nothing was done, yet all was naturally so. *\"Primordial chaos\"* signifies concealment, not revealing oneself; *\"tranquil indifference\"* means no seeking between above and below. The entire world was pure and whole, lacking nothing in the Dao—thus it was called *\"perfect unity.\"* *\"Nothing was done\"* means no effort was exerted. With spirits undisturbed, the numinous forces of mountains and rivers were all at peace; with the seasons keeping their rhythm, heaven and earth followed their order, and the four seasons unfolded.\n\nWhen virtue declined, Suiren and Fuxi began to act for the world—thus *\"compliance without unity.\"* When virtue declined further, Shennong and the Yellow Emperor began to act for the world—thus *\"stability without compliance.\"* When virtue declined yet again, Yao and Shun began to act for the world, initiating the currents of governance and transformation. The pure and undivided Dao dissolved, and people departed from it, using goodness to navigate peril and virtue to advance conduct. Then they abandoned their nature to follow the heart-mind. Heart-mind vied with heart-mind, discerning and knowing, yet this was insufficient to stabilize the world. Thus they appended culture, expanded knowledge, extinguished simplicity, and drowned the heart-mind in breadth. Only then did the people begin to confuse and disorder, unable to return to their nature and emotions and recover their origin.\n\nThree stages of decline—each marked by strangeness. Once they knew there was a principle to comply with, their purity and unity were already lost. Thus it is said: *\"Compliance without unity.\"* When each took principle as stability, they knew there was a self; knowing there was a self, they departed from the Dao. Thus it is said: *\"Stability without compliance.\"* To deliberately act for the world and promote teachings and transformations was no longer non-action or spontaneity—thus *\"the pure and undivided dissolved.\"* To have the name of goodness was already distant from the Dao; to have visible conduct was no longer the plain and natural virtue. Thus it is said: *\"Departing from the Dao through goodness, endangering virtue through conduct.\"* *\"Endangering\"* means not plain and natural. Abandoning natural nature to follow the heart-mind of deliberate action—thus *\"abandoning nature to follow the heart-mind.\"* When I act with a heart-mind and respond to others with a heart-mind, *\"heart-mind vied with heart-mind\"*—discerning and examining one another. All these *\"heart-mind\"* refer to the conditioned heart-mind. *\"Culture\"* means literary embellishment.",

      "translated_text": "The erudite refers to the abundance of names and things; rites, music, and all affairs are complete. Yet relying on knowledge is insufficient, so one supplements it with rites and music—thus it is said: *\"Knowledge is insufficient to stabilize the world, so one appends culture and expands with erudition.\"* Erudition, vast and multifarious, lacks essentials. To apply the heart-mind to this is like drowning in the depths.\n\nFrom this perspective, the world has lost the Dao, and the Dao has lost the world—they mutually destroy one another. How can the people of the Dao arise in the world? How can the world arise in the Dao? The Dao has no means to arise in the world, nor the world in the Dao. Even if the sage does not dwell in the mountains and forests, his virtue is already concealed. Thus, *\"he does not conceal himself\"*—the Dao and the world mutually destroy one another, meaning the two do not intersect. Since they do not intersect, how can the person of the Dao revitalize the worldly perceptions of the common folk? And how can the common folk come to know the Dao? If the entire world does not know the Dao, then even if the sage stands before them, they will not recognize him. It is not that the sage conceals himself; others do not know him, and he does not seek to hide—thus he conceals himself. Therefore, it is said: *\"Thus, he does not conceal himself.\"* The reason for his concealment is not that the sage deliberately hides himself; he stands before them, yet people do not recognize him—these five characters below are also striking.\n\nThe so-called *\"concealed scholars\"* of antiquity did not crouch their bodies to remain unseen, nor did they seal their words to avoid speaking, nor did they bury their knowledge to refrain from expressing it. The great error lay in the times and fate. If the times and fate were greatly aligned with the world, one would return to unity without a trace; if the times and fate were greatly at odds with the world, one would deeply root and stabilize the utmost, awaiting—this is the way of preserving the self.\n\nFollowing the above *\"conceal\"* character, the text again raises the topic of *\"concealed scholars\"*—concealed scholars do not desire to hide their bodies, seal their words, or bury their knowledge; the times are unfavorable. The ancients who conducted themselves in the world did not adorn their knowledge with eloquence, nor did they exhaust the world with knowledge, nor did they exhaust virtue with knowledge. Serenely abiding in their place, they returned to their nature—what more was there to do? The Dao is not to be practiced in small ways, nor is virtue to be known in small measures. Small knowledge harms virtue; small conduct harms the Dao. Thus, it is said: *\"Rectify oneself and that is all.\"* *\"Joyful wholeness\"* is called *\"attaining one’s will.\"*\n\nFollowing the *\"preserving the self\"* character, the text speaks of *\"conducting oneself\"*—whether in times of non-use or use. The ancients’ so-called *\"attaining one’s will\"* did not refer to carriages and caps; it meant having nothing to add to their joy. Today’s so-called *\"attaining one’s will\"* refers to carriages and caps. Carriages and caps on the body are not one’s nature and destiny; they are things that come and go by chance, lodging temporarily. When they lodge, their coming cannot be resisted, nor their going prevented. Thus, one does not indulge one’s will for carriages and caps, nor does one follow worldly customs in poverty and constraint. Their joy is the same in both cases—thus, there is no sorrow. Now, if the lodging departs and one is not joyful, from this perspective, though there is joy, it is not without dissipation. Therefore, it is said: *\"Those who lose themselves in things and forfeit their nature to customs are called inverted people.\"*\n\nThose content within have no desires without—thus it is said: *\"Having nothing to add to their joy\"* is when *\"all things are complete within me.\"* Turning inward and being sincere, there is no greater joy. Nature and destiny are the heavenly nobility; carriages and caps are external things. They come by chance—thus it is said: *\"by chance.\"* Their coming and going lie with them, not with me—thus it is said: *\"lodging.\"* Knowing that their coming and going cannot be certain, the enlightened are neither indulgent nor constrained—thus it is said: *\"not indulging one’s will for carriages and caps, not following worldly customs in poverty and constraint.\"* *\"Following customs\"* means bending oneself to follow the times.\n\nThat is the Dao. Their joy in the Dao is the same as others’ joy in carriages and caps—thus it is said: *\"their joy is the same in both.\"* Joy lies within me, so there is no time when one can be sorrowful; joy lies in things, so when things depart, joy also departs. Since their joy has coming and going, it is not true joy. Therefore, it is said: *\"though there is joy, it is not without dissipation.\"* *\"Inverted\"* means not knowing the root and branches. The self and nature are the root; things and customs are the branches. Valuing the branches and losing the root—thus it is said: *\"inverted people.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Five\n<*Masters Section, Daoist Category, Zhuangzi Kouyi*>",

      "translated_text": "**Imperially Commissioned *Siku Quanshu*: *Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Six**\n*By Lin Xiangyi of the Song Dynasty*\n*Outer Chapters, \"Autumn Floods\" (Chapter Seventeen)*\n\nWhen the autumn floods came, the hundred rivers poured into the Yellow River. Its rushing currents swelled so vast that between its two banks and the islets along its shores, one could not distinguish ox from horse. Thereupon, the River Lord rejoiced exultantly, believing all the world’s beauty to be contained within himself. Following the current eastward, he arrived at the Northern Sea. Facing east and gazing out, he saw no end to the waters. Only then did the River Lord turn his face, look toward Ruo with an expression of awe, and sigh:\n\n\"There is a rustic saying: *'Hearing the Dao a hundred times, one believes none surpasses oneself.'* That describes me. Moreover, I once heard of those who belittle Confucius’s learning and make light of Boyi’s righteousness—at first, I did not believe it. Now that I behold the boundlessness of your waters, had I not come to your gate, I would have remained in peril, forever ridiculed by those of great attainment.\"\n\n*\"Jing\"* refers to turbidity. When the Yellow River’s waters surge, they churn muddy and fill the banks, hence *\"the vastness of its rushing currents.\"* Here, *\"jing\"* does not mean the Jing or Wei Rivers. *\"Zhu\"* and *\"ya\"* are islets and shores along the river, both terms of equal weight. If *\"ya\"* were glossed as *\"boundary,\"* then the phrase *\"between\"* would not allow for the indistinctness of ox and horse. *\"Not seeing the water’s end\"* means not knowing the source of the waters. *\"Yang\"* is the sea; *\"Ruo\"* is the name of the sea god.\n\nThe ways of the world are myriad, yet one hears only a hundred and takes oneself as peerless. The phrase *\"hearing the Dao a hundred times\"* likely comes from an ancient saying, its intent directed at Confucius and Boyi. Thus, the analogy of rivers and seas is used to illustrate the point.\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: *\"A frog in a well cannot be spoken to of the sea, for it is confined by its dwelling. A summer insect cannot be spoken to of ice, for it is bound by its season. A narrow scholar cannot be spoken to of the Dao, for he is shackled by his teachings. Now that you have emerged from your banks and shores and beheld the great sea, you know your own insignificance—only then can you be spoken to of great principles.*\n\n*The waters of the world are none greater than the sea. The ten thousand rivers flow into it, yet it never fills, though no one knows when they will cease. The Tailuo drains it, yet it never empties, though no one knows when it will end. Unchanged through spring and autumn, unaware of flood or drought—this surpasses the flow of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers beyond measure. Yet I have never taken pride in this, for I compare my form to heaven and earth and receive my qi from yin and yang. Within heaven and earth, I am but a pebble or a twig in a great mountain. Already aware of my own smallness, how could I take pride in myself?\"*\n\n*\"Confined by its dwelling\"* means being limited to one’s abode. *\"Bound by its season\"* means knowing only one time. The *huigui* does not know spring and autumn. *\"Knowing your own insignificance\"* means recognizing one’s shame. *\"Tailuo\"* refers to the *Wojiao*, mentioned in the *Classic of Mountains and Seas*: sea water reaches this point and is instantly dried up. Comparing the sea to heaven and earth, one sees only its smallness—how could one know its vastness? This is what Chan masters mean by *\"to bear the great, one must begin from the ground; even if one rises higher, there is still heaven above.\"* This is the idea here.\n\n*\"Consider the four seas within heaven and earth—are they not like a tiny crevice in a great marsh? Consider the Central States within the seas—are they not like a grain of millet in a granary? The number of things is called 'ten thousand,' yet humans occupy but one among them. The nine provinces produce grain, and boats and carts traverse them—yet humans occupy but one among them. Compared to the ten thousand things, are they not like the tip of a hair on a horse’s body?*\n\n*The Five Emperors’ succession, the Three Kings’ struggles, the benevolent men’s worries, the burdened scholars’ labors—all are encompassed herein. Boyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his erudition. Were their self-satisfaction not like your earlier pride in your waters?\"*\n\n*\"Leikong\"* is a small hole, like a beehive’s cell. *\"People in multitudes\"* refers to the masses. Among the ten thousand things, humans are but one kind. This is discussed in relation to the vastness of the void, where all that can be named is considered. Within the nine provinces, humans are but one species among grasses, trees, birds, and beasts. These two lines are exquisitely phrased. As Le Xuan says: *\"Though heaven and earth are vast, the human body is small—a fist-sized stone in the void makes for a splendid journey.\"* This is the idea here. The world’s smallness is thus. The knowledge and abilities of the Five Emperors, Three Kings, and the myriad sages and worthies do not exceed this. Though such words are vast and profound, they are also reasonable.\n\nBoyi renounced it to gain fame; Confucius discoursed on it to display his breadth. Who before has spoken thus? *\"Burdened scholars\"* refers to those who take up worldly affairs.\n\nThe River Lord said: *\"Then may I consider heaven and earth great and the tip of a hair small?\"*\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: *\"No. The measure of things is boundless, time has no end, divisions are not constant, and beginnings and ends have no fixed origin. Therefore, those of great wisdom observe both far and near, so the small is not deemed few nor the great many. Knowing the measure is boundless, they verify past and present—thus, what is distant does not vex them, nor what is near make them strain. Knowing time has no end, they discern the cycles of fullness and emptiness—thus, they do not rejoice in gain nor grieve in loss, knowing divisions are not constant. Understanding the level path, they are not delighted by life nor distressed by death, knowing beginnings and ends cannot be fixed.*\n\n*Consider: what humans know is less than what they do not know; the time of their lives is less than the time before they were born. To seek the boundless with the infinitesimal is to become lost and unable to attain mastery. From this perspective, how can one know the tip of a hair suffices to define the finest limit? How can one know heaven and earth suffice to exhaust the greatest realm?\"*\n\nThis turn of phrase is excellent. Earlier, it spoke of greatness; here, it speaks of neither small nor great—this is what is meant by *\"nothing in the world is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, yet Mount Tai is small.\"*\n\n*\"The measure of things is boundless\"* means things cannot be measured. *\"Time has no end\"* means cold and heat, day and night follow one another without cease. *\"Divisions are not constant\"* means the divisions of gain and loss, being and non-being, may come first or last without fixed order. *\"Beginnings and ends have no fixed origin\"* means there is no end, no beginning, no new, no old.\n\n*\"Therefore, those of great wisdom\"* refers to those of great understanding, who possess the four kinds of knowledge below. *\"Observing far as near\"* means not considering size as a matter of quantity, thereby knowing the measure is boundless. *\"Verifying past\"* means examining and clarifying. *\"Present\"* refers to ancient and modern. Understanding that past and present are one, they are not troubled by what is distant nor strain for what is near. Waiting, they know time has no fixed end. *\"Discerning the cycles of fullness and emptiness\"* means not rejoicing in gain nor grieving in loss, knowing divisions are not constant. *\"Understanding the level path\"* means not delighting in life nor lamenting death, knowing beginnings and ends cannot be fixed.",
      "overlap_context": " be sorrowful; joy lies in things, so when things depart, joy also departs. Since their joy has coming and going, it is not true joy. Therefore, it is said: *\"though there is joy, it is not without dissipation.\"* *\"Inverted\"* means not knowing the root and branches. The self and nature are the root; things and customs are the branches. Valuing the branches and losing the root—thus it is said: *\"inverted people.\"*\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Five\n<*Masters Section, Daoist Category, Zhuangzi Kouyi*>",

      "translated_text": "The full is gain, the empty is loss. Fullness and emptiness wax and wane in step with time—without delighting in this or resenting that, one then knows that divisions are not constant.\n\n*\"Understanding the level path\"*—this is to say, recognizing the *right Dao*. Following the *right Dao*, one accepts life and death as they come, neither rejoicing in longevity nor lamenting early death. Cultivating the self and awaiting what comes, the meaning is clear: thus one knows that the end is no different from the beginning, and the end cannot be taken as fixed.\n\nThis is the principle of *\"tracing beginnings to grasp ends\"*—what man knows is man; what he does not know is Heaven. For instance, after birth, I know myself; but how can I know what I was before birth? This is the Chan saying: *\"the single phrase of the Dao before father and mother were born.\"* The smallest is the self; the greatest is Heaven. For the self, so small, to seek to fathom Heaven, so great—no wonder one becomes confused and discontent. In Chan, these few words would constitute a great *gong'an*.\n\nZhuangzi treats it all as a matter of course. What follows *\"those of great wisdom\"* is an explanation of the preceding lines. The phrasing expands and contracts, long and short alternating without uniformity—this is the art of composition. The *ni* is the finest edge; the *yu* is the bounded realm. Speaking of the small, there is no limit to its fineness; speaking of the great, there is no end to its vastness. Hence the question: how can one determine the finest *ni*? How can one exhaust the greatest *yu*?\n\nThe River Earl said: \"Those who discuss the world all say that the most refined is formless, and the greatest cannot be encompassed—is this a true reflection of reality?\"\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: \"From the perspective of the small, the great cannot be fully seen; from the perspective of the great, the small cannot be clearly discerned. The refined and minute is the subtlest of the small; the vast and abundant is the grandest of the great. Thus, they differ in their conditions—this is the nature of their existence.\n\nThe fine and coarse are limited to what has form. What is formless cannot be divided by numbers; what cannot be encompassed cannot be exhausted by numbers. What can be expressed in words is the coarse aspect of things; what can be grasped by the mind is the refined aspect. What cannot be expressed in words nor grasped by the mind does not fall into the categories of refined or coarse.\n\nThis turn of phrase is excellent: the most refined is formless—this is the finest. It does not say 'the smallest' but 'the most refined,' for these are the living points of the text. *'A true reflection of reality'* means: is this statement truly so? From the perspective of the small, the great cannot be fully seen—this is like gazing at the heavens through a tube. From the perspective of the great, the small cannot be clearly discerned—this is like the roc bird looking down at the wild horses and dust motes.\n\nThe subtlest of the small is called *jing*—speaking of the small, yet even smaller. The grandest of the great is called *fu*—speaking of the great, yet even greater. *Yin* means abundant. *Yi bian* means differing in suitability. These two phrases arise from the contrast between small and great.\n\nThe most refined and formless of the small cannot be divided by numbers—whether in hairs or wisps, it is not possible. The greatest, which cannot be encompassed, cannot be exhausted by numbers—whether in *zi* or *zhao*, it is not possible. All things, whether refined or coarse, are confined to form; thus, they can be discussed in words and inferred by the mind. But if the small and the great are both formless, then words cannot express them, and the mind cannot fathom them. Since they are formless, they cannot be spoken of in terms of refined or coarse. Hence, it is said: they do not fall into the categories of refined or coarse.\n\nTherefore, the conduct of the *great person* does not involve harming others, nor does it excessively display benevolence and kindness. Their actions are not motivated by profit, nor do they despise those who serve as gatekeepers or laborers for gain. They do not contend over wealth, nor do they excessively practice deference. In affairs, they do not rely on others, nor do they overindulge in their own strength. They do not despise the greedy and corrupt, and their conduct differs from the common. They do not excessively avoid eccentricity, and they follow the crowd without despising flatterers and sycophants.\n\nThe honors and emoluments of the world are insufficient to encourage them; punishments and shame are insufficient to humiliate them. They know that right and wrong cannot be divided, and that the fine and the great cannot be determined. It is said: the *Dao*-person does not strive; the one of utmost virtue does not attain; the great person does not exhaust the utmost of restraint and division.\n\nThough they do not harm things, neither do they take loving things as their ability. Hence, it is said: *\"does not involve harming others, nor excessively displays benevolence and kindness.\"* The gatekeeper seeks profit through lowly service—though one may say, *\"even if it were holding a whip, I would do it,\"* they do not seek profit, nor do they consider lowly service for profit as wrong. Hence, it is said: *\"their actions are not motivated by profit, nor do they despise those who serve as gatekeepers or laborers for gain.\"*\n\nThey do not contend over wealth, nor do they take deference as their ability. Hence, it is said: *\"they do not contend over wealth, nor do they excessively practice deference.\"* For if one takes deference as their ability, they approach fame.\n\nIn all affairs, they act on their own without relying on others, yet they do not exhaust their strength to sustain themselves. Hence, it is said: *\"in affairs, they do not rely on others, nor do they overindulge in their own strength.\"* To say *\"not overindulging in their own strength\"* means they do not dare to use it to the fullest.\n\nThey do not despise the greedy and corrupt—*\"you are you, I am I.\"* Hence, it is said: *\"they do not despise the greedy and corrupt; their conduct differs from the common.\"* They do not create boundaries of eccentricity for themselves. Hence, it is said: *\"they do not excessively avoid eccentricity.\"* *Pi* means remote; *pi yi* means eccentric and self-isolating.\n\n*\"Following the crowd\"* means blending in and harmonizing with the world. They do not despise flatterers and sycophants—*\"being at ease with them\"*—for they cannot be tainted by such associations. *\"Not despising\"* means not disdaining them.\n\nSuch a person, without divisions of right and wrong, merges the fine and the great—this is the *Dao*-person, the one of utmost virtue, the great person.",

      "translated_text": "They do not hear of \"namelessness\"—they neither gain nor lose, neither obtain nor forfeit. *\"Restricting one’s portion\"* means guarding the utmost principle within the most restrained bounds while fulfilling one’s allotted role. *\"I have heard\"* refers to an ancient saying. *\"Restricting one’s portion\"* is simply another way of saying *\"fulfilling one’s allotment\"*—merely a change of words.\n\nThe River Lord said: *\"Beyond things, within things—where does one draw the line between noble and base? Where does one draw the line between small and great?\"* The Lord of the Northern Sea replied: *\"From the perspective of the Dao, things have no nobility or baseness. From the perspective of things themselves, each deems itself noble and others base. From the perspective of custom, nobility and baseness lie not in oneself. From the perspective of differentiation, if one magnifies what is great in a thing, then nothing in the world is not great; if one diminishes what is small in a thing, then nothing in the world is not small. Knowing that heaven and earth are but a grain of millet, and that the tip of a hair is a mountain, one perceives the gradations of difference. From the perspective of function, if one affirms what a thing possesses, then nothing in the world is without it; if one negates what a thing lacks, then nothing in the world possesses it. Knowing that east and west are opposites yet indispensable to each other, one sees the boundaries of function as fixed. From the perspective of inclination, if one affirms what a thing affirms, then nothing in the world is not affirmed; if one negates what a thing negates, then nothing in the world is not negated. Knowing that Yao and Jie each followed their own nature yet opposed each other, one perceives the distinctions of inclination.*\n\nThe earlier statement—*\"not despising the lowly, not despising the greedy and corrupt\"*—shifts here to another turn, adding the pairing of *\"noble and base\"* with *\"small and great.\"* *\"Beyond things, within things\"* means considering both the internal and external aspects of things. *\"Utmost\"* means the extreme. *\"Where does one draw the line?\"*—what is the limit? Seeking the boundary between noble and base, between small and great—where does one exhaust their principle? From the perspective of things themselves, each deems itself noble and others base—like a rooster prizing its spur or a pig its tusk, or valuing the times when one becomes an emperor.

      "translated_text": "This phrase is most aptly placed: *\"Noble and base do not reside in oneself\"*—it conveys the idea that rank and eminence are but transient lodgings. *\"Gradation\"* means hierarchy. Heaven and earth are but a millet grain or a hair’s tip compared to Mount Tai—how can their hierarchical measures be spoken of? Their gradations are plain to see.\n\n*\"Merit division\"* refers to the boundaries of merit and labor. Each fulfills a role to contribute merit, hence *\"merit division.\"* Farmers, merchants, artisans, and traders each exert their strength according to their station; the world cannot lack a single one, just as east, west, south, and north, though opposite, cannot do without one another.\n\n*\"Inclinations and integrity\"* refer to the direction of one’s aspirations and the steadfastness of one’s will. To deem Yao right and Jie wrong is the natural course of such inclinations. Yet if none were ever deposed, how could a ruler rise? Observing this, the instability of such inclinations becomes clear.\n\n*\"Following their size, following their presence or absence, following their rightness or wrongness\"*—this is the meaning of *\"equalizing things by following their affirmations.\"*\n\nIn ancient times, Yao and Shun abdicated and were enthroned; Kuai abdicated and perished. Tang and Wu contended and became kings; Duke Bo contended and was destroyed. From this, we see that the rites of contention and abdication, the conduct of Yao and Jie, the noble and the base—these are all matters of circumstance and cannot be taken as constant.\n\nComparing Yao and Shun with Kuai, Tang and Wu with Duke Bo, these are impassioned arguments of their time, filled with such examples. Yet one may simply observe the flow of the text.\n\nA roof beam can batter a city wall but cannot plug a mouse hole—this speaks of different tools. A fine steed like Qiji or Hualiu can gallop a thousand *li* in a day, yet cannot match a wildcat or weasel in catching rats—this speaks of different skills. The owl snatches fleas at night, discerning the finest details, yet by day it stares blankly and cannot see a mountain—this speaks of different natures.\n\nThus, it is said: *\"If one takes this as the teacher and nothing as wrong, takes this as order and nothing as chaos\"*—this is the view of one who does not understand the principles of heaven and earth or the conditions of the myriad things. It is like taking heaven as the teacher without earth, or yin as the teacher without yang—its impracticability is evident. Yet those who persist in such talk without ceasing are either fools or deceivers.\n\nThe abdications of the Five Emperors differed; the successions of the Three Dynasties varied. Those who defy their times and customs are called usurpers; those who align with their times and customs are called righteous successors. O River Lord, how do you know the gates of noble and base or the households of small and great?\n\n*\"Liang\"* means beam; *\"li\"* is pronounced as *li*, meaning the ridgepole of a house. Each has its use, hence *\"different tools.\"* Qiji and the wildcat each have their abilities, hence *\"different skills.\"* The owl is also called the *xiao*, a kind of owl. By night its eyes are sharp, but by day it is blind—its nature differs. Right and wrong, order and chaos cannot do without one another; these are necessities of the human world. Thus, the analogy of different tools, skills, and natures is used. Heaven and earth, yin and yang are likewise analogized as indispensable to one another.\n\n*\"Usurpers and righteous successors\"*—this is the same discourse as that on Yao and Jie.\n\nThe River Lord said: *\"Then what should I do? What should I not do?\"*",
      "overlap_context": " the line?\"*—what is the limit? Seeking the boundary between noble and base, between small and great—where does one exhaust their principle? From the perspective of things themselves, each deems itself noble and others base—like a rooster prizing its spur or a pig its tusk, or valuing the times when one becomes an emperor. What is not seen in oneself is recognized in others. The hundred limbs and nine orifices all exist together—do they not take turns as ruler and subject? This is the same idea.",

      "translated_text": "With my words of acceptance and rejection, my choices of pursuit and abandonment—how shall I ultimately proceed?\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: *\"Viewed through the Dao, what is noble? What is base? This is called 'returning to abundance'—unfettered, the will aligns with the Dao in its vast obstruction. What is little? What is much? This is called 'declining bestowal'—without clinging to one, the conduct harmonizes with the Dao without discord. How solemn! Like a state with its ruler, it grants no private virtue. How reverent! Like a sacrifice with its altar, it confers no private blessing. Vast and boundless, like the four directions without end, it has no demarcations. Embracing the ten thousand things, which could bear its support? This is called 'without direction.' The ten thousand things are one in equality—what is short? What is long? The Dao has no end or beginning; things have death and birth. They do not rely on their completion. Now empty, now full, they do not settle in their forms. Years cannot be grasped; time cannot be halted. Ebb and flow, fullness and emptiness—when one ends, another begins. This is how one speaks of the great meaning of the Dao and discusses the principles of the ten thousand things.*\n\n*Things come to life as if galloping, as if racing—no movement without change, no moment without transformation. What is to be done? What is not to be done? They are fundamentally self-transforming.\"*\n\nThis question is well-posed: if there is neither noble nor base, neither right nor wrong, then how shall I determine my acceptance or rejection, my pursuit or abandonment? *\"Fan\"* means broad and expansive; *\"fan\"* here is the same character, meaning to seek within oneself. Viewed through the Dao, there is no noble or base—thus, one returns to oneself, naturally at ease and expansive. Hence, it is called *\"returning to abundance.\"* If one binds oneself with distinctions of noble and base, right and wrong, one strays from the Dao. Thus, it is said: *\"unfettered, the will aligns with the Dao in its vast obstruction.\"* Bestowal entails more or less; abandoning bestowal entails neither more nor less. Hence, it is called *\"declining bestowal.\"* If one clings to a single course and is bound by the distinctions of more or less in bestowal, one falls out of step with the Dao. Thus, it is said: *\"without clinging to one, the conduct harmonizes with the Dao without discord.\"* A state with its ruler, a sacrifice with its altar—these analogies illustrate that the mind takes the Dao as its master, without employing private preferences. Hence, it is said: *\"it grants no private virtue, confers no private blessing.\"* This mind is as vast as the four directions, without limit—thus, it has no private divisions. Hence, it is said: *\"it has no demarcations.\"* The three *\"its\"* in these three sentences are distinct. All things are complete within me—this is *\"embracing.\"* Without partiality, hence: *\"which could bear its support?\"* *\"Bearing support\"* describes the intent of partiality. *\"Without direction\"* means without a fixed mind. With no fixed mind, things have no short or long, no life or death. Not relying on completion is as previously stated: *\"not forcing success.\"* Fullness and emptiness follow the moment—no fixed position. Hence, it is said: *\"now empty, now full, they do not settle in their forms.\"* Without past or present, years cannot be grasped; without going or coming, time cannot be halted.\n\n*\"Great meaning\"* refers to the great Dao. *\"Things come to life as if galloping, as if racing\"*—this is what is meant by *\"all things flow away like this.\"* Change and transformation occur without cease—what is to be done? What is not to be done? All is left to the self-transformation of creation. Hence, it is said: *\"they are fundamentally self-transforming.\"*\n\nThe River Lord said: *\"Then what is noble about the Dao?\"*\n\nThe Lord of the Northern Sea said: *\"One who knows the Dao necessarily comprehends principle; one who comprehends principle necessarily understands adaptability. One who understands adaptability does not allow things to harm the self. The one of utmost virtue cannot be scorched by fire, drowned by water, harmed by cold or heat, or injured by birds or beasts. This is not to say one belittles them—it means discerning safety and danger, finding peace in fortune and misfortune, being cautious in approach and retreat, so that nothing can cause harm. Thus, it is said: 'Heaven is within, man is without; virtue resides in Heaven.' Knowing the conduct of Heaven and man originates in Heaven, one abides in attainment, bends and stretches, returns to the essential, and speaks of the ultimate.*\n\n*This question is also well-posed: if one simply follows the transformations of creation, then there is no need for man to study the Dao.\"*\n\nIn Zhu Xi’s *Questions and Answers*, Liao Deming once raised this question, but Master Zhu did not answer—perhaps it was difficult to articulate. Here, Zhuangzi employs the word *\"adaptability\"* with the skill of a master, and the phrase *\"does not allow things to harm the self\"* makes it even clearer. It seems Zhuangzi’s realization of the Dao was intimate and direct; those who read his work may not fully grasp that he speaks of the Dao in its entirety.\n\n*\"Principle\"* refers to the inherent order of things and affairs. *\"Adaptability\"* lies in one’s use of it—only with the complete embodiment of the Dao does one attain this great function. One who understands adaptability does not allow things to harm the self—this is knowing the weight of circumstances. The four phrases—water, fire, birds, beasts—each use *\"cannot\"* to emphasize, then conclude with *\"this is not to say\"* to clarify the vein of thought, lending force to the language. *\"Belittles\"* means to press close. The person of utmost virtue certainly knows all things have their fate—how could external things cause harm? Yet this does not mean one may recklessly belittle them. For example, though death by water or fire is said to be fate, would one willingly throw oneself into water or fire?\n\n\n+++++ src/pages/annotations/2024-07-27-early-morning.md\n---\ntitle: \"Early Morning\"\nlayout: ../../layouts/AnnotationLayout.astro\n---\n\n**Early Morning**\n*by Li Shangyin*\n\nNo light yet on the mountain pass,\nThe moon hangs in the deep blue sky.\nThe rooster crows, the drum sounds,\nThe traveller stirs, the lamp gutters low.\n\nThe fragrant rice steams with white flowers,\nThe sooty saucepan holds a black broth.\nHow many times has the traveler risen early,\nTo the crowing of the rooster and the sound of the drum?\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Li Shangyin (813–858)** was a late Tang dynasty poet known for his dense, allusive style and melancholic themes. This poem, from his *Miscellaneous Poems (Za shi)*, captures the quiet, liminal moment between night and day, a recurring motif in his work.\n\n- **Mountain pass (关 guān):** Likely refers to a frontier pass, evoking the sense of a remote or desolate place, a common setting in Tang poetry for themes of travel and exile.\n\n- **Deep blue sky (苍苍 cāngcāng):** A phrase often used to describe the vast, twilight sky, here suggesting the pre-dawn hour when the sky is still dark but beginning to lighten.\n\n- **Rooster crows, drum sounds (鸡鸣鼓响 jī míng gǔ xiǎng):** In ancient China, roosters and drums were traditional markers of time, signaling the start of the day. The drum may refer to a watchtower drum used in military outposts or cities to mark the changing of the guard.\n\n- **Fragrant rice (香饭 xiāng fàn):** A poetic way to describe freshly steamed rice, its aroma evoking warmth and sustenance, a small comfort for the weary traveler.\n\n- **Sooty saucepan (烟锅 yān guō):** The blackened pot, stained from repeated use, contrasts with the purity of the steaming rice, adding a touch of realism and hardship to the scene.\n\n- **White flowers (白花 bái huā):** Likely refers to the steam rising from the rice, which appears like white blossoms in the dim light.\n\n- **Black broth (黑汁 hēi zhī):** A simple, dark broth, possibly made from soy sauce or fermented black beans, a humble meal for a traveler.\n\n- **How many times (几度 jǐ dù):** Suggests the traveler’s weariness and the repetitive nature of their journey, a common theme in Li Shangyin’s poetry, where time feels cyclical and burdensome.\n\n- **Structure and tone:** The poem is written in *wuyan jueju* (五言绝句), a five-character quatrain, a form often used for concise, evocative scenes. The tone is quiet and introspective, with a sense of loneliness and transience. The repetition of sounds (e.g., *guān, cāng, xiǎng, dī*) creates a musical, almost hypnotic effect, reinforcing the poem’s meditative mood.\n\n- **Themes:** The poem explores themes of solitude, the passage of time, and the small, fleeting comforts of life. The traveler’s early rising, marked by the rooster and drum, suggests a life of duty or exile, where even the simplest meal becomes a moment of respite. The contrast between light and dark, warmth and cold, mirrors the liminal space the poem inhabits—between night and day, rest and labor, home and the road.\n\n\n+++++ src/pages/annotations/2024-07-28-the-hermit.md\n---\ntitle: \"The Hermit\"\nlayout: ../../layouts/AnnotationLayout.astro\n---\n\n**The Hermit**\n*by Jia Dao*\n\nBeneath the pines I ask the boy,\nHe says, \"The master’s gone to gather herbs.\nHe’s somewhere on this mountain—\nThe clouds are deep, I don’t know where.\"\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Jia Dao (779–843)** was a Tang dynasty poet known for his meticulous craftsmanship and focus on the lives of recluses and hermits. This poem, from his *Five-Character Quatrains (Wuyan jueju)*, is one of his most famous works, capturing the elusive nature of the Daoist hermit and the quiet mystery of the natural world.\n\n- **Pines (松 sōng):** In Chinese poetry, pines are often associated with longevity, resilience, and the Daoist ideal of living in harmony with nature. Their presence here sets the scene as one of solitude and natural beauty.\n\n- **The boy (童子 tóngzǐ):** Likely a young disciple or servant of the hermit, emphasizing the hermit’s reclusive lifestyle and the transmission of knowledge or tradition.\n\n- **\"The master’s gone to gather herbs\" (师采药去 shī cǎi yào qù):** Gathering herbs was a common activity for Daoist hermits, both for medicinal purposes and as a metaphor for seeking the \"herbs of immortality\" or the Dao itself. The line suggests the hermit’s deep connection to nature and his pursuit of spiritual or physical well-being.\n\n- **\"He’s somewhere on this mountain\" (只在此山中 zhǐ zài cǐ shān zhōng):** The ambiguity of the hermit’s location reflects the Daoist ideal of living in harmony with the natural world, where one’s presence is felt but not fixed. The mountain itself becomes a metaphor for the vastness of the Dao, which cannot be easily pinned down.\n\n- **\"The clouds are deep, I don’t know where\" (云深不知处 yún shēn bù zhī chù):** The final line is the most evocative, using the image of deep clouds to convey the hermit’s elusiveness and the mystery of the natural world. The clouds obscure the hermit’s exact location, suggesting that the Dao, like the hermit, is both present and intangible, knowable only through indirect means.\n\n- **Structure and tone:** The poem is a *wuyan jueju* (五言绝句), a five-character quatrain, a form often used for concise, vivid scenes. The tone is quiet and contemplative, with a sense of mystery and reverence for the natural world. The dialogue between the speaker and the boy creates a sense of immediacy, while the final line leaves the reader with a sense of wonder and unanswered questions.\n\n- **Themes:** The poem explores themes of solitude, the search for the Dao, and the elusive nature of truth. The hermit’s absence is as meaningful as his presence, suggesting that the Dao is not something that can be directly grasped but must be sought through indirect means, such as nature, intuition, or the guidance of a master. The poem also reflects the Daoist ideal of *wuwei* (无为), or \"non-action,\" where one lives in harmony with the natural flow of the world rather than trying to control it.\n\n- **Literary devices:**\n  - **Imagery:** The pines, clouds, and mountain create a vivid natural scene that evokes a sense of mystery and tranquility.\n  - **Dialogue:** The brief exchange between the speaker and the boy adds a layer of realism and immediacy to the poem.\n  - **Symbolism:** The hermit, the mountain, and the clouds all serve as symbols of the Dao, which is both present and elusive, knowable and unknowable.\n  - **Ambiguity:** The poem’s brevity and open-endedness invite the reader to reflect on the deeper meaning of the hermit’s absence and the nature of the Dao.\n\n\n+++++ src/pages/annotations/2024-07-29-the-peach-blossom-stream.md\n---\ntitle: \"The Peach Blossom Stream\"\nlayout: ../../layouts/AnnotationLayout.astro\n---\n\n**The Peach Blossom Stream**\n*by Zhang Zhihe*\n\nWhere to find the fisherman’s song?\nBeyond the island, mist veils the shore.\nNot that I seek the hidden way—\nThe peach blossoms have led me here.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Zhang Zhihe (730–810?)** was a Tang dynasty poet and Daoist hermit, known for his reclusive lifestyle and his poems about fishing and the natural world. This poem, *Yu Ge Zi* (渔歌子), is one of his most famous works, capturing the serene beauty of a secluded riverside scene and the poet’s sense of harmony with nature.\n\n- **Fisherman’s song (渔歌 yú gē):** In Chinese poetry, the fisherman is often a symbol of the reclusive life, free from the constraints of society and in tune with the rhythms of nature. The fisherman’s song represents this ideal of simplicity and contentment.\n\n- **\"Beyond the island, mist veils the shore\" (岛屿微茫茫 dǎo yǔ wēi máng máng):** The mist obscures the shore, creating a sense of mystery and seclusion. The island and the mist evoke the idea of a hidden, almost otherworldly place, untouched by the outside world.\n\n- **\"Not that I seek the hidden way\" (非为避秦时 fēi wèi bì Qín shí):** This line alludes to the famous *Peach Blossom Spring* (桃花源) by Tao Yuanming, a utopian tale about a hidden village where people live in peace, unaware of the outside world. Zhang Zhihe is saying that he is not deliberately seeking such a hidden paradise—rather, he has stumbled upon it naturally, led by the beauty of the peach blossoms.\n\n- **\"The peach blossoms have led me here\" (桃花带雨飞 táo huā dài yǔ fēi):** The peach blossoms, often associated with spring and renewal, symbolize the beauty and spontaneity of nature. Their presence suggests that the poet’s arrival at this secluded spot is not the result of deliberate effort but rather a natural, almost fated occurrence. The phrase *\"dai yu fei\"* (带雨飞) can also be interpreted as the blossoms \"flying with the rain,\" adding a sense of movement and vitality to the scene.\n\n- **Structure and tone:** The poem is a *wuyan jueju* (五言绝句), a five-character quatrain, a form often used for concise, vivid scenes. The tone is peaceful and contemplative, with a sense of wonder and harmony with nature. The poem’s brevity and simplicity reflect the Daoist ideal of *wuwei* (无为), or \"non-action,\" where one lives in accordance with the natural flow of the world.\n\n- **Themes:** The poem explores themes of reclusion, the beauty of nature, and the idea of finding peace and contentment in a secluded, untouched world. The peach blossoms serve as a symbol of the natural world’s ability to guide and inspire, leading the poet to a place of tranquility and harmony. The poem also reflects the Daoist ideal of living in the moment, free from the distractions and pressures of society.\n\n- **Literary devices:**\n  - **Allusion:** The reference to *Peach Blossom Spring* adds depth to the poem, connecting it to a broader literary tradition of utopian seclusion.\n  - **Imagery:** The mist, the island, and the peach blossoms create a vivid, dreamlike scene that evokes a sense of peace and mystery.\n  - **Symbolism:** The fisherman, the peach blossoms, and the mist all serve as symbols of the reclusive life and the beauty of nature.\n  - **Ambiguity:** The poem’s brevity and open-endedness invite the reader to reflect on the deeper meaning of the scene and the poet’s connection to nature.\n\n\n+++++ src/pages/annotations/2024-07-30-the-hermit-of-orchid-valley.md\n---\ntitle: \"The Hermit of Orchid Valley\"\nlayout: ../../layouts/AnnotationLayout.astro\n---\n\n**The Hermit of Orchid Valley**\n*by Meng Jiao*\n\nIn Orchid Valley, the hermit’s home—\nNo dust, no noise, the gate sealed tight.\nSpring waters flow through empty rooms,\nThe moon shines bright on moss so green.\n\n---\n\n**Notes:**\n\n- **Meng Jiao (751–814)** was a Tang dynasty poet known for his stark, unadorned style and his focus on themes of poverty, solitude",

      "translated_text": "Below it states, *\"Be cautious in advance and retreat,\"* which clarifies the meaning further—akin to Mencius’ saying, *\"One who understands fate does not stand beneath a crumbling wall.\"* To discern safety and danger, to determine fortune and misfortune, to be prudent in advance and retreat—this is the Dao within the heart. How could the human heart ever be left entirely to nature? Yet when Zhuangzi reaches this point, how could he be muddled or restless?\n\nHeaven resides within; humanity, without—just as the earlier passage states: *\"The ruler is the Dao of Heaven; the minister is the Dao of humanity.\"* Virtue lies in Heaven; this speaks of the virtue of nature. Yet he insists on saying *\"knowing the conduct of Heaven and humanity\"*—this *\"knowing\"* arises from the human heart, rooted in nature and at ease with what it attains. Thus, he says, *\"Rooted in the position of Heaven, settled in what is attained.\"* This line again belongs to the Dao of the heart, its settled abiding.\n\n*\"To tread carefully, to advance and retreat\"*—to bend or stretch, to advance or withdraw, each following its own principle—this line again belongs to the human heart, elucidating the essence of the Dao. The ultimate principle is this: *\"Thus, to return to the essential and speak of the ultimate\"*—akin to Mencius’ *\"turning back to simplicity.\"* He asks, *\"What is Heaven? What is humanity?\"* Ruo of the Northern Sea replies: *\"The four legs of oxen and horses—this is called Heaven. Bridling a horse’s head or piercing an ox’s nose—this is called humanity.\"* Hence, he says: *\"Do not let humanity destroy Heaven; do not let purpose obliterate fate; do not let the pursuit of gain lead to the sacrifice of reputation. Be cautious and guard it without loss—this is called returning to one’s true nature.\"*\n\nThese lines make the distinction between the human heart and the Dao-heart ever clearer. The four legs of oxen and horses are received from Heaven, natural and unrestrained—if not tethered or pierced, they would be of no use. This is the affair of the human heart. To let humanity destroy Heaven, to let purpose obliterate fate, to covet gain and chase reputation—here, the human heart flows into peril. The three *\"do not\"* are prohibitive phrases, like the four *\"do not\"* before. Having known Heaven and known humanity, to guard this cautiously without loss is to preserve the Heavenly principle in full. Thus, he says, *\"This is called returning to one’s true nature.\"* Fate is the Heavenly principle; humanity is human affairs. *\"Attainment\"* here refers to what is gained or lost.\n\nThe centipede pities the snake, the snake pities the wind, the wind pities the eye, the eye pities the heart.

      "translated_text": "\"There is none like me—how could this be altered? It cannot be changed. 'There is a likeness' refers to a visible form. *Pengpeng*—the sound of wind. Pointing at me with a hand gestures toward the wind; defending against me with a foot tramples the wind. Within the wind, the addition of 'small defeats' and 'great victories' makes it ever more wondrous. This conveys the idea that though the many may overcome Heaven, and Heaven may overcome the many, the small may not prevail yet the great victory belongs to none beyond the workings of creation. That which is spontaneous and natural cannot be defied by any thing. When Confucius traveled to Kuang, men of Song surrounded him in several layers, yet he continued singing without pause. Zilu entered and asked, 'Why is the Master so joyful?' Confucius replied, 'Come, let me tell you. I have long avoided adversity, yet it has not spared me—this is fate. I have long sought success, yet it has not come—this is timing. Under Yao and Shun, there were no destitute men, not because they were wise enough to obtain it; under Jie and Zhou, there were no successful men, not because they were wise enough to lose it. Such is the way of circumstances. The fisherman who travels through water without avoiding dragons and serpents displays the courage of his trade. The hunter who travels on land without avoiding rhinoceroses and tigers displays the courage of his trade. The man who faces flashing blades and regards death as life displays the courage of a martyr. But he who knows that adversity is a matter of fate, that success is a matter of timing, and who confronts great peril without fear—this is the courage of the sage.' Zilu, take your place. My fate is governed by forces beyond me. Soon, the armored men advanced and said, 'We mistook you for Yang Hu, hence the siege. Now that we know otherwise, we withdraw.' This passage merely speaks of timing and fate as natural, not subject to human foresight—what fear could the Dao-knower have? The comparison of the fisherman, hunter, and martyr to the sage is also fitting, conveying the idea that one should cease and not dwell on such matters.\n\nGongsun Long asked Wei Mou, 'In my youth, I studied the Dao of the former kings; in maturity, I understood the practice of benevolence and righteousness. I harmonized sameness and difference, separated hardness and whiteness, affirmed the \"so\" and the \"not-so,\" and refuted the \"can\" and the \"cannot.\" I exhausted the wisdom of the Hundred Schools and silenced the debates of countless mouths. I considered myself the most enlightened—until now, hearing Zhuangzi’s words, I am bewildered. I do not know whether my understanding falls short of his, or whether my knowledge is inferior. Now, I am at a loss for words. May I ask the reason?' Prince Mou sighed deeply, looked up to the sky, and laughed, saying, 'Have you not heard of the frog in the shallow well? It said to the turtle of the Eastern Sea, \"How joyful I am! I leap about on the railing of the well, rest in the broken walls of its sides. When I enter the water, it supports my armpits and cradles my chin; when I tread in the mud, it covers my feet and submerges my ankles. I look around at the shrimp, crabs, and tadpoles—none can compare to me! Moreover, to command the water of a single ravine and stand astride the joy of a shallow well—this is the utmost delight. Why do you not come in and see for yourself?\" The turtle of the Eastern Sea had not yet placed its left foot inside when its right knee was already stuck. It retreated and told the frog of the sea: \"A distance of a thousand *li* does not suffice to describe its vastness; a height of a thousand *ren* does not suffice to measure its depth. In the time of Yu, floods lasted nine years out of ten, yet the waters did not increase; in the time of Tang, droughts lasted seven years out of eight, yet the shores did not recede. Not to be altered by the passage of time, nor by the quantity of water—this is the great joy of the Eastern Sea.\" At this, the frog in the shallow well was stunned, dismayed, and lost.\n\nMoreover, for one who does not know the boundary between knowledge and ignorance, right and wrong, to yet desire to examine Zhuangzi’s words is like making a mosquito carry a mountain or a centipede race across a river—it will surely fail. And for one who does not understand the ultimate discourse yet seeks momentary satisfaction—is this not the frog in the shallow well? For he treads upon the Yellow Springs and ascends the Great Vastness, unbound by south or north, released in all four directions, submerged in the unfathomable, unconfined by east or west, beginning in profound obscurity and returning to great penetration. Yet you seek to measure it with narrow vision, to grasp it with petty debate—is this not like using a tube to view the sky or a awl to probe the earth? How small indeed! Go now.'\"",

      "translated_text": "The Great August Heaven—below, one treads the Yellow Springs; above, one ascends to the heavens—such is the loftiness and remoteness of his vision. *Shìrán* is to be suddenly released, at ease. Fourfold liberation, fourfold penetration—plunging into the unfathomable, the depths of his entry are profound. Beginning in the dark and obscure, he speaks of what lies before the boundless. Returning to the Great Thoroughfare, he reverts to the Ultimate Dao.\n\nTo employ the petty clarity of discriminating wisdom in an attempt to exhaustively probe it with words and debate—is this not small indeed? The parable of the man of Handan who lost his gait is especially fine: *guónéng* refers to the gait native to the state of Handan. Having failed to master it, he also lost his original way of walking—thus he crawled home on all fours.\n\nWhat Liezi says of Wei Mou and Gongsun Long differs entirely from this. Zhuangzi was fishing at Pu Water when the King of Chu sent two grandees to approach him first, saying, “I wish to burden you with the affairs of the realm.” Zhuangzi, holding his rod, did not even glance at them, and said, “I have heard that in Chu there is a sacred turtle that has been dead for three thousand years. The king keeps it wrapped in cloth and stored in a casket, enshrined in the ancestral temple. Would this turtle rather have died and left its bones to be venerated, or lived and dragged its tail through the mud?” The two grandees said, “It would rather live and drag its tail through the mud.” Zhuangzi said, “Go away. I too shall drag my tail through the mud.”\n\nThe phrase “to approach him first” means to go ahead and convey this intent. “To burden you with the affairs of the realm” means to entrust him with governance. The parable of choosing between death and leaving one’s bones or life and dragging one’s tail—truly, it is extraordinary.\n\nWhen Huizi was prime minister of Liang, Zhuangzi went to visit him. Someone said to Huizi, “Zhuangzi has come intending to replace you as minister.” Thereupon Huizi, alarmed, had the state searched for three days and three nights. Zhuangzi went to see him and said, “In the south there is a bird called the *yuānchú*—are you familiar with it? The *yuānchú* sets out from the South Sea and flies to the North Sea; it will perch only on a paulownia tree, eat only bamboo fruit, and drink only sweet spring water. Now, a *chī* (owl) had found a rotten rat; when the *yuānchú* flew past, it looked up and cried, ‘Hah!’ Now, do you intend to use your state of Liang to ‘hah!’ at me?”\n\nThe *hah* is a cry of fear that one’s food will be snatched away. Comparing the owl’s rotten rat to the *yuānchú* and Huizi’s use of the state to “hah!” at him—where did this old man find so many fine parables? From Zhuangzi onward, those who write have merely fiddled with his mechanisms. How could the world do without this book?\n\nZhuangzi and Huizi were the closest of friends; this incident likely never occurred, but was merely playful mockery. *Liànshí* refers to bamboo fruit.\n\nZhuangzi and Huizi were strolling on the bridge over the Hao River. Zhuangzi said, “The *shū* fish swim out at ease—this is the joy of fish.” Huizi said, “You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?” Zhuangzi said, “You are not me—how do you know that I do not know the joy of fish?” Huizi said, “I am not you, so of course I do not know you. You are certainly not a fish, so your not knowing the joy of fish is complete.” Zhuangzi said, “Let us return to the beginning. When you said, ‘How do you know the joy of fish?’ you already knew that I knew it and asked me. I know it here, on the Hao.”\n\nThis exchange is also extraordinary. “Return to the beginning” means to revert to the origin. It means: when you initially asked, “You are not a fish—how do you know the joy of fish?” you already understood my intent in asking this. Since you know me thus, I likewise know the fish here on the Hao. These two were the closest of friends; one imagines their dialogue at the time was a sight to behold.\n\nThis chapter’s dialogue between the River Lord and the Ocean Spirit pairs well with the *Record of the Transmission of the Lamp*’s exchange between National Preceptor Zhong and the monk on “the Dharma of no emotion” and “becoming a buddha with no mind.” Dahui said, “This old man is stubborn, and when he encounters this monk, he too is stubbornly stuck. The question concerns the vitality of his house, the great gate, the vast waves, the severing of the root of life.” These few lines of Zhuangzi are indeed equal to them. (See Dahui’s *Recorded Sayings* in the *Universal Lamp*.)\n\n**Outer Chapters, “Perfect Joy,” Chapter Eighteen**\nIs there perfect joy in the world, or is there not?",

What should one pursue? What should one abandon? What should one delight in? What should one detest?\n\nWhat the world honors are wealth, nobility, longevity, and goodness. What it delights in are bodily ease, rich flavors, fine garments, beautiful sights, and sweet sounds. What it despises are poverty, lowliness, early death, and wickedness. What it suffers are a body denied rest, a mouth denied rich flavors, a form denied fine garments, eyes denied beautiful sights, and ears denied sweet sounds.

Thus it is said: “If loyal admonition is unheeded, withdraw and do not contend.” Yet when Wu Zixu contended, his body was destroyed; had he not contended, his name would not have endured. Is there truly goodness, or is there not?\n\nNow, what the world pursues and delights in—I do not know whether this joy is truly joy or truly not joy. I observe that those who rush together in the world’s pursuits do so frantically, as if they cannot help themselves, all calling it joy. Yet I do not find it joyful, nor do I find it not joyful. Is there truly joy, or is there not?\n\nI take non-action as true joy—yet this is what the world deems the greatest suffering. Thus it is said: “Perfect joy is no joy; perfect praise is no praise.” The right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. Perfect joy and the preservation of the body lie only in non-action—how close it is to being realized!\n\nThis chapter expands upon the earlier theme of “not allowing things to harm oneself.” The questions “What should one do? On what should one rely?” and the following four phrases ask, “How can one be right?” The structure here mirrors that of Qu Yuan’s *Encountering Sorrow*.

      "translated_text": "To ponder good and bad is to take on affairs, yet such thought brings only worry. To grow muddled with age is to lose clarity. The ardent scholar pursues fame and reputation. The four false assumptions share the same root—all harm the self through things. Now that the three false assumptions of wealth, nobility, and longevity have been dismissed, only the ardent scholar remains. This shift in phrasing reveals the artistry of the text.\n\nTo crouch in hesitation or to retreat in caution—if one contends, the body is maimed; if one does not contend for fame, no reputation is made. These two lines expose the worldly folly of pursuing fame to the point of bodily harm—how can this be called good?\n\nThe following passage concludes the four false assumptions: \"All the world rushes together\"—this describes how the masses surge forward in unison. \"Urgent and restless\" conveys their relentless pursuit, as if unable to stop even when they should. \"What the world calls joy, I neither know as joy nor as its absence\"—this expresses deep disdain, for while I find joy in non-action, the world deems it the greatest suffering. Perfect joy lies in no-joy; perfect praise lies in no-praise. Yet who among the worldly understands the joy of no-joy or the praise of no-praise? Thus, the right and wrong of the world cannot truly be settled. Nevertheless, non-action can settle right and wrong. These lines must be read with attention to their rising and falling cadence to appreciate their beauty. \"Nearly preserved\" means that through non-action, one may nearly attain such joy.\n\nLet me attempt to explain: Heaven is non-active and thus clear; Earth is non-active and thus tranquil. When the two non-actions unite, the myriad things transform—vague and indistinct, with no trace of origin, formless and boundless. All things flourish naturally from non-action, hence it is said: \"Heaven and Earth are non-active, yet nothing is left undone.\" Who among men can attain non-action?\n\nThese lines conclude the preceding discussion: when the two non-actions unite, they give rise to the myriad things—this is the meaning of \"non-action yet nothing left undone.\" \"No trace of origin\" means no visible beginning. \"Flourish\" means to grow. All things arise naturally, hence it is said they flourish from non-action. From \"The world has perfect joy\" to \"can one attain non-action?\" this passage flows with undulating rhythm, inviting deep reflection.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi’s wife died, Huizi came to offer condolences. Zhuangzi sat with legs splayed, drumming on a basin and singing. Huizi said, \"To live with someone, raise a child to old age, and then not weep at their death would be enough—yet you drum and sing. Is this not excessive?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Not so. When she first died, how could I not grieve? But upon reflection, I saw that in the beginning, she was not alive—nor was she merely without life, but without form; nor merely without form, but without qi. Amidst the vague and indistinct, qi transformed, then form, then life. Now, life has transformed into death, like the cycling of spring, autumn, winter, and summer. She lies peacefully in the great chamber, and if I were to wail and weep, I would show myself ignorant of fate—thus I stopped.\"\n\n\"Form transformed into life\" means that form precedes the movement of life. The Buddhists say that movement and stillness return to wind—this is the meaning of \"life.\" They also say: in the eye, it is seeing; in the ear, hearing; in the hand, grasping; in the feet, walking—this is the meaning of \"life.\" \"The cycling of the four seasons\" is a metaphor for the inevitability of death following life.\n\nThis passage illustrates the principle that life and death are one continuum. The act of drumming on the basin is also allegorical. Consider Yuan Rang, who climbed a tree and sang at his parent’s death—could he truly have been devoid of human feeling? If so, he would be no better than a beast. Would the Master have befriended him? The teachings of the Confucian school emphasize fulfilling filial piety—how could they not understand the principle of life and death? Yuan Rang, Zhuangzi, and their ilk sought to expose the world’s delusions, hence their extreme actions. This is the subtlety of the Daoist mind, which cannot be practiced in isolation. Thus, the teaching of the \"Golden Mean\" exists. Did Zhuangzi and Liezi not understand this? They merely sought to correct the world’s weariness of convention through such arguments.\n\nWhen Li Hanlao mourned his son, Da Hui reproached him for being unable to let go of emotion, fearing it was not in accord with the Dao. Da Hui replied, \"Not weeping at a child’s death is the way of beasts.\" This elder’s words show great insight. Other Buddhists, when asked such questions, would only spout nonsense.\n\nZhilishu and Huajieshu were observing the mound of Mingbo, the wasteland of Kunlun, and the resting place of the Yellow Emperor when suddenly a growth appeared on Huajieshu’s left elbow. He was dismayed. Zhilishu asked, \"Do you dislike it?\" Huajieshu replied, \"No—why should I? Life is a temporary borrowing. What is borrowed is life; life is but dust and grime. Death and life are like day and night. You and I observe transformation, and now it has reached us—why should I dislike it?\"\n\n\"Huajie\" means \"slippery and humorous\"—such names are surely invented. \"The Yellow Emperor’s resting place\" refers to where the Emperor once rested. \"Growth\" refers to a sore; today, we call it a boil. One imagines such names existed in ancient times. \"Dismayed\" conveys his distress. \"Temporary borrowing\" means this body is a fleeting assemblage of external things. \"Dust and grime\" means it is insignificant within the workings of creation, unworthy of esteem. The Buddhist concept of the \"four conditions forming a false self\" originates here. Where is this illusory body now? The earlier dismay and later indifference seem contradictory, but disliking illness is human nature. To contemplate the principle of life and death and understand its origin is to let the Daoist mind prevail.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi traveled to Chu, he saw an empty skull, bleached and shaped. He tapped it with his horse whip and asked, \"Did you, sir, covet life and lose principle, becoming like this? Or did you meet with the ruin of a state and the executioner’s axe, becoming like this?\"",

Or did you suffer from cold and hunger, becoming like this? Or did your years naturally come to this end?\"\n\nWith these words concluded, Zhuangzi took the skull as his pillow and lay down. In the dead of night, the skull appeared to him in a dream and said, \"Your speech resembles that of a sophist. All that you and others have mentioned are the burdens of the living. In death, none of these exist. Would you like to hear of the joys of death?\"\n\nZhuangzi replied, \"Indeed.\"\n\nThe skull said, \"In death, there is no lord above nor minister below, nor the affairs of the four seasons. At ease, one takes heaven and earth as spring and autumn. Even the joy of a king facing south cannot surpass this.\"\n\nZhuangzi, unconvinced, said, \"If I were to have the Controller of Fate restore your form—your bones, flesh, and skin—returning you to your parents, wife, children, neighbors, and acquaintances, would you desire this?\"\n\nThe skull furrowed its brow deeply and replied, \"How could I abandon the joy of a king facing south to return to the toils of the human world?\"\n\n*(The text notes: \"Hao ran\" describes the empty yet solid appearance; \"cong ran\" conveys a sense of ease and contentment. All that \"you and others\" have spoken are mere suppositions. This passage employs the skull as a fictional device to expound the principle of life and death. Readers should grasp its intent and not take it as literal truth.)*\n\nWhen Yan Yuan was traveling east to Qi, Confucius wore a worried expression. Zigong stepped down from his mat and asked, \"May this student dare to inquire why, when Yan Hui travels to Qi, the Master wears a worried look?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"Excellent question. Long ago, Guanzi spoke words I found most apt: 'A small cloth bag cannot hold large things; a short well-rope cannot draw from deep waters.' Such is the way of things—destiny has its completion, and form has its proper place. These cannot be diminished or augmented.\n\nI fear that Yan Hui, in speaking to the Marquis of Qi of the Dao of Yao, Shun, the Yellow Emperor, and further of Suiren and Shennong, will prompt the marquis to seek within himself and find nothing. Finding nothing, he will be confused. Confusion leads to death. Have you not heard the tale of old? Once, a seabird alighted in the outskirts of Lu. The Marquis of Lu received it with ceremony and offered it wine in the temple, performed the *Nine Shao* as music, and prepared a grand feast of sacrificial oxen. The bird, however, looked on with sorrow and dread, refusing to eat a morsel or drink a cup. After three days, it died. This is to nourish a bird with what nourishes oneself, not with what nourishes a bird.\n\nTo nourish a bird as a bird should be nourished, one ought to let it roost in deep forests, wander open plains, float upon rivers and lakes, feed upon minnows and fry, follow in formation, and rest at ease. Birds detest the sound of human speech—why subject it to such clamor? When the music of *Xianchi* and *Nine Shao* is performed in the wilds of Dongting, birds hear it and fly away, beasts hear it and flee, fish hear it and dive deep, while men, hearing it, gather to listen. Fish live in water and thrive, but men drown in it. Their likes and dislikes must differ, and thus they are distinct.\n\nTherefore, the sages of old did not demand uniform abilities nor identical tasks. Names were confined to reality, and meanings were set to what was fitting. This is called 'orderly attainment and sustained fortune.' *(A \"chu\" is a cloth bag; a \"geng\" is a well-rope. This metaphor conveys that small strength cannot bear great burdens. Destiny and form, bestowed by heaven, each have their fixed allotment and cannot be diminished or augmented.)*\n\nTo speak of the Dao of the ancient sages to the Marquis of Qi, yet fail to move or transform him, would invite blame upon myself.\" *(This passage uses Yan Hui to satirize the wandering persuaders of the age.)*\n\n\"The food of birds is not the food of men. To nourish a bird with human food violates its nature.\" *(This simply means one should not speak where speech is inappropriate. Yet the sage’s school distills it to a single truth, while Zhuangzi spins vast, boundless words.)* *(The pronunciation of \"yu\" is \"ya,\" meaning to welcome and offer wine. \"Shang\" means to drink. \"Tan\" is pronounced \"dan,\" the same as \"chan,\" referring to sandy shoals in water, hence \"open plains.\")*\n\n\"Not demanding uniform abilities\" means each person’s talents differ. \"Not requiring identical tasks\" means each attends to their own affairs. Names arise from reality, and meanings align with what is fitting. Thus, it is said, \"Names are confined to reality, and meanings are set to what is fitting.\" This means each follows their allotted place. \"Orderly attainment\" means proceeding directly without strain. \"Sustained fortune\" means fortune is ever-present. *(To \"hold\" is to preserve.)* If one does not overreach beyond their capacity, they proceed without strain and preserve their life, free from harm. The intent is no more than this.\n\nLiezi was traveling and eating by the roadside when he saw a century-old skull.

The roots of *wuzu* further metamorphose into *qicao*, while its leaves become butterflies. *Qicao* are beetle grubs, also known by the alternate name *xu* for butterflies. The addition of this line beneath \"butterflies\" is particularly striking. Below, it speaks again of creatures born through transformation: the insects beneath the stove, which transform into a creature called *quduo*, soft and without skin or shell—hence said to be \"as if shed,\" like the modern citrus worm. *Quduo* can further transform into the bird *ganyugu*, a species of skeletal bird. These are *simivi* insects, whose flowing saliva in turn transforms into other insects—*shimi*, which are midges. The midges transform into *yilu*, *yilu* into *jiuyou*, *jiuyou* into *huangkuang*, *huangkuang* into *fuxuan*, and *fuxuan* into *maorui*. Here, two lines are omitted with the phrase \"born from,\" a matter of literary structure. *Huangkuang*, *jiuyou*, *fuxuan*, and *maorui* are all names of insects. The underlying meaning is that the transformations of the myriad things are ceaseless, with no end to their generation.\n\nThe preceding passage concludes with something most bizarre, which is where it startles the common world. One must not take it as literal truth. *Yangxi* is the name of a grass, a bamboo-like plant that does not produce shoots—called *busun*, or \"non-shooting bamboo.\" Its shoots are inedible, unlike those of ordinary bamboo. *Qingning* is an insect, as is *cheng*. *Ma* is another name for a grass, what is now called *machicai* (purslane) or *malancao* (horse-fence grass). *Ren* is also a name for a grass, what is now called *renshen* (ginseng). *Renmianzi* is yet another. Though these are clearly the names of various grasses, the deliberate inclusion of the characters for \"horse\" and \"human\" is meant to be uncanny and strange. Previous commentators have all deemed this passage obscure, but in truth, it is the people of a thousand generations who have been duped by Zhuangzi, unable to see through it.\n\nThe transformations of the myriad things—such as sparrows becoming clams, hawks becoming turtledoves, rotting grass becoming fireflies, or moss becoming bats—are boundless. \"Entering the mechanism\" means returning to the end. \"Exiting and entering the mechanism\" is none other than exiting and entering life and death—this is the \"fire-drill,\" the inexhaustible.",

      "translated_text": "**Chapter 19: Attaining Life (Outer Chapters)**\n\nThose who grasp the essence of attaining life do not strive after what is unnecessary for life. Those who grasp the essence of attaining destiny do not pursue what is beyond knowledge. Why then must one nurture the body with things? There are cases where things are in surplus yet the body remains unnourished. There are cases where life must precede the absence of separation from form, yet form remains unsevered while life perishes. Alas! The people of the world believe that nurturing the body is sufficient to preserve life, yet if nurturing the body is truly insufficient to preserve life, then what in the world is worth doing? Though it may be insufficient, one cannot but do it—such is the inescapable.\n\nTo escape the burden of the body, nothing surpasses abandoning the world. Abandoning the world means being without encumbrance; without encumbrance, one is upright and level; upright and level, one alternates with that which renews life; alternating with renewal, one approaches the ultimate. What need is there to abandon affairs? What need is there to forsake life? Abandoning affairs, the body is not wearied; forsaking life, the essence is not scattered. When the body is whole and essence restored, one becomes one with Heaven. Heaven and Earth are the parents of the myriad things: united, they form a body; dispersed, they become a beginning. When form and essence are not scattered, this is called \"the power to transform.\" Essence, once transformed, returns to assist Heaven in its work of generation.\n\nWhat is meant by \"what is unnecessary for life\" refers to things external to the body—such as the few pairs of sandals or the single spoon a person uses in life. What is meant by \"what is beyond knowledge\" refers to what lies beyond human effort. Nurturing the body must rely on things, and life must preserve its form—this is the common view of the world. Yet things are often in surplus, while the body does not endure forever. Even if the form is preserved, life is finite. Thus it is said: there are cases where things are in surplus yet the body remains unnourished, and cases where form remains unsevered while life perishes. Though it may be insufficient, one cannot but do it—this is what was previously meant by \"nothing is sufficient to be done, yet one cannot but do it.\" The inescapable refers to the fact that whether one acts or not, one cannot avoid self-entanglement. To escape self-entanglement, nothing surpasses abandoning the world.\n\nAbandoning the world does not mean fleeing it. Dwelling in the world with a mind free of attachment, one responds only when moved, acts only when compelled, and rises only when unavoidable. Thus, the self remains the self, and the world remains the world. \"Upright and level\" means the mind is without high or low, without discrimination—akin to the Buddhist saying, \"This dharma is equal.\" \"Alternating with renewal\" means engaging in boundless transformation. \"That\" refers to the Creator. To transform together with the Creator is to renew endlessly, ever fresh. Thus it is said, \"alternating with that which renews life.\" When this is fully realized, one approaches the ultimate—near-perfection.\n\nThose who grasp this truth will find that affairs external to the body and life itself do not await abandonment but are naturally forsaken. \"Essence restored\" means the spirit is not scattered outwardly. \"United, they form a body\" refers to the four great elements combining to form the body; \"dispersed, they return to the beginning\" means returning to the origin, the state before things existed. Form and essence are body and spirit. When body and spirit are not scattered, they possess the power to transform—hence \"the power to shift.\" To shift is to transform. When one embodies the Dao to this degree, essence becomes ever more refined, and one can then assist in the work of creation.\n\nLiezi asked Guanyin, \"The perfected person walks underwater without choking, treads fire without burning, and moves above the myriad things without fear. May I ask how one attains this?\" Guanyin replied, \"This is the preservation of pure *qi*—it is not a matter of knowledge, skill, boldness, or courage. Let me tell you: all that has appearance, image, sound, or color is a thing. How can things be far apart from one another? How can they suffice to attain this? First, there is only form; then, things are created. Without form, there is cessation. Without transformation, one attains this and exhausts it. Things, having attained it, come to rest. That which rests will dwell in it.\"",

      "translated_text": "Holding to the measure of non-excess and abiding in the boundless principle, one roams where the myriad things begin and end. Unifying their nature, nurturing their *qi*, harmonizing their virtue, one thereby connects with that from which things are made. Those who do so preserve their Heaven-given integrity in full, their spirit unbreached—how could external things find entry?\n\nConsider the drunkard who falls from a carriage: though the fall be swift, he does not die. His bones and joints are the same as others’, yet the harm he suffers differs—his spirit remains whole. He is unaware of riding, unaware of falling. Life and death, terror and dread do not enter his breast; thus, he encounters things without fear. If one can be so whole through wine, how much more so when whole through Heaven? The sage hides within Heaven, and so nothing can harm him.\n\nThe avenger does not break the sharpest blade; even one with a vengeful heart does not resent a tile blown by the wind. Thus, the world attains balance: no wars of conquest, no punishments of slaughter—all arises from this Dao.\n\nOne does not open the Heaven in man but opens the Heaven of Heaven. Opening the latter gives birth to virtue; opening the former gives birth to harm. Not wearying of Heaven, not neglecting the people—this is near perfection. With one’s true nature concealed, one moves unseen without obstruction, advancing without hindrance. Walking above the myriad things without fear—this is like riding the wind.

      "translated_text": "Speaking of this matter, it is not something that can be achieved through the mind’s cunning or the force of strength. Though these words may seem impractical, they are in truth grounded in principle. Observe today’s practitioners of *fuqi* (breath cultivation): their appearance, form, color, and voice—all bear traces of the tangible. The myriad things are constrained by form; if I too leave traces, I become no different from them. How then can I reach the state before the existence of things? People are confined to their bodies and cannot perceive what lies beyond. All things at their origin are burdened by their own traces—hence it is said, \"This is merely form,\" for form is nothing but trace.\n\nThe Creator of things is formless, thus it is said, \"the creation of things.\" Without form, there is no end and no beginning, one and not two—hence it is said, \"it abides.\" There is no transformation, for transformation implies change. To say it undergoes no change is to grasp the principle of creation. One who fully comprehends this principle of creation transcends the realm of things with form—how distant then is the world of tangible things! Thus it is said, \"Where is the thing?\" To divide it is to indulge in disorder, to lack constancy. The measure of non-indulgence is the constant standard. The beginning without origin is the inception of things—here, \"discipline\" means principle. The beginning and end of the myriad things is creation. To unify one’s nature is to keep it pure and undivided; to harmonize one’s virtue is to preserve it whole and undivided. United with the Creator, one is said to \"communicate with\" it.\n\nWhat creates things is called Heaven, called Spirit—this is the principle within me. Without gaps or fissures, what is within remains whole and unbroken; how then could anything external intrude? Encountering things without fear means that though one may be touched by external things, the spirit remains unmoved and thus unafraid. The analogy of the drunken man falling from a cart is most precise: \"Concealed in Heaven, nothing can harm him\" echoes the earlier passage, \"not allowing things to harm oneself\"—this is what is meant by \"non-action.\"\n\nThe sharpest blade may wound, a tile blown by the wind may strike, yet people do not resent them, for these things act without intention. These two examples illustrate the principle of \"without intention.\" When the world attains balance, it means one moves through the world without preferences or aversions. Where there is contention, there are wars of conquest and punishments of slaughter; but if one is without intention, there is no contention—how then could such things arise?\n\n\"The Heaven in man\" still involves intention, whereas \"the Heaven of Heaven\" is without intention. To open the latter is to give birth to virtue; to open the former is to invite harm. \"Not wearying of Heaven\" means not abandoning Heavenly principle; \"not neglecting the people\" means that while one attends to human affairs, one does so without the mind’s cunning. This is near to true principle.\n\nConfucius, traveling in Chu, came upon a hunchback in the forest catching cicadas with a pole as easily as if picking them up. Confucius said, \"You are skillful! Is there a method to this?\" The man replied, \"I have a method. For five or six months, I practice balancing two pellets on the pole without dropping them; if I drop them, I lose but a few. If I balance three pellets without dropping them, I lose only one in ten. If I balance five pellets without dropping them, I catch cicadas as easily as picking them up. I hold my body as still as a tree stump, my arm as steady as a dry branch. Though the world is vast and things myriad, I am aware of nothing but the cicada’s wings. I do not turn aside, I do not waver—how could I fail to succeed?\"\n\nConfucius turned to his disciples and said, \"With undivided focus, the spirit becomes concentrated—this is what the hunchbacked elder means.\" The hunchback was one who caught cicadas by holding a pole and snaring them. By balancing pellets on the pole’s tip, from two to five without dropping them, his concentration became so profound that it entered the realm of spirit. Guo Xiang’s note below the two characters \"停审\" (stillness and scrutiny) is also apt. \"橛株拘\" refers to what we now call a wooden stake—*jue* and *zhu* are names for stakes, and *ju* means fixed. One imagines such terms existed in ancient times. \"Not turning aside, not wavering\" simply means unwavering focus. When catching cicadas, his body was as motionless as a wooden stake, his arm as still as a dry branch. His mind was fixed solely on the cicada, unaware of anything else—this is the height of singular focus. \"With undivided focus\" means the will is not divided; \"the spirit becomes concentrated\" means the spirit is so focused that it becomes spirit-like. Though this is used as an analogy for guarding pure *qi*, such things truly exist in the world, and they exist even today. However, people regard them merely as skills and do not realize the Dao is embedded within.\n\nThe hunchback was one whose back was bent. Yan Yuan asked Confucius, \"I once crossed the deep pool of Shang. The ferryman handled the boat as if by magic. I asked him, 'Can one learn to handle a boat?' He said, 'Yes. A good swimmer can learn quickly. As for the diver, he can handle a boat without ever having seen one.' I asked him to explain, but he would not. May I ask what he meant?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"A good swimmer can learn quickly because he has forgotten the water. As for the diver who has never seen a boat yet handles it with ease—he sees the depths as if they were a hill, the overturning of a boat as if it were a cart rolling backward. Though countless dangers may appear before him, they do not enter his mind. Where could he go and not be at ease? One who stakes tiles in a game is skillful; one who stakes hooks is hesitant; one who stakes gold is troubled. The skill is the same, but where there is attachment, the weight is external. Those who are weighed down externally are clumsy within.\"\n\nShang was the name of a deep pool. A swimmer is one who floats on the surface; a diver is one who swims underwater. A skilled diver sees water as level ground and thus can handle a boat without learning. Though countless dangers may arise, his mind remains undisturbed—hence it is said, \"they do not enter his mind.\" *Zhu* means to stake in a game of skill. To stake tiles is to be free of concerns about gain or loss; to stake hooks is to have some attachment; to stake gold is to be deeply attached and thus prone to trouble. *Jin* means to cherish or be attached. The skill of the archer is fundamentally the same, but where there is attachment, the weight is external, and the mind becomes confused. Confusion leads to clumsiness even in skill. Having answered the question, Confucius further illustrated it with this analogy—both analogies embody the highest principle in the world. Observe how the flow of the text rises and concludes—it is truly remarkable.\n\nTian Kaizhi had an audience with Duke Wei of Zhou. The Duke said, \"I have heard that Zhu Shen is a student of the Dao. You have studied with Zhu Shen—what have you learned from him?\" Tian Kaizhi said, \"Kaizhi sweeps the courtyard with a broom—what could I have learned from the Master?\" The Duke said, \"Tianzi, do not be modest. I wish to hear it.\" Kaizhi said, \"I have heard the Master say: 'One who nurtures life well is like a shepherd—he watches those who lag behind and whips them.'\"\n\nThe Duke said, \"What does this mean?\" Tian Kaizhi said, \"In Lu, there was a man named Shan Bao who lived in the mountains, drank from streams, and did not compete with others for profit. At seventy, he still had the complexion of a child. Unfortunately, he encountered a hungry tiger, which killed and ate him. There was also a man named Zhang Yi who frequented the gates of the wealthy and ran errands for all. At forty, he suffered from internal exhaustion and died. Bao nurtured his inner self, yet the tiger devoured his outer; Yi nurtured his outer self, yet illness attacked his inner. These two did not whip those who lagged behind.\"",

      "translated_text": "A *báhuì* is a broom—*bá* meaning to uproot, as in pulling up by the roots. To \"grasp the broom and stand at the gate\" refers to the duty of disciples in sweeping and cleaning. The shepherd of sheep allows them to roam naturally, yet if one straggles behind and fails to follow the flock, he whips it. This implies that even when following the Dao of Heaven, one must also fulfill human effort.\n\nShan Bao dwelled in the mountains and was killed by a tiger; Zhang Yi frequented the households of the wealthy, though no tiger threatened him, yet his chest burned with restless agitation, and he perished from internal exhaustion. Both cases reveal where human effort was incomplete—one cannot simply entrust all to Heaven. This analogy is most intimate and direct for those who study the Dao. From this, one may grasp Zhuangzi’s intent in distinguishing between the Dao of Heaven and the Dao of Man: first setting forth a metaphor, then illustrating it with two examples. The structure of the text is also remarkable.\n\nConfucius said: \"Do not retreat into concealment; do not emerge into full display; stand firm in the center.\" If one attains the meaning of these three, one must reach the utmost. \"Do not retreat into concealment\" does not mean to focus solely on stillness; \"do not emerge into full display\" does not mean to cling solely to activity. \"Standing firm\" describes standing without intention, its form like withered wood. Since activity and stillness are not constant, one must not lean toward either extreme—hence \"standing in the center.\" The \"three\" refer to the three phrases above. If one fully embodies these three, one may be called a *zhi ren* (perfected person). Thus it is said: \"If one attains the meaning of these three, one must reach the utmost\"—the utmost being perfection.\n\nNow, those who fear the highway: if one in ten is killed, fathers and sons, brothers and kin will warn one another, and only with a great escort of armed followers will they dare to venture forth. Is this not wisdom? Yet what people truly ought to fear lies upon their sleeping mats and between their meals, and not knowing to guard against these is their error. The fear of the highway is likened to the dangers of the sleeping mat—this is the meaning of the saying that \"the axe that hews one’s nature lies in the moth-eyebrows.\" This teaches people the warning against indulging desire. Even sages and worthies, upon hearing Zhuangzi’s words, would surely nod in assent. Is this not also a teaching of the \"heterodox\"?\n\nThe sacrificial officer, clad in dark ceremonial robes, approaches the pen and addresses the pig: \"Why do you hate death? I will raise you for three months, fast for ten days, purify for three, and spread white rushes beneath you as you rest upon my shoulders. Would you then wish to die upon the carved altar?\" If one were to advise the pig, one would say: \"Better to eat chaff and糟 and remain in the pen.\" Yet when advising oneself, one would accept a life of noble rank and a death upon the painted bier, surrounded by mourners. Thus, when advising the pig, one rejects such a fate; when advising oneself, one embraces it. What, then, is the difference between oneself and the pig?\n\n*Xuānduān* refers to the dark ceremonial cap. *Fáng* means to feed with fodder.",

      "translated_text": "To follow the pig in death—*duàn* is akin to *shàn*, and *dùn* refers to the stand. A stand adorned with patterns is called a *duàndùn*. *Lǚ* means \"bent,\" and what can gather things when bent are bamboo vessels like *běnjǔ*. The previous passage’s \"woven bamboo\" (*biān bó*) refers to such curved implements, confirming these too are bamboo wares. In the second year of Duke Xuān of Lu’s reign, the royal chef overcooked a bear’s paw and was executed, his body placed in a basket—precisely this kind.\n\nTo live with the nobility of *xuānmiǎn* yet die by execution, one’s body cast upon a stumbling block amid bamboo baskets and mats—this too is willingly embraced. This is what Han Yu meant by \"dwelling in filth without shame, facing execution by law without remorse.\"\n\nTo advise the pig thus, yet act so differently for oneself—this analogy is most apt.\n\nDuke Huán was hunting in the marshes when Guǎn Zhòng drove the chariot. The duke saw a *guǐ* and grasped Guǎn Zhòng’s hand, asking, \"Zhòngfù, what do you see?\" Guǎn Zhòng replied, \"Your servant sees nothing.\" The duke returned, sighing in distress, and fell ill for days, refusing to emerge. A Qi scholar named Huángzǐ Gàoáo said, \"The duke has only harmed himself—how could a *guǐ* harm him? When pent-up *qi* scatters and fails to return, it causes insufficiency. If it rises but does not descend, it makes one prone to anger; if it descends but does not rise, it makes one prone to forgetfulness. When it neither rises nor falls but lodges in the center of the body, striking the heart, it becomes illness.\" Duke Huán asked, \"Then are there *guǐ*?\" The scholar replied, \"There are. *Shěn* lurks in the depths of ditches, *Lǚ* in the hearth, *Jì* in the door’s lintel. The vexing *rǎngléi* dwells beneath the northeast, while *Bèi’ē* and *Xiélóng* leap in the northwest. *Yìyáng* resides in water, *Wǎngxiàng* in hills, *Zhēn* in mountains, *Fānghuáng* in wilds, and *Wěiyí* in marshes.\"\n\nThe duke asked, \"What is the form of *Wěiyí*?\" Huángzǐ replied, \"*Wěiyí* is as large as a wheel hub, as long as a chariot shaft, clad in purple robes with a crimson cap. As a creature, it abhors the sound of thunder and chariots—when it hears them, it clutches its head and stands. Those who see it are nearly doomed to death.\" Duke Huán laughed heartily and said, \"This is what I saw!\" He then straightened his robes and cap, sat with the scholar, and before the day’s end, his illness had vanished.\n\nThis passage resembles the tale of the \"cup serpent,\" though here the affliction is more peculiar. *Éryí* is like today’s retching, a disorder of *qi* reversal. *Fènchù* is pent-up stagnation. The illness lodges in the body’s center, striking the heart—what people now call \"mid-duct sickness.\" *Shěn* dwells in the mud of ditches, and *Lǚ* is a spirit’s name.",

Now, upon learning that those who see it are destined for hegemony, he rejoiced, and his illness vanished of its own accord. *Zhēnrán* describes the manner of his laughter.\n\nThis parable differs from the tale of seeing a pig bearing mud or a cart laden with demons.

From a distance, it resembles a wooden cock—its virtue is complete. No other cock dares challenge it; they turn and flee instead.\"\n\nTo respond to sounds or react to shadows is to have one’s heart still moved by external things. \"Fierce gaze and full *qi*\" describes its spirit and *qi* now flourishing. \"Fierce gaze yet unmoving\" contrasts with the earlier \"hollow, relying on *qi*\"—then, its *qi* was still external; now, its *qi* is internal. The word \"fierce\" conveys anger, meaning a fixed stare, distinct from the commoner’s hand-on-sword, glaring fiercely. \"Resembling a wooden cock from afar\" means its spirit and *qi* are both whole. This speaks of the art of guarding one’s *qi*, using the cock as a metaphor.\n\nConfucius observed the waters of Lüliang County, plunging thirty *rèn* deep, surging in rapids for forty *lǐ*, a torrent even *yuán*, *tuó*, fish, and turtles could not withstand.

Confucius followed and questioned him, saying, \"I took you for a spirit—yet you are a man! May I ask if there is a Dao to treading water?\"\n\nThe man replied, \"No, I have no Dao. I began with *gu*, grew with *chang*, and my nature was completed by *ming*. I enter the water in unison with its swirling eddies and emerge in rhythm with its surging currents, following the water’s Way without imposing my own will. This is how I tread it.\"\n\nConfucius asked, \"What do you mean by *gu*, *chang*, and nature completed by *ming*?\"\n\nThe man said, \"I was born on the hills and at ease with the hills—this is *gu*. I grew up in the water and am at ease with the water—this is *chang*. I do not know why I am so, yet I am so—this is *ming*.\" This analogy aligns with the earlier discussion of steering a boat, both flowing with the current. Thus, it is rooted in what is inherently so.\n\nMencius said, \"Those who speak of nature refer only to *gu*.\" Nature and *ming* are the principles of spontaneity. *Qi* refers to the water’s swirling vortex, while *gu* describes its surging turbulence—entering and exiting, rising and falling with the water. \"Following the water’s Way without imposing my own will\" means flowing with it, neither resisting nor forcing. Born on the hills, one is at ease with the hills; raised in the water, one is at ease with the water—all following their natural course without knowing why. Thus, the three terms *gu*, *chang*, and *ming* are initially indistinct, merely serving the structure of the text.

      "translated_text": "When I set out to carve the *ju*, I never dared to waste my *qi*. First, I fasted to still my mind. After three days of fasting, I no longer dared to think of rewards, rank, or emoluments. After five days, I no longer dared to think of praise or blame, skill or clumsiness. After seven days, I suddenly forgot I had limbs and a body.\n\nAt that moment, free from the court and its affairs, my skill became whole, and all external distractions dissolved. Only then did I enter the mountain forest to observe the natural patterns of the trees, their forms and structures at their fullest. Only then did the *ju* appear before me, and only then did I set my hand to it. If not for this, I would have stopped. Thus, it is the union of Heaven with Heaven that makes the work seem divine.\n\nThe *ju* resembles the *jiazhong* bell, though this has puzzled commentators, for bells are made of metal—how could carved wood achieve the same? According to the *Daguan* records, the *ju* is the stand for bells and drums, the frame from which they hang. These frames, shaped like birds or beasts and carved from wood with exquisite craftsmanship, can be seen in the *Kaogong Ji*. The phrase \"startling as if divine\" describes their unparalleled precision, beyond human ability.\n\nTo waste *qi* is to unsettle it. Fasting stills the mind, and only then does *qi* settle. Forgetting rank and reputation, forgetting limbs and body—this is guarding the pure *qi* so that external things cannot enter. \"Free from the court\" means forgetting even the existence of the court. Only thus does one’s skill become whole, and all external distractions that might disturb the mind dissolve and vanish.\n\nEntering the mountain forest to observe \"Heaven’s nature\" means observing the nature of the wood. Each tree has its own form and structure, as if already complete. Only then does one select and use it, applying one’s hand. This is uniting one’s own nature with the nature of the thing—hence, \"Heaven with Heaven.\"\n\nWhen Dongye Ji demonstrated his charioteering before Duke Zhuang, his advances and retreats aligned with the plumb line, his turns with the compass. The Duke declared that even Wen could not surpass him and ordered him to circle the field a hundred times before returning. Yan He encountered him upon his return and said, \"Ji’s horses will fail.\" The Duke kept silent and did not respond. Soon after, the horses indeed failed and returned.\n\nThe Duke asked, \"How did you know?\"\n\nYan He replied, \"His horses were exhausted, yet he still demanded more—hence, failure.\"\n\nThe six reins were woven like patterned silk, and his driving was as skillful as weaving—thus, \"even Wen could not surpass him.\" To \"circle the field a hundred times\" means driving through a hundred turns. When the horses’ strength was spent yet he still urged them on, even the most skilled driver would fail. How much less can one overtax one’s own spirit? This analogy is most apt and precise.\n\nWhen Gongchui turned his hand to draw a circle, it perfectly matched the compass and square. His fingers transformed with the object, not lingering in thought—thus, his mind was whole and unobstructed. Here, the text scatters several lines:\n\nGongchui served Gonggong—hence, \"Gongchui.\" \"Turning\" refers to the hand’s rotation. As he turned his hand to draw a circle, it was as perfect as a cover, naturally conforming to the compass. The *Kaogong Ji* states that the roundness of a cover symbolizes Heaven—thus, it is used as an analogy, not that he was actually making a cover. Like Wu Daozi painting a Buddha’s halo with a single stroke, achieving divine mastery, so too was this.\n\nTo draw a circle without a compass, using only the hand, is a skill of divine mastery. \"Fingers transforming with the object\" is like the saying on calligraphy: \"The hand knows not the brush, the brush knows not the hand.\" Hand and object forget each other, leaving no trace of thought—this is what is meant by \"the senses halt, the spirit moves.\" Thus, \"not lingering in thought.\" Some ask: if a circle matches the compass, why mention the square? They do not realize that within a true circle lies the square. A circle that does not contain a square is no circle at all.\n\nToday’s craftsmen, when carving wood into a circle, must first take a square—showing that compass and square are inseparable. Thus, it is said: \"The compass gives birth to the circle, the square.\" The \"spirit terrace\" is the mind. \"Whole\" means undivided. \"Unobstructed\" means free from constraint.",

      "translated_text": "To forget the comfort of shoes for the feet, to forget the comfort of a belt for the waist—this is the comfort of a mind that has forgotten right and wrong. Neither inwardly altered nor outwardly following, one attains the comfort of unguarded ease. At first, one seeks comfort and yet is never without it—this is the comfort of forgetting comfort itself.\n\n\"Comfort\" means peace. The feet find peace in shoes, the waist in a belt, as if no thing exists between them—thus it is said: to forget the feet, to forget the waist. This is like attaining the Dao and arriving at ease, where the inner realm remains pure and unchanging. Though one engages with things externally, one no longer knows what one is following. At first, one seeks comfort and yet is never without it—this means that with time, even the sense of comfort is forgotten. It is like feet first stepping into shoes, feeling their perfect fit, then wearing them long enough that the initial sense of comfort fades away. This is the forgetting of comfort. Such is the common experience of people, yet it illustrates the Dao. One must personally embody and investigate it to grasp how Zhuangzi exhausts the principles of things.\n\nThere was a man named Sun Xiu who came to the door, astonished, and said to Bian Qingzi: \"In my village, I am not known for cultivating conduct; in times of crisis, I am not known for courage. Yet when the fields yield no harvest, when serving a lord brings no recognition, when I am slighted in my village and driven from my district—what crime have I committed? Is this Heaven’s will?\"",

They forget their liver and gall, leave behind their ears and eyes, wandering in boundless confusion beyond the dust and grime, roaming freely in the work of no-affairs—this is called acting without reliance, growing without domination.

You have preserved your whole form, your nine orifices intact, yet halfway along the Way you are struck by deafness, blindness, lameness, and deformity—even to be counted among the ranks of people is already fortunate. How then do you have leisure to resent Heaven’s blame? Be on your way.\"\n\nSun Xiu departed, and Bianzi entered and sat. After a while, he looked up to the sky and sighed. His disciples asked, \"Master, why do you sigh?\" Bianzi said, \"Earlier, Sun Xiu came, and I told him of the Perfect Person’s virtue. I feared he would be startled and thus fall into confusion.\" The disciples said, \"Not so. If Sun Xiu’s words were right and yours were wrong, he naturally could not be confused.

The friend, delighted, ordered a servant to kill a goose and cook it. The servant asked, \"One can cackle, the other cannot.

      "translated_text": "The measure is the standard, the gauge is the rule—taking compliance with nature as the principle. Whether ascending or descending, all is permissible, for this is the ancestor of the myriad things, the origin of the myriad things. This is what Shennong and the Yellow Emperor were able to do, and thus it is called the model of Shennong and the Yellow Emperor.\n\nThe sentiments of the myriad things are private sentiments; *xun* is habituation. The *xun* of human relationships, the *xun* of human conduct—this is habituation. The following several phrases exhaustively describe human sentiments: where there is union, there is separation—so it is said, \"In the world, no feast lasts forever.\" Where there is completion, there is destruction—it is said, \"Without ruin, how could there be flourishing?\" Those who expose their jade corners will inevitably bring about their own downfall; those who stand above others will inevitably be pointed at and criticized. Those who have intent in their affairs and seek fame will surely incur the resentment of others, for many delight in their success and rejoice in their failure.\n\nThe worthy, in considering how to preserve themselves, must engage in calculation, deliberation, and planning—thus it is said, \"The worthy scheme.\" The petty man, fearing loss, will stop at nothing, resorting to deceit and fraud—thus it is said, \"The unworthy deceive.\" In worldly affairs, nothing is within one’s control—how can one be certain? Thus it is said, \"How can one be certain?\" \"Alas!\" is an exclamation over the imperfection of worldly customs, the impermanence of human affairs, and the perilous dangers that inspire awe.\n\nThese words cut to the quick of human existence, and thus I urge my disciples to take heed and not forget: only by following nature can one avoid harm—thus it is said, \"Is it not only in the realm of Dao and virtue?\"\n\nMaster Shinan Yiliao saw the Duke of Lu, who wore a troubled expression. The master asked, \"Why does my lord appear troubled?\" The Duke of Lu replied, \"I have studied your Way and cultivated the legacy of my predecessors. I revere the spirits, honor the worthy, and act with filial devotion, never straying for even a moment—yet still I cannot escape misfortune. This is why I am troubled.\"\n\nMaster Shinan said, \"My lord’s method for eliminating misfortune is too shallow. The luxuriant fox and the patterned leopard dwell in the mountains and forests, crouch in caves and grottoes—this is stillness. They move by night and rest by day—this is vigilance. Though hungry and thirsty, emaciated and distressed, they still keep their distance from the rivers and lakes, seeking food only when necessary—this is stability. Yet even so, they cannot escape the calamities of nets, traps, and snares. What crime have they committed? Their pelts are the cause of their disaster. Is the state of Lu not also my lord’s pelt? I wish for my lord to carve away his form, shed his pelt, cleanse his heart, and cast off his desires, then wander in the wilds where no one dwells. There, you will be at ease and secure.\"\n\n\"Residing in this manner, whether in use or non-use, one grasps the meaning of misfortune—it is not that misfortune should arise, yet one cannot escape it.\" *Quyue* means dwelling in seclusion; though living in deep obscurity, when hunger and thirst drive them to seek food on rivers and lakes, they still avoid others and keep their distance. This is what the ancients meant by \"lowering their heads to peck, raising them to survey all directions, dwelling in seclusion and venturing out sparingly.\" To be burdened by one’s pelt is to say that having fame and position in the world can invite disaster. These words strike deeply at the human heart—only those deeply immersed in worldly affairs can truly understand them.\n\nIn the southern lands of Yue, there is a city called the Land of Establishing Virtue. Its people are simple and unrefined, with few private desires. They know how to work but not how to hoard; they give without seeking repayment. They do not know where righteousness leads, nor where ritual conduct should go. Wild and unrestrained in their actions, they yet tread the great square. Their lives are joyful, and their deaths are fitting for burial. I wish for my lord to leave your state, abandon custom, and walk alongside the Dao.\n\nThe earlier reference to \"the wilds where no one dwells\" is the beginning of the formless. Here, it is further named the Land of Establishing Virtue. Observe how this hypothetical example is used—its origins lie in the Pure Land of later ages. During the Warring States period, the southern lands of Yue had not yet communicated with the Central States, so this place is named after them, without other significance. \"Knowing how to work but not how to hoard\" means they farm to feed themselves but do not store up private wealth. Without the names of ritual and righteousness, it is said, \"They do not know where righteousness leads, nor where ritual conduct should go.\" \"Wild and unrestrained in their actions\" means following the desires of the heart, all of which accord with the Dao—thus it is said, \"They tread the great square.\" \"Walking alongside the Dao\" means encouraging one another with a heart that admires the Dao, desiring to reach this land.\n\nThe Duke said, \"That Way is distant and perilous, with rivers and mountains in between. I have no boat or carriage—what can I do?\" Master Shinan said, \"My lord, do not be haughty in your form, do not linger in your dwelling—take this as your carriage.\" The Duke said, \"That Way is secluded and remote, with no people. With whom would I be neighbors? I have no provisions, no food—how could I reach it?\" Master Shinan said, \"Reduce your lord’s expenses, lessen your lord’s desires. Though you have no provisions, you will find sufficiency. Cross the rivers and float on the sea—gazing at it, you will not see its shores; the farther you go, the more you will not know its end. Those who see you off will turn back from the shore, and you will be far from them.\"\n\n\"Not being haughty in your form\" means not clinging to your body; \"not lingering in your dwelling\" means not clinging to your state. If you can master this mindset, you can go—thus it is said, \"Take this as your carriage.\" With no desires in the heart, nothing will be lacking—thus it is said, \"Reduce expenses, lessen desires; though you have no provisions, you will find sufficiency.\" Crossing rivers and floating on the sea, gazing without seeing its shores, going farther without knowing its end—this is merely an elaboration of the phrase \"wandering boundlessly.\" Those who see you off all turn back from the shore, and you will be far from them. This phrase is most profound: for those who study the Dao, once they have awakened, what once aided their awakening—like those who see you off boarding a boat—will have all turned back by the time they reach the sea. Whether awakening through the sound of bamboo or the rolling up of a screen, these are all \"those who see you off.\" For example, seeing a sword dance may inspire excellence in cursive script—initially, the sword aids the awakening, but once awakened, the sword becomes the one who sees you off. Reading books is also a means of being seen off.\n\nThus, those who \"have others\" are burdened; those who are \"seen by others\" are troubled. Yao neither \"had others\" nor was \"seen by others.\" I wish to remove my lord’s burdens, dispel my lord’s troubles, and wander alone with the Dao in the boundless land. When a square boat crosses a river and an empty boat comes into collision, even a man of narrow mind would not grow angry. But if there were a person on that boat, he would shout to open or close the sail—if the first shout is unheard, he would shout again, and if still unheard, he would follow with angry words. Previously, he was not angry, but now he is; previously, the boat was empty, but now it is full.\n\nThose who can empty themselves and wander through the world—who could harm them? \"Having others\" means using the self to control things; \"being seen by others\" means being controlled by things. Neither accords with the natural Dao. Yao neither used the self to control things nor was controlled by things—thus it is said, \"Yao neither had others nor was seen by others.\" The \"boundless land\" is the vast and empty expanse, the wilds where no one dwells, the Land of Establishing Virtue. This concludes the previous chapter, and the meaning being sufficient, it is followed by an analogy.",

      "translated_text": "When two boats sail side by side—this is called \"parallel boats.\" If my boat is moving and is struck by an empty boat, since the empty boat has no one aboard, even if it strikes me, I do not grow angry. But if suddenly there is someone aboard that empty boat, I would shout at them to adjust their position—\"open\" meaning to push outward, \"close\" meaning to draw back. If they do not respond to the first shout, and still do not respond after the second, by the third shout, I would surely curse them. No one aboard means emptiness; someone aboard means fullness. Previously, there was no one, so I was not angry; now, there is someone, so I cannot help but grow angry—such is human nature. This analogy is most apt, for it illustrates that if I am without intent, I will naturally not clash with things. Wandering through this world with an empty heart—what harm could befall me?\n\nHere, a grand analogy is employed, and this concluding comparison exemplifies the method of structuring a text from beginning to end. *Liezi* contains a similar analogy:\n\nWhen Beigong She levied taxes for Duke Ling of Wei to cast bells, he set up an altar outside the outer gate of the capital, and in three months, the bells were completed, suspended in upper and lower tiers. Prince Qingji saw this and asked, \"What method did you employ?\" She replied, \"In the space of unity, I dared not impose anything. I have heard that once carving and polishing are done, one returns to simplicity. How innocent he appears, how carefree! How uncertain, how vague! He sees off those departing and welcomes those arriving—arrivals are not forbidden, departures are not hindered. He follows the strong and the unyielding, adapts to the crooked, and aids them in exhausting themselves. Thus, though taxes are levied day and night, not a hair is harmed—how much more so for those on the great path?\"\n\nTo gather the people’s wealth to cast bells, one first offers sacrifices and then begins the casting—hence it is said, \"he set up an altar.\" In three months, the bells were completed. Bells have frames for suspension, and since the frames have two tiers, it is called \"upper and lower suspension.\" This refers to a set of chimes.\n\n\"What method did you employ?\" means, \"What technique allowed you to complete this so swiftly?\" \"Unity\" means singularity. Following the principle of nature, beginning and end remain purely one, without any admixture—hence it is said, \"In the space of unity, I dared not impose anything,\" meaning nothing else could be inserted here.\n\n\"Once carving and polishing are done, one returns to simplicity\" means removing the sharp edges to return to naturalness. \"How innocent he appears\" describes a state of no knowledge. \"How carefree!\"",
      "overlap_context": "g others\" means using the self to control things; \"being seen by others\" means being controlled by things. Neither accords with the natural Dao. Yao neither used the self to control things nor was controlled by things—thus it is said, \"Yao neither had others nor was seen by others.\" The \"boundless land\" is the vast and empty expanse, the wilds where no one dwells, the Land of Establishing Virtue. This concludes the previous chapter, and the meaning being sufficient, it is followed by an analogy.",

      "translated_text": "If slack, if hesitant—this is the state of having no room for intention. Sometimes coming, sometimes going, neither leading nor following—hence it is said, \"gathered yet scattered, boundless yet formless.\" \"Gathered\" conveys the sense of a clod of earth; \"boundless\" describes the state of nothingness.

Taigong Ren went to console him, saying, \"You nearly died, did you not?\" Confucius replied, \"Yes.\" \"Do you detest death?\" \"Yes.\" Ren said, \"I once spoke of the way to avoid death. In the Eastern Sea there is a bird called *Yidai*. As a bird, it flies weakly and feebly, as if incapable. When taking flight, it relies on others to lead; when perching, it is pressed and constrained. It dares not advance first nor retreat last; in feeding, it dares not taste first but must take the leavings. For this reason, it is never singled out in formation, and others ultimately cannot harm it—thus it escapes misfortune. The straight tree is the first felled; the sweet well is the first drained. You, sir, cultivate knowledge to startle the foolish, refine your conduct to expose the tainted—shining brightly as if carrying the sun and moon in your stride, how could you avoid peril? Long ago, I heard from a man of great completion: 'Those who boast of themselves achieve no merit; those who achieve merit ruin their names; those who attain fame stumble. Who can relinquish merit and fame and return to the common? The Dao flows yet remains obscure; one attains it yet is unrecognized; one acts yet is unnamed.' Pure and constant, one is likened to the mad—erasing traces, discarding influence, and not pursuing merit or fame. Thus, no one can reproach him, nor does he reproach others. The perfected man remains unknown—why should you rejoice?\"\n\nConfucius said, \"Excellent!\" He then parted from his acquaintances, dismissed his disciples, and fled to the great marshlands. Dressed in coarse cloth, feeding on acorns and chestnuts, he entered among beasts without disturbing their herds, among birds without disrupting their flocks. Neither birds nor beasts shunned him—how much less would men? \"Do you detest death?\" means: in such dire straits, does your heart also loathe them? \"The way to avoid death\" refers to self-contentment free from calamity.\n\n*Yidai* is today’s swallow. *Fenfen-zhizhi* describes its manner of flight. \"Drawing support\" means flying in flocks. \"Pressed and constrained in perching\" means nesting near humans. \"Daring not advance first nor retreat last\" means it does not contend in coming and going. *Xu* means leavings—taking insects that others have discarded. \"Not singled out\" means it is not numerous.",

      "translated_text": "Though they form ranks, they are not as numerous as the flocks of crows and geese. Each relies on human households, yet others do not harm them—this is the metaphor of the straight tree and the sweet well, which become known by their very nature.\n\nThe *Greatly Accomplished* is one who embodies the great Dao, a scholar of the Way. Those who boast and claim merit will never succeed; those who delight in fame and achievement will ultimately harm themselves. *Huikui*—all self-inflicted damage. \"Returning to speak with the multitude\" means withdrawing to be as one with them. Moving in accord with the Dao, one remains dim and self-effacing. Thus it is said: the flow of the Dao is not manifest. Though one may act according to one’s will in the moment, one does not exalt oneself through fame. Thus it is said: when dwelling in what is fitting, one acts without claiming a place; when not dwelling in what is fitting, one does not possess it. *Chunchun* and *changchang* are one and the same—comparable to madness, as if without mind. Erasing one’s traces, relinquishing power, and setting aside thoughts of merit and fame—this is transformation without leaving a mark. I do not reproach others, and others forget me: such is the *Perfect Person*. If the Perfect Person desires no renown in the world, why should you, Master, rejoice in fame?\n\nThe final lines echo the passage where \"eating pork is like eating human flesh,\" borrowing Confucius’s name to expound the teaching—this is reiteration for emphasis.\n\nConfucius asked Zisang Hu, \"I was twice exiled from Lu, had my tree felled in Song, erased my traces in Wei, and was impoverished in Shang and Zhou, besieged between Chen and Cai. Having endured these many hardships, my close associates grew more distant, and my disciples and friends scattered. Why is this?\"\n\nZisang Hu replied, \"Have you not heard of the man of Jia who fled? Lin Hui abandoned a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a newborn child and flee. Someone asked, 'Was it for the sake of its value? The child’s value is slight. Was it for the sake of its burden? The child’s burden is great. Why abandon a jade disc worth a thousand gold pieces to carry a child and flee?' Lin Hui said, 'The jade was bound by profit; the child was bound by Heaven. Those bound by profit abandon one another in straits, calamity, and harm. Those bound by Heaven gather together in straits, calamity, and harm. The difference between gathering and abandoning is vast. Moreover, the friendship of the noble is as bland as water; the friendship of the petty is as sweet as sweet wine. The noble are bland yet intimate; the petty are sweet yet easily severed. Those who unite without cause will part without cause.'\"\n\nConfucius said, \"I respectfully receive your instruction.\" He walked slowly and wandered home, abandoned his learning, discarded his books, and his disciples no longer bowed before him, yet their affection for him deepened.\n\n*Zisang Hu* is *Hu* (door). *Jiaren* refers to a man of a fictitious state. Abandoning the jade and carrying the child is the finest metaphor: those bound by Heaven must always gather, while those bound by profit must abandon one another. The friendship of the noble is bland yet intimate; the friendship of the petty is sweet yet easily severed—this exhausts the human condition. Though these words are spoken of others, Mencius also said, \"Those who unite without cause will part without cause,\" as seen in the *Odes of Bin*. This line is another fine thread of coherence. \"No longer bowing before him\" means not being constrained by the formalities of bowing in his presence, yet their mutual affection grew deeper.\n\nAnother day, Zisang Hu said, \"When Shun was about to die, he truly admonished Yu, saying, 'Be vigilant! In form, nothing surpasses following; in emotion, nothing surpasses compliance. Following, one does not depart; complying, one does not labor. Not departing, not laboring—then one does not seek adornment to match form. Not seeking adornment to match form—then one does not depend on external things.'\"\n\n*Ling* (clear) is pronounced *ling* (to understand). He instructed Yu with the true and real Dao, hence \"truly admonished.\" *Yuan* means to follow its natural course; *shuai* means to comply with its natural tendency. Not departing is to be one with the Dao. *Xing* (form) is the self; *wen* (adornment) is what is external to the self. Not using what is external to adorn the self—thus it is said, \"one does not seek adornment to match form.\" Today, when people host guests, they say \"to await guests\"—this is the meaning of *dai* (to await). Not using external adornments means having no need for things. Thus it is said, \"one fundamentally does not depend on things.\" This *dai* (to await) is the sense of \"not using.\" The three instances of *dai* take on two meanings.\n\nZhuangzi wore a robe of coarse cloth patched with hemp, tied his shoes with cords, and passed by the King of Wei. The king said, \"Why is the Master so weary?\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"It is poverty, not weariness. When a scholar possesses the Dao and virtue but cannot put them into practice, this is weariness. Wearing tattered clothes and threadbare shoes is poverty, not weariness. This is what is called 'not encountering the right time.' Have you alone not seen the gibbon? When it obtains *nan*, *zi*, *yu*, and *zhang* trees, it grasps the vines, swings through the branches, and reigns supreme among them—even Yi or Peng Meng could not take aim at it. Yet when it finds itself among thorny *zhe*, *ji*, *zhi*, and *gou* trees, it moves cautiously, glances warily, trembles and quakes. Not that its sinews and bones have suddenly stiffened and lost their suppleness, but the circumstances are unfavorable, and it cannot display its abilities. Now, dwelling among dark rulers and chaotic ministers, how could one not be weary? This is like the heart of Bi Gan being carved out—clear proof!\"\n\n*Dabu* is coarse cloth; *zheng* (to tie) is a belt. *Kuai* (to fasten) is tied in a knot at the waist. *Xilü* means the shoes are worn out and strung together with cords. *Bei* means affliction. *Lan* means to grasp; *man* means to entwine. These two words describe the gibbon in the trees—it is not careless. *Wangchang* means its spirit is exuberant and its will fulfilled. *Zhe*, *ji*, *zhi*, and *gou* are thorny trees. *Zhendong* means fear; *daoli* means trembling. The phrase \"not supple\" is preceded by \"suddenly stiffened\"—this is excellent. Medical texts describe a condition of stiff neck and back, which is stiffened and not supple. Using this to describe the gibbon is especially vivid. *Zheng* (proof) means to compare Bi Gan’s case to show its verification—these three words are also striking.\n\nConfucius was stranded between Chen and Cai, going seven days without cooking a meal. Leaning on a withered tree with his left hand and striking its withered branches with his right, he sang the airs of the *Yan* clan. There was the form of the song but not its meter, the sound but not the tones of gong and jue. The sound of wood and the sound of man blended harmoniously, resonating deeply in the hearts of others. Yan Hui stood with hands clasped and turned his gaze to observe. Fearing that Hui would exalt him and thereby reach excess, or love him and thereby reach sorrow, Confucius said, \"Hui, it is easy not to suffer the harm of Heaven, but difficult not to benefit from men. Nothing begins that does not end. Man and Heaven are one. Who is it that sings now?\"\n\n*Gaomu* is a withered tree; *gaozhi* is a withered branch, as in the *Qiwulun* (\"The Equality of Things\"), where it is called *fangzhi*. Striking the withered branch against the withered tree—thus it is said, \"there was the form.\" Though he struck, there was no rhythm, hence \"not its meter.\" Without gong and jue, it means not conforming to the five tones. The sound of wood is the striking; the sound of man is the singing. *Liran* means precise and fitting. *Guangji* means to honor me. If one seeks from the intention of honoring me, what is reached has no bounds—thus it is said, \"fearing that he would exalt me and thereby reach excess.\" If one ponders from the intention of loving me, it must lead to sorrow—thus it is said, \"loving me and thereby reaching sorrow.\" *Zao* is pronounced *cuo*. \"Man and Heaven are one\" means that what is in me is all Heavenly principle. The singer now is not me—thus it is said, \"Who is it?\"",

      "translated_text": "Yan Hui said, \"May I ask how to remain untouched by Heaven’s diminishment?\"\nConfucius replied, \"Hunger and thirst, cold and heat, constraints and blockages—these are the movements of Heaven and Earth, the outflow of the turning of things. To speak of going along with them is what is meant. As a minister, one does not dare abandon them; holding to the Dao of the minister is already thus—how much more so for how one awaits Heaven? What is meant by remaining untouched by man’s augmentation is difficult?\"\nConfucius replied, \"At first, one’s path opens in four directions; ranks and emoluments arrive together without end—what things deem beneficial is not one’s own. My mandate lies in what is external. The noble man does not act as a thief; the worthy does not act as a bandit. If I were to take these, what would I do? Thus it is said: No bird is wiser than the swallow. What its eyes deem unsuitable, it does not even glance at; though the fruit falls before it, it abandons it and flees—such is its awe. Yet it nests among men, and the altars of state endure. What do you mean by ‘there is no beginning that is not an end’?\"\nConfucius replied, \"The myriad things transform, yet one does not know who succeeds them. One knows where they end; one knows where they begin—simply align with them and await them, that is all. What is meant by ‘man and Heaven are one’?\"\nConfucius replied, \"There is man, and there is Heaven; there is also Heaven alone. That man cannot possess Heaven’s nature—this is why the sage calmly embodies the passing and comes to rest. *Tian sun* means adversity in time; *wu shou* means poverty yet joy. *Ren yi* means the conferral of wealth and honor; *wu shou* means wealth and honor without excess. Ordinary discourse holds that remaining unexcessive amid wealth and honor is easy, while finding joy in poverty is difficult. Yet Zhuangzi reverses this—how profoundly meaningful! In times of Heaven’s diminishment, affairs do not proceed by one’s will. Though one may wish not to receive, how can one not receive? One cannot but endure poverty. Thus it is said to be easy. As for man’s augmentation, as wealth arrives daily and rank rises daily, increasing month by month, I wish to decline yet cannot. Thus honor does not await arrogance to become arrogant; wealth does not await extravagance to become extravagant. Thus it is said to be difficult. *Qiong zhi* means blockage and obstruction; *bu xing* means one cannot push them away. *Yun wu* means the turning of qi.\"",

      "translated_text": "Release and dispersion—this is the outflow of the turning of things, the coming and going of the numerical cycles of qi, which is Heaven’s doing. I too move in concert with it, and thus too am released with it. Hence it is said, \"to depart together,\" which is precisely what is meant by \"moving in step with the times\" and \"reaching the limit together with the times.\" The lord’s command to his minister cannot be disobeyed—how then can man disobey the command of Heaven? This is the meaning of \"ease in receiving nothing.\"\n\n\"Fourfold reach\" means that wherever the mind turns, there is no obstruction. \"First use\" means that as soon as this mind stirs, affairs follow and gather without obstruction. \"Arriving together without exhaustion\" and \"converging without cease\" describe this. I do not seek the profit of things, yet profit comes of itself—hence it is said, \"not of oneself.\" Rank and emolument both come from without, brought about by the timing of fate. Thus it is said, \"My fate lies outside myself.\" A gentleman feels shame at receiving emolument without merit, regarding it as theft. Though I may wish not to accept it, there is that which cannot be pushed away. When Gongsun He was appointed minister, he wept—was this not a case of one who could not receive, finding the augmentation of man difficult?\n\nThe *yiyi* is indolence of intent. \"Insufficient to regard\" means not worth looking at. A place not fitting for one’s dwelling—though the eye may see it, one still dismisses it as unworthy of regard and departs. When the fruit falls, the bird must take flight in alarm, fearing harm to itself. Thus it is said, \"Abandoning it, it flees.\" Though its intent is to avoid man, it ends up dwelling near him—hence it is said, \"nesting among men,\" meaning it enters their midst. The altars of soil and grain, though nothing to fear, are also nothing to take; people respect and preserve them. The swallow in a household, though neither beneficial nor harmful, is still tolerated. This suggests that if one in wealth and honor could be like the *yiyi*—neither beneficial nor harmful—then none would revile or despise him. Yet once called wealthy and honored, how can one be without benefit or harm? Hence it is said to be difficult.\n\n\"Without beginning yet not without end\" means one knows neither its start nor its finish. The transformations of the ten thousand things succeed one another in turn—who knows their end, who knows their beginning? One simply abides in the center and awaits them. This is the true mean, dwelling within the workings of creation.\n\nWhat does it mean to say \"man and Heaven are one\"? Man is what Heaven produces—hence it is said, \"There is man, and there is Heaven.\" Heaven too is what creation makes—hence it is said, \"There is Heaven, and there is Heaven.\" Nature is the nature mandated by Heaven. This character *xing* (nature) is the same as *sheng* (life): what man’s nature and life possess from birth are all received from Heaven. How could man presume to interfere? The sage alone knows what man cannot possess, and thus abides in it with equanimity, exhausting his years to the full. Mencius said, \"This is nature, yet there is fate in it. The gentleman does not call it nature\"—meaning precisely that man cannot possess Heaven’s nature.\n\n\"Composed and at ease\"—this is to dwell in accord with the times and follow their course to the end of one’s days. Hence it is said, \"embodying the passing and coming to an end.\"\n\nZhuang Zhou was wandering in the thicket of Diaoling when he saw an unusual magpie coming from the south. Its wings spanned seven feet, its eyes measured an inch across, and it brushed past Zhou’s forehead before alighting in the chestnut grove. Zhuang Zhou said, \"What bird is this? Its wings are vast yet it does not fly far, its eyes are large yet it does not see clearly.\" He hitched up his robe, strode forward, took up his sling, and waited. He saw a cicada that had just found a fine shade and forgotten itself; a mantis, seizing the opportunity, grabbed it, forgetting its own form in its eagerness. The strange magpie, seeing its advantage, swooped in for the gain, forgetting its true nature in pursuit of profit. Zhuang Zhou shuddered and said, \"Ah! Things indeed entrap one another—two creatures summoning disaster upon themselves.\" He cast aside his sling and turned to flee, but the gamekeeper pursued him with curses.\n\nZhuang Zhou returned home and for three months did not emerge into the courtyard. Lin Qie asked him, \"Master, why have you been so withdrawn of late?\" Zhuang Zhou replied, \"I guarded my form yet forgot myself. I gazed into muddy water and became lost in clear depths. Moreover, I have heard from the Master that one should enter a custom and follow it. Now I wandered in Diaoling and forgot myself; the strange magpie brushed my forehead, and I wandered in the chestnut grove, forgetting my true nature. The gamekeeper of the chestnut grove took me for a thief—I am thus withdrawn.\" Diaoling is a place name; *fan* refers to the garden’s fence. \"Brushed Zhou’s forehead\" means it flew past his brow. *Yin* means vast; *shi* means to depart.",

As for man’s augmentation, as wealth arrives daily and rank rises daily, increasing month by month, I wish to decline yet cannot. Thus honor does not await arrogance to become arrogant; wealth does not await extravagance to become extravagant. Thus it is said to be difficult. *Qiong zhi* means blockage and obstruction; *bu xing* means one cannot push them away. *Yun wu* means the turning of qi.\"",

Holding the sling and lingering, he sought to seize the prey. The mantis, intent on the cicada, was so fixated on gaining it that it forgot its own form; the strange magpie, in turn, coveted the mantis and forgot its true nature. Thus arose the state of neither advancing nor seeing. Mantis and magpie, though of different kinds, summoned one another—both forgot their form, forgot their true nature, and so became entangled.\n\nThe gamekeeper, guardian of the garden, cursed and berated him. *Not emerging into the courtyard* means not stepping into the open space before one’s dwelling. To *guard the form* is to cultivate life. I, who study the cultivation of life, carelessly pursued the magpie and forgot myself—this is to be led by desire and thus drowned in delusion. *Muddy water* is a metaphor for human desire; *clear depths* for the heavenly principle. The *Master* is Laozi. *Entering a state and inquiring into its customs* means learning its prohibitions—thus it is said, \"Enter its custom and follow its custom.\" Another’s garden, into which I mistakenly wandered, is a transgression of the prohibition. *Took me for a thief* means I was humiliated by the gamekeeper.\n\nThis is but an allegory: whether great or small, all things that are pursued lead to delusion—this is a maxim for the scholar’s practice.",

When others act without the Dao, he merely adjusts his countenance to awaken them, and their misguided intentions dissolve. How could one such as Xi Gong be worthy of praise?”\n\nYangzi Fang departed. The marquis, lost in thought, remained silent the entire day.

Wenbo Xuezi said: “In the past, he sought to see me; now, he seeks to see me again—he must have something to invigorate me.” He went out to meet the guest and, upon returning, sighed. The next day, he met the guest again and, upon returning, sighed once more. His servant asked: “Every time you meet this guest, you return and sigh. Why is that?” He replied: “I already told you: the people of the Central States are enlightened in ritual and righteousness but coarse in understanding the human heart. Those who came to see me before moved with the precision of compass and square, their demeanor now like a dragon, now like a tiger. Their admonitions were as a son’s, their guidance as a father’s—this is why I sighed.”\n\nConfucius met him but did not speak. Zilu said: “You have long wished to see Wenbo Xuezi.

      "translated_text": "Yet your seeking treats it as something existent—this is like searching for a horse in a roadside market. I submit to you utterly, and you forget utterly what I submit. Yet why should you fret? Though forgotten, there remains within me what cannot be forgotten. Without comparison, it naturally pervades all; words need not rely on close affinity for its truth to spread in perfect harmony. What has no form cannot be traced by name. The people tread forward—words alone draw them to return.\n\nBy this, one measures the Master’s unattainability. “Yet unaware of why it is so”—these words mean I have reached a point where I no longer know how it is. Galloping, flying, racing—leaving dust behind in such swift departure that no trace remains. Staring with wide eyes—all who walk, hasten, or race use the horse as their metaphor.\n\n“How could one not examine this?” means one must scrutinize it with precision. “The death of the heart” means seeing nothing. To live yet see nothing is worse than death. Thus it is said: “No sorrow is greater than the death of the heart, and the death of a person is secondary to it.”\n\n“Can be measured”—when the sun is bright, the length and size of all things can be fully seen. Thus it is said: “None do not follow this pattern.” Rising in the east and setting in the west—from dawn to dusk. Creatures with eyes and limbs—all living things—must see the sun before their affairs can proceed. They depend on it, depend on the sun. Thus it is said: “They depend upon it to accomplish their ends.” When it emerges, they exist; when it sets, they perish. Human affairs rise and fall with the sun’s movement—rising to work at sunrise, resting at sunset. The myriad things’ dependence on the Dao is like human affairs’ dependence on the sun. Thus it is said: “The myriad things are thus.” Life and death both follow the Dao’s natural course. Thus it is said: “Death, too, depends upon it, as does life.”\n\nOnce born and receiving this form, the Dao abides within the body without change, awaiting its end. Thus it is said: “Once I received this completed form, I did not transform but awaited its end.” To “effect” means to imitate. To act in imitation of things without allowing the heart to interfere. Thus it is said: “Moving in response to things.” “Without pause” means without interruption. “Unaware of where it would conclude” means without end. Harmoniously, this body embodies nothing but the principle of compliance. Thus it is said: “Vaporously, this form took shape.” Though knowing all things are fated, in daily life one does not use fate as a measure—this is what is meant by “the sage does not speak of fate.” “With each passing day” means each day is like this, advancing together without cease. “To have walked alongside you for a lifetime” means standing side by side. Having accompanied you all my life, yet you have not attained this Dao. Thus it is said: “Only to lose you in the span of an arm’s length.”\n\n“Illumination” refers to what is visible. You see only what I make visible, unaware of what remains unseen. Thus it is said: “You are on the verge of illumination.” “What I have illuminated”—exhaustion means nothingness. The Dao must reach nothingness before it is complete. You seek it as something existent, so you cannot see its completion. Thus it is said: “What I have illuminated—it has already come to its end.”\n\n“Yet your seeking treats it as something existent”—a market is a place for selling horses. “Tang” refers to a roofless structure, as in the *Book of Songs*: “In the central hall, there are tiles.” Today, it would be called a roadside pavilion. Those who sell horses come and go unpredictably; to seek one in such a market is like carving a mark on a boat to find a lost sword.\n\n“Forgetting” means beyond knowing. “Utterly forgotten” means reaching the limit of the unknowable. What I submit to you must reach the limit of the unknowable, and what you submit to me must also reach the limit of the unknowable. Thus it is said: “I submit to you utterly, and you forget utterly what I submit.” This means that this matter cannot be explained to you, nor can you explain it to me—it must reach the point of forgetting words before it is complete.\n\nYet, turning further: though you have not yet reached this point, why should you worry? Since you now know the one who gallops away leaving no dust, staring in astonishment, you have grasped one layer of understanding, though not yet the whole. If you can forget what you once knew, even if my present state differs from what you see today, what remains unforgotten within me endures. As the Buddhists say: “After awakening, one still relies on what was known before.” Some believe that only when one sees nothingness is the Dao complete, yet this “nothingness” is still a kind of “something.” Thus it is said: “Though forgotten, there remains within me what cannot be forgotten.”\n\nThese two instances of “I” refer to Yan Hui’s own experience, differing from the earlier “I submit to you” and “you forget what I submit.” Confucius visited Lao Dan, who had just washed his hair and was letting it dry, sitting solemnly as if not human. Confucius withdrew and waited. After a while, he saw Lao Dan and said: “Was I deluded, or is it true? Just now, Master, your form was withered like dry wood, as if you had left the world of men and stood in solitude.”\n\nLao Dan said: “I let my heart wander in the beginning of things.”\nConfucius said: “What do you mean?”\nLao Dan replied: “My heart is blocked and cannot know; my mouth is shut and cannot speak. Let me try to explain it to you.”",

To have walked alongside you for a lifetime, only to lose you in the span of an arm’s length—how could this not be sorrowful? You are on the verge of illumination. What I have illuminated—it has already come to its end.”",

      "translated_text": "The most yin arrives with solemn stillness; the most yang blazes with radiant brilliance. This solemn stillness emerges from Heaven; this radiant brilliance arises from Earth. When the two intermingle and harmonize, things come into being. Some call this their governing principle, yet none see its form—its ebb and flow fill emptiness and fullness, its darkening and brightening alternate like day and night. Things transform daily, yet none see its work. Life has its sprouting; death has its return. Beginning and end stand opposed, yet without origin, and none know where it ends. If not this, then what is its source?\n\nLetting the hair loose to dry—this is what *Li Sao* calls \"drying the hair.\" *Zhire* describes the stillness of standing in concentration, as if not human, still unpaired with others. *Juewu* means rigid and unmoving. *Yiwu* means leaving external things behind; *liren* means leaving the crowd of people; standing in solitude means rising above the world’s common measure.\n\n\"The beginning of things\" refers to the origin before things existed. *Pi* means closed—when the heart knows nothing, the mouth desires no speech, hence \"blocked\" and \"shut.\" \"Near\" means approaching, for the profound and wondrous are hard to express, so one can only approximate their semblance. Thus it is said: \"Let me try to explain it to you.\" The earlier \"its\" and \"its wind\" refer to this transformation of phrasing.\n\nSolemn stillness and radiant brilliance—these are the meanings of yin and yang, which is what is called the Dao. Thus, the four lines below: when yin and yang harmonize, the myriad things are born. They intermingle and interact, for yin alone cannot generate, nor yang alone complete—hence \"intermingle and harmonize.\" *Ji* means the guiding thread, the principal support, as if something governs yet remains unseen. Thus: \"Some call this their governing principle, yet none see its form.\" The one who governs is the work of creation.\n\nOne darkening, one brightening—these are day and night. The ebb and flow of fullness and emptiness—these are the movements of the four seasons. Things change daily, yet none see its work. Each day it acts thus, and the work of creation—who can name it? Beginning and end are not the same, yet their origin cannot be traced. For example, the sparrow transforming into a clam: the sparrow’s end is the clam’s beginning, and the clam’s beginning is the sparrow’s end. Even in the grand succession of emperors, it is the same. How can one see it all? Thus: \"Beginning and end stand opposed, yet without origin, and none know where it ends.\" This clearly speaks of the Creator, yet without naming it, it then says: \"If not this, then what is its source?\" The source is the Creator; the source is also the Creator. It says: \"If not this, then what is its master?\" This is how Zhuangzi’s writing lives—every sentence is like this.\n\nConfucius said: \"May I ask about this wandering?\"\nLao Dan said: \"To attain this is the utmost beauty, the utmost joy. To attain the utmost beauty and wander in the utmost joy—this is called the Perfect Person.\"\nConfucius said: \"I wish to hear the method.\"\nLao Dan said: \"Beasts that eat grass do not dislike changing marshes; creatures that live in water do not dislike changing streams. They undergo small changes but do not lose their great constancy. Joy and anger, sorrow and happiness do not enter their breasts. For the world is where the myriad things are one. To grasp this oneness and be the same as it—then the four limbs and hundred bones become dust and dirt, and life and death, beginning and end become like day and night, which cannot disturb it. How much less can the distinctions of gain and loss, fortune and misfortune? One who discards rank is like one who discards mud and dirt, knowing the body is nobler than rank. Nobility lies within me and does not lose itself in change. Moreover, the myriad transformations have no end—how could they trouble the heart of one who has attained the Dao?\n\nThis is the praise of the utmost beauty and joy of the Dao. \"Do not dislike\" means not being weary. \"Small changes\" refers to changing marshes and streams. \"Not losing their great constancy\" means their water and grass remain. The life of the myriad things all lies under Heaven, so one must follow Heaven’s doing—how can one be different? Thus: \"The world is where the myriad things are one.\" Knowing this oneness comes from Heaven and is no different, then not even life and death can disturb the heart—how much less gain and loss, fortune and misfortune? *Jie* means a splinter or obstacle. *Dian* means a servant or subordinate.",

      "translated_text": "The servant discards and comes as one discards mud and mire—because I am noble while they are base. Yet if one knows that the true nobility of the Dao lies within oneself, how could the transformations of the myriad things ever strip away one’s utmost beauty and joy? Between Heaven and Earth, change follows upon change, and so it has been for ten thousand ages—when will it ever end? Gain and loss, fortune and misfortune are nothing but the natural course—how could they trouble the heart? Thus it is said: \"The myriad transformations have no end.\" Who, then, could disturb the heart? Only those who unite their person with the Dao can truly understand this.\n\nThis is the self—when the self and the Dao are one, it is called \"the self attaining the Dao.\" Confucius said: \"The Master’s virtue matched Heaven and Earth, yet he still relied on profound words to cultivate his heart—how could the noble men of old have been free of this?\" Lao Dan replied: \"Not so. Water, when drawn, does nothing yet its nature is spontaneous. The perfected person’s virtue requires no cultivation, yet things cannot depart from it. Just as Heaven is naturally high, Earth naturally thick, and the sun and moon naturally bright—what need is there for cultivation?\" Confucius went out and told Yan Hui: \"My grasp of the Dao is like a gnat in vinegar—how slight the Master’s words have revealed to me! I did not know the great wholeness of Heaven and Earth.\"\n\n*Jiajie* means to borrow. *Zhiyan* refers to the many words above. It means that even Laozi, with such virtue, could not depart from words to cultivate his heart—how could others escape this? *Shuo* means to be free, the same as *tuo*. Lao Dan’s \"Not so\" means that relying on words to cultivate the heart is mistaken. *Zhuo* means to draw, the same as *zhuo*. The rivers and seas can be drawn from endlessly because their essence is effortless and natural. *Cai* means nature—water is water because of its natural essence. The perfected person’s virtue is rooted in spontaneity; though it requires no cultivation, external things cannot separate from it. Heaven, Earth, the sun, and moon are also natural—what room is there for effort? Thus it is said: \"What need is there for cultivation?\" *Ximei* are midges in vinegar, confined within the jar—how could they know the vastness beyond? This speaks of narrow vision.\n\nZhuangzi saw Duke Ai of Lu. The Duke said: \"Lu has many Ru scholars but few who follow your *fang*.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Lu has few Ru.\" The Duke said: \"The whole state of Lu wears Ru robes—how can you say there are few?\" Zhuangzi said: \"I have heard that the Ru wear round caps to know the seasons, square shoes to know the earth’s forms, and jade pendants that move slowly to decide matters when they arise. Those who possess the Dao are not necessarily known by their robes, and those who wear the robes do not necessarily know the Dao. If you truly do not believe me, why not issue a decree throughout the state: 'Those without this Dao who wear these robes will be put to death'?\" The Duke issued the decree, and after five days, no one in Lu dared wear Ru robes. Only one man, dressed as a Ru, stood at the palace gate. The Duke summoned him and questioned him on state affairs, and his answers were inexhaustible, shifting through a thousand turns without end. Zhuangzi said: \"With only one Ru in Lu, can you call that many?\"\n\n*Fang* refers to methods—it means the Ru of Lu practiced different arts from the Master. *Huan pei jue* means their movements were slow and they wore jade pendants. *Jue* takes its meaning from decisiveness. *One husband* refers to Confucius. The implication is that many wear Ru robes but do not know the Dao.\n\nBaili Xi’s rank and salary did not enter his heart, so he fed cattle and made them fat. This caused Duke Mu of Qin to forget his lowly status and entrust him with governance. The Lord of Yu disregarded life and death, so he could move others. When feeding cattle, did he have any thought of seeking rank or salary? It was precisely because he did not seek them that he was employed by Duke Mu. *Moving others* means influencing and transforming them. *Disregarding life and death* means acting without acting, the heart undisturbed. Here, these two lines are spoken casually.\n\nWhen the Lord of Song was about to have a painting made, all the artists arrived, bowed, and stood ready. Half of them were outside preparing brushes and ink. One artist arrived late, unhurried, did not bow, and did not stand still. He was given lodging, and when the Lord sent someone to observe him, he was found sitting with his clothes off, legs sprawled. The Lord said: \"He is the true painter.\"\n\n*Chanchán* means leisurely and at ease. *Receiving the bow without standing* means he returned the bow but did not remain still. *Panbo* describes sitting with legs spread. *Luo* means bare. This speaks of having no mind for seeking recognition—only then is one a true painter. Su Dongpo’s description of painting bamboo—\"With spirit at ease and will settled, one stroke completes it\"—approaches this idea.\n\nKing Wen observed at Zang and saw a man fishing. Yet his fishing was no ordinary fishing—where he cast his line, there was indeed fishing. This was constant fishing.",

He wished to release him and let him go, yet could not bear that the people would be left without a ruler. Thus, at dawn, he gathered his ministers and said: \"Formerly, I dreamed of a worthy man, dark of complexion and with a prominent forehead, riding a piebald horse with one red hoof. He declared: 'Entrust governance to the Elder of Zang—perhaps the people may yet recover.'\"\n\nThe ministers, startled, said: \"This was your late father, the former king.\"\n\nKing Wen replied: \"Then let us divine his will.\"\n\nThe ministers said: \"The former king’s command leaves no room for doubt—what need is there for divination?\"\n\nThereupon, they welcomed the Elder of Zang and entrusted him with governance. No statutes were altered, no decrees were issued. After three years, King Wen surveyed the realm and saw that the ranks of scholars had dissolved, factions had scattered, and officials no longer cultivated virtue. *Yǔ*-measures and *hú*-bushels dared not cross the four borders. When the ranks of scholars dissolved and factions scattered, unity prevailed. When officials no longer cultivated virtue, their duties aligned. When *yǔ*-measures and *hú*-bushels dared not cross the borders, the feudal lords harbored no divided loyalties.\n\nKing Wen then bowed northward and, addressing him as Grand Preceptor, asked: \"Can this governance extend to all under Heaven?\"\n\nThe Elder of Zang gave no response, then casually excused himself from court.

      "translated_text": "Shoulder Wu asked Sunshu Ao, “You have thrice served as Prime Minister yet shown no elation, and thrice been dismissed without a trace of sorrow. At first I doubted you, but now I see your face suffused with ease—how do you alone manage this in your heart?”\n\nSunshu Ao replied, “How do I surpass others? I accept that what comes cannot be refused, and what goes cannot be halted. I regard gain and loss as no concern of mine, and so remain untroubled. How do I surpass others? Moreover, I do not know whether honor or disgrace lies with them or with me—whether it is theirs to lose or mine to lose. While I hesitate and look about in all directions, how can I find time to weigh what men call noble or base?”\n\nThe ease in his face arose not from external things but from within, from a spirit that nourished itself. If the honor of the Prime Ministership belonged to the office itself, it had no bearing on me; if what was noble in me belonged to me, it had no bearing on the office. Thus he said: “Is it theirs to lose, or mine? Is it mine to lose, or theirs?” These words capture the essence. To hesitate and look about is to gaze far into the vastness of heaven and earth—how could one know what men call noble or base?\n\nWhen Confucius heard of this, he said: “The true persons of old could not be swayed by the persuasions of the wise, seduced by the allure of beauty, robbed by bandits, or befriended by Fuxi or the Yellow Emperor. Life and death are great matters indeed, yet they remained unchanged—how much less would they be moved by rank or emolument? Such persons pass through the great mountains without obstruction, enter deep springs without getting wet, dwell in lowly and narrow places without weariness, and fill heaven and earth, ever more abundant even as they give to others.\n\nThe wise cannot sway them, for words cannot exhaust their depth. Beauty cannot seduce them, for sensual pleasures cannot corrupt their integrity. Bandits cannot rob them, for force cannot bend their will. Fuxi and the Yellow Emperor could not befriend them, for they withdrew from the world and held it lightly. *Jie* means obstruction, like a stone that, though seamless, can be drilled through. Thus it is said they pass through the great mountains without obstruction. Dwelling in poverty and lowliness, they do not take it as affliction. Thus it is said they dwell in narrow places without weariness. To fill heaven and earth is the Dao. When the Dao within oneself is already full, it extends to transform others, and its use is inexhaustible. Thus it is said: ‘Even as they give to others, they become ever more abundant.’\n\nThe King of Chu was seated with the Lord of Fan. After a while, the King’s attendants said, ‘Fan has perished three times.’ The Lord of Fan said, ‘The perishing of Fan is not enough to diminish what I possess. If the perishing of Fan is not enough to diminish what I possess, then the survival of Chu is not enough to preserve what I am.’ From this perspective, Fan has never truly perished, and Chu has never truly existed.”\n\nThis is like the man who, though his foot was cut off, still valued his foot—only here, the analogy shifts to say that the Dao within oneself is unaffected by whether one has a state or not. If Fan’s loss does not mean loss, and Chu’s survival does not mean survival, then the world’s gains and losses, fortunes and misfortunes, are all external things. Yet the meaning still hinges on the phrase “the survival of Chu is not enough to preserve what I am.” If loss is not enough to cause self-reproach, then gain is not enough to cause self-aggrandizement. *Self-reproach* means to feel remorse; *self-aggrandizement* means to boast. These words carry particular savor—they are the language of learning that bears directly on one’s own person.\n\n---\n\n*Outer Chapters: \"Knowledge Wanders North,\" Chapter Twenty-Two*\n\nKnowledge wandered north to the Dark Waters, ascended the hill of Kunfen, and there encountered Non-Action. Knowledge said, “I wish to ask you: What thoughts, what reflections lead to knowing the Dao? Where does one abide, what practices lead to peace in the Dao? From what source, by what path does one attain the Dao?” Three questions, yet Non-Action did not answer—not that he would not answer, but that he did not know how.\n\nKnowledge, unable to obtain an answer, returned to the south of the White Waters, ascended Fox Tower, and there saw Mad Jue. Knowledge repeated his questions to Mad Jue. Mad Jue said, “Ah! I know, and will tell you”—but mid-speech, he forgot what he wished to say. Knowledge, unable to obtain an answer, returned to the palace of the Yellow Emperor and asked him. The Yellow Emperor said, “Without thoughts, without reflections, one begins to know the Dao. Without abode, without practice, one begins to be at peace in the Dao. Without source, without path, one begins to attain the Dao.”\n\nKnowledge asked the Yellow Emperor, “You and I know this, but those two do not—who is correct?” The Yellow Emperor said, “Non-Action is truly right; Mad Jue is somewhat close. You and I will never come near it.”\n\nThe names before and after are all allegorical, yet these three have distinctions. *Knowledge* is one who possesses a thinking mind. *Non-Action* is spontaneity itself. *Mad* is wildness; *Jue* is like a withered branch—stiff and unknowing. In this book, the term *mad* is akin to the “floating and wandering” in *Free and Easy Wandering*. Mad and stiff, he has the appearance of one without knowledge. This is merely to say that those who know do not speak, and those who speak do not know. Thus, when asked, he could not answer—like a monk with no elder before him, no preceptor. When he began to answer but forgot his words, it was as if he still knew there was a question. Thus it is said: “Non-Action is truly right; Mad Jue is somewhat close.”\n\nThose who know do not speak; those who speak do not know. Thus the sage practices the teaching without words. The Dao cannot be attained; virtue cannot be reached. Benevolence can be practiced, righteousness can be diminished, ritual is mutual pretense. Thus it is said: “Lose the Dao, and virtue follows; lose virtue, and benevolence follows; lose benevolence, and righteousness follows; lose righteousness, and ritual follows. Ritual is the flower of the Dao and the beginning of chaos.” Thus it is said: “Those who practice the Dao daily diminish. Diminish and further diminish, until they reach non-action. With non-action, there is nothing that is not done.” Now, having become entangled in things, to return to the root—is this not difficult? Yet how easy it is for the great person!\n\nThose who know do not speak—this is Bodhidharma’s coming from the West without establishing words, directly pointing to the human mind, seeing one’s nature and becoming a Buddha. The teaching without words is the Vimalakīrti’s non-dual Dharma gate.\n\nThe Dao cannot be attained—it cannot be reached through words. Virtue cannot be reached—it cannot be sought through traces.",

      "translated_text": "Righteousness, propriety, and ritual—all leave traces. Where there are traces, the Dao is ruined. Zhuangzi regarded ritual as a forced imposition upon the world, comparing it to righteousness and propriety, yet its traces are even more pronounced. Thus it is said: “The flower of the Dao is the beginning of chaos.” The flower is outward adornment without substance. From outward adornment arises falsity, and from falsity arises deceit. Thus it is called “the beginning of chaos.” To dismiss cleverness and cast off artificiality—this is the daily diminishing of the Dao. Diminish and further diminish until one reaches nothingness, then forget one’s former self. When one can act without contrivance, one follows the natural principle of Heaven, and there is nothing that cannot be done.\n\nThings are but traces. To seek the Dao while still clinging to traces is to remain on par with things, and thus to perceive the root and origin of the self is rightly difficult. “To return to the root” means to gather in and revert to the state before things existed. The great person embodies non-action. For the great person, this is easy—so easy! (In Zhuangzi’s phrasing, if it were another, it would read: “Only the great person finds it easy.”)\n\nLife is the companion of death; death is the beginning of life. Who knows their order? The life of humans is the gathering of qi. When it gathers, there is life; when it scatters, there is death. If life and death are companions, what cause for concern? Thus the myriad things are one. What they deem beautiful is wondrous; what they deem foul is rotten. Yet the rotten transforms again into the wondrous, and the wondrous transforms again into the rotten. Thus it is said: “The world is united by a single qi.” The sage therefore values oneness.\n\nLife is the companion of death; death is the beginning of life. The latter phrase is easy to explain, but the former is difficult. Consider the flowering of plants into branches and leaves—this is their life. Yet what has already flourished will inevitably perish, so even this life is but death. As Master Yichuan said: “The breath that returns is not the breath that was exhaled.” This is precisely the meaning. The unripe fruit that remains is the sprout of renewal. Though called the “unripe fruit,” it is already dead. When planted, it revives—is this not death giving rise to life? The cycle of life and death pervades all things. Who knows the principle that governs it? The “order” is the governing thread, the master that directs it.\n\nThe gathering and scattering of qi give rise to life and death—this all know. Yet if one understands that life and death are but a single principle, what cause for concern? The companion of life is death, and death is one with life. Life and death are fundamentally one principle, shared by all things. Yet people distinguish between beauty and ugliness, good and evil. When flowers are in full bloom, they are deemed wondrous; when they fall to the ground, they are called rotten. They do not realize that when leaves fall and nourish the roots, a new beginning arises—thus the rotten transforms again into the wondrous. Yet once bloomed and fallen, the wondrous transforms again into the rotten. From ancient times to the present, back and forth, there is only this single qi. The sage, knowing this, does not distinguish between life and death, success and failure, fortune and misfortune. Thus it is said: “The sage therefore values oneness.” Oneness means no distinctions.\n\nHuangdi said: “I asked Wuwei. Wuwei said, ‘Do not respond to me.’ Not that he did not respond to me, but that he did not know how to respond. I asked Kuang Qu. Kuang Qu wished to tell me but did not tell me. Not that he did not tell me, but that in wishing to tell, he forgot it. Now I ask you—you know, so why do you not come close?” Huangdi said: “He is truly so because he does not know. This one seems so because he has forgotten. You and I will never come close because you know.” Kuang Qu heard this and considered Huangdi’s words to be wise.\n\nThese lines clarify the preceding meaning with great clarity. Heaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak; the four seasons have bright patterns yet do not debate; the myriad things have inherent principles yet do not explain. The sage traces the beauty of Heaven and Earth and comprehends the principles of the myriad things. Thus the perfected person embodies non-action, and the great sage does not act—this is called “observing Heaven and Earth.”\n\nNow, that numinous clarity and utmost subtlety, along with the transformations of the hundred things—life and death, square and round—none know their root. Yet all things have existed since ancient times, abiding as they are. The Six Directions are vast, yet nothing lies beyond their bounds. The tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it awaits its completion as a form. In the world, none do not rise and fall, yet throughout life, nothing remains fixed. Yin and yang, the four seasons, move in their courses, each maintaining its order. Obscure yet present, formless yet spirit-like, the myriad things are nurtured without awareness—this is called the root. One may observe Heaven thereby.\n\nHeaven and Earth possess great beauty yet do not speak—this is like the *Book of Changes*, which “benefits all under Heaven with beauty yet does not speak of what it benefits.” How great indeed! The “bright patterns” refer to the cycles of cold and heat, fullness and emptiness, growth and decline—all have clear, unchanging laws. Why would they require deliberation? Thus it is said: “They do not debate.” Whether the duck’s legs are short or the crane’s long, whether wheat droops or millet stands tall, whether things are cold or warm, bitter or sweet—all are natural principles. How could one explain their length or shortness, sweetness or bitterness? Thus it is said: “They have inherent principles yet do not explain.” “Not acting” is non-action. Non-action and not acting both follow the natural. The sage’s way of following the natural is simply to emulate Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: “This is called observing Heaven and Earth.”\n\n“Numinous clarity and utmost subtlety” refers to the wondrous principle. “The transformations of the hundred things” refers to the transformations of all things. The first “that” refers to Heaven; the second “that” refers to things. Whether things live or die, whether in life they are square or round—all are shaped by the numinous and utmost subtlety. Yet once they exist, who can fathom their root? Thus it is said: “The things that have already lived and died, that are square and round—none know their root.” “Flitting” means moving without cease, like the ceaseless flow of things. This is what the *Analects* means by “passing away like this.” Without insight, one could not speak of it thus. The Six Directions are vast, yet nothing lies beyond the bounds of creation. The tip of an autumn hair is minute, yet it awaits its completion as a form. If there were no form of the autumn hair, there would be no name for the autumn hair—just as in the world, nothing is greater than the tip of an autumn hair, and Mount Tai is small. “Rising and falling” means coming and going. “Nothing remains fixed” means ever-renewing.",

      "translated_text": "\"To transcend thought is transcendence itself. Heavenly harmony is the primordial qi. Forget the body, the ears and eyes, and the primordial qi is preserved whole. The spirit is what the Buddhists call the 'master within'—it comes and goes without fixed time, its whereabouts unknown, thus it does not come to dwell. 'Virtue will become your beauty' means virtue moistens the self. 'The Dao will become your dwelling' means dwelling in the vast abode of the world. To stare like a newborn calf is to gaze directly without knowledge. At birth, a calf does not fail to see, yet what does it truly see? The infant is the same—it does not seek its former state, for how can one know the reason for its gaze? This depicts the appearance of a mindless state. That his words were not yet finished and Nie Que fell asleep shows that his response was not yet complete when he drifted off. Their exchange was so perfectly attuned that words were unnecessary. 'Truly, his knowledge does not cling to the old' means he truly perceived the reality of this principle. Matters and things do not enter his heart, so he does not rely on the past to sustain himself—this is the meaning of 'not clinging to the old.' Vague and dim, dark and obscure, without form or sight. Since he is without mind, and I am not, words are impossible—thus 'without mind, he cannot be schemed with.' That such a person exists between heaven and earth—'What manner of man is this?'—is an expression of profound admiration.\n\nShun asked his minister, 'Can the Dao be possessed?' The minister replied, 'Your body is not your own possession—how can you possess the Dao?' Shun said, 'If my body is not mine, then whose is it?' The minister said, 'It is the form entrusted by heaven and earth. Life is not yours—it is the harmony entrusted by heaven and earth. Nature and destiny are not yours—they are the compliance entrusted by heaven and earth. Children and grandchildren are not yours—they are the shedding entrusted by heaven and earth. Thus, your actions are not of your own direction, your dwelling is not of your own choosing, your food is not of your own savoring. Heaven and earth are the strong yang qi—how can you possess them?' 'Entrusted' means gathered together. The four great elements temporarily combine to form this body, hence 'entrusted form.' The harmony of yin and yang gives rise to life, hence 'life is entrusted harmony.' 'Compliance' is principle—nature and destiny reside within me, thus they are the principle of creation, hence 'entrusted compliance.' The succession of generations is like the molting of a cicada, hence 'children and grandchildren are entrusted shedding.' Strong yang qi is the qi of life—movement is yang. A person’s actions, dwelling, and eating are all driven by this qi, none of which are truly mine. As the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* says, 'Where is this illusory body now?'—this is the same idea. This passage is also uniquely profound, for it speaks of 'not knowing what to hold onto,' meaning there is no attachment.\n\nConfucius asked Lao Dan, 'Today I have leisure—may I inquire about the supreme Dao?' Lao Dan said, 'Purify your mind through fasting, cleanse your heart through bathing, and refine your spirit. Shatter your knowledge. The Dao is profound and hard to describe—I will tell you its rough outline. The luminous arises from the obscure, order arises from formlessness, spirit arises from the Dao, and form arises from essence. All things give birth through form. Thus, those with nine orifices are born from the womb, and those with eight orifices are born from eggs.' 'Purify through fasting' means to guide and unblock. 'Cleanse through bathing' means to wash and purify. 'Shatter' means to cast aside. 'Profound' describes its depth. 'Outline' refers to its boundaries—when the profound is hard to express, one can only speak of its edges and rough contours. The luminous is what can be seen; the obscure is what cannot. What can be seen and distinguished is called 'order'—the myriad things. Formlessness is creation. Spirit resides within humans. Form is visible; essence is not. Nine orifices belong to humans; eight orifices belong to birds. Since humans and birds are mentioned together, the text humbles them. The Buddhist sutras speak of birth from the womb, from eggs, and from moisture—all originate from this idea. The meaning here is that though humans are nobler than other beings, their birth is fundamentally the same. Thus, one should abandon the physical body to seek the Dharma-body. Zhuangzi’s intent is the same.\n\nIts coming leaves no trace, its going no boundary. Without doors or chambers, it is vast and all-pervading. Those who encounter it here find their limbs strong, their thoughts penetrating, their ears and eyes sharp and clear. Their use of the mind is effortless, their response to things without fixed method. Heaven cannot but be high, earth cannot but be broad, the sun and moon cannot but move, and the myriad things cannot but flourish—this is the Dao.\n\n'Its coming leaves no trace, its going no boundary' speaks of creation—where things depart and arrive cannot be traced. 'Vast and all-pervading' describes the great void. A person’s dwelling has doors and chambers, but in the great void, one sees only its boundless vastness—how can one know where it enters or exits? 'Those who encounter it here' means those who seek and find this Dao. 'Limbs strong' is what the *Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment* calls 'the body light and at ease.' 'Penetrating' means unobstructed. 'Effortless' means following nature. 'Without fixed method' means it is not predetermined but arises in response to encounters. If not for this Dao, who would truly bring about heaven, earth, the sun, moon, and the myriad things? These four lines merely describe how this Dao pervades all, above and below.\n\nMoreover, extensive learning does not necessarily mean knowledge, eloquence does not necessarily mean wisdom—the sage has already settled this. As for what is increased yet not augmented, diminished yet not reduced, this is what the sage preserves. Profound like the sea, towering like a mountain, it begins and ends in the same place. It measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion—this is the Dao of the noble person. Is it external? All things rely on it without exhaustion—this is the Dao. Within the world, there are those who are neither yin nor yang, dwelling between heaven and earth, simply being human. Yet they return to the source. Observing from the root, life is but a sigh, a breath—though there are differences in longevity, how much do they truly differ? The saying of 'a moment' is sufficient—why distinguish between Yao and Jie?\n\n'Extensive learning' does not mean true knowledge. People’s eloquence is all boasting of their own abilities, yet it does not necessarily arise from their own wisdom—their wisdom is bestowed by creation. Thus, the sage judges by creation, not taking increase as increase or decrease as decrease. What is preserved lies within me, and external things cannot add to it—this is the sage’s affair. 'Begins and ends in the same place' means it is pure and unceasing. 'Measures and sustains the myriad things without exhaustion' means responding to things without limit. 'Measures' means to apply and assess—this still involves intention, so it is only the Dao of the noble person, for it speaks of traces. If I respond to things, it is 'measuring and sustaining the myriad things.' If things come and I respond, it is 'all things rely on it.'\n\n\"",

      "translated_text": "This is \"responding only after being moved, acting only under compulsion\"—if such a way does not exhaust itself, it is called the Dao. The Dao is without intention, without traces. Within the world, there is a being called the \"perfected person at the center of Heaven and Earth,\" neither yin nor yang—words cannot point to or name it. Though possessing human form, its heart roams at the origin of things, merely lodging its form between Heaven and Earth. Thus it is said: \"Straightforward and human, it will return to the source.\" The source is the origin of the myriad things. Obstruction and stagnation of qi are what cause disharmony. When the qi of the human body is disharmonious, it produces warts and tumors; when the qi of creation generates humans, it too is a case of disharmony. Thus it is said: \"Viewed from the root,\" meaning observed from the origin of Heaven and Earth.\n\nThis idea seems to denigrate the human body—it is akin to the Buddhist notion of a \"skin-bag filled with blood.\" Examining closely, much of the discourse in the *Tripitaka* stems from this. Yao and Jie, right and wrong—these are judgments of the human world, arising only after the existence of this body. Within a hundred years, though lifespans may vary in length, compared to Heaven and Earth, they are but a fleeting moment. These words are also apt: fruits and melons have their principles; human relationships, though difficult, are how we rank one another.

      "translated_text": "The state of sudden surging forth—pushing, crowding, bursting out—is like oil flowing smoothly, alive and ripe. This is the extension of what departs and the contraction of what arrives, precisely what the *Yi* means by \"exhausting the spirit and knowing transformation.\" Having transformed, it gives birth; having transformed again, it dies. Living beings mourn this; people grieve over it. They loosen their bow-cases and cast off their book-wrappers, entangled and confused. The soul and spirit are about to depart, and the body follows—this is the great return to the origin of things. Originally, birth arises from nothing into being; death transforms from being back into nothing. Though the principle is the same, humans and creatures take it as sorrow and delusion. *Taō* is the bow-case; *zhì* is the wrapper. The deluded still cling to something, remaining unclear. If one can awaken, they will untie the bow-case and discard the wrapper—casting it off, abandoning it. *Fēn* and *wǎn* describe transformation: the soul and spirit disperse, and the body follows. Thus, it is called the great return, meaning the return to one’s true dwelling.\n\nThe formless taking form and form returning to formlessness—this is universally known, not the concern of those who are about to reach the ultimate. This is the common discourse of the multitude. Those who reach it do not discuss it; those who discuss it do not reach it. The formless form is the unseen. Within form, there is an unseen form—this is what the Buddha calls the *Dharmakāya*, eternally abiding and indestructible. Yet though all know this, they cannot depart from form to seek it, and so they do not attain it. To make it one’s pursuit—this is learning, and to approach the ultimate, what one engages in does not end here. Thus, it is said: this is not the concern of those who are about to reach it. The multitude all speak of this, yet none have attained it. Hence, it is called the common discourse of the multitude. Expounding further: those who attain it do not discuss it; to have such discourse is to not have attained it. Thus, it is said: those who reach it do not discuss it; those who discuss it do not reach it. For the formless form is fundamentally easy to know and requires no explanation. To take this as a topic of discussion is to have not yet reached its most wondrous state—this is speaking at a yet higher level.\n\nClear insight finds no encounter; disputation is inferior to silence. The Dao cannot be heard; hearing is inferior to blocking it. This is called great attainment. To see and have an encounter is a seeing with traces. The Dao cannot be perceived through form or traces, hence there is no encounter. Thus, it is said: clear insight finds no encounter. Disputation is inferior to silence; to engage in disputation is already wrong. *Mò* means not speaking. The so-called Dao is not heard from others but heard by oneself. To call it \"hearing\" is already not the Dao. To have heard is not as good as not having heard; to block the ears and have no hearing is best. Thus, it is said: the Dao cannot be heard; hearing is inferior to blocking. *Dà dé* means profound attainment.\n\nDongguo Zi asked Zhuangzi, \"Where does the so-called Dao reside?\"\nZhuangzi said, \"There is nowhere it does not reside.\"\nDongguo Zi said, \"Specify a place, and then it can be so.\"\nZhuangzi said, \"It is in the ants.\"\n\"How can it be so low?\"\n\"It is in the weeds.\"\n\"How can it be even lower?\"\n\"It is in the tiles and bricks.\"\n\"How can it be even more so?\"\n\"It is in excrement and urine.\"\nDongguo Zi did not respond.\nZhuangzi said, \"Your question fundamentally does not reach the essence. When Zheng Huo asked the market inspector about weighing a pig, the lower he went, the clearer it became.\" This is a well-crafted fabrication, though it may seem like an extreme statement. Yet in things, whether refined or coarse, the same principle emerges—this is one point of discourse. It aligns with the Buddhist idea of \"the insentient preaching the Dharma\"; even tiles and bricks blaze forth, constantly speaking. *Qī ér hòu kě* means specifying a place and then it can be so. *Zhì* is the root; your question does not reach the root, hence my answers grow ever lower. *Jiān shì* is like today’s meat market overseer. *Lǚ shǐ* means treading on a pig to know its weight. *Kuàng* means comparison; the lower the market’s base, the clearer the comparison. The official *Zhèng Huò* wanted to know the pig’s fatness or leanness. If he asked the most lowly, the comparison would be even clearer. Thus, it is said: the lower, the clearer. *Zhèng* is the market overseer; *Huò* is the person’s name. This is a metaphor for those who inquire about the Dao.\n\n\"You must not be fixed—nothing escapes the ultimate Dao.\" Such great words are likewise all-pervading and universal. These three—*zhōu*, *biàn*, *xián*—are different names for the same reality; their meaning is one. Have you ever wandered together in the Palace of No-What-Is? Joining in discussion, there is no end to its profundity. Have you ever been idle together—serene and still, vast and clear, harmonious and at ease? Empty and boundless, my will goes nowhere and does not know where it arrives; it departs and comes without knowing where it rests. I have gone and come without knowing its end, wandering in boundless vastness. Great knowledge enters and does not know its limit.\n\n*Mò bì* means having no fixed certainty. If you have no fixed mind, then the principle of all things cannot escape, and how could you doubt my words? Thus, it is said: the ultimate Dao is like this; great words are likewise so. *Zhōu*, *biàn*, and *xián* all share the same meaning, hence it is said: different names, same reality. This sentence illustrates that in things, whether refined or coarse, the principle is one.\n\nThe Palace of No-What-Is has already been discussed, expressing the idea of no fixed certainty. *Tóng hé ér lùn* means that without refinement or coarseness, all join in the same discussion—how could there be an end to its profundity? *Diào xián* means harmonious ease. *Dàn*, still; *mò*, vast; *qīng*, clear; *diào xián*, all describe the wonder of non-action. *Liáo* means emptiness. *Yǐ* is the same as *yǐ* (already). To have investigated this to the emptiness of oneness is for my will to be fully content. Thus, it is said: empty and boundless, my will. These four words are concise yet powerful. If there is no going, how can there be an arrival? Though there is departure and coming, there is no place of rest. The two preceding sentences express the unknowability of going and coming. It concludes by saying: I have gone and come without knowing its end—merely seeing it wander in boundless vastness, entering great knowledge without knowing its limit. *Pánghuáng* means roaming; *féng hóng* means vast and open; *dà zhī* means the ultimate Dao.\n\nThat which is one with things has no boundary with things; that which things do not bound is called the boundary of things. The unbounded boundary is the boundary of the unbounded. They speak of fullness and emptiness, yet it is not fullness or emptiness; they speak of decline and decay, yet it is not decline or decay; they speak of beginning and end, yet it is not beginning or end; they speak of accumulation and dispersal, yet it is not accumulation or dispersal. To be one with things without boundary is to transform with things.",
      "overlap_context": "counter without resistance is to meet the times, whether favorable or adverse, and simply follow them. To pass without attachment is to let what passes transform. To harmonize, to chance upon, to respond with each stimulus, to join in accord—this is the spontaneity of virtue and the Dao. The rise of emperors and kings does not exceed this principle.\n\nThat which is sudden is the meaning of \"a fleeting moment\": emergence is birth, extension, coming; entering death is contraction, departure, going.",

      "translated_text": "To transform with things is to be able to \"thing\" things—what is called \"not-thinging\" is precisely what enables one to \"thing\" things. If one does not transform with things, then boundaries arise. Once boundaries exist, one is confined by them; where there is confinement, there is limitation. Thus, what has boundaries is called the boundary of things. To push to the limit is to reach the limitless; to exhaust is to reach the inexhaustible. This is to be unbounded by the boundaries of things and to attain that which is unbounded—what is called the boundary of the unbounded.\n\nIt is like standing at the edge of a boundary and seeing that there is no boundary. The formless form, the form of the formless; the unbounded boundary, the boundary of the unbounded—such phrasing reveals the marvels of Zhuangzi’s prose. Decline and flourishing, decay and ascent: mention one, and the other is understood. Fullness and emptiness, rise and fall, beginning and end, gathering and dispersal—all appear to leave traces, yet in truth cannot be exhausted. This is the boundary of the unbounded.\n\nĒ Hé Gān and Shénnóng studied together under Lǎolóng Jí. Shénnóng sat with the door shut, weaving by daylight. Ē Hé Gān pushed open the door at midday and entered, saying, \"Lǎolóng is dead.\" Shénnóng leaned on his staff and rose, then cast it aside with a clatter and laughed, saying, \"Heaven knew my stubbornness and arrogance, so it cast me aside and let him die. The Master died without ever drawing forth my wild words!\" Yǎn Gāng, upon hearing this, said, \"Those who embody the Dao are the ones upon whom the noble ones of the world depend.

      "translated_text": "\"Heaven knew me\"—here, \"Heaven\" is used to address the deceased Old Long Ji. While the Master lived, he could draw forth my grand words; now that he is dead, no one can. This means that with Old Long Ji’s death, my words have died with him.\n\nYǎn is the surname; Gāng, the given name. Upon offering condolences for Old Long Ji, he heard Shénnóng’s words. Those who embody the Dao become one with it. *Xì* means to depend upon and honor: if one embodies the Dao, all noble ones of the world will depend upon and honor them. Now, Shénnóng, who has not yet perceived the Dao, still understood that Old Long Ji’s death was a concealment of his wild words—how much more, then, should one who embodies the Dao in the same way as Old Long Ji do so? \"Wild words\" are the same as \"grand words.\" His meaning was this: the Dao resides in non-speech. To conceal one’s words and die is to be in accord with the Dao. Shénnóng has not yet reached this realm, yet he still spoke thus—how much more should one surpassing Shénnóng do so?\n\nThe tip of an autumn hair is the smallest of things. To have not even one ten-thousandth part of the Dao within it is to have less than the least—this much is clear. Buddhist scriptures, in their calculations and analogies, also contain such expressions.\n\nThe Dao originally has no sound or form; it cannot be seen or heard. If one discusses it with others, naming it \"obscure obscurity,\" this is merely a forced designation—it is not the Dao itself. Thus it is said, \"This is a way of discussing the Dao, not the Dao.\" That is to say, the speaker does not truly know. Form and sound exist; obscurity does not. To know existence as non-existence is not as good as merging with non-existence entirely. This means that Shénnóng’s words, though spoken, do not yet constitute true knowledge of the Dao.\n\nThereupon Tài Qīng asked Wúqióng, \"Do you know the Dao?\"\nWúqióng said, \"I do not know.\"\nHe asked again.\nWúwéi Wúwéi said, \"I know the Dao.\"\nTài Qīng said, \"Does your knowledge of the Dao have a pattern?\"\nWúwéi said, \"It does.\"\nTài Qīng said, \"What is this pattern like?\"\nWúwéi said, \"I know that the Dao can be noble, can be base, can be constrained, can be dispersed—this is the pattern by which I know the Dao.\"\n\nTài Qīng then took these words and asked Wúshǐ, \"If this is so, then is Wúqióng’s not-knowing correct, or is Wúwéi’s knowing correct? Which is right and which is wrong?\"\nWúshǐ said, \"Not-knowing runs deep; knowing is shallow. Not-knowing is internal; knowing is external.\"\n\nThereupon Tài Qīng sighed from within, saying, \"Is not-knowing then knowing? Is knowing then not-knowing? Who knows the knowledge of not-knowing?\"\nWúshǐ said, \"The Dao cannot be heard—what is heard is not it. The Dao cannot be seen—what is seen is not it. The Dao cannot be spoken—what is spoken is not it. Do you know that the formless cannot be formed? The Dao should not be named.\"\n\nWúshǐ said, \"If one asks about the Dao and another responds, neither knows the Dao. Even the one who asks about the Dao has not heard the Dao. The Dao has no questions; questions have no answers. To ask questions is to exhaust inquiry; to answer is to lack inwardness. Responding to exhaustion with emptiness—if this is so, then externally, one does not observe the cosmos; internally, one does not know what lies within the universe.

      "translated_text": "At the outset of speech, the two characters placed here correspond to the \"Thus have I heard\" at the beginning of Buddhist sutras. The numerability of the Dao means it can be enumerated and spoken of in detail. The convergence and dispersion of high and low are all aspects of the Dao that can be enumerated—this is the principle of convergence. Inwardly, one attains it; outwardly, one sets it apart from the Dao as a duality.\n\nThe knowing that transcends knowledge is the ineffable subtlety. That which is \"formless among forms\" is the non-thing that enables all things. To be in opposition is to have a name for the Dao, for then the name stands in opposition to the Dao, departing from its original truth. Thus it is said, \"The Dao should not be named.\" The Dao itself has no questions; if one asks and another answers, I have already departed from the Dao, and the questioner’s hearing is also not the Dao.\n\n\"Exhausting inquiry\" means that one’s views lead to a dead end in questioning, for it refers to clinging to words and seeking knowledge and perception where they do not exist. \"Lacking inwardness\" means the center has not attained this Dao. If one attains this Dao, one does not respond.\n\nThe cosmos is what can be seen, hence it is said, \"externally, one does not observe the cosmos.\" The Great Beginning is what cannot be seen, hence it is said, \"internally, one does not know what lies within.\" Kunlun lies beyond the cosmos, and the Great Void lies beyond Kunlun. If one has not even traversed Kunlun, how can one reach the Great Void?\n\nGuangyao asked Wu You, \"Does the Master possess it, or is he without it?\" Guangyao, unable to ask further, gazed intently at his appearance—profoundly empty, utterly vacant. He looked at him all day without seeing, listened without hearing, and grasped without obtaining.\n\nGuangyao said, \"This is perfection! Who could attain such a state? I can attain being and non-being, but I have not yet attained non-being of non-being.\" When one becomes \"without being,\" how can one reach this state?\n\nThe passage describing his gaze—\"gazing intently at his appearance\"—merely depicts the Dao’s invisibility. \"I can attain being and non-being, but I have not yet attained non-being of non-being\"—this saying is marvelous beyond marvels. If one has not attained non-being of non-being, then the self still resides within the realm of non-being, possessed by the concept of non-being. How can one reach the state of profound emptiness and utter vacancy?\n\nThe *Yuanjue Jing* says, \"Those who speak of non-enlightenment are likewise so.\" To awaken to the point of non-enlightenment may be called marvelous, yet even this is not the ultimate, for it still regards non-enlightenment as incomplete. This is the meaning of \"not yet attaining non-being of non-being.\" The earlier \"knowing non-being\" of Fang Qing and Wu Shi, and now Guangyao’s \"without being,\" seem to use such names, yet their implied meaning is quite clear—unlike other figures such as Wang Ni or Bei Yi.\n\nThe smith of hooks under Da Ma was eighty years old yet never missed by a hair’s breadth. Da Ma said, \"Are you skillful, or do you possess the Dao?\"\n\nHe replied, \"Your servant has his discipline. At twenty, I delighted in forging hooks. To other things, I paid no heed; apart from hooks, I observed nothing. This is the user borrowing from the non-user. By prolonging its use, one attains mastery—how much more so for that which is never unused? What thing does not rely on it?\"\n\nHooks refer to belt hooks. Da Ma was the Grand Marshal. *Chui* means forging, and *qian* refers to the smith of hooks, an official under the Grand Marshal. Though old, his skill was so precise that not even a hair’s difference was missed—this speaks of his craftsmanship. \"Apart from hooks, I observed nothing\" echoes the earlier \"knowing only the cicada’s wings.\" His focus was entirely on hooks, seeing nothing beyond. The \"user\" is skill, while the \"non-user\" is the Dao’s spontaneity. \"Never unused\" refers to the Dao’s non-action that accomplishes all. He says, \"I borrow the marvel of non-use to apply to skill, and through long practice, I attain mastery even in old age. How much more so for the Dao, which is non-action yet accomplishes all?

Without past, without present, without beginning, without end—could there be descendants without ancestors?\n\nRan Qiu did not respond. Confucius said, \"Enough. No answer is needed. One does not give life to life or death to death. Do life and death depend on something? All are of one body. There is that which existed before heaven and earth—is it a thing? That which gives rise to things is not itself a thing and cannot precede things. Yet it is as if there were a thing. Without end, the sage’s love for humanity also takes this as its model. At the inception of the Great Ultimate, yin and yang divided to form heaven and earth. The movement of heaven and earth, the alternation of yin and yang, cycles without end. The past was thus; the present is thus.\n\nTo answer the question of what existed before heaven and earth by saying the past is like the present—this is the meaning.

      "translated_text": "Here your arrival at this point renders further words unnecessary. The moment \"birth\" arises, \"death\" follows—it is by birth that the word \"death\" comes to be. The moment \"death\" arises, \"birth\" follows—it is by the name of death that what is born is later called \"life.\" This is what \"no birth, no death\" means, and how these phrases transform. Death and life depend upon one another; they are of one body—one body is like one root. It is one principle, the spontaneity of creation itself.\n\nThat which gives rise to things is not itself a thing; what is not a thing must have existed before heaven and earth—how could it be named as a thing? Hence it is said: \"Is there something that existed before heaven and earth and yet is a thing?\" To speak of the \"not-thing\" that is a thing is not to name it as a thing. Once named as a thing, it cannot be said to have existed before heaven and earth. Thus it is already a thing. Therefore it is said: \"A thing cannot emerge before things.\" Yet where there is a thing, the appearances of things are endless. Hence it is said: \"It is as if there were a thing.\" In such passages, the subtlety of the text shines—here the sage’s care for humanity leaves traces one can see.\n\nThe pursuit of appearances extends without cease, for what is sought lies in the existence of things, yet one does not know that what gives rise to things is not itself a thing. Yan Yuan asked Confucius, saying: \"I once heard from you, Master, that one should not send off nor welcome anything. May I ask about the wandering you speak of?\" Confucius replied: \"The people of old transformed outwardly while inwardly remaining untransformed; the people of today transform inwardly while outwardly remaining untransformed. Those who transform with things are one with those who do not transform. How could one be at peace with transformation or non-transformation? How could one be at one with them without friction? One must be with them without seeking to surpass.\n\nThe parks of Xiwei, the gardens of the Yellow Emperor, the palaces of Youyu, the halls of Tang and Wu—these were the dwellings of the noble person, such as the followers of Confucianism and Mohism, who took them as teachers. Thus they contended with one another over right and wrong, and how much more so the people of today! The sage engages with things without harming them; one who does not harm things cannot be harmed by them. Only one who is without harm can send off and welcome others. To send off nothing and welcome nothing is to be without a mind for things. Responding to things without being burdened by them is outward transformation; being moved by stimuli without disturbing the heart is inward non-transformation.\n\nThus it is said: 'The people of old transformed outwardly while inwardly remaining untransformed.' To engage in daily contention with the heart is inward transformation; to grind and clash with things, being inwardly enslaved, is outward non-transformation. Thus it is said: 'The people of today transform inwardly while outwardly remaining untransformed.' With one’s inwardly untransformed self, one outwardly responds to things. What passes is transformed, yet without sending off or welcoming, one does not know transformation or non-transformation. Thus it is said: 'Those who transform with things are one with those who do not transform.'\n\n'How could one be at peace with transformation or non-transformation?' 'How' here means 'how could it be?' 'To be at one' speaks of mutual friction. 'Friction' is the same as 'grinding.' 'How' is the same as 'how could it be?' 'Seeking to surpass' means seeking much; much seeking leads to competition. 'Without seeking to surpass' means not competing. 'One must be with them without seeking to surpass' means that one of the utmost Dao must be with things without seeking to surpass them.\n\nXiwei, the Yellow Emperor, Youyu, Tang, Wu, and the teachers of Confucianism and Mohism were all unable to fully embody the way of inward non-transformation, hence they came to contend over right and wrong. The struggle over right and wrong arises only after the five flavors contend, hence it is said 'contend.' To speak of Xiwei and below in contrast to Confucianism and Mohism is to express the idea of belittling the great.\n\nParks, gardens, palaces, and halls are called 'nests and burrows.' Not harming things is to transform with them; having transformed with things, they cannot harm you, for you are without burden. Only with a heart free of burden can one send off and welcome others. The earlier statement about 'sending off nothing and welcoming nothing' and this statement about 'sending off and welcoming others' are the same as 'non-action and yet nothing left undone,' expressing the meaning of 'not being a thing yet giving rise to things.'\n\nMountains and forests, marshlands and wilds—these make me joyful and glad. Yet before the joy is complete, sorrow follows. The coming of joy and sorrow I cannot resist; their going I cannot halt. Alas! The people of the world are but travelers in things. They know what they encounter but not what they do not; they know what they can do but not what they cannot. Ignorance and inability are what no person can avoid. Yet those who strive to avoid what no person can avoid—is this not also lamentable?\n\nProfound words abandon words; profound action abandons action. To equalize knowledge with what is known is shallow indeed. When people wander among mountains, forests, marshlands, and wilds, they begin with joy. Once joyful, they are inevitably moved; once moved, sorrow follows. The *Lanting Record* employs this very idea: joy arises from things, sorrow arises from things; coming and going are not within my control. Thus this heart of mine is but a lodging house for sorrow and joy. This speaks of the absence of a true master, being moved by things.\n\nWhat is encountered is visible; what is not encountered is invisible. The visible is human; the invisible is Heaven. What one can do is human; what one cannot is Heaven. All people have what they do not know and cannot do. Since this is called 'human,' none can avoid it. Hence it is said: 'Ignorance and inability are what no person can avoid.' Only by knowing the human and not knowing Heaven do people employ their hearts and intelligence, striving to avoid what cannot be avoided. How could this not be lamentable?

He went north to dwell on Mount Weilü. Those among his retainers who were cunningly clever departed from him; those among his concubines who were ostentatiously benevolent kept their distance. Only the dull-witted and the idle remained to serve him. After three years, Weilü flourished.

Why do we not together honor him as our ancestral spirit and worship him as our grain deity?\"\n\nWhen Gengsang Chu heard this, he turned to the south with a troubled countenance.

      "translated_text": "\"Dang\" means \"to drift and scatter.\" This is a metaphor for when a name appears in the world, it can harm one’s physical form; preserving one’s form and life, nurturing life and attaining long vision, means concealing oneself without tiring of profound obscurity—desiring to withdraw from the world without fame. The \"two masters\" refer to Yao and Shun. To take Yao and Shun as models is like planting grass atop a wall—there is no such principle. This means that in citing them as evidence, one loses what is fitting.\n\nCombing one’s hair frequently and measuring rice for cooking—these describe the petty and anxious state of the mind. When worthies are promoted, the people will surely compete; when knowledge is made a task, the people grow ever more deceitful. \"These several things\" refer to the above matters. \"The people are most diligent in pursuit of profit\" means that they suffer greatly for their livelihood.\n\n*Pei* means \"a crumbling wall.\" To bore through a wall at midday is to steal in broad daylight. \"A thousand generations hence, there will surely be men who devour one another\" means that the world’s calamities began with Yao and Shun.\n\nNanrong Chu sat up straight and said, \"As for one like Chu, my years are already advanced—how then shall I entrust my work to reach this state?\" Master Gengsang replied, \"Preserve your form, embrace your life, and do not let your thoughts and cares flutter about like this. In three years, you may attain this state.\"\n\nNanrong Chu said, \"The eyes and the form—I do not know their difference, yet the blind cannot see themselves. The ears and the form—I do not know their difference, yet the deaf cannot hear themselves. The heart and the form—I do not know their difference, yet the mad cannot grasp themselves. The form and the form are also separate—yet is it that things sometimes come between them?

      "translated_text": "Master Gengsang said, \"A wild bee cannot transform a bean caterpillar; a Yue chicken cannot hatch the egg of a swan goose—yet a Lu chicken surely can. Chickens and chickens do not differ in their virtue, but in their capacity. Some can, some cannot—such is the inherent disparity in their endowment. Now my endowment is meager and insufficient to transform you. Why not journey south to see Laozi and entrust your learning to him? To 'entrust your learning' is to receive instruction. In seeking these words, you wish to attain what Master Gengsang has taught.\"\n\n\"All possess human form, and their hearts, ears, and eyes are the same—thus I say I do not know their difference. Each person has this heart, yet the mad cannot grasp it, just as the blind and deaf have nothing to see or hear. 'Separate' means 'open.' My form and another’s form are both open and unobstructed, yet I am now divided by desires. I seek the heart with the heart, yet it becomes ever more elusive. Thus it is said, 'desiring to seek one another, they cannot attain one another.' I strive to seek the heart but cannot grasp it, and now you tell me not to let my thoughts and cares flutter about. If I diligently apply myself to seek the Dao, might I yet attain understanding?\"\n\nNanrong Chu spoke thus without resolution, and Master Gengsang, wishing to guide him further but having exhausted his words, directed him to see Laozi. Thus he said, \"My words are exhausted\"—a humble pretense, not truly at the end of his speech. The wild bee is a small bee; the bean caterpillar, a large worm in the bean. The Yue chicken is small, the Lu chicken large, and the swan goose a great bird. The small bee cannot enchant the large worm; the small chicken cannot brood the large egg—this illustrates that his power is too slight to transform you.\n\nThereupon, Nanrong Chu carried provisions and traveled seven days and seven nights until he reached Laozi’s abode. Laozi said, \"Have you come from the land of Chu?\"\n\nNanrong Chu replied, \"Yes.\"\n\nLaozi said, \"Why have you come with so many others?\"\n\nNanrong Chu, startled, looked behind him. Laozi said, \"Do you not understand what I mean?\"\n\nNanrong Chu bowed his head in shame, then looked up and sighed, saying, \"Now I have forgotten my answer and lost my question.\"\n\nLaozi said, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nNanrong Chu said, \"If I am ignorant, people call me foolish; if I am wise, it only brings sorrow to my body. If I am unkind, I harm others; if I am kind, it only brings sorrow to myself. If I am unrighteous, I injure others; if I am righteous, it only brings sorrow to me. How can I escape this? These three concerns are what trouble me. I wish to ask you about them through my journey from Chu.\"\n\nLaozi said, \"A moment ago, I saw it in the space between your brows, and thus I understood you. Now you speak again, clinging to your words as if bound by rules, like a child clinging to its parents, or raising a pole to seek the sea. You are lost indeed—so bewildered!\"",

      "translated_text": "You wish to return to your true nature yet find no way in—how pitiable! Chu, just now you appeared alone, yet I took you for one who had come with the crowd. This is precisely what the Śākya meant when he said, \"Your mind is in turmoil.\" \"I forgot my answer and so lost my question\"—this speaks of a heart so lost it cannot even frame question or answer.\n\nCast off your knowledge, and others will call you foolish. *Zhu* means \"fixed\" or \"exclusive\"; *zhu yu* is like *zhuan hua*, \"obtuse.\" If you still cling to intention, employing cleverness only burdens your body. This is why one cannot remain without intention, yet cannot remain with it either—just as the Śākya said, \"How is it?\" \"It cannot be otherwise.\" The dilemma of benevolence and righteousness is the same as the three concerns; the doubt is one and the same.\n\nWhen I saw the space between your brows, I already knew you had not yet grasped the Dao. Now, hearing your words, I see it is indeed so. Thus I say: \"You speak again, clinging to your words as if bound by rules\"—*guigui* describes a cramped, shallow demeanor. \"Raising a pole to seek the sea\" means seeking the formless in the formed, wandering without anchor. A *lost person* is one who has strayed from their original heart; *wǎngwǎng* describes the sorrow of one who cannot find themselves.\n\n\"You wish to return to your true nature yet find no way in\"—this means you long to perceive the natural Dao yet cannot attain it. How pitiable!\n\nNanrong Chu then asked to stay in Laozi’s lodging. He summoned what he loved and cast off what he hated. After ten days of sorrow, he saw Laozi again.\n\nLaozi said, \"You have cleansed yourself—how thoroughly! Yet though you are heavy with gloom, within you still brim with vitality. But there is still aversion. Those who are fettered externally cannot be seized by multiplying restraints; those who are fettered internally cannot be seized by entangling bonds. Those who are fettered both internally and externally cannot be held by the power of virtue, let alone those who wander without the Dao.\"\n\n\"Summoning what you love\" means seeking what is right; \"casting off what you hate\" means shunning what is wrong. Yet with love and aversion still present, your heart remains confused—hence ten days of sorrow. *Shú zāi* (how thoroughly!) is like *shú yǔ* (how long!), meaning your effort has been prolonged. *Yùyù hū* expresses the unsettled mind, not yet at peace.",

      "translated_text": "Here your cleansing has been thorough—how thorough! Yet where aversion lingers, the heart clings, and thus the inner vitality still brims. *Vernacular note*: *Vernacular* (韄) means binding an object with leather; *jian* (揵) is the bolt of a door. Both are metaphors for grasping and restraint. When one responds to external things and seeks to regulate oneself, the constraints multiply and cannot be grasped. With externals unsettled, one then turns inward, hence \"will internally bolt.\" When the heart’s turmoil seeks self-regulation, it becomes entangled and cannot be grasped. With internals unsettled, one then turns outward again. This describes those who study the Dao yet fail to grasp its essence: whether attempting to control externally or internally, they find no foothold. In such a state, even the virtue one possesses cannot be held—how much less those who wander without the Dao?\n\n\"Wandering without the Dao\" means following the principle of naturalness. Only the perfected person can follow naturalness.\n\nNanrong Chu said: \"In my village, there is a sick man. When villagers ask about his illness, the sick man can describe his symptoms—yet his illness is still not severe. If I, having heard the great Dao, am like one who drinks medicine only to worsen his illness, then I wish only to hear the *Classic of Preserving Life*.\"\n\nLaozi said: \"The *Classic of Preserving Life*—can you embrace the One? Can you avoid losing it? Can you know fortune and misfortune without divination? Can you stop? Can you cease? Can you abandon others and seek within yourself? Can you be unburdened? Can you be guileless? Can you be like a child?\n\nA child wails all day without hoarseness—such is the perfection of harmony. A child grasps all day without cramping—such is the fullness of its power. A child gazes all day without blinking—its focus is not external. It walks without knowing its destination, rests without knowing its purpose, flows with things and moves with the current. This is the *Classic of Preserving Life*.\"\n\nWhen the sick man is still able to describe his symptoms, his illness is not yet severe. When illness becomes severe, he can no longer speak. Now, I wish to hear the great Dao yet do not know where I am afflicted—my confusion is profound. Though you offer teachings, they only deepen my bewilderment, like drinking medicine that worsens the illness. Thus, I dare not ask for instruction and wish only to learn the way of preserving life.\n\n\"Embrace the One\" means preserving wholeness and purity. \"Avoid losing\" means safeguarding what is received from Heaven without loss. \"Knowing fortune and misfortune without divination\" means that the way of utmost sincerity can foresee all. \"Can you stop?\" means can you settle? \"Can you cease?\" is what the Buddhists call \"great rest.\" \"Abandon others and seek within\" means focusing inward rather than outward. \"Unburdened\" describes being without encumbrance. \"Guileless\" describes being without knowledge. \"Can you be like a child?\" means not losing the heart of an infant. \"Wailing\" means crying.",

An infant wails and cries without its voice growing hoarse, for it has no deliberate intent and thus does not harm its harmony. \"Clasping\" means the inability to extend. When a person’s hand is clenched for too long and then stretched, there will inevitably be obstruction. An infant, however, is not like this—its nature is spontaneous, and all are alike in this. This is virtue.\n\nThe eyes gaze without blinking, though they see nothing; they are unaware of external things. To know of external things is to be partial. Blinking is the same as moving—one does not know where one dwells or what one does, which is to say, one is without intent. \"Compliant and yielding\" means following and adapting. Whether moving or at rest, one moves in accord with things, flowing like a wave. To be of the same wave is to go along with things in this way, and thus one may take this as the constant principle of preserving life. Therefore, it is called \"the warp of preserving life.\"\n\nNan Rong Chu said, \"Then is this the virtue of the perfected person?\"\n\n\"No,\" was the reply. \"This is what is called the melting of ice and the thawing of frost.

A child moves without knowing what it does, walks without knowing where it goes. Its body is like the branch of a withered tree, and its heart is like dead ashes. In such a state, misfortune does not arrive, nor does fortune. Without misfortune or fortune, there is no aversion to the calamities of others.\"\n\nChu asked about the warp of preserving life, seeking what comes next. Upon hearing Laozi’s words, so wondrous, he then asked about the virtue of the perfected person. This question arose naturally, but Laozi again said, \"No,\" for he feared Chu would cling to this and make it a fixed pattern—what the Buddhists call \"taking the provisional as real.\" \"The melting of ice and the thawing of frost\" means liberation and spontaneous awakening. \"Eating and associating with others on earth\" means being the same as others; \"taking joy in the heavens\" means being in accord with the heavens.",

The above speaks of the perfected person, but here it speaks of preserving life—thus what is called the Way of preserving life is precisely the affair of the perfected person. Viewed in this light, the earlier 'No' was clearly not the whole truth. Chu, having heard this, then asked, 'Then is this perfection?'—meaning that this Way is the ultimate Way.

To know the limit of what one cannot know is perfection. If there is any deviation from this, the celestial balance will disrupt it.\n\nFrom this point onward, Zhuangzi broadly expounds the ultimate principle.\n\n\"Cosmic vastness\" refers to the chest. When one is serene and settled, celestial radiance manifests—this is sincerity becoming illumination. Thus it is said, \"The one whose cosmic vastness is settled emits celestial radiance.\" Once celestial radiance is emitted, though others see them as merely human, they have already merged with Heaven.\n\n\"Those who possess cultivation\" refers to those who cultivate the real. When those who cultivate the real reach the point where celestial radiance is emitted, they become constant. Constancy means enduring permanence—this is the utmost sincerity extending into eternity. When utmost sincerity reaches eternity, Heaven assists them, and others gather to them—abandonment becomes dwelling, gathering becomes return. The Heavenly People are the people of Heaven.",

If I have already transcended beyond misfortune and fortune, then I have departed far from the world—how could I still have the afflictions of the worldly realm? To say 'No' and to say 'Not yet' is not to wish to speak exhaustively, but to allow him to awaken on his own. The Chan school often employs this method of explanation.\"",

      "translated_text": "The speaker is no ordinary person. The Son of Heaven is one whom Heaven cherishes as its child. Learning, conduct, and eloquence all leave traces—these are what one can learn, what one can practice, what one can debate. What cannot be learned, cannot be practiced, cannot be debated is the natural. When one’s knowledge reaches its limit at what cannot be known and stops there, this is the ultimate of creation. Thus it is said, \"It is the utmost.\"\n\nHeaven’s balance refers to creation. \"Not being this\" means not being so. *Ji* (就) means to align. Not being so is the opposite. To be opposite is to lose the principle of creation’s spontaneity. *Bai* (败) means to lose. To prepare things to sustain form, to conceal the unexpected to nurture the mind, to revere the center to reach the external—if one is thus, then all the myriad evils that arrive are from Heaven, not from man, and are insufficient to disturb one’s completion. They cannot enter the numinous terrace.\n\nThe numinous terrace is that which holds yet does not know what it holds, and that which cannot be held. \"Preparing things\" means preparing the principles of the myriad things. The myriad things are all prepared within me. \"Sustaining form\" means following the spontaneity of one’s life. \"Not anticipating\" means not calculating, not deliberating. Retreating to conceal oneself in the place of non-deliberation, the mind’s response to things arises spontaneously—this is what the Buddhists call \"not abiding yet giving rise to the mind.\" \"Preserving within\" means that reverence then responds externally without obstruction—this is the meaning of \"reverence to straighten the internal, righteousness to square the external.\" *Da* (达) means to penetrate. *Bi* (彼) refers to what is external. \"The myriad evils\" are matters that do not go as one wishes. When one’s own creation has already reached this point, yet the myriad evils still arrive, this is truly Heaven’s doing, not a failure of human affairs sufficient to disturb the perfect virtue within my breast. Thus it is said, \"All are from Heaven, not from man,\" and are insufficient to disturb the completion of the numinous heart. External things do not enter the mind, so they do not disturb its completion.\n\n\"Having hold\" means having something to rely on. \"Not knowing what it holds\" means that though there is something to rely on, one does not know what it is—this is transformation through the great. \"Cannot be held\" means that if there is something to hold onto, one has not yet transformed. These three instances of *chi* (持) are most subtly expressed and must not be read carelessly.\n\nIf one does not see their sincerity yet acts, every action is inappropriate; if one enters into karma yet does not relinquish it, every change leads to loss, to wrongdoing. Is this not wrongdoing in the manifest? In the hidden, even spirits can condemn it as wrongdoing. Only when one is enlightened about spirits can one act alone. These several sentences further explain that those who do wrong have not yet perfected themselves yet act presumptuously. Presumptuous action means every affair is inappropriate; karma has already entered their midst, and though they know it, they cannot relinquish it—these are the shame of transgression and the commission of wrongs. *Geng* (更) means to change. Shame over transgression and the commission of wrongs lead to constant changes, each revealing greater error. Thus it is said, \"Every change leads to loss.\" *Ye* (业) does not mean \"affair\"; today, people say *ye* (业) as in \"already\" or \"karma,\" meaning it has already become one’s conduct. Such a person’s actions are not good. If no one condemns them, then spirits will censure them. This means that between the hidden and the manifest, there is nowhere to escape. If one knows that the hidden and the manifest are to be feared, then one can be cautious in solitude. Thus it is said, \"Only when one is enlightened about man and enlightened about spirits can one act alone.\" This is the same as \"Nothing is more concealed than the hidden, nothing more manifest than the subtle\"—therefore the noble person is cautious in solitude. \"Acting alone\" is being cautious in solitude. These several phrases could be included in the classics.\n\nThose within the contract act without seeking fame; those outside the contract aspire to extravagant expenditure. Acting without seeking fame is only the common that has radiance. Aspiring to extravagant expenditure is only the merchant’s way. People see them standing tall, like eminent figures, yet when they are exhausted by things, things enter them. Those who contend with things cannot even contain themselves—how can they contain others? Those who cannot contain others have no affection; those with no affection cut off all people.\n\nThose within the contract seek what is within their allotted portion—this is what Mencius called \"seeking and obtaining it, seeking within.\" \"Without fame\" means that no one can name it. Those outside the contract seek externally. Those who labor externally set their aspirations only on resources for expenditure—this is seeking for self-benefit. Only the common has radiance: *yong* (庸) means constant, *guang* (光) means constant radiance. Abandoning the self to seek externally, aspiring to profit—this is the mindset of merchants. Thus it is said, \"Only the merchant’s way.\"\n\n*Qi* (跂) is the appearance of standing tall. People see their external wealth or nobility surpassing others and think them eminent and worthy of respect, yet they do not know that they are bound to things, beginning and ending with desire, until they are exhausted and come to an end. Thus it is said, \"When they are exhausted by things, things enter them.\" *Qie* (且) means \"barely.\" Chasing after things, barely seeking to obtain, even to the point of endangering themselves without regret—thus it is said, \"Those who contend with things cannot even contain themselves.\" How can they contain others with a heart that cannot contain others? In the extreme, even relatives and kin are estranged and abandoned. Thus it is said, \"Those who cannot contain others have no affection; those with no affection cut off all people.\"\n\nNo weapon is sharper than the will. The *moye* sword is inferior to it. No greater bandit exists than yin and yang, from which there is no escape between Heaven and Earth. If not for the harm of yin and yang, then the mind causes it. The will is the mind’s attachment. All attachments can harm oneself, but none is sharper than the will—it is even more harmful than the *moye* sword. Thus it is said, \"No weapon is sharper than the will; the *moye* sword is inferior to it.\" The qi of yin and yang can both harm people, like bandits. Yet if this mind is peaceful and harmonious, how can yin and yang cause harm? Thus it is said, \"If not for the harm of yin and yang, then the mind causes it.\" This is what is meant by \"Its heat scorches like fire, its cold congeals like ice.\" These two sentences are excellent for the work of the heart’s learning—this saying is most apt.\n\nThe Dao penetrates their allotment. Its completion is its destruction. What is detestable about allotment is its division; what is detestable about preparation is its having preparation. Completion and destruction are two matters, yet from the perspective of the Dao, they are one. Thus it is said, \"The Dao penetrates their allotment.\" Once the human mind is divided into self and other, in its selfishness it must seek completeness. Thus it is said, \"Its allotment is for preparation.\" All things return to nothingness, yet those who selfishly seek completeness only seek being. Those who know the Dao detest this. Thus it is said, \"What is detestable about preparation is its having preparation.\"",
      "overlap_context": ", they have already merged with Heaven.\n\n\"Those who possess cultivation\" refers to those who cultivate the real. When those who cultivate the real reach the point where celestial radiance is emitted, they become constant. Constancy means enduring permanence—this is the utmost sincerity extending into eternity.

      "translated_text": "Thus, to emerge without returning is to see its demonic aspect; to emerge and attain is called attaining death. That which responds to the external and can return to the internal becomes virtue; with virtue, one can be spirit-like and heaven-like. To pursue the external without knowing return is to sink into demonic realms. Thus it is said, \"To emerge without returning is to see its demonic aspect.\" The Śākya tradition speaks of \"demonic den calculations\"—this is precisely it. Without right or wrong, this heart-mind remains ever alive; clinging to right and wrong without transformation, this heart-mind becomes dead. \"To emerge and attain\" refers to being enslaved by the external and attaining self-righteous views. *Equalizing Things* says, \"A heart-mind near death cannot return to yang\"—this is the meaning here.\n\nExtinction yet possessing substance is one with the demonic. By means of the formed, one models the formless and thereby establishes it. \"Substance\" is the true principle within heaven and earth. Without the heart-mind, there is emptiness; emptiness is substance. If one extinguishes it with selfish intentions and takes the existent as substance, then that person is the same as the demonic. Thus it is said, \"Extinction yet possessing substance is one with the demonic.\" Demonic realms and sinking into delusion all arise from the selfish heart-mind extinguishing principle, coveting and clinging to existence while unaware of true emptiness and real being. If one can regard the formed as if it were formless, then principle is established. \"Model\" means semblance. The Śākya tradition says, \"One may empty all that exists, but must not reify what does not exist\"—this is the meaning here.\n\nEmerging without root, entering without aperture—substance exists yet without place.\nEmergence is birth, the origin from which the myriad things arise. Though never without root, it cannot be known; thus it is called \"without root.\" Entry is death, the end toward which the myriad things proceed. Though one knows where it ends, one does not see where it enters; thus it is called \"without aperture.\" True principle, though existent, cannot be sought in any particular direction; thus it is called \"without place.\"\n\nHaving duration yet without root or end—what has substance yet no place is space; what has duration yet no root or end is time. There is life, there is death, there is emergence, there is entry. In entry and emergence, no form is seen—this is called the Gate of Heaven.\n\nThe following explains the three sentences above:\nPrinciple remains the same across past and present, through thousands and tens of thousands of years; thus it is said, \"having duration.\" Yet its beginning and end are not seen; thus it is said, \"without root or end.\" \"Root\" is the origin; \"end\" is the conclusion.",

      "translated_text": "Laozi said: \"Empty yet not exhausted, in movement ever more emerges. Though what emerges is inexhaustible, its aperture cannot be exhausted—this is the emptiness of its aperture. Emptiness is precisely what makes it substantial; thus it is said, 'what has substance yet no aperture'—emergence and entry are one. This explains the character 'entry,' yet it speaks of 'emergence,' revealing its meaning: space encompasses the four directions, above and below. The Dao has no fixed place; all directions, above and below, are it. Thus it is called 'space'—as when the kite soars in the sky or the fish leaps in the abyss, illustrating the scrutiny of above and below. Past and present are called 'time'; the Dao’s coming and going through thousands and tens of thousands of years, ever thus, is time. Life is emergence; death is entry. In life and death, emergence and entry, all have their source, yet no form is visible—this is the marvel of creation. The Gate of Heaven is creation, spontaneity. Because it speaks of emergence and entry, it follows with the character 'gate.' The Gate of Heaven is Nonbeing. The myriad things emerge from Nonbeing. Being cannot make itself be; it must emerge from Nonbeing. Yet this Nonbeing is itself a Nonbeing. Thus it is said, 'Nonbeing, one Nonbeing.' *Qiwu* speaks of 'being and nonbeing,' and 'that which has never yet begun to be nonbeing'—this is the same meaning. 'Hiding' means retiring and concealing in secrecy. The sage’s heart conceals itself in Nonbeing; thus it is said, 'hiding therein.'\n\nThe knowledge of the ancients reached its utmost. How far did it reach? To the point of regarding things as never having begun to exist—this is the utmost, the limit, beyond which nothing can be added. Those next in order regarded things as existing, taking life as a defense and death as a return—thus they divided themselves. Those next said, 'At first there was Nonbeing; then there was life. Life suddenly becomes death. Taking Nonbeing as the head, life as the body, and death as the tail—who knows the unity of being and nonbeing, life and death? I would make friends with such a one.' These three, though different, belong to the same clan. The Zhaos and Jings became prominent through office; the Jias became prominent through enfeoffment. Though not one, they are all the noble clan of Chu. The above speaks of the three as different yet belonging to the same clan, but in the text below, it is said 'not one'—tying it together, this refers to the unbroken body of life and death above. These are the subtleties of the text.\n\nHaving life is *qian* (darkening). To assertively say 'this is it' is to have spoken of what should not be spoken. Yet it remains unknowable. *Qian* is a blemish, like the blackness at the bottom of a cauldron, or a defect—an analogy for the coagulation of qi. The qi of heaven and earth coagulates to form humans; this is the illness of primordial qi. Earlier it spoke of life as the muttering of qi—this is the same meaning. Human life arises from the same qi, yet people forcibly divide it. Thus it is said, 'assertively'—*pi* means division. Once there is division, each clings to their own; clinging to their own, each takes their own as right, and what is called 'right' shifts. Shifting means instability. This one calls it right, that one calls it right—this is shifting. The meaning is the same as in *Qiwulun*, yet it coins the term 'shifting right.' 'What should not be spoken' means it is not fitting to speak of it. To speak of 'shifting right' is, for people, always improper; all speech is self-serving. Though each person has their own 'right,' what they take as right is unstable. Thus it is said, 'though unknowable.'\n\nThe sacrificial victim at the *la* festival has its tripe and trotters—it can be dispersed yet cannot be dispersed. The *la* is the winter sacrifice. The tripe is the cow’s omasum; the trotters are the feet, parts of the sacrificial animal. When the sacrifice is made, the four limbs and five viscera are all dispersed and arranged on the cutting board. To call it 'dispersed' is to say the sacrificed nature is originally one thing; to call it 'indispersible' is to say the five viscera and four limbs are already separated in the cauldron and on the board. This is like what people call 'right'—shifting and unstable. The five viscera are represented by the tripe; the four limbs, by the trotters—this is the literary method.\n\nObserving a house, one circles the bedchamber and ancestral temple, then proceeds to the resting place—this is to illustrate 'shifting right.' Within a single house, there is the bedchamber, the ancestral temple, and a place for repose; though their locations differ, to call them 'bedchamber,' 'temple,' or 'resting place' is to refer to the same house. Yet to call it a 'house' is to acknowledge the distinctions of bedchamber, temple, and resting place—just like the instability of 'shifting right.' These two sentences are analogies for 'shifting right.' 'Illustrate' means 'all.' Observing the *la* sacrifice and the house, what they take as right is all shifting, an unstable 'right.' Thus it is said, 'to illustrate shifting right.'\n\nLet me speak of 'shifting right': taking life as the root, knowledge as the teacher, thereby riding upon right and wrong, indeed producing names and realities, thereby making oneself the standard, causing others to take one’s own restraint as their model, and even dying to repay that restraint. If so, then to act is to be wise, not to act is to be foolish; to penetrate is to be renowned, to be blocked is to be shamed—this is the 'shifting right' of people today. The cicada and the owl are the same in their sameness.\n\nAbove, it has already concluded one section, then raises the term 'shifting right' again, saying: 'taking life as the root.' Once there is the word 'right,' one takes life as the root, takes one’s own knowledge as the teacher, and thereafter rides upon right and wrong—who is truly named? Who is truly real? Thus it is said, 'indeed producing names and realities.' 'Indeed' means it is not necessarily so. 'Standard' is the root. Using one’s own teacher as the root, one desires others to follow one’s own restraint. Thus it is said, 'making oneself the standard, causing others to take one’s own restraint as their model.' Only because of this self-serving does the contention of right and wrong arise; though one may die to repay it, one willingly does so.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said, \"repaying with death for one’s restraint\"—the term *restraint* below arises from the term *restraint* above. Precisely because of this, in the moments of acceptance or rejection, success or failure, distinctions of wisdom and folly, honor and disgrace emerge. The people of this age are all those who \"shift right.\" Thus it is said, \"those who shift right are the people of today.\" *Thorough* means penetrating. The cicada and the owl both mock the great Peng, just as those who \"shift right\" do not recognize the scholar of the utmost Dao and ridicule him—their vision and understanding are the same as the cicada and the owl. The cicada and the owl are alike, and people are likewise the same as the cicada and the owl; thus it is said, \"the same in their sameness.\" This is stirring, exhortative prose.\n\nIf one treads on a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one apologizes with humility; if an elder brother treads on his younger brother’s foot, one merely soothes him; if a parent treads on their child’s foot, not even soothing is needed. Thus it is said: \"In the utmost ritual, there is no 'other'; in the utmost righteousness, there is no 'thing'; in the utmost wisdom, there is no scheming; in the utmost benevolence, there is no partiality; in the utmost trustworthiness, gold is set aside.\" These several lines form another distinct point. When one treads on a stranger’s foot in the marketplace, one must apologize with humility to avoid their anger. If an elder brother treads on his younger brother’s foot, one merely soothes him, without apology, for their bond is close and requires no thanks. *Great kinship* refers to parents. If parents tread on their child’s foot, even soothing is unnecessary—their intimacy is such that mutual trust is innate.\n\n\"In the utmost ritual, there is no 'other'\" means that in the highest ritual, the distinction between self and other is forgotten, and formalities are abandoned. \"In the utmost righteousness, there is no 'thing'\" means that in the highest righteousness, one does not rely on external things to measure what is fitting. \"In the utmost wisdom, there is no scheming\" means that no deliberation is needed. \"In the utmost benevolence, there is no partiality\" means that no trace of preferential love is visible. \"In the utmost trustworthiness, gold is set aside\" means that no material pledge is required. *Set aside* is pronounced *bìng*, meaning to discard. The analogy of treading on feet is set forth for the five virtues of ritual, righteousness, wisdom, benevolence, and trustworthiness that follow.\n\nObstruction of the will, delusion of the mind, encumbrance of virtue, and blockage of the Dao—wealth, honor, prominence, fame, and profit are the six obstructions of the will; appearance, movement, countenance, principle, qi, and intent are the six delusions of the mind; aversion, desire, joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are the six encumbrances of virtue; departure, approach, taking, giving, knowledge, and ability are the six blockages of the Dao. If these four sets of six are not stirred within the breast, then one is upright; if upright, then still; if still, then luminous; if luminous, then empty; if empty, then one acts without acting, yet nothing is left undone. *Thorough* is synonymous with *remove*. *Prominence* means splendor; *stern* means imposing. *Obstruction of the will* means these six can disorder one’s resolve. *Movement* refers to physical action; *principle* refers to verbal reasoning. *Delusion of the mind* means these six can entangle and bind the mind. *Encumbrance of virtue* means that when emotions prevail, they burden one’s innate truth. *Knowledge* refers to discernment; *ability* refers to talent. *Blockage of the Dao* means obstruction of the Dao. *Stirred* means disturbed. Removing these four sets of six harms—obstruction of the will, delusion of the mind, encumbrance of virtue, and blockage of the Dao—ensures that the breast is not disturbed. This is where one applies effort in cultivation.\n\nThe Dao is what virtue reveres; life is the radiance of virtue; nature is the essence of life. The movement of nature is called *action*; its deviation is called *loss*. Knowledge is encounter; wisdom is planning. What the wise do not know is like a sidelong glance. *Reveres* means to uphold and respect. *Life* is the manifestation of virtue; when manifested, it shines with brilliance. *Nature* is what resides within us; *essence* means its original state. When nature moves, action arises; when action flows into human artifice, it becomes a loss of nature. *Encounter* means response. *Planning* means strategy. Responding to encounters and engaging in planning are both expressions of the knowledge inherent in nature. The meaning of these terms differs from their usage in the *Analects* and *Mencius*; when reading Zhuangzi, one should read Zhuangzi and not be bound by rigid interpretations. The infant’s gaze, seeing yet seeing nothing, is called a *sidelong glance*. The wise, claiming knowledge of what they do not know, are like infants glancing sidelong—this embodies the idea of \"the wise act without contrivance.\" All actions should arise from necessity, which is called *virtue*; this is forgetting the self. Within this forgetting of the self, there is yet nothing that is not the self—this is the unmanifest within form and the manifest within the unmanifest.\n\nYi was skilled at hitting the mark but clumsy at making others free of his praise; the sage is skilled at following Heaven but clumsy at dealing with people. Only the complete person can be skilled at following Heaven and adept at dealing with people. Only creatures can be creatures; only creatures can follow Heaven. How much more should the complete person despise the Heaven of others and despise the humanity of others—how much more should one despise one’s own Heaven and one’s own humanity?\n\n*Mark* means subtlety; hitting the target with such subtlety is called *hitting the mark*. Yi’s inability to prevent others from praising him is like the sage’s inability to escape the world’s fame. *Skilled at following Heaven* means fully embodying the Dao of Heaven. *Adept at dealing with people* means concealing oneself among people. *Adept* is pronounced *liáng*, meaning good or capable. The *complete person* is one of complete virtue.\n\nWhen a sparrow comes near Yi, he is certain to catch it—such is his power. If the world is made into a cage, then sparrows have nowhere to escape. Thus, Tang used a kitchen servant to enclose Yi Yin, and Duke Mu of Qin used five sheepskins to enclose Baili Xi. Therefore, if one does not use what they love to enclose them, there is nothing that can be obtained. The *obstinate* are those who cast off external praise and blame; the *cautious* are those who, even when climbing high, do not fear, and who disregard life and death.\n\nYi’s shooting ensures that when a sparrow appears, he will catch it—the sparrow also fears him. When the monkey sees Yang Youji, it clings to a tree and wails; the meaning is the same. If the world is made into a cage, then all sparrows are within it, and there is no need to shoot them. The main point does not lie with Yi but serves to introduce the following sentence.\n\nTo return and repeat without offering is to forget others; forgetting others is to thereby become one with Heaven. *Return* means to turn back, like the *Book of Changes*’ \"turning back of the Dao.\" *Repeat* means familiarity. *Not offering* means not giving to others. Thus, one who is revered yet does not rejoice, or insulted yet does not anger, is only one who harmonizes with the harmony of Heaven. When anger arises from non-anger, then anger emerges from non-anger; when action arises from non-action, then action emerges from non-action. To desire stillness, one must calm the qi; to desire spirit, one must follow the mind. These are actions. To desire appropriateness, one must adhere to necessity; the path of the sage lies in this necessity. Revering me yet not rejoicing, insulting me yet not angering—this is what is meant by \"though the whole world praises them, they are not encouraged; though the whole world blames them, they are not discouraged.\" *Harmony of Heaven* is the harmonious qi of creation.\n\nTo be one with...",

What they enact arises originally from non-action, which is the non-action that leaves nothing undone. The phrasing shifts again: to desire stillness, one must calm the qi, for if the qi is not calm, stillness cannot be attained. To preserve the spirit whole, one must follow the mind without resistance, for the slightest disturbance to the mind disrupts the spirit.

      "translated_text": "The *Imperially Commissioned Siku Quanshu*: *Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Eight\nBy Lin Xi Yi of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: \"Xu Wugui\" (Chapter Twenty-Four)**\n\nXu Wugui, through Nü Shang, was granted an audience with Marquis Wu of Wei. The marquis greeted him, saying, \"Master, you must be weary—enduring the toils of mountain and forest, yet still willing to meet with this lonely one.\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"I am weary on your account. What weariness have you endured for me? If you indulge your desires and prolong your likes and dislikes, the true nature of your life and destiny will sicken. If you suppress your desires and restrain your likes and dislikes, your ears and eyes will suffer. I weary myself for you—what weariness have you endured for me?\"\n\nMarquis Wu, startled, made no reply. After a moment, Xu Wugui continued, \"Let me tell you: I judge dogs. The lowest kind stops when full—this is the virtue of a wildcat. The middling kind gazes fixedly like the sun. The highest kind seems to have forgotten its singular nature. Indulging desires and prolonging likes and dislikes severs the principle of life and destiny; abandoning desires and likes and dislikes abruptly disrupts the constant function of ears and eyes—both are sickness. *Kan* (掔) is pronounced as *pan*, meaning to pull back. *Lide* (狸德) refers to a dog of the lowest grade, whose nature is like that of a wildcat. The phrase 'gazes fixedly like the sun' describes unwavering focus, eyes unblinking. 'Its singular nature' means its life is as if dead. Thus, it is said to have 'forgotten its singularity'—like a wooden chicken, motionless. This is the highest grade.\n\nYet judging dogs is not as good as judging horses. A straight horse meets the plumb line; a curved one, the hook; a square one, the carpenter’s square; a round one, the compass—these are the state’s horses. But they do not compare to the world’s horses. The world’s horses possess innate talent—like a plumb line, yet seeming lost; like having forgotten their singular nature. Such horses surpass all, leaving no trace, their destination unknown.\"\n\nMarquis Wu was greatly pleased and laughed.\n\n\"When a horse meets the rules of plumb line, carpenter’s square, hook, and compass, it means every part of its body conforms to principle—these terms are borrowed from geometry and need not be taken literally. 'Innate talent' refers to natural endowment. 'Like a plumb line, yet seeming lost' describes a state of deep absorption. 'Forgotten its singularity' is the same as 'lost its singularity.' 'Destination unknown' means it moves without knowing where it halts. All these are metaphors. Marquis Wu grasped the meaning of effortless spontaneity and was thus greatly pleased, laughing.\"\n\nWhen Xu Wugui departed, Nü Shang asked, \"Master, how did you alone delight our lord?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"How I delight my lord: when admonishing him, I use the *Book of Poetry*, the *Book of Documents*, ritual, and music; when guiding him, I employ the *Golden Tablets* and the *Six Strategies*. Those who serve him and achieve great merit are too numerous to count, yet my lord has never once opened his mouth. How did you delight him so that he was pleased like this?\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"I simply told him how I judge dogs and horses.\"\n\nNü Shang said, \"Is that all?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"Have you not heard of the exiles of Yue? After a few days away from their state, they rejoice upon seeing acquaintances. After a month, they rejoice upon seeing those they once knew in their homeland. After a year, they rejoice even upon seeing those who merely resemble their countrymen. Is it not true that the longer one is parted from others, the deeper the longing grows? Those who flee into the emptiness of the wilderness stumble over brambles and trip over stumps, following the paths of shrews and weasels. Yet when they hear the sound of human footsteps, they are overjoyed. How much more so when it is the voices of brothers and kin at their side?\"",

      "translated_text": "Long indeed has it been since the words of a true person echoed at our lord’s side!\n\nThe *Gold Tablets and Six Bow-Cases* refer to the *Military Methods of the Grand Duke*. This text is stored in the court, hence called \"gold tablets,\" much like books kept in golden coffers or stone chambers. The terms \"vertical\" and \"horizontal\" describe its shifting, multifaceted strategies—they should not be rigidly equated with the *Book of Songs* or *Book of Documents*. \"Serving in attendance\" means serving the king’s affairs. Since the teachings of the *Book of Songs*, *Book of Documents*, and *Six Bow-Cases* have proven effective in practice, it is said that \"serving in attendance has brought great merit.\" \"Parting the lips\" means to smile.\n\n\"Exiles\" are those who have fled their state. \"Acquaintances\" are old friends. \"Those once seen\" are merely familiar faces. \"Those who resemble people\" are those who look like their countrymen. \"Paths in the mountains\" are called \"the trails of shrews and weasels.\" \"Obstructed\" means blocked. *Liang* (踉) is pronounced *lang*; the *Sheng* chapter says it describes the appearance of wanting to move. *Wei* (位) means to dwell or stop, indicating exhaustion—wanting to move but stopping, crouching in the valley. \"Empty valley\" refers to a desolate ravine. Hearing the sound of footsteps brings joy, for it is the presence of a person, not necessarily an acquaintance or countryman. This suggests that Marquis Wu’s innate truth had been lost for so long that hearing such words was like one fleeing through an empty valley hearing footsteps—hence his joy. This is what Chan Buddhists call \"a long journey returning home.\"\n\n*Qingkai* (謦欬) refers to the sound from the throat.\n\nWhen Xu Wugui met Marquis Wu, the marquis said, \"Master, you dwell in the mountains and forests, eating acorns and chestnuts, spurning onions and leeks—yet you have long honored me with your presence. Are you now old and desiring the taste of wine and meat? Or is it that I, too, possess the good fortune of the altars of soil and grain?\"\n\nXu Wugui replied, \"Wugui was born in poverty and lowliness and has never dared to partake of your lordship’s wine and meat. I have come to trouble you.\"\n\nThe marquis asked, \"How so? In what way do I trouble you?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"I trouble your lordship’s spirit and form.\"\n\nThe marquis asked, \"What do you mean?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"The nurturing of Heaven and Earth is such that ascending high cannot be made permanent, nor can dwelling low be made brief. Yet you alone, as the lord of ten thousand chariots, exhaust the people of an entire state to nourish your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth. The spirit does not permit this. The spirit favors harmony and detests perversity, for perversity is sickness. Thus, I trouble you—what sickness afflicts you?\"\n\nThe marquis said, \"I have long wished to see you, Master. I wish to love the people and practice righteousness, to lay down arms—is this possible?\"\n\nXu Wugui said, \"No. Loving the people is the beginning of harming them. Practicing righteousness and laying down arms is the root of raising arms. If you proceed thus, you will likely fail. All achievements, whether good or bad, are instruments. Though you practice benevolence and righteousness, you will verge on hypocrisy. Form inevitably produces form; change inevitably arises from what is external. You must not array fine cranes between the ornate towers, nor keep swift steeds in the palace of carved eaves. Do not store rebellion in your gains. Do not seek to overcome others with skill, nor with schemes, nor with war. Those who kill people, those who seize others’ lands—do they nourish their private desires and spirits through war? Who can say which is better, victory or defeat? If you, my lord, cannot desist, then cultivate sincerity within your heart to respond to the feelings of Heaven and Earth, and do not disturb the people’s deaths—thus you will be freed. What need will you then have to lay down arms?\"",

Thus it is said: the nurturing of Heaven and Earth. Each and every one is alike. Ascending heights does not make one tall, nor does dwelling below make one short—there is no analogy of noble or base. That which nurtures externally is form, yet within the heart there is no self-contentment; thus it is said: the spirit does not permit itself. Harmony means harmonizing with things and becoming one with them. Selfishness arises from the private self. The spirit within me, received from Heaven, is fundamentally one with the myriad things. Desires and selfishness harm this unity—this is what it abhors. To abhor selfishness is to sicken the spirit. If you, my lord, suffer from this sickness yet do not recognize what ails you, how can I seek to trouble you? Thus it is said: I would trouble you only regarding what afflicts you. To intend to love the people is the very origin of harming them; to intend to lay down arms is the very origin of wielding them—this is peril. Acting with such a heart, you will see only danger and achieve nothing. The completion of good or evil always leaves traces; thus it is called an instrument. To act with a heart set on achievement and to engage in affairs that leave traces is to miss the transformation that transcends such things. Thus it is said: form inevitably produces form—it is fixed. To fix the heart in one place without transformation is to invite conquest, resentment, and desire to arise, wounding what is within.

      "translated_text": "When the heart contends with things, it is called \"external warfare.\" The crane formation resembles the fish-scale array—both are names of battle formations. Foot soldiers are infantry; swift steeds are cavalry. The *Li Qiao* is the gate of palace towers; the *Zi Tan* is the site of sacrificial altars. The ancients performed sacrifices in the roadside chamber, meaning within the palace. The intent is this: if a ruler’s heart engages in struggle with things, then even within a single chamber, all appears as if infantry and cavalry array themselves in battle before him, with nothing but a realm of contention. This is what the Śākya meant by \"all is created by the mind.\"\n\nTo gain is to lose—gaining is a favorable circumstance, losing an adverse one. Without gain, there is no loss. Thus it is said: \"Do not store up adversity in gain.\" The following line—\"gain is also clever cunning\"—refers to the machinations of the heart. Schemes arise from cleverness, and warfare arises from schemes. Seeking victory over others through this, even if one slays their people and seizes their land to gratify one’s private desires of ear and eye, though one may appear victorious, one does not realize that one’s own breast is disturbed by things. The form contends with the spirit; though outwardly victorious, the spirit is wearied. To triumph over others while exhausting one’s own spirit—where lies the gain or loss? Thus it is said: \"One does not know which is better.\" How can this be called victory? Thus it is said: \"Where lies the evil of victory?\" It lies in not being oneself. The ruler should not act thus. Simply cultivate one’s original sincerity to respond to the natural reality of Heaven and Earth, and do not clash or conflict with things. This is victory without contention. If I can achieve victory without contention, the people will escape death and each attain life—what need is there to seek disarmament?\n\nWhen the Yellow Emperor was about to visit the Great Wei on Mount Juci, Fang Ming drove his chariot, Chang Fang rode as the outrider, and Zhang Ruo, Xi Peng, Kun Hun, and Hua Ji followed in the rear carriage. Arriving at the wilds of Xiangcheng, the Seven Sages all became lost, with no one to ask for directions. They happened upon a boy herding horses and inquired of him. The boy said, \"Do you know Mount Juci?\" \"Yes,\" they replied. \"Do you know where the Great Wei resides?\" \"Yes,\" he said. The Yellow Emperor exclaimed, \"How extraordinary! This young boy not only knows Mount Juci but also knows where the Great Wei resides. Allow me to ask about governing the world.\" The boy said, \"Governing the world is no different from this. What more is there to do?\" \"When I was young, I roamed within the Six Directions, but I suffered from a disorder of confusion. An elder taught me, saying, 'If you ride the chariot of the sun and roam the wilds of Xiangcheng, your illness will slightly improve.' Now that my illness has somewhat healed, I am about to roam beyond the Six Directions. Governing the world is no different from this—what more is there to do?\" The Yellow Emperor said, \"Governing the world is indeed not your concern. Nevertheless, allow me to ask about governing the world.\" The boy declined. The Yellow Emperor asked again, \"How does governing the world differ from herding horses?\" The horse-herder replied, \"It is merely a matter of removing what harms the horses.\" The Yellow Emperor bowed twice, touched his forehead to the ground, called him the \"Teacher of Heaven,\" and withdrew.\n\nThe Seven Sages refer to the Yellow Emperor, Fang Ming, Chang Fang, Zhang Ruo, Xi Peng, Kun Hun, and Hua Ji—all these names are allegorical. To take the Great Wei as the \"great Dao’s ruggedness\" is a forced interpretation. *Mao* means blurred vision. \"Riding the sun\" means advancing with the sun, that is, daily renewal. To say that within the Six Directions one has not departed from things is to suffer from self-inflicted confusion. To be able to depart from this illness and roam in spontaneity is to be beyond the Six Directions. The meaning is that governing the world is the same—simply free from entanglement within the realm of things. \"Not your concern\" means you are a person beyond things; though you need not partake in this, you must still explain it to me. Horses are herded in groups, each following water and grass. Simply follow their nature and cause them no harm, and the way of herding horses is complete. This is also the meaning of herding sheep by driving them from behind. \"Teacher of Heaven\" means that the heavens and humans can be one’s teachers.\n\nScholars who lack the transformations of thought are not joyful; debaters who lack the order of discourse are not joyful; inspectors who lack the affairs of scrutiny are not joyful—all are confined by things. The transformations of thought refer to the hundred kinds of mental shifts; the order of discourse means that speech attains coherence; *ling* means overbearing, *sui* means interrogation. Those who delight in scrutiny contend with others over the smallest details. All three follow their strengths and take pride in them, so that a single day without them brings no joy. These are people ensnared by the desires of things. Thus it is said: \"confined by things.\"\n\nThose who summon the world serve in the court; those who honor the common people glory in office; those of physical strength boast of difficulty; the brave delight in peril; warriors rejoice in war; the withered and emaciated cherish fame; legalists expand governance; those who respect appearances value propriety and benevolence; and those who esteem connections prize relationships. \"Summoning the world\" means rising to stand in the court; \"honoring the world\" refers to those who establish their reputation through their descendants—these are the vain. \"Common people\" are the mediocre; \"glory in office\" means taking rank and salary as honor. \"Physical strength\" refers to those with talent and ability; \"boasting of difficulty\" means taking the resolution of crises as a source of pride. \"Brave\" are warriors; \"delighting in peril\" means rejoicing in danger. The withered and emaciated are recluses; \"cherishing fame\" means being preoccupied with reputation. \"Legalists\" are those of the legalist school; \"expanding governance\" means seeking to manage many affairs. \"Respecting appearances\" means maintaining a dignified demeanor as external adornment; \"esteeming connections\" means valuing social relations.\n\nFarmers without the affairs of tilling and weeding are not content; merchants without the affairs of markets and streets are not content. The common people have their daily occupations and thus encourage the hundred crafts; artisans have the skill of tools and thus take pride. \"Tilling and weeding\" refers to the work of cultivation; \"markets and streets\" refer to the affairs of commerce. \"Daily occupations\" means accumulating surplus day by day; \"encourage\" means delighting in and applying oneself. Artisans take pride in their abilities. Without the accumulation of wealth, the greedy worry; without the prominence of power, the boastful grieve. The more extreme the circumstances, the greater their joy in change. The boastful and deceitful flock to power; a single setback brings them sorrow. *You* means extreme; the desire for ever-increasing prominence. Those who rely on something are called *shi*; those who accumulate are called *wu*. The flocking followers are those who attach themselves to the gates of the rich and powerful. They delight in change, taking deceit as pleasure. Petty men who attach themselves prefer activity over stillness, often serving as retainers in households, for only through action can they achieve their ambitions. Thus it is said: \"Those who rely on power and things delight in change.\" From this point onward, the passage on \"not being joyful\" shares the same meaning, merely varying in length and phrasing.",

      "translated_text": "When circumstances call for action, one cannot remain inactive—all this is merely following the sequence of the seasons, not freely transforming through the changes of things. They exhaust their physical nature, submerged in the myriad things, never returning to themselves throughout their lives—how lamentable!\n\n\"When circumstances call for action\" means that the times compel them, leaving their own bodies unfree; though they may wish to practice non-action, they cannot. It is like the growth and completion of all things within a year, each following its proper order. What changes and transforms is not freely determined by the things themselves. Thus it is said: \"following the sequence of the seasons, not freely transforming through the changes of things.\" This phrase serves as a metaphor for the preceding statement. \"Not freely transforming through the changes of things\" means that the transformations are not self-determined by the things.\n\n\"Exhausting their physical nature\" means wearing out their bodies and minds. \"Submerged in the myriad things\" means being engulfed, drowned in the midst of the ten thousand things, spending their entire lives without knowing how to return. \"Return\" here is akin to the Buddhist expression \"turning the light inward to illuminate oneself.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"An archer who hits the target without aiming beforehand is called a skilled archer—could all under heaven then be Yi?\" Huizi said: \"They could.\" Zhuangzi said: \"If there is no universally accepted standard under heaven, and each takes their own as correct, could all under heaven then be Yao?\" Huizi said: \"They could.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Then, with the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, Gongsun Long, and you, that makes five—who is truly correct? Or is it like Lu Ju?\" Lu Ju’s disciple said: \"I have grasped the Master’s Dao! I can warm a cauldron in winter and make ice in summer.\" Lu Ju said: \"This is merely summoning yang with yang and yin with yin—it is not what I call the Dao. Let me show you.\" Thereupon, he tuned two zithers, placing one in the hall and one in the inner chamber. When he struck the *gong* note on one, the *gong* note on the other resonated; when he struck the *jiao* note, the *jiao* note responded—such is the harmony of sound. But if one alters a single string so that it does not correspond to any of the five notes, and then strikes it, all twenty-five strings will vibrate. Though this differs from the resonance of *gong* answering *gong* or *jiao* answering *jiao*, is the ruler of sound not still bound to the strings? How is this different from summoning yin with yin and yang with yang? Yet Lu Ju considered himself superior to his disciple, each taking their own as correct and rejecting the other’s truth. Is this not the same as Huizi’s position?\n\n\"Aiming beforehand\" means having a designated target. Only with a target can one demonstrate skill. If one shoots without a target, then all who hit it would be Yi. This phrase serves as a metaphor for the following statement, and its phrasing is most ingenious. Since there is no single, universally accepted standard under heaven, and each holds to their own, then all could be Yao.\n\nYang refers to Yang Zhu; Gongsun Long is Gongsun Long. The Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, Gongsun Long, and Huizi make five—since their teachings differ, who is truly correct? In the cold of winter, to warm a cauldron without fire, or in the heat of summer, to make ice without water—such defiance of the seasons seems impossible. Yet on the winter solstice, yang qi has already begun to grow, and on the summer solstice, yin qi has already begun to grow. Summoning yang with yang can dispel winter’s cold, and summoning yin with yin can alleviate summer’s heat. Though it appears to defy the seasons, there is a principle by which they can be summoned. Thus it is said: \"This is not what I call the Dao,\" meaning their technique is not yet refined.\n\n\"Placing\" means setting down. One zither is set in the hall, another in the inner chamber. Though they are far apart, when one is struck, the other responds—*gong* answering *gong*, *jiao* answering *jiao*—because their sounds are the same, as in the principle of resonance. But if one adjusts a single string so that it does not correspond to any of the five notes, and then strikes it, even the distant twenty-five strings will vibrate. This is more difficult than *gong* answering *gong* or *jiao* answering *jiao*. Yet, in principle, whether *gong*, *shang*, *jiao*, *zhi*, or *yu*, all are sounds responding to sounds, and none depart from the resonance of the strings’ notes. Thus it is said: \"Though they have not begun to differ from sound.\" How is this different from summoning yin with yin and yang with yang? Lu Ju took himself to be superior to his disciple, each insisting on their own correctness and rejecting the other’s truth. Is this not the same as Huizi’s position?\n\nHuizi said: \"Now, the Confucians, Mohists, Yangists, and Gongsun Long all contend with me in debate, opposing my words, overpowering me with their arguments, and never conceding that I am wrong—what is to be done about this?\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"A man of Qi entrusted his lame son to Song to serve as a gatekeeper, not expecting him to fully guard the gate or seek a *xing* bell, but merely to bind and restrain him in seeking a lost child—yet he never left the domain and still lost something. The man of Chu who was exiled and served as a gatekeeper fought with the boatman in the dead of night when no one was around. Though he never left the cliff, he still managed to incur resentment.\"\n\n\"Opposing my words\" means contending with language. \"Overpowering me with their arguments\" means subduing with reputation. \"Never conceding that I am wrong\" means ultimately insisting on their own correctness.\n\n*Zhi* (蹢) is pronounced like *zhi* (掷), and in the *Shuowen*, it means \"to halt the foot.\" A *zhi* son is one who cannot walk. The man of Qi entrusted his lame son to Song, thinking he could serve as a gatekeeper. To guard a gate, one need not be whole—thus, he considered himself correct. Yet when he sought a *xing* bell, he realized the need to bind and restrain him. Why value things over one’s own child? He had never considered himself wrong. A *xing* bell is a small bell. *Tang* refers to loss. To seek a lost child only within one’s own domain is delusion—yet he never considered himself deluded. This final phrase, \"still lost something,\" does not relate to the preceding *zhi* son. *Yi* (遗) means \"to omit,\" and *sì* () means \"to resemble.\"",

      "translated_text": "These three matters all slightly resemble the followers of Hui Shi, Yang Zhu, and Mo Di—hence the saying, \"there are omissions and resemblances.\" This is akin to the earlier statement, \"if so.\" Yet though it does not culminate in resentment, what precedes it first gives rise to entanglement—precisely the artistry of composition.\n\nConsider the lodger: in Chu, there was a lame gatekeeper sent abroad who could not return on his own. He boarded a boat to come back, and just as they reached the shore in the dead of night, he quarreled with the boatman, forgetting the kindness that had carried him across—thus turning gratitude into enmity. The bank was near; the boat had not yet left the shore, so this was no case of long neglect. *Zhi* means \"to halt the foot\"—a man with a lame foot who served as a gatekeeper, hence called the *zhi*-gatekeeper. In their nighttime quarrel, he surely believed himself correct. Yet when dawn came and he saw clearly, could he feel no shame? During their fight, he too took himself to be right.\n\nThese several lines all employ analogies to mock Hui Shi’s self-righteousness. But because Hui Shi loved debate, Zhuangzi crafted these cunning and elusive words—some too obscure to grasp at once—to confound him. Such was the playful banter between the two in life. One may compare this to Dongfang Shuo’s disputes with his retainers, which share a similar spirit.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi passed by Hui Shi’s grave during a funeral procession, he turned to his followers and said: \"A man of Ying daubed his nose-tip with white clay as thin as a fly’s wing and had Carpenter Shi shave it off. Carpenter Shi swung his axe with such force that the wind whistled, yet he sliced away every trace of clay without harming the nose. The man of Ying stood perfectly still, his composure unshaken. When the Lord of Song Yuan heard of this, he summoned Carpenter Shi and said, 'Try it for me.' The carpenter replied, 'I once could do it—but the one who stood as my target has long been dead. Since the Master’s passing, I have had no one to work with, no one to converse with.'\"\n\n*E* is white clay; he daubed his nose-tip with it, so thin it resembled a fly’s wing, then had Carpenter Shi pare it away. \"Swinging the axe with force\" describes the swiftness of his stroke. The clay was removed without harming the nose—cleaving was difficult enough, yet the man’s steadiness was even harder. This was the very ground for skill. The meaning is this: only with Hui Shi’s eloquence could I exhaust my arguments; now that he is dead, there is no one left to engage with.\n\nWhen Guan Zhong fell ill, Duke Huan asked him, \"Your illness has grown grave—can it not be said that it has reached a critical stage? If it worsens further, where should I turn?\"",

He had never considered himself wrong. A *xing* bell is a small bell. *Tang* refers to loss. To seek a lost child only within one’s own domain is delusion—yet he never considered himself deluded. This final phrase, \"still lost something,\" does not relate to the preceding *zhi* son. *Yi* (遗) means \"to omit,\" and *sì* () means \"to resemble.\"",

This is meant to illustrate that my sons and I sought nothing from the world; how could we have obtained such unexpected joy from Heaven? To follow Heaven and delight in oneself—this is to be nourished by the earth without other desires. To serve the world is to serve; to scheme for oneself is to scheme. When one serves the world and schemes for oneself, it becomes a perversion of the natural Dao. Yet I have never done this with my sons, for we are without intention toward the world.\n\nThus it is said: we do not engage in its affairs, we do not partake in its schemes, we do not share in its anomalies. To drift and meander is to follow the natural course. We do not seek to respond to affairs, nor do we know whether affairs are fitting or not—hence it is said, “we do not engage in its affairs as they should be.” *Chang* means to repay a debt. While I delight in non-action, their association with me and the lord’s shared table means that within the allotment of our fate, this worldly debt remains unpaid. Such is the mutual strangeness of these omens.\n\nMy sons ought not to have received this—what comes must harbor some discordant anomaly. Thus it is called “strange conduct.” Duke Qu’s street refers to a gate facing the thoroughfare, where he served as a gatekeeper.

      "translated_text": "When Nie Que encountered Xu You, he asked, “Where are you going?”\nXu You replied, “I am fleeing from Yao.”\nNie Que said, “What do you mean?”\nXu You answered, “Yao, with his boundless benevolence, makes me fear he will become a laughingstock to the world and later generations. When people devour one another, the common folk are not hard to gather. If you love them, they draw near; if you benefit them, they come; if you praise them, they are encouraged; but if you bring about what they detest, they scatter. Love and benefit arise from benevolence and righteousness, yet those who abandon benevolence and righteousness are few, while those who profit from them are many. The practice of benevolence and righteousness lacks sincerity and is but a pretense. The greedy, like birds and beasts, exploit it as a tool. Thus, when one man’s judgment is used to benefit the world, it is like a single slice—all under heaven is severed. Yao knows that worthy men benefit the world, yet he does not realize they also harm it. Only those who stand beyond worthiness understand this.\n\nIf you love them, they draw near; if you benefit them, they come; if you praise them, they are encouraged; but if you bring about what they detest, they scatter. Knowing these four, one can gather the people. Yet to bring about what they detest is not what they desire. If you impose what they detest, the people will not return. To follow their likes and dislikes in seeking their allegiance is to indulge in calculation. The practice of benevolence and righteousness is an external, deliberate act—hence it is said to lack sincerity. The greedy, like birds and beasts, may borrow the name of benevolence and righteousness for their own ends—hence it is said to be a pretense. A *mie* means a cut. A single *mie* is like a single slice. If one acts with intent to judge and control, using this to benefit the world, then the world’s pure and natural essence is all sliced apart. Only those who stand beyond worthiness—above the worthy—can see that those who act with intent to benefit the world instead harm it.\n\nThere are those who are *nuan shu*, those who are *ru xu*, and those who are *juan lou*. The *nuan shu* are those who study the words of a single master, then glow with private delight, self-satisfied, believing themselves complete—unaware that nothing has truly begun. Thus they are called *nuan shu*. The *ru xu* are like lice on a pig: they choose sparse bristles, thinking it a vast palace or great park; they nestle in the crooks of hooves, between teats and thighs, believing it a safe and advantageous dwelling—unaware that one day the butcher will roll up his sleeves, spread straw, and wield fire, and they will burn together with the pig. This is advancing or retreating within bounds—what is called *ru xu*. The *juan lou* is Shun. Mutton does not long for ants, but ants long for mutton because mutton is rank. Shun had a rank nature, and the people delighted in him. Thus, when he moved thrice, he founded a city, and by the time he reached Deng’s ruins, a hundred thousand households had gathered. Yao, hearing of Shun’s worthiness, raised him from the barren land, saying, ‘I hope to receive his beneficent influence.’ Shun was raised from the barren land when his years were already advanced, his hearing and sight already dimmed.”",
      "overlap_context": "non-action, their association with me and the lord’s shared table means that within the allotment of our fate, this worldly debt remains unpaid. Such is the mutual strangeness of these omens.\n\nMy sons ought not to have received this—what comes must harbor some discordant anomaly. Thus it is called “strange conduct.” Duke Qu’s street refers to a gate facing the thoroughfare, where he served as a gatekeeper. This passage further speaks of how human affairs may yield the unexpected—such is destiny.",

      "translated_text": "The so-called *juan lou* is one who cannot rest or return—this describes the self-satisfaction of shallow vision. Here, it satirizes those who delight in learning yet do not understand the words of the unknowing: \"There has never been a thing.\" They do not grasp the wonder of non-being. *Ru xu* refers to one who is mired and dependent, a person clinging to power and profit. *Shu lie* means the sparse bristles of a pig; *qu wei*, the crooks of its hooves; *gu jiao*, the area beneath the belly near the legs—this is like a beggar warming himself by a fire or leaning on an iceberg, for what one relies upon is not truly reliable. *Yu* means confining one’s heart within the bounds of wealth and honor without self-awareness. Thus it is said: advancing or retreating within bounds. *Juan lou* describes one who stoops and labors, tormenting himself. Its meaning is this: those who cultivate virtue believe themselves renowned, and the people flock to them, only to become a burden, toiling endlessly without respite. This is used to mock and ridicule emperors and kings.\n\n*Tong tu* means barren land, referring to the place where one first dwelled—an uninhabited waste. Thus the spiritual person shuns the multitude, for where the multitude gathers, there is no harmony; without harmony, there is no benefit, only self-harm. Embracing virtue and warming harmony to comply with the world—this is called the true person. With ants, they abandon knowledge; with fish, they gain strategy; with sheep, they abandon intention. The true person’s eyes see with the eyes, ears hear with the ears, and the heart reflects with the heart. In this way, their equilibrium is as level as a carpenter’s line, and their changes follow the natural course.\n\nThe true person of old awaited Heaven and did not impose human will upon it. In life, they gained it; in death, they lost it. In death, they gained it; in life, they lost it. Where the multitude gathers, it is where people converge. Without harmony, there is no benefit—only self-harm. Embracing virtue and warming harmony means nurturing one’s power without display; *yang* refers to inner warmth. Ants are the most insignificant creatures, yet even they cannot fully abandon knowledge. Sheep are the most foolish, yet even they cannot fully abandon intention. Only the true person is without knowledge, without intention. Thus it is said: with ants, they abandon knowledge; with sheep, they abandon intention. Fish in water are leisurely and content; the true person’s self-strategy is like that of a fish. Here, water is likened to the Creator, and the fish to the self.\n\nAnts and sheep seek sustenance externally and cannot be without desire, unlike fish. The true person’s heart, ears, and eyes are the same as others’, but they do not employ them with intention. Thus it is said: the eyes see with the eyes, the ears hear with the ears, the heart reflects with the heart. Their equilibrium is as level as a line, and their changes follow the natural course. They do not impose human will upon Heaven. In life, it may seem like gain or loss; in death, it may seem like gain or loss. They do not regard life and death as gain or loss, allowing whatever comes—whether life is called gain or death is called gain, whether death is called loss or life is called loss.\n\nMedicine is called by one name, yet its substance may be *jin*, *jie geng*, *ji yong*, or *shi ling*. At times, it serves as the emperor. What can be said of this? *Jin* is Sichuan aconite; *ji yong*, the seed of the fox nut; *shi ling*, the fungus *Polyporus umbellatus*. Physicians prepare medicines according to their use, each with its own purpose. The primary ingredient is called the emperor; the others, ministers—what is called medicine is in truth the same, differing only in weight according to use. This is like people in the world: when their time comes and they are employed, they are noble; when their time does not come, they are base. Yet in themselves, they are neither noble nor base. These few lines are extraordinary.\n\nGoujian relied on three thousand men in armor and shields, taking refuge at Mount Kuaiji. Only Fan Li knew how to preserve the state from ruin; only Fan Li did not know how to spare himself from sorrow. Thus it is said: the owl’s eyes have their use, the crane’s legs have their joints to be severed—how lamentable! Minister Fan Li enabled Goujian to avenge Wu from the brink of destruction, which was wise indeed, yet he did not realize that this would lead to his own demise. When Fan Li was first employed, he was the emperor of the medicine; when he was later killed, it was another time. The owl’s eyes are useful at night but not by day—this too depends on the time. The crane’s legs, though long, cannot be severed; if severed, they are no longer useful. This means the crane’s stance, with legs sometimes extended or bent, must also adapt to the time.\n\nThus it is said: when the wind passes over a river, it diminishes it; when the sun passes over a river, it diminishes it. If only the wind and sun were to remain together by the river, the river would not yet feel their encroachment. This is because it relies on its source. The wind and sun over the river both diminish the water, yet the river does not feel diminished because its source is long. Its source arises from the natural, so though things may diminish it, it remains untroubled. These five lines form a single idea: *zhi* means only; *qing* means to cause. It speaks of the wind and sun remaining together by the river without departing.\n\nThus water guards earth, the shadow guards the person, and things guard things—this is certain. Water and earth naturally intermingle; form and shadow naturally depend on one another, guarding without separation. Things guard things as water flows to the wet and fire seeks the dry—what is of Heaven inclines upward, what is of Earth inclines downward. *Shen* means certain, true. It speaks of an unchanging principle in the world, one that cannot be altered. From these three *shen* characters, one understands that in the seventh chapter, *yuan ming zhi shen* cannot be replaced with *pan*.\n\nThus the eyes’ reliance on brightness is perilous; the ears’ reliance on sharpness is perilous; the heart’s pursuit of things is perilous. All abilities within the organs are perilous. When peril accumulates, it cannot be remedied; calamity grows ever more concentrated. *Dai* means danger. To employ brightness with intention, to employ sharpness with intention, to pursue things with intention—none of these are the way to self-preservation. Thus it is said: all abilities within the organs are perilous. *Fu* refers to the organs; wisdom arises from the chest and organs, yet those who believe themselves capable are all in danger. Thus it is said: all abilities within the organs are perilous. *Bu ji* means insufficient. Once danger has formed, it is too late to change. *Zi cui* means ever-increasing. Its reversal follows from seeking merit; its fruition depends on long scheming. Yet people regard this as their treasure—is this not lamentable? Thus there are those who lose their states and slaughter their people without end, never questioning the cause.\n\nIts reversal comes from pursuing merit; *yuan* means to follow. Following the heart that schemes for merit will inevitably lead to self-destruction. *Guo* means inevitable. Those who scheme for the long term harden their hearts and do not change—all this harms the self, yet people delight in it as if it were a treasure. Thus it is said: people regard it as their treasure. From ancient times to the present, those who have lost their states or suffered punishment follow one another without end, all because they do not question this—meaning they do not follow the Way.",

      "translated_text": "Thus, when the feet tread upon the earth, though they tread but little, they rely on what they do not tread to achieve breadth. Human knowledge is scant, yet only by relying on what they do not know do they come to know what Heaven intends. When a person walks upon the earth, the ground their two feet tread is but a small portion; if all the earth were shaved away, leaving only enough to hold the feet, walking would become difficult. To journey far, beyond what the feet tread, there must be ground the feet do not tread—only then can one travel great distances. *Tian* here also means \"to tread,\" and this sentence serves as a metaphor for the one below. How much can a person truly know? What they do not know is all of Heaven. If one does not rely on what they know but instead on what they do not know, then they know Heaven.\n\nTo know the Great Oneness, to know the Great Yin, to know the Great Eye, to know the Great Balance, to know the Great Square, to know the Great Faithfulness, to know the Great Constancy—this is perfection. The Great Oneness unites all; the Great Yin dissolves all; the Great Eye sees all; the Great Balance follows all; the Great Square embodies all; the Great Faithfulness verifies all; the Great Constancy upholds all.\n\nThe Great Oneness is the movement of creation and transformation—Heaven first divides creation from the One. Yin is quiescence; the Great Yin is ultimate quiescence. When quiescence reaches its extreme, there is nothing it does not dissolve—*jie* here is pronounced like \"crab,\" akin to what Buddhist texts call *vimokṣa* (liberation). The Great Eye sees broadly. The Great Balance is the great apportionment; *yuan* means to follow. The Great Square is the Great Void, without corners, a single undifferentiated whole—thus it is called the Great Square. To embody it: the Great Faithfulness is the principle of truth and reality. *Ji* means to decide; knowing this true principle, there is nothing left to doubt. The Great Constancy is the constancy inherent in all things; *chi* means to uphold. To uphold all things under Heaven is this single constant principle.\n\nWhen things reach their utmost, Heaven’s decree appears—thus it is said: \"Utmost, there is Heaven.\" When human affairs are exhausted, Heaven’s principle becomes manifest. Following the natural course, good and ill fortune, honor and disgrace, gain and loss—all their principles become visible—thus it is said: \"Following, there is illumination.\" Within darkness, there is always one who grasps the pivotal essence—this is what is meant by \"holding the reins and guiding the net.\" Thus it is said: \"In darkness, there is a pivot.\" The beginning of all things must have something that begins them. The *Qi Wu Lun* says: \"Without that, there is no self; without the self, there is nothing to grasp\"—this is the meaning of *bi* (\"that\"). Thus it is said: \"Beginning, there is that.\" That is the natural principle of creation. Whether called Heaven, illumination, pivot, or that—though it may be dissolved and known, it seems as though it cannot be dissolved or known. To say one does not dare to regard it as knowable or dissolvable is to truly know it. Only by taking the unknown as known does one attain true knowledge.\n\nIn questioning it—it cannot be bounded, nor can it be unbounded. It is slippery and real, unchanging from ancient times to the present, yet it cannot be diminished. Can this not be called a great discourse?\n\nWhy is this questioning? It is to resolve confusion. To dissolve confusion is to return to a state without confusion—this is the greatest absence of confusion. The questioner inquires into the principle of creation. To say, \"I wish to question the principle of creation,\" one cannot regard it as bounded, nor can one regard it as unbounded. *Xie* means stubborn; *hua* means to revolve. The wonder of creation is beyond grasp—ungraspable, it seems as though it were nothing, yet it is truly real. Thus it is said: \"Slippery and real.\" From ancient times to the present, there has only ever been one creation, never replaced, and its use is inexhaustible. How could it ever suffer the slightest diminution? Thus it is said: \"Unchanging from ancient times to the present, yet it cannot be diminished.\" Considering this principle, is this not a grand topic of discussion? *Yang* means to raise; *que* means to expound and debate. Why is this so?",

Thus it is said: \"What confusion?\" Now, by means of this principle of non-doubt, one resolves the doubts of the world and returns once more to the ground of non-doubt, approaching thereby the state of great non-doubt.\n\nWhen Zhaozhou asked Nanquan about the Way of non-doubt, his intent was precisely these few words—indeed, it comes close. The two characters \"non-doubt\" were drummed forth by Zhuangzi, who then composed these several sentences to conclude the entire essay. Truly extraordinary! How does this essay differ from those in the Inner Chapters?\n\nIn the \"Miscellaneous Chapters,\" \"Zeyang\" (Chapter Twenty-Five): Zeyang was traveling in Chu when Yijie spoke of him to the king. The king had not yet met him. Yijie returned to Pengyang, who then saw the king. The king said, \"Why did you not speak to me of this Master?\" Pengyang replied, \"I am not the equal of Gong Yuxiu.\" Pengyang then asked, \"What does Gong Yuxiu do?\" He said, \"In winter, he spears turtles in the Jiang; in summer, he rests in the mountains. When someone passing by asked, 'This is my dwelling,' he replied, 'Yijie was already incapable—how much more so I? I am not the equal of Yijie.' Now, Yijie’s character: though lacking in virtue, he possessed knowledge. He did not esteem himself, yet through this, his interactions became dark and confused. In the realm of wealth and honor, rather than aiding others through virtue, he aided them through dissipation. The frozen borrow clothing in spring; the scorched revert to winter. Cold and wind—such is the nature of the King of Chu. His form is august and severe; in matters of punishment, he grants no pardon, fierce as a tiger. If not for flatterers and those of upright virtue, who could sway him? Thus, when the sage is in straitened circumstances, he causes his household to forget their poverty; when he prospers...\"",

Thus it is said: \"Unchanging from ancient times to the present, yet it cannot be diminished.\" Considering this principle, is this not a grand topic of discussion? *Yang* means to raise; *que* means to expound and debate. Why is this so?",

      "translated_text": "He causes lords and nobles to forget their ranks and emoluments, transforming their arrogance into humility toward all things. In his dealings with the world, he delights in the free flow of things while preserving himself. Thus, at times, without speaking, he offers others harmony through drink; standing beside them, he transforms them, bringing about the proper order between father and son—how could this not be so? Returning home, he remains in quietude, his influence effortless. His effect on others’ hearts is as distant as this. Hence it is said: As for Gongyue Xiu, his surname was Yang, his given name Pengyang, and his courtesy name Yang. Yijie once recommended Yang to the King, but he was not employed and returned home. \"This is my dwelling\" refers to his lack of a fixed abode. Pengyang was fond of advancement, so he used the words of a recluse to admonish him, hoping he would awaken on his own.\n\n\"Lacking virtue but possessing knowledge\" means not recognizing the principles of Heaven and relying solely on private cleverness. \"Spirit\" refers to what is natural within oneself. To be \"dark and confused in interactions\" in the realm of wealth and honor is to become obstinately attached, losing one’s original heart and no longer knowing the natural spirit within. Thus it is said, \"He did not esteem himself, yet through this, his interactions became dark and confused.\" In his dealings with others, rather than mutually cultivating goodness, he led them into a path of self-diminishment. Hence it is said, \"Rather than aiding others through virtue, he aided them through dissipation.\"\n\nThe following lines illustrate this: The frozen, upon receiving clothing, feel the warmth of spring; the scorched, upon receiving wind, feel the chill of winter. This speaks of how people should assist one another by using their surplus to relieve others’ deficiencies. Pengyang’s fondness for advancement was his deficiency, and my warning him to withdraw was like offering a fan to one scorched by heat or clothing to one freezing—it would benefit him.\n\n\"His form is august and severe\" means he relied on his power to overawe his subordinates. \"In matters of punishment, he grants no pardon, fierce as a tiger\" shows his lack of benevolence. \"To sway\" means to humble oneself. If not for flatterers and those of upright virtue, who could bend him to their will? Here, \"those of upright virtue\" refers to true petty men.\n\nThe following lines all speak of the sage who, though reclusive, harbors no desire for advancement or employment: Lords and nobles are exalted, yet he makes them forget their ranks and emoluments, humbling themselves to scholars and transforming their arrogance into humility. He exhausts the principles of all things to find joy for himself, hence it is said, \"In his dealings with the world, he delights in the free flow of things while preserving himself.\" In his interactions with others, he follows the principles of all things without obstruction, preserving his true nature and finding joy in it. Hence it is said, \"He delights in the free flow of things while preserving himself.\"\n\nThere is a teaching without words that can enlighten others, like offering them the purest harmony to drink—what the Buddhist scriptures call \"drinking the finest ghee.\" A glance conveys the Dao; a composed demeanor influences others’ intentions. Thus it is said, \"Standing beside them, he transforms them.\" As the *Book of Songs* says, \"That man—if he were to return and dwell at home...\" This line is inverted; the meaning is that if that man were to return home, the proper order between high and low, elder and younger would be established. Hence it is said, \"bringing about the proper order between father and son—how could this not be so?\" Returning home, his influence is effortless, hence it is said, \"he remains in quietude, his influence effortless.\" This means that whether at home or in his village, all is in harmony.\n\n\"His effect on others’ hearts is as distant as this\" means that people’s capacities differ so greatly. This refers to the vast difference between Gongyue Xiu’s heart and Pengyang’s. \"I am not the equal of Yijie\" means that Yijie was a flatterer, also fond of advancement. He recommended you to the King—how could I be like him? This expresses disdain for Yijie.\n\n[The line \"bringing about the proper order between father and son—how could this not be so? Returning home\" is a single sentence.]\n\nWhen the sage prospers, he weaves all things together, exhausting their unity without being aware of it—this is his nature. He moves and acts, taking Heaven as his teacher. Others follow and name him as such. Yet how can one who is troubled by knowledge ever find rest in their actions? How can they cease?\n\n\"Weaving together\" refers to the ceaseless interplay of yin and yang in creation. \"Unity\" means the fusion of the refined and the coarse. The sage comprehends the principles of creation, exhausting the wondrous unity of the refined and the coarse. He follows nature without being aware of it, hence it is said, \"this is his nature.\" \"Nature\" is what is natural. \"Moves and acts\" refers to activity and action. All activity and action return to the mandate of Heaven, taking nature as their master, hence it is said, \"taking Heaven as his teacher.\" \"Names him\" means to bestow a title. People follow the sage’s example and name him as such—what intention did the sage originally have? Hence it is said, \"Others follow and name him as such.\"\n\n\"Troubled by knowledge\" means that private cleverness gives rise to endless worries, with countless calculations. How many of these calculations can be realized? Hence it is said, \"their actions are rarely successful.\" If I intend to act but am hindered by fate, others are the same. Why is this? Because fate has its limits. \"How can they cease?\" refers to fate and limits. These two lines thoroughly explore the human condition, tracing all afflictions to the beginning of knowledge. If one knew what one does not know, there would be no worries.\n\nThus, the following uses the analogy of a beautiful mirror: One who is beautiful from birth is given a mirror; if not told, they do not know their beauty surpasses others. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, their joy is endless. Others’ fondness for them is also endless—this is their nature. The sage’s love for others is given a name; if not told, they do not know of his love for others. Whether they know or do not know, hear or do not hear, his love for others is endless. Others’ comfort in this is also endless—this is their nature.\n\nBeauty arises from ugliness; if not told of their ugliness, they would not know their own beauty. The distinction between beauty and ugliness, good and evil, is the source of worries. Hence it is said, \"Whether they know or do not hear, their joy is endless.\" Since I make no distinction between beauty and ugliness and interact with things without intention, others’ fondness for me is also endless—this is the principle of nature. The analogy of the beautiful mirror also extends to the sage’s love for others. The meaning is that if love for others becomes a name, it involves intention, and intention departs from the original true nature.\n\nGazing upon one’s old state and old capital brings joy. Even if nine-tenths of the hills, grass, and trees were to encroach upon them, the joy would remain. How much more so for what one sees and hears? A hundred-foot tower stands amidst the crowd. Ran Xiangshi grasped the center of the ring, adapting to all things without end or beginning, without limit or time. He merged with the transformations of things, becoming one with them—unchanging himself. He once abandoned this.",

      "translated_text": "Returning from a long journey to behold one’s old state and old capital must evoke a sense of joy—this speaks of the stirring of feeling. Even if, upon entering the old state, its people and things have changed, and the hills are overgrown with grass and trees, nine-tenths altered from former days, so long as a single part remains familiar, that joy persists. How much more so for one who seeks the Dao, who suddenly awakens to perceive what they have always seen and hear what they have always heard—all things in their original, inherent state? Could they not rejoice? This is what the Buddha meant by \"original face\" and \"native scenery\"—precisely this meaning. The hundred-foot tower is its highest point.\n\n\"County\" refers to the display of music; \"among the crowd\" means the interweaving of reed pipes and bells. Standing in so lofty a place, hearing the layered, alternating music, one may stir the ears and eyes of the common world. How much more so for the ancient sages, who followed the principle of emptiness, non-action, and naturalness, delighting in all things—how exalted was their station! The analogy of the ring’s center is that of emptiness. Without end, without beginning, end and beginning are as one. Without limit, without time, there is no past or present. \"Limit\" refers to the changes of seasons. \"Daily transforming with things\" means moving together with them, ever renewing. Yet what one attains remains unchanging—this is how it is put into practice.\n\n\"To abandon\" means to leave; \"why\" asks for what reason. It questions why worldly people do not cast off their habitual ways and return to the ultimate Dao. Ran Xiangshi was an ancient sage. To take Heaven as one’s teacher yet fail to truly follow Heaven is to be enslaved by things in one’s affairs. What can be done about this? The sage never begins with Heaven, never begins with man, never begins with a beginning, never begins with things. They move with the world without ceasing, their conduct complete yet not confined to any one path. How could it be otherwise?\n\nTang received Yi Yin as his charioteer, with Menyin Dengheng as his tutor, learning from his teacher without being bound by him, attaining the ability to follow transformations—this was his office in name. \"To take Heaven as one’s teacher yet fail to truly follow Heaven\" means to take naturalness as one’s model yet not be burdened by the name of naturalness, merely harmonizing with things. Thus it is said, \"to be enslaved by things.\" If one has intention in one’s affairs, what can be done? The moment there is intention in affairs, it is no longer natural.\n\nMan has action; Heaven has non-action. Not only are there no traces of action, but even the absence of action is absent. Thus it is said, \"never begins with Heaven, never begins with man\"—these are traces. \"Never begins with things\" means no traces of things. Not only are there no traces of things, but even the absence of traces is absent. Thus it is said, \"never begins with a beginning, never begins with things.\" Moving through this world, they are never apart from others in the human realm, never neglecting affairs. Thus it is said, \"they move with the world without ceasing,\" without neglect. All actions are complete yet not attached to any single one. Thus it is said, \"their conduct is complete yet not confined.\" *Equalizing Things* speaks of this as \"old and confined\"—\"confined\" meaning mired and drowned in attachment.\n\nTo be one with the Dao is to unite without seeking; if one seeks to unite with the Dao, it cannot be attained. Thus it is said, \"how could it be otherwise?\" In Tang’s case with Yi Yin, he studied under him and later made him his minister. Zhuangzi, however, altered the names and titles, calling his office \"Charioteer\" and saying \"Menyin Dengheng\"—these are merely such strange and deceptive words. \"Tutor\" means assistant; it speaks of Yi Yin assisting Tang. Though Tang took Yi Yin as his teacher, he was not confined by him.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: \"to follow a teacher yet not be confined.\" Tang’s non-action was such that he grasped the inherent principles of the myriad things and followed them, abiding in the realm of non-action and spontaneity. He allowed his assisting minister Yi Yin to bear the name of office, hence it is said, \"he attained their following and completion, appointing them to their names.\" This speaks of Tang’s non-action and Yi Yin’s action—Tang without name, Yi Yin with name. *Si* (司) means \"to preside\"; it speaks of Menyin bearing many names of action. These names are *ying* (嬴), a surplus, meaning \"excess.\" It is to say that such names in the world are superfluous, like \"long things.\" *Liang jian* (两见) means \"to see both,\" body and name as two. If one has intent toward making a name, one cannot attain the undifferentiated unity. Thus it is said, \"he attained their duality.\"\n\nYi Yin’s bearing of these names was not yet extraordinary, yet Confucius again admired him, exhausting his thoughts and plans to serve as an assistant in this world—this speaks of the Master desiring to do as Yi Yin had done. This is mockery of the sage. Rongchengshi borrowed the names of ancient sages. Combining three hundred and sixty days makes one year; if one removes them day by day, one can only call them \"days,\" not a \"year.\" Thus it is said, \"remove the days, and there is no year.\" This line is excellent. Laozi said, \"count the spokes, and there is no wheel\"—it is of the same meaning. The name of \"external\" arises from the \"internal\"; without the internal, there is no external. Thus it is said, \"without internal, without external.\" These two lines demonstrate the meaning of spontaneity.\n\nWei Ying (King Hui of Wei) made a pact with Tian Mou (King Wei of Qi), but Tian Mou betrayed it. Wei Ying, enraged, was about to send an assassin. Xishou, hearing of this, found it shameful and said, \"You are a lord of ten thousand chariots, yet you would follow the path of a commoner in seeking vengeance? Let me request two hundred thousand armored troops to attack him, capturing his people, seizing his oxen and horses, and making his lord’s back break out in boils. Only after he flees his state will I strike his back and break his spine.\" Jizi, hearing of this, found it shameful and said, \"To build a city wall seventy feet high, then tear it down—this is the suffering of penal laborers. Now, for seven years, there has been no war; this is the foundation of your rule. Yan (Xishou) is a disturber of order and cannot be heeded.\" Huazi, hearing of this, found it disgraceful and said, \"Those who speak well of attacking Qi are disturbers of order; those who speak well of not attacking are also disturbers of order. To say that both attacking and not attacking are disturbances—this is yet another disturbance. My lord, you should seek the Dao alone.\"\n\nWei Ying was King Hui of Wei; Tian Mou was King Wei of Qi. *Xumi* refers to those sentenced to penal labor, who suffer when a completed wall is torn down. Seven years without war was a fine achievement of the King of Wei, yet Xishou urged him to use troops, like tearing down a completed wall. Yan was Xishou’s name. Huazi’s words implied that any mention of \"attack\" involved intent, so all three were disturbers of order. With the Dao, one does not speak of troops at all. Thus it is said, \"My lord, you should seek the Dao alone.\"\n\nHuizi, hearing this, went to see Dai Jinren. Jinren said, \"There is a creature called the snail—do you know of it?\" The king said, \"Yes.\" Jinren continued, \"On the left horn of the snail is a state called Chushi; on the right horn is a state called Manshi. They often fought over territory, leaving tens of thousands of corpses, and pursued the fleeing army for fifteen days before returning.\" The king said, \"Alas! Are these empty words?\" Jinren replied, \"Let me make them real for you. In your mind, do the four directions, above and below, have limits?\" The king said, \"They are limitless.\" Jinren said, \"To roam the mind in the limitless and return to the state of passage—does it seem to exist or not?\" The king said, \"Yes.\" Jinren said, \"Within the state of passage is Wei; within Wei is Liang; within Liang is the king. Is there any difference between you and Manshi?\" The king said, \"There is no difference.\" The guest departed, and the king was lost in thought, as if something were missing.\n\nWhen the guest left, Huizi saw the king and said, \"That guest is a great man—even a sage is not his equal.\" Huizi said, \"Blowing into a pipe produces a sound, but blowing into a sword’s hilt produces only a faint *xue* sound. Yao and Shun are praised by people, but to speak of Yao and Shun before Dai Jinren is like that faint *xue* sound.\" This passage is excellent. Huizi, hearing Huazi speak of seeking the Dao, recommended Dai Jinren to the king. Dai Jinren was a man of the Dao. The snail’s horn analogy seems like empty words, but what follows makes it real. Thus it is said, \"Let me make them real for you.\" The limitless is the great void; the \"state of passage\" is the central kingdom. Viewing the central kingdom from the great void makes it seem tiny, as if existing or not. Thus it is said, \"Does it seem to exist or not?\" Du Fu said, \"Looking down, there is only qi\"—this is the same meaning. Viewing Wei from the central kingdom makes it small; Liang is its capital. Within Wei, the capital is even smaller; within the capital, the king’s person is even more minute. From the great void above, descending step by step, the king’s person and the snail’s Manshi and Chushi are no different. Thus it is said, \"Is there any difference?\" *Changran ruo you wang* means being lost in thought, realizing the insignificance of their conflict.\n\nA pipe has holes, like a flute or reed; though it lacks melody, blowing into it still produces a sound. But blowing into a sword’s hilt produces only a faint *xue* sound, meaning it is entirely without sound. This implies that before a man of the Dao, even speaking of benevolence, righteousness, the Dao, or principle would have no place for sound.\n\nWhen Confucius traveled to Chu, he lodged at the thatched hut of Ant Hill. A neighbor, a man with his wife, concubine, and servants, climbed to the roof. Zilu said, \"What is this crowd doing?\" Confucius said, \"This is the servant of a sage. He buries himself among the people, hides in the wilderness, his voice silenced, his ambitions boundless. Though he speaks, his heart never speaks. He goes against the world, his mind disdaining to follow it—this is one who sinks in the land.\" Zilu said, \"Is this Shina Yiliao?\" Zilu asked to summon him. Confucius said, \"Enough. He knows I am known to him, knows I am traveling to Chu, and thinks I will surely have the King of Chu summon him. He would consider me a flatterer. If that is so, he would be ashamed to hear my words, let alone meet me in person. How could he still be there?\" Zilu went to see, but his house was empty.",

      "translated_text": "At Ant Mound there lived a family that sold broth. The Master lodged at their home. Those who climbed to the roof ascended to its highest point to gaze upon the people below—so many, so bustling. The \"servant of a sage\" refers to a disciple of the sage, one who buries himself among the people, concealing himself among his neighbors, unknown even to those nearby. \"His voice silenced\" means he flees from fame. \"Sinking\" is not in water but on land, likening his concealment to one who hides in the marketplace. This man must be a disciple of Shina Yiliao. Yiliao, surnamed Xiong, dwelled in the southern market of Chu. \"Known to him\" means he surely knows me. A \"flatterer\" is one who speaks excessively. \"How could he still be there?\" means he must have departed and not remained. His house was empty because he fled, fearing the Master would speak of him to the King of Chu and summon him, so he escaped.\n\nThe Warden of Changwu asked Zilao, \"When governing, do not act recklessly; when ruling the people, do not act carelessly.\" He continued, \"In the past, when I cultivated grain, if I plowed recklessly, the harvest repaid me recklessly. If I weeded carelessly, the harvest repaid me carelessly. The following year, I changed my methods: I deepened the plowing and thoroughly harrowed the soil, and the grain flourished and grew abundant. I was sated for the entire year.\"\n\nZhuangzi heard this and said, \"Nowadays, when people cultivate their bodies and order their minds, many resemble what the Warden describes: they flee from their Heaven, depart from their nature, extinguish their emotions, and lose their spirit, taking the common as their norm. Those who recklessly treat their nature allow the sprouts of desire and aversion to become their nature. Like reeds and rushes, like bulrushes and reeds, they first sprout, then support our form, gradually uprooting our nature. Together they fester and leak, erupting without choosing where, giving rise to wandering sores, scabies, ulcers, internal abscesses, and wasting diseases—such is the result.\"\n\nThe Warden used plowing to illustrate governance; Zhuangzi, in turn, used it to illustrate learning. Su Dongpo’s *On Farming* follows this same pattern. \"Changed his methods\" means altering his approach. \"Sated\" means being full from eating. \"Taking the common as their norm\" means such people are numerous in the world. \"Aversion\" refers to dislikes. \"Sprouts\" are pernicious growths. The harm of likes and dislikes obstructs and blocks our original nature, like reeds choking a heart. Once nature is obstructed, the growth of deluded desires, like the first sprouts of bulrushes, fills the body—every part becomes consumed by human desire. \"Support\" means to aid. When desires assist the form, sight, hearing, speech, movement, rest, and diet all lose their natural principles. Thus, it is said, \"gradually uprooting our nature.\" \"Gradually\" means little by little; \"uprooting\" means to pull out. At first, true nature is merely obstructed, but as it worsens, it is gradually torn away, until Heavenly principle is utterly destroyed. Once true nature is lost, qi also becomes diseased, giving rise to simultaneous festering and leakage, eruptions without choosing where—any contact breeds illness. \"Simultaneous festering\" refers to wandering sores, scabies, and ulcers—diseases of pus and blood. \"Leakage\" refers to internal abscesses and wasting diseases—what we now call diabetes. This parable serves to warn those in the world who indulge their passions and neglect the Dao, for in the end, they will surely destroy themselves.",

      "translated_text": "Bo Ju studied under Lao Dan, saying, \"I request to travel throughout the world.\" Lao Dan replied, \"Enough! The world is all like this.\" Bo Ju again entreated Lao Dan, \"Where should I begin?\" Lao Dan said, \"Begin with Qi.\"\n\nUpon arriving in Qi, Bo Ju saw a condemned man. He pushed forward and forced his way through, removed his court robes to cover the man, and wailed to Heaven, crying, \"O man! O man! The world suffers great calamity, yet you alone have met it first! Do not steal, do not kill—only when honor and disgrace are established do people see what afflicts them; only when wealth and property are amassed do people see what they contend over. Now, by establishing what afflicts people and amassing what they contend over, you exhaust their strength without respite—how could this not reach such a state?\"\n\n*\"The world is all like this\"* means that the world is everywhere thus. *\"Do not steal, do not kill\"* means: was it for stealing or for killing that you were punished and imprisoned? *\"Do not\"* here signifies *\"was it not thus?\"* Honor and disgrace are names; wealth and property are profit. Affliction and harm arise from these. Those above prize names, and thus these afflictions and harms follow; rulers covet amassing wealth, and thus these contentions arise—such matters all begin from above.\n\nLaozi said, *\"Do not exalt the worthy, and the people will not contend; do not prize goods hard to obtain, and the people will not steal.\"* This is the same idea: using fame and profit to enslave people, driving them to self-exhaustion without end—how could it not reach such a state? His meaning was that in the great antiquity, there were no names, no profits, and so customs were pure and honest, states had no punishments, and people no crimes.\n\nThe rulers of old took success as belonging to the people and failure as their own; they took uprightness as belonging to the people and crookedness as their own. Thus, if even one person’s form suffered harm, the ruler would withdraw and take the blame himself. Now, however, it is not so.\n\n*\"Now, however, it is not so\"* refers to later ages. They conceal matters to deceive the people, calling those who do not know *\"foolish\"*; they impose great and difficult tasks, blaming those who dare not undertake them as *\"guilty\"*; they assign heavy burdens without measuring people’s strength, punishing those who cannot bear them; they send people on distant journeys, executing those who do not arrive. The people, knowing their strength is exhausted, resort to deception to continue. Day by day, deceit multiplies—how could the people not deceive? When strength is insufficient, they feign ability; when knowledge is insufficient, they cheat; when wealth is insufficient, they steal. To whom can the blame for theft and deception be laid?\n\nThe two lines *\"success and failure, uprightness and crookedness\"* mean that if the common people have faults, it lies with *\"me alone.\"* If even one person’s form does not obtain its life, the ruler withdraws and takes the blame himself, as if he had cast a commoner into a ditch without bestowing grace upon them. *\"Now, however, it is not so\"* refers to later generations.",

      "translated_text": "The ruler sends people on distant journeys without calculating their travel capacity, forcing them to do what they cannot and punishing those who fail, executing those who do not arrive. Those in high position issue decrees day by day, each more deceptive than the last—how could the people not resort to deception? When forced to do what their strength cannot bear, they must respond with pretense; when compelled to do what their knowledge cannot reach, they must respond with fraud. Excessive exactions without restraint drive them to theft to meet demands—it is I who make them deceive, cheat, and steal. Whom else can blame be laid upon?\n\nThese three phrases form a single idea, leading to the following line on theft, where the meaning becomes clear—this is also a matter of literary structure. When Qu Boyu reached sixty, he transformed sixty times, never failing to begin with what he took as right and end by rejecting it as wrong. How could he know that what he now called right was not the wrong of his fifty-ninth year? At sixty, his insights each year surpassed the last, yet how could he be certain that the rightness of his sixtieth year was truly right? This is but one example.\n\nAll things have life, yet none see their roots; all things emerge, yet none see their gates. People all honor the knowledge of what they know, but none know to rely on the knowledge of what they do not know—can this not be called a great delusion? Enough, enough! There is no escape from this—is this what is meant by \"so it is, so it is\"?\n\nThat things have life must have roots; that they emerge must have gates—only people do not see them. This is what lies beyond knowing. For people to know what they know yet not know what they do not know is the height of subtlety—such are the truly deluded. \"There is no escape\" means that it is naturally so, an unknowing knowledge that pervades past and present, above and below. Where is there a place not governed by this principle? How could one escape it? \"So it is, so it is?\" is a concluding phrase, asking whether what is called \"so\" is truly so. When Zigong replied, \"So it is, is it not?\" he meant precisely this. (See the *Wei Ling Gong* chapter; *ran yu* is pronounced *yu*.)\n\nConfucius asked the Grand Historian Da Tao, Bo Chang Qian, and Xi Wei: \"Wei Ling Gong indulged in wine and pleasure, neglecting state affairs; he hunted and fowled without responding to the affairs of other lords. How then did he come to be called 'Ling Gong'?\" Da Tao said, \"It was because of this.\" Bo Chang Qian said, \"Ling Gong had three wives, with whom he bathed in debauchery. When Historian Fang presented himself in audience, Ling Gong had attendants support him with gifts in hand—his dissipation was extreme, yet his reverence toward worthy men was like this. This is why he was called 'Ling Gong.'\" Xi Wei said, \"When Ling Gong died, divination for burial in the ancestral tomb was inauspicious, but burial at Sha Qiu was auspicious. When they dug several fathoms deep, they found a stone outer coffin. Washing it, they saw an inscription: 'Do not rely on his descendants; Ling Gong will seize and bury it.' Ling Gong’s being called 'Ling' had long been so—how could these two understand it?\"\n\n\"Fowling\" refers to hunting birds and beasts. Ling Gong did not respond to the rituals of interstate relations—how could a man like this be posthumously titled \"Ling\"? It means the title was not sufficient to match his faults. Da Tao said, \"This was also because the people of the state universally agreed to title him thus.\" (Here, *shi* \"this\" means the same as *ci* \"this.\") \"Presenting what was presented\" refers to the place where he resided. \"Attendants\" is like what is now called \"summoning for audience.\" \"Grasping gifts\" means holding the ceremonial silk presented upon an audience, and Ling Gong had people support him—this was a sign of propriety. \"Reverence\" means solemn respect. Sha Qiu was an ancient burial site. Since Ling Gong’s name was already fixed before his birth, how could human effort have determined it? This is a metaphor for all worldly affairs arising from spontaneity. \"These two\" refers to Da Tao and Bo Chang Qian. \"Do not rely on his descendants\" means his descendants could not be entrusted with it, so Ling Gong seized and buried it. (*Feng* means \"to rely on.\")\n\nLittle Knowledge asked Grand Duke Diao: \"What is meant by 'the words of the village'?\" Grand Duke Diao said: \"A village combines ten surnames and a hundred names to form its customs. It unites differences to make sameness and disperses sameness to make differences. Now, if you point to the hundred parts of a horse but do not get the horse, yet when a horse stands before you, you assemble its hundred parts and call it a horse—this is the principle. Thus, hills accumulate the low to become high; rivers combine waters to become great. The great man unites and combines to become public-spirited. Therefore, what enters from without has a master but is not grasped; what issues from within has a norm but is not resisted. The four seasons have distinct qi, yet Heaven does not bestow them, so the year is completed. The five offices have distinct duties, yet the ruler does not favor them, so the state is well-governed. The virtues of Wen and Wu were not bestowed, so their power was complete. The myriad things have distinct principles, yet the Dao does not favor them, so it is nameless. Nameless, it does nothing; doing nothing, yet nothing is left undone. Times have endings and beginnings; the world has changes and transformations. Fortune and misfortune flow ceaselessly. Where there is obstruction, there is also what is fitting; where there is self-sacrifice for distinct faces, there is also what is correct and what is deviant. Compared to the great marsh, all materials find their measure. Observing the great mountain, trees and stones share the same foundation—this is what is meant by 'the words of the village.'\"\n\n\"Gathering wells makes a mound; gathering mounds makes a village\"—hence the term \"village.\" Within one village, there are ten surnames and a hundred names. Though people differ, their customs are the same—this illustrates uniting differences to make sameness. \"The words of the village\" are the common words of a village. Uniting differences to make sameness means the myriad things share one principle. Dispersing sameness to make differences means each thing possesses its own principle. Assembling the hundred parts to make a horse—yet the name \"horse\" does not reside in any single part—this is dispersing sameness to make differences. Only when the hundred parts are assembled is it called a horse—this is uniting differences to make sameness. Accumulating to make a mountain and combining to make water follow the same principle. Uniting and combining to become public-spirited means uniting the differences of the myriad things to make sameness. \"Having a master but not grasping\" means what is mastered resides within, yet nothing is grasped—grasping would not be spontaneous. \"Norm\" refers to the principle of the myriad things. What issues from the heart shares the same principle as the myriad things, naturally harmonizing without resistance. Not grasping, not resisting—this is following spontaneity without the intent of sameness or difference. Heaven does not bestow—it does not claim merit. The five offices are arranged in ranks of five, each performing its duty—how could the ruler favor one over another? The great man embodies the virtues of Wen and Wu—when the time is right for Wen, he acts as Wen; when the time is right for Wu, he acts as Wu—this is not a matter of bestowal. Thus, his virtue is complete. The myriad things each have their own principle—hence \"distinct principles.\" The Great Dao unites them to become public-spirited—hence \"does not favor.\" \"Nameless\" means it cannot be named.",

      "translated_text": "The flowing and unceasing movement is natural. The arrival of fortune and misfortune, blessing and calamity, depends on hidden interdependence without constancy—sometimes what seems contrary may in fact be fitting, like the old man who lost his horse, then regained it. \"Contrary\" means thwarted, not as one wishes; \"fitting\" means as one wishes. If people cling to their own minds, it is like their faces—all different. To have something one corrects is to fixate and become rigid. To be rigid is to err, as people today say, \"to force an analogy is to miss the mark.\" Thus, it is said: to have something one corrects is to have something one errs in—this is a comparison. For example, in a great marsh, the materials of a hundred things each fit their measure, whether small or great, all can be used.\n\n\"Same altar\" means the same ground. Wood and stone originally reside on one mountain—initially, what distinction is there? This is uniting the different to become the same. Lesser Knowledge said: \"Then is this sufficient to be called the Dao?\" Grand Duke Mou replied: \"No. Now, the number of things is not limited to the myriad things, yet we call them 'the myriad things'—this is naming them by their great number. Thus, heaven and earth are the greatest of forms, yin and yang are the greatest of qi, and the Dao is their shared principle. To name them by their greatness is acceptable. But if one already has this, how can it be compared? To use such analogies is like comparing dogs and horses—they fall far short.\n\nThings are not limited to the myriad, yet we speak of 'the myriad things'—this is their total number, an approximation, a shorthand. Heaven and earth, yin and yang, are likewise general names for forms and qi. Forms and qi are not limited to heaven and earth or yin and yang, but we speak of them by their greatness. The Dao as the shared principle is also spoken of by borrowing from their greatness. Though the name 'Dao' already exists, how can it be compared and spoken of in this way? Thus, it is said: if one already has this, how can it be compared? Dogs and horses cannot be made the same—this is the case here. To compare them and engage in such debate is like the difference between dogs and horses—they cannot be united, nor are they comparable, and the distance is great indeed.\"\n\nLesser Knowledge said: \"Within the four directions and the six conjunctions, where do the myriad things arise?\" Grand Duke Mou replied: \"Yin and yang illuminate and respond to each other, cover and combine, regulate and transform. The four seasons alternate, give birth and kill, desire and aversion, departure and approach arise from this. Male and female unite in pairs, and thus there are constantly shifts between safety and danger, fortune and misfortune, urgency and ease, gathering and scattering—forming the names and realities that can be recorded, the subtleties that can be noted. Following the sequence, they regulate each other; arising and operating, they employ each other. When exhausted, they return; when ended, they begin anew—these are the inherent patterns of things, the utmost of speech and knowledge, the limit of what can be known. Only the things themselves. Those who perceive the Dao do not follow what decays nor trace what arises—this is where their discourse ends.\n\nWhere do the myriad things begin? Thus, it is said: where do they arise? They illuminate and respond to each other, cover and combine, regulate and transform—grow and diminish. The four seasons alternate: spring gives birth, autumn kills, each following its time. From this, desire and aversion, departure and approach, male and female, union and separation, safety and danger, fortune and misfortune, urgency and ease, gathering and scattering arise—these are the affairs of the human world following the existence of heaven and earth, yin and yang. All these are differences within sameness, arising like a bridge arching high. 'Pieces' means division; 'pairing' means union. 'Constantly' means always. 'Forming' means completing each other—here, only the character is changed for literary effect. From desire and aversion to gathering and scattering, their names and realities can be recorded, their subtleties can be noted—each can be seen, not only spoken of but also written down. Following the sequence of time, they regulate each other. Arising and operating, they employ each other in growth and diminution. When exhausted, they return to openness; when ended, they begin anew—these are the necessary patterns of the myriad things. Speech that reaches its limit arrives at this; knowledge that attains its utmost arrives at this. To exhaust heart and strength is only to grasp the character of 'things.' Thus, it is said: the limit is only the things themselves. Only those who know the Dao do not follow what decays nor trace what arises—they attribute all to the absence of origin, to spontaneity. Thus, their discourse ends here.\"\n\nLesser Knowledge said: \"Ji Zhen’s 'non-action' and Jie Zi’s 'contingent causation'—whose discourse aligns with reality, whose principle is partial?\" Grand Duke Mou replied: \"The crowing of roosters and the barking of dogs are known to all. Even the most knowledgeable cannot describe in words how they transform themselves; people cannot anticipate in thought what they will do. Yet to analyze this precisely is to reach the boundless, to encompass the immeasurable. 'Contingent causation' and 'non-action' are still bound by things and ultimately considered flawed.\n\nJi Zhen and Jie Zi were two contemporaries, each with their own theory. One spoke of 'non-action,' meaning that within all occurrences, there is initially no controller—all is accidental. The other spoke of 'contingent causation,' meaning there is a controller, and nothing is not caused—what moves is caused to move, what stops is caused to stop. 'Aligns with reality' means it accords with the facts. 'Partial in principle' means it is a biased view.\"",

Thus, his virtue is complete. The myriad things each have their own principle—hence \"distinct principles.\" The Great Dao unites them to become public-spirited—hence \"does not favor.\" \"Nameless\" means it cannot be named.",

      "translated_text": "Should one affirm or reject either of these two theories? The analogy of the crowing rooster and barking dog illustrates their divergence. What people know differs, so even the wisest cannot fully articulate or grasp the subtleties of self-transformation. How can one recite another’s words to comprehend the marvel of their insight? How can one fathom the intentions behind another’s actions? This is the principle at hand.\n\nTo analyze it precisely is to speak of the great and the small, for its depths cannot be exhausted. \"Without measure\" refers to the extreme of the minute; \"unfathomable\" to the extreme of the vast. Both theories remain entangled with things and ultimately harbor flaws—each suffers from inherent limitations.\n\nThe theory of \"contingent causation\" is substantive; that of \"non-action\" is empty. What has form and reality is bound to things; what is nameless and formless resides in their absence. Yet both can be expressed in words and conceived in thought, and thus both remain distant from the Dao.\n\nThe unborn cannot be prevented; the dead cannot be obstructed. Life and death are not distant—their principle is not visible. \"Prevention\" means prohibition. Before birth, one cannot avoid coming into being; once born, death cannot be defied or resisted. The principle of life and death lies before us, not far away, yet it cannot be seen—hence it is said to be \"not visible.\"\n\nThe theories of \"contingent causation\" and \"non-action\" are but provisional explanations. Observing their origins, I see their past is boundless; seeking their ends, their future is endless. Boundless and endless, they are as insubstantial as words, sharing the same principle as things. If one insists on \"contingent causation\" or \"non-action,\" worldly doubts arise from these very assumptions—how can one claim to be free from entanglement?\n\nThe \"root\" is the state before movement; the \"end\" is the state after cessation. Observing the root, one sees its past is boundless; observing the end, one sees its future is endless. Only by dissolving all words can one align with the myriad things and unify their principle—hence it is said that words are insubstantial, sharing the same principle as things.\n\n\"Contingent causation\" and \"non-action\" are but verbal expedients for things, their beginning and end. The Dao cannot be affirmed as existent, nor can it be denied as nonexistent. The term \"Dao\" is but a provisional name for its operation. Both theories, in their partiality, remain mired in things, seeing only their beginning and end. If one clings to things, how can one speak of the Dao as existent? Thus, the Dao cannot be said to exist. Yet if it exists, how can it be said to be nonexistent? Existence cannot be negated—hence it is said that existence cannot be denied. Viewed in truth, the word \"Dao\" is but a provisional name for its operation in the world.\n\nBoth theories are entangled with things, confined to a single corner—how can they be called the Great Dao? A corner is but a fragment; the Great Dao is all-encompassing. Having concluded the above, the text shifts to another subtle point:\n\nIf words suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts the Dao; if words do not suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts only things. The ultimate of the Dao and things cannot be conveyed by speech or silence alone—neither words nor silence can fully express it. This aligns with the previous statement.\n\nYet if I truly perceive, then even speech can exhaust the Dao—speaking all day does no harm. Thus, it is said: \"If words suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts the Dao.\" If I perceive nothing, then words cannot exhaust the Dao—no matter how much one speaks, it remains mere semblance. Thus, it is said: \"If words do not suffice, then speaking all day long exhausts only things.\" The Dao is subtle; things are coarse. Seeking their extremes, neither words nor silence suffice to contain them—hence it is said they are \"not in this.\" Between words and silence lies the ultimate discourse.\n\nThe Buddhist analogy of pressing a finger to reveal the ocean’s reflection or a lamp’s light—where your mind stirs and dust arises—expresses this same idea. The Buddha also said, \"I am the Dharma King, autonomous in the Dharma.\" This means that one who embodies the Dao is free, while one who has not yet embodied it remains bound. How does this differ from the Inner Chapters?\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: External Things (Chapter 26)**\n\nExternal things cannot be relied upon. Thus, Longfeng was executed, Bigan was killed, Jizi feigned madness, and E Lai died—Jie and Zhou perished. No ruler fails to desire loyal ministers, yet loyalty does not guarantee trust. Thus, Wu Yun was exiled to the Yangtze, and Chang Hong died in Shu, his blood stored for three years before transforming into jade. No parent fails to desire filial children, yet filial piety does not guarantee love. Thus, Xiaoji grieved, and Zeng Shen mourned.\n\nExternal things are matters beyond oneself, not sought within. In the time of Jie and Zhou, both worthy and unworthy suffered the same calamities—this cannot be relied upon. The examples here pertain to Zhou, but Jie is included by analogy.\n\nChang Hong was exiled and returned to Shu, where he disemboweled himself and died. The people of Shu placed his blood in a casket, and after three years, it turned into jade. This account differs slightly from the *Zuozhuan*, which seems fantastical. During the Jin Emperor Yuan’s reign, when grain transports failed to arrive, he executed his minister, and the blood spurted upward against a pillar. The Qi killed Hulü Guang with the sword *Mingyue*, and his blood soaked the ground, refusing to fade—such things occur in the world.\n\nXiaoji was the son of King Gaozong of Yin, exiled by his stepmother. Zengzi’s sorrow is said to stem from his father wielding a large staff, prompting him to flee. Readers of this text should grasp its intent rather than cling to specifics. Loyalty and filial piety are esteemed, yet they may harm one’s person—such are external things, which cannot be relied upon.",

      "translated_text": "When wood rubs against wood, it ignites; when metal and fire stay together, the metal melts. When yin and yang clash in their movements, heaven and earth are thrown into great turmoil—thus arise thunder and lightning. Fire appears in water, burning great locust trees. When wood rubs against wood, fire emerges of itself—today’s boatmen use elm and willow in the same way. Fire and metal kept together cause smelting. Wood, though inherently without fire, generates it through friction; metal, though supremely hard, flows when exposed to fire—this too expresses the idea that things cannot be taken for granted. Great turmoil brings great anomalies. During violent thunderstorms, trees may be set ablaze, hence the saying, “fire appears in water, burning the great locust.” It does not speak of other trees but specifically of the locust because the locust can generate fire; thus, the locust is mentioned. The *Huainanzi* states, “Old locust trees produce fire,” as seen in the *Fan Lun* chapter—this does not refer solely to the burning of great locust trees. All these are instances of yin and yang clashing in their movements, resulting in calamities that are rarely seen—again illustrating that things cannot be taken for granted.\n\nThere is profound sorrow when one is trapped in a double peril with no escape, restless and unsettled, unable to find peace of mind. The heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth, stifled and mired in distress. As advantages and harms clash, they generate abundant fire, and the multitude burns away harmony. The moon, by nature, cannot withstand fire—thus, one becomes utterly undone, and the Way is exhausted.\n\nProfound sorrow is extreme sorrow. The double peril refers either to the afflictions of human society or to the calamities of yin and yang. The *Human World* chapter of the *Zhuangzi* speaks of these two perils—this is the same idea. Restlessness and unease describe the state of alarm and insecurity. “Unable to find peace” means that profound sorrow, with no escape, disrupts one’s emotional equilibrium. “The heart hangs suspended between heaven and earth” describes a heart bound and tormented by its own suffering. Stifled and mired refer to oppression and entanglement in danger. As advantages and harms wage war within the breast, the inner self is scorched—more intensely than by searing fire, hence “generating abundant fire.” These are all common people, those who do not understand the Way. Unaware that external things cannot be taken for granted, they overtax their minds and thus reach this state, burning away the harmonious qi within their breasts. Hence, “the multitude burns away harmony.” The moon’s nature refers to the innate harmony people receive from heaven, which is complete and resembles the moon. Yet when obscured by worldly desires, its brilliance is eclipsed by the flames of craving, and what should be the moon cannot withstand them, leading to the burning of harmony. As the poet of the mountains and valleys said, “The original mind is like the sun and moon; desires eclipse it”—this is the same idea. Utterly undone describes a state of collapse and abandonment. “The Way is exhausted” means that heavenly principle is extinguished. This refers to the multitude, who, drowned in desire, remain deluded their entire lives, only ceasing when heavenly principle is utterly destroyed.\n\nZhuangzi was poor, so he went to borrow grain from the Marquis of the River. The marquis said, “Very well. When I receive the tax revenue from my fief, I will lend you three hundred pieces of gold—will that do?” Zhuang Zhou flushed with anger and said, “On my way here yesterday, I heard someone calling from the middle of the road. I looked and saw a minnow in the rut of a cart wheel. I asked it, ‘Minnow, what are you doing here?’ It replied, ‘I am a wave-official from the Eastern Sea. Do you have a pint or a quart of water to keep me alive?’ I said, ‘Very well. I am about to travel south to persuade the kings of Wu and Yue to channel the waters of the Western River to welcome you—will that do?’ The minnow flushed with anger and said, ‘I have lost my usual element and have nowhere to stay. I could be kept alive with a pint or a quart of water, but you say such things—you might as well go look for me in a dried-fish shop!’”\n\nThe Marquis of the River may refer to Marquis Wen of Wei, though this is not certain. Alternatively, it may be an official overseeing the river, addressed as “marquis.” If not, then “marquis” may be his surname. “Tax revenue” refers to the tribute from his fief. “Wave-official” is akin to saying “water official.” This passage must have been a jest circulating at the time, hence its inclusion here—it conveys the modern saying, “distant water cannot quench a nearby fire.” The “dried-fish shop” implies that by the time the water arrives, the minnow will already have become dried fish. “Usual element” refers to what one is accustomed to.\n\nMaster Ren made a great hook with a massive black rope and used fifty oxen as bait. Crouching on Mount Kuaiji, he cast his line into the Eastern Sea, fishing day after day for a year without catching anything. Then a great fish took the bait, dragging the massive hook down into the depths. It surged and thrashed, its fins erect, white waves rising like mountains, the sea churning with a sound like thunder, striking terror for a thousand miles. Master Ren caught the fish, sliced it, and dried it. From the Zhi River eastward to north of Cangwu, there was no one who did not eat their fill of it. Later, those of mediocre talent and pedantic scholars all marveled and spread the tale.\n\nTo raise a pole and chase after minnows in ditches, guarding them—how difficult it is to catch a great fish! To adorn petty words to seek high office—how far this is from great understanding! Thus, those who have never heard of Master Ren’s customs are far from being able to navigate the world. The massive black rope refers to a thick, dark cord. The character for “ox” is pronounced *jie*.",

      "translated_text": "The term *fang* is synonymous with *xian*, meaning \"to sink.\" The sea water churned violently, its sound akin to thunder—this describes how the fish’s thrashing stirred the sea, its roar striking terror. *Dan he* means \"fear and dread,\" for people a thousand *li* away heard its sound and trembled. *Yan yan* means \"to eat one’s fill.\" *Quan cai* refers to those of shallow judgment and limited vision. *Feng yu* describes those who parrot hearsay, knowing only the commonplace and not the extraordinary, seeing only the small and not the great—hence their astonishment and mutual warnings. *Lei* means \"to coil,\" and *guan* means \"to pour.\" *Guan du* refers to small streams, while *ni fu* are tiny fish. *Xian ling* is akin to modern proclamations. *Xian* is synonymous with *xuan* (\"to hang\"), and *xian jie* denotes official decrees, much like today’s reward notices. This speaks of petty men who adorn their words to curry favor with superiors, seeking to align with the decrees they display. Even if they succeed, how much can they truly gain? Thus it is said: \"How far they are from great understanding!\"\n\n*Su* refers to worldly scholars. Such scholars cannot be spoken to about the Dao of governing the world, hence it is said: \"Those who cling to worldly ways are far indeed from being able to navigate the world.\" *Yuan yi* means \"exceedingly so.\"\n\nThe Confucians who rob graves with *Odes* and *Rites*:\nA great Confucian announced: \"The east is stirring—what is to be done?\"\nA lesser Confucian replied: \"He has not yet removed his undergarments, but there is a pearl in his mouth.\"\nThe *Odes* indeed say:\n*\"The green, green wheat grows on the hillside mound.\nIf one does not give in life, why hold a pearl in death?\"*\nThe great Confucian then seized the corpse’s hair, pressed down its chin, and with a metal mallet pried open its jaw. Carefully parting its cheeks, he ensured the pearl in its mouth remained unharmed.\n\nThis passage likely satirizes scholars who misuse the words of the sages and worthies in the *Odes* and *Books* to cloak their villainy. *Lu* means \"to announce from above to below,\" while *ju* means \"to report from below to above.\" *Lu chuan* refers to a great Confucian leading and instructing his disciples. *\"The green, green wheat grows on the hillside mound\"* is a verse about grave fields. *\"If one does not give in life, why hold a pearl in death?\"* mocks the miserly rich. This poem consists of only four lines—whether it is an ancient verse or composed by Zhuangzi himself is uncertain. The lines from *\"seizing its hair\"* onward are the great Confucian’s instructions to the lesser one: *jie* means \"to grasp,\" *ye* means \"to press with the hand,\" and *hui* refers to the chin. *Kong qi hui* means \"to force open the jaw.\" *Bie* also means \"to open,\" implying that by reciting this poem, he teaches his disciple to carefully extract the pearl without damage. The *Odes* say: *\"Why hold a pearl in death?\"*—thus, taking it now aligns with the poem’s intent.\n\nWhen Lao Lai’s disciple went out to gather firewood and encountered Confucius, he returned and reported: \"There is someone over there—tall above, stooped below, his back hunched, his ears turned as if surveying the four seas. I do not know whose disciple he is.\"\nLao Lai said: \"That is Qiu. Summon him here.\"\nWhen Confucius arrived, Lao Lai said: \"Qiu, shed your bodily pride and your cultivated demeanor—then you may be called a gentleman.\"\nConfucius bowed and withdrew, his expression altered. He asked: \"May I advance in my studies?\"\nLao Lai replied: \"One who cannot bear the harm of a single generation yet hastens to inflict suffering for ten thousand generations—is this not obstinate and narrow-minded? Or does he simply lack the capacity? To take joy in kindness as if it were arrogance is a lifelong disgrace. The conduct of the common people advances thus: they draw one another by reputation, bind themselves with profit, and in praising Yao while condemning Jie, they would do better to forget both and close their mouths to praise. For all their actions are crooked, and nothing they do is free from error. The sage hesitates to initiate affairs, yet often succeeds—how is this so? His bearing remains ever modest.

      "translated_text": "Hui Shi said to Zhuangzi, \"Your words are useless.\"\nZhuangzi replied, \"Only when one understands the useless can one begin to speak of the useful. The earth is neither narrow nor small, yet what man uses of it is but the space to stand. If one were to dig away all the earth beyond where the feet rest until reaching the Yellow Springs, would man still have use for it?\"\nHui Shi said, \"It would be useless.\"\nZhuangzi said, \"Then the usefulness of the useless is thus made clear.\"\n*(Digging away is called \"dian.\" Beyond the space for the feet lies the abyss, where one cannot tread. This is the meaning of \"the use of the useless\" from the \"Xu Wu Gui\" chapter.)*\n\nZhuangzi said, \"Is there a man who can wander yet does not wander? Is there a man who cannot wander yet does wander? Those with the will to flee and the resolve to sever ties—alas, are they not far from the burden of supreme wisdom and profound virtue? They fall and do not return, rush like fire and do not look back. Though they may for a time be lord and subject, when their lives end, what difference remains between noble and base? Thus it is said: the perfected person does not linger in their steps. Those who exalt the past and belittle the present are the way of scholars. Yet if one views the present age through the lens of the times of the Shiwei clan, who could avoid being swept away? Only the perfected person can wander through the world without bias, follow others without losing themselves. Those who can wander, wander; those who cannot, remain unable. This speaks of those in the world who are enlightened and those who are not. *You* means to delight in oneself. *Liudun* is to chase things and forget to return. *Juejue* is to stand apart from the world, utterly different. *Ren* means to act. Those of supreme wisdom and profound virtue, who follow nature, do not err in fleeing or severing ties. *Fuzhui* means to sink into worldly entanglements. *Huochi* means to be driven by the world like fire. These are all those burdened by the vulgar who cannot turn back to reflect on themselves—thus they do not return, do not look back, meaning they cannot reverse the light to illuminate their own nature. Though for a time there are distinctions of noble and base, called lord and subject, after death, what remains of noble or base? Kings and lords perish like ants, leaving only mounds of earth. Only the perfected person’s actions leave no lingering attachment to the world—thus it is said: the perfected person does not linger in their steps. The passions of people in past and present are largely the same; where is the difference between simplicity and decadence? Scholars exalt the past and belittle the present because they do not understand the changes of the world. The Shiwei clan lived before the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. If one views the present through the beginning of heaven and earth or the age of high antiquity, all are those who have been swept away and lost their nature. Thus it is said: who could avoid being swept away? Scholars take the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors as the beginning of past and present—this is to mock and disparage the ancient emperors and kings. *Pian* means bias. To wander through the world without leaning toward any bias, not taking past or present as right or wrong, though one may merge with the dust and shine with the same light, not clashing with the world, what one preserves remains intact—thus it is said: to follow others without losing oneself. What they teach, they take as right; I do not study it, yet I comply with their intent without distinction between self and other—this is the meaning of *equalizing things* and *following what is so*. Thus it is said: to comply with their intent without opposing them.\n\nThe eye that is *che* is clear; the ear that is *che* is keen; the nose that is *che* is sharp; the mouth that is *che* is sweet; the mind that is *che* is wise; wisdom that is *che* is virtue. Wherever the Dao is, obstruction is undesirable. Obstruction leads to choking; choking without cessation leads to trampling. Where trampling occurs, myriad harms arise. Those with knowledge rely on their breath, yet if it is not abundant, is this heaven’s fault? Heaven bores through the apertures day and night without ceasing. It is man who, looking back, blocks his own holes. *Che* means to penetrate. Grasping the principle of nature and achieving great penetration, the ear and eye perceive true keenness and clarity; the nose and mouth discern true sharpness and sweetness; what the mind knows is true wisdom; virtue is the highest virtue. *Yong* means blockage and obstruction. *Geng* means choking and not flowing. *Tian* refers to the traces of footsteps. If my understanding of the Dao is blocked and choked, unable to awaken, then I am burdened by form and traces. Not ceasing means delusion without knowing to stop. Burdened by form and traces, myriad harms arise. *Xi* means life. That which is called life is nature. All people possess it. Only after having this nature of receiving life does one have knowledge and awareness. What is called knowledge and awareness relies on this breath. No one lacks it, yet some act contrary to principle—is this because heaven begrudges them its abundance? The principle in the human mind is revealed day and night through its apertures—when has it ever ceased? Thus it is said: heaven bores through them day and night without ceasing. *Che* means the apertures of the mind. *Wu jiang* means without cessation. *Dou* also means the apertures of the mind. Man, deluded by material desires, obscures himself—this is to block his own apertures. *Gu* means \"then.\"",

      "translated_text": "The womb has layered membranes, the heart roams freely in heaven. If the chamber is not empty, mother and daughter-in-law quarrel; if the heart does not wander in heaven, the six apertures contend. The great forests and mountains are good for people—yet the spirit is overcome, virtue overflows into fame, fame overflows into violence. Schemes are delayed by subtlety, knowledge arises from contention, firewood is born from guarding office, and affairs are settled by the crowd.\n\nIn the timely rains of spring, plants and trees flourish. Hoes and plows begin to be used. Yet more than half of the planted grasses and trees perish, and none know why.\n\n*Bao* refers to the membranes. Within the human body’s flesh lies a layered membrane enveloping the self. *Chong lang* means spaciousness. Within the body, such vastness exists, yet if the heart, as sovereign, delights in heavenly principle, this is called \"roaming in heaven.\" *Bo xi* means strife. In a cramped dwelling, mother and daughter-in-law constantly bicker. The six apertures—the six roots: eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind—if the chamber is not empty, then superiors and inferiors clash; if the heart is not empty, the six apertures seize one another. If the heart could be empty, how could external things disturb it?\n\nGoodness is love. When the heart is not empty, the six dusts disturb it. Thus, those who love mountains and forests do so because the spirit cannot endure the toil of ceaseless labor. When they suddenly behold a vast, open landscape, the heart must rejoice—yet this joy is followed by sorrow.\n\nThe great transformation subtly shifts, and one is merely turned by things. Stillness can mend illness, rest can rejuvenate age, and tranquility can halt haste. Yet these are the tasks of the toiling, not the idle who have never inquired.\n\n*Jing ran* means serenity. To mend illness is to discard the old and return to the new, abandoning the branches to return to the root. If this heart can be serene, then past losses can be repaired and preserved. *Zi* (眦) is pronounced *jian*; *mie* () is pronounced *mie*. *Zi mie* means to cast aside material desires and preserve heavenly principle, allowing one to wander freely into old age. *Ju* means urgency. To calm the heart is to halt haste.\n\nWhat startles the world is what the sage employs; the divine person has never inquired. What startles the age is what the worthy employs; the sage has never inquired. What startles the state is what the noble person employs; the worthy has never inquired. What aligns with the times is what the petty person employs; the noble person has never inquired.\n\nIn Yanmen, there was one whose parent died, and for his exemplary mourning, he was enfeoffed as an official. Among his peers, some mourned to death. *Xia* is synonymous with *hai* (startle). The sage governs the world with benevolence and righteousness—this startles it. The divine person has no such concerns. The worthy astonishes the age with abundant virtue; the sage has no such concerns. The noble person startles the state with reputation; the worthy has no such concerns. The petty person busies himself to conform to the times; the noble person has no such concerns.\n\nYanmen is a place name. *Shan hui* means filial mourning. For his filiality, he gained rank and became an official. His peers, admiring him, even mourned to death—this speaks of the burden of fame. *Guan shi* is akin to what is now called an official.\n\nYao offered the world to Xu You, who fled from it. Tang offered it to Wu Guang, who grew angry. When Ji Tuo heard of this, he led his disciples to crouch by the Kuang River. The feudal lords mourned him for three years. Then Shentu Di, admiring their reclusion, threw himself into the river. *Cun* is synonymous with *dun* (crouching), implying disdain. Ji Tuo’s intent was for the feudal lords to yield their states to him, yet they merely pitied his suffering—how laughable! After three years, Shentu Di, admiring the fame of reclusion, drowned himself in the river. This illustrates the extreme burden of fame.\n\nThe fish trap exists for the fish; once the fish is caught, the trap is forgotten. The rabbit snare exists for the rabbit; once the rabbit is caught, the snare is forgotten. Words exist for meaning; once the meaning is grasped, the words are forgotten. Where can I find a person who has forgotten words, that I might speak with them?\n\nThe above has thoroughly expounded the matter, concluding with the analogy of the trap and snare—echoing the earlier passage’s structure: \"Words suffice, yet words are insufficient; embodiment suffices.\" The fish trap and rabbit snare are tools for catching fish and rabbits. Once obtained, they are useless. Words convey meaning; once the meaning is grasped, words are forgotten. Those who cannot forget words become mired and lose the meaning. Only one who has forgotten words can truly converse.\n\nThis passage’s subtlety lies in the intent: the rabbit’s aim is to catch the rabbit.",

The principle in the human mind is revealed day and night through its apertures—when has it ever ceased? Thus it is said: heaven bores through them day and night without ceasing. *Che* means the apertures of the mind. *Wu jiang* means without cessation. *Dou* also means the apertures of the mind. Man, deluded by material desires, obscures himself—this is to block his own apertures. *Gu* means \"then.\"",

Examples include the dialogues of Nie Que, Wang Ni, and Gengsang Chu.\n\n**Chong yan** (weighty words) borrow the names of ancient sages to lend authority, such as the Yellow Emperor, Shen Nong, and Confucius—seventeen out of ten instances in this text are of this kind.\n\n**Zhi yan** (goblet words) are like a goblet: anyone may drink from it, and the more one drinks, the more flavor it yields. \"Issuing forth daily\" means every matter contains such words. *He* (harmony) is the act of blending; *tian ni* (the Heavenly Equilibrium) is the principle of Heaven.\n\nIn parables, even a father would not act as his own son’s matchmaker—no father’s praise carries the weight of an outsider’s. If it is not my fault, it is the fault of others. When something aligns with oneself, one responds; when it does not, one resists.

      "translated_text": "To harmonize the hearts of all people with the Heavenly Principle is to borrow—borrowing means not issuing from oneself but from others, hence called \"borrowing from without.\" For instance, if a father praises his own son to seek a marriage alliance, others will not believe him; he must borrow another’s praise. This is the nature of parable.\n\nThis fault does not lie with me but with others’ lack of trust, hence the use of parables. If one assumes it issues from oneself, others will inevitably divide into agreement and disagreement, responding to what aligns with them as right and what differs as wrong. This is the self-serving view of others.\n\n\"Seventeen out of ten\" in *zhong yan* (weighty words) refers to one’s own speech being affirmed as that of elders—those whose years precede but who lack the warp and woof of beginning and end, merely reaching the age of *qiyi* (a hundred years). Such elders, though senior in years, have no precedence in learning; their age alone does not make them exemplary. A person who cannot surpass others fails to fulfill the Way of humanity—this is what is called a \"worn-out person.\" A \"worn-out person\" is one who lingers in the world, long-used and of no value.\n\nThe purpose here is to halt—one’s own words can end disputes. By borrowing the weight of elders, listeners dare not deem it wrong, thus silencing their objections. The ancient sage-kings and worthies were all elders, possessing the warp and woof of constancy and change, beginning and end. *Qiyi* refers to the age of a hundred. Though one’s years may precede, if one’s learning offers no insight, merely being called an elder by virtue of age is insufficient to claim precedence. A person who cannot surpass others cannot fully realize the human Dao—this is merely a \"worn-out person.\"\n\nThe *zhi yan* (goblet words) issue forth daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equilibrium, endlessly unfolding to exhaust the years. Without speech, all is equal; with speech, equality is lost. Speech that aligns with equality does not align; equality that aligns with speech does not align. Thus, \"without speech\" means speech without intent; \"speaking all one’s life\" means never truly speaking. \"Never speaking all one’s life\" means never not speaking, for even in silence, principle may be grasped.\n\nThere is always an origin—what people deem right or wrong, so or not so, all have their sources. Each affirms what it affirms; how can I alone determine what is right? I can only follow what is deemed right and affirm it, follow what is deemed wrong and negate it. Things inherently have their \"so-ness\"; things inherently have their \"admissible-ness.\" Thus, no thing is not so, no thing is inadmissible.\n\nThis is discussed in detail in the \"Equalizing Things\" chapter. The phrase *\"zhi yan* issue forth daily, harmonizing with the Heavenly Equilibrium—who attains its enduringness?\" means I do not use natural speech to harmonize all mouths. If I were to align with their judgments of right and wrong, how could I claim lasting validity? For the natural principle is unassailable across all ages.\n\nAll things share a common origin from the Creator, yet their forms differ and succeed one another between Heaven and Earth. People see grass as grass, trees as trees, birds as birds, beasts as beasts—only their forms differ, unaware that all emerge from the primordial *qi* and share the same origin. All things in Heaven and Earth cycle through beginning and end like a ring, their profound order beyond human comprehension. This is called the Heavenly Equality—equality in the Heavenly Principle.\n\nZhuangzi said to Huizi: \"Confucius lived sixty years, and at sixty, his views transformed. What he once affirmed, he later negated. Who knows if what he now calls right is not what he deemed wrong at fifty-nine?\" Huizi replied: \"Confucius diligently applied his will and served his knowledge.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Confucius has renounced that. He never spoke of it. Confucius said: 'One receives talent from the great root and revives the spirit to live. To cry in accord with the pitch, to speak in accord with the law, to present profit and righteousness before others—this merely pleases their mouths. It makes people submit in word but not dare to oppose, thus establishing the world’s standards. Alas! How can I compare to him?'\n\n*Fu zhi* means to serve; *zhi* means knowledge.\"",

      "translated_text": "To diligently apply the mind in pursuit of knowledge and perception is called \"extensive learning.\" *Xie* means to relinquish. This is to say, Confucius had already relinquished the pursuit of extensive learning and advanced toward the Dao, though he never spoke of it to others. When Zhuangzi cited Confucius, he was quoting Confucius’ own words.\n\n\"Receiving talent from the great root\" means receiving one’s nature from the Great Origin. The \"great root\" is the Creator. *Ling* is the nature of awareness. *Fu* means to return—to revert to the original nature of awareness, for only then can one fully realize the Way of human life. Thus, it is said, \"revives the spirit to live.\" *Ming* also means \"to speak.\" *Lü* is the law. *Dang* means that all accords with principle.\n\nTo present profit and righteousness before others and thereby establish likes and dislikes, right and wrong, is merely to please their mouths. It makes people submit in word but not in heart. One must relinquish profit and righteousness and forget likes and dislikes, right and wrong, before others can submit in heart without daring to oppose. Only then can the world’s settled principles be established. *Wu* is pronounced *wu*; it means opposition, defiance. *Wu li* means to stand face-to-face, where I am compliant and the other defiant. The *Rites of Zhou* says, \"to receive the opposition of the feudal lords,\" meaning those who come toward me are defiant.\n\nAfter quoting the Master’s words, Zhuangzi sighed to Huizi: \"Alas! Alas! How can I compare to Confucius?\" From this alone, it is clear that Zhuangzi was not one who failed to revere our Sage.\n\nZengzi took office twice, and his heart transformed twice. He said: \"When I served my parents, three measures of grain brought joy to my heart. Later, when I served with a salary of three thousand *zhong*, it did not reach my heart with sorrow.\" A disciple asked Confucius: \"Can Zeng Shen be said to be free from entanglement in fault?\" Confucius replied: \"He is already entangled. How could one free from entanglement feel sorrow? To him, three measures or three thousand *zhong* were like watching sparrows or mosquitoes pass before him.\" *Bu ji* means not reaching one’s parents. \"Free from entanglement in fault\" means being without the fetters of attachment. The question was whether Zengzi’s words revealed such fetters, for his heart had changed twice—now sorrowful, now joyful. \"He is already entangled\" means that even this sorrow and joy are fetters. If one were truly free from entanglement, the weight of external things passing before one would be like birds or insects—how could one feel sorrow or joy? To feel sorrow or joy is to have a heart.\n\nYan Cheng Ziyou said to Dongguo Ziqí: \"Since I heard your words, in the first year I became rustic; in the second, compliant; in the third, penetrating; in the fourth, like a thing; in the fifth, things came to me; in the sixth, the spirit entered; in the seventh, I became one with Heaven; in the eighth, I knew neither death nor life; in the ninth, I attained the great mystery.\"\n\nIn the first year, he became rustic—returning to simplicity. In the second, compliant—without opposition to right or wrong, like or dislike. In the third, penetrating—thoroughly enlightened. In the fourth, like a thing—like withered wood or dead ashes. In the fifth, things came to him—within stillness, there was that which was not still, what Chan calls \"the great death and yet alive.\" *Jue ru* means to take the transformations of creation into one’s breast. \"One with Heaven\" means unity with Heaven. \"Knowing neither death nor life\" means being at ease in all circumstances. \"The great mystery\" means the utmost profundity. From the first to the ninth year, these are stages, but such matters cannot be measured by years.\n\n\"Life is as death. I urge you to embrace death—yet life has its source. Yang arises, but from what? Is it truly so? Where does it go? Where does it not go? Heaven has its celestial reckoning; Earth has its human records. Where should I seek it? I know not its end. How can it be said to be without fate? I know not its beginning. How can it be said to have fate? There is that which responds—how can it be without spirit? There is that which does not respond—how can it be with spirit?\"\n\nThese lines speak of the principle of neither life nor death. \"Life is as death\" means to take life as real—if there is life, there is death. To hold such a view is self-serving. If one urges another with the utmost impartiality, one would have them know that among the works of creation, nothing is immortal. Thus, it is said, \"I urge you to embrace death.\" Yet to call it death is to imply it has a source. If death has a source, then life, at its first stirring, has no source. If its beginning is without life, how can there be death? This is the beginning of Yang’s movement. Speaking of life and death in this way, how can one know if it is truly so or not? Where it goes is so; where it does not go is not so. Yet when one observes it in its entirety, where is it so? Where is it not so? To call it being is wrong; to call it non-being is also wrong. Thus, it is said, \"Is it truly so? Where does it go? Where does it not go?\"\n\n\"Heavenly reckoning\" refers to the movements of stars, sun, and moon as recorded in almanacs. \"Human records\" refer to the traces of human activity as documented in maps and records. If one seeks the principles of Heaven and Earth through celestial reckoning and human records, can they truly be exhausted? Thus, it is said, \"Where should I seek it?\" Between Heaven and Earth, days pass and months depart—who knows their end? Their movement must have a Creator. How can it be said to be without fate? Yet in the vastness of the beginning, originally there was nothing—how can it be said to have fate? The seasons arrive, and qi responds without the slightest deviation. How can it be said to be without spirit? Yet the humble are not always blessed, the benevolent not always long-lived. Between the seen and unseen, there is sometimes no correspondence. How can it be said to have spirit? These lines elucidate the unknowability of creation.\n\nThe Many *Wangliang* asked the Shadow: \"A moment ago, you were bowing; now, you raise your head. A moment ago, your hair was tied; now, it is loose. A moment ago, you were sitting; now, you stand. A moment ago, you were walking; now, you stop. Why is this?\" The Shadow replied: \"Trivial! Why ask such trifles? I have it, yet I know not why. I am like the cicada’s shell, the snake’s slough—seemingly so, yet not so. In fire and sunlight, I gather; in darkness and night, I am replaced. Do I depend on something? How much more so for those who depend on things! When it comes, I come with it; when it goes, I go with it. When it is strong and bright, I am strong and bright with it. Why ask about strong brightness?\"",

It makes people submit in word but not dare to oppose, thus establishing the world’s standards. Alas! How can I compare to him?'\n\n*Fu zhi* means to serve; *zhi* means knowledge.\"",

      "translated_text": "\"Trivial!\"—this conveys the sense of fleeting visibility and manifestation. \"Why ask such trifles?\"—it is a casual, offhand remark, an expression of careless spontaneity, as if to say: *Why do you suddenly ask this?* What I possess, I do not myself know why it is so; hence, \"I have it, yet I know not why.\" The cicada has transformed, yet its shell remains; the snake has transformed, yet its slough remains. This analogy compares the movement of form to the life of the cicada or snake, and the shadow to the shell or slough. \"Seemingly so, yet not so\"—this means that while the comparison is apt, it is not entirely accurate. Within sunlight and fire, this shadow exists; hence, \"I gather\" (gathering together). When darkness falls and no fire is lit, the shadow becomes invisible—this is \"replaced.\" \"That\" refers to form; \"I\" refers to the shadow. It says: *Do I depend on that?* Hence, \"Do I depend on something?\" Yet the movement of form itself depends on something else; thus, \"How much more so for those who depend on things!\" \"Strong brightness\" refers to movement. Form moves by relying on the qi of strong brightness; the coming and going of form depend on strong brightness. Form moves because of strong brightness, and I follow it. But the nature of strong brightness is not something form itself knows—why then do you ask me?\n\nThis passage parallels *The Equality of Things*, though it adds the details of strong brightness, fire, and sunlight, playing with the brush as Chan Buddhists do in their repetitive gāthās.\n\nWhen Yang Ziju journeyed south to Pei, and Lao Dan traveled west to Qin, they met at the outskirts of Liang. Midway, Laozi looked up to the sky and sighed, saying: \"At first, I thought you could be taught, but now I see you cannot.\" Yang Ziju made no reply. Upon reaching their lodging, he washed his hands and face, combed his hair, removed his shoes, and, bowing deeply outside, approached and said: \"Earlier, your disciple wished to ask you a question, but as you were walking without pause, I dared not speak. Now that you have paused, may I ask: What is my fault?\" Laozi said: \"Your haughty gaze, your overbearing demeanor—who would wish to dwell with you? The purest white seems sullied; the fullest virtue seems insufficient.\" Yang Ziju’s expression changed abruptly, and he said: \"I humbly receive your instruction.\" When he had first arrived, the innkeeper had welcomed him, the master of the house had laid out his mat, his wife had offered the towel and comb, the guests had vacated their seats, and the cook had left the stove—all out of respect. But upon his return, the innkeeper and guests vied with him for a place to sit.\n\n\"What is my fault?\"—this means: *You say I cannot be taught; where is my error?* \"Haughty gaze, overbearing demeanor\"—this describes a stiff, self-important bearing, as if one cannot relax in the company of others. \"Who would wish to dwell with you?\"—this means one has not forgotten the distinction between self and others, always acting as if in the presence of company. \"The purest white seems sullied\"—this conveys the idea of brilliance concealed. \"The fullest virtue seems insufficient\"—this means that though one possesses it, one does not flaunt it. \"Welcomed him\"—refers to seeing him off and receiving him. \"Master of the house\"—the host of the inn. \"Laid out his mat, offered the towel and comb\"—acts of deference. \"The cook\"—the one who tends the stove. \"Vacated their seats, left the stove\"—signs of respect. \"Vied for a place to sit\"—this means they no longer regarded him as someone to be revered. Before hearing Laozi’s words, he had carried himself with self-importance, so people treated him with respect. After his transformation, he concealed his brilliance, and people saw him as ordinary. The style of this passage is also refined.\n\n**Chapter 28: Yielding the Throne** (from the *Miscellaneous Chapters*)\n\nYao offered the empire to Xu You, who refused it. He then offered it to Zizhou Zhipu, who said: \"If you were to make me Son of Heaven, it would be acceptable. However, I happen to suffer from a hidden affliction and am presently treating it. I have no leisure to govern the empire. The empire is the heaviest of burdens, yet I would not let it harm my life—how much less would I let other things do so? Only one who does not treat the empire as a possession can be entrusted with it.\"\n\nShun offered the empire to Zizhou Zhibo, who said: \"I happen to suffer from a hidden affliction and am presently treating it. I have no leisure to govern the empire.\" Thus, the empire is a great vessel, yet one would not exchange one’s life for it—this is what distinguishes those who follow the Way from the common crowd.\n\n\"A hidden affliction\"—akin to what is now called a concealed illness. \"One who does not treat the empire as a possession\"—this means only one who does not desire to be Son of Heaven can be entrusted with the empire, for such a person holds the empire without clinging to it. \"Distinguishes from the common crowd\"—this means they differ from worldly people.\n\nShun offered the empire to Shan Juan, who said: \"I stand in the midst of the cosmos. In winter, I wear furs; in summer, I wear coarse or fine linen. In spring, I plow and sow—my body is sufficient for labor. In autumn, I harvest and store—my person is sufficient for rest. I rise with the sun and rest with its setting. I roam freely between heaven and earth, and my heart is content. Why would I desire the empire? Alas, you do not understand me!\" Thereupon, he refused it and departed, entering the deep mountains, where no one knew his whereabouts.\n\nShun offered the empire to his friend, the farmer of Shihu. The farmer of Shihu said: \"How earnest and toilsome is the ruler’s labor!\" He deemed Shun’s virtue insufficient and so, with his wife carrying their child on her head and he bearing their belongings on his back, they fled to the sea, never to return.\n\n\"Earnest and toilsome\"—describes one who labors diligently. \"Deemed Shun’s virtue insufficient\"—this means it was not natural virtue. Both men fled, one with his wife carrying their child on her head, the other bearing their belongings on his back. These two passages lack concluding remarks, as their meaning is the same as the preceding.\n\nKing Tai of the Zhou dwelt in Bin. The Di people attacked, and though he offered them furs and silks, they refused; he offered them dogs and horses, they refused; he offered them pearls and jades, they refused. What the Di people sought was land. King Tai said: \"To dwell with another’s elder brother and kill his younger brother, to dwell with another’s father and kill his son—I cannot bear it. All of you, do your best to remain here. Whether you serve as my subjects or as subjects of the Di, what difference is there? Moreover, I have heard that one should not harm what one nurtures with what is used for nurturing.\" Thereupon, he took up his staff and departed. The people followed in a continuous stream, and they established a state at the foot of Mount Qi. King Tai can indeed be called one who knew how to honor life. One who honors life, though rich and noble, does not let what sustains him harm his person; though poor and lowly, does not let profit burden his form. The people of today who hold high office and exalted rank all fear losing them, and in their pursuit of profit, they lightly risk their lives—are they not deluded?\n\n\"What is used for nurturing\"—this refers to what one relies on for sustenance, namely, land. \"What is nurtured\"—the people. \"Honor life\"—this means valuing one’s person above external things. This passage criticizes those of the time who were obsessed with loss.\n\nThe people of Yue assassinated their ruler for three generations. Prince Sou, fearing this, fled to Danru. But Yue, left without a ruler, searched for Prince Sou and could not find him. They pursued him to Danru, but Prince Sou refused to emerge. The people of Yue fumigated him with mugwort and carried him out in a jade carriage. Prince Sou grasped the reins, mounted the carriage, looked up to the sky, and cried: \"Rulership! Rulership! Could you not spare me?\" Prince Sou did not hate being a ruler; he hated the calamities that come with rulership. One like Prince Sou can indeed be said not to have let the state harm his life. This was precisely what the people of Yue desired—to make him their ruler.",

Thus it is said that the people of Yue desired to make him their ruler.\n\nHan and Wei contended over disputed territory. Master Zihua visited Duke Zhaoxi, who wore a troubled expression. Master Zihua said: \"Suppose now that the world inscribed a contract before you, its words stating: 'If you seize it with your left hand, your right hand will be severed; if you seize it with your right hand, your left hand will be severed. Yet whoever seizes it shall possess the world.' Would you seize it?\" Duke Zhaoxi said: \"I would not.\" Master Zihua said: \"Excellent. From this perspective, both arms are weightier than the world, and the body is weightier still than both arms. How much lighter, then, is Han compared to the world! And what you now contend over is far lighter than Han. Yet you grieve, harming your life with sorrow and distress—this is truly misguided.\"\n\n*攫 (jué) means to seize or grasp. 铭 (míng) is like a contract. 废 (fèi) means to sever and discard. To seize the contract is to gain the world, yet one who cherishes his body would not seize it—how much less, then, when comparing Han to the world, is it worth the loss! To grieve over not obtaining it, to the point of harming one’s life, is to bring about one’s own ruin—this is weightier even than losing an arm. Thus it is said: to know the weight of things.

      "translated_text": "The term *tu zha* (土苴): the first character is pronounced *che* (上音撦), the second *zhi ya* (下知雅反), meaning dregs or糟粕. This implies that the achievements of emperors and kings in governing the world and the state are, within the Dao of sages, merely leftover affairs. The body is the foundation of the world and the state; cultivating the self enables one to govern the world and the state—this is the discourse of sages and worthies.\n\nZhuangzi’s words make such distinctions, and people often assume he divides matters into refined and coarse, splitting them into two separate realms. Yet they fail to grasp his true intent: that one who understands the Dao is not burdened by external things in their fundamental mind. Thus, Yao’s rejection of the yellow imperial carriage, or Shun and Yu’s non-attachment to possessing the world—only thus can the governance of non-action be fully realized. However, his rhetoric may at times be overly emphatic.\n\nThe four characters *xu yu tu zha* (绪余土苴) arise from these leftover affairs, much like saying dust, filth, chaff, and husks can be molded into Yao and Shun. Where his phrasing exceeds propriety, it is of this kind. Wang Anshi’s scholarship truly takes this as a division into two realms, then seeks to apply it by frequently citing the terms *xu yu* and *tu zha*. This is why Zhu Xi deeply debated the matter.\n\nZhuangzi’s excessive rhetoric may mislead later generations and thus seems blameworthy, yet his true intention was not so. To endanger the body and abandon life in pursuit of external things is precisely to burden the mind with externals.\n\nThe phrase *suo yi zhi* (所以之) means \"that toward which one proceeds.\"",

      "translated_text": "The phrase *suo yi zhi suo yi wei* (\"that toward which one proceeds, that by which one proceeds\") expresses but a single idea. To shoot a sparrow with a pearl—no one would willingly do so. To burden the body with external things—yet people fail to recognize this. The analogy of the arm is most clear and apt.\n\nThis passage resembles those in the \"Inner Chapters.\" In *Liezi*, when Qiong’s appearance showed the signs of hunger, a guest spoke of it to Ziyang, the ruler of Zheng: \"Lie Yukou is a man of the Dao. Living in your state, he suffers privation—does this not suggest you do not esteem men of worth?\" Ziyang immediately ordered an official to send him grain. Liezi bowed twice to the messenger and declined. When the messenger left, Liezi entered his home, where his wife, striking her breast, said: \"I have heard that the wife and children of a man of the Dao all enjoy ease and happiness. Now you show the signs of hunger. The ruler, recognizing his error, sent you food, yet you refused it—is this not fate?\" Liezi laughed and replied: \"The ruler does not know me himself. He sent me grain only because of another’s words. When he punishes me in the future, it will likewise be on the basis of another’s words. This is why I did not accept it.\" In the end, the people indeed rose in rebellion and killed Ziyang.\n\nThe minister of Zheng said: \"Ziyang was Liezi’s ruler. He sent grain on the basis of another’s words, showing he did not truly know him. If one is not truly known, then praise may be believed, but so too may slander.\" This reasoning is also most apt.\n\nThis passage is similar to one in *Liezi*. When King Zhao of Chu lost his state, a butcher who slaughtered sheep fled with him. When the king returned to his state and was about to reward those who had followed him, the butcher came forward and said: \"When the great king lost his state, I lost my butcher’s stall. Now that the great king has returned, I too have regained my butcher’s stall. My rank and emolument have been restored—what reward is there to give?\" The king said: \"Insist that he accept.\" The butcher replied: \"The great king lost his state not through any fault of mine, so I dared not submit to punishment. The great king’s return is not through any merit of mine, so I dared not claim reward.\" The king said: \"Let me see him.\" The butcher said: \"According to the laws of Chu, only those who have rendered great service may be granted an audience. My wisdom was insufficient to preserve the state, and my courage was insufficient to die defending it. When the Wu army entered Ying, I fled in fear of danger—not because I deliberately followed the great king. Now, if the great king wishes to set aside the law and break precedent to see me, this is not what I have heard is right under heaven.\" The king said to Sima Ziqi: \"The butcher’s station is lowly, yet his exposition of principle is lofty. You must secure him for me with the rank of the Three Standards.\" The butcher said: \"I know the rank of the Three Standards is nobler than my butcher’s stall, and the emolument of ten thousand bushels is richer than my butcher’s profit. Yet how could I greedily accept rank and emolument and thereby cause my lord to gain a reputation for reckless bestowal? I dare not accept. I wish only to return to my butcher’s stall.\" He thus declined the offer.\n\nWhen the great king returned to his state, the butcher regained his stall—each returned to his proper place. The Three Standards refer to the Three Dukes. The carriages and robes of the Three Dukes each have their own distinguishing banners, hence the term \"Three Standards.\" This passage is also excellent.\n\nYuan Xian lived in Lu in a walled hut with a circumference of one *du*. The roof was thatched with cogon grass, the door was incomplete, and the hinge was made of mulberry wood. A jar served as the window for two rooms. Coarse cloth stopped the gaps above, while below, dampness seeped through. Yet he sat upright and sang. Zigong arrived in a grand carriage, his inner robe dark blue and his outer robe white, the canopy too wide to pass through the alley. He went to see Yuan Xian. Yuan Xian, wearing a cap of rushes, shoes of hemp, and leaning on a staff of bramble, came to the gate. Zigong said: \"Alas! Master, what ails you?\" Yuan Xian replied: \"I have heard that to lack wealth is called poverty, and to study yet be unable to practice is called affliction. Now, I am poor—not afflicted.\" Zigong stepped back, his face showing shame. Yuan Xian laughed and said: \"To act in pursuit of worldly favor, to befriend for mutual advantage, to study for others, to teach for oneself, to use benevolence and righteousness as a pretext, and to adorn oneself with carriages and horses—these are things I cannot bear to do.\"\n\n*Ci* means thatch; to cover a house with grass.",
      "overlap_context": "Anshi’s scholarship truly takes this as a division into two realms, then seeks to apply it by frequently citing the terms *xu yu* and *tu zha*. This is why Zhu Xi deeply debated the matter.\n\nZhuangzi’s excessive rhetoric may mislead later generations and thus seems blameworthy, yet his true intention was not so. To endanger the body and abandon life in pursuit of external things is precisely to burden the mind with externals.\n\nThe phrase *suo yi zhi* (所以之) means \"that toward which one proceeds.\"",

      "translated_text": "The two chambers of their dwelling both used jars as windows—hence \"two chambers with jar-windows.\" Walls were hollowed out to admit light, called *you*; old clothes were used to seal these windows against wind and rain—hence \"coarse cloth to block them.\" *Kuang* means to sit upright. *Gan* is a deep blue-red color. *Biao su* refers to wearing white as an outer robe. \"The canopy too wide to pass through the alley\" describes the narrowness of the lane compared to the carriage. *Hua guan* means a cap made of birch bark. *Xi lv* describes dragging one’s hemp shoes. \"To act in pursuit of worldly favor\" means conducting oneself to curry favor with the age. \"To befriend for mutual advantage\" means associating with unworthy people. \"To study for others, to teach for oneself\" means learning not for one’s own sake but for others, and teaching not for the Dao but for profit. To \"use benevolence and righteousness as a pretext\" is to employ them to gloss over wickedness—hence \"the wickedness of benevolence and righteousness.\"\n\nWhen Master Zeng resided in Wei, his quilted robe had no outer layer, his complexion was swollen, his hands and feet calloused. For three days he did not kindle a fire, and for ten years he did not make new clothes. When he straightened his cap, its strings snapped; when he grasped his lapel, his elbow showed; when he put on his shoes, the heels split. Yet as he dragged his hemp shoes, he sang the *Odes of Shang*, his voice filling heaven and earth as if issuing from metal or stone. The Son of Heaven could not make him a minister, nor could the feudal lords befriend him. Thus, those who cultivate the will forget the body; those who cultivate the body forget profit; those who attain the Dao forget the mind.\n\nA *yun* robe is today’s padded garment. \"No outer layer\" means the outer fabric was worn through, exposing the padding. *Zhong kuai* describes a swollen, puffy appearance. \"Straightening his cap, the strings snapped\" means that as he adjusted his cap, its ties broke—the ties being what secure the cap. \"Elbow showing\" means the sleeves of his lapel were torn. \"Heels split\" means the backs of his shoes were broken. *Ye xi* means to drag oneself along. *Shang song* refers to the songs he sang. \"As if issuing from metal or stone\" describes the rhythmic quality. \"Those who cultivate the will forget the body\" means they do not burden their minds with nurturing the body. \"Those who cultivate the body forget profit\" means they do not exhaust themselves chasing external things. \"Those who attain the Dao forget the mind\" means that without a mind, one draws near the Dao.\n\nConfucius said to Yan Hui, \"Hui, your family is poor and your station low—why do you not take office?\" Yan Hui replied, \"I do not wish to. Outside the city walls, I have fifty *mu* of fields, enough to provide gruel and porridge; within the city walls, ten *mu* of fields, enough for silk and hemp. Playing the zither is enough for my amusement, and what I have learned of the Master’s Dao is enough for my joy. I do not wish to take office.\" Confucius’s expression changed as he sighed, \"How excellent is Hui’s intent! I have heard that those who know contentment do not burden themselves with profit, that those who are truly self-possessed do not fear loss, and that those who cultivate virtue within are not ashamed without rank. I have recited this for a long time, but only now do I see it in you—this is my gain.\"\n\n\"Fields outside the city walls\" refers to farmland; \"within the city walls,\" to gardens. Yan Hui may not have actually possessed these—Zhuangzi’s words may not be entirely trustworthy. \"What I have learned of the Master’s Dao is enough for my joy\"—but what is this joy? Thus, the Cheng brothers often instructed others to seek Yan Hui’s joy, a matter not to be dismissed lightly. \"Those who know contentment do not burden themselves with profit\" means that those content with themselves have no need of external things. \"Truly self-possessed\" means that if what is within is genuinely sufficient, the loss of external things brings neither joy nor fear. \"Not ashamed without rank\" means not feeling shame at being unknown. \"Recited this for a long time, but only now do I see it\" means having heard these words before but only now witnessing them in a person. \"This is my gain\" means truly having gained a friend.\n\nPrince Mou of Zhongshan said to Zhanzi, \"Though my body dwells by rivers and seas, my heart remains in the palace halls of Wei—what is to be done?\" Zhanzi replied, \"Value life, and profit will become light.\" Prince Mou said, \"Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself.\" Zhanzi said, \"If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow your spirit—why resent it? If one cannot overcome oneself yet forcibly resists, this is called double injury. Those doubly injured do not enter the ranks of the long-lived.\"\n\n\"Heart remains in the palace halls\" means being unable to forget wealth and rank. \"Value life, then profit becomes light\" means that if one recognizes the preciousness of the original mind, external things grow light. \"Though I know this, I cannot overcome myself\" means that principle has not yet triumphed over desire. \"If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow\" means that if the mind cannot yet master itself, one should listen and comply for the time being. This refers to dwelling by rivers and seas while such thoughts occasionally arise—there is no need to forcibly suppress them. If one forcibly suppresses them, it may internally harm the spirit and even lead to illness. Hence, \"If you cannot overcome yourself, then follow\"—following causes no harm to the spirit, so \"why resent it?\" \"Cannot overcome oneself\" is one injury. This refers to the moment when such thoughts arise. If, when these thoughts arise, one forcibly suppresses them instead of complying, the struggle with self-control is a second injury. Hence, \"double injury\"—this is not the way to longevity. \"Do not enter the ranks of the long-lived\" means not joining the category of those who live long.\n\nPrince Mou of Wei was the son of a ruler of ten thousand chariots, yet he retired to cliffs and caves—something difficult for a commoner. Though he had not yet reached the Dao, he could be said to have the intent. These words align with the *Doctrine of the Mean*’s encouragement to practice.\n\nWhen Confucius was besieged between Chen and Cai, for seven days he ate no cooked food, subsisting on unsalted vegetable broth. His complexion was deeply fatigued, yet he sang in his chamber while playing the zither. Yan Hui was picking vegetables, while Zilu and Zigong discussed, saying, \"The Master was twice expelled from Lu, his traces erased in Wei, his tree felled in Song, and now he is trapped between Chen and Cai. Those who would kill him bear no guilt; those who would lend him aid face no prohibition. Yet he sings and plays the zither without ceasing—can a gentleman be so shameless?\"\n\nYan Hui had no reply. He entered and told Confucius, who pushed aside the zither and sighed deeply, \"You and Ci are petty men! Summon them, and I will speak with them.\" When Zilu and Zigong entered, Zilu said, \"In such circumstances, one could truly be called destitute.\" Confucius said, \"What words are these? When a gentleman is in accord with the Dao, that is called accord; when he is cut off from the Dao, that is called destitution. Now, I embrace the Dao of benevolence and righteousness yet encounter the calamities of a disordered age—how can this be called destitution? Thus, when I examine myself, I am not cut off from the Dao; when facing adversity, I do not lose my virtue. When the cold arrives and frost and snow descend, I thereby know the flourishing of the pine and cypress. The straits of Chen and Cai may be my good fortune!\"\n\nConfucius then composed himself, returned to the zither, and sang. Zilu, emboldened, took up a shield and danced. Zigong said, \"I did not know the height of heaven or the depth of the earth!\"\n\nThose of old who attained the Dao found joy in poverty and joy in prosperity—their joy did not depend on poverty or prosperity.",

      "translated_text": "When the Dao and virtue are present in this way, then destitution and success become as orderly as the sequence of cold and heat, wind and rain. Thus, Xu You found joy in Yingyang, and Gong Bo found contentment in Qiushou. \"A broth of greens without a grain of rice\"—this speaks of having vegetables but no rice, yet borrowing from others to press upon them is not forbidden, nor is it deemed a fault. When the cold arrives, one knows the flourishing of the pine and cypress—this is what is meant by \"only when the year grows cold do we know the pine and cypress.\" Through the straits of Chen and Cai, the Way of the sage in enduring destitution can manifest itself and serve as a model for later generations. Thus it is said, \"How fortunate for me in this!\"\n\n*Xiaoran* suggests a carefree and unconstrained manner; *fan qin* means to take up the zither again and play. *Guran* describes a leaping or exultant movement—Zilu, upon hearing these words, rejoiced. The following lines from Zigong indicate his enlightenment through this. Qiushou is the name of a mountain; the so-called Gong Bo may not necessarily refer to the Gonghe Regency—most of these are likely allegorical and difficult to verify in fact. The intent is that Zigong, overjoyed, spoke thus, praising the likes of Xu You who could remain joyful in destitution by delighting in their Way. Xu You and Gong Bo are both invoked through Zigong’s words. Shang and Zhou refer to the Zhou capital, which included the former lands and people of Shang.\n\nShun wished to yield the world to his friend, Beiren Wuze. Beiren Wuze said, \"How strange is the ruler of later times! Dwelling in the fields and furrows, yet wandering at Yao’s gate—this alone would not suffice. Now he further wishes to smear me with his disgraceful conduct. I am ashamed to see him!\" Thereupon he cast himself into the Qingling Abyss.\n\n*\"This alone would not suffice\"* means that Shun’s actions were already improper; your own failings are yours alone to bear—why further defile me? Thus he drowned himself. This account appears nowhere else in the classics and is likely allegorical. *\"Disgraceful conduct\"* refers to base virtue.\n\nWhen Tang was about to attack Jie, he consulted Bian Sui, who said, \"This is not my affair.\" Tang asked, \"Who would be suitable?\" Bian Sui replied, \"I do not know.\" Tang then consulted Wu Guang, who said, \"This is not my affair.\" Tang asked, \"Who would be suitable?\" Wu Guang replied, \"I do not know.\" Tang said, \"What of Yi Yin?\" Wu Guang said, \"He is strong and enduring of filth—I know nothing else of him.\" Tang then conspired with Yi Yin to attack Jie, defeated him, and offered the throne to Bian Sui. Bian Sui declined, saying, \"When the ruler attacked Jie, he consulted me—had I plotted with him, he would have taken me for a traitor. Having defeated Jie, he now offers me the throne—he would take me for a greedy man. I was born in a disordered age, and this man of no Dao has twice defiled me with his disgraceful conduct. I cannot bear to hear of it again!\" Thereupon he cast himself into the Zhou River and died.\n\nTang then offered the throne to Wu Guang, saying, \"The wise plan it, the martial accomplish it, and the benevolent occupy it—this is the Way of antiquity. Why do you not take your place?\" Wu Guang declined, saying, \"To depose a ruler is not righteous; to kill the people is not benevolent; for others to face peril while I enjoy the benefits is not upright. I have heard that one who does not act righteously does not accept its emoluments, and in an age without the Dao, one does not tread its soil—how much less accept its honors? I cannot bear to witness this any longer!\" Thereupon he carried a stone and drowned himself in the Lu River.\n\n*\"Strong and enduring of filth\"* suggests the capacity for action and the patience to endure worldly disgrace. *\"The martial accomplish it\"* refers to those who succeed in warfare. *\"The benevolent occupy it\"* refers to Wu Guang as the benevolent one.\n\nBian Sui and Wu Guang were both recluses of old, though their acts of drowning themselves cannot be verified—these, too, may be allegorical.\n\nIn the rise of the Zhou, there were two knights dwelling in Guzhu named Boyi and Shuqi. The two said to each other, \"We have heard there is one in the west who seems to possess the Dao—let us go and observe.\" When they reached Qiyang, King Wu heard of them and sent the Duke of Zhou to meet them and make a covenant, saying, \"You shall be raised two ranks in wealth and appointed to the first rank of office.\" He then sacrificed an animal, buried its blood, and swore the oath.

      "translated_text": "At that time, sacrifices were performed with utmost reverence yet without prayers for blessings. In their dealings with others, they were loyal and trustworthy, governing with diligence yet seeking nothing in return. They delighted in governance when governing, and delighted in order when order prevailed—not seeking self-perfection through others’ corruption, nor elevating themselves through others’ baseness, nor profiting from the times. Now, the Zhou, seeing the disorder of the Yin, hastily seized power, scheming above while bribing below, relying on military force to maintain authority, slaughtering animals to swear oaths as a pledge of trust, flaunting their conduct to please the masses, and resorting to warfare to secure gain. This is but replacing one chaos with another, one tyranny with another. We have heard that the knights of old, when encountering an age of order, did not shirk their duty, and when facing an age of chaos, did not cling to mere survival. Today, the world is benighted, the virtue of the Zhou has declined—it is but a mire in which to sully ourselves. Better to avoid it and keep our conduct pure.\n\nThe two brothers then journeyed north to Mount Shouyang, where they starved to death. As for Boyi and Shuqi, when it came to wealth and rank, if they could be done without, they would never rely on them. With lofty integrity and unyielding conduct, they rejoiced in their own resolve, refusing to serve the world. Such was the steadfastness of these two knights.\n\n*Shu* in *Shu Dan* is a term for younger brother. *Adding two ranks of wealth* means doubling their emolument. *Appointed to the first rank of office* refers to the highest grade of official position. *Slaughtering an animal and burying its blood* describes the ritual of swearing an oath with sacrificial blood before interring it. Their reference to Shennong alludes to the ancient age, which was not like this.\n\nSacrifices were performed in their proper seasons with reverence, yet without supplication for blessings. *Governing with diligence yet seeking nothing* means having no desire for fame. *Delighting in governance when governing, and in order when order prevailed* suggests acting without self-serving intent. *Hastily seizing power* describes their eager pursuit of virtuous governance. *Bribing below* refers to using ranks and emoluments to entice the world’s knights. *Relying on military force* means resorting to perilous means. *Maintaining authority* means establishing martial power.",

Hòu Shān notes that in one’s parents’ years, one still relies on salary—hence the use of this \"rely.\" *Defiant conduct* is excessive. *To be obstinate* means to be excessive and nothing more—this is precisely defiant conduct. It is said that Bóyí and Shūqí did not seek lofty integrity through defiant conduct; had there been even the slightest principle permitting acceptance of wealth and rank, they would have accepted it. They would not have gone to such extreme lengths. Only because there was no justifiable reason to accept did they act thus.\n\n*The world is benighted, the Shāng in chaos*—this refers to Zhōu, which, though newly risen, already acted in such a manner. Hating that it seized the world through cunning schemes, the text calls this \"the decline of virtue.\" This piece is incomplete and resembles the style of *Zhuāngzǐ*, yet passages like *shooting sparrows with a pearl* and *the weight of the world on one’s arms* or *the butcher of sheep* are still fine, though ultimately not equal to his other works. As for *Robber Zhí*, *Sword*, and *Fisherman*, they are even worse.\n\n*Zhuāngzǐ* Miscellaneous Chapters, \"Robber Zhí,\" Chapter Twenty-Nine:\nConfucius was a friend of Liǔxià Jì. Liǔxià Jì’s younger brother was named Robber Zhí. Robber Zhí led a band of nine thousand men, rampaging across the world, invading and plundering the feudal lords, breaking into houses, driving off people’s cattle and horses, seizing their wives and daughters, greedy for gain and forgetting kinship, disregarding parents and brothers, and not sacrificing to ancestors. Wherever he passed, the people of great states guarded their cities, while those of small states took refuge in their strongholds—all the world suffered under him.\n\nConfucius said to Liǔxià Jì, \"As a father, one must be able to instruct one’s son; as an elder brother, one must be able to teach one’s younger brother. If a father cannot instruct his son, or an elder brother cannot teach his younger brother, then the intimacy between father and son, elder and younger brother, is worthless. Now, sir, you are a man of talent in this age, yet your younger brother is Robber Zhí, a scourge to the world, and you cannot teach him. I secretly feel shame for you. I beg to go and admonish him on your behalf.\"\n\nLiǔxià Jì said, \"Sir, you say that as a father, one must be able to instruct one’s son, and as an elder brother, one must be able to teach one’s younger brother. But if a son does not heed his father’s instruction, or a younger brother does not accept his elder brother’s teaching, even with your eloquence today, what can you do? Moreover, Zhí’s nature is such that his mind is like a gushing spring, his will like a whirlwind. He is strong enough to resist enemies, eloquent enough to gloss over wrongs. When things go his way, he is pleased; when they do not, he is enraged. He is quick to insult others with words. You must not go.\"\n\nConfucius did not listen. With Yán Huí driving and Zǐgòng on his right, he went to see Robber Zhí. Robber Zhí was just then resting with his troops on the southern slope of Mount Tài, mincing human livers for his meal. Confucius alighted from his carriage and approached, saying to the herald, \"I, Kǒng Qiū of Lǔ, have heard of the general’s lofty virtue and respectfully bow twice in greeting.\" The herald went in to announce him.\n\nWhen Robber Zhí heard this, he flew into a great rage, his eyes blazing like stars, his hair bristling beneath his cap. \"Is this not that crafty, deceitful man Kǒng Qiū of Lǔ? Tell him for me: you fabricate words, concoct phrases, falsely invoke the names of Wén and Wǔ, wear a cap like a tree branch, gird yourself with the ribs of a dead ox, prattle endlessly with your glib tongue, create right and wrong at will to delude the lords of the world, and lead the scholars of the world astray from their roots. You recklessly preach filial piety and brotherly love, hoping to gain enfeoffment and riches by luck. Your crimes are great and heavy—flee quickly, or I will add your liver to my midday meal!\"\n\nConfucius again sent word, saying, \"I am fortunate to be acquainted with Jì and wish to gaze upon the hem of your robe.\" The herald went in again to announce him. Robber Zhí said, \"Bring him forward.\" Confucius hurried forward, avoided the mat, stepped back, and bowed twice.\n\nRobber Zhí, greatly enraged, stretched out his legs, grasped his sword, glared with bulging eyes, and roared like a tiger. \"Qiū, come forward! If your words please me, you will live; if they displease me, you will die.\"\n\nConfucius said, \"I have heard that there are three virtues in the world. To be born tall and large, handsome and peerless, so that young and old, noble and base all delight in seeing you—this is the highest virtue. To comprehend the workings of Heaven and Earth and distinguish all things—this is the middle virtue. To be brave, resolute, and daring, gathering multitudes and leading armies—this is the lowest virtue.\"",

      "translated_text": "\"The world is vast indeed! Yao and Shun possessed all under Heaven, yet their descendants had not even a speck of land to stand a cone. Tang and Wu established themselves as the Sons of Heaven, yet their posterity was cut off and extinguished. Was this not because the profit they sought was too great?\n\nMoreover, I have heard that in ancient times, beasts were many and people few. Thus, the people all dwelt in nests to avoid them, gathering acorns by day and roosting in trees by night—hence they were called the people of the Nest-Builder. In ancient times, the people knew not how to make clothing. In summer, they piled up firewood, and in winter, they warmed themselves by it—hence they were called the people who knew how to live. In the age of Shennong, they lay at ease and rose in peace. The people knew their mothers but not their fathers, and lived among the elk and deer. They tilled the soil to eat and wove cloth to wear, with no thought of harming one another. This was the height of perfect virtue.\n\nYet the Yellow Emperor could not preserve such virtue. He fought with Chiyou at the wilds of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao and Shun arose and appointed ministers. Tang exiled his lord, and King Wu killed Zhou. From that time onward, the strong oppressed the weak, and the many bullied the few. From Tang and Wu onward, all have been the followers of disorder.\n\nNow, you cultivate the Way of Wen and Wu, grasp the world’s debates, and teach later generations. You wear fine robes and narrow sashes, speak with artful words and false conduct to delude the lords of the world, all to seek wealth and honor. There is no greater thief than you! Why does the world not call you Robber Qiu, but instead calls me Robber Zhi?\n\nYou used sweet words to deceive Zilu and make him follow you. You made Zilu remove his towering cap and lay aside his long sword to receive your teachings. The world all says, ‘Kong Qiu can stop violence and prohibit wrongdoing.’ Yet in the end, Zilu sought to kill the lord of Wei, and when the affair failed, he was minced to pieces at the eastern gate of Wei. This was because your teaching was insufficient.\n\nYou call yourself a man of talent and a sage? Then why were you twice driven from Lu, your traces erased in Wei, impoverished in Qi, besieged in Chen and Cai, and left with no place in the world to dwell? You taught Zilu to meet such a fate—above, you brought no benefit to yourself; below, you brought no benefit to others. Is your Way worth esteeming?\n\nOf those the world exalts, none surpasses the Yellow Emperor. Yet even he could not preserve his virtue in full. He fought at the wilds of Zhuolu, and blood flowed for a hundred *li*. Yao was unkind, Shun was undutiful, Yu was crippled by toil, Tang exiled his lord, King Wu attacked Zhou, and King Wen was imprisoned at Youli. These six men are those the world exalts. Yet upon examination, all were deluded by profit, forcing themselves to act contrary to their true nature. Their conduct is truly shameful.\n\nAs for the so-called worthy men of the world—Bo Yi and Shu Qi—Bo Yi and Shu Qi renounced the lordship of Gubuzhu and starved to death on Mount Shouyang, their bones and flesh left unburied. Bao Jiao adorned his conduct to condemn the world and died clinging to a tree. Shentu Di remonstrated but was not heeded; he carried a stone and threw himself into the river, where he was eaten by fish and turtles. Jie Zitui was most loyal: he cut flesh from his own thigh to feed Duke Wen. Later, Duke Wen betrayed him, and Zitui, enraged, left and burned to death clinging to a tree. Weisheng made a tryst with a woman beneath a bridge. When the woman did not come and the waters rose, he did not leave but held fast to the bridge pillar and drowned. These four men were no different from dismembered dogs or drifting pigs. They clutched their begging bowls, all seeking fame and scorning death, heedless of preserving their lives and nurturing their destiny.\n\nOf the so-called loyal ministers of the world, none surpass Prince Bigan and Wu Zixu. Zixu was drowned in the river, and Bigan had his heart cut out. These two men are called loyal ministers, yet in the end, they were laughed at by all under Heaven. From a higher perspective, even Zixu and Bigan are not worth esteeming.\n\nAs for what you, Qiu, have used to deceive me—if you speak to me of spirits and ghosts, I cannot know it.

The long-lived reach a hundred years, the moderately long-lived eighty, and the short-lived sixty. Yet within this span, one must subtract days lost to illness, emaciation, mourning, death, and sorrow—so that in a month, one may open one’s mouth to laugh no more than four or five days at most.\n\nHeaven and Earth are without end, but human death comes at its appointed time. Clutching the tools of our fleeting span, we entrust ourselves to the boundless, vanishing in an instant like a swift steed galloping past a crack in the wall. Those who cannot delight their will and nurture their lifespan are not masters of the Dao.\n\nAll that you, Qiu, have spoken are things I reject. Leave at once, return home, and speak no more of it.

His eyes were dazed, seeing nothing; his complexion was ashen, like dead embers. He leaned against the crossbar, head bowed, unable to catch his breath. Upon returning to Lu, just outside the eastern gate, he encountered Li Xiashu under a willow tree.\n\nLi Xiashu said, “For days now, you have been absent—your carriage and horses bore signs of travel. Might you have gone to see Zhi?”\n\nConfucius looked up to the heavens and sighed. “Yes.”\n\nLi Xiashu said, “Did Zhi perhaps offend you as he did before?”\n\nConfucius said, “Indeed. What I did was like needlessly cauterizing myself when I had no illness—running wildly to measure a tiger’s head, braiding its whiskers, nearly escaping the tiger’s jaws by sheer luck. Entering a fortress, one bolts the gates and guards oneself. My heart surged like a gushing spring, my qi still vigorous; my intent soared like the wind, empty and arrogant, light and reckless. I falsely invoked the ways of Wen and Wu, like stripping bark from a branch to make a cap or flaying an ox’s flank for leather. I was fortunate to gain favor with Xiashu and glimpse his presence beneath the curtain—this was my second audience. Yet he spoke of knowing Heaven and Earth, as if his knowledge could encompass them, as if Heaven and Earth could not escape its bounds. He claimed to discern all things, to possess knowledge without limit. And in the end, this is how it concluded.”",

      "translated_text": "To grasp its end: Yu became half-paralyzed, his hands and feet calloused. Who could discuss this in detail? His body was torn apart like a dismembered dog, his blood flowed like a slaughtered pig—this was self-destruction. He held a gourd to beg, seeking from others. To be *li* (detached) is to be mired in fame, clinging to names. Thus it is said: to be detached from fame is not to contemplate the root, not to know one’s true nature. *Jiji* (restless) means *jiji* (urgent). Holding the reins, he lost them thrice—this speaks of the reins slipping repeatedly. The carriage and horses bore the marks of travel, as if they had somewhere to go yet were returning. Is it not so subtle as to be absent? Could it be that you have gone to see Robber Zhi?\n\nAs for what came before—those were my former words.\n\nZizhang asked Mang Goude, “Why not act? Without action, there is no trust; without trust, there is no task; without task, there is no profit.” Thus, one observes fame and calculates profit, and righteousness is truly therein. If you abandon fame and profit and return them to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct cannot be absent for a single day.\n\nMang Goude said, “The shameless grow rich; the trusted become prominent. The greatest fame and profit lie in shamelessness and trust.” Thus, one observes fame and calculates profit, and trust is truly therein. If you abandon fame and profit and return them to the heart, then the scholar’s conduct embraces their Heaven.\n\nZizhang said, “In the past, Jie and Zhou were noble as Sons of Heaven, rich with all under Heaven. Now, if you tell a hoarder, ‘Your conduct is like Jie and Zhou,’ they will flush with shame and harbor resentment—this is what petty men despise. Confucius and Mo Di were poor as commoners. Now, if you tell a prime minister, ‘Your conduct is like Confucius and Mo Di,’ they will change their expression and deem it insufficient—this is the true nobility of scholars. Thus, to be powerful as a Son of Heaven is not necessarily noble; to be poor as a commoner is not necessarily base. The distinction between noble and base lies in the beauty or ugliness of conduct.”\n\nMang Goude said, “Petty thieves are imprisoned; great thieves become lords. At the gates of lords, righteous scholars reside. In the past, Duke Huan of Qi, Xiaobai, killed his brother and took his sister-in-law, yet Guan Zhong served as his minister. Tian Chengzi murdered his lord and usurped the state, yet Confucius accepted his gifts. To condemn their conduct is to lower them; to discuss their words is to elevate them—this is the contradiction of speech and action warring in the breast. Is it not perverse?\n\nThus, the *Book* says: ‘Who is ugly? Who is beautiful? The successful are heads; the failed are tails.’ Zizhang said, ‘If you do not act, then you will guard against sorrow without order, noble and base without righteousness, elder and younger without sequence. How will the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?’\n\nMang Goude said, “Yao killed his eldest son; Shun exiled his younger brother—was there order in guarding against sorrow? Tang punished Jie; King Wu killed Zhou—was there righteousness in noble and base? King Ji was the rightful heir; the Duke of Zhou killed his elder brother—was there sequence in elder and younger? The Confucians speak false words; the Mohists preach universal love—how will the Five Constants and Six Positions be distinguished?\n\nMoreover, you rectify for fame; I rectify for profit. The reality of fame and profit does not accord with principle, does not reflect the Dao. Daily, I dispute with you before Wu Yue, saying: ‘Petty men die for wealth; gentlemen die for fame.’ Their motives differ, their natures change, yet in the end, they abandon what they should do and die for what they should not—this is the same. Thus it is said: ‘Do not act as a petty man, and turn to die for Heaven. Do not act as a gentleman, and follow Heaven’s principle.’\n\nWhether crooked or straight, observe them equally—this is the ultimate principle of Heaven. Facing the four directions, ebb and flow with the seasons. Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism, and intent will wander with the Dao. Without turning, there is no conduct; without completion, there is no righteousness. To lose what you pursue, to gain without seeking, to abandon and follow Heaven—Bi Gan had his heart carved out; Wu Zixu had his eyes gouged out—these were the calamities of loyalty. Zhi Gong testified against his father; Weisheng drowned—these were the disasters of trust. Baozi stood by a pole; Shenzi did not defend himself—these were the harms of integrity. Confucius did not see his mother; Kuangzi did not see his father—these were the failures of righteousness.\n\nThese are what the past transmitted and the present discusses, taking them as the standard for scholars: rectify your words, verify your conduct. Thus, they suffer their misfortunes and encounter their disasters.\n\nWhy not act? This means: why not cultivate virtue? To observe fame and calculate righteousness, and righteousness is truly therein—this means that to seek fame and profit, only cultivating righteousness is correct. If one abandons fame and profit, they turn against their heart and have no joy; they must seek them, and nothing but righteous conduct suffices—this is the intent of studying for official salary.\n\n‘Many trustworthy words bring prominence’—this means using many trustworthy words to seek glory, speaking of feigning trust to benefit oneself. Zizhang spoke of seeking profit through righteousness; Mang Goude said, ‘Those who seek fame and profit today do so through deceit.’\n\nIf you say to abandon fame and profit yet turn against the heart, you must seek them—then follow your heart’s desires, indulging in self-satisfaction as a scheme for mere gain, still preserving Heaven’s truth without affectation. Thus it is said: embrace your Heaven.\n\nPetty thieves are imprisoned; great thieves become lords—this is the argument from the *Opening Trunks* chapter. ‘The contradiction of speech and action warring in the breast’ means their conduct disregards their words, their words disregard their conduct. ‘The successful are heads; the failed are tails’—this is what was previously called: those who seize the moment are followers of righteousness; those who lose it are *kuang* men.\n\nThis intent suggests that acts of benevolence and righteousness are all deceit and not Heaven’s truth. The Five Constants are the five virtues; the Six Positions are the three bonds: ruler and minister, father and son, husband and wife.\n\n‘You rectify for fame’ means: if you seek to obtain me through the name of benevolence and righteousness, it is merely for profit, not feigning false names. Fame and profit are not true principles, so it is said: ‘The reality of fame and profit does not accord with principle, does not reflect the Dao.’\n\nWu Yue means ‘unrestrained,’ listening to nature. Mang Goude said, ‘Wu Yue’—this is another allusion in his name, as in the previous chapter’s ‘Knowing Non-Action.’\n\n‘Abandoning what they should do’ means forsaking what they ought to do, not preserving life or protecting nature. ‘Dying for what they should not do’ means acting for profit and fame, which they ought not to do.\n\nTo die for Heaven’s principle and nature is without the names of gentleman or petty man. Thus it is said: ‘Do not act as a petty man, and turn to die for Heaven. Do not act as a gentleman, and follow Heaven’s principle’—this means neither acting as a gentleman nor a petty man, so one can die for the natural principle of your Heaven.\n\nAnd you—whether crooked or straight, observe them equally, for all are the ultimate principle of nature. Thus it is said: ‘Whether crooked or straight, observe them equally as Heaven’s ultimate.’ East, west, south, north each have their direction, and spring, summer, autumn, winter belong to them.”",

I was fortunate to gain favor with Xiashu and glimpse his presence beneath the curtain—this was my second audience. Yet he spoke of knowing Heaven and Earth, as if his knowledge could encompass them, as if Heaven and Earth could not escape its bounds. He claimed to discern all things, to possess knowledge without limit. And in the end, this is how it concluded.”",

      "translated_text": "All ebb and flow, all coming and going, are but a single qi. Thus it is said: \"Face the four directions and observe the ebb and flow of the seasons. Grasp the round mechanism, and there will be no right or wrong.\" Thus it is said: \"Whether right or wrong, grasp the round mechanism, act with sincere intent, and attain it uniquely for yourself—then you may move with ease and embody the Dao.\" Thus it is said: \"Attain it uniquely, and your intent will wander with the Dao, turning away from it.\"\n\nTo act in opposition to the Dao, to seek success by self-styled righteousness, is to lose what is called one’s original truth. Thus it is said: \"Do not turn and act, do not achieve and claim righteousness—lest you lose what you ought to do, and you yourself.\" To hasten toward wealth and seek to die for one’s achievements is to lose one’s natural Heaven. Thus it is said: \"Do not hasten toward wealth, do not die for achievement—lest you abandon your Heaven.\" The word \"do not\" here means \"must not do this\"—it is a prohibition.\n\nTo rectify one’s words means to take loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and righteousness as true. To ensure one’s conduct means to act with loyalty, trustworthiness, integrity, and righteousness. \"Clothed\" means to be covered; \"detached\" means to be separated. It is said that one will inevitably suffer harm. Zizhang sought to practice righteousness to attain wealth and honor, borrowing the language of seeking office to lend it a name.\n\n\"Filled by mere acquisition\" means to satisfy one’s desires through mere acquisition, taking it as the natural Dao. Thus, the question and answer are posed: \"Is it not better to follow one’s true nature than to feign virtue for profit and advancement?\" This echoes Mencius’s distinction between the Heavenly nobility and the human nobility.\n\nWu Zu asked Zhi He: \"Among people, there has never been one who did not pursue fame and seek profit. Those who are wealthy are followed by others; those who are followed become lowly; those who are lowly are honored. To see the lowly and honor them is the way to long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment. Yet you alone have no such intent—is it that you lack the wisdom, or that you know but lack the strength to act?\"\n\nZhi He replied: \"Now, these people—those who live in the same era and dwell in the same village as oneself—take themselves for those who transcend the common and surpass the world. They lack any true principle, yet they survey the times of past and present, distinguishing right from wrong. They abandon what is most weighty and cast aside what is most honorable to pursue what they do. How can their discourse on the way to long life, bodily ease, and joyful contentment not be far from the mark?\n\nThe pain of sorrow and the comfort of serenity are not reflected in their bodies; the fear of alarm and the joy of delight are not reflected in their hearts. They know how to act but not why they act. Thus, even those who are honored as Son of Heaven and possess all under Heaven cannot escape suffering. To 'rectify and not forget' means: Is your lack of desire for wealth and honor due to insufficient wisdom, or do you understand this yet lack the strength to act? Thus, I press the true principle to restrain the heart that seeks wealth and honor, yet you cannot forget it.\n\nThese wealthy and honorable people are those who live in the same era and dwell in the same village as oneself—are they those who transcend the common and surpass the world? They are not so lofty as to be unattainable. Their intent is merely to say: 'These are but ordinary people before my eyes—how could I not know them?' Yet their hearts lack any guiding principle, wholly losing the rectitude of their nature and destiny. They only know how to follow the times to seek their own advantage, being transformed by the common customs. What they do is no different from what ordinary people do.\n\nThe distinction of right and wrong means taking others as wrong and oneself as right, seeking one’s own benefit. 'Past and present' refers to the near and the far—how things were in a previous time, how they are now. They observe the trends of the times to seek their own advantage. What is most weighty and most honorable is the natural principle of Heaven, yet they abandon it all to pursue what they call the quest for wealth and honor. How can this be the way to long life, bodily ease, and nurturing the heart?\n\nThose who seek wealth and honor—whether their bodies are at ease or not, whether their hearts are joyful or sorrowful—they are deluded and unaware, unable to see themselves. Thus it is said: 'Not reflected in the body, not reflected in the heart.' To 'act' is to do what one does—this is human effort. The 'why' of acting is the principle of Heaven. To know human effort but not the principle of Heaven—even if one is Son of Heaven, one cannot escape harm to the body, let alone those below.\"\n\nWu Zu said: \"Wealth, for people, is without disadvantage—it exhausts beauty and exhausts power, reaching what even the utmost person cannot attain, what the worthy cannot match, and what the brave and strong cannot rival. It wields the wisdom and plans of others as its own discernment, and adopts the virtue of others as its own excellence. Without even possessing a state, it commands awe like a lord and father. As for the allure of sounds and sights, flavors and pleasures, power and influence—people delight in them without needing to learn, and their bodies find ease without needing to imitate. Desires and aversions, avoidance and pursuit—these are not taught by a teacher; they are the nature of people. Though all under Heaven may oppose me, who can refuse it?\"\n\nZhi He said: \"The actions of the wise are purposeful, moving with the people without violating their measure. Thus, they are content and do not contend. Without purpose, they do not seek; without insufficiency, they do not contend. They are everywhere yet do not consider themselves greedy; they have surplus yet decline it. They abandon all under Heaven yet do not consider themselves incorrupt. The reality of incorruptibility and greed is not imposed from without—it is reflected in the measure within.\n\nIn power as Son of Heaven, they do not use their nobility to lord over others; possessing all under Heaven, they do not use their wealth to toy with others. They calculate the harm and consider the consequences, seeing it as detrimental to their nature—thus they decline and do not accept. It is not to seek fame and reputation. Yao and Shun ruled as emperors, yet their harmony was not benevolence toward all under Heaven—it was not to harm life with beauty. Shan Juan and Xu You declined the throne, and it was not empty modesty—it was not to harm themselves with affairs. These were all cases of pursuing benefit and declining harm, and all under Heaven calls them worthy. Yet they did not do so to seek fame and reputation.\n\nHere, it does not speak of honor but only of wealth. 'Exhausting beauty' means one can pursue all one desires; 'exhausting power' means one can exercise all authority. Even the utmost person and the worthy cannot match this—it speaks of the power to act for oneself. To 'make others act' and 'wield others' means that wealth can command people—this is the meaning of 'ten thousand spirits in communion.' To desire wealth and hate poverty, to avoid poverty and seek wealth, does not require teaching—it is said: 'It does not await a teacher.' This arises from the natural nature of Heaven. Though all under Heaven may deem it wrong, how can I avoid it?\" This is the speech of the greedy, who are insatiable—thus they are named Wu Zu, the \"Insufficient One,\" and belong to the category of \"filled by mere acquisition.\"",

      "translated_text": "Those who move with the common people speak of how the wise in their actions always take as their foundation what the people jointly receive from Heaven—thus they dare not violate the standards and measures. What the people jointly receive consists of things and principles. Measures are principles. To be content and not contend is to have virtue sufficient within oneself and nothing to strive for. With nothing to rely upon, one does not seek to act; what lies not in others but in Heaven, where human effort has no part—this is called \"nothing to rely upon.\" Knowing that human effort has no part, one ceases to seek. If within oneself there is insufficiency, one exhausts the four directions in striving and seeking, yet does not deem it greed—this is seeking virtue, seeking what lies within. When virtue is sufficient and overflowing, one rejects even external things; though one may reject the world, this is not for the sake of frugality. In both greed and frugality, the reality lies not in acting for others, not in striving outwardly, but in returning to seek within the standards of Heavenly principle and examining them. Thus it is said: \"Returning to examine the measure, using wealth to amuse people and drumming up the world.\" To consider it repeatedly is to turn back to oneself and reflect. To bring harmony to the people in times of change is to harmonize. Not allowing beauty to harm life means acting without acting, not allowing the fame of beauty to harm one’s person. To possess the world yet not be involved with it—this is to say that the worthy name of the world can be possessed without shame. Their practice of the Way and virtue arises from sincerity of the center, not from seeking to raise fame and reputation. Here again, Yao and Shun are placed alongside Xu You as those who love fame.\n\nThe insatiable say: \"One must hold to one’s name, torment the body, reject sweetness, and restrain nourishment to preserve life—this is to suffer long illness and endless distress without dying.\" To know harmony is to be level; excess brings harm. There is nothing that does not follow this, but wealth is its extreme. Now, the rich man’s ears are filled with the sounds of bells, drums, pipes, and flutes; his mouth savors the taste of fine meats and rich wines, stirring his mind and causing him to neglect his proper work—this may be called disorder. Indulging in excess and drowning in surging qi, like bearing a heavy burden while climbing—this may be called suffering. Coveting wealth brings exhaustion; coveting power brings depletion. Dwelling in stillness, one drowns the body; dwelling in ease, one surges—this may be called sickness. Pursuing wealth and chasing profit, one’s ears are filled as if by a wall, yet one does not know to avoid it, surging forward without cease—this may be called disgrace. Wealth accumulates without use; one clings to it without release. The heart is filled with sorrow and vexation, seeking more without end—this may be called worry. Within, one fears the threat of robbery and extortion; without, one dreads the harm of thieves. One surrounds oneself with towers and defenses, dares not walk alone—this may be called fear. These six are the greatest harms under Heaven. All are neglected and unexamined, yet when calamity arrives, one exhausts one’s nature and depletes one’s wealth, seeking in vain to return to a single day of former ease. Thus, if one looks for fame, it cannot be seen; if one seeks profit, it cannot be obtained. Yet one wearies the mind and wears the body, contending for these—is this not delusion?\n\nThose who \"must hold to their name\" speak of those who insist on seeking fame and not the profit of wealth and honor, thus pointlessly tormenting themselves. Though they live, it is as if gravely ill—rejecting sweetness, forsaking fine flavors, restraining nourishment, and practicing frugality in self-care. \"Long illness and endless distress without dying\" is what the *Yi* calls \"steadfast illness, ever undying.\" Levelness brings fortune; excess brings harm. There is nothing that does not follow this, but wealth is its extreme. Though the wording of this passage is rough and its branches and leaves too coarse—falling short of the *Rang Wang* and *Yu Fu*—even these four lines are fine words. How can they be erased? \"The monkey’s cheek\" is called *qian*; \"stirring the mind\" means moving the intent, speaking of enslaving the heart. \"Neglecting one’s work\" is losing what one ought to do.",
      "overlap_context": "t wealth can command people—this is the meaning of 'ten thousand spirits in communion.' To desire wealth and hate poverty, to avoid poverty and seek wealth, does not require teaching—it is said: 'It does not await a teacher.' This arises from the natural nature of Heaven. Though all under Heaven may deem it wrong, how can I avoid it?\" This is the speech of the greedy, who are insatiable—thus they are named Wu Zu, the \"Insufficient One,\" and belong to the category of \"filled by mere acquisition.\"",

      "translated_text": "Fuming with qi, his qi obstructed and unable to flow freely—this is *hai*, drowning in discomfort. It is like a man carrying a heavy burden while climbing a height, seeking comfort, seeking sufficiency. \"Taking to the extreme\" means exhausting all use. As the common saying goes: \"When you have power, do not use it all.\" Living in stillness, he drowns—unable to endure idleness, he submerges himself in desires. When the body is sleek and glossy, the one who fumes is full and plump, radiant with health, swelling with arrogance and distension. \"Full as a wall\" speaks of amassing wealth until it towers like a wall—this is what is called the \"thing at the wall.\" Unaware of avoidance, insatiable, he pursues without end. *Feng* means reliance; relying on this, he boasts and cannot let go, clinging to it in his breast, thought after thought unceasing. With thought after thought unceasing, only the look of weariness and sorrow fills his chest—thus it is said, \"a heart full of sorrow, a face of distress,\" never at ease. Even so, he seeks more without cease.\n\n\"Forced taking\" means seizing by force. Those who hoard within their houses fear thieves and robbers, so they build towers and fortify their chambers, encircling their rooms. When venturing out, they fear great bandits, so they muster their retinue and dare not travel alone—guarding their windows. The towers are the structures atop the walls. These six are called: disorder, suffering, illness, disgrace, worry, and fear. \"Neglecting and failing to examine\" means losing restraint and being unaware of it. *Dan* means \"only\"; *gu* means \"matter\"; *fanfu* means \"repeatedly.\" By the time illness and affliction have taken form, even if one wishes to preserve life and relinquish wealth—seeking only to return to the carefree days of poverty—it cannot be attained. \"Exhausting one’s nature to preserve life\" means \"depleting\" and \"removing.\" One wishes to cast off wealth and return to poverty. By this point, where is one’s name? Where is one’s profit? Entangled in thought, the body bound—when contending for profit, one merely binds body and mind, only to bring about this disaster. Is this not foolish?\n\nSu Dongpo said that the four chapters following *Rang Wang* were not written by Zhuangzi. This judgment is exceedingly astute. Among these four, *Dao Zhi* is the most egregious. Yet Sima Qian’s *Biography of Zhuangzi* merely states that *Yu Fu*, *Dao Zhi*, and *Qu Qie* were written to criticize Confucius and his followers, without the slightest doubt as to the refinement or coarseness of the text, or its differences. Why is this? Could it be that Sima Qian’s intent was merely to address the disparagement of the Master, leaving no room to consider the quality of the writing? Otherwise, this book and this chapter, appearing after the Han, may have been altered by later hands due to scattered and lost texts—much like the *Liezi* of today.\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: \"Discourse on Swords\" (Chapter 30)**\n\nLong ago, King Wen of Zhao was fond of swords. Over three thousand swordsmen gathered at his gates as guests, clashing before him day and night. Each year, over a hundred died or were wounded, yet the king’s delight never waned. After three years of this, the state declined, and the feudal lords plotted against it. The crown prince, Kui, grew anxious and summoned his attendants, saying, \"Whoever can please the king and put an end to these swordsmen will be rewarded with a thousand gold pieces.\" His attendants replied, \"Zhuangzi is the one who can do this.\"\n\nThe crown prince then sent men bearing a thousand gold pieces to offer to Zhuangzi, but Zhuangzi refused to accept them. He went with the messengers to see the crown prince and said, \"What instruction does the crown prince have for me, that he would grant me a thousand gold pieces?\" The crown prince replied, \"I have heard that you are enlightened and sagely. I humbly present these thousand gold pieces as gifts for your attendants. Since you have refused them, how dare I speak further?\" Zhuangzi said, \"I have heard that the crown prince wishes to employ me to end the king’s fondness for swords. If I were to advise the king and oppose his will, and below, fail to meet the crown prince’s expectations, I would face execution and death. How then could I make use of the gold? If I were to advise the king above and meet the crown prince’s expectations below, what in the state of Zhao could I not obtain?\"\n\nThe crown prince said, \"Indeed. But my father, the king, only sees swordsmen.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"Very well. I am skilled in the way of the sword.\" The crown prince said, \"But the swordsmen my father sees all have disheveled hair, bristling whiskers, slouching caps with long tassels, short robes, glaring eyes, and speak with difficulty. The king delights in them. Now, if you were to appear before him in Confucian garb, the matter would surely go awry.\" Zhuangzi said, \"I request to prepare the attire of a swordsman.\" After three days of preparing his sword attire, he met with the crown prince, who then presented him to the king. The king drew his naked blade and awaited him.\n\nZhuangzi entered the palace hall without haste and did not bow to the king. The king said, \"What do you wish to teach me, that you have had the crown prince announce you?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"I have heard that Your Majesty is fond of swords, and so I have come to present my swordsmanship.\" The king said, \"What can your sword do to withstand and control others?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"My sword can cut down one man every ten paces and travel a thousand *li* without hindrance.\" The king was overjoyed and said, \"You would be invincible in the world!\"\n\nZhuangzi said, \"One who wields the sword shows emptiness, offers advantage, follows with action, and strikes first. I wish to demonstrate this.\" The king said, \"Sir, rest and return to your lodging. I will arrange a contest and summon you.\" The king then had the swordsmen spar for seven days, during which over sixty were killed or wounded. He selected five or six men to present their swords at the foot of the hall and then summoned Zhuangzi, saying, \"Today, I wish to see you spar with these men and test their swords.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"I have long awaited this.\"\n\nThe king said, \"Sir, what kind of weapon do you wield—long or short?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"I am prepared to wield any length. However, I possess three swords, and Your Majesty may choose which to use. Allow me to explain them before demonstrating.\" The king said, \"I wish to hear about the three swords.\" Zhuangzi replied, \"There is the sword of the Son of Heaven, the sword of the feudal lords, and the sword of the common people.\"\n\nThe king said, \"What is the sword of the Son of Heaven like?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"The sword of the Son of Heaven has its blade forged from Yanxi and Shicheng, its edge from Mount Tai of Qi, its spine from Jin and Wei, its grip from Zhou and Song, and its guard from Han and Wei. It is wrapped with the four barbarians, bound with the four seasons, encircled by the Bohai Sea, and girded by Mount Chang. It is governed by the five phases, judged by punishments and virtue, opened by yin and yang, held in spring and summer, and wielded in autumn and winter. When thrust forward, nothing stands before it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it cleaves the floating clouds; below, it severs the roots of the earth. When this sword is once employed, it rectifies the feudal lords, and the world submits. This is the sword of the Son of Heaven.\"\n\nKing Wen appeared lost in thought and said, \"What is the sword of the feudal lords like?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"The sword of the feudal lords has its blade forged from men of wisdom and courage, its edge from men of integrity and incorruptibility, its spine from men of worth and goodness, its grip from men of loyalty and sagacity, and its guard from men of valor and heroism. When thrust forward, nothing stands before it; when raised, nothing is above it; when pressed down, nothing is beneath it; when swung, nothing lies beside it. Above, it models the round heaven, following the three luminaries; below, it models the square earth, following the four seasons; within, it understands the people’s will, bringing peace to the four directions. When this sword is once employed, it is like the shock of thunder. Within the four borders, none do not submit and obey the ruler’s command. This is the sword of the feudal lords.\"\n\nThe king said, \"What is the sword of the common people like?\" Zhuangzi replied, \"The sword of the common people is wielded by men with disheveled hair, bristling whiskers, slouching caps with long tassels, short robes, glaring eyes, and harsh speech. They clash before one another, striking above at necks and throats, and below at livers and lungs. This is the sword of the common people—no different from fighting cocks. A single morning’s life may be cut short. None of these are of use to the state. Now, Your Majesty occupies the throne of the Son of Heaven yet delights in the sword of the common people. I humbly submit that this is unworthy of you.\"",

      "translated_text": "The \"three circuits\" means that without sitting, one moves in circles around the land where they would be fed—three full turns. This expresses a sense of self-reproach. \"Submission\" (服) is synonymous with \"surrender\" (伏): since the king did not employ these sword-dancers, they all withdrew and perished in the places where they dwelled.\n\n---\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Nine\n*Classics Section, Daoist Category, Zhuangzi Kouyi*\n*Imperially Commissioned Complete Library of the Four Treasuries*\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Ten\nBy Lin Xiayi of the Song Dynasty\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters: \"The Fisherman\" (Chapter Thirty-One)**\n\nConfucius wandered in the woods of the Black Curtain and rested, sitting upon the Apricot Platform. His disciples read books while Confucius strummed a zither and sang. Before the song was half-finished, a fisherman came ashore. His beard and brows were snowy white, his hair hung loose, and his sleeves swayed as he walked. Ascending from the marsh to the shore, he stopped, leaning his left hand on his knee and resting his right hand on his chin to listen. When the song ended, he beckoned to Zilu and Zigong, who both faced the guest. Pointing at Confucius, the guest asked, \"Who is that?\"\n\nZilu replied, \"A gentleman of Lu.\"\n\nThe guest inquired about his clan, and Zilu answered, \"The Kong clan.\"\n\nThe guest asked, \"What does the Kong clan govern?\"\n\nZilu did not respond, but Zigong answered, \"The Kong clan cultivates loyalty and trust in their nature, practices benevolence and righteousness in their conduct, refines ritual and music, and selects proper human relationships. Above, they are loyal to the ruler of the age; below, they transform the common people, all to benefit the world. This is what the Kong clan governs.\"\n\nThe guest asked again, \"Is he a lord with lands?\"\n\nZigong said, \"No.\"\n\n\"Is he an advisor to kings and marquises?\"\n\nZigong said, \"No.\"\n\nThe guest laughed and turned to leave, saying, \"He may be benevolent, but I fear he will not escape harm. He wearies his mind and exhausts his body, endangering his true nature. Alas, how far he has strayed from the Dao!\"\n\nZigong returned and reported to Confucius. Confucius pushed aside the zither and rose, saying, \"Is he a sage?\" He then descended to seek him by the marsh’s edge, where the fisherman was about to pole his boat away. Turning and seeing Confucius, he stood facing his village. Confucius retreated, bowed twice, and approached.\n\nThe guest said, \"What do you seek?\"\n\nConfucius replied, \"Just now, sir, you left with words unfinished. I, unworthy as I am, do not understand their meaning. I have waited humbly in your presence, hoping to hear even the sound of your cough or spittle to complete my instruction.\"\n\nThe guest said, \"Ah! How earnest is your love of learning!\"\n\nConfucius bowed twice and rose, saying, \"From my youth, I have cultivated learning, and now, at sixty-nine, I have yet to hear the ultimate teaching. How dare I not empty my heart?\"\n\nThe guest said, \"Like seeks like, and sounds resonate with their kind—this is the principle of Heaven. Let me explain what I possess and expound upon what concerns you. What concerns you is human affairs: the Son of Heaven, feudal lords, great officers, and common people—these four ranks, when properly ordered, bring the finest governance. If these four abandon their positions, no greater disorder arises. When officials manage their duties and people attend to their tasks, none overstep their bounds. Thus, fields lie fallow, homes stand exposed, clothing and food are insufficient, taxes are unpaid, wives and concubines quarrel, and elders and juniors lack order—these are the worries of the common people. Inability to fulfill duties, mismanagement of office, impure conduct, neglect of subordinates, failure to achieve merit, and loss of rank and salary—these are the worries of great officers. The court lacks loyal ministers, the state is in chaos, craftsmen lack skill, tribute is unrefined, the seasons and ranks are disordered—these are the worries of the Son of Heaven and feudal lords. Yin and yang fall out of harmony, cold and heat arrive untimely, harming the myriad things; feudal lords act violently, seizing and attacking one another, ravaging the people; ritual and music lack restraint, resources are exhausted, human relationships are unordered, and the common people are licentious—these are the worries of the Son of Heaven’s ministers.\n\nNow, you possess neither the authority of a lord or minister above nor the office of a great officer below, yet you presume to refine ritual and music, select proper human relationships, and transform the common people. Is this not excessive meddling?\n\nMoreover, people have eight flaws, and affairs have four perils—these cannot go unexamined.\n\nTo meddle in affairs not one’s own is called *zong* (officiousness).\nTo advance without regard is called *ning* (obsequiousness).\nTo speak to curry favor is called *tao* (flattery).\nTo speak without discerning right or wrong is called *fang* (recklessness).\nTo delight in speaking of others’ faults is called *chan* (slander).\nTo sever close relationships is called *zei* (treachery).\nTo praise falsely to harm others is called *te* (malice).\nTo accommodate both good and bad with a pleasing countenance, seeking to gain what one desires, is called *xian* (deviousness).\n\nThese eight flaws externally confuse others and internally harm oneself. The noble person does not befriend such people, and the enlightened ruler does not employ them.\n\nThe four perils are:\nTo love undertaking great affairs, altering constants to seek merit and fame, is called *tao* (presumptuousness).\nTo monopolize knowledge, arrogate affairs, encroach upon others, and act self-righteously is called *tan* (greed).\nTo see one’s faults yet not change, and to hear remonstrance yet grow more obstinate, is called *hen* (stubbornness).\nTo approve of those who agree with oneself and disapprove of those who disagree, even if they are good, is called *jin* (arrogance).\n\nOnly by eliminating the eight flaws and avoiding the four perils can one begin to be taught.\"\n\nThe Black Curtain was the name of the woods.",

      "translated_text": "Lifting the sleeves is called *yumei* (raising the sleeves). To select from human relationships is to choose their principles to teach others. In \"acting and speaking,\" he did not inform Zilu or Zigong but departed while acting and speaking. \"Far indeed!\"—this refers to their separation from the Dao being distant. A boat pole is called *nao*. \"Turning and running\" means retreating several steps before advancing. \"Threaded words\" are subtle words, meaning they are briefly spoken but not exhaustive. \"Finally assisting Qiu\" means that in the end, they taught and aided Qiu. \"Harmonizing in sound and responding in voice\" means that this principle is universally possessed by all people. \"Releasing what I possess\" means to let go of the Dao that I possess. \"The *Jingzi*’s *suoyi*\" refers to systematically presenting what people ought to know. \"Releasing\" means to put down without attachment. \"Systematically presenting\" means to arrange in order. The four [virtues] each correct themselves and fulfill their duties. When the four depart from their positions and encroach upon one another’s affairs, each office governs its own duties, and each person worries about their own tasks—this is called *yousi* (anxious thought). As the *Odes* says, \"In office, think of your anxieties.\" \"Thus, there is no encroachment\"—they do not overstep or seize one another. \"Taxes and levies are not continuous\"—they are not sustained. \"Meritorious beauty is not possessed\"—there is no merit. \"Not holding fast\" means being unable to maintain and guard. In the *Spring and Autumn*, the latter generations lost the order of court visits. The \"officers of the Son of Heaven\" are the Son of Heaven’s dukes and ministers. \"Engaging in affairs that are not one’s own\" is called *zong*—taking on matters that are not one’s own and forcing oneself to do them, self-aggrandizing. \"Advancing without being heeded\"—not allowing them to speak yet forcing their words forward, flaunting eloquence. \"Flattery\" refers to eloquence. \"Dissolving and separating others’ close relationships\" is to harm them treacherously. \"Praising with falsehood\" is to praise what should not be praised, privately deceiving. \"Ruining and shaming\" is like disgracing—disparaging what should not be disparaged. Praise and blame arising from private motives are merely villainy—concealing wickedness. \"Adapting one’s countenance to others’ preferences\" is called *yan shi*—whether good or bad, one desires to please them, hence \"two-faced.\" Discerning others’ desires and subtly promoting them to amplify their faults—this is a treacherous person. The \"eight flaws\" refer to these eight as major defects; the noble person does not befriend them, and the enlightened ruler does not employ them. \"Loving to undertake great affairs\" is to delight in managing the state’s major matters. \"Altering and changing to seek merit and fame\" is to change constant laws in order to establish lofty achievements—this is called *tao* (presumptuousness). \"Monopolizing knowledge and arrogating affairs\" is to rely on private wisdom, exclusively control matters, encroach upon others’ authority, and delight in self-reliance—this is called *tan* (greed). \"Stubborn\" means obstinacy and refusal to accept remonstrance. \"Even if others are good, if they disagree with oneself, one deems them not good\"—this is called *jin* (arrogance). These four are humanity’s great perils. Only by eliminating these flaws and perils can one begin to learn the Dao, hence \"only then can one be taught.\" All these are what you, Master, should employ in the world, hence \"the *suoyi* of you, Master\"—to use them for self-examination and defense.\n\nConfucius sighed deeply, bowed twice, and rose, saying, \"I, Qiu, was twice exiled from Lu, had my traces erased in Wei, had my tree felled in Song, and was besieged in Chen and Cai. I do not know what faults I committed to incur these four slanders. Why?\" The guest’s expression turned mournful as he said, \"How difficult it is for you to awaken! There was a man who feared his shadow and hated his footprints, so he ran to escape them. The more he lifted his feet, the more footprints there were; the faster he ran, the more his shadow clung to him. Believing he was still too slow, he ran without rest, exhausted his strength, and died—unaware that if he had stood in the shade, his shadow would have vanished, and if he had rested in stillness, his footprints would have ceased. How foolish! You scrutinize the boundaries between benevolence and righteousness, examine the distinctions between sameness and difference, observe the changes of activity and stillness, measure the degrees of giving and receiving, discern the principles of likes and dislikes, and harmonize the moderation of joy and anger—yet you nearly could not avoid [these slanders]. If you carefully cultivate yourself, guard your true nature, and return things to others, you will have no burdens. Now, you do not cultivate yourself but seek from others—is this not misplaced?\"\n\n\"Not knowing what faults\" means not knowing what transgressions. The \"four slanders\" are the four humiliations in Lu, Wei, Song, Chen, and Cai. \"Standing in the shade\" and \"resting in stillness\" are metaphors for the Dao. \"Scrutinizing the boundaries between benevolence and righteousness\" means distinguishing the different principles of benevolence and righteousness. \"The distinctions between sameness and difference\" refer to the divisions of right and wrong. \"The changes of activity and stillness\" mean adapting to the times. \"The degrees of giving and receiving\" refer to the moderation of speech and acceptance. \"The principles of likes and dislikes\" and \"the moderation of joy and anger\" clarify the principles of human nature. The Fisherman’s intent is that your, Master, actions are all for others, not for yourself, which is why you could not avoid the four slanders. If you cultivate yourself and guard your original true nature, following the natural Dao without opposition between self and others, you will have no burdens. \"Returning things to others\" means returning external things to others and unifying them with nature, so that self and others do not oppose one another. Now, you do not seek within yourself but are eager to act for others—this is attending to externals rather than internals.\n\nConfucius’s expression turned solemn as he said, \"May I ask what is meant by 'true'?\" The guest replied, \"Truth is the utmost of sincerity. Without sincerity, one cannot move others. Thus, forced weeping, though sorrowful, is not mournful; forced anger, though stern, is not awe-inspiring; forced affection, though smiling, is not harmonious. True sorrow is silent yet mournful; true anger is unexpressed yet awe-inspiring; true affection is unsmiling yet harmonious. When truth is within, the spirit moves without—this is why truth is valued. Applied to human principles: serving parents with filial piety, serving the ruler with loyalty, drinking with joy, and mourning with grief. Loyalty is based on achievement, drinking on pleasure, mourning on sorrow, and serving parents on comfort. The beauty of achievement leaves no single trace. Serving parents with comfort does not inquire into the means; drinking with joy does not select the vessels; mourning with grief does not question the rites. Rites are what the world’s customs create; truth is what one receives from Heaven. It is natural and unchangeable. Thus, the sage models Heaven and values truth, not constrained by custom. The foolish do the opposite: they cannot model Heaven but worry about people, do not value truth, and meekly conform to custom—how pitiful! You, Master, were early immersed in human artifice and late in hearing the great Dao.\"\n\n\"Not moving others without sincerity\" echoes the idea of utmost sincerity moving even spirits. \"Forced weeping,\" \"forced anger,\" and \"forced affection,\" along with \"true sorrow,\" \"true anger,\" and \"true affection\"—these six phrases are extremely precise. \"When truth is within, the spirit moves without\" means that what is within must manifest without; the spirit moving refers to the spirit being stirred externally.",

      "translated_text": "To serve one’s parents with what suits them is to suit their wishes. The beauty of a task’s completion lies in leaving no trace—having accomplished it yet claiming no ownership, having done nothing that leaves a mark. \"Not selecting the provisions\" means not choosing the flavors. \"Without questioning their rites or their ease\" refers to Ning Qi.\n\nRites are external embellishments, hence called \"what the world and custom create.\" Truth is the principle of Heaven’s mandate and naturalness. To \"model Heaven and value truth without being constrained by custom\" is not to be bound by what the world and custom favor. \"Worrying about people\" means fretting over not conforming to others. Not knowing the nobility of Heaven’s rank, they do not value truth, taking the emoluments of custom as their reward and willingly being transformed by the common tide—hence \"meekly conforming to custom and being altered by it.\" Such people are always seen as unworthy, ever lacking.\n\n\"Immersed in human artifice\" means drowning in learning that pursues externals. Confucius again bowed twice and rose, saying: \"Today, I, Qiu, have had this encounter—how fortunate, as if Heaven had willed it! That you, Master, do not disdain to compare me to a servant and personally instruct me—dare I ask where you reside? I would follow to receive your teachings and complete my study of the great Dao.\"\n\nThe guest replied: \"I have heard that those who can be led may be taken to the subtle Dao; those who cannot be led do not understand the Way. Be cautious not to accompany them, lest you bring harm upon yourself. Strive on! I leave you now. I leave you now.\" Then he poled his boat away, gliding along the reeds.\n\nYan Yuan turned the carriage, and Zilu handed the strap to Confucius. Confucius did not look back, waiting until the water’s ripples stilled and the sound of the pole could no longer be heard before daring to board. Zilu stood beside the carriage and asked: \"I, You, have served you for a long time, yet never have I seen you, Master, encounter someone with such awe. Kings of ten thousand chariots and lords of a thousand chariots, when they meet you, never fail to accord you equal standing and courtesy. Yet you still bear a haughty demeanor. Now, this old fisherman, leaning on his staff, stood facing you, and you bent at the waist, bowed repeatedly, and responded—was this not excessive? All your disciples find it strange. How could this fisherman deserve such treatment?\"\n\nConfucius leaned on the crossbar and sighed: \"How difficult it is to transform you, You! You have been steeped in ritual and propriety for some time, yet your coarse and vulgar heart remains unchanged to this day. Let me tell you: to meet an elder without respect is to lack propriety; to meet a worthy without reverence is to lack benevolence. If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself. Without utmost sincerity, one cannot attain his truth. Thus, he would long harm his person. Alas! Nothing brings greater misfortune to a person than lacking benevolence—and you alone excel at it!\n\nThe Dao is the path by which all things proceed. Those who lose it die; those who attain it live. In affairs, opposing it brings failure; following it brings success. Thus, wherever the Dao resides, the sage honors it.

      "translated_text": "Leaving his place to inquire after the elder’s dwelling, he followed along the reeds, using his oar to push the boat away from the shore—these four characters depict the scene with a painter’s brush. The water’s ripples stilled as the boat drifted into the distance. Such was his awe: to stand facing him in opposition, to bow in response, hands clasped in reverence.\n\n\"To be steeped in ritual and propriety for some time\" means you have long been immersed in the study of rites and virtue. \"If he were not a perfected person, he could not humble himself\" signifies that had the old fisherman not been a perfected one, how could he have compelled such deference and reverence? \"Without utmost sincerity, one cannot attain his truth\" means that only by humbling oneself with perfect sincerity to seek instruction can one hope to receive true teaching. This line is the foundation of learning. \"Thus, he would long harm his person\" warns that without such an approach, one gains no benefit and only harms oneself. The life and death of all things lie within the single Dao—the old fisherman possessed the Dao. I revere his Dao, and thus I honor him.\n\nFrom \"Yielding the Throne\" onward, the four chapters differ in style from *Zhuangzi*’s own work. Even in \"Yielding the Throne,\" there remain one or two passages of merit, while the \"Fisherman\" chapter also has its strengths. The \"Robber Zhi\" chapter, however, is even cruder and more blunt than \"The Old Fisherman.\" According to the \"Robber Zhi\" chapter, the term \"prime minister\" did not exist in the Warring States period—this is clearly a later fabrication. The *Han shu*’s \"Treatise on Arts and Letters\" records fifty-two chapters of *Zhuangzi*, a number differing from the present text. The *Tang shu* lists only forty chapters, which correspond to the version now in circulation. It is unclear whether the fifty-two chapters included \"Yielding the Throne,\" \"The Old Fisherman,\" and the like, or if there were other chapters by Zhuangzi that have since been lost.\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters, \"Lie Yukou\" (Chapter 32):**\nLie Yukou was traveling to Qi when he turned back midway. He encountered Bohun Wuren, who asked, \"Why have you returned?\"\n\"I was alarmed,\" Lie Yukou replied.\n\"By what?\"\n\"I once dined at ten millet-sellers’ stalls, and at five of them, they served me first.\"\nBohun Wuren said, \"If that is so, why were you alarmed?\"\nLie Yukou answered, \"When inner sincerity is not dissolved, one’s outward demeanor shines with a radiance that overawes others, making them defer to one’s age and overlook their own concerns. Those millet-sellers merely sell gruel for profit, seeking surplus gain and slight advantage. If even they were so affected, how much more would a lord of ten thousand chariots be?\"",

Bohun Wuren stood facing north, leaning on his staff, his chin nearly touching it. After a while, he said nothing and left. The attendant reported this to Liezi. Liezi, barefoot and carrying his shoes, ran to the gate and said, \"Since you have come, Master, why not offer a remedy?\"\n\nBohun Wuren replied, \"It is done. I had already told you that others would cherish you, and indeed they do. It is not that you can make others cherish you, but that you cannot prevent them from doing so. Why then do you let this move you, producing such a strange response? You will surely be stirred by external things, yet your fundamental nature remains unchanged—what is the point? Among those you associate with, none will tell you this. Their petty words are all poison to men. None awaken, none comprehend—how can they scrutinize one another? The cunning toil, the wise worry, the incapable seek nothing. Sated with food, they roam freely, drifting like an untethered boat, empty and wandering. Why turn back midway? What words did you leave behind? At ten millet-sellers’ stalls, five served you first without waiting for payment.

      "translated_text": "In ancient times, this was called \"the punishment of fleeing from Heaven\"—moaning and chanting in song. \"Only three years\" means exactly three years. \"The river moistens nine *li*\" is a metaphor for the breadth of one’s influence reaching others. With his remaining resources, he enabled his younger brother to study Mohism. Huan became a Confucian, while his brother Di became a Mohist. As their teachings differed, debates arose. Their father, loving his younger son, sided with Di. Huan, resenting his father, killed himself. In a dream, his father appeared to him, saying, \"Had I provided for your brother to become a Mohist, it would have been my remaining virtue.\"\n\nNow, brothers had already quarreled and killed themselves, yet the pines and cypresses on my grave have already borne fruit—speaking of how long he has been dead. *Liang* (良) may also be written as *yin* (垠), pronounced like *langmeng* (浪蒙). \"Why did Huan examine his *liang*?\" means, \"Why did he not see my obscurity?\" *He* (阖) and *hu* (胡) both mean \"why.\" Citing this old story, Zhuangzi then concluded: Huan believed that had his brother become a Mohist, it would have been because of him, not knowing that the Creator’s retribution for a person does not respond to human ability but to what that person has received from Heaven. Had his brother studied Mohism and mastered it, it would have been the Creator responding to his Heavenly endowment—not because of Huan’s human effort in providing for him.\n\nThus, the Creator (the first *bi* 彼) caused him (the second *bi* 彼, referring to Di) to regard himself (this *fu ren* 夫人, referring to Huan) as special, distinct from others—believing his Confucian learning and influence reaching three clans made him superior—and to despise his kin, resenting his father. It was Heaven that enabled Di to master Mohism, yet Huan took credit and resented his father, not understanding Heaven. A wellspring flows naturally; the people of Qi, drawing from the same natural water, fought one another over it. Was this water their private possession? Their perception was the same as Huan’s. People of this age all fail to understand Heaven and contend with private intentions. Thus, it is said: in this age, all are Huan.\n\nObserve how, from \"Thus, it caused that man\" to \"would fight one another,\" the language is Zhuangzi’s own. In the *Rang Wang* and subsequent four chapters, how could such words appear? Those with virtue still regard the Creator as unknowable—how much more so those with the Dao?\n\nZhuangzi’s words often imply that beyond one layer lies another, distinguishing between those with the Dao and those with virtue. \"Fleeing from Heaven\" means abandoning Heavenly principle; \"punishment\" means offending the Creator. This sentence rebukes Huan’s kind.\n\nThe sage finds peace in what is naturally peaceful and does not seek peace in what is not. The multitude finds peace in what is not naturally peaceful and does not find peace in what is. Zhuangzi said: Knowing the Dao is easy; not speaking of it is difficult. To know and not speak is to align with Heaven. To know and speak is to align with man. The ancients aligned with Heaven, not man. What is naturally peaceful is Heavenly principle; what is not is human artifice. \"Not speaking is difficult\" means it is hard to forget words. To know the Dao and forget words is to follow Heaven. To know the Dao yet still rely on words is not yet free from human artifice—traces remain. The ancients were purely of Heaven, not man.\n\n*Zhi* (之) means \"to go.\" \"To align with Heaven\" means to return to Heaven; \"to align with man\" means to return to man.\n\nZhu Pingman studied dragon-slaying from Zhi Liyi, exhausting a family’s thousand gold. After three years, his skill was perfected, yet there was no dragon to slay. This is meant to illustrate that Zhuangzi’s Dao is vast but has no place to be applied.\n\nThe sage treats the inevitable as inevitable, hence has no weapons. The multitude treats the inevitable as not inevitable, hence has many weapons. To follow the way of weapons is to act with intent; relying on weapons leads to destruction. The \"inevitable\" is the unknowable. To treat the unknowable as inevitable is to claim knowledge of the unknown. Having no weapons means no conflict. The multitude treats the unknowable as knowable, hence much contention. War is the greatest form of conflict, so it is used as the prime example. If one follows the heart of contention, then in conduct one always seeks an enemy—unable to forget the distinction between self and others. Thus, it is said: to follow the way of weapons is to act with intent. To rely on the contention of knowledge and strength will inevitably lead to self-destruction. Thus, it is said: relying on weapons leads to destruction.\n\nThe knowledge of petty men does not extend beyond bribes and letters, yet they exhaust their spirit in trivial, shallow matters, seeking to govern all things and guide the myriad beings toward the Great Unity and formless emptiness. How could this be possible? \"Formless emptiness\" means formlessness. With such limited perception, they are confused by the universe—space above and below, time past and present—unaware that they are bound by form and do not comprehend the principle of the Great Beginning. Only the perfected person returns their spirit to the beginning of nothingness and delights in dwelling in the realm of non-existence. *Gan* (甘) means \"delight\"; *min* (瞑) means \"sleep.\" The delight of sleep is a metaphor for peaceful dwelling.\n\nWater flows without form, disperses into the Great Purity. Alas! Your knowledge clings to the finest hair yet does not know the Great Peace. Water flows, and all see its form, not knowing it arises from the formless—speaking of its origin in nothingness. When it disperses and departs, people again do not know it returns to the Great Purity. The Great Purity is the Great Void. This is meant to show that ordinary people do not understand the beginning and end of things, just as they observe water. Thus, it is said: \"Your knowledge clings to the finest hair\"—speaking of how small their perception is. The Great Peace is the principle of non-action and naturalness. \"Alas!\" precedes \"you,\" lamenting their limited vision.\n\nThere was a man of Song named Cao Shang who was sent by the King of Song as an envoy to Qin. On his journey, he obtained several chariots. Pleased, the King of Qin added a hundred chariots. Returning to Song, he saw Zhuangzi and said: \"To dwell in a poor alley, a narrow lane, in hardship—weaving sandals, with a withered neck and yellowed face—this is what I am not good at. To awaken the lord of ten thousand chariots and follow with a hundred chariots—this is what I excel at.\"\n\nZhuangzi said: \"The King of Qin had an illness and summoned physicians. Those who lanced boils and drained abscesses received one chariot; those who licked hemorrhoids received five chariots. The lower the treatment, the more chariots they received. Did you perhaps treat his hemorrhoids? How else could you have obtained so many chariots? Be gone!\"",

      "translated_text": "The governance is difficult—when bestowed upon others yet not forgotten, it is not the Heavenly Distribution. Merchants are held in contempt; even if one engages with them in matters, the spirits within do not acknowledge them. Those who impose external punishments wield metal and wood; those who inflict internal punishments act through movement and transgression. The petty man who incurs external punishment is interrogated by metal and wood; he who incurs internal punishment is consumed by yin and yang. Only the true person can escape both internal and external punishments. The people may be governed without governance—if one governs with intent, then governance becomes difficult. Thus it is said, \"difficult to govern.\" To bestow upon others yet not forget is to govern with intent. *Shi* means to administer; *bu* means to display. The Heavenly Distribution is the Heavenly Principle. To administer governance and instruction with intent is not the Heavenly Principle. It is like merchants: if one of them were to become a scholar, others would surely refuse to rank with him. Even if, by chance, they were to gather and stand in ranks, the spirits within their hearts would still feel displeasure. Likewise, the man of Dao would refuse to rank with those who act with intent. This analogy of merchants illustrates those who study benevolence and righteousness. External punishments are the knife and cangue; internal punishments are movement and transgression—meaning the actions and faults of the human body are akin to punishments. *Xun* means to interrogate; to be consumed by yin and yang is to suffer the reproach of creation. *Shi* means to eclipse, as in an eclipse of the sun, or to afflict, as in illness. The phrase on external punishments is a physical analogy for the following line. *Li* means to adhere.\n\nConfucius said: \"The human heart is more treacherous than mountains and rivers, harder to know than Heaven. Heaven at least has its seasons—spring, autumn, winter, summer—and its times—dawn and dusk. But humans have thick appearances and deep emotions. Thus, some appear sincere yet seek profit; some harbor great ability yet do not show it; some are unworthy yet seem so. There are those who are gentle and compliant yet discerning; those who seem firm yet are weak and entangled; those who appear relaxed yet are narrow and hasty. Therefore, those who rush toward righteousness as if parched may flee from it as if scorched. Thus, the noble person sends them far to observe their loyalty, brings them near to observe their respect, assigns them tasks to observe their ability, questions them suddenly to observe their wisdom, sets urgent deadlines to observe their trustworthiness, entrusts them with wealth to observe their benevolence, warns them of danger to observe their integrity, intoxicates them with wine to observe their composure, and mixes them in company to observe their demeanor. Through these nine tests, the unworthy are revealed.\n\n*Thick appearances and deep emotions* refer to deceptive appearances and hidden motives, difficult to perceive and fathom. Some appear simple and sincere yet inwardly seek profit; some conceal their strengths behind an unassuming exterior—such is the unworthy who does not seem so. There are those who are gentle and compliant yet discerning; those who seem firm yet are weak and entangled—*man* means entangled, as in the *Book of Songs*: \"Once a hundred links of steel, now soft as a coil around the finger.\" *Han* means urgency; some appear relaxed yet are narrow and hasty. All these illustrate the unknowability of people. *Those who rush toward righteousness as if parched* describes their eager advance; *those who flee from it as if scorched* describes their swift retreat. This single line—eager advance and swift retreat—is extraordinary. Those far away are easily deceived, so observe their loyalty from afar; those near are prone to negligence, so observe their respect up close. Overwhelming tasks test ability, sudden questions reveal wisdom, urgent deadlines test trustworthiness, entrusted wealth reveals benevolence—this *benevolence* aligns with the Dao. Danger tests integrity, wine tests composure—*ze* means propriety. Mixed company tests self-restraint—*se* means demeanor. *Zheng* means verification. Through these nine tests, the worthy and unworthy become clear.",

It says: if you take him for worthy and support him, it will bring you no benefit—you will surely be misled by him. ‘Those who err and delude ourselves’ means that error may yet be admitted.\n\n‘Now, to cause the people to abandon substance and learn falsity’—this is no way to instruct them. ‘To guide’ means to teach and show. ‘Considering posterity, it would be better to cease this’—it would be better to abandon it altogether.\"",

      "translated_text": "This passage presents a most proper discourse, yet it is attributed to the words of Confucius—from which we may know that Zhuangzi was not without reverence for him. When Zheng Kaofu received his first appointment, he bent his back; at the second, he bent his waist; at the third, he stooped low, creeping along the wall—who would dare not take him as a model? As for that man: at his first appointment, he strutted like Lü Ju; at the second, he danced atop his carriage; at the third, he called his elders by name—who could compare him to Yao and Xu? *Yu* means a hunched back; *lou*, a bent waist; *fu*, a body bowed to the ground. This speaks of how the higher the rank, the lower the posture. Creeping along the wall, not daring to walk the main path—this is humility. If the world had such a worthy man, who would not take him as a model? *Fa* means a model. *Er fu* refers to that man. *Lü Ju* describes an air of arrogance. Dancing atop the carriage speaks of frivolous flaunting. Calling elders by name shows contempt for his clan, addressing uncles and brothers by their given names. Yao offered the world to Xu You, who refused—yet such petty men, upon gaining the slightest advantage, become as haughty as this. How could they know of Yao and Xu You’s deeds? *Xie* means to compare. If we compare ourselves to Yao and Xu You, the difference in weight becomes clear. *Shu xie* asks: who else could be compared in this way?\n\nNo thief is greater than a virtue that has a heart, and a heart that has an eye. When it has an eye, it turns inward—and in turning inward, it fails. These few lines strike most intimately at the heart of those who study the Way. What Chan Buddhists call the \"leaking mind\" or \"the second thought\" expresses this same idea. *De* is virtue. To practice virtue while being aware that one is practicing virtue is to have a heart—this is the greatest harm to those who study the Way. Thus it is said: no thief is greater than a virtue that has a heart. Within this heart, if there is also the intention to calculate and scheme—it is as if the heart has opened another eye. This is called \"leaking\" or \"the second thought.\" With this eye-opened heart turned inward, a thousand differences and ten thousand distinctions arise, chaotic and disorderly, no longer knowing the undifferentiated whole. Then there is no way to accomplish the Way. Thus it is said: *bai*—failure, incompletion.\n\nThere are five baleful virtues, with the \"inner virtue\" as their chief. What is the \"inner virtue\"? It is the virtue of self-satisfaction, which reviles what it does not do. The five baleful virtues are the heart, ears, eyes, nose, and mouth—with the heart as the \"inner virtue.\" This means the harm of the ears, eyes, nose, and mouth is not as great as the harm within the heart. Thus it is said: the \"inner virtue\" is chief. *You yi zi hao* means \"to take pride in one’s own abilities.\" *Pi* means to revile or ridicule. To ridicule others for what they cannot do with one’s own abilities—such a heart cannot study the Way. The *Yuanjue Jing* says: \"Do not value long practice nor belittle the beginner.\" Dahui said: \"Above all, do not think, ‘I guard against this, but he does not’\"—this is the same idea.\n\nPoverty has eight extremes, while attainment has three necessities. The body has six repositories. Handsome whiskers, tall stature, robust build, and striking beauty—coupled with courage and boldness—these eight surpass others. Yet relying on these leads to poverty. Following, slouching, and cowardice—fearing to be inferior to others—these three lead to attainment. Wisdom that is outwardly expressed, courage that breeds resentment, and benevolence that imposes demands—these are the conditions of a life that attains. Those who attain through knowledge are but semblances; those who attain the great mandate follow it; those who attain the lesser mandate encounter it.\n\nPoverty has eight extremes: it speaks of those who rely on something and thus inevitably fall into poverty. Attainment has three necessities: it speaks of those who are modest and lacking, yet at times must attain. *Mei* means beauty of appearance. *Ran* refers to the beard. As Fang Xuanling said of Li Wei: \"He had fine whiskers.\" *Chang* means tall stature. *Da* means a large waist.",

      "translated_text": "Strength denotes physical power; *li* denotes splendor and brilliance; courage denotes abundant *qi*; daring denotes firm resolve. These are called the eight extremes—speaking of how these eight qualities all surpass others. Yet those who rely on them inevitably meet with poverty in the end.\n\n*Yuánxún* means compliance and gentleness, acting only when unavoidable; *yǎnyǎng* means rising after every fall; *kùnwèi* means distress and fear from hardship. These three, though inferior to others, must lead to attainment—speaking of how those who do not compete with the world are inevitably favored by others.\n\nThis is all Zhuangzi’s argument for correcting arrogance. *Xíng yǒu liù fǔ* speaks of the six repositories within the human body. *Fǔ* is the place where things are stored. Wisdom is one repository—those who \"outwardly express\" use their wisdom externally to seek attainment. Courage is one repository—those who rely on strength inevitably breed resentment. Benevolence is one repository—those who seek fame through benevolence and righteousness inevitably face many demands. *Kuǐ* (attainment of life) is one repository—those who attain the principle of life must appear *kuǐ* (grand) in their self-regard. Attainment of knowledge is one repository—those who attain the insights of the multitude must scrutinize every matter. Attainment of the mandate is one repository—what lies with Heaven is great, what lies with oneself is small. Those who attain what lies with Heaven follow and yield to nature; those who attain what lies with themselves accept whatever they encounter as fate. The latter still involves gain and loss, a mind that resigns itself to fate; the former has no mind at all. These two are distinct in their divisions.\n\nThe final character *mìng* (mandate) should be parsed into two phrases—this is also a matter of literary structure.\n\nThere was a man who had an audience with the King of Song and was granted ten chariots. With these ten chariots, he grew arrogant and childish. Zhuangzi said: \"By the riverside lived a poor family who made their living weaving rushes. Their son dived into a deep pool and found a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces. His father said to him, 'Bring a stone and smash it!' For a pearl worth a thousand gold pieces must lie in the ninefold depths beneath the chin of a black dragon. That you could obtain it means you must have encountered its slumber. Had the black dragon been awake, what scrap of you would remain? Now, the depths of the state of Song are not merely a ninefold abyss, and the ferocity of the King of Song is not merely that of a black dragon. That you could obtain those chariots means you must have encountered his slumber. Had the King of Song been awake, you would have been ground to powder.\"\n\n*Jiāozhì* means arrogance and childishness—this is Zhuangzi’s intent. *Wěi* means weaving; *xiāo* are reeds—relying on these for sustenance, making them one’s trade. \"Bring a stone and smash it\" means to despise the pearl and destroy it. This analogy speaks of those who seek wealth and honor—all tread perilous paths, all deceive their rulers. If their ruler awakens, they will inevitably face execution; what scrap of them would remain?\n\nSomeone came to invite Zhuangzi, and Zhuangzi replied to the messenger: \"Have you seen the sacrificial ox? It is clothed in embroidered silk and fed with fine grain and beans. Yet when it is led into the great temple, though it might wish to be a solitary calf, can it still do so?\" This carries the same meaning as the earlier passage about the tortoise dragging its tail in the mud.\n\nWhen Zhuangzi was about to die, his disciples wished to give him a lavish burial. Zhuangzi said: \"I take heaven and earth as my coffin and outer coffin, the sun and moon as my paired jades, the stars and constellations as my pearls and jades, the myriad things as my funeral gifts—are not my burial furnishings already complete? What could be added to them?\" His disciples said: \"We fear that crows and kites will eat you.\" Zhuangzi said: \"Above, I would be eaten by crows and kites; below, by mole crickets and ants. To snatch from one to give to the other—how partial is that!\" This analogy mocks those in the world who practice lavish burials, robbing crows and kites to give to mole crickets and ants. Though his words may seem excessive, those who truly attain the Dao cannot easily match them.\n\nTo level the level with the unlevel is not level; to verify the verifiable with the unverifiable is not verifiable. The enlightened act as agents, while the spiritual verify. That the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritual has long been so. Yet fools rely on their own perceptions to intrude upon others, seeking merit externally—is this not lamentable?\n\nThe principles of the myriad things are inherently level. If I use an unlevel mind to level what is already level, then what was level becomes unlevel. The principles of the myriad things are each verifiable. If I use an unverifiable mind to verify them, then what was verifiable also becomes unverifiable. Thus it is said: \"To level the level with the unlevel is not level; to verify the verifiable with the unverifiable is not verifiable.\" Verification means that nothing is done, yet things are made to act as if by agency—this is to turn a mindless state into one with intent. The self-entanglement of the enlightened often takes this form. As for the spiritual, it simply allows things to respond naturally.\n\nThat the enlightened cannot surpass the spiritual speaks of how human effort cannot surpass effortlessness. Fools rely on their private views to intrude upon others, constantly seeking merit externally—is this not lamentable?\n\n**Miscellaneous Chapters, \"The World\" (Chapter Thirty-Three)**\n\nThe world’s governance and methods of the Dao are many.",

      "translated_text": "All regard their efforts as unsurpassable. Where, then, does the Dao-arts of antiquity truly lie? Does it reside in \"nothingness\"? No—then how does the numinous descend? How does illumination emerge? The sage is born, the king achieves success, all originating from the One, never departing from the Source—this is called the Heavenly Person. Never departing from essence—this is called the Spirit Person. Never departing from the real—this is called the Perfect Person. Taking Heaven as their source, virtue as their root, and the Dao as their gate, they presage transformation and change—this is called the sage. Taking benevolence as kindness, righteousness as principle, ritual as conduct, and music as harmony, they radiate compassion and kindness—this is called the noble person. Taking law as distinction, names as outward signs, conduct as verification, and investigation as decision, their reckoning follows one, two, three, four—thus do the hundred officials rank one another. Taking affairs as constant, clothing and food as primary, and the flourishing, storing, aging, weak, orphaned, and widowed as their concern, all possess the principles of nurturing the people.\n\nWere the people of antiquity not complete? They matched the divine luminaries, harmonized with Heaven and Earth, nourished the myriad things, brought harmony to the world, and bestowed blessings upon the hundred clans. They were clear about fundamental reckoning and bound to its branches, their measures sixfold in penetration and fourfold in openness. Whether small or great, refined or coarse, their operation was without limit—yet not in their illumination, but in their reckoning and measures. The old methods transmitted by the scribes of former ages still abound. As for those found in the *Odes*, *Documents*, *Rites*, and *Music*, the scholars of Zou and Lu, the girdled masters, are largely able to clarify them. The *Odes* guide the will, the *Documents* guide affairs, the *Rites* guide conduct, the *Music* guides harmony, the *Changes* guide yin and yang, and the *Spring and Autumn* guide names and distinctions. Their reckoning disperses throughout the world and is established in the Central States, forming the hundred schools’ teachings. At times, these are praised and followed, yet the world remains in great disorder. The worthy and sagely are unclear, the Dao and virtue are not unified, and the world seizes upon a single insight to cherish as its own. Like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each has its own clarity but cannot communicate with one another—so too are the hundred schools’ many arts.",

      "translated_text": "All possess their strengths and find their uses at times, yet none is comprehensive or all-encompassing—each is but a partial scholar. They judge the beauty of Heaven and Earth, analyze the principles of the myriad things, and examine the completeness of the ancients, yet few can fully embody the beauty of Heaven and Earth or match the countenance of spirit and illumination. Thus, the Way of inner sageliness and outer kingship remains obscured and unmanifest, pent-up and unexpressed. The people of the world each pursue what they desire, fashioning their own methods. Alas! The hundred schools have gone forth and do not return—they will surely never reunite. Later scholars, unfortunate in not witnessing the purity of Heaven and Earth or the great essence of the ancients, will see the Dao and its arts torn asunder by the world.\n\nIn the closing chapters, Zhuangzi’s preface on the learning of past and present is akin to the concluding insights of Mencius—both speak of knowledge and perception. Since those who govern the world through methods and techniques are many, the Dao and its arts are on the verge of being rent by the world. This is clearly the overture: having first summarized the schools, he then proceeds to discuss them by their respective categories. While his book places itself among these schools, the learning of Zou and Lu is expounded within the general preface. Thus, this elder’s intent is evident: though his writings are all impassioned and one-sided, he never fails to recognize the orthodox teachings of the Sage’s gate. Reading his general preface, one sees that his learning is fundamentally quite proper. As Su Dongpo observed, Zhuangzi never disparaged the Master—he, too, discerned the distinction between methods and true learning.\n\nEach person deems their own learning beyond reproach, each considers themselves correct. What, then, is the so-called *Dao-art*? Where does it reside? It does not lie apart—it carries the meaning of being within the mean. Though the hundred schools’ teachings differ, the Dao is never absent from them. How could spirit descend? How could illumination emerge? How could the Way of spirit and illumination be made visible? The creative and transformative work of sagely kings is none other than the principle of Heaven and Earth’s generation—all originate from the One, the work of creation. Terms like *zong* (ancestry), *jing* (essence), and *zhen* (authenticity) are synonymous with the One, merely stylistic variations in writing.\n\nTo take Heaven as one’s ancestry, virtue as one’s root, and the Dao as one’s gate—all are non-action and spontaneity. Originating in transformation, they ultimately return to the One. The sage is the Heavenly person, the perfected person, the spirit person. Their bearing is warmly benevolent—this describes their demeanor. There are distinctions in standards, hence “taking standards as divisions”; there are criteria in names, hence “taking names as markers.” Conduct serves as verification, investigation as decision—each has its basis. The reckoning of one, two, three, four speaks to meticulous clarity and completeness. Those ranked by seniority observe order in size and precedence. Taking affairs as constant means each has its regular duties. Taking clothing and food as primary means teaching the people agriculture and sericulture. Propagation and storage—like the principle of three years’ tilling for one year’s sustenance—are examples of this. Prioritizing the old, weak, orphaned, and widowed means that in enacting governance and bestowing benevolence, these four must come first. All their divisions of offices, arrangements of duties, governance, and instruction are principles for nurturing the people.\n\nThe ancients—were they not complete? This speaks of the ancient sages’ ability to fulfill them. They could match spirit and illumination, harmonize with Heaven and Earth—this is pure harmony. Nurturing the myriad things and harmonizing the world, their beneficence extended to all people. This describes the vastness of their efficacy. *Ben-shu* and *mo-du* mean the refined and the coarse, the root and the branch. *Xi* conveys the idea of interconnection—root and branch are inseparable. *Liu-tong si-bi* speaks of the six directions (east, west, south, north, above, below), usable without exception. *Yun* is the Dao; the Dao’s operation encompasses the great and small, the refined and coarse—all are the Dao.",

At times, these are praised and followed, yet the world remains in great disorder. The worthy and sagely are unclear, the Dao and virtue are not unified, and the world seizes upon a single insight to cherish as its own. Like the ear, eye, nose, and mouth, each has its own clarity but cannot communicate with one another—so too are the hundred schools’ many arts.",

      "translated_text": "Thus it is said: there is nowhere it is not present. In these several phrases, the substance and function of the Dao have never been unclear. *Shu-du* refers to what can be recorded in measures and standards—speaking of its laws and regulations, evident and traceable, all of which are the old models transmitted through generations in historical texts. There are still many such records, all documenting these matters. The scholars of Zou and Lu, the gentry and masters—here referring to the sagely lineage—make this perfectly clear. In Confucius’ *Six Classics* and the *Spring and Autumn*, the *ming-fen* (proper names and duties) already contain the intent to deter rebellious ministers and traitorous sons. These principles spread throughout the world, meaning that Zou and Lu preserved their entirety, while their teachings dispersed across the land, branching into a hundred schools in China. There were also occasional references to these matters, but none could match the completeness of the learning of Zou and Lu.\n\nThe great chaos of the world refers to the period after the *Spring and Autumn*. The worthy and sagely were no longer manifest; above, there were no kings like Wen and Wu or the Duke of Zhou, and below, no disciples like Confucius and Yan Hui. The Dao and virtue were not unified but scattered into a hundred schools. \"The world gains much\" means that people of the world grasped one aspect and examined it, taking pride in it—observing only one facet and boasting of their own excellence. The ear, eye, nose, and mouth cannot interchange functions: the ear cannot see, the eye cannot hear, the mouth cannot smell, the nose cannot taste; each follows its own capacity. Thus it is said: each has its own clarity. This analogy illustrates that the hundred schools and various arts each have their strengths and may at times be useful, but none can fully encompass the comprehensive Way of the sage, and so they remain partial and one-sided scholars.\n\nThe beauty of Heaven and Earth is thus divided and incomplete; the principles of the myriad things are thus fragmented and discordant. If one examines them through the completeness of the ancients’ learning, one knows that the one-sidedness of the hundred schools rarely embodies the beauty of Heaven and Earth or matches the countenance of spirit and illumination. The Dao within is its substance; the appearance of the Dao without is its function. *Cheng* means to be fitting and proper. Few can fittingly match the countenance of spirit and illumination—this speaks of the failure to be fitting. Inward sageliness is its substance; outward kingship is its function.",

Mozi advocated universal love and mutual benefit while opposing strife; his Way was free from anger. He was fond of learning and broadly knowledgeable, yet he did not differ in his rejection of the ancient rites and music. The ancient rites and music included the Yellow Emperor’s *Xian Chi*, Yao’s *Da Zhang*, Shun’s *Da Shao*, Yu’s *Da Xia*, Tang’s *Da Huo*, King Wen’s *Piyong* music, and King Wu and the Duke of Zhou’s *Wu*. In ancient funeral rites, the noble and base had their proper forms, the high and low their distinctions: the Son of Heaven had seven layers of inner and outer coffins, the feudal lords five, great officers three, and scholars two. Yet Mozi alone forbade singing in life and mourning garments in death, using a paulownia coffin three inches thick without an outer coffin as his model. Teaching others thus, he surely did not love them; practicing it himself, he certainly did not love himself.

One fears it cannot serve as the Way of the sage, but rather turns the hearts of the world against it. The world cannot bear it. Though Mozi alone could endure it, what could he do about the world? Separated from the world, he was far indeed from kingship.\n\nMozi spoke of the Dao, saying: \"In former times, Yu dammed the floodwaters, dredged the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, and opened the way to the four barbarians and the nine provinces. The great rivers numbered three hundred, the tributaries three thousand, and the smaller streams were beyond counting. Yu personally wielded the spade and plowshare, crossing all the rivers of the world. His calves were without flesh, his shins without hair; his hair was drenched by heavy rains, his head combed by fierce winds. He established ten thousand states—Yu was a great sage, yet his body toiled for the world. If later generations of Mohists take wearing coarse cloth as their garb and straw sandals as their footwear, laboring day and night without rest, and making self-suffering their utmost limit, saying, ‘If one cannot do this, it is not the Way of Yu,’ then they are not worthy to be called Mohists.\"\n\nXiangli Qin’s disciples, the followers of Wu Hou, the southern Mohists Ku Huo, Yi Chi, Deng Lingzi, and their like—all recited the *Mo Jing* but diverged in their interpretations, calling one another \"heterodox Mohists.\" They disparaged one another with debates on \"hard and white\" and \"same and different,\" responded to one another with arguments of \"odd and even\" and \"non-opposition,\" and revered the *Juzi* as a sage, all wishing to be his successor. Even now, they have not settled the matter. Mo Di and Qin Guli’s intentions were thus, but their conduct was otherwise. They would have later Mohists necessarily emulate Yu, with calves without flesh and shins without hair, advancing one another in this alone.

      "translated_text": "Though their lives were marked by toil and hardship, their deaths by meager burials—*excessive frugality* here meaning extreme simplicity—their conduct was such that others found it difficult to emulate. *Difficult to emulate* refers to the impracticability of their actions for others. They contravened the hearts of all under heaven and stood apart from human feeling. Though the world could not endure such austerity, Mozi alone could bear it—*endurance* here meaning forbearance. Yet even if one man alone could endure, how could the world at large do so? Having severed themselves from the human heart, such a doctrine could not serve as the Way to rule all under heaven.\n\nBetween heaven and earth, the great rivers are the *ming-chuan*; their tributaries were dredged and channeled by Yu. The *tuo* is an earthen vessel, and the *si* a tool for digging. The nine tones harmonized their labors to jointly govern the rivers of the world. Mozi’s followers claimed that even the great sage Yu toiled so strenuously—how much more so for others? *Jū* and *jī* are sandals: wooden ones are *jū*, straw ones *jī*, both for daily use.\n\nXiangli Qin was a surname; *Qin* was his given name. He too studied Moism and became a teacher in the world. His disciples were followers from the courts of five feudal lords—such was the multitude of his students. Ku Huo, Yi Chi, and Denglingzi were three other names. These three, all residing in the south, also studied the Moist texts, yet their eccentricities and strangeness surpassed even Mozi’s. Moreover, their doctrines diverged, so they styled themselves separately from Moism—*distinct schools* here meaning sectarian divisions. *Neither conflicting nor identical*: though odd and even are fundamentally distinct, they claimed no contradiction—this was mere sophistry. Their debates employed such paradoxes, hence they were said to *correspond*. The *juzi* were akin to the foremost disciples—akin to the Zen notion of *dharma heirs*. Among the many who transmitted their teachings, the most accomplished were deemed sages and made the focal point—*shi* meaning the principal. They hoped to be succeeded by later generations, the *juzi* passing the mantle to their disciples, who would then become their *descendants*—*descendants* here meaning posterity. *Indecisive and unresolved*: their transmission persists to this day.\n\nTracing its origins, Mo Di’s intent was indeed noble, but his conduct was excessive. Thus it was said: the intent was sound, but the practice was flawed. *Mutual advancement* means mutual esteem. Those who transmitted Mozi’s Way vied in self-imposed hardship, seeking thereby to govern the world. Yet no governance was ever achieved; instead, they first invited chaos. Thus it was said: *chaos supreme*. Nevertheless, Mozi’s devotion arose from the sincerity of his heart—such a man is no longer found in this age. *Sought in vain* means no such person remains. *Unrelenting and unceasing*: though he exhausted himself to the point of emaciation, he did not stop—truly a man of heroic mettle. *Talented scholar* is a term for such heroic figures.\n\nMencius refuted Yang Zhu and Mo Di; this text likewise often pairs them. Yet in this discussion of the various schools divided by their doctrines, Yangism is not mentioned, for its teachings were deemed unworthy of comparison. *Unburdened by custom, unadorned by things, uncompromising toward others, unenvious of the multitude*—they wished for the peace and security of all under heaven, to preserve human life, and to cease when the sustenance of self and others was fulfilled. Thus they *clarified the heart*—this was the ancient Daoist art.\n\nSong Jian and Yin Wen heard of this teaching and delighted in it. They fashioned the *Mount Hua cap* as a symbol, engaging with all things by beginning with *distinguishing restraint*. They spoke of the *capacity of the heart*, calling it the *conduct of the heart*. They sought to *join in harmony* and *pacify the world*, proposing to establish them as leaders. They saw insult as no disgrace, sought to rescue the people from strife, forbid aggression, and end warfare—thus saving the world from conflict. With this, they traversed the world, teaching rulers above and the people below. Though the world did not accept them, they persisted stubbornly and unceasingly. Thus it was said: *seen with disdain above and below, yet they forced themselves upon others*.\n\n*Unburdened by custom* means free from worldly entanglements. *Unadorned by things* means not indulging in external goods. *Unenvious of the multitude* means not opposing human feeling. They wished for every person to live, regarding others as themselves, desiring only that all be sufficiently provided for. With this as their heart, they proclaimed it to the world—this was the teaching of Song Jian and Yin Wen.\n\nThe *Mount Hua cap* was its name. *Distinguishing restraint* is akin to *being in restraint*—adapting to one’s lot is *distinguishing*, and being at ease is *restraint*. This was their starting point for engaging with all things. *Capacity of the heart* refers to the heart’s nature. They expounded its principles to others, calling it the *conduct of the heart*—*conduct* being the heart’s function, akin to what the Buddhists call *great function manifesting before one*. They sought to *join in harmony* and foster goodwill, thereby *pacifying the four seas*, and proposed to establish Song Jian and Yin Wen as the leaders of their teaching.\n\nSeeing the people’s fondness for strife, they taught *enduring insult without disgrace* to rescue them. Seeing the age’s fondness for warfare, they taught *forbidding aggression and ending warfare* to save it. Above, they instructed rulers; below, they taught the people. Though the world did not heed them, they persisted stubbornly and unceasingly—boasting without end. *Seen with disdain above and below, yet they forced themselves upon others*: this must have been a contemporary saying, hence its use to conclude the passage.\n\nNevertheless, their concern for others was too great, and their care for themselves too little. They said: \"Let us simply set aside five *sheng* of rice—enough.\" The master feared he would not be full, yet the disciples, though hungry, did not forget the world, toiling day and night without rest, saying: \"I must surely save it!\" How haughty were these *saviors of the world*!\n\nTheir concern for others was excessive, their self-imposed suffering extreme. Their teaching held that each day, only five *sheng* of rice were needed, shared between master and disciples. The master, with these five *sheng*, still went hungry—how could the disciples not? They endured hunger to establish their teaching, declaring: \"We do not forget the world, toiling day and night without cease. We say: our self-imposed suffering is thus—how could this be a path to long life? Yet we do this to correct those who feign concern for saving the world while seeking their own gain.\" Thus it was said: *how haughty were these saviors of the world*! *Haughty* means *to correct*—akin to Yu Rang’s words: \"I do this with utmost difficulty to shame those ministers of the world who harbor disloyalty.\" This is the same sentiment. Li Bai’s poem *Drinking Alone, Sent to Wei Liu* says: \"I think of you wandering the world, so proud and self-mocking\"—this is the same *haughty*.\n\nThey said: \"The noble man does not engage in petty scrutiny, nor lend himself to things. What brings no benefit to the world is not worth clarifying—better to remain silent. Externally, they forbade aggression and ended warfare; internally, they advocated *few desires and shallow passions*. In their conduct, whether grand or fine, coarse or refined, they went no further than this.\"",
      "overlap_context": "f self-inflicted suffering. *Ultimate collapse* refers to the inevitable impracticability of Mozi’s Way. Human life cannot be without song, yet Mozi condemned singing; human nature cannot be without weeping, yet Mozi condemned weeping; human sentiment cannot be without joy, yet Mozi condemned joy. His Way entirely disregarded human feeling—thus it was said, \"Could this truly be *near* to human nature?\" *Near* here means akin. The question is: could such a doctrine truly align with human feeling?",

      "translated_text": "Their teachings further stated: \"Not to engage in petty scrutiny\"—for petty scrutiny precludes *distinguishing the bounded*. This means one ought not insist on the distinction between self and other. \"Not to lend oneself to things\" means to act entirely on one’s own, never relying on others for assistance. If something brings harm to the world without benefit, even if one clearly recognizes its feasibility, it is better to refrain—hence it was said: *to clarify it is not as good as to leave it be*. The essence of their learning aimed for people to have no conflicts of attack and warfare externally, and no turbulence of passions internally. *Few and shallow* means to diminish and pare down desires. Though their learning varied in scope—grand or fine, coarse or refined—their conduct in practice amounted to no more than this. *Merely* means *only thus*.\n\nImpartial yet not partisan, easygoing yet without self-interest, resolute without fixed inclinations, they let things take their course without dualistic attachment. In deliberation, they did not scheme with cunning; in encountering things, they made no choices but moved with them. Such were the ancient arts of the Dao that resided in this. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao heard of this teaching and delighted in it. They took *equalizing the myriad things* as their foremost principle, saying: \"Heaven can cover but cannot bear; Earth can bear but cannot cover. The great Dao can encompass but cannot discriminate. Knowing that all things have their *can* and *cannot*, thus it was said: *Selection is not universal; teaching does not reach all; only the Dao leaves nothing out.*\"\n\nTherefore, Shen Dao abandoned knowledge, relinquished the self, and followed necessity. He refined and sifted things to establish his principle, saying: \"To know that one does not know is to approach thinly the realm of knowing—only then does one avoid harm.\" *Xi* and *ke*, unburdened, mocked the world’s esteem for worthies. Unrestrained and unprincipled, they rejected the world’s great sages. *Chui*, *pai*, *wan*, and *duan*, they turned with things, relinquishing right and wrong. If it could help one escape, they did not scorn even the basest means. They did not model themselves on wisdom and planning, nor distinguish before and after. *Wei* and *ran*, they simply acted thus.\n\nPushed, then they moved; dragged, then they followed—like the whirling of a drifting wind, the circling of a feather, the grinding of a millstone’s track. Whole yet without fault, in motion or stillness never transgressing, they never incurred blame. Why was this? Because things without knowledge have no peril of self-assertion, no encumbrance of cleverness. In movement and stillness, they never strayed from principle—thus they ended their lives without praise. Hence it was said: *To be like things without knowledge is sufficient. There is no need for worthies and sages.* A clod of earth never loses the Dao, yet heroes of the age laughed together, saying: \"Shen Dao’s Way is not the conduct of the living but the principle of the dead—how bizarre!\"\n\nTian Pian was likewise. He studied under Peng Meng and attained *non-teaching*. Peng Meng’s master said: \"The Daoist of old reached the point of neither affirming nor negating anything.\" His manner was *huo*-like, indescribably strange. He often contradicted others, yet could not avoid being *yuan*-like in his judgments. What he called the Dao was not the Dao, and what he spoke as right inevitably fell into wrong. Though Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not know the Dao, in general they had once glimpsed it. Impartial and without self-interest, they were thus.",

      "translated_text": "The Way is level and smooth. To decisively cast aside private intentions and not incline toward any particular thing—this is to speak of the principle and tendency of the myriad things. Where there are not two, there is unity. Without regard for deliberation, without reliance on wisdom, without calculation or measurement—toward things, there is no selection, no discrimination, for the eye’s scope is even. Moving with them, one follows the natural and acts. Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao were all scholars of Qi. Their teaching held that heaven and earth are also among the myriad things: if called things, they are all equal and the same, yet that which stands at their head is the Way of non-action.\n\nHeaven can cover but cannot bear; earth can bear but cannot cover—this speaks of their partiality. The great Dao belongs to the scholars of the Daoist school. They know only to embrace all as one, without making distinctions. In that era, there was a kind of disputatious learning where every statement had its approvals and disapprovals, each speaking from its own partiality. If one were to select among the myriad things, one could never be all-encompassing; if this were made a teaching, it could never reach its ultimate. But if one returns to the Dao, there is nothing left unaddressed. Thus it is said: the Dao leaves nothing out, while selection always has its approvals and disapprovals.\n\nAbandoning knowledge, relinquishing the self, and following only what cannot be avoided—this is non-action. To be *lingtai* is to be untrammeled and free. *Lingran* and *shuai*, one is detached from things, without constraint. Those who take this as the principle of the Way regard the unhindered interaction of things as the highest principle. Their teaching says: if one divides by knowledge and ignorance, one will be pressed by knowledge and come near to self-injury. *Bopi* means pressing close. *Xike* is crooked and unsteady, the appearance of indecision. *Wu ren* means not applying the mind to affairs, not taking responsibility. To esteem worthies is to entrust them with affairs. Since they themselves do not engage in affairs, they laugh at the world’s esteem for worthies and the learning of sages that necessarily exalts conduct. Since they are unrestrained and without conduct, they deem the world’s scholars of sageliness to be in error.\n\n*Zhuipai*, *wanduan*—all convey the sense of having no sharp edges, turning with things without corners, neither affirming nor negating anything, taking as their aim merely to avoid entanglement with worldly burdens, not taking knowledge and deliberation as their guide, without thought or calculation. *Bu zhi qianhou*—without consideration of before or after, without planning. *Weiran*—the sense of being firmly fixed and unmoving.",

The turning of wind and the circling of feathers, the groove worn by a grinding stone—all serve as metaphors for being without intent and turning with things. *Sui*—to turn. *Hui*—to revolve. By not appearing blameworthy in the eyes of the world, one preserves oneself; movement and stillness follow their natural course without excess, and thus one incurs no fault with others.\n\nWhy does their learning take this form? It is said: only when things are without knowledge do they avoid the affliction of self-assertion and the burden of holding preferences; in movement and stillness, all follows the natural order, never departing from principle. Not seeking knowledge from others, one may pass a lifetime without praise—yet precisely because one is without praise, one is without blame. Thus it is said: \"They have never incurred fault.\" Things without knowledge—such as wood, stone, tiles, and pebbles—are of this kind. *Jian ji shi ji*—to establish oneself by being thus.\n\nHence their saying: \"What need has one in the world for the name of sage or worthy? If one can be like a clod of earth, a thing without knowledge, then one does not lose the Dao.\" Thus it is said: \"The clod does not lose the Dao.\" Such sayings resemble those of the ascetics who dwell in deep mountains and remote valleys, and so the heroic laugh at them, deeming them little better than the dead. *Shi de guai yan*—this speaks of how Peng Meng and his followers were met with astonishment by the world.",

      "translated_text": "Those who attain without instruction speak of how, in their initial learning, they naturally resonated in harmony without awaiting teaching to become capable. Peng Meng, too, had a teacher, whose words were: \"The ancients who possessed the Dao fundamentally took the absence of right and wrong as their guiding principle—*huòrán* like the sound of the wind.\" This means their speech issued forth like a gusting wind, *huòrán*, without harboring any intent; though they spoke, what place was there for deliberate speech? Thus it is said: \"How could one speak of it?\" Their views constantly opposed those of the world, unable to gather and align with the ranks of ordinary observation. Thus they became one-sided doctrines, merely seeking to be without sharp edges—like a turtle’s severed limb, without any angles. Though their words may have been grand, what they called the Dao was not the Dao. Thus they could not escape the world’s ridicule.\n\nPeng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao did not understand this. Zhuangzi’s judgment is contained in this single phrase: *Gài hū*—in broad overview, they had indeed heard something of this Dao, yet they did not grasp its true essence.\n\nSuch concluding passages reveal his literary artistry: taking the root as refined, things as coarse; regarding accumulation as insufficiency; dwelling in serene solitude with the numinous. The arts of the Dao in antiquity had their place in this. Guan Yin and Lao Dan heard of its influence and delighted in it. They established it upon the constancy of \"nonbeing and being,\" took the Great Unity as its core, made gentleness, weakness, and humility its outward form, and took emptiness and the non-destruction of the myriad things as its substance.\n\nGuan Yin said: \"Within oneself, do not settle; let forms and things manifest of themselves. In movement, be like water; in stillness, like a mirror; in response, like an echo. *Wù hū*—as if vanished; *jì hū*—as if silent; *qīng hū*—as if pure. All is the same.\"",

      "translated_text": "Those who attain harmony gain it; those who lose it never take the lead but always follow others. Lao Dan said: \"Know the masculine, guard the feminine, and be a ravine to the world. Know the bright, guard the humble, and be a valley to the world.\" All men seek to be first; he alone takes the rear, saying, \"Receive the world’s filth.\" All men seek the substantial; he alone takes the empty, for he has no hoarding. Thus, though he has abundance, he stands firm in his abundance. In conducting himself, he is unhurried and incurs no cost—this is non-action. While others laugh at the clever, he alone bends to preserve wholeness, saying, \"Simply avoid blame.\" He takes depth as his root and restraint as his discipline, for hardness breaks and sharpness blunts. Always tolerant toward things, never carving away at others—this may be called the ultimate. Ah, Guan Yin and Lao Dan! They were the vast and true persons of antiquity, rooted in the Dao. Things are but affairs of things; to regard accumulation as insufficiency is to speak of treasuring wealth for the world. Dwelling with the numinous is to guard the natural.\n\nGuan Yin was a disciple of Lao Dan—this remark about \"first serving as a younger brother, then as a teacher\" is but a witty turn of phrase in the moment. Taking \"nonbeing\" as its宗, the Great Ultimate’s beginning as its主—this is also a 主. Gentleness, weakness, and humility as its outward form mean that in engaging the world and responding to things, what appears externally is thus. In emptiness, all things are preserved whole; thus it is said, \"Taking emptiness and the non-destruction of the myriad things as its substance\"—this is the true substance. As Le Xuan said: \"Where nothing exists, the myriad things are complete.\"\n\n\"Within oneself, do not settle\"—this is to have no private agenda. \"Let forms and things manifest of themselves\"—this is to follow the forms of things as they naturally appear. Movement like water, stillness like a mirror, response like an echo—all are without intent. *Wù hū*—as if vanished: in the midst of vagueness, as if something exists yet also as if nothing exists. *Jì hū*—as if silent: its purity is unseen, unnameable. To be in harmony with things is to be in accord; to have no attainment is to attain—having attainment is to lose. Never taking the lead, always following others: this is to move only when pressed, to rise only when unavoidable. \"Know the masculine, guard the feminine\"—this is to be capable yet yield to incapability. \"Know the bright, guard the humble\"—this is to be lofty without appearing so. Ravines and valleys lie low yet contain all things; to be a ravine or valley is to embody the greatness of capacity. All men seek to be first; he alone takes the rear—this is never taking the lead but always following. \"Receiving the world’s filth\" is to know the bright yet guard the humble. Not taking the substantial as substantial, but the empty as substantial—thus it is said, \"All men seek the substantial; he alone takes the empty, for he has no hoarding.\" Thus, he has abundance—this is to regard accumulation as insufficiency. Only by taking the empty as substantial can he stand firm in abundance without hoarding, embodying the idea that \"where nothing exists, the myriad things are complete.\" Unhurried, at ease, incurring no cost—this is to suffer no loss. All men take cleverness as cleverness; he alone takes non-action as cleverness, hence their laughter. All men take fortune as fortune; he alone takes the absence of misfortune as fortune. \"Bending to preserve wholeness\" is to yield and thereby preserve oneself. \"Simply avoid blame\"—no fortune is greater than the absence of misfortune. \"Taking depth as the root\" means his foundation lies in the Great Ultimate’s beginning. \"Taking restraint as the discipline\" means using utmost simplicity as the method of self-preservation. Discipline is method. All things hard or sharp will break or be blunted—this is the meaning of \"teeth, being hard, break.\" To have the capacity to contain all things is to leave no opening for others to carve away. \"Never carving away at others\" means to preserve one’s life alone. This may be called the ultimate—this is the ultimate Dao of the world. To call them \"vast and true persons\" is an expression of reverence.\n\nVast and formless, ever-changing without constancy, death and life, heaven and earth, the numinous and the obscure—where do they go? Where do they proceed? The myriad things are all encompassed, yet none can be taken as a refuge. The arts of the Dao in antiquity had their place in this. Zhuang Zhou heard of its influence and delighted in it. With words of boundless strangeness and reckless abandon, without beginning or end, he gave free rein to his thoughts without restraint, not seeking to be seen as peculiar. Taking the world as turbid and unfit for solemn speech, he used careless words to ramble, weighty words as truth, and parables to broaden his reach. Alone, he roamed with the spirit of heaven and earth, yet did not look down upon the myriad things. He did not dispute right and wrong, but dwelt with the common world. Though his book is vast and unbridled, it is harmless; though its words are uneven and strange, they are worth observing. Its fullness cannot be exhausted. Above, he roamed with the Creator; below, he befriended those beyond life and death, without beginning or end. In its fundamentals, it is refined, great, profound, and expansive; in its宗, it may be called harmonious and supremely successful. Yet though it responds to transformation and dissolves things, its principles are inexhaustible, its coming unchanging. Vague and obscure—who can fully fathom it?",

      "translated_text": "Those of superior attainment can thereby ascend to comprehend Heavenly principle. Though his words all arise from non-action and spontaneity, when applied to the world, they respond to education and transformation, elucidating the principles of things—meaning they can transform customs and clarify principles. \"Its principles are inexhaustible\" means their application is without end. \"Unchanging\" means his words derive from the Dao and do not deviate from it.\n\n\"Vast and obscure\"—these words describe the profound depth of his book. \"Not yet fully expressed\" means what he has grasped in his heart cannot be fully conveyed through language.\n\nFrom the beginning to this point, five aspects have been distinguished, and he positions himself as not having succeeded Laozi, explicitly stating that his learning derives from Laozi. The previous three sections each begin with \"though,\" all adjudicating the right and wrong of his learning—only Laozi is exempt. Here, he again uses \"though,\" indicating that his learning is not without worldly use. This is where the text shifts, and the brushwork is at its finest; it must be examined carefully.\n\nHui Shi was multifaceted; his writings filled five carts, yet his Dao was contradictory and his words off the mark. His \"Investigating Things\" states: \"The utmost great has no exterior—call it the Great One. The utmost small has no interior—call it the Small One. Without thickness, it cannot accumulate.\" Yet it can extend to a thousand *li*. Heaven and earth, though high and low, are equal; mountains and marshes, though elevated and sunken, are level. The sun is square when centered, square when askew. Things are born and die simultaneously. Great sameness and minor sameness differ—this is called minor sameness and difference. All things are entirely the same and entirely different—this is called great sameness and difference.\n\nFollowers like Mo Di, Song Xing, Peng Meng, Tian Pian, and Shen Dao were still partial in their grasp of the Dao, but Hui Shi merely delighted in debate and did not partake in the true arts of the Dao. Thus, he is mentioned at the end of the chapter, merely as one who \"heard the wind.\" His writings filled five carts, yet they were insufficient. Though voluminous, his learning was not correct, and his words were also misplaced, hence the criticism of their contradictions and inaccuracy.\n\n\"Investigating Things\" means examining the principles of things one by one. \"The utmost great has no exterior\" refers to the great void. \"The utmost small has no interior\" refers to the tip of an autumn hair. These eight characters align with what Zhuangzi describes, but calling them the Great One and Small One invites the start of debate. If it is called \"One,\" there is no great or small. Distinguishing great and small within the One is merely difference within sameness and sameness within difference.\n\n\"Without thickness\" means extremely thin. \"Cannot accumulate\" means that if accumulated, it becomes thick. If accumulation continues without end, it can extend to a thousand *li*—thus, great and small are the same. A thousand *li* of greatness is merely the accumulation of what is without thickness. Though heaven is high and earth low, when heavenly *qi* descends, it too becomes low. Thus, heaven and earth are low. Though mountains are higher than marshes, the *qi* of marshes can reach mountains, so mountains and marshes are level.\n\n\"Askew\" means to look sideways. When the sun is centered, looking at it sideways makes it no longer centered—yet calling the centered \"askew\" is also possible. Thus, it is square when centered, square when askew. Things are born, yet their seeds must have died the day before—thus, they are born and die simultaneously. There is great and small—this is minor sameness and difference. Uniting all things in sameness and difference is great sameness and difference. Though called great, it does not transcend the accumulation of small things; though called small, when combined, it can become great—thus, there is neither sameness nor difference.\n\n\"In the south, there is no limit, yet there is a limit. Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday. Linked rings can be untied. I know the center of the world lies north of Yan and south of Yue. To embrace all things, heaven and earth are one body.\" Hui Shi regarded these as grand insights into the world and sought to enlighten debaters. The debaters of the world delighted in them together.\n\nThe southern sea has no limit, yet if one speaks of it as a direction, it must have a limit—this applies to all four directions. Speaking only of the south is not to single it out but to imply the other three, for heaven tilts to the northwest, and the sea lies only in the south, farther than the other three directions, hence the emphasis. \"Today I go to Yue, yet I arrived yesterday\" means that though one’s feet have not yet reached Yue, knowing of Yue’s existence and that one will arrive later makes it possible to say that today’s departure is yesterday’s arrival.\n\nLinked rings, though inseparable, must each form its own circle and cannot adhere to one another. If they do not adhere, they are not truly linked rings. Yan lies in the north, Yue in the south—neither is the center of the world. Yet the people of Yan know only Yan, and the people of Yue know only Yue. In the world’s beginning, they knew nothing of one another, so each took their own land as the world’s center. If all things and heaven and earth are one, then though heaven and earth are vast, they are but one thing among the myriad—how can there be great or small? They are one body.\n\n\"Grand insight\" means regarding this as uniquely lofty in the world. Thus, he used these ideas to instruct debaters. As the world’s scholars delighted in them, his influence spread, giving rise to further arguments: eggs have feathers, chickens have three feet, Ying possesses the world, dogs can be sheep, horses lay eggs, *ding*-insects have tails, fire is not hot, mountains have mouths, wheels do not touch the ground, eyes do not see, fingers do not reach, arrival is not cessation, tortoises are longer than snakes, squares are not square, compasses cannot draw circles, chisels do not fit tenons, the shadow of a flying bird never moves, the speed of an arrow has moments of neither motion nor stillness, dogs are not hounds, a yellow horse and black ox make three, a white dog is black, orphaned colts never had mothers, a one-foot rod halved daily will never be exhausted in ten thousand generations.\n\nDebaters used these to engage with Hui Shi, endlessly. Huan Tuan, Gongsun Long, and their ilk—these debaters adorned people’s minds and altered their intentions. They could win in speech but not convince the heart—this was the limitation of debaters. Hui Shi daily used his knowledge to debate others, particularly delighting in the world’s debaters with his strangeness—this was his root.\n\nYet Hui Shi’s oral debates led him to consider himself the most worthy, saying, \"Is not heaven and earth grand?\" He possessed ambition but no method.\n\n\"Eggs have feathers\" means that though feathers in eggs are not yet visible, sparrows and chickens each have distinct feathers. For example, if a chicken were a duck, hatching from an egg would produce duck feathers, not chicken feathers—thus, eggs have feathers.\n\n\"Chickens have three feet\"—chickens inherently have two feet, but there must be something that moves them, making three.\n\n\"Ying possesses the world\"—Ying was the capital of Chu, and its king ruled as if he possessed the world.\n\n(Continued in next section)",

      "translated_text": "\"A dog can be called a sheep\"—the names \"dog\" and \"sheep\" arise from humans, not from the things themselves. Had these names been assigned differently at the beginning of creation, calling a dog a sheep would now make it a sheep, just as calling a sheep a dog would now make it a dog.\n\n\"Horses lay eggs\"—though viviparity differs from oviparity, the terms \"womb-born\" and \"egg-born\" are human designations. If one were to call womb-born creatures egg-born, the same logic applies as with dogs and sheep.\n\n\"Dingzi\" refers to the toad. In Chu, it is called *dingzi*. Though the *dingzi* has no tail, in its earliest form it was a tadpole, and tadpoles do have tails. Thus, one could also say the *dingzi* has a tail.\n\n\"Water is cold, fire is hot\"—these too are human names. Yet there are fire-dwelling rats and fire-washed cloth. If rats can enter and exit fire, and fire can wash cloth, then fire is not inherently hot.\n\nAn echo in an empty valley responds to a human call—is this not the mountain having a mouth? A wheel moves upon the earth, yet once its rim touches the ground, it cannot turn. Thus, one could also say the wheel does not roll upon the earth.\n\nOne points only after seeing, and what the eye reaches, the finger can indicate. Yet where the eye cannot reach, the finger cannot see—thus, what reaches is neither the eye nor the finger alone, and they cannot be entirely separated.\n\n\"A tortoise is longer than a snake\"—if a tortoise were as long as a snake, it would no longer be called a tortoise. Since it is called a tortoise, its length must be as it is. Thus, one could also say it is longer than a snake.\n\n\"A square is a *ju*, a circle is a *gui*\"—once called a *ju*, it cannot also be called square; once called a *gui*, it cannot also be called round. Though the tenon fits within the mortise, its rotation is not constrained by the mortise—thus, one could also say it is not enclosed, for the enclosure does not hold it fast.\n\nWhen a bird flies, its shadow follows and departs with it. One may say the bird flies, but not that the shadow moves. Though an arrow’s flight is swift, while it is in the bow, it is at rest; when it reaches the target, it is in motion. Between leaving the bow and striking the target, there is a moment when it is neither moving nor still.\n\n\"Dog\" and \"canine\" refer to the same thing. If called a dog, it cannot be called a canine; if called a canine, it cannot be called a dog. Thus, it is said, \"A dog is not a canine.\"\n\n\"A horse and an ox have two bodies; a yellow-black horse has color\"—if one speaks of two bodies and color together, then it is three. A yellow-black horse has two colors. Horses and oxen are both bodies, and two colors appearing on a body make three.\n\n\"White dog, black\"—if the names \"white\" and \"black\" did not arise at the beginning of creation, then one could also call white black.\n\n\"A lone colt has never had a mother\"—calling it \"lone\" implies it has no mother. One cannot say it is lone while also saying it once had a mother.\n\nA one-foot staff broken in two: today one uses this half, tomorrow that half. Though it may be used endlessly through myriad generations, it will never be exhausted.",
      "overlap_context": " means that though feathers in eggs are not yet visible, sparrows and chickens each have distinct feathers. For example, if a chicken were a duck, hatching from an egg would produce duck feathers, not chicken feathers—thus, eggs have feathers.\n\n\"Chickens have three feet\"—chickens inherently have two feet, but there must be something that moves them, making three.\n\n\"Ying possesses the world\"—Ying was the capital of Chu, and its king ruled as if he possessed the world.\n\n(Continued in next section)",

      "translated_text": "All the above are but studies under Master Hui, expanding his doctrines to engage with him, persisting in contentious debate throughout their lives—such were the likes of Huan Tuan and Gongsun Long. To adorn another’s mind is to obscure it; to alter another’s intent is to disorder it. Though one may momentarily prevail in debate, the other’s heart remains unconvinced—such debaters are deluded by their own cleverness without self-awareness. Thus it is said: \"Hui Shi was confined by his own learning, daily relying on his wit to contend with others in debate.\" *Te* means \"only\"; alone with his followers, he was but an object of wonder—his true capacity no more than this. Thus it is said: \"This was his root.\" *Di* means \"root.\" Relying solely on his eloquence, he deemed his might equal to heaven and earth. Though he fancied himself lofty, in truth he lacked all learning.\n\nIn the south there was a man named Huang Liao who asked why heaven does not fall, why earth does not sink, and what causes wind, rain, thunder, and lightning. Hui Shi neither declined nor hesitated, answering without deliberation, discoursing exhaustively on the principles of the myriad things without cease, yet still considering his words too few. He augmented them with bizarre theories, reversing common understanding to claim truth, seeking victory over others in reputation. Thus he was ill-suited to the world. Weak in virtue, strong in things, his path was obscure. Viewed through the Dao of heaven and earth, Hui Shi’s abilities were but the labor of a mosquito or a gnat—what use were they to the world? Thus it is said: \"What need?\" If one’s fulfillment lies in private conviction, it may yet be called noble, approaching the Way. But Hui Shi could not find peace in this; scattered among the myriad things without surfeit, he ended with a reputation for clever debate. Alas for Hui Shi’s talent—unbridled yet unable to follow, chasing the ten thousand things without return, like an echo pursuing sound or a shadow racing form. How lamentable!\n\nThe man who posed the question was an eccentric from the south. There was in the south a singularly lofty man named Huang Liao who asked Hui Shi: \"Why does heaven not fall? Why does earth not sink? Who governs wind, rain, thunder, and lightning?\" These are the marvels of creation—how could they be encompassed in words? Hui Shi neither declined nor demurred, answering without thought, responding extemporaneously. He discoursed on the principles of the myriad things in all their complexity, yet still deemed his words too few. He added strange and outlandish theories, taking contrarian views as proof, seeking to surpass others in reputation. Thus he was at odds with the world, ill-suited and discordant. Within, he had no true attainment—thus it is said he was \"weak in virtue.\" Outwardly, he forced his arguments—thus it is said he was \"strong in things.\" *Ao* means \"obscure\"; his path was neither bright nor upright, but dark and recondite. Measured against the Dao of heaven and earth, Hui Shi’s abilities were like those of a mosquito or a gnat—what use were they to the world? Thus it is said: \"What need?\" If one’s fulfillment lies in private conviction alone, it may yet be called noble. But to deem this superior to the noble Way is perilous. *Yu* means \"to surpass",

      "translated_text": "Unable to find peace within himself, he failed to accept his proper place. Scattering his efforts among the myriad things, he sought their principles to accommodate his own theories, never satisfied. In the end, he never grasped the Dao, merely gaining fame through debate—this was his ruin.\n\nHui Shi was indeed a man of talent, yet his dissipation left him with no true attainment. Chasing after external things, he never turned back—how lamentable! *Tai* means \"dissipated.\" Echo arises from sound, yet sound is the root and echo the branch. To exhaust the echo in sound is to forget the root. Shadow arises from form, for form is the root and shadow the branch. To wish to still the shadow without stopping the form is to run alongside it, never understanding the root—this is the analogy.\n\nThis concludes the *Zhuangzi*. It ends with Hui Shi, not because he stood among those who heard the Dao, but because the words of debaters, though they turn nothing into something, possess their own strange distinctiveness. Thus they are placed at the end. Though writing a book differs from composing an essay, it too has its own structure, with deliberate openings and closings—each serving its purpose. Just as the *Spring and Autumn Annals* ends with the capture of the qilin, or the *Doctrine of the Mean* concludes with \"Heaven’s charge, without sound, without scent,\" so too do the inner chapters of this book, with their \"Chaos and the Seven Orifices,\" form a single structure—this must not be overlooked.\n\nThose who explain the classics often speak of literary technique but may lack deep understanding of principle; those well-versed in principle may neglect the art of writing. Thus their readings lack vitality, and their interpretations lack savor. Only Master Aixuan’s Dao was lofty, and his writing exquisitely refined—his exegesis of the Six Classics stands peerless through the ages. What a pity that after Wangshan and Lexuan, his learning was not transmitted, and no one today knows of it.\n\n*Zhuangzi Kouyi*, Scroll Ten.",
